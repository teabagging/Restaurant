I've been to Portland a couple times before but each time I've missed the opportunity to make it out to this well known restaurant. Lucky for me this time around we came during lunch on a weekday so we beat the rush. WOOHOO. We came around 11AM and we were seated immediately in their covered outside seating.\\n\\nSo for this visit got to give it 5 stars since there was no wait! \\n\\nFOOD: 4.5 stars. It was reaaaaly close to give the full 5 stars but the grits were OK for me. \\n\\n+ Chicken & Waffles - I loved how you can choose how large of an order you want starting from 1 piece of chicken up to 3 pieces. The chicken here is moist with great flavoring. The outside is crisp but not too oily. Winning. I was also surprised to find that they offered a sweet waffle to pair with the chicken. At first I thought it was carrot but it was actually sweet potato. It pairs well with the spice of the chicken and syrup. \\n\\n+ Side of biscuits & sausage gravy (no eggs) - I love me some biscuits & gravy so this had to be the other entree we ordered. The biscuits here are flaky and the gravy was so rich with the sausage and herbs. Surprisingly I didn't feel too stuffed after we demolished both biscuits so I think it was a good option to not have the 2 eggs. \\n\\n+ Cheese Grits - This side fell a little flat for me. I think I need to be in a grits mood to eat this, but it was a little too runny for my liking. It wasn't bad per se, but it wasn't my preference for grits. If you're curious it's worth trying. \\n\\nSERVICE: 5 Stars - Our waiter was super friendly and check in often to make sure everything was delicious and we had everything we needed.

I'd like to simply note that, almost always without exception, when a brand spankin' new restaurant opens up, almost ALWAYS it takes a few weeks to a month or so to get the kinks out of the operation. Usually I don't even go to a restaurant until it's been open for business for at least a month, as usually, the first month or so, something is lacking. Perhaps there are issues in the kitchen or with some dishes. Perhaps there are issues with service. Perhaps there are issues with taking payments. Perhaps there are issues with the actual facility or venue. Sometimes there are multiple issues with a combination of these or other factors. Usually it takes a while to recognize the issues and then to address and \\"fix\\" them. I can't recall ever going to a brand new restaurant where EVERYTHING ran smoothly, the servers were all amazing, every dish ordered was amazing, and there was absolutely nothing to complain about. Not even remotely. This is such a place. \\n\\nI recently visited with my elderly parents who were visiting from Montreal. They are NOT what you'd call \\"adventurous eaters\\" (if you knew them, you'd laugh hysterically at this understatement). My dad is also incredibly .... picky (God bless him, he's 90 years old, so it's more than accepted). I say this so you the reader understand that my folks do not usually make for an easy party to serve when dining out. We had Jason serving us and he was unbelievable. They loved him to pieces. So professional, so polite, so efficient, so genuinely friendly. They ordered classic breakfasts with eggs and bacon (ordered \\"crisp\\"), toast. My meal also came with the potatoes and, although I'm not usually a fan, these were hands-down the best breakfast potatoes I ever had in my life. Everything was perfect. Spoke to Leo (another server) who was also super nice (I had heard great things about him). \\n\\nWhen we were leaving, my dad encountered some issues while paying (new girl at the cash, breaking a larger denomination bill, he had to return when he realized he was short some money). Anyhow, my mother and I were concerned that my father accidentally returned and got the cash that he meant to leave for Jason's tip, so I called the next day and spoke to Darren, the manager. He was taken aback by my call, but I explained how mortified I'd be (as would my dad be!) if we accidentally did not tip Jason who was so amazing. I had planned on returning to leave a tip if none was left the day earlier. Darren said he'd investigate and call me back later, and he really appreciated my call and our concern. And he DID follow up and call me back! (Considering how popular and busy this place is, I was really impressed he remembered!).

Only a few tables. Bad sign. One good thing though, it is a clean restaurant with good service. Although one of the female staff is a bit crass and lacks a friendly demeanor and thinks it's acceptable to hollar at other staff from across the restaurant. \\n The food was absolutely terrible except for the naan (which always ran out).  It was as if they have a chef that isn't Indian or has very little experience in a kitchen, let alone Indian cuisine. Why on earth and how dare you use M.S.G. in the food??  Believe me I can tell.  The food was too salty and lacked absolutely any bit of spice heat.  The curry chicken was the absolute worst attempt I've ever seen or tried in my life. Was like salty soup. The butter chicken was sweet and salty...gross.  They use days old pieces of chicken and toss it in the butter chicken sauce and the curry chicken sauce. It's not cooked together and it's disgusting and old. I was appaled. Really tired of restaurants using old pre-cooked chicken that's been sitting in the fridge for days in dishes. The saag was gross. They use too much cumin in their curry and saag, that it overpowers and makes the dish taste completely off. Their battered & fried potatoes were good but barely cooked and were still way too firm.

The first time I remember it was a pretty decent experience. I think I might've gotten a burger, but I do remember those shoestring fries. Delicious town: population shoestring fries.  The drinks, ie the margaritas were pretty good as well.\\n\\nThe 2nd time I went I was terribly disappointed. I got I believe some soft tacos during the lunch hour. It was very sub par presentation as everything was kind of just put on the plate. Granted, it was Tex Mex so I wasn't expecting anything extravagant, but still it would've been nice to see some effort. The food wasn't that good either. It wasn't by any measure memorable. I pretty much vowed never to go there again. Since this departure, I couldn't imagine going there again.\\n\\nFast forward a year and a half. I decided to give it another chance when my roommate and I wanted to grab lunch.  I was skeptical but I figured Id give it another chance, thinking that one time was just an off day. We were seated rather quickly, even though it was a pretty busy crowd at the time.  The place was of course loud but had a positive energy, with painted walls of various western scenes and characters, creating a nice rustic feel. Combined with the typical Tex Mex/hacienda feel, it was kind of nice and chill.\\n\\nThe chips we got were served all nice and warm-like which I appreciated. The salsa was really tasty as well. It was a nice blend of thick and thin mix.  Our server was very friendly and I soon found myself ordering the Gaucho Chicken, while my roommate ended ordering the Guadalajara Chicken.  \\n\\nIt was a short wait for the food, and I think when I saw what I had ordered I realized that it was in fact and off day the last time I went. The chicken was cooked nice and blackened, with two slices of tomatoes, over a bed of shoestring fries. Granted, the presentation was simple enough, but the food was pretty darn good. The tomatoes were a nice compliment to the chicken. It was really well cooked and I really liked the grilled taste.  The sauce that it came with was nice and tasty. It had basil and maybe cilantro. I wasn't sure. It was really good. The fries were, of course, awesome. They were well done and I was a fan of the crunchiness. However, this experience was nothing worth fawning over, of course, but with this kind of place, you know what to expect. It was good for what it was. The food was solid and it hit the spot. \\n\\nI think all in all, it was a good place to eat, but it's by no accounts an amazing place to eat. I didn't have a bad experience and I definitely encourage people to give it a try.  The food is decent enough and it's probably better suited for larger groups and families. I will probably be heading back to sample more of their beverages and meals, but for a good time and nice atmosphere, Border Cafe is a good place to check out."},{"name":"Aria","address":"490 E Paces Ferry Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"We came to celebrate our anniversary here this year and had a great experience.

Being a huge fan of Mexican cabrito, that was a mild disappointment, but not enough to take away any stars. Yes, it was that good (though due to the bones I would not choose this dish again).\\n\\nMy other friend ordered the Lamb Rogan Josh (and she too requested that it be spiced up).

The mac and cheese was absolutely amazing (see photo)! Deliciously cheesy with yet another layer of thick cheese on top of the dish! It was like a macaroni pot pie but instead of crust, it was more cheese! On the other hand- the gumbo was only OK. \\n\\nThen finally, the fried chicken and waffle arrived. Usually the waffle is just there in these dishes to compliment the fried chicken, but here, the waffle was a dish of it's own! Never had a sweet potato waffle before. As for the chicken, it was super peppered, crispy, tender..... I would say it was some of the best fried chicken and waffles I've had! Did I mention the chicken is extremely peppered? I'm pretty sensitive to spices/ spicy food.. so this was a bit too much for me. But it really didn't stop me from devouring it when drenched in syrup. It was that good! My friend who enjoys spices really loved it. She honestly kept going on and on about it.\\n\\nScreen Door was a perfect first meal in Portland for us. Although the food is really heavy, it was like that comfort food that you know you just can't resist! If anyone were to get one item here, get the chicken and waffles for sure!"},{"name":"Jake's Famous Crawfish","address":"401 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Normally love this place and the service is great but tonight we went into the bar for some quick dinner.

A good Cuban Sandwich will take care of ya! \\n\\nAlas, I have been searching for an authentic CS for nearly 10 years and I've finally found one.  Yes the place seems a little suspect by the neighborhood and storefront, by bygolly their food is amazing. When you first walk in you will notice the bakery style rows of fresh bread and a refrigerated cases of desserts that one could only imagine were created in some heavenly bakery by angels from the looks of them. \\n\\nThe only thing I've ever ordered is the CS  and some desserts via take out, but the gal working behind the counter is almost enough to make you want to come in for her hospitality alone. I frequently have her \\"surprise me \\" with a dessert choice and they are all amazing. My request always makes her retort with \\"I want to pick one to make you come back\\".  And I do. \\n\\nOn to the VIP, the sandwich.  Now where I come from there is no Mayo on the sandwich, not originally it was a later addition. Therefore I order without, but to each his own. The bread is perfect it its own Cuban-y way.. soft & chewy ( don't ask me the distinct cuban flavor the bread has, you'll just have to try it) . The pork, you could tell was slow roasted and tender, and seasoned to perfection. The ham sliced just the right thickness as to not overpower the roasted pork. And the swiss cheese was perfectly melted in its ratio to bread and meat.  You dont have to take my work for it, try one for yourself!\\n\\nI also recently read in The Chronicle that they have one of the 5 best burgers in Austin.

After we tried to go talk to the group, get their food to go, 3 large males surrounded my IDless friend, a 115 pound girl and demanded her immediate exit from both the bar and building all together, including the lobby. Her phone was dead, her friends were waiting to get their food to go because we understood she could not come in, she did not have keys to a car, it was after 10pm and it was dumping rain and snow.

Of 6-7 dishes that we ordered, I think we enjoyed 1. The others were good in theory but not executed well. Everything was over salted to the extreme. The first bite was good but then the salt overtook and many plates were left unfinished. The kitchen may have just been having at off night. However we had an 8:30 reservation and the place was not packed so I feel like things might just be slipping in the kitchen. Our server was a bit disappointing as well -- we were trying to figure out what the table next to us was eating and he essentially told us he didn't know. That was about it-- kind of awkward really since he should a) know the menu and b) know what he just placed on the table next to ours. The reality is that location seems to work in this restaurants favor but compared to other eateries in the Cambridge/Somerville area, Alden & Harlow should maybe step up their execution. They have the look the location the menu the drinks -- where's the heart? That's why I love to eat -- heart, passion, and community. Luckily we had a gift card for this meal.

Chef sent us a complimentary small plate of ham n cheese croquettes and it just melted in my mouth . Then we both shared the 32 oz. Porterhouse . It's made in the wood fire and the char outside of the steak was heavenly ! Inside so soft and just right . Comes with 3 types of salt and although my husband couldn't tell the difference between the 3 . I liked the Hawaiian black salt the most with the steak . We ordered a side of b√©arnaise but didn't even use it as the steak itself was so juicy and delicious . We also got a side of truffle Mac n cheese . Mac n cheese comes with shaved truffles on top. Even though ur actually eating the shaved truffles , u can't really taste the flavour . I find the truffle infused oil or butter to have more flavour n smell than shaved black truffles. Besides the point , the Mac n cheese was yummy ! I ordered their cosmo from the cocktail menu and that too was so unique and delicious. \\n\\nBy this time we both were so full that we couldn't bring ourselves to order a dessert . However they did send us a complimentary anniversary dessert plate and macarons were my favourite. \\n\\nAnother good one for the books and definitely recommend this place for their service , ambience , food and drinks . Im a huge Elisa fan now !"},{"name":"Old Xian's Food","address":"3779 Sexsmith Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"It sucks that they closed the Burnaby location, but this one is much better to be honest!

Shocking I know. This coffee shop has a really relaxed vibe, really tasty snacks (coming from a carnivore) and delicious coffee. What was most strange to me was utilizing oat milk in espresso beverages. I can honestly say I will be doing this at home from now on! The reason I had to take off a star was because of the staff. Holy rude. We walked in and the person at the front didn't even acknowledge our existence. She was chatting away with the other baristas about random topics that were apparently more important than taking our order. When we did order it was very blunt and rushed like we were wasting her time. Would we be back? Maybe, there are plenty of other coffee shops in the area that actually care about the customers. However, if someone asked me to meet them here I would."},{"name":"Fox Bros. Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I wanted to be blown away, but I wasn't.  Still Fox Bros. is very good, and I don't doubt that it may be the best BBQ in Atlanta.  However, I felt every dish I tried, I've had a better version of it somewhere else.  \\n\\nWe got there right as they opened on a Saturday at 11 am.  Even though we got the last spot in the parking lot, we still sat right down.  The advantage of getting there early is of course no wait, and I'm sure the wait is usually plenty here.  The disadvantage was ice cold sauce on the tables.  I'm sure it would warm up to room temperature as the day goes on, but one of my pet peeves is cold BBQ sauce on hot food.  Very few BBQ joints have a sauce warmer, which I've never figured out why.  That said, I like my BBQ to stand alone without sauce, with a good dry rub and a nice smoke to the meat.  And Fox Bros, pretty much does that.  I use the sauce for dipping a little here and there, and not for every bite either.  So the cold sauce didn't ruin my meal by a long shot.\\n\\nWe started off with a few smoked chicken wings.  These things were very disappointing.  I love smoked chicken wings, but these had no flavor to them.  For some reason they were served with blue cheese to dip in.  Unless you are having buffalo wing sauce, I'm not sure why you need blue cheese.  We asked for celery for the blue cheese but they didn't have any.  2.5 stars.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fox-bros-bar-b-q-atlanta?select=nwhpOmfk5Eb51_jY7wxBwA\\n\\n1/2 rack of St. Louis Style Spare ribs.  I'm not a huge rib tip fan, so St. Louis Style suits me just  fine.  These were perfectly tender and fell right off the bone.  The dry rub here was surprisingly on the sweet side, almost hinting that a little Chinese Red Sauce was added along with their dry peppery rub.  I could have used a little more smoke flavor to the ribs, but I did enjoy them.  4 stars  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fox-bros-bar-b-q-atlanta?select=nz0PHGEb_FftO1_nUtJSNQ\\n\\nBeef Short Rib.  This thing is huge!!  Which it better be for the $30 price tag.  It was half fat though.  I know it's a short rib, what do you expect?  The fat keeps the meat so succulent.  But this was beyond, and I'm sure could have been trimmed up better first without sacrificing the meat itself.  This dry rub was very very peppery, and a completely different flavor profile from the spare ribs.  Most of the dry rub stayed on the discarded fat layer (at least an inch and a half thick running the entire top of the short rib).  Although this took some knife and fork work to get to the meat, it was well worth the reward and was absolutely delicious.  4 stars  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fox-bros-bar-b-q-atlanta?select=el8GC_QM2-K3hwqTZ1rNAA\\n\\nSliced Brisket.  I'm so glad we decided to sample a 1/2 lb side of brisket.  This was my favorite meat by far.  Perfect amount of smoke flavoring to the beef and excellent dry rub.  I always prefer sliced rather than chopped because you always get the dry rub that way.  This was incredibly tender and was smoked nice and slow.  It flaked apart with a fork, just trying to pick up a slice.  5 stars.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fox-bros-bar-b-q-atlanta?select=P1craQUxcNdjLJoELPUT4g\\n\\nSides - We tried the Mac 'n Cheese, Collard Greens, and Baked Beans, the holy trinity of BBQ sides.  Thank goodness I'm back in the south.  While Fox Bros has Texas style meats, they have southern sides.  As far as I'm concerned, you can't beat southern sides.  So many times we get pinto beans and spicy this and that out here in California - yuck!  Give me some sweet molasses baked beans any day.  The greens were also very good, once we spiced them up with a little pepper vinegar, a must for greens for me, so I was happy to see it on the table.  The Mac 'n Cheese was also a nice use of shell pasta, since those shells can hold plenty of gooey cheese.\\n\\nI'd most definitely like to come back to Fox Bros sometime as there were plenty of other wonderful artery clogging dishes, mostly involving some kind of fried potatoes with brunswick stew, brisket, and melted cheese!   I'm guessing the burger is pretty good here as well, and would be on my to do list, since it's made with chopped brisket."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"If this review is going to be reflective at all of our time waiting in line for Franklins, it's that it's gonna be a long one folks! Maybe not as worth it was Franklins... but I try x]\\n\\nTips before we start: \\nYes, you're going to want to take time off to come here.\\nYou know what they say, \\"The Early Bird skips the worms and get Franklins\\" 7am seemed to work well for us.\\nA cooler is never a bad idea to wait with, you'll be there awhile. \\nMaybe bring a charger and a book and some friends too\\n\\nLocation? Contained in the neighborhoods of Central Austin off the 35, the area surrounding really isn't busy at all which is great because you don't really have to fight for parking along the streets. This actually might be why they are able to have so many people come and longer lines as opposed to if it were located say on Sixth street where it's already busy from all the other businesses. \\n\\nAs you read up top, yes the ideal time to come and wait would be around 7am. There are several reasons for this, first because towards opening time, they start breaking up the line a bit to get a feel for what time you can expect to eat, so the earlier you are, the higher the chance you have of getting the full selection of choices. Oh, didn't I mention that they run out of food typically before 3pm? Yeah. The second reason, and you'll thank me for this, is that they offer seats for people to grab so you can sit and wait in peace but there's a limited amount available. You can always buy a couple chairs at Walmart but... these are free guys. The third and most underrated reason for you to go early, is so that you can sit with a chair, towards the front and in the SHADE! From 7am-11am when they opened, we were comfortable and ready to eat, but when we had to go back to the car occasionally to grab something, you'd see the line wrapped around the corner and people sitting on the floor covering themselves with their jackets and drinking water. Austin summers and Texas in general are not nice to people. \\n\\nTHE BARBEQUE. Wow, let's start with what we ordered, because between the four of us, we had several pounds of various meats at our table, after watching it glisten in the light right before getting sliced into lovely pieces. We really let our eyes do the ordering because we ended up with 3 pounds of brisket, 2 pounds of ribs, and 1 pound of pulled pork. Was it too much for us four? Yes. Was it worth it? Absolutely. The brisket, broken between fatty and lean parts, held a marble like facade that glistened and was delectable with every bite. Basically? This sucker was delish and smoked for 18 hours. None of it was tough to chew, but 100% enjoyable. The pulled pork was packed with flavor, picking it apart having each bite let out some serious juices all over the place. Could easily see these suckers in a taco or something and hitting in the top ranks of tacos around Austin... just a thought. The ribs were one kick in the tastebuds, with such intense seasoning, I felt like my tongue was on crack that it had me coming back for more. That first bite into that tender, juicy goodness led to the meat just falling off the bone. I mean do ribs even get sexier than that? I've had to rethink many of my rib experiences, and tbh, this one takes the cake. After all that, notice I didn't mention much of the sauce? It's because truth be told sauce wasn't really needed. These were strong stand alone entrees that you could enjoy with the need for extra flavor. BUT, they are available and are pretty tasty, so I'd recommend giving it a go for the kick of it. \\n\\nHonorable mentions. We did order the potato salad, this was great in taste, standard in flavor, really a good combo with your bbq and would order again, just recommend having multiple people to eat this with, don't take it on yourself unless you want to eat less bbq. They sold various pies you could enjoy as dessert and these were pretty good. The bourbon banana was fresh and sweet so as to add a nice finish at the end of our meal left us with smiles from here to Houston. \\n\\nThe bathroom situation you don't really need to worry about, as they were kind enough to let people come in and use it before they open, just be wary of the line of customers to use it as well. You can also buy drinks while you wait (alcoholic and non-alcoholic alike), as well as other merch you can purch(ase) with the money from your honey LOL. \\n\\nOverall, Franklins was well worth the wait, worth the money, and worth the painful stomach aches from the excessive amount of food we had. Would I do it again? Over and over again my dude.

We had a group of ten and we sat near the back at a big table and went through five bottles of wine.  We got to choose the wine and they gave us some info before opening each one and then let us drink in peace.  It was more of a hang out session with friends than a true \\"wine tasting\\" but we still had a blast and would recommend doing it.

Thank god it wasn't their apartment building, that would have been awkward.\\n\\nWhat we found instead, down a set of stairs, was a cozily lit, posh little cocktail lounge/restaurant that had exactly the atmosphere we wanted for our first night in Boston.

This was my second time dining at Aria and, just as before, this was an amazing experience!\\n\\n[FOOD&DRINKS]\\nI feel like you really can't go wrong at this fine dining establishment. The taste, presentation, and atmosphere is always on point. I had initially wanted to chow down on the 7-course tasting menu, reasonably priced at $75 per person, but it unfortunately didn't include some of my must-tastes. Instead, between my BF and I, we ordered four snacks and appetizers to share: brie de meaux ($8), yellowtail hamachi (~$16), butter braised lobster (~$24), and foie gras ($24). Both hardcore carnivores, we decided on two meat entrees: spinalis steak (~$36) and venison (~37). A small basket of buttered soft bread was served at the table.\\n\\nWe started off with the brie. I love cheese but I can't do overpowering cheeses. Stuff like blue or goat cheese really puts a bad taste in my mouth. Thus, I stick to safe cheeses like brie and buratta plates. The brie cheese plate is considered a \\"snack\\" on Aria's menu and was the first dish served to our table. The brie is served with apricot preserves, walnuts, and toasted ciabatta. A simple and tasty dish to kick off the night. I just wish there was a tad bit more apricot preserves to go with the brie and ciabatta. \\n\\nNext, our three appetizers poured in. Our waiter was very attentive in making sure we got each plate right after the other--there was no lag-time in between dishes (wonderful!). The first appetizer we got was the yellowtail Hamachi. I am a big fan of yellowtail and BOY was this yellowtail out of this world. The fish was creamy and oh, it just melted in my mouth! The yellowtail is served with slices of grapefruit, orange, radish and avocado. I didn't take a bite of everything mixed together because I really wanted to savor the flavor of the yellowtail. Next came the buttered lobster. As to be expected, the lobster appetizer leaned towards the smaller side. Because my BF and I were sharing, everything came conveniently split between two plates. We each got a sample of the lobster on creamy truffle mashed potatoes and broccoli mousseline. Although, one mini-complaint would be I didn't really taste any truffle in the potatoes. Still, take a bite of everything, you won't regret it! Our final appetizer was one we both looked forward to the most, the foie gras. I hear Aria has one of the best foie gras south of New York, is that true? Oh boy, what delicacy! Aria's foie gras tastes as foie gras should, a perfect blend of silky and savory deliciousness, so rich and buttery it just melts in your mouth. WOW! I was not disappointed and this was definitely my favorite dish of the night. \\n\\nFinally, our entr√©es. Honestly, I think our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. I was already decently full without the entrees. But, how can I not try the venison? The idea itself is blasphemous (first world problems)! I have to comment on the presentation of the two entrees we got, B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L! I liked how the food looked almost like it was scattered across the plate absent-mindedly, a little bit here and a little bit there. The taste was, of course, out of this world. I preferred my BF's steak, while he preferred my venison. The venison had more flavor packed into it than the steak. Both meats were cooked to a perfect level of tenderness. \\n\\nUnfortunately, after a basket of bread, one snack, three appetizers, two entrees and drinks, we didn't have any room leftover for desserts. Next time!\\n\\n[SERVICE]\\nImpeccable! Our waiter was attentive yet did not hover. Like I said, my BF and I shared everything so every dish we ordered was conveniently pre-split between two plates. As soon as we finished, our next course came. No lag time, which really made the \\"flow\\" of the evening perfect. I just wanted to note we had some very nice people sitting on either side of us and we were able to make good conversations! \\n\\n[ATMOSPHERE&LOCATION]\\nLocated in Buckhead, in the same lot as some hotel. I feel like Aria could easily be missed if not for our GPS.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I wasn't planning on coming to Atlanta and having bbq... but here we are. And it's not because I'm on some 'I live in TN and I know BBQ blah blah blah' ridiculousness. It's more like 'I live in TN and I eat BBQ all the time. I should do something different.' But Fox Bros came highly recommended and I was coming on a Monday at lunch time, so now worries for crowds... why not?\\n\\nI can see how the parking lot can be a challenge. It's shallow and oddly-shaped. At peak hours, I would not want to navigate it. Even when I showed up (around 230 pm), I snagged one of the last available spots. The struggle is real. Imagine my surprise, then, to find a dining room that wasn't packed to the brim. Because I was eating solo, I opted for a high top by the bar, rather than taking up a four-top table. My server was also the bartender and I was impressed by her ability to successfully cover both stations. I'm not being snarky. I asked for her recommendation (as a first-time diner with a tricky stomach) and she steered me to the combo plate with no white bread. To pair with it, I got a local cider (Urban Tree Classic).\\n\\nYou can tell Fox Bros is popular. The prices are... high for the amount of food you get. This is where I *will* pull the 'I live in TN' card. A combo bbq plate should not be $18. Not in the south. It shouldn't. Don't @ me. But, I'd committed so I paid... but I wasn't happy about it. The combo came with two meats and two sides. I got the pulled pork and the cheddar sausage for my meats. Trying to optimize my dollar, I went with the brisket chili and cole slaw for sides. The tried both meats pre-sauce and I liked them, favoring the sausage more. The addition of the sauce elevated the meat and topping them with cole slaw (#tn) made it perfect. I was a little bummed about the amount of pulled pork but, I figured, the kitchen was doing my heart a favor. The brisket chili was a nice surprise. The chili was seasoned (although I did add hot sauce) and the brisket was the star of the dish, rather than a hidden extra.\\n\\nI enjoyed my meal and was satisfied (if not stuffed). I can't say that it changed my life but FB is solid. I don't know that I would wait hours for the stuff but stopping in during the off hours... not a bad idea. Just be ready for some tourist-focused sticker shock.

He further proved my point when he came back and mixed up everyone's drinks and couldn't remember who was drinking what, placing wrong drinks in front of wrong guests.

The portabello bbq sandwich is incredible. \\n\\nIf you want to impress your out of town guest: bring them here for the food.\\n\\nDownside: parking and burned down building. If you're meeting a group here, do yourself a favor and go in one car. Parking is extremely limited. The restaurant burned half down a few months ago and they  have this horrible cheap tent propped up with cafeteria type wooden tables.

It's a little upscale with some prime seafood dishes (Hogs and Scallops, lobster and shrimp crepe) as well as their own take on classics like bagel & lox or waffles & lox. The latter is one of my faves! Their lox is really good, better than any other lox in the city. \\n\\nOther standouts are their poutine dishes, which can optionally be subbed with 1/2 spinach or arugula if you want to lighten the calories. Another good option is the Threesome which gives you a bit of everything (egg, choice of protein like blueberry sausage, and choice of carb like French toast, pancake or waffle). \\n\\nSome items are limited quantities so get their early in order to try it. \\n\\nPro-tip: grab a to-go cup to take your coffee with you!"},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Goodness lord, the line!!!\\n\\nCame here 45min to closing and found out from some of the locals that typical line is +3 hours.

Definitely some stuff you can't find anywhere else. \\n\\nI went in to pick up some lox. The Norwegian was priced at $23/lb which isn't that unreasonable. The packaged stuff is $8 for 3oz, so I definitely got the better deal. It was fresh and delicious, I would definitely come back for this. \\n\\nI also got the beef knish and the sweet kugel. The sweet kugel was good, but I didn't really appreciate the huge chunks of canned peaches. For $8 I want more of the kugel and less of the processed fruit. The knish were good.

I got the fries very quickly, but the sandwich took a while, and by the time I got it the fries weren't hot anymore. The fries were well seasoned, but terribly soggy, and some weren't cooked through--it was clear they had been single- rather than double-fried. How can you get something that easy so wrong? And while the flavors of the BBQ seitan were good, the texture of the seitan was unappealingly chewy (I've eaten a lot of seitan--good seitan has a satisfying, meaty chew, but that wasn't the case here), the tomatoes were nearly white, and the bread was dry and bland. \\n\\nAnd while I love and support their use of environmentally friendly disposables, it's not worth it to do so if the items don't do what they're intended to; since I was getting my lunch to go, I tried to take a cup of ketchup with me, but when I put enough pressure on the lid to try to close it, the cup collapsed in on itself.

To this day, I have always enjoyed the few Austrian wines I tried, and was glad to find another on the menu at A&H. \\n\\nFor entrees we ordered the smoked artic char, yellow fin tuna crudo, pork belly, broccoli and grilled octopus. I don't remember if I ever loved every dish so much at a restaurant. Everything was amazing and creatively assembled (who would've thought of veal with rare tuna, or butternut squash hummus with broccoli?). The place definitely deserves an A for innovations. My only suggestion would be for the employees to consider the timing when bringing out the food. I completely understand the dishes come out as they were made, but had we not ordered the octopus, the broccoli would've been our last dish after we finished the fish and the pork.

The line wasn't too long and we had about a half hour before boarding so we decided to give it a try. \\n\\nOrdering the food was the first indicator that we might have a problem. We ordered a BBQ chicken pizza and an iced matcha. The cashier thought we ordered a vegetarian pizza and started to ring us up for that, and we corrected her. I ordered the iced matcha and she seemed confused and turned to someone else as if surprised at what matcha was. Perhaps she wasn't trained properly on the menu offerings? Anyway, we completed the order and were given a buzzer told to go to one side to wait for the drink and other side for the pizza. I waited at least 10 minutes for my drink and I saw the same cashier use the match powder and start to make a hot matcha. I assumed someone else could have ordered one, but nobody claimed it. So I told the girl I ordered a hot one, and she seemed frustrated and annoyed and repeated \\"Oh you ordered iced?\\". I told her forget it cause I was worried the plane was starting to board. \\n\\nWe were also still waiting for the pizza. I went to the gate and hubby waited for the pizza. It was another 15 minutes before the pizza was done. So overall it was about 1/2 hour wait and they got our order wrong. Luckily the pizza was tasty and we ate on the plane before takeoff. The hot matcha was not very good and really I didn't want a hot drink when I already was feeling warm.\\n\\nI think the place might be new and they still need to work out some kinks. I suggest better training for their staff on the menu items. Maybe turn down the volume of the music, as that might be part of the problem why they got the order wrong. Ask for the customer's name so that the drinks are more easily identifiable. I could see issues with 2 people ordering the same drink and people not getting their items in the same order as when they put the order in. I paid with credit card and it asks for email or text of receipt and I was rushing so I asked for neither. So what proof did I have that I ordered something, or even what I ordered?

So we made our reservation before we even left home. We looked at pictures of the food, read reviews and skipped lunch so we would be ready!  We loved it!  The ambiance is fabulous. We got there early and it was very quiet. As more people arrived, there was more chatter but nothing annoying. Everyone seemed to be having a good time and many were repeat customers and were enthusiastically greeted by employees. The servers were so nice and ours, Keith, was excellent - cheerful and very efficient. The food did not disappoint. We had crawfish and crab bisque for appetizers and stuffed salmon for the entree. Amazing!  We splurged and shared the triple dessert plate. My goodness. It was like three full desserts!  Creme Br√ªl√©e, mixed berry cobbler with ice cream, and chocolate truffle cake with whipped cream and raspberry coulee. (See pic) I am so glad we parked half a mile away.

I was intrigued by the pictures and menu, and specifically asked for a seat in the lounge. While the rest of the restaurant has a simple aesthetic, the lounge is more themed and fun, perfect for our night together.\\n\\nThe food here was delicious. I believe the menu is seasonal, but we ordered the alligator meatballs, mussels, chicken wings, short rib and dumplings, and of course dessert and drinks. I very much recommend the meatballs, mussels, and beignets, but everything was very good. \\n\\nI am an adventurous eater but have never been to New Orleans, and had never had alligator OR beignets before, so I was very excited to try new things! The meatballs were fantastic, and it really does taste like chicken. But also not. The mussels were perfect, and as usual the broth is the best part! Ask for a spoon so you don't miss out. The short rib was very rich and homey tasting. Quite honestly, the chicken wings were my least favorite and a tad disappointing. Because they focus on southern food I expected the chicken to be phenomenal, but it was just good. Definitely cooked properly, but I just expected more in the seasoning and coating. The dessert is a MUST. We ordered soft serve with our beignets which was the right move. I have nothing to compare the beignets to but I absolutely loved them. The soft serve is amazing because they have creative flavors but it isn't overly sweet. \\n\\nWe had a perfect meal together. Food was amazing, server was great, and although it is a tapas place the portions were decent.

After a short perusal of the menu, we decided to start with the nachos. I was pleasantly surprised with how tasty they were. The chips could have used less time in the fryer and more time drying because some were still super greasy, but other than that...there was a healthy dose of chili, cheese, tomatoes, jalapenos and salsa. Yum. Plus, they spread the nachos thin so you don't have a bunch of naked nachos at the bottom of the pile. Good start.\\n\\nAfter a half an hour of nacho digesting, we put in a couple entree orders. JT went for a burger with mushrooms and caramelized onions and I went the steak tips direction. I ordered medium, he ordered medium rare. My steak tips came out medium rare and he got a medium burger - not a huge deal,  but I couldn't really eat my steak tips (I swear a couple were moo'ing). I ate what I could of them and stuck with the sides (good mashed and yummy slaw). The seasoning/sauce on the steaktips was very tasty - so that is a plus! \\n\\nAll in all, it wasn't a bad experience. I really hope that this past Sunday was unusual for them because with only a handful of patrons they definitely weren't going to turn a profit.

Pulled pork sandwich was great too. I must mention that all 3 sides (potato salad, cole slaw and pinto beans) were surprisingly delicious! For the 2 of us, we got 1 lb of brisket (1/2 lean, 1/2 with some fat), 1 lb of pork ribs (approx 1/2 rack), 1 pulled pork sandwich, 1 each of the small sides + pecan pie.

Aria, it was great, but I didn't get addicted to it.\\n\\nParking is sufficient, and the location was easy to find. The interior design was intimate and nice. The restaurant is a house basically, but a large house. The bathrooms were clean and the service was nice. I don't think it can hold large parties on a weekend because it fits about 80 to 90 at best. \\n\\nAppetizers:\\nTwelve Hour Roasted Vidalia Onion Soup was a good soup, but after half way, it gets old. I think two people should just share the soup because is just so much a person can handle the rich flavor assisted by the white truffle oil. The onion was not overpowering, but the soup had a balance between cream and slight sweetness to it. It's a creamy soup with a good consistency, but should be enjoyed in small amounts. Overall, I recommend getting this soup. \\n\\nSeared Hudson Valley Foie Gras is the typical Foie Gras. Don't let the waiters fool you when they recommend it. The waiters will tell you it's the best Foie Gras in the state, but it's not. It's your typical Foie Gras, and the only reason the waiters want you to get it is because it's the most expensive appetizer on the menu. They want to jack up your bill to get more tips. It's not worth the money. \\n\\nCrisped Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes is something you should get. You get two large crab cakes with a napa salad in the middle. The balance between the warm and crispy cake goes very well with the napa salad. The salad provides a fresh cool texture to the dish, and the walnuts add that extra crispy and crunch flavor to it. The apple adds the hint of sweet to the overall dish. This appetizer is a very well thought out appetizer. \\n\\nEntree:\\nCenter Cut Corn Fed Angus Beef Filet Mignon came out well when I asked for medium. For me, if I am paying $40 for a steak like this, it needs to come out perfect from the beginning. It was not a huge mistake, but as a culinary chef who works in a restaurant that charges $40 for a steak, then it has to come out perfect. The restaurant was nice enough to take it back and refire another steak for me while giving me a complimentary salad, which was crap. Don't get a salad here. When the filet came out again, it was to my satisfaction. The meat was juicy in the middle with the perfect coloring. \\n\\nPan Seared New Bedford Jumbo Scallops are great. They were cooked fine, and were a little crispy on the outside. It's mainly because the scallops are very thick, and it can't be helped to be a little crispy on the outside. The bacon parm risotto was great and the scallop added well to the risotto. I wasn't quite sure if the dish's main star was the scallop or the risotto because the risotto could be eaten without the scallops, and at the same time, I didn't feel like there was not enough scallops to call it a scallop dish.  \\n\\nDessert:\\nFresh Sorbets... just get it. It's a sample of sorbets and you can't go wrong with it. \\n\\nYes, my bill came out to be $160 for two people without tip.

D.'s been going for years and tells me that the staff at the Lamar location have been working there for years, so they seem to be doing labor right, in addition to their tasty foods. \\n- potentially free coffee! Another bonus is that they stop brewing coffee around 11, so if you order a coffee once they're stopped making more, they'll generally give it to you !gratis!\\n\\nThe bads: \\n-the potatoes are just odd. They're more of a puree than home fries, and it takes a connoisseur of the root vegetable to appreciate that kind of mouth feel. Avoid it. \\n-they often sell out of specials. We went last Saturday and the delibelly was already gone by 2pm If you want something popular, get there early."},{"name":"Pirates Dinner Adventure","address":"6400 Carrier Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"As far as pirate themed dinner shows go, this was my least favorite.

We have lots of friends  when dad's buying.  Saturday night about 6:45 and we timed it just right. Wyeth, the owner, is behind the counter organizing sees us and immediately comes over to renew and talk about old times and the restaurant.  It's come a long way and we can't wait to tear into friend chicken, and pulled this and that, and ribs. Youngest is late as usual as she is directionally challenged still after 5 months in Boston.  Beers flow and I really like the wheat UFO on draft but screw the lemon.  Out comes a sampling of his latest creation Buffalo wings in a creamy tart blue cheese and hot wing sauce.  7 to 8 on the hot scale for most and a freakin' 9 for me. Lips were numb for 90 minutes and a didn't know beer was touching my mouth until most of it poured down the front of my fleece.  Onto the fried mac balls.  Liz, the bride, ate so many I thought she wouldn't do the pulled chicken.  She dips hers in ketchup!!   Fried wings were beyond crispy and super golden brown and juicy.  Everyone seems to have different tastes in corn bread this is my absolute favorite.....moist, sweet and corny.  Out come my baby backs 1/3 portion and I could only eat two. They came with mashed which were creamy and with a nicely salted gravy.  I love baked beans and the smokey taste and chocolate color just make these different among all others.  We had more than enough to take home and I finished the corn bread for breakfast.  \\n\\nSoul Fire got crowded about 7:30 and really filled up but I noticed the tables turn quick as the food comes out real fast and the service is efficient.  On the service end, Wyeth has changed his approach from ordering at the register to table side servers.

He makes a good steak and cheese. His onion rings are good solid rings not \\"strings\\"; the fries are like McDonald's fries. \\n\\nWhat makes Mimi stand out are the following items:\\n\\n1) Salads. Nothing spectacular about the veggies themselves (fresh every day, but be warned the tomatoes are not always great), but add a GIANT scoop of tuna to one and now you have a salad and a sandwich (he gives you a pita) for 5 bucks (and the salad isn't a puny little side salad). For a little more $, you can get really good grilled chicken or steak. The Greek Salad is excellent (tons of feta), and so is his house greek dressing\\n\\n2) Roast Beef Sandwiches. This is Mimi's signature special. Again, fresh cooked every day by the man himself, very delicious. It's pretty rare though so if that's not your bag you might want to try something else. If you do get it GET THE SAUCE! He makes the best barbecue sauce I've ever had, with just the right amount of spice to it.\\n\\n3) Haddock dinner. Essentially fish and chips (though I believe he throws in a few onion rings, I can't recall), unlike so many other places of this ilk, Mimi takes a fresh piece of fish, breads it and puts it in the fryer.

The kitchen was busy that night, the chefs in the kitchen were making the tacos, guacamole, cheese fondue, repeatedly. \\n\\nWe were there for a light snack, so we shared the red snapper ceviche. Of course, we also had to order from their extensive mezcal selection. Order in a single or double serving, but remember, it's for sipping, not shooting! \\n\\nThe red snapper ceviche was fresh and had a good balance of lime juice, tomato, cilantro and onion. This was the perfect sharing plate to have with our mezcal. \\n\\nIt's a casual place to grab a taco or two, the only thing that's missing from their menu is some horchata!\\n\\n9/100; The Yelp 100 Challenge"},{"name":"Boston Shawarma","address":"315 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I ordered a mixed shawarma (lamb + chicken) with falafel.

It's just consistently great and they don't sit around resting on their laurels.  They work hard reinventing itself for seasonal sides and specials without taking away their menu classics every Portlander knows and loves. \\n\\nAs a vegetarian places like this can be a little daunting, and it's easy to assume you might get sort of ripped off.  Who among us hasn't sat at the table and ordered the ubiquitous \\"house made veggie burger\\" that turns to mush and you're out $15.  Enter the Screen Door Plate.......which is at this point the \\"insert expletive here\\" Ninja of Southern soul food in Portland.  You get a choice of 3 sides, including any of the seasonal specials menu plus a nice chunk of cornbread......the portion sizes are great.  You cannot leave hungry.\\n\\nOn this visit I had the mac n' cheese(some of the absolute best in town), a seasonal warm pear and pecan salad, and the most amazing brussel sprouts I've ever eaten in savory butter with hedgehog mushrooms which are my new favorite thing.  They put a lot of love in the food here......and while it takes awhile for the food to arrive at least they aren't getting sloppy and cutting corners. The mark of consistency right?\\n\\nOnly place is looses a bit of steam is that if you order off the seasonal menu for an appetizer or a side it's the same portion size as the one you include in the Screen Door Plate.  We had a richly done bread pudding in manchego cheese sauce which was a little underwhelming, and spending $8.25 for something to share with 3 of us in a tiny soup cup just wasn't worth it.  Some things like that need to be thought out a little better.  We also waited over an hour for dinner even though we were there for first sitting right when they opened which was pretty excessive.  To be fair I think our waiter knew and got us a plate of hushpuppies which was very nice and we didn't have to say anything.  The mark of an excellent wait staff right?\\n\\nOverall, just one of the most solid well rounded places to eat in the city.........one of the places I recommend to people most.

The stuffed halibut only had a few chunks of crab, which was overwhelmed by the goat & cream cheese, onion & dill w/ parmesan cream sauce. The halibut was modestly sized, tender, and flaky. The halibut, chinook, and burrata linguine included sauteed onions, red peppers, kale, burrata, in a white wine butter sauce. The white wine butter sauce fell flat for me because it was broken rather than creamy. This made every bite of the linguine seem bland unless it included the burrata.\\n\\nI would recommend they get bigger tables for two people since we were seated at a corner with a small wooden square table.

Both are Portland institutions that aren't for everyone. Chances of a successful outcome can be increased by preparation. For the marathon, this means training, having the right gear, and a running partner to encourage you during the long day.  For Screen Door, it means arriving when (or slightly before) they open at 9:00a on weekends. Come prepared for a wait - I brought an iPod, book, umbrella, warm coat and food. Yes, I brought food to wait in line for a restaurant! And the most important part, friends. \\n\\nJust like the marathon, if you are a larger group, you will have ones and twos pass you along the way. They take reservations for 6 or more only for the first seating, otherwise, the larger the group, the longer the wait. I curse the quick people in my head in both cases.\\n\\nThey are prepared for a crowd and try to make the 'ordeal' pleasant.

The chicken was crispy and spicy on the outside, and moist and tender on the inside. Very good flavor.

The sun dipped a bit and we were constantly shifting to avoid having the sun in our eyes, but it was otherwise a lovely patio.\\n\\nAlthough they weren't on the menu, my boyfriend remembered that they used to have mussels in a white wine-garlic sauce that were to die for.

We also ordered the baba ghanoush, since I looooove a good baba ghanoush, and a couple of glasses of white wine.\\n\\nThe mussels were good, but for me, the best part was the crusty bread to sop up the sauce! We still had a lot of sauce leftover after the mussels and baguette, so our waitress offered to bring us a second baguette. We'd been considering getting the cheese plate, but happily took a second baguette and finished off the mussels properly instead! \\n\\nThe baba ghanoush was not at all impressive. It was chunky, not smokey, and just kind of all-around underwhelming. The pita bread wasn't warmed, which also surprised me a little. I definitely wouldn't bother ordering this dish again.\\n\\nOur waitress was very sweet and friendly, kept the waters filled, the wine pouring, and offered a second baguette without us having to ask. No complaints on the service. Tables were cleared quickly and efficiently and all of the waitstaff seemed to be on par. \\n\\nThere was a gentleman panhandling at the edges of the patio, aggressively sticking his hand in faces as people walked by. I suspect a staff member of Apres Diem called the cops, as he disappeared after a few minutes and we saw two cops walking around the perimeter shortly after. To be fair, this is Midtown, so it's to be expected, unfortunately. It seemed to be handled quickly and quietly, which is always appreciated.\\n\\nDue to the vast difference in quality of our dishes, I would say this is a solid three-star, with the possibility of a fourth star if my next visit impresses me a bit more.

The first indication of a change was the empty parking lot.  There was an old dear 'manning' the register and taking the orders.  They have draft beer now, which the order-taker couldn't really master.  Oh, and the tiny plastic cups of draft beer are actually more expensive than the bottled beer.  I didn't notice that until after the order was finished.  I don't think the management understand how wrong that is.  The refrigerator for the beer is probably an improvement on the old method of icing the beer down and then forgetting about it until there's no ice left.  As I said, no one else was there, but it did take a while to get the food.  Then, of course, the guac was missing.  With flautas you get your choice of guac, cheese, or sour cream, so if you choose only one of these, it isn't an 'extra', but the old dear did ask if it was a special request, the guac.  After that was sorted out, she mentioned the kitchen staff might just be too tired to remember the 'extras'.  Oh, and one tortilla cost 40 cents.  I can see where this is headed.  I dare not reveal the total cost of flautas, one chicken taco, one fajita taco, and two small draft beers.  It's really too sad we didn't go to Mana's in San Marcos, as usual.\\n\\nI should add that there were plenty of staff there, including an oblivious manager and ineffectual assistant manager.

We ordered one of those pre-fixed meals and like so many other restaurants in Chinatown these days, much of the food is deep fried, vs. saut√©ed or stir-fried.  It's quicker to deep-fry but food just loses that certain quality you get when a dish is patiently and carefully prepared. Aside from that, the service was very good from the wait staff.  Now as for the short, chubby, 50-60+ year-old vest-wearing dud (yeah, DUD) upstairs that took care of our parking passes -- what a complete A$$hole!!  Mean and rude and disgusting.

Ribs are fall off the bone tender, more sweet than vinegar base, so if vinegar or dry rub is your thing, you likely wont enjoy fat Matt's\\n\\nThe first evening, the chicken was a breast and without the sauce it would have been inedible.  The second go-round it was a leg and a thigh, and those pieces again were fall off the bone tender and I needed zero sauce.  \\n\\nTheir baked beans were kinda amazing and didn't need any dressing up like certain BBQ places i've dined at.

After hearing great things, I decided to check out your Kendall Sq location for breakfast. I walked in and had no idea where to go.

Drinks were tasty, but the food and service was incredibly disappointing. Tavern in the Square nearby is probably a better bet.\\n\\nTHE SPACE: \\n The bar circles around the entire center of the front of the restaurant, which makes it a great place for group drinks.\\n\\nDRINKS:\\nThe drink menu is extensive. The menu is split up by spirit and the cocktails are split up the same way. There're around four cocktails per spirit, which makes it really easy to choose something tasty.\\n\\nFOOD: \\n'Fancy' bar food. The menu has some salad options, but it's mostly fried/meaty options. We got the local cheese plate, pork belly and fried scallops, fried cheesesteak dumplings, mozzarella flatbread, and the maple chili duck wings. \\n\\nThe only good thing we enjoyed was the duck wings -- tasty and sweet, and the meat fell off the bone. The local cheese plate was slim pickings, the scallops didn't taste fresh, the dumplings were mostly dough, and the $13 flatbread looked like and tasted like Ellio's pizza.\\n\\nSERVICE:\\nThe cherry on top of our experience was the incredibly off-putting hostess. We came on a Thursday and showed up 30 minutes early for our reservation. We asked if a waitress at the front stand if it was possible to sit, and if not, we could hang out at the bar. The hostess came over and, without greeting, told us, 'You can't be here. You have to come at your reservation time.\\" Confused, we wandered around and came back five minutes before our reservation. Upon our return she deadpans, \\"I told you to come later. You have to wait.\\" When our table was 'ready', she brought us to our table, which actually wasn't ready so we awkwardly stood in the way of everybody as we waited. Zero smiles -- so confusing for a position in hospitality.\\n\\nOverall, I'd only come here for drinks -- both for the cocktails only and to avoid the front of the restaurant."},{"name":"Dirty Frank's Hot Dog Palace","address":"248 S 4th St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"First and last time here.\\nThe coleslaw is bland, the hot dog has very little flavor either.\\nThe onion rings have enough grease dripping out of them to lube a semi truck for a year!\\nThe drink is good, though!"},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Austin's obsession with standing in line for food continues with Ramen Tatsu-Ya. And yes, it's probably worth your time to wait in that line if you love Ramen.\\n\\nThis was my first time to go back after the soft opening last summer, and while I've had my fill of ramen at other places around town in the months since, I have to say, for a traditional bowl of ramen, you really can't beat Ramen Tatsu-Ya. The broth is absolutely amazing. \\n\\nWe tried both the Mi-So-Not and the Tonkotsu Sho-Yu, along with the sweet and sour Yodas (Brussels sprouts) and found both to be nothing short of incredible. To describe the broth, I have to use the term body, because that's what really stands out here. There's just an incredible heft to it that's silky, rich and creamy all at the same time. The miso adds just a hint of lightness while the Tonkotsu Sho-Yu adds a bit of a dark depth.\\n\\nI added a corn on the bomb to mine which is corn kernels in a scoop of butter. I added about half of that to my soup for the perfect amount.\\n\\nThe other thing that impressed me was the way this place was like a well-oiled machine. It seems they took the feedback from the soft opening, and all along the way, and did a great job of making this place hum. The servers running ramen to the dining area moved with ninja precision and swiftness. The guy running the line of people was observant and moved it along with the efficiency of a Swiss watch maker.\\n\\nThe only negative about Ramen Tatsu-Ya is the line. While it did move quickly, I'm tired of waiting in line for things. This city is obsessed with lines. It's not something I'll do at dinner time in the warmer months because waiting in 100+ weather for hot soup in August sounds about as appealing as seeing the entire 50 Shades of Gray series on your mom's bedside table.

Franklin is a barbecue aficionado's paradise, the Mecca of brisket and the Holy Grail of meats. All the hype surrounding this renowned establishment is real and not one bit of it is inflated. Franklin is hands down the best barbecue I've ever had and I'd be hard pressed to find anything better. \\n\\nMy personal Franklin's experience began on a stormy Wednesday morning. We had just gotten in from the airport at 5:30 am and the sky was dark and streaked with bright flashes of lightning. Seeing that the weather was so terrible, we decided to go a little later at 7:30 am, hoping that the unfortunate (or was it fortunate for us?) weather would deter most people. When we got there, we were the 4th group in line. \\n\\nAnd this is when the waiting game began, an essential part of the Franklin experience. If you didn't bring camp chairs, Franklin provides a limited amount, so get there early if you want one. Other than that, the 3.5 hour wait wasn't all that bad. If you've ever been tailgating, this was very similar. You chat and meet new people, bring your dog, all the while, the tantalizing smoke of barbecued meats rises out the back of Franklin. At some point, someone will come out and get an estimate of how many pounds of food you're ordering before disappearing back inside. If you need to go to the restroom, you are free to walk inside and use it. I discovered this was an excellent opportunity to check out and buy some of the shirts and hats they were selling. If you need some caffeine, Legend Coffee runs a fantastic coffee trailer out in the Franklin parking lot. If you care for a beer, someone from Franklin will come around selling them. As opening hour approaches, you can feel the excitement swell among the crowd as people start getting up and ready. \\n\\nWe were among the first group to enter. I ordered 3 lbs of brisket, 3 lbs of pork ribs, 1/2 lb each of pulled pork and turkey, 1 lb of sausage, 1 of each side (coleslaw, beans, potato salad) and 1 of each pie (bourbon banana, pecan, key lime and lemon chess). All of this fed 7 people with leftovers for the next day. \\n\\nThe brisket was to die for. It was firm enough to cut in slices but so tender that it threatens to pull apart when you pick at it with a fork. The brisket almost melts in your mouth and it bursts with the concentrated juices and flavors of a super slow-cooked meat. It starts out with a nutty brown color in the middle and fades to a cranberry-red border before ending in a black crust stub led with pepper. The rich and fatty goodness of the brisket makes it hard to eat more than a few slices. Eat it while it is hot, though it was still superb when we had it again for dinner. Simply put, words cannot even attempt to describe how transcendent of an experience it was. \\n\\nThe meat pulled easily off the bones of the ribs and the sausages were juicy and snappy. None of these meats required any sauce, though it is available if you need it. The pies were catered from Cake and Spoon and the perfect sweet dessert to polish off your lunch. \\n\\nFranklin Barbecue is the stuff of legends and I can't wait to come back to Austin."},{"name":"Noori's Grill","address":"2525 W Anderson Ln, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Good to have an restaurant with Afghan cuisine in the Austin market!

Still, I had to flag someone down and kindly ask if she knew who our server was.  As it turned out she was our server, and 'no one told her' we were there.  \\n\\nWe waited probably another 10-15 minutes for our drinks and even longer for our appetizers.\\n\\nWe ordered our second round of drinks beforehand, and they still came 15 minutes later well after we were ready for them.\\n\\nBy now we had finished our apps, and our drinks and kindly piled up all the dirty dishes at the end of the table.  Our waitress must have walked by 20 times empty handed before she took them away.\\n\\nMy girlfriends and I split dinners.  They didn't ask if we wanted the ground pepper, they didn't offer the customary parm cheese, they didn't even have a spoon with the saucy pasta dish.  Not to mention they were short one side plate.  It legit took 10 minutes to get another side plate so we could all begin eating.\\n\\nShe never asked if we need anything else, or came back to check on us.\\n\\n\\n.........HERES WHERE IT GETS GOOD.........\\n\\n\\nBy this point I was pretty upset.  I used to be a waitress, and my tolerance for bad service is high, but this couldn't get any worse.  At least not until after I spoke to the manager.  Yes, I did. I actually spoke to the manager.  Wait until you hear what he had to say.\\n\\nHe brushed me off and told me a server had her period and I should understand.  Really?  What I understand is why my experience has been so aweful, the management is the problem.  I mean C'mon folks, in what world is that my business, my problem or appropriate during dinner?!?!?  I couldn't even believe my ears!\\n\\nI was so appalled by that mans response (and hair!) that i will *never* go back again.

Because they have the best taco toppings and shell combinations that you could ever dream of (The Ju-Ju for example, is basically a cheesy gordita crunch). \\nI haven't reviewed the downtown location yet, so I thought they deserved a shout-out.

In addition to the traditional grilled chicken, they feature the real difference maker: a rather rare turkey shawarma that is charbroiled with very flavorful Mediterranean marination instead their delicious laffa bread. While the $11.95 price is steep, it's well worth the burst of flavors in your mouth that no other shawarma in the area could give me. It's just good in the platter form as teaming it up with salad, hummus, falafel, and assorted veggies is a worthy $16 expenditure!  Their beef kebabs are tasty as well and as such, just about everything here tastes on point. Yes, prices are high in general but for an established Glatt Kosher certified spot in Brookline, it's hard to complain much.

It tasted really similar to La Barbecue. A tad above Salt Lick in terms of taste and texture, and way above Rudy's. \\n- Pork Ribs: I like them! Not really love them, but the first couple bites were super good. I love ribs personally, and have had them and made them in many ways. I definitely like what Franklin does with them, the pepper-coated outer crust was... I hate to say it, inferior to my experience with ribs at La Barbecue. I feel like there was flavor in the pepper and just more of it. Really wish I got to try the beef rib at Franklin though!\\n- Sausage: Really unique! I don't think I've had sausage like this before. I really can't pinpoint what's so special about it, but it's interesting. Tasty and incredibly juicy.\\n- BBQ sauces: Very similar to La Barbecue. There was a robust, smoky dark sauce, a sweet thick sauce, and runny vinegar-y sauce.\\n- Beans: Tasted like pretty much every other baked beans out there, though less sweet.\\n\\nOverall, I am glad to have had the experience, and I can definitely appreciate the dedication Franklin BBQ puts in their craft.

COOL, it's whatever. However, we were finally seated, and I swear it took like 20 minutes to order. I don't think I'm hella needy but I felt a little ignored.

It sucked more when again, people seated after me were getting their orders and they're ordering the same thing.\\n\\nFood finally came. My boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffles and let me tell you, all our troubles sort of went away when I had a piece of that bomb ass chicken. So tender and crunchy at the same time (better than Roscoe's in LA!). A large portion to boot. The sweet potato waffle was alright. I ordered a bunch of sides: mac n cheese, gumbo, and the cornbread. I was so full off the mac and cheese I wasn't able to finish the cornbread. But the gumbo and the cornbread I could've probably done without. \\n\\nI think if I didn't experience such sucky service I wouldn't have been so salty about eating here. If you are gonna eat here, definitely get the chicken and waffles. That one dish is enough for two people to share lol. However, to the wait staff, please be nice and attentive to all your customers.

I didn't see any dedicated parking so it felt like a free for all in the nearby neighborhood or along the main street. We were lucky to find some considering the neighborhood was packed with a mix of residents and non-residents looking for parking. The outside waiting area had some benches to sit (you can also sit inside as well). \\n\\nInterior = 5/5\\nThere is outdoor and indoor seating. The outdoor seating is nice on a Fall day with a light breeze, you can see the leaves fall which is nice. We were seated outside which was nice and it felt more spacious than inside which look more bustling with movement.\\n\\nService = 5/5\\nOur waiter was super friendly and giving us the run down in the menu. He kept us laughing and just enjoying our meal. The food took a little time but that's probably because we were near the tail end of the brunch hour before they closed for the afternoon. We kept ourselves occupied with our drinks and appetizer that we didn't mind too much about the food - we did ask him on the status of it which he was quick to check.\\n\\nOrder = 4/5\\n\\nFried okra: 5/5\\nNever had fried okra so we had to get this. We initially thought it would be whole pieces deep fried, so we were surprised when it came cut up and deep fried. This made it easier to share, as well as made sure each piece had a nice crunch. The texture on the crunch went well with the squishy interior of the okra. I also recommend using the sauce they give, which was an aioli. I think we even asked for another sauce because we ate all of it.\\n\\nPrailine Bacon: 4/5\\nI usually don't like nuts of any kind but this was yummy. This item is a big deal here so we had to try it. It is a sweet salty kind if thing, which is always a good mix. We found some of our bacon hard to chew at points, and other times nicely crunchy. I'm guessing it's because of the glaze with the prailine. Either way we liked it because it was different and had a nice flavor mix.\\n\\nChicken and waffles: 4/5\\nThese waffles were a bit different because...they are sweet potato! I liked having this variation. It was a tasty difference from the usual waffle we are used to. You only get one, but it's pretty big and will keep you happy. The chicken was tasty, just a tad bit on the dry side. The portion size was perfect considering we also got other options. You do have the option on how many pieces of chicken you want, so that is a plus.\\n\\nGranny apple: 5/5 (totally forgot the name when I left) \\nThis drink was good! It was one of the specials and I was happy our waiter recommended it. Ugh, they should make it a keeper. It had a nice tart taste because of the apple and they had a sprinkle of cinnamon on top. It was just like an apple pie, and I'm not a usual fan of pie. It is an alcoholic drink!\\n\\nMimosa: 5/5\\nI had ordered a small, so when my order came out as a large I wasn't complaining (they even let me just keep it - score!). It was a nice compliment to all the food. Not overly on the alcohol or too much on orange juice, so I was happy.\\n\\nOverall = 4/5\\nThis was great introduction into Portland and the brunch lifestyle.

On the good side hummus, tabouleh, caesar salad and Red Snapper were all very nice.  However, the Kefta meat was grey, chewey and did not taste fresh.

I also thought it would be a place that catered to families. We made our reservation several weeks before Mother's Day. We all arrived well before our reservation time, and checked in. Waiting until the reserved time wasn't a problem, because there were plenty of places to sit on the porch. My husband got drinks for our group of 7. He was disappointed there wasn't any draft choices and got a bottled beer. He bought me a bloody mary. It was completely underwhelming, and bland. Not bad, but not good. Just expensive. When we were seated well past our reservation time, my kids were definitely getting cranky and hungry. I was completely disappointed with our table. They set up a makeshift table in the staging area next to the kitchen. It was noisy, and servers were coming in and out. The floor was slippery with flour, and I was worried that my mother, who has mobility issues and walks with a cane would fall. I told our server and the host that this seat didn't work for us, asking if we could have a seat outside. The host asked me if I put something in the notes section of the reservation, which I did not. The server came back and told us they didn't have a table. I told him this was unacceptable. The manager came and spoke with me and found us a table. In another 10 minutes we were seated. By this time, it was late in the service. The strawberry crepes were sold out, which was disappointing because two of us wanted to order this dish. (I hope they were out of strawberries, because crepes are easy to make.) The biscuits were good, but unevenly cooked. The gravy was fantastic. The cinnamon roll was great, but honestly, I can get something similar at the mall for a third of the price. The rest of the food was completely forgetful. The bacon was overcooked. When a teenage boy who likes bacon doesn't finish his serving, you know something was wrong. The schnitzel was greasy and unevenly cooked. I thought this was a place that knew how to cook pork? I could have cooked everything we ate at home and made it delicious at a fraction of the cost, but I wanted to treat my mom for Mother's Day. The worst example of how not to treat customers came when we were leaving. We walked my parents to the valet stand. The valet driver located the car, which was a driveway away, and waved my father over, instead of bringing the car to him. My father was standing right next to my mother, who walks with a cane. My polite dad, went and got his car and pulled it into the drive himself, so my mom didn't have to walk far. Terrible. The entire staff seemed completely harried and tired. I know Mother's Day is a busy day. But its also a day to make money and win over first time visitors. They made their money off of us this time, but we won't be back. I wanted to like Revival, and was hoping it would be a wonderful family spot for brunch and dinner. But after that experience, I wasn't impressed. The very nice manager who found us a different table was the only bright spot. Revival just didn't seem to have much character or Southern hospitality yesterday."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Supposedly the best ramen in Austin.

Many folks (both local and national) have been anointing the Secret Burger one of the best burgers in the country, never mind locally. I'm always wary of such proclamations, for obvious reasons, and try to avoid the hype machine as best I can before heading into a place. How good could it really be? I've eaten my way through a great (and uncomfortable) amount of burgers over the last few years. Many have wowed me, some have disappointed, and most have been just fine and dandy. I dined at Alden and Harlow on a busy Thursday night, knowing full well that a burger would be in my future. They mention on the menu that there is only a limited number of burgers available on a nightly basis (rumor has it about three dozen, with a few withheld for late-night service) although I have yet to hear of many, if any people getting rejected because they had run out. To me it feels like a cooler Craigie on Main approach: the burger is there for the taking but clearly there are a bunch of other fine dishes the chef would rather have you enjoy; it's not hidden even if it is limited. I certainly wouldn't complain if Alden just turned into a full-blown burger joint, but something tells me chef Scelfo wants to flex his culinary muscles a little more than just serving up our most beloved sandwich.\\n\\nLet's cut to chase here: this might be the best burger I've had in the Boston area and maybe anywhere. It is among (counting Craigie, Back Bay Social Club and Beacon Hill Bistro) the beefiest and straight-up most satisfying bun and beef combinations out there, without question. After eating the burger and dropping off a friend, I immediately had to go back that same night. The burger haunted me, even though we're only talking a 45 minute window here, and I couldn't get it out of my head. I had to know for sure. Was it as good as as I thought? The beef blend (brisket, short rib and beef plate) is unique, robust and expertly mastered like a fine steak. It tastes like nothing else out there in many ways, skipping the bells and whistles of some of the other top tiered patties and instead just focusing on the meat and the meat itself, and it is that good. Both burgers that night were cooked a perfect medium-rare, and the seasoning was nothing short of flawless. The burger is also very, very smokey. Something you'd often see with bacon, but not here, at least they won't tell you if that is the case. The smoked element is top secret, but it doesn't read very porky in my mind. My best guess (and a complete guess at that) is that they are incorporating smoked suet into the burger at some point, giving it even more fat and the smoke that really makes this burger stand out. It is as juicy as it ought to be and I literally have no complaints about it. A house-made bun, influenced by a Parker House roll, is very buttery (almost to the point of saturated) and flaky, yet sturdy enough to hold it all in place. It's a total game changer from all the crappy buns out there and left me scratching my head wondering why more places don't make their own buns. Probably a time, space and volume issue in most cases, but still, I wish it were more common.\\n\\nJoining the burger are a salted onions (salted so they take off some of the raw bite) and little gem lettuce combo that offers crunch like it wouldn't seem possible. This burger is crunchy, but surprisingly not from the the Cabot cheese tuile ( I liken it more to a frico). What should be a salty, crispy bomb of flavor ends up being chewy and more of a distraction than anything. I can't tell what's bringing it down, since I like the concept of a piece of crispy cheese, but it's the one element that is a slight miss. The flavor is still there, and I almost wonder if it would work better if it was placed right below the bun, as opposed to nestled under a pile of onions, lettuce and creamy sauce which I'm sure attributed to the sogginess, but then again, what the hell do I know. The creamy sauce is basically a Caesar meets Thousand Island kind of blend with aioli, ketchup, anchovy and pecorino among the players and it is straight-forward, well seasoned and a nice complement. Literally four thinly sliced pickles are on the side of the plate and I wish there was more of them. They are sharp and tasty but with so few I hardly see the point. On the first burger there are no pickles inside of the sandwich, but on round two there are one or two random pickle slices floating around. Chips in lieu of fries join the burger and they are warm, nicely seasoned and crispy. I always long for fries but these are worthy of the extraordinary burger.\\n\\nThe burger at Alden and Harlow (shockingly only $14) is divine. It is all about the beef in most cases, and while the beef blend is fatty and luscious and possibly the best I've ever had, the accent of the role players here is almost as important. A house-made bun, onions, lettuce and a well-rounded sauce are terrific complemen"},{"name":"Fox Bros.

The whole event was quite fantastic!\\n\\nThe food buffet was substantial and had lots of variety.  I will admit that I've eaten at Stubbs for dinner and thought they were pretty middle of the road, but this buffet was great!  Everything from migas, biscuits and home fries to brisket, cue'ed chicken, spinach lasagna, and nopalitos (those ain't green beans!).  Everything was tasty and several dishes were quite spicy.  They also have a build your own Bloody Mary bar (think you pay extra for the shot of Tito's and then go build it).  \\n\\nNow on to the show.  We saw the Silvertones who were great!  Just a word of warning (or for some good tidings) this ain't no ole timey folks singin up some gospel.  This was an all-out hand clappin, foot stompin, Sunday-go-ta-meetin-church.  There was alot of \\"Praise the Lords\\", \\"Jesus is in our midst\\", \\"Say no to the Devil\\".  So if you are uncomfortable with all that spirit, it's not for you.  For instance, I would never take my atheist Dad here, but my super religious Church of Christ Mom and Sis loved it (and yes, it was interesting growing up in that family, thanks for asking..).  Middle of the road me just loved the great music, the fantastic voices, and the entertaining dancing and passion (and prodigious sweating) of the lead singer.  \\n\\nI highly recommend bringin the 'rents here and it's very affordable as well ($19) compared to some other brunches in town.

The chicken and waffles were amazing! The chicken was so soft and tender but yet had the perfect ratio of batter, making the chicken crispy. The waffles were a little too dense but that's because it's made out of sweet potato! It had a strong cinnamon taste which complimented the savory chicken. \\n\\nThe egg Benedict's were fantastic as well. It came with grits which tasted like mash potatoes to me.

Out of those three, I would rank the sandwiches with #1 combination, #2 meatball, and #3 chicken. I think that the bread to meat ratio was a little off. The rolls are massive for the filling, but I honestly don't mind at all. I really like fresh baked bread. The bread is good quality. I do think that some of the chicken was a little dry, maybe a little pate or mayo could hide this better... Overall the Banh Mi Trio is a solid pick if you don't know what you want because there is a great variety. \\n\\nThe mini crepes were pretty yummyyyyy! I think that the idea is super cute. I really liked pouring the fish sauce over it while it was still hot. It totally made the whole store smell like fish sauce, but I love the smell!

No regrets whatsoever. I think we always look for a place that makes us feel like we're at a local backyard BBQ among friends and family. Fatt Matt's is just that, without the awkward cousins and nosy aunties. \\n\\nFM is packed during dinner. My friends and I arrived at 6:30 p.m. on a Thursday night to a half-packed joint. There is free parking in front of the \\"shack,\\" but its limited in size. Once we arrived, we were greeted by the staff and we waited in line to order at the counter. The woman at the counter is such a dear: She answered my questions and even sensed my dietary restrictions. She recommended the rum baked beans, and they were the best baked beans I've had. Flavorful, not too sweet, almost smokey, and the beans are not baked away (we can still see them). I also ordered the 1/4 bird, which was the perfect size for one person. The meat is moist, and does not have that rubbery taste that often comes with chicken meat. There is extra sauce provided on the side, but the meat is already well-coated in FM's sauce. The food is delivered to you at your table. Guests have the choice of sitting inside or outside in wooden booths painted in bright colors. \\n\\nMy friends shared a full slab of pork ribs, and they kept saying how much the bus ride and walk were worth it for the food. At under 30 dollars for a full slab of ribs, this was a great deal and, between our group of friends and the live blues music, a memory we will not forget. \\n\\nFatt Matt's is a true testimony to being back in the South!

I have never seen anything like it. I saw people bring their own lawn chairs to sit on and the restaurant handing out small sandwiches while everyone waited to get in the restaurant. Apparently, diners line up as early as 6 AM to be first in line to eat when the restaurant opens at 11 AM. Franklin's is only open for lunch, from 11 AM to when they are sold out, which it notes is usually between 2-3 PM. On the other hand, I did not get the full experience of Franklin's. I did not wait in the line. Instead, I took advantage of its pre-order option. It is a five pound minimum but well worth it. My friend and I took the barbecue meats to picnic tables at Zilker Park to eat. We had plenty of leftovers. Anticipating this end game, we brought cooler bags to bring it on the plane to go home with them. TSA checked the bags. However, the agent smelled it, checked that the contents moved like meat, and let me go on my way.\\n\\nIn terms of the actual barbecue, it is definitely the best barbecue I have eaten to date. The fatty brisket is the top item on the menu. It was so moist and absolutely the best brisket I have ever tasted. It was so tender that it fell apart when I tried to lift it with a fork. My second favorite meat at Franklin's was the pulled pork. As far as pulled pork goes, it was perfection: tender, shredded, and moist. The sausages were also exceptional. The meat in the links were tender and juicy. The skin was very crispy. Moreover, the flavor is phenomenal with a spicy kick to it. The ribs were also delicious. On the other hand, they were a dry rub. Although the flavor and meat were excellent, I prefer the moist meats. All the meats were so good that I did not even use the barbecue sauce much.\\n\\nAfter tasting Franklin's Barbecue, would I willingly wait in line for it? No. I will use the pre-order every time and figure out what to do with the leftovers afterwards. If there was no pre-order option, I would wait on line to eat it. It totally lives up to the hype.\\n\\nIf you are visiting and planning a trip to Austin and looking for recommendations, feel free to message me for my itinerary.

There have been several times where my friends and I were planning to have a second drink, but by the time the waiter or waitress came back, we had decided just to go home instead. \\n\\nAfter hours, this place can get a little sketchy. One night a group of us was there and there was some band playing. The lead singer kept referring to his past sexual experiences, and took off his shirt, practically performing a lapdance on one of the unwanting customers. We were really uncomfortable and left.\\n\\nWe usually go there to have a drink or two and some nachos, which at $10 are an average price, and fairly large (nothing compared to what you find in Boston). However, one night, a couple of friends were sharing the nachos, and when the chips ran out there was quite a good amount of topping (tomatoes, guac, sour cream) left. So they asked for a few more chips to finish it off. The waitress gladly brought over a little bag of maybe 5-7 more chips. A bunch of us all met our friends there, in total there were probably 6 of us all having a drink or two, or three, in the bar. When the check came, the original group of three realized that they had been charged $5 for the few extra chips (half the price of the original order of nachos). They asked the waitress about it, and said they didn't realize they were going to be charged for them, would she mind taking it off because they'd had the nachos many times before and never needed extra chips, etc etc. The waitress, very accommodating, simply mentioned that the manager would have to be the one to take it off the bill.\\n\\nSuddenly, a very angry lady came over to where we were all sitting (the manager) and started to make a fight with our friends about taking the chips off of the bill. She was literally shouting at my friend in the middle of the bar! My friend tried to explain the situation, said that we were all very loyal customers, and that they just felt this time the nachos weren't quite up to par so they asked for some more chips. She was very insistant that we were being ridiculous, and this continued for about half an hour! I have never seen management at a restaurant so customer-offensive. I work in the restaurant industry and the old adage \\"the customer is always right\\" is certainly true where I work. I cannot even imagine a place of business that values their customers so little. Five dollars! To us it wasn't a matter of the money, as much as my friends weren't aware that they were going to be charged for the handful of chips. To the management, I cannot even imagine was five dollars was on a bar bill that was over a hundred dollars, just for our table. \\n\\nNeedless to say, I won't be returning, and I've spread this story around to everyone I know.

It was tasty, except it had a bit too much pepper for my liking. The biscuit was really delicious. I paid for a side a jelly (.75 cents), they were a bit skimpy on the side. \\nI'd definitely like to come back & try one of their traditional dishes & one of the pastries next time!"},{"name":"Fox Bros.

The best barbecue I have ever eaten. Went on a Thursday around 9 am and we were in the parking lot waiting. It was a 3:30 hour wait but it was so worth it. The time flew by. People brought lawn chairs and the restaurant supplied some if you got their early and they weren't all gone. We didn't have any and I liked that more. We got to move and talk to people in line. We brought a frisbee, beer, and a speaker and just tailgated the time away. Met some awesome people in line from Europe coming here for the second time because it was the best barbecue they have ever had and, met the first people in line who were locals who got their at 5:30 am. We taught some people how to throw a forehand in frisbee which was interesting and almost nailed a few people in the head, but it was all in good fun.\\n\\nAn hour before they opened, an employee came around asking each group how many pounds of each meat they were going to order to let people know if they have it or are going to be out. We were the cutoff for the pulled pork so my group was stoked! Turkey was gone well before us.\\n\\nOnce the place opened at 11am, took until 12:30 for us to get to the front counter and order our meats. Ordered brisket, pulled pork, ribs, and pork beans. They were out of turkey, but some nice group as we were sitting down gave us some of theirs to try and it was amazing. Never knew turkey had a taste until then. That was southern hospitality. Everyone was so friendly it just made the experience so much better. Inside is pretty tight and dark, so we sat outside on the patio on picnic benches.\\n\\nYou will never have brisket like this. Literally you can't even pick it up without it falling apart. It melted in your mouth like butter on a hot biscuit. The spice rubs on all of the meats were an explosion of Texas in your mouth. I will definitely be going back here the next time I am in Austin because this was one of the highlights of my trip. I left with a proud meat baby and was ready to for a long nap.\\n\\nPro Tip: (learned this from the locals who gave us some because we didn't know this) bring ziplock bags for your leftovers!!! This is a meatlover's destination and you need to order more than you can stomach. \\n\\nPro Tip #2: Bring beer (lots), good company and your best cowboy hats."},{"name":"Hei La Moon","address":"88 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Amazing dimsum at a great price.

My husband had the lobster poutine and it was good. Overly sauced and very filling and savoury if that's what you're in to. I had a latte there and it was disgusting. They only had almond milk as an alternative and no flavours (ie: vanilla, etc) it tasted as if I had a mouthful of coffee grinds & it was 5$. I only had 2 sips and couldn't finish it. The following day, I went back with my sister. She had a crepe and it was very thick and chewy. The inside was good, but the crepe itself was odd textures. I had the vege primavera omelette and it lacked flavour. I had to douse my eggs in hot sauce to get flavours, it was very bland. Overall for the price, and wait times, I will most likely not go back.

First of all, I'm not a huge soup or noodle person; following in the steps of Ron Swanson, meat matters most to me. Also, I have a pretty heavy appetite so I knew that just one ramen bowl would not satiate me. Therefore, I ordered the #1 ramen bowl with extra meat and also got a bowl of pork rice on the side ($1 discount as a combo). I have to say, the extra rice bowl was well worth it, but extra meat? What a joke! I got exactly three slices of pork meat in my ramen. The question on my mind was, does the original bowl come with 2 slices of meat, meaning I paid 3 bucks for 1 extra slice. Or does the bowl come with a meager 1 slice so I paid for 2 slices. Either way, this is a preposterous deal. Ranting aside, the food itself was quite delicious. But in all honesty, it was hard to compare considering I've only had cheap packaged ramen before. Luckily, when we arrived, the line was not all that long otherwise, I would've been more upset. As for the atmosphere, the place is pretty small and cozy. I applaud them for creating such a incredibly small restaurant to drive up demand like crazy. I actually think they would get fewer customers if they had opened a reasonably sized restaurant.\\n\\nPros: good ramen (I think), cozy, austin-like, friendly servers\\nCons: line can be long, extra meat barely qualifies as \\"extra,\\" tightly-packed, if you happen to get a window seat, be prepared to have people stare at you eating while they wait in line"},{"name":"Dirty Frank's Hot Dog Palace","address":"248 S 4th St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"This is a cool funky joint.

Nick was our bartender and he shared recommendations about the popcorn as well as a recommendation of where to go to next. He said that we should stop at another cocktail bar, Yvonne's, for an after dinner drink and we weren't disappointed with that bar either. \\n\\nThis bar had their windows wide open which allowed us to see outside into the street and feel like we were really experiencing Boston without walking around aimlessly.

Many of the items weren't even labeled, a peeve of mine. But the cheeses they offered were top notch. \\nMy wife got a pino noir and she said she wanted to gulp it down, it was so good. For dessert, they were out of their specialty. That seemed odd as we dined fairly early. Instead we shared a passionfruit mousse. Very good, but as I ate it I couldn't help thinking, do we really need dessert after we just devoured an entire cow.\\nMy suggestion: if you have a coupon, it's worth a go. Otherwise you will pay about $100 per couple and there are just too many restaurant here that will give you outstanding food for that price."},{"name":"Fox Bros. Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Not having too many BBQ brisket options in ATL, I can't be too picky.  The meat was decent here, but it still left me yearning for a little something more that is hard to put my finger on.  My standard criteria for determining really good BBQ is whether or not I even really need to add any BBQ sauce.  In this case, while pretty good, Fox Bros.' BBQ does require the condimentization.\\n\\nThe food specifically: I had a combo plate of chopped brisket (they were out of sliced) and smoked chicken, and I tried one of my wife's pork ribs.  The brisket was a bit on the fatty side, but that's actually the way I like it; I really would have preferred to have had it sliced.  The chicken was decent, but most of the flavor came from the rub on the skin; the smoke penetration wasn't particularly strong, although it's tough to do that for chicken without overcooking it.  The price is a little high (mid-teens for a plate), but the portions are hefty, thereby yielding a reasonable price-performance ratio.\\n\\nIf it was just on the meat, I'd say maybe 3.5 stars for this place... but they've got a solid selection of side dishes, which in my experience is standard for TX BBQ joints (for any place that purports to be authentic TX BBQ, I always check for brisket, green beans, and banana pudding).  As Wallace pointed out, the Tominator is something to try.  To clarify, it's not just beef stew, but it's Brunswick Stew that they slather onto the tots before smothering it in melted cheese.  I'm scared to see how large a full order would be.  And finally, there was the banana pudding, which was a little thicker in consistency than the BP's I've had in TX.  Nilla wafer content in the BP was generous.\\n\\nOverall: I will be going back... but I'll bring my hollow leg next time."},{"name":"Jake's Famous Crawfish","address":"401 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I just don't get it.\\nMaybe I just don't like American-style seafood, but this shit was 100% flavorless.\\nEnded up ordering a few items from the HH menu and the Large Seafood platter which had dungeoness crab (deshelled -- yuck!), crawfish, smoked salmon, oysters, jumbo shrimp, and baby shrimp.\\n\\nThe only thing enjoyable was the crawfish, but there were only 3 in the whole tray.

Upon my arrival, hard to find parking on a Friday was expected  but we were lucky enough to find one right by the resteraunt. The resteraunt was crazy packed that night but our host made sure to come get us the moment a table was available. We waited roughly 20 minutes with no reservation and expecting to wait an hr. The managers and hosts were all very friendly and was quick to answer any questions I had. (I asked what kind of flowers were on the walls and ceiling haha and in case you're wondering too, they are cherry blossoms and lotus) over all great decor and great staff!\\n\\nFor appetizers we had beef tataki, braised pork belly$15 and taro and hotate hoyaki $9 (baked scallops)\\n \\nThe beef tataki came and was more than enough to share with my table of 4. It was light in flavor and soft and tender. \\n\\nBraised pork belly came in a claypot and sizzling. I liked the presentation but wish there was something more special about it when it came to flavor.  I think I will try braised pork there again next time but inside baos instead.\\n\\nBeing use to baked scallops being serve in a shell, Fuji served it on a plate, I enjoyed this dish very much because it's one of my go to dish. I love the way it was prepared flavorwise and was delighted when it satisfied my hotate cravings.My only complain is that the plate was so flat that it made it a bit harder to pick up the food when it became smaller pieces. Maybe if they served it along with a spoon, it would help. \\n\\nFor our entrees,we got sushi boat 2 $89 and wagyu entree $35 (sorry I don't remember the full name) \\n\\nThe sushi boat 2 was shared between me and two friends because one of our friend is allergic to fish. \\n\\nIt came with a good selection of sashimi, makis,and nigris (I think i spelled that wrong but it's raw fish on rice) \\n\\nWhat i liked was that every piece was prepare different from others so I didn't feel like I was constantly having the same flavor over and over again. It's was definitely ALOT. And I would get it again if we had an extra person or two to help eat.\\n\\nThe wagyu entree was exactly what I expected it to be. Good sized slices serve with miso soup and rice. It's a fun dish that you get to cook yourself on top on hot stones that they made sure to replace quickly after 10 minutes to maintain the freshness. One of the managers Shailey suggested us cooking it it for 30 second per side or how well done we want it. And it was the perfect amount of time.  Any longer than that will be a waste of the experience. \\n\\nWe did not get dessert because we were way too full but they had a great selections between ice cream and crepe cakes. \\n\\nOur waitress was great and as well as the rest of the staff.

I've had BBQ from all over the States, and this is probably some of the best BBQ I've ever had.\\n\\nWe ate here around 2 pm on a Saturday, and it was PACKED.

The tots are crispy and the toppings give it extra yummy flavor.  I am missing it now as I write a description for it.\\n\\n- Texas Fries: Fries smothered in bbq sauce and topped with chopped brisket, pulled pork, jalapenos and covered with melted cheese. Served with ranch. I'm not a person for surprise spiciness in my food, so I was wary of these fries.  Under the melted cheese and tender meats, the fries were very starchy and bleh.  But the toppings were all very good.\\n\\nI shared \\"The Everything Plate\\", which you can choose four meat portions: pulled pork, beef brisket (chopped/sliced), 4 chicken, ribs, 4 wings.  I went with the pulled pork, sliced beef brisket, ribs, and 4 wings.  EVERYTHING on the plate was DELICIOUS!  I am a picky brisket person, and I loved it! Their brisket is super moist and tasty!  I definitely tried to eat my boyfriend's portion, muahaha!  He really enjoyed the wings, and I liked the pulled pork. The rib meat falls off the bone, very tender and soft. \\n\\nOur entree also came with 2 sides, which we chose mac-n-cheese and the collard greens.  I loved the cheese in the mac-n-cheese, I couldn't get enough.  The collard greens were soft and tasty.

We ordered the Fried chicken dinner and the fried pork shoulder dinner.  First, these portions are massive relative to the price.  Although the appetizers sounded wonderful, we passed on them because we saw some entrees as they came out of the kitchen and knew we would have more than our fill with entrees alone.  Their fried chicken was recommended by Alex and that is what my husband ordered.  The chicken was nicely breaded and tender.  I will say, however, that I felt the pork entree that I ordered was the star of the show.  The griddle cakes were delicious, with whole kernels in them.  The pimento butter gave the whole dish an extra kick along with the homemade chow chow.  The pork was truly the most tender pork I have ever had and the breaded had no shortage of seasoning.

When I knew I was visiting Austin the only place I HAD to eat at was Franklin Barbecue, which was truly the most divine BBQ feast I've ever had.  Praise the lord. \\n\\nI heard about the line.  I heard about how people get drunk in line.  I heard about people busting out lawn chairs while doing crossword puzzles 'til they make it to the door.  I heard about the selling out of brisket while in line!  I heard it all.  Some locals mentioned it was over-hyped.  Some locals mentioned they haven't had the willpower to wait in line to try it.  All I knew was that whatever it took, I traveled all this way to Austin and I was gonna get myself a slab of brisket. \\n\\nWe came here on a Tuesday, hoping that a weekday line would be less brutal, which it was.  For an 11am opening, we arrived an hour before, which I feared was already too late.  But by the time the Uber car pulled up to the joint the line wasn't too long.  It did curve around the building, but I've seen pictures of the line being much longer than what was, so it was doable.  We ended up waiting 2.5 hours.  \\n\\nIt was worth it.  It was the best BBQ I've ever had, which I know doesn't say much as a Pacific Northwest native.  But shit, it was the best I've ever had.  Once you're at the counter you order by weight how much of the meats you want, along with sides and drinks.  I ordered half a pound of brisket and half of pound of the pork ribs, with potato salad, banana pie and a Big Red.  \\n\\nI'm only sad that there is nothing close to Franklin's around the Seattle area, because just writing this reminds me of how delicious this was.  The brisket, which they give a mix of lean and fatty portions, was amazing.  It was incredibly juicy, tender and was seasoned very well.  I'm a believer that if the meat is perfect, you don't need BBQ sauce and that was the case with this brisket.  Every morsel was succulent.  The pork ribs were also verrrry good, as it had an espresso-rub and you could easily taste the marinade.  It was also perfectly cooked, with meat falling off the bone once you sunk your teeth into it.  Incredible.  Potato salad was also really good, as it was made with mustard, which reminded me of how my dad makes it.  I would recommend this for your side.  For dessert I had the banana pie, which was chilled and creamy.  You also have the option of getting white bread to go along with your meal.  Leftovers will be inevitable, depending on how much you order.  But you will find the force within you to eat on, at least, as much as you can.  I don't regret getting a pound of meat in total.  My only regret is that I didn't get more! \\n\\nI believe it's worth the wait, especially if you're visiting from an area where BBQ is sparse.  The line can be brutal, but it may help to know that they do have lawn chairs for people to use and it's easy to make friends with all those in line.  You're all in this together.  And once you get in, your neighbors in line start cheering you on.  Who doesn't love that kind of bonding experience...over BBQ?  Best BBQ I've had.

I finally had the opportunity since returning from college this break, and I must say it's definitely a place that lives up to its fame. It's not only for the world-class barbeque, but it's also an experience in itself.\\n\\nFOOD\\nMy order (more than enough for a party of 6):\\n-2 lbs brisket\\n-6 ribs\\n-2 sausage links\\n- 1/2 lb turkey\\n-2 banana bourbon pies, 1 pecan pie, 1 key lime pie\\n\\nTo start off, let's talk about the barbeque. Growing up with barbeque in my blood, I must say that Franklin's does not disappoint. My favorite meat is definitely the brisket - parts of the meat are so soft and decadent that it's like eating straight meat butter. Paired with the leaner cuts of brisket, Franklin's brisket is so moist and well-seasoned that it's definitely where this bbq pit stands out. Beware, the meat was so good and so decadent that I ended up only being able to eat a couple slices. \\n\\nMy second favorite is definitely the pork ribs (heads up, they only serve beef ribs on saturday - we went on a sunday morning). The rub is well spiced and the meat is so tender. The meat is just on the border between fall off the bone soft and having enough of a kick and chew that it's the perfect main course to any meal. Highly recommend as well. \\n\\nNext, I would say the sausage is also quite tasty. Not as mind-shattering as the previous two mind you, but still can hold a candle to most bbq pits. I appreciate that the links are more meaty and strongly seasoned - it has more body, and definitely feel more satisfying than the fatty links you often find in hot dogs and grocery stores. \\n\\nFinally, the turkey. Personally, not my favorite bbq turkey, but still pretty good. Was a little dry, but pairs well with other stuff. As a note, I typically like to eat bbq meat without bbq sauce, as it tends to overpower the spices and fragrances of the meat itself, but turkey went well with some sauce.\\n\\nLet's move on to a quick aside to the pies. Unbeknownst to me, Franklin's also serves small personal sized pies that serve as a really great conclusion to a satisfying meal. The banana bourbon pie was actually really tasty. The pie crust/crumble pairs really well with the sweet banana cream. The key lime pie was also solid - definitely less sweet than the banana pie and the key lime has a tartness that just cuts through the rest of the flavors. The pecan pie was also a solid choice.\\n\\nSERVICE\\nService was top notch, especially considering the wait. Staff would come out into the line and ask about what you were planning on ordering and were very helpful in assisting.\\n\\nATMOSPHERE\\nWe arrived there around 7AM (doors open at 11AM) and we were within the first 10 groups or so to enter on a Sunday morning (got food between 11-11:30AM).

Another pizza place within a block of Conans and East Side, plus everything else around here?  That's crazy.  Then I went and tried them out.\\n\\nFirst of all, the staff is SUPER friendly.  It's an order at the counter place, but they come by and check on you all the time and are genuinely interested in your experience (and also to talk bikes, which was cool).  The pizzas are not your norm, which at first put me off because I'm a big fan of the typical supreme and they don't have that.  Doesn't matter.  These pizzas are so amazing and perfect just how they are you don't need no stinkin' supreme.\\n\\nThe first time, we split the NAPOLETANA pizza with the sausage and broccolini - and to our surprise it came out without sauce.  My husband loved this (he's not a huge sauce guy), and even I was won over with how great it was.  The second time, we got two - that same one and the LASAGNA.  I still can't decide which one is my new favorite pizza and I was so excited to have leftovers.\\n\\nHere's the thing that I think does it for me - they have a condiment bar with the most delicious olive oils, fresh chopped garlic, and some sort of magical cheese.  Their pizza is already amazing, but the fresh garlic and cheese takes it to outer space.\\n\\nMy only suggestion - could you magically switch what side of the road you're on so I don't have to cross Burnet to get to you?  That'd be great... though I'd need more stretchy pants, so maybe it's a good thing.  Still... love.

This is the first time I ever had it and Its messy, saucy and full of freshly chopped veggies, because its in a soup of sauce the veggies don't really get cooked as opposed to a thinner crust. The crust is reminiscent of the texture of cornbread. Overall I wouldn't recommend this place based on the type of pizza. I learned that I don't like Chicago style pizza and I don't like Gino's.

You decide. \\n\\nPros: Kids had a great time. \\nThe blue pirate was hot AF. \\nNo horse crap to smell or contend with.\\nBlue pirate has a blue steel look better than Zoolander.\\nOur waitress was nice.\\nThe blue pirate was there.\\nThere is alcohol in abundance to get you through this.\\nThat blue pirate is SERIOUSLY HOT AF.\\n\\nCons:\\nBlue pirate never takes off his shirt. Wtf? \\nThe food is a cross between a good retirement home and a bad Luby's cafeteria. The salmon plate came with sides they dictated - an under seasoned mashed potato (wtf...rice goes with salmon) and mixed veggies straight from Green Giant. The salmon had a sauce on it that was as funky as George Clinton. I scraped it off both mine and my younger kid (she's uppity and extra AF and got the same adult salmon meal....yet her piece was WAY bigger than mine. No consistency here.) This salmon was hammered more than Andy Dick. I'm sure it once looked bright and had dreams of becoming salmon dinner at Pappadeaux's or something but sadly ended up here. \\nThey told us to be here an hour ahead of time. Don't. You'll end up standing for an hour griping at the workers. We got there at 6:30. They said the show started at 8. They told us to show up by 6:30 for seating. We didn't sit down until 8:30. If you want to see me go full on \\"Let me speak to the manager\\" then just have me stand in one spot for two hours. I was at that level of pissed off that you only feel when you are John McEnroe hangry. When I asked how much longer I was told (in this order) \\"just a bit\\" \\"very soon\\" \\"almost immediately\\" and \\"just a second\\". Liars. \\nYou don't get to go in early if you arrive early. You are seated by color. No, not your skin color. Don't take it there. We were purple. Blue pirate came first to seat his bunch. Guess who was last? Yep. I was NEXT LEVEL MACENROE by this time.\\nPepsi products only. Why do crappy establishments insist on Pepsi? \\nYou are supposed to get to choose soup or salad. We had no choice, as salad was served to us all. Keep in mind we didn't go through Groupon. It was cheaper to order directly through the establishment with a code. People using Groupons apparently got a choice. \\nThe show was WAY too long.  I'm not sure if it's because they seat so damn late or what, but by 10 the kids were tired and we'd been there for 3 and a half hours. We left. \\n\\nYes it's touristy. It's made for kids. I've seen other shows though that did this better (Branson shout out) so I know the food doesn't have to suck (don't get the cheesecake dessert btw...unless you like a tart \\"this crap is curdled\\" taste) and can be entertaining. I won't dog on it too much as the kids liked it once it started going. They really need to make the pre show more entertaining. They need to make it possible to get a drink (I shit you not I waited at the bar for 25 minutes and no one acknowledged my presence, which just made my MACENROE rage boil) and fix the food to edible. For the price you pay I understand that 3 courses seems reasonable. Remember though that one course is just a Caesar salad and the last one is a brownie. The cheesecake is an upgrade and damn...they punked me Ashton style on it. The salmon was also an upgrade, so to me it wasn't a great value. \\n\\nI'm going to go yell at tennis now....."},{"name":"Cypress Street Pint & Plate","address":"817 W Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Great local bar and local spot.

I'm guessing it's the charm of the \\"Old Country Store\\" and fond childhood memories.  I ate lunch here over a year ago with my coworkers and had an unmemorable experience.  I didn't bother to review it then.  However, I recently revisited for dinner late at night (they close at 11pm) and finally decided to post a Yelp review.\\n\\nCracker Barrel has an \\"Old Country Store\\" attached to each of its restaurants.  These stores sell all sorts of vintage merchandise, toys, snacks, and various knickknacks.  Outside on the porch, there are wooden rocking chairs, barrels, and games such as checkers.  The store and the restaurant have an old fashioned Southern theme and are decorated with antique pictures and ornaments.\\n\\nAt each table, there is a small golf tee game you can play.  I'm not sure what the name of this game is, but the object is to jump each golf tee on the board until there is only one remaining.  I think it's fun.  I remember playing it as a kid.  You can buy it in the country store.\\n\\nCracker Barrel has two different menus, one for breakfast and one for lunch/dinner.  They serve breakfast all day.  You can find all the classic Southern staples on the menu.  They actually offer quite a lot on the menu, even low carb options.  I'm not going to go into much detail on the dishes I tried because everything was the same: not good.\\n\\nSome of the ingredients like the lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese in the salads are fresh, but very ordinary.  This isn't something you couldn't make at home.  The cooked vegetables and meats are comparable to those you'd find find in a can off the grocery store shelf.  I know I had to force a few bites down and that's never a good thing, especially at a restaurant.\\n\\nService is average.  They sure do hire some country bumpkins to wait tables.

I went in May 2015 around 6pm. There was a line out the door, even on a VERY rainy day. BUT THE WAIT IS WELL WORTH IT!!! They have the lines and seating situation down to a science. You stand in line and a person asks how many people are in your party...(MULTIPLE TIMES!!) and they will seat you when there is an available table. There will be times where a table for 2-3 is opened up so if you have a party greater than 5, you may have to let those people ahead of you seat first. Anyways you do not order until they have a table cleaned for you. They have 2 people cleaning the tables right after you leave your seat to prepare it for the next party. Everything is just VERY efficient there. \\n\\nFOOD: I ordered the tonkotsu original with extra noodles ($1.50) and naruto maki ($.60). I highly recommend ordering extra noodles and extra chashu (3-4 total)! It comes with half a soft boiled egg & one piece of chashu. The noodles are just perfectly cooked and it's very skinny. The noodles are not too hard nor too soft and it comes out SUPER fast. It literally took 5 minutes for our order to come out. And the chashu was SUPER DELICIOUS. IT LITERALLY JUST MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH! It also has that perfect smoky flavor and it's a large piece as well. The broth was not too salty, although I did feel a little dehydrated afterwards...but it was not salty when I ate my ramen. \\nOther people in my party ordered it with the spicy bomb, which is better than the fire in the bowl. DO NOT get fire in the bowl...it just taste like habanero sauce...and that's weird to mix with ramen. The extra ramen noodles are not given to you until you are finished with the 1st bowl of ramen. They do not want the noodles to be overcooked/bloated...so therefore a bowl of extra noodles will come out when you request it. This is very traditional and I appreciate their logic about this! I did notice that the second time around, the noodles were a bit less soft, so it probably should have been simmered in my broth more, but I didn't want my broth to get cold. \\n\\nOverall I feel so spoiled by eating here and now I can never compare Dallas's ramen to Austin's ramen...I wish Ramen Tatsu-Ya would open a location in Dallas!!!"},{"name":"BiBim Box","address":"196 Quincy St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"This food truck stops outside my work every Monday and is very well run.

The female waitresses looked and spoke like the assistants to Will Ferrel's character \\"Mugatu\\", and the male waiters and bartenders looked strikingly similar to a strung out European model. \\n\\nLike Blake said in his review, the place had the volume level of the music hiked up to the level where talking to your friends required leaning over the table one or two times a conversation and screaming \\"What did you say?!?!\\" .  The fact that they were playing strictly House Techno music on this particular night at Apres Diem made the place seem even more similar to a scene right out of 'Zoolander.'  I started to get excited when I began to think about the possibility of two of the waiters challenging one another to a \\"walk-off\\" at some point in the night.  Unfortunately, it never happened.\\n\\nOur particular waitress last night was pretty nice though.  As soon as I arrived and sat down with my party (2 hours tardy) she walked over, smiled, and said, \\"Vat can I get you.\\"  During the rest of my stay I noticed she checked on us every 2-3 minutes for the depletion levels of our drinks and beer bottles, which makes you a winner in my book, no matter how little brain activity the task requires.\\n\\nWhat I enjoyed the most about Apres Diem was their surprisingly diverse selection of beer.  A decent high gravity selection of bottled beers can sometimes be hard to come by, so they automatically received an extra star for having a beer list that included at least 4 different high gravity selection.  My personal favorite high gravity beer selection on the menu was without any doubt the 'Duvel', which is 8.5% alcohol.  As soon as that last sip of Duvel was consumed I was finally able to laugh about my crazy night in Atlanta, and I really just felt better about life in general.\\n\\nAfter weighing in on what I thought of Apres Diem overall, I decided that I can't give this place too bad of a rating.  After all, the series of unfortunate events that took place before I arrived left me in a slightly cynical mood.  \\n\\nI sat in traffic from 'Screen on the Green' for two hours.  \\n\\nInitially, I was on my way to the park for the show stuck in traffic for about an hour with other people who were also traveling to see the show.  By the time I got close it began to rain like crazy and my friends called me saying they canceled the show so they were leaving to go hang out at Apres Diem.   \\n\\nRight around the time I would have been able to park near Piedmont and walk (in the pouring rain) my bad luck once again left me stuck in traffic; only this time, I was in traffic with the people who were leaving the show, with no possible way to escape due to a bumper to bumper stand still on both sides of the road.   \\n\\nIrony gave me one of the most terrible two-punch combos I have ever experienced that night.   \\n\\nNeedless to say, it was one of the most horrible nights of Atlanta traffic that I have ever experienced.\\n\\nThen when I arrived at the shopping center where Apres Diem is located, it took me nearly 15 minutes to find a parking spot.  When I did find what felt like a gift from heaven parking spot, I had to run through sheets of rain that left me drenched for the remainder of the night.  \\n\\nI'm not complaining, I am just making it clear how unfortunate events can sometimes have a negative impact on your opinion of a business."},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Went here for dinner the first time, had the secret burger before which was amazing one of the best burgers in the Boston area.

The meatballs were okay though the spice level overpowered the flavor of the meatballs.  Also at $3 per meatball (we got 4 total) it was definitely not worth the cost.\\n\\n- Steak Frites - $26 (not including the $12 calamari and octopus add on which we got) - Steak was only okay.  I thought it would be a thicker cut for the price but it was just a thin slice.  Flavor wasn't bad but again, it too was over salted and because it was so thin my medium rare request was pretty much impossible (definitely was well done).

Flavor was okay but I wouldn't pay more than $4 for the amount we got.\\n\\nOverall the service was good and our drinks were always topped up.

They just don't start serving people until 11a. \\n\\nSuper happy we got there when we did because they are known for their brisket and they run out of it pretty quickly. The staff is very good about telling you how long the wait is and they come write down what you think you will want to eat while in line so they cook the right amount of food. \\n\\nFinally at 12:30p we arrived at the counter and were drooling. Everything looked amazing and of course we ordered way more than we could eat.  Aaron Franklin himself was even there and was super friendly. Don't know if I would ever go again just because it was such an ordeal, but glad I got to experience the famous Franklin BBQ!

I have now ordered delivery from Aman three times. Three times a charm; I am never making that mistake again.\\n\\nTHE FIRST TIME\\nDelivery took about an hour and a half. That's a long wait when I was only ordering enough food for two people. When everything arrived, it was a little cold. I'm assuming the driver got lost; not a huge deal. I did have a problem with the food. The chicken tikka masala was sort of lacking in... chicken. It was more like a soup or sauce. The vegetable samosas were very bland, surprisingly so. Possibly the worst samosas I have ever tasted.\\n\\nTHE SECOND TIME\\nThis time, delivery was fast. The food, however, still left so much to be desired. The naan was stiff and tasted stale. Once again, the most bland samosas I have ever ordered. The jalfrazi was so thin, it resembled a broth, and the taste was very weak. The tandoori skewers were terrible; they were very plain, not marinated at all, and very overcooked. That's when I swore I would never order from Aman Place again.\\n\\nTHIRD TIME'S AN EFFING CHARM\\nI had some company and they really wanted Indian food, and Aman was our only delivery option. I figured it couldn't hurt to give them one last chance. \\n\\nAnd okay, I get it, lesson learned.\\n\\nThis is what I ordered:\\n\\nTwo (2) orders of chicken tikka masala (these both come with rice)\\nOne extra order of rice\\nOne 2 liter of Coke\\n\\nThis is what was delivered:\\n\\nOne (1) order of chicken tikka masala with rice\\nOne 2 liter of Fanta orange soda\\n\\nI'm sure I looked confused when I saw the orange soda, and the delivery driver immediately put on a brilliant smile and announced, in a very thick accent, \\"Fanta very good, Fanta go with EVERYTHING!\\" \\n\\nIt was too funny to argue with, so I gave him $25.00 (the total was $21 and change) and came inside to discover that I was missing half the order. I immediately called Aman Place, and I swear to god, this is how the actual conversation went down:\\n\\nMe: I have two small problems; I'm missing an order of tikka masala, an order of extra rice, and I think we were given orange soda instead of Coke.\\nAman Place: Orange soda is Fanta. Fanta go with everything!\\nMe: I'm... sure it does, but do you have Coke?\\nAman Place: No, we have Fanta. Fanta go with everything! Is very delicious.\\nMe: Okay, well --\\n\\n(click)\\n\\nYes, he hung up after that dazzling defense of the powers of orange soda.\\n\\nSo I called back, and asked about the missing food. The same man answered and responded, \\"Do you want the rest of your order?\\" I explained that I had just paid for it, so yes, I would like it, please.\\n\\nIt arrived almost two hours later.

Half the dishes were cold by the time the rolling cart arrived near our table. Some of the dishes (i.e. the fried taro with the pork in the center) were overly fried, way too greasy and made my stomach queasy (rhyme intended). The rice rolls with the shrimp were lacking on the shrimp and sauce.

Raw oysters were a great deal as they were running a 1/2 off winter special.  Get them while you can.  They were shucked nicely and super briny.  5/5\\n\\nThe tamago was also excellent.  I liked their take on the Japanese omelet topped over the crispy rice cake.  Very inventive, nice texture but most of all, pretty tasty.  5/5  \\n\\nTheir mixed greens salad was simple but good as well.  Nice and light and the crispy kale crumbles substituted croutons as an added crunchy topping.  \\n\\nOnly minor setback in the apps round was with the wings since they were actually my daughter's entree and she couldn't really eat it as it was too spicy for her.  Since the menu didn't mention any spices, that was a bit rough.  Thank goodness for the giant bowl of shoestring fries!\\n\\nFor entrees, we shared the Crispy Flounder Fillet and the Miso-Sake Glazed Haddock.  Both were just \\"okay\\".  I typically prefer a much lighter sauce or glaze than what was served on our flounder.  It tasted very heavy and creamy and somewhat overpowered the fish.  The haddock was a bit better but it had a really strong Sake flavor that my mom didn't care much for and I have to say I agree with her there.  Personally, they're probably both a 3/5.  \\n\\nAs a saving grace, we thoroughly enjoyed the chocolate bread pudding for dessert.  Served warm, soft and gooey - fantastic.  Totally disappeared from our table 3 minutes after it was served.  5/5 \\n\\nOverall, a great place for apps and dessert but missed on the entrees. Arguably more like a 3.5/5 but since the entrees are the most important highlights of a dining experience and there are no 1/2 stars, it will have to stay a 3 this go around.

I got mine without the pork and instead wanted Brussels sprouts, but I was charged for the Brussels sprouts on top of the bowl price even though I didn't choose the meat- if the quality had been better, I wouldn't have minded so much, but the ingredients were not very fresh and lacked a lot of flavor. the egg was okay, and the Brussels sprouts were amazing, but everything else was incredibly lackluster. the biggest sin was SOGGY NOODLES!!! to me this is ramen 101, you have to get the noodles right, and I was sorely disappointed. further insult to injury, the portion of noodles was so small that the ratio of broth completely overwhelmed it- and there is no easy way to get more noodles if you don't order them at the start...but then again, why do I want more soggy noodles? at $9.50 a bowl for lunch, the ingredients should be great, and this was so underwhelming I can't see myself making another trip to this restaurant or recommending it.\\n\\nfinally, the music was very loud and all over the place- one moment they're playing tycho, the next it's foreigner, and then some strange pseudo techno thing. if the music is going to be so loud I need to shout across the table to speak, it should at least have a theme.\\n\\nbe aware, you pay before you get your food, so keep this in mind if you're the sort of person who likes to order additional items throughout the meal. also, if you like to have waitstaff pay attention to you throughout your meal, this is not the place for that sort of experience (which is not to say I have a complaint against the staff, I thought they were very good, but I generally like to have the option to order more food or get a drink refill and I was irked that this place didn't offer that experience- especially when I consider that for two of us we paid over $35 for lunch after tip)\\n\\noverall, this was a very disappointing experience- if you have actually had good ramen, don't bother going here. this place seems to cater to folks who value a \\"hip\\" atmosphere over quality ingredients and food made with care."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"We drove 3 hours from For Worth, waited for 5.5 hours in 40 degree weather, and did it all knowing after our meal we would have to drive 3 hours back, and it was 100% worth it.

Grilled squid was poorly cleaned and could have used a few more seconds on the grill or higher heat.

We ordered the \\"Chicken Pot Pie\\" and were told it was a short week and they didn't have time to make them but they would be available next week. I thought that to be odd as next week would be a short week since it is the 4th of July. We are leaving on Sunday and would not be here \\"next week\\". We ordered a meatloaf sandwich to split and the bread was soft and mushy. I would say it was just OK just nothing special. We did get a couple of the moon pies and several different cookies and they were OK as well but for $21 I expected more. We were staying off of Hwy.192 and with traffic it took us a little over an hour to get there. We were very disappointed with the food for the cost and there TripleD \\"featured\\" dish to not be available and then given a poor excuse as to why. The people working were friendly and helpful but I don't think we will go back. Be sure and call first to see if they have the \\"Chicken Pot Pie\\" before you go."},{"name":"Taco Cabana","address":"12525 N Mopac Expwy","city":"Austin","stars":"2","text":"Been going there cause is close but food is always cold \\nTortillas and meats \\nThey do not know how to rap a burrito"},{"name":"Buttermilk & Bourbon","address":"160 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The food was excellent, don't get me wrong, but the service was sub-par. We arrived at about 1pm on a Sunday and it took over an hour to be seated, despite there only being one other couple waiting in front of us and tables that remained empty that entire time. The host was gracious and apologetic, but when we were finally seated, our server was curt and unfriendly. After getting us water, we informed him that we were actually ready to order. He stared blankly at us as we waited for a response, then sarcastically said, \\"Okay...?\\" My friend sheepishly said something like \\"Oh, I didn't realize you were ready.\\" After she placed our order, he said nothing and left. Definitely left us feeling like we'd done something wrong! He didn't say a word to us for the rest of our dining experience.\\n\\nWe had the mango-pineapple soft serve mimosas, which were lovely and fun! An ~instagrammable~ treat. The pork belly cracklings were deliciously crispy and chewy at once, and the tangy mustard was a perfect dipping sauce. The buttermilk bacon pancakes were very light on the bacon (it's in the form of bits cooked into the pancakes), but the coffee butter was spectacular. Not ashamed to say that we cleaned out the butter dish with our forks once the pancakes were gone! We also loved the smoked chicken and biscuits. I'm typically not a fan of anything smoked, but any smoky flavor was masked by the fantastic slightly-spicy chipotle gravy that the biscuits were smothered in. The sausage in the gravy was plentiful and yummy.\\n\\nI'd definitely recommend checking the location out for the food alone, but unfortunately the service wasn't the best while we were there.

The ramen here comes out fast. I ordered an my food was out within 10 minutes. It was amazing. So yes, there was maybe a 10-15 minute wait on a Sunday night for dinner.

So always expect some sort of wait when you come and plan in advance because parking sucks too. Food wise-you can't go wrong! There's not a whole lot to choose from but I always go with the tonkatsu shoyu. The broth is very rich but not super salty, I just wish it came with more chashu.

I am of the school of thought that BBQ should be well seasoned and stand on its own WITHOUT THE NEED FOR SAUCE. I think BBQ should never-ever-ever be boiled and have a great smoky flavor without tasting like an ashtray. It is also my belief there should be just enough fat on the ribs or brisket to keep them moist, but cooked long enough to render it down to a miniscule, but tasty gelatinous layer. That is exactly what you are going to find here. \\n\\nSo if your definition of BBQ is fall off the bone pork ribs or beef brisket that are absolutely delicious WITHOUT SAUCE, this is your stop!!! If the saying is true that you are what you eat, then I've tried so much BBQ in this city that I should literally have turned into a pig by now! Unfortunately, I've disliked most of the offerings in metro Atlanta with the exception of a very small hand full of places. So it pleases me to no end that I have FINALLY found a rib joint to call home. Fox Brothers makes me eat until I'm sick, and that is exactly what I've been looking for in a BBQ joint!\\n\\n\\nFINAL THOUGHTS\\n\\nI know this food category is highly subjective and everyone has their idea of tasty when it comes to good old fashion American barbecue. Personally, I'm a lover of pork spare ribs or baby back ribs if spare ribs are not available. I rarely order anything else and I must say I've had no better ribs in this city than here @ Fox Brothers. The Short Rib (when available) is also worth a try and it's huge. The sides I've tried to date such as the mac n' cheese and the super sweet baked beans have been great, but make no mistake about it... I am here for the meat!

They explained that they had some issues with Uber, and that my meal had been ready for quite a while before it was picked up.  I think that was probably a big part of it.  She gave me a gift certificate, and remade my meal from that day.  They were both very nice, and I thought the question of 'what can we do to make it up to you' spoke volumes.\\n\\nThat being said, a couple of the problems couldn't be accounted for by Uber (like being on hold excessive times).  And, I do maintain that, at times, there can be issues with consistency.  But, I am changing my review to 4 stars to account for : previous experiences, and how the management team took my comments into consideration and acted."},{"name":"La Mezcaleria","address":"1622 Commercial Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I went online to try to make a reservation for 7.

I find that the more frills are put on a burger, the less I want to eat it. Tasty Burger burgers are simple: flat, greasy, American-cheesy, and just plain tasty. To top that, they have been consistently adding to their canned beer list, which I LOVE. Plus you get a $2 coozie! What could ruin that package? Oh, I know.. TERRIBLE SERVICE. \\nThe service at this particular location has gone WAY, WAY downhill since it opened. I don't know if management has changed hands or what, but it has taken a complete 180 .. I used to go in and be greeted almost immediately by either the bartender, host, manager, basically whoever saw me first and it was with a smile and \\"Where would you like to sit?\\" The bartenders used to be friendly and accommodating and now I feel like I'm a burden when I take a seat at the bar. I KNOW that a friendly demeanor is 100% necessary to work behind a bar, because I'm a bartender! That's right; I'm a bartender and I almost always prefer to sit at the bar instead of a table, so yes, I am constantly judging the type of service I get from behind the taps. Lately, I'll walk in and absolutely no one will acknowledge my presence for 5 or so minutes. Eventually, I'll take a seat and then for another 5-10 minutes I'll be waiting for someone to come and say hello and take my drink order. One time recently, a gentleman (not in any particular uniform) didn't even say \\"hello\\" or \\"how are you?\\".. He literally plopped menus on our table and walked away. Are you kidding me? Then when we weren't ready to order, he didn't come back for another 10-15 minutes. We had to call him over and he told us \\"Sorry, I thought you were still having a conversation.\\" Towards the end I think he realized he was giving extremely undesirable service, because he started being overly nice. I tipped over 20% because I am a server and this is how most people make a living. But Tasty Burger, you need to get it together. Seriously. Just absolutely unacceptable. Your food is so good!

For the most part, it was pretty lean and pulled apart so easily. Is there such a thing as velvety meat bc it had me feeling pretty glorious after every bite?  The ribs were also up there and so tasty with that dry rub. We also had the sausage which may be my least favorite out of the 3 meats, but that doesn't mean it wasn't any good.

I wonder if he's comfortable being less than completely clear and honest in ways I can't see ... like what is going on in the kitchen.  \\n\\nI don't know.

Anyways, he was great, attentive and respectful. Even when my friend was being annoying with so many questions about where the cows are from & sh*t . Ugh *eye roll*. But he handled it in a friendly & composed manner and made me think he actually cared to tell my friend the answers. Hahah. Even though I was sitting there completely unimpressed with my friend thinking to myself \\"do you Actually care where the damn cows are from?!\\" Hahaha. Oh and then, to be extra annoying, my friend ordered \\"Ice on the side\\" with his water *face palm*.\\n\\nANYWAYS, I had a wonderful experience at Elisa and I cannot wait to go back! ..

Not one of these really overrated and overpriced blowout restaurants. It's so beautiful inside, the food is absolutely amazing, the fact that it's owned by an actual family and not just some famous chef concept place and all of them and the staff are just so friendly. We have literally gone three times with three different groups of people in the last month it's been open and loved it every time. Our friends rave about the signature Ramen, but we don't eat pork so I really can't comment on it. I however have had their cocktails, chicken Ramen, lobster Ramen, chicken rice bowl, fried edamame, that's a wrap,  the fried chicken appetizer, and the amazing green tea cheesecake and absolutely everything was great. It's just so nice to have a place with real prices and not some ridiculous $16 mediocre lunch or dinner. It's cozy, the food is great, the prices are absolutely perfect and definitely keep people going back with how much overpriced crap is in this area. The fact that three different Asian spots have closed because of a total lack of patrons in the last two years just three blocks south of here says something about how  nobody wants these gigantic overrated and overpriced places. This place gets more full every time we go and it's so awesome to see how successful they are. Wish them the best, and I really can't say how happy we are to have them in Midtown."},{"name":"Buttermilk & Bourbon","address":"160 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"So I smelled this place before I saw it. I was walking down Commonwealth and smelled fried chicken. I looked around and saw this place, and immediately made a reservation for Sunday because who doesn't love bourbon and buttermilk anything?!\\n\\nApparently they have changed their menu in the last 6 weeks, so it's different than a lot of the earlier posts. There were a group of 8 of us and we decided to do family style in order to try as much as we could. We ordered the mac and cheese, wings (with sweet&spicy sauce on the side), ribs, bbq shrimp, and biscuits. We also order watermelon sorbet and beignets for dessert. \\n\\nSo the biscuits are a yes!! They literally gave them to us fresh out the oven because they were piping hot. Wow, I could have eaten a dozen those biscuits were soooooo good. The mac and cheese was also amazing and it had andouille sausage in it, so if you're vegetarian request it without meat. The bbq shrimp was sweet with a bit of spice and came on cheddar grits. This was amazingly seasoned dish that was surprising take on it. And coming from a girl who grew up in the south, this was pretty damn good. The ribs were good, it's a traditional sauce so don't get freaked out by North Carolina sauce (it's not mustard, nor is it watery vinegar). They are on top of the potato salad which the only complaint. I wish the salad was on the side. The wings were delicious, but I think I want to go with the half chicken next time with the same sweet n spicy sauce. \\n\\nThe beignets for dessert was soo good. Like some of the best ones I've had outside New Orleans. The watermelon sorbet was good. The sorbets are not on the menu, but you can request, which is good for someone like me. We got the cone on the side because only a couple people wanted it, but we weren't really feeling it.\\n\\nAlso are server, Josh, was super personable and honest about the menu, which I appreciate. He was also helpful in splitting up the bill for us.\\n\\nWill be back in a few months!!!!!"},{"name":"Twigs Bistro and Martini Bar","address":"801 Waterfront Way, Ste 103","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"We went to Twigs twice since they have opened.

The ribs were fall off the bone, melt in your mouth, finger-lickin awesome! I didn't use much of the BBQ sauce on my sandwich just because the ribs were just so good by themselves!

Our party of six waited about an hour on a Wednesday night in October.  \\n\\nThe restaurant itself is modern and hip.  I don't really remember much about the d√©cor, but to be fair, we were on the upstairs patio so there were more distractions to catch our eye.  If weather permits, try to get an outdoor table, it really adds to the experience.\\n\\nThe menu was a bit overwhelming, but our server explained everything thoroughly, answered all our questions, and offered his recommendations.  He was very accommodating and helpful.\\n\\nAgain, the menu has a lot going on, there's quite a variety.  We ordered some rolls and the crab rangoon dip which was amazing!

I can't even convey to you how f***ing good that meal was. \\nAnd since it was a special, I sadly may never be able to :'(\\n\\nThe staff are also all super mellow and friendly, cleverly grabbing drinks for people who aren't currently ordering food to assuage potential line-related frustrations that may be bubbling up. \\nMy go-to is their weekend coffee special, The Nutella Turbo (if you have to ask me what that is, you have to order for yourself and find out!). \\n\\nBreakfast is the most important meal of the day, and if you even remotely value your taste buds, you'll head over to Se7en Bites for one of the best g*dd*mn meals you'll ever have in Orlando (to Hell with hyperbole). \\nAfter all, our ancestors first slinked out of the mud so that one day, you could try the 7th Trimester for yourself (or, again, anything else because YOU.

However the bagels are amazing and even though I am completely dissatisfied  with their service this must be noted. Issues with service: here's one example. I order a dozen bagels (they advertise a Bakers dozen so 13). I ask if one garlic bagel could be toasted with scallion cream cheese and the remaining 12 be an even split between garlic, sesame and pumpernickel. I also asked for a Tub scallion cream cheese and asked if she would use this for the bagel so don't pay extra needlessly. So, I understand some places won't do this and that's fine, but the lady behind the counter agreed. When I leave I see I have 11 bagels in the bag (so not a bakers dozen), there's no sesame bagel but plain instead and I have a plain cream cheese. Also I was charged for a dozen bagels and a separate bagel and cream cheese.\\n\\nI live in Attleboro so it's about a 35 minute drive to this place. Today I wanted to give them another shot since the bagel are good. I call up to verify hours and drive 40 min with traffic. I arrive at 12:50 and they are out of bagels. 100% out.

We started with Mac and cheese, and goat cheese balls. It was honestly the best tasting Mac and cheese I've ever had, and goat cheese balls are bomb.com.  We then split a large dark and large white fried chicken dinner. It was everything I expected and more. I've never had REAL fried chicken up until the point. I feel proud to finally know what all the hype has been about. The fried  chicken was cooked to perfection, with a choice of 2 dipping sauces for the side (not really needed as chickens great on its own).

Alden & Harlow is one of these restaurants.  Our server was prompt and kind, answering a few questions and leading off her introduction with the fact that the burger was no longer available.  We ended up ordering the Chips & Three-Onion Dip and Burrata for appetizers, and both were good, but nothing special.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I was having a pleasant enough dinner at Fox Bros. Bar-B-Q when whoops, racism rained on my head from behind. The way I remember it is this: I was enjoying a meal with my husband and one of his best friends from childhood, who we never see. I had just received my plate and had my teeth halfway through a chicken wing. The hostess walked behind our table and chanted, \\"CHING CHONG CHING CHONG.\\"\\n\\nMy husband and I both froze and just stared at each other. My back had been to the hostess, and for around fifteen seconds, we wondered, silently, if it could be innocent. She had chanted it like you might chant \\"Ding dong ding dong,\\" with that sing-song voice. Then she went outside, and when she came back in, she was leading a group of eight Asian-American diners.\\n\\nNot that it matters, but those kids spoke perfect English and clearly lived in the area. I thought about telling them what had happened, as they were at a nearby table, but I decided I didn't want to put a pall over their dinner. My Fox Bros. experience was pretty well ruined by this incident. I was distracted and angry for a lot of the meal, and while I still tasted the food and enjoyed the company of our friend, every minute was tainted. I'm not trying to be dramatic, here--this was the most shockingly racist thing that had happened to me in a while, and it really disturbed me.\\n\\nI didn't talk to the manager, which maybe I should have. Instead I did the passive aggressive internet thing where I tweeted at the restaurant. This was the response: \\n\\n@stephycha not sure why. Our staff doesn't play around. Will look into it.\\n\\n@stephycha we apologize, but apparently you heard the host at the stand trying to have the correct name to call out.\\n\\nHahahaha no. She wasn't standing by herself at the host desk saying, \\"Hm, is it Mr. Ching or is it Mr. Chong?\\" She was singing it. There was no ambiguity. When I pointed this out, I got no reply. This half-assed \\"oh gotta deal with this shit now\\" response was almost worse than the initial offense. The hostess was just one young stupid girl. I imagine whoever runs the Twitter account has 1. more perspective and 2. some kind of PR experience? Anyway, nice fucking try.\\n\\nTo be honest, this whole thing was the kind of automatic fail that would prevent a sane person from reaching the merits of the rest of the restaurant. But since I'm an OCD freak show, I'll tell you whatever else you might want to know.\\n\\nThe wait wasn't bad on a Sunday night. We put our name down, walked around, then got a drink at the bar. Sweetwater IPA on tap. Service, RACISM ASIDE, was very good. Our waitress was friendly and attentive and we left her a full tip. Food was good. Amazing? No. Even RACISM ASIDE, I'd pick Fat Matt's any day. I got the BC plate, which gave me two meals, one for the plane the next day. It came with three portions of meat served with white bread and two sides. I got the pulled pork, the beef brisket (chopped), and the smoked wings, and collard greens and brunswick stew for my sides. I also tried some ribs, mac and cheese, and deep-fried okra. Pulled pork, brisket, wings were good. Ribs were mediocre. Sides were good. Look, I don't feel like going into detail.\\n\\nBecause while it's true that the food tastes good, I will never come here again, and I will actively discourage anyone else from coming.

So, whenever I make a trip somewhere..I always try to find the perfect brunch place. Well, Screen Door definitely did not disappoint me! We drove down to Portland from Seattle on a Sunday and our first stop was Screen Door. We arrived around 11AM and put our name on the waiting list, which the wait was around an hour and a half. If we waited there for an hour and a half I would probablyyy not be so happy with the food because it takes a lot for me to justify such a long wait. They don't take your phone number or anything, so you do actually have to keep track of time. They told us to come back in an hour, so we left the area and went to Powell's Bookstore! :D Although you definitely need more than an hour to explore Powell's...it was a great way to kill time! That made the wait feel like nothing because by the time we got back we only had to actually wait for 15 minutes or so.\\n\\nWe were seated and I instantly took a look at the brunch cocktails. I ordered the Rum Apple Cider...it tasted pretty good although I realized I'm not a HUGE fan of warm alcoholic drinks. My friends ordered the Gin Fizz and Bloody Mary - both were really tasty. \\n\\nFor our brunch entrees we ordered the following:\\n\\nSmoked Brisket Hash: It came with two eggs - which I ordered them over easy  and broke the yolk over the hash. Ahhh perfection. It was delicious! Perfectly seasoned and a hefty amount of brisket, which was cooked to perfection. \\n\\nFried Chicken & Waffles: HUGE portion. Chicken was nice and crispy and paired well with the waffle. Seriously though, the portion size was enormous. Basically three chicken breasts. My sister took most of it to go.\\n\\nFried Oyster Benedict: What a unique combination! And it was executed pretty well. They put the oysters on the side so it doesn't get soggy from the hollandaise sauce. The texture of the oysters were good, but could have used a bit more seasoning. Something was missing to bring all the flavors together. \\n\\nOverall it was a great brunch experience!

If they provided just a little more of the unique parts of the dish I would say it's well worth the money. However, I will return and attempt to try something new.\\n\\nUpdate! I tried something else. I wasn't starving but I was craving Mac and Cheese. Unfortunately this did NOT satisfy that craving. There was nothing Mac and Cheese about it. It as quite bland and should have just been called Penne in a Cream Sauce. And even then it was nothing special and I would never order it again.

The lobster ravioli is really rich and the sauce is so good that I'll have to order extra bread to dip into it. For a shareable side, the mussels are also really great.

To her point, I too have driven past the dated and sun-faded storefront many a time and dismissed it as a struggling (or maybe even closed) dive bar trying to survive in the 21st century.  Sitting on Livingston Avenue, the demilitarized zone between downtown and German Village, it was hard to imagine it as anything but...  silly, silly me.  As a hardened veteran insider of the indie record store culture on High Street for a decade, I should have remembered the ageless maxim: never judge a retail establishment by its cover.  As I discovered, this joint is anything but struggling.\\n\\nOn many levels, Club 185 represents to me the downtown kindred spirit of the Blue Danube restaurant of north campus (R.I.P., old Dube): it is an aging but bustling structure that is half bar and half eatery.  To be fair, I haven't yet been here after my working hours -that's coming soon, thanks to what I'm hearing is a booming happy hour- so I'll stick to what I've seen, which is a packed but speedy lunch hour destination.\\n\\nI won't mince words: 185's menu is the dictionary definition of pub grub -it is what it is, but as we all know, not all pub grub was created equal.  The quality is amazingly good, running the full gamut of soups, sandwiches, appetizers and sides, and my encounters with the Daily Double burger, the spinach salad, Red's Chili and the fried egg sandwich have all been impressive in their own way.  Fresh factor is high, and the prices are reasonable for most items.  My only misgiving is a glaring void in their menu where the words \\"fish and chips\\" should be.  A minor oversight that I'm sure will be rectified soon.  *ahem*\\n\\nI work downtown so my experiences have been limited to noon lunches, which is maybe the best barometer where service is concerned.  Servers handled the rush with ease and relaxed candor, and orders were usually turned around within 10-12 minutes.

I found Cypress on our beloved Yelp while planning my husband's birthday dinner. This was the BEST decision I have made while planning. \\n\\nWe had a table to 12 people and EVERYONE loved their food! For appetizers we got the pretzel, fried mushrooms, and sweet potato chips. I am still drooling thinking about them. The pretzel was so great. I don't know how it was made, but easily the best pretzel I've ever had. I'm going to have to compare every pretzel to that one now. The fried mushrooms were so crispy and had great flavor. I don't know what they put in the batter, but it creates a great texture. My husband says it's the best thing he ate there. The sweet potato chips...I just have to say I love sweet potato in general. And it is hard to make the chips crispy and crunch, but also thick enough to taste the sweet potato flavor.  But Cypress has done it! Delicious! \\n\\nFor the entrees half the guests ordered the sublime burger, which I had a bite of. It had a great balance of sweet and savory from the double donuts and the burger. I ordered the pickleback burger, because I knew my husband would let me have a bite of his sublime hehe. Not as exciting as the sublime obviously, but nonetheless full of flavor! Bacon and sour pickles on a burger are always good.  The best part of the order was the tater tots! Yum!\\n\\nNow the only thing keeping me from giving a 5 star review is the beer availability.  We went on a Saturday night. Wouldn't you think every beer would be in stock? Well we heard \\"we are out of that\\" three times while trying to order beers. I had a great replacement shandy, but I really wanted to try the peach beer on draft. The birthday boy's first pick was out too. \\n\\nOverall great experience with food and service.

If you're watching your diet and appreciate not-XL-portion sizes, I thought 1 combo tapas platter and 1 vase of sangria was a great dinner. The chorizo with cranberry chutney salsa was good, but had a weird aftertaste. I liked the shrimp with roasted garlic chile aioli, smoked jalapeno arepa with black beans, cheese-jalapeno empanada, and spicy roasted pepper stuffed with cheese best, so that's about half the plate. Probably not the best deal for vegetarians because they can only eat half the plate. \\n\\nYou're stuck in the bar so don't come with a big group unless you all come early. 7 of us arrived around 6pm on a Wed. & took up a corner of the bar.

Thank you so much, Portland! \\n\\nWe stopped at Screen Door on our way back home to Sacramento. The first thing I noticed was how cute the place was! It's a decent sized restaurant with an adorable covered patio with seating as well. It was super busy (Tuesday morning) with every table being filled but I never once felt crowded or uncomfortable. We also didn't have a wait time, which I'm guessing was probably only because it was a weekday morning since based on the other reviews it's usually a long wait. \\n\\nI ordered the biscuits and veggie gravy with two eggs over medium. I didn't really know what to expect from the veggie gravy - I've only been a vegetarian for about 7 months and am still learning what options I have. Sacramento is not vegetarian/vegan friendly at all so I was super excited to check out this new option. \\n\\nThe food came and when I dug in I was pretty disappointed with the gravy. It's an overwhelming overload of mushrooms in every bite and there was nothing super \\"gravy\\" about it. It didn't taste horrible, but it wasn't great hence the 4 star rating instead of 5. The name is super misleading and really should be \\"mushroom gravy\\" (or even mushroom slop) instead of veggie. The biscuits were great though and my eggs over medium were absolutely perfect (dare I say even the best I've ever seen? The whites were perfectly cooked and the yolks perfectly runny!). I love the vibe in the place and everything was reasonably priced so I highly recommend giving it a shot, but unless you LOVE LOVE LOVE mushrooms, don't order the veggie gravy."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"There are two different type of noodles, so always make sure to get the one you like, the broth and everything else is pretty good!"},{"name":"Sforno Trattoria Romana","address":"1308 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Mediocre food.

It's an inviting patio, the kind that begs you to come in and enjoy yourself. On Sunday I had an empty stomach, a wide open afternoon, and sunny skies. You can deduce where I ended up.\\n \\nOdd that the patio is so inviting and the entryway is anything but. There's heavy gray drapes that hang down and pool at the floor, feels imposing and slightly pretentious. And this feeling is amplified by the gentleman who clearly sees us but opts to busy himself shuffling menus for a solid minute before acknowledging us. We ask to be seated on the patio and are obliged.\\n \\nIt's glorious out there, just as I had hoped. It delivered on all the promises I'd made for it. The tables are cozy and surrounded by barrels housing wildflowers. It feels so comfortable in the shade while we look over the menu. It's happy hour, a welcome surprise, so we both opt for drinks from the generous list of $5 cocktails. And wait. And wait some more.\\n \\nAnd just when I'm inclined to go find someone, a waitress appears and takes our drink order--a Spicy Paloma and a Prickly Pear Margarita. Minutes later, a second waitress arrives to take our order. We inform her we've already ordered and she looks perplexed while she asks us repeatedly if we are sure we've ordered. I assure her we have. She asks who took it. I tell her a waitress and wonder if I was expected to have gotten her name. Still confused, this second waitress, The Inquisitor, takes leave and we begin the second wait.\\n \\nWhile waiting I can't help but to listen in on the large group seated at the table adjacent to ours. They are frustrated. And not particularly shy about vocalizing their frustration. One woman complains about the food not coming out. She flags a waitress who assures her \\"the fries are coming out soon.\\" I can see a burger in front of her. Customary to have them come out together, I thought. The waitress is visibly bothered by the notion this group of diners is not satisfied waiting for their piecemealed lunch; she's contemptuous and snide with her responses.\\n \\nOur drinks arrive in the atmosphere that's killing the goodness of this patio I've spent too long admiring. I scooch my seat a bit so as to ignore the drama-rama of poor service and pissed patrons at the neighboring table.  I raise my glass to my lips and take a hearty sip. Oh! My! Goodness! What the f-bomb am I drinking? Satan's spit surely has less heat than this almost literal firewater I've been served. Grab an extinguisher and put me out! Put me out! For the love of all that is holy, put me out!\\n \\nSurely the menu said this drink had grapefruit juice in it, yes? Yes! Says so right there. So, whoa, where is it? Because I need it. I'll request it, maybe a remake, but the thing is I have seen the consequences of confronting the staff here and I am wholly unwilling to engage in happy hour warfare with insolent servers. I'll pass on that jibber-jabber. Kay's is just around the corner. It's happy hour there too.

We ordered the spicy edamame, a number 1, and a miso-not (with bamboo added). Along with 2 Sapporos this came out to about 30 bucks. I know everyone raves about the soup, but I wasnt too impressed. Yes, the flavor was good. The noodles was on point. But the broth was simply too rich and cremy for my taste. The edamame wasnt as spicy as I thought. We joked about how we an spend 30 bucks at a Pho place and eat more food and like the broth better. I still recommend people to come here.

We ordered a 6pc soy original wings, their yangnyeom chicken, an order of tteokbokki, and a green salad to share.\\n\\nThe chicken: The soy chicken was our favourite. Crispy, hot, flavourful - the soy marinade flavour soaks all the way to the bone. Very tasty - we wished we had gotten a full order of this instead of the yangnyeom. The yangnyeom was also very good - their cinnamon blend makes it pretty unique. I wasn't sure if I was a fan at first, but the more we ate, the more it grew on us. It IS a bit heavier, as expected of yangnyeom chicken, so we did wish that it came with an option to get a half order or wings rather than the whole chicken.\\n\\nThe tteokbokki: As a lover of spicy food, I enjoyed the kick this had (my friend thought it was a bit too spicy). I do wish the soup was less salty/sweet as it does make the appetizer kind of heavy. Yummy and comforting, nonetheless!\\n\\nThe green salad: Tbh, we could've done without ordering this one. Just a standard salad, nothing really special for the price. I did like the chopped apples in it.\\n\\nWe ended up paying ~$25 a person, which is kind of pricy, but the food was overall good.

Service wasn't bad as some said here- initially our server was attentive, and made got recommendations but he did trail off about mid meal to end meal.  We also felt we made a few attempts or them to come by and it went overlooked...On the positive, he made great recommendations, and the paced the meal well.  It's small plates but one plate came out at a time so we got to enjoy.\\n\\nAnyway.. About the food.  I started with a glass of medium body red Rhone, and my friend.. I forget but she had a white. Maybe pinot grigo? I felt they had a good selection; different.   We had the: \\n\\n- Complimentary pickled green beans with sesame- the sesame was the saver here this was WAY TOO pickled and trust me, I like pickles. It was hard to down. \\n-Burrata with sweet pea hummus - hummus was great; fresh and inventive.  The burrata was a spread-like ricotta; I guess it was different than I was expecting but good. Came on too charred toast.\\n-Corn pancakes- seems experimental with corn bread-like pancakes; legit popcorn, shishito peppers, some kind of sour cream sauce... this was really flavorful and the pancakes the perfect crisp texture and corny flavor\\n-The crispy chicken fried rabbit - DELICIOUS. I don't even like rabbit but this was like a minced rabbit sausage; super tender, juicy and well fried.. very light even though fried.  Plus the side of seasonal veggies made the dish fresh and colorful. Best dish of the night. \\n-Grilled octopus- had high hopes but the dish was so SALTY and the octopus overcooked and too charred.  Came on too charred toast.  It was not the worse but way too salty - seems like lots of things were over brined, over salted as if there was a novice in the kitchen who didn't feel confident in their cooking and couldn't balance (or taste) their food\\n\\nOf course they ran out of the secret burger  - our res was at 9pm.  I had no issues making it on OPT the week before but note, the restaurant was packed so be sure to reserve.  It is a cool, big underground planty space though. Fits in with the seasonal/new American theme.\\n\\nThe other issue I had was that the while small plates does get pricey, the stuff that came on the toast was a bit of a cop out. They should have given two toasts considering we were two people instead of cutting it in half. After all these are $17 dish.. $17 for one thick toast is a bit steep and I'm from NYC. \\n\\nWe ended with the chocolate bread pudding with a dessert and they kindly put in a candle for us since we were celebrating late birthdays. The bread pudding was very very good- flavorful vanilla ice cream, and good gelatin feel to the pudding.\\n\\n$112 for dinner.

I've bought the sauce for years at Heb, and think it's the best I've ever had. Picked up our pre order this morning - whole brisket and rack of ribs, all 3 sides, all 3 desserts. We had to wait for 10 minutes, and then another 20 to drive home. \\n\\nThe brisket was so tender, it was falling apart as I unwrapped it. As others have said, the brisket was the best I ever had. However, you can only eat so much due to all the salt. The pork ribs were also very tender and good - it would be impossible for ribs to be cooked any more perfectly. Again, my only critique is too much salt. \\n\\nThe slaw is a couple steps above the avg bbq stand, and I liked the potato salad which has more mustard than most. I found the beans, however to be too salty. I suspect this is because they mix brisket into the beans. The difference between my opinion of the beans and the meat is that the beans definitely need to be less salty, but they shouldn't change the rub on the meat. \\n\\nThe desserts (banana, pecan, and key lime tart) were all very tasty, with a Graham cracker crust. All were several steps above desserts I had at most bbq joints.\\n\\nI ate at q39 in KC a couple months ago, the meat at franklins was better.

We arrived around 11am on Sunday with a line out the door. This is usually the case but it's not a ridiculous wait, it gives you time to look over the menu and decide what you want to order before you get to the cashier. Seating is limited so there is a chance you'll get your food but won't be able to sit down and eat. This happened before at their first location which was a lot smaller and you just have to wait for someone else to finish up and grab their table. They also don't allow you to grab a table without your food so keep that in mind. \\n\\nEvery Sunday they have a special brunch menu with rotating items.

You must come here for this experience!  I came here for a late-night dinner date.\\n\\nRESTAURANT: Vibes were hella cute.  Place had a great ambiance, dimly-lit, exposed brick; all the trimmings of yuppie foodie culture!  One of the art pieces on the wall said, \\"The People's Drug\\", which I thought was appropriate because the food was so DARN GOOD.\\n\\nSERVICE: The service was impeccable and attentive like restaurants like these usually are.  But what struck me and my date the most was their timing -- aka PERFECT!  They give you the exact time you need for each dish.  The next dish doesn't come too soon, and either get cold sitting on your table, or force you to wolf down your meal (or come too late and leave you feeling sad and hungry.)  Great job, A&H.\\n\\nDRINKS: We ordered 1) Suit and Thai ($14), 2) Duckhunter ($13), and later on 3) Rum through the Jungle ($12).  All really good.  Duckhunter stood out with its strong foie gras flavor -- really interesting in a whiskey drink.\\n\\nFOOD: We ordered two small plates and three large plates.\\n\\nThe small plates: 1) the Burrata ($8), and 2) the Chicken Liver Toast ($8).  \\n\\n#1: The Burrata was pretty standard.  Not bad, but nothing worth raving about. \\n\\n#2: The Chicken Liver Toast may as well have changed my life.  THE FLAVORS.  THE TEXTURES.  I don't think it's on the menu anymore (idk why?), but this toast both melted in your mouth yet had bite.  It was sprinkled with some blueberries and nuts, so refreshing and tempering (respectively) in a rich dish!  We were literally groaning after every bite -- probs made a few people uncomfortable.  But I digress.\\n\\nThe large plates: 1) Wellfleet Countneck Clams ($16), 2) Anson Mills Hush Puppies ($15), and 3) Crispy Berkshire Pork Belly ($16).  Each deserve their own paragraph of worship.\\n\\n#1: The Countneck Clams were SO good.  Not only were they stuffed with flavor from the tangy, refreshing parsley sauce, but the freaking PIG'S TAIL.  My date and I were joking that we were having quite the strange dinner with chicken liver and now pig's tail, but I will now leap to order pig's tail whenever I see it on the menu, because it is like bacon but SO MUCH better.  Just all this ~flavor~ saturated into a tiny piece of meat.  Spreading that meat and parsley on the little slices of toast was just DIVINE. \\n\\n#2: The Hush Puppies at first bite felt too salty too me; the bacon was overpowering.  But upon eating my second bite with a bit of the rhubarb jam that was dolloped elsewhere on the plate, I understood the thought behind the dish.  The meat was definitely still salty, but not at all in an unbearable way -- it became more like having something really umami.  The sweetness of the rhubarb jam made it an intriguing combo.\\n\\n#3: The Pork Belly was SO fat and crispy, how I think every pork belly should be.  It was so darn rich, it felt almost sinful, but I didn't care because it's melt-in-your-mouth goodness made it worth every bite.  By this time, my date and I were both so full, but the pork belly was so good we ate ourselves into oblivion.\\n\\nIN SUM: Please go to Alden & Harlow for dinner!  I think most of the reviews on Yelp talk about it for brunch (which I scouted out when I made my first reservation and will sure try out eventually), but I think the creativity and intention behind the dishes they serve at dinner are also deserving of attention.

The special on Thursday was the scallop taco, these tacos were great nice chunks of wild caught scallops served with spicy Serrano and poblano peppers.  These were very good, but almost too spicy.  We also ordered two carne Asada tacos, which were ok, I have had much better marinated Asada in other taqueria's, I have been too.  My wife ordered a steak fajita taco with cheese served with queso flamidio.  My wife liked this taco more than the carne Asada.  My son ordered the queso and chips which he seemed to enjoy.  This place claims to serve locally sourced sustainable ingredients.  It is funny, no matter the restaurant, the more sustainable the food is the more expensive it tends to be.  For 5 tacos, two drinks, and one queso and chips the total bill was $34, a little ridiculous if you ask me, especially since torchy's charges a similar price for a much bigger taco with just as much quality.  What, I really did like about this place were the salsa choices, which is much better than torchy's.

Amazing presentation but diving into the bowl, I am met with many characters that are lacking in a good bowl of noodle soup. The soup is milky and thick, but the gamey taste of pork and blood are still prominent in the broth. They need to clean the bones better to avoid that disturbing taste. The noodles weren't cooked to al dente. And overall, the dish was salty.  \\n\\nThe gyoza was not crispy as the cashier said it was, having the consistancy of an old eggroll that's steaming in a Chinese takeout box. The korokke was on the salty side as well but would have been enjoyable if it wasn't for more salt in the recipe.

Oh, and there's one of those for the entire restaurant, so when they tell you to take you time ordering, they mean please order within 3 minutes of sitting down without any information because we have to give your menu to the only other patrons in the place. My cousin ordered butternut squash soup. There was a picture out front similar to the one in the photo section on yelp, which is standard butternut squash soup. This was a watery broth with a spicy salsa mixed in. Apparently it had a bland carrot taste, but b. squash it was not. The Asian fresh rolls were listed as 10.95 and when they arrived were 5 teeny tiny rolled up seaweed pieces that were smothered in oil and absolutely did not match the description listed or the picture below it. I ordered the spinach, tomato and goat cheese crepe. For a crepe place, she doesn't understand that a sweet crepe doesn't go with savory food. Also, it was a pancake, not a crepe. So that was awkward. I should mention that prior to getting our food, another man was unhappy and had an altercation with the owner/cook/psycho behind the counter, and the table next to us asked her to please not complete the order and just serve what she's started as they're unsatisfied with the service, time, atmosphere, etc. Then our bill comes. $33.00. We ask, along with others, where these prices are listed. Crazy explains they're absolutely listed on the menu, but can't and won't show us where. She proceeded to tell us how and why our bill is this price, but without anything listed and insisted that at any restaurant, you're to ask for prices, descriptions, etc. What? \\n\\nDon't be fooled by the initial cheerful facade upon entering.

I actually can't wait to go back and try more of their menu I didn't get to yet!\\n\\nI will start with the bad and then end with all of the tasty goodness. The bad? Well the scallop special crudo. I love scallops. Love them. But this dish, especially for being a special, was so so so so fishy tasting! It is a small dish and our group of 5 actually had trouble finishing it because I think we all wanted to focus our attention on other food dishes that were better. So boo to the scallops. I also am not a mushroom fan in general, but our group got that dish with a pine nut crumble and it was only so so as well, which is a shame for how pricey pine nuts are!\\n\\nBUT the butternut squash salad was amazing and I need to know get a machine that will cut up my butternutsquash just like that so I can make that fresh tasting salad with a little pecorino and hazelnuts....And then there was the fried shortrib special. Wow. Those ribs I would have loved to have had a whole order of! There was not quite 6 in an order like they said since one rib was two little ones next to each other, but the soy glaze on there was awesome. Then the corn pancakes with those fried shishito peppers? Yes, please! That was a dish that was hard to share too! Next time, we will order two orders of that for our group of 5 :-) And there there was the burger they call the \\"secret burger\\" which I don't really get since it is on the menu smack dab in the middle. They are limited and we ate at 7:30pm on a Friday and there was only 10 left, so we quickly reserved two before even ordering drinks! And it was a good burger that was juicy and had this smoky flavor to it and I loved the housemade bun it was on. \\n\\nThe most incredible dish I thought was the rye pasta with chicken confit with crispy skin, liver butter and figs. SO RICH AND SO DELICIOUS. I mean seriously! I didn't want to share this dish but had to because it was that rich, but you also need to have some of this if you come here. The flavors were all so different and yet went together in this unique burst of flavor in each bite. Good job, Alden and Harlow.

I paid a little over $13 for a full plate of steak, veggies, fried rice, and noodles. Also came with ginger salad and miso soup on the side. That is the dinner pricing. Lunch is a few dollars cheaper. If you are expecting to leave with a full belly for a decent price, this is the place for you. If you want food that is full of flavor, you might have to go elsewhere. Besides the quantity of food, another positive would be the service. Usually at fast-casual places like this, I find the service to be pretty mediocre. However at this particular location, you are greeted with warm smiles as soon as you enter the door. I was seriously shocked by the friendly service. \\n\\nSo the food itself was alright. It was certainly a step up from Chinese buffet hibachi, but nothing that blew my mind. The flavors were somewhat bland, but I drenched everything in white sauce so that made up for it.

However, life has had an interesting way of bringing me into Boston at two occasions in my life, and both times in Boston, I had the opportunity to not only stop in here, but also to peruse all of the offerings at The Butcherie. \\n\\nWhile we have dozens of kosher stores in Brooklyn, where one can find everything from parve cheese doodles, to cholov yisroel cappuccino beverages, kosher Dunkin Donuts and Krispy Kreme, to glatt kosher kibbeh and vegan dim sum, acheinu bnei yisrael living in New England lack these options. The Butcherie is their lifeline to Jewish observance, as it is the only kosher market in the region, and its selection and quality impress even this jaded New Yorker; deli, wines, cheeses, frozen foods, plenty of Israeli imports, and many other kosher specialties. \\n\\nI find that the Butcherie's prepared foods are excellent and the quality is superb and prices not outrageous for an out-of-town establishment. My one and only complaint is that their hours are not friendly to tourists or night owls, but that seems to be a trend in Boston, regardless (the city is dead at 9 pm, whereas NYC is bustling 24/7). \\n\\nI have had the opportunity to sample several of their specialties, including the New England favorite, American Chop Suey; this concoction of chopped meat, tomatoes, and elbow macaroni bears no resemblance to the Chinese original, but the Butcherie's version, I'm sure, presents this dish in its fullest simplicity and allows us kosher keepers to sample regional offerings we wouldn't otherwise have access to. \\n\\nThe parve cheese noodle kugel reminds me of my own version of this dish (one can tell that they've used quality parve sour cream, cream cheese, and margarine in making this dish as close to its dairy counterpart as possible), the chunky chicken soup is as heimish as can be (although it requires salt), and the knishes are all scrumptious, with a flaky dough; the beef knishes (both American and Jerusalem) and the spinach and cheese knish are excellent (At separate meals, of course!) and they rival many of the knishes we have in Brooklyn. \\n\\nLikewise, their parve cheese blintzes are excellent, and the other prepared foods available are mind-boggling. The variety of prepared foods is astounding, and I've sampled the following: Parve tofu balls taste very close to their fleshig cousins, the beef pot pie is a true mechaye, treat, and the veal cutlets and patties are to die for. \\n\\nTheir Passover menu looks absolutely impressive, and perhaps a day trip to Boston may be in order before Pesach to sample these offerings, including chicken pot pie, chicken cacciatore, kreplach, couscous, veal patties, and other delights none of the Pesach stores in Brooklyn carry."},{"name":"Elisa","address":"1109 Hamilton Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"Top Table Group!!!!

I even planned an entire evening there because my friends and I were visiting Oregon for the hiking and just to enjoy a plain girls trip. \\n\\nMuch to my dismay, sadness, and sheer disappointment...I really did not enjoy this place. \\n\\nThe food is not southern in it's purest form. I am a Texan girl. Maybe that's my fatal flaw. I went to Portland thinking I could get great Southern cooking. But now, alas...no. I had the fried chicken, my friends had the burger and the North Carolina pulled pork sandwich. With the exception of the burger, nothing was really as it should be. \\n\\nFIrst of all, my friend is from North Carolina. Grew up there her whole life. This was not North Carolina inspired barbecue. The sandwich we received was bland, the coleslaw was watery and dripping even more water onto the pulled pork, and there was no vinegar-y tang which is the defining factor in Carolina based barbecue. Me being from Texas, I don't care for Carolina barbecue (tomato based sauce all the way) but even I knew this sandwich was bland. First strike. \\n\\nMy fried chicken was okay. The chicken was admittedly fried well. It was juicy, well breaded, and hot from the kitchen. Can't complain there. But the chicken itself had no flavor. I HATE doing this but I've had more flavorful chicken from Popeye's...which, IMO, does a pretty good representation of cajun cooking. The greens were sour and lacked that hint of bitterness I was hoping to get. More sour than bitter, which just seemed all wrong. There was no resonance of herbs or flavorings. Just sour. The mashed potatoes were flavorless. I couldn't even taste the butter or the cream, which I know they must have used. I'm from the south! I know mashed potatoes. The gravy, which was supposed to be made from ham drippings, lacked all the well-rounded porcine flavors that I love. Instead, it was bland...and the only discerning flavor I could find was cayenne pepper. It tasted like it was thrown in as an afterthought rather than as a complement. Strike two. \\n\\nThe burger was tasty, not cooked to order, with a passable level of crisp fries. But honestly, how can you mess with a burger? \\n\\nAll in all, I'm sorry Screen Door. Despite coming 15 minutes prior to opening time, waiting in your line, getting seated out on the patio on a 50 degree day...I still couldn't love your food. I really did try.

The brisket chili was also very flavorful and the side salad was a generous size and therefore quite filling. Our table split an order of jalapeno poppers based on friend and yelp recommendations, which come in a set of 4; and they were filled with meat, to our surprise. A good surprise though; they were pretty delicious though I probably wouldn't order them again. \\n\\nWe waited over an hour for our table Saturday night; and it was absolutely pouring outside so we, and everyone else, was crammed inside to wait.

Porter is everything wrong with New Austin, all rolled up in one.  I saw the 3 $ price category before going in, and thought...  Well this will be interesting...  For a gastropub in Austin in 2014.   Got lucky with rockstar parking right in front; this was the only truly good part of the experience.  Went in the first obvious set of doors, no one greeted me, it wasn't clear where to go.  No worries, when in doubt, hit the bar.  As I walked up I saw a few seats across the bar at the window, and was feeling that more than bar seating on this particular night.  Took my seat and noticed a host station in the corner between 2 other sets of doors; that must have been where I was supposed to come in?  Oh well, whatever.  Now... How to get someone's attention so I can actually order something?  Well... The bartenders were too far away, I looked two of them right in the eye, returned only with an albacore stare.  Two other \\"worky\\" looking people passed, one even said hi to me, but 15 minutes later and no one who earns money at this establishment has offered me a product or service for which I can PAY money.  Ok...  Now to the actual stuff they serve...  It ends here - a FOURTEEN DOLLAR HAMBURGER??!  What in the fuck?  Does it give me a blowjob too?  Scratch that, I get blowjobs for free.   So what in the world could POSSIBLY be so good about this burger that I'm going to pay 14 hard-earned bones for it??!  This place is just insulting their customers with this shit: \\"We know you're desperate to fit in, to look like you have made it in New Austin, and when we ram a check for 30 dollars for 2 burgers up your account, you're going to thank us and ask for less cheese next time!\\"  Uh... No.  And for a place called PORTER, you would expect a stellar beer selection.  They had some good ones, but nothing special compared to oh, pretty much every other place in Austin now.  My guess is this place is a hit for the condo dwelling douches taking over this city.  Fuck 'em, they can have it!  I'm happily writing this review with an equally good beer (Ballast Point Victory at Sea) and burger at Black Sheep, and at half the price.

I was greeted as soon as I got in the restaurant and sat at the bar. So while the restaurant is ramen-based, there are several appetizer options. I got the Gyoza to start. It was a bit too well done, but still good. I ordered the Ramen I came for, with a few extras. It was really good!

I don't think they tow in the parking lot in front of and behind Matt's, but surrounding businesses might.\\n\\nThe line will be long. I think a few television shows have featured Fat Matt's and it's gotten pretty popular over the years. If you're going on a sunny afternoon or on the weekend, expect the line to be out of the door.\\n\\nService isn't spectacular, and I honestly don't expect it to be. It's not fine dining, it's a shack.\\n\\nBut I'm never disappointed when I come to Fat Matt's. I've had their ribs, chicken, and pulled pork and they were all delicious. The menu is a la carte, but for less than $20 you can get nice sized portions, a drink, and amazing music.\\n\\nMy latest visit stood out to me because there was an older woman playing her heart out on the guitar. She sang Ray Charles \\"What I'd Say\\" and the entire restaurant joined into the call and response part. I got a short video for my snap chat, ate half of my rib sandwich, and went home.\\n\\nAs I'm scrolling through my Facebook timeline I see a video about Beverly \\"Guitar\\" Watkins. I instantly got excited because I had experienced a legend on a Saturday when I just wanted barbecue.\\n\\nThat's what keeps me coming back. The food is good, but the live blues music is awesome.

This is what we grew up on! :) Also, just to note, we were in the second to left lane and the people in the far left lane had to keep walking through our group to get to their lane. That was just a minor inconvenience though. \\nThe pizzas were really good and I like that they cut them into strips because we got four pizzas and it was easy to try each of them, and we could quickly eat a slice before it was our turn to bowl.

It was a giant slice of savory (with a dash of sweet) heaven atop a delightful side salad spiced up with radishes and an olive oil dressing. And a fist sized bread roll. Sourdough I think? Doesn't matter, it was a clear indication that any bread or bread-related item from Tatte would be excellent. \\n\\nEnter my next visit. The Balakani (eggplant, feta, pesto) served on brioche instead of the standard ciabatta (I wanted the sunflower wheat sourdough but they were all out, sad face). So damn good! Funny thing is, I generally don't like brioche. But I saw it sitting in the display case and it looked so puffy and flaky and buttery that when the friendly cashier offered it, there was no turning it down. And I'm glad I didn't! Best brioche I've tried. The sandwich was a tad salty - probably the feta or maybe the pesto - but not so much so that it took away from the flavor. I would easily order it again (like, tomorrow), but there are so many other dishes to try first. Love this new addition to the neighborhood!\\n\\nThe cakes and pies look otherworldly. That Belgian chocolate mousse cake? Yes please! Halva bomb cake? Don't mind if I do! I definitely want to try the meringues and the cream cheese croissant, too.

The Babba Kush is like a Taco Bell doubledecker shell with pulled pork filling and it's huge! \\n\\nI think I was most impressed with the cost. $4 for a craft taco is pretty typical but they don't skimp on fillings. I could have easily filled up on two tacos, yet alone all the chips and queso! \\n\\nFinally I really appreciated how they do the orders and bill.

I ordered the dynamic duo burger, and once again, sadly, it was cold. I didn't even take a bite. My boyfriend and I were under the impression that the taste explosion was a burger, not a roll. Our server didn't explain that to us either. I would of appreciated if she had put a little more attention in making sure our meals came out hot considering all the issues with cold food. She never delivered any of our food. The managers reasoning was that no one was running food. Sucks to have this type of experience for the first time some where.

The barista was very friendly and was open to conversing with us about the business. He said this place has been open for about 4 years and used to have a little shop in the back. You can see that they are renovating right now after the shop parted ways. Either way, you come here for the coffee and the ambiance. The baristas make some killer signature coffees. I wasn't even sure what to order. Originally I wanted a Matcha but decided on the Vermont with Oat Milk. Good choice. My boyfriend went with the Tom Boy with Almond Milk which was also a good choice. The foam was very thick. We also picked up some of the house blend whole beans roasted here in Portland. They have two types, the high-performance which is more of a light roast and the Widow Maker which is a more fully bodied dark roast.

We were lucky enough to have Safe as our waitress and she was great. Had amazing suggestions when we needed them and made her rounds constantly to make sure we were always all set and taken care off. \\n\\nParking- there is a garage in the back and I asked our waitress who says they actually validate the for you and therefore ends up being free. Right across the street there is tons of street 2-hour parking. That's where i parked and I was nervous since I definitely spent more than 2 hours there but a few of my coworkers did the same and we had no issues. \\n\\nBowling: this is not regular bowling, it's candle pin bowling. To be honest, it was my first time and it was a complete blast! The rules are a little different but it's still bowling for the most part! We payed the regular rate of $30 per lane per hour which I honestly thought was a great deal. (If you go with friends, you can always split this!) Shoes were clean and they had every size we needed. \\n\\nFood- we tried just about 8 of their different flatbreads and they were all delicious! I honestly cannot say I didn't like any of them. Every single one was cooked to perfection and full of flavors you usually don't expect from pizza. They are cooked in these fire domes that are in public view so it's awesome to watch them make your pizza and then watch them cook in the domes! \\n\\nDrinks- they have a large selection of beer which is all that our party partook in.

This can be overwhelming for some, as there is such a variety. Don't worry though, Condado has a pre-made taco sheet you can choose from or even reference to help concoct your own. I recommended thinking of flavors you like together or even asking for help from your server. I recommend two tacos for dinner, especially if your getting chips/apps. The portions are always a great size and they have very tasty guac, queso and chips. I love the variety and that they even have different guacs of the month. Don't forget to order a marg or two with dinner as well! \\nAs for me, I ordered the purple haze bowl which had tofu, purple cabbage, black beans, rice, tomatoes. I also ordered a vegetarian taco with portobellos and I subbed the sweet Lucy shell (guac, queso, hard and soft shell- amazing! Get it with at least 1 taco!) My taco came out with chorizo on it, after I took a bite or two, which I then noticed. I returned it and our server was super nice about it. They quickly remade the taco and comped all of my food and even gave me a gift certificate for next time! It was way above and beyond and I am so impressed with the service. I felt bad being that annoying person, but they made me feel like it wasn't a big deal and the manager came out and apologized.

Completely old, stale and freezer burn tasting.  It actually smelled like a freezer which is never a good thing to build a sandwich around.  You just simply can't have a good sandwhich without good bread regardless of what is inside of it.  \\n\\nThe filling was slightly better than the bread, but the pork wasn't charred, tender or even very flavorful at all.  Nothing about the sandwich was good, to be honest, other than the jalapeno and cilantro weren't somehow destroyed.  Just a dry, stale sandwich on par with Dang Bahn Mi for the worst I've had, unfortunately.  \\n\\nThe pre packed rice, chicken and sausage seemed like a safe bet, but even this tasted unfresh and strange.  The rice was beyond japanese style sticky rice and was completely congealed together as if it were one entity and not made up of individual grains.  Just a horrendous gelatinous texture that was difficult to even cut through, topped with with leftover quality room temperature shredded chicken and a few sausage slices with a very strange sweetness about it.  \\n\\nWhen this many people have terrible experiences somewhere, there is usually something to it and despite the prices being really cheap, I'd happy pay double or triple elsewhere for something fresh and flavorful.  I'd highly recommend to look elsewhere for bahn mis, and start with NG BMT.  The prepacked food doesn't make me want to try anything else either...  A reluctant and borderline 2 stars for me."},{"name":"The Hideaway Bar","address":"516 Virginia Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Dood\\nBest dive bar of my year!\\n\\nCome down and get yer drank on yall\\n\\nBeer me, foodie, great music and conversation\\n\\nYou definitely can't go wrong with this spot"},{"name":"Jerry's Pizza","address":"300 St Laurent St, Ste 128","city":"Longwood","stars":"3","text":"This has been our favorite pizza place for 10+ years but we went a few months ago and were really disappointed.

This could be remedied by cutting it smaller.  I split a firecracker roll and it was spicy and delicious but like it said cut too big.  Also split an order of Parmesan bacon truffle fries and the truffle oil on the really makes that appetizer so special.  I had the black and Brie burger and it was incredibly tasty and recommended it to anyone that loves Brie and blackberries. It takes a burger to a whole new level.

Their menu is very innovative I will say; cheesecake French toast is unique and so are their breakfast poutines. I tried the poutines and tho they are filling, I didn't find anything special other than the idea of the dish. I went back a second time to try a breakfast platter of blueberry chicken sausages, two eggs, French toast, and potatoes. It was very good and filling and you could taste good ingredients. However I just wish the prices weren't so high. For $20 yes it is filling but I already expected that to begin with. I would prefer to pay $15 on average mostly because that's already in the middle for most brunch places and I would consider the quality of food about in the middle."},{"name":"Fuji At WoC","address":"1420 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"4.5","text":"Exceptional.

Casual, open layout, good mix of alt/indie/punk music the few times I've been able to sit and work. The only negative (for me) is the lack of seating. If you're more of the take-out or drive-thru coffee customer, this won't be a problem for you. For me, if a coffee shop doesn't fit into my work schedule, I'll go somewhere that allows me to multitask.\\n\\nNot sure if it's mostly students camped out all day, or just a steady stream of people coming and going. Nevertheless, all tables are taken 90% of the time I go, so I rarely bother anymore. My roommate has experienced the same thing, having to leave and go somewhere with seating to work. We both have traditional offices, but 2-4 days per week each of us is able to work remotely in the afternoons. So it's also a brief change of scenery in our workday, not just coffee to go.

So let me paint a quick picture for you: Saturday...midday...huge party...AND we came a bit late to our reservation. What we expected was to be turned down or given a huge wait time. Opposite. We were greeted so graciously and even celebrated/congratulated at the door. We did have to wait a few, but we had no problem w that. Being that we had no issue w the host upon initial contact and her thorough communication w us, we actually didn't mind. We sat outside in the porch area and chatted. (We also really, really wanted to eat here.) After about maybe 15 minutes, our party of maybe 11-13, at the time, were seated. The food was GREAT. I have a tendency to eat off of my partner's plate almost everywhere we go (lol I'm so glad he doesn't mind) but his food was better than mine, which I was even more pleased by. \\nOur table was served with bottomless mimosas and peach bellinis, which were BOMB. I had the fried chicken with mash and collard greens. Amazing. I like my food scorching hot when it arrives; it was just that. I can't remember what all everyone had, but it was so delicious. Some even ordered a second serving to-go. Our waiter was so lively and knew exactly how to serve. Yes! His recommendations were spot-on too. Ugh, so sad I can't remember his name. \\nNonetheless, it is such a cute brunch spot. Seating upstairs and downstairs. Seating upstairs may be a bit more room. \\nOnly downside I can think of is that the building only has 1 bathroom that they have upstairs, so you have to wait for one to leave so you can enter.

Their steaks were amazing - I think it is probably one of the few places in Vancouver where you can get Wagyu. An incredibly romantic interior, optimal for date nights with their wooden beams, floor to ceiling wine cellar, semi open concept kitchen and a beautiful bar. You might even be able to spot a celebrity or two since a Canuck was beside my table!\\n\\nBe prepared to spend a long night here because your steaks can take 45 minutes to an hour, which is why appetizers are strongly recommended. Our tartare dish was amazingly fresh but lacked a proper ratio of crackers, so we had to ask for bread.\\n\\nNow the recommended steak portion is 5 to 7 oz (you order by the ounce and from what I remember, there is a minimum). Their steaks do not include anything else, so if you want sides, you will have to order about 4-5 to share with a table of four people. I loved all of our choices - the truffle mac and cheese, risotto, broccolini and roasted brussels sprouts. Paired with a fine sweet wine from Napa (I forget the name) - but it was a genuine surprise when the bill arrived because I didn't realize the bottle was $$$!\\n\\nI had a fantastic experience here with the birthday dessert which was a mini Baked Alaska featuring banana ice cream and some small chocolates and baked goods/macarons  on the side.\\n\\nPrice was the only thing precluding me from giving 5 stars but not a bad place to splurge for a night of fine dining."},{"name":"Dead Lizard Brewing Company","address":"4507 SW 36th St, Ste C","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"It's great to have more craft breweries in Orlando!

I say take away because they have non-staffed picnic tables outside that you can use after ordering your food at the pick up window.\\n\\nThe Big Tasty and the bacon cheeseburger are the two varieties I have tried and both are very good.  Again, definitely comparable to some of the other well known fast casual chains.\\n\\nI like that they offer shoestring onion rings.

This was the first time I've ever been to a Ruby Tuesday's and definitely the last. First off the whole place gives off a dirty, dingy, depressing vibe.  It feels very 90's but not in a good way. Second of all the staff was bizarre. Just unsure of themselves,  not rude but not very helpful. Our waiter was a nice guy but spoke so softly and mumbled that we could barely understand him. The menu leaves a lot to be desired. We both ordered the salad bar--which was the best part of the meal actually. Not a big buffet fan because of cleanliness but was super hungry. It wasn't necessarily clean and organized nicely, but the salad wasn't terrible (the dressings grossed me out though--they looked old like they had been sitting out since that morning and were messy). It just got worse from there. My fianc√© ordered just a cheeseburger medium rare and french fries. I ordered a pesto vegetable pasta. Pretty easy orders--hard to mess up. Unfortunately his burger was practically bleeding... it was so raw you could still hear it moo-ing. His fries were so salty they made my mouth burn. As for my food--I am a huge pasta fan. I could eat it day and night. There aren't many pasta dishes that I don't love. But the noodles were so soft and soggy and the pesto sauce was flavorless. It honestly tasted like they heated up a lean cuisine microwaveable dinner. We kindly let our server know about the burger issue but didn't say anything else about the food--I'm sure he could tell by the lack of food eaten. He was apologetic but didn't seemed surprised that the burger was cooked poorly. He did take it off the bill for us considering he took one bite.\\nWe got the lemon blueberry cheesecake because we were still hungry and hoping we could turn it around. Like the salad, it wasn't good but not horrible. It tasted a bit frozen still.\\nOverall, it's a sad place to eat and definitely won't be going back. They need a complete brand overhaul in my opinion."},{"name":"Buttermilk & Bourbon","address":"160 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Dim lighting here and decorations were definitely similar to new orleans.
