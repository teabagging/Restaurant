For me, the atmosphere at b. side is a bit of the good and the bad - when they open the front windows wide and you can hear the noise of Pearl Street (but far enough away to be just a murmur), and the breeze blows in, it can be lovely - particularly with these mild summer nights we've been having.  I even kind of dig the red walls.  I like the layout of the room, some private little areas, or you can get up close and personal at the bar.  On the other hand, the artwork and decor are a bit odd - a little bit funky cool, a little bit garage sale.  Still, the restrooms are always clean and there's plenty of soap and paper towels (I have a toddler, I notice these things, I can't help it).I love the drinks and the food.  Stella on tap, delicious martinis (used to be $5 during trivia, we were just told last night that they've gone up to $6), and really pretty good food.  We've had the super garlicky pizza and the pepperoni, the burger, the spinach pie - loved them all.  The prices are pretty reasonable, too - and they're even better if you're there on trivia night, when they give out gift cards for 1st, 2nd and 3rd place!  I haven't been anywhere else in town that does that for us.The first time we went, they were a bit overwhelmed, I think someone didn't show up for work and the bartender was trying to cover the whole place herself.

Instead of them giving her the extras she ordered in a separate bowl to make everything right.... They asked me to take the extras out from my bowl and put them in her ramen bowl since I didn't pay for them. So I had to take a spoon to dig out random extra ingredients to stick in her bowl after I'd already taken a few bites. The appropriate response to that would have been to give her the extra stuff she ordered in a separate plate and not have a customer dig stuff out of a soup bowl.

We had an excellent time. I used to work in a restaurant, so I think that people who complain about a desert plate placed too far away and a finger print on a plate are absolutely draconian(talking about a previous review I read). The reason for the 2 stars has to do with A. The ambience \\nB. The quality of the menu vs price\\nC. My personal experience. I like to eat at all kinds of restaurants, but this place has high end prices, so I expect a little more elegant experience. The volume of the noise can be likened to a theme park cafe. I don't know how that could be controlled, but my favorite restaurants, rusty spoon and kres, both have what I'm looking for in environment when eating at an upper end restaurant. My husband and I each got a drink, but his old fashioned had to be altered because the server said they had run out of an ingredient. I got sea bass because I knew that otherwise I would be spending the same amount of money for a steak with no sides. The non steak dishes are the only ones that have non protein elements. My husband and friend adored their steaks. I tried a bite of both and they were to die for. They got fries on the side which we shared, but I was hoping for more than just ketchup. A creative sauce maybe?My sea bass was unfortunately served raw and refrigerator cold :(. Mistakes happen and I understand that. The manager came up to our table and apologized, then she brought us out another side of fries while I waited for my fish to be cooked. They then comped our deserts, which was very nice - I didn't ask for any of these things mind you because I know this was a simple mistake. When it came back I still did not think it was a very creative dish though. I did not like the crispy potatoes on top - they are more like French fries(but the fries are better). Maybe they got over crunchy when they cooked the fish again? My friend and I both got desert, my husband was too full from his steak. I got the turtle pie, she got the lava cake. I tried a bite of her cake, and it was definitely delicious. My pie kind of had a chocolate pudding consistency that I did not care too much for, and not barely enough of that sensational caramel! Very tasty, however I recall the s'more cake at rusty spoon and the bread pudding at kres, and am left wanting!Anyway we had a great time! Had I not been juiced up on a Manhattan I probably would have felt more impatient...we waited a while to put in our order. Our server was Sean and he was very nice and attentive even though the place was packed and I am sure he was flustered by the things that went wrong. They gave my friend truffles, a birthday card signed by the staff, and a $25 gift card for her birthday...that's awesome! All of that being said however...I won't be going back, simply because other restaurants in the area offer a more creative menu, better ambience, an absolute wow factor on taste on all menu items (Kres), and for about $20 less on average per person.

The waitress came out with menus and never took notice our table was filthy. I was raised in San Diego and am well famliar with Mexican food. Knowing the measure of true Mexican cookery, I ordered tacos al carbon with rice and beans, and a chicken tamale. The tamale came first and was a disaster wrapped in a banana leaf instead of a corn husk. It was filled with what appeared to be chicken pot pie filling. It was mushy, with potatoes and green beens in the mix. The masa was weak, thin, and soggy. My friend ordered a quesadilla with beef, as well as a burrito. The quesadilla was greasy,  but okay. The chicken and bean burrito had an abundance of sour cream and cheese and was also just okay. Ten minutes after we came in, a very noisy Mexican family came in and were served their food 15 minutes BEFORE we received the rest of ours. We spent a lot of time waiting despite being only one of three tables occupied. My tacos al carbon were pretty good. The guacamole was fresh as was the pico de gallo. The meat was lightly seasoned and not too fatty or overcooked. Altogether, I give this restaurant really bad marks for cleanliness, service, and effort. It was humiliating to be so obviously ignored over the other group who came in after we had already been waiting. Again, I worry about the cleanliness. They allowed young boys to crawl all over the tables and the booths, leaving messy handprints of food wherever they went. Our table was already covered in somone elses slopped refried beans and whatever else the sticky mess was. There is no excuse for that when the restaurant was nearly empty. It is just plain laziness.

Ordered a broccoli cheddar soup in a bread bowl one day, I picked it up and didn't check, got to work and it was a cup w/o the bread bowl and just with a piece of bread. I told the manager the next time I was in and she gave me $10 credit.

They do serve food and alcohol here and the group had plenty of orders for both. All seemed to arrive pretty quickly after orders were placed. We rented lanes by the hour, rather than per game which was nice.  It was a pretty typical afternoon bowling alley crowd with families, kids having birthday parties and adults bowling.

I wanted to check out one of these locations. This one's in north Columbus near lots of other stuff. It's nice inside as expected. The service is okay but should be great at a place like this. I was interested in the wine flight because that would be the best money saver. It depends on the wines you choose. The wine flights are about somewhere from $9 to $10. It had nothing on the food menu interesting. The food menu is mostly standard Italian. It pairs food with wines on the menu so that's a nice touch. The portion sizes all looked very small. It looks like the food is an afterthought. That's okay because the wine is expensive so that's less to pay for. I would only be interested in the wines at The Wine Bistro.

I love the inventive cocktails. The menu is fun and and has a reasonable approachable price point. This low review was entirely brought on by the male Host on evening of 1/20/18. Party of three women arrived ~6:30pm on a Saturday and there were plenty of open tables. We were gruffly told by host that the restaurant was \\"overbooked\\" for the night and only bar seating available. It was confusing to us what exactly constituted bar seating (there are nice high tops in addition to bar...still unclear to me)  but the host was inpatient with us and walked away. I had to re-initiate the conversation when he returned and was ignoring us. I explained that as a party of three it would be difficult to converse at a bar, thus we would be willing to wait for a table. He scoffed at me rudely and said there would be \\"over a 2 hour wait\\" for such a request. I'll stop here and just point out we are not in NYC and we are not even in downtown in ATX or at a newly opened much talked about restaurant. Also it is early bird dinner time! This is not even HH for this place! Is adding our name to a dinner table request list at 6:30pm (early for Austin) such a tall order at an \\"ok\\" restaurant in a shopping center outside of downtown that has been open over five years?! I dined a week ago on a Friday night at 6:30pm at Kemuri - labeled the best and hottest new restaurant in Austin this year!! (amazing) - and there was no wait! Alas, we gave in, never spoke to the host again, and walked ourself to a high top near the bar. The bar tender took over and the night went up from there. Kuddos to the tall gentleman at the bar who served with grace and humor. Btw the restaurant was never completely filled. I have no clue how a host in Austin can come up with a figure such as 2 hour wait. There was no one in line at the door and there remained empty tables throughout the duration of our stay. Let me say now that I happened to be wearing my shirt from the Women's March, so a part of me wonders whether this over the top unhelpful unfriendly treatment was somewhat discriminatory? It is also possible the host is just a legitimate asshole on a power trip. Either way, I won't be coming back. This is Austin, not NYC.

Let's just say we had a very Carniv-Glorious time!!! This is a pretty darn good choice for lunch if you are at Islands of Adventure.Here is how our decisions making process went. It was a little past lunch and we had just finished the long lines and crowds in Harry Potter Land (Hogwartz, I know, I know). We did not want to attempt eating there because it was just too crazy. We considered doing Mythos, but we knew that would probably take longer and be more of a process. Plus, we wanted to get into Jurassic Park Land while it was still half-warm out and do the water ride. As we worked through Jurassic Park, there was the option of just pizza, or just burgers. All the options were singular. We wanted more options to choose from. Then we found Thunder Falls Terrace.For Amusement Park food, the prices are pretty affordable. They also have a decent variety of drink choices. Beer, Wine, Hot Chocolate, Hot Coffee, Frozen Coffee, the list goes on and on. And you can even get the souvenir cups for many of the different drinks. I just went with soda, and everyone in our group just did soda, or bottles of water. But the food selection was what we were really after. I got the Chicken and Ribs. Neither portion was huge, but when put together, it filled me up just fine. The ribs were really really good. I kind of wish that I just did the full ribs platter. I like white meat better, and I am pretty sure the chicken that came in this combo platter was dark. Nevertheless, it was very enjoyable. My fiancee got the same time. My dad did the whole rotisserie chicken platter. He really really liked it. The portions were huge and he filled up so much he even shared some of his white meat with me. I really liked the chicken. It was not too dry, and had just the right flavor.My mom did the tortilla soup. She really liked it. She also got fried plantains and salsa. I had a few. It was a very enjoyable change from chips and salsa. I liked it  a lot, the salsa impressed me with its fresh taste.My brother did a huge turkey leg. With his beard, he looked like a viking. It probably would have been a more fitting sight at Norway in Epcot. We all laughed at the grease in his beard afterwards. He was happy he had been talking about getting a huge Turkey leg all weekend.My brother's girlfriend got a burger. She was pretty happy with it, but it did not look super pretty and the juices got the bun pretty soggy by the end of our meal.Overall, you cannot go wrong with the chicken or the ribs. The prices are decent and the food pretty darn good."},{"name":"The Ruby Dragon","address":"N Mississippi Ave & N Skidmore St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I had a really mediocre dining experience here...

We were very disappointed. I don't know of any other coffee shop that does not give at least 1 refill on drip coffee. Seriously? $2+ for a single mug of coffee, $ 5+ for a piece of ciabatta and an egg? We just felt like the value for what we had was just not there. The lady behind the counter was nice enough, but for the prices, we  don't want a pick up your food at the counter and bus your own table kind of atmosphere. It almost felt like there was an underlying contempt for the customer.

We were a group of 7 so we tried almost every small plate on the menu, and I think only 1 was just ok (the squash quesadilla). The rest were fantastic and gorgeously plated: chips and salsa with caldera cheddar, chips with refried lentils and yogurt, papas with garlic chile (spicy!), fried mushrooms, chile prawns, green chorizo tlayuda, brisket tacos, roasted carrots, and beet tostada. We also tried at least 4 or 5 different cocktails and they were all excellent - carefully made and beautifully presented, and if someone wasn't thrilled with their drink, they brought another.

I just got the cheeseburger (priced at 8.99), but I would come back again at some point when I'm drunk to try the chicken burger or empanadas. Those seem to be a common choice for people, and maybe the chicken is a bit less greasy?This place was packed when we came by, which is always a good sign. There is limited seating, however: a few tables inside of the establishment, and a few outside of it, which is where my friends and I plopped down. It's fast food eating with fast casual prices.

The bad:\\nOur waiter did not tell us about the specials when we were seated.  We actually overheard him telling another table.  Once he brought our first dish out, we had to ask him about the specials for the night.  The other issue I had with the service was that the waiter took our empty wine glasses without asking if we wanted anything else.  He didn't say a word.  I just saw an arm reach over my shoulder, grab the glasses and quickly walk away.  For a second I thought it was one of the other staff members who were keeping water filled and such, but it was our waiter.  When he came back again later, we were able to order some of that delicious sangria!One dish that I was really looking forward to was the Ahi tuna *en escabeche\\" pimenton oil.

We ordered 8 different items, but there was a mistake on one of the items, two of the waiters came to point out that it was our mistake instead of just fixing the order. Ok, fine. But then the bill came and they charged us for 10 items instead of 8. Three of the waiters now came and told us how that was the right amount, but when we insisted we didn't even get a few items that we ordered. In the end they said they checked with the chefs and they send us 9 items for sure but we were mistaken if we thought we only got 8 items.

I ordered the 2 different broths, the spicy broth and the original broth. The broth was really bland. It is as if I order water as my broth. I had to add the soy sauce on the side to make it less bland. I ordered several types of meat and I only found two things that were decent. It was the fatty beef and beef tongue. A lot of the meats had a strong freezer taste. On the other hand, the fish balls were pretty good and vegetables were really good. I am glad they provide you with a dipping sauce because everything is so bland. It is a satay sauce full of MSG. I can really taste it even though it made everything tasted better.

Consistent befuddlement on my husband's and my part as to why it's always packed, no matter the time of day or day of the week. Good service? Sure, as long as you look like you live in Circle C. Yay. Way back when, when this location was located in the hole-in-the-wall where Evangeline lives today, they were awesome. They would treat us like family. Seriously. We might have had to wait forever to be seated, but once we were, we'd get the star treatment, and then after our meal (along with the multiple truly awesomely-priced amazing hand-shaken fresh lime margaritas we'd imbibed), they'd bring us a free slice of Tres Leches cake or some other awesome dessert from one of their family members' celebrations. Why? you might ask? I can assure you we have no idea -- we just happened to be there at really happy times -- and good lordy, dems could COOK. Yum, and wow -- how freakin' sweet of them! Us: \\"No, we couldn't possibly eat another bite.\\" Them: \\"Eat! !Come!\\" (I also did not realize till this point that Mexico had met the Boot and the Peninsula. I guess alll those moms got together at a seminar.)Then (cue the evil's-approaching \\"bom-bom-bom!\\" music here) ... they moved. We were worried at first, and rightly so. We've been a few times since then (sheesh, it's within walking distance of our house, for cryng out loud). In the beginning -- large success! Yay! But, nay (cue the \\"wah-wah\\" music here): THAT was earlier this century.We have not been back within the last 6 months and generally avoid it now. From what I understand, the service nowadays is still pretty good, but the food is BLAND with a (and not just a) capital B. It's like everything is missing a key ingredient. Hmm. Cumin, anyone? Or maybe it's the onions. The wait-staff used to pose the problem to the customer: \\"Do you want this with onions?\\" I'm guessing back in the day (again, shoot me again now for that) they had patrons with a problem with the cebollos? (There were even warnings on the old menus about onions. We've wondered, then and now, have they really received that many complaints about onions?) I don't get it. One goes for Tex-Mex. One is pretty much assured one's plate will be riddled with onions. Um, what's the question again? Do we Austinites now have so many moneyed transplants that we have to deal with the \\"mild, medium, or HOT\\" issue regarding the onions? These days, we're figuring Maudie's just bypassed the issue altogether and left the onions out of everything. It might explain the lack of flavor in everything they offer. Whatevs ... but it really bums us out.The problem with this place is that it's SO CLOSE YET SO FAR AWAY. They used to be so good, and now they just aren't.Okay, so the near and dear of this is that even though we live a stone's throw away from this place, we probably will not be back, until the reviews improve, the food gets better and more flavorful, and when the whole State of the Onion question gets resolved.

She begrudgingly gave more rice lol Happy we didn't get sick tho, I might try them out again if their food score improves. THAT'S A HUGE MIGHT, like if someone else was paying. Like I said it wasn't the worst but it isn't the best. How do you run out of patties and coco bread and have no scotch bonnet sauce? I could see if it was 30 mins before close even an hour before close on the weekend but this was an early week day around 6pm. This place could be better with organization, better attitudes, and a higher food score."},{"name":"Poppin Pita Grill","address":"420 14th St NW, 100B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Placed an order for pickup here on April 26.

It doesn't looks so big from the side, but once i walked in, I was impressed! The seats were quite comfortable. Of course being brand new the dishes were perfect (meaning no chips). We were here for dinner so it was dark outside already. I can imagine how nice and bright it would be during the day, the North and East walls are glass. Lots of natural light. Once seated we were brought our tea, hot water and menus right away. I will admit that I thought it was a noodle house. One of my daughters had said her gf said it was a soup noodle place. Maybe for lunch? So ... having said that ... I was a little taken back by the prices of the entrees. We ended up ordering three dishes and a soup. Honeymoon Fried Rice, House Special Fried Noodles, Gailan w/oyster Sauce and a chicken and corn soup. All of them were winners!! Perfectly seasoned. Great textures. Crispy noodles. Crunchy yet tender vegetables. Receiving the bill was a little painful ... $60 for those three simple dishes and soup. I would like to try this place at lunch time.

I'm not very good with spicy foods, so I steered clear of the other wraps that listed hot sauce or other mouth-burning ingredients.For $8, what I got was pathetically small and poor quality. The wrap itself was like tasteless cardboard, and there was so little sandwich filling that most of the sandwich was just extra, dry wrap. Inside there were three small (but admittedly delicious) strips of tempeh bacon (homemade, also, not from a tofurkey box), one slice of soggy tomato, two skinny, not crunchy pickle slices, and a wilted piece of romaine drenched in a mayo that was so spicy I was unable to eat the wrap without a gallon of water. It wasn't really a flavorful spicy, either... just mouth-searing. Now, I know I might just be a whimp about the spicyness of the mayo, but the rest of the wrap was underwhelming also. For $8 I can get a much more substantial and satisfying lunch.

Hopefully that will change.\\nWe ordered the pork ramen, which wasn't a very large portion (two slices of pork).  It was tasty and the ramen was the right amount of chewiness for me.  We also ordered the chicken teriyaki, which wasn't very good because there were no veggies and the chicken was rather dry.  However, we were very happy  with the chicken tempura - the batter was so light and crispy.  Again, no veggies.  \\nOverall, some menu items are wonderful and some not as much.

Started with Lime Caipirinha (delicious, Brazilian rum with super fresh squeezed lime juice and a bit of sugar) and Malibu cocktails. Hats off to the bartender! Three standout appetizers: Cheese Bread (small round fresh dough balls infused with delicious cheese); Black Bean Shots (texture of pureed black bean soup, served in a latte cup, delicate flavor with hint of onion); Steak & Blue Cheese pizza. The Beef Empanadas (ground beef with olives) and the Beef Stroganoff entr√©e were both good but not nearly as impressive as the appetizers.  We loved the food so much we returned 2 days later! This time we tried the Chicken Dumplings appetizer (OK but rather dry) and the Filet w/French Fries appetizer (delicious and tenderly cooked to order, saut√©ed with onions). The Filet Mignon entr√©e was perfectly cooked and delicately seasoned. Boteco offers several desserts, but we were too full to try any of them. Our server on each of our visits (Giselle; Karla) was warm, friendly, engaged and prepared to discuss all details of how each dish was prepared. There is street side seating; the interior is nicely decorated with wood paneling and canvas art; the bar is backlit by a mural-sized blue neon wall panel that complements the d√©cor but does not strain the eyes. Great food! Great service! Nice ambience! Will definitely visit Boteco again on our next trip to Orlando!"},{"name":"Bull McCabe's Pub","address":"366A Somerville Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"I love this place.

Both of my parents were born and raised there (and they are both excellent cooks, so I am lucky to have grown up with amazing authentic Shanghai cuisine), and I stay there at least 2 months a year -- so I know a thing or two about good Shanghai food (restaurant and street food).That being said, Top Shanghai Cuisine Restaurant is pretty much the bomb. The first time I went (December 2007), I was very skeptical (as I tend to be of all restaurants who allege themselves to be authentic Shanghainese food), but I was blown away by their green onion crepes (standard street fare - deliciously greasy) and xiao long bao (the wrapper was thin but did not break easily, the meat was juicy and savory, and the soup inside was heavenly). I ended up going to Top Shanghai Cuisine Restaurant at least 6 times (with my parents) during my week long vacation to Vancouver. I went there again a few times during this past spring break (without my parents - March 2009), and the food is as excellent as ever. I definitely recommend the sauteed string beans, the nian gao, the Shanghai chao mian, the hong shao rou, the sheng jian bao, and and and... well, I suggest you Yelp-ers go there right now and find a favorite dish for yourselves. =)Service: So I noticed other reviewers were not too impressed with the service, but I had a pretty different experience (this is March 2009). Since cannot read Chinese, nor am I proficient in Mandarin Chinese, but I am fluent in Shanghainese and knew what dishes I wanted. I asked my first waitress if she spoke Shanghainese; she didn't but immediately got me someone who did, and he (I think his name was Jimmy? don't quote me on it, though) was able to get me everything I wanted. The next few times I went, I had a waitress (I think her name is Shirley?) who was even more attentive and kind and also made some wonderful recommendations when I asked for a dessert the restaurant did not make (red bean soup). I did have to wait for refills on my tea (in other Chinese restaurants, once you flip the lid, the tea is immediately refilled), but the food was brought to my table very promptly.Ambiance: I agree with Emily, the tables are very close together, and practically every last inch is used. Every time I've gone (11am, noon, 3pm, 6pm, 8pm), the restaurant is at 100% capacity, with people waiting to be seated. Reservations are DEFINITELY recommended, and if you are only a party of 2, you may have to share a table with other 2-fers (happened to me once).Price: A little steep for certain dishes (seafood, etc.), but if you're into snacks (dim sum) like me, it is decent, even in this economy (the xiao long bao were less than $5!). The portions are family size, so I recommend going with a group of 3+ so you can sample a variety of dishes.Overall:\\nFood - 5!\\nService - 4.5\\nPrice - 4.5\\nAmbiance - 4 (I enjoy the hustle 'n bustle, but not tripping over wandering babies ^_^)"},{"name":"The Range Bar & Grille","address":"306 Whiting St","city":"Hingham","stars":"3.5","text":"Went here on a Friday night and I've been here before and the service has always been okay, but this time both bartenders were incredibly rude to begin with, they served us drinks and then when my friend had went back by herself they told her they couldn't serve her because she looked underage meanwhile we were there celebrating her 27th birthday!

Later I guess the other waiter must have mentioned it to the manager and the manager sent over a free glass of wine to us to make up for what had happened. That was gracious of the manager. For the entire dinner, even before the incident occurred, the waitress would roll her eyes when someone asked a question regarding the food or simply asked for more water. She practically dropped our kids water on the table, luckily it was paper cups. We did not want to ruin the night for our kids by making a big fuss in front of them so we decided not to.

They have plenty of space but it is laid out nicely so it still has an intimate feel.  They had a party of 40 \\"no-show\\" and as our group grew in size, they gave us the space that the other party had reserved.  (You can reserve space for large parties, which is great to know for the future!) Then we were in front of the live music, but this was not an issue as it was a very chill duo. Not the intrusive screaming kind of band that some sports bars hire on the weekend. Our server was excellent and was able to keep up with us moving all around and she always kept our drinks full. The food was amazing!!!! We had read reviews about the burgers so that is what most of us ordered. They were even better than we hoped. We will definitely be back. Members of our group ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich, a black and blue burger, build your own burgers, most people ordered the hangover burger, and a turkey wrap. Everyone was very happy with their meal. The fries and waffle fries are very good but they essentially taste the same, only cut in different shapes. One couple came later in the evening and ordered a pizza but then were told the pizza oven broke. You can't help these things sometimes. But overall great food experience.

There is zero air conditioning and with like 6 pizza ovens going, it was very hot in there.  Server was less than attentive as he was busy trying to impress two young female diners. For such a small place, it should have had a small business customer centric feeling, but it seemed like no one cared you chose to eat there. Pizza was very thin crust and made by hand.

I was tempted to get it, but the pain au chocolat (which is notoriously different from place to place) looked correctly made, with beautiful bubbles in the crust. I will be getting those next time. Along with about ten macarons.For locavores, it's also good to note that a very large proportion of the materials used to make the sandwiches, drinks, and coffees are locally sourced and produced, including Dai Due mustards and cheeses!

It doesn't matter that I live a good 30+min drive away, with arguably good pizza much much closer, I can't stay away. And now my partner is hooked too. Their pizza's cracker-like crust is the clincher. It's always baked to crispy perfection on a nice thin crust and the simplest of toppings like pepperoni and mushroom are never soggy or greasy. I've branched out to their specialties like the perogy pizza (very good!) but always come back to the classics. Pro-tip: one of the servers told us about a concoction he made that we loved -- Get the chicken wings, but rather than choosing just one flavour you can ask them to do two.

The girl who answered the phone said it would be ready in 10 minutes. I got their in about 15 minutes and it was ready.The pizza was okay. The crust was fresh and though I think it could have been a little crispier, was pretty good. There was a decent amount of all the toppings on the pie, but they needed a bit longer in the oven to really bake together.

Great location, next to Boston Commons and Newbury St.  My wife was happy with the shopping nearby, especially Boylston and Newbury St's and Copley square mall.  About a 2 minute walk to the Arlington Station Green line T also. NICE!Gym was a  bit outdated and felt like a cave.  Not all the treadmills seemed to work.  Decent space for my workout.  My bathroom was a bit small and the room overall did seem a bit outdated but clean.  We had a view of the park from our room, which was nice also.My only complaint was that the A/C didn't work very well.  We had it cranked on Max and the temperature was on the lowest setting.  Didn't really cool the room very well.  Fortunately, we were out most of the day, so we didn't care too much.  WiFi wasn't free, which is a bit of a letdown also.

Just about everything you'd expect from any reputable soul food spot. I ordered 2 pieces of white chicken with fried green tomatoes and string beans. The chicken was great: very moist with crispy skin, no need for any additional sauce/topping, in my opinion. The fried green tomatoes were pretty good but the string beans were kind of nasty.

On several occasions, I noticed the three of them standing in the back just talking, while my party, as well as others, were waiting for service.The food (when it finally came) was alright. I have one major complaint though. We ordered an appetizer of the shrimp and vegetable tempura. When it came out, there were 2 small pieces of shrimp, and a dozen veggies. I felt a bit ripped-off; the veggies were good,but it just didn't seem like the name would suggest. I expected a little more shrimp in there.I ordered some sushi, and asked for some hot sauce on the side. The waiter warned me that this would \\"incur a small upcharge.\\" Yeah, it was only like a buck, but it's one of those little things that bugs me; I wasn't 100% pleased with the sushi and wanted some hot sauce, and rather than trying to remedy that and satisfy me as a customer, you're going to charge me more? I see that as a poor model, but what do I know about running a restaurant.All in all, the food wasn't terrible. I was soured by the whole experience though.

Maybe the bar is great, I don't know.Meh.First off, chips and salsa are extra. Just getting that out there. Not a deal breaker, but it should be mentioned.I ordered the pork enchiladas (I forget the exact dish), and my girlfriend ordered a Quesadilla which she requested two kind of meat on (i believe chicken and beef or pork?). We both walked away with the same conclusion - the meat was without seasoning. I borrowed some of her Quesadilla toppings to try to mask the flavor (because the sauce on my enchiladas wasn't quite handling it), and it didn't taste unpleasant, but just underwhelming. Side dishes were tiny.That's all I really have to say. The wall art was a bit odd, but didn't exactly have a major effect on my meal experience.Good sit down Mexican joints are hard to come buy in Boston (at least compared to cities further South). Sol Azteca on Beacon St. is further out (past Fenway Park), but is comparably priced, and infinitely better, with delicious, authentic food (and you don't have to pay extra for chips and salsa), and portion sizes large enough to ensure you'll have leftovers for lunch the next day. If you're up for a more fast food kind of experience, there are plenty of Chipotle in Boston, or alternatively Boston's own Boloco (which serves more eclectic burritos that perhaps stretch the definition of the word), though I'd suggest avoiding Qdoba (its fine, but the other two have it beat).If you're desperate for sit-down Mexican and don't have the time to go somewhere else, Cactus Club will be passable.

Castagna knocked that chill, friendly, welcoming and pleasant ball out of the park. Now let's talk the food. Incredible- is the only word I can think of to sum up my experience. The courses we had were served in a way that made sure we had enough time to discuss what we were eating, have a few sips of the wine pairings(which were spot on) and then become excited for what was next. Our servers were spot on by explaining what we were eating, what the wine was, and if we had any dietary restrictions they could quickly switch out a course for whomever needed it. And they did! My vegetarian friend asked and they immediately informed the chef and brought a course menu for his dietary needs. Amazing! This was a special occasion for my dear friends birthday and Castagna flawlessly executed a unique meal for us. I cannot express how much thanks and gratitude I have for this restaurant.

To be honest, my friends dont like it very much. BUT im not my friends. I actually quite like wingnuts. I'd say their wings are actually better than taco mac's. I KNOW BLASPHEMY!!! and you get a massive variety of sauces to choose from. from mild to insane to the ever popular chipotle ranch to my personal favorite honey mustard, there are sauces for every occasion. and were not talking about watered down sauces. these sauces are thick and full of their respective flavor. Their boneless wings are basically fried chicken breasts covered in sauce. Actually, the execution here on that is quite good. Id say it actually better than many chain restuarants like applebees (which i have had a ton of wings at thanks to late nite appetizers in NJ) . theyre covered in whatever sauce you want, and its best if you eat them right when you get them. theyll be crispy, hot, and super flavorful. i dont think ive ever had a bad boneless wing here. and believe me ive eaten here a ton.Their boned wings are usually juicy and flavorful, but lately ive noticed that they can be overfried. But i usually get the boneless since theyre a better deal anyway. Unfortunately this wingnuts will be closing down in a few months due to construction here at tech.

It pains me to write this as our previous two visits were stellar.  This visit started out badly, when I called to make a reservation for our 21st wedding anniversary, I wasn't asked if we were celebrating a special occasion.  I was asked twice what day and time and after answering I mentioned it was our anniversary dinner.  At that point the phone was hung up, no acknowledgement.  When we arrived our special day wasn't mentioned by the host or our server who seated us.  We weren't greeted with a glass of bubbly as we were before; not sure if there was a policy change or missed because it was not noted on our reservation. (I know this because my husband was a little upset and asked about it)  We were sandwiched in between 2 families on the banquette in the back, previous visits we had a cozy booth. It was a little loud and definitely not romantic.  The server from the next table unfortunately banged into my husband's chair many times during our meal; once he said \\"sorry\\".  Our server was very nice and personable, she and all of the servers we observed seemed excessively busy. The food itself was very good; we took dessert home and honestly the carrot cake was just okay. The coconut cake was delicious, but the pineapple ice cream didn't make it into the bag.

We eventually spotted him chatting with other servers near the kitchen. I had to get up and go over to ask him for more bread. That's another thing:  there were three of us at the table, and when I asked for a second serving of bread, our server informed us that he \\"could do that if you want, but I'll have to charge you a dollar.\\" Then he grabbed the plate that still had bread on it before any of us could stop him.

Meaning the same Pita bread you'll find at Publix. Pre-grilled and then warmed on the griddle. What's worse is I watched the woman cook use her un-gloved hands to add and remove the Gyro meat to the portion. The green bean fasolakia was the absolutely worse version of this I've ever had.

This is the only card I have so she tries again & it's still not working. I say Ok can I come by and pay cash in an hour and still have the cake delivered today. The woman tell me yes & that she already authorized for the cake to go out for delivery and she will put a note that I will come by same day to pay cash. I get a call back 10 minutes later from the same woman saying that her boss actually can't authorize for the cake to be delivered without payment...weird because she told me previously that she'd already authorized the delivery. So I tell her ok I will be there at 10am to pay for the cake so it could still be delivered before 3pm (the latest delivery time estimate given) she says actually no it won't be delivered today if you do that. I ask \\"so basically I'm out of luck\\" she said \\"yes\\". I was furious. I wrote an email to their customer service. I had no idea why I couldn't still pay cash at 10am same morning and still have the cake delivered (literally 1 mine from their Roswell Rd location) by 3pm. My cake that I ordered still should've been made and ready to go after cash payment was received. The email response I got was \\"Sorry.

Well, at least I always do after I gorge myself on all the goodies here.  It aint' fancy pancy, but it sure hits the spot.  Their Wontons are the real deal, full wholesome shrimp balls wrapped in the thinnest, softest silky wrap.  Get the Wontons with the Egg Noodles - you wont regret it, their noodles are the fresh quality, chewy kind.  They aren't called a \\"Noodle House\\" for nothing.As for the Congee, they live up to that part of the name too.  They serve a fantastic Seabass and Cilantro Congee, which isn't the most Ocean Wise friendly, but since it's already there, I think it would be worse to waste it and not eat it at all.  All that being said, for the more environmentally friendly and vegetarian folks around here, the simple, Plain Congee is absolutely devine.  I'll get a Plain Congee with a Chinese Donut on any given day, and I swear you could finally shut me the heck up for at least 15 minutes of silent bliss while I savour the sheer comfort. Their BBQ Meat options are the NOMS, everything else is also just darn good.  From morning to late night delights, these guys got simply good everyday Chinese food covered.

Tapas is generally a good idea so we decided to give this place a whirl.My first impression was that the place was small and the hostess was not the least bit warming or welcoming but we still decided to stay and give it a try.We had the Tostones con Hogao. The plantains were covered in salt and the side sauce was definitely what saved an otherwise over salted and particularly bland option.Next, we tried the chicken empanadas. Again, very bland. Luckily we drowned them in the cilantro sauce and that gave the empanadas some taste. Then we tried to bruschetta. This was definitely the best part of the meal. The waitress suggested it and she was spot on. Lastly, we had the Cuban sandwich, which was ok. The meat was a bit salty but it was edible. The sweet potato fries were good. Nothing fantastic.  We tried both the white and red sangria. The white was far better than the red. We could barely drink the red and left more than half a liter behind.

I usually would get the garlic infused/marinated garlic glazed sirloin. It WAS the most impressive item on the menu.  I turn so many people on to this entree but alas, corporate SB has chosen the cheaper/quicker way out by simply grilling the sirloin and simply pouring a garlic glaze over it. NOT the same flavor or tenderness at all.  Such a shame.  They acrewed up a good thing.Ok, the ribs are THE BEST RIBS IN TOWN in town so I WILL also stop by for those as well!Whatever you do, don't get any of their bizarre deserts like the fried cheescake, fried apple bit or fries chocolate cake. They are ALL nasty tasting! The only deserts that are remotely palatable are the bag of doughnuts or possibly the regular chocolate cake. Other than those, RUN from their concoctions!Service can be hit or miss.

The cornbread, however, was the real gem here. It packed a lot flavor, had the perfect texture - good crust on the outside and a soft inside - and the melted butter on top made it some of the best cornbread I have eaten.

The pastry crust was crispy on the exterior but uncooked and very doughy on the interior. The vegetables were fresh but there was no flavor to the dish. The chicken and vegetables were very bland and didn't seem to be cooked all the way through. The sauteed vegetables on the side were soaked in lemon to the point of me not being able to eat it.This is an EXTREMELY rare situation where I don't finish my meal it was so bad.My friends had the burger that they said was dry with too much bun to burger ratio.

There was a guy here on some turn tables and the music was so incredibly loud, obnoxious, and did not fit the place my friends and I had to end up leaving.  This is not a club but a Coffee and Pie spot on Alberta in Portland so having a guy DJ-ing incredibly loud and NOT good music is not making this place better but definitely worse.

How can that be???  The waterfront is ringed by overpriced, pedestrian establishments that peddle views and not much else.  I guess tourists are like seagulls - they'll eat whatever is near the water and lands in front of them. I've only ever been here for lunch, but at said lunch you can (and should) order the Burger Trilogy - a trio of three small burger-esque creations.  In the middle is a rich, savory kobe beef slider, and to the sides you'll find a lobster roll and tuna topped with roasted red peppers.  I thought the red peppers were a bit overkill and removed them.  They had soaked into the bread enough that it gave just a hint of their presence without overwhelming the delicate flavor of the tuna.  The kobe slider used to be offered with the decadent upgrade of foie gras, but sadly that's no longer an option. The prices here do seem a bit steep, but this is an area that caters to wealthy tourists and local executive types, so who can blame them for charging what they do?

I got the lobster beer which was pretty bitter for me but tasted alright. I am personally not a huge fan of beer but I would come back here again to find a beer I would like as I am sure I will with so many options to choose from! What really makes this place stand out is the live music and board games to play as you sit and drink. Yes you heard me they have board games such as scrabble and apples to apples. I think it is more fun to play them while you have a beer with friends as opposed to just sitting at a table hoping for someone to start up an engaging conversation over very loud music.

Make sure to bring along a good friend to help you endure the wait. I mean, the waiters/waitresses are nice enough.. just make sure you don't come here ravenous. No matter how busy or empty it is.. Cactus Club always seems to be the same amount of slowwwwww.And although I do love a good patio.. a patio next to a busy intersection, not so much. It's so cramped that you or your dining companion will most likely bump chairs with another table at least thrice in one sitting.

I have been going to Cathay Pacific since being a little kid.  I have gone drinking and dancing there for about ten years.  I will review my most recent visits the past couple of years.  Anyways...here we go!The Food:\\nMany like this new Hot Pot, Shabu, and Sushi (Japanese) crap.  I don't!  I like Chicken WIngs, Boneless Ribs, Lobster Sauce, and Pork fried rice.  Cathay knows how to do it and they do it right.  All of it is delicious.  My favorites are the chicken fingers and the fried shrimp.  The chicken fingers are like chicken finger style chicken nuggets.  They are so good while hot.  The fried shrimp is a whole big fried shrimp.  It isn't mangled or crippled to look like a chicken finger like other places do.The drinks:\\nThe drinks are good but it depends on whose making it.  I like the Zombies, Pina Coladas, and Scorpion Bowls.  The other regular drinks are good too.  They are priced right, sized right, and more importantly not watered down.The Service:\\nThis is shaky at best.  One guy takes your order.  Another guy serves. The order guy takes your money leaving you scratching your head.  The food is so good I can overlook the service kind of like people do with the Soup Nazi.Karaoke Nights\\nKaraoke Nights are every night except Fridays and Saturdays.  You can make an ass of yourself here with no problems.  I enjoy singing Rick James and Prince especially when I've had a zombie or two too many.  I think some people on the Karaoke circuit hang here.Band Nights\\nI love band nights.  My kind of crowd and my kind of music.  Band nights are on Friday and Saturday nights.  The bands play top 40 and other classics from the 60s all the way to current hits.  This is a hidden gem if you like the just past cougars to grandmamas.  I'm ok with that after a zombie or two.

El Oriental de Cuba doesn't even come close.That being said, Cuban food isn't easily attainable around Boston, and if you're hankering for Cuban, this place will do.  It's average Cuban dive fare."},{"name":"Joe's On Juniper","address":"1049 Juniper St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I went to lunch here with two friends after a rather intense study session for an upcoming exam, and I am really glad we went here. Honestly, I don't really do too much exploring in midtown, so for me this place was someplace interesting and new I probably would have never visited if it hadn't been for my friends.I think it is interesting that a lot of people seem to have complaints about service, because the person who waited on us was really fantastic - super friendly, knowledgeable, and fast!The main reason why we went here - for the burgers - were fantastic. My friends seemed to really enjoy their beef burgers, and I got a black bean patty. It was definitely very tasty, although a bit crumbly for my taste. It kind of had a tendency to fall apart. I got the tavern fries with mine, and while they were good, they were more lukewarm than hot. If they had been hot, they probably would have been the best fries I'd had in a while. The onion rings and freshly fried potato chips also looked amazing, though. I almost wish I would have gotten a salad along with it though, because that's really what I felt like I was missing at the end.Can't speak to the drinks, as we had to drudge back and study more after lunch, but the non-alcoholic drinks (ie tea and soda) were ginormous. Since it's early December, we didn't obviously sit on the patio, but I bet during the spring that's an awesome place to people watch.All in all I was happy and I'd definitely come back here, especially since they have so many veg options!"},{"name":"Vij's Restaurant","address":"3106 Cambie Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"My best friend is Indian and I have extensive Indian dishes back in cali.

There's seating inside, as well as a large covered outdoor patio.Stopped in for their grand opening (the Great Pizza Giveaway) today and got a free pizza with purchase of a drink.  This used to be a Starbucks up until this year, when Starbucks moved into an adjacent building.  Now, Pizza Press has moved into town and set up shop!The pizza is a thin crust.  It's crispy, flakey, and very good if you like thin crust.  It reminds me of a flatbread, but just a thick enough to support the toppings...and boy are there plenty of toppings to choose from.  They have signature pizzas to to pick from, or you can build your own with as many toppings as you want. All the pizzas were $10, including the build your own, except the plain cheese ($8) and the vegan cheese ($11).They were literally giving it away today, so the line was very long, but it was worth the wait.  I'm a huge thin crust pizza fan, so this was perfect for me!  You can order a \\"signature\\" pizza and then sub out any of the ingredients, so I got \\"The Tribune\\" and opted for White Sauce and added grape tomatoes.  After they prep the pizza with your toppings they put it through their conveyor belt oven, and then at the other end of the oven you can choose \\"finishers\\" like cilantro, Sriracha, pesto, etc.They had at least 20 beers on tap, and they apparently serve a \\"beer float\\" which is like a root beer float but with real beer.  Didn't get to try it, but it sounded interesting!I stopped in today for their free pizza, and I was very satisfied.

And despite having the \\"Up with People\\" theme song prominently placed on my now defunct MySpace profile page, sadly I tend to be down with most, as they get in the way of what I want, when I want it, as quickly as I want it.  A little spoiled maybe?  Regardless, because of this distain for the vast majority and a litany of other self centered and social disorder based motives, I have yet to frequent, or infrequently frequent (what?) some of Portland's top dining destinations.This past Friday I had the rare day off as I was up on Pill Hill for a pre-op appointment to learn more about the giant \\"laser\\" that will soon be operational and etching a prescription onto my delicate peepers in less time that it takes to blow up the planet Alderaan.  Jeepers!  So after the 2  1/2 hour appointment to see if they could indeed give me x-ray vision (watch out ladies), I stumbled out of the Casey Eye Institute looking like a pale and intoxicated Stevie Wonder vampire, as the bright scorching sun slithered around my old man blue blockers, causing my fully dilated eyes to wither in pain as I staggered to the car with the assistance of the very preggo TLB.Since this appointment was scheduled early in the day, laid before me was almost a full day to call upon some of those places I had yet to visit.  The Tin Shed was at the top of my list. We arrived around 11 and found a less then daunting 15 minute wait before us.  Grabbing a cup of complimentary joe, I had the TLB read me some of the menu highlights as I was unable to read, which furthered the perception that I was indeed blind.  Most people usually think I'm just deaf and dumb.I must say that the Tin Shed did live up to all the hype.  The outdoor garden seating was beautiful and relaxing, the service was friendly and attentive and they had pint sized mimosas.  That's right...PINT SIZED MIMOSAS.  The TLB and I both went with the Everything Naughty breakfast, because we are both naughty little monkeys and we wanted to sample an assortment of their dishes.  While it wasn't the best biscuits and gravy I have ever had (Arleta Library owns that distinction) it was really damn good.  Everything in fact was extremely well done.Now the only problem is getting another weekday day off so that I can once again enjoy their amazing food.

The lettuce and tomatoes are perfectly portioned. The Greek sauce is so out of this world that I always order (and pay for) an extra side container that I portion out later and apply to salads.

Bombay shrimp on a bed of noodles was the special app of the day, with a ton of flavor and ample quantity of seafood.  The oysters were lightly fried in dipping sauces that did not overwhelm the flavor of the main ingredient.  I personally ate the chicken fried beef, but added the quail.  The meat was perfectly done, flavorful and the components overall were solid.  The stand out of the meal was actually the side of crab mashed potatoes, which had a TON of delicious crab that meshed well with the buttered potatoes.  I highly suggest it.  The fried pie desert was ok - in essence will remind you of a home made version of Toaster Strudels.The bill, mostly driven by the cost of the \\"special\\" that one of us ordered was a bit high, but acceptable for the meal itself.

CBTL, once a mom-and-pop (established in LA in 1963), is a global company today, and they are obviously directly competing with java giant Starbucks.The CBTL that I frequent is far and away the best coffee shop (of which I'm aware) within a 10-mile radius. Their espresso and coffee, while not as distinctive as the local gourmet shops, outclass Starbucks' in every conceivable way. For those who enjoy flavored espresso drinks, you'll find that CBTL's aren't excessively sweet (like those other guys'), and their ingredients have a more natural flavor. From what I understand, they use powders (with a pleasant, understated sweetness) rather than those goopy, tooth-melting syrups that are so common. The pastries, which are sourced from local bakeries, are better than those you'll find at other chain stores--scones are actually scones. The employees at this CBTL are consistently friendly, attentive, and helpful. They are constantly making runs through the store to deliver drinks, clean up, refill waters, etc. I get the impression that CBTL makes an extra effort in the customer service department. Wifi is available. Also notable is the fact that they tend to use glassware rather than disposable cups, which greatly reduces waste. My only complaints are that the chairs are somewhat uncomfortable, and espresso drinks are a little pricey. If you find yourself unable to make it out to your local coffee shop, CBTL is solid alternative."},{"name":"Taj Boston","address":"15 Arlington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Very nice hotel, centrally located, with wonderful pricing.

Emerald Isle burger, salad rolls, even the beef curry are above average. The margarita I had was very acidic and not very tasty. I stopped at one. Here's my main beef with Imbibe...the over-amplified live music at dinner time. My wife and I walked in the other night, half-joking that if there was someone on stage, that it might not be a good time to eat there. Sure enough, we get there at about 6pm, there's a lady on stage, singing her heart out, and I could barely communicate with my better half that we might want to think about leaving. Music is fine, Imbibe. Jacking up the volume for an acoustic artist in your small performing area makes it nearly impossible to have a conversation with anyone at one's table. Suggestions...turn the volume down or even OFF. That makes listening to it optional, not mandatory. If not that, then schedule the performance for later in the evening, when people are more likely to be simply drinking and not DINING. This very situation made us walk out the door and look for dinner elsewhere. I look forward to trying out the new menu, although I will say that not being able to preview it online makes me less likely to do so. That being said, I've always had good food at Imbibe.

I was a bit unsure about the fish because the name of the place is THE RAVENOUS PIG (so fish I was  unsure of), but when it came it was a generous size and the potatoes were crispy on the outside and soft not the inside. They were delicious. The fish was grilled to perfection and topped with a sauce that was pungent but subtle at the same time.  The Gilles crispness of the fish melded delightfully together. It gave me the impression of almost taking over, but then giving way to another flavor.

They are slightly more expensive and a whole lotta louder. They have items like tripe, oxtail, and pig's feet, which we didn't try but instead opted for the more traditional squid, fish, and paella. All the tapas plates we tried were tasty and excellent, though some are a tad small. E.g., the beef ribs had one small and one medium piece for $12. The paellas come in medium and large pans. We chose a large Barceloneta (seafood), which is good for the 3 of us. since there are 3 pieces per type of seafood such as shrimp, mussels, and clams. Actually I think there were only two shrimps so two of us split one. That's got to be a new thing - lets split a shrimp. The paella was also delicioso but demasiado salado.

I would have rated this hotel 5 stars due to their amazing staff and awesome rooms,  but the one thing that really bothered me was how they handled my credit card. I was sharing my room for the 5 days I was there and my roommate for the time payed for everything when she made the reservation. Because I was the first to arrive, as expected, I was asked for a credit card when checking in. Of course I didn't mind this at all as it has happened at every hotel I've stayed at before. However, throughout the 5 days, random holds of different quantities were being place on my account. My roommate and I talked to the front desk and they assured me that the money would all be released after check out. I was ok with this and let it all slide. Everything was ok  and as promised, all of the holds were released on Sunday and my money was returned. I get home on Monday and check my account, make sure everything was ok, and continue about the routine of bill pay. Yet, to my dismay, I wake up on Tuesday morning only to find that my account is overdrawn by $468!!! I immediately logged on to check what was happening and realized that all of the charges from the Hyatt were added once again...ALL OF THEM!!! I thought they were no longer able to touch your credit card once you've checked out?! Of course I immediately contacted the Hyatt and my bank and after an hour phone call, they finally decided to give me my money back with a, \\"6-8 business day delay\\". Luckily I was able to get my money reimbursed and the overdraw fees reversed.

Our first time here. I also brought my aunt along as well. Very casual and laid back atmosphere (Your neighbourhood restaurant but better). We went around 7PM on a Monday and seemed like the better time to go. There were only a couple other tables there. We got the Chicken Satay, Bacon wrapped lychee and pineapple, Papaya Salad, Tom Ka Gai, Yellow Fish Curry, Pad See Ew (Sp?) and Coconut rice. We got Thai Iced Tea and Young Coconut for drinks!Chicken Satay - Usually there are a selection of beef/pork/chicken but there was only chicken here. I think 3 skewers would have been better for the price ($6) but we got orders of 2. As tasty as it can be! My only gripe (as with every other Thai restaurant) is that they have smooth peanut butter sauce instead of one's with crushed peanuts in it. I like the extra texture on my skewer. I feel the only place that has done that thus far is Tropika and that's Malay food. AHHHH. Bacon wrapped lychee and pineapple - We all agreed this tasted like a hawaiian pizza without the dough. Fruit was nice and juicy inside. Came with a bed of leafy greens. Papaya Salad - I had papaya Salad last week at another Thai restaurant and I can def say this is on top of my papaya Salad list. The salad has a bit of a kick to it and super zesty. LOVE LOVE LOVE. Tom Ka Gai - Coconut milk type of soup with lemon grass in it. There was a tiny roasted chili pepper which scared me a bit but there was no spice. My fav soup. Very flavourful. I read another review that the reviewer thought otherwise but I think it might have been a faulty batch as I enjoyed mine very much as did the rest of my group. Good amount of mushrooms and chicken. Yellow Fish Curry - Not too sure what kind of fish is in this but there were LOTS of onions and potato slices. The slices of fish were hellaaa thick slices. Curry pretty thick. We got a side of the coconut rice to eat with it which was perfect! I feel like it was in the middle of mild and medium spice. Pad See Ew - I find that these noodles are different elsewhere!! Again, normally we are given a choice between meats but we only had pork which we stuck with (another reviewer noted you could sub for beef/chicken). Little pieces of gai lan, mild, kinda salty, kinda amazing. Coconut Rice - The coconut rice here is REALLY mild. It's almost like a background taste. Thats the best way I could describe it. I had it with the Curry and I think it complemented it very well. The Thai iced tea here is a little bit too sweet for me but it was still nommy. There was only two servers working. I can see how service can be slow if there was a full house and take outs involved for that day. At the time we went it wasn't too busy so our servers were very quick to get back to us. In fact, they came back a couple times to see if we were ready to order and how everything was tasting. The food came out really quick and we ordered the whole menu (almosttt). There's free parking in the front (not sure if it is permit parking on the sides). OH and before I forget... we also got the deep fried banana. Pleasant surprise!! It's like deep fried banana 2.0. Huge scoop of ice cream and 4 pieces of little bananas. They've battered it with some shredded coconut. Was plenty for the 3 of us. We even doggy bagged some of it home!

Seriously.As always, the wings were delicious (Three Mile Island are my faves) with their awesome homemade Ranch dressing (can you call it dressing when it is that thick) and my friend had some form of salad that looked yummy.

Admittedly, I have a laundry list of food hang-ups/anxieties, and Buca di Beppo meets almost all of them: Italian-American food, multi page menus, \\"family style\\" portions, chain-ish restaurants, vaguely (but not quite) ethnic cuisine... Of course, there's nothing inherently wrong with any of these things; don't worry - I realise it's me, not you, Buca. I have been cleverly avoiding Buca for four years because of the aforementioned neurosis, *even though* one of my good friends works there. However, for one of our friends birthdays, her husband set up a surprise party at Buca, so obviously I couldn't start to explain that, no actually I'm a neurotic fool and can't go. So I put my crazy aside, and drove to the Arena District this afternoon. Slight misfortune - the boy was at band practice and had to arrive a little later than me, so I did have a moment of panic over the multi-page menu (I worry when places sell so many items that they need multiple pages - how can you do so many things and have everything be good? Isn't this just a sign of American gluttony?), but that was soon resolved when A. the boy arrived just in time to order and B. our friend who works there (who wasn't working today and joined us for lunch, which was awesome) just ordered everything for everyone anyway. I sort of get that at a place like Buca, it's best to just let someone who has been there before or knows what they're doing order a bunch of things to share. So, this family style business - as Lisa S. says, it can be a bit complicated. There was some discussion as to whether we should just order for the table (there were a LOT of people - we were in the Pope Room - so hilarious - being Catholic, the boy and I very excited to be able to spin the lazy Susan and have the Pope stare people down ;) or if people should order in small groups. Fortunately, our friend who works at Buca helped us with that - but if we didn't have him, I can see me being very overwhelmed and traumatized by this process. I was pretty anxiety-ridden before the boy arrived and people were trying to figure this out. And also, when we went to pay at the end, it became even more complicated, since I didn't realize the whole family style situation, and boy and I hadn't discussed it, so neither of us had cash, and everyone else apparently did... and there was just one check... so yeah, I'm just saying...that part was weird. The food is good - as I said, Italian American food makes me a bit nervous, what with all the cheese and pasta and bread and sauce and whatnot - so I tried to stick to meat. The meatball, chicken parm, and the other chicken dish I tried were all very decent. It's not what i used to get in the North End in Boston (which didn't make me nervous because it was more Italian than American), but it's not Sbarro either, you know? The people I was dining with really enjoyed it, so I'm giving it three stars with the note that my friends from Ohio thought it was great. This place is huge! And it's super kitschy, but that's the appeal - I lovvvvved all the pictures of the Pope, and I really like the picture outside of the ladies with cleavage eating spaghetti. Yeah!  I kind of thought of Buca as what Spaghetti Warehouse aspires to be (but will never be).

I personally love Deep Cove and find it a great oasis near the city. I was touring my friend visiting from Ontario and since Deep Cove was a stop we were making I suggested lunch here. I ordered the forage crepe and my friend had a less adventurous palette. As a result she ordered the grilled cheese. Simple enough right? Well my crepe was up almost instantly I sat for a while awaiting my friends sandwich so we could eat together. Eventually my friend said you just go ahead. That's always a little awkward. Plus I had paid for both so it's not like they were two different orders. It took about 15 minutes or so after my crepe for her grilled cheese to be called. Then they made it with avocado. She had not upgraded to this- mainly because she hates avocado. So since it had already taken so long making another one didn't seem like the best option... so they scraped the avocado that had been panini pressed in there off the bread and then served. Not great. I could tell my friend wasn't impressed. One of the staff members popped over and dropped off a 2 dollar off coupon, which was nice. That being said just the length of time and separate serving times aside from the avocado conundrum was enough to dock some stars. It's a really neat laid back vibe. The market is adorable.

This is a MUST skip restaurant. Worst service ever. The Teppanyaki guy (who looked 65 - 75) had almost no personality. The only good thing about the experience is that the group I went with could all laugh about how bad the service was. For the prices ($36.50 for the steak and chicken meal), I would have thought that a higher grade meat be used. The steak was so chewy that around the table, whoever ordered it, had found themselves spitting pieces into napkins. Chewy and gross. The chicken wasn't half bad, not the best, but when you're really hungry you'll pound it down. The food cooked was in some cases badly burnt (the friend rice was burned bad enough that we couldn't eat it... not blackened burnt, but cooked on a dirty cooking surface that had past burnt 'taste' on it, so the rice tasted of bad burnt food).Myself and another in our group had food sensitivities. We related these sensitivities to the Teppanyaki chef (mushrooms and scallops) and requested that he cook those items separately. The chef made such a big scoff about how much extra work it would be to do this that I almost got up and left the restaurant right there (and I should have). I love Teppanyaki and have explored most of them in Vancouver, including the Kobe Steak House (which is one of my favorites still). None of them have ever *ever* made a commotion the way this guy did. When he finally got 'over' it, he seemed extremely annoyed with me for the remainder of the time. The food was so bland that I was finding myself using the extremely runny ginger sauce / paste they used to try and add flavor to the food. I ran out of the sauce after the veggies and once the burnt rubbery meat hit the plate I wanted more sauce.  The 'chef' if you can call him that, had nothing on the grill yet, in between items he's cooking and proceeds to tell me he's too busy. He told me about 10 times in a row that he's way too busy. 'Cant you see I'm busy cooking?' Then repeat 'see, I am too busy. You get sauce after. See. I'm busy'. Just when I think he's done being busy telling me how busy he is, with no food on his grill... he then uses both hands to sweep over the grill and says 'I'm very busy cooking, you not bug me while cooking. You wait for me to finish.' ... I just *sighed*. I'd have usually told the guy off, but would have felt bad speaking like that to an elder of such... but still, wow. Really, reallllllly bad service. I wish I'd have walked.I was almost going to get the owner of the establishment to let them know they should quality test the food and service of the cook, but unfortunately, all the staff of the Japanese restaurant only speak pigeon english and chinese. (Which reminds me, the cook seemed to be nicer to the chinese clients, he kept telling us when we asked him for something 'me no speak english, me only cook', which made it difficult to explain the concept of medium rare for the beef and well done for the chicken). I can only laugh at this point for how bleak the experience was. Save your money and just walk to the McDonald's just up the road. You'll have a better meal at 1/10 the price. If somehow you're the owner of this establishment and you're reading this. Please take it to heart. You can't charge people that kind of money for food and service so bad it's laughable. Please send in a family member or someone the cook doesn't know (an english speaker only, just so you get the proper experience). Have them grade the food and service.PS. Yes, they offer 2 for one dinners at points. It's because they *have* to... and even with that \\"deal\\", I'd never ever go back. PPS. For perspective, I've been a member here forever and almost never write reviews. I feel terrible writing this kind of stuff because it will affect someone elses business, but people need to be warned.

If you have a party of six and are in a hurry, does it make sense to go to a small place that only has a single waitress/bartender/shucker?  And when you write a nasty review about the horrid wait that you so generously endured in that scenario, who looks worse in that review? You or the restaurant?  I was in town in Vancouver and passed by Oyster on my way to my hotel, and I thought it looked interesting.  So I went on my trusty Yelp to read the sage reviews on this place.  And despite everyone admitting this place had outstanding, fresh oysters, served up by highly knowledgeable staff at an incredible price, Oyster was getting the proverbial shucking knife between the eyes for its size and service speed.  Well, I went and I unequivocally loved it.  I enjoyed absolutely delicious local oysters (at a buck a piece), along with some of the finest clam chowder I've had anywhere, all paired with very affordable, quality New Zealand sauvignon blanc.  Oh, and it was delivered promptly and with outstanding courtesy and knowledge by Leslie, the all-in-one server.   We had a great time chatting while she served several other engaging patrons. Was it as fast as ordering a Big Mac?  No. Get over it.  Oyster was a wonderful experience, a great meal and more than a fair value.

The oatmeal was hearty and we were lucky to grab the absolute last bowl that morning (does it take more than like a half hour to make a decent sized batch of backup oats?).  We added the complimentary brown sugar and topped it off with coffee freebies of cinnamon and cream.  The almost $5 egg and cheese \\"everything\\" bagel was standard, nothing stood out here but it was yummy enough to devour the whole thing.  I'm not the biggest fan of chopped up eggs in a sandwich like this because they fall out easily but I did end up only losing about three pieces of yellow fluff. It was crowded on a Saturday morning, just like EVERYTHING else in Union Square.  We had to somewhat fight over a table in the front section after a lady took a chair from our table and we had to search around for another.  The dining section inside the old bank vault in the bank is by far the coolest aspect of Bloc 11 and I was jealous of those that were able to score a table inside the vault itself.  I bet it's even nicer when there is more welcoming weather for patrons to sit outside and dine on the attached patio.

Afterall, there was shift change and the barista just came in with a box of freshly made macarons. At the time, La Boite was one of the few places in town you could get over the counter macarons and I was excited to finally try them.  I got a few flavors (discount when you buy 4) with an almond milk latte. The barista was genuine, asked me whether I had any allergies before preparing my latte, and did not give me a judgmental frown when I told her I was driving to Houston. (Compared to some other Austin establishments, this was a relief)  I didn't open the box until after my drive and unfortunately they had come apart, so transport with care! I got the hazelnut with caramel, pistachio with chocolate ganache, and orange?  The Pistachio-Chocolate was pretty pleasurable because I have a soft spot for ganache, but the other fillings were a little on the sweet side. I guess I'm just not one of those people who thinks putting a few cups of sugar into something makes it dessert. The texture of the shells were right on though: light and crispy on the outside and slightly chewy in the middle. Yeah, I'm enamored with the innovative, sustainable design and think this is enough of a reason to give the place a try. While the macarons didn't blow me away, it wasn't a deal breaker.

And once I am seated (there's usually a loooooong wait), I usually love the food.  But it's very hit or miss.  For instance, the last time I visited, I walked out thinking I had one of the best meals of my life (homemade chicken soup, a huge salad with lots of veggies and fish, an oyster appetizer).. while the time prior to that I had sworn I'd never return because my food was pretty blah and the service left a lot to be desired.   I think that BST lacks a true sense of what it stands for.  It comes off as a classy, hip establishment, but I don't think it realizes that it is quite eclectic.  If they are going to boast a menu that is ever-changing and doesn't ever stick to a particular theme, they should market that aspect more so customers know it from the outset.   I think it's just confusing, and unfortunately, sometimes the food choices are just not good enough to back that up.    That said, I'll return.  When it's good, it's spectacular, and that makes it worth the try."},{"name":"Gandhi's An East Indian Cafe","address":"827 SW 2nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Hard to beat the downtown convenience and speedy service of Gandhi's.

The staff is pleasant, the box is cute. Friends were friendly, and new acquaintances made may now even be friends.Then, the not so positives: My sandwich was really boring (despite some tasty-sounding ingredients: red peppers, spinach, cheese; the roll it was served on was OK but did not taste bakery-fresh); my coffee was so-so; and I just wasn't blown away by the macarons. Coffee and sandwich were almost $9.The blackberry macaron was interesting -- I'd never had a macaron and didn't know what to expect, but it certainly wasn't a gooey, utterly sweet, berry-tinged mess. Still, it was all right. The lemon-basil was more reminiscent of savory yet sugar-shocking Lemon Pledge than a tasty dessert. Interesting idea, but not the best execution. Oh, and it was damned hot, far too hot to be sitting outside for even 5 minutes, but that's not the restaurant's fault. (Can you tell I'm still not sold on the whole outdoor/trailer restaurants in Texas concept?) It was sort of their fault, though, that arranging a large group was difficult. Would I go back? The overall presentation was so spot-on and the staff so pleasant given our overwhelming patio takeover, that yes, I'd give them another shot.

Unfortunately, IMO Sushi Maki is on the lower end of that scale. Having been here a few times now, the experience is always the same: open the door to a nearly empty/dead quiet restaurant with no background music... only to be met by the woman owner/employee barking at you \\"HERE OR TO GO?!!!\\" in a thick Chinese-English accent.Gee, what a nice way to greet your customer(s), it feels so hospitable and welcoming to have the first thing yelled out of the host's mouth be \\"HERE OR TO GO?!!!\\", instead of \\"Welcome to Sushi Maki, how are you this evening?\\" or something along those lines.Anyway, I digress. On this most recent visit I entered the nearly empty restaurant, got barked at with HERE OR TO GO, said TO GO, placed my order and paid, and then took a seat and waited for my order of 8 Teriyaki Beef Sushi Rolls. While waiting, I hear the woman employee constantly arguing in Chinese with the sushi \\"chef\\" (who I assume is her husband). They bickered back and forth for well over 20 minutes, while I was waiting patiently for an order of 8 teriyaki beef rolls. Does it really take that long to make 8 teriyaki beef rolls, especially when there were only 2 other guests in the restaurant?After nearly 30 minutes I was about ready to ask for a refund and leave, but as I was about to get up the chef saunters over with the takeout container of beef rolls and tosses it on the table where I was waiting. No mention of \\"here you go, sorry for the wait\\" or anything of the sort. I said \\"thanks\\" but didn't even get a response, as he made his way back to the kitchen. WTF?Needless to say I wasn't impressed with the service here -- slow, rude, arguing staff/owners, and not even authentic Japanese staff. The whole place just feels very uncomfortable, like you're in the middle of some family argument the whole time.So I leave the restaurant and start eating my Teriyaki beef rolls on the way home -- instead of being worth the wait, they were disgusting. Gristly, fatty, dried out strips of teriyaki beef in a sushi roll that fell apart immediately, and which was bland and tasteless. THIS is the garbage food I waited 30 minutes for? What a F'ing joke. I was really pissed off, after all that BS at the restaurant, only to be served crap food. Bottom line -- I won't be going back, and I suggest you don't either. The sushi place literally next door to this one (while a bit pricier) is far higher quality in taste and ingredients, and is actually authentically Japanese, so I'm not sure how Sushi Maki stays in business... but considering the competition in this city, they have a lot to learn when it comes to making proper sushi and even more so on restaurant hosting/etiquette to provide a welcoming environment/experience for guests. They score poorly on all fronts in this regard, so they get 1 star from me.

She had served a few others but never came by the table. Other people came in and waited a while to even get a order in. I finally went to the kitchen to find someone and said we would like to pay. Two were back there and said she would be out shortly. She came out a few min later saw our cards and told us its cash or check only. Said this is the way for many years. No where on the menu it stated this nor anywhere I saw. She said there was a ATM next door at the Plaid Pantry. Luckily we had cash. Overall it's a cool place.

However the service was not that great often neglecting their patrons, being stingy with napkins, and taking forever to bring the food out. Starting with the selection of the buffet, I would say there is quite a large amount to choose from. The menu has sashimi, basic sushi rolls, katsus, appetizers such as edamame, and ice cream to choose from. You make your selections on a sheet of paper and hand it to the waitress when done. You have to ask for another sheet if you want more. Overall the rolls were okay. I would say that they were better than buffet style sushi but nothing amazing or super fresh. The selections themselves are quite similar often being with shrimp tempura or crab stuffed in the middle with cream cheese and a fish of choice layered on top. If you want to make the most of the buffet I would skip out on the appetizers and get mostly rolls as the appetizers come in large quantities and aren't too special.The service was okay. We were seated immediately both times we came but when we wanted to order or ask for extra ginger or wasabi or for a refill we were often were left waiting and had to flag down our waiter. When we did ask for extra napkins they literally brought us one extra napkin. The food also took quite a while to come out and we would have to order our next set as we  received our first in order to get it out on time.

The crust was just holding the pie together. Anyway when I called to let them know, the person I spoke with didn't believe me (ha!) and said that's not possible. Well, I had pics to prove it because I prepared for this backlash. I sent in the pics and the management responded immediately with more than fair concessions to me. I find exemplary customer service so rare anymore, that I wanted to give them a shout out for this. They even said that words would be had with the staff person who doubted me. They actually recognized how to treat a customer right. I would add though, if just reviewing the experience of the counter staff, that they do sometimes make me feel like I'm putting them out.

Not only was it incredibly hot and uncomfortable, the large party was cheering as they chugged alcohol and were acting like they were at a cheap sports bar. We complained to the manager twice who refused to do anything about it. She actually came to our table to explain what she couldn't do instead of creating solutions. We watched two other tables move because of the noise. We were completely unable to enjoy our experience and asked for the check before we could even get a second round of drinks. The manager hid in the back and refused to apologize or do anything to make the situation better. As we signed our bill (charged fully for everything we ordered- that we couldn't even enjoy) the manager sent out four glasses of champagne, way too little too late! She had 20 minutes between the time we complained and actually received our check, waiting until we are literally walking out the door was ridiculous. We sent the champagne back and promised never to return. At this price point, I expect SO much more. If you want great small plates, go to the Odd Duck across the street.

I dragged the BF here for lunch, and then realized there is almost NOTHING VEGETARIAN on the menu. Ack! I ordered the egg and pork congee (#16) on the menu, and the chinese doughnut, which I thought was actually kinda gross. It seems everyone else likes it, so I wasn't sure if I had ordered the right thing or not? It was like eating a naked doughnut, but not as soft, sugary or sweet. The congee was piping hot, so hot that I could barely eat it, I had to scoop out small bits into the serving bowl and let it cool before I could eat it, but the congee holds the heat in so well that it never freaking cools down! I can't say I am a big fan of the mushrooms that were in the congee, they looked like slugs floating in a giant snail trail of soup. Bleh! I have never really been a big fan of fungus, but that's my own issue. IMO - Chewing on a portabello mushroom has the consistency of chewing on someone's ear. The BF ended up getting a veggie congee, with lettuce and mushrooms, and he thought it was alright. We waited awkwardly at our table, wondering as newbies at the restaurant if our server was going to bring us our bill or if we were supposed to just get up and head over to the register. It turns out that we were supposed to just get up and pay at the register, I think? There is a sign when you come in to advise you they only accept cash, so that is how we paid. The soup was like $5, and the doughnut that we didn't eat was $2, so it was a pretty cheap lunch, but probably not somewhere that I would try again since the veggie options are so limited."},{"name":"Jack's Pizza & Wings","address":"676 Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Coley is the king of pizza and high life's who blesses us with eye of the Tigers.

HH specials are great- Buy 2 get 1 free rolls, $2 off apps, $3 large house hot sake, and more drink specials.We were greeted and seated immediately in this stylish, clubb-y restaurant near the Mall at Millenia. Interior is very sleek, very clean, has an open floor plan split by a low wall forming the back of some booths - every seat has a view of the sushi bar. Trendy, up tempo music was playing the whole time we were there (think house and trance music with a pop-y feel)We started with the house hot sake (hello, it's only $3), and discovered it is Sho Chiku Bai, a very respectable brand for house sake. Served piping hot! Then we got some Ika Karage (crispy calamari) and garlic edamame. The calamari is panko crusted and cooked beautifully, though the breading did fall off a bit, and the thick, jam like sauce served with it really had us wishing for a light citrusy ponzu. Edamame was fresh and nicely salted.Since it's buy 2 get 1, we opted for 3 rolls off the signature maki list. Well, we already knew one of the rolls we wanted based off looking at the menu online, but we couldn't find it on the list. When we asked our server, he said they would still make it for guests who remember it. Nice.That roll is the Mega Spicy Tuna, which is a traditional spicy tuna roll topped with more spicy tuna. It was delicious, and had a nice kick to it. We also got the Dream Roll (shrimp tempura, krab, cucumber and cream cheese inside, topped with mango and eel). Very pretty and super yummy! Needed a bit more sauce, which our server promptly brought out sides of spicy mayo and eel sauce. Our final roll was the Rising Sun, with shrimp tempura and real crab salad, topped with escolar, tobikko, and red tempura flakes. Just the right amount of crunch and the crab salad was very flavorful and fresh.We didn't do dessert we were so full, but luckily the table next to us had a birthday. Their server brought out a dessert with a lit candle and the table sang for the guy. The dessert looked awesome tho! It appeared to be matcha cake, with 2 scoops of matcha ice cream and 2 crossed striped pirouette cookies. Very playful and elgantly plated.Overall, we will be back!

I would have liked to have tried the bath butler, but my timing didn't work out quite right (you have to call 2 hrs ahead, service from 9 am to 9 pm I believe. Room service in the morning was delicious. Portions were adequate (not HUGE!, but I certainly wasn't hungry afterward), and they had all the details just right (Bonne Maman jam rocks my world). Having breakfast, reading the Wall Street Journal, and watching the Today show, I almost felt like I really was on vacation, gearing up for a fun day in Boston (which I did have, but then I  came back home to JP). That being said, there's quite a high price for all of this luxury. I feel a bit like a rube, but some of the services were outrageously expensive.

The moment we walked in, we were greeted by the owners, and the female owner directed us to a booth.  She was very pleasant, and chatted with us briefly while handing us menus. She asked where we heard about the restaurant, and I admitted that I had just done a search for where to get quail in Austin, and she mentioned that theirs was award-winning.We started with an appetizer of the fried prickly pear cactus. The cactus was beer-battered, and the amount of batter on each piece severely detracted from the flavour of the actual cactus. I started just picking the batter off of my pieces, and after my boyfriend asked what I was doing and why, he ended up doing the same. The appetizer came with two dipping sauces - one queso, one ranch. I thought the ranch was okay, but I didn't like the queso with it at all, which is surprising, since I normally like queso with everything.We followed that with salads (which were average), and then our meals. The boyfriend had tilapia, and said it was good enough (there was shrimp on the side, so I couldn't touch it), while I ordered  the quail I was so excited for. Unfortunately, it was over-cooked, and while it was seemingly well-seasoned, it was far too dry. I ate about three bites of it from different areas of the quail (just in case), then gave up and just ate my baked potato instead.Our next course was dessert, and as soon as our waiter mentioned peach cobbler, I was sold. I looooove peach cobbler. What I received, however, was not peach cobbler. They brought it out in a cast-iron miniature baking pan. The \\"cobbler\\" was more of a bland peach \\"cake\\"; it was primarily breading, cooked till it was firm and cake-like, with four slices of peach on top, and two hidden along the sides; one of which was burnt and not worth eating. The bottom of the breading was also burnt, and none of the breading had peach flavour at all. Once we ate the peach slices (which seemed likely to have been from a can, and were able to be pulled right off the top of the \\"cobbler\\"), we just had a bland mass of plain, solid, breading - with a few shallow dips where the peach slices had been. You could easily lift the entire \\"cobbler\\" with a fork (which my boyfriend made sure to test).I was not impressed by the meal (though the waiter and owner were quite nice), and I didn't care to make a fuss at the time, but I do not intend to dine at Mesa Ranch again."},{"name":"Caffe Lil Italy","address":"178 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Horrible.

I was a regular and I guess I do not think much about reviewing places I frequent (not sure why).   I can tell you I have had everything on the menus for quite some time and spent thousands here entertaining out-of-towners.  I even had this place in my queue to write a 5 star review for the better part of a year -- glad I never did it.Recently, and the quality has subsided.  There are still a few gems and the jalape√±o shot it novel, but the food quality has noticeably declined over the past few months.  Still, I could normally understand a short lapse in quality as restaurants grow and change.  Unfortunately, this fall seems to be over a cliff rather than down a valley.  (Translation:  probably no hope).The mark of death, however, is the decline in service.  I was once happy to endure the long lines, because of the pride of experiencing this place as it grew.  Unfortunately, the management has not adapted to the growth.  As a result, the quality of the product suffered and, worse, the service just does not exist.It is a shame, because the staff are great, just ill equipped by management.  There are lots of ways for this place to turn it around.  They could organize staff, hire professional wait staff, increase staff levels, lean heavy on reservations, raise prices, or many other ways to do better.  For me, I will just find another nice local spot to spend thousands per year and entertain.Sadly, 616 management is growing complacent and there are so many alternatives in Austin.  Perhaps try Fixe or Seersucker if you are looking for great service, imaginative drinks, and high-end hometown cuisine.

The pizza is priced very reasonably, however.  If anyone remembers Rossini's (RIP) on Washington Avenue, Emilio's salads are about the same size, but much more expensive.

Never fails, especially after a night of drinking at Malone's. Amazing with a capital A. But... A huge but (hehe) is that I'd only ever recommend ordering from the window and taking the pizza to go or even just eating outside the restaurant. What my friends and I didn't realize was that we can't order from the take out window and sit in in the restaurant (despite us wanting to get some beers and the restaurant being completely dead, apparently because they charge more for pizza inside). So the reason I can only give this place a 3 has absolutely nothing to do with the food (again BOMB pizza), but more so the staff and how they handled the situation. My gf and I came into the restaurant while our guy friend was still ordering pizza. We *asked* if it was alright for us to sit in the restaurant (seeing as it's dead and we wanted some beers). As they exchanged looks, we added that we'll be getting beers. That was when they finally said it was OK but as my gf and I were walking towards a table, one of the ladies yelled out to take the table for 2. We told them that we had a third and was given the ok to sit down. When we were ordering our beers, I have to say.. The most incompetent server I've ever had. I'm generally a patient person but this server definitely tested that fact. Seems she had very limited English and restricted knowledge of her own menu. Anyhow... we all sat, had our beers and my friends had their pizzas. I didn't have any but later changed my mind and wanted a slice. So I ran out to order at the window (because that's where I've always ordered so I guess it was habit?) and as I approach the window, the lady staff in the background starts yelling out at the guy at the window \\"that's for here. IT'S FOR HERE\\". At this point I didn't realize there was a difference so I asked if there was a difference and the guy was like \\"oh yes it's a different price\\" so I told him, you know what, don't worry about it. I'm good\\" and ran back in. See, normally, I'm OK with going back to my seat and ordering my slice from there. Had they been nice people about it all, I totally would have..

They have good specials on the house ritas during happy hour - which I believe ends around 6:30. And it always makes me happy when there are food specials with happy hour. I've sampled their menu extensively but almost always order the cheese enchilada dinner. Their burger isn't much to speak of, but why go to a Tex Mex place for a burger? Tacos- can't go wrong with any of them, really. Maudie's is one of those places where I just always end up and I'm always satisfied. It's a decent restaurant with decent prices and decent service.

To our surprise, the gate was locked and chairs were stacked on top of tables. Apparently, Redd's is only open on Sundays for brunch and closes after 3p. My friends were hangry and looked to me to rectify this situation and I did just that when I opened my handy dandy Yelp app to find this \\"hot new restaurant.\\" 753 South has an equally cute of a patio dining area as Redd's with dangling string lights and all. Food was fantastic too. I wasn't too hungry so I didn't get the brick chicken the other reviews mention. Instead I ordered the Cuban sandwich. The Cuban was slightly oily but the flavors were just right. Plus, I loved that there was plenty of pickles inside the sandwich and on the side! My friends got the burger and the walnut apple salad and both really liked their food. In fact, my eyes kept wandering to other tables because all the food looked so good!

Perhaps I just ordered the wrong thing, but I had the mole, which was a good size serving of pork chunks with traditional brown mole sauce. Unfortunately, the mole was like the stuff you can buy at the grocery store, not an authentic abuela recipe. Bummer. The beans and rice were basic, much like what you'd get at a less expensive Tex-Mex restaurant. My friend, who is a frequent traveler to Mexico, ordered the Chile Colorado and pronounced it \\"nothing great\\". The free chips and two red salsas were good - one bright flavors, the other smokier and not as spicy. Our waiter, though friendly and fairly attentive, must have been new because he was pretty clueless about the menu, and had to go ask someone to answer our menu-related questions. The cucumber margarita was a fun twist on an old favorite, and it packed a punch. Nice atmosphere and easy parking, so that's a plus.

That's the problem. The food is so damn good that I trick myself and think I will be full when I leave this place, yet I leave not full and broke. And the cycle continues because I keep going back. So let's just put it out there -- Benatti is fucking expensive. Benatti's pasta is also perfectly cooked, handmade and delectable. Every element of our meal was wonderful, except the portion sizes of the pasta that are smaller than an appetizer but prized like an entree. We tried the tortellini emiliani which was filled with prosciutto, parmesan, veal and some other herbs. The sauce was light which allowed the pasta with all of its fillings to shine. For the main course I had the rack of lamb and she had the filet mignon. I'm drooling as I type just thinking of the rack of lamb. It was so damn good that I asked when it would be served again and came back a week later just to savor it one more time. The flavors were intense and layered. I loved every bite of it. The lamb was perfectly cooked, falling off of the bone, and the sauce--a red wine reduction of some type was just amazingly rich and tasty. YUM!!! Just thinking about this dish makes me want to leave work and go there RIGHT NOW. But I digress ...my wife had the filet which apparently was equally amazing with a Barolo reduction, cranberries and the scent of truffle oil. The filet was perfectly seared, cooked to her liking and if she could have licked the plate clean she would have. When we went back to Benatti I ordered the lamb and she ordered the filet. Service was actually quite good considering the awkward setup of the restaurant. I think someone should reconsider the setup so that the waiters do not need to squeeze in and out as they are moving about the restaurant. The atmosphere is warm and comfortable. The open kitchen adds a nice touch, although I got a little concerned when a flareup ensued ...concerned that was my rack of lamb getting burnt. It was all good though. We skipped dessert on both occasions, opting instead to drink more wine. We drank a couple of reasonably priced bottles of red and left very happy. Broke -- since we spent $200+ -- but happy. I would go to Benatti more if I could afford it. I love the location, it's nice not to trek down to the North End for quality food, but it's in a tough neighborhood for the prices being charged.

When we finally managed to place drink orders, however, they ended up coming after the food because they had been lost. The food itself was delicious, and the drinks were fine.

There are two sets of doors, one with a sign half taped to the widow and one set with no sign, we used the no sign set and walked in the unlocked doors. The bartender looked over and said the entrance doors are over there, then pointed to the other set. Confused we asked what he meant by that and he stood awkwardly for a second then decided to not lose our business and said never mind, sit where you want. Ok..... we found a table right next to the bar and he came over to take our drink orders, I had water with no ice and lemon, he forgot the lemon, eventually we had to ask for chips and salsa, then we ordered our food, they must have made every thing from scratch it took so long, we had to ask for more chips and salsa, mind you there were only 3 tables of 1-3 people including ours. The food finally arrived and it did taste good so no complaint there. I went to the bathroom and there was no towels so I had to wet hand the doorknob and ask for something to dry off with. it was lunch time on a Thursday and the place was empty so that didn't make much sense to me. The bartender/waiter never asked if we wanted our check split so we divided it by three and gave him $50 for $37.50, he then yelled over to us asking our friend with the least amount of tab if he wanted any change because he had given him $50. We all looked at each other and said yes and the guy asked the same question again as if he didn't understand why he wasn't given a $12.50 tip without question. I did the math for 15% of our bill which was $5.--- the guy gave us back $12 even. Ummm. So we tipped 15% and now I'm questioning why we didn't tip 10% or nothing for the troubles because the whole experience aside from what we got from the cook was total crap. I'd recommend order for pick up and save yourself the trouble."},{"name":"Pisces Rising","address":"239 W 4th Ave","city":"Mount Dora","stars":"3.5","text":"Great location.

BUT I made the mistake of visiting early afternoon on a Saturday. In fact, a friend dropped me and I had envisioned sipping coffee quietly and reading or writing. Despite there being no less than 4 or 5 fellows with access to the kitchen while I was there, no one cared that I wanted a second coffee, even though they watched me go to the counter with my cup and wait for several minutes. One fellow who watched me i took to be the owner, but who knows - could have been anyone. The first cup was served by a girl who announced that she couldn't take my credit card unless I made $5 or more in purchases. I didn't see this posted, and no one had objected during the week. I despise this practice and tend to not return to a place that does this. A place that has a coffee bar really should reconsider. I was also charged 25% more for the coffee I ordered than previously. She left afterwards, and no one manned the bar for several hours. That's right - hours.When my second trip to the empty bar was ignored, I switched to water as I waited for my ride, but reading or writing wasn't possible for the majority of the time, because all those fellows who had access to the kitchen were a bit boisterous (as in ridiculously rowdy). They were in the room with the bar. I wasn't the only one they made uncomfortable. The girl at the table next to me kept putting her book down and glaring at them.

The pork chops were barely covered in gravy, the rice and black-eyed peas needed a little salt, but the macaroni and cheese was the bomb.

In fact, it's my favorite food. So I've been to quite a few good sushi restaurants. I have to admit that this restaurant has, by far, the WORST sushi I have ever had.I ordered the salmon role as well as the eel roll. The salmon roll was just mushy salmon loosely rolled (which is not proper) in unseasoned rice (traditional sushi rice is \\"seasoned\\" with rice vinegar). The eel roll had cucumber, avocado, and eel. The eel tasted as if it had not been cleaned properly and the cucumber was roughly chopped (the art of sushi lies in the precision of the cuts of fish and vegetables). Again, it was loosely rolled and the rice was unseasoned. Before sushi I ordered miso soup. This was not the worst miso soup I had ever had, but it certainly wasn't the best. I almost couldn't call miso soup. It was supposed to have a miso/dash I base with tofu and maybe onions/mushrooms. Instead it was like chicken miso base with chicken and mushrooms? I ordered the green tea which was actually pretty good (thank goodness). The only reason I am giving this 2 stars instead of 1 star is that the service was better than average.

Why did I keep returning? Tradition. And the desserts are that good.\\nOver the years, prices went up- all desserts used to be $5, now they're $5.50-7 and such, still affordable.

I am quite picky about my chinese food so that is saying a lot. The skin is thin and the soup inside delicious. Must eat. The sheng jian bao (pork buns pan fried on bottom) are also great. The dough is fluffy and the buns also have tasty soup inside.For dishes, we tried several things. The first day we had their chicken (the one with a picture on the wall, not the fried stuff in the menu). It may look plain but this is a very very *classic Shanghainese dish. The chicken is tender and flavorful and not too salty. Eaten dipped in soy sauce with garlic and scallions. The price is also very reasonable. We wanted to get sliced sauteed eel but they ran out, so the owner/chef made for us chopped segments of eel with roasted pork. The eel was very fresh. The dish itself was delicious (though a bit too much meat, though the meat is also yum so meat and eel-lovers get the best of both worlds). The only thing is that compared with the other dishes, it was quite expensive--a lot more than the original sauteed dish (around $31 CAD). That was the only downside. The next day, we had sauteed shrimp - pretty tasty but nothing super special. Liked that it wasn't too greasy.The soup with fried tofu was pretty mediocre, wouldn't recommend.Overall: stick with the classic shanghaiese dishes. That is where this place really shines!! For many of the other not so good reviews that I saw, the people were really picking the wrong dishes!! Shanghainese people don't really eat mapo tofu, not super well known for hot or sour soup or stone pots for example...Not an excuse to serve mediocre food, but it is natural that places are really well known for some things and others are just there to satisfy people looking for particulars.When we went to the restaurant, we went relatively late in the day (2:30 PM) or sightly earlier but with a 5 person group and had no problems. For anyone with a small group, they recommend reservations. Make sure you do that and we thought the service and wait was perfectly ok!"},{"name":"Hudson Grille","address":"4046 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I NEVER get good service here.

Food is served quick and with good quality. I love the congee and the noodles they serve here: The congee is thick and creamy (who would like watery congee anyway?), and the noodles, whether fried or in soup has a nice bounce to it. So far, I have yet to experience the noodles being under/overcooked. Of course, this isn't your Chinese seafood restaurant, so don't expect any fancy entrees here. This is a great place for grabbing a bite with friends before heading off to someplace else.But like any Hong Kong eating place, service isn't at its greatest, and one would experience it during rush hours when waiting for a table. My tip for everyone during those hours is be assertive. Remember, there are millions of Chinese people on this Earth, you want to be noticed by a Chinese server? You better put yourself out there and be noticed!Another great thing is that they're open quite late, and have their late night specials.

However, the bartender was quick to explain the concept to us since it was our first time, and make food suggestions. We tried \\"smoke on the water,\\" a mezcal based drink with watermelon, mint, and lemon. Since we were sharing it, the bartender kindly split it in two glasses for us. The cocktail was well balanced, retaining the smokey character of the mezcal, but remaining fruity and refreshing. The food was alright. We tried four tacos, the mushroom mole tamale, plantains, and guac. Of all those, the guac and plantains were the best, while the tamale were weirdly flavored and not very good, having a strange sour taste to it. The tacos were small, a few bites each, and not overly impressive, the pork belly being the best of the bunch.Bartaco makes it easy to order, with sushi-style sheets, and the food is delivered to eat family style, as is ready, and its easy to try an assortment of stuff.

Then the side items and appetizers slowly followed. Each time someone brought food to our table, no one thought to check on refills for water and tea. I finally had to wave a server over to refill. The ramen noodles were of good texture, but my broth was very salty. I asked for a cup of hot water, which, to my surprise, came pretty quickly. Despite adding the entire cup of hot water to my bowl, it was still very salty! I will admit that I am a little more sensitive to salt than many people. Therefore, I did not complain.

We were gifted 3 nights 4 days so we were excited to be able to come for a long weekend with only a parking fee. ($22/day). We were a little apprehensive as many hotels have inadequate parking, however we were pleasantly surprised that we arrived at the hotel at 10p and there was plenty of parking without having to take a cab to the front door or park on the grass. Check in was super easy and Steffi was very nice and helpful.  She asked about high floor...balcony facing lobby...confirmed 2 queens and gave me directions off the elevator to where our room was. That had never really happened before. The room was super clean and a really nice size. We took this trip easy.  Woke up and decided to try the hotel restaurant for breakfast. They offer both a buffet and a nice menu.  We chose the buffet.  The resort fees cover breakfast for children under 12 for free with adult purchase.  (Resort fees are pretty high in my opinion but it was covered in our gift). The buffet was awesome. We ended up there all 3 days.  Service and food was awesome. Pool area is very nice and there is a single elevator near the pool so you don't have to walk through the whole hotel to go and come from your room. There is a full service Starbucks in the lobby. Don't know what time they close because they were always closed when we got back from the parks. We did visit there in the early afternoon and it was active but not as crazy as it gets in the morning.  I did figure out that the line is more about how slow they are to take orders, make and deliver the drinks vs how busy they are. I also didn't find the Sunday staff so friendly. The man who took my order looked like he wanted to be anywhere but there. They also have a full fledge Fed-Ex store. It was not open while we were there. We did check out the arcade. Definitely geared towards older kids. Very small area.  We didn't get to try the ice cream store, sushi or the bar area. Everyone was very friendly.  We really appreciate whoever found my daughter's Mickey Mouse doll (that she has slept with since she was a newborn. & she is now 6) and turned it in immediately to the front desk.  What a stressful 10 minutes when Mickey went missing. Why only 4 stars?  The 2nd day, our room was cleaned but the bed my daughter slept in has not been touched. The remote kinda sorta worked and we have a travel DVD player that we were unable to connect. The sinks are too high for children. We travel with a cooler and we had to bring the cooler in the bathroom each time she needed to wash her hands and/or brush her teeth. Although the resort fees say that bottled water is included there is a $3.50 tag on the water, which makes a person afraid to drink it.  You wouldn't not pay a resort fee and if it is free it shouldn't have a price tag. All in all it was a great visit.

Ridiculous and unacceptable. Not sure if our server was new or just slow or didn't give a crap but when we asked if the kids Mac and cheese was boxed she had to go ask.When a customer at the booth next to ours complained that he had gotten the incorrect side she said she would have to ask the manager if she could replace it.  What?  I worked for Apple restaurants for a while and that is not customer service.  The manager then came to the table next to us and argued with the guest stating that he brought out the new side as soon as it was rung in - essentially arguing with the guest- we personally timed it as over 8 minutes to bring a side of potatoes. He should have graciously brought the new side out and apologized, not antagonized the guest.  They had to wait 10 minutes for their check after they asked for it and it took us quite a wile to get ours as well.  In the meantime the server left our table full of dirty dishes and didn't bother to pre-bus anything the entire meal.Drinks were not refilled, had to ask for side plates...they should be thankful we weren't secret shoppers because they would have failed today for sure."},{"name":"Castagna Restaurant","address":"1752 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"If you make a reservation anywhere near Valentine's Day, they will call you the day before to tell you that they have raised their prices $50/head.

The menu and wine list were what we had in mind and have experienced in similar bistros, both here and in France. So \\"check\\" in this catagory as well, with the comment that there are some bistrot items I'd like to see that aren't on the menu and, and this is big deal for me, the Bavette is described on the menu as a skirt steak but I'm pretty sure it's more correctly a hanger steak. A bavette and frites, and a glass of Rhone red is a satisfying meal and what I seek at a place like this and i don't know that i can get it here.  The cooking........competent, clean, good, maybe lacking flair. Good service, a clean room, call it a clean modern bistrot without too much in-your-face-frenchness (no black and white posters of kissing Parisiens) - maybe lacking some menu items and lacking a wine list long on interesting French wines (but so is this entire province). I'll have to come back with a smaller group, and hope i don't sit next to a group like ours, to really know what Au Comptoir is like. Vancouver is desperately lacking a good casual, inexpensive and boisterous bistro like Le Pichet in Seattle.

All the dishes were inventive and delicious but the fois gras, grilled eggplant, halibut and all three desserts were the highlights for us. The wine pairings were excellent. I like how sherry, vermouth with soda, and craft cider were mixed into the pairings to break things up. Our server for the night just happened to be the wine director of restaurant, Brent. He was very knowledgeable. However, we felt the overall service was a bit impersonal. I had recently taken a few wine classes and was interested in chatting a bit more about the wine pairings, but Brent would introduce each wines and rush off. We got the feeling that he didn't want to engage with his guests. We were not asked at the start of our service how we were doing, whether we are celebrating a special event even though I had noted that when I made the reservation. So while menu and the wine pairings were technically well executed, we cannot say this was an overall exceptional experience that commanded $600 price at the end (with automatic 20% tip).

I had the vegetable bowl - a sweet potato/kale medley. This was surprisingly small (don't think it'll be huge hash), but it was so good because the kale was slightly roasted and crispy.I didn't get to try a bite of my friend's breakfast sandwich. He inhaled it, so I'll just assume that's a thumbs up. I did get to taste the french toast though and it was heavenly. Three thick slices slightly caramelized on the edges.The service gets a 4, good but not great. Make sure to prepare accordingly, the portions are not large.

I have to say for the dessert you find in a theme park, it was awesome and detailed. The egg is a white chocolate shell, over chocolate cake and vanilla frosting at the bottom. The best part was the dinosaur claw coming out of the egg. It looked awesome and cool but taste was a little weird. It was like tootsie roll material, very chewy. The dessert was great, especially if you are a Jurassic Park fan. The only thing I did not care for was the dessert is served in a bowl and on a plastic plate.

I love the setting, I love Brad the waiter, he knows his stuff and is full of helpful suggestions. A guy who seems to go the extra mile for you. I have eaten here at least 6 times. I must preface my comments with the following caveat - I am Italian. \\nAs far as appetizers go I adore the Gorgonzola Crustini. The Caprese while complete with all the requisite toppings was bland. Not enough seasoning to bring it all together. We were a table of three and all had pasta dishes. I have now eaten ALL of the pasta and can tell you there is but one worth ordering, not including daily specials. It is the sun dried tomato with cream. The Putanesca was overwhelmingly seasoned with anchovy. It was the worst I have ever eaten. It simply did not taste good and I regretted ordering it from the first bite. Many of the pasta dishes are way too salty. I simply don't get this. The explanation from the waitress, or perhaps justification, is that the meats added are high in salt and thus provide the saltiness. I don't see why that can't be adjusted. It makes for an unpleasant dish and the need for much water later on. As I mentioned earlier I have had pasta there on all 6 of my visits and this is a theme you can't escape. The pizza, which I have not ordered but had a slice of, tasted good. This seems to be a restaurant that needs to change the menu and address some basics.

I've had the tilapia patacon before, so I knew that was good. My bf had the lomo saltado and I could smell the soy sauce from his plate before even tasting it. Unsurprisingly, his dish was a bit too salty and low on rice to counterbalance that out. I also sampled the picada, which was good but not anything exceptional. While it was a good meal, it was slightly disappointing. The drive to Gahanna is a little further out for me and other than the broader hours, I didn't see how this place offer anything beyond their El Arepazo location.

I  love that both places are open late every night, and their respective grills are open till at least 0100. And that's right about where the similarities end.\\nI found staff @ the Matador to be pretty friendly and engaging. The Blondie @ Casa, however, behaved as though her entire countenance would crack and crumble to the earth, if the corners of her tautly-drawn mouth drew even slightly upward, in the vague direction of a smile. The Cynic in me finds such behavior bizarrely reassuring, telling me that all is right in the universe. The rest of me, however, is perplexed and put off by the snootiness. These flib-gibs DO realize their tips are affected by their attitudes, don't they? Maybe they're too busy calling in sick and abusing Family Leave to care......\\nI found that the clientele @ Casa was of a slightly older and higher class than The Matador, and parking access was decidedly easier. But Casa del Matador is to Tex-Mex, what PF Changs is to real Chinese. Don't make a fool of yourself confusing this for las comidas autenticas....\\nThe prices, for menu items I directly compared w/Matador, were more expensive across the board @ Casa. The steak chunks adorning the nachos, for example, were superficially impressive, but the toppings on the whole were easily engulfed by the plain tortilla chips in the mix.

I'm not a huge fan of the wasabi sauce, but give me cocktail sauce and a lemon and I'm a happy girl.Dinner was fish tacos for me and a burger for the boy.  Fish tacos were outstanding!  The fish was perfectly fried, not greasy, heavy, or otherwise over cooked as fish can so easily be.  It was, in contrast, light, flaky, and a perfect medium for the \\"special sauce,\\" coleslaw mix, and pico de gallo.  A little kick, but not burning my tongue off.My only helpful hint (not criticism), is that we were not asked if we wanted dessert.  I suppose we could have asked for it, but we didn't.  It doesn't matter much though - we'll go back for sure and can order dessert then.Thank you JC for reaching out, bringing us back in, and showing that customer service can improve based on constructive criticism.

I suppose since this area is typically eclipsed by perpetually awful traffic, people getting booted in the Trader Joe's lot, park-goers on foot on their way to festival of whatever at Piedmont, and the creepy dry cleaner, I suppose I just overlooked it over the years. This is a pretty trusty little lunch spot and I'm glad I had the chance to visit. It wasn't busy at all when we arrived, so we jetted straight up the rooftop patio for some sunshine. It's a phenomenal setting for a meal if the weather is right. Plenty of shade from the umbrellas at each table and even some rather tall, elder Midtown trees to provide some intermittent shade. The food was all pretty decent -- standard guac (served in the largest bowl I've ever seen), queso, chips, tacos, enchiladas, etc. I opted for the \\"bowl,\\" which is similar to the burrito bowl from Chipotle, but with a bit more vegetal chaos. Can't say that I was the biggest fan of my mess of an entree with all of the steak, some properly sauteed onions, others raw, what tasted like canned corn, and overdone rice. I'd love to revisit and try something else from the menu, though. The service was also a little spotty. Several times, we were brought food that wasn't for our table and waited an odd amount of time for the queso and guac -- both came right before our entrees. Nothing detrimental.

Smooth, without that off-putting bitter aftertaste.I got a slice of Old World Farm Apple Pie ($4.75). This pie uses organic heritage apples from Old World Apple Farm in Ridgefield, Washington (hence the pie's name).I thought the pie was pretty good, but probably would have been better had I requested my slice warmed up (not thinking, doofus...). Excellent consistency on the filling, with ideal use of apple pie spices for my liking. I would have liked to see a bit little more apple in there. I enjoyed the embedded sugar granules on the top crust. The crust itself was on the harder side, likely from staying out so long on the shelf.I was a bit taken aback by the price (any slice of pie is $4.75). I won't blame Random Order. I could be like many others and blame G.W. Bush. But eh, it is what it is.Apparently the pie I have to try is the Vanilla Salted Caramel Apple Pie.

Not a lot of attentiveness but we never had to wait too long and it was rather busy.2.  Food -  pretty tasty overall.  And the happy hour really can't be beat.  One of the best ones in town, food-wise.  We started with the chips/guac/salsa.  The chips and salsa were free apparently but the guac was $5 a pop.  I'll skip this next time.  It was pretty bland.  I was stuffed by the time happy hour rolled around but I tried the fried shrimp tacos and the chorizo tacos.  The chorizo tacos were TERRIBLE.  Strangely seasoned, DRY (how is this even possible with sausage), and gristly!  Will not order anything with chorizo from them in the future.  The shrimp tacos however were delightful!  The shrimp were crunchy and slightly sweet.  The portions were huge at only $5 and $4 for two tacos per order.3.  Drinks - expensive but tasty.  The highlight for me was the cucumber jalapeno margarita.  Refreshing and delicious with a smoked paprika spicy rim.  The mango margarita was a snoozefest but it got the job done.4.

However, I have been noticing this trend that my family and I have been coming back here all the time when we want to go out to eat, and we all typically finish every bite of food. Another rarity happens: I order desserts here. So screw it, this place easily gets 5 stars from this old lady.I like to rate restaurants/bar establishments based upon five things: 1) Quality of food. 2) Customer service. 3) Pricing. 4) Atmosphere. 5) Location. This place is 5 stars across the board from me. The food is ridiculously good and cooked properly. I have had seafood dishes here (Salmon dinner, fish sandwiches, shrimp, and fish tacos) and they have been winners each time, never a let down. I have also had pasta dishes (seafood alfredo, seafood macaroni and cheese, shrimp scampi), and burgers....everything is cooked to perfection and every taste bud in my mouth and tongue is left begging for more...The zingers are out of this world, and even the salads I have tried have been pretty darn good, and I am a self-proclaimed carnivore who typically believes that one truly does not win friends with salad. However, they are even pretty tasty here. Aside from everything on the menu, I also highly recommend the appetizer platter, as that is always a hit when we come back here....the creamed spinach dip it is served with is truly a thing of beauty. Customer service here is always great, the servers are attentive and engaging. We have a 10 month old and they always make him smile just by taking the time out to wave hello to him and be silly with him for a brief moment of their time, which I know they don't have to do and are busy enough as it is, but they go that extra mile to make sure every person is happy. The food comes out in a pretty good amount of time, I never once found myself saying \\"finally\\" under my breath when the food was ready. Also, if you have little ones the kids menu is pretty extensive and has loads of fun activities on it, and they can bring home their cups! The prices are reasonable, and each day of the week they typically have deals on drinks and even entrees. The desserts are fantastic, I shared Captain Jack's buried treasure with my husband one time, highly recommended. The other day I had the equally large in charge Captain Jack's nutty brother. It is basically a peanut butter ice cream cake slice topped with hot fudge and warm peanut butter sauce, with a nutter butter cookie on top, and it gets better...a nutter butter crust. I killed the whole thing by myself, which is a rarity as I have generally not a big dessert person. The atmosphere is always fun, though it can be pretty loud as it is a sports bar on I-Drive and this means it is always pretty packed with rowdy sports fans sitting at the bar. However, I usually find their silliness infectious rather than annoying, which can be said for the same type of crowds at times, but for some reason, this place never manages to attract jerks. It is for everyone: sports fans, families, couples on a fun date, or lone wolves (which I was up until about 2 and a half years ago). This is because the prices are good, the food is good, and they always have games on for everyone. It caters to all walks of life. The location is on I-drive in the heart of south Orlando, which is a large stretch of road that has a vast array of bars, pubs, restaurants, and gift shops. I highly recommend Miller's on I-Drive.

I got a \\"commuter croissant\\" and a cup of coffee. The prices were reasonable ($4ish for the croissant). \\nThis establishment is a popular brand in California known for high quality food and service. Unfortunately the execution in Washington leaves a lot to be desired. The decor is nice ... like that of an upscale fast-food place, like a Panera Bread, or like the new burger joint, \\"The Habit\\" (another California transplant). You order at the counter and then a server brings the food to your table. SEATING: There were several tables vacant, but none were wiped down. So I found a table and wiped it down with a napkin. While I waited for my food, I saw one of the servers clearing tables, but not wiping them down once they were cleared. FOOD:\\nThe quality of the food is fantastic. The croissant was fresh, the bacon was thick and smokey, and they use REAL cheddar cheese (not the American plastic cheese-food common in fast food sandwiches.)\\nUNFORTUNATELY the sandwich was not completely heated. The cheese was not melted, and parts of the sandwich were lukewarm and parts were cold. \\nWhen my food was brought to my table, they had forgotten my coffee. The server asked if I wanted cream. When they brought my coffee it was in a paper cup (I was dining in) instead of a ceramic mug.

It's a quaint little restaurant in a very non-discreet area that has a cafe vibe.   Girlfriend and I ordered the Kanji Ramen, Sukiyaki Ramen, and the Gyudon - Beef Donburi. The Kanji Ramen has a bit of a smokey flavor and is less oily than Tatsuya's ramen, making the dish feel lighter. The Sukiyaki Ramen is the reason I continue to come back here. Unlike the traditional ramen, the bowl comes with noodles slightly submerged in a sweet beef broth/sauce. The idea is to drink a small amount of broth with each spoonful of noodles, resulting in a very satisfying bite.  Since the noodles aren't drowning in broth, they retain a firmer texture. The beef itself can be on the dryer side, but overall it doesn't take away from a very tasty experience.The beef Donburi is basically the rice version of the Sukiyaki. It's a decent choice if you get another ramen bowl and are still hungry, but otherwise I'd just order the Sukiyaki."},{"name":"Olive Garden Italian Restaurant","address":"300 West 436","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"This is our favorite to go to Italian restaurant, we love the shrimp Alfredo.

Luckily, he also really likes the food at Dinesty so it's win-win!We ordered the seafood and vegetables over crispy rice, the pork/shrimp/scallop soup dumpling, pan-fried pork dumpling and the steamed Chinese toon buns, because we had no idea what those were.The crispy rice came out first and they pour the seafood sauce over the rice, which ideally gives it a bit of a snap crackle pop rice Krispie effect.  There was a decent amount of topping and I liked how the rice didn't drown in the sauce.  The soup dumplings were next and were freshly made and hot.  We thought the skins were a good thickness and there was adequate soup inside.  I didn't find a lot of shrimp or scallop inside though, they must be minced up pretty small.  My husband did find a few shrimps in his dumplings.  You might as well get the original pork (similar flavour).Pan-fried pork buns were steaming hot and fresh out of the pan, we both really liked these!The \\"toon bun\\" is actually a steamed minced pork and vegetable bun that is pretty tasty and not too greasy.  Instead of a pork meatball like the other two dumplings it's more of a predominantly vegetable filling.  It reminded me of homemade filled buns made by my roommates mom back in school and was a nice way to finish off our meal. All that food + a juice came out to a reasonable $33 before tips.

Not sure why it took that long since the restaurant was pretty empty when we were there or why they didn't bring the dishes out one at a time.

Bland, and missing garlic. \\nHowever pita they came with were delightful, warm and toasty, fluffy with butter and herbs. Only it didn't come with enough of the bread and our waitress never came back until she brought our main course, so we were left frustrated and hungry without bread to make these dips eatable.We got the Corinthian pizza for the table. After my first bite I knew we would've been better off getting a pie from the Fresh Slice below the restaurant. The crust was doughy and bland. The toppings weren't fresh- we kept getting chunks of watery, defrosted frozen spinach in odd intervals. The cheese was flavourless as can be, as was the sauce. Pretty much all of the other ingredients (olives, mushrooms) came from a can. It made me long for the much, much better quality frozen pizza's there are on the market.

We came here a few weeks ago for dinner, having checked out the glowing reviews.  Despite the busy time, we were seated promptly, and got our drinks quickly.  That's where things started to go wrong.Our server, a man with a long braid, simply vanished.  I thought I saw him on the patio, flirting with several ladies, but it's hard to tell.  His friend was nice and got us our drinks, but he said he couldn't take our order until the server came back.  We waited over a half hour for him, and were on the verge of walking out when he finally showed up.  My partner ordered the daily special Mac and Cheese, and I had the meatloaf platter.  When the food finally came, the special mac and cheese was completely bland, as if no one had added any seasoning.  It took a ridiculous amount of salt before my partner said it was edible.  My meatloaf, however, was the worst.  It came coated in ketchup, and from the first bite, that was all I could taste.  I'm not a big ketchup fan, so I scraped it off and tried again. I hadn't believed that food could taste like noting at all, but that's exactly what happened.  There was no flavor at all, once you got rid of the quarter-gallon of ketchup.  It was worse than a cheap street hot dog-- no matter what I put on it, it still had no flavor whatsoever.  Quite honestly, I think the napkin had more taste to it.  We tried to complain to our server, but he was gone again, back to the table full of ladies.  Someone else brought us our check, but apparently they couldn't accept our money until he came back, which took over 40 minutes.  We had to complain to a manager, so we could just pay our bill and get out.  Bottom line: Most of the servers here seemed decently nice, but one bad apple can spoil the whole barrel.  In this case, a ridiculous wait for service and our check, followed by extremely subpar food, means we will never be coming back.  I'm sure they just had a bad day, but I'm not about to risk that much time and money giving them another chance."},{"name":"Rimsky-Korsakoffee House","address":"707 SE 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"A visit to Portland would be woefully incomplete without a visit to this quirky little dessert and coffee place.

This gastro-pub takes signature dishes and revolutionizes them, waltzing over your taste buds and and offering a unique experience overall. The first thing you'll notice, if you drink, is their exceptional cocktails menu. Having grown up in Wisconsin, and seeing the typical brandy old-fashioned, I was more than amused, and enthused to see that they offered a bacon infused bourbon old fashioned. Needless to say it was delicious, and the candied bacon strip that acted as the drinks sole garnish was the perfect kicker. From there me and the party I was with tried two starters, the pretzel (a standard soft pretzel with an exceptional mustard) and a pork dish which I believe has been discontinued (delicious as well). As an entree I decided on the Pork Porterhouse which was served with a compressed melon gastrique; the Porterhouse was phenomenally cooked, and impressive in size and flavor. The compressed melon garnish offered a refreshingly contradictory flavor so as to create a clashing crescendo of flavor when eaten with the porterhouse. We finished with dessert, as is customary, and I elected to try the deconstructed banana cream pie. If you're a fan of banana based desserts, or the fruit themselves, this will forever change how you look at dessert. Par-none the best dessert i've ever had, and left me amazed to this date. The service was exemplary, the food fantastic, and the overall experience memorable and unique.

I thought the price was a little steep at this quality. The chips were cut thick and good (I haven't had a fry I didn't like) but the coleslaw came from a bag in the fridge. The pieces of fish were substantial but it was pretty flavorless and I wondered if they came from a bag in the freezer... the tarter sauce was supposedly homemade and good but you only get a little bit in a teeny plastic cup.

Jamaica Plain is appropriate for their market but Central Square and Davis Square need one of these as well for political reasons. It's not so much of a Chinese takeout place look anymore, but before they re-opened after renovation, El Oriental de Cuba looked sort of a Chinese restaurant except you hear nothing but Spanish (and some English) and you see equally rich flavored salty food. That atmosphere is still present today, and although the place is nicely renovated, they still use plates that were bought from Chinese restaurant supply houses.The food is very tasty, perhaps on the salty side, but very good. Shredded beef is a classic, beef tongue, snapper in spicy sauce, etc., are also my favorites. Beef tongue is really tasty, and unless you try it and love it, you aren't really an open minded person (ha!). If you are bored with mango shake, try mamay and other tropical fruits. One thing about this place is that their climate control is not always perfect, depending on the season. Some seats are a bit too cold, but that's same for a lot of places.I don't know how many places in Boston area who self-identify Cuban, but this is the only real deal."},{"name":"Tin Shed Garden Cafe","address":"1438 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This is a fun chill place.

And, if you can't manage a business 7 nights a week than don't be open 7 nights a week.  One of my friends ordered the exact same thing he'd ordered a few nights previously, but the meal was woefully different.  We took clients to Joe's who had never been because we trusted the experience from previous visits.  Big disappointment.  Our clients were under impressed so Joe's let us down.

I ordered the smothered chicken, collard greens, mac and cheese and washed it all down with some sweet tea. The chicken was perfectly crisp on the outside and nice and juicy on the inside. The gravy that the smothered chicken comes in was so good I could have licked the plate. The collard greens were cooked to perfection, I should have gotten another side! I ended the meal with peach cobbler made in house and thought I should treat myself so I got it a la mode.The restaurant is on the smaller side and the walls are lined with signed pictures ranging from celebrities to politicians.

If I did, it was unmemorable. Decided to go here this weekend for dinner with the wifey. Unfortunately during our time here, a \\"portion\\" of their power went out. Apparently they have two different lines serving the entire building and one of the feeds went down. The major appliances such as the air conditioner and exhaust system in the kitchen went down due to not having enough power which caused the entire dining area to fill up with a thick smoke. The smoke detectors went off and were promptly removed by the staff to stop the sound. The lights also dimmed and ceiling fans came to a crawl. Instead of turning off the non-essential items so major, important items such as the kitchen exhaust could remain operational, they left everything turned on and opened the doors and windows. Then, to rob the major appliances of even more power, then tried plugging in multiple fans to direct the smoke from the kitchen grill away from the dining area. Some common sense would've gone a long way in this situation. I do not fault them for something beyond their control, this was more of an observation of how they handled the situation. After a while they did offer patrons inside the choice of moving outside. They also finished preparing our meals which were already ordered and that's where we come to the meat and potatoes (pun intended) of this review.I ordered the 16 oz. \\"Delmonico\\" ribeye steak. I LOVE steak. Of course the ribeye is the \\"steak lover's steak\\" so I typically order that when I go someplace for steak. I will definitely never order this one again. Despite their issues with the power, the steak was cooked to the correct temperature; however, the \\"sweet whiskey marinated\\" it is flavored with is terrible. It tasted like a bad teriyaki sauce and I personally feel it has no place on any cut of beef, particularly a well marbled piece such as a ribeye. To make things worse, it cost me $45. I don't mind paying that much for a select cut that is properly aged, but I was very disappointed with this one. I think this place can charge so much just because they have a niche market in a touristy area. In a place with competing restaurants I doubt they would survive long. The rest of our meal was okay which is why I'm giving an A-OK rating.Due to the power issue our service was definitely lacking but at least the waiter was polite, when he made it to our table. I was very disappointed though that the management did not come around and apologize to the guests. I was also surprised that we were not offered any sort of discount for the inconvenience or disruption in service; not even a free desert or gift card. I understand things happen that is sometimes beyond the control of the staff, but when they do, a good manager will be sure to let the guests know they are appreciated, despite the poor dining conditions.I'm not in a big hurry to return to this place."},{"name":"Yami Yami Japanese Restaurant","address":"231 Peachtree St NE, Ste B-35","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"worst noodle EVER had, no real bowl, the miso soup base is okay.

My guacamole  burger was superbly delicious--and big enough for two people.The fries are those AMAZING crispy waffle fries, and the mustard, ranch, or queso sauces are all \\"home\\" made, and are absolutely mouth watering.Even my picky, picky boyfriend was very satisfied and even mentioned that we should go back (coming from him, that's a lot)!Reasonably priced, too. For a big ass burger, a huge Cheese steak, chips, fries, and two drinks, I spent about $17.Not bad at all.If we weren't all the way in Round Rock, we would be there more often!"},{"name":"Maudie‚Äôs Hacienda","address":"9911 Brodie Ln, Ste 900","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Our go-to Mexican restaurant.

I had to go up to the hostess and explain that we haven't seen our waiter in 20 minutes.  This wouldn't have been a big deal but we were going to the Huntington Theatre in an hour and couldn't sit around.  The hostess came by as we continued to wait and apologized saying someone had a severe allergy.  I didn't believe that.  If someone has a \\"severe\\" allergic reaction, they need to call an ambulance or be running out of the restaurant.  Is our waiter the paramedic responding to the emergency?  Highly doubtful.  Just say sorry, no need to make up things.We got a free crab dish for showing out theatre tickets, but then the waiter walked away with our tickets.  After waiting about 10 minutes, I again went up to the hostess and explained that those weren't just ticket stubs that can be thrown away and to please make sure that the waiter brings them back.  The waiter didn't apologize when he came back for the poor service and didn't really smile at all.  Actually I felt sorry for him because he looked tired.  And now the reason the place gets any stars is because the food was pretty good and the price was decent.

They always show you the food before bagging it, so make sure they put enough teriyaki on the chicken cause it can be a little dry sometimes.

First of all, I ordered 2 overpriced bagels, and it took 20 minutes to get them to us. How lovely that the cook decided to take his lunch break right after I ordered. Which means, he ate his food, and lingered with a friend, while my daughter and I were starving. Also, I saw the cook in the kitchen frequently dusting pieces of hair/dirt/etc off the food while he prepared it. The only reason I ate the food is because it cost an arm and a leg, and I was really, really hoping that by some miracle that the restaurant would live up to its reputation.

I sat inside, the restaurant is really open with a view of a TV from every seat. The menu had serval options within each section: Apps, soup/salad, entrees, and sandwiches. All looked delicious. We got the buffalo tenders for an app which were really crispy with a medium spice buffalo flavor- two thumbs up. I also got the fish tacos which were huge! The mango chipotle salsa on it was probably one of the better mango salsas I've ever had. My friend ordered the steak tips which looked really good too. The potion was huge, enough to fill you up and have enough to take home for a second meal. The offer complimentary chips and dip which was really different. It tasted like a French onion dip - which I loved!At every table they offered a USB outlet which I thought was really cool and different too. Over all great experience!

Just some chairs and tables put together. I honestly didn't think it was going to be good.You can choose flavored broth but since it was my first time trying this place I wanted to try the house broth. Which was not bad, it had ginger, scallions, and other Asian herbs in it.The menu has a really good selection of everything. Meats, veggies, sides, even choices for vegetarians.\\nThe vegetables are Asian vegetables same with the sides. If you're not familiar/adventurous with foreign food, I don't think you would like this place.I got fishballs, corn, bamboo shoots, clams, pork, scallops, black mushroom and other Asian vegetables. \\nThe dipping sauce provided was delicious.My boyfriend ordered two plates of lambs and I ordered two plates of pork along with two plates of sides.It is definitely worth the $44 for two people.Bottom line: I recommend it to people who are familiar with real Asian food who will appreciate the choices. Otherwise you are probably going to order a bland meat with some greens and I almost guarantee you won't get your money worth at this buffet."},{"name":"Flippers Pizzeria","address":"11062 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Not bad Pizza for the price.

When he wasn't busy verbally abusing the host so that we could hear him, he was running in circling trying to look busy.  The menu was particularly lackluster this time, a mixture of burgers and trying to be elegant entrees but without enough elections in either category to give everyone an option.

I first started coming here with my grandparents(this is still their weekly date spot...adorable). As an adult, this is always the place we come for a special occasion. Birthdays, anniversaries, you name it. This place will make it special. The ambiance is so romantic and special if that's your thing. When I went last week, that's just what I was looking for(it was my boyfriend's birthday, after all). As always, we started with cocktails. I got my new favorite drink, a lemon basil Manhattan. A very simple drink made with bourbon, lemon juice, simple syrup, and basil leaves. The flavor combination was amazing(I even tried to recreate it at home the next night...and several nights since). Nathan had a classic Manhattan and they put in those special Luxardo cherry(basically, gourmet maraschino cherry imported from Italy and nothing like a maraschino cherry you've ever had). With our cocktails, we ordered the Smoked Salmon Roulette, which was a really excellent salmon spread with salmon, eggs, red onion, dill, and mustard and served with toasts and pickled onions. It was so good. For dinner, Nathan went with the New Zealand Lamb rack. A perfectly cooked medium rare rack of lamb with a rosemary demi sauce, mushroom risotto, and brussel sprouts. I tried a bite of the lamb and it was the best lamb I ever tasted. I will be getting this next time. I went with the filet combo, with the 6 oz filet and scallops. I got the Maytag bleu cheese butter for my steak($3 well spent) and for the sides I had green beans with pecans and the poblano au gratin potatoes. Everything was delicious. The green beans were my favorite part, surprisingly. They were just so, so good. If you read my reviews, you know I am a bargain hunter. The other awesome thing about J.Gilbert's is they have a fantastic happy hour at their bar, so you can get great food and drinks at lower prices. Also, if you sign up for their email list, they send amazing deals and coupons to you(when we went, we used our $25 off a food purchase of $75 or more...pretty great for an amazing steakhouse dinner). They also send you info on their cool special events, which I plan on attending in the near future. Basically, get in here.

I watched the bartender make drinks and saw him reach for new seasons pink grapefruit juice in the fridge, along with a pitcher of unlabeled orange juice often when making mimosa cocktails that advertise fresh squeezed juice.

We went in a big group of 10 and sat on the 2nd floor, sharing 3 pots. You have a choice of 4 different broths, and I'd highly recommend the chicken and the spicy broths. The ingredients are really fresh, especially the vegetables!! Highly recommend ordering the taro root, fried tofu, frozen tofu, and pumpkin if you're vegetarian. I have to admit though, it was a little too chaotic for larger groups because the servers were slow to come around with our food and they never gave us enough ingredients, so we had to re-order about 10 times!!! Definitely a little annoying to have to keep flagging someone down to ask for a new sheet. If only they'd just give us the portion we indidated on our sheets!! Overall, $20 for an all you can eat hot pot dinner. Fresh fish, scallops, beef, etc...worth every buck!!!!"},{"name":"Santa Rosa","address":"1585 Broadway Street, Unit 121","city":"Port Coquitlam","stars":"4","text":"A customer told me about this place in the middle of nowhere in Industrial Port Coquitlam. The first time I tried it my boss got it for take out and it's wonderful fresh food. I went to find it myself a few times but couldn't find it, and after a month finally found it! The Good: Fresh, good, and amazing food at great prices. Can't go wrong with anything there. I love the chicken nachos myself. The staff is nice!The \\"Meh\\": The location is hard to find, and the hours don't really fit with my lifestyle so it's hard to get there sometimes. I had a few hiccups, one was that there was no chicken in my Nachos (They even wrote Chicken Nachos on the box), and one time it took nearly an hour to cook my order. But still it was worth it. The place itself is small. There tacos are just meat and shell, no cheese or anything else on them it seems.The Bad: Nothing really, just the location is in the middle of nowhere.The Verdict: Amazing. But why only four stars? I've actually only been there four times, and half of those times my order was messed up, or they took forever to get the food out.

If your from Orlando, you know previous restaurants did not work out well in that location. Luckily, I had some friends that drove past everyday and followed the progress and the changes happening with the building, so we decided to give it a try. The atmosphere is by far the best! They have a lot of outside seating which faces into the restaurant. It is very open and the outside seats can actually hear and see the band that is playing inside.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  For food, we ordered fried calamari, which was cooked perfectly and had an amazing sweet thai chili sauce on top. The potstickers had a great crunch. The fig flatbread was by far the best!! The arugula, fig, prosciutto, cheese (possibly goat), and balsamic glaze was such a great compliment to each other. The portion sizes are considerable also! We split those three appetizers between four women and had almost half leftover.  They have various craft beers to choose from along with a full liquor bar. My favorite drink was the Stormy Sailor (Sailor Jerry's with ginger beer). However, the drinks can get a little pricey. The can beers can range from $3-$6, and their domestics (miller lite) are around $3.50. They are going to eventually do bucket specials, but have not started yet.  I would suggest going during happy hour if you are wanting a few cocktails. All the beers are $1 off, and did I mention they gave us a free koozie with our first beer purchase!

I honestly don't think that the atmosphere is that crucial to my enjoyment of sushi, with the exception that any restaurant I dine at must be clean, and Wasabi House is that. Pretty much all of my local sushi choices, here, Yoko, Hayakawa, Sakana-Ya (now closed) all have a similar aesthetic, which I call sushi dive circa 1970 and the fact that they all look like that probably means it's super authentic, but I've never been to Japan so can't say for sure. Charlie and the crew, who are mostly family members, are all incredibly nice and will take great care of you. I don't think I've ever gotten anything off the regular menu, except miso and gyoza, both of which are tasty. I really only come for sushi. They have a variety of americanized rolls that appeal to the Dunwoody (and my) palate, although I usually only get the spicy tuna chirashi. It's pretty easy to miss as it's on the very bottom left corner of the menu and be sure to specify you want it spicy. I had been eating there for over 5 years and never noticed it until Tami H told me about it. One thing to note, the portion is huge and if you try to eat it yourself, you will be way too full, but if you ask they will make you a half portion, which is the perfect lunch with miso and side salad."},{"name":"Tin Shed Garden Cafe","address":"1438 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I live nearby and eat here semi-regularly.

When we asked for extra pita, we were told we get one refill but then we will have to be charged for more. We all wanted more than just one piece of pita so we got the ONE free refill. Our entrees were mediocre. I got the wild mushroom risotto which was again, so incredibly salty. My friend got the shepard's pie which she had two bites of and left because the whole thing was dry and tasteless. The other two got the lobster mac and cheese which was like velveeta cheese. They too barely finished their meals.We tried for one last redemption and got dessert. We ordered the mini chocolate chip donuts. They came with 3 but there was four of us so we got charged an extra $2 for one pathetic little donut. There was supposed to be a coffee glaze and whipped cream with them. I'm not sure where the coffee glaze or whipped cream was but the donuts were very unappetizing and seemed raw in the middle...not sure how they were supposed to taste but it was nothing like what we were expecting from the description.All together we paid $200 for the four of us.

The restaurant at the time was small, but from what we were told they are expanding into a space next door that will be a late night bar. It seemed pretty obvious that the servers were still \\"figuring things out.\\" It was a busy night and we were lucky to get a couple of seats at the bar. We ordered our drinks, and very quickly received the wine my wife ordered. My drink, aptly named the \\"Vodka,\\" which was very good by the way, took another 10-15 minutes to arrive. It was odd having to wait for one of the drinks in our two drink order - it just seems obvious that both would come at the same time. Regardless, the bartender came over to us and apologized for the wait, and was also very friendly, as were the servers, the owner, and everyone else we met there that night.While enjoying our drinks, we were offered dinner many times, but declined because we had already ate earlier. However, they were nice enough to offer us a sampling off their dinner menu free of charge. The dashi poached egg, trout roe, chervil was excellent! A very unique taste of combined ingredients. They have a very interesting menu of food choices, not the usual fare in PDX.We stopped off at Smallwares specifically to have a drink because they were still open at 10PM on a Saturday night on Fremont, but by tasting a small sampling of the food here provided the impetus to make a come back for dinner one of these days. I think giving this restaurant some time to smooth out their service will be best to see if it has improved in that regards. and thus will update the rating as need be.

Don't get me wrong -- Tabor Hill is totally solid and delivers what it promises.  Simple, tasty food without a hint of  extravagance.I've been coming here on and off since I moved to Portland 14 years ago.  Until the other night, it had been awhile.  Years.  I've got to admit, I was a bit surprised to see that its still there... its a very unassuming spot, increasingly out of character with the neighborhood.Nostalgia got the better of me, so I stopped in for a bite.  The place was empty as it usually is.  Sad.  The super nice couple who runs the place were still there.. the wife waiting tables, the husband cooking.  Some things never change.  Except, now they seem to have pictures on the menu and the prices have gone up a bit.Food was still very good -- pretty much what you would expect at a diner.  A diner that cooks with love and isn't afraid to add just a touch of personality to fare that might otherwise be quite bland.  You can easily find better, but you could also get a lot worse.  Especially on Hawthorne.I will keep going to Tabor Hill Cafe, at least once in awhile.  They serve breakfast all the time, which can be a big plus!  The sad fact that there always seems to be plenty of tables open might be helpful to keep in mind when waiting in line for breakfast seems impossible.

The menu is two sided, one English and one espa√±ol, by the way.  Everyone was very polite, and it was certainly a homey, family-friendly atmosphere.  People were stopping by just to say hi and grab a coffee as we were pigging out.  That's why the no alcohol thing doesn't matter.  It's not a bar, and they focus on the food and the atmosphere, which is actually refreshing.  I got the pechuga de pollo a la parrilla (grilled chicken breast), and it was wonderful.  Lemon, garlic and pepper were the seasonings I could make out, but I'm sure they added their own special touch because it tasted WAY better than anything I've ever made. This food was so good, we were all stopping and talking about it after almost every bite.  The pl√°tanos maduros were freaking unbelievable...I can still taste them now as I'm writing this.  I got the arroz amarillo and proceeded to finish off everyone else's when they couldn't finish.  I was full toward the end, but I honestly kept on eating because I didn't want it to end (first-world problem...).  Large portions and completely delicious.ALSO, VERY fair price! For the four of us it only ended up $70-80.  Another benefit of no alcohol served!  There are a ton of places to get your drink on within walking distance, so you can fill up, have a caf√©, and then walk it off a bit before boozing...pretty much perfect.I'm moving down to JP in the fall, and they'll certainly be seeing a lot of me at this place! ¬°Riqu√≠simo!"},{"name":"The Solo Club","address":"2110 NW Raleigh St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"After two of our favorite places stopped serving breakfast we landed at Solo Club...as a couple.

The drinks and food were phenomenal. My friend got the fried chicken (to die for) and I got the trout (also delicious). I appreciate that they have dairy-free and vegetarian options on the menu and 10000000000000 times more appreciative that they have dairy-free dessert! It's next to impossible to find a place that carries dairy-free dessert, and it generally falls under the category of sorbet or fruit (boring). I ate THE MOST delicious coconut cream with passion fruit, blueberries, and pistachios. I would literally just go back to have a cocktail and this dessert!

I'm starting to think that I shouldn't even write reviews until I have been to a restaurant more than once.My first experience at Barlata was top notch.  We had five plates, a bottle of wine and a glass of sangria.  The only problem we had was with sunchoke salad, and that was simply because it was overdressed.  had they put about half as much dressing on it would have been delicious.  The squid ink paella was delicious, excellent flavors, crispy rice at the bottom, seafood was flavor was perfectly brought into the dish.  Our favorite was the roasted quail, which was perfectly cooked.  The waitress recommended the Mel I Mato for desert.  Neither of us cared for it, the sherry gastrique was too sweet and overpowered the dish.   I would have given it four stars or a high three star ranking..Our second trip was not so good.  We ordered the frissee salad, which was almost flavorless except for the bitter and bad flavor of whatever they dressed the tuna with.  It was a completely unpleasant salad, bad greens, no flavor, bad textures, it frankly shoudn't be served in a restaurant.  it looks like mixed up lunch leftovers.  The second dish was actually worse than that.  It was the ahi tuna, which was flavorless, soaked in oil, and served in a sardine can.  I wouldn't be surprised if it actually came in that can except for the obvious lack of salt.  Flat out terrible.  I couldn't finish either dish.  We did a seafood fideo (sans squid ink) it was quite good and once again ordered the quail which was delicious.  The beef heart was a mixed bag.  The cous cous was fantastic, flavorful and cooked perfectly but the beef heart was pounded out and grilled.  I love beef heart but it requires a slow cooking method or it is extremely chewy.  This was chewy.  This time desert was delcious, it was a chocolate mousse and it was perfect.What I have gathered is what I thought when I initially saw this menu.  It's too damn big.  There are over 70 items on it.  If you know what is good and what to order you can have a delicious meal.  Unfortunately, if you are experimenting you could have a really bad experience.  I think they need to severely pare this menu down.  The ahi tuna and frisse salad have no business being served in a restaurant.  I would have sent that back at Denny's.  I will be going back but it's going to be for paella and quail, I'm leery about straying from those dishes and don't want to risk the bad experience by trying new things on the menu.

Pain au chocolat available, check! Iced coffee, check! Macaroons too, double check!Ok, here is the low down:Iced coffee - Good subtle flavors and complimented the sugary goodies well. Pain au chocolat - Flaky texture, chewy, not overly buttery, good amount of bitter sweet chocolate to balance.  Macaroons - The Fleur de sel (salted caramel) came highly recommended by the staff and it was amazing. I don't even like caramel but it surly made me rethink this. The strawberry macaroon was very strawberry-ish, not artificial tasting just very strong. The chocolate hazelnut was probably my least favorite. I tasted the chocolate but the hazelnut flavor was so faint, almost non-existent. The macaroons in general were too sweet for my taste. The filling was a bit too generous and it just kept oozing out everywhere and became too messy. The textures of the shells were pretty good though. It was soft yet crisp and flaky. Considering that there was too much filling in the macaroons, the shells didn't get soggy at all and held up very well."},{"name":"Ascari Bar & Grille","address":"290 Wood Rd","city":"Braintree","stars":"3.5","text":"Went with 9 people and the only good items were the french fries and the drinks.

Also the shrimp is some slimy farm raised blue crap from Thailand (even tho we are in Florida close to beautiful pink Gulf shrimp). 5. Overpriced.

It was packed because of the game(s) but once they were over the bar cleared out and it was a really nice atmosphere. The drinks are on the more expensive side $9-10 but are delicious so worth it in my opinion. LOVE the photo booth hidden next to the women's restroom-- the lighting is on point in there lol. Only $2.99 for a photo booth session which is much cheaper than like Church & White Owl ($5) and some of the other bars with photo booths. It looked like they had some fire pits and stuff outside that would be fun on a summer night. No cover when we went in. Overall thumbs up from me! Also - lots of yummy vegan friendly options!!"},{"name":"Santorini Cafe","address":"11800 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"A lovely restaurant in a lovely old house. The ambiance alone is charming, and the food is very satisfactory. Every time we have gone, the owners have brought out a tray of sweets for us, completely on the house. I forget what the Greek name is, but they're very similar to beignets."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(i=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return i.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||i.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||i.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"search-container"},N={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],D={key:0},j={key:1};function G(i,e,s,f,n,r){const c=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",R,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>n.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,n.searchQuery]])]),t("div",N,[(a(!0),o(m,null,y(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:n.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[n.isLoading?(a(),o("span",j,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",D,"See more"))],8,H)):w("",!0)])}const L=u(E,[["render",G],["__scopeId","data-v-9a0f55ed"]]),V=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/29.md","filePath":"quotesmag/29.md"}'),F={name:"quotesmag/29.md"},J=Object.assign(F,{setup(i){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(L)]))}});export{V as __pageData,J as default};
