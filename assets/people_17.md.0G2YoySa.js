Then I reconsidered. Why? The rest of the experience? I'd rather eat at a hot dog cart in NYC in the middle of a blizzard while watching a golf tournament. That's a worse-possible-scenario for me. \\n\\nThe service was absolutely terrible. While I understand it's a holiday, and as the manager mentioned to us, they were short handed, what did they just hire from bitter & single servers unite? How RUDE! \\n\\nWhile I missed the first half of brunch, the second was more then enough of an experience to make up for it. The waitress pretty much flat out ignored me when I tried to order, skipping around me to get everyone next to, across from, behind, and opposite me. My drink also sat empty for 3/4 of the meal. If you're charging for drinks, you would think you'd WANT to rack your bill up for a better tip. Don't worry, she did. While they offered 1 complimentary mimosa as part of the brunch package, the waitress charged two of us for both drinks we ordered- and had the audacity to argue with us about how many we had ordered. The conversation went:\\n\\n'I thought one drink was free?'\\n'Yes, but you ordered two so I charged you for two.'\\n'But one is free, correct?'\\n'Yes, but I brought you two.'\\n'If ONE is free, and you BROUGHT me two, what is TWO MINUS ONE?!' \\n'Whatever'\\n\\nDid she seriously just 'whatever me over a $4 mimosa? She should've paid me $4 for the inconvenience of having to deal with her. She also, rather rudely I might add, brought out my friend's order partially wrong and asked her to move the stuff she wanted (which was covered in the eggs she didn't want) off the plate and give it back to her. Ummm, how about correcting the order yourself? It's not like you have to cook it. \\n\\nThe manager, while nice, only tried to rectify the situation in a half-ass manner. He offered us free champagne, which was very sweet but we all wanted to high-tail it out of there. He also still charged one of the other girls for her meal which she told him wasn't good when he asked why she hadn't touched it. I get it, you ordered it, so *TECHNICALLY* you have to pay for it. Well, now, you provided the service and you have to pay sir- I'm sure I'm not the only one who will comment on our brunch experience. \\n\\nWhile I'm all for mistakes being made- it's all about the recovery.

The real version is SO easy to make, the one that came out was a needless fraud.  To survive in this sophisticated neighborhood which is bristling with worldly foodies, Kika needs to be authentic and much more daring with its menu. Locally sourced ingredients, authentic interesting dishes (where's the squid ink? Morcilla? Padrones?), and push the envelope a bit (channel Jose Andres at Jaleo and Bazaar, or Batali at Casa Mono.

That was dumb. It took us until 10:30pm to get some seats in the back, though I don't blame the establishment as they have limited seating. The back is a little room with 4 or so tables that could seat maybe 20 people. It's a bit strange, in that the waiters don't go back there to take orders, you just order your food and drinks at the bar and they'll deliver it to you. I do wonder why they don't take reservations, if only for large groups that could use that space. But I'm no business guru, so maybe that just works for them.\\n\\nJust be advised that if you have a large group, plan to show up early to snag the back seats, and don't forget to order your food at the bar.\\n\\nON TO THE FOOD!\\n\\nThis time I got real food- I was craving comfort, so I ordered the grilled cheese with bacon and creamy tomato soup. Now, I figure there's only so much you can do with grilled cheese and tomato soup. It's not exactly complicated. But believe me when I tell you that this was probably the best grilled cheese and tomato soup I've ever had in my life. Two thick, buttery pieces of bread, perfectly grilled, with just enough cheese and two slices of crispy delicious bacon. Yum.

Most places serve the lobster already out of the shell and in the pasta, and if not the lobster is steamed and on the side.  But Strega thought they would try something different.  They served this entr√©e with the lobster still in the shell, on top of the pasta, COVERED IN MARINARA SAUCE.  As you can imagine, this makes it a little impossible to enjoy.  At first, I asked the waiter how I was supposed to eat this.  He looked at the table, said \\"sorry\\", and came back with a lobster cracker.  I tried to crack it, of course getting sauce everywhere, because it was impossible not to.  The next time he came back, he brought me a moist white napkin.  I continued to try to free the lobster from the marinara sauce covered shell, until it went all over my clothes and onto the floor.  The waiter sent the manager over, who did not understand how ridiculous this was.  No one asked if I would like something else.  I had about a bite of food, on my birthday, and their response was to bring over a free dessert.  Wow, thanks.

If you need food fast, this is a good bet.\\n\\nA word of caution to those with shellfish allergies:  the oyster sauce they use on fried rice at a lot of Thai restaurants gives me an allergic reaction (not a strong one, but it warrants taking antihistamine after eating).  I have to specifically ask them once or twice to not use oyster sauce, although sometimes I'm pretty sure they forget because I'll get that telltale throat-itch.  So be warned.

I'm sorry, this is extortion.  I realize Zuur is fairly rare and whatnot but, I can buy Zuur in my local packy for $13.49/25oz.  This means that Zuur is $2/oz at Lower Depths and $.53/oz at any store.  In other words, LD is marking up Zuur 400% above retail price.  And remember, retail price is itself a markup based on wholesale cost.  So, who knows how much LD is making on this beer.

Never heard of this place previously  but I did do myself a favor and check out the Yelp reviews. Based on everyone's boasting and 4/5 stars I started warming up to the sound of Barcelona! I'm not going to lie.. I was very apprehensive about going to a tapas bar on an empty stomach(Hadn't ate all day..my fault not anyone's)!  Since I was already starving, not a big tapas gal (sorry I like HUGE portions) and I didn't have a chance to read the menu before hand I decided to eat a light meal to subdue the hunger that typically leaves you after leaving a tapas bar.\\n\\nSo we made reservations for 9:30pm on a friday night and upon arrival I notice this place is slammed packed and jammin! So much so we waited about 5-15 minutes to get seated.. so much for reservations lol. Ambience was fabulous, music was on point. Loved the self portrait of the owner by the ladies room ..kind of a take 1, take 2, take 3 still shot portrait.. um cute :) So our host walks us to our seats, walked by a buchery with all sorts of meat hanging and being cut right in front of my very own eyes. Different! So we get seated and we get not one but two servers and possibly three. But you'd think with this many servers someone would remember to bring out my dessert menu that I asked for two times, but NOPE. Perhaps maybe because they were too busy performing a soul train line to the tunes of Bel Biv Divoe in between serving. But hey well get to that later.\\n\\nSurveyed the menu for about 15 minutes. There was vegetable tapas side and then meat side. So wait you mean to tell me tapas are $6-13 for small sample of whatever? Oh ok now I really was thanking God I ate before. I did the math, in order to have a satisfying portion of food that's about 4 or 5 tapas I'd have to order. Um.. getting kinda pricey here dontcha think? Since I already ate a light meal I thought I just skip straight to the drinks and desserts. I ordered a mojito. Drink came out about 15 minutes later but not before I was asked to provide a second form of ID b/c my ID was somewhat cracked.. lol really dude? I go to the bank with this ID and nobody ever questions me.. blah! That set a somewhat blah tone for the rest of the night. \\n\\nMy drink came out about 15mins after ordering it, and um. It was OK. I've had better but definitely not bad. So then minutes later the tapas came out. I didn't order any but my cousin and girlfriends did and I did have a chance to try 3 or four of my cousins tapas. Neatly dressed servers walked around with tapas to tray of tapas to try out (might I add for free)! Then a random server (not our original server) came over and put a plate of Brussels sprouts on our tables. Everyone goes  \\"um wait, we didn't order these.. sir um\\" to which he replies \\"there on the house\\" OK more free tapas??.. cool with me! I ate it was solely because it was  free and also b/c I've never had Brussels sprouts. Overall they were pretty good.\\n\\nGot a chance to try the fried cabbage off my cousins plate. First time having fried cabbage and boy were they delicious! Then my cousin let me sample ..well ok eat the majority of her Patatas Bravas (fried potatoes)) which came with aioli sauce.. and these were equally well prepared and tasty as the fried cabbage. Another friend ordered the hanger steak which looked really good.. she complained it was fatty but um what do you expect lol its a steak hun!\\n\\nNow lets get to the disappointing factor: I asked for a dessert menu, not once, but twice. But no dessert menu in sight. *Shrugs, guess they forgot about lil ol me*\\n\\nOverall, a really cute spot.. if you like tapas.. I really don't care for them so I wont be back anytime soon but maybe to check out their wine bar!!!\\n\\nNote: If you want to opt out of ordering any food, they have a cute lil bar area circling the restaurant!

If I'm paying $100 for a meal, I expect a certain caliber of food as well as service. Service here was just average and the ambiance was very casual. I mean, one of the dishes was pumpkin shells. Like, straight grilled pumpkin shells. Pass. The one mild standout was the venison, which we both enjoyed. The other 6 savory dishes were just okay. I mean, I just expect more from a James Beard award winner. \\n\\nHowever, the celery sorbet they served before the dessert was disgusting. There were little bits of celery and cheese mixed along with it and there was literally no way we could eat it, so we sent it back in exchange for some regular raspberry sorbet. The desserts were not bad, the panna cotta was just average although I enjoyed the flourless chocolate cake with miso ice cream. However, it wasn't anything special, just decent. Overall, we were extremely disappointed with our meal and felt it was a huge waste of our money...\\n\\nMy friend and I were quite confused and disappointed at all the rave reviews--\\"is it because it's Cambridge?\\" he puzzled. Perhaps we would have been less disappointed if we had ordered a la carte (so it would have been cheaper) but we had heard good things about the tasting menu. It genuinely confuses me that you can spend the same price on the prix-fixe menu at L'Espalier and get food that is just on a completely different level and impeccable service. Go to L'Espalier instead. You won't regret it."},{"name":"New India Cuisine","address":"2304 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Went for lunch the other day and got the lunch special which featured Saag curry.

On my first real trip to Boston for business, naturally I gravitated to Yelp for restaurant picks. This one stuck out from the get go. The story, pedigree, reviews...all signs pointed to greatness. I didn't make it here until my last night but I am so glad I did. \\n\\nMy friend and I walked in at 9:30 on a Tuesday night without reservation and were promptly seated. The place was moderately busy, about what I expected. Neither of us were hungry enough to do the tasting menu but I'll save that for another day. We decided on the prie fixe menu. Everything looked great but amazingly, the first course options spoke to me a bit more than the entrees. \\n\\nWhen the waiter gave us the two side specials of the night which included brussels sprouts roasted in duck fat and roasted bone marrow with grilled toast, I knew what I'd be having. I went with the grilled spanish octopus, fried maine clams, and the latter two sides. My friend had a pasta dish with mushrooms and sausage. I can't do any of these items justice. \\n\\nThe grilled octopus was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I actually went to Spain earlier this year; this killed anything I had there. The clams were breaded and fried nicely, with what I recall to be a squid ink cream sauce. Not the standout but solid. The bone marrow was an experience to be had. It had an aroma that can't be replicated with an unparalleled mouthfeel. The  brussels sprouts were as good as a one could ever expect. I could eat that as a side daily for the rest of my life. My friend thoroughly enjoyed their pasta dish and from the bit I sampled, it had a very pleasant flavor and texture. \\n\\nLook...I didn't even mention the good cocktail I had or the decent wine. This place isn't about that. If you consider yourself a legitimate foodie and you are ever in Boston for dinner, do yourself a favor and make it to Craigie's.

Gross. Also we were here in the summer with the biggest A hole of a manager who did not even help us when a waitress dropped a glass that shattered and slashes my poor friend Pat's finger. We were given a rag and when it wouild not stop bleeding she needed 5 stitches at Quincy Medical Center. I mean it was horrible I think they gave us a tiramisu and a band aid. So I would say risk your life and limb in the summer and stay away from this hellhole that is packed with a bunch of really obnoxious people who are about being on the scene and think this place is rodeo drive....not. Also they are so busy the food quality really drops in the summer.  Review number 2 the off season is awesome. It is you and 10 of your closest friends including chet curtis at the bar head here.

They have competent baristas, roast their coffee in house, and have vegan/vegetarian options for both the standby menu as well as weekend breakfast tacos.

The outdoor seating is gigantic in terms of a coffee shop, and it is right on the water with shade from a few large trees in the back, making a good place to post up for reading or conversating or whathaveyou. My only complaint lies with the garbage Internet connections, for which there are several to choose yet none provide a stable or strong connection to do anything useful on your device. It seems to be a competition for bandwidth, and that comes off as quite cheap on part of Mozarts. For all the goodness this place provides, the WiFi is sorely lacking.

The first time it was spectacular, tiny bites of incredibly delicious food. A very solid five-star experience and in contention for a spot on my list of all time great restaurants. \\n\\nThe second visit was a serious letdown. The food was still good, but nothing like $175/person good, which is where our bill ended up. Only two of the courses really popped as eating something special. Unfortunately I can't recount the dishes in detail as I couldn't really hear the waitpersons over the music and other noise. Two of our courses were cod, the first , a small square of fish on a  bed of beans was fabulous. The second, larger pieces still on the bones was only OK. The dessert was also seriously good, a chocolate confection with, I think, white chocolate ice cream. Really good. None of the rest of the dishes were memorable, and one, a pasta in a brown sauce with turnips was just bad. I'd had a very similar dish on my prior visit that I could also have done without. The pasta was grainy, with an unpleasant texture, and the sauce was \\"earthy\\" like in it tasted like dirt. I don't mind a miss every now and again, but I'm not sure why they didn't scratch this one after the first night. The pork cooked several different ways was hit and miss. One of the preparations, a small pillow-shaped something that was fried was wonderful. The pork belly was just undercooked pork fat. Why bother? The sausage was OK, but not great, and the rib was overcooked and oddly (over?)spiced. \\n\\nService was great the first night, attentive and timely and well-paced, the second night the meal seemed to take forever (we were there for over four hours, over an hour longer than the first time); the time between some of the courses seemed endless. My guests were clearly impatient with it. \\n\\nI will probably try it again because the first visit was so incredibly good--perhaps the burger is the way to go. At that price level though I really hope for a more consistent performance. I really have to wonder if these two meals were cooked by the same people, as there was no comparison between the two nights experiences.\\n\\nEdited because I decided two stars was too harsh."},{"name":"Chow n' Joy","address":"626C Somerville Ave, Ste C","city":"Somerville","stars":"3","text":"\\"The food isn't very good, but at least there's a lot of it.\\" \\n\\nResoundingly average, even for rainy-day Americanized Chinese delivery food.

I ordered this on the basis of a glowing and very funny recommendation by another Yelper, whose opinions I usually respect (see immediately below), and because I was tired and lazy and it was raining, but ultimately I was disappointed. I should not have eaten here.\\n\\nTo be more specific: The shrimp/lobster sauce entree smelled conspicuously burned - this was not _wok hey_, this was overcooking; maybe the scorch is left over from the fire that burned down Kee Kar Lau. If you're a scallion pancake fan, the ones at Zoe's are much better, though no one in this town seems to be aware of the peanut/garlic sauce that makes green onion pancakes sing. Other Yelper's testimony that the food is delivered quickly or in a state of piping-hotness were not confirmed by my single experience.\\n\\nCertainly there's a lot of food for your delivery dollar, especially if you take advantage of the multi-app entree+starter combos: $15 would have gotten me three large meals' worth of pseudo-Chinese chow (no joy) if I hadn't just thrown it away.\\n\\nBottom line: This is the kind of stuff that can be choked down without retching (just to let you know what 2 stars means coming from me), but it doesn't make you feel happy or sated or really anything other than guilty."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Poor value for the money\\nThe food was good, but VERY expensive for what it is.

We went early on a Thursday to avoid a massive line around 5:30p. We must have been really lucky because when we got there, only one couple was in line ahead of us. Now granted it had been raining all day and was still semi sprinkling at the time. While we were waiting, we noticed that the lady who seemed to be the owner was not the friendliest... but hey i guess you don't need to be when your food is that good and people still line up for it. It did make me a little nervous about the kind of service we would get once we were seated. Luckily our waitress was incredibly friendly.\\n\\nTo start off we got a small order of calamari. I was very pleasantly surprised by the size of their small. I'm not going to lie... my stomach would have been content after our appetizer.

My boyfriend got the fusilli with lobster and shrimp, and I got the seafood pasta that came with half a lobster, mussels, and clams. We both got it with the Giacomo sauce, which is basically their regular red sauce that they use to cook the lobsters in and then they add a touch of bechamel. OMG it is freaking amazing!!! Next time I want to try the Fracomo sauce which is the same thing but they add crushed red peppers to give it a little kick. These dishes were unreal. There was no shortage of seafood on our pastas, and the flavors were nothing less than spectacular.

These mistakes - our mistakes, to be clear - is why I am rating Salt Lick no more than three stars. \\n\\nDo NOT go to Salt Lick if you do not have much of an appetite. They are famous for their unlimited barbecue, and going here and skipping on that is kind of setting yourself up to think at the end of the day that you just had \\"a missed opportunity.\\" We went here as our third BBQ restaurant of the day, and we clearly were in no shape to take them up on their unlimited barbecue. We were fine initially to share an order of The Rancher (a sample plate of their brisket, pork ribs, sausage, and turkey) and an order of pulled pork between the four of us. But we felt that eating our weight in meat is a big part of the Salt Lick Experience, especially after watching a few people around us asking for more meat. So if you are going, make sure you are hungry.\\n\\nOur second mistake is that we went to other establishments with much better barbecue first. And in doing so, we all agreed that we were not able to fully appreciate Salt Lick barbecue. Normally, I would have raved about their low-and-slow ribs and would have happily ranted about the woeful lack of good authentic barbecue (not grilled meat) near my home. But after three or four consecutive days of amazing Texas barbecue, Salt Lick's meats were tasty but a tad dry and just not as mind-blowingly good as the ones that can be had at Black's or Franklin's (this is hearsay info from my companions, as I had nothing but the pecan pie at that establishment), or Micklethwait's. Again, let me emphasize that I probably would have been very happy with the food as it was tasty but was a tad dry had I tried them first. So if you are going, go to Salt Lick first.\\n\\nThe barbecue may have fell short of our expectations, but the peach cobbler was so delicious. All the staff we have had interaction with were unfailingly cheerful and friendly. The other diners were also a fun crowd. The fire pit was also quite cool! Furthermore, the drive from Austin was quite beautiful and catching the sunset here was a good way to end the day.\\n\\nI think that Salt Lick is definitely a place to visit. The convivial ambience from the crowd all happily anticipating a feast, the smell of the meats emanating from the open pit, the hospitality and friendliness of the staff, and a spectacular Texas sunset...

My wife and I became vegetarians about a year ago and we eat almost entirely plant-based.

We love cooking and do so most nights, but once in a while we want tasty and healthy take out. This place crushes it. The food is incredible - the taste, the textures, the freshness, the price and the volume all on point. Staff is always super friendly and helpful. Bowls are my favorite, but the falafel dog is also ridiculously good. And through door dash they deliver to my office downtown and my apartment in JP. We probably order from here on average 3 times a month and would do so way more if we didn't love to cook as much as we do.

We should have kept driving.\\n\\nWe went to this restaurant around 9:30 on a Saturday night and it wasn't even half full.  We were quickly seated and everything looked clean but waitstaff seemed robotic.   We ordered some sushi and Korean dishes to all share.\\n\\nEverything arrived promptly which was expected since it wasn't that busy.  The sushi was good but nothing to rave about.   It's the Korean dishes and one Japanese one that we need to talk about.\\n\\nWe ordered some jab chae and tang soo yook and then some chicken katsu.  First the katsu, which is breaded chicken, was really thin and super dry.  There were pieces so dry it was inedible.   On to the jab chae, which is a noodle dish made with meat/veggies and sesame oil.  This dish was ok but seriously not enough flavor.  I don't know if they didn't mix the items up well or what but it was certainly lacking flavor.   And finally....the tang soo yook, which is sweet n sour, we got the pork.  The dish arrived in a pool of sauce and I mean a pool.  There was more sauce then there was meat.  The flavor of the sweet n sour was ok but the breaded pork was not.  The proportion of meat to coating was probably 25% pork and 75% breading which made it taste gooey.  We barely touched this dish.\\n\\nI've eaten Korean food a lot, homemade and at other restaurants and this has to be one of the worst places.  The reason for the 2 stars instead of 1 is only because the sushi was ok and so was the bon chon.

I'd never heard of it, but by the size of the parking lot, the huge packed dining areas, and hour-plus wait for a table at 4pm on a Saturday...everyone else in Texas clearly had.  We'd planned to stay and eat, but with an unexpected 1-hr wait just to get seated, we opted for take-out.\\n\\nWe ordered brisket, turkey, sausage, and a beef rib, as well as servings of both peach and berry cobblers...and of course pickles and onions.  Everything was packaged well, and made it back to our dining table in great shape.  As for taste, the brisket was solid...not standout, but moist, smokey, and solid.  The turkey and sausage were both great.  The rib was a real disappointment though.  The flavor was good, but it was dry and chewy...think slightly under-cooked beef jerky.  ...no, I'm not exaggerating.  The cobbler was also disappointing.  The berry seemed like a scoop of compote with a piece of precooked pie crust dropped on top.  Nothing bringing the two together, and nothing making the fruit stand out.  The peach cobbler was just terrible.  We must have gotten an under-cooked batch.  The peaches were fine; nothing special about the flavor, but nothing bad either.  The crust/dough however was just not right.  In contrast to the well cooked, firm piece of pie crust on the berry cobbler, the peach was topped with a wet, gooey whitish substance resembling way under-cooked dough.  But the time we finished eating our bbq and started on desert, the runny crust and peaches had partially blended together, making the whole thing a big gooey mess (not in a good way).\\n\\nWhile I waited for our ordered to be put together, I walked around the property a bit.  The outdoor waiting area was nice; a performer was strumming away on acoustic country music for the crowd waiting for their tables.  Inside, the restaurant was sprawling and crowded.  Waitstaff buzzed quickly around carrying huge trays of food.  And, right out in front for everyone to watch was the pit...filled with piles of brisket, sausage, turkey, and ribs,  Guys rotating, tossing, chopping, and plating.  The smell was scrumptious and the view captivating.  A great way to pass the time.\\n\\nIn the end, I recommend this place.  Be prepared for a wait if you're dining in.

My honey got a combo plate for 18.99 his was a 6oz sirlion and bbq ribs with steak fries and a salad, the steak was really good and done right for me as I ordered Midrare, he ordered medium well and his was more on the medium side.

I figured I would be fine since the owner was present and helping make my order.

I worked at Kentucky Fried Chicken in High School and will never forget the smell of old fryer oil.

The Jalapy was made using the same burnt fried chicken with fresh jalapenos rings some of which were 3/8 inch thick.  Overkill for an average person on a sandwich.  An appropriate slice would be about an 1/8th inch.\\n\\nOur Pulled BBQ Chicken sandwich was delicious and perfectly prepared.

We had a few shots of Powers Irish Whiskey and lemonade, watched UT beat OU for the undisputed National Championship in the final round the 16-team college football playoff, and then drove back to my place on I-35 in limited traffic with everyone politely merging to the right.  Once home we stayed up all night drinking whiskey and playing the best of U2 and Milli Vanilli on Rock Band then went to Juan in a Million where I ate 8 Don Juans and got my picture on the wall.

Here's a tip, call it in!  \\n\\nSometimes the tacos are wonderful, sometimes less so, sometimes, I wonder why I keep going there.  Yes, it's true, some days, I end up just eating the tortillas from my tacos, if they have severely ruined the eggs, or given me horrible bacon or something.  The tortillas make it worthwhile as they are made in-house.  If someone knows about better flour tortillas in town, please tell me.   \\n\\nEven though sometimes the tacos are not so great, it's less than $5 for two tacos which, sadly, is pretty cheap in Austin now.  If they were the $9/pair of Torchy's Tacos, I would probably complain.  If I could stand to go to any of those taco places were I have seen roaches and the tacos are cheaper, I might complain.  I pay $5 for a pair of tacos that are usually pretty darn good from a place I've never seen roaches at and that is money well spent.  \\n\\nMinus a star: no horchatta.  Please put some rice in a jug with a bunch of sugar.  Thank you.\\n\\nTips for dinner: I like their enchiladas.  A lot.  But i don't need three enchiladas ever, so I get the lunch plate at dinner.  Extra $2 to the lunch plate, making it $7.99, which is still cheaper than the dinner entree and a third the calories.  Everyone is happy.

Everything about it is unique and not what you'd expect way down south.\\n\\nThis is meant to be a true Neapolitan brick-oven style pizzeria. Even if you grew up on NY style pizza in the Northeast, this is going to be different. But it doesn't disappoint. The food is great, though the menu is basic and and the pies are all pretty standardized. I've had a few, but the Lasagna and Bianca stand out in my mind. Both were very good, though a lot different (one red/one white). The pizza condiments (red pepper/cheese/etc) are also of very good quality and readily available near the kitchen. It's a BYOB establishment, which is awesome, though the do sell alcohol.\\n\\nIt is a communal atmosphere- you grab whatever seats are open, and often sit with total strangers. Some people hate this, but it's part of the experience. The place has a lot of character, and most of the seating area allows you to see the kitchen that is making the pies. You will almost definitely wait anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes in line, depending on the night you go. Just think about what you want to eat, crack open a beer, and let it happen. \\n\\nAdditionally, the area around here has been built up considerably into a \\"Tiny Italy,\\" wi a few more Italian restaurants, an Italian-coastal themed bar, and a gelato/dessert shop. I haven't eaten anywhere aside from the gelato stand, and can't speak to how authentic the food is, but it is a nice atmosphere and makes for a good experience.\\n\\nOverall, an unbeatable experience in Atlanta. Antico is the type of place that will make you feel lucky you live in a city that offers vibrant, quality, and unique experiences like this.

I'm of the former variety, so my favorite ended up being the white roll, which I found to be just a bit sweet.\\n\\nOf our two appetizers, the Beet Borscht (many different types of beets, sour cream, dill) had the more artistic presentation, with the stream of red pouring out of the pitcher around the dollops of white sour cream and the three stacks of colorful beets and onions.  It was also more sour that I would have liked.  The Dutch Hollander Maine Mussels (green Thai curry, scallion, grilled focaccia) packed some heat, but flavorful sauce, tender mussels (10), and crisp grilled bread made for a good combination.\\n\\nFor our entrees, we selected the two meat options of the three offerings.  The Summer Flounder (honey corn, purple basil, duck crackling, peperonata) and the Rotisserie Pork Loin (Lithuanian potato croquettes, charred hearts of romaine, coriander emulsion) were both tasty options, though light on vegetables.\\n\\nDessert was portioned well.

I read lots of reviews here that made me wonder, but we chose to visit on a Saturday for lunch.  Given all of the 2- and 3-star reviews, I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised.  \\n\\nWe were greated immediately by a friendly hostess, and were in the process of being seated when the bartender noticed our facination with the abundance of tequila selections behind the bar (324 as we would soon discover!).  After talking for a minute or so about our favorites (our \\"indoor lakeview\\" table was being cleaned off) we decided to sit at the bar and continue our conversation.  The bar wasn't full but only a few seats were open after we sat, and if the attentiveness of the bartender was any indication of the service in the rest of the place, I'd give it high marks.  \\n\\nOur food came out quickly and was all very good, from the freshly made guac -- some have called it bland, but I thought the flavor was on point -- to the salsa which was chunky and delicious, more like a salsa fresca which is my preference over the more \\"saucy\\" variations.  We ordered one each of the beef, steak, chorizo and blackened mahi tacos and they were all fantastic.  The beef was particularly good, and the steak had a great marinade and just the right amount of char.  We chose the \\"featured\\" tequila for a pitcher of margarita, and it was to die for.  Ended it with a generous portion of flan topped with fresh strawberries, and I honestly had zero to complain about.\\n\\nI'm in love with the atmosphere and decor, but unlike others that's not what nudged my rating. A combination of really great food, a funky \\"Day of the Dead\\" style, and a fantastic bartender who was keen on sharing his knowledge of tequila, makes Rocco's a new favorite, and earns it 5 stars in my book.

With that said I know the food better than everyone but the head chef.\\n\\nSoups - The Red Lentil soup is usually very delicious. I also enjoy the three bean chili a lot. The ginger miso doesn't cut it. Often it's a few days old so the tamari and salt reduces and reduces leaving the soup kinda brown and way too salty.\\n\\nAppetizers - Gobi Manchurian will have you coming back here again and again, Cauliflower fried in chic pea batter and tossed in what is essentially general tso sauce. Obviously it's not healthy but it's delicious.\\n\\nOther winners are the sesame encrusted seitan strips and grande nachos, especially with vegan cheese. Avoid the beet latkes, soy chicken strips and eggplant caponata, although the accompanying crostini is delicious.\\n\\nSalads - The salads never did much for me but certainly aren't bad. Roasted beet and walnut or the baby spinach are your best bets. Avoid the Caesar salad and the sea vegetable salad.\\n\\nEntrees - Pistachio and herb encrusted tofu is a winner, sometimes it's a bit oily but still delicious. Butternut Squash polenta is consistently very good. The near east seitan and teff crepe is the best thing on the menu when it's made well but many times it isn't :(\\n\\nPeople love the sweet potato quesadilla and although not my favorite it's a good portion and has a lot of veggies in it. The Mexican pizza is amazing, acocado on pizza? Yes! and it's fantastic. The vegan cheese is great on the Mexican pizza as well.\\n\\nI'd avoid the macrobiotic platter, basically just a grilled veg platter with an overly saltly plum sauce. Also avoid the Nirvana delight, very bland. and the Risotto doesn't do much for me.\\n\\nLunch - The sweet potato fries are the best I've ever had. They bake them first and then fry them so it's like a baked potato inside and crispy on the outside. The spicy BBQ sauce to dip them in is also addictive.\\n\\nThe veggie burger is quite good and great portion. I really enjoy it with a side of guacamole. The tempeh reuben is also a winner, ask for the russian dressing/vegan thousand island on the side.\\n\\nThe spiced lentil nut patties are probably the weakest of the sandwiches/wraps. \\n\\nBrunch - Props for offering a vegan brunch but most of the food doesn't do it for me... except for the vegan waffles, YUMMY! vegan whipped cream and fruit on top. So good. The pancakes used to be good before they switched them to gluten free, you can still find the whole wheat pancakes on the brunch specials from time to time. vegan french toast here has never really been my thing either.\\n\\nScrambed tofu is good, home fries are nothing special. \\n\\nDrinks - Bunny spice smoothie rocks despite the terrible name, cashew milk, carrot juice, bananas and cinnamon. Tropical blend smoothie is also really good. The carrot apple ginger juice is also delicious.\\n\\nThe green monster is good but most of the servers don't know how to make it so it's kinda hit or miss.\\n\\nI'd avoid the glasses of juice except for fresh squeezed OJ during brunch.\\n\\nDessert - Vegan carrot cake is simply the best carrot cake I've ever had. I also really enjoy the chocolate mousse pie and all of the white cakes that are usually filled with layers of fruit, pineapple or peach is especially good. The chocolate cake is too rich for me but that's just a preference.

Then when we were finally helped there was confusion as to who was our waiter as two waiters seemed to be sharing our table.  Eventually, when addressed, the waiter recommended ordering everything at once which we agreed to do since we knew how slow things were working.  Well, it took them a long time to get our wine, as evidenced by the fact our appetizers came out before our wine did.  Then when they brought the wine they didn't show use the bottle for long before opening it.  The wine was fine but it was a different vintage than what we ordered.  The service continued poorly throughout the meal with examples being when we asked for more bread, it was promptly delivered to a different table (took 25 minutes for us to get said bread), our appetizer dishes were never cleared so when our food came out the waiter had to juggle clearing the table and serving food and nearly knocked over our bottle of wine and a water class.  To make it worse, my wife's steak looked like it was plated on a dirty plate or at least a plate that had been run through a broiler with grease on it and now was coated in sticky burnt grease.  Finally, the waiter brought us our check when she came to take our desert order.     \\n\\nIf you look at my average reviews I believe they are pretty balanced and average just under 4 stars but the service at this Ruth Chris managed to be about the worst I have ever had at a comparable priced restaurant.

The hangar steak was prepared just right, not too well done and the black truffle sauce drizzled on top was to die for, the chicken empanadas were a touch doughy but the fresh guacamole that went with them helped make up for that faux pas, and eggplant was such an unusual dish (it was sauteed and mixed with peppers and other goodies then served cold) but it was so tasty - I'd love to be able to recreate it at home, and chorizo and figs?  Perfection!\\n\\nI never imagined such a combination of sweet and spicy combination could work so well together but it does.  It came out in a little ramekin hot out of the oven with slices of chorizo scattered randomly among the figs and all were glazed with a great reduction.  It was just fantastic - you must try that one tapas even if you order   entrees for dinner.  You won't be disappointed.  \\n\\nAlthough we never made it past the tapas, I've heard very good things about Barcelona's paella, so I'll definitely be coming back (preferably during the summer to take advantage of the patio again) soon."},{"name":"Row 34","address":"383 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Tried a variety of clams and oysters from the raw bar.

The game is essentially broken up into four quarters with four different categories each with the occasional bonus rounds.  Teams can assign points to each answer, depending on how confident their answers are.  Everything else is self explanatory and the questions were all pretty challenging.  Most teams there were around 4-6 people each.  Our group decided to stick together to make 13 people, but the moderator was super chill and allowed this.  Trivia took around 2 hours.  Will definitely be back!\\n\\nFor a bar, the menu selection was pretty diverse.  I ordered the Tilapia Plate and was really pleased.  For $10, you get a large tilapia filet resting on top of a bed of spinach and mushrooms.  On the side, you also get Mexican rice and beans.  Quantity was great and everything tasted pretty good.

I was visiting Orlando and my Soror introduced me to this delightful place! KeKe's has a vast array of food choices, ranging from breakfast, brunch and lunch. A perfect spot for a light or heavy early meal.  I decided to get the stuff French toast Pina Colada. It was nicely dusted with powder sugar, sweetened coconut flakes, and pineapple sauce as its filling. It was amazingly delicious. Not too sweet, and nothing was over powering. An obvious presence of pineapple and coconut but by no means was it overbearing. This can be surprising when deciding any dish that has pineapple and coconut surrounding it. It can be too inadvertently artificially flavored but my dish was just right in my Opinion. Im no connoisseur but I do enjoy the flavored Pina Colada dish here and there. Now At KeKes I made my dish a combo, and had home fries and sausage links. My friend, she ordered the Carmel and Banana waffle dish, and she fell in love. Plenty food to feed two people. We were full, and I shared my meal with some of the other patrons of the booth. The service was more than perfect, food served promptly and hot, very attentive, friendly and professional in a way that you can associated your server as \\"your best friend kind of way\\": which is what I like. Would I recommend this place: HECKS yes, and it will always be on my list of place to go for breakfast. I certainly wish it was here in S Florida.

I have yet to try the desserts which look amazing, including many flavors of Amy's Ice Creams\\n\\nOne of the main reasons I came here was for the Christmas lights show!  There is a showing at the top of every hour and this show is spectacular.  The lights are meticulously coordinated to match the six songs that are played throughout the show, including Christmas songs and Gangnam Style, and finishing off with the UT fight song.  The show lasted about 15 minutes and was the perfect sight to add to the surrounding Christmas spirit.  I felt like I was a kid at a Disney show again.  I don't think you can find anything like this in Austin. \\n\\nFor anyone who just wants some thinking time or a place to study along with some great coffee, Mozart's is the place to go!  And if it's during the Christmas season, I certainly recommend going to see the Christmas lights show."},{"name":"Burger Tex","address":"5420 Airport Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"What's really funny about this place is they have a framed letter written from this dude in California -claiming its the best burger he's eaten in America.  \\n\\nI really hate \\"build your own\\" kinda places first of all.

Oh, and I got a beer. The beer took 30 minutes to arrive which was a bit strange since all they needed to do was to pop the top and serve, I had to do the pouring so I wasn't really sure what the hold up was. The service here was SLOWWWWWWW. I mean I could've walked to Harvard Sq. and back, and our apps would've just been coming out. I asked one of the waitor if they could check on our food, he comes back 5 minutes later saying that the kitchen is really backed up but they could bring us part of our apps, he was extremely apologetic for the hold up, super nice guy. We then finished up our app and sat politely and patiently for our pizza.\\n\\nIt takes around 45 minutes - hour from when we got our apps to get our pizza and it is still missing the fried egg that we ordered to put on top. I asked a waitress if the egg is cooked into the pizza or if it's supposed to be thrown on top and she responds with (this really bothered me), \\"Oh, the egg we cook seperately, so we just put it on top of the pizza. It really doesn't add much to the flavor or to the pizza so don't worry about waiting. We'll bring the egg out when it's done\\". Just then both my friend and I stopped and thought wait... if we are paying extra for something that doesn't add anything to the pizza, then why are we ordering it. \\n\\nI'll be honest the food here was very good. Lots of great flavors, but the service really killed it. If we weren't sitting outside and it wasn't such a nice day out I would've been first in line to speak with the manager.

My four star review somewhat reflects my hopes for this place rather than what is currently in place.\\n\\nNW Liquid Gold is a bottle shop.  It is NOT a taproom, even though they do have a dozen or so active taps.  The taps are solely for giving people tiny little samples and for filling growlers.  You cannot get pints.  The space is tiny so serving pints really wouldn't be an option even if they wanted to go that route.  Just be aware of this business model when you go.  \\n\\nThe selection of beers you can buy in growlers is impressive.  I've only been there once so I don't know how frequently they switch out kegs.  But the variety is excellent.\\n\\nOn the bottle side of things, the selection is relatively meager.  Belmont Station is the king in this area.  By The Bottle in downtown Vancouver has about half the selection of Belmont Station.  NW Liquid Gold appears to have between 1/2 and 3/4 of the selection of By The Bottle.  The problem is space.  This guy just needs more of it to fit another cooler or two.  \\n\\nThe owner is very sociable and indicated that he hopes to eventually open an outdoor beer garden as well as expand into adjacent space for indoor taproom space and more bottle space.

It actually tasted pretty good with my fries because they weren't salty at all and balanced out the saltiness in the Shepard's pie. \\n\\nThe restaurant definitely had great entertainment.

They have the kind of staff that clearly enjoys reading and helping people with literary inclinations.\\n\\nTrident has a huge and diverse menu. It's their dining that falls a tad short sometimes, not their book prices or selection. Trident has a menu that has everything from detox veggie smoothies to greasy indulgences. It's a great place to eat if you have a mixed crowd of people with varying dining needs and priorities; ie if one person's a strict health nut or calorie counter, they have plenty of options, while someone looking to indulge in eggs benedict etc, can splurge on whatever.\\n\\nTrident has great cappuccino and other espresso based drinks. Their chocolatey banana smoothie is delicious, too. But their dill havarti and avocado sandwich was a major let-down(I expected fresh slices of avocado off the pit and got a pre-packaged looking bland guacamole spread). I got a prosciutto sandwich on a baguette that was way too salty(and I love my sodium) I'd say their menu is hit or miss; it's an extensive menu and I've only tried a fraction of the items. \\n\\nTrident's got me on their e-mail list, but I don't mind because I always get notifications about cool cooking demos and other free events with local chefs and others.

After my first time here, I knew I was going to come back, each time I'm in town.\\n\\nAfter reading about the long wait, we had made it a point to go there right when it opened, and each time, we were able to get a table no problem.  However, wait about a half hour after the restaurant opens, there's a line outside.  So, yes, this place is small, but I do like the intimate setting.

It was freezing outside, and they let us in before they were scheduled to open - AWESOME!\\n\\nThe hostess and servers are REALLY REALLY nice.  The servers were patient and answered any questions we had.  The fried calamari is delicious; I just love the sauce for dipping, perfect touch of sweetness ($7 small, $10 large).  The lobster ravioli is very good ($16); a delicious creaminess that just makes you close your eyes and say thanks to its creator.  My absolute favorite dish to order is the linguini with a mix of giacomo's and fra diavolo's sauce and with shrimps and scallops ($16).  If you're not into spicy, then I recommend not getting the fra diavolo sauce, but if you're a spicy lover like me, GET IT!!  Sheesh, my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Not to mention, very affordable.\\n\\nI went to the bathroom once here, and just have to warn you all.  The bathrooms are downstairs, and the staircase is pretty narrow.

For the price I thought It was going to be big and tasty and it was the complete opposite; small and lackluster.

Food particles at the bottom of the glass and the glass was completely covered in smudge marks. I let the server know, he apologized and promptly replaced it. Their complimentary warm bread came out quick and boy is it good with or without olive oil.

I only had an hour or so in the morning, so I didn't dick around in choosing a place that 1) appealed to me 2) my friends have never been to and 3) served up a fantastic cup of coffee. River Maiden definitely met and surpassed my expectations! \\n\\nI got there around 10:15ish on a saturday morning, initially a little worried about scoring a seat inside since it was mid-morning on a super hot weekend. But they've got this open, spacious sitting room with plenty of tables and chairs so thankfully that wasn't a problem. The line at the register was bustling, which I took as a good sign, and eventhough it was backed up pretty much to the door, the line moved quickly. \\n\\nMy friend ordered an iced coffee and a snickerdoodle cookie (great flavor combo, don't ya think?) and I ended up with a coffee con panna (which I asked for in a paper cup- which was kinda a weird request, but i really really love their 'vantucky strikes back' stamp and well, wanted that on my coffee cup. little things that that make me happy, you know? :) and a sea-salt chocolate chip cookie... which equaled very little (but way strong!) coffee, a lot of sugar and a sprinkle of salt. Totally what I needed to get me through the morning! \\n\\nSo yeah, 5 stars for this place... well thought out layout, friendly service, plenty of space to relax, super clean, and reasonably priced- with tasty coffee and treats!

So you have to pay for parking, unless it's after 6 pm. This location has a nice little outdoor seating area and an indoor seating area that's about the same size. We found the temperature WAY too cold inside so we sat outside. On one part of the outdoor seating, there's that weird fake string turf on the group. Not sure why but not a big deal. \\n\\nYou order at the front and then receive a number to keep on your table. Drinks are self pour-- even the wine and beer, which seemed odd. We came around 7:30 pm and didn't have to wait long to order or find a table. What did take a long time was receiving our order... We found out later that it was because they had slightly over cooked the chicken skewers and had to start over. It was nice that they would redo it instead of serving us slightly burnt chicken. \\n\\nWe ordered the tomato bisque and creamy chicken vegetable soups. Both were good, but they were not hot at all. It was almost like they had it sitting out for a while before they brought it over (likely since they said they had to start over with the chicken). I was disappointed because I had originally wanted the wild mushroom soup, but they had run out. We also got the almond chicken skewers and crispy calamari. Both were excellent-- particularly the skewers. The chicken was moist, seasoned well, and had a great crisp on the outside. The calamari came with lemon frites which was a refreshing bite, and the skewers came with an Asian slaw. The slaw was fresh and tasty.

It turns out that the original owners of Raglan Road went out of their way to painstakingly bring over lots of Irish decor, memorabilia, and other trinkets to really make the place feel like it should, from the wood paneled booths to the bar, it's all very nice to look at.\\n\\nThe food is definitely something else. I had the pleasure of experiencing a few of the items off the menu, including the Shepard's Pie, Beef Stew, and Fish and Chips. With the exception of the fish and chips, the other entrees were absolutely bursting with flavor, leaving very little room for disappointment. The fish and chips were fairly standard, but they were still well done and not too oily.\\n\\nIt must be said though, that the Nom Nom Wings appetizer is damn good craic, as the Irish would say. The wings are sweet without being obnoxious, and are cooked to perfection.

I was staying in the hotel and had time to kill before an interview, so I had lunch.  It was a disaster.  While they tried so hard to do the extra things (the plants on the table, the little receipt box, 4 different liquid sweeteners, etc.) they really failed to cover the basics.  First time, I was seated at a table that was quite dirty (crumbs on seat, napkin under table, etc.), and then was greated by a very friendly server.  I ordered a simple salad with grilled chicken, which he, without any prompt, assured me would come out in about 5 minutes.  About 20 minutes later, I was still waiting for that salad.  When it did come out, it was mediocre at best.  I remember that there were more problems with the meal that I no longer recall, but it was bad enough that I told the concierge that the restaurant was bringing the quality of a wonderful hotel down.  \\n\\nAnd then, today, I returned.  My group was seated in a practically empty room, which didn't bother us.  The bread came out quickly, the sourdough bread was still steaming, it was delicious.  Ordering, I had very low expectations,so I was very pleasantly surprised when the soup of the day (bean and sausage) had a delightly flavor and the perfect amount of unexpected spice.  My roasted chicken was moist and tasty.  Only complaint is that it was $20 for a chicken thigh and 3 piece of asparagus (way too pricey), but combined with the soup ($6) it was a wholesome meal.  I suppose $26 for lunch is a bit pricey, but I was still pleased with the food and service.  SOOOO much better than the last time I was here.  \\n\\nAlso, now that they got the basics right, I was able to really enjoy all the extras.

Antipasti plates are great at $2.00 each and I would order a bunch of the little antipasti plates if you want to go with a small portion of pasta.  Wait staff is terrific and very attentive.

Enter House Special Modern Vietnamese, a restaurant specializing in a more upscale experience while remaining true its Southeast Asian roots.\\n\\nThe name \\"House Special\\" is a sly reference to ph dc bit or house special ph, a staple dish, usually appearing on any Vietnamese menu. This, along with their recipes, composition, and decor, gives you the clear impression they have paid attention to most every detail and taken the time in everything aspect when entering the ornate, stylish restaurant located in the Hamilton Street alley.\\n\\nOn this night, we sampled their four-course Specials + Spirits tasting menu (each dish being paired with a \\"special\\", equally sweet and strong cocktail). To start, the Apocalypse Cow beef carpaccio (with broccoli and Vietnamese herb pur√©e with crispy rice and roasted broccoli) was quite appealing and well-seasoned. Also, their crisp spring rolls have quickly gained a popular reputation for the staple dish.\\n\\nMy highlight of the tasting menu was the Temple's fried quail (chicken fried buttermilk quail and sriracha gel√©e with a cilantro and jalape√±o buttermilk biscuit). It was delightfully delicious as the breaded meat was well-cooked and moist with a crisp coating.\\n\\nThe XO cobia and stuffed squid (boudin boir stuffed squid with seared cobia served with lemon pilaf and mushroom XO sauce) was easily the most complex and ambitious dish of the night full of competing yet distinct flavours in an altogether appetizing package. For dessert, the S+S menu was capped off nicely with a comforting (and not too sweet) fresh soursop sorbet.\\n\\nWhile obviously not exactly traditional native Vietnamese cuisine or fare, the Do family makes sure House Special's menu is authentic to their culture, recipes, and flavours while using interesting ingredients.

The atmosphere was perfect very open yet intimate. loved everything about the decor and the ambience of the restaurant. The steak choices caught my eye, I remember there being three different options. I wanted to verify with our waiter that it was all grass fed and not soy/corn. He said he wasn't sure, he believes one of the options is mostly grass but also topped off with soy before its slaughtered. Well i didn't want that option whichever it is, so he said he'll go check while he gave us a couple more minutes with the menu. Well he came back around again to take drink orders etc, and never gave me my answer, so I ended up ordering scallops instead. My friend ended up having a steak and the waiter recommended a sauce with it. I tried a bit of it when that came and must say that the sauce was superb. it didn't mask the flavor.. it was perfect and so delicious. But it kind of annoyed me that they have their sauces separate so its an additional cost, and they give you a whole boat of it which is so unnecessary. I would much rather the sauce be a part of the dish and just give us a drizzle which was all that was needed. The scallops were also great. Nothing extraordinary though. \\nSo overall, the food was fantastic but the waiter was inattentive and did not stick to his word. \\n\\nThe bar area was very nice, the drinks were strong, but not too strong and I also had the calamari as an app which was delicious. There wasn't any hooks for your bags though and it gets crowded pretty quickly so I would get there a bit earlier in the night. \\n\\nOverall I love this place and will definitely be back again, but I took a star away for the dinner service.

My dish was SO disappointing. Noodle to fish ratio was too big - not enough fish!! AND my fish was dry.. (I know sword fish is a dry fish.. but nonetheless.. it was dry). And everything was SO bland. I used my salt shaker with EVERY bite. That's pretty sad! Might have been due to the LACK of sauce on the dish. I was presented with a big pile of noodles for dinner :( \\n\\nMy friend ordered the \\"Salmon and Sundried Tomatoes in a Tomato Cream Sauce\\" ($15) - pretty much the same problem. Way too much noodles, not enough sauce, and too bland. We put the salt shaker between us and shared in between bites. \\n\\nMy Bostonian friend did a little better when he ordered the Frutti Di Mare ($19). This had a nice variety of seafood including shrimp, scallops, calamari, and mussels. However, he also got the red tomato sauce and suffered the blandness :( \\n\\nOne big mistake we all made that night was that we ordered the regular red tomato sauce instead of the spicy red (diavolo) sauce. We all suffered the BLANDNESS! Plus I really dislike the cramped environment and the way the waiters really try to turn the tables by pushing service. We were rushed to order then some of our plates were taken away before we really finished. But both my friends told me that Giacamo's is usually VERY good and today must have just been a off night.

That didn't feel like a lunch or a break, did it? That feeling of dissatisfaction is not a coincidence; it's likely the cause of the very uninteresting and unpalatable food you just shoveled into your face. Shame on you!\\n\\nTry taking a stroll off the beaten path, up toward Park St. into one of those shady store-fronts that you would likely not even notice on a normal day let alone venture in to.There lies Falafel King  and for a mere seven bucks you get as close to Middle Eastern food as you're gonna get for the price and location.\\n\\nNow, I'll admit it's not earth shattering goodness that keeps me coming back, but the consistency of their quality is unwavering.

This is a great little diner that you can sit down and have a conversation with the people who are with you and never have to yell over loud music or people. Prices are very cheap so it doesn't hurt the wallet.\\n\\nwhere it does hurt though is the grease. Much like diners of its type, it uses a large flat top to prepare most of it's dishes and the amount of oil, butter and grease which comes with this preparation is hard to avoid. I try to stick with the more lighter items such as the Breakfast Quesadilla I had this morning. Though definitely needed A LOT more seasoning, the eggs were cooked well, crispy bacon bits inside along with fresh veggies and topped with a very mild salsa. It was filling but definitely lack of flavor and seasoning.\\n\\nBut if your looking for a cheap, better tasting Waffle House that is cleaner and friendlier than it's competitors, swing by and enjoy some home cooking."},{"name":"Kiko Japanese Cuisine","address":"110 S Semoran Blvd","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"I ordered ikura, tamago, and hamachi.

The Italian craving takes me to the North End, where on each visit, I make it a point to try a different restaurant.  After reading the rave reviews about Giacomo's here on Yelp, on my most recent visit to Boston, I decided to give it a try.\\n\\nThe don't open til 4:30.  Luckily, I happened by at about 4:00 and found only two people in line and considered myself very lucky after hearing about the very long wait at so many of the North End establishments.\\n\\nO.k., I hate to be hypocritical, as I sometimes get a bit annoyed by negative reviews when the person's complaints have nothing to do with the quality of the food, yet, I now find myself in that very same position!  But, in reviewing a restaurant (which, as I said, I'm new at), I can now see how  things other than the food quality, come into play!\\n\\nBearing my last statement in mind, while good food is \\"generally\\" the primary reason for choosing a restaurant, because I am a \\"coffeeholic\\" and therefore enjoy it with all my meals, I have been known to avoid patronizing restaurants based upon my opinion of their coffee, the quality, how they serve it (have an aversion to it being served in \\"clear glass\\" mugs), whether or not they offer frequent refills, etc.  Imagine my chagrin when the waiter at Giacomo's, upon asking for my drink order, replied, \\"We don't have coffee!\\"  While I understand they probably want to make their money on wine sales, I'm simply not much of a drinker.  I don't think I've ever been in another restaurant in my entire life, other than Chinese,  that didn't have coffee!!  Without thinking, I said, in what I'm sure was a shocked voice, \\"You're kidding, right?\\"  No, he said, \\"No coffee and no dessert!\\"  (The no dessert was fine for I was already tasting Mike's cannoli's!).  Once I got past the shock of \\"no coffee\\" (which wasn't easy) and settled for a coke, sorry to say but that had already eliminated one star from the possible 5-star rating.  :(\\n\\nMy only other non-food disappointment was that this place couldn't have been any bigger than my living room (and I don't have a big house!), and the tables were so crowded together, it felt like you were practically sitting on top of your neighbor.  Needless to say, the resulting noise level was extremely loud (my hubby would have never returned here for this very reason).  I suspect from the little I've read here that this is the norm for most of the North End establishments.  I regret to say that this eliminated another star for me.\\n\\nNow - at last - the important stuff:  the food. The Caesar salad was without a doubt one of the best, if not THE best, Caesar salad to ever touch my palate.  The freshest of Romaine and the dressing was absolutely devine (I wondered if they made it the authentic way with the raw egg?).   I hate to say it, but I can't remember the exact name of the entree I chose, but it was the fuscilli with lobster (ahhh, but they put lobster on EVERYTHING in New England, don't they, and it's so to-die-for!!) and some other kind of seafood with the lobster sauce.  The serving was HUGE (so my brother back in Arlington was quite happy with my left-overs!).  The lobster was fresh and wonderful, but the fuscilli, while I liked it, was a bit too pasty and heavy for my liking.  I consider myself to be a pretty good Italian cook, but have never taken it to the extent of making my own pasta, so this may be why I found their pasta to be a little overwhelming in that it seemed to dominate the entire dish, whereas the sauce and seafood, in my opinion, should have been the dominant flavors.\\n\\nAll in all, would I return here?  Hmmm, I'd consider it, but since I have sooooo many other restaurants to try in the North End, it'd be a very long time before I got back to this one a second time."},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I will start with I generally don't eat pork, so I never thought I'd find myself here.

I realized that during my 5 years of living in Austin, I had never been to this meaty establishment.  And on top of that, I confused it with another bbq joint, the county line.  Yes, I know, I'm not worthy.  But, please let me describe to you what I'd like to call MY BBQ Heaven.\\n\\nIt was a long road with fields of grass to our left and right as we approached Salt Lick.  The sign wasn't very prominent, but for all of you that are as directionless as I am, it's right across the road from Camp Ben.  \\n\\nSeriously, you know it's already going to be good BBQ after having to drive to BFE for it.  But stepping out of the car and inhaling the wonderful meat aroma, you just forget everything else and walk aimlessly towards the door. \\n\\nWe were greeted right away when we entered by the hostess and the big ass bbq pit.  Gosh, what a glorious sight.  It was around 2pm, so we didn't have to wait, but there were plenty of filled tables there still.  \\n\\nThey have an all you can eat lunch option for about $14, but we all decided to just get the combo plates which are about $10 and you can choose up to 3 meats.  I ordered the rib and brisket plate.  Every plate comes with cole slaw, potato salad and beans.  The table also gets warm bread and a plate of onions and pickles.\\n\\nTheir ribs are seriously the juiciest, most tender ribs I've ever had!  The brisket was also perfect.  You can really taste the high quality of the meat itself.  They really know how to cook it so it retains its original and wonderful meat flavor.  Nothing is smothered in a crazy amount of sauce, although there's a couple of containers on the table that you can douse your meat in if you'd like.  It's not the vinegary, sweet kind.  It's tangy though and has a consistency like dijon mustard, but was very good!\\n\\nAlso, the potato salad and cole slaw weren't made of mayo and mustard like most are.  They were both very light and tasty.  The beans were a hit with my family too.\\n\\nSo, yes I suck for never coming here while I lived in Austin and suck even more for mistaking it for another bbq joint.

Damn, I want a rib right now!"},{"name":"Mozart's Coffee Roasters","address":"3825 Lake Austin Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I had heard quiet a lot about this place and was very excited to visit them.

We started with Italian beers, which were delicious. Then we ordered several appetizers. The apps are small, actual appetizer size, \\n\\nThe carpaccio was meltingly tender and delicious--4 thin pieces plus a pile of arugula. The creamy burrata came with slices of various tomatoes and a bit of basil on top. A dozen oysters--no choices as to which locale they are from--just plump, juicy delicious oysters with two sauces. And not on the menu but seasonal, the three stuffed zucchini blossoms were outstanding. The cheese inside was soft and stretchy, and the batter was as light as air. \\n\\nAfter all that, our party of three decided to just split one entree--we went with the \\"open seafood raviolo,\\" which was filled with perfectly cooked and large sea scallops and shrimp. The sauce was tomato-y and creamy, the pasta was a sheet of pasta loosely wrapped under and over the seafood filling. To me, the pasta was a bit undercooked, but some may prefer that degree of al dente. I would have liked it a bit more silky. But I'm sure it is either house-made or possibly procured from one of the fresh pasta makers in the neighborhood. \\n\\nThe room was quiet (though full),tables not on top of each other, and the service was attentive and professional.

My husband had a pink drink out of the drink book which no one orders from really according to our waitress. It was very good. Rimmed in sugar. Yum. Better after you meal though since it is on the sweet side.\\n\\nWe shared a wedge salad w/ blue cheese dressing. Simple and good, nothing special. I had the Parmesan Sole (pan fried) with the lemon butter sauce on the side, served with white rice and asparagus. It was excellent and light. My husband had the Rockfish that came with some other seafood and chorizo mash. It was delicious and spicy.\\n\\nFor dessert, we went with the Upside down apple pie which comes with Amy's mexican vanilla ice cream and I requested some strawberries on the side.

My coworkers and I eagerly choose our entrees and left beaming with smiles. When we got back to the office, we started eating it and the first few bits tasted amazing. Then after about the fifth bite, the oil and the MSG started to sink in and our stomachs became to feel the result of eating shimmery food. Also, the soup tasted as if it was water from the dishwasher mixed with oil from the wok. It was absolutely disgusting. I had a bad aftertaste in my mouth after eating the meal and eagerly sought out some mint or gum to eliminate the disgusting feeling in my mouth. This restaurant truly exemplifies the saying, \\"You get what you pay for.\\" I'm not going to lie, despite my grumbling, I saved my leftovers and had it for lunch the next day.

And I'd like to think that despite being able to enjoy the occasional piece of General Tso's (which, just for the record, I would never order myself) my ability to judge is not too shabby.  That being said, I loved Chung Shin Yuan.  My dining companions and I went for \\"breakfast\\" Sunday morning and got there 15 mins before it opened at 11:30-- good thing since we were at the tail end of the line and got the last table before we would have been forced to wait for the first round of diners to finish.  Regardless, it was well worth the wait.  Although the soup dumplings left a little to be desired (mostly because my heart lies with JoJo Taipei when it comes to soup dumplings) everything else was, in short, amazing!  Plus it was super cheap!  We ordered more than enough food to share and It came out to $10 a person, tip included. I was particularly a fan of the Beef Noodle Soup.   Being my personal version of comfort food, I have been on the hunt for a bowl that is as close to my mom's with little to no luck...until now.  Yay!  It was perfectly spicy and not too oily, which for some reason, I often find with many of the other places I have tried.   I must say the only downfall to this place was the fact that it was advertised to me (albeit by my friends) as \\"dim sum\\" and there were a few things I was looking forward to that weren't on the menu (egg tarts and shumai anyone?)

They included all necessary condiments (soy sauce, pickled ginger, wasabi, and dipping sauces for the shrimp and com thit noung), utensils, chopsticks, and napkins.\\n\\nI tried the firecracker shrimp first. I thought it was going to have more ingredients other than shrimp so I was a little surprised, but the menu did describe it as crispy fried shrimp served with a sweet chili sauce and that was exactly what it was. I was thinking it was going to more like a spring roll with vegetables but instead of chicken or pork, it had shrimp. Anyways, it was just ok. Kind of a little too shrimpy tasting for me. \\n\\nNext I had the bun bo hue. The broth tasted good and had the perfect amount of spice I was looking for. The accompanying meat and vegetables all tasted fresh. Except for salting the noodles (my preference) it was perfect. \\n\\nBoth of the rolls were for my husband, but I wanted to sample both so I did. I thought they were very delicious and had no issues at all. I would order both again. The fish and rice tasted fresh, the lobster had a nice fried crunch to it, and all the flavors and ingredients paired well together.\\n\\nWe saved the com thit nuong for dinner and planned to split it in half but its not really that large of a portion for two people. It's the perfect amount for one person. The grilled pork was cooked nicely and seasoned very well. The side salad was fresh and the rice portion was just right. The only thing I didn't like was the meatloaf. I'm not sure what it was made of but it sort of tasted like a fishcake. \\n\\nI would order from here again and next time dine in the restaurant.

We called and emailed and would scarcely hear from him. We implored him for specific times and days that he would be available to call. Once or twice, he would give us some but then never was available nor would call us back. Finally, in MAY, my husband got the manager on the phone and he said would email us a pricing plan the next day.

How he could not have communicated that to us at any point in the process shows there really was no interest on his part in making our event happen, but that was apparent I guess when he was ignoring our emails and not returning our calls.

For all of those times I waited for an hour+ at other brunch places, that were less than stellar, I now wish I hadn't.\\n\\nLike Rise N' Dine, Thumbs Up, Ria's, etc., Stone Soup Kitchen serves breakfast all day as well as lunch. The first time I went, I had the lunch which was very good. Lot's of veggie options and their soups are great (as one would hope from the name). They also have a frequent soup card with the ninth one free which is always nice. I had the Hungarian mushroom and holy cow...there are a ton of mushrooms in this thing. Possibly too many mushrooms as the curry-like broth is extremely delicious, but unfortunately there wasn't that much room for it given the fungi party going on in the bowl. I also had half of a veggie sandwich which was a solid addition to the meal.\\n\\nImpressed with the lunch, and extremely curious about their fairly vast breakfast menu, I returned with friends this morning for brunch. If you've read my previous reviews then you'll know brunch is my favorite meal (though I always order breakfast items I still consider it brunch given the time of day). This being the case, I was looking forward to their selections to see if they passed my fairly stringent breakfasty standards. THEY DID!\\n\\nEaster came early for me as I discovered this hidden egg.

Yes they don't serve booze, Will P., but they let you bring whatever you want and you don't have to pay exorbitant prices for it. So really you should give yourself two stars for preparedness. \\n\\nLong story short, Salt Lick is a great time, with great food and a great atmosphere.

Went in around 2pm on a Thursday and we were seated right away. \\n\\nHonestly menu was a little unimpressive... I felt it was limited and from the descriptions on the menu I had no idea what kind of food they would be... We had to ask the waitress to get a better idea of what kind of food each item were...\\n\\nWe ordered the following:\\n\\n1) Paella (4/5) - It was not the usual Spanish paella I was used to... But none the less the dish was pretty good... The presentation was pretty amazing but I thought the dish might have unwanted herbs and spices... But to my surprise my whole family thought the dish was pretty delicious... It came with egg and sausage of some sort and a type of spread that was good. And the diced cucumbers on top added a refreshing touch.\\n2) Mussels (4/5) - We got the mussels with bacon... Forgot what is was called. But the mussels were fresh and nicely cooked... The broth was good but for me it was a little too creamy and fatty bc of the bacon but my bf enjoyed it a lot... Just wish they gave some bread to soak in the broth...\\n3) Venison Burger (3/5) - I didn't get to personally try it but from my family members didn't care for it too much and said that the meat was too dry... They said it was just ok.\\n4) Gnocchi Special (4/5) - It was their special of the day... gnocchi with like 3 or 5 different cheeses... The dish was pretty good and pretty cheesy which we enjoyed. \\n5) Waffles (overall 4/5) - The actual waffles were not good bc it was kind of mushy and had no flavor (2/5) but the sauces you order were amazing (5/5)!!! we got their lavender chocolate which I was really impressed with bc you can taste a good amount of lavender! Very good! We also got the salted caramel and it was nicely sweet... not too sweet. very delicious. \\n\\nThe interior and atmosphere is very cool. I liked how they furnished it and the lights... I think it would be a really cool place to grab a drink at at night. The seats were comfy and the atmosphere is not pretentious... The service was very good. Our waitress was cool and made some good recommendations... Enjoyed their service...\\n\\nOverall it was a 4 star experience...

For the main dish, we split the fried chicken, and it was definitely enough food for two (especially since we got the appetizers). The breading on the chicken was really good and well spiced and I loved the mac and cheese! My only comment would be that the bacon in the mac was pretty thick so it was almost like a ham mac and cheese, but it was still delicious.

This includes a little bit of everything (brisket, ribs, sausage, coleslaw, potato salad, beans, fresh baked bread), and as you finish off your plates they are happy to bring you more of whatever you like.  The sides are all homestyle - not the overly mayoed crappy salads you get at many places.  The meat is amazingly flavourful, and their sauce is unique.  Just take a look:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qLJUDPOamhLdbtfbcWyHnA?select=Dm9cVu8UA2shliN3Im63Tg\\n\\n2)  When ordering, ask for the brisket to be moist.  They don't make it clear that you can ask for the type you want, but if you ask they are happy to oblige.  The moist is my favourite.\\n\\n3)  Come hungry.\\n\\nRandom fact:\\n\\n1)  One of the ingredients in their sauce is miso!  Yes, who would expect that in this setting?!?!?!!  But when you dig a bit deeper into their history you find out that the couple that founded this very Texas BBQ were a man from Texas who was stationed in Hawaii and met his wife Hisako there who moved back to Texas with him.  \\n\\n2)  They now have a small location in the Austin airport for those that want to grab a brisket sandwich on the run!

I know, you don't need GREAT service at a buffet, but decent service would be nice. It took me forever to get a glass of wine. This was further complicated by the fact that the waiter really didn't know much about the selection at all. For instance, if you only have one ros√© wine on your menu, you should REALLY know if it's a dry or sweet one. If you call it \\"our version of White Zin,\\" I'm steering as far from it as possible. If you then try and backpedal and say \\"well, it's not too sweet.

It was around 6PM on a Saturday and there was already a line out the door.  In fact, it had just begun to wrap around the block.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I had just finished a cannoli each, so at least we weren't starving while waiting in line, which surprisingly, wasn't too bad.  Although it looked daunting, the wait turned out to be only about one hour.  Unfortunately they do not take reservations, so standing in line is a must in order to eat there.\\n\\nThe place itself is small.  Intimate would be an understatement.  Daily specials are written on a giant chalkboard on the wall.  The menu is simple (apps, salads, marsalas, parmigianas, pasta).  Our waitress wasn't rude or even brusque, actually she was friendly and would describe her service as very efficient.\\n\\nWe ordered a small caesar salad ($5), small calamari ($7), the special of mussels, clams, half lobster over linguine with your choice of sauce ($20, and my boyfriend got the fra diavolo sauce), and the other special of shrimp and lobster meat over linguine with Giacomo's sauce (lobster based red with a touch of bechamel).  Can't remember the price on my pasta dish but it was under $20.\\n\\nOur salad and calamari arrived quickly.  Our lightly breaded calamari was great - wasn't greasy or oily.  The caesar was not bad, just a typical caesar salad.  It was nice to have some fresh, crunchy veggies though.\\n\\nOur pasta came out with perfect timing.  Two things warranted our jaw dropping reaction: the portion size and the heat.  The plate could hardly contain my boyfriend's pasta.  It was piled on, and the amount of pasta, mussels, clams and lobster were beyond generous.  There was a full half lobster nestled under the pasta (full half? Oops.  You know what I mean).  Although my food was served in more of a bowl-ish shape, it was still a ridiculously large amount (you can see the shrimp and chunks of lobster swimming beautifully in the whirlpool of pasta).  Both dishes were PIPING HOT.  As in wafting steam into our faces (look at my pics).  I LOVED that.  My biggest pet peeve with restaurants is lukewarm food.  Having that big, steaming bowl of seafood pasta placed before me was like seeing an apparition of Christ.  I heard beautiful choir music and felt like I was in heaven.  No joke.\\n\\nThe sauces were amazing.  Homemade, bright, flavorful, fresh tomato sauces bathed the pasta, and the seafood was plentiful like sweet baby Jesus' love for me.\\n\\nCash only, no dessert available.  Oh, and they DO offer take out as soon as they open.  The South End (Back Bay) location DOES offer reservations though.\\n\\nIf you have the time to wait in line for their food, do so and be rewarded."},{"name":"In a Pickle Breakfast & Lunch","address":"655 Main St","city":"Waltham","stars":"4","text":"A fantastic spot for Sunday brunch.

My contempt for them is a bit alarming, I'll admit.\\n\\nReasons for my hate:  I hate when places put on the air of refinement when they haven't earned it through style or skill.  I hate when they assume that unrefined foods need refinement.  I hate when they attempt flurishes when they can't master the basics.  My sense memories of these slices bring to mind stewed tomatoes on a wet saltine.  Crust, sauce, and cheese are the simple pleasures that add up to pizza, and The Upper Crust seems set on avoiding or destroying them in the name of something refined.  If you do the thing you do right, be as proud and inventive and flamboyant as you like, but just do the thing right."},{"name":"Teranga","address":"1746 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Stopped in for a drink.

We started by ordering a bottle of Pinotage, which was excellent.  Next came the complimentary bread with an extraordinary dipping sauce.  My friend and I shared the Accara as an appetizer.  It was fried perfectly, not greasy at all, and came with a delicious sauce.  For my dinner, I ordered the Salade Ordinaire, which was nothing but ordinary, and the vegetarian nems, which were amazing; I can't even describe how delicious they were!  To end our wonderful dinner, I enjoyed the mango tart tatin, while my friend tried the Beignets Dougoup.  While my dessert was quite enjoyable, I had a bit of food envy - the Beignets were delicious!

Ultimately, I'm docking the extra star because the staff managing the front of the house seem particularly clueless, and soured what was otherwise a really positive experience. \\n\\nI called early for a same-day reservation of 12 people at 8pm on a Wednesday. A few people dropped out, so when I arrived at 7:30pm and checked in, I let them know I would only have 9 as a few people had dropped out. They asked how many children I had in the group and I said none - all adults, and actually, all men except for me. I joked that we should be seated in the \\"adults only\\" area. She thanked me for the info and I headed to the bar with a few people of my party. \\n\\nThe outside bars were insane, but we were able to find a tight spot at one of the indoor bars. The bartenders were excellent. They never let our drinks go empty and were always checking in on us. The rest of my party showed up and one of them gave me the buzzer since they knew they were the last of our group and you can only check in when everyone is there.\\n\\nMaybe 10 minutes later the buzzer goes off. Since we needed to settle at the bar I went ahead and went up to the host booth by myself, where they told me to wait and someone would be there shortly to seat us.  As I'm waiting, the rest of my party (that's 9 total) are standing at the front. The staff at the host stand seems annoyed with us - can you wait over here? no - over here. Then they told us it would be another few minutes. After I returned the buzzer it was another 10 minutes before we sat. Why would you buzz us if it's not ready? \\n\\nWell then - they seat us at what looks like the tiniest table for 8 men and 1 woman. It is a small square table tucked in a corner. Just next to us, a long, empty table for 10 people is set. We ask if we can have that one instead, and they say that no, there's a group of 10 that table is set for. So we all squeeze in to this table. It ends up being... OK, except we didn't quite have enough space for all the plates, drinks, etc. About 30 minutes into our meal that table of 10 gets sat. Except they only brought 6, and 4 of them were 9 year old girls. It's not the staff's fault that these people didn't indicate they'd have a smaller party, like I did, but once they found out they should have DEFINITELY offered us to move to that table. We looked ridiculous all cramped into that corner and the huge table looked ridiculous with almost no one sitting at it (the 4 girls were running around the restaurant dancing).  The unfortunate seating experience is what I'll remember from this visit in the long run. \\n\\nWe had some good appetizers, I don't remember what. I think we had some sausage that was good. For dinner I had the fish and chips. I upgraded to the skinny fries, but I think I misinterpreted skinny for low calorie. The skinny fries were LITERALLY skinnier , but covered in herbs, parmesan, and truffle oil. As much as I love these type of fries, the ones that I was served were cold and chewy. Ugh. Luckily they accidently sent out the normal chips too, and those were OK. This was definitely NOT the best version of fish & chips I've ever had. \\n\\nFor dessert we had irish iced coffee - best thing of the night. \\n\\nGreat service from the wait staff and bartenders, okay food, but not great front of the house.

Based on the reviews and the priciness (no prices on an online menu is a big red flag), I wondered why she wanted to pay more for worse food.  \\n\\nBut I digress.\\n\\nThings seemed odd from the start-the entrance to the restaurant is very plain, and the valet area for parking extremely small.  The waitstaff were friendly and the roasted potatoes my mom and I tried as a snack before the rest arrived were ok.  The table was uneven, and I'm not talking about it being a little wobbly: the entire outer 6-8 inches of the round table had a distinct downward tilt.  Which is RIDICULOUS.   Dive beach bars have flat tables, an expensive restaurant has no excuse for being unable to procure flat tables!  \\n\\nWhen the rest of the group arrived and we were mulling over appetizers, our server (Mercury) asked if we would like to sample a little prosciutto and mozzarella, maybe some pecorino.  He asked me if it would be alright if they brought out a plate for the table to share.  Thinking about cost at this point, I figured, 'Well, it isn't uncommon for nice restaurants to give large groups tastings to entice them to buy more.  If they charge us, it will just be for an antipasto platter.'  Instead, each of the 6 people at the table received their own plate with 1 ravioli, 3 half-slices of tomato with 2 quarter-size balls of mozzarella and arugula (um, why not basil?) and 3 slices of prosciutto.  \\nWhen it came time for entrees, despite the menu and our server's fervent exclamations of various entrees being \\"THE BEST ribeye/veal/roast chicken etc.\\", most of us were underwhelmed by our entrees.  I ordered the roast chicken (a barometer I often use for general quality-how well a restaurant prepares a simple dish is very telling).  The portion was large, but all of it was dry.  It was the worst roast chicken I've had in a while.  And I've had roasted chicken in Italy, this isn't some kind of cooking method thing-this was pure incompetence.  I've made better roast chicken in terrible ovens, I've even tasted better roast chicken from the grocery rotisserie!  \\n\\nThe kicked was when it came time for the bill: the appetizer course, which was presented in a way that we DID NOT request? $16 per plate.  This added $96 to about a $300 bill, and honestly made everyone at the table furious.  It was a bait and switch, pure and simple- much like other reviewers have described. We realized why our waiter had been so happy: that little stunt added quite a bit onto the auto-gratuity!  $16 a plate was as if we had each ordered a full appetizer for ourselves, instead the antipasto for sharing Mercury described.  The furor caused by this stunt (as well as the more budget-conscious family members panic about the huge extra unasked-for cost), completely ruined my mother's birthday.  \\n\\nSo please, please, take my advice: DON'T go here- you'll probably be charged for more than you order, the location is terrible, and the food ranges from ok to pretty crappy.  Go to Ecco, which has a better location, more ambiance, and WAY better food for cheaper prices.

The decor is better than I expected and looking at the menu there are many options to choose from, which this is great. Everything is well priced as well. The reason I give it 3 stars is because I've definitely had better Peruvian food. I had the \\"Lomo Saltado a Lo Pobre\\" It was just okay. There is this weird seasoning to the meat that I disliked and gave me a weird aftertaste--I've never had this taste at any other Peruvian place I've been to which is why I wasn't a fan. My friend ordered \\"Levantate si Puede\\" and he said it was way too sour or salty--he couldn't pin point which was worse. The lemonade I ordered also was the weakest lemonade I've had in my life.

They wanted to replace it, but I refused.  Then the \\"cook\\" (certainly not a chef) had the nerve to start complaining about me not eating his stinking hot dog!!!

However, this was salt marinated with steak, or salt with a side of steak. \\n\\nThis was a few years ago, but somehow, the food left a bad impression and I still remember it enough to write the review.

I love Italian food, I love wine and I love this side of Atlanta. My husband and I have been in town for 5 months now and decided to give this joint a shot. I ordered the Brisket Cannelloni, and he ordered the wild mushroom risotto. My Cannelloni was meat filled and rather heavy, I was hoping for more of a filling featuring fluffy ricotta and brisket instead of a dense log of shredded meat. My husband's risotto to be fair was okay. The rice grains were cooked well but the overall consistency of the dish was too dry. The mushrooms were mini portabella type chopped in quarters and cooked with the rice. Nothing screamed wild or at least exotic like oyster, Chanterelles or porchini. I had hoped for a sauteed mushroom to add condensed flavor, I suppose that is what the plate lacked, real deep mushroom flavor. The use of truffle to compensate was overpowering and I had wished it was notated on the menu that the risotto had truffle essence/oil/salt etc. Some people enjoy that funky earthy flavor and others do not. I had 2 glasses of Italian Pinot and my husband a glass of Cali white. We asked for the dessert menu and the waitress spouted it off hinting at her favorite, a gelato pie with bacon infused Oreo crust. It was disappointing at best, we sent it back. The pecan gelato had that gritty feeling like it had been defrosted and refrozen.... not appetizing I daresay.

There were several dirty tables that had not been cleared. The waitress dropped off a menu and walked back to the table by the register to talk with the other kitchen staff members. They were speaking in their native language and sounded like they were arguing over something. We were ready to order and tried to flag the waitress who looked our way and ignored us.

Clearly they don't do a good job preparing their food!\\nThe spicy California roll was basically a regular California roll with spicy mayo squirted on top. Nothing to write home about.\\nThe nabeyaki udon was just deplorable. The chicken was pan fried and dry. The egg which is usually boiled in the soup was also pan fried and over cooked. The veggies in the soup were strips of cabbage and carrot which is likely what they use for their teriyaki dishes. The tempura that came with the udon was mostly just batter and had the tiniest piece of shrimp in it. To top it off, the soup base tasted like diluted soya sauce.

We ordered the beef brisket, which was very good but certainly not something that was memorable versus others I've had. I think it's safe to say that everything was very good, but not amazing.

Also, the beer menu looks a tad expensive at first.  4-5 bucks for 12oz on draught... not so great, right?

I'm not asking questions!\\n       As for the food, the only thing I've actually had is the hush puppies.  They were fabulous;  not hush puppies at all, but fabulous.  Let's just say they were bacon cheese fritters.  With apple sauce.  I don't generally go for the bacon-cheese anything, but these were seriously awesome.  Overpriced, yes, but I would order them again, and I would most certainly return to try other menu items.  Take what you want from that.\\n      Now for the loss of a star...

It was a four-course dinner with two appetizers, one main and one dessert. I did not like one of the appetizers too much - a vegetarian bean soup, but I was extremely happy with the entree. It was absolutely delicious. \\nDessert definitely could have been done better. It was a slightly soggy shortbread cookie with a scoop of ice cream (which seems to have bacon bites in it). I find that many restaurants nowadays try too hard to impress in the dessert round, while a more traditional chocolate cake or creme brulee would have done a perfectly job ending a meal. \\nTwo other things that definitely would have helped with dining experience: a window was kept open all the way that freezing night so I was close to frozen towards the end of my meal; the lighting of the restaurant was way too dim. \\nOther than that the tasting menu was still very much worth it. Lovely wine, too."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Pasta swimming in cream and butter.

My friend and I ordered the house special pho, the roasted pork salad roll and the duck frybread. The salad roll was definitely a highlight of the meal; crunchy bits of skin and succulent pork mixed with the peanut sauce was great. I personally don't know if the frybread was actually supposed to be crispy or not so I won't comment on that, however the duck came out a little dry. A little more hoisin or house aioli on the side would've been great.\\n\\nNow to the pho. Like most have said, the soup is great; very homey and clean. I would've been satisfied with a bit more toppings considering the price, but I understand the Yaletown tax. The noodles however were a bit disappointing.

My steak was supposedly 8oz, but was bigger than her 10oz cut. The lobster tail was okay. The meat was really tough. It was stuffed with scallops, which were also really tough. I know oven cooking seafood is difficult because you can easily overcook it, but for almost $70 I really wanted to be blown away. The steak was cooked the way I asked, but there was no seasoning. I cook filet at home all the time, and a little salt and pepper never hurt anyone. It was served with a plain brown gravy on the side, which added some much needed flavor. \\n\\nAlso worth mentioning that it took 1 hour from the time we ordered, till the time we were served our entrees. We were seated at 9:00pm, and started eating our steaks at 10:15. \\n\\nWe ended up being so stuffed from the pasta that we brought our steaks home. I ended up searing them with butter in a cast iron skillet, and they tasted better (no joke) the next morning as steak and eggs. \\n\\nIn addition to our bottle of wine, we had a couple cocktails. I didn't try her's, but my \\"Boom Boom\\" tasted like a Jack and Ginger. It was supposed to be Bourbon, Ginger liquor, Mint, Simple Syrup, and Lemon juice. It made no mention of club soda, but it was carbonated. They didn't muddle the mint, so there was no mint flavor. \\n\\nIn total, my bill was $310 including a 20% tip.

The second thing i look for is the noodle and here they serve you undercooked noodles (you can still taste the flour). Blow torched char siu was pretty good but overall its a pretty disappointing bowl of ramen. \\n\\nService: Service was unprofessional! We came in around 9.30 PM. The host was not concentrating and was not looking at the front door. We had to wait for around a minute in front of the door before being seated.

My friends and I decided to visit Barcelona wine bar last Saturday evening to catch up with each other. I was the first to arrive in a party of three and was told that I could not be seated until everyone was there. Unfortunately, my guests would be about 30 minutes late so I had to wait outside after informing the hostess that I had planned to buy drinks and food while I waited. Anyhow, she persisted that this was there policy. Thirty minutes later I walked back in the restaurant to use the restroom and preceded to chat with a couple of ladies who were also waiting in line for the restroom as they only have three. Anyhow, the ladies went on to tell me their experience and how they had a party of seven and that four did not arrive on time, but they were seated right away.  I told them of my incident and we both agreed that this is the kind of thing that makes one think if it's a black or white thing. I chose to give them the benefit, however the ladies said if I had any issues I should speak with the nice manager Mike that they had met. I thanked them and walked back to the front to find my friend arriving. Now two of us are there so we were seated by a completely different person than the first when I arrived. We ordered dinner, drinks laughed, chatted and had a great time. So much that we all ordered dessert. I forgot to mention that the place was packed and full of life. Great atmosphere and we were feeling good about the place other than the slow service, however even that was somewhat overlooked. Out of the blue a guy comes over to the table and asked if we would do him a favor. We asked what's the favor. He said that he would give us 50% off our tab if we gave up the table. We all looked at each other puzzled as I still was still eating my dessert. He said that he had a line of people outside in the rain and was trying to make room for people..as if we were not paying customers. Being the accountant that I am I said sure to save money as I assumed he'd be asking others. However, to my shock he went right to the register adjusted our check, which was only for the food and not the tab as he originally said and then he walked away. I was in shock. This man was the manager Mike who I was told was nice and helpful. However, instead of asking how everything was going he asked the only table in the restaurant with all black people to basically leave so that he could put someone else in our seats. We were enjoying ourselves and spending money like everyone else. Why were we singled out??? We mentioned it to our waiter to try to make sense of it, however even he was making excuses for the ignorant manager. I have never experienced anything like this in my life. My friends and I frequent restaurants all the time, are professionals and know how to conduct ourselves. There was no excuse for Mike to approach us with such a request. Did he assume we would take the bait because we were black?  If so then he was right. I would never stay where I'm not wanted and doubt I'd revisit the place as it's now on my list as a racist experience.

It's one part pretense (we'll apply that to the cocktails and beer list - both satisfying), one part good service, one part location location location, and one part food. A pizza, 2 drinks, and an appetizer, plus tax and tip came to a bit over $50, but I felt I got my money's worth in terms of an enjoyable meal and evening. I also happen to love broccoli rabe, which is featured prominently here both as a pizza topping and a side dish. They feature innovative twists on cocktails and a beer selection that includes a nice variety of international and US, but I was happy to settle for Ipswich local Clown Shoes Galactic IPA.\\n\\nMAST' is a nice add to the variety of pizza/Italian in Boston.

Your quesadilla rocked my world beyond the realm of just \\"Yay, it's a quesadilla, I'm so happy!\\" It wasn't over stuffed and watery, but instead teetered on the precipice so daringly with a perfect balance of cheese and non cheese items, with the salsa and sour cream being sure to keep that balance going, like identical twins on a seesaw. Your staff was friendly and accurate, and service was timely, although I was admittedly distracted by my present company enough to not notice them much.

We always end having numerous guests staying at our house. My wife brother's and his fianc√© were going to stay with us so we took them out for dinner at The Salt Lick BBQ. We like to take out of town guests there because it is a unique experience. It involves a scenic drive out to the middle of the country. Most of the time when we go there, there is a long wait. They can seat around 800 people at one time and on average 2000 a day. We got there around 7 pm, and the wait was about 50 minutes. A cold front had just moved in, and it was too cold this night to wait outside.\\n\\nThe first time I went to The Salt Lick was during a fraternity rush event in college. I remember eating so much because everyone at the table had ordered the barbecue family style. Family style is all you can eat brisket, sausage, pork ribs, with sides of potato salad, coleslaw and beans with bread, pickles and onions. Lay off the good bread because it is really dense and will fill you up. You can even take the leftovers home. The Salt Lick is also BYOB (bring your own booze), but there is also a store on-site that you can buy beer and wine from. They also have a winery and tasting room as well now. Back in college, I had a lot of fond memories from The Salt Lick. One time after finishing the family style meal, one of my friend asked if they had any dessert with meat in them. Of course he was drunk.\\n\\nThe pits around the compound are for show. The meats are smoked overnight in the back and then refrigerated. The meats are then reheated in the finishing pits before they are served.\\n\\nI did not go with the family style this time. It has been a couple of years since I have gotten it. Tonight I ordered the Thurman's Choice which comes with brisket, pork ribs, and sausage. The sides you get would be beans, potato salad, and coleslaw, but I went with extra potato salad instead of beans. The brisket this night was chewy and under-cooked. The collagen needed to be broken down a little bit more. The brisket did have a good smoke ring and flavor. The ribs were smoky and good. They were nice and tender and good glaze on them. I am a big fan of their sausage. The sausage is similar what you would find in a grocery store and similar to kielbasa. They are great to dip in sauce. The Salt Lick does have good barbecue sauce. It compliments their smoke meats very well and now also comes in a habanero flavor. I love their potato salad. It is very different from traditional potato salad. It is served warm, taste great, and has a consistent of mashed potatoes. The coleslaw tastes fresh and is tart and vinegary. Everyone at the table got blackberry cobbler for dessert and loved it.\\n\\nI have been to The Salt Lick BBQ about a dozen times now. The brisket has been better. The lean brisket is actually pretty decent. The beef ribs used to be a Sunday thing only but are available all of the time and are quite tasty. The menu has been expanded and offered more types of smoked meat like prime rib. There is even a cookbook. Remember The Salt Lick only takes cash. It is a great place to take out of town folks or spend an afternoon hanging out in the country with friends. Their barbecue can be overrated at times, but it is about the whole experience."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Very good BBQ and more of a GREAT place to enjoy your BBQ.

Sure, the environment is cozy, the servers are friendly and attentive, and the dishes are beautifully prepared. \\n\\nHowever, portions were tiny and the food was just so-so. The Grass-Fed Beef Cheek, Brisket, and Smoked Beef Tongue Hash - sounds delicious, right? - came out cold, soupy, and just plain inedible. The beef was overcooked, the egg had been sitting out way too long, and there was very little flavor. The House-Cured Scottish Sea Trout & Mackeral Rillettes did not fair much better. While the sea trout concoction was pretty tasty, portions were just way too small to justify the $18 price tag. Not to mention, the bagel and accompaniments seemed like they were purchased straight out of Costco. The Coriander and Cashew Granola, and Organic Yogurt was also, sadly, a miss. The flavors just didn't work for me and there was way too little yogurt to balance the strong flavors from the coriander granola. \\n\\nThe only sweet spot in my meal came from the House-Made Donut with Confiture du Lait. Probably one of the best donuts I've ever hard. Perfectly crispy/fluffy and with just the right amount of sweetness to keep you coming back for more.\\n\\nOverall, however, I left the restaurant paying ~$75 for party of two (and this was without alcohol!). Way overpriced for a brunch that was just mediocre.\\n\\nMy advice? Walk a few blocks down to Cafe Luna to discover what a real brunch should taste like.

We should have just left then.  But we didn't. We sat at our table, which seemed to be in the middle of the servers paths and began our meal. The full Craigie  experience, with the addition of fiddlehead ferns cooked in duck fat. I won't bore you with a course by course, plate by plate, but will just give you the lowlights. There were barely any highlights.  The aforementioned  ferns were charred to a crisp with absolutely no taste. Like they were some how charred while being cooked in water. One course was salmon collar, which would have been better served with the meat scraped out and offered as an amuse. Rather it was served with a jicama and Asian pear slaw, I did not realize it was the year 1995. It also had a sea salt accompaniment. I'm not sure what kind because the server and food runners didn't even mention it. It just appeared.  The only bright spot was dessert, and I normally don't get dessert because I order heavy on the food side. Luckily I was still hungry and needed something more to eat. Our bill for four was in the mid $700's, can't remember exactly. And we did have drinks and wine. Service-poor. Food-disappointing.

Seven members of our party received their orders while two had not received their meal. Toward the conclusion of our meal, the two that had not received their meal inquired whether the waitress forgot to bring their food. In turn, the waitress replied she had not and walked away. The waitress returned a second time and was asked, again, if they would received their meal and if not to take the order off the ticket. The waitress proceeded to the opposite end of the table and replied \\"I never put it in, but if you still want it I can\\". At this moment the table was perplexed at why the order was never put in and everyone else received their food. She was asked to bring the manager to the table and with delay we had to ask another server to get the manager because she hadn't returned to the table. The manager approached the table and tried to plea with our party to forgive the waitress on her behalf for her behavior. The manager offered to bring the food and suggested to \\"take care of it\\". After the manager brought the food and took care of the bill, she allowed Khadijah to come back to our table and she exhibited her same disrespectful behavior. Khadijah was asked to bring 'to-go' boxes and waters, which she did not bring, and returned to a member of our party and got within an inch of her face and replied \\"see, that is why you didn't get your food\\" and walked off. The table beside ours overheard he comment and they were also in awe. That comment confirmed that she intentionally did not place the order which is very unacceptable. The two members of our party left the table to speak with the manager and Khadijah returned to give receipts to the remaining members of the party. Khadijah was asked to clarify what had happened and she replied that she was \\"sized up\\" and that was her reasoning for not entering the order.  The entire party felt very disrespected and we feel the matter was not handled appropriately by the manager. The manager, we felt, should have closed our table for the remainder of the night to ensure the matter did not escalate. We have patronized many restaurants and we have never received the level of disrespect we experienced tonight. Her actions were very blatant and intentional.

The food takes a while and I always have to flag down the server if I want something else or even just to get my tab without waiting another 10 minutes for them to notice I'm done. It's been a pretty consistent issue each time I'm in, so I think it's worth mentioning this is not a place to go if you're in a hurry or are expecting a high touch service experience. \\n\\nOverall, I enjoy eating at Buddha Thai and will continue to come back, just be prepared to spend a little bit of extra time if you're just popping in for lunch."},{"name":"Kiko Japanese Cuisine","address":"110 S Semoran Blvd","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"Ok......if you're vegan or plant based.. come here!

We do know that right?  If not, now you do.  The great thing is aside from the fact that Luce is well deserving of this list is that this restaurant is in my neighborhood.  Walking distance baby!!!  Well, that is good for me at least.  Not sure if you feel the same.\\n\\nSue's birthday weekend continued into this past weekend.  We had been talking about going to Luce for a while and we finally were able to do it on Saturday night.  Yes, the place is small and you will most likely wait to get a table, but we showed up at 5:30 and there were two tables open.  We chose the table away from the front door and were seated immediately.\\n\\nI really didn't know what to expect from this place.  I read the article in Bon App√©tit and knew that this was Italian food at its most basic.  Sometimes simple is the best.  Actually I pretty much always agree with that.  It is the way I cook too.\\n\\nThe food here is quite affordable.  That needs to be said right off the bat.  We ate a ton of food and the bill before tip was $55.  True, we didn't drink.  That will add money to your bill obviously, but you can still eat and drink well here and probably get out the door with tip for under $30.  Who says you need to spend hundreds of dollars to get a very good meal?  I don't have that kind of money and I'm happy that Luce caters to those of us who like to eat, but can't always spend a ton of money on food.\\n\\nThis is what we ordered.  We started out with a few of their Antipasti (all $2 each).  The fresh mozzarella with anchovy is exactly how it sounds.  Good, but I can make this at home so I will pass on it the next time.  Crostini with fig and goat cheese mousse.  A bit sweet, a bit tart and very good.  Farro and Parmesan pie which I believe was similar to a frittata.  A nice slice of that was presented.  We also had the salt focaccia ($3) which was very pillowy and warm.  Finally for starters we split a whole portion of the escarole salad with warm bagna cauda ($12).  We both agreed that the salad dressing was subtle, but with a nice saltiness to it.  This is how salads should always be.\\n\\nFor main dishes Sue had the Baked Stuffed Trout ($12).  This is a whole trout so if you are squeamish about seeing a fish head on your food you probably want to avoid this dish.  We weren't sure what it was stuffed with, but it was very simple.  Probably cooked in some oil with salt and pepper.  Nothing fancy here.  I had the Seafood Stew ($15) with grilled bread.  Squid, clams, mussels, shrimp and a few other things in a tomato based broth.  Very fresh and also very simple.  Stew always tastes better on a cold and rainy night.\\n\\nFor dessert we had the Luce cake ($7).  It had promise as it was stuffed with pistachio cream, but they soaked it a bit too much in an orange liqueur which was a bit overpowering.  Overall not the best way to finish this meal, but we will know that for the next time we come back.\\n\\nThe service was very friendly.  Our server did forget to bring our focaccia out with our salad (she actually forgot we ordered it), but that was a minor blip in what was a very good experience.  It is worthy of this list.  How they picked Luce out of all of the good food was have here in Portland is anyone's guess, but they still should be on this list.  I can't get over how affordable this place is.  There is no doubt that I will be back here again very soon."},{"name":"Denny's","address":"8076 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"Horrible HORRIBLE service.

Over the years watching them move from one location to the other, with now a patio, this place should be a gold mine. But every local friend I have had gradually dismissed the place. Food is decent. Staff not so much. Philosophy as a local business is questionable at best. During the local Blues/Rib fest, they pulled all of their furniture off of the patio and put it inside so people wouldn't sit down. Meanwhile had about 5 people inside at the bar and packed around by the furniture. Here's an idea, sit people on the patio and serve them food and wine while listing to Blues and make some money over two days & provide a great environment for people to visit, relax and enjoy our small town. Or you can pile all of your furniture inside so no one can be inside or out. A great organization should start by being a good citizen to its community and provide great service. Not happening here.

Sure, the $7 1/2 carafe of house wine gives an initial tingle of great value, but that's not usually the point of a wine bar. I'm looking for a rich, cozy interior like (the original) Malaga or Vino Vino, or perhaps the charming patio of Uncorked or House Wine. The old diner look, with a hodgepodge of vintage and/or ugly furniture and decidedly unsexy lighting, really doesn't work for me.\\n\\nIf you're ever in a beer mood when your friends are looking for wine, there's mixed news about Simplicity. They offer 4 different draft beers, but in my less than humble opinion, it's mass-market beer for people who aren't really into beer: Shiner, Stella, Blue Moon, and something else too uninteresting to remember. So that's Gambrinus, Anheuser-Busch/InBev, and Molson Coors... How about carrying something from a local brewery?\\n\\nMy vegan friends seem to like the tapas, but I found the menu unenticing.

A touch of this lifestyle came to South Norwalk, Connecticut in 1995 in a small thirty seat wine bar when Sasa Mahr-Batuz and Andy Pforzheimer opened the first Barcelona Wine Bar. The demand for this slice of the good life had proven so successful that Barcelona Wine Bar expanded to other locations including Atlanta.  Heading up the kitchen at the Inman Park location is Executive Chef Shane Devereaux whose unique hip cooking style brings an exciting flair to these time-honored Spanish and Latin classics. With the coming of Barcelona Wine Bar to Atlanta, a void was filled as the city now has a restaurant where both wine and food take center stage together as equals.\\n\\nThe wine director for Barcelona Wine Bar is the vivacious Gretchen Thomas.  For a thirty something, I am impressed on how Gretchen uses her wine knowledge to search out the best value to quality wines of which many are way under the radar for all to enjoy.  The wine list is just short of an encyclopedia and is like a who's who of Iberian wines as well as a multitude of gems from South America and beyond. It is rare to find Jerez sherry on any list but to find the best of the best is stunning.  Instead of a dry martini, try the bone dry Lustau's Palo Cortado \\"Peninsula\\" which offers great balance with rich almond aromas with prune eau de vie flavors that seem to linger forever and matches well with a serving of Boquerones, filets of anchovies marinated in garlic, parsley and olive oil. Another treasure is Alvear's \\"Carlos VII\\" Amontillado with its caramel nose and hazelnut, toffee flavors, which beckons a nibble or two from the outstanding Spanish cheese offerings- yum!!!  \\n\\nBesides the extensive sherry offerings, Barcelona Wine Bar has assembled a fantastic wine by the glass program. If bubbles are the desire then treat it with a glass of Sumarroca Gran Reserva - the roasted chickpea puree or the marinated olives are nice matches for this creamy sparkler. To complement the Gambas al Ajillo, plump shrimp saut√©ed with roasted garlic and a splash of sherry, or the grilled scallops made with preserved lemons - Scallops a la Plancha - a glass of the Godello from the Valdeorras region is in order.  This beauty is noted for its complex yet elegant citrus aromas and flavors with a slight balsamic-like tingle in the aftertaste, which adds a nice accent to these seafood offerings. The other unique white wine to consider is the San Clodio from Ribeiro with its nectar-like flavors and a peppery spark in the background making this blend of indigenous varietals one refreshing vino - try it with the Crispy Calamari that's served with a smoked pepper aioli, or the Salted Cod in a spicy tomato sauce, or the Pulpo Gallego - grilled octopus with piment√≥n picante and boiled fingerling potatoes - so many choices to be had but no matter what you choose it will be a winner. \\n\\nOne of the rock stars in making Spanish wines is Alvaro Palacios and his organically farmed \\"La Montesa\\" Crianza from Rioja hits all the notes with its deep black fruit flavors. This ultra-balanced elegant wine needs foods of substance like the Chorizo with Sweet and Sour Figs in a balsamic-sherry glaze or the savory Albondigas - meatballs in a sassy tomato sauce. My personal find was the 2009 Ac√∫stic, from Ac√∫stic Celler made in the rugged Montsant region of Spain.  Using traditional techniques, winemaker Albert Jane has created a wine that's loaded with character that's a thrill to sip and goes nicely with the grilled-to-perfection Lamp Chops, or the succulent Guajillo Chile Pork Ribs, or even some carvings from the renown black Iberian pig, Jam√≥n Ib√©rico - this is as close to culinary nirvana as one can get - the best part is you don't have to spend a fortune to get there.\\n\\nWhen you think the treasure hunt for your OMG experience couldn't get any better, guess what, it does. The 100% Tannat dessert wine from Uruguay's Vi√±edo de los Vientos is simply nectar from the gods.  Its honey-like texture with its aromas of wildflowers, Madagascan vanilla bean, and a touch of white chocolate makes this unique wine ecstasy in a glass.  Either the freshly made Churros served with a warm dark chocolate sauce or the divine dulce de leche Crepas Salguero will surely seal the deal. We may not have embraced the style and grace of promenading here in ATL, but at least there is now a place to migrate with friends or soon to be friends and enjoy companionship while enjoying a slice of the good life - Barcelona Wine Bar style."},{"name":"Trident Booksellers & Caf√©","address":"338 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I tend to visit Trident about two Sundays a month for Brunch with girlfriends.

I wish I still could love it.  I love their book and magazine selection and they must have tiny wizards whipping up magically delicious dishes in the kitchen, BUT the service is terrible.  It was so terrible one time in fact, I wrote Trident a letter of complaint (below) and was promised a gift card. Much like the service during my last meal at Trident, they must have promptly forgotten about it.\\n///\\n\\"My friend and I are in love with your establishment.  You have a fantastic and varied book and magazine selection and the food your restaurant serves has always been stellar.  Until last Thursday (3/20/10).  My friend and I used to go to Trident twice a month to experience delicious food and books.  She now works outside of Boston and it's more difficult for us to get together at Trident.  We had been looking forward to another great time at Trident for 2 weeks.  Unfortunately, we came away from our meal hugely disappointed, and frankly weirded out by our server, who made the entire experience awkward and uncomfortable.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the Prosciutto & Melted Brie sandwich and I ordered the Cape Codder, both of which we have ordered before and both of which are delicious!  Or usually delicious I should say.  The first sign of trouble was immediately after my friend ordered her sandwich. Our waiter asked what kind of bread she wanted, and she replied, \\"What it usually comes on\\" then referred him to the menu which stated it came on a toasted French roll.  Our waiter seemed confused by this, and said \\"Oh whatever.  I don't know...\\" then trailed off.  I ordered my Cape Codder sandwich and was not asked what kind of bread I wanted, so I assumed it would come with the default bread, the grilled Challah. The waiter was so spacey we speculated he might be stoned.\\n\\nOur sandwiches arrived after over a half an hour wait, and both were served on wheat bread. My friend and I stared at our sandwiches for a few seconds, confused.  The crusts of my sandwich, usually my favorite part, were burnt.  My friend spoke up and said to our waiter,\\n\\"I thought this came on a french roll.\\" Our waiter stared blankly at us, uncomprehending, and muttered something that sounded like \\"Oh I don't know,\\" then walked away.\\n\\nAt this point, we admit, we should have spoken up again and expressed our dissatisfaction over the wheat bread.  But we were hungry.  We were willing to give Trident the benefit of the doubt because we do love it so much.\\n\\nOur server proceeded to make this impossible. He came up to us several minutes later, as if to ask us how our meal was, but all he did when he came to our table was stand there and STARE at us.  My friend and I both felt extremely uncomfortable.  Our server continued to stare for a few seconds, then turned abruptly and walked away.\\n\\nAt this point we were truly at a loss for how to respond.  Our server made one or two more awkward appearances in which we determined he was either on drugs, or so incredibly socially awkward that it was debilitating for him to interact normally with customers.\\n\\nWe asked for the check and to our surprise, saw that WHEAT BREAD had been specified as a change for both of our sandwiches.  Our fears were confirmed.  It had not been a miscommunication after all.  The waiter had intentionally asked our sandwiches to made with 2 thin slices of burnt wheat bread as opposed to the lofty and heavenly Challah bread and French roll.  My friend twice told him she wanted her sandwich on a French roll, even reading him the menu description.\\n\\nWe left feeling unsettled by our waiter's weird and off-putting behavior and unsatisfied with our sandwiches.  All in all, the beer was the best part of our meal.  Please, never stop serving Ipswich Oatmeal Stout.\\""},{"name":"Mango Thai","address":"115 Elm St","city":"West Newton","stars":"3.5","text":"I ordered delivery from here on a Sunday night.

Drinks came and then the server took our order...here is where it starts to get annoying.  Our appetizers finally came after 15ish minutes.  We then waited another 35 minutes for the main entrees.  A very long time in between the appetizer and main dish.  Our server did not ONCE come to see how we were doing.

Upon their invitation we happily obliged to an evening out on the town made all the more enjoyable by the food at Ruth's and our kind, attentive server, Mary. \\n\\nWe all loved our beverages and throughout the meal tasted roughly half of the beverage menu. (Don't judge.) Standouts - Grapefruit Greyhound, Coconut Ginger Lemon Drop Martini, Mojitos in Blueberry and Raspberry.\\n\\nThe bread and whipped butter were fresh and fantastic, a great way to pacify our rumbling tummies while we said our hello's and sipped our drinks to come down off a long day's work and moderately hectic Uber trip to the restaurant. \\n\\nFor starters we ordered the Fried Calamari and Crispy Lobster Tail. The calamari was a welcome departure from the typical side of marinara go-to or Rhode Island style - it was lightly coated and deep fried then drizzled with a delicious \\"sweet and spicy Asian Chili sauce.\\" The lobster, however, was a disappointment and my only complaint from the entire experience at RC. Our friends insisted we get it as they've had it many times and couldn't rave about it enough. When it came out to the table, one of them immediately said \\"That doesn't look right.\\" And it wasn't. The lobster tail was battered and fried while still in the shell, then doused in their spicy cream sauce. This made it extremely messy and laborious to eat, and the frying-while-in-the-shell caused the meat to stick to the shell which meant that we each got a few measly shreds of lobster off our pieces before exhaustion and disappointment struck. The flavor was there, but the shell was too, which sucked. Our buddies told us that in the past, the tail was shelled and fried in bite-sized chunks. One of them commented on this to the waitress, who agreed and mentioned saying something to the chef about it in the past. I really hope the restaurant and chef take into consideration the opinion of guests and people eating the food when moving forward with this dish. To pay so much for an upscale experience and then receive a plate like the lobster tail we got last night was a little disheartening. \\n\\nMoving onward, and away from the negativity above, our main course came sizzling across the dining room much to our excitement. I ordered the petite filet - plenty big for one person. The other orders at the table were petite rib-eye, petite filet with shrimp, and sea bass. All were amazing, flavorful, and cooked perfectly to our likings.\\n\\nFor sides we ordered the hash brown cake, lobster mac and cheese, and creamed spinach. The hash brown cake was fantastic - a skillet patty of hash browns, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, topped with cheese, sour cream, bacon, and scallions. It was delicious, cooked to perfection, and appropriately salted (something I find to be quite rare these days). The lobster mac and cheese was a little runny for my taste, but the flavor was decent. The lobster definitely had a presence, large chunks strewn liberally throughout. The creamed spinach was, well, creamed spinach. Nothing notable or out of this world.\\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered the cheese cake which everyone loved. Mary, our server, brought out a complimentary lava cake which is my all time fave dessert ever, so I graciously devoured as much as I could before distension set in. We really appreciated the complimentary dessert, whether it was just to be nice or to make up for the Lobster Tail let down we really don't know. \\n\\nAll in all, the meal was fantastic and the 2.5 hours spent there was well worth it. I would also like to note that with the length of our visit we were never rushed to leave or made to feel as if we were there for too long.\\n\\nAs with most steak houses in the city, you'll be opening your wallet a bit to dine here.

It was my first theme park ever, And I make it a point to visit at least one every 2-3 years. Although It is a fun and entertaining park for families, if you haven't been there in awhile, you might find yourself severely dissapointed with what has been cut from this park.\\n\\nThe Good:\\n\\nFun, family centric rides: Unlike Islands of Adventuire, Universal Studios deosn't have any rollercoasters, making it perfect for families without iron stomachs. Though some of the rides can get intense at times, none of them are really thrilling or scary.\\n\\nLots of movie magic: This place has rides inspired by movies like The Mummy, Jaws and ET, so there's something everyone can relate to.\\n\\nThe Bad:\\n\\nWhat happened??: OK, here's where I'm going to complain. What happened to King Kong?? That was this place's signiture ride for YEARS. I remember when my mom worked here it was on their NAMETAG, that's how crucial it was. Equally heartbreaking was the cut of the Hanna Barbera attraction and the Ghostbusters show. Oh, the saddness. Does anyone know if they are still doing the horror make-up show?? If that was cut I am so going to pieces. \\n\\nUniversal Studios is definitely worth a visit, and if you have never been there before you won't be dissapointed.

The decor is funky and fun, though there is a large picture of a woman in a skirt, who's legs you have to go through to get to the bathroom--a little weird.\\n\\nAs I mentioned, the hostess was sweet but our waitress was a little standoffish and slow, given that the restaurant wasn't full.  We started out with the bread and avocado spread appetizer which was delicious, with soft bread with a hearty crust and a tasty spread with just enough flavor.\\n\\nMy friend enjoyed her artichokes, but felt that her salmon was dry. I loved the wild mushroom saute, which had just the right amount of garlic. The star of our table was the scallops in saffron cream sauce. The scallops were well cooked and the sauce was creamy with just a hint of tang from the saffron. We found ourselves sopping up the sauce with bread after the scallops were gone. \\n\\nLike many people tapas initially seems expensive to me as I look through menus, but the wonderful, strong flavors and small portions are really just right for a well-rounded meal.

So here we have a place that might specialize in more \\"common\\" Chinese fare, and not just General Gau's Chicken.\\n\\nI got the Roast Duck Noodle Soup--generally only available in Chinatowns (and Allston's Super 88)--Crispy Dry Pepper Shrimp and \\"Small Pork Dun.\\" The soup was delicious--a richly spiced broth with remarkably large servings of duck. Unfortunately, because this is takeout, the noodles and veggies were soggy. The shrimp was also yummy--more flavorful than I had expected from a straight-up dry fry. They also left the shells on, which I actually enjoy. The marinated mushrooms were also a pleasant addition.\\n\\nThe pork duns were just standard Chinatown pork dumplings. A bit expensive, but yummy in my soup and tummy. \\n\\nSo, yeah, I think it's good, and I will definitely order again the next time I get delivery.

It gets better (sarcastic tone inserted), while he was carrying our pizza to the table, he was on his cell phone walking towards us. Pizza in one hand, cell phone in the other. It knocked the caliber of him and the restaurant down a billion points in my eyes. He then never bussed our plates or the wing plate off the table, and then asked if we wanted fresh plates, when I said yes, he seemed annoyed. Even when he brought the second plates, he never cleared our first plates or refilled our drinks, which were empty by now.  I had to- and I took a picture because it was so ridiculous( I may post it)- I had to stack up all our plates and lined the empty cups on the side of the table for him to notice that we needed more drinks. He was busy talking on his cell phone and cleaning the floor. He left a huge pile of stuff he was sweeping right I front of our table. He then came over and asked how everything was and if he could box the pizza? We told him we were still working (clearly) on the pizza and I asked him for refills of water. An he replied \\" a what?\\". Then he brought me another water with no straw, put my two dirty glasses In front of my face and said, \\"did you need one of your straws?\\" Ugh. Is this kid serious? When we were done he brought a box over and placed it on our pizza stand and said \\" did u want dessert or coffee or anything like that?\\" (So unprofessional sounding.) When we declined he walked away smiling that we weren't staying longer. \\n\\nManagement: Since I forgot to get his name from the check I called to find out the servers name. The manager was completely unprofessional, I told him I was just in there and had asked for my servers name. He responded \\" why? What happened?\\" In an ungenuine tone. I said \\"nothing I just wanted his name.\\" He said \\" um, John.\\" He was very detached from hospitality and I can see why the service was so horrible there. Trickled from the top I guess.\\n\\nFood: the food was absolutely delicious as always from bertuccis. Aside from not getting rolls. It's a shame that the poor service overpowered the food.\\n\\nOverall: I will NOT be back to this location, and I will tell all my friends not to go there.

The scent was very annoying (on our visit, at the host stand)  and I remembered wondering why...so many people are allergic to scents and it makes you think, oh, there must be some really bad smell they are trying to hide (worst trick at open houses). I had the celery root soup and enjoyed it very much. My DC got the pozole that was highly recommended by the server. It was horrible. The corn itself was obviously from a can and had not been sufficiently rinsed. A bad chemical, tin, off taste. My DC did not finish it and the server did not ask if he had liked it, just took it away. It is not worth anywhere near $14.  The broth and pork had none of the depth of a good Pozole, but I do have a lot of experience making it myself.\\n\\nWe were the only patrons and the music was intolerably loud. We asked if it could be turned down and it was, just a very tiny bit.\\n\\nMy DC had tried the burger on our previous visit and found it unappealing and overpriced. He did eat it.

Their quiches (comes with a side salad), stuffed bread (comes with a side salad), pizzas, special sandwiches, and soups (comes with a piece of bread) change daily. Check the website before you head in... they also display them on a small board on the side wall and on the wall above the baked goods. From their sandwich standards, the roast beef with crispy onion strings and grilled portobello are my tried and true standbys. I've also taken home quarts of their stews for dinner that they keep in the front case. Super hearty and great for a full meal. There are always vegan/vegetarian/nut-free options, but they're a little light on the gluten-free. \\n\\nThe staff is friendly and they've got hustle but most of the items do take some time since they're made to order.

There are two distinct areas in the restaurant, the main dining room, and the bar area. Both are amazing, and will be covered in the review. The main difference is that the bar tends to be a bit louder, but it's a nice and lively environment. \\n\\nFood: Chef Maws and the entire kitchen crew do an amazing job taking local (and high quality, seasonal, organic) products and giving them a new American twist. They also show their \\"nose to tail\\" philosophy by serving both pigs tails (in a spicy nuoc cham sauce) and a 1/2 pigs head for 2 people. The burger is one (if not the) best in Boston. Sides of bone marrow appear as massive bones split length-wise with plenty of Iggy's bread. Having eaten at the bar several times, as well as a la carte and tasting menu in the dining room, I've never been disappointment by anything.\\n\\nDrinks: Let's start with beer, being the most straightforward. The selection is small, but very well selected, and rotates frequently. You will probably find some local brews, along with some European brethren. Wine, the wine list is very well selected, and has many odd/funky bottles from areas that are lesser known (try the Philippe Bornard \\"Tant Mieux\\" with the pig head). Now lets get to the cocktails, Craigie is a restaurant that I would go purely for the drinks. Get a seat at a bar, and chat up one of the bartenders. Much like the food, I've never been disappointed by any drinks. If I'm at the bar, I'll usually ask for drinks that pair with whatever I've ordered. \\n\\nAtmosphere: The bar is busy, but never overly so. It gets lively, and with enough people enjoying themselves it can get a little noisy. The dining room is calmer, and a little more upscale without being stuffy. Everyone is very friendly and accommodating, service is very professional with still being friendly. It is also fun to peer inside the open kitchen. \\n\\nFinal Thought: A must try! Go to the bar with a friend and get a burger and drinks. If you are looking for a special occasion dinner, Craigie should be at the top of your list!"},{"name":"Pio Pio Restaurant","address":"5803 Precision Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Overall:  Great Peruvian restaurant with a friendly staff and even better food.

I'm at bars at least 4 times a week and took a colleague here on a Monday evening for dinner.  We ordered two beers to start.  After that we waited...and waited...and waited for the bartender to possibly ask us if we needed anything or wanted to place an order.  We timed it and it was approximately 35 minutes where we literally received no attention at all, and I got the motivation to actually complain.  \\n\\nMy colleague and I overheard a diner sitting next to us complain to his companions about the bartending service.  We also heard him bark out commands to one of the bartenders.  We thought this diner was being rude, but after our being ignored for so long, we completely understood his perspective.  \\n\\nMy colleague and I were starting to get quite hungry, and we were getting no attention at all from the bartenders, that I asked a waiter serving tables if he could get us something to eat.  I looked over and the bartender was just staring at me, doing absolutely nothing.  The manager finally came over, but it was just too late -- my frustration got the best of me and I declined any further service from Row 34.  I asked for my tab and prepared to leave.\\n\\nThe bartender ultimately gave me my tab and didn't even apologize -- he just stared at me.  I walked away to leave and on the way out, one of the waiters was apologetic and gracious, which I really appreciate.  Then i looked to the bartender again, just staring at me, as if almost to intimidate.  In my world (at least) the main priority of a bartender's job is to service your customers, not be a tough guy.  \\n\\nIt was a real embarrassment for me to choose Row 34 and be treated with such bad service.  Although I didn't get to experience the food, the interior of Row 34 is beautiful.  It seems like a nice place to entertain, but at the moment, don't do so at the bar.

She got a free cup of Kheer since it was her first time, the stuff is addicting, rich creamy sweet, couldn't stop eating it! The dosas are huge and very filling, two people can share. My husband can't get enough of the lamb vindaloo, but his most recent favorite is the lamb poritchathu, the sauce and spices are amazing! I always keep coming back to the chicken xacuti (coconut curry) or the koorma (mild curry), but have had a few of the vegetarian dishes and they are just as delicious (love the baby eggplant and okra dishes). Dinner entrees come with rice only, which is fine by me because the portions are generous (we usually have leftovers for lunch next day).

King Bao has a delicious assortment of baos (or chinese bun sandwiches) in their menu. On my first visit I tried the following:\\n\\nHogzilla - pork belly goodness with pickled carrots, daikon, peanuts and cilantro. I suggest adding a pinch of siracha to counterbalance the sweetness of the meat and peanuts. \\n\\nKickin Chicken - kimchi fried chicken, siracha aioli and scallions. I did not expect this one to be my favorite, but it was! For my next trip, I will order at least 2 of these because 1 was not nearly enough.\\n\\nGlen Rhee Bao - Korean short ribs, asian pear salsa and cilantro. Being a huge fan of Korean style meats, this was a no brainer. I loved the pear salsa in this bao because it added an acidity yet sweet element to the short ribs, which can be quite rich and meaty.\\n\\nOrdering from the specials allows customers to get a fair pricing on menu items. Though I will have to say, maybe I have the appetite of a 6'9 tall basketball player (trust me, far from it), but 3 baos were BARELY enough to get me full for lunch. I think 4 baos for me would have done the trick. \\n\\nMy biggest complaint is the parking situation. As in, there is none. Street parking is all you've got, and if you're in a quick hurry, perhaps parking in a nearby establishment's parking lot would be fine (though I'm not sure how many parking rules that would break). \\n\\nOverall, a great addition to the Mills 50 dining scene.

Seaweed salad doesn't cost you extra here and most things are as much as you want. They have some interesting topping options like pineapple, tempura flakes and such. The fish looks fresh, though I feel like despite getting 4 scoops, doesn't feel like that much. That said all the sides will make your box huge and filling. So my box ended up as brown rice, spring mix, cucumber, seaweed salad, crab salad, 2 salmon, 2 ahi tuna, pineapple, cilantro, edamame, furikake, tempura flakes. That's hefty yet healthy.

Room enough for a huge 360 fireplace, dart alley, pool table, 2 shuffleboards, and 3 ping pong tables in addition to lots of both seating and a long-ass bar. Sweet!  How many bars have ping pong? Um, zero.  \\nI've been here twice - both times during the weekday afternoon when patrons were few.  Both times we received bad service from the female bartender. She looked completely disinterested in her job much less serving us.  I've been a bartender for a few years and never liked the day shift, but also knew that's when the regulars come in. Always take care of the regulars.  They don't always tip well, but bring you business and define your hospitality. \\nThe first time we bellied-up to the bar.  My cocktail spent more time empty then full.  The conversation with the bartender was cold, but the owner stepped in at one point and was very warm and eager to engage.  I ordered the tater tots with cheese and some other stuff. It was pretty good.  The second time I brought 2 other friends who had never been there.  They were impressed with the space and amenities.  I ordered a pitcher of beer, from the same bartender. She was kind enough to come out to the ping pong tables to serve us, but actually walked away as I was giving my order. That was rude.  When she returned I had to stop her again from jetting away, so I could order some food.  The quesadilla took FOREVER.  It took so long that we had already finished our pitcher of beer, and had to get the quesadilla to go because we had other plans. I still left a 20% tip, but got a chilly good bye from the bartender. In fact she turned her back to the bar as we passed by. Didn't even get a generic \\"Thanks for coming in.\\"    \\nI will return to this place because it's such a cool spot, but will probably try a different time than afternoon happy hour to avoid that bartender. \\nI heard from the owner that the weekends are packed. He also said they're trying to expand to include space for more ping pong table for tournaments. That would make it even more unique."},{"name":"Dog Town Food Cart","address":"2880 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow!

Our favorite of the 2 dogs was the Rocky Balboa, but not by much.  This was our first time having Poutine fries, so I can't compare it to others, but it was delicious.

We had a reservation and arrived early.  We enjoyed a drink at a table outside and waited for our table.  The location is great and design of the restaurant is very nice both inside and out although it was VERY loud inside the restaurant.  \\n\\nBest part of the meal was the appetizer.  It was a mozzarella, tomato and prosciutto dish with a very good balsamic sauce.  They also have a very good wine list.\\n\\nThe rest of the meal was disappointing.  I got a short rib dish which was a special that night.  The dish was average but for $40 I expected more. My girlfriend got a lobster pasta dish with a red sauce but when it arrived the lobster was still in the shell.  It appeared they tried to crack the shells to make it easy to get the meat out but they were not cracked enough so it had to be sent back.  \\n\\nThe most disappointing part of the meal was when I asked for a side of pasta with red sauce, because I didn't really like the sauce that came with my dish.  I was given a small bowl (the size of a cereal bowl) half filled with pasta.  They charged us $12 for that.  I was a little surprised they charged us at all for it but when I saw it was $12 I was shocked.

I've never liked cheese pizza... until I had a slice of Pino's. Since that day, I've always gotten their two slices of cheese+soda combo. One day, I decided to switch it up and get a slice of their veggie. LOVED IT! So now, I always sit there wondering if I am in the mood for their veggie or for their cheese. I also loveee their steak and cheese sub. They customize it exactly the way I like it and I love it. I am a petite little girl, but I have finished their entire steak and cheese sub (ok fine, I got the smaller size...) and a (huge) slice of their cheese pizza in one sitting.
