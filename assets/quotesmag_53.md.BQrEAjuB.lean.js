She brought me two samples which were not my favorite so I was deciding on another bottle and thought to order arancini in the meantime. She said she would give us a few minutes to decide and was nowhere to be seen for about 15 minutes. The arancini thankfully came in the meantime to give us something to start on because we were starving. They were so so bland, literally flavorless. The red sauce that came with it was also bland and very thin. Disappointing because it is my favorite Italian appetizer. \\n\\nWe finally tracked our waitress down to order a wine bottle and decided to ask for recommendations for entrees. I ordered fettuccini Alla Romana (with chicken instead of ham) and two meatballs on the side because I was dying to try their fresh pasta. My husband ordered the gnocchi with a side of parmesan risotto because he couldn't decide. \\n\\nWe were sitting there without wine (or anything else on the table) for a very long time and finally flagged down our waitress to get some bread. It had just come out of the oven and was delicious with the consistency of French bread (not what I expected at an Italian restaurant but very good). \\n\\nAbout an hour after being in the restaurant, we finally got our entrees. The fettuccini with chicken was ok. The peas in the dish were actually what gave it the flavor. My husband's gnocchi looked like a small portion but was plentiful. Unfortunately the gnocchi was bland and the risotto was very al dente and didn't impress. The meatballs were ok (I always look forward to meatballs).\\n\\nAt this point, we skipped the dessert menu and decided to call it a night and go elsewhere for dessert. We had seen the tiramisu portion served at the table next to us and it was pretty small anyway so it didn't seem appealing.\\n\\nWe really wanted to like it as it was recommended to us and had great reviews.

The soup was exceptional and just the right amount. I also added the duck potatoes, and they were just okay.  One of my companions had the burger and it looked delicious plus the presentation was just what you want for a burger and fried.  Other companion had the traditional Eggs Benedict which looked good but the plate seemed lacking to me in color.  Just looked rather bland.

The drinks were strong, not watered down, just how I like them!  And, as others have indicated, we received a box of holiday chocolates after we paid.

I was excited to try out their concept after hearing about it for the entire semester. Supposedly it is named Pie Five because you can have your very one personal pizza in under 5 minutes. Well My pizza took over 20 mins. I ordered the chicken alfredo and added a few more toppings and also had their ultimate brownie dessert pizza. All was well and I paid at the register and waited. They then told me my pizza had to go back in the oven because it did not finish cooking yet. So i stepped to the side and continued waiting while my  brownie pizza was still at the register already on the tray.The next few customers continued paying over my brownie pizza and talking on it. I finally dove in and rescued it but I did not find it appetizing anymore after people were all over it.  After several more minutes, the guy takes out the pizza and shows it to two other girls, everyone takes turns poking it and then he finally comes and tells me they have to re-do it all over again. I am told to sit down and they will bring it to me when its done. I sit and wait 10 more mins. It finally comes and the guy apologizes. I give them 3 stars because the guy working there was nice and apologized about it. I also liked that he must have seen something wrong with my pizza and he took the time to re-do it instead of just serving it to me. I appreciate that. Now for the taste: after finally getting my pizza,at first bite it was good, but I felt it was too doughy and tasted a bit undercooked. The toppings just slid off with my cheese. But overall it wasn't bad but not the best pizza I've had. The concept itself seems really cool. If they improve I might visit again."},{"name":"Barlata Tapas Bar","address":"1500 S Lamar Blvd, Ste 150","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Happy Hour Review: Highly anticipated visit - L.O.V.E. tapas!\\n[HH Sun-Thurs 5-7PM; discounted food & drinks]\\n\\nCould have easily been a 4 or even 5 star rating IMHO due to the nice atmosphere, good HH prices on food and drink ($4 Estrella Damn Beer), and the quality and presentation of the traditional (albeit ultra simple and hard to screw up) tapas such as a bowl of olives and Catalan toast...and the off HH menu Baby Squid stuffed with fennel sausage covered in a wonderful squid ink sauce creatively served in a sardine-like can (this is a MUST try if venturing to Barlata; absolutely fantastic!)...however, my overall positive impression quickly decreased for TWO reasons:\\n\\n1. The last item that was transported to the counter bar I was sitting at was the HH paella. I must premise this WAS the HH paella, so no I was not expecting a steaming, crispy rice bottom paella platter to be delivered (however, after scanning several other reviews I failed to noticed many people raving about any of Barlata's paella - so sad!), but oh my f..........! The stench of rancid seafood immediately slapped me in the face harder than any contender in a smack-o-thon contest could have. Not just \\"fishy\\" - B.A.D. - as in \\"don't eat that!\\" I tried a tiny bite of rice and the flavor from the assorted seafood was revolting enough to make me gag. I'm not exaggerating. A Yelp \\"no-no\\" is to state \\"I really wanted to like this,\\" but I really wanted to like this. Such a huge disappointment after having a pretty good experience up until then.   \\n2. The bartender did notice the look on my face, she did apologize and proceeded to take it away without any request on my part, offered to take the charge off the bill (which she did), but then when I explained my possible health concerns to her for others, Lisa replied \\"nobody else has complained.\\" Hhrrrrmmmm. \\n\\nAnother must mention, I am a bit suspicious of the braised \\"oxtail.\\" While yummy, it tasted more like pot roast than any other tail I've had before...and I've had a lot of tail; both at home and in restaurants. It was served off the bone (which is fine), but didn't have the same deep flavor and almost gelatinous texture oxtail typically does (at least in some bites). Hmm...just an interesting side note. No finger pointing. \\n\\nOverall: If in the area, I would certainly return for HH drinks (Lisa was very friendly all the way through service despite her blas√© comment) and order a Jamon y Queso, and most definitely the Squid in a Can, but nothing more exciting than that.

Some of us had the Peach Wood Smoked Turkey and the other had the Hot Ham and Cheese. The sandwiches come with a petite salad, and trust me - it's pretty dang petite. As in, there is a sprinkling of some green leaves next to your sandwiches (I didn't count, but it couldn't have been more than 5 spinach leaves). We coughed up cash monies for a side of fries, and companion commented, \\"For $6, that's the saddest bowl of fries.\\" (See picture as proof).

Honestly my expectations were incredibly low because their crappy \\"korean bbq\\" that was taken over by it. \\n\\nSo was it good? Surprisingly..... not bad. You can switch up sauces every order you make. I prefer mala and cajun. lemon pepper was awfully bland. Mala was pretty spicy in their \\"spicy\\" level and has the standard mala flavors. Cajun was just okay. Definitely not the best ever but its good enough but not so spicy. I would probably pick the \\"on fire\\" option for that.\\n\\nYou would think the people from hot pot buffet would notice what's popular right now and try to make their own version of that because it seems like a money pit. cut corners like.... idk, use hot dogs instead of sausages? but honestly, no, they didnt stoop this low. It actually seems legitimate and did their best efforts to make classic cajun seafood. \\n\\nAs for the items itself, the quality is much better than i thought. The quality is probably the same, if not, better than the common seafood boil places people probably been to. Take a look at the menu, quite a selection. My favorite was the top clams, green mussels, shrimp and quail eggs. They also have other items that arent so common like beef tendon, tripe, pork skin and more. \\n\\nService seems average, staff just doing their job. It looked like there's only 1 cook so we might of waited a bit longer in between orders but not awfully long. Only complaint is that ordering seasonal mussels, we came across tainted ones. but found maybe 3/10? Not worth a huge fuss because no one ever knows how seafood comes in when shipped. \\n\\nIs this the best seafood boil ever? not even close but it would definitely satisfy any seafood craving and as a buffet, this is more than worth it and best bang for your buck."},{"name":"The Ravenous Pig","address":"565 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"Had high hopes for this gastropub. Wanting it to be on a level with the Breslin or spotted pig in Nyc but it wasn't. The food was good and the atmosphere and service was what you'd expect. Issues I had was mainly 2 things: the price for the value. Then the menu itself. I always hate when you go to a restaurant and read this unbelievable description of a entree, or appetizer, and when it comes out you're just underwhelmed. Or when they overprice cheap proteins. I ordered the pork belly app. It was $16 with Corn bread made with rendered foi to accompany it - sounded amazing. However once it arrived I was disappointed. I got one tiny slice of pork belly (not an expensive piece of meat mind you) and cornbread CRUMBLES. The value for the price was NOT worth it. Then the steak and the burger came. Tiny steak for $28. With no real unique preparation (which is fine for a steak) but the value wasn't there. A ny strip isn't even an expensive cut and they only give you 7 oz. The truffle fries that came with them were way too SALTY and lacked any real hint of truffle flavor (not even the cheap truffle flavor most places pour over things). Burger was good and cooked to order- decent value for the type of meat they used- however they put too much blue cheese on it which kind of overwhelmed all the other flavors. Value was so so for it and pretty much forgettable. The whole menu really lacked a gastro feel. Not many gastro-ish options. Lots of buzz word ingredients but if my pork belly was any indication I highly doubt they'd add enough to really build up that flavor profiles. The dessert menu pretty much seem phoned in with nothing really novel or worth the price.

Preserved pear and fennel jam were great, the arugula salad was fresh and the grilled bread which was nicely toasted, imparted with a smokey wood grilled flavor. 6 dollars, a steal.\\n\\nPetite filet: 13 bucks for a four ounce filet with Yukon smashed potatoes. To put that into perspective a 6 filet with two sides is $33. I really felt like I was robbing them now. There was a tad more char(it was NOT burnt) on the steak that I care for but it was a perfect med rare and full of beefy flavor goodness. The potatoes were a touch on the gummy side but still very good and at this price point the meal was ridiculously good\\n\\nThe service: friendly and professional, drinks were strong but not zombifying and also fairly priced"},{"name":"Granny's Tacos","address":"1401 E 7th St","city":"Austin","stars":"5","text":"Quality of the food is really good.

First off, the mini wonton soup refers to the size of the wontons (which contain literally no meat) rather than the size of the bowl. When I ordered, I thought maybe a smaller bowl or the entire wonton itself is smaller (smaller wrap but still decently filled) but I was completely wrong. Both the noodle soups were very bland, I would highly recommend NOT ordering either. The (smaller than average) XLB and pan fried baos are made to order so they took a really long time to arrive. We had already finished our noodle soups, and sat waiting for about 10min, before the pan fried baos came. And after another 20min of the pan fried baos arriving, the xlb came. Not to mention, our vinegar was forgotten, as well as our drink order and my tea was not refilled throughout the dinner (and it's only Thursday too).

A female friend was being kicked out by security, and had I not seen her being physically pushed out, no one in the group would have known where she was. They didn't give her a chance to get a friend, her phone, purse or coat, which would have left her in the pouring rain without a way to contact anybody or get herself a ride. This is a huge safety issue as if they decide somebody is too intoxicated to stay there, how is it then safe to throw them out without notifying anyone they came with, phone, money or identification? A male friend of ours got involved and was kicked out as well, and we were fine with leaving but needed to retrieve our belongings from inside. Long story short, for some reason a bouncer ended up tackling my male friend to the ground. Considering he is only 5' 6\\", 160lb, he is not threatening in nature nor was he being dangerous in any way. He didn't fight back but the bouncer stayed on top of him for several seconds. Not sure what sort of physical take-down training the bar bouncers there get, but it was inappropriate and excessive. He was bruised but lucky to not have any further injuries. Anyways I emailed the bar about my safety concerns, and was pleased to get a quick response from someone, with the promise of head of security getting in touch. Several days after she said security was going to call, I emailed to check in since I hadn't been contacted. That led to a call and voicemail from the owner of the security company, so I called back and left him a message - it's now been over a week and no word back. I am disappointed that despite a quick response at first, there was no follow through, and my friends and I do not feel safe returning.

I wasnever a huge fan of the quesadilla but the braised pork was very tender and flavorful. I liked that it was not  overloaded with cheese. My husband's favorite was the chicken flautas because the meat was perfectly seasoned and it went well with the queso fresco and fresh guacamole.

Upon entrance  it was a long sleek  clean  and kind of dark  restaurant . Looks good for a date . The server was very courteous and attentive and greeted us on arrival. I ordered a hot sake and my husband ordered a beer and we all ordered hot tea. I decided to try the dinner bento box since my Groupon had to be used for dinner. It came with teriyaki chicken white rice gyoza, veggie spring roll, a harumaki, tempura shrimp and vegetables, miso soup. Lots of food for $24. I decided to share with my son. My husband got the seafood soup along with the lunch shrimp tempura Bento which came with edamame, sushi, and rice, and harumaki. When you get a box you can get a choice of either white rice, fried rice, or brown rice. My daughter decided to get the tuna tataki along with a miso soup and a order of the tofu steak. The food took a little long to come out but I figured it was because they're making it fresh. The Miso soup came out first along with the seafood soup and it was all very delicious. The soup was better than most places I've gone to. All of our food came and it was all tasty. I can't find a fault with any of it. I have to say that fried tofu was especially tasty and the sauce was terrific. The tempura was all crisp and delicious. We will certainly be back here because it was everything right with our experience and nothing wrong. We did not get any rolls which we will do next time because there was a lobster roll on the menu that looks fantastic. Great spot"},{"name":"Hot Pot Buffet","address":"70 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is a no frills, unlimited hot pot buffet that is straight and to the point.  It is meant to make you full!  Also, this place provides the concept of an unlimited hot pot at a great price (around $23 for dinner!)!  \\n\\nYou have a choice between a spicy and non-spicy based broth and you are given a paper where you mark all the items you want to get.  There is a wide variety of beef, chicken, seafood, vegetables, eggs, and noodles to choose from to satisfy your taste buds.  Since you cook the food in the pot yourself, it does not take a long time to obtain your food.  However, I have noticed that if you order a lot, they may not give you less orders than what you indicated, as they are afraid that you will not finish all the food.  However, this is easily remedied by just ordering more once you realize they dropped off most of the food.  You will not be going through all that food right away anyways.  \\n\\nIf you are new to the concept of hot pot, much of the meat is thinly sliced, especially the beef.  You can just get your piece of beef and just soak it in the broth for a very short amount of time and it's cooked.  Seafood and meats like chicken take longer to cook so they have to be in the pot for a longer amount of time.  I've only been here for dinner, where apparently meat like rib-eye and additional seafood items are added.\\n\\nOverall, service has not been bad here and the wait times are tolerable during peak hours (I have at worst waited maybe 20 minutes for a table).  However, what you should do is have a group be dropped off to reserve the table while the driver looks for parking.  What is unfortunate is that parking is hard to find here, so if you want a free spot somewhere, you will likely have to work for it.  \\n\\nAnd finally since this is for hot pot, a group outing for this is best!"},{"name":"Bell Street Burritos","address":"112 Krog St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"The grilled burrito!!!!!

The website encouraged using Uber or Lyft, but there's always paid parking at the decks in Atlantic Station. It was open at 11:00am for VIP, and 12:00pm for general admission. Lasted until 5:00pm. \\n\\nTickets: General admission ranged from $15-25 depending on when you bought it, the sooner the cheaper. It allowed entry and one food ticket of your choice from the vendors. You can pay an additional $3 cash to the vendors for additional food tickets. VIP tickets ranged from $65-75, and got you 3 food tickets, in addition to access to the VIP only tent which has its own separate vendors. You then have unlimited servings inside the tent, which includes alcoholic drinks.\\n\\nThe restaurants on this year's bill: DBA Barbeque, Another Broken Egg, Oy!, High Road Craft Ice Cream, Sarah Donuts, Nana G's Chicken and Waffles, Two Urban Licks, Atlanta Breakfast Club, Einstein's, Dish Dive, Dominic's NY Pizza, Pig & The Pearl, Delights By Dawn, Bar Margot, Nezdas, Warren City Club, Corner Cafe, Apres Diem, Chick-A-Biddy, Pallookaville Fine Foods, Queen of Cream Ice Cream, The Nook, Buckhead Diner, Eclipse de Luna, Highland Tap, King of Pops, Ormsby's, Richard's Southern Fried, Sweet Aubrn BBQ, and US Foods. \\n\\nExperience: I was lucky enough to win a pair of VIP tickets, and without these, I think I would have had a bad time. The first hour was definitely my favorite. Gates opened on time, and we barely had to wait a few minutes to get in. Once inside, we got a free plastic cup to use for our unlimited drinks in the VIP tent. You had a choice from a mimosa, beer & wine, or cocktails. Mimosa was tasty, and the vodka-margarita was nice too, albeit a little too sweet. I made my way to food items and was able to sample 5-6 things in under 15 minutes. These were pretty great! Kudos to Southern Bistro for their \\"Mongolian Bacon\\" and \\"She Crab\\", and the brisket from The Smoke Ring. \\n\\nAlready halfway full, I made my round of the vendors outside. \\n\\n- The Bacon Glazed Doughnut from Bar Margot was dry, and looked better than it tasted. \\n- Coffee Chip flavor from Queen of Cream was amazing! \\n- US Food's Congee and Bulgogi Bacon was also awesome! \\n- My last dish of the day was the Thai Coffee Doughnut Sandwich from Doughnut Dollies, and it was a great way to close things out. \\n\\nNon-food vendors I enjoyed: \\n\\n- Roadie: a delivery service that works like the rideshares. You got swag for signing up and downloading their app. Actually would be useful in town, as they charge by the mile. \\n- Atlanta United FC: you could play beer pong (sans beer) to win swag as well. I got a useful pair of sunglasses! \\n- Photo Bus: a photobooth in a bus, haha. You got 4 free poses inside, and there was cute props to use. They are a good service for parties or weddings. \\n- Buckhead Thread: a clothing and hat merchant, laid back guy, had some great Atlanta inspired designs. I got a shirt from him, and it was super soft. \\n\\nStaff Interaction: From the front gate people, to the police, to the VIP tent workers, everyone was energetic and friendly. I commend them for being able to work a long 6 hour+ shift with hundreds of people in their face. The website also was very well done. It had all the ticket breakdowns, an advanced look at the menu from all vendors, directions. \\n\\nWith all this, you're probably asking why only 3 stars? I had a better experience than that early on. But I came back around 3:00pm after leaving to shop for a while, and this looked like a mess. There were WAY too many people in there! Several businesses had already closed or were out of food. Thus, the remaining ones had super long lines. I wouldn't be surprised if you had to wait over 30-45 minutes just to get to the front. I can't imagine how fun that must be to wait that long, pay $3 and get a bite sized sample of food. Also by that time, it was more of the \\"festival\\" crowd than the \\"food\\" crowd, as people looked wasted and were stumbling around. I don't think it would have been worth the price of admission. \\n\\nI hope the next year has a higher gate price to deter people, or they cap it after a certain amount has been sold.

The last visit hit an all-time low; our empty dirty dishes and plates sat on our table for 30 minutes. We wanted to order more food, but nobody came by to check on us.

I ordered fries as a side, and it came with a tomato soup dipper (a small amount of soup) for the sandwich. The tomato soup was good, nothing extraordinary, but the melt was delicious! It didn't taste like what I expected a vegan patty to taste like, and the texture felt very \\"meaty.\\"\\n\\nWe also ordered the Mac The Knife which has smoked Gouda, mac n' cheese, and bacon. My husband ordered a side of tomato soup instead of the fries/soup dinner. \\n\\nEverything was really good, and the venue itself, although small, had a fun atmosphere to it.

The Philly cheesesteak has always been a comfort food for me. From my days in college to late night snacks after a night of partying. It has always been one of my favorite sandwiches. So when I found this place I was clearly excited. So here are the stats:\\n\\nPros: \\nDelicious Philly cheesesteaks AND Cuban sandwiches. Fresh chips to taste while you wait, mom and pop feel. Cozy and clean dining area. Nice staff, usually young adults ( teenagers, maybe early 20's ) manning the grill and cash register. They were really nice to my son and entertained his jokes. \\n\\nCons: They only take cash. \\n\\nThe only reason I am giving 4 stars is because they don't take any cards. There have been times that I really want a sandwich and I remember that I have no cash on me.... bummer. \\n\\nI have had the Philly and the Cuban, we also tried the fries this week, which are seasoned fries! Yum. They serve a pickle spear with every sandwich. They also have that huge jar of pickles on he counter! I'm a sucker for any place with a huge jar of pickles!  \\n\\nI really love the food at this place. But definitely not a place I can eat at every day.

I've been to Vij's a half dozen times now and I've always been impressed by their service, food quality and ambiance. \\n\\nFair warning: this is a popular restaurant with no reservations. They open at 5:30pm and a line is usually formed ahead of time. I've been there as early as 5:10pm and been 3rd in line and also 15th in line. So it all depends on the day. If you don't get in on the first wave of seating, or just don't want to eat an early bird meal, they've got ample seating in their lounge for you to hang out and wait. They even come by periodically and serve appetizers on a tray which is a nice touch. \\n\\nSome of my faves from the menu:\\n- Paneer, ginger, cilantro + garlic cakes in creamy tomato curry. This was delicious. Be prepared to dunk your naan in this delicious curry. \\n- Braised short ribs in fennel and mustard seed curry. Meat is so tender and the curry is a tasty complement. \\n- Wine marinated 'lamb popsicles' in fenugreek cream curry. A signature Vij dish and a must have. \\n\\nYou can get \\"small plates\\" which is roughly half the size of the regular plate. This is a good way to go if you want to sample more dishes and you don't have a big group. \\n\\nThey used to give you unlimited naan and basmati rice, but now they charge you $3 if you want more beyond your first serving. That's a little annoying, given the high price point of the entrees and how much naan and rice you're initially given with your entree.

This restaurant isn't for the financial faint of heart. Everything at Disney is overpriced and often not worth it ... But although this restaurant is at or above Manhattan steakhouse prices, it's completely worth it!\\n\\nI've been eating here since the late 1990s. It wowed back then and continues to wow to this day! The menu hasn't changed much nor has the atmosphere.\\n\\nMy meal consisted of the $40 hanger steak (very rare to find on any menu!), $16 mussels appetizer, and a side of crispy brussell sprouts. I wish I had room for the berry cobbler which is always a show stopper! I was a bit concerned that the hanger steak would not be good compared to the filet mignon or bison steak as those were $10-$12 more and the waiter kind of raised an eyebrow when I got the hanger steak. For those in the know the hanger steak is also called the 'butcher's steak' because it's so good the butcher usually keeps it for himself.\\n\\nIt was the best steak I ever had!!! There was a thin, salty crispy crust and the steak was perfect medium rare. The size was good ... About the size of a large 'steak tip'. It came with a grilled green onion which I'm not sure I understood.\\n\\nThe steak came with a side dish. At first I ordered the Mac and cheese. It tasted bland and the cheese was a bit clumpy. It also had an overwhelming taste of truffle oil. I returned it and instead got the crispy brussell sprouts which were an absolute pleasure and 100% we're what I'd choose again.\\n\\nMy mussels appetiser was the only miss of the night. The mussels were small and not meaty at all. There were 8-10 smaller mussels which was a bit dissapointing for the $16 price. They came in a cheap looking ceramic bowl (they used to be served in a silver container with a lid that was removed at the table to allow the aroma open up.) They were in a fairly acidic tomato soup stock and there were weird crumpled up toasted pieces of bread and lots of capers. The presentation of the dish down to the taste was a mistake.\\n\\nThey changed their bread which used to be a wonderful sourdough ... now it's a boring multi-grain. The salted butter is good though.\\n\\nThis restaurant I'd put up against any fine dining establishment. You'd never know it was a Disney restaurant. Great Pacific Northwest atmosphere. Great attentive and knowledgeable waiter service. The host is a bit pretentious but I suppose that's part of the schtick.\\n\\nTo make a reservation you have to put a non-refundable $10 deposit down.

At first glance and first impression it is a nice hotel. It's spacious, clean and quiet for the most part. They offer dining options inside as well as a Starbucks and ice cream place which was rumored to be amazing but I never got to try due to poor staffing. You get a complimentary drink pass to use during stay at the bar in the atrium. It was conveniently located right near the parks so that was a plus after our long days.\\n\\nThe rooms are spacious and cozy. They are on the more updated side considering that a lot of the hotels in the area are completely outdated in design and color scheme. The beds, pillows and sheets were very comfortable. The bathroom was spacious and had great counter space. Not a fan of tubs but all in all I was only there a few days. They offer room service for a fee and have food establishments inside the hotel. \\n\\nWe were only able to try the boardwalk restaurant but with that one dining place, we had seen enough. I would not recommend it at all. I suggest dining out, we ended up at yard house the next time instead. The menu is extremely limited and considering it's bar food, it's overpriced to start off with but it's an actual insult when you taste the food. We purposely ordered things that cannot possibly be messed up - burger with green beans as a side, chicken tenders with fries and chicken wings with fries. We also took a risk and ultimately a loss ordering a brie appetizer. The food was underwhelming at best, they had toppings but had zero flavor. None. The brie appetizer was terrible. I have ordered brie appetizer many times but this one was just inedible due to the mixture of flavors they had going on. The drinks, another story. The drinks ordered were already unremarkable and then a fruit fly just lay there lifeless swimming in the glass. Just not worth the expense at all.\\n\\nWe ordered room service breakfast for 3 with a side of hash browns and bacon not knowing [because it wasn't included in the description nor were we told by the person taking the order] that the dishes we were ordering already included hash browns in the first place. That breakfast totaled $83 and some change which i think is ridiculous for 2 breakfast sandwiches, eggs and bacon, hash browns and 3 extra strips of bacon. \\n\\nStarbucks is starbucks wherever you go, no surprise there. The ice cream place however had an extremely long line at all times and only ONE person staffed. You'd think after all their extra and hidden fees they'd have at least 2 people staffed there.\\n\\nThis hotel does charge for parking and is unclear of this at the time of booking which is a big no for me. They also charge for valet parking and do not communicate that either unless asked. They charge I believe it was $38 PER PARKING for valet which is an abusive amount of money for that service or $28 for their self parking. Meaning that everytime you bring your car to be parked by the valet, you'll be charged $38. Aside from the booking fee AND daily resort fee they do charge you more at the end. I ended up paying another $183ish upon check out. They require a card on file, I generally do not like placing any credit card anywhere so I gave my debit card only to find out they charge an extra $75 fee (I think per day) only because the card is a debit card.  I obviously had to give them the credit card after that. \\n\\nLastly, as per usual whenever I travel anywhere outside of miami, the staff is very...culturally ignorant. The awkward, \\"judgy\\" and unwelcoming glances I received by the staff were unnecessary. I generally have a strong character and brush these things off as I did not ask to speak to a manager or anything of the sort regarding the matter but I will mention them and talk about them as it is part of my experience that yelpers should know.\\n\\nBottom line:\\nWas my stay relaxing? While asleep, yes. Would I stay here again? No. I don't appreciate hidden fees and I don't think anyone does. I also don't appreciate when I'm paying for a service and people's ignorance overflows in a country founded by immigrants as is. Would I recommend it? No I would not either."},{"name":"McDonald's","address":"5170 Tuttle Crossing","city":"Dublin","stars":"2.5","text":"What is happening at this location?

By no means was it bad. It was just BLAND. I ordered a cheese calzone and even with the accompanying sauce, there just wasn't much flavor.

I wish they had a spicy sauce that you were allowed to sub in.

Even the meatballs could have used a boost. \\n\\nEverything was well-made. Pasta was cooked nicely, meatballs were a great texture, and the calzone was super crispy and loaded with cheese.

We had spent a really hard day at Mass General Hospital and were an hour and 45 minutes from home, it was 4:00 on a Thursday and traffic was horrible home and we were starving so I looked up restaurants nearby. We eat at Tavern in the Square in Northborough and Shrewsbury often and ADORE it, I have Celiac Disease and their gluten free menu is out of this world so when I saw how close it was to MGH we decided to go. I figure 4:00 on a Thursday they'll be minimal wait, when we arrive it's not too busy, put our name in (they refuse to give a time estimate for waiting, never had a restaurant do that it was bizarre) and are told there are only 2 people in front of us so it should be quick. 20 minutes later we are still waiting and a father and his son come in and place their names in and the boy has a sign saying it's first Bruins game and everyone loves it, he was super cute. We don't follow sports so we had no idea there was a game that night at TD garden across the street so Bruins fans start flooding in, during our wait the restaurant gets PACKED to the brim. It's now been over an hour we've waited to sit and after fasting all day for medical procedures I'm feeling ridiculously ill to the point of being sick if I don't eat soon. My husband goes up to ask how much longer, again they refuse to tell us any time but say we're next on the list. So we get excited and start watching for a table of two to leave and luck has it one gets up to go and we're dancing with excitement as the waiter cleans the table off, I see the hostess texting the table is ready so I start watching my phone knowing its our turn finally. Except the adorable boy with his sign and his father get taken before us. We get so caught off guard, we were just told it was our turn next we got there 20 minutes before them, what?? Now we've been together over 6 years and never have EITHER of us ever made a scene or asked for a manager were not THOSE kind of people. But my husband goes back to the front and asks hostess whats going on, why did they get taken before us? She so rudely responds to us and says \\"per managers request he wanted them seated first.\\" Now maybe another day or time I wouldn't have cared but after a really awful day medically with some hard stuff going on and not eating for a whole day I was furious. I understand he was super cute and it was his first game but how unfair to bump us because of that especially after us being told we were next. So we ask for the manager, I hate making a scene or making a fuss I get very embarrassed so I asked quietly. The rude hostesses proceed to get the manager and point like maniacs at us waving their hands around and making faces pointing at us. I was so embarrassed and feeling so sick. The manager makes his way over to us and we explain the situation, I apologize for making a fuss and say I understand how busy you are, we weren't aware it was a Bruins game tonight but we did come in almost 30 minutes before the rush of fans, we just left MGH and needed to eat before our long trip home. Now its been an hour and a half. The manager wasn't very helpful or apologetic to be honest but we did get a table about 5 minutes later. Because of my food allergies the manager ended up delivering my food to me so I had thought maybe he'd comp our 9$ wing appetizer or something to be apologetic or make us feel better for being treated poorly but nothing which was really disappointing. Honestly I wouldn't have written this review if any attempt at all had been made to make us happy. The waitress was great and of course we still left a 20% tip as always.

What a fun, flavorful, fantastic find!\\n\\nBefore I even get started with the food, let me tell you about a liquid gem this place likes to call the \\"King St Buck.\\" This drink (Moscow Mule with papalmousse) will sing in your mouth and put a grin on your face. One of the best drinks I've had.\\n\\nWant to take a tasty train to flavor station? Hop on board with the shrimp and grits with pine nuts and chili oil appetizer. The complex flavor profile will have you double-checking the name of the restaurant; surely, this is a seafood place with class and panache! No?\\n\\nWhen it's entree time, saddle up and sink your teeth into the porterhouse pork with white beans or the quail stuffed with chicken sausage. You may be thinking the latter sounds far too similar to a Turducken, but it is so much more sophisticated and delicate. The pork was also fantastic; juicy, tender, massive slab of oink fit for a king.\\n\\nSave room for some rich chocolate cake!

I just sucked it up and decided to eat it and not come back.

Since the hotel IS currently going through a massive renovation project I will NOT review the rooms. As obviously that is currently being addressed. I will say this the building has charm and it feels like an intimate boutique hotel. There are only about 50 something rooms currently in service so the hotel does not feel crowed at all. The location is amazing; right across the street from the public gardens and a short walk to the Boston commons. We were upgraded to a two bedroom suit with the most amazing view of the public gardens. \\n\\nWhat I would definitely highlight is the service. Coming from a hospitality background I am very hard to 'wow' however, The Taj was able to deliver on amazing service and added personal touches that really made a difference. We were warmly greeted by the door man who was extremely patient with us, (since we were traveling with small children we had a lot of stuff). I never once felt rushed. When the hotel found out we were traveling with small children they had placed coloring book AND crayons in the room along with tickets to take the kids on a swan boat ride. As well as a swan stuffed animal!  The concierge team discreetly went out of their way to make sure we felt at home. Answering  sophomoric  questions about how to get around Boston and the likes. The staff made me and my children feel like We were in own home. After we went out to explore the city I was surprised to receive a text from Katie inquiring about how my stay was going. She was very quick and responsive in answering and suggesting different concerns I might have had. We also ended up using baby sitting service that they recommended. Again a positive experience. When it was time to check out the bellman came up within 10mins. The day we had to check out, there was a  parade going on and they were not going to be able to bring up our car to the hotel as many of the streets are closed off and the parking garage is NOT on site. (Make sure you call 20 mins before you need your car). Anyway the valet Carlos escorted us to the location where he was going to bring the car as the closest 'open' street was about a block away. He could have easily send us on our own but he made sure we were taken care off. It's all these small attention to details that made our stay pleasant.  \\n\\nI really hope when the hotel opens up the rest of the hotel after the renovations is complete that their service stays the same and the quaint boutique feel does not change. \\n\\nI look forward to coming back to Boston after the renovations are completed to see how it compares; but until then keep up the excellent job you ladies and gentlemen are doing."},{"name":"Jack's Pizza & Wings","address":"676 Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Paul is the best!!!!

The wood-fired steaks have great flavor; the charring from the cooking process gives the steak added texture and flavor, which I enjoyed. Any steak option is a slam-dunk (we had the Filet Mignon and Top Sirloin). The Shrimp Durango appetizer was delicious-the broth is so good, it should be it's own soup! Also, make sure you dip your bread into that broth as it gives extra flavor (speaking of the bread, the spiced-butter they bring with it is delicious).

A place where simplicity reigns.  A place that is just over 85 years old and has stood in its current spot for 30 years, all in the caring, loving hands of one family, the Caseys of Natick, MA.\\n\\nWhat is a restaurant?  A place to enjoy good food and service, with good company, in a pleasing atmosphere.  \\n\\nAcross the country, people in the restaurant craft strive to create a winning blend of food, service, and milieu.  Millions, even tens of millions can be spent making or remaking a location to achieve the perfect physical space.  \\n\\nChefs spend thousands of hours learning their art, wracking their brains for the perfect concept, the best dishes their hands and minds can conceive and execute.  They seek financial backing, the best ingredients, great help in the kitchen and in the dining room. \\n\\nCasey's Diner required no millions of dollars, and no culinary degree, and yet it is truly holy ground in the world of restauranting.  It's been on the National Register of Historic Places for the last 30 years.  This diner started its life as a Worcester horse-drawn diner car in 1922, and the Caseys have lovingly cared for it ever since, right down to the original varnish on the all-oak, original interior, with ten simple barstools cozily arrayed along the bar.\\n\\nHere you will find a very simple menu of hamburgers and frankfurters and a few other sandwiches, like fried egg and ham and cheese.  The burgers and sandwiches are grilled on an ancient old gas-powered griddle.  The buns are heated on top of the meat.  \\n\\nThe frankfurters, Casey's signature item, are steamed in an antique copper hot dog steamer, and served up in a classic split-top New England-style bun.  You can have a bag of chips or a soda in a can to go with your sandwich, or a cup of heavenly coffee from an antique gas-powered urn.  There are no fries, or onion rings, and you'd be crazy to want them.  It's all about these lovely franks and burgers, my friends.\\n\\nI mentioned service and by service I mean a warm, low-key welcome by Pat or Fred, a hot dog served moments after you ask for it, and burgers that go on the grill as you finish stating your order.  It is simply not possible to have fresh food on a plate in front of you any faster than this.  It's like magic.\\n\\nWhen you step inside, locals who have cherished this place since childhood glance your way, and you'll hear them call out orders for favorites that are clearly etched on their memory's tongue.  \\"Three all-arounds, please!\\"  An all-around is a frank with mustard, relish, and onion.\\n\\nThese hot dogs make that perfect snap when you bite into them and you'll find yourself polishing off one or two just as an appetizer.  They are delicious, perfect in every way.\\n\\nThe hamburgers are just as simple and just as perfect.  You can have white American cheese and a number of toppings, but I urge you to order the pepper burger with cheese and mustard.  A pepper burger is topped with slivers of sweet pickled red and green bell peppers that are griddled right alongside the burger, and with mustard and cheese it makes an absolutely perfect, zesty lunch.  It was so good, this jaded food grump felt tears stinging his eyes.\\n\\nOn my second visit in the two days I was in Natick, I ordered two dogs and two pepper with cheese and mustard, and I left for my plane ride home almost giddy with delight at the simple, clean, pure taste of these treats.  \\n\\nThis place gets swamped just about noon every day it's open, with the ten stools in heavy rotation by hungry diners and the walk-up window at the right side a scene of constant activity as the locals line up and call out their regulars orders.  Pat and Fred seem to know everyone and how they like their dogs and burgs.\\n\\nAs I munched my lunch and snapped a few pictures with permission of the Caseys, I soon found myself the lucky recipient of stories of way back when and the beaming pride of locals who are glad that a stranger far from home appreciates the treasure they have kept going with their loving patronage over decade after decade.  Pat proudly showed me the picture of the diner hitched to a horse that hangs on one wall, a snapshot of which I'll post shortly.\\n\\nIf you love frankfurters and hamburgers, and you are within a couple of hours drive of this national treasure, you owe it to yourself to make time to plant your elbows on the counter and order up a couple of dogs and a burger or two, and enjoy this lovely piece of culinary history. \\n\\nAs the guy who kind of invented the \\"milestone\\" review on Yelp, I normally review a non-business, like a park or a service organization for a milestone.  For my 1,000th review, I celebrated a dumpy Chinese diner in Ohio that I enjoyed with my late father.  But for this, my 1,500th, I am delighted to point to a magic little spot and to thank the Caseys for loving and caring for it all these years."},{"name":"The Wave... of American Flavors","address":"4600 N World Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I know that anytime I go to the Wave, I can expect great food and service.

Orders are placed electronically using a kiosk at the counter of the store front. I received my food rather quickly. I tried their \\"meatballs and marinara\\" which were made from eggpant and served with sliced Parmesan cheese and marinara sauce on top. The \\"meatballs\\" has good texture--they were firm enough to maintain shape and integrity, but soft when you ate them. They were flavorful and while there were not quite chunks of eggplant there was enough so that you could tell. The marinara was a vibrant red color and it's flavor was tangy and acidic like a good marina should be. They are more generous with the shaved Parmesan cheese than I expected which was a welcome surprise. The cheese was nutty and starting to melt as I ate it. I also got an a√ßai smoothie, which was rather bland. I could not taste the acai or any fruit flavor really. It mostly tasted like creamy ice.

The parking, for starters, was astronomical, much higher than average airport on-site parking.

Hotel website implies that \\"buffet\\" breakfast is included with the room rate, considering the vast array of food options they offered (not to mention the room rate). It, in fact, is not. Moreover, the price far exceeded the quality.  When I inquired about the breakfast situation and sought clarification, I could not reach anyone via phone, and so had to personally go to the desk, where I was met with an indignant representative who seemed to imply that I should have known all this info at booking.

Certainly pleasant enough to hang out at for a while in mild weather (although I'm sure the parking-lot-next-to-patio-next-to-north-Lamar gets battered by the summer sun once it shows up). Santorini also serves beer (and wine?) but doesn't have a a full bar. They've also got a t.v.

However, our waiter really irritated us through the meal. He was very knowledgeable and seemed nice, but towards the middle of the meal he got a little rude. My mother in law and dad ordered the burger. My mother in law asked if she could have some ketchup & mayonnaise for her burger when she ordered it for which he relied \\"are you sure? Our burgers are grass fed and I don't put sauces on mine.\\" But my mother in law wanted the requested condiments. My dad also ordered his burger to be well done which he replied \\"I really think you should get it medium, well done will ruin the burger.\\"  My dad said he wanted it well done anyways (that's always been his preference).\\nWhen the burgers came out, our waiter had been MIA for over 15 minutes- so all of us were out of water, sweet teas and wine. There were no condiments served with the burgers and my dads burger was medium rare at the most. \\nWe waited a while for the waiter to return but after about another 10 minutes, they ate the burgers as they were presented- with no condiments and undercooked. The waiter brought the condiments out after the burgers had been completely consumed. \\nI ordered the pasta with lobster. It had good flavor, but the unfortunate part was the lobster had so many hard pieces in it that half the lobster was inedible. \\nOverall, it was very over priced for mediocre food that wasn't served with their customers preferences taken into account. \\nMaybe one day I'll try it again, but it was highly disappointing to waste my 30th birthday meal here."},{"name":"El Oriental De Cuba","address":"416 Centre St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"4","text":"My favorite thing about going out to eat is finding authentic food that makes you feel like you're right at home !

Then, I called and was informed that the lady was on her break who does online orders she informed me that the food wouldn't be delivered until 4:15.

We doubled back and was able to find the restaurant.\\n\\nParking was easy as there was a lot across the street.  We got there around 7am, so there was only one table taken with a couple that came in right after us.  The owner (I'm guessing it was the owner) was very nice and helped us figure out what to order, she even allowed us to charge up our iPhones while eating (they had ran out of juice trying to navigate around Boston).  The whole place is pretty small, but it seemed like many the locals order \\"to-go\\", so seating wasn't too much of an issue.\\n\\nYou order at the counter and get your drink there and they bring you out your food (hot orders) while you're seated (if eating there).  I ordered the mountain muffins with a plain iced coffee and my husband ordered Jac's breakfast burrito with a flavored coffee.  Both were excellent.  It's the kind of food that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. :)  It was the perfect start to our long weekend and we'll definitely go again the next time we're out there!\\n\\nBTW, we met a couple of really nice cops that gave us some suggestions on sites to visit while out there.  They, along with the owners, got a kick out of the fact that we found them on yelp. ;)"},{"name":"Velvet Taco Domain","address":"11501 Rock Rose Ave, Ste 160","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The atmosphere rocks.

It's a small little shop and definitely made to pick up and go. They specialize in taho, but they also have other Filipino desserts like halo halo and bubble tea. The taho comes in a few different sizes - personal, small, medium, and large. Everytime I've come here, I've picked up a large. And for $20, why not? It's a huge steal. When I say large, think of those huge 4L ice cream tubs you used to get when you were young at the grocery store. That 4L bucket is filled with taho, and trust me, it's delicious. \\n\\nMy favourite part about the taho is the arnibal (brown sugar syrup) that you put on top.

The food is amazing, although on the more expensive side, it's well worth it! The lobster bruschetta is my favorite appetizer. It's perfectly dressed and not too heavy and the bruschetta is so buttery! The jalapeno yellow tail shots are delicious also, I wish I can have 20 except of 6. The ponzu pairs perfectly with the yellow tail. I often ask for it for my sushi and sashimi instead of using soy. The new pokitini is now my favorite cold dish. It has a mixture of salmon, yellow tail, and tuna cut up into a glass with a soy foam. The foam is too salty for my liking so I rather use the ponzu instead. All of their rolls are delicious, you really can't go wrong. But my absolute favorite is the Lady in Red. They also have unique cocktails and classic favorites. The ambiance is trendy but not overly fancy. It's a great place to have a causual date night or get together with friends."},{"name":"Suerte","address":"1800 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This review is a bit late but I figure better late than never. I brought my family here for their sunday brunch and found out it was the first weekend they had started brunch. Before I go into details here are my rankings:\\nAmbiance: 4 stars \\nFood: 2 stars (presentation, taste, price, quantity)\\nService: 3.5 stars\\n \\nAs you can see my biggest drawback was the food taste and price. For a starter we got 3 tacos: butternut squash (good), quesadilla de aguacate (meh and way too much cheese), and a potato taco that is not on their current brunch menu (unmemorable) The size of the tacos are very tiny, and not worth the 3.5-4/taco price as none of them were remarkable in my opinion. For the entrees we got the entomatadas, migas, goat dish (not on the current brunch menu) and a vegetarian black bean omelette (no on the menu). My migas dish was surprising, it's unlike any migas I've seen before. To start with you get a very small scoop of eggs covered in a hollandaice sauce/foam. The flavors were interesting and overwhelmingly smokey but I still felt very hungry and unsatisfied. The entomatadas were very salty and once again the quantity is extremely small and sauce had a smokey undertone. My brother who got the goat skillet dish said it was good but not his favorite meal in austin. The only person satisfied with their dish got the black bean omelette which has no eggs, it's more like a black bean souffle-ish dish. I tasted it and it was good but I added a liberal amount of salsa. I do like that the tortillas are fresh and presented nicely.  Another bonus is that they have parking which is a great perk on east side. \\n\\nOverall, I went in expecting an elevated tex mex brunch and it was an elevated dining experience but not the flavors/taste I was expecting. I personally don't think the price for the quantity you get it worth it at brunch."},{"name":"Arepazo Tapas & Wine","address":"93 N High St","city":"Gahanna","stars":"4.5","text":"I've been a big fan of Arepazo the whole time I've lived in Columbus, but until recently, I had only ever been to the downtown location.

It was OK, I don't understand why there was a pool of oil around the grits and why the grits tasted like lamb or some sort of gamy flavor. \\n\\nFor the main course I got the beef short ribs. This one was perfect. It was cooked medium well even though they said it would be medium to medium rare. There is no bone and the meat texture is more like steak just as the server explained which was great. The flavor is a bit sweet and I loved it. \\n\\nFor the dessert... I was disappointed. I got the tres leche.  The ice cream that topped it off was peanut butter and I absolutely hate peanut butter. I tasted some sort of sesame seeds in the milk that soaked the cake or perhaps it was some other spice since there was a bit of spice kick which I hated as well and then sliced almonds as topping. Everything that could go wrong in a dessert was in that small jar. Sorry ! maybe I haven't worked my taste buds to this level of delicacy.\\n\\nOverall this is just not The type of food I like.

I used to pass Vanbarry's everyday on my way to work and thought it was an odd spot for a divey restaurant but now that I've actually been here I think it is great.

They do have valet parking if you're feeling fancy and don't want to deal with finding a spot. I wish I could say the food was great but I cannot. My husband ordered one beer, mac n cheese ($4) and a hamburger and he spent the rest of the night in the bathroom.

I really enjoyed that energy.\\n\\nNow let's get to the food, I had the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken Limone if I can recall for sure cause it came with capers. My apologies if I'm wrong here guys about the exact name but it was certainly chicken. The pasta was a bit dry for my liking but nothing some salt, pepper & cheese couldn't fix. By the way, those damn capers are delicious. It added so much flavor to the chicken. I will be using that on other dishes at home so thanks for the inspiration. Their sangria is also delicious. I will not admit how many I had but it was more than one haha.

Behind the counter it seems completely chaotic. There were a LOT of employees - a lot, bustling here and there but it really appeared more confused clutter than anything. The order before me took quite a while as the cashier seemed to be having trouble, either with the register itself or with how to operate it. It just seemed like they were barely getting by. The man that took my order was quite pleasant, though distracted, and the woman that brought my food was very nice and courteous. \\n\\nMy food was alright. I had the 3 cheese mac & cheese, which comes with garlic bread. The mac & cheese sauce was pretty good actually, but overall the dish was overly sauced (runny) and the pasta was somewhere short of al dente. So it was a little chewy. The bread was good, but not warm and also put on top of the mac & cheese so there was no way to eat it (or set it down) without getting my fingers cheesy. I'd suggest serving it on a plate.\\n\\nI might be back given some time, though I'll order something different.

They tell you on the first page of their menu to expect a 20 minute wait for your food, but it'll be well worth your wait.\\n\\nI came here with a party of eight on a Saturday night, so it was pretty crowded.  You have to hunt for your own table, and snatch it up right when a table leaves.  That's how it works here.  \\n\\nDRINKS: Super cheap beer.  Pitchers for $4.  Just do it. \\n \\nFOOD: Amazing.  I shared a large Jason pizza and 5 piece wings with my friend.  The Jason pizza has mac and cheese and bacon on the pizza.  How could you go wrong?  Every bite is so heavenly (and filled with a little bit of guilt).  We got the sriracha wings, which were pretty spicy, even coming from someone who can take spicy foods.  Portions are all massive.  Take your time and pace yourself because you don't want to scarf it all down and be full too early on.  I learned this from firsthand experience.  \\n\\nFor the sake of my health, this is one place that I won't be coming to very often, but this is hands down one of my new favorite pizza joints in town!\\n\\nFun fact: they have candied sriracha bacon in a packet for $2.99.

The outside is beautifully decorated with blue and white painting colors and a picturesque of people sitting; there are also words written all over on the outside of different states, and then a welcome sign in the front door in both English and Turkish. It's just adorable and so inviting! You already feel like you've gone in a different place. Then once you step into the restaurant, you definitely feel like you've stepped into a magnificent Mediterranean world. Yes, it felt like I left Florida and flew to Turkey without the actual travel time! It was so nice! The inside decor has been meticulously designed and placed by the owner and chef of the restaurant. You can absolutely tell because every single detail wasn't missed; from the Turkish light fixture, the hookahs by the bar, the oud beautifully hanging in the corner, the pictures and paintings of Turkish skylines on the walls. I could feel the love and care that was put into this place. There is heart and soul in everything here... the place, the people, and also the food and drinks. Everything came out hot and fresh from the kitchen. The flavors in the feta, the sauces, the seasonings, the way the dough and rice were cooked, were just mouth watering. I promise, I'm not exaggerating! The Turkish tea and Turkish coffee ordered were enjoyed with every sip, and the cherry juice with the baklava dessert were super succulent. Our server Michelle also rocked! She was very warm and friendly and always ready and eager to serve us by making sure we had what we wanted to order and constantly making sure we were getting refills. If you've never been here, this place is new, and I highly encourage everyone to check out this place!

There are 30 locations in Florida.

They sold us a $29 package, unlimited bowling \\"till they closed\\". With shoes, the total came to $49.99. What they didn't tell us, was that they were closing in less than an hour by this time.

Inferred: to do just what she did (Sell up & not tell the customers that they had less than an hour before closing). He gave us one card between the 4 of us for one free hour. WooHoo!

It was supposed to be a large chocolate cake with peaches.  $48.  Unfortunately when we cut it that night at the birthday party it was a rum cake.   I didn't have another cake is back up, and I thought it was just yellow cake. So I served it.  When I brought this mistake to the attention of the owner this morning, she looked up the receipt and it said rum cake. She accused me of ordering the rum cake or miscommunicating. But I never would've ordered a rum cake knowing that there would be children and a couple of recovering alcoholics present.  Needless to say most of the kids tasted and didn't like it. I was one of the last people to have a slice so we didn't realize that it was rum cake until after most of it had been served (and thrown away).  I went in there today to buy cupcake with no intention of asking for a refund.  Wanted to bring the mistake to their attention. After the owner got belligerent with me I did ask for a refund and she offered me three dollars ($48 cake).

Well, it was new for me! We started with salsa, guac, and chips and margaritas. I had the cucumber jalape√±o margarita. It was refreshing and the flavors were perfectly balanced. So yummy! For my meal, I had the mix and match artisan tacos. I tried the Rebosado de Cerveza (white fish in a beer batter with green cabbage, cilantro, pineapple salsa, & yogurt-chipotle cucumber sauce), Carnitas (slow-braised pork, herbs, citrus and Mexican spices, cilantro, white onions, and Cotija cheese & avocado sauce), and the Asada tacos (skirt steak, white onions, cilantro, & molcajete salsa). The ingredients were fresh and the tacos were so filling! With the taco trio, you also get your choice of 2 sides. I chose black beans and Mexican rice. The tacos were so good that I didn't even touch the sides. Plus, I went for another cucumber margarita! Overall, I was very pleased with my new find.

They were super helpful when I made our reservation, and answered all my questions about bringing our little one. Some restaurants aren't as nice about bringing an 8 month old, but they were great! When we arrived we were greeted at the door and taken right back to our table. Our server was SO kind and was honestly the best part of our experience. She was so accommodating to our baby, and kept offering suggestions to help make her meal more enjoyable. She even brought out an adorable little plate of cut up fruit for her which she loved. Every server or food runner who came by our table smiled and said hello, and complimented our baby. Everyone was so nice!\\n\\nFor our meal we started with a bottle of Pinot Noir, and my husband ordered a steak w/ asparagus, and brisket mac n cheese, and I ordered the scallops with risotto. Our food was delicious, and we ate every bite. Since it was my birthday I got to choose a dessert, which our server kindly packed up since we were so full. I chose the carrot cake since there were so many excellent reviews mentioning it, and it did not disappoint. It was a huge slice and it was delectable! \\n\\nSo all of that sounds pretty great, right? It was! So why 3 stars? Well, that night after our meal we both got severe food poisoning and unfortunately spent the rest of my birthday/mothers day weekend in the bathroom and getting sick. I'm so thankful our baby only ate the fruit because I would have been broken hearted if she got sick as well. I did reach back out to the restaurant to let them know, and they didn't even apologize or acknowledge my message. I communicated with them via email on their website, which was the same format I used in asking questions to make our reservation. So that was disappointing! There's no greater insult than paying over $120 for a meal, just for it to make you extremely sick.

My wife and I came for their happy hour to check out the place and it was a terrible idea. Immediately when you walk in the vibes seem just fine. We sat down at the end of the bar and we're greeted by a tall gentleman. He gave us two menus and promptly vanished for 20 minutes.The patrons next to me at the bar were also in the hunt for some service. After 20 minutes another bartender clocked in and took our order. We ordered the Mussels and Shrimp tacos. My wife ordered a mango martini and I ordered the Tequila Cocktail drink. The food was very bad. The shrimp was 100% frozen and the tacos were a sad attempt overall with mediocre ingredients , bland taste and at $8 for two during happy hour you are better off going to del taco for their shrimp tacos which are much better. The mussels were just plain gross. They were not fresh , they had that really briny taste to them. They literally just throw the mussels in a Tomato sauce and throw it together. As I was eating my bartender decided to throw my napkin into the remainder of my mussels assuming I was done. So when I told her I wasn't she immediately put in another order but here is where it gets great....instead of sending me a full order they literally counted how many I had and sent me back exactly 4 mussels lol I mean I guess that works but that's never happened to me before. I really feel as if they brought out my same mussels and re heated them. The food quality is not good. You can't dial in dishes and expect to be competitive in the area. Also we had to ask for water 3 times with 3 different people. The women next to us waited over an hour for their food and they got to the restaurant before us. The place was barren when we sat down and didn't get that busy at all. The dining room was virtually empty. Servers and extra staff were just standing around waiting for something to do. I had a server just come to my area and grab my menu from me to give to another guest.....that has never happened to me. I am just amazed it took that long and that many attempts to get water in a prime location in Buckhead. \\n\\nOur drinks were ok. Nothing special. The second bartender tried her best but without proper training. And leadership her service couldn't save what was a bad experience. The lackluster gentleman that forgot to get me water twice after I asked him was also visibility disinterested in his job. When the ladies next to us asked about the delay In their orders his response was \\"ok\\" and then still no food . It seems as if he forgot to place their order and didn't think to put a rush on it in the back to make up for his mistake. Later I witnessed him getting upset with a server across the room right in front of us. \\n\\nYou can do much better in this area. I am surprised they are still operating. The team members are confused and there is no leadership. You can just feel how confused the staff are. I almost feel like calling Gordon Ramsey to come here. They need it.

Drink the Silver Coins if you like a tart marg. \\n2. Order a Fire in the Hole Shot - not on the menu if you want to kick off the night. \\n3. Get the fried oysters or the fried asparagus \\n4. The specials are good - be careful because the portions can get big. \\n5.

It's a small restaurant and at peak lunchtime, there was about at 20-minute wait, which we also took as a great sign. Most people there, including myself, ordered the lunch special: the fish and chips with one piece of cod, fries, a side of coleslaw and cup of clam chowder... all for just $12! \\n\\nStarting out, the chowder was creamy and peppery. Although you could taste the freshness from the clams, there wasn't much substance to the soup - needed more clams and potatoes. As for the fish, the breading was unfortunately more oily and thicker than I would have liked. For the price of $12, I'd still consider it a good deal, but the food quality was just alright. One person in our group ordered the pan-seared prawns entree - she thought the garlic butter sauce was delicious, but also overly greasy. The side of rice pilaf was swimming in the grease, making some of it inedible. \\n\\nDespite the constant crowds and that there was only one waitress managing all tables, service was relatively quick, so that was a plus!

We ordered dinner #1 which came with general chicken, boneless spare ribs, pork fried rice and crab rangoons. The portions were huge!!!! Definitely enough for 2-3 people to share but the food was disgusting. The huge chunks of chicken were undercooked and bloody, the boneless ribs had a weird burnt taste to them and the rice was really dark brown (?) and bland.

You get a lot of food especially meat (at least with the stew chicken). The stew chicken was okay, but not the best I've had. I wouldn't seek it out. The cabbage was excellent, better than any other Jamaican restaurant I've been too. I usually decline the cabbage for that reason but theirs was seasoned well and not overcooked. Rice and peas were good too. I was very disappointed in the beef patty. It was very dry. Not sure if they are made fresh or not.  They have a good assortment of drinks, but they are pricey. $2.50 for a Ochos Rios juice? Really?  All in all a pretty good restaurant, but not the best in terms of Jamaican food."},{"name":"Au Comptoir","address":"2278 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Yum! YUM! YUMM! Au Comptoir has been on my list to try for ages and it certainly did not disappoint. \\n\\nWe came to celebrate my birthday with a late dinner (around 8:30pm) and were seated immediately, without a wait. (Unfortunately, they do not take reservations.) We ordered a bottle of wine and enjoyed the following dishes: \\n\\nTartare de Saumon ($17) - THREE AND A HALF STARS\\nFresh and smoked salmon tartare, gem lettuce and horseradish. My least favourite dish of the night, not because it wasn't good but just because the other dishes were amazing. The salmon was fresh and the flavours were nice. It just didn't WOW us like the other dishes. \\n\\nBloc de Foie Gras ($20) - FOUR STARS\\nCured foie gras terrine with beetroot and apple. Generous block of foie gras with the fluffiest, lightest toasted bread I've ever had. The bread to terrine ratio was a bit off (not enough bread) but hey - plenty of foie gras to go around, so I'm not complaining. \\n\\nDuo de Veau - Veal ($34) - FIVE STARS\\nGrilled loin of veal, glazed veal cheek, asparagus, potatoes, morels and spring onions. Again, very generous portions of veal! Flavours were awesome!\\n\\nMagret de Canard - Duck (32) - FIVE STARS \\nHoney glazed duck breast, turnip, celeriac & potato gratin and rhubarb. Definitely the winner dish of the night! Portions were generous and the honey glaze on the thick duck skin really made this dish stand out! Reminded me of Peking duck skin.  \\n\\nChocolate Lava Cake - FIVE STARS \\nSince we came late in the evening, two of the desserts that we were eye-ing were completely sold out. We settled for the lava cake that turned out to be AMAZING. Which makes me wonder how good the other two desserts were! \\n\\nService started out a bit slow in the beginning as it was quite busy, but still friendly in the French way ;) This is definitely going up there as one of my top favourite restaurants in Vancouver!"},{"name":"Curbside Chef","address":"","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Clarito and Bonnie were a HUGE HIT at our Holiday Party on 12/07/2018.

Anyways, I came here with a friend because I've been hearing rave reviews about the food here. We got a table really quickly despite the place being packed and our server was fairly nice (though he ribbed on me for ordered the fried oysters appie and not trying any of the fresh oysters they had). The fried oysters were delish, and then we waited for the chicken. Note to everyone: fried chicken takes a while to make. Like 20 minutes. So get an appie or have lots of conversation topics tabled.\\n\\nThe plating is beautiful - it's looks super classy for a plate of fried chicken. The chicken is tender, the mashed potatoes are good. We ordered biscuits to go with it, but I didn't have enough sauce to enjoy with the biscuits (and they weren't really that hot). My friend got the BBQ Shrimp and Grits, and it was okay. We thought the flavouring was a bit salty, but at least he had a lot more sauce left for the biscuits.\\n\\nI ended the evening with the Cayenne Chocolate Cake. What a winner - flourless and dense with a hint of spiciness in it. I loved this, and wished I had foregone the biscuits (and even the oysters) in order to enjoy two or even three pieces of this little bit of Heaven.\\n\\nOverall, a solid place, but not my favourite.

I was meeting a friend for a drink down the street and had already eaten, but since I was so close I figured I had to stop in for a quick small bite to see what it was all about. I got the following two dishes off their happy hour menu:\\n\\nShrimp and Octopus ceviche\\n--I'm very passionate about the way octopus should to be prepared and I have been spoiled with some superb octopus in my life. The texture is key. If you ask me, rubbery means the chef doesn't know what they are doing, firm and tender means they have my respect (like at Odd Duck where they do octopus and pretty much everything else right). The octopus was firm and tender here so that I liked. The overall dish was good and the little pieces of scallops were a pleasant surprise.\\n\\nOxtail (Braised served with garlic mash potato and Red Wine sauce)\\n--Eh, it was ok, but, and I feel bad saying this, it tasted on par with the quality of a tv dinner. The potatoes were way to light as if made from a box of instant mashed potatoes. The meat was decent, but the flavor of everything echoed my scars of microwave tv dinners from my childhood. I will say there was one fatty bite that was pretty good, but that was it.\\n\\nAtmosphere was open, clean, and fun.

I don't know why, but I have a placing-phone-orders-phobia.  The internet was the best enabler I could have asked for.  Anyway, since Delivery.com exists and the other 3 Clarkston restaurants looked DUPER shady, I opted for the pizza.  From the Chinese restaurant.\\n\\nI ordered bacon, spinach, and black olives on a large pie.  It arrived quickly and was still hot.  It appeared to be slightly overcooked which is normally not bad, but I bought this guy in hopes of putting it in the toaster oven at a future time and now I'm afraid it'll just be a charred crusty shell.  The crust is not greasy, but it is very soft.  Which struck me as odd, since the top was well-done.  The ingredients were all tasty and the crust was enhanced by the garlic sauce cup I ordered.  Mmm hydrogenated oil.  I am thinking I'll just cover the top with foil and stick my leftovers in the toaster ov' anyway.  I only had one piece during my work break and am looking forward to my remaining dinner.\\n\\nReally the only bad thing was that Delivery.com had the wrong price info.  I had to order a couple extra things to get up to the $12 minimum but the restaurant called me and said it would actually be $17.  $5 isn't a huh-yooge difference, but the meal didn't seem like such a good deal with the extra dough.

So I had a long train ride home and figured i would order a Cuban sandwich for the road. Big mistake. I grew up in Tampa, land of the Cuban sandwich. The place where it was created. Super simple explanation: bread tasted like wheat bread, pork was dry, ham was dry and top it all off.....no cheese. The only moisture was from the pickles which made it totally soggy. I am sorry but i dont recommend this place. If you believe their flavors are good then you havent tried real Cuban food. Its like saying that Taco Bell serves authentic tacos.

I have been wanting to try the Ravenous Pig for months so we joined my best friend and his family for his birthday. They raved about the food and being a foodie,  I have heard of James and Julie Petrakis so I was excited.\\n\\nStarted with the house specialty Old Fashioned. It had bacon, whiskey and maple syrup and since I have previously vowed to never turn that combination down, I ordered it. While it wasn't as unique tasting as I had expected, it was tasty enough. GF got the Cat's Pajamas which was a rum concoction and was pretty good (pretty sweet but that might just be me).\\n\\nWe decided to start with Gruyere biscuits. I had a pasta dish with rabbit confit. GF had the lasagna. Under normal circumstances, I would have ordered the venison or Pork Porterhouse but I suspected my friend's dad would insist on paying (he did) and didn't want to overdo it.\\n\\nThe biscuits were good but but lacked any cheesiness or even cheese flavor (maybe a touch of cheese but that is pushing it since the only indication I had that cheese was present was that maybe the texture was creamier). I enjoyed them but didn't meet expectations. My dish had great-tasting pasta and the sauce was light and truffle-ly but very bland. I think it had apricots but they didn't add much and the rabbit tasted like canned tuna fish. GF's lasagna was a different take on traditional lasagna with the noodles cooked, toasted and used kinda like a bowl with the filling in the middle. It tasted good, but it wasn't great. \\n\\nOther dishes around the table included the snack board, the burger, pretzel appetizer and the scallop appetizer. The entire table felt very underwhelmed and caused those who raved earlier to actually apologize for recommending it. \\n\\nService was decent as the server wasn't friendly and just kind of did his job. We excitingly asked for a recommendation between a few drinks and he said he hadn't tried most of them and only offered suggestions on whiskey leaving the girls (rum drinkers) to order from the menu. I expect a little more at a restaurant like this; you don't need to drink the entire bar or be a juggling trapeze act but you should act like you want to be there and have a small of variety of suggestions.\\n\\nI refuse to believe that all of Orlando is wrong about this place.

So much so that we decided not to come back again to this establishment.\\n\\nDuring our summer school session, we had been stopping by Boston Tea Shop quite often. However, we had the misfortune of dealing with a server who treated us with great disregard and disrespect.\\n\\nMy girlfriend tried handing over six quarters in exchange for her order of mochi ice cream. The server, taking only two of the six quarters from her hand, proceeded to reach over the counter and take a dollar bill - without her permission- from a stack near her wallet. After taking the dollar bill without her permission, he slammed the cash register shut and walked away. \\n\\nIt is utterly unacceptable to treat customers with such disrespect. That server did not ask if he could take that money from her. She handed over what was due, and this server rudely assumed he could reach around her and take a bill instead of four quarters. \\n\\nWhen we asked to speak with the manager, the server looked at me and said, \\"I'll go get him but it will end badly for you\\". This is untoward behavior.  \\n\\n We complained to the manager, and they both refused to apologize for this rudeness. I made him give us back a dollar bill in exchange for four quarters. The manager assured me that the server had never been rude and made excuses. He then told me I should think of the server as a human rather than a worker. Of course, customers are humans as well. They should not be subjected to such poor treatment. You cannot take money from a customer when it was not offered. You cannot threaten a customer when he or she asks for a manager. \\n\\nWe will not be returning to Boston Tea Stop ever again. The manager should consider reevaluating the way in which he trains his staff to interact with customers. I worked in retail when I was young, and we were always taught that no matter how long or tough of a shift you have, you must always be polite to the customer. The server could have apologized and saved us all from such an unpleasant experience, but he instead preferred to threaten me and talk rudely to my girlfriend. \\n\\nLooking at some of the other comments here, others have experienced difficulties with the staff. This is telling."},{"name":"Top Shanghai Cuisine Restaurant","address":"120-8100 Ackroyd Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"Top Shanghai focused on good food, not so such on service or atmosphere.  \\n\\nI came here on a Sunday night with my husband.

Service is prompt but cold and we always marvel at how many tables and people they can fit in this restaurant. \\n\\nI love their drunken free range chicken here.  The chicken tastes salty and sits in a very nice boozy, salty wine sauce. Far boozier that the drunken chicken had elsewhere. \\n\\nPan fried pork buns are one of their specialities.  Crispy on the outside, doughy, juicy and steaming hot in the inside. The juice is quite clean tasting but flavourful.

(And to be clear the small plates have food on them.)\\n\\nI started with the Strawberry and Tomato Gazpacho (without the halibut it came with), dressed with sungold and marigold flowers. This had and unusual flavor that took some getting used to but the sweet and the tomato blended together nicely. The flower leaves also added another nice unique flavor. This was a seasonal offering and I see on today's menu online they have a Red Kuri Squash Soup which sounds phenomenal and gives a good indication that this place's seasonally changing menu is worth coming back to.\\n\\nI also had a side of Tater Tots. Let's be honest here...if you're going to have tots on your menu, I'm going to go ahead and order them. These were doctored up with smoked onion and wild blackberry mustard. These were really good tots...crispy on the outside and a unique, nothing like frozen texture and taste on inside. The blackberry mustard had an almost horseradish vibe...a little overpowering after a while, but it was good in moderation. I kept eating the tots on their own as they were really good.\\n\\nFor my main I had the (also seasonal) Local Foraged Mushroom Stroganoff. This was a fresh pappardelle with Hen of the Woods mushrooms and Creme Freche. I didn't love this. The \\"fresh\\" pappardelle was too al dente and the sauce was a little too tart. I liked the wine ambiance of it but it was too much. The mushrooms on their own with the sauce were good.\\n\\nMy wife had the Green Salad with Goat Cheese. It was overall tasty but felt it was overdressed and made the lettuce soggy quickly. The goat cheese was on the rim and around the inside of bowl and was really tasty.\\n\\nAnd why not add a cheese offering too...we're on vacation after all. I had the goat cheese with rhubarb leather, sweet crunchy hazelnut crumbles, and pickled rhubarb. This was really good and one can see why cheese is offered as a dessert option on sensible menus.\\n\\nThey had a few other vegetarian sides available...more cheese offerings, and a chocolate dessert that looked phenomenal.

She passes again... \\"Can I sit anywhere?\\" \\"Sure!\\"\\n\\nAfter a bit, I ask for coffee. A mug soon arrives. Whoosh! Gone. No sugar. I look around everywhere, no tables have sugar. I get her attention and ask, she rummages around a bit, making me wonder if anyone uses the stuff, and she finds it.\\n\\nBack at the table, I add sugar and then realize I have no utensils. Argh. I get up, look around, find no stand or otherwise. I go back to my table, rummage in my purse and find something to use to stir. You don't want to know what it was, but, at least, it was a bit cleaner after stirring, so there's that. The coffee is stone cold. Not cold like \\"I used to be hot, but I sat here too long and am now warm.\\" Nope, this was dead cold, zombie cold \\"I was never hot and dream wistfully about what hot might actually have ever been.\\" That cold(busted warming plate? I dunno.)\\n\\nWhen Kim arrives, she brings the menus and I ask for a cup of hot coffee (nicely). From here, things improve. The service and timing are good, the fried chicken sandwich (Southern Andy) and Kim's Club are great, as is even my side salad, full of nice greens. All continues well and let's be clear... I left the poor dear an extra large tip, because she was working her butt off.\\n\\nWhere does the\\"blame\\" lie then? IMHO, management. They could have used two more people to serve this crowd, so I don't think it was just someone calling in sick. The lack of signage and, oh yeah, forgot to mention, dark and dingy interior... these combine to paint a picture, a very bad color by numbers with a couple colors missing and others filled in with whatever color come to hand.\\n\\nI'd like to come back for the food, but I won't.

The happy hour menu included a $6 plate of 2 artisanal cured meats with accoutrements. Today I was served lamb hard salami and pork rillettes with obviously fresh made ground mustard and pickled cornichons. This combination was not ideal.  The lamb salami was delicious = well seasoned, flavored with a nice gaminess.  The rillettes were well executed.  Together, it was too much savory, heavy and salty.  The rillette did not compliment the lamb, and instead highlighted the fattiness that usually compliments the gaminess well, but with the pork it was overwhelmningly fatty. The cornichons (fancy shmancy word for pickled cucumbers, aka pickles, but well treated and pickled are delicious) had all of the flavor that you want of a great, obviously in house pickled and made cornichon.  However, they were soggy and spongy like, which is not a highlight for vinegar-proned pickling.\\n\\nOkay, the drink was amaaazeballs.  I do not like super fruity drinks but nor can I drink whiskey, scotch (I love Scotch. Scotchy scotchy scotch!), or Bourbon. The No Way Fros√© cocktail on HH was on point for $6.  Frozen blended strawberry colored drink arrives in a Cabernet-Sauvignon-like sized wine glass with a straw and a large fresh mint leaf on top. The the aperol and passion fruit, as the server correctly described, gave a perfect tartness to offset any sweetness without it being too overly liquor assertive.  It was delicious, and the perfect drink to sip slowly throughout the meal.\\n\\nFor main, I ordered the \\"blackened\\" grouper over broccolini, in-house made gnocchi, and with a parmesan sauce and arugula pesto topped with pickled red onions, porcini mushrooms, and gooseberries.  This was above all, delicious.  However, the portion of sauce to fish proportions actually led me to wonder if it were a soup? They had also served me a soup sized spoon, so I was wondering if the entree was maybe soupish form?  Either way, the grouper wasn't blackened, hence the quotation marks. It was, however, and more importantly, perfectly pan seared to show a beautiful color on the fish fillet with the right amount of crust on the outside and flake-on-your fork cooked perfection. Swipe some fish on a gnocchi, slather through the parmesan and pesto sauce, and yum.\\nPorcini mushrooms introduced an interesting texture and flavor \\"pop\\" differential and the broccolini was perfectly al-dente to give a refreshing texture, that also soaked up the sauce to complement a perfect bite. The gooseberries, which were fresh and untreated, gave a good burst of acid to balance out each bite.  The thing that was great was the server encouraged me to order this dish, stating it was balanced, and she was so right!! \\nThis is a great place that is the type you want to bring your out of town guests to wine and dine.

I had zero idea there were two and had to snatch the other one back and said well no in that case we would need two. He then argued with me that other guests might need them!  I had to close the door on him. Additionally, a housekeeper was rude to my boyfriend when he explained to her we had a late check out as she tried force her way in.

I didn't bother complaining as I've decided this hotel sucks and will never come back. Lastly, not my issue, but as I was waiting in the lobby, I heard a guy checking out say that the wake up call never called... Honestly, not sure where they got the 4 diamond rating plaque they have displayed in the receptionist area, maybe at one point, but not anymore. I've had better accommodation, treated better, and ate better, for a fraction of the price at a Double Tree.  Save your money, stay elsewhere.

He stopped by shortly after we got the first round and our cheeseboard(another server brought us plates) and asked how we were and that was the last time we saw before he cashed us out.

Portions were large! I was genuinely surprised about that.

For the main entree, my friends chose the salmon, and they had quite a lot too. The beef tartar, I was actually really impressed. Lots of flavors, leaning on the salty side, but I'm a fan of sodium. Star of the show for me was the chicken entree, but not because of the chicken, but the sauce! The sauce was really good. I think it was a honey sauce infused with figs (?). Regardless of what it was, it wasn't too sweet - just right. The dessert was meh. Good, but nothing that blew my mind. \\n\\nMisc: Parking is going to kind of suck, but don't lose hope.

I'm not usually the one to make a review ,but this establishment needs to hear this and people need to be warned of this place for the current time being until things gets better. \\n\\nI honestly wanted something simple, wings. What is this place known for? Wings, beer, burgers, and good little appetizers right? This place was an all time favorite from younger years. I went here went here on the hopes of finding good wings, a beer or two, and some crunchy chips. The unfortunate part is that I only got chips and water between an hour time span. I put my order in and it came out one hour later. Customer service is very vital for this place and I WAS NOT taken care of. I had to talk to the manager of the place and the helper to ask \\"where is the food?\\" and \\"is this place under-staffed\\" after an hour and waiting and the food magically appeared like it was waiting on the counter or something. Each time the server came over it was just laughed off and \\"lemme check on what is happening\\" and then disappear for ten or so minutes. Between the order getting wrong (10 wings and fries), the bad wait time (totaling to 1.5 hours for a meal), refills taken 10 per each refill after asking a helper and the manager of the establishment. The waiter did not server or refill drinks. Even when my order was wrong I was not about to wait another hour to get the right order. The helper was refilling drinks and the manage got the food. The helper (aka: bus boy) was tipped for the hard work he put into the table. It's funny how a bus boy is attending to the table more than our server. Either something was going on in the kitchen or the waiter was not paying attention. I have high hopes for this place but honestly will not attending this place better. I'm sure there is a better place in Atlanta that has better wings, better customer service, better ways of dealing with a kitchen staff, and a better way to attend to their guests. Hope for better because until then, I'll put my business somewhere else.

She didn't take my name and really said nothing more after giving me my change.  \\n\\nI sat and thought it wouldn't take long for my order.  I noticed the guys who were ahead of me getting served and felt relief that my order would be next, especially as I didn't want to miss the bus.  When a man who came in AFTER me was served his food, I was starting to think my order was forgotten or that maybe it was left somewhere that I wasn't aware of (because I had never ordered there).  I was also getting impatient about my bus.  Another small order was filled and I was ready to go to the counter and ask for my money back.  THANKFULLY, a girl from the back came out with my sandwich.  \\n\\nThe sandwich was pretty small and I felt that, for the money, it should have been quite a bit bigger.   I ate half of it while waiting for my bus and was shocked that it actually tasted pretty good.  It was very tasty and I enjoyed the sandwich, but the wait, the service, and the price of the sandwich are what drags the star rating down for me.

There was certainly a crowd both on the outside deck and on the inside. Even the outside of Joe's was crowded and chaotic with parking and an employee trying to redirect traffic so as not to have a build up of cars. I say this to say, we expected there to be a possible wait for both a table and the service we might receive. We decided to sit inside and grabbed a rather long, high top table near the bar. Initially we were the only 2 who sat there. Our server, a young woman whom mentioned it was her first day, took our drink order. My friend ordered a specialty drink and I, the Chardonnay. The Chardonnay, which came out first took over 40 min to come out and in addition came out in a filthy glass! See pics. I was stunned that such a glass was even brought out, as the what looked like left over pulp remnants sat on the glass were significantly noticeable. My friend and I decided to wait on our server to inform her, however, after about 10 minutes of waiting, we decided to ask the bartender behind us. A young, black woman wearing glasses. I was told she gave my friend a hard time about switching out the glass for a clean one, as we should wait for our server, who unfortunately had more tables than she was prepared for. Nonetheless, she did eventually swap it. Another party joined our table and ordered drinks and food. All of which came out within 20 min. Meanwhile, my friend still never received the specialty drink she ordered over 40 minutes ago. It was not until she saw the group next to us receive their drinks, that she asked about the status of her drink when our server finally returned. Long story short, the entire visit was a mess. We complained to the manager, a blonde woman who was very accommodating. My food was excellent, veggie spaghetti.

The concept is very cool, the menu design brings a smile to your face, the drink list has an ingenious layout, the food offerings read like an exciting dream, and the service is friendly. But there are quite a few misses as well, and they lie in the two most important departments - flavor and value. \\n\\nEver since I read the first review of Smallwares I've been excited to try it. The dishes sound incredible, and the type of food is right up my alley. Asian food makes me smile. So on a sunny lunch hour I decided to stop in here for a high-powered meeting with a friend. We sampled a nice cross section of dishes and left... well... a little nonplussed. \\n\\nThe lunch menu (same as the dinner menu? I don't know) has a bunch of options starting with small bites to small plates/appetizers to entrees. Like most Asian food, it's designed for sharing. Most of the small plates are in the $8-10 range and the \\"entrees\\" push up in to the high teens. \\n\\nWe opted for four dishes: the dashi poached egg with trout roe, mabo tofu, fried broccolini with mint and fish sauce, and chicken lollipops with sriracha aioli. The mabo tofu was tasty but quite small, and had a weird sandy texture to it that's a bit of a turn off (at least to me). Minus that texture, this dish would be a win (aside from the price - read on). The egg in dashi is your basic slow boiled egg. The trout roe is a nice touch but the rest of the dish has a straightforward flavor profile and is about as basic as you'd expect of an egg in dashi. Both come in cup-sized rammekins and at $8 the egg is (and I don't use this word often) a ripoff. The mabo tofu at $9 is also way overpriced for the size. \\n\\nThe fried broccolini and mint with fish sauce came in a pile in a bowl and had a decent volume to it. The top of the pile was nice and crispy with tempura and fishy goodness. The bottom of the bowl, soaking in fish sauce, turned quickly into a more mushy texture. The flavors in this dish are creative but bold and out of balance - the mint and fish come striking at the palate out of each corner like two boxers going at it in round 1. Yet it still appealed to me. At $10 maybe a fair price, but... no, actually that's a couple of dollars more than it should be. \\n\\nThe chicken lollipops make for a creatively named and executed dish. The chicken wings are set up to resemble pops and coated in a mustard-y batter and deep fried. The dish consists of 5 large wing drums and some aioli. At $11 it's... well, the only dish I though maybe worth the price. The chicken has a nice zing to it and the aioli adds some spicy edgeiness and of course a good solid rich cream to the mix. But honestly, for the price, I'd probably go over to Pok Pok and have wings that offer more substance and flavor.  \\n\\nOverall our lunch came to $44 (with a ginger beer and a hot tea), which is way too much to be paying for two very small dishes and two small share plates. The food is inventive and some of it good but none was great and nothing was all that process-driven (to justify the price). At maybe $30 or $35 I could see it being worth my while. Coming from someone who normally defends small plates and values flavor over quantity, this should say something. \\n\\nI could see myself coming back in to check out the bar and see if any of these items are more appropriately priced on HHour. But up in this range for small plates you'll likely find me over at Aviary or Woodsman, both of which offer larger portions or more complex/tasty food for similar price... and the food blows me away every time. \\n\\n4-star food, 2-star prices = average 3 stars."},{"name":"The Avenue Steak Tavern","address":"94 N High St","city":"Dublin","stars":"4","text":"Our waiter, Abe, was great.

This is a dive bar and restaurant with graffiti-covered walls and loud music.\\n\\nI found Jack's Pizza & Wings on Yelp. It's been around since at least 2006 and, at the time of writing this review, there are over 560 reviews which is a lot for a business in Atlanta. Jack's has become an Old Fourth Ward institution.\\n\\nJack's is located across from the original Highland Bakery location, next to the Freedom Park Trail. You can street park for free on North Highland Avenue Northeast. I recommend parallel parking on the bridge. There's usually plenty of parking there.\\n\\nThis is one of the diviest places I've been to in the city. Really, the only place that can compare is Northside Tavern (https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-northside-tavern-atlanta). Northside Tavern has pool tables and live music, but I prefer Jack's because Jack's serves food. Jack's has a sizable bar, lounge-type seating up front, a dining area with tables and booths, a back room with additional seating and a few old arcade games and TV, and a spacious fenced-in patio out back. There are two unisex restrooms and they're covered in graffiti too, even the mirrors. The storefront art is cool. It looks like you're walking into the open mouth of a demonic pizza slice.\\n\\nThe music was *really* loud when we first entered on a Monday night just before 7pm. It was crunk. I tried to find a seat away from a speaker. I chose a table in the back room which felt more peaceful to me. It was brighter than the main dining area because natural light came in through the ceiling. My fiancee would've preferred we sat in the main dining area because she felt secluded in the back and it smelled stale compared to the main dining area. The main dining area is definitely the more active part of the house; it's next to the bar and kitchen, so the smell of food permeates the air better there.\\n\\nJack's offers pizza by the slice (as little as $2.49 for a slice of cheese pizza) to whole pizzas as large as 16 inches (as much as $24.99 for a specialty pizza with lots of toppings). There are many pizza varieties and toppings to choose from. As for wings, they have about 15 flavors to choose from, priced at $7.49 for 5 wings and $12.99 for 10. Jack's wings are different because they're baked, not fried. The restaurant has only one oven and they cook everything fresh to order. The menu states the wait time for wings is 20 minutes, but ours arrived in less time than that. I think we got lucky.\\n\\nAlong with pizza and wings, Jack's also serves salads, tater tots, burgers, pizza burgers, pizza rolls, pizza dogs, oven-baked subs, calzones, and strombolis. They have a full bar with beer, wine, vodka, tequila, rum, and more. They have daily specials, Sunday-Friday. The Monday night specials during our visit included $4 40-oz bottles of Miller High Life, $2 well shots, and half-price wings (10-piece dine-in only).\\n\\nWe took advantage of the half-price wing special and got 10 strawberry lemon pepper wings for only $6.50 (good deal). Strawberry and lemon pepper are actually two separate flavors, but we combined them per our server's recommendation. She said strawberry lemon pepper is one of the restaurant's popular wing flavor combos. The wings were served wet. Since Jack's wings are baked and not fried, the wings weren't as crispy as I'm used to, but that was okay. I thought they tasted fine. Jack's wings are among the bigger and meatier that I've tried at a wing place. What was most unique about them was how fall-off-the-bone tender they were. That was different. The flavor tasted just like how it sounds -- sweet and a little tangy with subtle spice. If you love wings and have never tried these before, I recommend them. They're worth ordering.\\n\\nWe also got a couple slices of specialty pizza at $5.99 each. We got one Jason (macaroni and cheese, Sriracha-candied bacon, no marinara) and one Sunshine (artichoke hearts, mushrooms, spinach; white pizza). Both were delicious, but the Jason was very greasy. It left a little puddle of oil on the plate. Both the Jason and Sunshine are popular pizzas at Jack's and, like the strawberry lemon pepper wings, I recommend them. The pizzas are thin crust.\\n\\nThe Jason is named after Jason Hill, the chef and owner of the restaurant Wisteria, up the road. He created the pizza. It was really good and really unhealthy. What made the pizza work for me was the plentiful sweet and savory candied bacon bits. The mac and cheese (elbow mac) wasn't as gimmicky as I thought it would be. The textures and flavors worked. The Sunshine was yummy. What I liked best about it was how generous they were with the toppings. They didn't skimp. They use different cheeses on the Sunshine. The fresh mozzarella was my favorite part.\\n\\nWe dined in and I never felt fully comfortable here because the place felt dirty.\\n\\nOur server Olympia did a good job.

A good amount of heat, creamy panang (red) curry with beef.  Very tasty and flavourful.  This dish could've been a 5 star but the beef was a bit tough.\\n\\nThe Kao Pad (Thai Fried Rice) is only ok.

Got there around opening time and was greeted and seated immediately. Inside the restaurant was nice, everything looked clean. \\n\\nWe quickly got our drinks from our waitress and placed our order. Something that bothers me at restaurants is when servers rarely visit the table to check on you, this was the opposite here. We were probably visited 10+ times being asked the same 2 questions each time. \\"Everything okay?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Can I get anything for you?\\" \\"No\\". Normally this isn't something I'd mention, but it was incredibly excessive and made it feel weird. \\n\\nEither way we received our food, it was correct and fresh. I ordered the garlic parmesan wings traditional. When I saw them I was kind of disappointed. I had taken a picture but it seems to have fallen off my photos for some reason. They looked sad, is all I can say. While they were crispy, large sized wings and tender on the inside, the flavor was just lacking. Mostly was just parmesan thrown on top with not much garlic. \\n\\nI had also ordered a side of fries. I'm not a fan of crinkle cut most the time, and that goes for these. They weren't really seasoned, and they weren't very crispy. \\n\\nOverall I will probably be back and try a different flavor of wing and maybe another server will be less over the top with asking how things are going every 5 minutes."},{"name":"Big Brunos Bites","address":"745 Bennett Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Great experience here!

Each grain of rice had even flavour, and it was simple, but delicious. \\n\\nA disappointment of the night must be the deep fried banana with ice cream dessert.

Our awesome waiter, Justin, warned me to just try a dab, that it was similar to teriyaki sauce but with a kick.  At the beginning, I thought it was too hot, but that was the first bite only.  I LOVED that sauce!  I also loved the poblano au gratin potatoes.  Scrumptious.  The green beans with pecans were great, and done al dente.  Usually green beans are either too mushy or too raw but these were perfect.  And Justin comped a wonderful slice of coconut cake for my birthday that I had to take home because I loaded up on the bread service... a lovely round loaf of sourdough served with two tubs of butter....one smoky and one plain.  I could have blissfully eaten only that.  My husband enjoyed his wedge salad, asparagus, steak and cheesecake as well.  Now... Justin deserves a big thanks here.  He was excellent.  He was so helpful in answering our questions and steered us to foods that were perfect for us.  We even know what to order next time by his suggestions!

The rolls are laid flat and stacked to form most of the \\"volcano's\\" shape. The \\"spicy creamy sauce\\" (maybe Sriracha mayo?) is sort of poured on top in a way to resemble lava flowing outward. The delicate, thinly shaved bonito fish flakes top it off. I think the bonito represents the explosions coming out of the volcano.\\n\\nThe Gangnam Style roll is a Korean fusion sushi roll. Instead of fish, it's made with Korean BBQ beef short ribs (galbi), fried kimchi, scallions, wasabi peas, and \\"chojang\\" sauce. Chojang is short for gochujang, which is a common Korean condiment consisting mainly of fermented soybean paste. This roll is not bad. It's hard to go wrong with galbi. The chef even gives you a few leftover pieces of galbi, still on the bone, on the side. In the end, I prefer my sushi rolls and galbi served in the traditional ways, but the Gangnam Style roll is certainly a neat take on both cuisines.\\n\\nWhen it comes to sushi, I favor nigiri (and sashimi and chirashi). The One Sushi + offers nigiri and sashimi platters and chirashi sushi (a bowl of sushi rice topped with a variety of raw fish and other ingredients) for about $25-30 per order. I recommend going this more authentic route, unless of course you prefer rolls. For the best sushi dining experience, chef's choice omakase at the sushi bar is available too (for $65 per person).\\n\\nI've tried several different types of fish here and can't say I've had a bad thing. Everything is good to great, sufficiently fresh, and flavorful. I like how the menu lists the source country/region for each fish. Fish I've had include maguro (tuna, Hawaii), hamachi (yellowtail, Japan), sake (salmon, Scotland), shiro maguro (albacore tuna, Northeast Pacific), kanpachi (amberjack, Hawaii), madai (red snapper, Japan), suzuki (sea bass, Canada), toro (fatty tuna, Japan), king salmon, and white salmon. In most cases, the slices are buttery and delectable. The premium fatty tuna belly (toro) is listed at market price. When I tried it, it was $18 for two pieces of nigiri (or three pieces of sashimi).\\n\\nThe chirashi sushi bowl is excellent! At $27, it's pricier than some other chirashi bowls around town, but the portion size is big and filling. I think it's worth it. The chirashi at The One Sushi + is served in a flat bowl (more like a plate) and comes with eight different kinds of fish (two thick, succulent slices of each kind) plus ikura (salmon roe) and some edible light garnishes that include tiny flowers. I believe the sushi rice is some sort of refined brown rice. It's not the standard white sushi rice. It seems to be nicely vinegared and quite appetizing. I approve.\\n\\nQuick menu note: The \\"Spicy Miso Soup Korean Style\\" is basically Korean sundubu jjigae (tofu stew). It's served still boiling.\\n\\nService is great.

No line, and quite a few empty tables - SCORE (or so we thought...). Started by ordering 15 oysters, waited half an hour for them and found that they only delivered 14, but I'll forgive them for that.  \\n\\nAfter the oysters we waited another half an hour for the mains. They screw up my friend's order and bring him jambalaya instead of gumbo.  When my friend mentioned the mistake the waiter told him \\"no, you ordered the jambalaya\\", meanwhile 5 witnesses at the table watched him order gumbo (isn't the customer always right anyways?).  They agree to fix it for him, but it takes them so long to get the order out (about 25 mins) that the rest of the table has finished eating before it even arrives.  \\n\\nFinally, the mains are done and the waiter makes a joke about the slow service and promises if we order dessert won't take nearly as long.  So we order some chocolate cake and *surprise* it ends up taking 25 minutes to arrive.  25 minutes for a piece of cold cake - all they had to do was slice the thing and put it on the plate!  By this time our parking was about to expire so we ended up having to ask to take it to go.\\n\\nNow, here's the kicker - for all the trouble the waiter offers to take the screwed up order of gumbo off the bill.

We waited more than 10 minutes after she delivered our drinks to place an order. Now, I'm not sure if we can blame her or if management failed to schedule enough staff for the lunch rush. \\n\\nThe bread is decent, but what made it was the compound butter with garlic and herbs. \\n\\nThe steakhouse burger was a frozen patty that lacked any seasoning. The cooks also over cooked it, delivering a hockey puck  Between two pieces of bread. After delivering the food, staff failed to ask if we needed ketchup or mustard. Took another 5 minutes to find someone who was willing to help deliver condiments. \\n\\nThe fish and chips were decent, bur again, it appeared the pre-made fish came from a bag of frozen foods. The selling point was the jalape√±o tarter sauce that was good. \\n\\nWhile the atmosphere was outdated, the food and service should be reviewed.

The shop is relatively spacious with large tables and electrical outlets by the window seats, making this a great spot to get some work done while enjoying a sweet and/or savory treat. I got both :) \\n\\nI ordered a slice of their daily quiche (fresh spinach, roasted red peppers, red onion and cheddar) and a slice of banana cream pie to-go. Although I wasn't in a hurry, I appreciated that the cashier told me upfront that the quiche takes about 10 minutes to heat up - just an FYI. This was the best quiche I've had in my life. I absolutely loved the silky smooth custard filling and insanely buttery and flaky pie crust. So rich and filling. \\n\\nWhile still quite tasty, my banana cream pie wasn't the best I've had. It would be a 5 star pie (though I am still rounding up due to the quiche and overall feel of this place) if there was just less whipped cream and more of the filling. The vanilla cream filling was excellent - not overly sweet and lusciously smooth - as was the flaky and buttery pie crust. However, I'd say there was only 25% filling and 75% whipped cream. If this was a 50/50 ratio, this place would be perfection. \\n\\nI will absolutely be back to try out the rest of their pie offerings and perhaps a cocktail too! I'm particularly eyeing up their award winning vanilla-sugar salted caramel apple pie, lemon meringue pie, and chicken pot pie.

If you book with the hotel for yourself and have to pay all of those fees, the cost of your stay will quickly add up. \\n\\nThis hotel is unassuming on the outside, but once I stepped in, I couldn't help but to be drawn into the high glass ceilings, massive open seating area in the main lobby and main floor and the elevators that rise to the 10th floor that face it all. The room I received did not disappoint as it was on the 10th floor and faced the Sea World side with a full view of Sea World. The room and bathroom were clean and the air conditioning worked just fine.\\n\\nThe property seems immense and world class until you start looking for food. The restaurants here are basic and boring. There's a farm-to-table restaurant that is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner but doesn't have any inspiring, unique dishes. There's a sushi bar in the middle of the floor that serves sushi rolls for dinner only. Their Boardwalk bar also serves drinks and beers on tap but had a very limited food list of five snack items. The food and drink at the pool is about the same and expensive ($8 for a can of Heineken). And there's also a full Starbucks onsite. \\n\\nWhy am I griping about the food? First off, there isn't a proper sports bar where you can order a full plate of food. There also isn't a fine dining restaurant, like a steakhouse. Also, at 2:30 p.m., after working from my hotel room all day and wanting a quick break, I couldn't find a place to eat, the restaurants were all closed. To be fair, the food quality here is good, but the variety is lacking.\\n\\nThe prices for food and drink here are higher than they should be. My friend had a standard cocktail with Crown and he did not know it cost $16 (he was thinking they would only charge him $10-$12 dollars per glass). When he asked for a double version of the drink, it was $32 a glass. He ordered 3 sushi rolls, a single and two double drinks and his bill shockingly came out to $188... for himself! Whoops, good luck trying to get that through on your expense report buddy!\\n\\nPluses:\\n\\nThe self-parking lot is near the front elevators. \\nFriendly and efficient hotel staff.\\nA roomy workout center that is stocked with full circuit of equipment (dumbells, weight machines, ellipticals, life cycles, yoga/pilates room.\\nEmpty refrigerators in the room that you can put your own drinks in without getting charged.\\nAcross the street from Sea World (if you are going to the park).\\n10 minutes from the Vineland Outlets. \\nSpacious rooms that come with a couch (at least in the king bed room).\\nAveda bathing products.\\n\\nMy overall feel is that this is a very nice hotel that is trying to be a resort, but there are not enough amenities to bring it to full on resort level. The hotel site says the $25 resort fee is optional so see if you can get that knocked off your bill before you book. Parking, internet and resort fee can easily add another $65 to your room fee so if you can get any of those comp'd, the daily rate becomes much more palatable. Would I come back? Yes, but only if it was for a couple of nights max since I wasn't feeling the food options."},{"name":"The Pizza Press","address":"6079 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Celebration","stars":"4.5","text":"Worst pizza I've ever had in my life.

I heard so much about this meatball that I was expecting it to be the best meatball ever, but to me it was just ok.  For the main course, we had the rib and the mushroom risotto and Shrimp risotto.  The rib mushroom risotto was really good and the risotto was really flavorful.  The shrimp risotto was a little bland.  The shrimp was good but the risotto needed a little more flavor to it and could have been a little creamier.

After talking on the phone some more he put the money in his drawer and when my boyfriend tried to clarify our order and subtotal, the owner said my bf had not given him any money and owed him $21. I heard voices getting raised after I sat down so I got up to see what was taking so long. I insisted to the owner that my bf had given him a $20 bill.

My friend asked the owner of the place if we could get a refund of the tip in cash so we could give it personally to the waitress. Initially, when we arrived the owner spoke English perfectly and we understood each other, because we had a conversation about Greece without a problem. In any sense when we were attempting to get a refund the owner acted as if she didn't understand English. All she said was, \\"what, what, I dun no u odo.\\" We repeated the order slowly and pulled up the receipt on the email, but she kept saying \\"what, what, I dun no u odo.\\" Then she double charged the credit card in addition to what had already been charged. Now we have to contact the bank to cancel the additional transactions. Either that lady needs to learn how to use her payment system if she plans on running a business, especially when she's been around for a while. Otherwise people need to be weary and monitor their credit card to make sure they don't get charged more than once. Also if you plan to leave a tip for the staff, make sure you give them cash because she will pocket the credit card tip. \\n\\nThe food and the attention from Erica & Herman the cook was EXCELLENT! \\n\\nAfter this crazy night we were not planning on returning, but Herman apologized for the inconvenience and said not to let this incident discourage us from returning.

Went to pick-up at scheduled time, only to be met with \\"You ordered it for pick-up on Thursday, you never showed-up, so we threw it away.\\"  First, who picks-up a Father's Day cake on a Thursday?

Figured we would get there early.  Went to Beerworks for a beer at 5 and the plan was to get to this place at 5:30....Well one beer led to another and we got to Sweet Cheeks at 6 and there was already a 45 minute wait.  So, be warned,  Early means early or be prepared for a long wait.  I have heard up to 2 hours.  Totally insane.\\n\\nAnyway, we got lucky and just as we went to the bar to get a beer for waiting, 2 dudes were leaving and we squeezed a chair in and the 3 of us sat at the bar immediately and were able to order beer and food.  Score 1 for that!\\n\\nThe bartenders were very nice and helpful.  They could tell we had not been there before.  The guy behind the bar could not have been nicer or more patient with us.  Really appreciated that from him.  He could have easily been a dick to us but he was not.  Makes a huge difference in an experience when something like that happens.\\n\\nOnto the food.\\n\\nBiscuits are as advertised and universally praised.  I agree with other parties of 2 being unhappy that they need to order 4 for $10 just to get them.  They are too big to eat more than one for sure.  But, it is a restaurant in business to make money...and if this is a featured item, they need to make the cash with their featured item.  Buy an order, share it with your neighbor or take some home.\\n\\nI had ribs with side of cole slaw and beans.  Ribs were 10/10.  The ribs come with no sauce.  I tasted their 3 sauces and none of them did much for me (-1 point for that) so I did not bother putting any sauce on the ribs but they did not need any, they were that good.  The beans were tasty (although they killed me later in the night for obvious reasons).  The cole slaw was nothing special.  Too much dressing maybe?  Too chunky?  Not sure but not worth getting.  \\n\\nOne friend got fried chicken based on recommendation from the bar keep.  It was excellent.  A lot of chicken in that order.  I hope you are hungry.  He also got a side of brisket to taste it.  It was excellent.  Needed BBQ sauce but as I said, I did not like their sauces.  The other friend got sausage and pork belly (another bar keep recommend, the belly that is).  Pork belly is everywhere you look now.  It was good, but I will stick to ribs for my BBQ experience.  Too much fat with the belly for my liking.  General feeling from friends on sides were same as mine...Ok but nothing to wait 2 hours for.\\n\\nBeer selection was good.  Place was a zoo with lots of excitement and energy.  Too many people packed inside waiting for tables.  \\n\\nI thought it was a bit expensive.  $22 for 1/2 rack of ribs with 2 sides and having to pay $2.50 extra for a biscuit makes it pricey for BBQ.\\n\\nBetter than my last trip to Redbones.  I would go again but I would not wait more than 30 minutes for a table.\\n\\nOh, one last thing.  As helpful as the bartender was, he had a nose ring which just bums me out.  I can't even look at someone to talk to them with one of those things.  Second nose ring server in one week.

Armed with an appetite and a hankering for pulled pork, I came in, ready to take on what Sweet Cheeks would throw at me...\\n\\n... which ended up being dirty mason jars (mine was stained a bizarre shade of orange and had little crusty things on it... and unfortunately was filled with water before I could even say anything about the unsanitary condition) and sadly disappointing food. \\n\\nNot all of it was bad, though! In fact, some of it was great--like those giant biscuits with honey butter. (One was enough to feed two adults and then some. One also costs $3, so you'd probably be better off ordering the 4 for $10, if you can eat that much.) And my diet Coke was swell, too. \\n\\nThe rest of it, though, was \\"take it or leave it\\" quality, and, quite frankly, I think I'd leave most of it. The fried green tomatoes were decent... I could really eat only one slice (came with six)... and, fair warning, that white creamy sauce with which it came had a bit of a kick to it, which was nice for me, but could potentially scare away some others. \\n\\nI ordered the pulled pork (okay) and the broccoli and cheese casserole and farm salad as per Yelpers' recommendations (both were all right, though I did enjoy my casserole a bit more with the habanero sauce provided at the table). My tray also came with two slices of thick white bread... but, uh, I didn't eat either of them. They did not look at all appetizing on my tray. It is pretty pricey for BBQ (bill came out to $60 for two, before tip), but the portions are definitely HUGE. I left with a TON of leftovers... as in, almost my entire meal. \\n\\nI think this experience could have been much better if I had enjoyed any of the sauces at the table... one was barbecue (but tasted so strongly of... beer? that I refused to eat more than a few bites of meat with that on it), one was a vinegar mix (tastiest of the bunch, but so watery I couldn't really eat too much of it, either), and the other was the aforementioned habanero hot sauce, which was good, but definitely mean to your stomach.\\n\\nWhen the best part of a restaurant is the bread and the diet Coke, that's not so hot.

He  left helming the kitchen there a while back to create what is now Suerte. With his departure, I never felt the meals I've had at Odd Duck since were as consistently on par or as good as when Sam was there. That's just one of the reasons why I've been eager to check out his solo venture. It also doesn't hurt that their executive chef, Ferm√≠n Nu√±ez, has previously worked at Launderette and the now closed East Side Showroom (RIP), two places in town I've had some great meals at.\\n\\nI first came here maybe in their first or second week of bbeing open and a second time two weeks ago. Both times they were operating like a well oiled machine. My server on the first visit, Monte, was and is excellent. The server on our second visit was good overall, though I did keep getting the feeling we were being up sold a bit.\\n\\nOn to the food. Masa is definitely their focus and in many ways the star of each dish. The quality and distinct flavor of their masa is better than any that I've had in Austin and on par with what I've had in Mexico. I love how seriously they take it and it shows. Thus far I've had their Chips Con Lentils & Yogurt, Chorizo Molotes Con Gribiche, Green Chorizo Tlayuda, Chicken Mole (which they changed the name to Roulade - apparently people in Austin were confused by Mole that was not dark in color...sigh), Goat Rib Barbacoa, Al Pastor Tacos, Grilled Sweet Papas, and two desserts: If You Got It Flan It and Chocolate Churros.\\n\\nAll dishes were good to varying degrees, but my hands down favorite both times was the Green Chorizo Tlayuda. It has such wonderful complexity of flavor and textures. I highly recommend this dish. The Chicken Mole/Roulade is excellent as well. The Goat Rib Barbacoa was decent, but I was expecting more flavor and more meat; the accoutrements were a nice addition though. I could do without both desserts next time, but I'm glad I gave them a go. The Churros were cooked well (crispy outside, creamy inside), but they were tiny and after just having had a freshly made Churro from a food truck in San Antonio the week prior, which was only $1 and was larger than the 5 churros combined here and tastier, these pale in comparison.\\n\\nFor drinks, I really liked their Federale cocktail (mellow corn whiskey, yaupon, cocchi torino, oloroso sherry, yellow chartreuse). So much so that I've gotten it on both visits. I've also tasted their Don Dario and La Chiquitita, both of which were good too.\\n\\nThe indoor seating is nice and open, but there is this one table I was seated at first, both times, that I do not like at all.

It was for our Valentine's Day dinner, and it rocked! Great atmosphere and lighting, great for date night. Service was professional and food was fantastic. Ordered 2 apps, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts = super full! \\n\\nAPP House-made charcuterie - The whole reason I wanted to come here. It was awesome and good for 2 to share. Served on a wooden board with 2 cheeses, 3 thinly sliced meats, 2 pates, lardo on bread, 2 picked vegs (green tomatoes and cucumbers today), and the grained mustard. It was so good with a small of beer (1/3 of a pint), and I definitely paced and savored each bite slowly. \\n\\nAPP Wild mushroom manicotti - One manicotti stuffed with a mushroom filling and topped with a variety of mushrooms and chestnut chips. Interesting taste, tangy and woody but not too rich. \\n\\nENTREE Chorizo crusted cod -  Served with white bean puree and side of white beans. Topped with slivers of chorizo on a gracious serving of cod. Fish was perfect, and seasoning was great, especially with the sherry foam. \\n\\nENTREE Housemade tortellini - Worst part of the meal for me was actually the tortellini. It had a kale or collard green filling (wasn't stated on the menu), but it was in a cioppino broth with lots of local seafood. The tortellini didn't go well with the rest of the meal, but the rest of it was better. It was a little salty. \\n\\nSIDE of truffled fries - It was $3 for a side. WORTH IT. Served in a pint glass, and it was very salty and truffle-y, and perfect accompaniment to beer. \\n\\nDESSERT Apple fritters - Great presentation, so cute! Little tiny glass of cinnamon milkshake with two straws, next to 5 little apple fritters dusted with powdered sugar in a box, and a little side car of caramel sauce. It wasn't amazing but still good; would just rather try something else. Milkshake didn't seem like a good idea when apple fritters were so sweet already; it got lost. \\n\\nDESSERT Trio of sorbets - Our waitress gave us an exorbitant list of ice creams and sorbets (would be easier to read them rather than ask her to repeat at 50 flavors again), but I settled on three sorbet flavors (blackberry, pomegranate, and coconut-lime). They were very zesty and flavorful. Would recommend if you want a nice palate cleanser or light dessert. \\n\\nVery exciting restaurant, can't wait for my second meal here."},{"name":"Greek Village Restaurant","address":"3577 Lake Emma Rd, Ste 111","city":"Lake Mary","stars":"4.5","text":"You had me at flaming cheese!

My mother and I consider ourselves somewhat amateur todmon 'aficionados' (yes, I get the oxymoron!), having had it at the source as well as every Thai restaurant on our bi-coastal visits.  The todmon was very well seasoned, but the excessive use of flour to plump up the cakes to burger-sized medallions took away from the impeccable flavors; textually, it was just thick dough with very good keffir lime and curry flavor.

We were there with the tuxedos, but the staff were, let's say, unaware others had made this commitment.  Then there was the umbrella.  \\"There's an umbrella in the closet in your room.\\"  But there wasn't one.  They delivered one to the room after it had stopped raining.

I got the Mixed Gyro, Chicken Tikka with rice, garlic naan, Aloo Gobi, and sweet lassi.  (Yes, a ton of food--I'm pregnant, so you can imagine).  I started with the gyro.  I opened the take-out box, and... there's no gyro.  What was there was even better.  Instead of rolling all of the ingredients into a measly little pita, they FILL a box full of meat, rice, lettuce, shredded/diced pita (yes, like croutons, but soft!), and sauce... it's kind of like a salad, but light on the lettuce and heavy on the meat (just the way I like it!).  I ate way too much of that (couldn't stop eating it because it tasted so good), so didn't get to eat much else.  I did try the garlic naan (fluffy and delicious), the Aloo Gobi (potatoes and cauliflower), and drank most of my lassi (not very sweet--quite plain, but good).  The Aloo Gobi was different than what I am accustomed to, though I can't quite place why--I generally order this from Indian restaurants, and it is usually--spicier, I guess.  Pakistani and Northern Indian food overlap quite a bit, but you'll find subtle differences between Khyber and the majority of Indian restaurants in Columbus.  The first time I ordered Khyber was a few weeks ago, but I didn't bother to write a whole review for that order since I didn't like the food--and it was my own fault.  I tried new things, and just didn't like them (I don't like bones in my chicken, but let's face it--that's how the majority of the world eats their meat--with the bone in).  However, I don't doubt for one second that the food was made wonderfully.  This time around, I ordered food I was quite sure I would enjoy, and was not disappointed.

Minor detail.\\n\\nIt's quite confusing that the place is called Tamale House when tamales are not featured on the menu except as a dozen or have dozen in a separate box. I thought those would be the star of the place based on the name.\\n\\nAnyway, you've got a collection of standard Tex-Mex plates, plenty of \\"queso\\", a watery (but tasty) salsa, and lots and lots of fried things with that queso or \\"chile\\" (the ground beef kind) on top. I guess most people order these plates which are in the $9-11 range.\\n\\nWe had the nachos, rice, beans, tamales, and tacos. Spicy (picante) was at the absolute minimum.\\n\\nAmong that, the only things actually on the menu were the nachos and the rice & beans. The others were special orders - happily supplied at that - but you don't know what it's going to cost. Thankfully, everything was reasonable.\\n\\nThe service was a bit lackluster but OK. Our waitress was friendly and kind but left us with lots of little plates piling up.\\n\\nThe reason for the 2 stars is that the food is just, well, not all that good. It's OK but nothing impressed. I don't know but a lot of what we ordered seemed like store-bought at a Randall's (not even an HEB).\\n\\nThe tortillas were clearly not homemade. The beans tasted canned - again, not bad - just overly salty like canned beans.\\n\\nThe rice was OK. Dry.\\n\\nThe tamales were like the ones you get from the freezer section. They don't appear to be homemade either.\\n\\nThe taco was better, kind of. The shredded chicken was basted in a tomato sauce but then it was on that lackluster tortilla with some yellow-ish lettuce, chopped (flavorless) tomato, and cheese shreds like you get in a supermarket packet.\\n\\nThe nachos were a disaster. The guac was somehow not right - like it came out of package instead of being homemade. There were the same cheese shreds as mentioned earlier, the canned-like beans, and the chile which was finely-ground beef with a tomato-based sauce and extremely greasy.\\n\\nAside from the nachos, we weren't disappointed, per se, but we expected the place to be more, well, Mexican. No cilantro, no limes (only lemons), no onions on the tacos.

The place is always packed when I go and for good reason-the food is exceptional. \\n\\nMost dishes are pretty small and ideal for sharing and leaves you plenty of room to taste several different dishes and tacos. On this trip I tried for the first time the El Governator taco. Usually I'm not a huge fish fan but I was feeling adventurous and I'm so glad I was. The quesillo sauce served as perfect accompaniment to the fish (and it didnt have a fishy flavor at all!). My go-to, however, is the lengua taco which never disappoints. Honestly, I could 10 of them alone and be happy. The meat is cooked to tender perfection and the simple ingredients of tomatoes, refried beans, and corn tortillas combine together for flavor perfection. Speaking of the corn tortillas they are the best I've ever had! I usually am not a fan but I don't know what it is about the tortillas at Suerte but I eat them by the basket when I'm there. To finish out the meal, I ordered the pork y huevos dish. Another go-to of mine, this dish reminds me of down-home cooking at its finest. What's not to love about slow-roasted pork, potatoes, a delicious broth and a side of those delicious corn tortillas to wrap it all in. I firmly believe that there isn't a bad or mediocre dish on the menu at Suerte and I can only imagine how delicious the lunch and dinner offerings are. Do yourself a favor and add this place to your brunch rotation in Austin.\\n\\nPro-tips: ALWAYS make a reservation so that you aren't stuck waiting forever for a table and make sure to take advantage of the complimentary valet parking on-site."},{"name":"Doc Chey's Dragon Bowl","address":"1556 N Decatur Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I had to attend a class at Emory and beforehand, wanted something healthy and quick.  I'd been to Doc Chey's on N. Highland years ago, so I decided to give it  a try in the Emory Village as a lone diner.  Unfortunately, this place just did not have its stuff together.  May have been an off night, but there were multiple service/kitchen fails, and they weren't even really busy.  So here's how my meal went.\\n\\nI walked in and was greeted by the host, who promptly took me to sit at the community table in the back, about 3 feet from the bathroom doors even though there was plenty of other seating available.  I don't generally appreciate being forced to eat next to restrooms, but I figured I'd just deal with it--after all, I wanted to be in and out.  About 3 minutes later he came back and requested that I move.  It was pretty awkward, a la \\"Ma'am, would you move to that table over there?\\" no explanation, just kind of demanded that i pick up all my stuff and menus etc. and move.  Okay, no big deal.  Again, I was just here for a quick meal.  So I sat down at my new seat. \\n\\nMy friendly female server greeted me and asked what I would be drinking, which she came back with a few minutes later.  At this time, another lone diner was seated at the community table across from me, facing me.  The server came back a few minutes after that and took my order, which was soup, shrimp rolls, and Spicy Szechuan Stir Fry.  She asked if I'd like it all out at the same time, and I said yes since I wasn't looking for a leisurely dinner.  At this point, I'd been at the restaurant for about 10 minutes.\\n\\nAbout 15 minutes later (yes, I was timing it--I did have a class to get to) I got my soup and my shrimp rolls, and it took me about 7 minutes to eat it--it was tasty, but way too salty for my taste.  I stacked my plates and moved them out of the way so that I could go over some notes.  And I sat.  and sat.  About 10 minutes later my server came over and asked how I was doing, and I told her I was just fine.  She asked if I wanted more to drink, and I said no, but she said, \\"I'll get you a to go cup anyway\\", and casually asked if I was just going to hang out for a little longer.  I let her know that I was waiting on my stir fry, and she said that she had assumed I'd already eaten it.  Nope, I said, I was still waiting on it.  At this point, the lone diner across from me had finished his appetizer, meal, and was paying the check.  Total time at restaurant so far:  about 45 minutes.  \\n\\nThe server said that in that case, my stir fry would be right out.  She left the table and the host approached seconds later and hastily removes my unused utensils and napkin from in front of me.  I let him know that I'm still waiting for my food, and he puts it back down, no \\"i'm sorry about that\\" or anything.  10 more minutes go by.  No stir fry.  \\n\\nThe server comes back over and tells me that she is very upset with the kitchen, that she has just put a rush on my food.  Now, I worked as a waitress and eventually restaurant manager for about 10 years while in college and afterward, so I know that if I was responsible for someone waiting this long on their food, I'd get a manager to take care of it--not only in the kitchen, but on the check.  But my server just said, \\"I'm upset for you.  Please don't take it out on me\\".  We were very friendly with each other and I assured her that I knew all about kitchen mess ups from my years in restaurants.\\n\\nOkay.  5 more minutes go by.  I finally get my food.  This \\"Spicy Szechuan Stir Fry\\" is made up of veggies and beef literally swimming in a salty-sweet (everything but spicy) brown sauce.  I eat some of it and then ask for a to go box.  I receive my check in full, which I pay and tip the waitress just under 20%.  I walked out the door right past the host and he ignored me completely.\\n\\nTotal time at restaurant:  1 hour and 20 minutes.  Bill:  $24.00 including tip.  \\n\\nAs I write this almost 6 hours later, my fingers are so swollen from the salt that my wedding ring won't come off my finger.  \\n\\nI will never go back.  I wish I had gone to Tin Drum across the street.  I left feeling ripped off."},{"name":"Doc Chey's Dragon Bowl","address":"1556 N Decatur Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Horrible change to the menu.

It's the kind of place you show up to just to eat. Don't expect five-star service or eye-pleasing interiors. There are no bells and whistles here. The quality of the meats is also what you would expect from a typical Asian buffet. All this is well and fine.\\n\\nWhat I do take issue with are two things: \\n(1) They only have two options for broth--spicy and non-spicy. Boo. I like and would expect variety, especially from a buffet, but this place just doesn't offer that. \\n(2) You can't make your own sauce. They give you what I presume is their house sauce, which really isn't anything to write home about. It was so not memorable that I couldn't even tell you what was in it. Half the fun of hotpot is playing food chemist and mixing up all your favorite flavors into the ultimate dipping medium. Not an option here. \\n\\nAgain, Hot Pot Buffet is a good place to go if you're hungry and looking for a place that's open late to fill you up. Otherwise, I'd suggest one of about ten other non-AYCE hotpot places in Chinatown and not too much farther away in the Allston/Brighton area that would provide a more memorable hotpot experience."},{"name":"Renaissance Orlando at SeaWorld","address":"6677 Sea Harbor Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Our stay was less then impressive.

We had a reservation but when we walked in, the place was practically empty. Only 4 or 5 tables were taken at the time. \\n\\nThe only positive things here are the decor and atmosphere. It's clearly a new restaurant so everything is clean and shiny. The bar stools and tile are nice touches as well! \\n\\nThe rest of our experience was pretty terrible. With the way our dinner went, this placed will be closed within a year.  I am seriously going to discourage everyone from coming here. The negatives:\\n\\nService -  The waiter was kind of blah. There wasn't anything particularly terrible about him but he had zero energy. After we ordered our appetizers, they tried to give us something we did not order.

It's very likely that if this place stays open long enough to actually be busy, it'll be an absolute s***show\\n\\nFood - This was probably our worst restaurant food experience in a long time, if not ever! The menu is very uninspired and boring. There is not a lot of variety and all dishes are heavy and unoriginal. We decided to just order a bunch of appetizers because none of us could actually decide on an entree. Honestly nothing sounded good enough. The most disgusting thing was the pork pate. Honestly, beyond gross. We all smelled and prodded the giant blobs of the \\"pate.\\" I mustered up the courage to try it and let's just say it was not enjoyable. The arancini was decent but not anything mind blowing. The mussels were also fine, and we thought the broth was decent enough to dip their bread. We all were disgusted with the food.\\n\\nPrice - Absolutely overpriced for the food and the area. The feta and strawberry salad ($14 I think) was about 95% arugula. They definitely sliced the shit out of one strawberry and sprinkled it over the arugula. There may have been feta cheese somewhere on the salad, though it may have been invisible so we did not see it. The crab cake ($17) was one fishy blob of crap. Honestly, we took one bite and left the rest. We did order some drinks so our bill was higher because of that. We had a few drinks and some appetizers. It came to over $200 plus tip. Seemed pretty steep for garbage food.\\n\\nDon't come here, honestly. It seems promising but it'll just disappoint.

I ordered a glass of wine and the boar and short rib bolognese gnocchi . The meal came quickly, but the quality of the meal was very poor. Both meats (boar and short rib) tasted like they had been warmed in the microwave and tossed around in red sauce. The gnocchi was of decent quality and the cheese served on top made it tasty, but not the quality I expected given the price. I barely ate the meal, and it was whisked away. I was not asked how the meal was once. I then ordered dessert (coconut pound cake with charred lemon sorbet) and although it took a very long time to arrive (the restaurant has picked up at this point as it was 6:15), it was very good. Once again though, I was not asked how it tasted. I then waited about 15 minutes for the bill, paid and left.

The music didn't match the decor or the vibe but this was on a Monday afternoon and not on a Friday or Saturday night. Parking is nothing short of a nightmare as is with all places in the Pearl,  so I would suggest to arrive earlier so secure good parking.

To me, the food gets 2 stars. \\"Meh I've experienced better\\" indeed.\\n\\nThe customer service gets 0 stars.

Ordered 10 wings and asked for extra celery and it came with 2 sticks. Asked for my extra I paid $0.50 for (listed on ticket) and the lady behind the counter (manager, not one of the other workers) gave me like 4 more sticks. Claimed celery is expensive (it isn't, its like $0.99per bundle of like 10 big stalks). Wouldn't give me more, and wouldn't give me an option to buy more, instead said it was $2 and should've ordered a box, and acted like the transaction was over. Acted like it was my fault for not being an expert on their menu. The manager obviously cared more about harsh business tactics and what cost J Buffalo Wings $0.10 worth of celery than making an impression on me or inspiring any loyalty to this place.\\n\\nI only go here out of convenience and as a last resort, there's like 2 dozen wing places I'd rather go to, including Taco Mac and Zaxbys(!?)."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"1726 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"2.5","text":"Something AWFUL has happened to Chipotle recently and it tastes NOTHING like it used to.

I wanted to reward myself with a nice lunch.  I thought it was my opportunity to finally try Franklin BBQ, but at 11:30 there was already a mob at the trailer (I'll never get to try them!).  I remembered then that Jack and my new Yelp friend Joel liked Which Wich, and I trust their opinion.  My only concern was if my fogged brain could deal with building a sandwich.\\n\\nI was very pleased to find how simple it was!  Like Sandwich Building for Dummies.  They have the menu (and the options on your bag) laid out according to meats (turkey, pork, chicken, etc), cheeses, condiments, and veggies.  You just go through and check off what you want.  I got the Grinder, which was all those tasty salty Italian meats like salami, with pesto, cukes, peppers, and lettuce.  With chips and a drink, it was $8.50.\\n\\nI decided to eat my chips on the way home, and you know you're starving when a Baked Lays is the best thing you've ever put in your mouth.  I even stopped at a Yellow Light (!) to have more time to get the crumbs outta the bottom of the bag.  But that small bag of 13 chips did nothing to sate me.\\n\\nI got home and enjoyed my sammie out in the sunshine on my back deck.  I have to say, I was pretty proud of myself!  It was delicious!  It was toasted and crunchy on the outside and melty inside.  The veggies were fresh, with the bell peppers giving a nice gardeny crunch (sorry Colin, I just ruined it for you).  The only thing lacking was an offsetting sweet flavor.  My sammie was loaded with tangy, spicy peppers and it woulda been nice to maybe have some roasted red peppers to get the full spectrum of flavor.  I don't recall anything kinda sweet like that on the menu (cept nasty tomatos).  Also, I'm leaving the lettuce off next time.  A few slivers of iceburg is just taking up pepper space.\\n\\n*** I was gonna end my review right there, which woulda earned them 4 stars, but as fate and bad karma would have it, I found myself being called back into work again Sun afternoon and I stopped in again to try a different sandwich to go.  This time I had turkey with bacon, avocado, provolone, spicy mayo, carmelized onions, and bell pepper.  This one was a disappointment and I don't think it was my sandwich building skills but the ingredients.  The turkey was your run of the mill, plain thin white turkey, pre-packaged Jenni-O like you find at the grocery store, and other than offering turkey salami or turkey rueben, I wish they would offer better quality of turkey or smoked turkey, something with flavor.  Also, don't bother paying an extra buck for bacon.  I'm pretty sure that was Bacon Bits or some such baconoid product.  No strips of real bacon here, and the spicy mayo...wasn't.  \\n\\nJust goes to show ya, you should try something a coupla times before judging."},{"name":"The Busy Bee Cafe","address":"810 Martin Luther King Jr Dr SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Now this place is very busy!\\n\\nI was informed by some locals that this was a must go to place in Atlanta. \\n\\nIt was across the street from Walmart in the side of town where Morehouse college was. \\n\\nWow, it was very busy and small and crowded.  \\n\\nI ordered the chicken, okay and Mac n cheese.

The ceviche was set and firm, cooked in liquid, and especially bc these 2 were served together, it even emphasized the sliminess of the shrimp. Does your average foodie know aguachile is raw? Should it taste THIS raw? It felt wrong and inedible. I guess this point is more subjective.\\n\\n- There was a yummy dessert w a blondie and some mass of something creamy on something creamy.

It gives you, the customer a real experience how the kitchen works in synergy and how your dish is prepared and inspected before landing in front of you. \\n\\nSince I wasn't too hungry, I only tried two of their dishes: quesadilla tetemada and suadero tacos. Both were spectacular with Mexican herbs, spices and flavor. What I did notice was that the dishes were a bit on the salty side but I wasn't sure if it's just me or a Texas thing. All the food I've had during my stay was always on the saltier side. To pair the dishes, I ordered their horchata, which is mixed with sweet potato.

From the hostess, waiters and waitresses, and even from Vikram Vij himself, we felt very welcomed.  \\n\\nAside from the greetings and hospitality, when we put our name down, the hostess (over)estimated the wait time to 1.5 hours.  It is highly recommended to make a reservation, but we didn't mind the wait because we got to wait in the lounge area, which was a highlight.  \\n\\nIf you can find an empty seat/table in the lounge, you can order some drinks/appetizers to enjoy while you are waiting for your table.  The highlight of the lounge is they pass out some small bites for guests to enjoy while they wait.  We got to enjoy some pakoras and another small bite before we got called for our table.\\n\\nAfter waiting about a half an hour, we were called and seated to our table.  After looking at the menu, we decided to try a dish from each section.  Fortunately, Vij's offers \\"small plates\\" for all the main dishes if you would like a smaller quantity.

I'm tempted to dock it a star because it does not warrant the good ratings given here, doesn't warrant the large crowds that flock there, and doesn't warrant endorsement from half-assed, wannabe Yelp foodies like myself. But I digress.\\n\\nThe menu is extensive, making it worthy of the Cheesecake Factory reference, as does the restaurant's epic physical proportions, seeming to occupy at least three adjacent storefronts in a strip mall location.\\n\\nI was tempted to order something outside of the familiar offerings, maybe the \\"award winning cabrito\\" or a riff on migas served \\"San Antonio style\\" with carne guisada. Both sounded promising, but my mission was to benchmark the fare to weigh in on an ongoing discussion among friends about the place. So naturally I ordered a combo plate.\\n\\nI gotta say, the portions were huge, nothing was off-putting, and I didn't have massive diarrhea later that day. That's all good news, but that's about as good as it gets in this review. The food was an exercise in \\"meh.\\" Meh-gasmic, if you like. \\n\\nLet's see here... the crunchy taco was serviceable and included a nice amount of cheese, lettuce, and goodies overflowing onto the plate. The enchilada came with an old-school red chili sauce. I might respect that but it was bland, and a brown chili gravy or chili con carne might better fit the \\"Texican\\" theme. An unremarkable tamale came similarly smothered in enchilada sauce, to equally unremarkable effect. The Spanish rice was somehow less flavorful than the plain white rice I make at home, though it was not dry and hard, a common Tex Mex sin. The beans were serviceable but forgettable. The queso was queso and the guacamole was pleasant - not overloaded with lemon to keep its color stable until the apocalypse. A small salad of lettuce and tomato was not overlooked, which is key in mixing up with other ingredients for taste and texture. I can't remember if there were other things on the plate but I can forgive myself for any oversight in light of the sheer quantities present. \\n\\nI have no doubt that some people will have a deep affinity for this place as a source of plentiful comfort food. They won't want to hear me snarkily mock its mediocrity. They don't need my opinion to know how they feel about the Texican, and won't appreciate a review that explores the gray areas between judgments of good and bad. But for those of you without an attachment to the place, let me whisper in your ear: You can do better - eat at any number of other old-school Tex Mex institutions and newer upstarts run by and for locals.\\n\\nAnd with that, I jump off to leave the true believers to enjoy the food here, because the popular vote (represented by the busy crowds here) is more important than my contrarian critiques."},{"name":"The Ravenous Pig","address":"565 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"Never disappoints!

Awesome thai food but a tad pricey with smaller portions. We dropped by today as a group without reservations and were lucky to be seated right away. We tried couple of dishes as follow: \\n\\nPad thai  for $15. Decent portions to share between two people as a snack. However, I was very disappointed that it wasn't spicy enough nor was it peanutful enough for the group's liking. Would only recommend if you request more peanuts and up the spicey level.\\n\\nGreen curry lunch combo $12. It came with fried wonton skin on a bed of thin green leaves. The green curry itself stood out to me. Very creamy and coconut heavy which I liked. The chicken was tender with loads of ginger to spice things up. However, I do wish the rice was coconut rice though. \\n\\nAppetizer $10 for 6. AMAZING. I forgot the name of this dish but it was on their recommended list. It's a mix of peanuts and some other small treats wrapped in leaves, drench in housemade sauce. MUST TRY. I believe this item will be a must order for me when I visit this restaurant. I loved it a lot. \\n\\nFried rice for $15. Pretty regular fried rice with eggs, soy sauce and tofu? Though the garden tomatoes stood out to me. It was perfectly sauteed, but not entirely mushy. Again, I wish it was spicier. \\n\\nTom Yum Goon $15 for large. Highly recommend!!!! Very flavorful and pungent, not for the faint hearted. It was a tad sweet for me so I would have preferred it to be more sour. Nonetheless, delicious tomato based soup! Again, not too spicey at all. \\n\\nCoconut Jasmine Rice $4 a bowl!!!! This was ridiculously priced in my opinion. We would have opted for other options if it costed this much for a small bowl. Moreover, it was nothing special. \\n\\nOverall, I would order the Tom Yum Goon and the appetizer again.

Was somewhat disappointed (almost false advertising) there's no pig on the Ravenous Pig's tasting menu.  I like trying many things at a new restaurant, I can't help myself, started with the Bread Plate (pretzel bread/taleggio fondue, gruyere-chive biscuit/smoked salt butter, spent-grain sourdough/poached pears).  The biscuit was the best of the three, flaky and butter, a little aromatic from the onion-y chive, and rich from the gruyere cheese, pretzel bread was very darkly brown, very chewy (in a good way) like a bagel, nice with the cheesy, salty, fondue.  Spent-grains (from the brewery's mash) sourdough was chewy and sufficiently tart for sourdough, the least indulgent of the bread sampler (yes, it just seemed too healthy).  Also, off the regular dinner menu, got the Portuguese Sardine Crostini (sauce Romesco, fennel-orange, frisee, Spanish olive vinaigrette), pretty large fillets of fresh sardines, grilled and served on thick, toasty bread.  The vinaigrette was nice and tart and complemented the oily, fishy, fish very well.  From the Magical Dining menu, started with the Steak Tartare (blue cheese tart, pickled maitake mushrooms, figs, shallot, lemon curd, basil).  The meat was ground quite fine, had not much texture to it, was interesting on top of the cream cheese-based short crust tart (overwhelmed the meat a little, all the creaminess).  The sweet fresh fig was a nice sweet touch, as were the slightly tart pickeld mushrooms, but I did want for a little more contrast in flavors, like more zip in the lemon curd, or something punchier (parallel to the traditional mustard and capers).  Had the Beef Shortrib (with brown butter mashed potatoes, and roasted mushrooms) for the entree.  Was not quite like any shortrib I've previously had.  Generally, you expect a braised or slow-roasted either parallel or cross cut section of the plate (with actual rib bones).  This was an English cut with the meat removed from the bone to look like strip steak, was somewhat stringy, but beefy in flavor, not quite fall apart tender, and covered in a sticky, sweet glaze.  Desserts were microscopic, served in precious teensy canning jars.  The Chocolate Tres Leches somewhat less moist than what I expect of tres leches (which in my mind should be dripping with milks).  The peanut butter ice cream garnish did moisten things up some, but certainly, we could have used more of it.  The Horchata Panna Cotta was smooth and light and had the requisite flavors (cinnamon and vanilla, slight almond flavor from rice), and a nice contrast with the crunchy, puffed rice garnish).  Service was very professional and efficient.  The Magical Dining menu was a steal for the quality of the meal.  The hipster farm-to-table trendiness seems a little out of place for central Florida (the land of monster chain restaurants and commercialized happiness), but we recently moved from the northeast coast, so this is pretty much what every new restaurant is shooting for."},{"name":"Tin & Taco - College Park","address":"2429 Edgewater Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"I'm so happy there is a Tin and Taco in College Park now!

They're nicely steamed versions of hot dogs and buns you could get at the supermarket.  They're cheap, and they're good, and if you've got a craving for a hot dog, definitely grab one there, but don't expect something unique and mind-blowing.
