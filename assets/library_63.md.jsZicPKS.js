We were both extremely hungry so alas!!! Maki Maki...We gave it some thought and came up with Maki Maki for all you can eat sushi... This place is great.. You actually order what you want off the menu, only thing is, it's unlimited!!!  \\n\\n     As we arrived, there was more then ample parking in a private lot with a large lot next door too.... The exterior was easily seen as their name is large and in neon which helps as the restaurant is set back off the street. \\n\\n     We entered the building and there is a foyer with large neon water effects which are breathtaking, and as you exit the foyer the reception area is directly in front with a room off to the left a bit of a quite room and to the right is a beautiful bar with some fruits available in front. There is also a small room in the back which I assume is a small function room for approximately 25-30 people tops. I only know this because they sat us in this box of a room with dark walls and nothing good to look at. This was totally ruining my whole sushi experience and we haven't even ordered. As we sat there looking at one another wondering why we were in a closet of a room they brought in a large party of about a dozen people including a couple kids an 2 babies, one of which was already crying. \\n\\n     As if this was not bad enough, the staff was hustling to accommodate the large party all the while ignoring us??? They brought them over 3 or 4 pots of tea, struck up conversation with them as we sat there amazed and tea less. \\n\\n     I grabbed the waiter and asked told him we need to move to another table and he abruptly pointed to a different table in the same cubicle of a room we were in??? Geez, what's wrong with these people??? I then told him that we need to be seated in the main dinning area where the beautiful bar and sushi chefs were located. To my surprise without a pause they said sure and brought us to a great table and our experience took a total180. \\n\\n     Now comfortably at our table with a great view of the bar, the tv and virtually the whole place we settled in to consume some sushi.  \\n\\n     We started with a few appetizers, \\n\\n     Tuna Tartar and Salmon Tartar, both were very pleasant to the eye and tasted pretty good.\\n\\n     Next we indulged in The Peppered Tuna and the Tai Jalapeno both were extremely pleasant to the eye as well as very tasty. The tuna was nicely displayed in a star formation topped with a little spicy mayo,tempura flake, masago, ponzu sauce and scallions. The Tai Jalapeno was comprised of Red Snapper (my absolute favorite) topped with jalapeno, sriracha, and a special yuzu sauce. The snapper just melted in my mouth and had just the right amount of hot. Make sure to try this dish!!!\\n\\n     We then proceeded to order a variety of Sushi & Sashimi including Ebi/shrimp, Tako/octopus, Maguro/tuna, Kosho Maguro/spicy tuna, Sake/salmon, Hamachi/yellowtail, Tai/red snapper and Tombo Ahi/albacore tuna. All of the Sushi and Sashimi was of good quality and cut perfectly. My favorite of all was the Peppered Tuna which was absolutely worth the drive to Woburn. We also tried a variety of rolls which were very good but no comparison to the Sushi and Sashimi.\\n\\n     Feeling very satisfied but with knowledge that it is \\"all you can eat\\" we decided to try a few meat items. First of which was the Steak Tataki  a rare steak in ponzu sauce. I would have like to see the steak cut much thinner and with a different sauce. I wouldn't order this in place of any thing else on the menu. Now on the flip side, we also ordered the Beef Short Ribs which were perfectly marinated and grilled. These were some of the tastiest Short Ribs I've had and rival the ribs I've eaten at the restaurants in Korea Town/Los Angeles. We had 2 orders they are a must try!\\n\\n     They served a nice green tea ($1. charge) and a variety of deserts some included some for a small charge. \\n\\n     Once we were seated in the main area, the serve was top notch, quick, precise and polite. When arriving I would highly advise asking for seating in the main dining/bar area as the d√©cor is wonderful, pleasing and enhances the dining experience trifold.\\n\\n     This is a great place to really fill the belly with high quality Sushi for a very low cost. For a party of 2 we spent $75. However we did not order alcohol. Also because of it's atmosphere (main area only) this would be a great place for a date or mingling.  \\n\\n     Definitely bookmark this place if your a Sushi fan!!!"},{"name":"Umi of Japan","address":"Sq One Shopping Ctr","city":"Saugus","stars":"2.5","text":"Kung Pao chicken, oh my glob they have the perfect spice level on this.

I realize this all sounds like sarcasm but I've worked restaurants and I'm a New Yorker; sometimes it's just too damn busy to keep talking to [fill in your own descriptive] - really, the brusqueness is fine.\\n\\nAnd it was kind of the only thing that was BECAUSE - lo and behold, about 10 minutes later, up shows a guy that looks like... remember that SNL sketch with Jimmy Fallon as the college kid on a webcam, and his stoner friend played by Horatio Sanz? I swear that was this guy. I go to open the door and HE'S LAUGHING.\\n\\"I kept calling the WRONG number!\\" he manages to chuckle out. A few times.  And okay, it's funny, but dude, this wasn't paid for by mom and dad. This was our earned-at-work money, and maybe not laugh about kinda ruining our meal and wasting our time and money? \\n\\nHe says he'll tell the boss what happened, and hands over a rumpled, somewhat soggy, definitely not-at-all-hot paper bag and mushy-bottomed pizza box. My guests get back from Burger King, where they bought things to eat and we heat up the stuff in the bag, stick the pizza in the oven. Everything was soggy and mediocre.\\n\\nAnd you know, that would have been fine had what used to be the standard response for something like this had occurred: a phone call from the manager/owner the next day, apologizing for his driver being too high to read a phone number correctly multiple times AND offering an app or two on the house with our next order (please note: NOT a refund, though that would have been appropriate, but just an appetizer. SOMETHING.)\\n\\nNeither of those things happened, and that shows the integrity and class of this place. And so, my cautionary tale.\\n\\nAnd a suggestion to instead order from Big Daddy's or Little Pizza King, both of which are class acts and offer AMAZINGLY good authentic NY-style Italian."},{"name":"Talad Thai and Lao Street Food","address":"1606 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"5","text":"Great Thai food.

At first, I thought he was racist against and we had brought in 100+ customers to HIS bar one night. Totally ignored us for 15 minutes and another customer for 30 that he hadn't served at all (multiple people in our group complained along with others at the bar). Came over and told us we were cut off. Then followed us to other bars spitefully  to tell other bartenders to cut us off without having previously interacted with us at all.  Disrespectful, irresponsible, and downright unforgivable behavior on this part. Literally, I do not know of a human being this bad and its appalling that people would go out of their way OFF OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY at their job to do such a thing (yes, he does have the power to cut off people he has served before, but the manager agreed that his actions were completely uncalled for). \\n\\nClass act by Hugo and Daniel (the managers at the time) to rectify the situation, but Ryan's behavior was unacceptable and he was unapologetic. To their credit, the venue is good, they have a good vibe, but Ryan was ABSOLUTELY classless. The level of his disrespect is palpable and sorely reprehensible. \\n\\nI issue a warning to all prospective patrons, do NOT go here because nobody deserves disrespect and prejudice from Ryan of this magnitude. If he's not working, its a decent place to be. If he is working, you might wait in line for the DMV and get a drink before he will serve you one. \\n\\nFour stars for Hugo/Daniel and the venue.

I say accidental because they confused Cinco with another Tex-Mex place.  I have not been before this visit, so I was down to try a new restaurant.  I should have checked Yelp first as it was only 3 stars when I checked after being seated.\\n\\nThe restaurant is very nice looking with very interesting decor, but I'll stop there because I really just care about the food.  On first look through the menu, my instincts were telling me this place wasn't going to be good.  Take a look at some of the menu item descriptions and you'll see what I mean.  I am always down for something new and I am usually not thrown off by odd combinations of ingredients since there are a lot of great chefs out there with strange ideas that just work.  Cinco has made me more weary though.\\n\\nAfter taking our drink orders, the server brought out chips and salsa?  It was the darkest, thickest salsa I have ever had and I'm not talking about \\"New York City!\\" made bottled salsa from the supermarket.  This was the strangest, but not necessarily bad salsa I have ever had.  I just had to ask the waiter what was in it and we were told it was roasted veggies and the color is different based on how roasted they were, indicating their salsa is not consistent not only in color or flavor.  It's just the strangest salsa I have ever had at a Mexican or Tex-Mex restaurant.\\n\\nThen we ordered:  lobster and shrimp queso (alright), steak fajitas (more on this), and the burrito grande (what I ordered and... yeah).  The queso was good and the seafood in it wasn't \\"fishy\\", but it was nothing to write home about (especially for $9).  The steak fajitas were lacking to say the least.  There seemed to be no seasoning on the meat at all, which some people may like.  It's all up to preference, but I like to season my meat a little.  Then there's the burrito grande:  chicken, chorizo, refried beans, ans some other stuff.  I love chicken and I love chroizo, but MAN!  This thing just tasted weird, which I would blame on the refried beans.  (note: I like refried beans and Taco Bell is good so back off!)  The mix sounded interesting, but I was just not impressed and slightly thrown off by the flavor mix.  The chorizo was there, but there was no chorizo at the same time.  That should have added a good kick of flavor and heat to the burrito, but I was wrong.  It just ended up half eaten and that says a lot coming from me as I don't like to leave much on the plate, let alone not take it to go (which I didn't).  The rice and beans (both black and charro beans) also left much to be desired.\\n\\nI'll stop here because I feel like I'm bashing this place now, but I don't think I could work myself up to go again to give it a second chance for some other items.

Their fried rice is also delicious!  One thing to note is if you are doing AYCE, your entire table must agree to do the same.  If you can't agree, their a la carte menu ($10) bento boxes are great too!  Only thing that I wished they did was sashimi and offered Yellowtail but that's minor because their salmon is really fresh and their rolls are inventive and delicious.

The meat was pretty good, though the stuffing of sun-dried tomatoes with gouda and prosciutto was a little too creamy, so it seemed more like velveeta had been used instead of gouda, and it overpowered the meat.  Similarly, the mac and cheese was so thick that it was practically sticky.  I mixed it with the collards, to provide some texture.  The collards were decent - nothing fancy.  I think the dish improved with time, particularly since my leftovers had more of the meat and less of the stuffing, and I let the components mix together in the microwave, which improved the mac and cheese, in my opinion.\\n\\nThe service was friendly, but somewhat inattentive - water glasses went empty, and then it took quite a while before we could flag someone down to get the check.\\n\\nAll in all, it's not bad, but I doubt it'll be a place that I think of to recommend in the future."},{"name":"HKYK Seafood Hot Pot Restaurant","address":"4260 No 3 Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"2.5","text":"My friend and I came here on one of our day trips to Vancouver.\\n\\nMy first impression walking in was that the place looked old and the wallpaper stained.

My host graciously suggested this place just a few blocks down the street, as it had a kind of chill atmosphere that I could relax in after my long drive.\\n\\nI had arrived a day earlier than my friends, so I had to dine solo for the night - I grabbed a seat at the bar, and started looking through the menu. The bartender came by promptly with some water and corn nuts as I pondered my decision, and also helpfully made some suggestions as I wrestled between the pork chop and the fried chicken. He noted that the pork chop was quite different from other places though, as it is brined and cured in cider before it's cooked on the grill. The inside would be a little bit pink because of this, which freaks out some people, but it is thoroughly cooked. Well, that certainly sounded like something I'd never had before, so I settled on that. \\n\\nMy host had told me the hard drinks were quite good here, but I was so tired that night that I knew if I had anything to drink I'd pass out right then and there. I ordered a wildflower honey soda to keep me company while I waited for my food, and it was just okay. Not really my cup of tea. It made me start to doubt what this pork chop would be like. When the pork chop arrived, it looked delicious. No sides or anything, but it was a huge serving size so I was ready for it despite those earlier doubts. The moment I bit into it... HEAVEN. It was AMAZING. There was a hint of sweet, and a mix of savory, and the most tender meat in the world. The bacon jam that topped it also added to the flavor profile, and I was the happiest little girl at the bar by herself devouring this massive piece of meat. I was won over immediately.

It was not too heavy and did not have an overwhelming taste that you might expect.  The only part I thought was a bit too much was the sausage which was just a half of a sausage tossed on it.

Anybody who ever hears about it thinks of when Dimebag, a former guitarist from Pantera, was shot and killed here a few years back. I mean, I guess that was a pretty big deal, but I think it's sad that that's this venue's claim to fame. It's also weird to think about a nationally known musician coming to Columbus and someone shooting him while performing on stage. I'm not a Pantera fan, but I know a lot of people who are still really upset about that whole incident.\\n\\nI guess there's really something to be said for security at concert venues. But if you think about it, other places in the city don't always do any security checks. The Newport doesn't and LC Pavilion usually doesn't. The Alrosa didn't because it was such a small venue, but it's changed. I came here to watch my friend's band perform and they have definitely upped the security. There are police officers and you will get searched when you enter the building. I don't mind it, and I guess it's kind of nice to see that they are taking such precautions. Something like that happening twice in this place would shut it down for sure. I'm not sure that the one incident has stopped the people from coming, but I know some people have said that they are nervous about seeing a show here. My response is that Alrosa probably has the best security out of any venue in the city now.\\n\\nAlrosa Villa is sort of out in the middle of nowhere. It's north of Morse Rd. but still inside 270. I don't even remember how to get there. But there isn't much around it, and it doesn't look like much from the outside. It's small and dingy and I'd never give it a second though driving past it if I hadn't heard of it before. Very popular bands do not play here. It's just not big enough for a large crowd. But sometimes they do feature bands that you may have heard of, like Cold or Taproot. But what I think is cool about this place is that local and struggling bands typically play here. Like my friend's band. It gives them a chance to play in front of an audience and be heard. And it was really nice to see my friend perform onstage and be so close. I've never seen any other show here but his, and that's because Alrosa, from what I've heard, mostly features metal bands. I'm not exactly into that sort of thing, but if you were, you'd probably love it here.\\n\\nThe night we went to my friend's show, we found our way out here and the parking lot was covered in snow. We found a spot but no one could see where the lines marking each spot were, so we had to guess like everyone else. When we went inside we had to show our tickets at the door (our friend had given them to us) and go through security, which consisted of a pat down and a quick look through our purses. They also checked our IDs and gave us bracelets. Then we were in. And man, this place is kinda scary. It's dark and dirty and small. The front area where you walk in has the bar to the left and a seating area to the right with tables and chairs. Straight ahead was the stage and a big open floor for the audience in front of that. It was really dark in there, but it was lit up more towards the front.\\n\\nWe went around talking to friends since most of the people there were people we knew, and decided to grab a few drinks at the bar. But my friend that was driving was a bit nervous about getting anything to drink since those cops were right there, so he limited himself to one. But as it turned out, the rest of us did too, because the drinks were not cheap. I supposed they were typical of any concert hall, but still, we decided to go out somewhere else later instead of blow all our money there.\\n\\nMy friend's band was playing after a few other bands, but I didn't really feel like going down towards the stage and watching them. They were all heavy metal bands and people were moshing and getting all crazy by the stage. And there weren't that many people there. Maybe 40 or 50. It looked sort of silly seeing such a small crowd of maybe 6 or 7 try to start a mosh pit. I don't know if that's what it's like at most shows here, but I don't like that kind of environment. I don't understand. You come to a live show to see a band and enjoy the music, not to thrash around and hit other people, right? I guess that's exactly why some people go to concerts, but for me, it makes my experience quite a bit less enjoyable when I'm trying to watch a show.\\n\\nAnd when my friend's band came on stage, that's sort of what happened. We got right up to the stage since the crowd was so small, and my sister and I were taking pictures of him onstage so he could see them later. Yes, they did let us bring our cameras into Alrosa. And then you had these crazy people moshing, screaming and thrashing all over the place. Several times I was bumped or hit and almost dropped my digital camera. And if it was that bad with a crowd so small, imagine with a big crowd! It was a good show, but not really my style."},{"name":"Bibo's Philly Cheese Steaks","address":"10175 SE Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Very surprised at this sandwich cart.\\nI ordered the Philly Cheesesteak and\\nIt didn't disappoint.

Apologies ahead of time if I got any dish names wrong. \\n \\nFirst up is the \\"Lo mi ji\\" which is steamed glutinous sticky rice wrapped in a lotus leaf. Inside the rice are sparse pieces of chinese sausage and chicken. Not very much going on flavor wise, the chicken has a basic soy sauce taste and the chinese sausage tasted like a chinese sausage. The texture of the meat is rubbery, and is not high quality. The rice itself is okay, it is sticky and one of the more satisfying dishes overall,\\n \\nNext up are the beef balls. This is essentially a beef meatball. Exceptionally soft texture, almost glutinous. Doesn't really taste like beef to me. Dipping it in hot chilli oil or the mustard adds some flavor, but nothing remarkable here.\\n \\nMy friend ordered several shrimp dumplings with chives and spinach. I was only able to try the shrimp chive dumpling. I'm sensitive about seafood, shellfish in particular and if it has been frozen or isn't fairly fresh I feel a distinct irritation in my stomach. After one dumpling I knew I couldn't eat any more shrimp dishes. But even if you're not as sensitive as I am, again nothing remarkable here. Shrimpy taste, add sauces for some complexity. \\n \\nShumai has soft texture. Tastes of pork and salt. Again, not much going on here. \\n \\nI haven't had congee since my trip to Hong Kong and this was lacking. Winsor's congee is watery. Congee should have an almost oatmeal like feeling when eating. Furthermore, needs more scallion and ginger. Meat is rubbery, but the addition of the century egg is interesting. However, it tastes like they used stock from a can. If not, they need to improve their stock/congee base as it was reminiscent of the salty staleness one finds in a can of progresso. \\n \\n \\nThe fried turnip cakes with xo sauce has slight char taste on the outside with a cabbage taste overall. Reminiscent of okonomiyaki, which I appreciated. The bean sprouts also add a nice texture. I enjoyed this dish second most.\\n \\nBean curd roll with oyster sauce. Not much flavor here other than some pork and bamboo. The roll is laid in a shallow pool of watered down oyster sauce. The sauce has no flavor other than a mild sweetness. \\n \\nLastly was the salted egg yolk bun. This was without question the best part of the meal. Hot sweet rice flour bun with hot salty sweet egg yolk inside with a hint of peach. If there wasn't such a long wait I might come here just for this. But I think some of the nearby bakeries might offer it. \\n \\n \\nI understand our options for Cantonese style food are limited in beantown. But, if Winsor is the best Boston has to offer I recommend you hold off on Dim Sum. Perhaps take a weekend trip to New York and visit Flushing if you want a better experience. I will not be returning to Winsor Dim Sum."},{"name":"MJ O'Connor's","address":"425 Summer St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Live yelp.

It's got good body, good flavor, and definitely deserves to be mopped clean by the roti (or rice if you're really hungry). It's complex, bold, good by itself or even dipping fried chicken in it. The roti is not all that impressive here - needs more layers, but will suffice for your carby needs.\\n\\nThe fried chicken is pretty impressive - no idea what coating they use to give it the texture it has, but I very much enjoyed the juiciness of the chicken and the flavor profile, especially with whatever sauce it comes with on the side.

I like their Granny Smith ravioli and Caesar salad. The other 4 dishes  I have tried have just been ok. I landed on the Granny Smith dish because a kind server recommended it strongly. My main incentive for going here is the walking distance but the thing that limits me from going  even more is their difficulties with answering their phone. I mainly get takeout. Frequently I call during business hours and no one answers. Many times I've called and someone puts me on hold for an ungodly amount of time, I hang up, call back and then no one answers the phone.

The restaurant opens at 5:30 on Mondays. I call at 5:36 and a woman with an accent answers. While looking at the menu I order. She tells me they no longer make that dish and that just today they changed the menu which is on the website only. I said ok and click the website link on my phone to see the menu and order.

It was truly the best of meals and the worst of meals, all rolled up into one. Let's tease out the intertwined aspects.\\n\\nPrice. I'm immensely grateful for PDX serving food at street prices, without a screw-you airport markup (as does, for example, SeaTac). Being able to buy a burger that costs about as much as a burger is something not taken for granted by the frequent airport traveler, so there's that.\\n\\nConvenience. Burgerville's preparation was quick but mindful enough that they asked me to wait for a fresh batch of fries rather than serve the existing supply. I'd expect that from a neighborhood restaurant but not of a fast-food place pushing food to hungry, rushing travelers. Kudos to the kitchen staff.\\n\\nService. Friendly, patient, cheerful, and wonderful at explaining the aspects of the menu (which, when you think of it, they have to do hundreds of times a day as waves of passengers flow on by). Nothing but really good thoughts about Burgerville's service.\\n\\nTaste. In the end, this is the bit that matters most. The burger I had was competent, adequate, filling. The meat could've been more caramelized or crisped, to bring out the umami. The add-on ingredients were all ok, but there was a lack of salt, or acid, or something to make the whole thing pop. The bun just held things together without much fanfare, which felt like a letdown. A quick swipe of mayo and a moment on the grill and it would have been a party in my mouth.\\n\\nBurgerville seems to be the go-to burger chain in Oregon, much like In-N-Out is in Central/Southern California. (Neither chain holds a candle to Little Big Burger (OR), Five Guys (west coast), or, swoon, Super Duper (CA).)\\n\\nI'm glad I had reasonably inexpensive, filling food in an airport. That's what matters on a hectic travel day. I wish I could've had a four-star meal; it was *so* close, and could be done for a few moments of time with the existing ingredients at hand, and perhaps one day I'll ask to step into their kitchen and show them how it's done :-)"},{"name":"Pikliz International Kitchen","address":"288A Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"This restaurant will have your taste buds dancing and screaming for more.

They even had a bin near the door that said \\"Park Your Yoga Mat Here\\" or something like that, though no yoga mats were parked.\\n\\nNow for the food. Their avocado toast was a joke. In fact, it was the worst avocado toast I've had. There was barely any avocado on it, the bread was thin and the center was soggy, and there was little to no flavor. One of the managers stopped by our table to ask how everything was and I simply told her the \\"avocado\\" toast had little to no avocado on it. She said there should be a much higher avocado to egg ratio which was not the case at all. She offered another toast on the house which I respectfully declined. The thought was appreciated and I share this story merely to warn you that this might be the case should you order their avocado toast or, if they prepare it the way I was told they should prepare it, it could be better. Either way I will not be ordering it here again.\\n\\nOn the other hand, I would recommend ordering their Mother Earth Bowl and especially trying some of their mix n match sides, though some were a bit too salty.

Maybe they're going for 80s nouvelle minimalism or Floyd's was just running out of pork that night and spreading it thin.  Who knows but that combo with a drink and tip will kill a $20 bill and for that you shouldn't be feeling wanting or asking questions.\\n\\nI liked the tacos but should have ordered three, they're small.  Wonderful fusion flavors there and the beans and rice were nice.  \\n\\nWe all liked the brisket but it was a bit fatty, have to say.  Otherwise, it boasted a really nice smoke ring and really nice smooth, mild smokey flavor.  Very tender too and the barbeque sauce seemed original and tops in flavor.  Maybe they par cook quasi smoke their brisket but I never seem to have that much fat when I do it at home.\\n\\nMy paleo-type table mates of more conventional BBQ liking didn't like the fusion menu or the slaw or the tortillas that came with the combo.  Both were under the false impression you get two sides plus the tortillas and both felt roped into getting just one side and slaw - which we were later told by the waitstaff is really just a garnish, not a side.  Anyhow, they would have been happier choosing their own two sides and having a sub or Hawaiian roll in lieu of the tortillas.  That's how square types should like order it, I think.\\n\\nExcellent, very attentive and highly involved staff.  There's been a wait each time we've been but it moves right along and we've always been able to get a table.  Street parking's not a problem.\\n\\nMaybe it's a question of high quality versus value but I've been living in the Mills50/ViMi District for years.

The taquito of the day was filled with pork and something I can't quite remember the name of. It was so delicious though! The outside had the perfect amount of crunch and the filling was so flavourful, I wish I could remember what the other main ingredient was! The dish came as two large taquitos for $6 which was totally worth it.\\n\\nThe cubano was not much to look at but was so wonderful to taste. Might not have been a good idea to order another very pork-heavy dish with the taquitos, as the cubano is soo meaty (which is perfect if I was a bit hungrier that day). I really enjoyed it anyways though, I usually hate pickles and the one in this sandwich didn't taste like a typical pickle and had a bit more of an interesting kick. Came with a few tortilla chips on the side we just dipped in the salsa that came with our taquitos. I definitely want to come back and eat this again when I have more of an appetite (ate too many tacos earlier in the day when we visited).\\n\\nAmbiance was more loud and bar-like, but it wasn't so loud that I couldn't hear when someone spoke to me.

I arrived at 3:45pm to zero line on a Friday (good time), and ordered the 1/4 thigh and drum which came to over $10 with tip. This is way too pricey for two pieces of chicken. Juke is $2.50 less and you get an awesome Asian slaw with. And Duffins which still reigns supreme is like $4.50 for two pieces. If you haven't gone to Duffins GO! DL chicken came on a stale/toasted (honestly not sure) piece of Wonderbread, no sides. There were some pickles tossed on top which were okay but again nothing to write home about. Let's get to the flavour though. All I tasted was cayenne pepper and lots of it, I ordered hot because I love spice. But there's a way to do spice and still have flavour. The chicken wasn't seasoned well with salt. It tasted like there wasn't any in fact. The skin was crisp but definitely oily. I am so curious to taste Nashville hot chicken in Nashville because this can't be it. And if it is, I'm not a fan. On top of that, my thigh was boneless...boneless! Don't give me fried chicken without the bone unless it's s breast. Bone is where the flavour lives. I'm really curious as to why they opt for boneless thighs, such a mystery.

They make sure their customers are taken care of which I appreciate but sadly don't think I'll be back for the chic.\\n\\nUPDATE - I'm going to give this joint 4/5 now due to the sandwich!

I enjoyed the food and sauces so much, I came back twice during my stay in Orlando!\\n\\nI really like the fact that the menu is basic.  Sometimes it can get overwhelming when trying to decide what to order.  There are only 5 burgers to chose from (one of them being vegetarian), chicken tenders, salad bowls (who in their right mind would come here to order a salad bowl though?!?!), and signature sides.  \\n\\nOn my first visit I indulged in chicken tenders, guy fries, and fried pickles.  The sauces I tried: curry mayo, garlic parmesan, and habanero hot sauce. \\n\\nLet me start with the chicken tenders.  They are HUGE and fulfilling!  I ordered the 3 piece but in hindsight the 2 piece kids meal would have been more than enough.  They are DELICIOUS! I've never had tenders so moist before.  Come to find out, it's because they are brined in fresh lemon juice, pickle brine, buttermilk, and infused with their fresh herbs.  \\n\\nThe fried pickles were a disappointment though.  I would say skip them.  They were more like soggy pickles.  But, the guy fries were good so that made up for it.  The fries are tossed in some sort of cajun seasoning which is what made them so good.  \\n\\nThe sauces I tried: habanero hot sauce was a disappointment unfortunately.  It tasted like a regular bottle of hot sauce, nothing special.  But, the curry mayo and garlic parmesan on the other hand were out of this world!  I seriously wish I could buy that stuff by the jar to take home with me....\\n\\nOn my second visit I tried the Big Bite B.L.A.T. which included crispy smoked bacon (no joke, it was SUPER CRISPY), lettuce, avocado crema, tomatoes & buttermilk ranch.  This burger was REALLY good but my only complaint is that they put a little too much lettuce on it but other than that, I was surprised at how crispy the bacon was.  The burger was simple but packing in flavor.  \\n\\nAnd on this visit I tried the chipotle ranch sauce.  It was good but not out of this world like the curry mayo and garlic parmesan.\\n\\nSide notes: the loaded mac daddy mac n' cheese was a disappointment.  Sadly, the mac and cheese got hard real quick.  Also skip the frozen treats, they taste artificial and way too sweet.  \\n\\nWith all being said and done, I seriously can't wait to go back for the tenders and amazing sauces again."},{"name":"Turner's Seafood - Salem","address":"43 Church St","city":"Salem","stars":"4.5","text":"I was eagerly awaiting a delicious meal after all the hype given to the establishment by local Tours and yelp reviewers, but sadly I was very disappointed.

My friends and i are from a coastal state therefore  we are very familiar with seafood dishes and quite enjoy them. Every dish lacked flavor and originality. The Service was poor, my glass was constantly empty and I had to ask for my own refill twice and the third time I didn't even get it. Apple cider sangria was also underwhelming with only one slice of apple and five cranberry pieces. When manager came we were told that it was unfortunate that we had Different taste buds than others that had been there. The interaction with the manager was very odd I found her to be quite immature and she did not handle herself in a professional manner. I would've happily added more detailed reasons on how to make the food taste better but her body language was not open to any conversation.

But I had no idea how exited I was going to be until I ate there. I have lived in PDX for over 6 years now--and have yet to find a good Indian restaurant on the west side. Having moved here from Boston (where there is an abundance of great indian food), I have been seriously disappointed in the lack of good curry to be had in PDX! Indian food was like an addiction for me before I moved. SO I am thanking my lucky stars that Choice of India moved in a few blocks from me. It the fist really home-cooked and authentic, high quality Indian dishes I have had in years. Since they opened I am there every weekend (and sometimes during the week), working my way through the menu. I have yet to be disappointed in anything I have tried, but here are some of my favorites. First of all, their Lamb Rogan Josh might just be the best I have ever had--even before I made to the west coast. It's rich and complex, with dark and savory stewed curry sauce and great tasting chunks of lamb. My fav so far. Next, there Baigan Burtha (the eggplant curry) is definitely the best I have ever had. With juicy fire-roasted eggplant mashed into a rich curry paste with peas and (I think) onions, I could eat this dish every single night. I seriously crave it all the time--it's addictive. \\n\\nAll of the tandoori dishes are to die for--tandoori done the right way: moist and flavorful meats marinated and served simply as the center of the dish. I won't list everything, because everything is great, but the one last must have on the menu is there vindaloo. It's amazing and wonderfully spiced--just perfect hotness to have a good kick without losing the complexity of the curry. I will also add that the staff there is really wonderful, They are so friendly and welcoming--it really makes it feel like a neighborhood place. \\n\\nIf you want to know what real home-cooked curry and Indian cuisine is like--or if you miss the real deal here in PDX--give Choice of India a try and I be you will be completely addicted like me.

For an appetizer, we ordered the pimento cheese fritters, taste-wise, they were super tasty, but they were barely lukewarm and I didn't like that the three fritters served us were 3 different sizes, one was much larger than the other 2. Unfortunately, our food took over 40 mins, almost an hour, this was surprising given that the place was not full, the manager did come by and apologize. Two of us ordered the fried chicken and waffles, the waffles definitely out shone the chicken. The chicken was underwhelming, very bland and the coating on my chicken was not really on the chicken, one of the pieces was missing the fried coating on a whole side. The waffles, on the other hand, were very tasty, well seasoned and cheesy, however my waffle was not a full waffle, it looked like the batter had over flowed and it was more of a 3/4 waffle, given the price of the food and the quality that the restaurant clearly strives for, I would have hoped someone would have noticed and thought twice about serving that to a customer. My friend who ordered the half rack of ribs, really enjoyed them, he said they were delicious.\\n\\nMaybe for someone who isn't familiar with southern fried chicken, this place will do, but after living in TN and eating hot fried chicken on a regular basis, I was disappointed, honestly the chicken was just not good.

Prices are a bit expensive, but the value is definitely there... for the food at least. \\nDrinks are bad for the price. Size is normal, but the drinks are really powdery. And thats pretty much all you taste. I got to try the Almond Powder Milk Tea and Japanese Milk Tea.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the Salty Fish and Chicken Fried Rice. \\nPortion is good enough to share with 2-3 people. It was for sure one of the best Salty Fish Fried Rice I ever had. Normally the dish is pretty bland aside from the saltiness from the fish. But here, every part of it is seasoned. They don't low ball on flavor. Based off that dish I assume this place is legit, and simply just not a place where people go because it is open late.\\n\\nParking is free.

Instead, having to order from the sheet of paper, we over-ordered. \\n\\nALSO, my biggest disappointment was I couldn't keep the dishes straight as to what they were, since time pasted between ordering and the dishes being brought to the table. I don't remember the names, thus pictures are \\"loosely\\" labeled. \\n\\nWe got our drinks first, of course. My taro bubble tea with milk was not very good. The tapioca balls had an odd flavor - not sweet. Most of the plates, however, were tasty. Liked the potstickers, the crab rangoon was great, and the shrimp balls were on the addicting side. We did try the mango buns, and the mango pur√©e was more paste, kind of a grittiness to it that wasn't too appeasing; obviously a personal preference. \\n\\nLike I said, there were several really tasty dishes that we devoured. But not adhering to the traditions of \\"dim sum\\" (no serving carts circling with different small plate- plus no prices on that special menu, made the smile fade."},{"name":"The Smoke Shop BBQ - Seaport","address":"343 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Just paid $36 for a pint of burnt ends and a draft Trillium.

I knew from the time we walked in the door it was going to be a weird night. We was seated around 7:30pm and placed our order 25 minutes later. It was 7 in our party to include two toddlers. Not only did we wait longer than hour to receive our food one order came out then 30 minutes later the other 6 showed up. So much for eating as a family. Once we finally received our order it was missing items or different than what we ordered off the menu.  None of the food was worth the menu price. Once we got our bill we questioned a few items and it was justified. So we waited about 15-20 minutes later to give payment to the waitress but she never came back so we left the cash inside the black folder like you would at any other resturant and went to our car. As we were strapping the kids in their car seats the Manager and the waitress was at our window questioning my husband about payment. They had him walk back inside to our booth to prove payment was left. Had the waitress checked her book all of this could of been avoided. They assumed our large party walked out without paying. Instead of her looking in the black folder to see if the bill was paid they assumed our large family of 7 walked out. Not only did I feel racially profiled but also embarrassed because they made my husband walk back in to the booth to show them we left payment. Had she been doing her job right the first time none of this would have been encountered. I will be calling corporate office to handle this matter since the manger on duty didn't show any remorse for embarrassing my family. I do feel like because we were a black family they assumed we would walk out. If I'm ever in the area again I'll never step foot in this resturant nor would I recommend it to my friends and family. Our bill was over $100 and 75% was taken home in boxes. Very very disappointed on how my family was treated on our Disney vacation. Not to mention my husband serves in the army so why would we need to walk out without payment?

Strawberry Fields (one of their \\"famous\\" ice ball drinks) for me and a Lindacello for hubby. Both were good but I think the only alcohol in mine was the prosecco.

Tables, walls, chairs, etc (with the exception of the seating along the walls). The selection of food is great. They have all types of burgers and food. Beef, Turkey, Chicken, Shrimp Po'Boys, Chicken Tenders, Veggie Burgers and several other things on the menu. The pricing isn't bad either. Probably around $8 for a decent burger. I personally tried the Shrimp Po'Boy. It had a certain sauce on it that made it taste even better. I wish I knew what it was but it was sweet and savory. The Shrimp Po'Boy was a great choice. I must say that I am impressed by this place. They even have a hand washing station near the fountain drinks/sauce bar to wash your hands instead of running to the restroom if you are a messy eater or get grease on your hands. What a great idea.

The pulled pork and brisket were very good, extremely well seasoned and both paired with the pineapple salsa nicely. In both cases the meats were the standout part of the taco, and less is more when it comes to adding stuff in. We also got a chicken taco and a ground beef taco. The chicken was decent, but lack luster following the pork and the brisket. The ground beef was ehh, and part of that is what I paired it with, but in the end it seemed that a ground beef taco that I could have made at home is better left to be made at home. Overall the food was good and I would eat it again... I would just stick to the pulled pork.\\nFor me, the biggest negative to the experience was the atmosphere. It gives the appearance of a converted warehouse which means everything is loud, and you feel like you are shouting to the person across the table just to be heard. Most of the tables are long communal tables that they try to keep space between you and the next group. And for lack of better way to describe it, the wall mural was a little off putting. I get that I may be a little outside of their target age bracket, but space meatballs with hair capturing spaghetti is weird, and a little unappetizing to look at.

It's not the embarrassment of having recommended your bar as a stop along the Harvard GSAS Grad Student Residence Hall Pub Crawl last night, or being with several other students who were excited because I had highly recommended your establishment, that really gets to me, but that in all of the screen shots I have of your website, your twitter page, and outside your restaurant on that day, there is not one indication that an American well over the age of 21 with a government-issued ID would be required to have 1) traveled to the world or 2) change citizenship to enter into your bar. I'm suspicious of what your doorman and your manager, AJ, said - that the policy was started on that day - and I remain confused about how my Michigan driver's license is not, as your website indicates, \\"proper 21+ ID.\\" I find it a sad reflection of our society when my mom - who I also brought to your bar once - encourages me to appease you. And frankly, while I understand according to Massachusetts policy that you have the ability to deny entry based on this criteria, and as a U.S. citizen with government-issued ID over the age of 25, I am very concerned with your inconsistent application of this policy. This lack of transparency and tact will further discrimination in this community. I will continue to share this experience with others in the Harvard community and beyond in my network.

Very tender pieces with orzo that was so flavorful, but not overwhelming in that way that pesto can be. \\n\\n\\nBreakfast was just okay. Their scones -- they have daily flavors which you get a sampling of for free when you go in -- were lavender. They were divine! It was clear that the lavender was fresh. \\n\\nThe three stars are for their baked goods.\\n\\nThe actual breakfasts, at least for people who don't eat red meat or pork, were not good. And, if you notice, most of the 5 stars on Yelp are from people who eat meat.\\n\\nMy egg sandwich was very overcooked. The eggs were rubbery, flavorless, and without salt. And you know that adding salt after the fact is not as tasty!\\n\\nOf note: I don't eat red meat or pork, so I ordered the egg sammy without meat. Two notes on this: 1) If they are counting on meat to give the sandwich flavor (and saltiness), then they need to account for this when the sandwich is ordered without it.\\n\\n2. They offered \\"braised greens\\" in lieu of the meat. Nice. Except that the greens were in no way braised! They were bitter and flavorless. Braised means to cook in some kind of fat and then simmer in stock and hopefully mix with something like vinegar and sugar -- anything to balance out the bitterness. This was not done. The greens were very bitter.\\n\\nTogether, the overcooked eggs minus salt, with bitter greens and just a small amount of cheddar cheese was just meh.

Is it a diner to take the family after church?  Is it a company happy hour meetup place?  Is it plain and simply a dive?  I can't figure it out.\\n\\nWe came here a lot for football, being Vikings fans and looking for a place to watch the game.  In that regard they held up quite well, but it's not your typical TV setup as 90% of the screens are lined around the inside of the bar.  If you're sitting at a table there are limited views.  But they happily changed the TVs to meet our needs.\\n\\nThe restaurant half of the establishment is a little quirky.  They have gone for the 60's Motown feel with a bunch of records taped to the wall.  It just reminds me too much of a college apartment, not much creativity involved.  Sure, there are old records surrounding me.... what am I supposed to do with that?  It's really not putting me in any sort of nostalgic mood in its current arrangement.  They once blared 60's music over football on a Sunday afternoon which even the staff was annoyed by.  Whose idea was that?!\\n\\nThere is one female bartender who is outstanding; one of the very best I've seen.  She's super attentive, friendly, and working very hard for her tips.  The rest of the staff is pleasant as well, but I'm sure you'll quickly find the standout team member here.\\n\\nI really like that my dog is welcome on the patio.

You guys need to cut the bullshit. Again. Been going there for over a decade. Weekly. NEVER EVER have I seen a god dam bug. Or a flippin fly. Or even a f-ing nat. You are all full of it. Regarding you all commenting on the service. You anal retentive shits suck. What kind of service are you expecting for dam $9 entrees!!! Again. Been going there fir YEARS. never a single \\"issue\\" with the staff.  Never.  If your looking for 5 service go to Capital Grill you dip shits.  But.  You're probably too dam cheap to go there. You'll probably complain about that too and makeup more false yelps. Dam. That was therapeutic.

OMG, why did I wait so long to go here? I absolutely loved everything about this place. Guac y Margys is located on the Eastside Beltline, along with so many other bars, and Restaurants, but this one is totally the most fun!\\n\\nI knew about this place a long time ago when I found their \\"Harry Potter Week\\" event, and I finally got to go this year (2019). The Harry Potter Week consists in potions classes, trivia night, sorting hat party and even a Yule Ball. If you're a HP fan you'd totally love this!\\n\\nMy boyfriend and me decided to go to the Potions Class & Sorting Hat Party. IT WAS LIT Y'ALL! The sorting hat part or \\"Sorting Margarita\\" consisted in a drink that turned a specific color to determine which house you belong to (Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Slytherin, or Hufflepuff). My boyfriend got a yellow one for Hafflepuff, and I got a blue one for Ravenclaw. \\n\\nAfter that, we proceded with the potions class. The potions were delicious and potent drinks. So basically it was like a bartending class. We learned how to make HP themed drinks including: Polyjuice Potion, Amortentia, Love potion, Felix Felicis, and Fire whiskey, and yes, we got to drink all of them!\\n\\nThe tickets were about $30 and included the Sorting Margarita, Potions Class, chips & house-made salsa. We also bought some tacos and they were pretty good, but pricey ($50 for 5 tacos, and chips and dip).\\n\\nThe staff is great, and they seem to have a lot of fun at work, and sometimes that makes the different. I'd totally come back next year for Harry Potter Week.\\n\\nESPA√ëOL\\n\\n¬øpor qu√© esper√© tanto para ir aqu√≠? Absolutamente me encant√≥ todo sobre este lugar. Guac y Margys se encuentra en la Beltline, junto con muchos otros bares y restaurantes, ¬°pero este es el m√°s divertido!\\n\\nConoc√≠ este lugar hace mucho tiempo cuando encontr√© su evento \\"Semana de Harry Potter\\", y finalmente pude ir este a√±o (2019). La Semana de Harry Potter consiste en clases de pociones, noches de trivia, una fiesta de sombrero seleccionador e incluso un baile de Navidad. Si eres fan√°tico de HP, ¬°te encantar√≠a esto!\\n\\nMi novio y yo decidimos ir a la fiesta de clase de pociones y sombrero seleccionador. La parte del sombrero seleccionador o \\"Margarita seleccionadora\\" consist√≠a en una bebida que cambiaba de color espec√≠fico para determinar a qu√© casa perteneces (Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Slytherin o Hufflepuff). Mi novio le sali√≥ uno amarillo para Hafflepuff y a mi una azul para Ravenclaw.\\n\\nDespu√©s de eso, continuamos con la clase de pociones. Las pociones eran deliciosas y potentes bebidas. B√°sicamente, fue como una clase de barman. Aprendimos a hacer bebidas tem√°ticas de HP que incluyen: poci√≥n multijugos, Amortentia, poci√≥n de amor, Felix Felicis y whisky de fuego, ¬°y s√≠, pudimos beberlas todas!\\n\\nLos boletos costaron alrededor de $ 30 e incluyeron la Margarita seleccionadora, clase de pociones, chips y salsa casera. Tambi√©n compramos algunos tacos y eran bastante buenos, pero caros ($ 50 por 5 tacos y chips y salsa).\\n\\nEl personal es excelente, y parece que se divierten mucho en el trabajo, y a veces eso hace la diferencia.

Hops chicken is the reason why I question eating out at restaurant because of the lack of care with their product. First off, this is a fact, they are KNOWINGLY SELLING BAD CHICKEN. Chicken kept in a freezer should not be translucent, should not be green in color. The smell from some of this chicken made me and some of my former coworkers nauseous. Meat kept in a freezer should not and I repeat should not smell like it's been spoiling in a hot sun. That's just one health violation. Next, how do you take chicken that is funky and put it in the same contaminated egg wash with the rest of the chicken. Thats like bathing yourself in dirty bath water and expecting to come out clean. So once that stinky chicken goes in that egg wash all of the other chicken that touches it is shit. My coworkers and I had a saying we'd say to start our shift, \\"which chicken stink today\\". I worked their and wouldn't touch that chicken. I don't even blame the workers because they're just trying to do their jobs, however that owner clearly gives no damns.

Four people got drinks, 2 did not - we all ordered food. Sweet Hereafter was merely a place to get food en route to a show. Upon finishing our dinners and getting to our drinks and wrapping up before leaving, two of my AFAB friends went to the restroom. I followed shortly after, upon getting into the restroom we were immediately met with several violent, loud thuds on the door - thinking it was someone drunk and impatient - one of yelled \\"Be out in a sec!\\" Not even 10 seconds later we were met with the same violent, aggressive bangs on the door. We all looked at one another with the same thought of \\"Oh no, there could be something wrong in the bar.\\" My friend opened the door slightly to peek out and was pushed out of the way by the security guard who had on his person a body cam with the camera in record mode - at this time, the other friend was using the toilet.\\n\\nThe body guard shouted at us to finish the f*** up and get the f*** out immediately. We had no idea why. So upon asking and being met with his incredibly belligerent response of, \\"There's only one f***ing person allowed in at a time.\\" By this point we walked out of the rest room, confused and extremely embarrassed (all the patrons in the very loud bar had obviously heard the security guard shouting at us). He marched us back to our table while we asked repeatedly if A. He had a body camera on while our friend was using the bathroom which is, undoubtedly illegal and B. Why were we being kicked out so aggressively? There was no sign that the restroom was limited to one person at a time (we received confirmation that there was no sign from Jordan - the person tending bar that evening) was it necessary to draw such an extreme amount of attention three queer people using the restroom?\\n\\nSecurity guard then marches to our table where our three other friends are waiting and tells them to close their tabs and get the f*** out. I am at this point trying to get someone at the bar to close out my card which has become increasingly difficult as no bartender would come and help me until several patrons yelled to make it a priority to close me out.\\n\\nWhile this is all happening, SHA Security Guard turns his camera off while my partner asks why we are so aggressively and forcibly being asked to go. The Security Guard then uses my partners body to pick him up and uses him to open the door, physically kicking him out of the bar.\\n\\nFinally, Jordan, the bartender who I mentioned previously closes me out - apologizes excessively to me (while the rest of my party has been waiting for the last 10 minutes outside for this to happen) and tells me to come back the next day, Sunday or Wednesday when the Security Guard \\"isn't working\\" to get a drink on her.\\n\\nSince this event has taken place, at least a dozen people have left comments on Sweet Hereafter's instagram demanding an explanation for the use of blatant and extremely violent force. Those comments have since been deleted and comments have been \\"disabled\\" on photos. All members of the party that was there that evening have emailed Sweet Hereafter's management as well as talked to the head of Lightning Bar Collective. We have heard only initial emails from someone named Glenn who promised us that he would be reviewing the footage and getting back to us - that this matter would be taken \\"extremely seriously\\". I haven't heard a peep from Glenn which affirms that this is indeed, not being taken seriously.\\n\\nWhen I spoke to Bobby, head of security at Lightning Bar Collective - he said that the body cam that was recording my friend in the restroom was a tactic and that he didn't see anything wrong with the use of force that a member of his staff had used that evening. Hm, interesting. Again, recording someone in the bathroom is extremely illegal. \\n\\nI'd like to be followed up with as soon as possible and for this matter to be taken as seriously as Sweet Hereafter's management claims that it is."},{"name":"Swift's Attic","address":"315 Congress Ave, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Tried swifts attic with a party of 4 for the first time.

She tried them, and the onions slide out of the breading, causing you to either eat onion, or breading. Now understand we have eaten at Toojay's a lot. Matzo Ball soup is her go to dinner every time.

When I first arrived, I was immediately asked if I had a reservation. The restaurant was already full, so I waited about 30 min and was able to get a seat. CALL AHEAD! As I was waiting, I was given an area on the nearby banister / half-height wall, leading down to the bar area. Surprisingly, it wasn't that bad. I got a full view of the open kitchen, a hostess ordered a drink for me, and I really enjoyed watching the kitchen staff work.\\n\\nOur bartender was Jared, and he impressed me the entire night. He clearly had a thorough knowledge of spirits, wine, and food. A rare mix.\\n\\nCocktails + Wine\\n\\nOnce my friend arrived, we chatted for a bit. The hostess brought her a cocktail as well, and after a few minutes we were given a seat at the end of the bar. We both started with the \\"Northern Lights\\" cocktail, it had St. Germain, Scotch, citrus, Bittermens Tiki Bitters. We decided to go for the 8 course chef's tasting menu, and split it. I' do tastings once a month, they take 2+ hours to do, and many times it's hard for me to actually eat all the food served, so splitting a tasting menu for 1 actually works well for me.\\n\\nI next had a glass of Alsatian white wine, it reminded me of a riesling with a touch of wood (turpine, not oak), citrus notes, and a medium rounded body. It paired well with the first few courses. Next I had a glass of the Vin de Pays de Vaucluse 'Le Pigoulet en Provence' H. Brunier; a Provencal red with nice complexity of fruit and tannins. Followed later by a glass of Italian red, Sangiovese; a solid all round red, the most common grape grown in the area. Finally at the end of the meal, we finished each with a shot of W.L. Weller Bourbon, that has a complexity on par with a good Scotch, at a lower price. I was hoping for a \\"rusty nail\\", but oddly they didn't have any Drambuie..\\n\\nFood\\n\\nHonestly, I can't remember every detail of the 8 course tasting, however I was thoroughly impressed. This was one of the best meals of my life! Keep in mind, I cook things like beef bourguignon, duck confit, and frog leg curry, as well as going to tastings regularly.\\n\\nOne dish my friend and I found a bit odd was the scallops with asian pear. The flavors paired well, but the texture contrast of creamy scallop with fibrous pear was a bit weird. One of the deserts was a celery ice cream, and it wasn't bad, just a bit odd. The top highlights to me where the variety of fish served, the pork 3 ways, and the sweetbread! I love sweetbread / thymus gland of a cow or big generally...\\n\\nAtmosphere\\n\\nThe open kitchen really impressed me. I tell my friends, the mark of a top-notch restaurant is when they let you peer into the kitchen, because then they can't hide anything. The patrons are upper-middle class, lots of \\"new money\\", and a bit of \\"old money\\". The staff is very polite, and will usher you through the restaurant by stepping out of your way. Noise levels is moderate, I didn't notice any background music playing. Definitely a great place to get a nice meal.\\n\\nOverall\\n\\nI was thoroughly impressed by my time here, as was my friend.

What sets them apart from your typical ice cream shop are their quirky, outside the box flavors that are made with local and organic ingredients.\\n\\nFlavors that on paper would sound like they would make for terrible ice cream, yet somehow they miraculously work. Ice cream made with olive oil or a combo of pear & blue cheese certainly does not come to mind when I think about this dessert.\\n\\nDue to the shop's popularity, the line to get ice cream can stretch out to the street. However, the line seemed to move at a good clip. The shop inside was full of people reveling in their tasty ice cream selections. Be prepared to potentially have to take your ice cream to go. Not a bad idea if it is sunny outside.\\n\\nWhen it was my turn to order, I decided to go with one of those quirky flavors. I went with a scoop of the honey balsamic strawberry with cracked pepper on a waffle cone ($4.75). They do also have cups or regular cones if you prefer those instead. But seeing that the waffle cone is made fresh, I think that is the way to go.\\n\\nWhile the flavor combo sounds weird, it does in fact really work. It is still strawberry ice cream that tastes fruity sweet except it does have a bit more of a tarty flavor as a result of the inclusion of the honey balsamic. If you prefer ice cream to not be cloyingly sweet, I think you will enjoy this flavor. The waffle cone itself was quite delicious as well. Everything about the ice cream that I had here screamed quality and well made to me.\\n\\nI can see why Salt & Straw is so popular. The ice cream is made with care and the flavors standout from the ones you can find at your local grocery store. If you are looking for an ice cream experience that changes the way you think about this confection, Salt & Straw is the place you need to go."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Super tiny place with lots of charm.

Love the space, they really killed it on the design, seriously.  Very warm, reminds me of a place you'd go to after a day of skiing in Aspen or Vail.  I was just waiting for some Buckhead Betty to come strolling in wearing some bad ass white furry apre-ski boots that they had to kill like 20 goats for per foot.  All it is missing is a warm fireplace in the corner.  Small inviting bar as well.  Menu looked well thought out.\\n\\nAs of now I can only rate this 3 stars since I only tried a pizza and sammy.  Potential for more.  On to the food...\\n\\nThe  Margherita  pizza didn't leave me craving more.  It wasn't horrible, it just wasn't great.  The crust lacked some moisture but wasn't completely dried out like some places.  What it did have was some good char that you could taste.  Not enough sauce.  You know what happens when you don't have enough sauce?  The oven dries it out and you end up with a red barren landscape that looks painted on the za.  The mozz was o.k., but overall the pie was a bit bland.  This is not to be shared, most could chow this down on their own and still be hungry after.\\n\\nThe Sicilian sammy was better.  Although it was too small for the price.  The mozz was quality, the tomato was as ripe as can be, the  caponata was a nice touch and really made the sammy along with the saba.  The arugula or basil didn't come through at all.  Bread was o.k.  This should be $8 instead of $11. \\n\\nOverall, I rather come back here for dinner and try some meat and pasta dishes.  No, not the chicken, and no, not the Shrimp Scampi.  Shit, let's not forget that!  The damn Shrimp Scampi. What good is an eye-talian place without some of that Shrimp Scampi stuff.  \\n\\nFor lunch though, not a lot of food for the price.  Left me hungry and broke.

Seven of us Yelpers took advantage of their incredible \\"Kanpai\\" happy hour special: five small plates plus one drink off the happy hour menu for only $15.  Happy hour is from 5:30 to 6:30 PM, Monday through Friday.\\n\\nThe happy hour menu is more extensive than you'd think.  Here's a link to the full menu: http://www.thatsbiz.com/cu/nakato/HH1.1.pdf.  It includes everything including edamame (soy beans), yakitori (chicken skewers), sushi rolls, and even mochi ice cream.  Note that the menu when we went did not include the hijiki (black seaweed) nor lotus \\"kimpira.\\"  So the online menu is a little different than the actual menu now.\\n\\nItems I ordered:\\nSlow cooked pork - traditional Japanese style\\nSeared white tuna - served with ponzu vinaigrette and scallions\\nUme shiso roll - plum and shiso leaf roll\\nJapanese style pollock frites - lightly battered and fried pollock with housemade tartar sauce\\nMochi ice cream - green tea, mango, and vanilla\\n\\nThe slow cooked pork is marinated in a thin, special sauce so the meat is very savory and tender.  It's also served with some small vegetables and roots, including half a brussels sprout.  The seared albacore tuna is like eating two slices of sashimi.  Fresh.  I did not like their ume shiso roll.  I thought it would be interesting to try shiso leaf in a roll, but the shiso flavor was very strong and sour.  I've had fresh shiso (sour plum) at Sushi House Hayakawa and it was delicious.  Here, it was too strong.  The pollack frites was almost like eating fish from a fish and chips basket.  Same style.  The green tea mochi ice cream was delicious.  The outer mochi covering was nice and chewy.  The vanilla mochi was not good at all.  Very rubbery and not enjoyable.  I gave my mango mochi to Kristin B. for her to try her first mochi ice cream.\\n\\nKristina K. was nice enough to let me sample her salmon and yellowtail rolls without the spicy aioli sauce.  They had green onion on the inside with sesame seeds on the outside.  They were just okay to me, but the portion size is a great value as they give you eight pieces per roll.  You could theoretically order five rolls and get 40 pieces total for only $15 during happy hour.  Check out my Local Photos to see pics of all these dishes.\\n\\nNakato is one of the older Japanese restaurants in Atlanta.  I believe it's been around for 30 years or more.  It is authentic and the restaurant is modeled, both interior and exterior, after traditional Japanese architecture.  They also have a small Japanese garden you can walk around outside.  The sushi chefs wear old school sushi chef uniforms.  The entire staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Complimentary valet parking is available.

I just went for the OG chicken sandwich tonight and damn it was good. Piping hot, deliciously moist chicken, not too much breading, and a great sauce. It was bigger than I expected for the price and just great. I can't wait to go back and try the Thai Chicken Sandwich.\\n\\nThey also have a $5 mini burger which is great idea for a quick bar snack.

My husband called in and checked if this location was offering the Thanksgiving menu items before we made our reservation for a party of 4 at 6:00pm. We ordered our meals and 2-3 minutes later our waitress returned saying they were sold out of turkey dinners. This was around 6:10pm.... \\n\\nWe didn't have a big family gathering this year so we opted for Thanksgiving dinner at Earl's and to say the least we were pretty disappointed. We could have made a reservation at a different restaurant if we knew we couldn't have a turkey dinner at Earl's. I was also in disbelief because it was so early and they were sold out. I give 3 stars because the other dishes we ordered were pretty good except for one of the dishes- the bacon cheddar burger was very dry and there was a bit too much mustard on it :(\\n\\nThe waitress was nice and apologized for not being able to offer the advertised meals. We did manage to order the pumpkin pie (I asked the waitress to hold us one for after our meal in case they sell out of that too). I understand it's difficult for restaurants to please every customer, but I have to say if we ever need to dine out for Thanksgiving I would refrain from booking anything at Earl's again after this year. For any other night, I don't have many complaints about Earl's.

It was very slow for a Wednesday night and the place was only half full. Don't get me wrong though. The food came out at a decent time but it was just trying to wait for our server to come by to take our orders that took long. Service was not so attentive as other reviewers had mentioned. Water glasses were only filled once at the beginning of the meal. (Ordering cocktails does not mean our water glasses should not be refilled?) Our server did save the day by bringing out a birthday cake and was considerate enough to wait for the birthday girl to blow candles before cutting it. Thank you. \\n\\nLOCATION:\\n\\nSituated in a fancy building across from Macy's and above Downtown Crossing station. Very convenient. \\n\\nATMOSPHERE:\\n\\nLovely pillows on the windowsills. Romantic with real candles. Not too noisy. Great for a first date. Also great for some after work detox.\\n\\nDRINKS:\\n\\nRue Arch. Delicious and fruity. I'm not sure why I didn't order this one. The birthday girl loved it though. \\n\\nCentral Sidecar. Too strong for me. I couldn't finish it so my best friend ended up drinking the rest of it. Thank you, bestie! \\n\\nCentral Sangria. The favorite one. It is kind of hard to go wrong with a sangria, I suppose. \\n\\nFOOD:\\n\\nFood was GREAT. I say this as a person who had never tried French food so take this with a grain of salt if you've had it plenty of times and know your French food well. \\n\\nFor starters we ordered the escargots bourguignon and flat bread. Comfort food! We ended up dipping our warm and crispy bread into the garlic and parsley butter from the escargots. Heaven on earth, I tell you. SO GOOD. We were all so hungry (from waiting) that we actually felt full after finishing the appetizers. We had some time to kill in between waiting for our entrees which worked out fine for us. \\n\\nBirthday Girl ordered Coquelle St. Jacques. The scallops were almost as big as Snapple caps and smothered with creamy sauce. The only thing she did not like about it was the mushroom duxelle. There was nothing wrong with it, just personal preference. \\n\\nBestie had Lemon Sole. It was very soft and creamy and sitting in a pool of roasted shrimp tomato  broth. I would say this plate is suitable for someone with a smaller appetite. Bestie had been sick when she had this and yet she still managed to finish the whole thing. \\n\\nThe only gentleman in our party had the Pistachio Crusted Salmon. Not a big fan of pistachio but oh man, the salmon! Cooked medium. Melt in your mouth goodness. The gentleman is known for having a huge appetite but it filled him up completely, I guess. \\n\\nI had the Porc Paillard. Can't pronounce the name to save my life! But it was just so good and I got the \\"yours look so good\\" compliments from my dining companions. And it was GOOD. I'm usually not one to order pork chop because I'm not a big fan of pork and I don't like my entree to contain bones. Well now I guess if it's any meat made with a tarragon and parmesan crust then I'll take it. \\n\\nVERDICT:\\n\\nWill come again, maybe for lunch."},{"name":"The Cafe at Taj Boston","address":"15 Arlington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"This review is just for the afternoon tea service.\\n\\nA friend and I first arrived at the hotel via taxi.  No one opened the door to the taxi, or greeted us.  Not even a \\"Welcome to the Taj\\".  This wasn't a good sign.\\n\\nAfter entering the hotel, we were unsure of where afternoon tea was being held.  We walked into what looked like a dining room.  The maitre'd was on the phone but there were several servers walking around who did not greet us.  The maitre'd took one look in our direction and promptly looked away.  Finally he deigned to point at a server, who proceeded to show us where tea was being held-the second floor.\\n\\nOnce we got to the second floor, there was a sign stating that tea was being relocated to the 15th floor.  The view there was very beautiful and was overlooking the public gardens.\\n\\nOn the 15th floor we were greeted and seated right away by a very nice maitre'd.  We ordered the Taj Royal, which included a pot of tea and a selection of tea sandwiches and pastries.  They do have a large selection of teas and also some interesting looking cocktails.\\n\\nThe menu claimed that afternoon tea service was being served on fine china, but the tea pots definitely needed an upgrade as the paint was scraped off in many places.  It looked more tacky than classy.  \\n\\nThe server poured me a cup of tea and did a great job of it.  However, they did not bother to wait for the tea to steep and all I got was a cup of tasteless hot water.\\n\\nThe sandwiches were pre-made and I suspect sitting for awhile.  Before I go more in depth as to the specific sandwiches, I must point out that the bread was stale!  It was awful.  Even though some of the toppings on the sandwiches were tasty, the stale bread definitely ruined it.\\n\\nThe smoked salmon, cucumber and cream cheese and prosciutto and melon sandwich toppings were very tasty.  They were all served open faced.  The egg salad tasted like it was a day old.  The bread was stale and crumbly and just plain awful.\\n\\nThe pastries included:\\nlemon thyme and currant scones - good but the devonshire cream and lemon-blueberry curd were very boring.\\nOpera torte - quite possibly the best thing they had there.  It was amazing!  It was a medley of different textures and flavors that blended together perfectly.\\nPistachio rose sable cookie - not much to say, it was a tiny cookie.\\nChocolate madeleine - not that great and very very tiny.\\nOrange French macaroon - the macaroon was really good!  It had a crispy outside with a soft inside and a delicious chocolate cream center\\nChocolate covered strawberries - maybe they were sitting in the heat for too long but the chocolate on the outside was kind of soggy and melting.  The berry itself was fresh and sweet.\\nKey lime tartlet - I don't like key lime flavored things so I won't comment on it.  But the tart shell was tasty!\\nCoconut financier - I thought this one tasted bad but my friend liked it so I guess it is a tie.\\n\\nThroughout the time I was there, I did not know who my server was.  It was a mix between a woman I thought was my server and the maitre'd who seemed to double as a waiter.  No one explained to us what sandwiches we were eating but someone did come over and tell us all about our pastries, which was a bit strange.  At one point I heard 2 servers arguing about a cheese plate in the back room...\\n\\nThere was also a violinist playing, that was pretty nice.\\n\\nAll in all, I'd say the servers tried hard (and it was appreciated) but probably needed some more basic training.  The food was either a hit or a miss, as long as they get rid of their stale bread.\\n\\nWill I ever go back?

It'd been several years since my last visit.  This place hasn't changed.  The owners of Harry & Sons also own Surin of Thailand two storefronts down.  Both of these Virginia Highland restaurants serve Thai food.  Surin has the more extensive Thai menu and classier ambiance.  In addition to Thai food, Harry & Sons has a sushi bar and a more casual atmosphere.  If you don't care for sushi, I'd go to Surin.  I think it's better.\\n\\nHarry & Sons has both authentic Thai and Japanese dishes on its menu as well as Americanized dishes like sweet and sour chicken and sushi rolls with many different ingredients.  On the Thai side, they offer soups, salads, noodles, rice dishes, curries, and entrees featuring duck.  Most of the Thai entrees are $11-18 each.\\n\\nSushi mainly consists of various chef-concocted rolls, most around $12 per roll.  The nigiri selection is basic and pricey at a flat rate of $3.50 for two pieces.  Most sushi bars charge their nigiri by fish type, but not here.  There's a sushi roll special Monday through Thursday nights -- buy one sushi roll, get the second half off.  Select rolls only, though.\\n\\nI tried a sampling of both Thai and sushi on my last visit.  They included:\\n\\nThai dishes:\\nThai Noodle (pad Thai) - thin noodles with shrimp, scallions, egg, peanuts, bean sprouts\\nChicken Panang - red curry paste sauteed with coconut milk, bell peppers, chicken breast, and basil leaves\\nBoneless Basil Duck - marinated duck (half), deboned, fried, and served with Thai chili pepper basil sauce and soy molasses sauce\\n\\nSushi rolls:\\nVolcano Roll - spicy tuna, cucumber, fresh tuna, avocado, eel sauce with a spicy aioli dipping sauce\\nYummi Yummi Roll - fresh salmon, tuna, yellowtail, cream cheese, seaweed, flash-fried in a homemade sauce with seaweed salad\\nTekka Maki - tuna rolls\\n\\nMost of the dishes came with side garnishes of kale and shredded carrots.\\n\\nThe pad Thai was saucy and super sweet.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I'm not used to pad Thai being so sweet.  At least it wasn't overly sour.  The ingredients seemed fresh enough and the portion size was filling.  The only thing missing was lime.  We had to request lime separately and the lime wedges given to us barely had any juice in them.\\n\\nThe Chicken Panang was good and probably the best dish of the night.  The panang curry was smooth, rich, and flavorful.  I enjoyed eating it with the accompanying white rice.  The chicken breast was satisfactorily tender.\\n\\nThe Boneless Basil Duck was an interesting dish.  It didn't come exactly how we expected.  The duck was not deboned thoroughly, so that was a major annoyance.  We had to pick out several small bones.  I don't have an issue with bones unless they're included in a dish that's described as not having any.  The duck meat was dry so the two sauces were a must.  We couldn't taste any basil in this dish (I know it's supposed to be in one of the sauces), so that was disappointing.  This dish also took a long time to prepare.  You may want to stay away from this one.\\n\\nThe sushi rolls were good and the fish seemed adequately fresh.  I wasn't a huge fan of the Yummi Yummi Roll since it was served soaked, sitting in a plateful of sauce, though I admit I am a traditionalist when it comes to sushi.  I like plain and simple nigiri, so I've already got a mild bias against rolls.\\n\\nSimple rolls like Tekka Maki are great, though.  Unfortunately, the Tekka Maki here was prepared rather sloppily.  The pieces stuck together so when I used my chopsticks to pick up a piece, the seaweed and rice would come unraveling.  At an authentic sushi bar, no way would the Tekka Maki come out like this.  This was more Ru San's-like (not good).\\n\\nService was OK.  We had to get the attention of our server on more than one occasion because he was off to the side on his phone.  We ordered so much food and the plates were so big that all of it could not fit on our table at one time.\\n\\nThere's a small TV above the sushi bar playing sports (not HD).\\n\\nOverall, I give Harry & Sons 2.5 stars rounded up to 3, maintaining my original rating of this restaurant."},{"name":"Street","address":"3407 Greystone Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Sushi was good not great.

It's a very solid Italian restaurant.\\n\\nWe knew if we didn't get there early enough on Friday that we would be waiting for a long time. The plan was to get there right at opening so our wait would be minimal and hopefully non-existent. After strolling around the North End, being not from Boston, we decided to stroll by the restaurant about 20 minutes before they opened just to find out where it was. When we walked by, there was a group waiting outside, but we were also surprised to see people sitting inside ordering food. Apparently they will open up the place before their official opening time. Not knowing the deal, we took another walk around the block before we went back at 5. We still were able to get right in with no wait. But if you don't mind eating early, if you get there before they actually open, there is a chance you could get a table with no wait.\\n\\nThe food was outstanding. I had a fusilli seafood special. The homemade pasta is awesome. I tried the Giacomo's sauce which did not disappoint either. I inhaled all my food. The girlfriend tried the butternut squash ravioli, which she loved. I sampled a piece. Delicious. More butter than nut in those ravioli. Really, really good. Not to mention, the price can't be beat. We had a bottle of wine, an appetizer, and two delicious entrees for about $70.\\n\\nIt's very small inside. You'll most likely become very friendly with someone else since you'll be seated very close to them (at the same table in some cases). Doesn't bother me and it shouldn't bother you.

A very large, awesome, open space for a bar and it was crowded.  Some indoor seating (though there was room for a lot more) that was completely full.  A stairway up to the second floor (where we didn't go).  And finally, there was a bunch of outdoor seating that wasn't yet taken. Yoink!  That's where we went.\\n\\nAct 1: They were obviously busy.  It took a while to get some service but it wasn't annoyingly long - I was just hungry. :)  We put in our order for fried pickles to start, and some chicken sandwiches.  Again, it took a while to get our app, just to the point where we were asking ourselves if maybe they forgot it, and then voila, it was there.  They were worth the wait.  Thicker chips, good sauce, I was a happy camper.\\n\\nAct 2: The chicken sandwiches come out and... oops, mine's fried.  I looked at the menu and they offered grilled or fried, which is partly my fault for not specifying but they didn't ask.  It wasn't the crispiest fried chicken in the world but it tasted hand breaded, which was nice, and the bun is the stuff of dreams.  The greek salad side though... yum.

It was to die for, I wanted to lick my bowl clean.  It is just a bunch of perfectly ripe avocado pieces with bits of onion with a lime dressing that highlights the avocado and onion superbly.  It's definitely big enough for 2-3 people - especially if you all order a regular entree.  I personally wish I had the salad to myself and ordered an appetizer as my meal to save room for dessert.  The tres leches cake looked great but I had zero room.  I ordered the red snapper enchiladas (not at all similar to mexican enchiladas - no tortillas involved, fyi) and it was pretty good.  Not nearly as good as the avocado salad - that is a pretty tough act to follow.\\n\\nWe got here around 5:30 on a saturday and there was already a wait.

For starters, I need to clarify that this rating is based on two visits, it's really a 3.49 star rating, and the fact that I am a BBQ snob.  Which means that I am overly judgmental on these types of restaurants.\\n\\n My introduction to The Salt Lick a little over two years ago was underwhelming as far as the food was concerned, but the atmosphere was intriguing enough that, on a BBQ vision quest of Central Texas' legendary joints with my brother this spring, we stopped in so that he could experience it for himself. \\n\\nThe first visit involved a family-style eating experience, in which a single plate of sliced brisket, sausage, and spare ribs was promptly delivered for our party of four to devour.  We sat on picnic tables right next to the original pit and were crazy excited as plate after plate was delivered.  The speed of service was impressive, but the meat failed to live up to the hype.  Adding insult to injury is the fact that they cover the meat in copious amounts of the honey mustard-based, Hawaiian BBQ sauce.  Still, we felt compelled to get stupid full in order to get our money's worth, so I stuck with the sausage and their very decent bread because the only brisket that they were delivering was lean (dry).  Also, the sides suck.  Not a shocker.  We left a little disappointed, but not pissed because we figured that with a massive operation like that, \\"Eh...what can you expect?\\"\\n\\nFast forward to a couple of years later: two brothers on a BBQ pilgrimage, with the intention to hit up every legendary joint in order to gain knowledge that will, one day, allow them to open their own place.  The Salt Lick was on this journey purely for atmospheric research purposes.  After two days of hitting up the Texas Monthly list's regulars, we arrived Saturday night to find The Salt Lick almost unrecognizable from the previous visit. I have to say that I was a little sad, because the \\"atmosphere\\" definitely takes a hit when charter buses are involved.  There must have been a thousand-plus people on site, and we sat down under a shade tree to imbibe in our cooler beverages (BYOB), certain that we were settling down into a night-long venture.  After about twenty minutes we were taken to a table, introduced to our server (a pleasant young guy), and within five minutes had plates of meat in front of us.  We decided to order poundage of meat, because we figured that it would be cheaper than the family-style.  We were correct.  Also cool, the server asked if you wanted the meat lean or fatty.  We couldn't scream, \\"FATTY!!!\\" quick enough.  I might as well have been eating crow, seeing as how bad the Salt Lick made my previous assertion look to my brother, who couldn't believe that he was eating good BBQ after hitting up the legends, and hearing my opinion of the previous visit.\\n\\nLong story still long....we were in and out in a hour.  Pretty damn impressive, and they held their own with the purists, even considering the tourist-trap sellout.

The waitress was nice but couldn't really explain to us what she was serving. On that note, I would much prefer that they bring all of the courses at one time, versus plate by plate. The scones were bite sized and the cream was a mere \\"meh\\" in comparison to others I've had. The canap√©s were so-so and the pastries at the end left me in what seemed like a diabetic coma.

As more people came in to eat, the noise naturally grew;  but overall the setting was never too loud. \\nVisually,  the interior is very appealing, darker shades,  and somewhat fancy. \\nThe artistic wall divides, various adornments, and traditional circle-style seating (which was offered along with booths) all combined into one perfectly executed experience which made it believable that I had been transported to a nice establishment in Hong Kong.\\n\\nI will also note something which certain reviewers tend to ignore, which is the room temperature,  seeing as some restaurants/stores in general may or may not have a comfortable environment. Although the weather has been notedly hotter and humid in the time that we visited,  Hong Kong House was perfectly air conditioned without being too cold either. And privacy for those who desire it,  our seat happened to be one of the many enclosed tables. \\n\\nWe were seated as soon as we walked inside, and our drinks were ordered.  We had Jasmine and Oolong teas, which were both very good. \\nJust to talk about the tea itself: it was very fresh, served in teapots which were left at the table for us, the leaves could be seen in the bottom of one's cup after pouring, and it was not made so strong and concentrated as many other restaurants tend to ruin it. \\n\\nThere are two separate menus,  one for the more Americanized, the other for the more authentic pallet.\\nThe waitress was very helpful in answering any questions and explaining the sundry dishes that they offer.  And overall the waitress remained very helpful and diligent,  without being intrusive, unlike many American restaurants which encourage loud and hyper behavior in their staff.\\n\\nNote: This restaurant specializes mostly in southern and Sichuan cooking, so much of the variety of dishes can be somewhat spicy. I personally don't like spicy food as much,  but none of the dishes I ordered were a problem to my slight surprise. \\nWe ordered from both menus: crab cream cheese wontons, wontons with hot chilli sauce,  pork blood soybean sprout stew, chicken in garlic sauce,  and cumin fish fillet.\\n\\nOur two appetizers came out first,  and in reasonable time. The wontons were both very delicious,  and the sauces they came with likewise.\\n\\nAfter we ate our wonton appetizers, it took a while for the meals to arrive;  however we didn't complain because there was plenty of tea to converse over,  and we were glad the chefs were taking their time. \\nBoy were we glad they took their time, because 'delicious' is a term which hardly comes close to this particular culinary experience. \\nThe portions for all the dishes were more than enough.  (Complementing the more traditional style of dining in which large dishes are shared around the table. And we did share amongst ourselves.)\\nThe chicken dish,  which was the closest to Americanized that we ordered,  was quite tasty,  and blended in nicely with an assortment of sliced Chinese vegetables and spices.\\nThe fish was perfectly fried, delicately seasoned of cumin and little red peppers. It was cooked perfectly,  the outer crust with a slight crunch,  and the fish meat succulent and tender. Some reviewers have complained that their fish could have been frozen, but Columbus is land locked, so it would be unfair to expect the freshest seafood. Also,  there are many fresh fish kept live in tanks at the grocery; so I highly doubt they champion the use of frozen fish. \\nOf all the dishes,  the favorite was undoubtedly the pork blood soybean sprout stew, which was brought out in the pot and rested over a small burning coal to keep it simmering. \\nLet me tell you,  this Chinese cooking transcends the mere senses of taste and temperature. \\nWith not only pork and tofu,  but other diverse proteins,  this stew was expertly and intelligently crafted with exuberant spices and herbs,  along side the various hot and numbing peppers.\\nThe dish was spicy,  but the sensation of all the flavors and the numbing peppers made it simply delightful even for someone such as myself who has a preference for the cooking of Hu√°bƒõi.\\n\\nHad my friend not wanted moon cakes so badly,  we might have never discovered this undeniably wonderful restaurant.\\nThis was the easiest five-star review ever."},{"name":"Coco Cabana","address":"4073 Lavista Rd, Ste 323","city":"Tucker","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm so bummed I have to write a negative review for this restaurant! I work very close to Coco Cabana, and I'm a Brazilian who loves Cuban food. Today I was craving Ropa Vieja and a Chicken Empanada (being pregnant will do that to you! haha). The issue I had today was with service. My boyfriend went in to pick up my lunch since I was at work. He showed up with a bill for $18 which seemed bananas to me for one lunch portion Ropa Vieja and one empanada. I called the restaurant to find out what happened. The person who answered the phone explained to me that she gave my boyfriend a meal portion of the empanadas. I then asked how much one empanada was. She said $2, I then asked why she gave him 3 and not only 3 but chicken empanadas were ordered and ground beef were given. She told me they don't sell only one empanada. I then asked why she would tell me the price for one if they don't see one. She then told me that they will sell you one if you order it. I reiterated that he asked for one chicken empanada and was given 3 ground beef. She was clearly upset on the phone, said if I bring them back she'll refund them. I was bothered by her attitude but appreciated that she did the right thing.\\n\\nMy boyfriend brought back the empanadas. She was visibly upset and refunded the entire meal. Then charged him for the Ropa Vieja meal and one empanada. He asked why she's charging for one empanada. She explained because I had eaten out of one. He became irritated at this moment and told her that was how she found out they were beef and said he didn't find it just to charge for one empanada. She got even more upset and very loudly said \\"Fine! Then you don't pay for anything!\\" and walked away. He did see from her for the rest of the time.\\n\\nOn our bank statement is shows two charges at Coco Cabana, one for $18 and one for $13. I am hoping in the next two days at least one of those charges get taken off. \\n\\nSad to say I will not go back to this restaurant.

So of course we told our waiter, just so he knew. His response: rolling his eyes, and asking us, \\"Ok, what do you want me to do?\\" \\n...Uh, hello. WTF. He continued to be inconsiderate like this throughout the night, as did our other waiter, a young woman (there were 3 servers total, I think), who acted similarly impatient and busy when we asked for bread (after waiting ~10min). Bread was chewy and butter was cold, which I understand are not servers' fault, just pet peeves of mine. Why would you have a carefully-crafted menu and then dump hard,stale sourdough on people's plates? And butter can easily be served at room temperature. Do the bread right, or not at all. \\n\\nWe all did the prix fixe menu, but asked our waiter if it would be possible for my friends to have the normal menu and for myself to have a seafood version (I am a pescatarian). He said yes, assuring us the chef is open to these sort of changes, and we would be accommodated. Nonetheless the first 3 courses were all seafood, which seemed a little weird to us (the table next to us was also doing the set menu and had received several non-seafood items). We asked the server, just to be sure, that he had understood only one of us was pescatarian, and he clearly had, but instead of admitting, huffed a little and gave us some explanation that prix fixe menus are \\"classically\\" seafood leading up to meat dishes. Awesome, thanks dude. Again making us feel stupid and small (and I know he is incorrect). There are graceful ways to handle questions like this, server man. \\n\\nThe food itself was great, and I remember really enjoying the house-made tagliatelle with sea urchin until the server came to take our plates and scoffed a little at me - \\"Oh, someone not a fan of sea urchin?\\" \\nI had a couple pieces remaining on my plate - I apologize for not licking my plate clean, pops.

Let's face it, boneless fried chicken is pretty hard to completely destroy, so it's a good bet when you're out of your neighborhood and going after some strange. \\n\\nThey were a revelation! Hot, juicy, perfectly crisped and seasoned. The crust was light and crunchy, and the chicken itself dissolved into a delicious ethereal mouthful under the slightest pressure of teeth. This chicken was magic....and so were its partnering french fries. Perfectly cooked, served hot and dusted with fresh pepper and some kind of fine, flaky sea salt. I could have eaten another whole plate, but I thought I'd do a little better and got a side salad instead. Another winner, snappy green lettuce, fresh croutons that I am pretty sure must have been homemade, and just the perfect amount of a creamy, garlicky Caesar dressing that I would have been delighted to eat with a spoon all by itself. \\n\\nThe bar was a little noisy, but not too bad, and I was really enjoying the TV being tuned to the Science Channel.

Shortly after we had distributed the cake, the owner told us we had a limited 15 minutes left that we were allowed to remain in the restaurant, and dismissed us by grabbing the shoulders of one of the guests and gesturing for us to leave.

Having heard/read good things about it, it has been high on our list of places to try for quite a while. A platter of oysters was great, but some cherrystones we ordered were unmanageably large, almost the size of quahogs, and way bigger than any cherrystone I've ever been served. Literally, a mouthful; while tasty, they were really difficult to eat. Trying to cut a big raw clam with a dinner knife and a cocktail fork was a new experience for me, and one I shouldn't have had if anyone preparing the platter knew what they were doing. Our waitress had condescendingly questioned our ordering the cherrystones with, \\"Those aren't oysters, you know.\\" (She could have added, \\"You can bring the shells home and use them to keep spare change in.\\") They should have gone into the chowder, not been served from the raw bar. Speaking of chowder, Row 34's was terrible: watered-down flour paste flavored with salt pork, with a few scraps of clam, and incredibly salty. In a blind tasting I never would have taken it for clam chowder. This is Boston, folks, where people ought to know how to make good chowder and where lots of other places make great stuff; it doesn't have to be the traditional (and excellent) chowder they serve at Legal Seafoods but it shouldn't taste like ham. Row 34 should be embarrassed to serve it. A salmon collar with charred cabbage was OK but the tasty crisp skin had a fin that I didn't notice (lighting is stylishly dim) and wasn't much fun to chew on. The cabbage was good too, but would have been so much better hot, not cold; a potentially interesting dish that wasn't. Speaking of cold, they have pretty good bread and very good butter but the bread is served cold. Would be so much nicer warmed. Avocado salad was pleasant, a heaping plate of fresh watercress, good buttermilk dressing, crumbs of feta cheese, and some thin slices of avocado buried underneath. We looked at it blankly when it arrived but found the avocado with some excavating; presentation was really weak. Skate cheeks were good, fried perfectly, nice crisp crust. The sauce, allegedly a caper-lemon aioli, sounded like it might be nice but it wasn't -- more like a doctored up tartar sauce from a jar. Desserts were nothing special. Butterscotch pudding can be amazing. This wasn't. A chocolate tart was pretty pedestrian. Neither was bad, just not that good, and that sort of characterizes our experience there.\\n\\nService was fine, if a bit slow, except for the guy bussing our table who seemed overly eager to clear things out, even when we weren't finished. A mangled fork that should never have made it to the table was promptly replaced.\\n\\nDecor is very cool, and it's noisy but not uncomfortably so. They have an excellent selection of beers and wines, so this is probably a great place to go for drinks but I won't bother eating here again. Bottom line: we spent nearly $200, before tip, never had a \\"Wow!\\" moment of dining, felt like attention to detail isn't a priority, and went home talking about all the places we've had better meals for a lot less."},{"name":"Noodle Stix","address":"11 Belmont St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"One star is harsh, because I think this restaurant has potential. But egregious incompetence mandates star reductions.\\n\\nI ordered delivery off of Campusfood.com from Noodle Stix to Harvard Square at around 11:15 PM. Yes, that's a plus: It's open late! I was intrigued by their \\"Real Szechuan & Hunan\\" section of the menu, which contained items like ma la (hot and numbing) chicken. So I ordered two items off this menu: ma la chicken and kung pao shrimp. For the latter, I requested \\"VERY spicy.\\" I also ordered (and paid for) a bottled water, and asked for chopsticks.\\n\\nDelivery took 45 minutes, plus about ten minutes for the delivery guy to find me.

I even told him, \\"I am standing in the street,\\" and to my dismay he didn't even look in the street, he just started walking back to his car.\\n\\nThe bottled water never came. No chopsticks. The kung pao shrimp wasn't the least bit spicy, and was marginal quality overall. Bring me what I ask for: This is the sine qua non of successful food delivery. \\n \\nRice was low quality. Hello stupid Chinese restaurants, good rice is cheap, you don't have to save 10 cents on my order by using crappy rice. But the ma la chicken was good. 10 minutes later my mouth still has some of the hot and numbing feel. The dish wasn't authentically hot and numbing, and I wish it had more ma and more la, but it was still good, particularly for delivery Chinese. So the restaurant has potential. Prices are low, and I like the fact that they offer half-size portions.\\n\\nBut nobody is going to order delivery from a place that doesn't deliver what he orders.

I've heard everything from 'best of the chain steak houses' to 'it sucks'. While its not the greatest steak house, it definitely does not suck. I should have known, as the people hammering home the 'it sucks' viewpoint are people that have historically given me unreliable restaurant opinions; my parents. \\n\\nI wasn't a fan of the sourdough bread, as it was 90% tough crust and 10% bread. I wasn't a fan of my weak, small french onion soup. I wasn't a fan of the \\"tempura\\" (more like soggy pancake battered, far from tempura) onion rings with Thai chili sauce.  I was also disappointed that they had no draft beer.  Everything else was delicious. \\n\\nHaving never been to a Ruth's Chris before, I got some recommendations from my sister, who surprisingly has been here a few times. Surprisingly, because I didn't think she even ate steak. Well, her first recommendation was the stuffed chicken, and in the interest of eating light, my buddy ordered it and agreed with her, it was \\nthe best chicken he's ever had. I didn't try it, but I thought it was presented beautifully. Her second recommendation was the cowboy ribeye. I was glad to hear that, as it was the steak that I had picked out while viewing the menu online. I ordered it rare, with a blue cheese crust, and it was fantastic. I simply devoured it, taking very little time out to bother with sides. Now realize that the mains are served on 500 degree plates, allegedly. As a result, by the time I was finishing my steak, the bottom third of it had cooked from rare to medium. This was acceptable, as the hot plate also served to boil the butter that came on top of the steaks. Along with the weak \\"tempura\\" onion rings, we got au gratin potatoes which were very good. \\n\\nThe setup of the restaurant was unique. The restaurant occupies about half of Boston's old City Hall, but is broken up into multiple small dining rooms on two, possibly three floors. It created a nice ambiance. I dug the setup as opposed to one giant wide-open dining room. Also, our waiter Rob was very helpful and knowledgeable, and he and Jean made sure our waters were always topped off and our bread basket was always full. \\n\\nSince I was very happy with my cowboy ribeye, and my friend with his chicken, I texted my sister to thank her for the recommendations. Her response floored me, she was disgusted that I ordered mine rare and told me she always gets her steak well done. She instantly lost all credibility in my mind, it's just a good thing she didn't mention this before we had ordered!

There is a slight kick in terms of the spice to it.  There is a sesame dipping sauce that comes with it that almost tries to steal the show from the falafel.  Probably the best falafel balls we have had!  \\n\\nThe baba ghanouj is good...it is served with a folded piece of pita bread that is flaky and you can tell is homemade.  I should have asked for some of their hot sauce to add to it but the flavor and creaminess along with the chunks of eggplant were super good. \\n\\nThe gyros were really really good.  They were served on a nice bed of green leaf lettuce.  The tomatoes were cubes and the regular sized portion of meat was enough to satisfy midday hunger.

We were seated in a nice cozy corner which provided some shelter from all the noise but we didn't have a good vantage of the entertainment.\\n\\nFor our dinner, we started off with a delicious bread and a little too sweet Guinness reduction sauce. We followed that up with the Dalkey Duo which is a grown up pigs in a blanket (and I love me some PIAB). The sausage was lightly fried and came with mustard dipping sauce that complemented the sausage well.\\n\\nI of course had the Bangers and Booz for my entree, and I was not disappointed. What I liked the most was that instead of a typical gravy, you get this delicious beef stew to soak up the mash and Guinness sausages.

Friend said compared to the long wait at Franklin's vs. how swiftly we were seated at Salt Lick, that the brisket experience was equivalent. I disagree. Franklin's meat had identity, brightness of flavor -- you could taste MEAT and it was moist and flavorful even when eating the lean portions. At Salt Lick, the meat was wet on the outside but dry on the inside and chewy, and had far less flavor.\\n- Pork ribs were okay. A bit bland. \\n- Beef ribs were even more bland.\\n- Potato salad is interestingly spiced, served slightly warm, and not particularly mustardy. I liked its flavor, but not its consistency; it seemed that the potatoes were undercooked.\\n- Coleslaw: I liked, it did not have a mayo-based sauce.\\n- Bread: Fluffy and moist and wonderful. Rolls.\\n- Sauce: They had a \\"hot\\" and a \\"regular\\" and the \\"hot\\" wasn't really hot but more of a \\"kick.\\" The problem -- they cook the meat in this sauce or at least pour it on to serve it to you. Quality BBQ doesn't need sauce to this level. There was no smoky or molasses or caramely flavor to this sauce; it seemed more likey honey and mustard with spices thrown in. \\n- Cobbler: IS NOT TRUE COBBLER. DO NOT BOTHER.

There was a healthy line of about 14+, so we were all able to be get inside for the first seating. The place is sort of nondescript. There were clearly no native Japanese behind the counter or at the helm, which may not be a requirement for good food, but does take away some of the character and high spirits typical of authentic ramen establishments.\\n\\nNevertheless, we were greeted courteously,  seated promptly and our orders taken soon thereafter. We ordered the char siu bun and avo tuna. Both were so-so. The char siu was rather salty without being particularly tasty.\\n\\nThe ramen, though, was singular. I certainly see why this place is so popular in NYC. The chicken soup base that anchors all of their noodle bowls is unique, rich, and really delicious. Various accents that can be added to the ramen, including bamboo shoots, miso paste, and spicy sauce were also excellent. They did a really nice job with our soft boiled eggs.\\n\\nI saw buckets of a yellowish liquid stacked in the kitchen. I am not sure what these were but I suspect they hold the soup base--which leads me to question whether the soup is made on site (or even in Boston). \\n\\nI gather from prior reviews that both preparation of the food and service can be uneven. On this particular occasion, the spicy sauce was accidentally left off my spicy ramen, and it appeared to take some convincing on the part of our server to the food preparer that the order actually specified spicy sauce.

I usually get a few oysters on the half shell when ever I eat there and they are usually really good however this time around I don't know if it was because we went during lunch time but all of the oysters I got had chips of shell in them.

I decided to take my lunch break before I went over the edge. I hopped on the elevator to go to the lobby floor and stepped outside into the cold air with only about 35 minutes to spare. Romeo's was right next door, so I decided to try it out. When I asked the employee at the cash register how long the pizza would take, he said 7 minutes (and I'm pretty sure it came out faster than that). I ordered a slice of pizza with 3 toppings: eggplant, caramelized onions, and meatballs. It was very well priced for a large slice of pizza, base (mozzarella) is about $2.50 or so, and the toppings were 50 cents each. \\n\\nThis pizza was surprisingly good! Romeo's has NY style pizza. The crust was nice and crispy and thin, the pizza didn't taste oily (one of my pet peeves is having to hold pizza with oily crust), and the toppings all complemented each other well. It held up well in my hand even though it was pretty big. The eggplant was lightly breaded and fried. The meatballs were shaved and thus stayed on well (no meatballs rolling off onto the counter here!) The caramelized onions maybe deserved a little longer on the pan to be called caramelized but they were thoroughly cooked (and time was more of essence to me, anyway, than the browning of onions). \\n\\nThe inside of the restaurant is a decent size and looks like it can hold a good amount of people. It felt a little empty, I think just because their huge liquor shelves weren't stocked with any alcohol (not sure if they are waiting for a liquor license or what the plan is for that?)

Our meal could bring a grown man to tears (or 3 small Asian girls)..seriously, it was that good. Service was great as well. Like the reviews say, arrive early or you'll wait outside. The restaurant is small and they only take cash. The pasta was diviiiiiiine; if it's not homemade then it's magic. We got 2 of the dinner specials-the 1/2 lobster, clams and mussels over linguine in the spicy and creamy red sauce ($22) and the fusilli with lobster in shrimp in a spicy tomato sauce ($26). Seafood was fresh and cooked perfectly, the tomato sauces were flavorful, yet had the perfect touch of creaminess you want when going for red sauce. Fusilli pasta soaked up the sauces without fail. We also got the butternut squash ravioli-perfect amount of sweetness and very well balanced. ($16). Everything was fresh and so well done. One of the most memorable meals I've had. Prices are excellent for what you're getting. Do not hesitate, go!

He flipped on the GPS and looked up restaurants, Burger Tex was the closest and that's where we went.\\n\\nI'm not gonna lie, Even though I know the best places are always the dingy hole in the wall establishments, I was a little leery upon pulling into the lot. The parking lot was a little beat up, as was the building. The sign looked like something reminiscent of an early 70's independent film, retro to the max. The inside reminded me of a casino that could be on the outskirts of Reno. Country, retro, dimly lit, these are all words that describe the inside well. \\n\\nThey have a few different sides of burgers, I chose the largest of the single patties (8oz) with fries and a drink. They make their own rolls on premises and it is a big plus. Definitely the best part of the entire burger. Fluffy, warm but solid all around, the grease of the burger did not soil the bun one bit. Butter toasted, you'd be hard pressed to find a better bun around. \\n\\nThey offer a topping bar that included shredded lettuce, sliced tomato, sliced and diced onion (which I was a HUGE fan of) pickles, jalapenos, and all of the major condiments (ketchup, mayo, mustard, BBQ.) \\n\\nWhen the food came out I lined up my burger in my usual fashion (ketchup and mayo.....raw onion (diced preferably.) When I sat down, I immediately hit my fries with some salt and pepper and dropped into some french fries, I believe the true measure of a restaurant can be gauged with their fries. Are you lazy and go with generic bag fries or do you take time and prepare your own? Burger Tex offers a seasoned fry that may come from a box but you would not be able to tell. They were excellent, which made me excited to rip right into my burger.\\n\\nI hit the burger with a huge bite to its mid-section. Not too greasy, I got the full flavor from the butter-grilled bun to the ketchup/mayo/onion combo, to the meat and cheddar. It was all good. I didn't fell that the burger patty itself was overly full of flavor but it was far from bland. \\n\\nOverall, I liked Burger Tex and I may go back. I doubt I would ever make a special trip just go to there (as I've done with other fine burger establishments) but I would go back if I were in the area and wanted a solid dining experience. Nothing over the top. This is just a good old fashioned burger joint. Not overly packed, you can eat in semi privacy.

I like tacos, and simply walking up to Elizabeth and Highland, finding Pure Taqueria was kind of a layup.\\n\\nI hit the place at just the right time, since I guess it was still a little too early for a dinner rush, but the place wasn't crowded, and I was seated immediately.  The chips and salsa arrived just as quick, and I was pleased that they weren't the same burnt cardboard that so many places serve.  And the salsa was just the perfect consistency, and had a good chipotle flavor to it, instead of the bland watery slop that the aforementioned so many places serve.\\n\\nThe decor is really relaxed, chill, and really comfortable inside.  The outdoor patio looked nice too, but maybe another time.  It's bright and airy, and reminds me a lot of Taqueria del Sol's Howell Mill location, but smaller and not nearly as humid inside.  Though, the chairs remind me a little too much of contemporary public elementary school, and are about as comfortable.\\n\\nIn spite of the slow customer time, the service was a little on the slow side.  A trip to the restrooms (which are clean and spacious) walks past the entry way where a lot of the staff kind of hangs out and socializes while my friend and I were ready to order for a little too long ago.  But that's really my only critical critique on the place, and if that's the case, Pure Taqueria is in good shape.\\n\\nThe food was excellent, and I was pleased.  I ordered the grilled fish tacos on corn tortillas, with refried beans and rice on the side.  I feel that not enough places serve corn tortillas, and I'd honestly go back to Pure by virtue that they do, and I was satisfied once before.  The fish portions were generous, and excellently flavored and seasoned, and the grilled pico it came in was juicy, and just spicy enough to get my attention; I have a high-threshold for spicy, and was very pleased with Pure's idea of spice.\\n\\nPrice was just good; at first, I'm thinking \\"10 bucks for two tacos?  These tacos better come with the Russian hook-oh, rice and beans too, cool.\\"  But after the plates were cleared, I realized that I was full, and there's really not much more to ask from there.\\n\\nI hear a lot of good things about the drinks at Pure Taqueria, but I was still in a state of post-Dragon-Con-bender detoxing, so unfortunately, I didn't get to see for myself.  But rest assured, there will be a next time, because overall, I was happy with Pure Taqueria, and would come back for more."},{"name":"Don Pedro's Tacos","address":"6134 Busch Blvd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm gonna be quick, but whatever you order, don't forget for the green sauce.

Tables were of sturdy wood material.  The table that I sat at felt a little sticky on the surface (?most likely because they only used water to wipe it down or perhaps just wiped it down with a dry rag - that is only my assumption though).  There is a bar area in the restaurant where you sit right in front of the kitchen staff making the food.\\n\\nThe following comments are based on the mega ramen with a side order of an egg.\\n\\nBroth: I believe that sodium was used in excess to the point where it was mildy umcortable consuming.  The broth tasted like a chicken based broth with pork fat to fortify the taste.  While consuming I did feel a slight tinge in my palate which is extremely evident of the addition of monosodium glutamate (which is a sodium salt of glutamic Acid - and the tinge comes from the lowering of the pH from that ingredient).  \\n\\nPork: the cooked pork (japanese style \\"char sui\\") was obviously torched before serving.  I believe the goal of that is to enhance the taste of it.  Although I would award it 10/10 in effort, it's taste truely deserves a 1/10.  First off, not only is this a very unorthodox way to serve japanese style \\"char sui\\"; charing both sides of the pork adds a slight bitterness that does not harmonize, to any degree, with the saltiness of the broth.  Furthermore, the burnt bits of the pork, if left long enough in the broth, will shed off causing a pool of charred bits swirling around the broth.  The cuts of the pork was borderlining in-edible because the fat to protein ratio is greater than that of normal bacon.  \\n\\nSprouts: One word: undedicated.  Sprouts naturally have no taste, and their ability to absorb and maintain taste is pretty hard because of the cuticle that surrounds the epithelium of the white stalk.  Nevertheless, the sprouts should always be parboiled with the same stock that is used with the noodles before serving immediately; this is a traditional technique that allows the sprouts to retain some taste that is in harmonious with its surrounding.  The key is parboiling and serving immediately.  That technique was obviously unsued in my particular bowl of noodles, and I am quite dissapointed at such a rudimetary miss.\\n\\nEgg: the egg I ordered was hard boiled.  I believe a 2 year old could do the same.\\n\\nNoodle: the noodles were the only highlight of the meal; but this to credit only the kitchen staff that did not under or over cooked the noodles.  The noodles in my particular meal was that of a wavy noodle (similiar to the same kind of noodle you see in modern tokyo-style ramen).  Although, they do serve the non-wavy thinner noodles as well.  Noodles were not handmade.  They were obviously machine made (chewier consistency; diameter per each noodle is the same).  I personally prefer handmade noodle as the inconsistency in diameter (thiness and thickness) enhances the texture.\\n\\nLocation: Brighton Avenue in Allston is a very busy street with limited parking spaces on the street.  Not convienent at all."},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Absolute great place to catch a pint and some authentic Irish food.

And I have to say that everything was excellent - the food, the atmosphere and the service.  So, why I don't give it five stars?  Honestly, if I could give it four and a half, I would but I couldn't bring myself to give it five for a couple of reasons.\\n\\nFirst, you really have to know what you are getting into.  The food, although excellent, is overly stuffy. The ethos of the restaurant really is that the chef knows best. Obviously, the chefs are very good but it was tough for my husband and I to find something that we could eat with enthusiasm.  Be prepared to be adventurous and to not be overly controlling of your meal. (Think half of a hog head landing on a table next to you - in full form. That actually made me give up me (excellent) tea and leave. It might make me a wimp but I just really couldn't stare at it.)  My husband's meal was cooked to perfection. Mine (the sirloin) had some really tough parts to it.  I do have to say that I normally don't like clams but their clam appetizer was really good.\\n\\nSecond, the service is really attentive.  However, it is not exceptional.  To me, exceptional service is when you don't even feel the waiter's presence. Things happen and are moved along precisely when they need to.  My husband and I felt that we were being asked how things were every 5 minutes. Attentive - but intrusive as well. I often felt interrupted, rather than helped.  However, the waiters communicate all your needs with each other.  When a new waiter came with our dessert menus, they already knew what we could and couldn't eat due to religious restrictions. It was a nice touch.\\n\\nOverall, it's definitely worth a try. But, will I being going back whenever I can? I don't know - I think I prefer a homier, simpler aesthetic to my food.  But, if you want good food creatively prepared and are ready to be adventurous, this is a really good option for you."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Reserve Ringside Brunch. \\nWitness the artistry and meticulousness.  \\n\\nEverything was soooo good.

To be honest, my expectations were very high. As a Yelp enthusiast, I read the raving reviews; but what set this sushi eatery apart was the family recommendation. In town for a wedding, you would expect to get a few directions on what is good. Sometimes they are good and sometimes, well, you know. This was one of the good ones.\\n\\nFirst, we walked in an hour early to our reservation (a miracle because our flight arrived early.) Harrison, our twentysomething host, didn't even blink. We got a table immediately. Don't get the wrong idea. There was a very robust crowd of locals already there. I immediately felt confident because if the locals are eating there you can expect good food. \\n\\nHarrison got us a table in a prime spot that looked out onto 23rd Avenue. It was a superb vantage point for people watching. As we sat down, we were introduced to Dani (our server). She started off by asking us one of two questions. The first being if this was our first visit to Bamboo (yes.) The second was what brought us here. I liked how Dani asked such things in order to get to know us better. By figuring out our preferences, Dani was able to suggest things we might never have chosen.\\n\\nWe ordered 3 signature rolls. Those rolls were the Local, Showdown, and the Green Machine with Albacore tuna. All three rolls were Instagram worthy good however The Green Machine was a recommendation by my cousin and it was by far the best! Our server suggested we upgrade to the Green Machine with Albacore tuna. The Albacore tuna was caught fresh from the ocean earlier that afternoon. The roll is delicious and complex with an abundance of flavors and crunchy textures. The sweet chili aioli sauce united all these aspects making this roll incomparable.\\n\\nThe bartender also made a drink for my husband which was out of this world. I couldn't remember the exact content but it had a citrus taste to it with bitters and whipped egg white garnished with an amaretto soaked cherry. I had one sip. It was light and delicately refreshing! They have yet to name the drink and they've been asking customers for suggestions. I'm hoping they come up with something very soon as I can see that drink being a very popular item on the menu.\\n\\nDani then returned after our meal to ask if we would like dessert. Having ordered 3 sushi rolls we were satisfied and stuffed! We wanted very much to have dessert however we had plans to eat ice cream next door. The location was convenient for us as it segues into our next visit/review at Salt and Straw.\\n\\nCheck out Bamboo if you're in the area.

The pizza WAS fantastic.  But I recently ordered a San Gennaro for take out, and when I got home, the whole pizza tasted burnt.  I flipped the pizza over, and the bottom was about 50 percent burnt.  Just like a little bit of burnt popcorn affects the whole bag, even the unburnt parts of the pizza tasted bad.  I immediately called, and they just told me to take some pictures and they would give me a new pizza when I came back in.  Well, I went back in, and they graciously offered me a new pie for free.  But when I got it, the crust on this pizza was burnt, too.  I brought it to the manager's attention, and they graciously offered me a different pie.  This too was burnt!!!!  The manager showed me another pizza to compare, and one wasn't even burnt at all.  But the manager ultimately explained that this is how their pizza's are made.  I have been to Antico countless times since they first opened, and I never recall eating burnt tasting pizza--until now.  This wonderful restaurant has changed, and I unfortunately do NOT like it at all.  I appreciate their efforts to try to accommodate me, but I have to say I won't be back.

I knew that much from looking at the website.  I learned from one of the servers that it is in far north Thailand, close to Viet Nam and Cambodia.  It's not a region where coconuts thrive and so the food from that area reflects that.\\n\\nEach dish started with an introduction, what to look forward to, how to eat it and then we are left to enjoy.  Each of the dishes I experienced were complex, multi-ingredient dishes that I do not remember having had either in US Thai establishments or when I was in Thailand and had my first encounter and fell in love with the cuisine.  Having only visited Bangkok could be one explanation as I was no where near the Issan region.\\n\\nThese dishes are unique, incredibly flavorful, not overly spicy and the dishes lived up to the hype I've been reading for some time.\\n\\nA few of the dishes I would put in the \\"once in a lifetime\\" category.  While I didn't regret eating any of them, my culturally limited experience growing up on the Gulf Coast of Texas didn't quite prepare me for.\\n\\nThe first \\"snack\\" - Grapefruit, shrimp, herbs, peanut, coconut and betel leaf was wonderful.  The combination of flavors and textures was inspired.  The presentation as spot on and the service was truly attentive, inviting questions and always available.\\n\\nThe procession of the remaining 11 dishes were similarly impressive, unique, creative.  I didn't find any of the dishes particularly hot although my dining companion who doesn't like any heat found one of them a bit hotter than he was comfortable with.\\n\\nWhile I regret not taking more pictures of the food so you can get a better idea of what the presentation is like, I'm glad to have caught the \\"second dessert\\".  Yup, you heard it, the second one.\\n\\nBlack  sticky rice pudding was the base.  There was some coconut (white) with blackberry ice (purple) across that.  There was a swath of black sesame across the top side of half the bowl to represent the night and elderberry flowers carefully arranged across  the night sky to represent the stars.  The flavors were as incredible as the creativity and presentation.\\n\\nI could describe the other dishes - I remember something about each of them, several hours after leaving.  I won't go any further with this because whatever you have will likely be different.\\n\\nIt's not cheap.  I felt like I received a great value for the money I paid.\\n\\nThe one tip I will leave you with - for the ultimate foodie experience, get there early and ask to be seated at the counter just across from the cooking area.  Then you will see the magic unfold in front of you.\\n\\nDon't go looking to enjoy some of your old favorites or for \\"safe\\" choices.  They don't serve those.

We started off with the beats (Betterave & fenouil) and scallops (Les coquilles st. jacques) as an app.  Scallops were not seasoned well and the beats (i didn't order it) was just OK.  I'll add that I don't normally enjoy beats because I feel they taste like dirt or very earthy, but when I paired it with fennel, pomegranate, whipped sheeps feta the earthy flavor was muted.\\n\\nFor our main we tried two different types of muscles, Coquotte and Congolaise.  The Coquotte sounded great on paper, but their execution of it was so far off.  First, the white wine didn't reduce nearly enough, I think I got a slight buzz from this dish... and to top it off the muscles were seasoned with fresh cilantro which over powered the entire dish.  I should add, cilantro is not suppose to be in the Coquotte.  The Congolaise muscles were much better; however, when I think back anything would have been better then the failed Coquotte, so I don't really know how to judge the plate.  I like tomatoes, lime and cilantro together so how can you go wrong.  The best part of the meal for me was the Yam fries that came with the muscles... I could've eaten another basket they were that good!\\n\\nOur server apologized for the mistake with the Coquotte.  He even made grossed out face  when we told him the problem with the dish. When he returned with our check he also gave us some complimentary truffles, one white and and the other chocolate.   All in all I think if the meal was perfect they would've only gotten 3.5 stars. \\n\\nOn a side note, service was awesome and decor reminded me of my friends restaurant in Pasadena, CA.

As per usual, I hit up Yelp and Little Bangkok was the top Thai place, and just five minutes from my house. Checked out the menu and it seemed like a great choice - lots of real Thai dishes and good prices. \\n\\nCalled in our order - Chicken Satay, Massaman Chicken and the Red Curry Chicken - and headed over to pick it up. It was ready when we got there! Headed home, trying not to die from the wonderful smells filling up the car.\\n\\nI can eat Chicken Satay, specifically the peanut sauce, until the cows come home, so I was a little disappointed that there was only one small container of sauce. Defintely will order some extra next time. None the less, it was delicious and I killed my half of the 4 skewers in record time.\\n\\nI got the Massaman, and it was DIVINE. I actually just finished scarfing down the leftovers. The veggies are chunky and well cooked - carrot, potato, onion and avocado. The sauce is a coconut milk based curry, so it's sweet with the tiniest kick of spice, perfect for a wimpy, non-spice-eating person like me. Pour it over rice and you'll be in heaven in about 10 seconds.\\n\\nThe boyfriend ordered Red Curry Chicken, which is a lot like the Massaman, but a little bit spicier and with different veggies. I had a bite and it was quite yummy.\\n\\nOverall, I'm a big fan of Little Bangkok for great Thai take-out.

We ventured out here during a short, romantic getaway in Austin. Just my honey and I. He had seen this place on Man Vs. Food and, being the ultimate BBQ lover, he just HAD to go. So, ok. I enjoy barbecue, it's good. I am a Texas girl, so I can't deny that it's not in my blood. But I just don't LOOOOOVE BBQ the way most of my fellow Texans do. So last Sunday morning I gave in to the begging and let myself be dragged on over to The Salt Lick. And Holy Cow....was I ever wrong to have thought this place would just be a \\"meh\\" blip on the food radar. At first glance this place looks sort of like a dude ranch. You can smell the meat cooking from down the road. And boy, does it smell good. I bought a cup of lemonade from the girls selling it at a little lemonade stand outside of the restaurant. It was honestly a really, really tasty cup of lemonade. And it was a hot day, so the lemonade tasted even better. We must have been lucky enough to come just before the lunch rush. It was about 12:30 PM and there were people waiting to be seated, but our wait was less than 10 minutes. Our little buzzer went off so we handed it to the waitress and we were led into the main room. We passed the pit on the way in and wow did it look neat. There were huge slabs of brisket and ribs being smoked right on the pit, and thick ropes of sausage hung from the top of the pit. It was pretty neat. Our waiter was a young guy who I didn't expect to know much about meat, but he proved me wrong again. I wasn't hungry enough for standard size of plates they sell, so I explained to him exactly what I wanted and asked him to help me figure out a way to order it so it was just the right amount of food without being too pricey. The only items I really wanted were the green bean casserole and pork ribs. He ordered me half a pound of ribs and a side of the casserole. It was perfect. My husband went for the 3 meat plate and we were served in no time. That was the quietest meal I think we've ever had together. I'm a chatterbox and I am known to talk even throughout a meal, much to my husband's annoyance. But this time.....even I was silent. It was those ribs. Holy Guacamole, those ribs were AMAZING. So juicy, so tender and SO flavorful. They were meaty without being TOO meaty, with just the right amount of fat to make them juicy and tender. I couldn't stop eating them. Half a pound equaled two big ribs, which was the perfect size for me. The serving of green bean casserole was huge and it was amazingly delicious. The green beans were cooked, yet still had a nice firmness to them (I can't stand soggy green beans) and the crispy onions in the casserole were super delicious. It was one of the best meals I've ever had in my life, totally honest. I was shocked and of course, my husband was grinning from ear to ear. We will most definitely be back here again. We've already been telling everyone we know about it.

My parents and I ordered a hot pot of Tom Yum soup (the one with the shrimp and chicken, no coconut milk).  It was a huge serving that could probably feed 4 or 5 easily (and I think it was only $7 but don't quote me).  For appetizers, we ordered the basil rolls and the soft shell crab special.  I already love the basil rolls and the soft shell crab was perfect.  I'm not always a fan but this was perfectly fried (crispy and not too greasy).  Then we ordered the green mango flounder and a spicy noodle dish with beef.  I forgot what it is called but I will never forget that it is really tasty.  The green mango flounder is incredible, by the way.

There were so many children running around and screaming that you could barely move, let alone place your order and find a seat.\\n\\nWe persevered though, and ordered a ton of stuff, as you must always do when at a Flour: a Sticky Bun (obviously), Hazelnut Chocolate Chip Cookie, Banana Bread Bite and Chocolate Chip Macaroon.\\n\\nThe Sticky Bun is easily the best one I've ever had, so you must get it any time you go, no matter what. The cookies are also incredible, and this one was no exception. The Banana Bread Bite was pretty good too, not as good as most of the other stuff. Lastly, never really a fan of macaroons, the Chocolate Chip one here was really excellent.

It was good picking - by me. Lol. Thanks to Yelp and all the lovely reviews of course. We spent about 2 hours laughing and sharing great stores - some about marriage where two of us were cluelessly unconcerned about. Lol. Just saying. \\n\\nI started the meal with the Sunday in the park (beer). The description intrigued me as it stated it was fruity because of the various tropical fruits. Um. My friend and I would agree it wasn't so. I do agree that it was def a high gravity beer, about 8% for a 12 ounce drink (?). Unsure how this was one of the more popular ones though. Was it good, yes. Awesome or make it a hype, no.\\n\\nInstead of an entree, which I was eyeing a few on both the regular and special menus, I decided to order two appetizers. I first ordered the lemon herb braised organic lamb tacos, which comes with two. For a person with a super small appetite, this should do it. There was def a lot of lamb - always a good thing. The lamb meat was tender and good among the cheese, arugula, and other goodies.\\n\\nThe alcohol fooled me, and made it seem like I was hungry so I ordered the cornmeal crusted Louisiana alligator as well. My two friends ordered this prior to me, and so my sample of it proved to be a safe 2nd choice. The smell wasn't of anything swampy because alligator should taste like chicken according to one friend. The alligator was chewy and hot; I loved the spicy kick as well. Another friend tried this as well, and she loved that spicy kick to it. There was a good portion with it atop a bed of cabbage, which was pretty good. \\n\\nHey, I do like to pick the more unique choices on the menu. Two appetizers are equivalent to one entree. :) The grilled ravioli with crawfish, organic brisket reuben, and an item on the special menu with pork were worthy items that sounded delish. Everything actually sounded good, but these mentioned items popped out at me. \\n\\nService was pretty on point. Our waiter provided some good recommendations and stopped by throughout the meal to ensure we were good. He even obliged with our alcohol request to ask the bartender to make an Irish breakfast shot for the birthday boy. \\n\\nParking was pretty plentiful near the front.

Once we were seated and they realized what had happened, the bar tender personally came over to apologize, and brought us a complimentary cocktail that he had just prepared with fresh peach puree. \\n\\nThe rest of the evening went smoothly the wait staff was wonderful, they all seemed to work together. One waiter, who wasn't ours, over heard my friend say that she needed a new napkin and came right over with a replacement without us even asking. \\n\\nWe both ordered the 6 course tasting menu. I can't remember everything I ate because it was a little while ago, but it was amazing! The Amuse Bouche was so tasty and probably not something I would have ordered myself. The softshell crab tempura was perfect. The balance of flavor and texture were right on. I have never had tempura so perfectly crispy like that before, not even in good Japanese restaurants! \\n\\nIt's quite pricy, however, reviewing the ingredients in each of the dishes I had no issues with the prices. The food was exceptional and I left feeling overly stuffed! because we were seated to late we ended up missing the last T and had to take a cab home, so I would recommend trying to get earlier reservations if you are going to have the 6 or more course tasting menus, because it's an experience that can take time.

But I suppose that's why you bring your own cold beer or San Pellegrino (yup, this place is BYOB or they sell some in front if you forget). \\n\\nFor around $22 dollars you get a ginormous Neapolitan style pizza that can easily feed a hungry two or three with smaller appetites. We had a hungry three so we force fed ourselves to demolish two huge ones (got only the meaty ones \\n'cause that's how we roll: Diavola and a San Gennaro)... haha. Make sure you go up to where they're making the pizza and grab extra parmesan cheese, olives, garlic, and other toppings for your pizza. The crust is excellent, the bread is not too wet, but soft and chewey. The cheese, meat, and toppings were amazing.

The butternut squash ravioli were by far the best I've ever had, and the sauce managed to be creamy and flavorful without being heavy.

The manager was pretty much the same but appeared to want nothing to do with a customer who has a criticism (even with some positive observations). \\n\\ni think they should get some of the managers, cooks and staff from the pint house to come over amd do some training.

My favorite things about this place are not the BBQ.  I know it's strange, but I really love the sides here.  The coleslaw, potatoes and the pickle and onions are amazing.  The bread is right on (and makes one hell of a French toast if you have leftovers).  The BBQ?  My favorite is the Beef Rib.  All of the others are tasty, but the beef ribs are fantastic.  You can't really go wrong with the other meat selections, especially if you use the spicy BBQ sauce.  You can also order burnt ends which are a delicious way to get your daily dose of carcinogens.\\n\\nThe ambiance is really what makes this place.  It is such a good place to hang out with friends and family.  Kind of like Luckenbach, with BBQ. Come out and bring a cooler, or walk a short way over to the Salt Lick Cellar and buy some wine or beer.  Make sure you have plenty of time to enjoy.  This place is no fun if you are on a schedule.  \\n\\nSo what do you do if you are on a schedule?  Get it to go.  I usually do, unless I have friends or family in town.

I would say Bibibob is the healthy version of Chipotle, and I for one was very impressed.  I had a steak burrito with yum-yum sauce and my daughter had a bowl with spicy steak.  I was honestly shocked that she would be eating something spicy.  She said it's so good you can't help yourself but it was also burning her mouth off!!  I know where she is coming from, because I love Carribean Jerk wings from B-dubs but I need to keep the cold drink close by.  Downsides, my burrito was so large it feel apart while I was eating it.  Also, I wish the ingrediants in the burrito were better mixed instead of being basically stacked in layers.  They also had a large vat of unsweeten tea, (trying to be healthy) but honestly how many people can drink tea without a sweetner in it?  Yuck, gross... I had to add the sugar myself.  Spoke in length to one of the manager's Greg whose staff was very polite and helpful.  Overall a great experience, and I definetly recommend you try them out, especially if you're a Chipotle fan.

And to make it worse the hair was cooked in it, because when my girlfriend went to pull the hair out, a piece of chicken was dangling at the end. The image of chicken hanging by human hair ruined the meal for the rest of us.

The Italian soccer team was playing an important game so all the bars were packed with enthusiastic fans.  There were about ten people in line when we arrived at Giacomo's creating a wait of less than a half hour.  The people in line behind us smartly drank wine out of brown paper bags while they waited.  \\n\\nThe inside was tinier than I could have ever imagined with less than 15 tables nearly on top of one another.  The handsy server was attentive but obviously rushed as fast table turnover must be their main goal.  Giacomo's is known for its inexpensive yet huge servings of high quality Italian food.  We were immediately brought water, bread and olive oil.  The menu is posted on a large board rather than distributed to each table but the waiter took the time to explain everything to us.  \\n\\nWe started with the fried mozzarella and then ordered the lobster ravioli and linguini with Giacomo sauce (their house specialty) with the intention of sharing both equally.  The lobster ravioli was incredible especially because of the cream sauce.  We finished the lobster ravioli which alone was plenty for two people and ended up bringing most the linguini home which heated up even better the next day.     \\n\\nThe small size of the restaurant contributed greatly to the experience.  Everything that happened at the restaurant was on display from the kitchen, to the servers, to all of the to other diners.  You really got to see the inner workings of a successful restaurant.

The noodles weren't as crispy as I expected and it was pretty sweet. If they toned own the sweetness a couple notches I'm sure it would have definitely won me over. Then finally our Thai curry came out. The least of my favorite. Again just too sweet for my liking.

Honestly,  I would have liked a little more flavor associated with the salad, but I wasn't thoroughly unimpressed either. My sandwich was pretty mediocre, though. It was very pretty to look at, but the flavors just weren't there. It had a very bland taste that followed up with a soapy aftertaste. Not sure if it was  me, an ingredient I'm unfamiliar with, or a mistake, but I was not digging it at all. The consensus regarding the BLT was that \\"it had elements of things that were good\\", which isn't exactly a glowing review either. The entire lunch came to 29 dollars, pretty spendy for a meal that we were all kinda lackluster about.\\n\\nMy advice to Scratch would be to retool the lunch menu in favor of more simplicity. Yes, I know, it's Lake O and everyone walks around with cardigans and tennis racquets, but maybe a little bit more of a blue collar menu would work better?

Not all that professional in my mind. Anyway, we got seated, or rather crammed, into a table whose chairs literally butted up against the chairs at the neighboring table. It was definitely much more bar friendly, tables were a tight fit.  Drink list was impressive, many little-known beers that made my husband and brother happy. \\n\\nOnto the food... We ordered the fried pickles and mozzarella sticks for apps. Pickles weren't anything special and a little on the spicy side. Mozzarella sticks were pretty good and I did like the marinara sauce. Had a nice zing. for dinner I had the chicken salsa wrap, which was described as chicken, cheddar cheese, and spicy mayo. I figured that was in addition to the salsa. Nope. No salsa. Nor was there any lettuce or tomato which I thought might be present. Literally just chicken, cheddar and mayo. Husband had the buffalo chicken sandwich. Said there was too much bread, but it wasn't bad. The fries were a hit, though. Well seasoned and crispy on the outside. My sister-in-law got a Greek salad with steak tips, looked a little light on the feta... Come on guys, it's a Greek salad!

My brother actually asked the waitress, \\"is that really it?\\" For $14, they would do well to reduce the amount of fries on the plate by at least half and throw a few more tips on there. \\n\\nOverall I would say this place would be better for a few drinks but skip the food.

We should've placed two orders for this one.  The flavors can only be described as succulent and mesmerizing.  Every bite was delectable and the sauce was delicious.  I think the portion sizing could be larger for this one.  It felt more like an appetizer to me than an entree.  I scarfed those little pieces of ravioli down.\\n\\nThe Salmon Pate was pretty solid.  A nice, thick, flavorful spread.  Fresh with an appetizing consistency.  The grilled bread had all sorts of seeds on it, much like an everything bagel.\\n\\nSalt & Pepper Eggplant was disappointing.  Simply put, it was too salty!\\n\\nPork and Foie Gras Terrine was OK.  This was also served with small pieces of toasted bread, though not of the \\"everything\\" variety that the Salmon Pate was served with.  The terrine came with a raisin and mustard spread.  Together, not bad, but I'm not sure if I'd order it again.\\n\\nThe Kraut and Beer Brats is a reliable standby which I've had here before.  The plate consists of two jumbo bratwursts over a huge pile of sauerkraut.  At first, you may be overwhelmed by the amount of sauerkraut, but it's good stuff.\\n\\nI am by no means a beer aficionado, so I will refrain from commenting on the beers.  I will say the Delirium Tremens is one of the more popular beers here.  It comes in a glass with pink elephants.

The place seemed nice with delightful decor. The sacks full of spices placed at the entryway definitely build up your appetite! They had some mild Marathi music going on in the background which helped with the authentic ambience! We obviously wanted to order everything on the menu but we restricted ourselves to chicken korma, malwani chicken, malwani prawns, soulkari, Batata wada and lamb samosa ( I promise the list is over now) . The chicken korma and both malwani curries had authentic taste and were very well prepared. This was my first time tasting soulkari and I have to say I can't believe I went 26 years without knowing about soulkari. It is really the food for your soul! The batata Wanda was pretty unimpressive. The mashed potato filling did not promise much flat our and neither did the chutney. The lamb pakoras were good, but nothing to drool over.

Gourmet hot dogs? How could this possibly be bad?\\nWell...let me tell you...\\n\\nFirst the service was polite, if a tad slow. The decor was alright, think Portland Industrial chic. For a former Pizzacato location, it wasn't bad. \\n\\nThe flavors of the toppings were alright. Not great, but alright. The garlic mayo was probably the best ingredient on each dog we ordered. The bacon was nice and crisp, and the mushrooms were nicely sauteed. \\n\\nMy single biggest issue was the dogs themselves. Ours were extremely overcooked- probably held too long in a warmer or steam table vat. When the sausage itself is bad everything else is going to pale by comparison. The all-beef dog did not seem gourmet at all, but merely a grocery store (or Sysco) 4\\" hotdog. \\n\\nWe also tried their nacho tots. Sounded great, but they were also disappointing. There was no seasoning or flavors to suggest nachos other than the toppings. There also was not enough nacho cheese to cover the entire platter of tots. A smattering of shredded cheddar, chopped onions, and a teaspoon each of sour cream, packaged guacamole and bland salsa. \\n\\nOverall I think the concept of a sit down hot dog restaurant is doomed to fail. $7 for a 4-inch dog? No drink, no sides. There doesn't seem to be enough value here to justify the price. To be full I would have to eat two and now its a $14 meal sans beverage or sides.\\n\\nCompared to Costco's $1.50 for a 1/4# polish and 20-ounce soda MADdogs was extremely overpriced. For a gourmet comparison, you can get a true gourmet dog from The Nomad's foodcart- a real handcrafted sausage with homemade toppings for $5.50. Buy two and The Nomad gives you a free bag of chips.  \\n\\nSummary: skip this place.

Pambiche has not only been superior to all other Cuban restaurants I have blessed with my culinary dollars, they  rank very, very high against other restaurants in general.  Even though they are always busy, service is quick and friendly.  It's a great place for a first date or to even take a large family and seating is offered both inside and out of doors (they do have heat lamps outside, when the whether turns chilly).  The food is authentically traditional and being that the business is owned and operated by a Cuban family, this should be expected.  While seating may be slightly limited, any wait is worth it.  My biggest problem is I love everything on the menu, ranging from their various empanada choices to the ropa vieja, which is a shredded flank steak, slowly cooked to perfection in a tomato based sauce.  You really won't go wrong with the beans & rice and I'm still amazed that I love their pickled beats (I LOATHE pickled beats, as a rule).  I tend to crave medianoches, so will do a little rave dance right now over Pambiche's (-So glad you can't see me with my white man overbite actually do the rave dance!).  Just to get you drooling though, medianoche is thinly sliced ham, on top of thinly sliced (often smoked) pork with a layer of melted Swiss cheese topped off with yellow mustard and dill pickles on a Cuban-style roll.  It is then grilled like a panini.  Medianoche literally translates to \\"Midnight\\" sandwich, as this was often the tide-me-over after a hard night of dancing in Cuba.

I gave them the benefit of the doubt that maybe it was because it was insanely busy that particular day, and decided to give them one more shot. NOPE! This visit was definitely less than stellar. I only gave them 1 star because the server waiting on us this time was super friendly and nice. The last time we were there the server was rude and scolded us that we couldn't place orders with her when she had a tray in her hand. I've served for years, and never had a tray be an issue to take orders.  Other than our server being friendly last night, I would give this place no stars if possible. \\n\\nFirst off, we arrived around 6:45pm to be in time for the Portland Trailblazers opening game of the season, which started at 7:00pm. We sat down and waited about 15 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. I feel that they must under-staff this place, or people just don't want to work here. It was also the same experience during the previous visit. Looking around it looked like there was only one server on the floor. We ordered drinks and food at the same time. It took almost 40 minutes for our food to arrive. I ordered the BBQ burger, and my friend ordered a pizza. (I'm assuming that the pizza is what took so long) No big deal, as I know that type of food does takes time.Once again....benefit of the doubt was given. Once the food arrived, the pizza was piping hot and my burger and fries were cold. I ate one of the fries...cold. Took a bite of my burger...cold. When the server came back I let her know that the burger and fries were cold. I mentioned that the cook probably cooked the burger while the pizza was still cooking and it sat in the window and got cold. She said to me, \\"You must work in the service industry to say that.\\"  \\n\\nShe didn't complain or give me any attitude, and she took it back to get it corrected. When it came back, it was obvious it had probably been microwaved. It was the same exact burger because my bite mark from my first bite was still there. Granted, it was a lot warmer and the fries were hot...but because it was reheated, the burger was tough and cooked completely well done now. (I ordered it medium, but it also didn't arrive medium) The cheese was also thinned out and almost non-existent because of the re-heat job too. It was AWFUL!  The BBQ sauce was practically non-existent as well. For the menu to say that the burger is \\"smothered\\" in BBQ sauce, makes that a complete lie. There was maybe one little squirt of BBQ sauce on it. I ate as much of it as I could tolerate. There was at least half of it left on my plate. I didn't want to bother complaining about it any further. It was definitely NOT worth the $12.50 they're asking for it. They should have re-made the burger instead of being cheap and re-heating it.....OR cooked it by timing it correctly with the other order the first time. Letting it sit for a period of time and getting cold is a good way to cause food poisoning. The cooks there should know that.\\n\\nIn other crappy news with this experience.....we came to watch the Blazer game. When we arrived there was a decent crowd there watching the World Series. It was pretty much on every TV. No biggie, that's expected. We assumed since it's a bar in Portland, they would turn some of the TV's on to the Blazer game. Seems pretty standard for a home team right? Game started at 7:00pm and here it was at least 10 after 7 and several TV's had sports news on them. Not the Blazers, not the World Series, not any type of sports game. Just news. There was ONE TV with the Blazer game on above the bar. My friend had to go up to the bar to ask someone to change some of the TV's to the Blazer game. 3 other tables near us were commenting about the same thing and were there for the Blazer game as well. It was ironic that the staff was wearing Blazer shirts, yet seemed so unaware of the game. For a sports bar, you should really be on top of this type of stuff. People go to sports bars to watch sports. \\n\\nIt's a shame that this place sucks so bad. It's in a great location for a lot of people who live in the area, including myself. The size of it alone makes it great to watch sports, and they have a good set up with lots of TV's to support sports viewing of all types of sports. But to not even be prepared for your own home team starting off their season....that's pretty pathetic. \\n\\nThe service is painfully slow (it takes FOREVER to get a refill or to receive another drink), the food is awful and obviously not prepared properly, and the attentiveness to sports viewing was disappointing. I have ZERO desire to ever go back."},{"name":"Trident Booksellers & Caf√©","address":"338 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"STAY AWAY FROM THIS DIRTY BUSINESS!!\\n\\nI had two very disturbing experiences at this substandard business in the past week. Two nights ago at around 11 pm I ordered a wheat grass shot and a what was supposed to be a fresh juice. As soon as I sipped the wheat grass I had to spit it out. It tasted like warm urine (I have no clue what that tastes like). It was very salty and foul. The staff was very insensitive and callous, and said \\"Well, that is how wheat grass tastes.\\" I asked how long ago the wheat grass juice had been, the staff started to equivocate, and then said something like  \\"I think maybe  20 minutes ago....you don't need to have fresh wheatgrass.\\" I explained that it was warm and too foul tasting to drink. Then, out loud in front of all the other staff and customers she yelled across counter to the cashier to refund my money \\"because it isn't to his liking.\\" She said this is a very condescending way. Then I went to taste the juice, and this was completely diluted with water, and had no flavor whatsoever. Of course this perturbed other staff, so I asked them to try an sample of it to see, which they wouldn't. I ended up getting a full refund.\\n\\nSeveral nights prior to that around the same time of night I ordered a what was supposed to be a fresh juice and wheat grass. There were barely any customers there, yet 25-35 minutes went by and nobody had made my juice. I asked very politely why they hadn't made my juice and wheat grass, and they finally gave it to me.  The juice was ok, but the wheatgrass was warm and slightly foul tasting (not as foul as the more recent experience). Since I am usually a very polite customer, I didn't return it \\n\\nWhen I called to complain to the manager or owner after the second experience, the staff refused to put me in touch with the manager or the owner. They stated that the owner does not take complaints form customers. I insisted on speaking to the owner, and I was told once again that this definitely could not happen. I still left my phone number and told them that I expected someone to contact me. \\n\\nSince nobody contacted me, and I am convinced that a bodily substance could have been in my wheatgrass, I have decided to post my complaint on yelp.

But the fishermen's soup was heavy on the tomato and had some unrecognizable chunks of overdone seafood. Our daughter was nearly finished with her shrimp (that's saying a lot for a 3-year-old) when our food came after a substantial wait, and in spite of that wait, our fish was merely warm, overdone, and presented poorly. The \\"crown\\" of butter on both dishes was just bland, not what I was expecting from something called ginger-lime butter. To top it off, I'm feeling the after-effects of something I ate that evidently wasn't fresh.

I requested online to be close to the seafood display and bar as well as a table for six. I also made the reservation a month in advance. When we arrived we were placed 4 person high top table which could not possibly fit 6 people comfortable. We were told that it was our fault since we requested to be near the seafood and bar. I tried to explain that night that - if an additional table had been added to our space, that would have worked but we were given two, two-person tables to fit 6 people. Now, this is not a cheap restaurant- and they had plenty of time to figure things out...something like 30 days. The manager told us that they suddenly got really busy and that is why they could not accommodate our party....All of this hassle completely ruined our dinner, embarrassed us in front of our guests and made the whole experience poor. Row 34 has not responded to any complaints from us- not even an email to say sorry. I guess this restaurant is only their to fill their money bags and not really take good care of their clients.

It does have anchovies and undercooked eggs, if you're squeamish about those type things, but those are also precisely the ingredients that make the dish memorable (plus quality Parmesan). I've made a meal out of this salad and the luscious mac n' 3cheeses - sinfully good! \\n\\nI'm also a fan of the shrimp blt and shrimp and grits, the former because of the lemony shrimp and the later because of the creamy grits. Their fries are delicious - strong on garlic, but, hey, it's good for your heart! And I'm a personal fan of their salt and vinegar popcorn, although I do realize it's not exactly a culinary creation, and my dining partners have often said it's waaaaay to vinegary. Not for me - yum!\\n\\nMy husband (meat-eater) is a fan of their cheeseburger and reuben. Both looked bigger than average. I can't wait to come back for brunch! \\n\\nThe cons to the Porter: (1) Crowds - it is a small place that is not very handicapped accessible nor good for dining at rush hour if you don't want to wait long (2) Staff - more than a few times an item we ordered did not arrive, or we had to walk up to the bar to order our drinks because service was PAINFULLY slow. As I mentioned, The Porter is in the heart of L5P, so the staff are very....eccelctic. That in itself is not a bad thing, but when you add their grimy appearances to their \\"I loathe serving you\\" attitude, it can be off-putting. \\n\\nBut the cons are not enough to keep me away from the Porter!

We had a few tapas and really wanted to try the Paella as the main. The tapas were tasty..the mahi ceviche was the best--great flavor, the octopus tapa was overwhelmed by the potatoes which was a shame bc it had great flavor as well. I hoped there would be a bit more meat in the meat tapas maybe they will work on that part--but the overall taste was great in these tapas. The 2 person paella was just OK.

There were several people waiting out front for a table, so I was afraid it'd take forever to get in, but we were seated with a group of 5 fairly quickly.  Granted, we were seated at a 4-person table, with a chair crammed in at the end, and it's a good thing we were all good friends to begin with because it was, erm, cozy.\\n\\n(While waiting for a table, we had a few drinks at the bar.  The bartender is not on top of his game at all.  He seemed rather clueless, really.)\\n\\nThe service was TERRIBLE.  It took an hour and a half for us to get our food.  We had ordered a few plates of sushi rolls as appetizers, and they came out 15 minutes apart from one another.  When our entrees were finally served, my boyfriend had to wait an extra 10 minutes on his.\\n\\nThe most obnoxious part of this was that, as we were waiting on our food, the waiter kept saying, \\"It'll be right out, it'll be just a few minutes, it'll be out next...\\"  Then I'd watch him take food to another table first...and another...and another.  Dude, don't LIE to me about it, just feed me already.\\n\\nI had sushi for my entree and it was nothing special.  The tempura shrimp within one of my rolls was cold.  My boyfriend ordered a curry dish with 2 (out of 3) peppers, according to the menu.  I tried it and it was not spicy at all.  (It wasn't bad, but it was not spicy as advertised.)\\n\\nAt the end of the meal, I went to use the bathroom, and found that there was no toilet paper.  Not only was there no paper, but there wasn't even the roll or any sign that toilet paper--or paper towels, for that matter--had been there at all.  I asked a waitress, who said, \\"Oh gosh, you didn't go yet, did you?\\"  Um, no?  She appeared to have known that the bathroom was paperless but forgotten, and she and a waiter awkwardly ran in and put toilet paper and paper towels in there, all in a flurry.  I should mention that at this point, it was 10:30pm.  Surely I wasn't the first person who had tried to use the ladies' room at that point.\\n\\nMaybe it's just a bad idea to come here on weekends?

The filet was cooked perfectly to a medium-rare and was melt in your mouth delight, but the dipping sauces didn't add anything to the meat. And the sides, which are supposed to complement the entree, were subpar in my opinion. The mashed potatoes were grainy and reminded me of mashed potatoes from a powder mixture. I think this was my first time eating creamed spinach and it did not wow me at all. The bread pudding that came out at the end was barely warm and it seemed as if they bought a massive supply of these little muffin shaped pieces of bread and held it under a heat lamp to rewarm.\\n\\nBecause it's Dine Out Boston you're essentially paying $25 for just that piece of meat, while all those sides are probably worth pennies to them."},{"name":"New India Cuisine","address":"2304 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This place is pricey for indian food.

I came from server culture, so I know the little nits that bother all servers and bartenders, but the underlying and most important thing to keep in mind is that this is the service industry. In the service industry, which spans from restaurants and hotels to sales organizations in Fortune 500 companies and even the federal government, the main goal is satisfying your clients. So, I guess I made a mistake by approaching the bar for service when I was sitting at a table; however, I certainly did not need a bartender to speak so rudely to me, and instruct me to go back to my table for the server would take care of me. I don't know if she's having a bad day, for if she is, I am sorry for that, but you never take your own personal issues out on a customer. I'm still missing the harm in just serving a beer from the bar instead of through the server, if that really was my violation. Satisfy the customers, that's the job.

I love rice in ALL its forms - there, I said it.\\n\\nThe nice people who bring your drinks and bill to the table have been the same folks for years.  I've never seen that kind of zero turnover in waitstaff anywhere else.\\n\\nI have no idea whether Alborz serves authentic Persian cuisine - the fact that Persia doesn't exist as a country any more means they can probably be a little loose on the interpretation of Persian food.

I like the vibe, the decor, and the hip hop 90s music so I'm giving it a three, but the food and drink-noo. We started with the much lauded fried chicken. There was good flavor somewhere there, but it was buried under the heavy handed batter and sickly sweet sauce. I'm a fan of gochujang like the next person, but holy shit this was too much. After a few pieces I was pretty tired of eating it. Plain rice or some veggies could have made it more palatable, but with the ciopinno pancake and dan dan noodles it was too much. The chicken was also soggy which was disappointing. \\n\\nThe ciopinno pancake wasn't too bad. It was much thicker than a pancake, but it was decent. The dan dan noodles on the other hand were such a bummer. I think I have a preconceived notion of dan dan noodles and the flavors I was hoping for from my fave szechuan restaurant in Philly. The dan dan noodles tasted nothing like what I fondly recall. These were sweet and difficult to eat. We had a few bites and left the whole bowl fairly untouched.\\n\\nMy cocktail (I think it was with mezcal) was poorly mixed and our server seemed like he wished he was anywhere but at work.

The service was phenomenal.  \\n\\nThe food was pure sex.  The flavor was excellent in both.  I received good quantities of fresh ravioli in well crafted sauces.  The asparagus in my butternut squash ravioli was good and the tomato in the lobster ravioli was good.  I think their recipes are genius.  And everything was piping hot.  You know you received a good meal when your nose is watering as much as your mouth.  I think all the flavors in each dish really complemented each other well and nothing clashed.  I think I will try the prosciutto ravioli next time, because I am the Ravioli King.  The price for all this food with a coke was 38 dollars and change, which I thought was more than fair given the quality and quantity of food, and also the area this establishment resides.  I gave a tip well in excess of 15 percent since my experience was so good, and the staff worked so hard on a busy Friday night.  This restaurant takes cash only so don't be a stranger to the ATM.

It chipped my tooth.\\n\\nI'm really surprised to see how many positive reviews are on here for this place. \\n\\nI was pretty excited to check out Red Lentil (one of my good friends lives around the corner from the place and I'm there a lot) but I was quickly incredibly disappointed. The food on the menu looks pretty good and the three of us ordered a few small things and an entree. The first thing that came out was the ginger-miso soup. My friend immediately noted that it was cold, there was no tofu in it, and flavorless other than the overpoweringly ginger taste. I had a sip of the soup and made a face that made my friends laugh. After the rest of our appetizers were brought out, we asked her to heat the soup back up, thinking that it might make it taste better, but the luke-warm soup (even after she brought us a new one) could not be saved.\\n\\nWe also got the soy chicken strips, sesame encrusted seitan and caesar salad. The soy chicken strips were good, but was basically a morning star breaded chik'n patty (or whatever brand) cut into smaller pieces with a decent BBQ sauce. It was everyone's favorite, but we all agreed if we knew it was going to be something we could buy in the grocery store and defrost, we would have rather not have gotten it. The sesame seitan had good flavor, but was chewy. Texture-wise, it was just mushy microwaved seitan. The horseradish sauce it came with was just atrocious (extremely bitter) and ruined the flavor of the seitan. I enjoyed the seitan in context of the salad because the salad added some crunch and the seitan flavors covered up the taste of the salad. \\n\\nThe sweet potato quesadilla was alright.. Extremely boring, but one of the few palatable things. I'm confused as to why they picked the vegetables they did to put in there because they were not complimentary of each other and they were cut into random sized pieces. The salsa tasted like it got poured directly from a jar into a ramekin. I was so hungry though I ended up finishing the last two slices (my cohorts each ate a slice... well that's not true either, they each ate some of a slice because they liked it less than I did).\\n\\nThen I was eating my salad. It wasn't very good, but I was hungry, and like I said, it was pretty decent with the seitan. About 5 bites in I almost started crying and not because it was so good. Quite the opposite. Not all of the olives were pitted and I chipped one of my teeth on the pit. Awhile later, the waitress stopped by and I inquired if the olives were supposed to have pits, and she said no. So I told her what happened and sent back my salad. She offered to bring me a new one but my mouth was hurting so I declined. The pain and lack of faith in Red Lentil made me decline.\\nThe girl that was our waitress was nice, but didn't spend any time at the table. Each time we needed something, we had to wait for awhile for her to get to us. \\nI'd rather find a vegetarian option somewhere else. Unlike someone who said that it is nice to have a non-greasy non-asian option in Watertown, I'd rather get the oily general tso's tofu over this food any day. I was so disappointed with the food and quality of service and on top of that, upset with chipping of my tooth. I know I sound like a drama queen, but if you chipped your tooth at a restaurant, with teeth as beautiful as mine, you would probably be as sad too. \\nI am not going back!"},{"name":"Alfredo's","address":"229 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4.5","text":"Stopped in this evening for a first visit.

Both were excellent.  The mushrooms in goat cheese and the tuna tartare were also pretty good.  We were a bit disappointed in the shrimp.  My husband ate one that must've been a bit older and had a very fishy taste.  We ordered some pitchers of white sangria.  It was good and not too sweet which we liked, but there was barely any alcohol in it.  I'm sadly usually good to go after two glasses.  I had four glasses and was still speaking coherently and wasn't telling stories that weren't made for public telling.  Either I grew a tolerance for alcohol overnight - and if I didn't build a tolerance during my 4 years of college debauchery, I highly doubt I will now - or the sangria was wayyyyyyyyy weak.  As we were walking to our cars, silence fell over my group of friends.  Finally, one piped up and said, \\"It wasn't as good as I was expecting.\\"  We all nodded in agreement.  We expected more from a place that still had a line out the door at 10:30pm.  A place that has been crowded since the day it opened about 9 months ago.  I found the food and drinks to be better at the old Loca Luna (when they were still on Juniper) and Cafe Tu Tu Tango.  Obviously, many do not share my opinion as this place seems to be THE spot to be every night of the week."},{"name":"Golden China Express","address":"3636 Main St","city":"Hilliard","stars":"4","text":"This is one of the best mom and pop Chinese place around this area.

The Peachtree Road location is much closer to my house, but the wait is always significantly shorter at the Brookhaven location. If I call in my group when I leave my apartment, by the time we get to Dresden Rd, a table is usually ready. \\n\\nAtlanta breakfast spots are held to a high standard and this J. Chris location falls right in the middle for me.  The waiters here are either really spacey or overly attentive.  Though the wait staff can be hit or miss, the food typically comes out really fast regardless.  The interior has the homey diner feel and the walls are covered with Americana art work. \\n\\nThe menu is really large and rather comprehensive which is a nice change from the 8 to 10 options you find at a lot of places.  Instead of one or two omelette choices, there are 6 or 7. On my most recent visit I ordered the turkey and avocado skillet with over easy fried eggs. All of the skillets come with a fluffy biscuit.  Their biscuits were definitely frozen at some point in time, but they aren't bad and you can substitute an English muffin it you are feeling extra biscuit snobby. I prefer the skillets to the omelettes or variations of eggs Benedict. I find their food on the less flavorful side, but it certainly isn't bad.\\n\\nRarely my first choice for brunch or breakfast, but a classic stand by none the less.

We knew the place was worth the wait when we saw a father waiting outside in the cold with a baby in the stroller on a cold Boston day for his take out order (he was there for more than 30min). They give you bread to start which was warm and fresh. The pasta is freshly made each day and their in house sauce is awesome - nothing like it out there. I ordered the seafood pasta with linguine and their house sauce and I couldn't get enough of it. The pasta was nice and hot and the portions are very generous. We had the small fried calamari for USD8.00 to start. It's made to order so you knew you were getting the freshest stuff. If you come with a friend/date, I would suggest getting the dinner for 2 which comes with a variety of seafood in your pasta and sauce of choice for USD60.00 and if you add a bottle of wine it's only USD75.00 - this deal is amazing because the portions are huge so there are lots for everyone and you will definitely be stuffed at the end.

The summary of this review is CoM is a spectacular restaurant.  The passion for their food permeates through all of the staff.  I find its casual upscale vibe very appealing.  My basis is limited (mostly restaurants in Chicago and Boston) but this place is my gold standard for restaurant excellence.\\n\\nWhat's amazing is I've dined here over a handful of times and I remember everything I've eaten from the rotating seasonal menu except for maybe the desserts (I'm not much of a dessert guy).  Notable standouts include olive oil poached halibut over beets (the best fish dish I've ever had), pork three ways, and grilled octopus with citrus flavors (an appetizer).  I also recommend getting the bone marrow as a side to share.  \\n\\nThe first time I dined here was for brunch with my now fianc√©.  We started playing a game to see if our glasses of water would ever go beyond half empty (it was a warm summer day).  They never did.  Needless to say we left well hydrated and were impressed by the attentive service.  For brunch, I usually look for something with a poached egg and the donut and the hot chocolate (containing flavors I've never experience before) are worthy additions.  \\n\\nMy most recent visit here was to try the heralded burger.  My fianc√© and I arrived 30 min early on a Saturday to make sure we would be seated at the bar.  We ended up being the first ones served the burger that night.  I ordered the burger medium rare with bacon.  In short, the burger is perfect and I wouldn't change a thing.  It is beyond me how it is so juicy.  The flavor of the bone marrow that is added to the patty really comes through.  I really like their house made ketchup (conventional ketchup I find too sweet) and the potato wedges are a great compliment to the burger.\\n\\nMy final note is half the times I've dined here, I've been served by the older gentleman.  I have to admit, I initially thought he was a little brusque.  I also tend to mispronounce the French terms on the menu which elicited a look from him as if he's saying \\"are you sure you can handle the level of food you will be eating?\\"  But like any good server, he is attentive and politely answers any questions.

However, the noise is still a problem and there were times were we practically had to yell to talk to each other even though the table wasn't large at all.  Overall, we enjoyed the atmosphere and everybody was impressed by the knowledgeable and kind staff who served us throughout the night.\\n\\nEverybody's favourite was the Coquotte Moules Frites (we shared mussels as an appetizer even though it's an entree) and we managed to soak up a lot of the broth with their bread roll, which we ordered on the side.  The portion is quite massive and the dip that came with the fries was amazing.  We loved how the pot of mussels contained a copious amount of smoked bacon and spring onion, which was enough to accompany each and every mussel!  Honestly, we enjoyed the mussels, fries, bread and dessert more than the actual entrees (although the lamb was actually extremely tender).\\n\\nI would honesty give them 4.5 stars but because of the mussels, I rounded it up rather than down.  The only things that we did not enjoy were:\\n1) They forgot that it was a birthday celebration, so there was no specific celebratory dish even though we ordered desserts. (They confirmed with us twice and still forgot, which lead to much disappointment after an amazing meal)\\n2) You have to pay for the bread, which doesn't really make sense if you're ordering mussels (since their broth is so good!)\\n3) It was extremely loud and we felt that a few tables were competing over who could be the loudest (not that anybody can do anything about it I suppose haha)\\n4) The kobe beef \\"le beouf\\" dish was neither cold nor hot, but room temperature.

As I told my husband this, he laughed and said it was probably true and that's how their food is so fresh.  Later, he told me that it was just the birds that like to hang out on the Don Pedro roof and billboard nearby and that he had thought the same thing until he saw them flying away once.  \\n\\nThe beef tongue tacos were actually pretty good and not as scary as they sound.  They tasted like tender pieces of beef served in the same style as my fish taco.  The nachos were also good, but average.  They did have a large amount of toppings which was a bonus.

I am very picky about atmosphere, service, and obviously quality of the food, and I have to say that this was one of the best meals I have ever had. We started off with the mussels in pesto sauce with garlic bread (a must for wiping up the delicious sauce) and then split the lobster ravioli (unreal). The prices were very reasonable for a North End Boston meal and our server was very friendly. The food came out very quickly. It is a small place and there is always a line down the street to get in (we arrived at 4:20ish so as not to wait in line and were outside by 5). The only downside is the rushed feeling of in and out you get from waiting, sitting down, eating, and then leaving. They really need to keep things moving in order to accomodate the customers outside who really want a bite! But, if you are in the mood for an incredible meal and do not mind the wait followed by a fast paced dining experience Giacomo's has to offer, then you should definitely check it out.

I had a massive test in a class and was trying to find somewhere other than my apartment to accomplish my work.  Pulling out of my parking garage, I grazed a concrete pole and my side view mirror fell off.  I came to Mozarts in this state; disheveled, stressed, and definitely out of sorts.\\n\\nNever being there before I looked at the menu and decided on a slice of carrot cake and a cup of coffee.  Three dollars for a cup?  That seems quite expensive.  Wait, did I read bottomless?  Yes, that's right. I can irresponsibly indulge in a caffeine coma for three dollars. Awesome.  I went up to the counter and got distracted.  Hold on, those cupcakes look yummy too! The guy behind the counter just smiled at me as though this was a frequent dilemma. I firmly stood by my carrot cake decision though and went to grab a seat on the patio.\\n\\nMany people were studying here as well, so I figured it wouldn't be difficult to hunker down and get to business.  I was wrong.  Mainly because my head kept going oooh look at the water.  Oohh and the hills.  Well, what a pretty sunset.  Perhaps I'm too much of a nature lover to study here, or I was simply too distracted that day.  I see this more as a very chill date place or a place to catch up with old and comfortable friends.  \\n\\nCircumstances of my day considered, I should have hated this place.  Who likes anywhere when you just had an accident that will cost you three hundred to repair your car? Regardless of that fact and my disgusting lack of studying, I still like this place!"},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Upon moving up to Boston last year, Craigie on Main quickly became one of those places I really wanted to try, thanks in part to the combined praises of James Beard and Yelp. Unfortunately, there was the issue of \\"when.\\" Reservations here aren't always easy to come by, particularly for a party of five seeking a weekend date between 6 and 8 pm. The solution if you're in my shoes is, of course, to plan ahead (like a month or more ahead). Trust me, it's worth it.\\n\\nCraigie did not disappoint: everything was pretty darn outstanding. To start, the ambiance is great. The staff is serious about the food (and drink), but not stuffy, and the restaurant has a laid back, slightly hipster but not obnoxiously so, feel. It's modern, yet comfortable; upscale, but down-to-earth--if this makes any sense at all, the restaurant feels \\"real.\\" There's also an open kitchen... if you can snag the chef's table, do it.\\n\\nLibations-wise, the wine and spirit menus are both nicely assembled. I started out my evening with a glass of the house-made fortified wine, which was oh so delicious--not too sweet, with a lovely citrus note. Meanwhile, others in my party had a grand old time with the wine list, which included many nicely priced options and unexpected finds.\\n\\nIf you're into the \\"snout-to-tail\\" style of dining, Craigie's is definitely for you. That being said, there are also plenty of options if you're like me and tend to stick with tamer fare. For an appetizer, I went with the pumpkin soup, which I enjoyed greatly, though others at my table commented that they found the curry flavor to be a bit strong. The soup also came with a small grilled cheese sandwich, which was deliciously buttery--the two cheeses had that perfect amount of tang you expect a good grilled cheese to have, without being too sharp. Others at my table very much enjoyed the octopus, which they deemed to be well-prepared and what I believe was a smoked trout? salad (I'm afraid at this point I was so absorbed in my fortified wine that I did a less-than-admirable job of paying attention to other dishes around me).\\n\\nFrom the pumpkin soup, I moved onto the slow-roasted chicken breast, in further testament to the fact that you really don't need to have an interest in consuming a pig's head to enjoy Craigie's (but go ahead and enjoy it if that's you're thing--it's the place for that too). This might have been my favorite dish on the night. Somehow it had the lovely tenderness of sous vide chicken, but the superior taste and texture of roast chicken. In addition to the chicken itself, the plate as a whole was well put together: the carrot puree and apricots added a subtle sweetness, which beautifully complemented the savory chicken and earthiness of the mushrooms. Others at my table enjoyed the tautog and the pork three ways a great deal, as well as the side of marrow bones.\\n\\nBy this point in the meal I was debating whether or not I really needed dessert, but then the dessert menu came and the decision was made for me... the malted milk parfait sounded too good to pass up. And it was: the chocolate cake, the malted milk ice cream, and the saltiness of the peanuts (to cut all that sweetness) left me a very happy, albeit full, camper. My table also tried the affogato, which was simply delicious, and the trio of sorbets, where the concord grape was a surprising stand out.\\n\\nOverall, this was an excellent experience... if you're into food, I really can't recommend Craigie's enough."},{"name":"Harvard Gardens","address":"316 Cambridge St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"3.25 \\n\\nI can practically see this place from my apt, so I've been there quite a few times by now, especially for last call.

It's like if Newbury Comics opened up their book section -- you get everything from hard to find books, to cult classics, comic books, timeless classics, and a bunch of stuff in between.

I found The Salty Pig here on Yelp and decided to run with it. I chose it for two reasons - we had a seafood-allergy in the group that didn't allow us to go to any of the many seafood places in Boston, and because we had a large group to seat, but we didn't want to spend a fortune on a private room or group fees. The Salty Pig agreed to host us without hesitation.\\n\\nSo, we arrived on a Wednesday night and were quickly seated at a line of tables against the back wall. We requested a set of tasting appetizers and drinks right away. It did take a few minutes for those things to arrive, but when they did we were all VERY happy. We had sausages and cheeses and toasted bread with spreads and the most delicious pickles I think I've ever tasted in my life! SO good.\\n\\nWithout knowing what we were doing, most of us then ordered pizzas as our entrees - BIG mistake, but also a hilarious mistake. Eight out of ten of us (mostly small women) had 14\\" pizzas of our own to eat. It looked ridiculous to have so much food delivered, but we laughed our arses off about it and ate as much as we could. The pizzas were really delicious, and those two who didn't order a pizza loved their pastas.\\n\\nThe Salty Pig was fun, delicious and really memorable. And it was filled with attractive, trendy Bostoners who've clearly found a gem in their Back Bay neighborhood.

BBQ is the best. I've been to all the \\"best\\" places: Snow's in Lexington, Black's, Smitty's, and Kreuz all in Lockhart. They got nothing on the Salt Lick!\\n\\nThe secret is in the basting of the meats. They are constantly basting the meat with their awesome sauce while it slowly cooks over an open fire. All those juices continue to marinate and infuse into the meat. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water!\\n\\nMost other bbq place use a dry rub which don't do any justice to the meat. Your seasoning needs to dig deep into the meat and that's why Salt Lick's sauce works.\\n\\nAll the food groups are represented: brisket, ribs, and sausage. =) They also have beef ribs which are good too, but I fancy the pork ribs. There's also chicken and turkey on the menu, but who eats that??\\n\\nThe best cut of all is the burnt end brisket. They don't advertise it at all. I've been going to Salt Lick for over 15 years, and I never knew about it until my good buddy Adam Richman of Man vs. Food came down to Austin.\\n\\nIt is the holy grail of bbq. Super-infused juicy meat. Although it's burnt, the meat melts in your mouth. There is an explosion of smokey goodness. You gotta try it!! Every time I get brisket, that's all I ask for. Once you've had it, all other brisket taste super dry and have no flavor.\\n\\nYou also have coleslaw, potatoes, and bread to compliment the meal. And don't forget the pickles and onions. I usually don't like slaw (most places put too much mayo), but the slaw here is a perfect balance--not to saucy, and there's a good crunch.\\n\\nThe location is kinda far out there. It's in a dry county so BYOB. It's fun though. It looks like a country cabin and you and your friends sit at long wooden tables.\\n\\nYou can't go wrong here!"},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The wait on line is longer than other places in the North End, but the food is absolutely worth it. As a party of two, we waited for 25-30 minutes and were seated at the bar which is cool and different. We had plenty of time to look at the menu while we were outside so we ordered immediately after sitting down.\\n\\nSince the restaurant is so small, the service is quick and efficient. Food comes to your table within 10 minutes. We ordered a small calamari, the pumpkin tortellini and the scallops in the Giacomo sauce over linguini.  The portions were just right for the price and the quality was fantastic. I enjoyed every single bite of the entire meal. I also took some of my pasta home and the leftovers were fantastic the next day.

It was also a testament to the bar- dark and grundy enough for many, safe and smoke free for the baby. What else comes to mind? The specialty cocktail list sounds amazing but doesn't deliver- what sounded like an awesomely handcrafted cocktail turned out to taste exactly like a mojito (it had basil in the description... it may be just me, but when I see basil, I assume handcrafted and classy, not minty mojito).

THat's the only criticism I have of the place though.\\n\\nAs of writing it doesn't have a license for hard liquor--only beer and wine.  this is sort of tricky because they use liquors that are similar in flavor but have a lower proof.

I too had seen the owner on Chopped and as a person that's always on the hunt for ethnic restaurants this was at the top of my list. I chose this restaurant for brunch this morning because the menu looked fantastic and it was different. Service was gruff to say the least which was surprising since my companion and I were the ONLY two people in the restaurant!!! I asked for a double espresso because it was brunch and the waitress' response was the machine was broken. Fine, I can accept that. I then asked for a regular cup of coffee. Her response was that they had no coffee. Who doesn't have coffee? Seriously? No coffee? She informed me that she had tea, I'm sorry but tea is not equal to coffee. If you can boil water for tea, I think you could find me a way to have a cup of coffee. I had my coffee that I brewed at home in tow hiding out in my purse and asked if I could drink it. She was adamant that I was not allowed to drink it because if an inspector was to come into the restaurant and see me drinking something they didn't serve me they would get in trouble because it was on their menu. They refused to serve me coffee so I don't understand the problem! Ridiculous. Now, let's move onto the food. Seriously disappointed. I ordered the Fourr√©e au Poulet, ONE small crepe stuffed with chicken and vegetables (read - potatoes). One small crepe for 8 dollars, 8 dollars!! The chicken was over cooked and dry, if you could kill chicken twice this place managed to do so. The seasoning/spices were fantastic but I couldn't move past the dry chicken. I wanted to order more food because I was starving but when I made eye contact with the waitress, she ignored me and continued futzing with her wine bottles and restocking the bar.

That said, the fresh ingredients and flavorful combinations of toppings is a welcome respite from the glut of franchise pizza a la Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, Dominos, Marcos, Cicis, etc, etc, etc.\\n\\nThat said about the food, the aspect of Antico that makes it unique (love it or hate it) is the dining atmosphere. The restaurant is an unassuming little building. When you walk in the front door you see only one table and one counter to eat at with 10 people in line to order, and think, great, I'm going to be eating my pizza standing up! Upon being told that the main seating area is in the kitchen, you are a bit relieved thinking, there is a place for my family to sit after all. Then you turn the corner into the kitchen to see the 6 or so bench tables full of people with 20 more standing around waiting to pounce on one when it comes open and realize, great, you will likely be eating this pizza standing up after all.\\n\\nThe BYOB and family-style ambience is charming and unique, but it definitely fosters a sit and linger while you finish your bottles of wine approach to dining. In a restaurant with woefully inadequate seating this makes dining here a bit of a gamble and a bit annoying truth be told. As stated above, the pizza is good, but not incredible.  So, if I were just hanging with a friend or two and wanted to bring our own wine or beer it would be cool to squeeze into a table and meet some new folks; however, with 2 young hungry kids who can't really stand at a counter to eat, not the best set-up. Take this info and judge for yourself if it will be the right thing for you. I think this place would surely be more family-friendly off-peak, because it really feels more like a crowded bar during peak hours. I do admit that the kids liked watching the pizza dough being tossed.\\n\\nOh, and one more thing. Given the limitations of the establishment, I do think the food is overpriced.

We were seated and served water really quickly. I noticed that this restaurant is a very fast paced kinda place, which kind of makes you feel rushed. My friend and I ordered our food and also got a side of garlic bread. \\n\\nThe garlic bread was probably the best garlic bread I've ever had because it was so soft and crisp.

I ordered the ziti, shrimp, scallop, with alfredo sauce and it was delicious! Although... They did give me penne pasta, but that didn't really matter to me.

My goal is to try everything in this bakery while I'm still working at my place of employment (it's only a few doors down). I think I'm halfway there. \\n\\nAt lunchtime, the line gets incredibly long and really hard to find seating but if you go before 12 or after 1, it's not as bad. I have tried a few sandwiches that I love: the chicken/brie/arugula is awesome, as is the roast beef sandwich (with horseradish and the crispy onions! mmm..)\\n\\nAnd as for my weekly... err, sometimes daily?... mid-afternoon snack, my favourites are: the Chunky Lola Cookie (oatmeal chocolate chip with coconut shavings!), the Chocolate Chip Macaroon, and even though a slice of carrot cake is about $6, it is one pretty freaking good carrot cake.  I also have nothing bad to say about the homemade Oreo Cookie and the apple spice cake or their chocolate cupcake (which, by the way, is much better than any of those fancy shmancy cupcake joints).\\n\\nIn the mornings, their almond croissants are melt-in-your mouth yummmmy, and the classic banana bread is one of the best I've ever had. I also like the very large blueberry muffin top but it's often hard to finish (Okay that is actually a complete lie, but I refrain from buying it because I know I will definitely eat the whole thing and it really is as big as my head). And, as everyone says, the sticky bun is amazing. Even their basic rolls are delicious -- when I need a sweet tooth break, I really like their country rolls or raisin pecan rolls with butter and jam for breakfast.\\n\\nPlus, they have great coffee. And if you bring in your own mug, it's only 99 cents. Can't beat that, especially since my travel mug is huge.  :) And, they are all super nice."},{"name":"Teranga","address":"1746 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The food is amazing!!

Google Majestic Hotel Portland (add Portland or you may end up with the sadly name-raped Awahnee Hotel in Yosemite) and see how bad this place was before McMenamin's took over.  Kudos for the work!\\n\\nFirst off:  Know that the rooms are TINY and most have NO bathrooms.  A sink, but no bathrooms.  Six rooms at the front, on 12th, do have ensuite baths, so ask.  A lot of folks write in to Yelp, their hackles up, denouncing an old hotel (The St. Francis;  a Biltmore; the Royal Hawaiian) for having small rooms.\\n\\nOld Hotels Have Small Rooms, what part of this is so hard to understand?\\n\\nHowever...\\n\\nThis hotel has TINY rooms, and if on check-in you are still astonished, try to imagine living in one, as people once did!  TINY.  I emailed friends that the place was so gay friendly they don't even have closets!  No closets.  A luggage rack, a Queen bed, two end tables with fabulous lamps and even more fabulous beaded fringe shades;  a vintage chandelier; a sink, a table and two chairs, a bay window in our room (#306) and very VERY heavy drapes which: Greatly muffle street noise;  keep the room much warmer; cut the outside light dramatically.  \\n\\nDon't worry!  There is a nice ceiling heater/air conditioner!  However, the windows only open 3\\" so I have to wonder how effective the heater/air conditioner is in summer...\\n\\n#306 is at the \\"back\\" of the hotel; I point this out because there are two toilet/showers just outside the door, one on each side of the hall, thus, while not ensuite, they're still quite convenient and there are others along the halls.\\n\\nOtherwise, this is quite the campy, Alice in Wonderland-artful place, both in paint choices and original art.  The sort of boutique hotel that would give the late Mr. Kimpton the shivers.  It is sparkling clean, very very well maintained.  The staff is helpful and pleasant, knowledgeable.  The ground floor is completely occupied by restaurants and bars;  with a pool somewhere in its bowels---we didn't go looking for it, but the place was the Club Baths for a while in the seventies, so it figures...\\n\\nLocation! Location!  Location!  \\n\\nBurnside/SW 12th/Stark.  A short walk from Downtown (the MAX station to and from PDX is on 5th/Pioneer square) and the hotel is on 12th, so about 8 blocks---you can also catch MAX straight down Stark, in Old Town.  The Pearl begins on the far side of Burnside;  Whole Foods and the former Henry Weinhard Brewery are both across Burnside from the hotel (there's a brewpub in the former brewery).  Powell's Books is one block further east.\\n\\nNW Portland, along 23rd, is also about a twenty minute flat walk.  You'll find the Pecularium along the way.   \\n\\nNote there is NO parking, although the staff will steer you to lots with and without in and out privileges.  We had signed up with a Seattle based car share, reachnow.com, as Zipcar wasn't being cooperative, and found it to be even better than the former, and a perfect fit for a downtown stay with a trip to the 'burbs.\\n\\nPortlanders, like a lot of Oregonians, do not like to walk.  My cousin not only insisted on driving from the Crystal to NW (20 minutes walking) she took the freeway!  You can even walk across the bridges and be in an Eastside bar (very good chance it being another McMenamins) and shock the hell out of the natives:\\n\\n\\"You walked!?!\\"  I kid you not.\\n\\nI would seriously consider returning to the Crystal, with or without baths.

We all agreed it was the best Minestrone we had ever tasted. My Garganelli with asparagus and cream (vegetarian version of it without the prosciutto) was heavenly, light but with a deeply tasteful cream sauce. Unfortunately for me my son ate half of my plate of pasta also. My husband's spaghetti with garlic and hot peppers was excellent, and fortunately was off-limits to the kids who deemed it too spicy for their palates (we thought it was great). My 79 year old mother enjoyed her Garganelli so much that she, too, ordered a second half-portion. We do love a good meal!

Service was quick to seat and order, but slow to refill drinks. The ticket times were incredibly slow for brunch. It felt like dinner. We waited nearly an hour to eat eggs, toast and grits in addition to two chicken biscuits. I'm not sure if they were light staffed or kitchen was slow, but an hour for 5-minute food is a no no. I wasn't that bothered by the long wait, but hearing diners around me complain was irritating on its own. When our food arrived I was incredibly disappointed. Had my biscuits come out after fifteen minutes I would have been happy, but an hour wait made them taste worse.

As a chicken base, Sapporo takes the cake here. I did appreciate that they do allow chicken as a protein here; everywhere else only offers pork, sometimes tofu.

It's one of the newer farm to table restaurants to arrive on the scene and we had not had the chance to try them before now. If you know me you know I'm a huge proponent of the slow food, slow money farm to table movement. So if there is a place where we can eat that fits that bill I will always prefer it. This is an unexpected find in an oversized strip mall in Winter Springs. The decor is sparse but pleasant. Large multi-paned window frames hang on the walls in a way that suggests an old farm house. \\n\\nAs this was our first visit our very congenial server Sheila, gave us ample time to peruse the wine selections and menu, while we tried to make some decisions. We were surprised to find that they do not have a full liquor license but they offer a reasonable variety and selection of wine and beer. Unfortunately after all our pained deliberations we were notified when a different server/manager/notreallysurehowshefitintotheschemeofthings person came out to tell us that they were out of our first wine choice so we deliberated a bit more and settled on a bottle of The Dreaming Tree Chardonnay. As it turned out this was a perfectly delightful wine and it worked out well. \\n\\nOur appetizer of tempura fried goat cheese $9 came out a bit prematurely while we were still in the midst of our wine deliberations. I would have preferred to have gotten the wine first but the kitchen timing may have been thrown off by the fact that they were out of the first bottle. However, once I tasted those delicately crunchy on the outside, soft and pillowy on the inside cheese bites I didn't care. They were wonderful and the drizzle of honey complimented the slight sharp edge of the creamy goat cheese perfectly.\\n\\nNext we shared a farm salad of fresh greens, bacon lardons, pickled onions, and paper thin sliced beets dressed in a light vinaigrette with a luscious Lake Meadow Naturals poached egg on top. You'll hear no complaints out of me on this one. When we noticed another table being brought some bread, we asked Sheila and she promptly brought some out to us. It was not entirely clear but I suspect it's a situation where if you ask you get it otherwise your table remains breadless.\\n\\nFor our entrees Marty opted for the BBQ Pork $20 which came with house made pickles, corn bread and some fried onions. This pork was juicy and flavorful and incredibly tender. His only wish was that is had come with some kind of starch beyond the bread. I had the Florida Mangrove Snapper $26 which came on top of a leek fondue that included some tender green beans, peeky toe crab meat and a drizzle of truffle oil. Atop the fish were some thinly sliced fried onions. This was without a doubt one of the best cooked pieces of fish I've ever eaten. Perfectly seasoned, the top was wonderfully crisp and caramelized while the flesh below was moist and delicate. It was truly special. The onions also retained every bit of crispiness and the leek fondue below, with pieces of crabmeat added just enough richness to the dish.\\n\\nWe were a little sad to see that we had missed the bread pudding window (the menu changes based on what is available and in season) so we opted to try the mini ice cream sandwiches for our dessert made with almond shortbread cookies. This was the only thing that fell a little short simply because by the time they reached our table they were almond shortbread cookies in a pool of vanilla cream - there was no ice in the equation. To her credit when we pointed out the fact to Sheila that the ice-cream was non existent she offered to take them back and get us new ones. But we had already dug into the cookies and were just spooning the chocolate sauce and what amounted to cr√©me anglaise over them and enjoying the cookies. So while disappointing in terms of in ice cream sandwich experience - the cookies were good.\\n\\nOverall we really enjoyed our meal. This was a special occasion for us and we had noted it in our reservation. The hostess was aware of that fact as she wished us a Happy Anniversary when she brought us menus - however she fell down a bit by not relaying the information to our server. It wasn't until we were almost through with our meal, when we told Sheila we were celebrating our Anniversary that she perked up and said \\"oh I have something special for you then\\" and ran off to get us each a glass of sparkling wine. This was a very nice gesture which would have been the perfect thing to tide us over while we were waiting initially for our wine. Also the two top table where we were seated was really too small for the type of service. By the time we had an ice cooler for the wine, a bottle of water, glasses, appetizer and bread it was a bit precarious trying to negotiate eating and drinking. And the wine cooler created quite a big puddle of water on the table and the floor.

Moving on.  \\n\\nOur initial goal was to order those large scorpion bowls from Hong Kong, a move that has never failed in all my years as a grown adult male.  Unfortunately, in the most un-clutch twist of all time, Hong Kong had been closed down for the entire week.  Still determined to get some sort of a scorpion bowl type drink we happened upon Tiki Rock out of nowhere.\\n\\nFor the \\"low\\" price 60 bucks we ordered a painkiller for 4.  It was hilarious.  We received a bowl probably about half the size yet 4 times as heavy as your average scorpion bowl .  It was filled to the brim with ice and was barely half full of liquid.  When questioning the bartender on the drink portions he replied \\"the bowl is really heavy and if I filled it anymore it would tip over.\\"... Just to retrace.  The bowl would tip over if you fill it past half way... The bowl, a device that is as old as time, specifically designed by a team of scientists to contain liquids would tip over if you fill it passed halfway.  Fortunately, this led to many jokes throughout the rest of the night.  We quickly figured out we would have to \\"eat\\" this purchase and drank from a bowl that was so barren we were sipping up air bubbles from the initial slurp.  Anyways, the traces of liquid that was originally in the bowl quickly disappeared and all that was left was the bowl that weighed the same amount as when it was full.\\n\\nTo put this in perspective we had just come from the Wild Rover in which our tab was 9 beers, 2 burgers, and chicken fingers for $45.

As usual the pizza was out of site, tasted very fresh and came out quickly.  This was actually the only reasons I returned after the last visit.   Normally it can be a little cramped and parking is tuff when busy.  Today the place was almost empty so we had the opportunity to sit where we wanted and parking was a breeze.  \\n\\nI can only assume the staff that I spoke with has never had any customer service whatsoever as it was atrocious.  I can also assume none of them wanted to be there whatsoever.  I brought a friend with me and this was the first experience with the restaurant he had, not good. We walked directly to the counter as it wasn't busy, this seemed to bother the girl at the register since she had to stop playing on her phone.  Since my friend had never been here before he had questions about the menu which he got one word answers that could be heard.  We had to ask her to repeat yourself twice and still do not understand what she said. This was one of the worst ordering experiences I have had at a restaurant including late night McDonald's runs. Her posture, facial expression's and lack of acknowledgment to our order made it clear she would rather be anywhere else than there.  So we picked a couple of pizzas and drinks and sat down.   The pizza came out rather quickly as expected since it was slow.  We enjoyed our food but it became obvious we couldn't finish.  Another girl who stopped at the table to straighten up had pulled out her phone briefly.  I took the opportunity to politely asked if I could get a to go box, I was told \\"yea they are right there, you can grab it yourself\\".  I don't have a problem getting things for myself at all, but the way she spoke to me and the fact that she could have easily grabbed it so I didn't have to get up and circle around the table just blew me away.  She promptly returned to her phone and walked away.  \\n\\nI don't mind playing for good food but I'm not gonna pay for food regardless of the cost and get treated like that.  The fact that two people spent $55 on pizza and two drinks is crazy.

We were first seated on the patio in a very dim corner that smelled of trash and when we were brought to our seat it had not been cleaned I let the hostess know that I would not like to sit there and he said okay and stormed off. We followed him because he didn't give us any direction on what to do next. For a second I thought we weren't going to be seated at all because I walked to the front and he looked at us but continued to work. No communication. Finally I informed the other host and we were sat right away. That was the first error in customer service.\\n\\nSecondly, we were sat on the patio again which is cool, however it began to sprinkle. I asked my waiter (Jimmy)  if there was a plan if it started to really rain and he said he didn't think so. Because It was sprinkling and I wanted to be proactive and also remain cute because we had plans afterwards. I asked to move to something under the tented areas and we were accommodated however I felt like I did a bad thing by asking to be moved. No one was apologetic or understanding it was more of a \\"how dare you\\" feel.\\n\\nLastly, my Tapas were ordered at 8:28, I ordered 5, I received my first one (Spinach and Chickpea) at 9:04. During this entire time my server (Jimmy) did not check in. We had to continue to wave him down over and ask him questions about our food order that he clearly wasn't aware of. It's possible he could be new. After he was notified he let me know that our order was thrown off bc we moved seats. Well we literally moved to the seat right next to us, so to me that was a poor excuse and fail on execution. Things happen, prepare for it. He was just not very in tune with what the orders were, which is sad because usually I have an incredible experience with attentive friendly service. Our Tapas arrived one by one and he told us that he would \\"give us a hanger steak on the house\\". We weren't expecting anything on the house, we just wanted better service and attention. The entire experience could have been saved, but there wasn't any thought behind it. I think the Manager delivered us a few tapas herself, but she also didn't say much. \\n\\nI would suggest staging more staff on a Saturday because clearly Jimmy was overwhelmed and the hostess was too. It would also be helpful to ask if there is an outside or inside preference when taking reservations or seating. I say this because the lighting in certain areas on the patio are very dark and for someone like me, it made it hard to eat. I literally used the flashlight on my phone, the family of 3 sitting behind us did too, but eventually they left due to the darkness and odd smell outside. \\n\\nOverall, the food is really good when it warm but the service let me down completely."},{"name":"Keke's Breakfast Cafe","address":"282 Moore Rd","city":"Ocoee","stars":"3.5","text":"Enjoyed a farewell breakfast with my daughter.

The Inman Park area is perfect for something like this because you can park and walk to several different restaurants. Barcelona was our appetizer location, which was perfect because of our previous plan.  The service is great.  From the host to the server to management, everyone was really attentive and offered helpful menu suggestions. Our server, Ashley, even went above and beyond the call of duty to highlight what I could eat and that meant a lot to me.  She & Rueben really made our experience that much better.  With me being non-meat eater I was happy that they had small plates that cater to the Vegetarian/Vegan/Gluten Free diner.\\n\\nI ordered 3 small plates:  Grilled Watermelon, Blistered Okra, and a Cucumber dish (that I cannot seem to remember the official name of).  The Grilled Watermelon was by far my favorite dish of the evening.  I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor and even the texture of the dish.  The watermelon wasn't too hot or mushy but was sweet and the Feta just gave that extra flavor to make it savory.  The Okra was good, as well, but I just don't like Okra.  As much as I try to give it a chance the sliminess just makes me queezy.  But your initial bite is delicious but like I said the inside of the Okra just doesn't do it for me.  The Cucumber dish was my least favorite because I was expecting more flavor.  It was just some diced cucumbers mixed in a sauce that had no taste to it. An addition of some vinegar, salt, and pepper would really enhance this dish even more.  \\n\\nSo, instead of trying a third location for dessert we decided to come back to Barcelona because their desserts looked so delicious.  They are plated to be really appealing but we were disappointed because the Crepe dish was bland and so were the cookies.  We were expecting a sweeter flavor but they were just way too bland for our liking.  The presentation was the best part of the desserts.  \\n\\nI still recommend this restaurant because of it's atmosphere, service, and extensive drink menu.

Did the folks working there greet people by name and warmly exchange local chit chat with them?  yes.\\n\\nSo, why three stars?\\n\\nWell, to start with...we were given a basket of chips and salsa.  The salsa was delicious but the chips were a bit on the stale side.  Plus, they were those odd completely round chips that were reminiscent of the cheap-o industrial sized bags of them your parents would buy you when they came to visit you at college.  Very odd, totally not made to order or even made on site.\\n\\nI ordered this fun sounding salad that had rice and veggies on it.  I asked them to add in beans which they were more than happy to do.  When the salad came out, I immediately noticed that the baby carrots were starting to get that white-ish outer layer that they get when they are in the bag for too long and are starting to dry out.  Plus, all of the veggies tasted like they had just come out of a bag or a can, nothing tasted all that fresh.  And although the rice was good, I had my doubts that it was freshly made and the beans were totally fresh out of a can.\\n\\nMy husband liked what he got which i believe was a chicken quesadilla and was happy that he was given a selection of three different types of hot sauce to choose from after asking for some.  \\n\\nAfter we finished eating I went to the washroom which is just past the kitchen.  Well, while I was waiting for the washroom to be free I noticed a giant Costco sized bag of Uncle Bens rice in the kitchen and the chef was in the process of opening a big jar of olives and spooning them directly into a bowl w/o washing them or adding anything to them.  So, I got the impression that most of the food at Adobe Rose is not really all that freshly prepared.

The upstairs has a better atmosphere then the downstairs but overall it's a nice place to grab a quick bite. It's also a huge plus that they serve breakfast all day everyday. The major downfall is the service. I have never had good service here. The staff always seems like they're in a bad mood. The servers do the bare minimum and as a server myself it's really frustrating. They'll basically take your order and then you'll never see them again. I thought it was just a fluke the first time I was there but after many visits back it almost seems like bad service is a requirement to work there.

Food in Portland is great (as well as the typical LA/SF/SD/NYC/Boston/etc.). With regards to sushi, you don't normally get fresh sushi in the Midwest, unless you pay top dollar. Even then, the sushi isn't even guaranteed to be good. And I'll admit that I'm a bit more of a traditionalist when it comes to sushi. I like my sake, toro, ikura, uni. They're all fish. Serve it on sushi rice with a dab of wasabi between the fish and rice, and I'm happy. Simple rolls; no frills. None of that blasphemous asparagus or cream cheese business.\\n\\nI'll also have to preface that this review is written in retrospect after a few months eating here, so take it with a grain of salt and what you will.\\n\\nI'll admit, though. I was worried when I first stepped in. With the Midwest, you can confirm that an Asian restaurant is good if you see some Asians eating there. Here, I was the only Asian I could see in the whole restaurant, including servers and sushi chefs. Call me racist, but I will be glad to say this early in the review that my worry was completely unfounded, well, at least after the appetizer portion of the meal.\\n\\nI sat at the sushi bar, since I was just there by my lonesome, and there wasn't much seating space at the tables. There are multiple sushi chefs at the bar that serve their own quadrants.\\n\\nFor the appetizer, the okonomiyaki wasn't too impressive. Don't remember much to consider worth writing about. Really. It's that unimpressive.\\n\\nIt made me question my decision to eat here, but then things got really good. \\n\\nInitially, I was tempted to go straight to the rolls, but then I saw a whole bunch of fish that were caught fresh or come from abroad, and decided to go with the Omakase. For those who live back home in the Midwest, this is the true test of any sushi place, or at least the sushi chef. This means that going Omakase can also be a huge gamble with what you get, especially if it's a not-so-good sushi place. My chef, though he was there for about five years, if I recall, doesn't really qualify for an itamae label. I was expecting the more traditional sushi+rice which was what I had pretty much experienced exclusively before. I have to say, my sushi chef destroyed the boundaries of what I expected from sushi coming from the traditional view, and really expanded my horizons of what sushi can be. Thinking of what he did months later, it was certainly for the better, even though I didn't think it was the case at that time. The details are lost now that I type about it months later, but in addition to the fish+rice formula, there were oils, spices, salt, pepper, different fish eggs that added different flavors, textures to the sushi. In all, the bold flavors came for 5 or so dishes of about 3 different sushi masterpieces for each dish, and ended with a grand finale of traditional sushi and tempura. Ingredients for the Omakase was very fresh all around. The Omakase came out to about $45 at the end, and was well worth the price. The chef asked what price range I was going for before starting, which was $40-$50. Incredibly reasonably priced, coming from the Midwest, especially for the quality.\\n\\nThe amount of sushi for that amount was just right, and it was some of the best (if not the best) sushi I've had, and it was easily the best sushi experience that I've ever had, thanks to going the Omakase route (the legitimate Japanese restaurants here in Cincinnati don't really stray far from the traditional sushi, though some of the less common fish does make their way here). Sadly, I'm coming in with a very low bar to clear, coming from the Midwest, but the experience here will heavily influence how I will rate sushi from here on out. Funny thing is that this was the first time I ordered Omakase, and I was rewarded very well for it. As the result, I'm not afraid to order it at a new place, wherever I end up. This alone earns the 5-star review despite the lackluster appetizer I ordered. Can't say enough as to how awesome the sushi is here.\\n\\nI really envy the Portlanders and their food scene in PDX. Also, their public transportation.\\n\\nTL:DR: I'm a Asian midwesterner (I know, sad) that ended up in Portland for some sushi, and got my mind blown away with the Omakase. That is a good thing."},{"name":"King Bao","address":"710 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"I will come back just for the OH MY GROUPER. \\n\\nFave. \\n\\nTo be fair, I can't eat a lot of what's on the menu due to allergies so I can't soundly review everything but that fish bao is amazing! \\n\\nOh, and truffle tots.

Especially since they have an awesome selection of shakes that are available at half-price during their Happy Hour (2a-5a and 2p-5p).  My boys loved it.  So much so that whenever they got to choose their restaurant for birthday celebration, Steak 'n Shake came in the same breath as Hometown Buffet (every kid loves that place, but since they're all gone...).\\n\\nBefore I knew it, we were saving those mailer coupons and letting the boys decide what to order for our weekend 1-on-1 lunches with each son.

They have Classic Shakes (Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry, Banana, Orange Freeze, etc.), Specialty Shakes (Fruit Loops, Frosted Flakes, Oreos Cookies and Cream, Peanut Butter Cup, Birthday Cake, etc.) and, my kids' favorites, Side-By-Side Shakes (two flavors, taking up different sides of the glass/container.\\n\\nThe burgers are delicious and of wide-variety.  My two favorites are the Patty Melt, and the Triple Steakburger with Cheese.  I'm also a big fan of their Chili Cheese Footlong.

What a beautiful sight to see. Who wouldn't want to spend their afternoon lazying around, drinking coffee and enjoying some of nature's finest views? I completely understand the appeal of any place where you can kick back and love the city for what its assets are, and so therefor I really wish Mozart's was a place like that.\\n\\nThe way I see it, Mozart's suffers from 3 major problems: a) parking, b) Westlake, and c) their employees. Case in point: I was sitting out on the patio one day and some toolbag next to me literally LIT A CIGAR and started smoking it like he freakin owned the place. I politely asked him to stop, or at least blow the smoke away from me, and he scuffed, \\"It's a free country, I can smoke where I please\\" and prompty blew smoke right in my face. I told him that was uncalled for, and he just laughed. So, I up and went inside and told Mozart's management about it.\\n\\nYou know what they did? They asked me to leave. That's right, despite the smoking ban, despite their no-smoking policy, despite the presence of innocent children who did not ask for their lungs to be blackened by second-hand smoke and their world to be dampened by inconsiderate asses, they somehow decided I was the one to blame. \\nWhen I asked the manager why, he said, \\"I don't appreciate your tone, and you were rude to another customer. Please leave.\\"\\n\\nLet's say you were attacked by a psycho maniac who tried to kill you, and in the process of him holding a gun to your head, you had said, \\"Fuck you, psycho maniac!\\" Then during the trial, the jury rules he's not guilty on the basis of, \\"The victim was rude and we don't appreciate her tone.\\" HELLO, murder is against the law, and so is smoking, whereas RUDENESS IS NOT. And I wasn't even rude either, I swear. \\n\\nSo I get why people would park on the moon to trek down to Mozart's and appreciate a latte and a lakeside view, but I don't like anyone who tampers with my right to breathe."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I've only made it to the bar, but this place has a great vibe.

They whip you through the line lightning-fast; it actually takes them longer to pull your drink out of the cooler than to make your lunch, although only by fractions of a second.  Even so, there's still enough time for them to hand everyone in line a free sample falafel ball. I keep meaning to try other things off their menu, but every time I bite into one of those babies, I know I can't leave there without a wrap full of them. (No hummus, please. Their hummus is tasty but SUPER rich, and unnecessary on a wrap since their falafel is so fresh and moist.)\\n\\nTip: ask them to slice your falafel wrap in half. Their wraps are huge, and easily comprise two meals (at least for me), but they're also so delicious that they're REALLY hard to stop eating once you start. So unless you want to stuff yourself silly, it's good to have a recommended stopping point halfway through your lunch.\\n\\nDon't blink or you'll miss the storefront that hides the dumpy little food court containing this gem. Make no mistake, it's not upmarket by any means. But I disagree with people who'd call it ghetto. For ghetto, please proceed onward down the block to the Corner food court by Filene's, where you can shop for grills after you buy your lunch (and I don't mean the kind you cook food on).

I know how, why and what makes pizza good, great or ordinary. I know the ovens, what makes the crust react the way it does, I know how the sauce lends its part to the equation and I know how and why different cheeses react the way they do for the mouth feel that it should have.  I have been to the mecca of pizza which is relatively unknown to most but none the less, it is New Haven, CT.  The home of Sally's Apizza, Don Peppe and Modern Pizza, better than any NY pie I have had though NY being excellent, never as good as the aforementioned parlors. \\n I spent my life studying pizza, ever since my first slice at the long gone Sal's Pizza on Bergenline Blvd in West New York, NJ.  \\nThere is, in my estimation, five categories of pizza which of the components have been mixed and matched at different places but only when you combine the right mix, do you achieve greatness.  It goes like this;\\nThere is coal oven pizza, which is one of the components of greatness and there is gas oven pizza.   Coal ovens cook at about 900 to 1000 degrees. Gas ovens at about 500 to 600.  You need a coal oven to produce greatness.  That said, coal ovens are outlawed in many municipalities and only exist if the pizza joint existed before it was banned.  \\nThere is mozzarella cheese and fresh mozzarella cheese.  Fresh is another ingredient necessary to achieve greatness.  \\nThere is imported tomatoes or tomatoes produced in Stanislaus County, CA, both of which are stellar quality. Then, there is the rest, which just does not measure up.\\nThere is the crust which must be ultra thin but still crispy and chewy, not an easy thing to do and takes time to perfect. And then there is the spices. The right mix of oregano, basil, salt and pepper which is all it takes \\nWith all that said, I had a pretty good pie tonight produced with regular mozzarella cheese and a crust that almost achieved greatness if not for its slightly excessive chewiness.\\nThe pie was thin, very thin, but held up without getting soggy.  It had the burnt flour on the bottom that is only produced in a really, really hot oven, the kind of burnt flour that sticks to your fingers and turns them black when you eat the pie.  Tomato sauce that was tangy but not too sweet and mozzarella that was good quality even if it was not fresh mozzarella, which is another component of greatness.  My compliments to The Upper Crust.\\nBest pizza in Boston?  Could be, but then again, I haven't been everywhere."},{"name":"Chambar","address":"568 Beatty Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Overall good, but does not live up to the hype due to poor service and somewhat underwhelming food quality given the price point. I would NOT call this high-end dining!\\n\\nFood and Service:\\n-------------------------\\nI tried the beet carpaccio, octopus appy, lamb tagine and the grilled angus beef. The octopus was pleasingly tender and ever-so-gently seared to create the perfect interplay between flavor and texture. The beets were overpowered by the raita and pistou swirled haphazardly across the plate: it felt like I was eating sauce and not beets.\\n\\nThe lamb main had an excellent flavor pairing with the eggplant and couscous it came with. The beef was overcooked: first they brought out a steak that was well-done, apologized (if you count \\"oh, uh..i brought you wrong one\\" as an apology) and replaced it with what should have been the medium-rare one I ordered. In the end what I had was an extremely dry, medium-well, luke-warm slab with very cold potatoes for a side. Had the server checked in at all during our meal, I would have complained. Mind you, had the server been around the entire table would have ordered at least another round of drinks - that is, if our drink orders weren't so completely wrong the last round. It's too bad, since they have a great range of Belgian brews on the menu and I would have loved to try a few more.\\n\\nAmbiance:\\n---------------\\nOn the other hand, I love the ambiance: the dim lighting and warm wood tones make for an excellent romantic dinner spot. It's cozy, yet classy. I also enjoy that they have a valet - big two thumbs up for a downtown restaurant. I can see those as valid reasons to like this place.\\n\\nBottom Line:\\n-----------------\\nGiven the large selection of restaurants in Vancouver with much better service and better food, your hard-earned dollars are best spent elsewhere."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Love this restaurant!

The short rib is HUGE and is a meal in and of itself, and melts in your mouth. Their potatas bravas are REALLY good as well, even though 1 of them felt like it just came out of the freezer. The spicey mayo and the way they cooked them was delicious.  Unfortunately I was dissappointed in their gambas al ajillo, a staple dish in any tapas place that should be done flawlessly. The gambas went cold quickly and did not have a lot of 'kick' to them. I usually like to devour the garlic on the bottom of the oil under the shrimp, but there was not a lot to be had. The garlic was also not burnt like usual, making me think they undercooked the whole dish (it certainly felt like it.)\\nThe pricing for the food is slightly more than that of Tasca, but equivalent to Dali and Tapeo.  Hot Tapas range from 8-14 dollars. \\n\\nIn short, Kika, if you clean up your Tapas act and deliver a consistent experience you could be an amazing tapas place.

You can walk to Powell's books, have a fantastic breakfast just up the street at tasty n alder, enjoy dinner at one of the many food trucks nearby and visit pioneer square. About a 1/4 mile away is Chinatown and voodoo donuts. \\n\\nThe rooms are definitely very cool looking! They each have a unique style. \\n\\nIf you don't want to leave the hotel you can enjoy the saltwater pool, have dinner at Zeus cafe and then get drinks and listen to live music at Al's den. \\n\\nThe bathrooms were amazingly clean! They are very good at keeping up with them. \\nAlso a plus that they had bathrobes :). \\n\\nThey also let us store our luggage after check-out until we could come back with our car to pick it up.\\n\\nThe not so good: the rooms are small. This bothered me the most. There is also a lack of shelf space to set things. The room can feel cramped and cluttered. \\n\\nNoise: several people complained about noise. It's definitely not quiet but it isn't that loud either. If you are a light sleeper do not stay here, actually don't stat anywhere downtown. You can hear the traffic and people outside but I don't think that's so bad. What bothered me more was the noise in the hallway. You can hear people very clearly and when someone is going into a room near yours it sounds like they are actually trying to come into your room. If you stay here on a weekend when the weather is good you may find it very loud.\\n\\nAC: it's in the worst spot possible and blows directly down upon you while you are in bed.   It's really poorly placed.\\n\\nParking: no parking onsite. I think they can tell you a few different places to park but it's probably expensive to park overnight. We decided to park at a park n ride at a Max station that allowed overnight (24 hour parking) for free and then take the Max back to our hotel. This was really convenient. We didn't have to deal with a car in a city that is not very car friendly. Last time we visited we got towed. Be careful there is predatory towing in portland and the city should be ashamed of that. Anyways do yourself a favor and find a park n ride that allows parking overnight. \\n\\nI think if you are prepared for all the good and bad that comes with this hotel you will have a good stay.

I've read up about Craigie and had been dying to try it for quite some time, so we decided on this night to dive in headfirst with the ten-course tasting menu.  Our server was very attentive and helpful throughout the meal, and it seems as if he spent quite a bit of time replacing the silverware for each course.  As most tasting menus are pretty much set in stone, I was surprised to be asked if there were any foods I didn't care for, or alternately, things I'd like to see.  \\n\\nMany of the early courses were lighter seafood dishes, including a trio of squid noodles, sardine and tuna terrine topped with caviar.  Yellowtail sashimi was garnished with, among other things, some of the freshest salmon roe I've ever tasted - the \\"pop\\" was miles ahead of most sushi bar salmon roe.  \\n\\nAround course five, a buckwheat pasta dish with uni and salty pork came out and represented a transition between the ligher seafood courses and the later meat-oriented dishes.  I wouldn't have felt right about it without more pork, and I was not disappointed with a beautifully prepared pork belly course. The meat and the preparation were top-notch, but some bites were a tad on the dry side... probably the only thing in the whole dinner that wasn't a slam-dunk.  A lamb course featured loin and lamb tongue, which I'll definitely be looking out for on future menus.  The lamb was brought out by Tony Maws himself - not sure if he does this for everyone, but even a brief visit from a chef as acclaimed (not to mention busy) as Tony was a really nice touch.\\n\\nSeveral dessert courses rounded out the evening, to which I added a glass of Blanton's bourbon.  I should mention the wine - the bottles aren't cheap and I was surprised, with the focus on local foods, to find that most of the wines were European.  Of course, I've got no problem at all with that, and we enjoyed two pricey but thoroughly enjoyable bottles with the meal.  \\n\\nThe 349 reviews that came along before this one can attest to this as well - Craigie is big-league.  A destination for foodies from down the street and across the country.  While the total bill had a rather eye-popping figure at the bottom, at $110 a person the ten-course tasting menu might even be a deal.

Impressions below.\\n\\nThe Decor - the tables have white paper over linen, half the place is a bar, and it is loud.  So as a guest paying $$$$, this is the presented scenario.  Is this novel and quirky, or simply insulting?  Both, I guess. \\n\\nThe Staff - The kitchen is all men, most of the waitstaff is women. Why - is this part of the Craigie on Main show, the image to be portrayed? Noticeable, and weird.  The kitchen facilitator (a man) is ebullient about announcing the incoming orders and the dishes to be prepared.  This was fun at first.  The waitress announced that the establishment provides 'free water' and I almost laughed... was I supposed to laugh?  There was a bit of obvious upsell when we ordered, embarrassing.\\n\\nThe Food - Everything is very good, sometimes stepping into greatness but not staying there.  Many items are on par with other quality establishments but the set and setting are off.  As such, the food must singlehandedly carry you through the din to nirvana and it just can't, it's not that good (is any food other than mom's pot roast up to that task? I doubt it.)  Lots of talk about how we are about to eat 'the best things we've ever had' and this seems to be a meme, they have this burger, etc.  We admired their confidence but rejected the premise out of hand and we were correct. This is awkward, seems a bit young.\\n\\nThe Bill - Well, too much, but I didn't particularly regret paying it.  The prix fixe menu seems to be a transparently clever way to sell a tasty chicken for $70.  \\n\\nOverall -  I think Craigie could be a 'resident trap'; if you have lived in Boston for any length of time you know about this place, and you may feel that you should eventually go here, and I guess you eventually should.  It took us 10 years and... we are glad we went.

As long as the food is good, I can overlook the service...But...the food wasn't very good.  My wife got chicken parm.  The actual chicken was cooked perfectly and was very tasty...but the ziti noodles that came with it were WAAAY over-cooked.  How does an \\"Italian\\" restaurant not cook its pasta al-dente?  The noodles were so overcooked that they just fell apart when trying to pick them up with the fork.  Very disappointing.\\n\\nI got a small pizza with pepperoni, green peppers and sausage.  It was ok...better than your average take-out place like dominos or papa johns, but no where near the quality of Reginas, etc.  In my opinion, the delivery pizza I've gotten from Bacci's was a better than pie than Carusos.\\n\\nTo wrap it up...everything was ok at best.

A good number of Yelpers rate Antico Forno among the best in the North End.  I'm not disputing this, but, based on our recent experience, that doesn't say much for the North End.  \\nGood first:  we were early on a fall Tuesday, and had the place to ourselves at first.  When we left a bit after 7, there was still plenty of open seating.  The waitress was very pleasant and we welcomed her willingness to chat us up about her 10 month old child and curing the hiccups.  A nice family touch. The place was comfortable and, seated by the window, we didn't feel at all crowded.  As far as the food goes, the green salad and cappuccino were great.  My pizza with artichokes, tomatoes, and porcini mushrooms had an outstanding wood oven crust, just like it should, but the toppings were only luke warm.  The ribbolata soup was perfectly tasty, but really was not much more than minestrone with a piece of bread floating in it.  \\nThe not so good:  My daughter's roast chicken, probably also done in the wood oven was over cooked and pretty dry as a result.  My wife's chicken parm was only so-so, nothing out of the ordinary, and for $22, we expected better.  I couldn't find a bottle of wine under $30 that looked good, ended up spending $38 for a Nebbiolo d'Alba which was nice, but a bit pricey IMHO.\\nSummary: Nothing wrong with the Antico Forno, but not a place I'd recommend with enthusiasm."},{"name":"Pizzeria La Sorrentina","address":"3000 SE 164th Ave, Ste 107","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"Is it possible this pizza is getting more delicious?

It was my first time here, my bf had only previously had a few beers here with friends before.\\n\\nI was initially excited to try Draft Pick. However, we were both extremely disappointed by a number of things.\\n\\nI ordered the Ribeye Steak and my bf had the Pulled Pork Nachos which he said were eh.. I happened to clear my plate before I cut into my steak. The asparagus and mashed potatoes were delicious but when I cut into my steak it was completely raw. \\n\\nIt came out completely red, not at all medium rare. For a restaurant establishment, I thought that maybe there might be use of a thermometer to monitor what medium rare is. I told our waitress that everything else was great but the steak was way under cooked. I expected her to be a little more empathetic but I was glad she agreed and took it back. We even ordered another appetizer in the mean time (bruschetta, it was not great).\\n\\nThe second steak was at least cooked when it came back. She cut into the second steak before she brought it back though, and I could tell it was thrown back onto the grill after she must of cut into it because it was cooked more on one side than another. Still was not medium rare. \\n\\nAfter eating the rest of our dinner, we were ready for another round of drinks and a second appetizer even after all that. Our server never came back for over 30 minutes, not to ask us if we needed another round or even our bill. \\n\\nWe kept seeing her frantically going back and forth to one table. Another couple who sat down after us, left before us. At that point, we were ready to go if we weren't going to be waited on. When she finally came by my boyfriend just handed her our card to take care of the bill. When she came back, all she brought was an itemized bill. Not merchant copy or customer copy.

Went there with someone else the other night and had a flawless meal. Lovely service, nice and warm decor (GREAT date spot), and awesome food. Absolutely nothing disappointed me in the slightest. \\n\\nThe only issue I had with this restaurant was how difficult it was to choose our food. Everything looked so good! I combed through some other reviews and spotted some objections to the exotic nature of essentially everything on the menu. \\"Pigs tails, chicken feet, boudin noir, smelts, tongue, sea urchin, fish with collar bones, bone marrow, pork jowl, squid\\" were all referenced below as \\"showoffy,\\" and I guess if you're not into trying some new things, this isn't your place. But I certainly wouldn't say that the menu choices were based on pomposity. \\n\\nI had the smelts, the bone marrow, and the boudin noir, and they were all fantastic. The boudin noir, especially, was absolutely central to the rich, warm, smokey flavors of the dish (a farro risotto that was out of this world). The smelt were delicious (They're great fish. Why should the chef avoid them?), lightly battered and fried with a delicious, thick, and tangy squid-ink aioli and crunchy, vanilla-scented heart of palm. Other exoticisms were equally well chosen. The chef isn't trying to show off so much as he's trying not to let conventions get in the way of what's in his head. \\n\\nI guess part of this issue is what a Boston resident might be expecting from a French restaurant, especially one that, up until a few months ago, called itself a \\"bistro,\\" a word that conjures for most people images of moules manieres and steak frites. In a food-capital like New York, the menu wouldn't stand out particularly much as exotic. That the chef is so willing to experiment -- or, to word it more accurately, so knowledgeable as to feel comfortable making smart culinary decisions like enriching his risotto with boudin noir -- is really what makes this restaurant so great. \\n\\nThis place is really trying (and succeeding) to be a cut above.\\nI really think the food makes this one of the very best restaurants in the city. This place could definitely hold its own in San Francisco or New York, which could NOT be said about most Boston or Cambridge restaurants.

The steak part didn't hinder my review score much because I don't mind a somewhat rare steak, though I would have liked our \\"medium 40 oz. porterhouse for two\\" to actually turn out as a perfect medium. I did like that it arrived on a sizzling hot plate (too bad it wasn't hot enough to cook the steak a bit more). I also liked the sweet potato casserole side dish, the wine list and the restaurant's entire setting. There's an upscale, candle-lit, private-den look to this place, located in the Old City Hall.\\n\\nThe bread is another story. I compare everyone's bread to Morton's nice, warm loaf. No other steak house has held a candle to it. Ruth's Chris was actually up there until we asked for a second helping (we were starving and it was 10:30 already). The waiter brought out what he said was \\"more bread than we can handle.\\" First, there's really no such thing as \\"more bread than we can handle.\\" We're a force to be reckoned with when it comes to bread and he shouldn't assume, even if he was just trying to be witty. (Like I said, we were starving. I was not a fan of the waiter.) Second, the bread was frozen in the middle. Maybe he rushed it out for us -- when we had to ask for the bread a second time -- but that's still no excuse for frozen bread at a high-end steak house.\\n\\nOne thing I learned from this dining experience was to heed warnings overheard in men's rooms.

After I ordered, she said okay and I brushed her non-attentive, passive attitude aside, waited for my food and ate. The food was tasty as always, but throughout the 45 minutes I spent sitting after I ordered, my waitress didn't come to check in or refill me coffee (which is bottomless when you order food). And when she did come back to the table, she said \\"Here's your check, whenever you're ready\\", left the receipt on the table and walked away. \\n\\nAs someone who works with customers every single day, and frequently visits this shop, I was not impressed in the slightest.

Everything else I've had- Ma Pa Tofu,  Mala Crispy chicken and Sa Cha Beef were way too hot for me- even though they were given a rating of one out of five peppers on the menu's spice chart and despite the fact that I grew up in Texas and love spicy mexican food.

They are probably the only reason I have kept ordering from here- that and their eggrolls and udon noodles.

First driver called me from his car at the end of the sidewalk insisting I come out and get the food out of his car instead of coming to the front door. Second driver tried to get me to pay him even though I'd paid on Foodler.

A group of us decided to attend this place last night after seeing a 'Fabulous Thursdays\\" promotional flyer. We walked in and the place was completely empty, minus a small party downstairs, one upstairs, and 2 or 3 people at the bar. We thought, \\"Perfect, we'll get seated immediately!\\" This thought was far from accurate. The entire front staff immediate made us, feel extremely uncomfortable. The looks of disgust were very obvious. We all turned a blind eye and a few of us proceeded to walk to the bathroom, thinking we will be seated shortly after. Once again, that was not the case. After coming back to the front. I noticed talks amongst the staff and they proceeded to stare at us like we did not belong there. After waiting an additional 5 mins, we were told that we were not going to get seated due to how we were dressed. When asked questions, the manager only continued to repeat that they would not be seating us. His patrionizing demeanor made me cringe!  We all dressed casual since the advertisement did not give us an impression that we needed to dress any different. Other customers also wore casual attire, therefore we did not feel out of place and or that we were in the wrong. We then all started to peacefully walk away and an employee then said in a very condesending tone, \\"Well for NEXT time, make sure to read the flyer correctly so that you can avoid this the NEXT time you all come\\". We received zero apologies! This by far has been the WORST experience that I've EVER encountered, since moving to Atlanta in 2009! For an establishment that seems to be \\"upscale\\", their service by far does NOT meet those expectations. I'm extremely careful when saying this, because people use this very loosely. However, there is no logical way to explain why my party of 8, all minorities, was never seated because of our casual attire, but people with fair skin and similar attire were! As we were walking to our cars, we ran into a party just like us and we made sure to forewarn them. We refuse to allow anyone to go through a similar experience, due to their skin color!

I have been to many of the better/finer italian dining restaurants in Atlanta (ok, not yet to Sotto or 246), and I have to say this meal was the best.\\n\\nWe started, as we usually do, with a look at the wine list, before ordering any food, or even listening to the specials.  The wine list was extensive, both by the bottle (at reasonable prices) and also by the glass.  It was actually amazing that they would have so many offerings of so many different varietals by the glass.  And, many of them were special riserva.  All the wines by the glass are chilled (not unreasonably so for the reds), and special precautions are taken to protect the life of the wines by use of the Enomatic Wine System, from Tuscany.\\n\\nSince the selection of wines by the glass was so large, we decided to order by the glass throughout the evening.  And the waitstaff was exceedingly accommodating to allow each of us to taste two wines per course, to enable us to make an informed selection.\\n\\nMy wife started with a Tuscan Vermentino, while I enjoyed a Righetti Amarone ($9 & $14 respectively). Our first food course was the grilled octopus, which we shared.  The grilled octopus was without a question, the best we've had anywhere!!!  I echo Rich V. & Stephen W. for their earlier comments (see their reviews below).\\n\\nOne aspect of the menu offerings is quite unique.  And that is most of the appetizers and main plates (secondi piatti/entrees) are offered as \\"small bites\\" plates, which are essentially smaller sized portions.  This enables the diner to sample more dishes, without getting stuffed.  My wife and I took full advantage of this.\\n\\nNext course was a lobster bowtie pasta appetizer, $20, and their famous gnocchi $13.  Both were fantastico.  You could actually taste the sea in the lobster pasta.  And the gnocchi was light and almost melted in my mouth.\\n\\nFor our mains we ordered the Branzino (sea bass) and the rack of lamb (small bites, @ $22 & $20 respectively).  Again, both were excellent.  The lamb chops were flavored with salt & olive oil just as I remember them from Florence.  Delizioso!!\\n\\nOur finale was an order of one of the many dolci that aroused our interest...a dense chocolate torte/cake, almost like a brownie, but flaky, with a scoop of their gelato.  Again, most enjoyable with the last of my red wine.\\n\\nOn a Sunday night, the restaurant had a light crowd, mostly aged 40's-60's....so much the better for us.  We received careful, attentive, yet unobtrusive service throughout the many courses and wines sampled. As Carrie Neal W. says, \\"...that perfect satisfaction that comes from a good meal, had in a pleasant environment.\\" I couldn't agree more.\\n\\nThis is our new favorite Italian restaurant, and in our own backyard!"},{"name":"Maria's Pastry Shop","address":"46 Cross St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"This is maybe the only authentic Italian bakery in the North End.

I used to swing in after work to grab a medium smoky bowl a few tines a week. Most of the bowls are pretty similar - rice, beans, cheese, olives, sour cream, the special topping for the particular bowl, and if course the yumm sauce. Very similar to Whole Bowl but with more variety. \\n\\nI think they're pretty good and have lots of fresh ingredients. It's easy to convince yourself they're healthy when in reality they aren't that great for you. Even cutting the sour cream and cheese out leaves you with a heavy sauce (though vegan) and a huge sodium content. \\n\\nI've gotten burnt out on their bowls over the past few years but I'd recommend you give it a try if you're looking for a quick bite.

Every single cocktail we ordered was so different from the norm but delightfully tasty. My favourite was the blue fig. It was an oven roasted fig infused gin (soooo good) with a side of blue cheese. Now I'm a big fan of blue cheese and they gave a very generous side of it, and taking a bite of this then drinking the cocktail was a match made in heaven. Some people find it weird but I can just eat blue cheese by itself and not get sick of it. Fantastic drink. Our over favourites of the table were the Pineapple Express and master of my domain. \\n\\nFor the food we had the order the mussels. We got a pot of the vin blanc and the congolaise mussels for 4 people and it more than filled us up. I could barely walk after! The portion size is always ridiculously large so although the price point seems high at $27 a pot, it can easily feed 2 people. The fries were perfect as usual and goes so well with the garlic aioli, in my opinion one of the best aiolis I've had. \\n\\nOur server Michael was awesome and wasn't overbearing but was attentive and came over right away once he saw us glance his way to take another drink order. We were too full to order dessert but got some digestif's to end the meal. He came by with a plate of custom desserts on the house for us for our friends anniversary.

Conclusion? People are dumb, dumb, dumb. And why do I say this? Well, you see a lot of people complaining about the cost. It's a theme park. You've made the decision to take all 5 of your kids here, and no that's not going to be cheap. I purchased a season pass because I live in Georgia and can come down from time to time, and I've already been there for a total of 5 days, effectively paying for the pass. I didn't buy an express pass, and the first time I came here, we were able to see every ride we wanted without that additional cost, too. I ended up renting a hotel with anywhere between 5-7 people, which further cuts the corners of costs. Another complaint is the food in the park. DON'T BUY IT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO! That is actually an option. The entire amount of money I've spent IN the park for 5 days is about $50, and that's including the purchase or two chocolate frogs at $10 a pop. I ate in the park twice, which was about $25. Most restaurants will have you paying $10-12 per meal, so I'd say that's pretty average... As for parking costs, if you're staying at a hotel, most hotels in the area have some sort of shuttle bus. If not, there's Uber. (It's a thing. Look it up.) Your hotel charges parking fees? Well then, that sucks, and you should have figured that cost into the initial purchase of the hotel. Why complain about spending so much money on vacation, and letting that ruin the whole experience? Just don't take your kids to a theme park if it's such a huge issue. They won't remember it, and they can pay for it themselves when they're adults. And besides, I'm sure hearing you complain about the cost of everything is going to imprint psychologically on them that they aren't worth the money you spent.\\n\\nThat being said, I'd give each of the individual parks 4 stars each. I have a bunch of fun there, but there's room for improvement. Collectively, however, I think this park very much deserves 5 stars. The two parks each have awesome rides, and there are some rides that I genuinely love going to. And that's even after having ridden them half a dozen times. \\n\\nMy favorites at Universal Studios:\\nDiagon Alley\\nRevenge of the Mummy\\nMen in Black: Alien Attack\\n\\nMy favorites at Islands of Adventures:\\nWizarding World - Hogsmeade\\nPopeye & Bluto's Bilge Rat Barges\\nJurassic Park River Adventure / Jurassic Park Discovery Center\\n\\nI'm absolutely obsessed with Harry Potter, so being in Diagon Alley for the first time actually brought tears to my eyes. And each consecutive time back, I'm grinning like a complete moron at the entire landscape as my friends talk and try to figure out what we're doing next. Diagon Alley is probably one of the most amazing places I have ever been to. It's one of my Seven Personal World Wonders, no questions.\\n\\nThere's something to be said about never going to theme parks as a kid. I turned out fine without that experience (never went to Disney or Universal), and as an adult with disposable income, I've now been to both parks. I enjoyed Universal more than Disney, because it seemed like Disney was dirtier and full of more children. Plus, Universal has Diagon Alley... I've also enjoyed the experience of being around my friends far more than I would ever have enjoyed being around my family. We're able to chill out at our hotel and drink, we're able to eat whatever we want, we're able to ride roller coasters and make sexual jokes, and just, in general, have an awesome and memorable time. I 100% don't regret purchasing a year pass. Every step of the way has been an awesome experience with some of my favorite people in this world."},{"name":"King Bao","address":"710 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"The location of this place used to belong to Rhapsodic Bakery. Unfortunately, the bakery had to close for reasons that I have yet to know, and King Bao replaced it. Despite the closing of one of my favorite bakeries in Orlando, King Bao is definitely worth checking out. \\n\\nAs far as Asian fusion goes, this place adds a great new twist to bao cuisine. Typically, I see baos served with duck or pork. In this joint, I see a new array of ideas that mend well with steam buns (bao). I ordered the Kickin Chicken, Glen Rhee, Truffle Tots, and (the dessert) Tarzan (which is a fried bao with banana slices and Nutella in between and dusted with powdered sugar). All were well executed and well presented.\\n\\nIn addition to what I ordered, I saw that they also offer many seafood options (such as crab cakes and fried shrimp), as well as a second dessert option (which involves a fried bao with ice cream...)\\n\\nAs far as service, I felt welcomed. I told the cashier that it was my first time at King Bao, and he offered me recommendations.\\n\\nI would certain recommend this place for a quick and tasteful bite, as the service here is fast. I definitely look forward to returning to King Bao."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Love this place.

Domino's was really good back in the 80s I thought. I mean maybe it wasn't and my memory is playing tricks on me. But at least it has a soft place in my heart since that was the first pizza company ever to deliver to us. After that, I felt the quality dropped and Papa Johns has worn the crown of chain pizzas since the 90s. \\n\\nFirst visit last week was incredible. The crust was dripping in garlic butter. The sauce was amazing. I ordered extra sauce and did they ever slather on the extra! I said to myself then and there that Domino's had regained the crown of chain delivery pizza. This was on a Saturday afternoon when i was the only customer in the store. \\n\\nLast night I went again and of course they were super busy with it being a Friday night, although it didn't affect the time my order was ready. They have that down to a science. I just wonder if perhaps a little less care was put into it. It tasted no different from the OLD Domino's. I neglected to order extra sauce since so much was on last week's order. This time little sauce was on the pizza. And the new flavored crust was not dripping with garlic buttery goodness.\\n\\nSo the first visit would garner a 4 star. The most recent gets a 3 star. I'll try it once more at a non-peak pizza ordering time and write an update. \\n\\nThe new pizza is a good product when you can get it!"},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"If you're looking for food, drinks and an entertaining atmosphere- this is the place! I have been frequenting this establishment for over 5 years and love it every time! Irish food, Irish drinks and Irish dancing! Once you're sat at one of the tables surrounded by the \\"pub\\" style decor you will start with this amazing soda bread and oil and Guinness reduction. YUM. Appetizers-The rack of heaven is a MUST- this can easily be a meal for 2 people or shared among more. Delicious, fall off the bone ribs covered in a caramelized Guinness reduction sauce.  We get it EVERY single time with our fail. (They used to be served short rib style which I was obsessed with- but now served as a huge slab) The pot pie, stew and the risotto are all awesome. The Parmesan truffle \\"chips\\" - yes, do it! Great for sharing as well! Honestly it's all amazing and well worth the visit! I HIGHLY suggest reservations- you'll still wait but only 5-20 minutes rather than 1-2 hours! Great experience for the family, friends or an awesome date night."},{"name":"Mozart's Bakery & Piano Cafe","address":"2885 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Such a cute little place. All the desserts looked good, although a tad expensive. I had a cream cheese danish. It was pretty flaky...so a tad messy eating it with the fork they provided. Kind of hard to eat danishes with forks... I liked that every bit of it was really sugary. The cream cheese center was surprisingly sweet, and I ate up the parts of the danish that came off from the flakiness...and that was still sweet by itself. I'd probably go again if it wasn't so expensive."}]`),N={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(n=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return n.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},j=["disabled"],D={key:0},H={key:1};function L(n,e,s,f,i,r){const c=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",R,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",E,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",D,"See more"))],8,j)):w("",!0)])}const F=u(N,[["render",L],["__scopeId","data-v-74434293"]]),Y=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/63.md","filePath":"library/63.md"}'),q={name:"library/63.md"},V=Object.assign(q,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(F)]))}});export{Y as __pageData,V as default};
