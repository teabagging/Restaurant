We drove across town to the South End and finally found parking, but since the Butcher Shop doesn't take reservations, we had to put our names on a list (even though we arrived fairly early in anticipation of a possible wait),  There was no space at the bar, so we walked across the street to B&G Oysters (another Barbara Lynch restaurant) for a glass of wine.  There was no seating here either, since all bar seating is used for ordering full meals.  Given that we came to the Butcher Shop for dinner (and therefore will probably be spending $$$$), why is it so difficult to order a glass of wine at not one, but two Barbara Lynch restaurants, while we endure the hour wait?We finally were seated, but of course, after an hour wait, can't sit at an actual table.  No, we have to eat at the bar.  For a birthday dinner.  Even though there were open tables (which apparently must be allotted for parties of four, not two) and even though the restaurant allots a significant chunk of space to its \\"performance art\\" butcher shop table where some guy methodically packages meat to prove that yes, we are at a butcher shop, in case anyone forgot.Enormous wine selection, but it was categorized oddly.  However, the waiter was very helpful at making sure we enjoyed the wine we ordered.The actual menu was disappointing.  The seared fig salad was unimpressive.  My boyfriend ordered the Del Monico steak.  Obviously, at $50 to $60 this came with no sides, so we had to spend $8 for a single ear of corn and $8 for some fingerling potatoes.  The steak was fine, but for the price we were expecting something stellar.  Also, it came essentially raw.  We would have sent the steak back, but it was so dimly lit that it took a couple bites to fully realize just how undercooked it was and by then it was too late to send back.  I will eat almost anything as rare as possible, but this was really, really rare.  Like, I think it was softly mooing.  I've had some great steak in my life, and this was fine but we expected better.   I mean, even I can make a better seared steak.   We also ordered a ravioli dish (something like a meat ravioli in mushroom sauce), and of course, it came with 3 microscopic ravioli.  For someone like myself who has spent years in Italy, it's a bit offensive to spend over $20 on a bowl of 3 ravioli, some mushrooms, and cream.After dropping some serious $$$$, we easily could have eaten more.  Is this a concept restaurant where Barbara Lynch tries to make dinner as difficult to enjoy as possible, and then sees how many hoops people will jump through for their meal?Sticking with Eastern Standard and my other standbyes."},{"name":"Winsor Dim Sum Caf√©","address":"10 Tyler St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I could easily go in and eat their Pork Buns all night long.

This is a quintessential Portland spot to visit and I understand what all the hype is about. I tried Salt & Straw for the first time in Los Angeles during a work trip (oh the irony...) and got a split scoop of their almond brittle with salted ganache and their sea salt with caramel ribbons, both of which were to die for. Tonight, I got a split scoop of their seasonal carrot cake batter with pralined hazelnuts and their caramel corn on the cob. The carrot cake flavor was wonderful. It was filled with sweet, fresh bits of carrots, and had a rich cream cheese flavor in the mini bites of cake mixed throughout. I also enjoyed all of the different textures of the cake bites, ice cream, and hazelnuts. The caramel corn flavor was equally delicious. You could really taste the sweet corn flavor of the ice cream and was well complemented by the caramel drizzle and hints of salted brown butter throughout. So creamy, so rich, and so tasty! Service here is also top notch. All of the workers were super friendly and looked genuinely happy. It's seriously smiles all around in here, which is both refreshing and impressive, given that the lines here are always a bit intense. On that note, I came here around 7 pm on a Friday night and the line wasn't bad at all. It wasn't out the door, which is what I normally see while walking around Alberta. The line also moved really quickly, as it only took me around 10-15 minutes to get my ice cream. All in all, my first Portland trip to Salt & Straw was wonderful! I will be back again next month to try the new seasonal flavors. PS: You can get a split scoop for 50 cents more.

And yuppp It was on the other side of the building, through the parking garage.We walked to the front and inside looked packed, I was a little worried because we didn't have reservations. Lucky for us they let us sit at the last two person table which was right in front next to the hostesses stand.We started off with shots. We asked for Henny but they didn't have it. The bartender came by to tell us personally, we asked if there was remy or even blue label... Nope and nope.. She went back to check what she had and I was thinking she was going to come back with more suggestions but instead she poured us two mysterious shots.....I can't even tell you what kind it was. I didn't like it but  I wasn't mad about it. Things we ordered, Steak frites- really delicious, great flavor. The fries were crispy and I loved the ranch dressing with it. The spinach in a vinaigrette was different. Lots of salt on it. It was good but I knew after eating here tonight I will need lots of water in my system.Toasted bread- toasted soft bread with a roasted garlic that is spreadable and a cheese spread. I'm not exactly sure what kind it was but this would be a great starter.Seared scallops- this was my least favorite one, my bf said his scallop tasted chemically and I said my scallop tasted like it was straight from the ocean.Brussels sprouts- in a sweet soy, oh my goodness, soooo tasty. I ate all of it!Duck confit- the duck was great, super tasty, skin was a little crispy, it couldve been  crispier. The cabbage salad it sat in was tossed in some kind of wasabi sauce. I hate the taste of wasabi.Fish tacos- the fish is breaded heavily which gives it that Big Crunch, but also makes it dry.

They offer well made, make your mouth water, home style sides like macaroni & cheese, collards, okra, and southern green beans.  This is NOT the place to eat if you want your veggies steamed and crunchy.  But if like me you were raised on grandma's home cooking - or you only wish you had a grandma who knew her way around a side of bacon - then you will think you have died and gone to heaven.  Many of the 4R locations also include a Sweet Shop, so if you haven't filled up on brisket and collards, you can top off your meal with a selection of sugary treats.  My personal favorite are the 7 layer bars, just like Grandma used to make, except she called them Hello Dolly Cookies.  Over the years I have also worked multiple times with 4Rivers catering. The folks who take care of the catering business are just as top notch as the people in their restaurants. The quality is just as good when they bring the meal to you and service is top notch and then some. To touch base very quickly on 4Rivers the company, I was lucky enough to be a guest at a YMCA breakfast where Johnny Rivers, the founder spoke about how he came to start the company and his corporate philosophy. You can feel good about supporting this company by eating at its restaurants. They are good corporate citizens who support the communities where they make their homes. So, what else can I say but 4R!"},{"name":"Tibisti Foods & Grill","address":"6990 Victoria Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I've been driving by this place for years and for some reason we stopped today.\\nSure glad we did!! the buffet was delicious, simple, tasty, fresh and loaded with flavour.\\nDisappointed we never tried it sooner,maybe a little face lift on the exterior might help \\nwith being more inviting.But don't hesitate going in the owner is very friendly and again the food rocks.Try the little samosa like fried dumplings  with their excellent tzatziki....yummmm\\nI tossed back a dozen myself they were so lite and tasty for a fried appy. and the potatoes were so silky and buttery....ok  now I need to go back...see you there."},{"name":"Flower Child","address":"11721 Rock Rose Ave, Ste 120","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I love flower child and have eaten here several times.

Big chunks of tender chicken, plenty for lunch tomorrow. My wife got a rice plate with chicken, which had a tasty sweet sauce on it that didn't really need anything else. Extra 2 bucks for brown rice instead of steamed but hey. She swiped some of my mint to add to her rice and decided that's how she going to make it from now on.

The supposedly \\"fresh\\" tuna was inedible. Overall the sushi rolls were on the bland side for us, even though we ordered spicy rolls. Even the wasabi wasn't strong, we asked for Srirachi but were given bland spicy mayo instead.

I always pass this place on my way to Sprouts but never had the urge to try it since I am not a big seafood person.  But when I heard that they had an Happy Hour, I was sold.The food choices during Happy Hour is limited as was the seating.  I did notice plenty of options for alcohol but passed as I only drink when there is a long night of drinking ahead.  Only the bar side offered the Happy Hour menu so seating is limited.  It is not a problem if you go early but fills up quickly.  The bartender was quick to take orders and the service was great as they explained the dish when it was delivered.The crab cake sliders are a must as they were delicious.  The bun was of perfect size as it did not overpower the crab cake.  We also tried a crunchy shrimp appetizer.  The breading was tasty and not too thick or distracting.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly which is often missed at most places.I did not try the desserts but did catch a glimpse of the offerings as they teased the patrons with a conveniently placed dessert tray.  Several items looked dangerously tempting especially for chocolate lovers - I noticed a rich looking cake option.  I was tempted but luckily there was enough distance between me and the tray to resist...this time.I liked the live music at the bar - a bit loud but the piano man was pretty good so I didn't mind as much.I may try Truluck's regular menu at some point but will definitely be back for the Happy Hour  - definitely one of the better Happy Hours in town (for food)."},{"name":"Winsor Dim Sum Caf√©","address":"10 Tyler St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Even though they DO serve delicious dim sum, THEIR SERVICE IS TERRIBLE.

When we paid and was getting ready to leave, like putting on our coats and stuff, the waiter said to us, RUDELY, \\"get out the way, other guests are gonna sit here.\\" And they kept on checking whether we have finished our food, like we have to rush our food and give our seats to the next customers in no time.\\nI will never ever go eat at this place ever again.

Despite this our service was excellent,  the food amazing and the atmosphere comfortable. \\n I shared three small plates and an entr√©e with my daughter. We also had fantastic brews. We had the Beef Ribeye with Frog Song, Handpies, Charred Okra and Fried Green Tomatoes. It was not a lot of food but exactly as much as we wanted. It was all perfectly prepared and served as it was finished in the kitchen so it was all fresh and hot. \\n We left satisfied to say the least and it was actually very reasonably priced. \\nI  can't wait to return to further explore their menu."},{"name":"Southern Kin Cookhouse","address":"500 Assembly Row","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"A new and hip place in the impressive assembly square. I came with 5 others, so we were fully prepared to indulge in the hefty menu. To start with we got the raspberry lemonade mixed drink that comes in a giant Mason jar pitcher with a spout. An ooh factor was that the glasses came with ice blocks that contained fruits and mint leaves inside - supposed to melt and release into your drink but alas all those goodies stayed frozen inside. The drink was pretty gooe, but we noticed that it was a ton of ice in the pitcher so not sure if you're getting a good deal.On to the food, where to start: for apps we started off with the tacos. The pictures on yelp were deceiving, these are super tiny! However I highly recommend as they were so flavorful. We also got their version of nachos, which came with pork rinds as the chips and a dipping plate with grits as the base; the fried pimento cheese balls, which were perfectly fried and came with a sweet jam and sauce; a biscuit with a fried green tomato and pork on top; chicken and waffles; various sides of Mac and cheese and creamed corn; and ribs. Of these a major issue was that the ribs were cold. We knew it wasn't from being left on our table for a while because they were cold to the inner bone. We notified our server just as a note for future orders - she offered to take it back but it was not that big of a deal for us. Also a lot of the food ran very sweet, and the fried chicken was under seasoned as I had to salt it myself. Service was top notch, and the general manager (or owner) came over frequently to interact and ask how everything was going. He also comped us a collard greens, which was very delicious!Will definitely come back as I love the vibe and food."},{"name":"Chevys Fresh Mex","address":"12547 State Rd 535","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"3.5","text":"I really enjoyed this place.

The pizza was wrong in both crust and toppings, the pasta was mush so my son didn't even eat it, the wings had sauce on them when I asked for none and the fact that they were obviously a not even close to being busy said a lot. I saw good reviews on here so I thought we would try it but I'm pretty sure that won't happen again with so many great places around Windermere, winter garden.

I have some food allergies, which make me a little more particular in where I eat and what I order and Earls has been good about this in the past.  My last 2 visits however, were much less impressive. On both of my last visits I have been served a beer in a dirty glass and in one case had to walk it up to the bar myself for a clean replacement, as our server never returned.  On my most recent visit I ordered the sirloin and asked for fries instead of mashed potato due to my dairy allergy (which I mentioned to the server). When the food arrived the steak had butter on top, this wasn't part of the menu description and hadn't happened before in the 5+ years I had been ordering there with my allergies. We asked why this had been changed and were told it had been done this way for 3 years. I found this a surprising answer as  I had never seen the steak served or described that way before and I had eaten a similar steak there a week prior (I ordered the steak frites and had made no mention of any dietary restrictions that day).  There was no real attempt at service recovery, and the staff seemed unperturbed that these errors had occurred. When I spoke to the manager on duty, he again repeated the 3+ years routine to which I replied that was unlikely due to the fact I had had the dish a week ago and any dairy on it would have made me quite ill. I am disappointed and frustrated to see that the quality of this restaurant has fallen so sharply from only a few months ago, but I am downright insulted that I was lied to by two staff members in order to justify their poor service as \\"following a recipe\\". I am sad to say I will be crossing Earls off of my already brief list of dining options in Richmond and if you have dietary restrictions or concerns I advise you to do the same."},{"name":"Max's Deli Cafe","address":"151 Milk St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Amazing spicy bacon avocado lettuce and tomato sandwich (get it on focaccia).

The chicken burger was chopped white chicken meat, muscle still evident (it wasn't a pureed or ground product, little filler, then battered and deep-fried.  Was crisp on the exterior and moist on the inside.  It was topped with a classic Buffalo wing sauce and blue cheese crumbles, lettuce and tomato on a soft, toasted brioche bun.  Perfect meat to bun ratio and just the right amount of toppings.  I am a condiment fanatic, so the Sauce Bar is a dream.  Got talked into the Toasted Marshmallow sauce for the sweet potato fries, not my thing.  I like them with the Thai Ketchup (a slight kick).  No sauce is necessary for them, though, the shoestrings are crisp and salty sweet and great on their own.  Had a Strawberry Shortcake Shake for dessert.  It was blended on the spot, still icy and thick, plenty of whipped cream and cake chunks, delicious!  Service was impeccable for a place that doesn't have table service.

Mark was a pleasure to work with, from confirming the menu and details beforehand to setting a welcoming and relaxed atmosphere, he was a wonderful addition to our group. He was very accommodating with dietary restrictions and designed a menu that was seasonal and incorporated a lot of local, organic produce. We're all foodies who love to cook, and after showing us where to get an apron, putting the wine in a wine cooler, we got straight to chopping and kneading. We had sweet corn and herbed goat cheese ravioli with browned butter and sage, baked herbed shrimp over giant greek white bean ragu, and a stone fruit cake with orange caramel sauce. The meal did take a while to prepare, but that's probably because we were all chatting away and enjoying each others company. The space is very quaint and well decorated, with cook books and antiques and vintage cooing appliances on the walls.

There's extensive open space to play (bring a frisbee or a football) for adults and kids.

A group of friends and I went in the evening and there was no shaded seating available out back. We never had that problem before. Sitting in the sun, sweat beading on our foreheads... we had one drink and left. Really hoping they get something figured out back there! Loved it before. Lack of shade really put a damper on the patio parade!

After a period of six months not visiting, I was so disappointed visiting for brunch today. First, where is the drink menu with the bloody marys and the other brunchy drinks? We were only presented the full drink menu. The wait staff seems inexperienced and without care. At one point two of them were so intent on their conversation, walking parallel down the main aisle, that I had to step out of their way. The manager took food away from our table that we weren't finished eating. \\nThe food was definitely in the camp of 'I've experienced better' but unfortunately I've experienced better THERE. The 'red-eye gravy' was too salty. The eggs were overcooked. The grits were lumpen. The waffle, not crispy but doughy and lackluster. \\nThe restaurant was not full, so I'm not sure how things were so rushed and bad feeling. \\nThis place is off my list of recommendations."},{"name":"Nemesis Coffee","address":"302 W Hastings Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Great place to relax and grab a coffee.

So instead of flogging a dead horse, let's talk service. I was there for a birthday party with about 24 people tonight. 24 people are not easy to serve all at the same time, each wine being poured at the same time, each course being brought out at the same time. At every other restaurant I've ever eaten and probably will ever eat, if I've got 24 people with me, I'm going to expect something to go wrong or some waiter or waitress to have some attitude problems, and I'll always give the wait staff a pass. I know now that I've cut every other restaurant in the world too much slack.The folks at Beast were perfect. The service we were provided looked like a well-rehearsed ballet, every aspect carefully staged and choreographed. They even looked like they were having fun with it. Having fun serving 24 people, each of whom has drunk six glasses of wine? That's not easy to pull off.But oh, theirs was a nuanced performance, and they found ways to make even perfection seem ordinary; behold the following example. During the fifth course my friend lost the handle on her fork and it fell. Not even a second after it hit the floor with a high-pitched clink, before my friend had even made the neuro-physical connection between losing the fork and realizing she needed a new one, our waitress had already presented her with a new fork.That is some mind-blowing service.

What really sets S&S apart is their commitment to showcasing their one-of-a-kind flavors such that the actual ice cream base almost takes a backseat -- they really don't mess around with their ingredients or flavor profiles! Each scoop is LOADED with the advertised ingredients, allowing you to taste every nuanced detail within its carefully crafted flavor profile. The ice cream base itself isn't very sweet, but what it lacks in sugar it more than makes up for in butterfat content (a whopping 17%), making for an ultra dense, creamy scoop.My main quibble with S&S, however, is that I don't think ice cream is the best vehicle for showcasing certain flavor combinations. For example, honey balsamic strawberry with cracked black pepper? That's a KILLER combination that would work fabulously on a crostini. But in ice cream form? I certainly respect S&S's commitment to letting the flavors of the scoop shine through, but the overt pepperiness combined with the pungent tang of balsamic and strawberries makes for a less than delicate dessert."},{"name":"Pei Wei","address":"7571 Sawmill Rd.","city":"Dublin","stars":"3.5","text":"GOOD , FAST , & CHEAP ! .......

Did I say ever? I meant EVER! ok enough of this. As soon as you walk in, the staff is warm and friendly. They offer suggestion and help. We ordered the shroom burger, which was very tasty, they top it with crimini mushrooms instead of button mushrooms, and fontina cheese. We also had the bacon cheesy burger, now I always get bacon cheeseburgers anywhere I go and this was hands down the best. The bacon was crisp, the produce was fresh and the buns are brioche buns. The kids got hot dogs and kids cheese burger, my daughter who got the cheeseburger ate it all before I even got halfway through my burger.The sauce bar is a nice touch. We enjoyed being able to our dip fries in different flavors. The milkshakes are EPIC! We only got one but it was better than anywhere we have had milkshakes.\\nThis is a don't miss place.

He explained that it was a family style service and that the plates come out when they are ready. So we decided to try the chocolate potato donuts, the steak and cheddar eggs, and the French toast. The portions are smaller for a family style serving. The donuts were more like donut holes but they were delicious, crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. My favorite was the steak and cheddar eggs. They came served in a cast iron skillet with a cornmeal pancake, about two eggs and 4 steak medallions.

As for food (and the cons):  they brought out bread and bruschetta to start with, which we both liked.  Then we ordered the calamari appetizer, which was...eh.  We love calamari and get it most places we go if its on the menu, and this was very bland.  There was nothing special about it.  I ordered the orrechiette pasta with sausage and my boyfriend ordered the lasagna.  Again, both were...eh.  We have had better.

We sat down, figured out what we wanted. We were greeted rather promptly after sitting down by a very nice gal. She grabbed our drinks and order rather quick so I figured maybe the guy who greeted us was having a bad night. Well after she took our order we didn't see her again. Someone else brought our food out, which working in the restaurant industry for over 10 years I knew was normal. We had to ask for extra silverware from a server in a completely separate area. When I asked the lady who was busing a table for some extra \\"settings\\" she looked at me like I was out of my mind. She looked at our table and nonchalantly said \\"oh I guess\\". Walked away from me and then came back a minute later and said \\" wait what exactly do you need\\"  like we were just throwing a wrench in her evening.  Bottom line. The food was far from wonderful, service terrible, and if it weren't for us leaving an item at the restaurant i would opt out of going back which makes me sad cause it's so convenient to our home and looks like a pretty cool place.

Less than two minutes elapse and the same hostess seats another party at the exact table we asked to be seated at. Strike one. We then explained to our server that we would be staying to watch the game and she apparently took that as a way of saying please don't come to our table to help us because over the next 3-1/2 hours we saw her 3 more times....

Strike three!!With three minutes left in our game my girlfriend excused herself to go find the manager on duty (Adam). Adam came back to our table and blurted out \\"What would you like?\\"  I told him that we wanted to order two more beers and some dessert but nobody acknowledged us for 30 minutes. He told me some people sit for 6 hours and don't want to be bothered. He then blamed his wait staff. He never took responsibility for his role as the manager to properly train his staff.

In our case, Saltyard did nothing but disappoint.  Read on for the full story...We went to the Saltyard for my friend's birthday.  We had a large party of around 14 people.  We also brought our own cake (due to my friend's dietary restrictions). Most restaurants don't have any issues with serving an externally bought birthday cake for a modest fee.Everything seemed to start fine. The drinks were fine, the menu was a contemporary mix of small plates and shared plates.  As we were a large party, we \\"buddied up\\" and divided ourselves into smaller groups of 2-3 people so we can share our orders and also make the check breakdown easier.The trouble started with the $58 - 16 oz ribeye that my friend and I ordered.  It was the most expensive item on the menu but in a restaurant that only has four other legitimate entrees, one would expect that this would be a \\"flagship\\" dish.  Let me give you a spoiler here folks, it was not.  The first issue was that it was salty.  Like covered in salt to the point that I am still sitting here on the morning after - feeling like I ate too much sodium for dinner.  The other issue was that it was fatty.  Really fatty.  We are not talking about marbling here - this steak seemed on par with a USDA choice ribeye one can get at a supermarket for $9.99 a pound and not something that was priced $58 a pound. On top of all this, I asked for the steak to be cooked medium rare.  The steak that came back was on the rare side of rare. The waitress came by just at the moment when I momentarily touched the middle of my steak (to see if it was warm at all) and talking about it with my dinner companion.  She asked if everything was alright and then insisted that she takes the steak back \\"to make it right\\".  This is the bizarre part - nobody would have sent that steak back had she not insisted on it.  We would have just sucked it up, eaten it, and moved on (after all this a birthday party).  At first, I was elated that the restaurant is really going to make things right however my hopes were dashed when she mentioned they will simply cook it some more.  My friend at this point mentioned that there were other issues with this \\"remedy\\" as the steak was also very salty,  we were not satisfied with the cut, and also if they cooked it again then the garnishments would likely lose all texture.  She seemed to listen to this and took the steak to her manager.Now in my past experience at restaurants - the only way to make this situation right would be one of the following: 1. You remove the steak from the bill and \\"finish cooking it\\" followed by an apology.  2. Cook a new steak.  3. Ask us if we wanted something else and make it. As our steak was being taken to the purgatory, I had a side conversation with my friend.  We both decided it would be totally fine to just remove the entree from our check and we just forget the whole thing.  He went up to tell the manager this, however, this idea was not welcomed... Instead, the manager made the decision to finish cooking the steak (as apparently it was decided we did not know what a medium rare steak looks like).  I will agree what makes a steak medium rare is a debatable topic, but this was only one of the THREE problems that we brought up with the entree.Anyways what followed during the dinner was one cringe after another.  They brought the remainder of the steak back... a bit more cooked this time but still as salty and fatty as ever.  The garnishments lost any sort of texture. My friend actually stopped eating his portion of the steak due to the high sodium. When the waitress came by again to check if it was better, I could only solemnly nod and say \\"yes it's fine\\", as I did not want to make any sort of a detriment to the birthday celebration.  The bill was over 600 dollars for 14 people including gratuity and a $35 dollar cake serving fee (yes they charged the full thing even after the steak situation).  Based on my experience here, if you are ever trying to schedule a group dinner, go to one of the other restaurant options in the Atlanta area.  I assure you they will be more accommodating and customer-centric.  In my eyes the Saltyard, is truly a .... salt yard."},{"name":"4 Rivers Smokehouse","address":"11764 University Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Wow so slow and rude workers!!!

Destroyed everything. The shumai comes in single pieces. If you order 1 shu mai, you're only getting 1 piece. The beef tataki is very spicy. After 1 piece it's okay, but after like 3 you start getting teary eyed. Avocado crab salad isn't really that good either, too much lettuce. The tuna tartars were very good, I liked how they have tempura flakes on them! We finished almost everything except for the beef tataki ;_;Sushi: We then got to the sashimi and nigiri. Typical salmon, white tuna, red tuna, and clams. I'm not much of a fan of this so I didn't eat too much. I had the white tuna. I thought the fish felt cold, probably straight from the freezer so it threw me off a little bit. But nonetheless we finished all of them even doe we might have ordered a little too much.Maki: No no no no no Red Sox maki. I'm pretty sure that's what it was called.

My sweetheart asked me if I wanted to go Wednesday evening and so we were off...  We arrived just after happy hour, but luckily every Wednesday for a while, they are offering 50% off bottles of wine.  Well if you know one thing about me, you know I like my wine.  I went for a Napa Cabernet, can't go wrong with a true Napa (usually).  This time was no exception.  The wine was good, and we decided to go for the appetizers.  This has been our thing lately, tapas everywhere we go.  At this restaurant, you might still get a bill that's a bit higher than other places, but the food is great and in smaller portions; perfect for someone watching his weight, but just enough to satiate.We ordered the spicy fried shrimp which was deliciously golden brown and was served with honey, no tiny shrimp here for that... these were big and juicy, splayed out and honey brown.  In addition to the shrimp, we ordered the goat cheese trio, a plate of varying degrees of creamy lactose-free goodness.  The bread to spread it on was warm and freely flowing.  One was plain with honey and crisp apple slices, the next had a port wine reduction and olives and the third had bacon bits, together they sang to my stomach with varying degrees of salty sweet and savory accents all to themselves.  Our third app was the crab cake sliders, not my favorite, and could have used some salt (note there was none on the table).  They were, however, nicely stuffed and mild in flavor with the tiniest of garnish, nothing to complain about, just not as flavorful as what I had hoped to get.Our waitress was attentive and unobtrusive.  I think she definitely knew the proper amount of interjection and suggestion.  She saw to my sponge-like bladder and brought what seemed like three bottles of chilled water to the table in our short stint at the restaurant.  The piano man crooned as we talked about our dreams and problems that were washed over with fanciful flavors and drown in the squeezings of some of the finest Napa vine fruit.

The host made a point to take my phone number down along with my name for the wait list, to prevent overcrowding and yet after 25 of the 45 min. expected wait, I returned to inquire as to whether my name had been called and the answer was \\"Yes.\\"  \\"Oh, did you call my phone number that you asked to take down?\\"  \\"No.\\"  Nice.  No apologies offered, but they rectified their error by seating me within 5 minutes in a very cramped communal table where my date and I felt like we were crashing someone else's gathering--we were literally eating next to one another with our corresponding elbows overlapped and our shoulders crushed together, and we averaged-sized people.  I never wanted to go back.  On my second visit (someone else was paying, so what the hell--I needed to give it another try), I did a weekday lunch-- this is definitely the time to go.  The service was much better and far less chaotic.  I found that for three people, five dishes was about right.  Some things (like soup and sandwiches) just can't/shouldn't be shared, so I don't know why they bother putting them on their \\"to be shared\\" menu, without portioning them out in a more sharing-friendly way.  I've both lived and dined in Europe and making excuses for a small kitchen by bringing measly a la carte dishes is in no way reminiscent of any meal I've ever eaten abroad.  \\"Family style\\" to me means that more than one person could take at least two bites of something and share it.  I did not perceive this to be the case at Tasty.  The ingredients are fresh and rather interesting.  The execution is well above average.  However, the portions are pretentious and rather measly.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not expecting some 1,500 calorie Cracker Barrel-esque tall hog at the trough meal, I would just like for my $9 Bloody Mary to not be the worst I've ever tasted and my petite  $$ Omlette to either come with garnish or something little to make me feel like less of a sucker becuase there is nothing remarkable about the food except that it is not traditional brunch fare."},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"So good.

Satu'li Canteen was a definite HIT, all capital letters and a few exclamation points!!!!What's even harder than finding super good food is finding good vegan/plant based food. I don't want a veggie burger that is filled with sugars and stuff I can't pronounce. The other problem is most of the disney restaurants want to serve me tofu. I don't eat tofu. I can't eat tofu. With all that said my lunch at Satu'li was probably the best I have had in a long time. I asked for the allergy menu to figure out what to eat. When I got to the cashier I asked if I could get 2 from option 2s. He told me that he could not. Then when he started ringing he saw that I could her the 2 number 2s as sides and it would be cheaper than ordering one bowl with the tofu on the side. This option is not on the menu, so be sure to ask. So I ordered the quinoa kale veggie and the red & sweet potato hash. I got the sauces on the side and got the onion chimichurri and the Black bean vinaigrette. Both were tasty, but my favorite was the vinaigrette.   Neither of the bowls needed the sauces. They were both flavorful and you can tell if wasn't sitting. My husband had a beef bowl, also with the vegetable kale quinoa. It not only looked pretty but he ate every last grain. We also had a chocolate cake. It was okay. Tasty but nothing exciting. The cupcake they gave me for my birthday was yummy. Food is served in real bowls and they have real silverware.

You are supposed to give your food order to the cooks who you cannot see or hear over the piles of sandwich breads and ingredients. I was shouting to him what I wanted while another guy was leaning over me ordering in the middle of my order.

We were the only people in there besides a guy sitting at a desk so I went to turn it down significantly so I could actually converse with my friend.

I told him it was very loud and I would like to actually have lunch with my friend.He told me he was the manager and that I should not assume things and do what I want. ARE YOU REALLY FOR REAL. I tried to stop talking to him, but he kept going on and making jabs at me and the fact that I did not ask. He then brought my friend into the situation which was extremely unnecessary. He was literally mumbling, and I could not understand him. After some time he did not realize it would be appropriate to let us try and enjoy our meal, and I told him we were taking our food and leaving and he basically shooed us out.Lets talk about the food, shall we?I got a salad that literally had a pound of melted cheese on it.

There is not much to say about the interior of the restaurant. There is no d√©cor or atmosphere to speak of.  However, once you taste the pizza none of that will matter.

Just absolutely stunning; and let me tell you, my tastebuds get around!My dining partner and I (long time friend and ex-executive chef) attended the 8:45 seating. Perhaps one of my favorite parts of the meal was the fact that I didn't leave until 12:15. Eating is too often an in and out experience, and taking over 3 hours to enjoy my meal, wine, the atmosphere, and good conversation, was a great way to spend the evening. This is one thing to keep in mind, leaving beast in less than 2 hours is just not possible, so don't go for a quick bite to eat. This is truly an experience to be savored.Beast is a simple, small restaurant with an open kitchen and dish pit. You can watch every detail of service from anywhere in the restaurant. The counterspace for the kitchen? A long, beautiful, butcher block. French cookbooks line the walls, along with pickling jars. The immense chalkboard around the restaurant serves up witty quotes, drawings, and conversation pieces. The dining tables: one small 8 seat communal table and a longer communal table towards the back, beautifully stained wood.Eating at Beast is just a special experience. The communal seating is a wonderful thing, especially in a prix-fixe environment. Once the wine gets flowing, the conversation opens up, and savoring your meal with your new-found friends makes the experience even better. Food is about memories, bringing back old memories and making new ones. Beast does an excellent job of helping to create new memories.Now, onto the food. Our first course was a french onion soup with a gruyere crouton. Chef Naomi, you and your team nailed this soup. The sublte sweetness of the cognac, the rich, complex beef flavor, the perfectly cooked onions, and the cheese...oh my. That gruyere was out of this world. Also, my crouton still retained a small bit of crunch, even after being submerged for 10 minutes. That textural contrast was nice. The wine pairing was also perfect on this course.Munching on the never-ending, delicious baguette in between courses was great.Second course was the famed charceuterie plate. Foie gras bon bon. Best bite of the night. The complexity and richness was just incredible. It was one of those eyes roll back in your head moments. The leaf lard cracker and chicken liver mousse were also quite good. Overall, the charceuterie plate was stunning and delicious. I have to say, duck proscuitto seemed bland and overly chewy. I also got a bit of crunch from it that wasn't very pleasing. I can overlook this minor detail though. If I remember correctly, the wine pairing was a riesling. Also quite good.Third course was the fennel brined pork with butter braised cabbage, mustard seed, apricot and bacon verjus, and veal jus gastrique. My only knock on this course was that I lost the fennel in the other flavors. Not that I mind, I'm not a huge fennel fan. The pork was a delicious pork belly with a high fat content. That beautiful melt in your mouth fat that you cannot get enough of. The sauces, just out of this world. Rich, deep, with a tiny bit of sweetness. And hey, what can make fatty pork belly better? Fu*ckin bacon, that's what! The mustard seeds provided a nice textural crunch to the dish which really took it to another level. A very well thought out and tasty dish. I mopped up the sauce with my bread afterwards!The first three courses got progressively better, but the last 3 disappointed a little bit. The fourth course was a house cured salmon with a radish, endive, and citrus salad with a horseradish vinaigrette. The salad was texturally pleasant, but overly bitter and without any real punch. The horseradish was undetectable, and that was sad. I think having that bit of heat would have really made the dish better. A touch of sea salt would have made it much better as well. The salmon was good, but nothing special. As far as the cheese course, I've had better. This isn't really a reflection on Beast though, as the accompaniments were quite good. I enjoyed the plum, local honey, and fried almonds. To me, this was a throw away course.The dessert was a apple strudel with walnuts, almond ice milk, and ginger caramel. I'm not a sweet dessert person, but this was pretty good. The strudel was okay, but the almond ice milk was divine, and the subtlety of the ginger in the caramel was impressive.Overall, the meal was great. The first three courses were just incredible, and the last three were hit and miss. However, the overall experience was phenomenal, and I really had a great time. Beast's staff is friendly, welcoming, attentive, and knowledgeable. Our water and wine glasses never went empty, the staff was happy to talk with us when they weren't busy, and Chef Naomi was gracious enough to let us pick her brain for a moment. I will definitely be returning to Beast.

Every month, Salt n Straw has a menu of limited flavors that kick the weirdness to 11. For November, they have Thanksgiving flavors from pumpkin pie to casserole.

If you want a bar-like vibe near the bar they have the inside area, where it's easier to meet people and have the classic bar experience. When you walk through the bar, you get to an outdoor seating area that is under a roof that is about twice as high up as the ceiling in the bar.  This area has picnic tables and in the very back has a cute seating area. This is where people usually eat, have drinks and hang out.The vibe is what made this place because the food too us was not the best. I've had vegan food before, I usually don't eat it though. But I went with friends who eat a lot of Vegan food (though again not vegan) and they didn't like the food too much either. Basically if it was just looking at the food it would be a 2 star, but the good environment raised the rating for me.We ordered the mac and cheese, Tofu Banh Mi sandwich and the Steve Martin sandwich. The Steve Martin sandwich was pretty good and we all liked it. The tofu banh mi was okay, not the best.

Choosing a flavor was incredibly hard since they were all so delicious, so we did a single scoop split into two flavors, the lavender honey and salted caramel.  I really like lavender so it is often my go to and this was hands down the best lavender ice cream I've ever had.  When I walked by again on Tuesday night around 8 or 9 pm, the line was very long and out the door.

I asked the Genius Bar tech if he had any food suggestions, and he recommended I came here.So I walked over and asked the two people standing in front if they were in line. They said no, they had already ordered, and explained that you wait here to take your order or to get a table (or something like that).One waitress was working her tail off and visited the cashier stand that I was waiting by two times before asking if I had been helped. I said no and that I was waiting and she says one of the girls will assist me. Those girls stared at me while folding their napkins but never once came over. Now, I'm not afraid to make eye contact to get someone's attention but they both looked back at me and didn't help!! Were their feet glued to the floor??Finally the busy waitress rescues me and tells me that I could just pick a seat. I ordered the single smokehouse burger & fries. Nice waitress lady brought my fries out before the burger, which was great since I was starving and was at the mall alone with no phone to distract me. She even drew a cat using ketchup on my plate. She was incredible. The burger was great. I couldn't even finish the meal because it was so filling. The fries are like steak fries (which I love). The burger had the right amount of sauce to fried onions to bacon to meat ratio. Yum. I will definitely order it to go next time, and maybe with chili & cheese on my fries.I would not recommend this place to a fellow germophobe. The doors to the kitchen were greasy and the jukebox at the table with the ketchup stains grossed me out. My phone (or other people) usually helps in distracting me whenever I go to restaurants like this, but unfortunately all I could do was stare at the clock. The good thing is the waitress checked on me often and they had great Christmas music playing. The food was great and so I will come again.

This is a small establishment in downtown Decatur, so of course you'd have to find parking. There are lots and parallel parking available where you can pay to park. I don't recommend parking in private lots such as bank lots because you'll definitely have a boot on your car when you come back out. I loved this place because it gave me a food truck vibe without it actually being a food truck. There are a few seats available inside, but I would definitely recommend grabbing one of their outdoor tables if the day is nice and if they're available. The menu is smaller than other Korean taco places I've been to here, but there's still plenty of options to choose from. I'm almost certain that the gentleman and the woman working there are the owners (I regrettably forgot to ask them), and they were both very friendly and helpful. I ordered the quesadilla with the spicy pork (daeji bulgogi), and it was delicious. I loved that you were able to add protein into the quesadilla, and there was plenty of it, and it was very flavorful. I loved it, and just thinking about it is making me want more right now! My boyfriend ordered a Korean BBQ burrito with beef, and that was just as delicious. There was kim chi fried rice and edamame in the burrito as well, and I thought that was very different and unique. My only complaint about the burrito was that the protein wasn't very evenly distributed, so there was more meat on one half of the burrito and more rice and beans on the other half. We also ordered the fries, but I must admit I wasn't the biggest fan of those. They just weren't very crunchy, and I didn't find them as tasty as everything else we had. Considering how delicious our quesadilla and burrito was and how friendly they are here, the fries are definitely not a deal breaker.

The waitress disappeared so many times, I thought we were at a magic show. The wait for the food wasn't too bad for a sit down restaurant, but due to the amount of people that were in the establishment (less than 10 customers in which 4 were only drinking and just hanging around) it could have been better. I ordered the smothered chicken and my mom ordered the stew chicken.  This is the first time in my life that I had been served chicken backs (major side eye...)  Please keep in mind that a piece of dental floss has more meat on it than the back of a chicken. When I was finally able to hunt the waitress down (she disappeared to the kitchen for most of the night, guess she was playing double duty and cooking the food also) and ask her for an extra plate because we did not want the chicken backs and would like another piece of chicken instead she brought the plate but nothing else.  When the magic act finally resumed (the waitress finally reappeared after me having to keep my eye on the kitchen door area and flag her down) I asked about our chicken, she gave me a look as though I asked her to co-sign on a car or give me her first born child.  She then said that she'd bring her manager over, the manager didn't show for at least another 15 minutes.  I'm not sure what the reason for the delay in response time to customers is with this place, but it's insane...    I can't forget about the rice and peas that were so dry, it was painful to eat.  Even my first attempt at making rice & peas was waaaayyyyy better than what they served.  A heavy dose of gravy helped moisturize and give taste to the rice & peas. I then again explained to the manager that we did not want the backs of the chicken and he tried to tell us that the back of the chicken was really the quarter - SIDE EYE........  Both my mom & I explained that a quarter is typically a thigh and a leg.  The back is not considered a part of the quarter and further more the chicken had to be cut up (as the back was separated from the drumstick on the plate).  I guess after he finally realized that he wasn't talking to people that would fall for the first thing that was told to them, he said that he would get us more food (mind you this was asked a long time ago).  The extra food was prepared and brought out to us and we were finally able to leave although highly disappointed.  Not one time, did the manager offer anything for the inconvenience with the order or lack of customer service delivered from the ever so disappearing waitress.  And to make matters even worse, when we got home and looked at the food as we were putting it in the fridge - they added the chicken backs right back to the orders,NEVER AGAIN WILL I VISIT THIS ESTABLISHMENT NOR WILL I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.  I'D RATHER TAKE A 30 MINUTE DRIVE TO SOMEPLACE THAT I KNOW THE FOOD WILL BE WORTH IT.... Although the waitress was MIA most of the time and never checked on us to see how the food was or if we needed anything we still left her a 15% tip which was extremely generous due to the level of service that was received....Stir It Up needs to stir it up and get competent staff members that know how to deliver customer service."},{"name":"Hop's Chicken","address":"675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Had the chicken sandwich with honey mustard and the Mac n cheese.

We ordered separately but were with a group of three others that were directly in front of us in line. The others in our group received their food about 3 minutes after sitting down. We sat there and looked at and smelled their delicious looking food.  After they were pretty much done with their food, a server came over and let us know that ours would be a few more minutes due to the brisket still cooking.  A couple minutes after that, a gentlemen who I assume was the owner or manager came by and let us know that the brisket would be another 25 minutes. His attitude and graciousness were the epitome of good customer service. He offered and brought us ribs as a replacement for the brisket, gave us extra meat, and offered drinks to our table!

I called 3 times..to see if it was really still serving the full menu that late (yes)- to see if they were still delivering once I went to the website (stopped at 11) and again to place the order.  The bartender, Tracy I think, was funny and not annoyed that I kept calling, which was a great start.  When I placed the order I was asked how long I'd be so they could time the order to my arrival which was really nice.  In fact I dealt with both the bartender and her boss and both were as nice as could be. Ya, it's a divey restaurant/ bar off Division, with regular Chinese Food, cheap prices and large portions. Exactly what I was expecting and better than I'd hoped for.We ordered egg rolls, crispy pretty normal and not grease logged, combo fried rice no egg which they got right and it was good, szechwan beef...not my taste...but i like it dry saut√©ed not \\"wet\\" not my fave but nothing \\"wrong\\" with it, salt & pepper prawns which 1. I forgot to tell them no veggies so they were soggy (my fault) and 2 I asked for no shell and they thought I said no salt lol so there was no salt...but they were still Good...nice size and nothing fishy about them and the Generals Chicken which to me was a winner simply because they use chicken BREAST not slimy thigh meat. Was it the best ever? No, but it was a FAR CRY from Horrible.  I've had FAR worse and the fact that they deliver within 10 miles for a mere $3!   Thats awesome! The food was hot, fresh, they remembered red sauce, hot mustard and soy sauce without being asked, and the bag weighed as much as a small child! Decent food, fair prices, awesome service.

Also, not sure if the chefs changed but the food doesn't taste as good as before. Just today, we went in and ordered some dishes. Since my friends and I come here a lot, we ordered the same dishes that we had many times in the past and liked. One of the dishes tasted horrible, straight up sour. If it was tolerable we would still eat, but it's just too sour. Not sure if they put too much vinegar in there or what. My friend nicely told the waitress that the dish tasted different than before and it's too sour. The waitress said that she would take it back and make another one. I thought that was it, but NO. The worst possible dining experience imaginable. After 2 minutes, another lady (I think the boss or manager) came back with the dish and tells us that they will not remake the dish for us because everyone in the back tasted it and its fine, and its the exact same as before. Not to mention how rude her tone was. OMG, I was shocked because I had this dish at least 10 times and it does not taste like vinegar. The lady then kept on saying it was fine and that's what it taste like, and put the plate they took back on our table again. We didn't want to make a scene in front of other customers so we just quietly finished our other dishes and left the sour dish untouched. My friend went up to pay for the bill and he payed for all the other dishes PLUS tips. Then my friend told the lady at the front that all of us were unable to eat the sour dish and since they refused to remake the dish we won't be paying for it. The lady's face turned all mad and yelled at my friend in front of all the other customers in Chinese. She yelled, you can't just eat our food and not pay, making a huge scene in the restaurant. Honestly, at that time it was like WHAT THE ACTUAL F, because we wanted to be nice but they are just pushing us too far. In the end one of our friends shouted, why don't you ask other customers to try it, see what they will say. This drew the attention of all the customers in the restaurant (my apologies to the customers there, it was very awkward), so the lady finally said we'll make you another dish. But we literally finished eating everything and was about to leave. We decided to still sit down and wait for them to remake the dish after all this happened. We sat down for 2 minutes, and one of the waitresses tells us to just leave (I'm guessing they were really busy since the restaurant was full). We said thank you to the waitress and she replied saying: \\"Don't come anymore if you don't like our food, because it's the same.\\"So disappointed, and this is not the first bad experience in a Chinese restaurant in Richmond.

Goat taco goat is to be slow roasted and tenderized making it soft and decadent. Felt and tasted like a chewy strap. Beef tongue was ok but also very bland and under seasoned. My wife got the vegan taco which was the highlight last time. It was flavorless and bland, rice and beans with a corn tortilla may be vegan but that doesn't make it flavorful. My children accompanied us as well they got vegetable quesadillas with no veggies!! Beans and avocado with cheese hardly makes for vegetables.

It has a sign out front that says \\"Blah, we're just another shop in this boring plaza.\\"  In fact, from the front, it looks more like an Office than a restaurant.The plaza has some parking in the front, just make sure you're following the One Way signs properly.What first appears to be a dinky little place, turns out to be ok after all.  You'll be greeted by some young, pretty faces that appear too young to have been tainted by life's woes just yet...standing behind a Bakery Display...that looks like it has some great items in it.  The dining room is visible at this point...and I'd say the place seats about, oh, 30 people or so...unless I missed a secret door to a larger room somewhere.All of the staff seem to be very friendly...and bustle about attending to their tables.Two buddies of mine and I were escorted to our seat and our waitress came right over.We started with a usual coffee...and began to review the menu.Nice.A decent and simple looking menu...with some usual Specialty Inserts...offering Breakfast and Lunch fare.Banana Foster pancakes?  Shut yo mouth, that sounds good.  Blueberry pancakes...Mmmm, love those and I read that these pancakes are jammed with blueberries...both bananas and blueberries are clearly in the fruit group, so it's healthy, amirite?!  The only problem with eating pancakes is you're pretty much eating dessert for breakfast.  Not saying THAT is a bad thing, but pancakes have a way of reminding you ALL day long that you ate them that morning.I almost opted for the Potato Pancakes, (which you don't see on many menus), as I am a huge fan of all sorts of potato products, but I like to judge a breakfast place with the very typical breakfast meal...some eggs over medium, a potato side, some breakfast meat side, toast, coffee and juice or milk.So, instead of the tempting potato pancakes, I went for the Hungry Man...or the Hungry Meal...or Christoper's Hungry Breakfast...or the \\"Wow, you're a Hungry Pig\\" Meal.  I don't recall exactly now, but it has the word \\"hungry\\" in it.  Ya know...much like most breakfast places...that one meal where you seem to get a little bit of everything.  No pancakes or french toast tho...that's the \\"who-wants-to-live-forever\\" Special Meal each place also has.3 Eggs over medium, home fries, wheat toast, 1% milk, coffee. with your choice of bacon, sausage or both..and the three of us split a corned beef hash, cuz we figured hey, why not throw in another 500 calories.One of my buds got the same thing I did...the other one got the Ham Steak breakfast.All in all...we were quite impressed.Eggs were all cooked perfectly...home fries, w/ the skins on, tasted like red bliss possibly...very tasty...the side of corned beef hash was a bit expensive, but you could clearly taste a higher quality hash here...and then the bacon, sausage and ham, all being very nice.And of course the coffee...an xlnt measure for a breakfast place...was pretty good too.As far as price, it's not exactly the cheapest breakfast you'll have consumed...but I think they might be serving higher quality food than what you might get elsewhere.  Don't get me wrong, it's not expensive, per se...some things on the menu are cheaper than others...but anyway, if you're anything like me...I like a good hearty breakfast, w/ coffee and something cold to drink.  So after tips and taxes, (yes taxes, the government spends our money to bail out Big Business faster than a redneck that just hit the lottery...but I digress...), over $10 bucks here is pretty likely.I wouldn't say this place was the knock-me-down-carry-me-out-best breakfast ever...but it sure beats what is in my Billerica Area for breakfast.I think we'll definitely be hitting this place up again.Now to fix that bland sign of theirs......."},{"name":"Floating Rock","address":"485 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Dear Floating Rock,Are you familiar with \\"The Odyssey\\"?

It was sad to see the previous restaurants not do well here, that I thought maybe the location was cursed. I think this is the first time, since Hops, that I've seen a restaurant brew their own beer on location. You can really taste the difference in quality of a fresh brew. A tip of the hat to their brewer. The first time here, we didn't make reservations. We had the option of waiting, or sitting at the community table with strangers. We chose the latter. It was different sitting next to people you didn't know, but through the meal we had little conversations going that were enjoyable....even for someone like me that can be an introvert. The Boar Stew was awesome. They have on a board that the boar was from Texas, as well as the origin of other dishes. If this was a Portlandia episode, they'd have a scrap book about the boar's life.We took my parents here the next time, and I wasn't sure how they would like it, since it's a different type of restaurant than they're used to (Chinese Buffets, Carrabba's and Tex-Mex joints). I remember my Dad liking the Fish Fry. I'm not a big pork eater, so it was nice to try the Duck Ham which I'll recommend. The last time I went, friends and I sat by the bar for happy hour. You can't beat their half off beers at $3 each. The $1 oysters were good too, with their signature dipping's, but I don't think that was really a good deal, when you could get a dozen for under $10 for happy hour at other places. 50 or 75 cents each would be more happy hour prices for me.I'm usually not big into southern cooking, because most of the time I find it fried and greasy, but Cask & Larder does a good job at taking the fried and greasy out of most of their dishes and still makes it taste wonderful (I hope this doesn't sound too ignorant of me).I can't wait to go back again.

Fresh ingredients and a creative menu help to provide an offering that is diverse and tasty.  Their use of small, tapas style plates allows you to really customize and diversify your tasting experience without slamming your pocketbook or overwhelming you with guilt for just having put down a 5000 calorie meal. Some of the other practices, although designed to help alleviate service pressures, end up detracting from the experience.  Their \\"serve as prepared\\" motto is one such example.  Although the food comes out relatively quickly, the order is fairly random.  We had our dates come out at the same time as one of our larger plates, and the sweet biscuits came right after the glazed yams.  Without any concern for palate cleansing contrasts, much of the efforts of the kitchen get muted b/c some of the flavors of one dish do not transition well to the next.  But this is more of a minor annoyance and the quality of the food here is its distinguishing factor.Some of the dishes we were able to sample were as follows:Dim Summore - an Asian twist upon the bloody mary prepared with srirach and hoisin sauce. A bit sweeter than your standard BM but just as goodChocolate potato donut  - served with creme anglaise, it was relatively light and served hot and fresh, it is something that is difficult to turn downBacon wrapped date - maple glazed and almond stuffed it was a tasty morsel but at $2 a pop, not distinguishing enough to justify the cost.Glazed yams with cumin-maple - probably one of the best surprises of our meal.  The maple didn't make the yams super sweet and the cumin provided a nice essence that was more discernible as you finished your bitesErin's sweet biscuits - served with a warm blueberry compote, it was a nice airy biscuit with some outer textural crunch.  But $6 for two half dollar size seems a bit steep.Shakshuka red pepper tomato stew with merguez sausage -  a bit salty and underwhelmingBurmese pork stew - nice tender pork with a high level of sweetness.  Served with eggs and rice, this is a great dish.Overall, I thought that all of the dishes here were decent or better, but seemed a bit overpriced for what you get which is the reason for 3 stars rather than 4.

The regular pastrami had absolutely no fat, and almost no pepper (what's the \\"lean\\" pastrami\\" like?). The sissel rye was halfway to white bread. No texture. The fries had a thick starchy coating. The half sours were fresh, but with very little salt and garlic. The potato pancake was beautifully cooked, but was not seasoned at all. The cole slaw was OK.

As a Millenia employee I have heard such great things about this burger place. My boyfriend has pretty serious allergies so when I found out they had gluten free buns we were excited. However what a downfall for a company that doesn't take allergies serious. Let's start off by saying the lines were horrendous. It seemed like there was 5 people working yet they just couldnt keep up. I even overheard a customer complaining that her bud light was actually magic hat. The taps were switched. But instead of finishing the line the associate switched the taps while we waited. We finally ordered our food and told the cashier about my boyfriends dairy and wheat allergies. The cashier was friendly but it seems the kitchen staff didn't pay attention. About 15 mins go by and they bring out our fries. I was so hungry I was appreciative they brought these out early... however by the time my burger came out they were gone. Poor time management on their part. My burger came out first and it was covered in sauce. Like too much sauce. I wanna taste the burger not a glob of sauce. My boyfriends burger was no where to be found. It finally came out and the bun was covered in butter!!! Hello? He has a dairy allergy. This could've really hurt him. Not to mention they tell us after the food arrived that they couldn't guarantee his guacamole was gluten free so he asked for slices of advocado instead. Those came out brown and old.  I was basically done with my burger and ready to leave and his burger still hadn't arrived so I looked for a manager. The manager blew me away with how rude she was. She literally cut me off mid sentence and told me that his burger was being re made and it takes time.... as if it was our fault they didn't note his allergies correctly. Not a apology or explanation for the time wait. By the time it came out I asked for a box to go. We will NEVER be returning to this restaurant again. Nor will I be suggesting Burger 21 to my clients or my co workers.  Also side note: they had over 5 associates working and they just seem like they are very slow paced and confused. I've seen short staff working at other burger restaurants and it's never took this long to receive food or food service.

When you have a restaurant that only makes 8 items you should have hem all worked to perfection by this point.Long wait, confused weight staff. It might have been a busy night as you were out of half the menu, but th food was just blah. Hint: in a sandwich, if your customer cant the fat  off them-self, the kitchen should cut off excess fat. There may be an argument for leaving some, but the brisket was well over 50% fat. Mostly tone down the grease. A customer who's stomach is heavy with grease. Came for the ribs and desert. You were out of both.(rewritten because a touchscreen and bifocals are not a good combination)"},{"name":"Holy Taco","address":"1314 Glenwood Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm more of a TexMex kinda girl, but that being said...those chilaquiles?

I've lived in Boulder over 20 years and I've tried most all the Asian restaurants. I've scaled that back in the past few years due to the cost of eating out, but yesterday I got a craving for Thai. I was heading to another place when I drove past Thai Shi and thought, ok, I know it's been here a few years, and I've never been in, never even check it on Yelp. So I pulled into Boulder Gas and pulled it up on my phone. The reviews sounded really good. So, I turned around and headed back. It was around 5:30 when I pulled in, by myself. The place was pretty empty, which didn't bode well for me, but it's summer and locals often eat later in the summer.  Many people are out hiking, walking dogs, etc. after work, so I didn't really give it much more thought. Me, I like to go out for happy hour and see what's what at places I've never been to. Still, customers came and went at a slow pace throughout my time there. I wasn't in a hurry, so I ordered some house sake, talked to the owner a bit, then read the menu.I was seated next to a younger couple. Turned out they are regulars, so I talked with them about what they were having and what to order. Unfortunately, I'm allergic to soy, I don't like coconut anything, and I don't eat raw fish anymore, so my conversation with the owner was way more helpful and than that of the couple. So, I ordered Unagi off the sushi menu and the house salad with ginger dressing to start. Figured I'd see how full I was before ordering more. The house saki was pretty good. I had it cold as I prefer cold sake. Not too sweet or dry. Quite smooth. The Unagi was really lovely. It's one of my favorites as it's so velvety and tasty when it's fresh, which this was. 2 pieces for $5 seemed expensive though, but I didn't complain. It wasn't a happy hour special. The house salad looked great, with crisp fresh veggies, but it was swimming in the dressing. Way too much dressing. Luckily it was all on the bottom, so I could control it better. Presentation was good.After that, I was still hungry so I looked over the menu again and decided on the scallop special. My waiter told me there would be about 10 pieces of scallops. When it arrived though, there were only 6 pieces of scallops and they were smaller than I expected. Still, it was perfectly prepared, but for $20, I would have expected more.The decor is a bit eclectic. The background music was American (I heard many familiar tunes). When speaking with the owner, she told me she is from Taiwan, which is probably why she decided to offer the variety of dishes she does. Her English is very good. Maybe she's been in the US a long time or learned American English in Taiwan? Who cares. She's a lovely person and that's what counts! My waiter was obviously an American though.Only 3 stars for now because when I got up to use the restroom, and I told the waiter I wasn't done yet, and he knew this because I had just ordered my main course, the busboy came and removed my sake from my table, which I wasn't done with. I complained to the owner and she brought me another serving, but I'm sure there were at least 2 servings left in the bottle. Oh well, I won't make that mistake again."},{"name":"Early Harvest Diner","address":"25 Broadway St","city":"Wakefield","stars":"4","text":"Very slow.

I also attend alot of Jazz concerts in the Boston area and am a former Saxophone player, so I know good musicianship and Jazz when I hear it.My numerous experiences give me a perspective which allows me to be fair, and I neither issue 1-star nor 5-star reviews for minor differences. So, to be short and sweet, I issue the following number of stars in several categories.1. LOCATION - 4 STARS - A bit far from Boston, but an easy drive.2. PARKING - 5 STARS - If there isn't parking on the street nearby, there's more than ample free municipal parking right across the street.3. OVERALL AMBIANCE - 5 STARS - Very lovely, intimate, upscale, classy, romantic, and not too loud.4. DINING ROOM SIZE - 4 STARS - Fairly spacious room in back to the left, plus a small room straight ahead.5. JAZZ ROOM SIZE - 3 STARS - Very small room with only several dining tables and matching chairs, plus other seating to the right against the wall. My guess is that it houses only 35 people.

BAR - 5 STARS - Trendy and hip, Chianti's attracts a very nice crowd in their 30's, 40's, and 50's. Sometimes 20-somethings show up, and they're well-behaved and appreciative of great Jazz.7. FOOD - 3.5 STARS - The food ingredients are of high quality, but the menu is a bit short and the food preparation could be better. However, the Food is way better compared to most other Jazz Clubs, with the exception of Scullers.8. SERVICE - 4 STARS - Service is timely and performed fairly well, and no one rushes you to leave after you've eaten. You may stay at your table as long as you like to listen to the great Jazz.9. PRICES - 4.5 STARS - Entrees are only a couple of dollars higher than usual, which is an incredible bargain if you stay for the FREE Jazz which I wholeheartedly encourage you to do.10. JAZZ - 5 STARS - The Jazz is all local Boston performers, but the quality of Jazz in the Boston area is very high these days. Better yet, Rich the Owner is a musician (bass guitar and stand-up bass) and knows good Jazz, and Chianti's is so nice that many of the great Boston Jazz bands love to play there.11. RICH THE OWNER - 5 STARS - As mentioned earlier, Rich couldn't be nicer or more accommodating. It's his attitude that stands far above other Restaurant Owners.12. OVERALL RATING - 4 STARS - The mathematical average of the above 11 categories is 4.3 stars, but since food is the single most important aspect of any Restaurant, the overall rating is 4 stars."},{"name":"Border Cafe","address":"356 Broadway","city":"Saugus","stars":"3.5","text":"Though not an authentic tasting Mexican/Cajun cuisine, Border Cafe is a great no frills place the whole family can enjoy.

But the space is tight.  I made a reservation 4 days in advance and they sat us at the \\"two party table\\" section which was against the wall and you are literally hands way to your neighbor.  I wanted to sit near the windows, where it was brighter and seemed spacious but it was no big deal.  The prices are pretty reasonable. Tapas style and interesting dishes, so we ordered like 10-12 small plates.  Steak tartare and ahi tuna crudo(?) was lukewarm.  I did not like that at all.  When you eat raw protein esp beef and seafood, you have to have it ice cold!! I think they make a line of plates out ready to go bc they seem to be popular dishes.  So it made my tuna really fish-y. On top of that, on the steak tartare they add marinated anchovies on it so it was a fish-y, vinegar-y, warm tartare..(ugh).  \\nWe had 2 types of bruschetta: the roasted red pepper and fig, honey blue cheese.  The pepper was good but the fig's blue cheese was overpowering, I couldn't taste the fig or honey.  However the bread they use for the bruschetta was reaaaallly good. Crunchy but chewy and soft when you bit into it.\\nI wanted a salad and when I asked the waitress what she recommended, she praised the thai peanut salad.  Omg, don't ever get.. it was disgusting. It was just raw cabbage with soy sauce. No acidity, sweetness nothing just salty cabbage salad.  We hated so much, I complained and had them take it off our bill (I have never done that before). \\nLamb pops were ok...they could of seasoned it more.  Raw oysters were good (no cooking involved tho, so better be good). Gazpacho flavorful and ice cold.   Fried oyster was good but could of seasoned it. \\nGrilled octopus with potatoes- the octopus was tender but the dish could of used some more salt and acidity.\\nI think we had a couple more dishes but I can't remember them.  That's how un-impressionable they were(no acidity, sweet, salty, spicy).  When we left and waited for the valet to get our car, we saw the two gentlemen that sat next to us, already waiting for their car.  I asked how their dinner was and they also thought the food was bland and unbalanced.

I stopped by after class to grab some food to eat and I was hankering for some good barbecue. Looking at all the offerings around the areas, I was reeled in by the pictures of the mac and cheese, ribs, brisket, and the other sides they had on display. They had a special going for $8.95 that day that consisted of a pulled pork sandwich with two sides. Before I had a chance to decide what I wanted, the owner came to the window and greeted me very nicely, offering me a sample of the pulled pork that was in the sandwich that was in the special. \\nAs I took a bite of the pork, I noticed that they had no equipment in their cart to even make a decent rack of ribs, let alone pulled pork. I didn't have the heart to say that the pork was mediocre at best, but I decided to go for the special anyway because of the pictures of the macaroni and candied yams that pulled me in in the first place. As I waiting, I saw that they had just pulled out containers that contained the food I ordered, heated it up, packed the sides into tiny, i mean TINY plastic containers, and plopped the pulled pork on the bun that was sitting on a griddle in a poor attempt to make them hot. Needless to say, I was disappointed. The macaroni and cheese tasted like congealed macaroni and cheese you buy in the store, only worse. The coleslaw had an strong almost wasabi like taste to it and I couldn't take more than one bite of it before tossing it away. The sandwich itself was mediocre. It reminded me of the sloppy joe's i used to eat as a kid. Did I mention it cost $8.95 for a container full of disappointment? Even if the food was amazing, the amount of food you get is just way too small. I could get a more satisfying meal at the nearby subway than here."},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I may have found my new favorite breakfast spot.

I'm pretty sure his mind was made up within seconds of looking at the menu. We had reservations for a Saturday night at 9:00.  The hostess was very friendly and sat us as soon as our entire party of 5 had arrived.  Upon seating us, the server came over and from the second she took drink orders to the second she dropped the check she was personable, down to earth, and professional.  The atmosphere was whimsical and original.  It is definitely an underground, hip, season and food conscious gem hidden in Harvard square. Drinks around the table included the Mango Martini, Granny Takes a Trip, Soursop Fresca, Orange Dream and beers. The Mango Martini was by far the favorite of the night; thick, strong and perfectly sweet, this baby went down easy.  Please mind that the orange chunk at the end of the toothpick is NOT a piece of fresh mango, but rather dried, candied mango.  The other cocktails were also good and I would also recommend the Soursop if you often enjoy gin.  For appetizers we started with the buffalo cauliflower and the smoked chipotle BBQ spare ribs.  The Cauliflower was delicious and tasted exactly like buffalo chicken, expect better! They really nailed this one on the head.  The spare ribs were also fall off the bone fantastic.  There was quite a bit of fat, but that wasn't a problem for most of us. The chipotle sauce with chopped fresh scallion made me want to lick my fingers (but I didn't, I held it together).  For dinner, the birthday boy ordered the short rib lasagna and enjoyed every bite with an ear to ear grin.  I ordered the Mussels and Frites with a side of saut√©ed fiddleheads.  The Mussels were fantastic and the red broth they were served with was salty and sweet and exactly what my mouth had watered for when my eyes read the word 'mussels'.  The fries were nothing great, but were obviously the perfect side to dip in the broth.  I have never had fiddle heads before and these little buggers were delicious.  I can only describe them as similar to broccoli rabe, but more full of flavor.  They are only in season a few weeks of the spring/summer, so the fact that Beat Hotel had them available, made me need to get them.  My friend ordered the Earth Bowl with free range chicken, and while this isn't my cup of tea, it was pretty flavorful.  The chicken was perfectly cooked; skin darkened, and meat juicy.  The veggies and pilaf were spicy and every bite was a slightly different adventure fort the taste buds.  The other two diners at the table ordered the Prime Hamburger and both were very happy with their decisions.  I believe they both got the burger with cheddar, but personally I would have tried the gorgonzola for some added flavor.  For dessert, the five of us shared some sort of red velvet, coconut cake.  When it arrived, we all sang \\"Happy Birthday\\" to the birthday boy and after a ton of \\"action shots\\" of blowing out his candles, we dug in. I am definitely planning to come back to Beat Hotel and trying more things on the menu on a date night. This place is totally worth going back to."},{"name":"The Butcher Shop","address":"552 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Came to the butcher shop with my boyfriend and parents for a nice dinner 8 pm on a Saturday. We had a reservation but this place is small so when people sit and don't get up - a reservation doesn't matter. The hostess did her best to make us comfortable during our wait and after 30 minutes of waiting eventually made the group of people sitting in our reserved space get up and go to the bar which was very nice of her. We ended up getting a ton of meats cheeses and antipasto to share. They were delicious and our waiter was very nice. It's when it came time for the actual dinner is where I am unfortunately knocking this down one star. Holy salt. I have never been somewhere that they were so liberal with salt - ever. Not even Chinese restaurants. The salad tasted of only salt that my dad and I actually had to send ours back and ask for one made without salt. I got a veal chop for my meal and same issue the amount of salt was stinging my mouth. Same with my dad's steak. My mother and boyfriend both got a special pork dish and seemed to have more luck with the amount of salt on their meat. It was a little disappointing as you go somewhere that prides itself in their quality of meat and to have it masked by salt was unfortunate. The outstanding service we experienced from the waiter and hostess and the great atmosphere were enough to not let the salt ruin a wonderful night"},{"name":"Salt & Straw","address":"2035 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I can't even believe how amazing this place is! It gives my favorite ice cream place back home (Grassroots in CT) some serious competition! When I looked and saw all of their locations (4 if I recall correctly) had thousands of reviews and 4.5 stars across the board, I knew I couldn't leave Portland without trying it out. The service here was absolutely amazing! We got lucky and showed up at the right time, because there were only a few groups of people in front of us, but after we finished eating and were leaving, the line was literally out the door. While we were in line, an employee came out from behind the counter to greet us and asked if there were any flavors we wanted to try. She helped us from that point on, following us through the very short line giving us samples until we knew what we wanted and placed our order. I must've sampled 6-8 flavors to decide on the four I wanted in my flight ($9 for 4 golf-ball sized scoops, as she described it). There were a couple of others that were good, and many I didn't even get to try (I couldn't sample everything they had, could I? ), but here are the four amazing flavors I ended up with: cinnamon snickerdoodle, roasted strawberry coconut (vegan),\\nfreckled chocolate zucchini bread (yes, with actual veggies in it), and pear with blue cheese! I felt pressured to make a choice and stop tasting things, not because the server was pushy or seemed annoyed or anything, just because we finally made it all the way to the other end of the counter closest to the register while tasting things along the way, and I was worried about my choices, until I sat down to eat them. I really enjoyed them all! When I saw green fennel and maple listed, I was sure that would be a scoop I'd get, then ended up with others that delighted my tastebuds even more. I'd go back, again and again!There weren't many seats inside, but luckily we did snag two at the end of the picnic table, so we were able to sit and savor our flavors.

Each and every piece of food was made with the freshest ingredients imaginable and cooked to perfection. I love dim sums so much I fix them at home all the time. These had the taste of home made goodness. Albeit with ingredients I haven't tried before - talk about shark fin pork dumplings and fried shrimp balls!! Heavenly.

And nothing screams excitement like an all you can eat sushi experience.That's what I thought at least.  Even though they offer appetizers, pad thai, general chicken and other dishes all included in the buffet price, nothing had flavor to it.  Nothing but the sushi that is and it wasn't a good flavor, trust me.  The Pad thai had no lime or peanut flavor to it, the appetizers were dried out and meh.  I didn't try many of the other dishes because I wanted to focus on the sushi.  I kind of wish I stuck to the other bland dishes because the sushi tasted bad.  The salmon salad tasted funky, like the mayo went bad or something.  I know it's harsh to judge a place based off of one bad thing, but if you've had bad sushi, you know as well as I do that it basically ruins everything.  Not only that, but I had to force myself to eat the spoiled sushi, or else I would have been charged for wasting the food.  It's like in Anchorman where Will Ferrell had to eat the cat poop.

Fresh, tender and flakey and all of the Indian, African and Portuguese flavors combined perfectly. The fish sauce on the side is not to be forgotten...we added it to our rice and it was delightful.

We walked at first into East is East, and the server offered to show us upstairs to Chai Gallery. She gave us a brief overview of the buffet service, desert, how to order drinks, and the cost. She showed us to a seat, where we were able to enjoy live sitar music, followed by live music of some other oriental guitar/lute like instrument I wasn't familiar with, but was still just as beautiful.First of all, I have to say the decor here is phenomenal. I grew up in the Middle East and this is the first time since moving to BC that I have experienced a place that felt 'authentic'. Designed after elements of the Silk Route, an ancient route of trade that connected Asia to the Middle East and Europe, the gallery is a feast for all the senses. Sight, sound, taste, touch, smell. The food was phenomenal, and the chai speciality drinks even better- a lemon ginger chai with brandy, and a darjeeling chai with baileys. \\nThe only complaint I would have was that the seating wasn't as comfortable as it could have been- we were sat on a bench that didn't have a lot of cushioning.It was the perfect place to spend an intimate evening."},{"name":"Memphis Blues","address":"1342 Commercial Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Ah, memphis.

I got the eggplant/chicken parmigiana.  I would recommend getting just the chicken because the eggplant it came with was just a teeeeny bit lacking in cheese and sauce. But the chicken made up for it. Not to mention, I got a HUGE plate of Fusilli and a salad for only an extra $5. I'm not sure why people have not enjoyed the service there - i thought it was great.

Upside: there's a pretty good wine list (I also go for a vinho verde when available). Entrees: \\n- I had the Caldereida de Peixe (stew of fish and potatoes) which was a large dish, generous with fish, but bland. \\n- Those who got the Bife Atasca com Ovo (Steak with Fried Egg) seemed to enjoy that and thought the steak was nicely cooked.\\n- Big warning for vegetarians: this is not a vegetarian-friendly restaurant... there is just one entree available, off the menu, without meat/seafood, and it's a pretty simple veggie/rice dish The atmosphere is charmingly rustic-- there's a great lit-up patio area that should be nice once it gets warmer, and dozens of ceramic plates and pitchers lining the walls of the interior (although it was somewhat disappointing that the plateware for food was plain and generic). Our server was well-meaning but unattentive, though we didn't need to wait to long for the food itself.

The rolls we ordered were really great as well- the Kentucky roll (how could we resist something so silly?) and Paul's Roll (because I love fried rolls).\\nI am really surprised at how excellent Social Vinings was- the mixed, negative reviews for this spot had me worried, but service was good, the food was really fucking amazing, and I'm looking forward to my next visit.

Maybe there was an issue in translation with their computer or something, who knows. Anyway he was extremely nice and apologetic and promised there would be a free burger correctly made the next time we came in. And there was, both of them! The buns are a little sweet, meat is good sized and well proportioned to bun. Everything is really fresh and good. Their onion rings are better than Top Notch! Fries are also good, they're the thicker standard variety not usually particularly crispy but also not soggy. The prices are good, especially for the abundance of food you get. The kids meal fries are the regular sized fries, too. The playscape is pretty awesome, but I wish it were entirely enclosed for the younger kids. All in all a great place with good food and employees who own their mistakes and fix the problems."},{"name":"Border Cafe","address":"356 Broadway","city":"Saugus","stars":"3.5","text":"The food is good.

My favorite is the Salted Caramel ripple (can't remember the exact name) but that one is a bit of a crap shoot as sometimes when they scoop it you don't get much of the gooey bits so it's kind of like vanilla.  :-/  And sometimes you do and it's kind of like heaven.  My other favorites are May specials: Dandelion sorbet with wildflowers, (awesome!) and the Wildflower honey with ricotta walnut lace cookies.  They offer samples and I always try at least three knowing that I'm going to order the salted caramel anyway.

I'm not an egg roll fan, so my friend went to town on them. He liked them. I ordered the beef noodle soup(PHO) and my friend, the Mee-Ka-tung(chow foon) for our entrees. This is when it became a really long wait. I almost forget what I ordered while waiting and looking around at everyone elses food and watching as the dinner crowd rolled in. My friend got his entree first, then 15mins later mines finally came out. Now, I am aware this is not \\"technically\\" PHO, but let's be honest, it is! I'm Cambodian and I know we eat it the same way. Along with your big bowl of PHO, you're suppose to get your plate with the green veggies/beansprout fixings and Hoisen and Saracha sauce. Those sauces should pretty much be at the table at all times if you're gonna call yourself an Asian restaurant. What I got was a minuscule square-like bowl with a sad portion of soup, a plate with a pinch of beansprouts and a lime wedge, and NOTHING ELSE! I became all confused. This can't be my meal? But it was. The soup was ok, I was getting over a cold, so my taste buds were not at their prime. At that point, I was already over it. My friend liked his entree, but he likes everything that's ethnic, so I really can't take his word for it. It looked good. Overall, I'm disappointed. I get that you have to recoup your expenses from being closed for so long, but something has to give. You moved into an area full of broke hipsters who want it THEIR way. I just wanted it the old way that it use to be back in Revere, with the same price and same portions. And please, don't ever forget the Hoisen sauce again."},{"name":"Pig Floyd's Urban Barbakoa","address":"1326 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Love it! Wonderful food and service!

It seems to be missing it from top down. We arrived and went to the bar. The entry and the dining room looked great...then we went to the game room. We ordered drinks which were good. It must have been happy hour or something. Drinks were $3 each for a Jim Beam and a named brand vodka. Then we went on a search for a game card....None of the card stations took cash. All 4 were not accepting cash. We went to the front door to purchase the card. The gentleman was accommodating but far from nice. He was discussing something with an employee when we arrived. I told him I'd like a game card, he told me how much and we left....no hi or thank you or have a good day. This is the first point of contact so you would think it would be someone hospitable. The game room was just  bad....games down EVERYWHERE!! From the old horse race game that was dismantled and left to die in the room to the water game in the back right corner that had no water and was left to rot. Many of the games dispensed wrong as well. I was amazed that the amount of tickets that dispensed (yes i know it's 2 points per ticket) was not near what it said to dispense in OVER HALF the games!!!The floor was filthy with debris as well. The management was present but seemed oblivious to the needs of the guests and walked around as nothing was wrong...kicking paper and debris as they marched around.The bathroom smelled like urine.

Please note the guac here is not what you are probably used to - but its worth getting.The dinner items were good but each item either hit it out of the park or was a big swing and a miss. The good:\\nThe enchiladas, tamales and flautas were really well done. Each of them were well seasoned and tasted as good as they looked. The rice was tasty.The not as good:\\nI thought that the taco was pretty bland (and also sitting in a bunch of liquid that made if fall apart) and the chile relleno was a little tough.

The tables are well placed so you don't feel like you are being crammed into a cattle car.Our server was very prompt and helpful.  We started off with an order of the Cheese Crostini and the Duck Fat Potatoes.  I also ordered a Seelbach from the drink menu.  Each small plate was the perfect size for two and had amazing flavor.  My girlfriend even commented that the Crostini might be a perfect plate.  The potatoes were full of that duck flavor and along with the Gorgonzola Sauce made for another well balanced dish.  Of the two, I liked the potatoes a tad bit more.  For our main course, I had the pork chop and she had the short rib.  On the pork chop, the bread pudding was amazing...a hint of sweet and a hint of the chedday helped to balance out the savory of the pork and asparagus on the plate.  A truly great dish that I would order again.  For the short rib, the carrots were cooked perfectly and the pancake that served as the bed for the dish was a light, fluffy, and flavorful sponge for the sauce.  Also another dish I would order again.The meal was rounded out with another drink from the bar menu, a Moulin Rouge.  Again, another great cocktail that framed the meal perfectly.

I love picking  up a boule or a miche at the downtown farmers market on Saturdays. We have visited the brick and mortar location to pick up bread and have lunch.  We had the pretzels with beer cheese and I had a German.  The pretzels come out dark brown with huge grains of salt on them.  These are the best pretzels I've had by far with flavor on the crust and throughout the crumb.   I think we got some mustard or something, but all my brain was thinking was \\"beer cheese, beer cheese, beer cheese.\\"I had a German, which came with yet another pretzel, so I had to consume additional beer cheese.  I primarily ordered the German for the bratwurst. I am a bit hard to please when it comes to bratwurst, but I was very satisfied with the flavor of the bratwurst.  I have had too much bratwurst that sits on the plate staring back at me palely, hoping I'll slather some mustard on it to cover it up.The bratwurst at Easy Tiger comes out with a bit of a tan, which I like and the mustard complements the bratwurst, which could stand on its own.I have also had their croissants in the past and find them to be the best in town. I can get some satisfaction from the pale golden brown croissants that I find in town which tend to be a little too cake-like in texture, but I generally prefer not to. The croissants are a nice dark brown, with a reasonable amount of egg wash applied, very buttery, flaky on the outside, tender on the inside and not too large.\\nI wish I could get these croissants at places like Epoch and Cafe Medici, but alas a  Bakery That Shall Not Be Named seems to have infected Austin with the pale cake-like croissants that give me only marginal satisfaction.I am withholding one star, because I believe Easy Tiger could improve their levain bread.  I do love the levain bread at Easy Tiger, but it does not quite live up to the likes of Tartine in SF.  I do not expect this, but I would hope they could get a little closer.  I am not sure what it is, but something is definitely missing.

Well, I guess this just has to be one of those break all my rules about reviews review, because that's what we did. My wife and I went to the Summer Shack on 4th of July weekend specifically to try a couple of dishes we noticed on the menu online.  If you go, the restaurant itself is way in the back of the Derby Street shops. (Pass the \\"Whole Paycheck,'' take a right at the Apple store, if you get to Talbots, run... um, I mean you've gone too far.)  As I said, we sat at the bar which is a long, dark affair with a nice flat screen, and attentive bar tenders who are not territorial when it comes to service.  I can't tell you the number of times I've been to bar with multiple bar tenders, but once one picks you, the others avoid you as if by refilling your drink they'd start a corkscrew war. No so at the Shack. We ordered the oyster shooters and the Caribbean Crab and Fish Stew.  Unfortunately, we didn't specify we wanted the shooters first (Wouldn't you assume? But I suppose that would make an as... well you get the picture) so the stew arrived first.  It came with multiple chucks of fish in a light but spicy broth reminiscent of snapper soup in all but texture. There could have been more crab, but the title may be a testament to the stock in the broth as much as meat. On top were quarter sized versions of oyster crackers that were just okay.  Still, a tasty, aromatic dish.The shooters were each spicy, strong and containing a single freshly shucked oyster. We both kind of wimped out on the shot--it being a healthy amount of stolichnaya, and we wanting to taste the oyster.  The latter was a little disappointing.  It was fresh and briny good, but there really is something to the whole \\"month with an 'R'\\" thing. In the summer oysters are just smaller and less meaty.  They can still be good, but too many times you can get oystery dregs as much as a full animal.  Depending on the price, you might want to wait till September.We had our two dishes, we were satisfied and were about to go, when one of the specials, the fresh wood grilled sardines, caught my eye. In a word they were marvelous.  As we ate them, I could image sitting in a cafe in Nice or maybe Amalfi.  Crispy skin, lightly charred with a hint of wood smoke, they came topped with dots of fresh, rustic tapenade and were served over a pile greens drenched in good EVOO. Fortunately, there was an excellent and diverse selection of wines by the glass, samples of which are bartender was more than willing to let us try. Again, we were there for just a couple of dishes, and we found an even better third.  The menu over all is broad, as other yelpers have noted, for good or for bad.  But I would be confident that whatever the Summer Shack does, it's going to be pretty good.  Heck, it's Jasper White. Back in the day he had the only decent seafood restaurant in the whole city of Boston. But that history is better saved for another time.

Their rice balls are filled with shiso kombu and a semi-spicy salmon."},{"name":"E J Cabot's","address":"282 Cabot St","city":"Beverly","stars":"3.5","text":"Give me an \\"E\\" -- ECCLECTIC!\\nGive me a  \\"J\\" -- JUST RIGHT FOR BEVERLY\\nGive me a \\"C\\" -- CONVENIENT\\nGive me an \\"A\\" -- AWESOME SPECIALS\\nGive me a \\"B\\" -- BRUNCH\\nGive me an \\"O\\" -- OPEN LATE\\nGive me a \\"T\\" -- 'TINIS ARE GREAT\\nGive me an \\"S\\" -- SCRUMPTIOUS FOODWhat does that spell? An interesting, if abbreviated brunch menu, great draft selection -- not huge but unmatched in the area, and decent prices.I actually have never had lunch or dinner here, so I can't speak to EJ's aptitude in those areas, but I have had drinks here once and brunch here twice, and those were both good experiences. I find that there are particular things about this place that draw me in, and they're never the same things...The first brunch the big draw was the Bloody Mary Bar. As someone who takes her Bloodies with literally a smidge of horseradish and a splash of lemon, I'm not sure why this excited me so, but I'm a sucker for anything unique or different, so my mom and I gave it a shot. It was as good as I could have hoped and they have a gigantic selection of fixin's for those that are a bit more bloody creative (and to my British friends, sorry for the foul language).The second brunch the draw was convenience. Not a spot in sight at Red's in Salem, a visible line waiting outside at the Ugly Mug, Atomic was packed and I didn't even need to drive all the way to North Beverly to know that Depot Diner was going to be a zoo. So my boyfriend and I went to EJ Cabot's. Seated immediately, good, quick service. As much as I want to pout about the brunch menu being too small (it typically has about 5 things on it)... I can't. I love that it changes. The first time I got a breakfast burrito and it was outstanding, and this time I got a breakfast flatbread (shoulder shrug - it looked good), which -- EVEN THOUGH it didn't specify eggs over easy and I HATE eggs over easy -- was still DELICIOUS after i carefully cut out all of the runny yolk. The night out for drinks, the draw was the Downeast Cider on draft. Helloooo! It's so much better from the tap than the can. We came with a group of 5, and became a group of 9 without any hassle or irritation from the waitstaff, which was nice. Drinks were reasonably priced and our bill was modest for a night of drinking. Service was inconsistent -- one bartender could NOT be bothered. She gave us decent SERVICE, but her attitude was just blah. The later bartender was much more social, mixing up unique drinks and engaging with us until we shut the place down. Overall -- great place for brunch because you can always get in and it has a little summin' summin' for everyone. Enjoy!"},{"name":"Flower Child","address":"11721 Rock Rose Ave, Ste 120","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The Flower Child is a very upscale healthy dining choice in Austin.

The first time it was not so busy so we had great service, and got a lane right away.However, last night we had a not so great service. I was told 30 mins for a lane, and we waited over an hour. While we waited we went to the restaurant bar (not the smaller bar by the lanes) to get a drink. We were three of five people at the bar. The bartender walked around and kept telling us he would get to us, but he didnt seem to be doing anything. After waiting 15 mins he finally got us our beers.Once we got our lane, it wasnt working and we had to get them to reset it. The lane next to us was leaving and left a table full of dishes that were there for like 30 mins. No one was coming by to bus them.We got our lane working and kept pressing the call button to place food and beer orders but no one ever came. Then the lane next to us went down. The lady came over to tell us not to bowl right now becase we could hit the guy at the end of the lane inside the ball return. Luckily she was a server so we placed an order. They only way we got her to place the order was because she came over to tell us not to bowl. Otherwise who knows how long we would have waited. They finally cleared the table next to us, only because they had to make room for our food.We had to wait over 30 mins while they worked on the lane next to ours, luckily we had the food to eat by that point.Kings is a great and fun concept. Bowling, good food and beer!!! They really need to work on the staffing and service though. They are not planned out properly to be able to handle the amount of customers and requests right now.And find bartenders that are willing to help people, instead of being more interested in the football game on the TV!!Overall I had a GREAT time last night, but that was because I was with great friends who made it a fun time."},{"name":"Beat Brasserie","address":"13 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"The free music makes it loud when it's playing.They won't seat you until your entire party arrives so don't make plans with slackers like we did.A couple of their draft beers weren't available because they weren't pouring right.

The Tuna Tartare Tower, was my favorite thing of anything we ate there. For a woman, it would make a nice little meal, and I would be happy to eat that any day. The top is tuna tartare with some sesame oil mixed in--perfect. Then there are layers beneath that: avocado, mango, crab, and some vegetable, I think it was pickeweed. The layers are best eaten alone, because each has a unique flavor to enjoy.The fried shrimp was too sweet and a bit bready, but okay. The crab cake was a waste of otherwise delicious crab. They mixed it with a not-so-good tasting mayo sauce that just ruined it, as crab cakes go.My halibut was overcooked, very sad. My friend's Alaskan king crab Leg was great with lemon and garlic butter. Yum.The desserts were huge and we were sated, so we skipped them. It seems that the best things to order are the crab and the Tuna Tartare Tower (as if I didn't mention that dish enough). :)Very nice atmosphere, perhaps just a tad bit stuffy inside if you're a young energetic type.

Everything was spectacular.  We were a party of 8 which is the minimum requirement to rsvp for this meal and I feel is the perfect amount of people for the size of the table.  There is also a $200 deposit and it is $50 a person but it's so worth it in my opinion.  They also require a 72 hour advance notice for the preperation time a meal like this requires.     The meal is set up in the brewery room which makes for such a cool vibe!  While the restaurant itself can get pretty loud during busy times, the brewery room is a more relaxed and quiet environment.  The way this is set up is family style where they bring big sides of everything for everyone to share. Included in this meal was a baby lettuce salad, vegetable crudite, mac and cheese, roasted golden beets, beans with kale and bacon, and an entire pig!!!  There were many delicious desserts to share as well.  We had three kinds of sorbet, three kinds of ice cream, cheesecake, key lime cake, chocolate cake, a root beer float with some cookies!  If pork is not your thing, there are a few other protein choices offered.  I am considering getting the duck next time.  This was a meal to remember!"},{"name":"Southern Kin Cookhouse","address":"500 Assembly Row","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time tonight and the food was delicious but the service was quite a let down. We arrived at about 5:00pm for dinner and were immediately seated- only about 8 other people were in the restaurant. However, nobody came over to us even though there were plenty of staffers walking around. We ended up waiting at least 20 minutes before a staffer walked by and was surprised nobody had offered us so much as some water yet. He was quite friendly, apologized, took our order, and said that our waitress would be over shortly. No big deal, it's an easy oversight to make! My food then came out quickly but my order was wrong. At this point, I still had not seen my actual waitress, who I was told would be someone named Carla. When she finally came over, it could not have been more clear that she had no desire to be dealing with us. Very uncomfortable! It is unfortunate that this place left such a terrible taste in my mouth when the food is so good! Certainly not the place to go if you want a little southern hospitality!

The waiter claimed that they were better than those you'd find in Nawlins. Sadly, they weren't quite cooked through. To be fair, we didn't let the waiter know until after we'd finished. He said that he could have fixed it for us. I had cornbread (yum) and the yogurt and fruit with granola. I really enjoyed the granola - it tasted fresh and not at all like the processed crap that some places try to serve. My friend had the tofu scramble which was pretty tasty (and we're not even vegan and we still liked it!). My other friend had the smoked trout and bacon hash - it would have been really delicious but it was so beyond salty that it totally overpowered all of the other flavors. I still love it here though - our waiter was fantastic, the ambiance was great and we had a good time.

Because nothing else sounded appealing.\\nNothing we had was very good. The Nachos were made with some cheap-ass, salty, Santitas Chips you can buy at WinCo. This had some cheese sauce slathered over them, along with some tomato and onion sauce (I won't go so far as to call it Pico-De-Gallo, because there really weren't any noticeable jalapenos or cilantro in it), and some old-ass chili was slimed over it all. Sides of sour cream and some flavorless salsa rounded it off. A big plate, but completely concerned with quantity and speed, sacrificing all quality standards.\\nThe Potato Skins were forgotten somewhere in the kitchen.\\nThe wings tasted like there was some cheap-ass frozen chicken sticks that were drizzled in their special sauces. They were chewy on the inside and crunchy on the out. Gross.\\nFinally, we alerted our waitress about the potato skins and she explained that they were left on the hot plate, so they needed to make another order, which would take 2 minutes.\\nThe Potatoes and Cheese were not quite what we expected. Not exactly potato skins, they were cut finely and drizzled with what appeared to be real cheese. An attempt at quality, but ultimately nothing special.

Not sure by everyone is rating it so high. All the right ingredients are there, but the food lacks flavor and soul. They use good quality ingredients, but the flavor lacks depth and complexity. It feels like they dumbed down the flavors for a population that doesn't handle heat well? Doesn't make sense because not all Mexican food is spicy, but it usually is flavorful. I gave it a chance even after they brought out the chips and salsa. The chips are store bought and the salsa is thin, soupy, full of tomato seeds and was flavorless. We ordered beef enchiladas (half red and half green), a small Azteca soup, a taco al pastor, an an order of sopes - one chorizo, one beef and one al pastor. The enchiladas and sopes were bland overall. Even after dumping the extra jalape√±o and habanero sauces we ordered. The food felt under-salted. The al pastor was decent and more flavorful, as was the green enchilada sauce, but just barely. Finally the Azteca soup was missing salt and lime.

Just run of the mill $4-for-a-half-gallon coleslaw. Parents split a ribs/chicken platter, I tried some just to try. The ribs and chicken at least taste like ribs and chicken.

The crab cakes are straight up amazing.  Lots of crab meat, some bread crumbs (?) and pure goodness.Their stews are gigantic, so my table only ordered 2, the mariscada and the cod capixaba.  The mariscada came with a gelatinous gravy that was mostly unnecessary.  The mussels had a fair amount of grit in them.  The plantains were a nice, slightly sweet touch.The cod dish was mostly the same thing, with salted cod, which is delicious, and eggs.  The stews themselves are sweet from coconut milk, seafood broth, onions and tomatoes.  It's hearty with vegtables, but light because the broth is still a broth, and not gelatinous/starchy gunk.1 stew is certainly good for two meals, as long as you provide some extra rice on your own.  Some of the seafood choices may taste a little fishy the second day, but the salt cod keeps perfectly.To top it off, the juice bar is refreshing and interesting.  I tried the pineapple mint and the blueberry/mango/passion fruit.  Of the two, the blueberry one was tastier, and so very easy to drink.  The pineapple mint drink was also great.  It was a little frothy, and the mint is quite strong so it's not something you would gulp."},{"name":"Habibi Kabob Grill","address":"2451 S Hiawassee Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Great service and definitely great food, prices are reasonable, totally a must try place when visiting Orlando!, I'll definitely become a regular costumer"},{"name":"New Taste of India","address":"1901 SW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Their tikka masala is disgustingly sweet.

Atmospherically and feng-shui wise, MC is one of the more unique places I've visited.  The two angled walls of this triangular store are comprised of huge windows that allow you to gaze at the historic Hollywood Theatre directly across the street.  The large open floor plan, high ceilings, and dim lighting create an ambiance that is at the same time spacious and warm. Two authentic wine barrels support a lengthy wooden table surrounded by stools; it would be cool to huddle around if you had a large group of people.  There's also plenty of tables and chairs and a couple awesome leather low-rider couches. Although you may appreciate large plates of disgusting bar food from time to time, you will not find them here. The small plates of fresh made food are healthy and inspire a \\"higher-standard-of-eating-so-I-don't-die-from-too-many-cheeseburgers\\" mentality. The owner, Anna, is extremely attentive and caters to your every need. Although MC isn't a sports bar, Anna will encourage folks to have her put their games on her flat screen, (direct TV).

We got there on Thursday at 1:30PM and were planning on leaving at 7:30 the next morning. Call us crazy but nothing gets in the way of seeing Solo, Wambach, Rapinoe, Morgan, Krieger and team live!Anyway, I just yelped a restaurant because we were freaking starving with no lunch and breakfast having been eaten 10 hours ago. I decided that Tasty and Sons had enough reviews for us to check it out and I'm SO glad we did because the food here is fantastic!! Even better was the fact that we got there JUST in time for happy hour! And forget what some people say about the meal size, the happy hour portion was perfect! At least for me it was...Prices below are indicator of happy hour ONLY!I ordered: \\n- Radicchio with parmesan reggiano vinaigrette ($5)\\n     * Blew me away!! It had this flavor that's very familiar to me and yet not over powering. Usually radishes are bitter but the way they made this salad completely took that bitterness away and what came out was more floral, semi-sweet and crunchy. Definitely a must have!\\n- Saut√©ed Spinach with sunny side up egg ($3)\\n     *A bed of sauteed spinach with a sunny side egg on top. A little too salty for my liking but it didn't take away from what it was trying to convey... a super simple (but good) dish.My friend ordered:\\n- House Bacon Burger with smoked bleu cheese ($5)\\n      * I didnt try this being a veggie and all but she said that it was one of the best burgers she's ever had. It was a full burger too. Not half a burger, not a slider but a full man burger... definitely worth the 5 she spent on it and according to her, super juicy, super flavorful, had thick bacon (not that super thin crap) and melted blue cheese.and we shared:\\n- Vanilla Bean Panna Cotta with fresh oregon berries & grappa ($4)\\n     * This was another item that just elicited a huge taste explosion in our mouths. At first, my friend was hesitant in ordering a dessert but I didn't listen to her and ordered it anyway. IT WAS A. Freaking. Mazing! I love Panna Cotta and had my fair share of them but this was by far the best I've had. It was a simple vanilla bean and what I think might have been a lychee flavored infused water on top under a bed of berries. Delicious! I can't say this enough. Melts in your mouth.

Visited on a Sunday morning and our party of doedoes, including myself...It was daylight savings and we ALL FORGOT to change the time of our watches and showed up just a tad bit early for our reservation.  Oh GOSH!  The wait was going to be long, but long and behold, there was a table that opened up in the bar area and really just saved us from an hour wait and with nothing to do in the area unless we head several blocks down.These are the places that need to pop up more in the Miami area!  I wish, I wish more Public Houses open up to the ever changing crowd from where I live.Ok...brewery...of course I grabbed a sampler.  Every brew was delicious and just hopped perfectly.  But the one that stood out the most for me was the Pumpkin Ale!  Had to have a full pint of it!Time really wasn't on our side on our first visit to C&L.  Once we ordered, we noted that other parties that were seated and ordered after us were receiving their meals and leaving while we still waited for our food.  The staff were extremely apologetic and comped a side of biscuits for us.  Now to the food - Biscuits and gravy - small biscuits, about 4 to the order with a nice peppery touch and a really tasty thick gravy.Croissant -Doughnut - NOT TO BE MISSED!  This item really caught our attention...how in the world can the combo of flakiness of a croissant and the sweetness and bite of a doughnut put together into one not be liked?!?!?  All I can say is go try it!Double Stack Pork Burger - This was probably my least favorite.  The meat patties were great, prefectly blended ground pork, but what wasn't that enticing was the really dry bun that it was served on.  The bun was literally soaking every last bit of saliva that I have in my mouth and had to take a sip of beer after every bite.Chicken and Waffles - If you like a little spice in your life then a little sweetness, these are it!  Thigh meat chicken, breaded and fried to perfection, dipped in their hot sauce and paired with some cornbread waffles.  A full meal all in one plate!  Even dipped in sauce, the chicken still had a nice crisp breading to every bite.Brunch was good, but I'm going to give it another try to see if I can bump them up another star, maybe try different items.  The whole wait for our food left us somewhat on our toes, but I want to give C&L another chance next time so that they can redeem themselves, offer more efficient food service and add a final star to my review for them.  Because their food is pretty exceptional...  Lunch and dinner will probably be my next adventure to C&L.C&L is extemely packed and parking can be somewhat difficult if you don't get there early.

Let's order a ton of stuff on the menu & everyone gets to try a taste of everything. And anything I love, I order a 2nd plate for myself if I cannot do with just a few tastes. Plus, this allows for me to still eat plenty, my friends to eat items I am allergic to & still everyone is happy & can try things they like & maybe even try something new they have never eaten before. Saltyard is perfect for an evening like this.My friends & I came here recently (5 of us total) with varying tastes, but still similar enough for this strategy to work. What is great about SY is that they have plenty of wines (by the glass & bottles) & a great speciality cocktail menu & a full bar where you can get just about anything you might want.We were given Paige as our server, & she was phenomenal. Personable, attentive, made sure every dish was free of tree nuts for me (she checked each dish with the chef & made sure he was aware) & was sure all water glasses, wine glasses & cocktail glasses remained full.  She laughed with us & our crazy table & made great recommendations that were amazing additions to the dishes we knew we wanted.I started with a cocktail - the Whiskey, Tango, Foxtrot - just the right balance for me of sweet & tart & a kick in the pants from the whiskey. Loved it so much, I had two (but who is really counting, right?).Now let's talk food: (reminder, there were only 5 of us)\\n--Roasted Beets - I used to hate beets. This changes recently & I cannot get enough of them if they are done right. SY does them right. The vinaigrette was the best part of this dish - so light & refreshing.\\n--Bruschetta pimento cheese - You cannot go wrong with pimento cheese, but this was one of my least favorite dishes. Not for any other reason than we ordered so many amazing dishes, this just did not stand out enough. But it was delicious.\\n--Deviled farm eggs - These were so good, we had to order a 2nd helping. Creamy yolks with the crunch of the pickle, saltiness from the bacon & that spicy kick in the pants from the sriracha.  Please, bring me more.\\n--salmon \\"poke\\" tacos - Okay, I cannot speak to these as I could not eat them, but my friends LOVED them & they were very pretty & topped with caviar.\\n--Crispy Brussel leaves - stop the presses. I have to try this one at home.  A special for the night & recommended by Paige. Also, ordered a 2nd helping. Brussels sprouts roasted as individual leaves with a sweet & sour flavor. I will try this myself because I cannot live without it.\\n--Roasted cauliflower - Nutty, tangy, served in an iron skillet. YES!\\n--Shrooms on toast - Another throw away, although my friends ordered a 2nd plate. The shrooms were delish, I didn't need the rest of it.\\n--Georgia white shrimp \\"NOLA bbq style\\" - Served head, tail, shells on. Succulent, packed a punch, full of creole spice. Double the size & I would order as an entree (had a little spoon bread in the middle)\\n--Grilled petit filet bone in - The mushrooms made this dish, but the meat was cut too thin for me, thus making it hard to cut & chew. Still flavorful & yummy.  Not a favorite.\\n--Pan-seared scallop - Had to skip due to allergies, but very pretty. \\n--Charcuterie Plate: pine street market saucisson sec, ghost chili salami, duck ham - All 3 were winners!  I think it would have been a better selection had we also paired it with cheeses, but I'm not complaining.\\n--Grilled lamb loin - I will order this again - Lamb makes me happy, but succulent bites atop a luscious puree with a wonderfully spicy kick. YES.\\n--Smoked pork empanada - Also delicious, but I was sad there was only one since we were sharing.  They should make 3 mini empanadas. This is definitely a Southern empanada as it was BBQ with a sweet sauce and pickles served with it.\\n--Chocolate nemesis - I mean WOW. Flourless chocolate cake with orange & pomegranate - I needed coffee & a glass of milk. This is a must order dessert.\\n--Apple pie fritters - My picture did not come out, but these were little zeppoles (Italian donuts) topped with apples and a caramel sauce. Yummy, but nothing in comparison to the cake.Overall, this was an amazing dining experience enhanced by the service.  My biggest complaint here is the space.  They pack the tables & chairs in like sardines.  Not only so you get jostled by neighboring tables & chairs (any time someone gets up to go to the restroom, gets up to leave, etc), but it is very easy to over hear other conversations & you can end up fighting to hear someone at your table.  The servers have easily learned to navigate, but the customers are not so lucky.  I was bumped a lot. I think SY needs to consider removing a table or two in the back to make it a bit more friendly."},{"name":"Chuy's","address":"7913 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4","text":"Amazing food atmosphere and service.

The menu is super schizophrenic, even the interior of the restaurant is kind of like, \\"um, what? What is happening here?\\" that being said, it really is pretty good. \\nThey offer valet, but there is a garage that typically has spots if you keep going past the valet. \\nWhen you first walk in, there's a large bar and lounge area on the top floor. It appeared that there were also some private rooms on that level for events. There is a set of stairs that takes you down to the dining room. There is also a random private room down there, which is strange to sit near because the sound from the room echos down the hall right into the open seating area. \\nThe ambiance in the restaurant is great. Dimly lit, candles in the tables, decor is nice, and it has huge vaulted ceilings. \\nThe service we had was adequate. Our server was also handling the private room, so she was a little overwhelmed. However, there were many times that she was just nowhere to be found...particularly when one of us wanted another drink! That was the one thing about the service that was kind of frustrating. Don't you want to sell as many $12 cocktails as you can?? The cocktails were damn good, too! \\nThe menu, as I said before,is all over the place. Steak, chicken, pasta, edamame, sushi, sandwiches. I think they could benefit from pairing it down a little bit. I had a ravioli something or other and the pasta tasted like it had been pre-cooked and then trown back into boiling water right before serving. It was watery, but undercooked and the filling was super onion-y. Maybe not a problem for some people, but I hate onions and wasn't expecting that flavor in a butternut squash rav. My husband has the sushi and was impressed. I think I'll probably get sushi next time!\\nThe main thing that was bothersome to me, however, was the number of children at this restaurant. To me, it doesn't have a family friendly vibe, but there were a ton of kids for 8-10pm on a Saturday. I believe I saw a kids section on the menu, so maybe the are trying to be amity friendly, but it was kind of off-putting to someone trying to go out and have a nice, non-yelling-kid dinner.\\nI will likely go back and give them another shot, but my initial impression was kind of \\"meh\\", particularly for how pricey some of the items were. It's not expensive, but it's not cheap, either.

Ordered the pate de campagne, also known as the country pate, which is what I asked for when I ordered it only to be corrected by the overly made up waitress who was only missing black rimmed spectacles to emphasize her looking down her nose at us. Listen, lady, I lived in Europe for 5 years. I don't need lessons on the romance languages and pronunciation. Pate, fine. Wine, fine. Maybe I should not have gone in with such high expectations but the staff really needs a lesson in hospitality. In an economy such as the one we are just getting out of, it really blows my mind when employed people in the restaurant industry act like they have 10 other things far better to do than find out what your order is and if you are enjoying it.

Seeing that they had a $2.50 a plate special was probably the main reason that I ended up here. Having not tried dim sum in Richmond, I wanted to see how it compared to dim sum experiences in other cities.The restaurant from the outside looks sizable and when you walk in, it is very spacious and well spread out. I got to the table and was given an order list to select the items I wanted. It was a bit early as it was a little after 10 am on Sunday, but I wished the service was a bit slow. After the order went through, dishes slowly came to trickle in.Some dishes were better than others. In particular on the bad side were several of the dumplings which stuck to the bottom. On the good side was the pork congee, beef balls, Chinese doughnut look funn rolls and egg tofu. Overall, the dim sum was a mixed bag. Some were good, some not so much. The ones on the bad side were served warm rather than hot as is preferable. Total tab came out to a little over $26 dollars for 9 plates which is pretty good considering the locale. I would rate HKYK a 3.5, but am rounding down because of the slow service. As for how HKYK compares to dim sum dining experiences elsewhere, I would say it is one of the better restaurants I have dined at,. This is primarily based off its selection.

As I stare at him having a looong conversation with the ladies next to me the hostess notices and asks me if I need a spoon for my soup.  Everything looked good until I picked up the sandwich and noticed they have griddled the bread and swiped it with a couple tablespoons of butter.  Then I notice they have also put mayo on the bread and the chicken salad is shiny with olive oil.  Believe me, I love all of these but combined on one sandwich is a bit oily not to mention very unhealthy.

It was just good. They put \\"taco\\" in the name, so tacos are what we had, and I've had better. Much better, in fact.I had the goat, pork, and catfish, and the catfish was the best of the bunch. That was my safe choice, too, and I really wanted the other two, both of which came highly recommended, to be great. They didn't really even have much flavor until I doused them with the hot sauces on the table.The beers were good, but that's because I'm good at choosing beer, although it always bothers me when I order a $6.50 microbrew bottle and the server doesn't even offer a glass for it. For $6.50 I want to see and smell my beer. Fairly minor quibble, but a glass should always be offered.Ultimately, you can get much better tacos at half the price at any one of a hundred ATL taquerias.

This is really one of the closest places to where we were and only a few blocks walk so we decided to try it out. It was a very rainy day so everyone was huddled inside in their pretty small dining area. I could see the atmosphere here being really nice on a sunny day but unfortunately we didn't get to experience it. The place was hipster to the max, and their \\"cool\\" just didn't come off the right way to me. The servers were nice but we had to wait several times to get our servers attention once we were seated and also when we were waiting for the check. Since the indoor seating is so small we were actually seated at the same table as another group. It turned out to be in our favor since we were seated with people from the band the Wildfeathers (their set had been cancelled at a concert we had just come from)! Very cool coincidence and really the best part of us happening to be there that day.To order, we started off with a couple of beers. I liked the pale ale that I got although I can't remember now which one it was. To eat I got the garlic sausage on a pretzel bun. This was seriously the messiest hot dog experience I've ever had and I would've rather just eaten a ball park hot dog than this. I think they were trying to jazz it up with the bacon jam but this just fell a bit short. Overall, I like the ambiance although it was just too chaotic and the food wasn't good enough to justify a return visit. If you are craving a sausage and beer then I would recommend going to Banger's instead since they have the ambiance but the food to back it up as well."},{"name":"Istanbul'lu","address":"237 Holland St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"This is second time here it gets better and better Fantastic Turkish Food and Turk l dont like every Turkish restaurant in state but this place is realy good"},{"name":"Zaftigs Delicatessen","address":"1298 Worcester St","city":"Natick","stars":"3.5","text":"Great food! \\nWent on Easter (2014) and it was super busy but we waited about 15-20 minutes and it was well worth it. \\nDelicious dishes and the appetizers were yummy.

I have eaten here numerous times for business and personal occasions. It is such a charming, feel good experience type of a restaurant. It is located in a more historic house with delicate decor and appeasing character. The wine choices are abundant but not overwhelming including several true Italian options. I have had all the anitpasti options on the menu and you really can not go wrong with any of them. My all time favorite dish is the Tagliatelle Verdi Alla Bolognese. The house made spinach tagliatelle is a great twist on the typical bolognese dish. I also recommend the chicken cannelloni, as well as the seasonal gnocchi dish. The meat specials are always a brilliant option and a large portion. For dessert the cannoli is a personal favorite. The cream is too die for. Not only is the food great, but the service is exceptional. We normally request Hanna to be our waitress as she is good at making everyone enjoy the experience from start to finish.

The shop was very packed on Sunday morning as expected.  There is ample seating inside if you want to hang out, with several very large communal tables taking up most of the space and some smaller seating tucked into the corners. It was pretty loud and bustling and though seats were opening up fairly frequently I decided to just get some beans and an Americano to go. When I first walked in the door I noticed their selection of Lucky's Doughnuts, which looked absolutely delicious. I was unaware that they served doughnuts and was pleasantly surprised. I knew I couldn't leave without getting a couple. After stepping into line, I found that though it was pretty long, they had it moving really quickly. I wanted to grab three different types of coffee for gifts and found that I had to choose fast. I let three people go by me before I could finish reading the selection of doughnuts and beans. I ended up picking three random varieties of beans along with 2 doughnuts: a salted caramel glazed old fashioned, and a chocolate chip cookie dough. My Americano came up in about 10 minutes. It was delicious and bold just like I like.  It's definitely in my top 5 favorite coffees I've had. We ate the doughnuts in the car before eating lunch. They were by far the best I've ever had, even better and Blue Star here in Portland. So pillowy and warm.

We fell in love instantly. You walk in and see a clean, simple menu where you order by choosing a base (banh mi, vermicelli, pho) and up to two meats (pork, chicken, shrimp, nem nuong, pork belly ~GET THIS~, tofu or short ribs). The cashier could tell it was our first time, so he showed us instagram pics (love how he's so with the times) and we ordered. Originally I ordered the pork and shrimp vermicelli but the cashier tells me that the nem nuong and pork belly go really well in the vermicelli so I completely changed my order (although I was hesitant) and my friend after hearing this ends up ordering the same thing except with rice. You receive a buzzer, grab a seat, grab utensils/water/condiments and bus your table when you're done. When we took a bite of our food, we looked at each other and knew this place was legit. Being from the Seattle area, there are tons of Pho restaurants that never fail to disappoint but this place ranks above all (and my friend is Vietnamese who has had his fair share of Viet food). They give more than enough noodles/rice and the perfect amount of veggies (bean sprouts and cucumber), which btw is pickled beautifully. Also, the noodles is definitely fresh because I've never had noodles that has had the right balance of softness and good chew (I thought I was being weird but my friend agreed). I'm so happy the cashier recommended the nem nuong and pork belly because it is FIRE (or delicious, whatever you prefer). The edge (or top?) of the pork belly has this perfect crunch that compliments the soft fat/meat well and is cut for the perfect bite. And the nem nuong is marinated very well and isn't too chewy or soft. Honestly everything about this dish was perfect ~ perfect amount of deliciousness in a bowl. It's like my mouth was salivating more and more after every bite. I wish this place was in Seattle because it would definitely be my number one go-to Viet joint. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in the area. PS. this place is so cute and hipster (although I'm starting to notice this trend in Portland lol). From the water in silver dispensers, wooden shelves displaying sriracha/hoisin sauce/dishes, to the wooden tables with mini succulents as well as the succulents hanging in the restaurant."},{"name":"Cuon - Vietnamese Street Food","address":"600 SW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Vermicelli was delicious and authentic.

We went for New Years Eve and there was a 4 course menu only, to which you could add oysters.We ordered the oysters and when we had 6 left they brought 1/2 of the first course onto our tiny table where it barely fit.  When they took the oysters they dropped the second 1/2 of the first course. They tried to take our plates twice and then and they brought the first 1/2 of the second course with our first course still there.  Then they brought the other 1/2. We had eaten half of a scallop each when they asked if they could take our plates and immediately they brought the next course, at which time I told them we weren't ready for it yet.  2 minutes later they tried again and I told them we still weren't ready.   It was only 8:30 at this point so we'd been there about 30 minutes.  They brought the next course and when they did one minute later they brought dessert spoons, and said \\"I don't know why I'm bringing these but they told me to\\".  I asked our server if we were meant to eat the quail with a spoon and she said no I just don't want to forget to bring you dessert spoons.   I think maybe they finally got the hint when they took our quail away and asked how the food was and I said it was filling and we'd need a second before dessert.    I know it wasn't just us, because the table next to us was asked if they wanted new plates for their quail and they said no it wasn't necessary they just weren't ready to eat it yet- because the other courses came so quickly, to which the server responded we're just trying to make sure people get to their plans. (these WERE our plans) Then when they were eating dessert someone attempted to take their plate and the man said \\"no we're not done\\"  to which the busboy said \\"sorry that's my job\\".    At no time during the meal was my date asked if he'd like another drink- he had one the entire time, although I guess one drink in an hour is fine.I hate reviews that only talk about the service and don't include the food 1/2 of it seemed too salty and some others tasted like perhaps they forgot salt altogether.  I'm not sure I can rate the food properly though because I didn't really have time to enjoy it (or not).   Some highlights were the risotto and the 'dinner and a movie'.

First the roast beef sandwich is great.  I have had it a few times and its as good as any other around.  Service is great to everyone there is nice and they actually bring your order out to you.  For the seafood I've only had 2 things there.  the fried haddock was ok but the shrimp OMG I'd have to say the worst I've had in a long time.  the funny thing about the shrimp is they were definitely not fresh.  The were the precooked ones you would get a the stop and shop that they just breaded and fried.  You know that chewy dry cooked and frozen 6 months ago flavor.  Also they really don't season their fried food.I'll go back for the beef but thats probably about all."},{"name":"Blazing Tomato Pizza and Pasta","address":"8145 International Dr, Ste 531","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"As they only sell pizza and pasta, they should have great tasting pizza and pasta.

The regular sushi and sashimi were also a solid option as well. The serving sizes of each were great for sharing, and since it's all you can eat if someone steals (a.k.a. eats too much) you can always order more!Another plus to this place is the great drink specials they offer.

It was a little rainy so we grabbed a spot inside at a table. The locals seem to have no issues going outside and sitting on the front porch, under the canopies or around the firepit. Yes, a firepit in June; I love it!  Since there was a dark'n' stormy on the HH cocktail list I had one of those first. Then I would grab a drink off the signature list as you get $1 during HH. My hubby went with a gin and tonic. We ordered the fried Brussels Sprouts, a hummus platter and my hubby got some honey mustard drumsticks. The fried BS were crispy and tasty. The aioli adds a different touch to them. The hummus platter was my favorite; the warm pita is a nice upgrade to the normal hummus plate.

I couldn't give anything more than an OK, which by the star ratings, should allow me to give it 3 stars.The 2 stars is because this place masquerades as a fru-fru french bistro, when in fact it falls far short. I arranged a birthday party for 12 on a Saturday night at this restaurant, and made the reservation 1.5 weeks in advance. My entire party arrived on time, 5 minutes before our reservation at 8:30pm. We weren't seated until 9pm. There were no apologies from the hostess, and they blantently seated a large party ahead of us.When we finally sat down, we asked for bread and order 3 expensive bottles of wine. 20 minutes later, all we still had was water. When the waiter eventually showed up, again with no apologies whatsoever, we were finally told that they were still baking the bread.The appetizer was...fine. But sadly, I don't remember what I had, it simply wasn't memorable. I remember the greens were very fresh, that's it. I ordered the breaded haddock for my main course. It was, again, ok. Slightly overcooked, and the accompanying vegetables were fine, but boring. Seeing as how it was a french bistro boasting traditional french fare, I took it at its word and ordered a side of  ratatouille, a french classic. As mashed potatoes is to an american bistro, ratatouille is simple, straightforward, and a mark of a good french chef. My ratatouille arrived, with what must have been a half an inch thick layer of cheese on top!!!!! Cheese??? I almost lost it, and I'm not even remotely European! It's one of few times I've been personally offended by a dish. If I wanted cheese on a french classic that doesn't have cheese, I could have saved a heck of a lot more money at TGI Fridays!We spent over $1000 that night, and we didn't get as much as a thank you when we were leaving.

Since moving in we've been twice and both times the results were consistently mediocre.  The first time we ate at EJ's, it was a Friday night and we had a group of 6.  The second time it was just 2 of us and we were there on a Wednesday night.  Both visits had similar pros and cons.  First of all, when you walk in you are immediately confused about what you're supposed to do.  There is no one to great/seat you, but there's also no sign that you should feel free to seat yourself.  Also, the dining room is separate from the bar, so you're not sure if you go in there if anyone will see you.  Once you stand there long enough looking like an confused fool, someone finally comes over and assists you in finding a table. Once you are seated, the serve is incredibly slow.  I understand that happens on a Friday night with a group of 6, but the Wednesday night party of two thing was unbelievable.  We literally had to stop random servers to try and order.  Once he did get our food, it was very good.  I was very happy with the food for both of our meals.  The portions are great and the nightly specials are terrific.  Really, this could be 4-5 stars if you didn't have to beg them to order/get a check/pay them.

Seriously, I had to get out of the booth to remove my jacket. It was much too cramped. Mexican music played at high decibels was about the only attempt at ambience...except for a large screen TV showing a kayak fishing show. I thought it strange but not entirely objectionable.The chips and salsa came promptly. The chips were cold and tasted like a supermarket variety chips and the salsa tasted more like a smoky tomato sauce. I skipped them.I ordered chicken fajitas for lunch. The chicken was cut in large chunks, much too large to eat rolled in a tortilla. The chicken tasted like it had marinated for too long. It was heavy and smoky and didn't taste much like chicken. The onions and peppers cooked with the chicken were good. It was accompanied by guacamole, shredded lettuce, cotija cheese, rice and black beans. I would have preferred refried pinto beans but the black beans tasted fine. The fajitas were simply okay. But whether or not the value and quality met the $15 price is debatable.I do want to tell you that the hostess/server made visit worthwhile.

God knows this neighborhood needs places like this.  Food wise, the cook (owner?) knows how to mix his baking talents in with some traditional breakfast fare, so the food is really tasty, and the items are unique.  I had a special that was a pastry filled with leeks, carrots, and shredded pork, with a potato cake (hash browns) and two fried eggs.  It wasn't perfect, but it was pretty awesome.  My wife got \\"The Occasional Hedonist\\", a version of eggs bene.  It's a tart filled with onions topped with two poached eggs and hollandaise.  One problem with this meal was it's a little small.  I'd much much rather pay $1-2 more and have a side of fruit, or something. It's served on a big plate also, so it's just kind of lonely without a side.  The wife was not happy about this, and was jealous at my bigger quantity of food, meaning I had to sacrifice several bites.  What made things much worse was this: they served it with one poached egg, and said \\"the other egg broke, there is another one coming.\\" Not ok - did they really think that was the best way to fix the situation?  I mean, the food comes really fast, so they could have thrown away the good egg, kept the tart warm, and made two new eggs.  Whatever - but how sad is it to get a dish that is missing an egg - and then five minutes later to get a lonely egg covered in a bit of hollandaise on separate plate?  It's really sad - I think it's actually a criminal offense in Holland.  To add insult to injury, the second egg broke while sitting on the plate moments after delivery.  Like it just couldn't make it on it's own and died in front of us.\\nOh well, everyone drops the ball sometimes.  The bloody marys were pretty good, and the service was totally great (think the breaking up the eggs idea was the cook's).  So I'll be back, but I'll make sure to order a side with certain items, and hopefully all the eggs will arrive on the same flight.Also, there is outdoor seating now (4 big tables), and they have lunch items, and I think they might possibly be doing dinner in the future.

Once we were seated at our table, service picked up and was sound.Food: There are two major problems with Bravo. The menu choices are extremely limited. In addition, within the two categories, appetizer and entr√©e, the offering were similar. A couple of salad offerings, two fish offerings and two meat offerings were the extent of the menu.  I am not a huge portions fan however portions are tiny even by my standards. The food was served promptly and was well done. Here is why the tiny portions are a problem, they are just too tiny. Two minutes after we arrived home from the concert, I was in the frig making a sandwich. I thought maybe it was just me until I read a Yelp review from 2007. The writer's boyfriend promptly went home and started in on the Rice Krispies. Apparently it is a male thing that after eating a Bravo you need a second feeding.

I do wish the kitchen would learn how to grill their onions, though. Every time I go, I've asked for my onions to be grilled \\"well-done, but not burnt\\". Just about every time, they either burn them or the onions are practically raw (I think they were done right just once - and they were perfect!) other than that, the food is good. The value is also pretty good, as I can usually get two meals out of one entr√©e here. I've also tried the pastries from the store counter, and I really enjoy the baklava.

Their menu changes every season, with drastically different dishes that change per the ingredients each season as well.We started off the evening with the beautiful fall salad ($10) consisting of baby carrots, beets, tokyo turnips, fennel, and pumpkin. This was definitely very pretty and the beets and carrots were quite refreshing with the tangerine dressing.The roasted chestnut bisque ($9) was really good, rich, and creamy -- perfect for a crisp fall day. I was surprised at how rich it was despite it not actually being made of seafood. The apples were a nice touch as well, adding a little bit of crunch and texture to the soup.The butter poached Alaskan crab ($14) was quite good as well. Can't complain if it's swimming in delicious garlic butter and if the shells already cut open for easy access. The mushrooms were also a nice touch, I thought.The roasted beets with toasted pumpernickel, pine nuts, and salt spring island garlic goat cheese ($13) was interesting. To create this marshmallow-y beet, it was first frozen prior to roasting, leaving a slightly foamy and fluffy texture. I'm not huge on beets, and this was a bit different. I didn't hate it. After the appetizers, we moved onto the entrees, including the hand-cut pasta with sake steamed mussels, tomatoes, miso beurre blanc ($15). At first it seemed like the pasta was a bit undercooked, but actually it was just a bit dry. After coating it with more sauce it was better, but still a bit harder than al-dente. The mussels accompanying it were good though, and I liked the sauce.The ling cod with butter poached lobster pomme puree  ($18) was pretty good, with a slight crispiness on the outside and a soft inside.One of my favourite dishes that evening was the sous vide lamb with broccoli rabe, butternut squash, and spiced walnuts ($24) cooked perfectly at medium rare, resulting in tender and moist lamb. Sous vide has always been a fascination of mine actually. The power of science!The seared Baja Ocean Wise scallops ($20) were also quite good and a favourite. It was an interesting pair with the proscuitto and fig, which balanced the different tastebuds on one's tongue. The scallops themselves were seared perfectly.The famous Mosaic chocolate cake with layers of cake and fudge, was as always rich and delicious. A bit too sweet for those lacking a sweet-tooth, but nonetheless a delight. The pumpkin cr√®me br√ªl√©e was alright; I personally was not a huge fan of it, but my mother enjoyed it. I didn't like the custard being as thick as it was due to the incorporation of pumpkin pur√©e, but flavour-wise it was bang on with the fall flavour spices. Overall it was a very enjoyable meal at the Hyatt with good company and good food. The fall menu is definitely worth checking out with a wide variety of meat and seats as well as fresh fall vegetables to tie everything together."},{"name":"Doc's Motorworks 38th","address":"1106 W 38th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"It was very packed or busy on a Wednesday night.\\nThey host was very accommodating.\\nThe waitress made multiple trips for simple stuff needed.\\nMaybe she was new but I don't feel she was very efficient. \\nThe food was good but one of my friends got the same thing and didn't get hers until I was almost done with mine.\\nTiming was all off.\\nThe facilities though were in good condition.

I've never eaten at a real Italian restaurant where the candles were lit to set the mood and they had some hairy guy in the corner singing in front of an accordion player. I was slightly nervous going in. I wanted to fit in. (After all, I am hairless... ladies?)I thought maybe I'd be under dressed and the waiters would see right through my thin disguise, (that being my best Armani dress shirt that I only pull out for special occasions... ladies?) pegging me for a mere peasant instead of a frequent posh diner. But when I entered the front door of Don Francesco's, every concern didn't seem to matter any more and my sweater-less body relaxed. People were dressed somewhat casual, some in suits, but mostly dressed for a mild summer evening. I decided to take my best friend Marcus, who rarely ever smiles. He offered his usual two point frown when I asked him what he thought of the place. Knowing Marcus as well as I do, that frown was equivalent to two thumbs up from fat guy/skinny guy... you know, the movie guys, whatever their names are.Except for the lack of air conditioning, the place was immaculate. On a wall behind me, photos of world celebrities posing with Don Francesco himself. Anyone who was everyone from Liberace to Jean-Claude Van Damme had their mugs plastered on the wall of the small hallway leading to the washroom. The impressively handsome Italian man who was Don Francesco seemed in his glory beside each one of his famous guests. His smile as perfectly comfortable as a cannoli maker on a slow day... dressed in slick Italian fabric, his shirt collar open down to the center of his chest... a manly mane of thick hair screamed out \\"ladies\\" in every shot. A wave of insecurity flashed over me. I felt nakedly un-Italian.I cast aside my concerns and dove right into the generous menu. Appetizers and entrees for Marcus and me. I started with antipasto della casa, a beautiful mix of shellfish, cheese, eggs, artichoke hearts and olives. Though the entire portion would be considered cruel and unusual punishment if offered to starving children, the flavor of each morsel left a lasting impression of Italian culture on my palate. Before the main dish arrived, I had to take trip outside to cool off. On my out, I passed the accordion player and his lead singer, who was sweating harder than a Kenyan runner in the Boston Marathon. His eyes locked on to mine as I passed... wide as two cappuccino cup saucers... they begged for a break. I could only offer him a slight grin as I hurried to the comfort of the cool evening. He was on his own. Hopefully he learnt the importance of a body wax after that unfortunate night.When I arrived back to my table, my meal was about to arrive. For me, Rissoto Con Asparagi E Capesante (try ordering that without stuttering). It was an Italian rice cooked in chicken stock with onion, asparagus ragu, parmesan, and pan seared scallops. If you ever go to an Italian restaurant, order Risotto. If they're a good restaurant, their risotto will be to die for. Don Francesco's did it right. Every one of their scallops spewed a special blend of Italian spices and ocean nectar into my mouth.Marcus ordered a steak. He always orders a steak no matter where we go. When I asked him how his BISON STEAK WITH WILD PATH BERRIES was, he sneered and nodded. \\"I like my steak like I like my women,\\" he said. \\"Soft and Gamey\\". I had no response to that, but I think that meant he liked it. I did notice that his plate was cluttered with berries and what might have been gnocci, but I wasn't sure. Marcus is a human vacuum. The entire meal was gone before I could ask.At the end of our meal, we decided on a coffee instead of dessert. About halfway through our drink, I noticed that they accordion player had traded in his weapon of malcontent for a violin and was traveling the bar with no other than Don Francesco himself! The traumatic duo went from table to table, singing to couples, entertaining the crowd. Don Francesco carried a tune well. He sang everything from some random Italian love song , to Dean Martin's That's Amore much to the delight of the sweltering crowd. Overall, Don Francesco's place is a truly romantic, nostalgic Italian restaurant that even though slightly overpriced, is the closest thing to real Italian dining I've been to. Worth every fazule! On the way out, Marcus commented on my new position at Yelp.com and wondered how many more of these \\"work dinners\\" he could come on. I told him that each one would cost him a smile. I haven't heard from him in days."},{"name":"Salt & Straw","address":"2035 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is a tourist trap, but one that I willingly walked into multiple times on my recent visit to the Portland area. Don't be put off by the long line - the wait is well worth it. With fun, inventive flavors that you'll be pressed to find executed better anywhere else, Salt & Straw shines. The staff was extremely friendly and gives you the opportunity to sample different flavors until you find one you like. The only drawback to this is when you end up behind the family that wants to sample every single flavor there before making a decision. In my separate visits I tried the chocolate fudge brownie, lavender, olive oil, and blue cheese & pear. Yes, I felt like a fat a**. But it was good. Real good. One note - I guess if you already know what flavor you want, don't feel like waiting in the long line, and have no qualms with downing an entire pint, you're welcome to pick up a pint from their fridge and line-jump. I never did it myself (couldn't bring myself to consume an entire pint limited to just one flavor when I could get a couple scoops of different flavors to try), but noticed a couple of people wisely doing this to circumvent the wait.Return trips to Portland won't be complete without at least one return visit to Salt & Straw."},{"name":"Rita's Caf√©","address":"224 Cypress St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Oh my god I love this place.

There's a long dark beer hall with bar and then you come out into this gorgeous outdoor patio with picnic tables, surrounded by the tall buildings and just lit with this glow. Loved it. So relaxing.My husband had the pastrami and it was delish, on homemade bread, and a latte. I just had a chocolate croissant and bought a pain levain to take home. I actually saw Andrew Curren upstairs, he smiled and opened the door for me. His business partner greeted our table and gave us a bunch of great info about how they grind their own sausage and how we should get the corned beef next time because it was heaven. We said we would. A few minutes later he came back with a sample for us and OMG was he right. I'm not even a corned beef fan, but that shiznit was good good.The guy at the next table had a huge pretzel and a cold mug of beer. He looked very happy!

We had a 6:30 reservation, and were seated immediately. Even though it was the last Friday of Restaurant Week, the dining area never seemed to be completely filled, but the bar area was pretty bustling. As I mentioned before, it seems like they are still understaffed; the entire dining area seemed to be managed by at the most three servers, which didn't feel adequate for dinner service.I had a really hard time making up my mind, but I wasn't really enthralled with anything on the RW menu. So two of my friends ordered from the RW menu, and Pete and I got dishes from the regular menu. I started off with two cuts of cheese, a Morbier (semi-soft with ash running through the center) and a hard raw milk cheese which was my fave of the two. Other appetizers were the escargot, the onion soup, and the garden salad. Everyone seemed happy, but I was hearing rave reviews about the onion soup.For our mains, I had the short rib beef bourguignon; others had the grilled salmon, the rack of lamb, and the citrus and spinach risotto (RW menu). The borguignon was melt-in-your-mouth delicious, with amazing flavors, very rich and deep. It was a big portion, enough that I could take some home with me. Everyone else enjoyed theirs as well, even though the risotto threw me for a loop - it was flavored with orange, when I was expecting lemon, which seemed like a strange pairing with the creamy risotto.We shared some desserts; the chocolate mousse, cr√®me brulee, and the giant profiterole. And was that thing giant! The desserts were very well executed. Overall, I really enjoy the food here, but it's the service and atmosphere that kind of throws me off.

My boyfriend got a giant chocolate chip cookie, I got an almond croissant and an iced coffee. This was about $10.I've had their pretzels at the farmer's market, and their bread at Whole Foods, so I knew everything was probably acceptable, and thought my mind would be blown getting it fresh. My croissant had an extremely tasty filling, and not too much, just the right amount. I love almond, so I was happy with it. My mind wasn't blown though, the pastry was slightly overbaked to my taste. My boyfriend eats everything basically, and inhaled his cookie before I could ask for a taste. I'm assuming it was good?Now for the biggest disappointment...my iced coffee was not good. It tasted burnt and bitter and the cups they put them in are very flimsy. The lid didn't fit very tight and dripped coffee all down the front of me while we strolled around. Naturally I didn't realize I was leaking coffee down the front of my white shirt until it was too late. I trashed the lid and thus, no more leakage. Service was ok, the girl running the register was nice but a bit overwhelmed at the moment due to it being pretty busy, and it seemed her coworker may have been new and not much help.

I can honestly say, everything we ordered was so very delicious.  Having already tried out Tasty and Alder, expectations were high.  Tasty and Sons delivered, without disappointment.  We started with Chips and Dip.  Sounds like \\"been there and done that\\"... but you haven't if you haven't tried them from here.  The chips freshly sliced and fried with a dip that was out of this world... sure it was onion dip.... but not Lipton's.  It was so yummy.

Muqueca is a typical food of the South West of Brasil, and even back home, we are all aware  that any good restaurant in the region will have a waiting line. So all was good.This time we started with mandioca frita and carne de sol (fried yucca and fried dried meat) a traditional appetizer in Brasil. Even tough none of the ones I have tasted here are even closer to what we really have have back home, they are still a fair sample of what the 'real' things is.For dinner we ordered Muqueca Completa which is a very simple yet delicious, light and healthy food made of a mix of seafood, cooked in its juices, with lots of cilantro, tomatoes, onions, a little of urucum or dende oil. In Bahia - Brasil differently from Espirito Santo, this dish receives a generous amount of coconut milk, so keep in mind that this restaurant is owned by a great cook from Espirito Santo, so, no cocnut milk here...The seafod is carefuly set on a special clay pot covered with all the seasonings and covered and left alone to cook over open fire. When it starts to boil we add the shrimp and let it cook for a few more minutes and voila....from the oven all goes straight to the table  - on the same clay pot which was cooked. It is served with white rice and pirao - or a type of a  'gravy' if you will -  made with the juices of the muqueca and yucca flour.For drinks they have Meia de Seda  which is a mix of wine and condensed milk served on an apperitif side glass....sweet and different taste but very usuall in small town in Brasil, or, if you are feeling adventirous...the famous and traditional Caipirinha, the traditional Brasilian drink of course a Brazilian flan for desert.The place is located in Cambridge and parking can be a drag sometimes, but there is no doubt that it is worth the 'sacrifice'.If you are adventurous and loce seafood this is a place you must visit.

The chips are overcooked and super greasy. They need to pull them out of the deep fryer a few minutes earlier. The tacos are yummy but need a little extra sauce..the pork taco is especially good..beware the habanero salsa though.

If you have a good server it's not problem but otherwise they won't even mention the different sauces or the choice in shells.  The Poblano Rellenos was tasty..actually really enjoyed it.  And FYI Sopapillas should be larger and puffed up so it's a thin shell that can be poked and opened up..then let the customer pour honey inside it..also the whipped cream they served with it was good but had been whipped into what was more a sweet butter.

Holly helped me in the days leading up to the event with my rather large catering order. She was incredibly patient (as people changed their orders and numbers changed).

My total was just short of $5, which... for a medium seemed high, but OK, I like supporting local businesses, and I know that store space on Woodstock can be pricey, so sure, $5 for a medium coffee, why not. I handed over my card, and the woman taking my order laughed - literally laughed - and pointed to their card telling me that they won't run cards for less than $5. OK, I get that, it's against the agreement with your processor, but... we can still be friends, First Cup! I dug in my purse for $5 (I don't carry cash, OK?) and found it, the woman sighing all the way. I thought about not tipping, because laughing and then sighing when I tried to make sure I could pay her? But I found 4 quarters buried in my bag and did. Maybe ordering a mocha reminded her of a recent breakup, and that's why she was so unpleasant. Who knows, but I work in the service industry, I'm prone to forgiving more bad service than most people. \\nSo, we've covered that the service was bad for no discernible reason? Rad. Now onto the coffee. It was... burned? I mean, I don't make espresso at home or I wouldn't be writing this review, but I very infrequently get a burned mocha. Also, it was almost a third foam. Not whipped cream, but actual foam, as though it was a latte.

Getting a six-course meal plus wine pairings (ok, my dining companion and I split the cheese and dessert courses, so that's kind of like 5.5 courses) for $90 including tip seems like a coup.  My only complaints are a) the music was a touch too loud to have conversations w/ others at the table; b) the chairs are inexplicably small and uncomfortable; and c) the communal-dining aspect, while charming, becomes less charming when you realize you have to sit next to your dining companion, rather than across from them.  Honestly, it wouldn't be that hard for them to reconfigure the space for smaller tables.  I know, I know, it's the owner's prerogative, but I, for one, experienced more than a few awkward moments, since my companion and I (mid-20s) ended up at a table of much older and non-talkative couples.But for the food and wine, I'll definitely be back."},{"name":"Flats Handcrafted Flatbreads","address":"152 Walton St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"They have a friendly staff and clean place.

It's in the newly opened Ponce City Market and popular so expect a wait if you go - there were about 20 people in line in front of us. It took about 15 minutes to order so I didn't consider the wait that bad. Simply put if you don't like waiting for your food don't come here until the newness has worn off a bit.The menu is simple: Fried chicken, southern sides such as coleslaw, Mac and cheese, succotash and buttermilk rolls. You can order sandwiches, individual chicken pieces and even a half or whole bird. There's also some sexy-sounding sauces, like black pepper gravy and frim fram sauce, in addition to the basics one would expect like BBQ and honey mustard.Pricing is slightly higher than fast food. Sandwiches are 6, chicken pieces 1-4 and whole birds 17. Two people could eat for about 25 bucks total if you also threw in a beer (and they have a few to choose from).THE TASTE: So is it worth it to stand in line and wait for this food? I don't think so. I thought it was a solid three stars - food was nice, service was excellent, etc. I had a juicy chicken sandwich on lovely springy bread with the black pepper gravy, which I would eat again but would not go out of my way to seek out. Coleslaw was finely chopped and had a nice flavor. Mac and cheese has a blend of cheeses and is tasty. But in the back of my mind, I was thinking \\"This is just one notch above average.\\" Certainly not bad. If you want the best fried chicken in town though, this isn't it.

I mean, I get that they're doing small plates and I understand that quality trumps quantity, so this isn't to knock their entire approach to food. They're the experts, I'm the humble diner.

In this case, it is hard to beat sitting on the patio overlooking the tranquility and beauty of Deep Cove, especially on a sunny day. The food didn't really impress me, to be honest, but there wasn't anything overtly negative about it. I have to give them credit for accomodating my dietary restrictions as they were nice enough to agree to my request for an omelette when that wasn't on the lunch/brunch menu. My fellow diners were satisfied but not overly impressed with their meals, and the coffee was average.However, the service was great and, again, the location and atmosphere are pretty spectacular. I was here with family for lunch but this place would definitely have a very romantic atmosphere at sunset in the summer, and I would love to return for drinks and appies then."},{"name":"Sidney's Grille","address":"20 Sidney St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"2.5","text":"Revised 7/2/08:\\nSince I wrote the review  below (over two years ago!) a lot of things have changed.\\nThe Hotel at MIT is now Le Meridian\\nThe chef is gone, and so is the good food\\nand clearly the whole place is in flux\\nWord is that they are going to close the restaurant for a few weeks and completely revamp it.None the less, I am giving it three stars for KEN THE MAGNIFICENT BARTENDER!!!!!\\nGo on a weekday, get great service, and have a really nice time sitting at a clean, pretty, quiet bar.\\nJust don't make the mistake of eating anything.\\nThink Persephone....\\n-----------------------------\\n(old review:This is a kind of weird place.  It is the hotel restaurant at the Hotel at MIT, which is a fancy, but Doubletree place.  I'm including it in my food reviews, because the food is good, in fact REALLY GOOD (I'm still trying to figure out who the chef is- the exec. chef that is, cuz there are a bunch of guys cooking in there) and the menu is interesting, though sort of predictable, in an American fusion cuisine way.  But, no matter how funky, modern and fancy they tried to make it, it still feels like a hotel restaurant.  The linens are hotelly, the lighting is hotelly, and on Sunday the brunch screams HOTEL!\\nStill in all, my two year old daughter loves to go there in the afternoon for soup.  They treat her like royalty and I enjoy her leftovers.

It's small, seating maybe 25-30 people tops, dark, and with a feel not far from being invited over to a friend's home for dinner. A friend who also happens to be a phenomenal chef. And though you may not know all the other guests, by nights end, they feel like friends.Unlike other restaurants where you make a reservation and come whenever they fit you in, Beast does it differently and in a way that I almost wish others would try. There are waves of groups. We sat down at 6 pm, but so did everyone else there that night. When we finally finished around 9 pm another group was waiting outside for the same experience. When you're seated you're seated at a communal table with others. My wife and I got lucky and sat with a very eclectic, yet enjoyable group.You probably want to know about the food, right? Well for one thing, you don't get a choice with regard to what you're served. Everything is already decided before you arrive (and can be found online). The choice you do have is whether you want to do a wine pairing with it or not, we suggest you do.As for the quality of the food, it was phenomenal. From the watercress and leek soup, to an amazing charcuterie (foie gras bon-bon?!), pork shoulder, kale salad and more, everything was great. As I've learned, what separates the great from the best, is knowing how to pace a meal -- and they did it flawlessly.

We waited a long time and then his came out first. Mine came out about 5 minutes later, which was weird. I had ordered the fried chicken and while it was a nice big piece of chicken, unfortunately, when I cut into it, it was not cooked in the middle so I had to send it back. It took quite awhile to make another one, and the server was kind enough to bring over a little salad while I waited for it. When the new one arrived, the chicken was chicken nugget sized rather than the nice big piece on the first one. They comped it though so I definitely appreciate that.

We decided to have dimsum eats here because as I have heard that some dishes here are the worth the try and I did like the idea of checking off which dimsum you want and them bringing it to your table.We walk in and the place reminded me of a restaurant in Seattle's Chinatown, not exciting. We were neglected of services but then was apologized to afterwards, and still service was slow but lady who was dropping off dimsum dishes to other tables felt bad and was giving us phenomenal services.Before ordering we asked if there was Xiao Long Bao but since we weren't Chinese not sure if they understood what I was talking about.

The dumpling shell started to get stale and hard after sitting there and there wasn't much broth inside the dumpling as I had anticipated. The squid dish was good but can only hang with one piece after getting sick of the taste. The ShuMai was really good here, better then alot of ShuMai's I've had. The chicken feet was not my order... chickenfeet always looks scary on a table. The Spare Ribs was OFF THE CHAINS and SO DELICIOUS here, very suprised the flavor it consisted.

When looking for advice I sought out ultimate Yelp experts and Tasty n Sons was at the top of their lists - for good friggin' reason. The food here was literally the best food I have ever had in my entire life. (That's right. I said it. And I have had a lot of food and perhaps even more opinions about said food.)Holy crap in a hand-basket. Everything was beyond delicious and organic and unique and awesomely amazing! (ok... I need to stop my gushing and say something constructive here.... focus.)Our group of 4 arrived on a Tuesday for brunch and, though they were busy, we were seated right away. Our waitress was very helpful and willingly gave her opinions when asked, but her opinions were basically that everything was good... because I kind of think everything here IS good! We started off with the breakfast board, which lacked a description on the menu - probably because it changes depending on what is fresh. Ours featured yogurt with olive oil and herbs, chicken liver spread, house smoked jerky, bacon, a boiled egg, beets, hood berries, and freshly baked bread and croutons. Everything was so fresh and flavorful! Event the chicken liver - I'd never had such a thing and I was super skeptical, but it was like a salty delicious spread that greatly complimented the accompanying bread. We each ordered an entree and then the waitress reminded us that all the meals are served family style in the middle of the table. Did that mean we ordered less? Nah. That simply meant I got to try everyone's dish without asking - what a great scenario for a food lover like me! My dish of choice was the Polenta and Sausage Ragu, which was topped with mozzarella cheese and a fried egg. It was so creamy and smooth, yet perfectly paired with the sausage made of chicken and it was ah-mazing! Other dishes at the table included the Spring Vegetable Fritatta with mint and feta - topped with deep fried cheese. All of the vegetables were fresh and crisp. Plus, the mint added a new twist to a more standard dish. Someone else ordered an omelet that came with a full sausage link inside and asparagus. Super delicious! The only dish I wasn't able to try was the Shakshuka since my tolerance for spicy food is very low and I was warned by the other diners at our table. I cannot get over how much I loved this place. It was a perfect finale to a fantastic trip.

It has taken another 10 just to get refills. The other tables even have 2 servers helping them where we only have 1 extremely slow and forgetful server. This is absolutely unacceptable. I will not be returning to this Buffalo Wild Wings, nor will I be recommending it to anyone. There is a chipotle across the street we should have gone to. If this is the service on a Monday night I would not want to even imagine what it would be like on a game night or weekend.

The addition of some of the BBQ sauce livened them up significantly, but some effort should be made to produce a better base product.I also tried a sample of the brisket, which was fall-apart tender and very tasty.

This review is for the Cumberland outpost, the company's only (barely) ITP location, found in the sprawling Akers Mill Shopping Center at the corner of Cobb Parkway (Highway 41) and Akers Mill Rd. Cinco is one of the few businesses on the property to actually be located in its own standalone building.The restaurant is big and spacious. The building has two levels, a large bar, multiple dining rooms, and a nice patio. The interior is simple and contemporary. It looks like this place can handle large groups and private parties with ease. Reservations are available on OpenTable, so book online and earn free dining points.I'd passed on Cinco for years thinking it was just another Americanized Mexican chain. Yelp's three-star average rating (at the time of writing this review) didn't help either. Well, the first part is still partially true. However, I came here with a coworker for lunch and enjoyed my meal. Service was good too.At lunchtime, the restaurant was quite busy. Cinco has everything on the menu you'd expect: tacos, burritos, enchiladas, fajitas, quesadillas, soups, salads, even flatbreads and sandwiches. There are several different varieties of each. I ended up trying the fish tacos ($10.99) and chicken quesadilla ($9.50). In a nutshell, the food was simple, but good.There are at least seven different tacos you can order. The fish tacos come three to an order. The fish is tilapia and you can have it grilled, fried, or both. I tried both and can't say I prefer one cooking preparation over the other. They were equally tasty. The tacos are made with flour tortillas, a \\"tropical\\" slaw, and poblano mayo.The tortillas were soft and the ingredients were fresh, flavorful, and in the right proportions. I really enjoyed the poblano mayo. The fried fish had a thick, dark golden brown batter. This batter is thicker than I'm used to seeing on fried fish taco fillets. The batter had some flavor to it and it actually reminded me of the crispy fried chicken batter from a fast food chain like KFC or Popeye's. The grilled fish was nicely cooked and had a little pleasant spice/seasoning of its own.The tacos were served with Mexican/Spanish rice and black beans, which were A-OK. You can substitute charro (cowboy) or refried beans instead of black beans. The beans are topped with a bit of melted cheese.The chicken quesadilla was tasty. It's made with the same flour tortilla as the taco and filled with grilled chicken, cheese, grilled onions, and bell peppers. Sour cream and pico de gallo are served on the side. The cheese was the highlight of the quesadilla. There was lots of it and it was melty and delicious. The chicken wasn't bad either. Tender and savory. If you like quesadillas, you probably won't be disappointed with Cinco's version.While the food looked formulaic/generic/chain-like, ultimately it was tasty, which is what matters most.Kate was our server and she did a good job. She was polite and efficient. Most impressive was how fast the food came out from the kitchen. This restaurant is adequately prepared to handle a peak lunchtime work crowd. Kudos to them for that.I had a good experience at Cinco and would return. It seems like a worthy option for a meal, snack, or drinks before or after an event at the nearby Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre."},{"name":"Cuon - Vietnamese Street Food","address":"600 SW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Food was just okay.

The short of it is, if you're going in the evening you better pray to whatever god you worship that Armani is on shift.  That guy runs a tight ship, is always friendly, always fast, and always accurate.  You really could not want anything more from the experience when that guy is running the shift.On the other hand, there's another guy who runs evenings who is such a giant turd, I'm compelled to give this location a single star because yes, this guy is really that terrible.  He's high pretty much any time you go, the line will be wrapped around the building and even if there are only 2 or 3 people in front of you, you should expect literally a 20-minute minimum wait time( note that's a minimum, as in it ranges much longer) You'll also be lucky if the order is right.Take a look through the drive thru window sometime and you'd see why his shift runs so slow.  He makes his staff do all the work while he shamelessly stands in eyesight of the patrons peering through his bloodshot eyes at his phone, texting and doing anything but helping expedite the orders.  The one job he gives himself is filling the drinks, and he doesn't even do that well.  He hates waiting on the foam to go down, so he tops it out and slaps a lid on it, handing you a beverage that's easily 4-6 ounces less than you paid for.I really can't say enough bad about that guy, he is actually the worst fast food worker I've ever dealt with.  When he's on shift we go over to Wendy's or if my wife is just having to have Taco Bell, I'll drive down to the Polaris location instead, despite living right next door to this one.  The wait, the frustration, and the disappointment is too much.  I can get to Polaris and back by the time I would have gotten through his line.  I also occasionally get grill items tasting like cleaning solution from him, so that's another issue.Again, if Armani is on shift, have at it, otherwise avoid this location like the plague.  The potential of how awful your visit can be is heavily outweighed by how good it might be.  Save yourself, go literally anywhere else."},{"name":"Wonton Asian Kitchen","address":"1230 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"This new Asian \\"fast-casual\\" restaurant is meh. The food is just OK, no better than say Panda Express. The rice is not jasmine (or really bad jasmine) as it was not sticky at all, and eating with chopsticks was an exercise in futility. The beef was tasty, but for $10 I'd rather eat at a local New York style Chinese takeout or Pei Wei than here. It took 35 minutes from the time we placed our order to receive our order, which was a flight of wontons and a single Mongolian style beef. I get that they are still new, but they really need to work on their speed.The space is modern, and wide open, perhaps too wide open. They could easily add half a dozen tables, because there was a constant stream of people waiting for seats during a busy dinner rush.

Thankfully, they put us all at the same table, but the waitress was very hesitant to take our food orders while we were waiting on our last 3 people. We had some orders come out wrong and had trouble correcting them, since the waiter said they served something they actually did not (didn't know the menu I guess.) My boyfriend was never asked if he wanted a drink the entire time we were having dinner. We ordered pitchers of Sam Adams and they gave us Coors light (gross!). The pitchers were $20 each, and served 4 beers-- A glass of the same beer was $5.25, you do the math. \\nThey charged us $1 per cupcake \\"cutting fee\\" for the cupcakes my friend brought. ($24 total. I understand that they would discourage outside food, but that's outrageous, especially when no cutting was involved.)\\nWe waited nearly an hour from end of dinner until our lanes were open to bowl, however, they didn't bring our bills for dinner in a timely fashion, and we almost lost our reserved lanes because of it.\\nThey didn't want to let anyone start bowling until all 20 of us went to the bowling counter at once (even though some of us were still waiting for our dinner bills, and realistically, you try getting 20 buzzed adults to do anything in unison). The way they explained their payment system before we started bowling was NOT what they told us when we actually went to pay.And finally, all 3 lanes we were on had some sort of technical difficulty while we were playing. Two of the lanes finished way before the 3rd, but they wouldn't give me back my credit card that I had placed down for the lanes until all 3 lanes were done bowling, making it difficult for 2/3rds of our party to leave.I would NEVER go here again, and I'm actually embarrassed to have brought 20 of my closest friends to such a sucky joint."},{"name":"Atasca","address":"50 Hampshire St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"It's amazing how the owners of this restaurant have transformed a bland office builiding storefront into a charming Portuguese oasis.

I'm not a fan of roast beef, so I havent had it there, but their seafood is fabulous and fresh. The fried oyster dinner came with huge fresh oysters. The amount of oysters was so big the dinner could be for two. I've also had the scallop roll twice. There must be close to 12 scallops on that thing! Its so big you cant even eat it like a sandwich. But quality over quantity. Not only are the portions generous, the taste is phenomenal. The batter is light and is the perfect ratio to scallop. The taste really comes from the freshness, though. The scallops are cooked to perfection, never overdone."},{"name":"Holy Taco","address":"1314 Glenwood Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"The food is great but the service sucks, perhaps our server had a bad day and is reflecting in her attitude making our first time in this establishment be our last."},{"name":"Jester King Brewery","address":"13187 Fitzhugh Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Cool place...in the middle of no where. Definitely a brewery to hit up for a casual afternoon.Its easy to potentially drive right place this entrance, since its nothing more than a dirt road on the left. If your car is quite low to the ground, you will definitely need to drive very carefully along the drive since there are jagged rocks and dips here & there. Once you get parked, there are two buildings up the hill. One is the a covered beer garden with a place to order stone fired pizza and the other is where they brew their beers.I ended up getting the pineapple wine as my first round since I can't drink beer. I think its a great idea that the Brewery has three different sizes to their pours (4, 8, 12oz) so you can try and a little of something new. At first sip the pineapple wine was crisp, tart but sweet & refreshing at the same time however, since I got a 12 oz pour and it was so hot out, towards the end, it became really tart & sour. Overpoweringly so. Next rounds I got their cider that was sweet & refreshing. I definitely preferred the cider and the rest of our party enjoyed their unique beverages. The building closest to the road is the pizzeria with lots of options for toppings and a few salads. They didn't have any gluten free crusts but they did let me know I could bring my own and they would cook it for me in the future (they;d only charge for toppings). It made me wonder how they would reduce cross contamination but I didn't ask. I got the caprese salad with prosciutto and balsamic on it. Everyone else enjoyed the shared pizza. There are also other bar taps by the pizzeria too.They give brew tours at 1pm, 3pm and 5pm. Air conditioning is available during the tour when you view the metal casks, which is a fun way to learn and also cool off for a few minutes in the summertime.Overall a cool space with a cool vibe but a drive from town.

Arrived early, 4:45 ish and were seated immediately at a little table in the back of the room.  I had my back to the restaurant, but 20 minutes later when I got up to go the bathroom, the restaurant has filled up.  On the walk to the bathroom, I lingered by the grilling station.  Chicken hearts, chicken livers, adorable mini octopus that are served in a light hot and sweet sauce, pork, beef, and vegetable skewers.  You order them as a minimum of two per item, and our table had an assortment. I wouldn't again have the chicken breast, because opting for the safe choose just turned out to be boring with all of the other options presented to us.  Backing up a little, our server, who was fabulous, suggested that we order everything family style, encouraged us to order a few things at a time, and to keep the food coming.  I could have eaten four or five orders of the pork bun, but its counterpart, the savory pork on the bone option, came as a sad disappointment when we compared it to the fluffy white pork bun. The laksa was amazing, the flavor so intense.  The boyfriend couldn't finish his with out crying, because he added too much of the flavor enhancing spice... again, our server had been fabulous and suggested that we just add a little before we saw how spicy it was.  He just dunked his heaping spoon right in, his laksa quickly darkening a few shades. The four of us slurped down drinking vinegars, I liked the black raspberry, and the traditional Japanese soda pops, including one that had a marble in the mouth piece. I was terribly afraid that my dining partner was going to choke every time he took a sip.  The green salad was our last order, I just couldn't seem to get enough food.  It had a juicy chicken, shrimp, peanuts, and a peanut vinaigrette (what salmonella?).  It could have just been the perfect touch of a great meal, but it was my favorite item that we ordered and I will be pounding on their door to get another one.  We paid with their at-the-table-debit-machines and I was delighted!  I have probably never been so happy to fork over $60 (the bill for the four of us was just over $100 and change, we split it down the middle) because of the cool machine.  We did have to go get dessert somewhere else, because we weren't even a little bit interested in any of the dessert options they had on the menu, but it was a great meal.

I've felt the service is always a little slow, but I'm patient in almost all cases (I don't get a refill in 30 minutes is really my line), so I'm more forgiving than most. I've always felt their pricing is on the high side, but I've seen worse. I basically only go here when others I'm with have their hearts set on trying it. And for the most part I always walk out thinking of the better options in the area.Yesterday workers at my shop decided they wanted to get TooJay's delivered (Doorstep Delivery). I was less than enthused. The only single thing I've appreciated at TooJay's is the french fries, but knowing it would be delivered by a third party, I already had to anticipate they would not be fresh by time I dug in, so I didn't even bother. So I looked at what else they had and decided on a sandwich and soup. I don't care for small portions, and on the website I saw options between \\"cup\\" and \\"bowl\\", and knowing their sandwiches are generally just large lumps of bland meat with not much for toppings, I ask for extra mayo. My worker doing the ordering has to round and round with Doorstep about soup, I have no idea why ordering that is an issue. The food arrives, I get a couple packets of mayo, and a whole bunch of mustard. Eh. I look at the \\"bowl\\", and it's TINY. I ask the delivery guy about it's size, and he agrees that it looks like a \\"cup\\" and not a \\"bowl\\"s worth. He contacts his Manager who says they cannot take it back and cannot refund. At that size and price, it simply is absurd to me. The manager at Doorstep says I have to contact TooJays. So clearly calling Toojays about this is pointless, we paid cash. So that means I have to make a trip in. There goes the convenience of delivery. I go in after work, taking the untouched soup with me. I walk in and ask to see the sizes. I am told \\"cup\\" is 8oz, \\"bowl\\" is 12oz. What I have still looks like 8 oz the counter girl looks underneath and says \\"no, this is a bowl\\". Pathetically small and overpriced is STILL pathetically small and overpriced. The manager comes out and just \\"no\\"s me. I didn't have a sip (not like there were many sips in it to begin with), and I simply didn't want it. And the manager has the nerve to tell me they can't refund me because Doorstep delivery gets the money (logic would dictate TooJays gets the money from Doorstep, it's not a charity), but he will give me a coupon for my next visit. A *$&#@&@ Coupon for my next visit??? Certainly it would be obvious I will NEVER order a single thing from TooJays after such a hassle because of overpriced smidgen of green water.

All this talk of Tiger's Tears made my want to cry for some. I had always overlooked them at places, not even knowing what they were. I noticed every review had talk of them. The \\"had to have them\\" meter turned to full blast... So I arrived at the restaurant on a Sunday evening with my boyfriend. It was dead when we walked in then it quickly filled up with more patrons. Almost a full house when we left.The menu was larger then I thought, a few pages of variety. So many items. It was temping to try the stuff I was familiar with like pad Thai, which they do in 2 styles but I refrained. We decided on the fresh spring rolls which are always my favorite. These were plump with three shrimp each, filled with vermicelli, veggies and mint. 2 rolls were served per order with some dipping sauce on the side. The tigers tears was listed as an appetizer but I got it as my entree and my bf got the spicy pork. The food took a little longer then we expected. It was worth the wait through. I LOVED the TT. I was glad I asked for it mild cause it was still very spicy, it was just right for me. It had thinly sliced beef with cracked pepper, then red and green chopped peppers, greens and topped off with a lemongrass sauce. I've never tasted anything like it before. The portion was definitely enough for an entree. The spicy pork was good, It was ground up which we didn't expect. It looked like hamburger. The portion was huge. I was surprised they charged an additional $3 for rice with it cause the serving was all pork and rice on the side would be normal. We will return here. After all, it was only $30 for a tasty dinner. There were a bunch of dishes that caught my eye. Parking was easy on the street. It has a very mom and pop type feel. No frills but good food. Our server was sweet.

I am not sure what took me so long to dine at Beast.  For my thirtieth birthday this year, I made brunch reservations for 12 people 2-3 months in advance just to make sure they could accommodate.  Beast only offers a prix fixe menu so I decided brunch ($45/person) was more affordable for everyone to come celebrate a milestone in my life.  They offered two seating for brunch at ten and noon, I opted for the noon hour.  They called to confirm reservation a few days in advance and I changed the number to nine people. When we arrived, my friend's fiance got so excited because he didn't know where we were going and Beast was on his list of places he wanted to try.  It's communal seating so they required everyone to be punctual because they fire the courses at the same time.  The servers were so accommodating and friendly, we were greeted and offered coffee while we looked over the drink menu.  Shortly after our drink arrived, I ordered a cassis mimosa, the first course was brought out in the following order...First course: cherry clafoutis with whipped creme fraiche and maple glazed house bacon\\nSecond course: braised pork belly hash with a poached duck egg\\nThird course: artisan cheeses with a summer salad\\nFourth course: bete noire with a vanilla rum creme chantillyWhat's not to love about candied bacon?  First course started the whole meal on a great note and setup the expectations that the proceeding courses would be just as amazing.  The best dish for me probably was the second course, there's nothing like a perfectly soft-poached egg mixing with the hollandaise sauce and running into the flavorful hash.  It was so succulent!  People thought it was weird that the salad came out as the third dish, however, it makes sense to me because cheeses are typically the progressing dish before dessert and it was light after a heavier dish.  No one liked their alcohol soaked cherry in the salad so they all gave it to me--yes!  The \\"black beast\\" cake with the chantilly had the perfect amount sweet and richness to end the meal.  Substitutions is politely decline and they will take allergies into consideration but I forgot to let them know one of my friend is pregnant.  However, they were kind enough to hard-poached her duck egg, unfortunately, they couldn't substitute the hollandaise sauce or soft cheeses without advance notice.  The restaurant and staff was beyond accommodating for my special occasion.  I look forward to dining at Beast again."},{"name":"Machine Head Coffee","address":"1701 East Mlk Blvd, Ste 103, Veracruz All Natural","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Wild Gift coffee which is great and he's also got decaf cold brew which is hard to find!

Yes. Yes it is.I had heard the hype about this place for a while and had put off trying it until eventually I could put it off no longer. It was in winter earlier this year and there was no long line to deter us from our quest for a tasty treat.I love how readily the staff is willing to encourage people to try samples. With their little spoons you can embark upon an exciting treasure hunt for your favorite ice cream. They have samples of their house-made waffle cones as well. I've visited Salt and Straw enough times to have a favorite but you're crazy if you don't try some of their seasonal/holiday concoctions. For example, during St. Patrick's Day they had Lucky Charms ice cream with a milk base that had been steeped in the cereal milk... and of course there were the delightful little marshmallows scattered throughout. Just amazing... My usual here is Woodblock Chocolate and their Salted Caramel.I also have to laugh because my guy isn't one to eat sweets and he isn't really even fond of ice cream. When he comes with me to Portland he likes to only go to the places we have planned to go and when we deviate from that plan he can get pretty worked up. But whenever I randomly suggest Salt and Straw, even if we're down in Sellwood, without hesitating he will jump at the idea.

I just want to say that this 3 star does not do it justice. \\nSo I came here with friends on a Saturday night at 8pm and they told us that they ran out of ribs and pulled pork... And this place supposed to know for the pork. In my opinion,  They should had learn after being open for 5 months. They should know that they are getting more popular and how to prepare themselves on day in and day out basis.   They need to forecast better with their inventory.  I know it is is hard speaking from experience.  But they have to take a stab of a different method.   It is crucial to try to get it right because they are losing a lot business.  Right now they have a good reputation.  So for now I will give it a 3 star because I have not tried to their signature dishes.  It hurts me to give them a 3 star because they have the potential to be 4 or 5 start.  However, I cannot completely judge the place without trying their signature dishes.Food: 4/5\\nOrdered Two pork belly tacos, 1 la vaca taco, 1 butter chicken taco,  and a meal smoked brisket w fried yuca and seasoned veggies . I used three of their  sauces were chimichurri sauce, fancy sauce and tikka masala sauce. I did not go easy on my first time here. I spent roughly $33 to try their stuff.  They were all pretty decent.  I enjoyed the smoked brisket the most because it was really flavorful and not too salty.   their fried yuca was super fresh. I did enjoy the hispanic mixed with southern style and a bit of India still cuisine in my food.   Surprisingly, it went well together.Service: 3/5\\nFood was great, Service was not so great. It took them a while to get through the long lines with only two cashier. I think we were in line for like 15-18 minutes before we ordered. Then an additional, 12-15 minutes before we got our food.  They need to fix this because if this happened during lunch time, and people have to work.  They won't get many customers during lunch time.   They are in a good spot where people from winter park, downtown,  and 50 mills district can come over to eat their lunch.  Atmosphere: 4/5\\nGreat atmosphere with the outdoor sitting.  They had umbrellas and heater.  However, their indoor area of siting is very limited.  Although they had a cool open kitchen set up and TVs. We sat outside with the heater and it felt amazing!   It is a super clean place and they cleaned up the table fast.  I have to come back here to try out their signature dishes to re-rate this place.  Like I said,  they need to fix their kinks fast..... It does have potential to be amazing!

After all that if you can believe it, I even made room for a piece of vegan chocolate cake that I spied on the counter.  It looked so dense and rich, all covered with chocolate icing.

The ambiance is that of pure kitchen chaos and dining conversation with good tunes playing over the top - as I write this, U2 is telling everyone what's going to happen when Love comes to town...top marks - great vibe.Food is smart, crafty and best enjoyed as multiple courses given the plate size.

It comes out sizzling hot in a clay pot for 1 or 2. The pot is filled with perfectly cooked haddock, fresh onions, cilantro, tomato, and yummy stew broth. If you get this meal follow these three instructions: 1) flatten out your rice pyramid on your dinner plate, 2) spoon your Muqueca over said rice, 3) try to remember your utensils and not just bury your face in this solution, it's rude though completely understandable. Side sweet plantains and collared greens are very note worthy. Fried red snapper good, but seriously the place is called Muqueca for a reason...order from that section. Also, the habenero hot sauce at each table is very, very good (but it's spicy, be careful!).They only have a beer & wine license so I don't think the caiparinhas are legit (i.e.  no cachaca) so take caution if you order one.I'd give this place 5 stars on food alone.

I've had a longstanding desire to be, even slightly, offended at a Mexican restaurant so that I can throw THE BIGGEST B-TCH FIT EVER and vituperatively yell, \\"HEY!!  F-CK YOU, GRINGO!!\\"  To me, \\"gringo\\" is one of the funniest insults out there, and I'd love to take it for a test drive.As a general rule, when looking for a Mexican restaurant, eat at one that Mexicans prefer.  When looking for an Italian restaurant, eat at one that Italians prefer.  When looking for a Chinese restaurant, eat at one that Chinese prefer.  When looking for a seafood restaurant, eat at one that fishermen prefer.  You get the idea.  So when I walked into Holy Taco and failed to see any Latino patrons, servers, or kitchen personnel, I sighed a bit.  Judging by the eye-catching murals and all of the servers with full sleeves of tattoos, Holy Taco isn't going the authentic route regarding Mexican cuisine.  But hey, at least their salsa/hot sauce is imported from Mexico, and that should count for something, right?  Initially, I ordered the beef brisket taco, the pork shoulder taco, and the sword fish taco.  I still had room to taste another and decided on the shrimp taco.  However, my waiter misheard me and instead served another sword fish taco.  Although I was disappointed that I didn't sample their shrimp taco, my frustration was mitigated by my enjoyment of their sword fish taco; of the three varieties that I tried, the sword fish taco was my sheer favorite.  Thus, while my waiter's mistake may have been my opportunity to vehemently explode with my \\"gringo\\" insult, I decided that would probably be overkill.  I also ate a few chips with queso, and though the dip was fine, those nachos were far too oily.Holy Taco, once a gas station, now a quasi Mexican eatery that's more indie rock than mariachi."},{"name":"La Fiesta Mexican Grill and Catering","address":"3000 Curry Ford Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"best fish tacos. best hot homemade sauces. best frosted mug of beer. best tastes. best service. best smiles."},{"name":"Perkins Restaurant & Bakery","address":"1286 Saxon Blvd","city":"Orange City","stars":"3.5","text":"Fair food and fair service.

Obviously it's not a butcher shop, though they do have a few cuts of meat in the cooler.  And just as obviously it is not a charcuterie,  though they do sell it.  And I understand they have a chef that will decide if you can have the item you've requested.  But I just don't know why I need him.If I want sushi I could go to a fish market and make my own.  But I prefer to let the chef prepare it for me.  At The Butcher Shop I order salted and smoked meats; but they don't profess to have cured the meats here.  It doesn't smell like a smokeshop.  Am I paying the chef to slice up the  meat and cheese and arrange the small pieces on my plate in an artsy way?Here's your tip folks:  find a good old world charcuterie and buy some meats.  Likewise, find some artisan breads and cheeses you like, maybe even a bottle of wine.  Then go home and chow down. This place felt pretentious to me.  I tried the steak tartare,  loved it. Is it prepared on-site?  Quite possibly.  I enjoyed the the foie gras as well.  However I didn't care for the toasted brioche served with each, it over-powered the delicate flavors of both these dishes.

Our server was great!  The food though, not very memorable.  We ordered the sirloin, chicken and waffles, collards, white cheddar grits, and fried okra.  My husband ordered the sirloin.  He loved it.  In fact, he devoured everything on the plate!  The fried okra ... I wanted to like but it was very VERY salty.  So salty that I was gonna ask if it's normal, maybe due to the batter...but I had an active infant with me so I didn't want to make a fuss.  Anyway, the white cheddar grits were good.  The chicken with the waffles was sweet, not  really sure if it's the batter or meat that was sweet without the accompanying syrup.  The collards were ok.  It had a hint of sweetness to it too that I wasn't used to with southern collards.  So would I say ... have a hankering to go again?  No.  If I was in the area and someone wanted to go then I wouldn't object per say.  I'd probably subtly suggest something else but I wouldn't kick and scream if we ended up here.

I ordered the sirloin with blue cheese potatoes. The steak was cooked just right. The potatoes were awesome!! There was only one other person dining there so we thought that was odd but we were pleasantly surprised! For dessert, I got cheesecake which was good and my hubby got the chocolate cake.

The beer garden is great, as long as you can find a spot to squat for the night. The beer list was impressive, but I have to say not served cold. A friend I was with informed me it is a German thing to not serve ice cold, but I think beer tastes all that much better when it is nice and cold. Other than that the ambience is awesome. I really do like the vibe. As far as food goes, the pretzels are good- not too salty, which I hate when a pretzel is dosed in salt- this place seasons it right!  Also ordered the classic brats sausage and the pastrami sandwich. The sausage was pretty slimmy and lacked the right mix of flavors for a brats and the pastrami was pretty good, but the pastrami was a little salty for my taste. I have been told I am a bit salt sensitive so it may just have been me. My boyfriend thought the sandwich was really good and not salty at all- so I wouldn't write it off if you enjoy a good pastrami sandwich. The bread was fresh.

As is common in city life, it could be difficult to find parking - we got lucky after about five minutes of searching.  Fortunately for us, we arrived slightly before the dinner rush, so there was no wait to speak of either.  I can see why many reviewers have been noting the long wait times though - the seating was very limited, and the made-from-scratch menu items do take a fair amount of time to prepare.Rino's must have truly been an essential local institution, as we were seated adjacent to a table of local-level politicians that were wining and dining.  Nevertheless, we may have set our expectations a bit too high on this one - the main dishes we ordered (the Pollo Marsala and the Vitello Carozella) were good, but not extraordinary.  Perhaps I erred on ordering a meal with light and delicate flavors when I was hoping for something more bold and robust - not sure.

Sooo... after some deliberation (Do we drive all the way into Van for La Taqueria? Do we not?) we decided that TJ was the place to go. We went with a large group - I think there were 14 of us altogether - and while the restaurant itself is VERY small, the staff smilingly and laughingly pulled together several tables to create a big one for us. There were a few kids among us, and they were very happy with chicken tacos and rice (and chips and salsa of course...) and Jarritos. Obviously Jarritos. They were psyched. When they weren't busy scarfing their food, they were very entertained by the plethora of colorful and cliche pinatas hanging from the ceiling. So, yes, kid-friendly if that's a concern! (Keep in mind, though, that all of us were in Mexico together and so these kids knew what Mexican food was; a picky eater might not fare so well)As far as the food/drink/service went:\\n- Service: It's a Mexican restaurant. The first time I went, it took us close to 40 minutes to get our food, but everything was absolutely perfect - and drinks came out right away, so I imagine it just took forever because there were a lot of us and they don't have a large staff. Once our food arrived, that was it, though. They cleared plates when it was evident that we were finished, which is nice cus I don't like feeling rushed. That's the best thing about Mexico, actually; there's no hurry, and Taqueria Jalisco definitely captures that.- Drink: Jarritos in lime, orange, and mango, which was exciting for a lot of people. Mexican Coke, for $3 a bottle. Agua de Jamaica is what I (and most of the other adults) had - it's a little on the sweet side, but only because I cut the sugar in half when I make it at home. SUCH a good drink on a hot day. Haven't had the horchata, as I'm used to getting it for free on horchata days at La Taqueria... Sigh. Tough life.- Food: My only complaint is that if you're veg and can't have dairy, your only option is breakfast (not that I have ANYTHING against huevos rancheros - and theirs are amazing, even if they're not \\"real\\" Mexican food and are definitely served Mexican-style - eggs over easy between rice and beans with enchilada roja salsa on top, with tortillas on the side). Breakfast, as an aside, is served all day. I ended up having the chicken mole, which was delicious. Mole is my favorite thing, and I love how it's different everywhere. This one is a little sweeter than what I ate in Mexico, but definitely still very good. The beans are great, the rice isn't too damp-feeling, and the chips and salsa are spectacular. The more oily, darker salsa is pretty hot, so I typically mix the two to create one that is Amy-friendly - hot enough to make your lips burn and eyes water, but not so hot that you choke and cough. Altogether, our \\"date lunch\\" bill came to $40ish with tip, but only because William had a burrito AND FOUR TACOS. I went back a few days later for breakfast in the afternoon with two friends, and our food came in five minutes; bill was $8. Lesson learned: it pays to be a woman who doesn't eat much, and to come with fewer people.Oh, there's also a small market with beans, hominy, Jarritos, eucalyptus oil, and other assorted things. Amazing. Will return, will recommend. I love La Taqueria, though; having 4 vegetarian options is the most amazing thing ever, and their horchata rocks.

I came for dinner, and was impressed with the amount of food that I received for the price. The menu layout is different than I was expecting- more like a cafeteria than a traditional restaurant. You order your food cafeteria style, pay, and then pick a seat. I did like being able to see my food and choose it that way, rather than by reading off a menu. Some items I was unsure of their name, so by pointing to them the friendly staff was able to let me know what it was I inquired about. I didn't feel rushed or stupid for not knowing what the names of all the food were, and I really appreciated that. I see a bunch of reviews think this place is pricey, but perhaps being from Houston means I have a different view of pricey vs. Austin. For about $11, I got the Gyro platter which comes with a meat and 3 side items, AND a feta salad or soup. I tried the Lentil Soup, and it was good- my first time trying the soup and it wasn't bad. They do charge extra for the Tzadziki sauce if you don't want to use it as one of your 3 sides, but it's a mere $0.75 more. Pita bread is also extra, and I believe it was $.50 more- again, nothing too expensive. I wasn't even able to finish all of my food. For sides I got the hummus, rice pilaf and spanakopita and it was all delicious.  I also got dessert, because who doesn't like baklava!? It too, was delicious.

The Mac and cheese is super cheesy and yummy and the bread is definitely soft and delicious. They ambience is neat very college area vibe which you should expect being next to ucf.

You look around at DD, and after awaking from your price induced heart attack, you decide to check your trusty Yelp app and look back in the real world.Yes, before I get blasted, I'm aware that this is a chain Tex-Mex restaurant and not considered by some to be \\"real food.\\"  To that, I have to say Ppfffftttthhhh!  I had read on the app that they had a good happy hour, which was something that I really needed.  The margaritas were only four dollars for a real sized drink, as opposed to the ones at DD which were $12+ for a small one.The restaurant was cool, nicely dim and relaxing.  We were seated in a corner booth, towards the back.......they had probably heard about us.  But we like it where it's quiet and we can be silly without attracting too many stares.  Okay, forget about the giant flower mouse ears we were wearing and just move on.We were met in very short order by the cheery Katarina.  We asked immediately about the happy hour drink deals.  She apologized and told us that the deal was only for patrons seated at the bar.  Now, what kind of sense does that make??  There went one star, I said to myself.  Our faces fell and we both ordered water.  Only a moment later she was back.  She had asked the bartender and he agreed to serve us the drinks at the low price.  She didn't have to do that.  So we ordered mango margaritas.  The were there almost immediately, and they were really good.  The star was back in the review. They had just the right amount of mango and just the right amount of tequila.  I would have liked a whole pitcher, but...  She had already brought us a big basket of chips and some really good salsa.  It wasn't the usual bright red, runny salsa that you see at so many places.  It was dark, smokey and full of flavor.  We had to get some extra to go with the rest of our dinner.Next up, we decided just to order a couple of appetizers to split, so we went for the carnitas nachos and the bacon wrapped jalapeno shrimp.  The nachos were delicious!  Instead of the usual huge pile of chips, lightly covered with bits of meat, beans and cheese, these had big chunks of tender marinated pork, lots of black beans a thick layer of mixed cheeses and piles of sour cream and guac in the middle.  There were just enough chips to eat with the meat and veggies.  My only complaint was that there were a few larger than acceptable chunks of fat on the meat, but that's my hang-up.The serving of the shrimp was kind of small for the price - only four shrimp.  That being said, they were plump and perfectly cooked, served with a honey sauce.  Let me say this; I didn't know that jalapenos could get that hot!  I'm usually okay with that level of heat and my daughter does great with it.  As we slowly chewed the first bite, we were again wishing for that pitcher of margaritas.  Katie ordered another one, since we were unable to locate a fire extinguisher.We were completely sated and a bit over after just the two apps.  Katarina tried to talk us into some nice fried ice cream, to go with those chile peppers, but not this time.  She was there shortly with the check and just as shortly to finish up.  We complimented her on some of the best service that we've had lately.  She told us that she was relatively new there, so kudos to whomever hired her, she's very good at her job."},{"name":"No 9 Restaurant","address":"812-5300 No 3 Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"3","text":"Have you ever been up late past 2am and possibly drunk and possibly low energy from dancing in the club and possibly hungry?

We got there about 6:30 on a Thursday night to find the place packed both on the inside and outdoor patio. We got drinks from the bar and were told that it would be about 20-30 minute wait for our group of 9.  They had to split our group, but we were seated in 15 minutes. As we were waiting to place our food order, one of my coworkers went over to another table to see what they were eating. They were very friendly and offered her a sample to try. They were regulars there. My coworker tried the pork chop. She said that was the best pork chop ever. We place our orders. Two coworkers ordered the pork chop special, another ordered the fish and chips and I ordered the filet medallion. The pork chop is smoked and then prepared in a glaze. According to my coworkers it was the best pork chop ever!  Very much worth the $23 price tag. The filet medallion was so juicy and tender and had great flavor. The owner of the place stopped at our table to see if we were enjoying our dinner. We praised the meal. He asked where we were from and we told him we were staying at the Indigo and we walked.

One being the location, its in East Boston, enough said. Despite the location, my boyfriend and I were really excited for the food. My almost 2 hour trip (due to traffic) to get there wasn't worth it bc of the way we were treated. We knew the place was small and would have a long wait. It didn't bother us. He parked the car a block away while I ran inside to give my name. The hostess took my name and number and told me there were 4 parties ahead of me, which was fine. We were outside for about an hour and a half in the cold, but I won't complain about; it went by fairly quickly. One after another, the lady (hostess) came outside to get parties or even signaled through the window (which I thought was odd). So, naturally, I'm thinking, ok, she will get us when we're ready. We're the only people outside and notice a table opened up. I wait and wait and notice no one was coming out. I look at my phone and noticed 2 missed calls. Bc the airport is minutes away, neither of us heard my phone ring. I walked inside and immediately was given attitude. \\"I called you twice\\". I said \\"I know, I'm sorry. I didn't hear my phone ring. It's loud out there\\" \\"Well, I gave your table away\\" was the response I got. Like oh well, tough luck. I look at the empty table and she repeats herself so we went outside. Normally in a situation like this I would've lost it, but I held my cool. 5-10 minutes goes by and no one enters the building. Then the hostess comes outside, rudely and loudly says my name. I am literally a foot in front of her. We get sat at the same exact table that would've been ours 10 minutes earlier. It took the waiter almost 15 minutes to come over to us to greet (which wasn't much of a greeting and to get our drink/food order. We ordered 2 salads with vinegarette dressing which I enjoyed (this is huge considering I hate eating vegetables), although there wasn't enough dressing. Just a blob in the middle. For an appetizer, we ordered the schrimp scampi. It was delish! There was a lot of garlic in it but it didn't ruin the dish. For an entree I had the pollo carrozella. And for $5 more, you can get their homemade pasta. Worth it. I love pasta! I've honestly never had homemade pasta before. This dish was really good.\\nMy boyfriend had the lobster ravioli. My experience with ordering ravioli of any kind at a restaurant, you usually get a small portion. But I was surprised to see how much was in his plate. Of course, I had a bite and it was amazing. There was a lot of lobster meat stuffed in each and the sauce complimented it well. Our server didn't really pay attention to us, which was disappointing as I like chat with people, especially people serving me my food. He came by and asked \\"you ok?\\". It threw me off. I used to be a server and would never just ask \\"you ok?\\". I mean what are you asking me really? Am I feeling ok? I mean, it was vague and not friendly. The second time he said that, I asked for a refill on water. He came by, filled our glasses and said \\"I'm going to leave this here.\\" I was insulted. I thought, ok, is he leaving the pitcher on the table bc he doesn't want to come by anymore? I'm sorry if I only asked for a refill once and didn't order a second wine bc apparently white wine is supposed to be served warm now. Took him forever to come by with a check and took him even longer to pick up the check. Unfortunately I left him a 20% tip. I wish I didn't. Oh, the person the hostess \\"gave our table to\\" showed up as we were finishing our dinners. Unreal. Bottom line, I don't care how amazing your food is... if your staff and service doesn't come close, then you need to reevaluate who you hire and how things are done.

More of just a grey, slightly sand broth at the bottom of the bowl that I'm pretty sure was just the clam broth.Asked the server for bread to go with my pasta, 15  minutes later I was able to get some from the S/A.Oh almost forgot!

The person taking our order at the counter repeatedly needed help from one of his co-workers to get orders into their system.

In the 45 minutes or so that we were there, we could only see 5 or 6 orders come out of the kitchen (I could tell because they call out the order numbers). When they brought out our order, I had to repeatedly try to catch the waiter's eye to get her to bring it to us - she seemed more interested in chatting with the other customers than in serving us. Also, while one of the employees behind the counter was slicing turkey for someone's sandwich, we saw him slice a piece and pop it into his mouth - it did not seem that he was just tasting it to see if it was OK, but because he was hungry.I'd say they have a ways to go with their execution."},{"name":"Bangkok Pinto","address":"1041 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Quick delivery.

I certainly have an appreciation for the decor, which absolutely provides a flavor for the types of dishes to expect. Moreover, the hostesses and server were excellent. It was definitely a warm and welcomed experience from the onset.We started with drinks. The Pinot Blanc was crisp and refreshing. The Imperial Stout was quite high octane, which noticeably impacted the taste of the housemade beer. The other housemade beer I tried was their Whiskey Stout. Also good, but I would have been equally pleased if they served comparable microbrews from Terrapin or Rogue. I hear their lighter beers are worth trying. Maybe next time. But, I digress.We began our meal with the mac & cheese. The flavor was great. But, it was rather saucy and we would have preferred the noodles to be closer to al dente.Then, we ordered the roasted oysters. Again, the flavor was nice. But, we were underwhelmed. However, the spicy cocktail sauce they made was delightful. And, it's not for the faint-of-heart. I love spicy foods. It's spicy.For our main entrees, we ordered the flounder and scallops. The scollops were a massive disappointment. We agreed tiny, little bay scallops were the wrong choice. Had they been pan-seared jumbo sea scollops, the dish would have been a winner. On the other hand, the flounder was virtual perfection. It was firm yet flaky, served over a shallow offering of corn and clam chowder. It also came with the added bonus of five or six well-prepared clams. Overall, this was the winner of the night.Since we were celebrating, we thought it was appropriate to indulge by finishing the night with some desert. Both were quite remarkable. The housemade ice creams were excellent in flavor and portions (three small scoops, one for each flavor). That night, the samplings were of pumpkin, something perhaps with walnuts, and our favorite of the three: banana pudding ice cream. Simply divine. We also got the fried dough, which was served with some sort of custard. We weren't sure if it was meant to be eaten separately or not, so we just dipped the \\"doughnuts\\" in the accoutrement. After my first bite, I exclaimed, \\"That's some decadent yummy shit!\\"Overall, it's worth a visit. I will very likely go again and try something different. I must admit the menu was a bit intimidating and no one dish grabbed my attention. I recommend it with reservations (and, I don't mean calling for a table in advance)."},{"name":"Ichi Teriyaki 27","address":"585 W 8th St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"This place does lunch right!

The cheese was fresh, the sauce was homemade, and while it's hard to ignore that you are getting a 6 inch circle of cheese and isn't the sexiest presentation on earth, If you can't love a fresh piece of fried cheese with salty meat on the inside-I am certain that you and I will not get along. \\nFor Wine, we choose the house Red.

The herb and oil mix was delightful.\\nMy wife had the Shrimp Francavillese, which was a generous portion of Shrimp, probably about 10-14. The pasta and garlic butter sauce met with her approval.\\nI had the Veal Piccata, i took half of it and the side of pasta to have for lunch the next day. Very tender, no complaints.\\nTo finish off, we tried a piece of hazelnut cake, I can't even put into words how amazing it was.

I was always a bit skeptical of how good a Thai restaurant in a bright blue building could be in the middle of Midtown.  To my surprise, it was decent.  The hubs and I ordered the green curry (one of my favorite Thai curries) and the basil beef.  The green curry was creamy, spicy, and full of yummy veggies and chicken.  It was pretty decent.  I order green curry at almost every Thai restaurant I go to, and The Tenth's green curry was just as good or better than most Thai places.  The only complaint I have is that there wasn't much curry.  I was scraping curry from the bottom of the plate.  A whole lot of chicken and veggies, but not a lot of curry.  However, it was still tasty.  The beef basil was just OK.  The sauce was tasty, perhaps a bit salty, and the beef was tough.  It was just a step away from being beef jerky in basil sauce.  I probably wouldn't order it again.Overall, I think I had a good experience.  The food and the prices are worth a short walk to eat there again, or to order it for take out.

I cannot say enough how great it turned out, thanks to the amazing venue and the accommodating staff.I had never considered a wedding in a restaurant, but compared to the other options I found, this seemed to be the most no-fuss option. They already have tables, chairs, place settings, decor, etc., and all you have to do is visit the restaurant to get a feel for the place - not try to envision how things will look together in your head.After visiting the spot for the first time, we fell in love with it. 3 days later we booked the venue - we bought out the restaurant for the night of the wedding - and I am so happy that we did!A few months before the wedding we scheduled our tasting. It was SO delicious! And fun! They even brought wine to pair with the dishes. We got to try 3 of each of the salad and entree options. It was difficult to narrow this down for our menu, everything was so tasty!Mike, the Director of Events, was fantastic. He was an absolute godsend in the weeks leading up to the wedding and the actual day of.We met with Mike a couple of times in the last weeks leading up to the big day and finalized all of the details - our timeline of events, vendor set up times, finalized our menu choices, reviewed our seating chart, etc. Mike also allowed us to drop off some items (signs, programs, placecards, menus, card box, guestbook, etc.) a couple of days before the wedding so that we didn't have to worry about bringing these items to the venue on the day of. We told Mike where/how we wanted each of these items placed, and when we arrived at the venue on the day of, everything was exactly as we had requested!Mike set up the Petit Bistro as our \\"bridal suite\\" for the day of the wedding. This was a perfect spot for my husband and me to escape to to get some private time on the big day. Mike brought in chairs and a small loveseat along with a coffee table for us to relax at. I had requested champagne, water, and Coca-Cola in the room as refreshments, and Mike even went out to CVS before the wedding when he realized I had requested Coca-Cola and they only have Pepsi products in house (I would've been fine with Pepsi, by the way, but how nice of him to do so)!We were concerned that the Paris Cafe that we were using as our ceremony room would not be big enough for all of our 55 guests to be seated, but Mike figured out a way using both regular height chairs and high top bar chairs to set up the room so that not only could everyone be seated, but given the different heights of the chairs, people in the back could still see!Also, Mike was fantastic with my young flower girl and ring bearer. For the processional, Mike helped to keep the kids back so that they went at the correct time right before me. He also kept the flower girl in check when she was obsessed with getting at the cake and blowing out any candles in the venue!Another thoughtful thing that Mike did was he asked us a few days before the wedding what we liked to drink. I requested a blueberry beer, which they didn't have on their beer list at the time, but on the big day, there at the bar, I saw Seadog Blueberry! My husband mentioned that he and his friend were big fans of Tank 7, which they had on tap, but they also brought in bottles for the big day to make it easier to drink on the dance floor! Also, Winston behind the bar was great. There was never a long wait for drinks, and judging by the itemized receipt at the end of the night, there were a lot of drinks had by all!I can't believe I've gotten this far without mentioning the food. The food was delicious. After the ceremony my husband and I escaped to the Petit Bistro for some private time where we could celebrate that we just GOT MARRIED! Mike brought in a platter with two of each of our hors d'oeuvres, and they were AMAZING. We also thoroughly enjoyed our seated dinner. Everything was absolutely perfect. And we have gotten so many compliments since about how delicious everything was!We finished off the night in The Lounge which acted as our dance floor. I was worried that we wouldn't have enough space, but the size of the dance floor ended up being perfect. Not too crowded, but crowded enough to keep the party going.All in all, I couldn't have asked for a better wedding day. I am so appreciative for all that Mike and his team at Central Bistro did for us. I would highly recommend other couples check this place out if you are looking for a venue with a great downtown location and fun vibe.Thank you Central Bistro for making my wedding day better than I ever could have dreamed!"},{"name":"The Rambler","address":"4205 N Mississippi Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The food was amazing. I had the frito pie and my mom had the chicken caesar wrap. The tornado potatoes were good too. My mom was in heaven and still is going on about how good the food was, and she's picky. We went on a slow afternoon on a Saturday. The reason I'm not giving 4-5 star is because I had to go to the bar to order my food and for the price I would expect table service. I've been a server before but trying to get our water/drinks down to the patio through the door and getting refills is annoying when you spend over $30 on lunch and you're wanting to relax and eat. Also, the bartender was NOT  friendly, she was queen of the cold-shoulder-ignore-you persona but the bouncer was super friendly and very kind. Even the kitchen staff were friendly when I went in to get a to-go bag. Please change your table service!!

Pretty good barbecue place - stopped by here for a bite on a \\"food tour\\" around Florida after hitting up East End Market. We ordered the 1/4 ribs and meat combo, selecting the brisket as the second meat, paired with the hot BBQ sauce. The brisket was slightly dry, although the fattier pieces had a nice richness and flavor. Adding the hot BBQ sauce definitely helped a lot. The sauce had a nice zing to it from spiciness but definitely not too much to handle. Good tangy-ness as well, as expected from barbecue. Overall though, I don't think I would order the brisket again.The ribs were definitely the best part of the meal. You could clearly see the smoked layers of pink on the outer edges of the meat, and they were nicely tender. Not quite falling off the bone but essentially there. They were well sauced - not overwhelmingly so, but a good amount for enhancing the flavor. No extras needed! For the two sides, we selected the yuca fries and Mexican corn. The Mexican corn was quite good - a decent amount of cheese with some cilantro to brighten up the flavor a bit. The yuca fries came with a good spicy mayo, but were definitely quite woody and fibrous (which makes sense given the plant).I'd come back here if I came back to Florida and would try a different meat such as the chicken."},{"name":"Easy Tiger","address":"709 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Has there ever been a better idea than bar + bakery?

We check out the newest and best places according to CL, AJC, Eats, Atlanta Magazine, etc.  We were there when the restaurant opened for the night and we were the first to be seated at tables.  For a good 30 minutes it was just our group of 8, and another group of 6 in the dining room.  The majority of the restaurant was empty.  I had heard Saltyard was a \\"hit or miss\\" restaurant, and for my group it was a miss.  About 25% of the food (25+ dishes) was deemed outstanding.  About 50% of our food was ok, and roughly 25% was either a total miss or food that was too salty or too oily.  That is the good part of the meal.What really drove us crazy was the way food was run from the open kitchen.  At any given time there were 6-8 runners standing in the middle of the entry area waiting on food from the kitchen.  It came out in spurts.  We had ordered three of one item at our table; the runner came out with three, dropped one at our table, and continued on to another table with the other two.  So, the person at our table with food started eating and two people sat there with nothing for at least 15 minutes waiting on the same item.  This is so wrong from so many directions.  I was the last person served ANY food and some of my table mates were on to their second and third dishes.  I couldn't even get my kale salad?  Surely the kitchen doesn't make that dish one-by-one.  I understand this is tapas but for one tiny dish to be dropped for 8 people to share, when we had ordered THREE dishes, is not acceptable.The decor is very industrial and laid out well.  We were comfortable at our table and had enough personal space.  Our waitperson seemed a bit green but she was pleasant and was patient explaining the menu. She kept coming by to put down clean plates in front of each diner and we kept giving them back to her when food arrived....on a plate.  It was an odd restaurant.  I might return to try one of the \\"fabulous\\" dishes I didn't order, but mostly I don't think it is worth the drive or hassle watching people eat while some folks don't even have a crumb.  I definitely would not go back with a group because it just doesn't work well.  Go if you are a couple in love and just want to gaze into each other's eyes for a couple of hours.  In between gazing, you will get an occasional dish out of the kitchen to share.  That's about it."},{"name":"Lost Shepherd","address":"345 W Olentangy St","city":"Powell","stars":"3","text":"Walked in and I was immediately greeted and seated.

The waitress was on the spot to take pour drink orders and explain the specials.  Decent showing with the beer selection.  I ordered the steak special and my date ordered the salmon special.  We both ordered house salads and we did enjoy them.  They were both the right size for eating before an entr√©e.Mine was a very thick, almost filet-like sirloin that I think was cooked perfectly medium.  Very tender, but lacking in seasoning.  It was paired with a generous helping of potatoes au gratin.  The entr√©e was okay, just nothing to write home about.The salmon was very good.  She did allow me some to taste.  The sweet Thai chili sauce on the salmon was very good and well balanced.  Her salmon was placed on top of some asparagus that was excellent.  Hers was much better than mine.I can recommend both dishes, along with the salads.  We'll both be back to sample the sammies we watched being delivered.An update to correct what forgot.

I liked the take on classic comfort food with yummy twists. I was surprised when one of our party ordered chicken fingers but they were unexpectedly  good, moist with a mild heat undercurrent. We tried  the Cincinnati chili, pasta carbonara, bouillabaisse and several of the vegetable side dishes, the best among them the roasted cauliflower with harissa.  The spinach with pine nuts was my least favorite, only as it was a tad too sweet for me but still well cooked and presented. Our waiter was great. Down to earth and helpful and thankfully he steered me away from ordering the cassoulet as he explained it was a sweeter, more bar-b-que-ish style, rather than the traditional French I was expecting. The order of serving of the dishes was a little random seeming as we got one entree, then the vegetables, then the other entrees a couple at a time but given the feel of the place and the relaxed sharing, it didn't bother me."},{"name":"Uno Pizzeria & Grill","address":"12553 State Rd, Ste 535","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Love Pizza Uno!

The selection was great with a few local beers and a lot of hard-to-find runs from larger, more well-known craft breweries.  I can't speak much for the food, we ordered a snack plate that came with a couple of pretzels, some jerky and a chex mix they make themselves.  All of it was pretty decent.The patio in the back is a pretty great spot, some ping pong tables are set up, a lot of long communal tables, good music playing and it gets plenty of shade.  Without having tasted much of the food, the only drawback I can think of for this place is that they don't offer flights-something that would have been great because they have such a large and varied menu of beers on tap."},{"name":"Beast","address":"5425 NE 30th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This place is INCREDIBLE- it appears casual on the outside, but on the inside it is quaint and has a cozy dining room feel.

First I ordered about six sashimi pieces, which were surprisingly fresh and tasty. Then I ordered the Sexy Girl and Merry Christmas rolls--both tasted delicious as well. I followed that up with General Tso's chicken; the succulent pieces of white meat chicken came out piping hot! To finish, I ordered more sashimi and some green tea ice cream. While the latter did have a bitter taste, since I like green tea bitter, I was happy enough.Service was attentive and not annoyingly so and the restaurant had a cool vibe.

First, let me say that the server, Nick, was running his tail off, and I didn't blame him for any part of my negative experience at The Picnic House. The service was slow because they appeared to be understaffed. We made it clear from the beginning that we had tickets to a show at the Schnitz at 7:30. We arrived just before our 6:00 reservation. Nick specified the items that take the longest, and we didn't order any of them. We didn't get our meal until 7:05, and the only thing I could eat was the salad. My Yukon mashed potatoes were cold (the cheese had melted and then re-coagulated on top; they brought them out anyway). My \\"ribs\\" were literally a pile of small bones and fat. Not RIBS. They looked as unappetizing as they tasted. Literally like nothing named \\"ribs\\" that I have ever seen. They were topped with cold \\"frites.\\" Terrible.

Besides that, they are pretty average in every way.The sushi appears to be the same B-grade fish that you get in kaiten (conveyor belt) places and they use way too much rice in both their nigri and rolls.  In addition, their greasy tempura has way too much batter.My friends still talk me into going here every once in awhile just because they have large portions and it's relatively cheap.

The logo looks like a \\"sausage\\" wiggling toward your mouth. The decor is trying to be modern but comes off as a bathroom from the Jetsons cartoons. It's white and orange with a plastic feel, and usually very empty (not from lack of public interest but most likely due to pricing and taste). My wife and I were so excited to try this place. We both got the cheeseburger sausage and had to pay extra for drinks and chips. We knew it wouldn't taste like a hotdog, but we did expect something similar to the taste of a sausage. It tasted as if we chewed up an entire cheeseburger and fries meal and then spit it up into a pig intestine and called it a sausage. I'm not trying to be dramatic or cruel. It honestly tasted disgusting. The concept is trying way too hard to do something different with a classic and it's showing. Since they opened business is crawling and people aren't turned off by just the price but the gross flavor of the food and lack of sides and options as well. It's not worth the time or money to try, but my advice if you insist on trying it is to only buy one, skip the chips, and share because you'll only want one bite."},{"name":"Turner's Seafood - Salem","address":"43 Church St","city":"Salem","stars":"4.5","text":"This was a great place.

It's just strange to spend that much on a little cup of meat.  We were still quite hungry afterwards but didn't feel like spending $5 for a small piece of cheese.The tartare itself was good but not as good as in France.  Too much mustard, covered up the meaty deliciousness you expect from a tartare.The butcher himself was quite friendly.  We bought boudin and merguez.  The boudin was a little weird, in that it had big chunks of fat in it, which I've never seen before.  But the rest was delicious, and boudin is tricky to find in Boston.

I usually like to make a huge salad so that I can stuff myself with plenty of healthy green fiber which then justifies me going back for a few artery-clogging pieces of pizza.  This was my first visit to a Cici's in Atlanta, but this location was dirty and disappointed me.  The salad bar was quite extensive with items I usually don't see at other Cici's, such as beetroot and garbanzo beans, but then it goes downhill.  The salad area was messy with sauce smeared everywhere, greasy salad dressing bottles, and serving sets with sticky handles.  Some of the cheese was mixed with the olives, some of the olives were mixed with the bell peppers, some of the bell peppers were mixed with the mushrooms, etc.  Totally unsanitary and unattractive!  There were no clean tables to sit down and eat!  Every vacant (and occupied) table had leftover food on it, scraps of paper, or grease stains.  It looked like they were short-staffed and nobody was wiping them down until closing time.  We found the least filthy one and noticed a table sign requesting customers bus their own trays.  Really?  It's sad...the variety of pizza was lacking at this location.  What they called the \\"deep dish pizza\\" was really just a thick crust with a thin layer of sauce...nothing deep about it!  The brownies were thin and crumbly...like sawdust squares out of a box!Towards 9:30PM, we noticed a family arguing with the manager because they had just paid for their dinner, and the restaurant was not going to make any more pizza.  After they left in anger, the crew joked and laughed about them with another family who went there to scrape up the oily leftovers.  The crabby employees were getting ready to close shop 30 minutes early!  As we left, we noticed that unlike other Cici's, this one had no cowbell by the exit door for us to ring if we thought we had good service or enjoyed the meal.  Maybe it's because the management already knew the experience would be crappy overall now that they were cutting too many corners!  They certainly weren't cheerful like most other Cici's we used to enjoy.By the time we finished and got into the car, my stomach was starting to ache, and my gut did not feel well.  For the next 4 days, I had abdominal cramping, prolific gas, occasional chills, and watery bowl-blasting runs.  For the public's safety, the local health department or the CDC really needs to come and do an inspection!  Has it really come down to this for Cici's?  Well, I hope it's only this location and not a reflection of the entire chain because I like Cici's in general!

I am so glad I did because I had a great time. Our waitress was outstanding: helpful, efficient, charming and then tastefully absent. Uncharacteristically, I'm told, the room was not crowded. The people who were there were a decidedly eclectic bunch whose overheard conversations were quite interesting. Most importantly, the food was excellent. It is difficult to characterize the cuisine. Of course it's Italian although Roma and Neopolitan styles take a decided back seat. Some dishes harken Abbruzzi classicism; others fuse Sicillian with Tuscan styles or Bolognese touches with coastal preparations. And some come out of sheer inventiveness with no discernible geography attached to it, like my seared scallops over mashed potatos, plated wth a corn and pomegranite glaze. A basil mint mojito with mussels and burnt tomatoes to start; excellent Chianti with the main course; and very good tiramisu with even better coffee made an \\"I'll take a chance visit\\" look like a very, very smart bet.

They open at 5; get there early or you're going to wait a while most nights.  For real, I went in here at like 7 last night and it was an hour wait for a table and the bar area was totally packed.  Really, the only reason for 4 stars is that it's so busy in here I've had to go elsewhere on several occasions.  If you want brunch you need to show up at least 15-20 minutes early to wait in line or you're going to have a wait a while for a table.  These aren't necessarily bad things and I'm not being a jerk.  This RULES for Highland Kitchen, they're the best spot in the neighborhood and you need to check it out if you're in the area for any reason.Drinks - Get the #27 Margarita.  For real, it rules.  The Bloodhound and Dorchester are also great.  I hear the Mark & Stormy is delicious but I'm not into ginger beer.  If you are you should try it.\\nThey've also had Anchor Steam and BBC Steel Rail on tap every time I've been there which is awesome.\\nFood - Everything I've had is great.  Some of my highlights include: for apps the buffalo friend brussel sprouts, lamb tacos, and the ricotta & mozzarella fritters.  the veggie and cheeseburger are both great as well as the cuban rueben and blackened catfish po' boy.  The fish & chips, pan roasted boneless half chicken, and grilled flat iron steak are great as well.  Also, the friend chicken on Monday night is absolutely worth your while.\\nBrunch - Serious bloody mary.  For real one of the best I've had.

The price per dish is on the expensive side, and given my big appetite, I'm still debating whether after spending as much as I did, and still being quite hungry, I should have spent more to get my fill.My only major complaint is the management.  My friend and I wanted to split the bill, but they wouldn't allow us to do so because they required $20 or more to run a credit or debit card.  Our bill was $18, so my friend asked if the restaurant could just charge his card $20 + any tip we wanted to put on it.  But the manager wouldn't even listen to us, telling us loudly (in front of everyone) that the $20 swipe minimum was restaurant policy and that she was doing us a \\"favor\\" by letting us swipe \\"this one time.\\"  Okay, so you will do us a favor by swiping $18 but you won't let us swipe $20?

I wholly admit that yet I did go to a dine out last night.   I've never been to Mosaic Bar and Grille. We got an 830 dinner time so when we got to the restaurant it was pretty much empty.  I think we were the only active table they had going, so of course we got impeccable service!  The food overall was ok, but I've had much better!  I started out with the cauliflower bisque.  A bit flat tasting... And too creamy for my taste.  My main course was the Pork Belly over couscous.  Hey I'm Chinese man!I know good pork belly!  I've been eating pork belly since I was a little kid and this was not good pork belly!  The most important part of pork belly is the top skin.  The skin is suppose to be crispy and crunchy....  This skin was not good at all.  It was loaded with oil and soft.  Even the meaty parts of the pork belly was a bit too over cooked.  It was chewy not tender as its suppose to be.  The couscous was pretty good.  I like the buttery taste, but I did not think the bits of Brussel spouts thrown into the couscous matched.  They were two competing flavours.  They did not blend well together.  My friend DC went to a Dine Out last year at Mosaic and he said the highlight for him was the chocolate cake.  I guess I was really looking forward to it based on what DC said.  I have to admit I was disappointed by the final result.  I found the cake to be too hard and heavy.  Certainly it was too rich for me to eat the whole thing.  I could only stomach half of it.  My experience at Mosaic did not live up to expectations.  But I am willing to give this place another try.

What was on our plates could have come out of a couple of packets of instant powder.  Our waiter said they were trying out a new menu.  Huh???  We looked around.  The fried chicken dinners looked like the photos on Yelp.  I guess we were the only ones foolish enough to think that ALL the dinner options would look equally satisfying.  I'm not sorry that I passed up the scallops with white bean ragout--really???   We passed on dessert after that and finally agreed to let them comp one glass of (terrible) wine.

The ice cream itself felt buttery and overall, intresting concept but would only recommend to try and not get a scoop of. 4: the strawberry flavor would definitely be the primary taste, with subtleness of balsamic flavors seeping through at the beginning of every bite.

The vegan food was very tasty and the cocktails happily prepared by\\n attentative bartenders.   I have one disappointment, with all the tables in the joint you would think there would be a slight bit more table service.  I understand its order at the bar, get a number, and grab a comfy spot somewhere, but some wait staff every now and then passing through would be nicely accommodating.  Its almost so crowded if you don't have a napkin, need an additional condiment, silverware, or whatever you almost don't want to navigate the tight quarters.....service please?I also expect more table service when paying a higher dollar for a few cocktails.

He ordered a wrong main dish for me and you know that feeling when 9 people at your table are already eating and you sit there like an idiot still smiling..  Yeah.... Food was OK. Nothing memorable.

Its location on the North Shore guaranteed you would only get there once or twice a year and always appreciate returning.I recently returned to the Tomahawk after a 10-year absence.  The Tomahawk doesn't have a foyer; it has an entrance, which was packed with people, mostly tourists (undoubtedly led there by Lonely Planet and the like) and north shore locals (visibly annoyed with the tourists).The Tomahawk was opened in 1926 and provides a visual snapshot of the Seventies.  During that time, the Tomahawk has accumulated and displayed thousands of pieces of native kitsch; the stereo-typical effect of which delivers a subtle offensiveness that is only acceptable (if it is at all) at the Tomahawk given its 86-year history.The Tomahawk isn't all \\"old-school\\".  The food is great and I was very happy to see that it offers organic meats and free-range eggs.  The owners, who remarkably remain the original family, and the staff were very friendly and courteous.  We were asked several times if everything was ok which made it very apparent that our satisfaction was important.Overall, the Tomahawk remains a great place to get a great breakfast served by great people.

Firstly, I love the concept. So original, different, and just awesome. Wasn't expecting tacos to be in the menu... Sadly the first time I went they ran out of brisket, tacos sounded good so I decided to give them a try- excellent! My favorite was the chicken al pastor. My friends favorite was the pork belly. The second time I got the pulled pork platter, grilled veggies and fennel apple slaw. Might be the best pulled pork I've ever had. And the slaw is incredible, my new favorite side. Finally, a couple days ago I got the brisket!!!!! It was well worth the wait. So delish. Again, probably the best I've ever had. *just a warning about the brisket, I was told it has a fatty side and a lean side- the fatty side is more flavorful but is about half fat so if you are looking for something a little leaner, just ask for the lean side. I didn't know this when so I'll be sure to ask for it next time.* for my sides I got the fennel apple slaw again (I'm salivating just thinking about it) and the plantains which were really really good. On a side note, my sister got the corn and said it was the best she'd ever had. She ate it all before I could have a chance to try it haha next time! All in all, this place is amazing. New, fresh, different. The owner and staff are eager to please.

I knew that going in so its a bit hard to write a negative review when you respect the head chef so much and know that she knows her stuff.A part of me just wonders if the dishes I was served were maybe just not the one's that naturally appeal to me. Its certainly possible, but then I've had dishes at great places with menu items I'm not a fan of that still sing to me. So with that all said...The first three courses were the best. The amuse was this delicious little bite of fish on a homemade cracker with a wonderful tasting soft sour cream dollop. It was heavenly. The second course of tuna was incredible as well. The pasta was the third course. Also heavenly. The amuse and the first course were unbelievable and memorable. It was such a stunning beginning.Then the progression left me a bit curious. The duck dish was fine, but the sauce was too strong and salty. The beans were tasty - but the dish overall lacked the kind of splendor of the first few dishes. It was an overall heavy dish that slightly veered into overkill for me. The veggie salad course was again nice, but underwhelming. Cheese course again was fine as a cheese course.The desert needed to be stunning to cut the richness of the duck. It was not. The cake was dry and the sauce was too tart. My girlfriend and I didn't finish it. I did not like the desert and would skip it if it were given to me. It was also extremely expensive and the wine pairings were all white wines, which was kind of disappointing as someone who loves reds.

Nobody had eaten there so we were all excited. We walked in to get a table and told the hostess Judy that 1 more person would be joining our party and we needed a table for 4. She said it was fine and we could have a drink across the street and she would call when the table was ready. We waited about 20 minutes and she called us to come back. When we walked into the place, she sat us at a table and then demanded to know where the fourth person was. We tried to explain he was on his way but she was very rude, told us she should have never seated us and demanded we call him right then and there. She hovered over us until the call was made. She then told us he has 10 minutes to get and we were not allowed to order anything. Then Judy came back 5 minutes later harassing us again and forced us to text our friend and tell him to hurry up. She again waited at our table for the reply.The weird thing is, there were 3 tables available to seat people at all times.The waitress was then given permission to take out order. We ordered a bottle of wine an apps. By the time they were brought to the table our friend had arrived. The apps were good. We put in our order and I left for the bathroom.The bathroom is actually in the kitchen. It's small and dirty and you have to walk on a very slippery floor to get there. The cooks are all from El Salvador.I went back to my table to see that salad was served to everyone but me. Not only that but only 2 people had silverware to eat it. I sat and waited for 10 minutes until I got up and walked to the back where the waitresses were chatting. Standing next to them, I was ignored and finally they just walked away from me. I bothered a girl who was folding napkins at a table to get me my salad and silverware. She brought it over and just threw it on the table, didn't clear my dirty plates from the apps, and walked away. I cleared my own plates and placed them on another table.The service was some of the worst I have ever experienced. First being treated terribly by Judy the hostess. It left me feeling very uncomfortable and embarrassed. I wanted to leave but my friends insisted on staying. Nobody smiles. When anything was brought to the table we would say thank you, etc..and there was never a response, only a very miserable looking face on a person that quickly walked away from us.

They're all finished off with some artistic design on top and taste amazing.Ambiance: The cafe is rather large for a coffee shop and has long benches which is great for hanging out or studying. Its decorated like a rustic train station or warehouse which seems to be the trend in many buildings these days.Lucky Donuts is a welcome addition and there's no shortage of people staring, drooling, gaping the big glass case of glazed goodness.

We've been friends for awhile, now. I lived in the neighborhood way back when you opened, in 2007. You were new, you were -- if you will pardon the pun-- hungry. It was a brave new world of hungover brunch here in the Port, and you were out to make your name.Well, you've done it. Coming back after a hiatus of undeserved (I thought) proportions, I arrived on your shores to find you a bustling township of the various and sundry. The wait list was packed. The coffee was self-service, a sure sign of prosperity in the brunch game. I was proud.But then things began to go amiss, Toast. I wonder if you noticed? Three two-tops sat open while my wife and I stood patiently by, slurping weak joe. When we were seated, it took roughly two years to get some water. Not that I mind. Or at least, not that I mind much. It's only a Saturday. What else could I possibly have to do?The insults were coming fast and hard at that point. My wife ordered her favorite, an oldie but goodie, a steadfast, a stand-by. The server informed her that you were out. Don't you think that was something she could have made clear at the outset, Toast? And what of your specials? We were kept in the dark.I'm going to come right out and say it, old friend: the food was abysmal. My wife's purportedly \\"Bad Ass Sandwich\\" was a slag of wilty greens and tepid egg yolk. The slight implication of goat cheese. And my \\"Good and Baked\\"? If you're going to par-steam what were very likely frozen broccoli florets and carrot coins and slap a fried egg on top, at least have the courtesy to laugh in my face while I crunch through the farce. Staring at the watery nothing that you have the audacity to call \\"creamed kale,\\" Toast, I wondered what I had done to deserve this. I'm not sorry about the crap tip.

Server spoke super softly and I felt weird having to ask her over and over again what she said (I'm not at all hard of hearing either.) Food came out fairly quickly. Most redeeming part of the meal was the corn bread. For 2 adult meals and 1 kid meal, it was about $40 with tip.

Everything is fried to perfection and not super greasy at all. The spices are very Louisiana and there are three choices of hot sauce which was important to me haha, the only reason I give this place 4 stars is because of my waitress. The name on the receipt was Reagan, she seemed to be bothered by me eating at this place or something. Her attitude made me really uncomfortable and hesitant to ask her for more tartar sauce or anything else.

The potential is through the roof, but there are just so many reasons not to like this place. First the positives: the interior design is really attractive, there is so much light that comes in the 2 walls of windows in the day time (and its even more airy when they open them in the summer), there is huge dancefloor downstairs with booths that would be perfect for a VIP area and they have Sunday Jazz brunch. Unfortunately the negatives are just too much for me to overcome. One: the food is overpriced. I've only been here for brunch and I always love buffets, but the quality of the food is average at best and I recently spent $50 with tip and ONE bloody Mary for TWO people.  I'll take Finnian's in Quincy for brunch, for half the price with better food and selection, any day. Negative number two: this would be the best bar for drinks and dancing in Brighton if the quality of people wasn't so terrible.

I went here for Saturday brunch when a very \\"meh\\" jazz band was playing. We, a party of two, were told there would be a wait of 15 minutes, even though they didn't look busy. In total we waited closer to an hour, but the hostess was apologetic all throughout and provided updates and explanations for the delay.The layout and atmosphere of Beat Hotel is nothing like The Beehive, which I can best describe as \\"intoxicating\\" -- dark, comfortable, and utterly romantic. Beat Hotel has an elongated, partitioned layout that made for a weirdly disconnected and uninviting feeling. Our seating section felt miles away from anyone else in the restaurant and was frankly a little depressing.Beat Hotel's saving grace is that their food is on par with The Beehive's. Only thing I got kind of aggravated with was that they were short-staffed and refused to make substitutions that would accommodate my ridiculous diet. We ended up getting the tandoori chicken wings (UNREAL) and a skirt steak salad that was unique and tasty, with unusual additions like cauliflower that actually worked.But.

A completely empty restaurant always gives me pause, however it really contributed to our waiter being able to be extremely attentive and perfectly responsive. Our meal was coursed perfectly, empty plates removed at the exact moment and new food presented in step. The food was solid, we shared an Involtini di Melanzane (rolled eggplant), tricolore salad, and the Linguine Nere Al Salmone. I was not impressed with the red sauce accompanying the eggplant and despite my love for tomato sauce this made me much happier that the pasta dish would be accompanied with a lobster tomato cream sauce. The Linguine Nere Al Salmone was a star, an interesting salty dish with fresh pasta that was creative and different. The dish carried  the meal among other more average offerings.

We tried both the pepperoni and Vege Alien (vegetable pizza).  Our family pizza expert (my 11 year old) gave the pizza very high marks and begged us to eat there again (which we did).

The review you are about to read (turn back now if you so choose) was written under the influence of an unlimited budget.  For reasons I'll not disclose, I didn't have to think much about cost on my first trip to The Butcher Shop, but honestly it didn't directly influence my rating - it simply gave me the opportunity to try MORE DELICIOUSNESS in one sitting.  Location - South End.  I love the South End.  Great people watching, and large picture windows can only help that cause.  The Butcher Shop feels at the same time rustic and homey.  High class and casual.  Our waiter, Matt, was wonderfully awesome.  We sat down around 3pm and he was holding down the whole place on his own, pretty much.  He was friendly, frequent, and knowledgable about both the wine and food.  What more could you want?  I love meeting new people, waitstaff is no exception.  No one gets a bigger tip than those who make me feel like I leave with a new friend.Okay but lets get to the meat of the story (pun very much intended.  awful, I know).  We started with a bottle of rose and the cheese plate.  Now, Matt actually took the time to read us the list of cheeses they had ($5 each) and explain them one by one, giving us his thoughts when we asked.  We picked 5 and I cheered a little inside my head (yaaaay cheese!).  Then came the \\"bread basket\\".  Bread, butter with what I believe was fleur de sel sprinkled across, and a thin but ample layer of honey in a shallow ramekin.  We were instructed to dip the knife DOWN in the butter, so as to get only a little salt, and then spread the honey across that atop our bread.  Done and done.  Good call Barbara Lynch.As good cheese plates tend to do, this one made me almost flip my shit, and I promptly ended up with a business card listing 3 of my favorites.  Formaggio here I come!  We then moved on, and I had the gazpacho while my dining companion had the buffalo mozzarella.  The gazpacho was really interesting - not very traditional, very heavily spiced with indian spices.  I definitely enjoyed it, though it caught me off guard.I put my order in for the burger just before they stopped serving the lunch menu, to make sure I got to try what had been professed to me to be the best burger in boston.  We got some red wine to go with, and after just the right amount of time had gone by, out came our main courses.  The bf had the tenderloin with a herbed bacon butter and just about fell off his chair when he tried the first bite.  My burger was, indeed, phenomenal.  Cooked PERFECTLY (medium rare thank you) on an amazing bun, with grafton cheddar, bacon, and some delicious house sauce.  I was so sad to be so freakin' full, but I ate as much of that as I possibly could, and melted into a puddle of gluttony with every bite.Alright at this point I feel like I'm typing just to read myself talk, so I'll wrap it up.  We got a pretty amazing chocolate cookie on the house, but lemon curd is one of my favorite things in the history of all food, so I had to go overboard and order dessert.  I was NOT disappointed.  Om nom nom.So, The Butcher Shop is definitely worth it - I would have gladly paid full price for everything we got (though probably would have ordered a bit more modestly).  A little over 4 hours after arriving, we stumbled out into the lovely summer wednesday evening.

We were greeted by a very nice smiling friendly young man. He was also informative & helpful when we were trying to figure out what we wanted to order. So we went for the 1/2 ribs & meat platter (choose brisket) fried yuca, Mexican style grilled corn and 1 pork belly taco. Gotta say biggest mistake was ordering it all to Share!! GET UR OWN TRUST ME! \\nLet's start with Pork belly taco Don't just get 1 get minimum 2! Warm cooked just right pork nested in a soft flour tortilla all dressed up with mandarins special sauce OMG! My mouth was immediately filled with an array of wonderful flavors between saltiness & sweetness awaking my tastebuds to  party! Found myself struggling to put taco down between bites & I heard myself saying over & over OMG! Made my husband a little nervous cause I would not let go of taco! Remember we were \\"SHARING\\"!! When he got a hold of the taco he then began to sound like me!! Then here we go again! Here comes the meat platter & sides. As we glance at each other cause the aroma as reached us we was again start wondering what we were thinking! My hubby so kindly took it upon himself to evenly split the meal up between both of us. The brisket - sliced pieces of melt in your mouth perfection! Tender yet with the surprising small burnt end texture filled with juicy flavor. Not dry at all naked with sauce on the side. It was so well seasoned that the sauce was just an added decoration but not really needed. Best brisket we have had at a BBQ joint. Ribs no where does it say it on their menu but they easy can state it. I picked up a piece and the meat came right off the bone! This too was seasoned just right. Not over powering but enough to compliment & enhance the tender meats flavor.  Mexican corn true to its name. Flavor was on point. Fried yuca these were on but still flavorful.  \\nCan't stress enough only issue we found even thou platter was great portion for sharing, I'm sure each of us would of gladly had our own cause flavors will make u desire more! Let's be honest we were contemplating getting back in line for another pork belly taco but line was long. Then even as we drove away to start our way home we contemplated going back to get some to bring home!! But we were true to ourselves & knew it would never make the 4 hr trip home!

Occasionally, I've been unable to take more than a few sips.

It's a delicious cheese, but I was expecting something more special from a restaurant of this caliber.\\n4. The pot de creme dessert was good, but not really the kind of fireworks one would expect when eating at one of the most expensive and celebrated restaurants in the city.\\n5. Perhaps this isn't fair, but since I saw this place on 'Bizarre Foods', I was expecting some more exotic animal-based fare. Foie gras and chicken liver was as crazy as it got.\\n6. The bathroom is ridiculously dark.\\n7. They charge extra for coffee with dessert. I would not have ordered it if I had known. I doubly regretted ordering the coffee because they brought it out several minutes before the dessert came and the dessert came with a wine pairing.

Please bear in mind my wife lived in NY, and we met in SF, so we're no strangers to small plates, or gastro pubs. The special for the evening was \\"Tuna Confit\\". Think about that for a minute. Tuna...cooked in its own fat? My wife asked about it, the hostess apoligized that the waiter hadn't greeted us yet (after 15 minutes) blushed, laughed, and said \\"well, it's actually cooked in olive oil.\\" Huh. $18 for pan seared tuna. Ok. Waiter finally comes by after our drinks were dry, we order the beggar's purses and the edamame. The edamame was pretty good (pop rocks and Black Sea salt), the \\"beggars purses\\" were just TINY bits of cured ham wrapped around bits of cheese. NO crepe or pastry. At. All. At that point I asked for the check. 15 minutes later I had to track down the waiter (away from the table), and ask for it again. Never going back. I work at Congress and 1st, telling all my co-workers about my pathetic excuse for a dinner. Actually went across the street to Taverna, had a great meal."},{"name":"Cask & Larder","address":"565 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"Overall, this restaurant does a good job of doing a spin on southern food and combining the best flavor a together. Service was quick and friendly.The beer selection was exquisite. They brew all of their beers in house. I particularly enjoyed the almond stout beer.I was disappointed with their cocktails. I asked the waitress for cocktail recommendation but she didn't seem to have a good handling on the cocktails- she recommended the Beer and Sand, which was not very good. The ginger and honey flavor was subtle, and the whisky was not very good nor smoked.We went for happy hour and the biscuits were OK (the sweet and savory component with every bite! Mouth watering prosciutto and sweet jam), and the $1 oysters were delicious and fresh.Then we moved to dinner.The deviled eggs- with every bite there was a delicious vinegary taste--  the crunch of the trout caviar complemented the soft deviled eggs.The smoked chicken wings were so good- the hot peppers and peanuts went well with the smoked, tender meat. So tender.The kale salad was the best I had in the world. The dressing on the side complements the salad with the sweet and crunchy granola, mixed with the soft fatty avocado.The monkfish I would give a 3/5 and I would not order again. While the fish was cooked the perfection, the execution was lacking -- way too salad. The flavor was there, but over powered to the saltiness.\\nThe tamales complemented the okra and walnut sauce very well.The duck I would give a 3/5- while the breast meat was tenderly smoked and cooked perfectly medium rare, the foie gras was a sore disappointment.I was excited to try the foie gras but it was mixed with cornbread and tasted nothing like foie gras. The foie gras was either mixed with too much cornbread, or the sweetness of the bread diluted the flavor.I don't understand why the foie gras was prepared in this way- If I am going to enjoy foie gras, it makes no sense to hide the flavor by munging it with grainy bread.Interesting combinations and a playful, classy deviation from traditional southern food. Just need to fix a few kinks."},{"name":"Pig Floyd's Urban Barbakoa","address":"1326 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Delightful surprise at this place!!!

Boy were we disappointed. There is a major lack of even decent Chinese delivery in the Waterford Lakes area so we had high hopes. We have lived in the area for 15 years and have tried every Chinese delivery in the area. The food here was one of the mushiest and most bland meals we have had...ever. We ordered the house lo mein, general tsos chicken, pork egg rolls and teriyaki chicken. The only even halfway decent thing was the teryaki chicken. The house lo mein was so bad we had to throw it away. It tasted like it had been sitting around for quite a long time. Completely mushy and no flavor whatsoever. Same with the general tsos chicken. Tasteless and mushy. Clearly had been sitting around for a while. Egg rolls were just ok...but again...no flavor. The only Chinese delivery in the area that is decent right now is Tasty China on Curry Ford Rd. We did go to Magic China for years, but it took a major dive in quality so we went looking elsewhere. It seems like every Chinese place in the area is exactly the same. Same food, same menu, same everything. I wish someone would come in the area and open a decent Chinese delivery place.

I tried the grilled chicken tenders (lightly spiced, served on skewers) French fries -too spicy for my husband and drink combo.  We both liked the bourbon sauce. Our entire bill was $28.00. Gave them 4 stars because indoor seating was very limited and shady outdoor seating was very limited and transient.

Well, a few reasons but the first and foremost reason is that the staff rocks. Not only are there a few of my favorite people who jumped from the sinking ship that is Derek Lawford pubs but there are bartenders I've not seen elsewhere who are attentive, friendly, and...wait for it....HAPPY TO SEE YOU!I've been here more times than I can count. Sometimes I sit at the bar, sometimes I get a table, sometimes I go with small groups, sometimes with big and they are always consistent with the level of service and with the deliciousness of their food.The food...let's talk about the food. I absolutely love their salsa verde. It's hotter than anywhere else I've had it (more jalapenos) and that makes me happy. I am not the biggest fan of their chips. I kinda wish they were thinner and less greasy but I'd drink the salsa verde so no chips needed. They have really, really, really good fish tacos and shrimp tacos. I want to like their brisket tacos but they just don't talk to me the way the fish tacos do. That's ok, because I'm happy eating just fish or shrimp tacos from Holy Taco for the rest of my life.Moving onto drinks. Their margaritas are wicked good but just the other day I tried the red sangria and holy taco batman it was kinda brilliant. They also have a pretty decent beer list if that is what floats your boat. Have I mentioned their super nice bartenders? Yes?...well, they are worth mentioning again.Finally, I love the patio. In the Spring time I crave sitting outside of Holy Taco with my friends having a kick ass margarita and people watching.
