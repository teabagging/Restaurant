The waiter recommended the special of the day, Fajitas. I was especially impressed by the variety of sides that Consuelo offers...not just the monotonous rice and beans routine. I tried the Fideo (vermicelli) and Mango+Jicama salad. The vermicelli was kind of like a thick Mexican version of Campbell's chicken noodle soup. That's a compliment, by the way. I'd never had jicama before and found it to be quite crisp and refreshing. One thing I didn't like, however, was that the Chicken Fajitas were a bit bland. The taste completely changed after a sprinkle of salt, though. I loooved the freshness and quality of the ingredients. The portion was not too overwhelming, either. No i-can't-move-for-two-hours food coma afterwards. This left room for dessert. After much consideration, I tried the cheese flan, which was near perfect.

While waiting in line I told my boyfriend if we were given an option of inside or outside I wanted to eat inside.  It wasn't miserably hot, but I had on long sleeves that were totally necessary in the morning and no longer were by 2 o'clock.  I was hot and was looking forward to the AC.  \\nWe finally were able to check in. We were not given a pager, but just told to wait and they would call our name.  The foyer area was very crowded and it was hard to hear, but we heard our name after about 10 minutes and off we went.  They tried to seat us outside.  I immediately protested.  We had passed by 3 empty inside tables.  We had reservations.  I wanted to eat inside.  They acted like it was a lot of trouble, but begrudgingly let us sit inside.  \\nOur server recommended a glass of wine for my boyfriend.  I enjoyed the Aqua Fresca.  It is delicious, but overpriced.  \\nYou have to ask for bread, which is annoying, but it is kind of lackluster anyway.  They give you olive oil for the bread, but it too is lackluster.  I love when they give you flavored olive oil or put some spices on the plate to go with the oil.  Not here.  \\nSo why do I give this place such high marks?  Because I love the food!  The arancini bites are awesome.  It is little balls of risotto that are deep fried and served with marinara sauce.  Yum!\\nTheir spaghetti and meatballs is one of my favorites.  The meatballs are fine, but it is the sauce that I love.  This is my favorite spaghetti sauce anywhere, ever.  It is so good.  It is light, fresh, and perhaps a tad sweet.  I love it!\\nThe pizza is awesome.  This tastes as close as you can get to real Italian pizza.  If you go to Italy, the pizza you eat there is similar to this.  All the ingredients are really fresh tasting.  I love the cheese and basil.  Again, the sauce is really something beautiful.

The sandwiches are longer and the filling is denser than your usual Ba Le or Tung Hing sandwiches, I would guesstimate 1.5x? I had the classic, and while it was good, it wasn't as good as Ba Le or Viet Sub (Viet Sub has that killer sauce that would have been amazing on the sub here).

Shockingly, I haven't reviewed a Thai restaurant. Ever.; and 2.) It was penance for signing up for a Lenten Journey Group focusing on good fitness and diet practices in the season of Lent, and then never showing up. I guess it sounds awful that I usually had something better to do on Wednesday evenings, but it's the truth. I figured I already killed myself at the gym trying to fit into secular society's rigid ideals of physical attractiveness, and that the added pressure of God and Jesus in the mix would just be too much for me to process. \\n\\nAnyways, I walked up and down Congress, and passed the Stephen F. two times, until i realized the place was across from the art museum facing 7th Street, and not on Congress proper. OK, I'm giving myself too much credit; I had to call the restaurant and ask for directions. Whatever. I found the place.\\n\\nMy friend Amy is the Young Adult coordinator of St. David's, and she was the first to arrive with another girl from the church. (Just a note: I would have signed up for HER Journey Group, but it was held on Sunday evenings this year, when it was a known fact I'd probably be mimosa'd out of my mind by then. I think these are the exact words I used when explaining this to her.) Our smiling hostess seated the three of us while we waited for the others. \\n\\nI was picturing a tiny little place downtown, but Thai Passion actually has a nice, open space to its credit. According to their website, the art on the walls is that of the owner, Gene Kobboon. It's comfortable and inviting, and not at all the rushed, crowded downtown venue I had imagined (although they were filling a lot of take out orders). \\n\\nOnce the seven of us were assembled, I ordered the passion roll (Vegetarian deep-fried spring rolls with crystal bean thread, chinese mushroom, carrots, cabbage and served with Thai sweet & sour sauce) as an appetizer, and by default, everyone was given a Thai salad with peanut dressing as a starter. Half the table, including me, though the Wednesday Curry of the Day--Thai yellow curry with potatoes, carrots, bell peppers, and onions in coconut milk--sounded like a good plan, while the other half opted for the pud ped with chicken or tofu. \\n\\nThe curry was amazing: creamy, with large chunks of chicken and just the right amount of spice. The menu denotes it with two peppers as \\"Hot\\", but I found it somewhere between mild, and the \\"hot\\" I was expecting. Still, it was delicious, and a good lunch portion. When I went to snap a photo, one of the guys pointed in a mock-accusatory fashion and yelled \\"Foodie!\\" Luckily, I had explained to all of them about Yelp, and that I wasn't just a weirdo who took random photos of food. Actually, Amy seemed relieved to know the details on the Yelp subculture, as she finally realized what all the fuss was about when I would check into places on Facebook, post reviews, and attend Yelp events. I even told her to check out my Yelp review of the church. Before that, I can only imagine what she thought I was doing. Thankfully, I was able to educate her, and I can now breath a little easier knowing the woman who sometimes gives me the Body of Christ at the communion rail can do so without thinking I'm some sort of random, unhinged psychotic food hobbyist.      \\n\\nAs I enjoyed my curry, we talked about things Episcopalians talk about. Namely conferences, retreats, and how badass we are compared to other Episcopal churches across the country. It was nice getting to know people around my age who I normally don't talk to much during Sunday service, and I'm sure it was eye-opening for them to meet me. At least the part where I asked Amy if we could hold the next \\"Theology On Tap\\" gathering at Oil Can Harry's, where \\"we could talk about the Bible and then dance on a box\\" gave them some insight. I *think* they knew I was joking. I hope.\\n\\nI hate to mention this, but the passion rolls were never brought out. I'm sure it was just a simple misunderstanding, and I emphasize that in no way did this reflect on my overall opinion of the restaurant. As Amy said \\"Be nice, Nathan; we like this place\\". I completely agree. I'll try them next time.\\n\\nLunch was refreshingly affordable as well, which is always a welcome surprise. I thanked Amy for organizing the lunch, and told her I need to attend more of them. I also told her I felt that next time, Jesus could at least chip in on the tab, if not take care of the whole thing. I mean, when two or more of us are gathered in His name, He automatically shows up, right? You think He might contribute a little. Then I reminded myself He already paid for our sins on the mother of all Amex cards, so I suppose we could call it even. And I won't be sent to Hell for blasphemy. \\n\\nAnywhozlebees...Thai Passion is a delightful little place.\\n\\n4 Stars."},{"name":"Rontoms","address":"600 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is huge.

And these were earned by the selection of Tequila behind the bar. \\n\\nThe food was atrocious, overpriced, and completely lacking in quality.  I think the main attraction here is the happy hour, which apparently never ends.\\n\\nThe Food - Think Pancho's without the buffet.  We ordered Pescado Veracruz, (Red Snapper with Veracruz sauce) a fish dish that was advertised as being authentic right down to the capers and peppers.  LOL!  No capers could be found, but judging by the gross amount of olives in the dish, we figured they were trying to fool people into thinking olives and capers are synonymous.  The \\"snapper fillet\\" was a pile of fish mush that tasted like it had been in the freezer way too long.  The Veracruz sauce was completely unremarkable and bland.  It lacked the zesty, tomato-caper punch of a real VC sauce. The dish was accompanied by a spoonful of rice and Borracho Beans.  Very skimpy portions. The cup of beans was only half full, and it was a CUP.\\n\\nAtmosphere - This is the kind of place I loved as a kid...but as an adult? Not so much.\\n\\nService - Was very good.\\n\\nThe bar - Lot's of different Tequila shooters, Margaritas and mixers.  Sorry, but I prefer my tequila naked, without the usual dose of sweetened \\"whatever\\" in it. The Tequila selection was awesome, but didn't make up for the food.  \\n\\nOn second thought, you could drink until you forgot how lousy the meal was!\\n\\nLOL!\\n\\nInterestingly, the menu is very broad and has a lot of great-sounding dishes on it.

Auburn Street","city":"Watertown","stars":"4","text":"Happy hour: Sushi Bonanza!  The $1/piece nigiri deal is a great value but I can't say that the sushi is amazingly fresh or remarkably creative.  My friends and I got the \\"B\\" course with 40 pieces of nigiri and 3 rolls of maki for $40.  \\n\\nAs I walked in, I was a little put off by the dripping A/C.  Like a typical neighborhood sushi joint, the decoration is pretty tacky and weird...like the dried blowfish dangling over the sushi bar.  We waited a good ten minutes or so for a table because happy hour flourishes at Sushi 21.\\n\\nThe beauty of ordering sushi is in the small quantities...appreciating the different textures and tastes of the various morsels of rice and fish.  The following is an itemized account of the variety of different nigiri I tried on my visit to Sushi 21 yesterday:\\n\\nSake (Salmon) - I don't blame Sushi 21 for making the slices of nigiri so razor thin because of the prices, but I'd rather have paid a little more not to see the healthy dab of green wasabi through the sliver of salmon.  I don't know if I actually tasted the salmon because of the overwhelming quantity of rice and wasabi.\\n\\nMaguro (Tuna) - Pleasingly smooth texture and great taste.  The color was a beautiful bing cherry red.\\n\\nIka (Squid) - The reason I order ika is for the mesmerizingly milky and chewy quality.  Unfortunately,  the ika was too tough and tasteless.\\n\\nTako (Octopus) - Very tough.\\n\\nIkura (Salmon roe) - Salty and fishy which is usually how it goes.\\n\\nHamachi (Yellowtail) - Good.  Nothing distinctive.\\n\\nEbi (Shrimp) - The nigiri kept falling apart because of the overwhelming rice to fish ratio. \\n\\nTobiko (Flying Fish Roe) - Very good.  I love the texture of tobiko, little beads swirling around...yummy.\\n\\nSpicy Salmon Maki - This was such a boring roll.  I think if they used more avocado then it would help pull out the flavor of the salmon because I couldn't distinguish the taste of the salmon from the cucumber, avocado, or rice.\\n\\nOne of my friends, who doesn't eat sushi, got brocolli which she thought was awesome.  \\"They did something to it, it's really good!\\"  I thought it was unusual how they brought it out like an appetizer when all she ordered was broccoli and rice.  So she ended up feasting on soy sauce and rice while the rest of us overdosed on sushi.\\n\\nThe service was attentive, very warm and friendly.  They're actually Japanese which is surprising because alot of Japanese/sushi places aren't run by Japanese people.  Our waiter recommended the Sapporo for my friend saying he was partial because that was his home town.  Cute.  \\n\\nOh and they don't offer bottled water, just tap.

But this time, we were left to stand by the door while our table was prepared and then after more waiting we experienced a revolving door of servers.  First was a suited gentleman who we later figured out was the sommelier.  He warmly welcomed us and promised to explain the menu but then suddenly said \\"I'll be right back\\" and never returned.  We would see him at nearby tables but he avoided us like the plague Then a waiter appeared with small glasses of wine but he too disappeared and a bit later a third waiter appeared who actually explained the menu.  Then the first waiter (second person) returned to take our order and he was both competent and caring.  But in between an assortment of other waiters would appear and disappear.  It took ten minutes for us to be offered bread though after that our bread plate was refreshed flawlessly.  The food as before was creative and exquisite but still not absolutely perfect.  We both ordered the salmon anti-pasta but one serving was missing a dollop of sauce that added to the pleasure of this wonderful dish.  We shared.  And the olive torte was rather dry.

All the ingredients are from Italy and the water used in the dough is from Pennsylvania.  It is as close to the pizza in Napoli that you can get.

I will NEVER go back. I made a reservation for my fianc√©e's birthday dinner (Sunday, June 8) weeks ahead of schedule--noting we were celebrating, it was a special occasion, and had requested a nice table if available. We were shown to a table right next to the kitchen doors and server station. Despite a handful of servers standing around the computer station right next to us, we were seated nearly ten minutes before we were even offered water. When we were, the male server was curt and unfriendly. He poured our water with an attitude and disappeared for another five to ten minutes. When he came back finally, he opened his book and asked what we wanted, ready to write an order. He didn't offer specials or go over the menu. We gave him our pre dinner drink order and he walked away. Another five minutes later and an older female server came over with the most violent scowl on her face. She literally did not even acknowledge us or say hello. I honestly couldn't even believe she didn't even say hello. She stormed over, dropped glasses down, and proceeded to open my $20+ split of champagne-- directing the cork towards my face. Yes, it was a split and thus not as powerful as a larger bottle of champagne, but rule number one to opening champagne is to ALWAYS keep the cork away from anyone's face/eyes. It would have been better still to have had a cloth napkin to cover it as a protective buffer. Nope- she clearly didn't give two hoots about safety or service. My fianc√©e was horrified. A short while later, our server came back and again curtly asked what we wanted for dinner. We very politely gave our order, and ordered a relatively nice bottle of wine ($100). When the male server came back and dropped two VERY dirty, wet, and hot wine glasses (pieces of citrus were clearly stuck to the insides of the glass), my fianc√©e was about ready to snap. I was so embarrassed as I had made the reservation and it was his special evening I was treating him to. I excused myself, found a manager (Gerry), and explained the situation, asking for help in correcting these grave fundamental service errors. He apologized and said he would get to the bottom of it. I returned to my table after having gone downstairs for some air only to find the same dirty wine glasses on the table, along with dirty plates. No one had done anything to resolve the situation. After sitting, the male server came over once again to very unapologetically say that they did not have the wine I had ordered. My fianc√©e and I were so annoyed not only at the extreme lack of care given to our table, but also the flagrant disrespect AND the dangerous manner with which that attitude ridden female server conducted herself in opening a bottle of champagne. I was so embarrassed nothing had seemed to be done about the situation even after speaking to the manager about it, that I felt that we would have been better starting our evening over elsewhere and supporting a more worthy business. We told the server we wanted to cancel our entree orders and to just get the check and leave. Of course, right at that moment, the manager Gerry walked over and had the bottle of wine we had ordered and seemed flummoxed that we were intent on leaving. He kept saying that they maintain a very high quality of service and that he was sorry that ours was an anomaly. After insisting on leaving and asking for the check, Gerry apologized and took care of our two drinks and appetizers. We left with that malicious looking female server glaring at us as we walked away. That female server looked like she wanted to literally hurt us--and she may very well have, had that cork popped open into my eyes.

We thought it might be a good idea to get there early, in case the young lovers were out in force ( but honestly, does anyone have a romantic dinner at a Brewery?).  I don't think we needed to bother...the restaurant was virtually empty.  We asked to be seated in a booth, but the waitress said that the server in charge of booths hadn't arrived yet and therefore we had to sit at a table.  Everyone else at the restaurant was sitting at a booth, however, so we pointed this out and were grudgingly seated in a booth.  I mean, WTF?\\n\\nOur waitress sucked.  She should really be working at Old Navy or something that doesn't require  much customer service.  For one thing, she couldn't stop moving or look us in the eye.  For another, she didn't know how much an 8 oz beer costs and made no move to find out.  I suspect she was pissed that she had to come serve us in that damn booth, because she really made no effort to make us feel welcome.\\n\\nWhat about the food?  The BF got a burger and side salad.  He made the special request for the pickle (as advised in the menu...you have to REQUEST a pickle).  No pickle.  I guess you can ask, but that doesn't mean you will get one.  \\"All pickle requests considered on a case by case basis.\\"   We did not deserve the pickle...  To be fair, the burger was cooked medium, as requested.  The BF didn't really like the bun much, but he said the meat was good.  I got the steak sandwich.  I liked it a lot, but got a few pieces of gristly beef.

Wonderfully prepared and flavorful and just enough food for four people given the starters. We also saw an incredible beef bone dish at a nearby table that is high on my list for the next time we come here!\\n\\nFor dessert, the kitchen kindly sent out an extra cinnamon donut (normally an order of 3 but we got 4) - the perfect, sweet and chewy cap to the evening.

I took a friend here as a birthday present.  First thing I will mention is that they keep the temperature in here surprisingly chilly, uncomfortably so even in jeans and a polo shirt.  People at adjoining tables were saying the same thing, so it wasn't just us.  Wear a sweater/jacket, and be prepared to eat each course quickly because the food does not stay warm long.\\n\\nOur waiter seemed new and nervous, but his wine recommendation based on my description of what I liked was accurate (a rare thing, so I was happy about this).\\n\\nWe started with a dish of the olives, and by chance they happened to be my favorite, Castelvetranos.  The oil had clearly been infused with herbs (sage?), which although pleasant was just a tad obtrusive to the simple pleasure of the olives themselves.  The fennel oil that The Kitchen uses is better matched, and frankly I just prefer them plain from the Whole Foods olive bar, since these olives by themselves are most beautiful without augmentation.  The bread came out around the same time, and a truly delightful bread it is...great crust and great internal texture and tang.\\n\\nMy antipasto was the calamari.  This was the least impressive dish of the night (besides the dessert)...it was rather plain and unremarkable.  Would not order it again.  My friend got the beets, which was more art than food...a couple small cubes of beets and rhubarb with some smears of red and orange paste/sauce.\\n\\nFor first course, we split the \\"risotto for the table\\", which couldn't have been smaller portions.  While the aroma and harmonization of flavors was quite nice, it was almost like soup (and was indeed served with spoons).  Rice texture was good.  And although described as a seafood risotto with shrimp, clams, and such, don't expect to see any of the seafood...it's all been minced into tiny bits.  Only about 6 to 8 spoonfuls per person.  At this point we were both still quite hungry.\\n\\nAlas, the second course was almost as small.  Small portions are a rule of thumb with \\"fine dining\\", no doubt, but every course here is more like tapas/nibbles.  Expect to leave only barely sated.  That aside, mine was the lamb, and my friend's the cod.  Both were quite enjoyable and harmonized...subtle, but reasonably complex and well-cooked.\\n\\nAbout the time our second course was served, our waiter ignored us for quite a long time.  My friend wanted another piece of bread and was trying to get the attention of anyone who might help, but ended up completely finishing his course before anyone came over.  We could see our waiter at other tables, but he had apparently forgotten us.  On top of that, as my friend was starting to pour himself more water (with bottle already in hand), another waiter came over and literally wrested the bottle from his hand!  So awkward and so rude!  I appreciate his wanting to serve us, but yanking a water bottle out of a customer's hand is so ridiculously wrong on every level.  For what ended up being $125 a person, neither of these gaffes should have happened.\\n\\nSo, a difficult experience to rate.  The service seems professional on the surface, but clearly they are not as well-trained as a place like this would suggest.  The food is good but far from awesome.  Overall it was a nice experience and my friend was very thankful, but we both had much higher expectations based on the reputation and prices.  Sadly, Frasca doesn't go the distance.

I'm not use to having African inspired food so it is hard for me to describe the flavor of the spices used on the flatbread but it was good.  \\n\\nMy entree was the spicy Botswana style \\"Seswaa\\" beef short rib.

The ribs were overpowered by the smoke flavor. It was too strong for the mild flavors of the sauces they offered.  We tried the mild and the hot-n-spicy one (at the suggestion of the waiter, after mentioning the blandness of the first one) and neither one really tasted all that great. The spicy one had a kick, but it was just heat, not flavor. As far as the sides went the cole slaw was just ok. DH said the beans were awesome. The sweet tea was kind of weird. DH said it tasted like sugar water mixed with a little bit of tea, and I thought it tasted like sweet wheat bread (I don't know). We had no problems with the service.

We went on a weekday at the end of May and right when it opened so we got seated right away without waiting/reservation. Service was great as with all disney restaurants we've gone to and of course buffet was pricey. With tax and tip for two the bill was close to $100. I go to a lot of vegas buffets (wicked spoon, bellagio, rio) so for the price you aren't going to get the same spread or variety as a vegas buffets but I still think Boma is worth it. My favorites were the soups (oxtail soup was my favorite and very homey tasting), African fruit salad (reminded me of something I get at Filipino restaurants), desserts (cassava and a guava cream dessert were two stand outs for me), the jungle juice (which is basically POG), and oddly really liked their wrapped mini hot dogs (which isn't authentic african cuisine but I went back for seconds). Since it was our first time at Disney, we decided to do the cult favorite restaurants and this place was one of them for good reason. It was a great atmosphere to sit and chat and take your time trying the variety of food. We spent almost 2 and a half hours there sipping on jungle juice and digesting our feast, and it was a great break before we hit a long night at Magic Kingdom. I'd recommend the food, but more so the experience for first timers.

As a fan of Beauty and the Beast, I decided to pay a visit anyways because while most things at the Magic Kingdom is almost identical to Disneyland in Anaheim, this is one thing you will NOT find there. \\n\\nAt first I tried making reservations for dinner, but since you literally have to call at least 2 months ahead, all reservations were filled so we opted for the first-come-first-serve lunch. It starts at 10:30am and I recommend you get there a little beforehand. My boyfriend and I got there at 11:15am, thinking \\"just who is going to wait in a line for lunch when kids are usually here for rides?\\", little did I know, I was foolishly wrong. The line was comparable to a short ride (around 20-30min). I believe you can actually FastPast+ this restaurant, but I didn't see the point, as it seemed like the people who chose this as their fast pass still stood in the same line before you get into the castle, but just a shorter wait once you arrive in the castle itself. The difference was probably less than 15 minutes or so on the day we were there. \\n\\nThis entire experience was just magical. The castle was located at the back end of Fantasyland, and literally looked like the Beast's castle from the story. The sculptures outside, and the decor inside also mirrored the movie exactly and looked absolutely STUNNING. There were 3 separate rooms to choose from: 1) The dark beast room with the falling rose 2) The beast's castle's main dining room where Belle and the Beast actually dines together in the move 3) A room not from the movie, but filled with framed pictures of Belle and the Beast and a rotating sculpture of them two dancing \\n\\nAfter standing in line, you order the food with an attendant at the door, in which you are handed a red plastic rose tracker or your order number is scanned onto your Magic Band. You are free to choose which ever room you desire, and the food is brought to your table while you fill your own drinks. \\n\\nWe ordered...\\n\\n1) Vegetable Quiche: Light and fluffy, not as salty and heavy like your traditional quiche but extremely tasty!\\n\\n2) French Onion Soup: MMMM SO GOOOOD! Again, unlike some restaurant that makes terribly salty French Onion Soup, this soup was well seasoned and delicious! The cheese was marvelous and the soup actually came piping hot!\\n\\n3) Roast Beef Sandwich: The bread was lightly toasted with garlic spread, and the roast beef was so perfect with the horse radish sauce. Highly recommend also!\\n\\n4) Strawberry Cream Cheese Cupcake: Too sweet with the frosting, but when scraped off, it wasn't too bad. The cake was very fluffy, more like a pound cake texture, but it was a great way to end the meal.\\n\\nEverything about Be Our Guest was exceptionally unforgettable, from the details of the architecture to the interior design, and from the well-imbedding of the story into the restaurant and the food itself.

I have had this dish several times, and have been happy every time except once - when for some reason they cut the spice and vinegar to a non-noticable level, added a bit too much corn starch, and it was a bit bland (I thought I had come to a different restaurant that was catering primarily to Canadian tastes that day!).

Man, it's like you're a cloudy jelly bean in the Jelly Belly factory, and you're moving so quickly on the conveyor belt that you're wondering if you'll end up in a lovely gift box or in the reject pile to be bagged and branded as a belly flop. Which jelly bean was I? \\n\\nIn this hallucinogenic scenario, I think Jamie W. and I probably need to go back into the sugar mix machine and get re-flavored. Our first challenge was sorting through the four menus that were piled high on our table. The endless selection of dishes was mind-boggling, and I could well imagine Vancouverite regulars coming back time and again trying to find the true \\"get\\" dishes on the menu. We saw some pass by after we ordered and sighed regretfully at our ignorance of the possible culinary pleasures to be had here. \\n\\nInstead, we went a more predictable route and ordered a dozen Pan-Fried Potstickers with Pork for C$6.55 (see photo). While they were indeed crispy on the bottom as expected, there was an inordinate amount of grease in the wrapper. Naturally, that didn't stop us from gobbling them down in quick order. The next dish we had was the C$7.95 Wide-Egg Noodle with Ginger, Green Onion Juliennes and BBQ Pork (See photo). For some reason, I was expecting a chow fun noodle, but it was more like re-purposed fettuccine marinated in soy sauce. Pretty good actually if a bit too wet for my taste. The pork pieces and bean sprouts added nice texture though. \\n\\nThe last dish was clearly the best, the C$10.50 Deep-Fried Chicken with Black Pepper Sauce and Broccoli (see photo). We had reason to suspect it would be the best since there was a big picture of it on the laminated Specials menu. The sliced chicken was panko-encrusted with a nice light sauce, and the florets were cooked to the right tender crispiness. That one was worth getting again. The service was on automatic pilot, but it was definitely consistent as we were all numbers to the buzz saw staff. \\n\\nFOOD - 3 stars...miles and miles of Cantonese dishes in all sorts of variations, just hard to nail what are the standouts \\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...kinda like a big prison cafeteria with decor courtesy of Pier One \\nSERVICE - 3 stars...I'm a good jelly bean, I'm a good jelly bean! \\nTOTAL - 3 stars...a solid bargain and time-saver for above-grade Cantonese food"},{"name":"Borgata Pizza Cafe","address":"2285 W Dublin Granville Rd, Ste 113","city":"Worthington","stars":"4","text":"A little busy right now because it just opened.

But really it's a mash-up of mediocre copy-catted NYC soba places, ranging from cocoron (the dip sobas) and soba-ya. \\n\\nThis would not be a problem if the food were good. However It's really mediocre. The menu items range from greasy & heavy (the scallop & imitation crab meat smothered in mayo) to OK (the tamago yaki was pretty good). What is really disappointing is the soba noodles themselves. One, the noodles are round-edged, makes me suspect they are potentially machine-pressed. The short cut is fine, but why round? This changes the mouth feel of the noodles. More critically, two, I couldn't taste the buckwheat flavor -- which is consistent with the fact that the texture is too chewy to have a significant amount of buckwheat. \\n\\nSoba should be really about the fragrant noodles with the subtle flavor and taste of buckwheat. The grain gives the noodles a very light texture that cuts through very easily. For a place that bills itself as a traditional Japanese soba place (although ya lost me at \\"Baby hamachi jalapeno,\\" to be honest), the soba itself comes up nowhere near the definition of soba."},{"name":"62 Restaurant and Wine Bar","address":"Pickering Wharf, 62 Wharf St","city":"Salem","stars":"4.5","text":"I'm a big fan of 62.

The place has a great atmosphere, good natural lighting, and looks like a very \\"breakfasty\\" place. I like that in Columbus, the servers are from different backgrounds and ethnicities, and this was apparent in Grand day cafe too. In Pittsburgh, where I'm from, especially in Shadyside, East Liberty and more gentrified areas, there seems to be a significant problem with aversive racism, where the restaurants are ethnic owned, or have ethnic people in the kitchen and white, hipster servers in western decorated establishments and during my time in Columbus, I've come to really appreciate that the hiring bias for front end jobs towards young white people is less prevalent here. The place was clean. My waitress was lukewarm, but maybe she was having a bad day, and still earned her tip.\\n\\nUnfortunately, my reviews ultimately rest on food quality. I believe that there is nothing wrong with the cooks in the back, as the food is prepared well. The hash browns were done nicely, the eggs were cooked right, the coffee was fine. I think the problem lies with the ingredients. \\n\\nA recurring problem I've had with breakfast places is the use of margarine. Obviously, if you are deep frying hash browns or fries, you have to take the cost of ingredients into account and use peanut oil, but the little things, like serving fresh, good quality bread (that isn't wonderbread) with real butter, or at least the choice of butter or margarine, really matter. A lot of establishments use margarine and think that it won't make a difference and that customers won't notice, but it does, and I do! You can easily taste the difference, and what could have been a great breakfast is reduced to a very mediocre one. Everything had an inescapable margarine aftertaste. While I try to be objective as a customer, when these establishments serve things cooked in margarine, I feel like they do a disservice to not only the customer, but to themselves and the cooks who aren't able to prepare their food to be at it's best, through no fault of their own.\\n\\nTo remedy the food, Grand day cafe should use real butter, or at least give their customers the choice of which fat to use. Butter is expensive, but at $10 a plate, I'm sure Grand Day cafe can make it work. I'll even pay the real butter markup.

The interior looks like an old-school church dining room. In fact, it probably was a church or something before it turned into Zyka and a Montessori. I don't even know if the Montessori is open, but I saw the sign for it. Man those students must be lucky to have Zyka in the same building. I wonder if that's all they eat for school lunches? Those students are so lucky. \\n\\nThe plates are also styrofoam, and the utensils are plastic. Sure it's not fancy, but I like the simple and low-cost looks of the place. As long as the food was good, who cares?\\n\\nThe food was good. I liked everything I had. Like most Indian restaurants, the portions look small, but they're heavy. Don't go too crazy on ordering because all their dishes are filling. \\n\\nMy favorites were Nahari, the Biryani, Chicken 65, and Kadhai Keema. The Nahari had a great savory flavor. It's interesting because it's one of the few beef Indian dishes you'll see. I also loved the heat coming from it. \\n\\nThe Biryani doesn't look pretty. But it's so good. The rice and the meat were cooked well. \\n\\nThe Kadhai Keema is ground goat. It is also flavorful and delicious. \\n\\nThe chicken 65 was probably my favorite. It's basically chicken nuggets, but better. The chicken was cooked perfectly with a nice crispiness. And the flavors were on point. \\n\\nTheir naan is great too. I love seeing naan coming out all fluffy with plenty of heat blisters. It was so buttery and good. One order of naan is for one person. So make sure to order plenty  of it. \\n\\nZyka is probably one of my favorite Indian restaurants. It's not fancy, but the food tastes great and makes me crave it more."},{"name":"Starlight Casino","address":"350 Gifford Street","city":"New Westminster","stars":"2.5","text":"After dinner at the Boathouse, my bf took me dancing at the Starlight Casino RedBar Lounge. During dinner, I had mentioned twice that I felt like dancing after dinner and he said something that didn't seem to elude that we were going to go. When he drove across the Queensburough Bridge, I thought he had gone the wrong way when he was going to take me home. We ended up at the Casino and it still didn't click to me that we were going to go dancing until we approached RedBar Lounge. The bf told me that he had planned the night to take me to listen to live music since I love listening to live music! \\n\\nThere was a live band going on called the Luv Shak and they played awesomely well. From rock to pop to ultra classic songs, Luv Shak was able to lure a large crowd onto the dance floor. We ordered some drinks and left our belongings at a table that we shared with a man who was in his late 40's. He kept staring at us (likes to people watch or couple watch to be more specific) so when our drinks finally arrived, we took one sip and dashed to the dance floor to avoid the awkward stare. \\n\\nThe group of people on the dance floor were from their early 40's to their late 60's and let me tell you, some knew how to boogy down! They looked like they were having fun with the music and this made the environment amazing! You have people doing the jives, line dancing, disco dancing, etc. - it was just fantastic!!

LOL\\n\\n-----------------------\\nlynne h.'s comment on your review:\\nCalling to state you were going to be one half hour late would have assured your table...as far as the waitress...I know they opened your wine ...but they state you were not there for an hour....they told me 20 minutes...as far as ridiculous....I must be to own a restaurant!\\n\\n-----------------------\\nMY RESPONSE:\\nLynne,\\n\\nSince you are very adamant about continuing to justify the way my group was treated in your establishment, I will add a few more details as to why I'm very upset with your staff and business.  First of all, we were there sitting at the table for an hour waiting for service not 20 minutes.  We asked several times when we were going to get a waitress and the same answer was \\"your waitress will be coming momentarily\\" every time.  If you call an hour \\"momentarily\\" then by all means I apologize for being so upset.  Also, regarding the wine comment you made; yes it was opened but it was not served to us (in the past times I've been there the wine has been opened and served), we just kept it on the table waiting for bread and for a staff member to take our appetizer order.  So, there really is no relevance to your comment about the wine since we were swiftly dismissed from your restaurant after we expressed disappointment in the service and said we were leaving for lack of attention.  \\n\\nFrom your comments, I can only come to the conclusion that you are extremely unprofessional and lack any form of education in business ethics since you cannot even bring yourself to at least apologize for your staff's behavior instead of trying to accuse me (a paying customer) as a liar.  I'm even more amazed that you keep coming back with more RIDICULOUS (yes I'll say it again) excuses as to why your staff treated my group with so much discrimination and rudeness. To not lose customers is OBVIOUSLY important for a business, but when you act like you don't care and you come on this site to lie about what happened, it really shows how good of a business owner you are. \\n\\nI'm entitled to my opinion and the point of writing reviews is to state your experience with any given establishment.  If you don't like that I'm stating my negative experience in your restaurant, then I suggest you lighten up and start treating your paying customers with a little more respect and courtesy instead of acting like an adolescent who did something wrong and is trying to justify the wrong behavior.\\n\\nThat is all I have to say about this matter.  If you don't agree with it and still refuse to acknowledge the discrimination we experienced in your establishment, then that is just too unfortunate.\\n\\n-------------\\nlynne h.'s comment on your review:\\nYes I am stupid.. I will make sure your feet are rubbed when I see you out and about because your the CUSTOMER and you are ALWAYS RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!NOT"},{"name":"Frasca Food and Wine","address":"1738 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"A very nice anniversary dinner this weekend.

Overall the service was good but we had 4 waiters/waitresses all come at different times which was okay and attentive but odd.   Either way our waitress was very patient and pleasant, made one error and that was with our coffee but not a big deal.  It is very loud here so I can see how it would be hard to hear.  \\n\\nSo my disappointment came with the fact that everyone working here was from Italy (otherwise they're really good actors).  Basing it on the fact they're all Italian I would have expected better food quality.   The pizza was good, dough little salty, cheese good quality, sauce I couldn't taste it as the taste was hidden by the other ingredients but I'm assuming it had to be San Marzano tomatoes.   Overall pizza was 6.5/7 out of 10.   Italians pride themselves on the freshness and quality of food and it should be simple.  Yes, they are catering to North Americans who have a different idea of Italian food most of the time so I'll cut them some slack.   \\n\\nCalamari was fresh but would have been nice to have been served on a bed of fresh greens vs. spicy tomato sauce with dried chilli flakes on top.   \\n\\nMy wine was not drinkable.  So no comment there.  Coffee and this is an important one for any Italian and me.   My espresso arrived cold.  Like fridge cold.

Once we chose a bird-dropping-free table, our waiter greeted us and brought us our beverages along with complimentary chips and salsa.  The chips lacked salt and the salsa tasted like tomato water - emphasis on \\"water.\\"  Thankfully, my main course - chicken chimichanga- was more flavorful.  The chimichanga was covered in a yummy white cheese sauce and the meat was pretty tasty, but -like the tortilla chips - would've benefited from a pinch of salt.  The refried beans were pretty standard, but tasted better when I dipped them in the cheese sauce that was oozing off the chimichanga (I'm pretty sure that cheese sauce can make anything taste better!).  \\n\\nIn terms of our service, our waiter was okay - nothing out of the ordinary- but stopped offering us refills on our water after we paid our bill and we were there a good hour afterwards just catching up."},{"name":"Chart House","address":"60 Long Wharf","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I went here for a company dinner and loved every moment of it.

Took our seats and was immediately brought filtered water in a chilled wine bottle. She gave us great suggestions on items and was willing to alter and personalize rolls. We tried the Dragon roll, rainbow roll(altered) and a combo platter of California roll, sushi, n gyoza. All of it was prepared wonderfully and beautifully. Some of the best tasting sushi I've ever had. And by far one of the best customer service experiences I've ever had. When we were done, she went out of her way to surprise us with a dessert.

Came for dinner, and the look is comfortable country.  First, I love the open airiness of the high ceiling.  The high ceiling really opens up the space, and gives a real grandness to the area.  Long wood tables, bare white walls, a chalkboard behind the bar, I was surprised that given how simple it looks, CC still exudes a quiet confidence, sophisticated and refined.  \\n\\nWe had popcorn and wings for starters, and while it sounds usual, CC added a little something to each that was an excellent addition.  The popcorn had pimenton, which is a spicy paprika, and given how tasty the popcorn already was, that spice made it a finger food hard to stop eating.  The wings had a pomengrate and orange glaze too that was irresistible.\\n\\nFor the meal, I wanted to experience something of the Northwest, so I went with the Trout.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  Anyhow, the trout was a little overcooked and a bit chewy, but was in a fennel vinaigrette that helped compensate the taste.  With some roasted root vegetables and mussels on the side, in the end, I enjoyed how the individual items came together for one satisfying harmonizing taste.

I had missed it several times before since it does usually require a reservation in advance.\\n\\nIt was opening weekend of Pandora - The World of Avatar. I thought a nice dinner before our extra magic hours would be great! ¬†We arrived right on time for our reservation, after a quick change to meet the dress code. Most of the Signature Dining experiences have a dress code so be sure to check it out first. From Disney's website:\\n\\nMen may wear khakis, slacks, jeans or dress shorts and collared shirts. Sport coats are optional.\\nWomen may wear capri pants, skirts, dresses, jeans or dress shorts.\\nNot permitted in the dining room are tank tops, swimsuits, swimsuit cover-ups, hats for gentlemen, cut-offs, torn clothing and shirts with offensive language or graphics.\\n\\nLocation\\nJiko is located in the Animal Kingdom Lodge. The main lobby is one of my favorites at Walt Disney World. After entering the lobby, there is a large staircase to the right. Both Boma and Jiko are on the bottom floor.\\n\\nReservations\\nI highly recommend making reservations for Jiko ahead of time. To get a normal dinner time (6-7pm) for a group of 4, I would book at least 2-3 days in advance. It isn't a place that requires a 180 days advance, but it is also fairly popular during the same week. ¬†You can book a reservation a few ways:\\n\\nDisney Dining Reservations :¬†(407) 939-1947\\nWebsite\\nMyDisneyExperience App\\n\\nFood\\nNow for the good stuff! Jiko is one of the highest rated restaurants at Disney World. It's currently rated #17 in all of Orlando on TripAdvisor. Jiko means \\"the cooking place\\", and in addition to appetizers, there are several options for shareable menu items. It would actually be a great place to join with friends and share several appetizers or other small plates from the cooking place.\\n\\nFrom The Cooking Place\\nWe chose the Taste of Africa, an assortment of¬†African-inspired Dips, Pappadum, Sesame Fatir, House-made Flax Seed Naan. The kids actually enjoyed this one a lot as well.  We enjoyed the mango dip the best on our Taste of Africa sampler.\\n\\nEntrees\\nWe wanted to try some of the more exotic menu items and opted for the¬†Durham Ranch Elk Loin and¬†Botswana-style Seswaa Beef Short Rib. ¬†The Beef Short Rib was delicious, but the Cassava-Potato Pur√©e really made the dish. Our kids were not quite as adventurous and went for the Macaroni & Cheese. ¬†Everything was absolutely delicious. I doubt anything on the menu would disappoint.\\n\\nDessert\\nWe did not personally order any of the desserts, but I heard rave reviews fro fellow diners about the Kilimanjaro, a¬†Tanzanian Chocolate Mousse, Pistachio Financier, Pink Peppercorn Meringue, Cacao Nib Crunch, Ras el Hanout Pineapples.\\n\\nSummary\\nWe really enjoyed our time at Jiko. If you haven't eaten here, it should be on your Disney Dining short list. If you are using a dining plan, it will take 2 credits. We chose to use our Annual Passholder discount to get 20% off of the meal instead. \\n\\nTo make the most out of your visit:\\nGet a reservation. 2-3 days in advance is enough time to get a decent reservation\\nReview the dress code to avoid last minute stress or a trip to the gift shop to buy a collared shirt.\\nTake time to explore Animal Kingdom Lodge. It is an amazing lobby!\\nPick a shareable from the cooking place\\nTry something you normally wouldn't.

I went to the Causeway when I was home just before Christmas.  The service was excellent, as were the wings.  It is extremely hard to find a restaurant in Boston that actually knows how to make Barbecue, and this place has NAILED IT!!\\n\\nI went there with a fairly big party and we got plenty of items off of the menu.  Wings were unreal, wing tips were also a great appetizer.\\n\\nI then got the brisket which was extremely tender and cooked just as if I was eating it down in the south at a BBQ joint.\\n\\nI ended up staying there pretty late into the night and the place filled up with a great crowd of people.

I came across this place and decided to try it out after seeing on the menu I could get fed for under $10. \\n\\nThe woman at the counter was friendly and very knowledgeable, as soon as I mentioned it was my first time there she took the wheel and explained they are known for their chicken salad (tuna is also good option), that they do wraps as well, and asked what kind of sandwich I was looking for. When I told her I liked turkey she suggested the turkey reuben  sandwich and a couple others options. I decided on the turkey sandwich. She walked me through the options (what kind of mustard, cheese, other veggies to add, would I like the bread toasted) and had my sandwich ready to go in about three minutes.\\n\\nThe sandwich was very good, kind of like if I had gone to the grocery store and gotten deli meat, cheese, veggies, bread, and put it all together myself. It was also a nice touch to have the bread toasted to add a little extra crunch! The combo (sandwich, chips and drink) was $7.52 and it took about 5 minutes to order and wait for the sandwich to be prepared. \\n\\nBottom line: it looks like My Friend's Place will be added to my list of go-to sandwich shops."},{"name":"Rontoms","address":"600 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Amongst the hipster centric venues throughout Portland, Rontoms might just boast the most impressive and spacious interior of them all. There is plenty of room for groups of all sizes to stretch their limbs and lounge out with imbibing on adult beverages. Along with the bells and whistles of food, games, and an interesting vibe, Rontoms might have just about everything people could want.\\n\\nAn easy way to get in on the fun is to partake in their daily happy hour, which runs from 3:00-6:300pm. Enjoy a discounted bevy of food items at $4.50 each, which is a luxury in Portland that I don't see often in most places (see \\"food happy hour\\") along with some actual happy hour pricing ($1-2) for drinks. The grilled cheese and tomato soup is decent and another reliable option is the french dip sandwich. As appealing as the vegan sloppy joe sounds, don't be surprised if it's actually quite mediocre.\\n\\nTo combat chilly Portland evenings, stake out or reserve a seat at the infamous firepits. They don't work that well as a heat source, but if one is to avoid the crowds of the lounge space, suddenly the outdoor patio seems like a great place to be. Be weary of the cigarette smoke, someone is always bound to light up. \\n\\nSay what you will about the hipster crowd or the pretentious vibe, the real ding on the star rating for me is the service. On multiple visits the service was just flat out bad. Whether it was bartenders making snafu worthy drinks (though beer is harder to screw up!), it was the waitresses confusing the orders. While mistakes are a norm in the industry, certainly the attitude is not. I'll still give Rontoms my money, but only sparingly when time has passed long enough for me to return."},{"name":"Teatro","address":"177 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Went to Teatro on a Friday night for a friend's birthday.. the place was packed (tables were a bit too close with one another)!!! The menu offers a good selection of appetizers, pasta dishes, and a few entrees choices. I went with the foie gras meatballs and the Scallops. The meatballs were among the best I've ever had! They were super tender, well seasoned, and just melt in your mouth! I thought the scallop dish was just ok.. I liked the concept - the scallops were served with some roasted brussel sprouts, some fancy mushroom, butternut squash pur√©e and a couple slices of prosciutto.. all sounds really good! However, the scallops themselves were not particularly large, fresh, or sweet and I've definitely had much better ones else where.\\n\\nOther people in my party seemed to all enjoyed their food very much - a few of them ordered the \\"red meat\\" (yes, that's the name of the dish on the menu), which is a HUGE ribeye.

My former favorite location (and still favorite, I make the effort to go back frequently) is Pho 88 on the Lowell/Chelmsford line. But now that we live out in Essex County, it's not as easy a drive as before. Pho Paris (why Paris???) is only a 10 minute drive. \\n\\nCan someone explain the \\"Paris\\" part to me? Because there was nothing Parisian about the place and the name actually gave me a pause. There's also a comical looking cow's face on the front sign. This coupled with the name had us scratching our heads. \\n\\nWhen we arrived we were an hour and a half from closing, but there were still several tables seated and eating. \\n\\nThree things that kick my review down to 4 stars instead of 5: \\n\\n1. We were seated by the front, and there is a very large, VERY flamboyant neon sign that kept flashing the entire meal, shining directly into my fianc√©'s eyes. He never once complained, but I could tell it was uncomfortable for him. \\n\\n2. I ordered a Thai iced tea for a beverage, and he ordered a smoothie. His smoothie arrived shortly before our food. My Thai iced tea arrived almost 20 minutes after we received our dinner and almost ate everything. I'm not sure what the delay was, but at that point I wish I had just been told there'd be a wait and I would have ordered something else so I'd at least have something else to drink during the meal. \\n\\n3. The server was very distracted and seemed to spend his time only checking on other tables... it felt like we were sidelined because we came in an hour before closing. I realize having worked at a restaurant that it can be frustrating when customers come in close to closing time, but we had ample time for a meal. \\n\\nLuckily the food itself was really delicious. My favorite dish at Pho 88 was the pan fried noodles with chicken and vegetables. I'd say Pho Paris's version of this dish is aaaaalmost as good! The brown sauce is just a smidge lacking in depth and flavor by comparison, but otherwise it was pretty darn delicious. My fianc√© got a big bowl of beef pho was was happy as a clam. \\n\\nWe're looking forward to returning, but hopefully our next experience will involve less neon lights and more prompt drink service."},{"name":"Crema Cafe","address":"27 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"creama cafe is home to the genius sandwich combination including sweet potato, apple, hummus, and avocado.\\n\\ngreat for a casual lunch or snack."},{"name":"Himalayas Indian Restaurant","address":"5336 Peachtree Rd","city":"Chamblee","stars":"4","text":"They have curry goat for the lunch buffet here which I like.

Mind you the rice is a separate order. You would think it all comes together. I can buy a whole bag of basmati rice at the marketplace for the price of the small portion of rice so I don't think their prices are ideal. The chicken biryani rice had pieces of chicken that where so tough I didnt even bother eating. They serve the food in styrofoam plates and cups so if your looking for a high class dinner date to surprise your lady I suggest you opt for another place.At the same time there's no tips so it kinda makes up for it.

We had a party of ten and each course (drinks, apps, entrees, dessert) arrived promptly and in unison. The food was absolutely delicious. I appreciate that sometimes use of exceptional ingredients at a good price means a smaller app (e.g. crab rolls and littlenecks al forno), but I will take that over overly large portions of Sysco food (that often gets wasted) any day.  Don't miss desserts - each one was fantastic!\\n\\nAll this before you get to the setting, which is fantastic, inside and out.

Would give it a 4.5 if I could, to leave room for some 5-star places back in NJ and NYC, but will round up to a 5 relative to the limited Portland bagel options.  That rounding up also accounts for the great owner and sandwich fillings that are balanced nicely with the bagels without being skimpy or overstuffed.\\n\\nThe Bundy's Bagels food truck can be a little hard to find in a small food truck pod a half block off of SE Hawthorne on SE 33rd Ave, which looks like an alley.  It's located next to Umai and Holy Mole behind The Hazel Room, which faces SE Hawthorne.

Pho Pasteur and the place at Harvard Square are good but not this good. Let me elaborate.\\n\\nIf you pay attention to what you are eating, you know that pho is not hard to make. It doesn't involve grilling pork chops and making the best sauce to go with it; it doesn't concern which cut of beef would give you the most flavor and perfect amount of juiciness; It doesn't even require stir fry or steam vegetables! The quality of the noodles, the aroma and temperature of the beef stock, and the quality and quantity of the beef are what makes pho pho. So in Vietnamese restaurant in America, pho is the single most standard dish. I'm not saying that it's not good, but I don't want to rate a Vietnamese restaurant by Pho (unless it's really bad), because the process of making it is standard and the rating doesn't give the restaurant enough credit.\\n\\nWhat I rate Vietnamese eateries on are the small appetizers and other dishes I order. Most of these consist of what people only go for Pho at these restaurants would puzzle about, or not even give a taste. In this specific case, Xinh Xinh wins the five stars with the fried quail on its appetizer menu. \\n\\nI spent the first 15 years of my life in southern China. After I moved to the states, I realized that I can't find a lot of the food I used to eat almost every other day in China: duck feet, pig lungs, young pigeon, just to name a few.  Or, if I really want to eat them, I need to pay big check at a fancy schmancy restaurant with exotic menu. Well, quail is definitely on the list. Actually it's high on the list since you can rarely find them even in fobby Chinese restaurants in Flushing NY. Before Xinh Xinh, the only time I found quail was at a French restaurant. Since it was roasted, it did not taste the same as the quail I had growing up.\\n\\nVietnamese cuisine shares a lot of things with southern Chinese cuisine. Fried quail is definitely one of them. They were sold as snack food by street vendors on bbq sticks and I often walked back home nibbling on one after classes in elementary school.  That was a long time ago. At Xinh Xinh I found similar taste (Xinh Xinh's is better) and it was a blessing. The quails were fried well, the skins are crisp on first bite but juicy as you chew down. As a small bird, quail does not a lot of meat but every piece was flavored and absolutely worth working through the bones for. Two problems I often encountered with street-vendor-sold quails were that they might be too dry/too fried up, or too salty. Xinh Xinh's was definitely not burnt. As for the saltiness, it had a little more than what I would call perfect, but the quails came lying on raw cabbage leaves, which were slightly flavored by the juice and sauce. So I just nibbled on the cabbages and it was DELICIOUS. Even my friend who normally makes fun of the way I work through bones when I eat any bird couldn't resist to try and ended up eating more than I did! I mean, he still made fun of me and I kinda had to pick out some of the delicious meat for him but Now that is the power of GOOD FOOD!\\n\\nI didn't order Pho, so I don't have anything to tell you about that, but the congee or rice porridge I ordered to go with the quail was also fantastic. I love small restaurants that offer what big ones (like pho pasteur and whatever the place is called in Harvard Square Garage) do not. And when they taste good, I definitely give five stars =)"},{"name":"Chile Verde","address":"4852 Sawmill Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"The first bite of guacamole was a good intro to the meal that followed.

Packing my Art History book, and rather down, I decided to study with my good friend...their Cuban Martini (shaker of mojito).  The sun was bright, my mood dark, and it was time to shake things up.  I ordered the usual beef fajita plate (minus one) with flour tortilla and 86ing the rice and beans for double grilled veggies.  The green sauce is my preference, but today it lacked a little of the cilantro and green onions I love...still, very delicious and not as spicy as usual.  I ordered a Cuban Martini with the Coconut rum, because to me, it just adds an Island flavor and nothing cheers one up like sun and sand.  I was on glass 3 by the time the entree appeared, but that could be because I swallowed the first two glasses like taxpayers swallowing AIG's party expenses...done before I realized where it went.  The beef fajita meat at Trudy's is about the only beef fajita meat I can stomach.  It is lean and tender adn perfectly seasoned.  Most places I end up flossing my teeth with the gristle (ick).  Everything was good.  The veggies had a little too much butter, and very light on seasoning, but I like the light seasoning because you can't undo too much, but you can always salt/pepper to taste.  I boxed up the last of the veggies and moved on to desert.  I was planning to be there a while studying you see.  Brownie a la mode...with a brownie that taste's homemade and amy's Mexican Vanilla Ice Cream on top, you better start saying your Hail Mary's before the trip, because this has got to be a Cardinal Sin.  Sure by the time I can polished off this decent size portion and a few more mojitos, my stomach was a bit queasy, but no one to blame but myself.  My mouth on the other hand, was kicking back on a hammock somewhere deep in the Carribean and exhaling sighs of contentment.\\n\\nAll in all, very good.  Trudy's generally has 4 star rating in my experience, but this was quite exceptional, and thus the 5 stars.  Just remember, if you are going the Mojito route, avoid Limon rum, and if you like the fresh island sensation, opt for the Coco."},{"name":"Citizen Eatery","address":"5011 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"A huge disappointment.  We had planned to eat in, but on arrival (early evening on a Friday) were assailed by incredibly loud rock music reverberating off the walls.  The staff were not exactly warm personalities.  We were seated for only a couple of minutes before we decided to order to go, since we could barely hear each other.  I went outside and sat in the car simply to get away from the music while my husband ordered.  He chose a salad plate and I ordered a three veggie plate - grilled asparagus, mashed sweet potato and cauliflower cheese.  We live a few minutes away and didn't dawdle on the way home but my vegetables were barely warm when I opened the box, and I had to microwave the contents.  The asparagus was almost grey in color, limp and tasteless.  Not to mention that there were literally only 4 medium size pieces of asparagus.  The modest scoop of barely seasoned potato was mashed with large pieces of blackened skin left in it that were hard to chew, and included one lump I simply couldn't eat - I think the prep cook had failed to remove a big \\"eye\\" in the potato.  The cauliflower was not quite raw, but seemed to have been semi-cooked and was curiously difficult to bite into - almost rubbery.  The cheese sauce was a bright orange and tasted like something you might find on a cheap frozen meal - truly unpleasant.  The portions were so small I almost wondered if I had been given a child-size meal by accident.\\n\\nMy husband's salad looked very nice, but the dressing had little flavor.  He had to add more of our own dressing to make it palatable.  He also had an order of hummus that was grey in color, gritty and bland - we added lemon juice to pep it up.

Jiko is an adventure, but one conducted by such a skilled guide that your palate will revel in the change instead of shrinking back from it.\\n\\nIf in doubt, order the short ribs. The sauce used will vary depending on when you are there, but I've yet to have a variation that didn't blow me away. Today, the ribs were served with two sauces, one of which was an earthy, roasted hot pepper type sauce. Incredible.\\n\\nBefore that, for starters, we had the wild boar tenderloin. Tender, savoury, and rare. It was served in a sauce of tomato, onion, and polenta sauce with a hint of truffle oil. We also shared a chicken flatbread and a carrot and garlic ice cream soup.

I haven't had much success finding solid and delicious options since we arrived 13 months ago.  Vegan mexican food that is fresh and tastes delicious consistently? That is a tall order for restaurants in any US city to fill. But, I think (and I can't believe I'm sharing this secret publically) Los Gorditos is the holy grail of amazing Mexican food in the Pacific Northwest. Hell, its possibly the best Mexican food I remember having in an exceptionally long time. \\nI have been to Los Gorditos twice...in the last two days! The flavor, ohhhh the flavor of everything I've tried has been simply devine. I do my best to stick to a vegan diet as much as possible and I'll be the first to tell you, it isn't always easy- even in Portland. There are times when the viable options become monotonous and there are recipes that just don't work very well with vegan components (daiya pizza anyone?!). Los Gorditos not only makes their grub from scratch, they have three menus (meat, vegetarian and vegan) available. With so many options to choose from, monotony shouldn't ever be an issue. \\nYesterday, I tried the soyrizo burrito accidentally because I called in my own order incorrectly; I thought I ordered the soy curl burrito but realized on my way over to pick it up, that i did not (hey, I've been a little busy lately). Best mistake I've made in a long time!!! The soyrizo is made from Bob's Red Mill TVP and it is flipping delicious! \\nToday, I went out on a dangerous limb and ordered the Chile relleno burrito- dangerous because it involved daiya and the balance with daiya's strong flavor profile is absolutely critical to maintain. Well, Los Gorditos nailed it again! There's a chance I could be visiting this place every weekday for lunch because the food is honestly that good here. \\nThe entire team of employees here is phenomenal. Some lady was giving the cashier a hard time yesterday while I was in line and a gentleman from the kitchen came out of the kitchen to help me with my takeout order. You don't see good service like that too often anymore!\\nTo get to the Pearl location, I have to walk a mile and cross many a urine filled doorway.

Hard to believe I missed out on such a great spot for so long. \\n\\nI'll get the disclaimer out of the way immediately: at lunch time, it can get a little nuts. While they make the best use of the limited seating space available, you're liable to be searching for a spot to eat during peak hours. And that pretty much concludes the only negative portion of this review. \\n\\nFor a place that gets so busy, I haven't encountered many businesses that manage to deal with rush hour chaos so well. The staff manage to be both friendly and prompt, from the cashiers to the folks preparing the food and drinks to those cleaning up the tables. And it seems like the customers who dine/hang here regularly are pretty respectful when it comes to not exceeding unreasonable amounts of time at a seat/table (they ask people to only occupy a spot for an hour). While the intangibles and ammenities are certainly nice, the best part is the food. If you enjoy cafe style comfort food, you would be hard pressed to find any better than what they serve at Crema. They have a great soup selection that changes regularly (the tomato bisque and chicken chili are especially good), and their sandwiches are both unique and delicious. My favorite is the grilled chicken with blue cheese spread, arugula, and grapes, pressed panini style on focacia bread. They also make a killer grilled cheese. Their prices are on the slightly higher end, but not unreasonable (a drink, soup, and sandwich will probably run you about $12), and in my opinion well worth it given the quality, atmosphere, and service.\\n\\nFor as long as I'm working in the area, Crema will have the loyalty of my lunching dollar."},{"name":"El Taco Yucateco","address":"1930 NE Everett St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"You know you're having a great Monday when a taco truck unexpectedly pulls up outside your office.\\n\\nUsually we get the food truck folks here on Fridays when I'm not working so I always miss out.

The chicken liver pate dish had a lot of flavor, but the bread that accompanied the dish was doused in butter, which overpowered the flavors developed by the other ingredients.

Since becoming intolerant to certain foods I have avoided the restaurant because the menu is not accommodating (no labeling of ingredients beyond nuts and vegetarian, with nearly all dishes containing ingredients outside the range of foods I can eat). Having no choice this evening I gave a call in this afternoon. The woman who answered the phone could not assist me with the evenings menu, stating it was not the same as on the website, but would not be set until 5:30pm (upon arrival I can confirm it was the same as the website with the exception of a couple of dishes), but let me know that accommodations could easily be made for my dietary restrictions.\\n\\nUpon arriving at the restaurant and getting to placing our dinner orders I found that our server was unwilling to assist me in making any changes to the menu offering. I let her know I had called ahead and was assured reasonable changes could be made to accommodate dietary restrictions. She was resistant. I was willing to order something I did not want to avoid confrontation. She did not feel that replacing items on the lamb dish with something from another dish was acceptable, though that seemed completely reasonable, easy and friendly to me. I asked for more veggies on the side  of the steak dish I ordered instead as I was removing other items and she agreed. Seemed only fair as I was paying the same price. \\n\\nMy dish did not come with any additional veggies. Instead it looked sad and barren, and lacked flavor on top of that. This sort of service is disheartening. It is hard enough to have a disease...changing every aspect of one's life, making eating out and entertaining a painful task.

They do not have fountain drinks but they do offer canned sodas, Snapple juices and they also have a pretty decent selection of bottled beers.\\n\\nAfter overhearing several people talk about the pulled pork sandwich, I decided on that for my lunch. It came with a side of coleslaw and a special sauce.  I assumed the sauce was a regular tomato based but to my surprise it was a well seasoned vinegar based sauce that had the consistency of a vinaigrette. The sandwich itself comes with a heaping mound of freshly smoked very well seasoned pulled pork. It's topped with onions and pickles.  \\n\\nSo I'm surprised no one heard the angels sing when I took my first bite! Talk about party in my mouth and major happy dance moment! This sandwich was so good.  The meat was tender and juicy and every bite had flavor.  I tasted the meat before putting the special sauce on the sandwich and honestly I could have eaten it without the sauce. It was that good.  We ordered a large side of fries but honestly skip them because you will be full.  The coleslaw was very good as well but I wish that they would have given me more.  The container was really small.\\n\\nThere's nothing fancy about this place but it's clean and they have good food!  They offer a discount if you are a policeman or veteran which I think is awesome.

I ordered the elk and asked for the original mac n cheese but the server and I got mixed up and instead he brought me the fillet which is what I usually order anyway, it was absolutely [phenomenal but the chef in the cooking place (Adam) over heard me saying it was the fillet and went out of his way to go to his head chef and ask him to cook us up the elk to try which was entirely amazing of him. Which, the elk was absolutely to die for. Chris got the wagyu beef which he loved too, with the new mac n cheese. We were absolutely stuffed and happy so we decided to pass on dessert and head home.

Now, I love eggplant parmesan, but it's hit or miss in a lot of places.

Be Our Guest at lunch is an exception ... We were disappointed. It was self order at a kiosk - and the \\"staff members\\" we're a little less than happy.  There isn't any dis yachting entertainment. Clearly the intent is to herd diners in and herd them out. The food received mixed reviews from our party of seven. I had the Tuna Nicoise that was fresh and seared nicely. The Vegetable Quiche was an individual pie and nicely presented with fresh greens and a champagne dressing. Turkey/Beef Sandwiches were mediocre and the children's items were band and minimal. In typical Disney fashion, the desserts we shared were pretty fabulous. We shared 4 small portion desserts between 7 people. Important to note with the deluxe dining plan, Dessert is included in ONLY adult plans.  In buffet style restaurants, this doesn't matter, but in an a la carte menu like this- it does. It's hard to explain to child traveling companions that dessert is not included in your meal when an adult has an indulgent choice.

I chose the 2-course option because I was thinking about going to Modern for dessert.  For my appetizer, I had the grilled veggies and it was tasty.  My entree was the penne a la putannesca, which was also tasty.  I liked the sauce because it had a little kick, but wasn't too spicy.\\n\\nIn addition to the good food and other reasons mentioned in the beginning, I enjoyed my dining experience here because of the great service we received.

We went as a family all the time and it was great.  I will also say, I've never had an issue with the service here- staff is friendly, etc. and the facility is clean and bright, etc.\\n\\nNow- the bad part.\\n\\nSomething has changed since I was last here.  There is a new menu and it has eliminated a number of items, including the \\"South Beach Burrito\\".  They swapped out the Asada salsa for something not nearly as good, but it definitely tastes more like a canned salsa than fresh.  I'm not sure what is going on, but my guess is corporate (this is owned by Ruby Tuesdays), is trying to cut costs.\\n\\nMost disappointing was the quality of the chicken- again, it seems like something really has gone downhill since I was last here- maybe 4-6 weeks ago.  The chicken used to be high quality, all white meat, and delicious.  Today, it was grisly, about half white meat, half dark meat and greasier.  I ordered the Lime Burrito (since my usual items weren't on the menu anymore), and it was not good.  I've had better burritos in airports.  Lime used to be so much better than this!\\n\\nAgain, I have no idea what they changed or why but this was noticeably different in a very bad way.  If you've been to this Lime before- go back, you'll notice a real difference in the food quality.  Such a shame!  This place used to be really good and was until recently.  Also, doesn't help that they nixed my two favorite burritos (\\"Skinny Burrito\\" and the aforementioned \\"South Beach\\") and my favorite salsa.\\n\\nI'll be going to Moe's or Chipotle until they've corrected these issues.  Total letdown today!  Cutting costs is fine, and I'm all for a good restaurant making money, but not at the expense of food quality.  I'll pay more for better food, but I won't pay anything for bad food.  \\n\\nIf someone knows exactly what is going on, reply to this- again, they have definitely done something to change the quality of the offering at Lime and it isn't working.\\n\\nIf there is anyone from Lime or Ruby Tuesday's reading this, PLEASE fix this problem!

Lunch service is first come, first served and began at 10:30am. We were second in line at 10am. Once we got through the doors, we went through a hallway of armors then into a room with multiple kiosks for ordering. The touch screen ordering system was easy to use and there were plenty of CMs to help if needed. I liked how there were separate self-serve kiosks for card payments and you can order with a CM for cash/voucher payments.\\nMy FI and I both ordered the Braised Pork (Coq Au Vin style) as an entr√©e and we shared the chocolate cream puff for dessert. The pork was delicious! It was so tender and juicy, I didn't need a knife. The vegetables were cooked very well, not overdone and had a wonderful color. The sauce was a perfect compliment and not overpowering. The chocolate cream puff was heaven in my mouth! What a great way to end lunch. It wasn't dry or hard like I've had in the past and the chocolate filling was nice and fluffy. I also loved how it wasn't overbearingly sweet. I only wish we had ordered an additional flavor. Even my FI loved it and he's not much of a dessert person.\\nOur food arrived at our table very quickly and the servers were all very nice, helpful and stayed in character (they kept calling the touch screens, tabling systems,etc. enchanted mirrors or whatever). Since lunch is quick service you had to get your own drinks and utensils just like any other quick serve locations.

They do not move many of them so the regular pizzas tend to sit out there.  If you do not want a Sicilian slice I would suggest that you go across the street to Upper Crust.  Their delivery service is not what it could be.  The online delivery page does not give you many options vis a vis pizza toppings. \\n\\nConclusion.  Great place.

Also my camera was cracked and she pointed it out to me, which I thought was a little bit tacky, although she was probably just trying to be helpful, and she kind of misled us on the size of the chocolate cakes (she indicated the circumference of them, but didn't mention that they were about 8 inches high - kind of important, since normal molten chocolate cakes are not that tall).

Before eating, we asked the maneger, Mr. Lee, about a groupon we had and was told by him that the groupon was not valid and it was a mistake by groupon even though we showed him the website. When then decided to begin our meal.  The meat was good but the salad bar was a joke.  Additionally the only other side choices were some beans and plain rice, fried bananas and two soups (neither of which were tasty).  Once we started eating, we asked for fresh plates and was told by a waiter, Georgie, in his words \\"Wait a minute!  Can't you see I'm doing something?!\\"  We and the carver were shocked.  Near the end of the evening, I asked about the \\"free\\" cake and was given the run around.  Finally, I asked Mr. Lee and he acted as if he had no idea what I was talking about.  So i asked them to bring out a piece of cake so we could at least do the birthday thing.  Afterward, we asked for our checks from Georgie.  After ten minutes, we asked again for our bills and was told by Georgie that \\"their coming....give it a minute\\".  After 18 minutes we finally got our bills (totalling over $300 for six people) and a lot more.  One of the members of our party was cursed at and threatened by Georgie.  We were shocked and floored and asked for the manager to which Georgie replied, \\"I am the F***ing manager!\\"  So, I said can you get whoever is over you.  He then beckoned Mr. Lee who did absolutely nothing.  I asked Mr. Lee to call the police because this had gone too far and wanted to file a complaint with them about his employee's behavior.  After talking with the police (who was awesome and very professional), we then paid our bills and was told by Mr. Lee that we must had done something to his employee to make him act that way.  When I expressed how the night was ruined and that I would never return to this establishment, Mr. Lee replied \\"thank you....you people brought trouble and you scare me\\".  Even the officer that came per our request looked at him in disbelief.  After 4 hours at Red and Green, my party left with bad memories and regrets on an evening that was supposed to be a celebration.   \\n\\nI spend thousands of dollars a year on dining.

Unlike pancakes made from wheat flour, these are a bit less fluffy and a bit more sticky like mochi. The slight tang of these and the bubbling holes on the surface suggest some level of fermentation. That aspect reminds me of the fermented injera, of course the tang is a lot more muted here.\\n\\nTo top or dip the utthapam, I asked for vegetable korma, a coconut based dry curry of potatoes, peas, and carrots. The ultra smooth almost slippery texture of the potatoes were particularly pleasing.\\n\\nFor those who generally consider Indian food unhealthy, the utthapam would prove them wrong.

She would cosntantly forget drink orders.  There were no complex drink as the only drinks were ordered were beer, and one tea.  My main issue was that the food just stopped coming!  We signed up for \\"all you can eat\\" but it really needs to have fine print somewhere saying, \\"...until we feel like you've had enough.\\"   The meat server came to our table 6 times, each time we each get a tiny sliver of whatever meat he was carrying.  And the time interval between each visit was about 10 minutes.  We spent about an hour and a half there, for 6 visits from the meat fairy.  After the 6th visit, he just stopped!  No warning, no sign of him anywhere, just stopped.   I was still hungry, so I went up to the buffet line to get foods/sides, and half the things were empty.

I had a lot of time to kill before the movie, too so it's not like I was rushing him.\\n \\nAs I was sitting there by myself at the bar I remembered that my friend, who used to live in Waltham (and did Match.com for a while) told me she used to meet a lot of Match dates here. So, then I started getting a little paranoid thinking people would think that I was there, waiting for a date, and that I got stood up. I wanted to tell everyone, \\"No really. I'm not supposed to be meeting anyone. I came here alone on purpose!\\" I pretended to peruse an Ale House magazine that I found nearby and waited for my nachos.\\n\\nOkay, they were good. But honestly, I don't think they have a right to call them nachos. In my nacho-loving mind, what makes something \\"nachos\\" is the fact that they have melted cheese all over them and they come on one dish. But, this item was served with a basket of plain chips and a separate dish of vegetarian beans covered in melted cheese and jalapenos (I opted out of the sour cream the menu offered). So, it was basically a chip & dip meal instead. Don't get me wrong, they were really good. But they weren't exactly nachos. And the bean dip was really, really cheesy, as was the movie Twilight, which was exactly what I expected."},{"name":"Frasca Food and Wine","address":"1738 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"I was taken here for my birthday, and was thoroughly impressed by absolutely everything.

We walked around like mental patients in the early evening Texas summer heat looking for this place. I know you're in the building with that building's main entrance on Congress but you're around the corner with your own dedicated entrance.\\n\\nNow that that's been dealt with, how was the food?\\n\\nWe started with Chang beers ($3/per) to cool us off from the near fatal event which was locating this place. Our appetizer was the Thai sausage and we were both happy with the selection. How Thai Passion was able to replicate the, \\"I've been sitting out in the SE Asian heat for too long\\" sausage skin texture is quite remarkable. You're thinking \\"ewww,\\" but don't be. The skin texture just had a more chewy texture that what most people are expecting. The slightly sweet taste of the sausage and the SE Asian herbs was fantastic. Dipping the pre-sliced pieces in the Sriracha sauce made it even better.\\n\\nMy wife ordered their house special noodle dish with shrimp, vegetables, and an egg roll. Uncharacteristically for a Thai dish, it was not spicy (although you might be able to order it spicy) but had an herbal taste that was slightly sweet. My wife enjoyed it very much and even had some leftovers to take home. I ate the green curry - one of my all-time favorites. I got mine with chicken and medium spice. The bowl of curry is massive! I was really impressed with the quantity. I'm not one that usually takes home a doggy bag but I did that night. The curry was spiced very nicely as my forehead would attest to. The flavors were quite authentic to those I've experienced on my 4 trips to SE Asia (3 to Thailand - but that's another review...). I do wish that they wouldn't use the canned sliced bamboo as it's just a cheap, lazy means to an end. \\n\\nOverall, despite having an ordeal finding this place, the food was excellent, the atmosphere very nice, and service just a tad off. I would certainly recommend Thai Passion to anyone in the neighborhood.

While it was a bit in the expensive side for a party of 10-12 at $568 (non-Chinese banquet-style food), net proceeds goes to the Vancouver Food Bank and Vancouver Sowers Society.  That price includes the GST and gratuities. \\n\\nAll of the food that came out was very tasty.  Of special note was their Steamed Eight-Treasure Fraser Valley Duck that was a deboned duck stuffed with eight varieties of Chinese nuts, root vegetables, etc.  Th Skewered Prawns was a dish I never had before: instead of how we normally picture skewered prawns, the \\"skewers\\" used were skinny Chinese vegetables. Pretty ingenious.  I would imagine it would take some practice to be able to skewer the prawns without making a mess of the prawns.  The other dishes included Deboned Golden Wings, Dried Scallop and Pur√©ed Melon Soup, Pan-Fried Lotus Root Patties, Red Snapper with vegetables, and a variety of Chinese greens served in a thick consomme  broth. \\n\\nThe service was very good, the two servers kept replacing our dishes with clean ones and also checked our tea and drinks frequently. They were polite and friendly - that's sometimes hard to find in many Chinese restaurants.

Side note, we sat in the Ballroom (middle room.)\\n\\nFor our dinner both my husband and I had the sirloin strip steak. We both ordered it medium rare, but his was a bit over cooked to our liking. \\nAside from this, the steak was pretty tasty. The plate came with pomme frites and a side of herb-mayo dipping sauce which was DELICIOUS! Before I forget, to start off the did bring us bread rolls and butter that were very good. Moving on, my husband ordered a French beer which tasted a bit fruity to my liking. I had the Enchant√© Ros√© wine, which was very good!\\nFor dessert, my husband had the orange eclair, which he said was delicious. I had the grey stuff and was in heaven! Our daughter had the strawberry cupcake, but she wasn't into it very much. \\nOnce we were done, they encouraged us to visit the other two dinning rooms and take as many pictures as we wanted. Lastly, we went to the \\"library\\" and got to meet the Beast himself.

It's no wonder that when asked, \\"What did you think of the burger?\\" my friends always reply...\\"Mighty Fine!\\"\\n\\n**Food: Mighty Fine has a very simple menu with few offerings. Reminiscent of its same-owner brother Rudy's BBQ, you will enter in to see few options.  You can basically get a burger with the standard assortment of condiments, chili dogs, shakes, and crinkle fries. I've only tried the burger and crinkle fries, so I will only comment on them. The burgers look like they're ground and prepared right in the restaurant. The burgers are juicy and extremely delicious. The crinkle fries are good too, but I'm a much bigger fan of steak fries. You can always opt for the heart attack meal, which is a burger with the works, shake, crinkle fries, and a chili dog. Be prepared to walk away not wanting to do anything but rest.\\n\\nFor those from the west coast, I've heard the comparison before with Mighty Fine and In-N-Out. The fact is, these are two very different burgers. In-N-Out is good, but the burger feels like a giant mixture, where the meat blends into the cheese blends into the sauce blends into the grease. The components of a Mighty Fine Burger are distinct, mainly because they don't drench their burgers in sauce and the meat is a much larger pick. Having been born and raised in Texas, Mighty Fine gets my vote over the west coast wonder.\\n\\n**Atmosphere: Also reminiscent of Rudy's, Mighty Fine isn't a place to take a girl out on a first date. They have an arrangement of long tables with your standard southern table covers. You'll likely find lots of HDTVs playing sports or the latest news. If you come during lunch, you're likely to be surrounded by several professionals that work in the nearby tech companies. The bathrooms are equipped with one-way mirrors and the hand-washing machine is always a blast to use.\\n\\n**Staff: The staff is extremely energetic, as you would expect (just like Rudy's). They are, for the most part, very friendly. I once decided to bring my friend for the west coast out to Mighty Fine, only to arrive just 3 minutes after closing for the night. We banged on the doors, and the manager came by to let us know they weren't serving anymore. I told him my friend from the west was dying to try their burgers, and little additional coaxing was needed for him to let us and about 4 others in.

It tasted like something frozen they threw in an oven but didn't check if it was done since the cheese wasn't even melted. (Why did I order the lasagna at a seafood place? Well I'm pregnant so raw seafood is out along with swordfish and red meat so my options were limited and I primarily eat vegetarian). My husband had the corn and calm chowder which he enjoyed and the sole as his entree. Overall he agreed the food doesn't leave you wanting for more and the best thing we had were the fries.\\n\\nAlthough our waitress was nice enough, the service felt slow. Did I mention this was a Tuesday night with only 3 other tables in the place?\\n\\nI would say this place is great for an outdoor cocktail when the weather permits.

I love Italian food and always want to check out the latest high-end (or low-end) Italian restaurant.  I do think the food here is above average, however, I don't feel like it is that unique or special compared to other restaurants with the same price tag.  We ordered the Prix Fixe menu and here are the dishes that stood out:\\n* Cape Cod Scallop, Cauliflower, and Meyer Lemon: Scallops were perfectly seared.\\n* Paccheri Pasta with Smoked Mussels, Tomato, and Spigarello: I especially liked the smoked mussels.\\n* Garganelli Pasta with Celeriac, Matsutake Mushrooms, and Quadrello di Bufala: The celeriac and mushrooms added nice flavors to the pasta.\\n* Tiramisu: Mascarpone, Roasted White Chocolate, and Praline\\n\\n1 star off: Severe dishes were mediocre.  From a $78 menu, I expected better.  Here are the dishes that were so-so:\\n* Frico Caldo: Our waiter told us this item is so popular that it has remained on the Frasca menu for years.  So we ordered it and it was a greasy potato-cheese pancake.  I would not order this greasy item again.\\n* Wagyu Ribeye, Savoy Cabbage and Buckwheat: The meat was very small and unflavorful.  It made me feel like Wagyu beef is just like any other beef.\\n* Cioccolatini della Casa: House-made chocolates sound great, but I did not think they were that special.  I got similar levels of satisfaction from See's or store-bought chocolates.\\n\\n1 star off: Our waiter was very awkward.   He must have been new.  He tried really hard to connect with us, but it was very forced.  For example, he asked a lot of personal questions trying to get to know us, but it was obvious that he was just doing his job, and not natural about his approach.  He also kept on offering me alcohol, after I told him I didn't want any.  Oh yes, he also recommended the Frico Caldo that I did not like.  I don't know how to tell him to just bring me food and nothing else?"},{"name":"Noora Persian Cuisine","address":"8631 Sancus Blvd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"My wife and I were very surprised while passing through Columbus to discover a Persian restaurant.

Worst service we have ever received. We asked for guacamole and 2 beers as a starter. The server barely came to the table and did not speak English very well so it was difficult to communicate. The guac and complimentary chips and salsa were disgusting. They tasted stale and bland. How is it called avocados when they haven't even perfected their guacamole?! It tasted worse than store bought. We asked for limes and jalape√±os to spice it up and the server said \\"let me see with my manager\\" in broken English. After the replacement guac and limes were brought out to the table, one of the owners (Luis Gonzalez) asked us to leave in 9 minutes because the table had been apparently \\"reserved\\". Our one year old had just fallen asleep and we were about to order dinner but had no intention of doing so after this treatment. We immediately paid our check of $13 for terrible guac and 2 warm beers. I'll be surprised if this place stays in business for longer than a few months.

The beast's castle-themed dining rooms are cool, and I do recommend anyone trying it once, but it's just not cool enough to support the per-person meal prices for the actual food that is served. My son's half-cup of Frosted Flakes and small bowl of cantaloupe melon and grapes runs $15 without the dining plan.

Then, as I poured my glass of wine( because the waitress re-filled everyones but mine) there was a dead insect in the wine!!!  I immediately brought it to the attention of another waiter who went and told our server.  Our server came out and apologized and told us that they would be taking an appetizer off the bill and asked if that was ok.   I explained that I expected them to do whats right at which time the manager came out and asked if i wanted another glass of a different kind of wine, I said no I want you to do what is right for customer service.  After all was said and done, they took off 2 appetizers totaling $17 after we spent $75 on the bottle of wine and $200+ before tip on the bill.

Crema has mastered the cafe trifecta: great beverages, great sandwiches and amazing baked goods. \\n\\nI can't actually vouch for their coffee, but my human barometer for good coffee, aka my dad, approves - and that's saying a lot. He approves so much that he does a little happy dance after the first sip. I do love everything else I've tried here, especially the ginger lemonade - before I tried theirs I never even thought of adding ginger to lemonade but it's such a winning combination. Since then, I've seen a few other places carrying it, but none have mastered the ginger to lemonade ratio as well as they have. And now I wish summer would come quicker so I could have an excuse to order it.\\n\\nNow let's talk their pastries. Specifically, let's talk their bread pudding. Bread pudding has always been my #1 dessert, and the way they serve it here makes me think that they must be after my heart. For one thing, they have a different variety of bread pudding every time I'm here - raisins, cherries, bananas, rum, bourbon - something new each time. \\n\\nNow let's talk their cupcakes. With all the specialty cupcake shops around Boston, this city has developed quite the debate over which one has the best ones. Well, let me settle that debate once and for all: specialty stores, you can go home, the best cupcakes in Boston are right here. You've got cake that strikes the perfect balance between moist and dry with a dollop of delicious frosting on top. The cupcakes are inventive and yes, I know this word has practically lost all of its meaning but, gourmet. There's no other way to describe them. For St. Patrick's Day they had a chocolate and Bailey's cupcake and holy hell that was like sin in cake form with fudge running down the middle.\\n\\nAnd then there's the sandwiches. Admittedly, I've only tried one because most times I end up here either immediately after a meal or immediately before one, but instead, I grab a seat at the little bar and practically salivate as I read through each one just imagining what they must taste like.

We've been to a Brazilian steakhouse before so our expectations where within reason. I was especially looking forward to the lamb cuts. Let me begin by saying that the outside is a bit \\"suspect\\". Being new to the Atlanta area we are still getting used to the area. This is not somewhere I would go alone.  \\n\\nWhen we walked in it felt like a ghost town. There were only two other tables occupied in the restaurant. It was dimly lit and had an old smell. At that point my \\"we should turn around\\" feeling crept up but we decided to stay.

We went with a Canyon River Moscato. Now for the food - the meats were not good. Everything tasted the same - beef, pork and my beloved lamb. There never did come out with chicken but after the first three bad tastings I did not care. Despite whatever seasonings were listed -and I kept the handy poster on the table in front of me to keep up with what we tried - everything was bland.

The highlight of the meal was the little lady that came over and to make sure we were okay who informed me that the salad was collards (there are not signs on the bar) and told my husband that I was beautiful.

The fact that Barnie's has been located in it's flagship Park Avenue shop for 38 years should tell you that the brand alone has held it's own despite the continual pop up of other coffee shops and cafes. The quality of product speaks for itself. However, did you know that Barnie's Coffee Kitchen also has an outstanding menu and extremely talented chef? I didn't, until recently this year and I've lived in Orlando for 43 years! So, after meeting some of the men behind the marketing, I was given the opportunity to attend a tasting of Chef Camilo Velasco's fall menu at Barnie's Coffee Kitchen on Park Avenue.\\n\\nWe started out inside the shop, but with the great weather we are currently having this October, we moved outside to the lovely courtyard.\\n\\nWe were provided with an incredible spread of \\"Firsts\\" at our tasting. We sampled the corn chowder, which had lovely bits of Spanish chorizo; the Loch Duart salmon tartare with pickled ramps, salsa verde and radish (one of my favorites from the Firsts selection); mussels in a tomato fennel broth served with toasted baguette (which I ate with the salmon tartare too, so order extra); and an arugula and red watercress salad, with grapes, parmigiano reggiano and white balsamic vinaigrette. A special addition to this salad is the marcona almonds. (I am now in love with these almonds and will never be able to settle for a lesser variation of almond.) They are fantastic!\\n\\nContinuing on with the Firsts, we were served a roasted beet and quinoa salad with sherry vinaigrette and pickled carrots. This was delicious, and I'm not someone who would necessarily order quinoa.\\n\\nThe only First on the new fall menu that wasn't available to us the evening of our tasting event was the potato gnocchi with duck confit, brown butter and sage. Reading this line alone should get your taste buds amped! This is going to be a wonderful addition to the menu, and I've already heard that it is very tasty. I look forward to returning to Barnie's to enjoy this dish soon.\\n\\nSo, just when we didn't think the selections could get any better, we moved on to \\"Seconds\\". We couldn't get enough of the Carolina gold risotto. Anson Mills rice with heirloom tomatoes and parmigiano reggiano make up this dish. We learned that the rice is cooked in tomato sauce, and this made for an incredible light undertone of tomato flavor in this dish. Crazy good! \\n\\nThe flounder was served with roasted red pepper, coconut milk broth and baby bok choy. This dish was light and flavorful, and the texture of the bok choy with the fish was a great combination.\\n\\nI also really enjoyed this Joyce Farms roasted chicken breast dish. I don't generally order chicken all that much when eating out, but I would order this dish again. The roasted skin on the breast was delicious. Also in this dish was butternut squash mash, pumpkin seed pesto and Swiss chard. (I love me some Swiss chard!)\\n\\nThe Kurobuta pork tenderloin was on point with its mushroom ragout, creamed faro and truffle. I think this dish will be very popular. \\n\\nAlso among the Seconds, a very flavorful, moist braised short ribs dinner with smoked potato puree, tomato jam and glazed heirloom carrots. This was also a favorite.\\n\\nDespite the fact that we stretched out this tasting over a couple of hours, we managed to get quite full; yet, somehow we managed to save room for a few desserts.\\n\\nWe sampled the South Florida passion fruit cr√®me br√ªl√©e. This silky, smooth dessert was very sweet!\\n\\nNext, we enjoyed an incredible olive oil cake with Sicilian pistachio gelato and macerated berries. Wow! I have never had olive oil cake but I am now a super fan! It was light and flavorful and the gelato and berries were a great addition. Definitely give this dessert a try!\\n\\nLast but not least, a chocolate pudding served with biscotti and house-made espresso syrup. Let me tell you...I am not one to order espresso, but this house-made espresso syrup with the chocolate pudding was unbelievably good. (I only had two bites, but man...if you love chocolate and you love espresso...this is the dessert for you!)\\n\\nI sincerely enjoyed this tasting. Chef Velasco joined us a few times during our meal to discuss his new menu and his passion for this fall selection was infectious. His talent and skill is obvious, and his maturity and knowledge is unsurprising given his mentorship under Chef Norman Van Aken. Much success with this new menu, Chef.\\n\\nGo to Barnie's Coffee Kitchen for dinner and enjoy Chef Velasco's new fall menu for yourself.

Must be good!\\nI ordered a macchiato, of course, my \\"regular\\" anytime I step into a coffeeshop with a decent looking espresso machine. The macchiato was par for the course, but I prefer a bolder bean - personal preference here, folks. It was a bit too frothy for my liking as well, but overall, decent. \\nThe food offerings were fair. Everything seemed to be a pastry or have a pie crust, so if you're on a diet or just try to stick to low cal in general, maybe not the place for you. I would love to see a multi-grain or sprouted bread option, but again, personal preference. I considered this my splurge meal for the week so not a big deal. The menu is small, but I quite like that myself. It shows that they hone in and perfect their recipes. I can appreciate that. Their puff pastries are sourced from Belgium, and a lot of the other ingredients are organic and/or locally sourced. I do wish they would post nutritional value on their menu or food labels. That would be very helpful.\\nFor me, it was a toss up between Nazmeen's Curry Pie (vegan) and the spinach-feta tartlet (vegetarian). After pulling at the 'ole heart strings, I opted for the spinach-feta tartlet and was pleasantly surprised. It was a pure eruption of blissful flavors. Big fan of the combination of spinach, feta and free-range egg. It was seasoned perfectly and baked in a Belgium puff pastry, and topped with a tomato. Presentation was beyond satisfactory.\\nI also opted to try the sausage roll, which was pretty good. Hubs said it was his fav, but I'm more of a spinach-feta kinda gal myself. The sausage roll had a spicy Italian chicken sausage that was wrapped in a puff pastry. Perfect amount of spicy.\\nFor dessert we split the millionaire bar. On their website it's described as, \\"3 rich and decadent  layers of shortbread, housemade caramel and milk chocolate\\" ...it's very rich! Plan to split it with a friend or family member. It was a bit much for me, though I did thoroughly enjoy it. \\nThe young lady who took our order was very polite and welcoming. I can appreciate the hospitality! Don't be caught off guard, the prices are a bit steep, but I know locally sourced ingredients combined with importing the puff pastries probably adds up quick. 2 macchiatos, a spinach-feta tartlet, 2 sausage rolls, a cheddar puff pastry, and a millionaire bar + tax and tip came out to around $34.00. Definitely a treat, but that counts towards my weekly diet and wallet splurge. Also, one thing to note, the items on the menu are pre-made and heated upon ordering. My spinach-feta tartlet was slightly cold in the middle still. Kinda bummed about that, but hey, they're still new. I won't knock 'em for it.\\nAll in all, keep up the good work, Brentwood Social House. I give it two thumbs up!

There were 12 of us.\\n\\nThe workshop began with our choice of hot chocolate: regular, orange and peanut butter, with either a scoop of ice cream or two marshmallows. My advice is to look over the ice cream flavors before getting in line for hot chocolate so you know what you want when they ask. The peanut butter flavor was very subtle in that hot chocolate flavor. My friend put peanut butter ice cream in it, which was a good idea. The orange flavor was good too; it kind of tasted like those chocolate oranges that you find during the holidays.\\n\\nAfter everyone was poured a cup of hot chocolate, we went into the back room where the history of the company was described and the process of creating the marshmallows was outlined. We left that room for the workshop area (a third room).\\n\\nWe had the choice of marshmallow flavor to work with. I chose bourbon. The table was covered in flour and the decoration options were rainbow sprinkles and chocolate sprinkles. There was also a bowl of flour and cookie cutters for shapes. The rest of the workshop was time for us to create our marshmallows. Chris and Marlee led this workshop and they were very friendly, personable and helpful. They answered all of our questions and made sure we had enough sprinkles.\\n\\nAt the end of the workshop, they handed out plastic bags in which to put our marshmallow creations and paper bags for the plastic bags.

This is average-to-good, very filling. I could not bring myself to order the larger option (9.50 for a burger?) but the smaller is fairly large and more than enough. I have not run into the issue of the burger being burnt, however, last time I ordered it, it was quite undercooked and pink in the middle, which is worse. The other times I've ordered it, it hasn't been. It does always take a very long time to cook even with no other customers... if you have an errand to run besides lunch that's the time to do it.  If you need a big, filling burger and the Burgerville cart is not next door in Pioneer square, it's a good place to go. However if the Burgerville cart is there, you will get a faster, cheaper, and better tasting burger at the \\"nomad.\\" \\n\\nFries: I have ordered the sweet potato fries several times, they are quite good. A \\"small\\" order gives you a lot of fries. They don't measure up to Burgerville's seasonal sweet potato fries (sometimes it seems like Violetta's are not cooked enough in the middle), but they're available all the time and there are a lot of them.  \\n\\nThe regular fries I got by accident once when they got my order wrong. They weren't very good.\\n\\nMillenium Farms Greens Salad: Don't even bother, this was expensive, tasted bad, and was not filling. Doesn't make me want to try any of the other salad options \\n\\nHighland Oak Farm Beef Chili: Very good, hot and filling. One of the better soup options around when you feel the need for some good soup (I had a cold). Not too spicy. Don't bother to spend the extra money for the toppings though, they had dissolved within minutes and didn't add much to the soup.\\n\\nOverall: Though I think it is overpriced and extremely slow (it's ironic they have \\"fast\\" in their phone number printed on the truck) , I will go back when I need a substantial hot meal (or just the fries) becuase most of the things I've tried are good and filling and it is convenient (just check order upon receiving it). I noticed today they had an option for \\"sliders\\" (mini burgers by description) for 5, which seems much more reasonable and I might try that next time instead of the regular burger. Keep an eye out for the daily options they post and specials, this may result in some better and cheaper menu options. I think it's a bit offputting that they not only price high but charge extra for every \\"addition\\", but maybe things will change in time. It's also possible the speed will improve when they move into the real building and have more kitchen space, at least it will be less unpleasant to wait indoors when it is cold and windy."},{"name":"Mango Joes Cafe","address":"7007 Sea Harbor Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"Worst theme park food iv ever eaten.

As you enter the building you are in a section that resembles a deli counter loosely, with a small buffet nestled in the space as well.  The special of the day was Spaghetti?! To be honest as I thumbed through the menu I was reminded of every show that fixes broken restaurants. Pages and pages of menu items, not a kitchen in hell could get all of it right so partially because of this fact and because we wanted some German flavor, three of us decided on brats, sauerkraut  and potato salad. The final member got kielbasa. Our server seemed rather slow and we had to explain our drink order 2 diet cokes, a regular coke and an un-sweet tea. She also seemed to care not when she poured our beverages that seemed to be mostly ice and required refills that we hard to acquire at first. The d√©cor seems really dated. The carpet could stand to be replaced and the space seemed like a grandmother's living room. We were served a basket of mixed sliced loaf bread, a covered dish of spicy brown and some butter. Since it was served cold and we ordered heros, we all passed. When our food arrived it was all on a plate with no bun in sight and our server disappeared. So the guys used the bread and made a sandwich. I was out of coke so I waited. When she came around and I told her that we had ordered the sandwiches, I realized I had grown a little irritated because while I was perusing the menu before I ordered I saw that they had goulash, which I love, but it was like $21 dollars and I didn't need a dinner portion and didn't want to spend that kind of money on lunch, I inquired as to whether or not they had a lunch portion and she had told me they did not, which is why I ordered the brats from the hot dog, kielbasa, brat section. Anyway, bottom line, she took the plate and fixed it BUT when the bill arrived, it was still priced at $11.95 as was the other party's entrees, a big disappointment.  On to the food itself; the brats were very small, great flavor but really way to small especially for the increased price. The sauerkraut was nice and tangy and seemed fresh.

There is another Yelp entry for Hog Wild BBQ that appears to be the humble food cart beginnings of this bricks and mortar restaurant.  This food cart was apparently located across the street from where the establishment took root in its present incarnation.  Even after calling the restaurant for directions, it still took us another ten minutes to find the place.  Chalk part of that time up to not being able to escape the labyrinthine box store parking lots that line the Avenue of Roses.  My husband joked that this has better be pretty flipping amazing barbecue for as much trouble as it took to find the place.\\n\\nWhen we walked in, it didn't smell like a renowned source for BBQ -- more like a BBQ scented air freshener on its last legs.  A high hanging menu board with about a quarter of its numerous selections taped off did not inspire confidence.\\n\\nAhead of us, a child's piercing shrieks inadvertently called our attention to a dry erase board propped against the register listing the menu items they were out of.  A BBQ place that allows itself to run out of cornbread, mac n' cheese *and* mashed potatoes on a Friday night speaks poorly of whoever is running the joint.\\n\\nThe interior was nothing to write home about -- just a lot of fast-food style tables.  Place your order at the counter and they bring your food out to you -- no table service.  The occupants looked sad and tired.\\n\\nUltimately, we didn't stay for dinner, so my review is not based on the food.  Between the shrieking children, taped off general menu, running out of basic staples like cornbread, a lackluster smell, and general depressing atmosphere of the place, paying $12 a plate for dinner seemed asinine.

I bought like 10 bakery items, and aksed them if I can carry them in a paper bag, was told \\"NO\\". The reason is \\"the paper bag is for cake buyers\\".

I again, at a different occasion, bought 5 bakery items, and ask them if I can get a paper box for it since I want to bring it to office and share, and want the bread to be presentable. was told I need to buy 6 of them.

After the law for charging for plastic bad, I went there to get some breads. I thought I will just pay for the plastic bag, and was told they are \\"25 cents each\\".

The folks behind the counter are great.  They get 5 stars all around on those elements.  \\n\\nNow the things that make me not stop in here every day to enjoy the food, coffee, and friendly staff (in fact, the things that have largely made me stop going, which I'm sure doesn't have a marked impact on them since they have tourists and students and maybe don't need the working locals):\\n\\n(1) $10 minimum - Please, please, please get Square.  Or something that charges you a % for credit card transactions instead of whatever fee structure has inspired you to set this limit.  The number of times I've been browbeat here (and again, friendly staff, so they are doing their best, but seem to be under strict instructions) is the number 1 reason I'm not really coming around anymore.  You've created a situation where I have to hold a card in my wallet that is dedicated to your one location store, or where you are trying to get me to carry cash several years after I stopped carrying cash.  Wallets are getting smaller and you're not going to be able to change that through store policy.  And I do carry a Crema card, because you've kind of forced me to, but I don't get any benefit back for holding that card, you get all the benefit.  So, Ogawa and Starbucks and other stores that encourage me to pay ahead and use stored value to reduce their overall transaction costs are at least encouraging me to do it with positive offers of an occasional free drink with ever bazillion dollars I spend there.  At Crema it is one of several signs that tell me the rules for being a customer there.  In this era of digital payments, Crema seems like it is maybe a bit lost in time and hoping it can stave off the behavior change of customers long enough for the economics to change.  I don't really know, I just know that plenty of their peer stores have sorted it out, and where I do see a limit, it is usually closer to $5 which, in a coffee shop, is much closer to an ordinary order size.  More than a couple times I've been instructed to buy a cookie or something when I've been within 20 to 30 cents of the limit... not a long-view of building customer relationships.\\n\\n(2) Space - Seats are at a premium, but the space allocation in here is brutal.  This is a perennial problem for coffee shops, and I get that revenue will be a function of how many chairs you can cram in here.  But from an experience perspective, it isn't free.  There are few places where I've had so much food and coffee spilled on me as people climb over one another to press through the seated crowd for that one chair that is table-locked into the corner of the loft.  Makes it difficult to either sit and just enjoy my coffee or to sit and work... and being caught in between those two occasions for a caf√© makes for a not very enjoyable experience.\\n\\n(3) Counter - With the $10 minimum I pretty much always have to order food.  Picking up the food at one end of the bar and then walking back to the coffee machine to wait and stand there with my bowl of soup or sandwich while people bustle around me... if you can figure out how to put the orders out together on a single ticket, preferably in a single spot, that would be a notable difference in the experience.\\n\\nI probably won't stop going altogether, if I'm honest, because it is a damned good coffee.

The Queso dip appetizer was burnt to the point of being hard. What really put me over the edge in this experience was the service. It was ATROCIOUS! I could understand if it was the evening/weekend. It was a Monday afternoon @ 3 P.M. We waited 15 minutes to order. I had to get up to get my own refills (twice). My carryout order was out before my food, before my initial drink order. I had to ask multiple servers for things because our server never came back. The manager sat at the bar and proceeded to watch all of this, including me get my own refill (twice). Oh did I mention they have no AC and it is sweltering hot? The staff is super attractive and much more concerned with flirting with each other than working. A real neat experience all around.

The calamari was great as well. I highly recommend stopping in for a few of their small plates for dinner- we also ordered the tuna tartare and a pizza, both very tasty as well although the tuna tartare did have a slightly off-putting fishiness to it, it certainly wasn't overpowering and as someone that is probably overly sensitive to that I still ate and enjoyed it."},{"name":"Sabrozon Fresh Mexican Restaurant & Catering","address":"17770 Pilkington Rd","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"4.5","text":"Tonight I was bartending a grad party where these guys catered.

So, all the foods come in a big size and the visitors who like casual meals often go there with their friends or families.\\n\\n  History of Jung-hwa yori : Many of Chinese merchants from 19C or before, have settled in the West of Seoul for hundreds of years and they have kept their lifestyle in their own community. They have strictly kept their bloodlines within themselves even though those Chinese Koreans are very ecclectic and well-mingled with their Korean neighbors. The recognition of these people is often associated with the Korean-Chinese restaurants in every village they ran for many years in mid to late 20C. The poor Koreans, back then, could not afford to eat out in a fancy restaurant but these korean-Chinese dishes could be delivered to their doorsteps carried in a tin box(just like the pizza delivery packing-we called the delivery men \\"007\\" as the tin box looked shiny and sleek looking ;). For many koreans, this is a loyal visit for the taste of their past memories. \\n\\nWell, for most of my western friends, this is simply a fun meal. So far all of my friends liked this new kind. Think of General Kao's Chicken(this doesn't exist in Asia, BTW) in Boston Chinese Restaurants. Did you like it?  Then you will definitely want to try this restaurant. (there are not many Korean-Chinese Restaurant in Boston)\\n\\nYou can find these delicious food on their menu; \\n\\n1.Tangsu-Yuk (Freshly Fried meat of Chicken, pork, or beef with sweet and sour clear sauce with a hint of peppers)\\n\\n2.Kanpung-ki(Fried Chicked, boneless, topped with hot garlicky sauce, little sweet) Rajo-ki is the unsweetened version and sometimes I order this for its delicacy.\\n\\n3.samsun(Seafood assortment) Jajang(roasted Black Bean paste)-myun(boiled noodle)  : just pure black color might freighten you but the stir-fried onions, potatos, garlic, shrimp, calamari make a sweet and rich flavor and this is the no. 1 most popular dish from Buk Kyung.\\n\\n4. Cham-pong : Spiced soup with thick noodles. If you like any seafood from Spanish or Italian restaurants, we have chamg-pong. But, bewarned. it is really spicy and even koreans sweat to finish this one. It comes with veggies, scallops, shrimps, mushrooms, mussels, all in one big bowl. And, if you really dare to try the hot soup, this is it. This is the second most popular dish among koreans.\\n\\n5. pal-bo-che/yang-jang pi : these are quite expensive compared to the others on the menu but it is also worth trying if you become a frequent customer. They are more authentic Chinese style but the amount of spices used and the way cooked are still Korean styles. And, you will find these better than chinese ones.  \\n-palboche(minced eight treasures)  is made of mussels, squid, sea cucumber, shrimp, bamboo shoot, mushroom, pork, chinese cabbage leafs, \\n-yangjangpi is actually name of the thin and clear dried noodle but when we order this noodle, it comes with stir-fried pork, mussels, onions, carrots, boiled eggs, cucumber,  with soy sauce and sesame oil and MUSTARD! it is hot but not sweet, so, it is a grownup's taste.\\n\\n Well, if you like any of these above, you will love to visit Buk-Kyung for the rest of your life ;). They also serve Korean style dishes and I recommend a clear dumpling soup(mandu-guk) as a main portion for its clean taste. \\n\\nI was debating with the score 5/5, instead of 4/5 as their interior is a big shame and the dining hall can be loud with occasional Korean student groups. But, none of these can beat its location and the original taste so I give the full 5 stars ;) The price ranges from $10-25 but mostly under $15 for a good treat to your soul;)\\n\\nEnjoy!"},{"name":"Pho Corner","address":"6120 NE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"What's the best time to get Pho?

They weren't taking Advanced Dining Reservations for dinner over the phone, just walk ups, so we decided to try lunch first.  And I can tell you, I was NOT disappointed.  We jumped in line after walking into the new area and were quickly ushered into Beast's Castle.  \\n\\nI was excited to test out the new kiosk ordering system so was happy when we were ushered over to the kiosks and not to the normal Cast Member cash registers.  I've heard they've since improved them some more to include allergy information and stuff too.  Pretty cool. \\n\\nAfter you order, a Cast Member ushers you into the main dining room (that was the only room open when we were there for lunch) and explains that you have to put your red rose \\"pager\\" (that red thing sitting on the counter in front of Danielle in the pic above) on the table and another Cast Member will come find you to bring you your food.  Pretty nifty! \\n\\nAfter getting our drinks and sitting at a table, a Cast Member with a dining cart came around with our food.  Everything was hot and everyone's order was correct so we were all happy.  There were also Cast Members wandering around making sure that you didn't need anything else during your meal, such as ketchup, etc.  If you did, they would bring it to your table for you. \\n\\nI wanted to try both soups so I was happy to see that Daniel (I think?!) wanted the French Onion soup.  Good news for all you vegetarians, the soup is made with vegetable broth, and not beef broth like normal.  Unfortunately though, I think the soup NEEDED the beef broth.  It just didn't really have much flavor or depth after you got passed the cheese.  It was good but nothing special so I'm not sure I would order it next time I go.     \\n\\nI ordered the potato leek soup for myself and I felt the same about this as I did the onion soup.  It was missing something.  Maybe not enough seasoning or something.  I ate it all but wasn't craving more.  Or maybe it would have been better with some cheddar cheese..mmm.....cheeseeeeeeee.\\n\\nBut!  The real winner of lunch!  The braised pork is easily one of my favorite lunches on all of WDW property now.  According to the menu...it's slow cooked with vegetables and bacon with mashed potatoes and Green beans Jardiniere.  Nomnomnom!  The pork was so tender and juicy, the gravy was perfectly seasoned and thick, and the mashed potatoes and veggies were again...perfect. \\n\\nIt was a large portion for lunch but I swear I was sad when I finished.  I might have been able to have a whole other serving.  So good! \\n\\nWe didn't get any desserts on this trip, but we did for dinner so I'll review them then! \\n\\nAfter lunch finished, we decided to walk around the restaurant a bit and investigate the other rooms.  The themeing is beautiful and so detailed!  The Library was lovely but the West Wing is my favorite, and we were able to dine there for our dinner in January!  \\n\\nSo overall, I really enjoyed Be Our Guest.  I know I wasn't a huge fan of either soup but people do really enjoy them.  Just personal preference I guess.  I'd DEFINITELY be back for that pork dish!  Oh!  And did I mention that you can get real fresh brewed coffee from the coffee machines there?  Yes!!!! No more Nescafe sludge!  I really enjoyed the service and how they brought out the food for you, even though it's still \\"counter service\\".

There was grease from the veggies running down the outside of the tortilla and dripping out of the tin foil. There were no jalape√±os, no rice, no anything with texture.

I was lucky enough to get reservations for lunch as we know that reservations for Disney restaurants are mostly filled up 6 months ahead typically for the summer season. They're pretty strict on who goes inside too. If you don't have a reservation you're not even allowed to go past to gate to take pictures and look inside. Anyways, even with a reservation you had to wait a while to order and be seated. \\n\\nFOOD\\nI got the braised pork and I thought it was pretty good. It was a good portion but it needed more sauce because it was a little dry. The mash potatoes and green beans were the same served at any other Disney location such as Plaza Inn at Disneyland Anaheim. My family got the roast beef sandwich but they didn't like it. I also got the master's cupcake which featured \\"the grey stuff\\" from the Be Our Guest song. It was surprisingly really good! I'm not saying I'm a cupcake enthusiast but I've been to plenty of cupcake places around LA and this was definitely comparable. Personally, I don't think going for lunch is that worth it because it is quick service except they just charge you more than other quick service places.\\n\\nSERVICE\\nLunch is quick service, dinner is table service. During lunch, it is a quick service place but they bring out the food for you. You wait in line and order at the counter. After that, you can choose to sit down at any of the three themed dining rooms (Grand Ballroom, Library, or The West Wing) and then they will bring out the food to you. I have no idea how they find the right table, but they do it somehow! I chose to sit at the Grand Ballroom because it was the most iconic but I think The West Wing is really interesting. The wait time for our food took awhile but I suspected it was because they couldn't find us. I think this is a flaw within the restaurant because they should just give us numbers to put on our tables to make it easier.\\n\\nAMBIANCE\\nThe whole restaurant is so carefully designed with so many details that it puts you right in the story. The atmosphere really is amazing from the moment you enter. There is the iconic rose in the West Wing, the stained glass window (even though it is made out of tiles), the Grand Ballroom, etc. I feel like you're coming here for the place and not for the food. \\n\\nOverall, the experience is a must. The decor is amazing and the master's cupcake is a must try. Although it may be pricier, I would recommend coming for dinner because the lunch food items aren't really all that great as it's nothing you can't get elsewhere.

I was kind of sad but when I tasted the mascarpone fig gelato flavor, I just about died from deliciousness. There were tons of other great sounding flavors like ginger lavender, strawberry rosewater, and salted caramel. I love that they have these \\"gourmet\\" flavors that really are unique and super tasty. The mascarpone fig gelato (not actually a gelato) was creamy, rich, and just the right sweetness from the fig. The small size in a waffle cone was easily 3 scoops of ice cream, so the portions are generous. I would definitely come back here again."},{"name":"Umami","address":"1704 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"There are four basic tastes: sweet, sour, salty and bitter. Umami is the Japanese word for the 5th taste, the experience or the blend of the first four (I always thought that was chocolate, but I digress). \\n\\nI discovered this place by accident, driving by and being hungry. Looked good from the outside, no indication on the type of food, so a little bit of a gamble when I walked in and not relieved yet when I saw the essentially one-page menu with about 12 appetizers and 12 main dishes. Alas, even though sparse, the menu promises what the name indicated: an exotic blend of the basic four tastes. \\n\\nI was greeted with a friendly smile by the bar tender/hostess. After selecting a Singha beer (never had it, is quite good), I was served a complimentary amuse gueule of julienned veggies with a garlic dipping sauce. Different, but did what it was supposed to do: make my palate curious.\\n\\nFor my meal, I chose the daily special appetizer, a yellow-fin tuna tartar with greens (all appetizers are in the $6-8 range) and as the main meal a braised osso buco with (some) greens (most main courses were $16-22). \\n\\nThe tuna was fabulous, a true blend of tastes, not too sweet (often the case in the US) and I liked the spicy sauce. Very nice.\\n\\nThe osso buco was supposed to literally fall off the bone, but, unfortunately, was about as tough as my shoe soles. When the waitress inquired how I'm doing, I told her that it's close to inedible and she offered me another dish from the menu. I was in the mood for meat, so I chose a rib-eye steak with pepper sauce, sweet potato cubes and topped with fresh greens in a mild vinaigrette coating. The taste was very nice, even the potatoes (I usually don't care about sweet potatoes in any form). However, I ordered the steak medium rare and got it done medium at best. \\n\\nThe waitress made sure I like it this time and told me that the beer is on the house. She was fast, very friendly and attentive, worried about my well being (and it helped that she was beautiful, too. :-)\\n\\nAll in all a very interesting place, friendly service and some very intriguing dishes, try it out if you feel like food off the beaten path.

I end up covering the burger in some sort of nasty levels of salt just to get a little bit of flavor out of their beef.\\n\\nIf I was a young child without taste buds and a deadly fear of pink meat, Mighty Fine would be \\"Mighty Fine\\".

We have been here several times over the past 4-5 years. Food is always great service always pretty good. The reason I am writing this review tonight is because Charles the bartender tonight absolutely killed it. Here is the scenario: my wife and I are about an hour early for our 7pm reservation due to the wine expo ending at 5pm. We know we are early, no big deal, check in at hostess station and proceed to the 1st floor bar. After about 5 mins of observing the bartender/crowd it is obvious something is wrong. He is taking all cards out front by himself to run, and had to open the register with a set of keys. We know something was wrong with their system, (this was confirmed after we heard the bartender relay the information to management and a couple other wait staff/employees). Charles was very apologetic and serviced every customer with a smile. We were sitting at the corner of the bar (didn't get seated until 730) for about an hour and half so we saw a lot of drinks cycle through. He busted his butt, took care of everyone, and ran (literally) all of the credit cards out near the hostess station by himself. As a side note he got little to no support from management tonight, there was a rather tall overweight bald white man who was clearly a manager, who did nothing to help him. I observed this gentleman behind the bar, for a total of 10 minutes out of the 1 & 1/2 hours we were there. I saw with my own eyes him, hiding behind the hostess station doing nothing for at least a solid 1/2 hour to 45 minutes leaving his bartender to fend for himself. 5 stars for Bartender, 0 stars for lazy, useless manager guy.

As of this posting, Happy Lamb is listed as a $$ for cost... well, it's more like $$$, read on...\\n\\nWe were looking for a place to go on a Tuesday night and found this on yelp and thought, \\"wow, look at the ratings! Let's check it out!\\" \\n\\nFirstly, if too much choice paralyzes you, this is not the place for you! You have to pick 1) the broth (classic or spicy), 2) the protein - meat, chicken, fish, lamb, 3) the vegetables ... too many to list and 4) the pasta. I might be slightly off on the list but you get the gist. There is no cooking done on the part of the staff, it's all DIY at the table. \\n\\nThey bring all the ingredients out and put it on the table which has an induction burner in the middle. The broth gets turned up to boiling and then you go to it with adding your ingredients and letting it cook in the boiling broth. \\n\\nWe ordered the 50/50 original/spicy. The spicy seemed very tasty at first, but it's not for the faint of heart. The problem is, after it sits there boiling during your meal, the flavors intensify and whatever spices they've thrown in there become so strong the broth becomes unedible. The original is supposedly a chicken based broth. I've never seen chicken broth that white, so I can't imagine what else is added but I can tell you the taste is very close to lipton chicken soup packets (you judge if that's good or bad). \\n\\nWe ordered the meatball tray and the vegetable platter and the American kobe beef. Here are some tips: \\n\\n1) break up your vegetables before you throw them in or you'll end up very awkwardly trying to put boiling hot vegetables in your mouth as the broth burns your face as it runs down\\n\\n2) Don't bother spending money on any fancy beef because beef all tastes the same when boiled...blah\\n\\n3) If you don't like sweet drinks, don't order anything except water. The fruit drinks we were told \\"weren't sweet at all,\\" but in fact are tooth-rottingly sweeet.\\n\\n4) If you're not adept at chopstick handling, don't order the corn or you'll be wearing broth on your face from constantly dropping it into the soup. \\n\\nNow, the grand total for all this work: $60. yes, $60 for soup plus tip is $70...for soup.

Prior to coming to the Black Lobster (someone else's choice), I read the Yelp reviews with a grain of salt.  That said, our experience mirrored what others described almost to the letter.  \\n\\nYou'd think that a reservation made days in advance would not be met with such surprise.  No one at the host stand to greet us. One in our group had to walk around the restaurant to find someone to ask about our reservation.  In the meantime, two more parties came in (we warned them and wished them luck!).  About 15 minutes later, we were seated in the near empty restaurant.  \\n\\nI could go on and on, but suffice it to say that the service was spotty at best, food came out over a 30 minute period.  Some were finished before others were served.  Our server was very nice, and I think she did the best that she could.  What I don't understand is the poor front-of-house service.  If there's a manager, s/he is outside listening to the music, or just hiding somewhere.  Nonexistent. \\n\\nIf you don't mind having to flag someone down to seat you, reminding your server what you ordered when they can't remember who hasn't been served, and watching your friends eat while you wait for your meal, then I think you'll enjoy it.

I hate when I have to stuff sushi in my mouth to get it in on one...it's not cute, or when you have to split it into two bites. The tuna poppers were flavorful and mild.

The first time was with my girlfriend for lunch right after my short, morning shift. We walked over the couple of blocks and looked at the refreshing sandwich menu. Lots of cool stuff there.

I) paid and my girlfriend sat down at this really nice, thick, wooden table that had this authentic, really awesome, comfortable wooden seats. Really cool rustic, yet modern look. I waited for the sandwiches to be made at the counter... 2 minutes later, we dug our claws into these sammys and ate happily.\\n\\nI found mine a bit small for the price and also not very tasty. I was expecting a lot more flavor and although it was nice and moist, it lacked a bit of flavor. So did my girlfriends. The homemade chips seemed to be a hit though; I had one, it was pretty good but not my thing. The roast beef was really, really, really rare. Too raw for me, and for my girlfriend as well. \\n\\nI returned the following day on my way home after work just to try their pomegranate granita which was original but too expensive...\\n\\nOverall the place has style, a great menu but lacks flavor and bang for the buck. I won't give up on this place though, it has a great atmosphere and staff, it just needs a bit more work. I have yet to try their baked goods but will at some point soon.\\n\\nAnother great thing is their tea and coffee selection which is quite impressive and even features some rare stuff!

But I've since learned that my Vietnamese friends never pluralize the word noodle. The exact opposite of my English friends who insist that there is an \\"s\\" at the end of the word \\"math\\". Conservation. \\n\\nAs the only self-proclaimed Indonesian Restaurant in town, Java Noodles takes surprisingly little pride in their product. Take their Seafood and Flat Noodles dinner entree, for example. Put aside the fact that this seems to be an example of Americanized Chinese. The shrimp: actually pretty good. The Scallops: pretty tasteless but not overcooked. The....uh...what are those reddish sticks? Imitation crab meat? No....they're really tough. Can hardly take a fork. Is this some sort of exotic Asian root? A cured curd? I eat two and can't tell. Curiosity gets the better of me and I ask. Well, apparently the imitation crab meat sometimes sits too long in the fridge and gets stale. WTF?!?!?! Apparently that little nugget of info was worth a free appetizer for \\"next time\\". \\n\\nIt's not all bad. Their pineapple fried rice had some cool spices and flavors going. Worth going back for. I haven't sampled any curries here to date. I'm debating, though as to whether it's worth the 10 minute drive. \\n\\nI am most familiar with their lunch menu. Their appetizer bar is what has me coming back regularly. The selections are few. It's really better described as \\"self-serve soup and wings station\\". \\nThere is something up there called \\"coconut soup\\" or \\"coconut curry soup\\". That rather inelegant description is clearly an undersell. \\n\\nI am a huge fan of the Singaporean soup Lhaksa. I asked the waitress if that is what this was. She said \\"No, it's coconut curry soup\\". So a word about the curry. It does have something in common with the yellow curry used to make Lhaksa. The taste is slightly sweet and earthy. Not too complex. No seafood in this one. Mainly veggies and cabbage. But it is quite tasty. The other is hot and sour soup. Whoop-dee-doo. \\n\\nIf you go for lunch, you can actually make a decent meal of the soups, wings, egg rolls and veggies and bring your entree home for dinner in a box. Not at all bad for approx $8. \\n\\nOther than the soup I had a hard time understanding what may be uniquely Indonesian about this place. For starters, take the Orange Beef. Sounds very....well..Mandarin. Then there's a spicy ginger entree (you can get most of their lunch entrees with your choices of meet or tofu). To be sure it IS spicy...but the sauce is a bit goopy. Then there is a Pad Thai noodle dish. I get the feeling that an Indonesian Restaurant is just about as much of a melting pot as is Indonesia! \\n\\nUnfortunately, at least for lunch, none of the entrees really dance. They lie mostly flat, heavy, simple. No matter, though. I really only go for that soup. \\n\\nOh, there's one other thing about that little soup bar. That's where the dessert lives: Banana Rolls. A word to the wise: Read the sign to know which are banana and which are veggie! The Banana roll, to me, is just an arbitrary substance to scoop up the condensed milk they leave out as a condiment. Nothing too clever about that. It may even be panned for it's simplicity. But where else can you get the stuff, warm and ready in an all-you-can-eat mode? \\n\\nSummary: Take a few trips through this DMZ to find what you like in the  menu minefield.

You can easily have an appetizer as your lunch, as the portion sizes are quite generous, and that's what I did on these two occasions, having the chicken quesadilla on Wednesday and the chicken nachos on Thursday.  I particularly like how they do their nachos, assembling them individually rather than throwing everything into a pile - this way, you get a nice bite of all of the flavors every time. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is nice, with a large bar area and a dining area that's subdivided to provide a bit more of a cozy space (rather than be cavernous).

There is an air condition handler just past the check out that drips condensation on customers.  It is also VERY loud when the AC is comes on and while it is running.

Instead we ordered the queso dip with tortilla chips. The dip was more like a corn soup. It had a good taste but had so much liquid I should've eaten it with a spoon instead of tortilla chips. Each table also gets chips and salsa which in my opinion should be a staple at any Mexican restaurant. This salsa, however, was more like tomato soup with a spice that doesn't add to the flavor but only makes your throat burn for the next 20 minutes.

Rather I am on my search for good chicken tikka masala that I don't have to make myself (a challenge that is proving more difficult than I thought).  Zyka was rated pretty high so I decided to give them a try.  Here's how it went:\\n\\nI drove up to Zyka from the Scott Blvd. entrance (you can also get there from Church St. too).  It really is in a building that is attached to a church.  It looks like a structure that would normally be used as the church's Sunday School.  But instead it houses an Indian restaurant; who knew (outside of the 100+ reviewers :))\\n\\nI read that the dining-in experience was not desirable so I opted for take-out (plus, it's Friday and I wanted to get home!)  I walked up the counter knowing what I wanted to order but was surprised when I noticed their specials; they were serving chicken tikka masala.  But when I read their description, it said something about cashew nut and almond butter.  Huh?  I've never heard of those ingredients in chicken tikka masala.  Granted I am not Indian and do not claim to be a guru on Indian cuisine.  But something about those ingredients just seemed wrong.  So I opted to stick with my original order: naan (of course), veggie samosas, and butter chicken.  I waited for about 10 minutes and they called my name and I was out the door.  BUT not before I noticed their recent health inspection rating...78/C.  YIKES!  (Now, as a former manager at a food chain that shall remain nameless, I know scores can be off and subject to the mood of the inspector that day.  Some inspectors will blindly check off the list and not really look around, giving a place that should get a B/C an A.  Then sometimes you get the super anal inspector that is by the book. As a consumer you want the latter, even if that means that virtually no place would get an A.  But far too often, you get the former.)  I said all this to say that I am usually a little forgiving on the rating.  But a 78/C is too low in my book no matter who the inspector was.  But I had paid my $12 , skipped lunch, and I had an Indian food jones...\\n\\nAs soon as I got to my car I opened the samosas (hey, I said I skipped lunch).  They were darker than golden brown so I didn't know what to expect.  But they were TASTY!  The vegetables inside (a mixture of potatoes, carrots, chickpeas, corn, and some other stuff) were heavy with the taste of Indian spices.  And the dough, though dark, was tasty too.  I usually get chicken samosas, but I did not miss the meat with these.  YUM!  \\n\\nNow, on to the other food.  Though the naan was soft, it was not the best I have had.  It will suffice to sop up your sauce.  The butter chicken, which I was told was similar to tikka masala, is not similar to tikka masala.  I did appreciate that you could taste the smokey, \\"grill\\" taste of the chicken.  And the gravy was flavorful.  But it was missing something...yes, I am kicking myself for not ordering the tikka masala despite the nut butter description.  And I forgot to order rice.  DOH!\\n\\nYes, the food is greasy.  But honestly, I have never had Indian food at a restaurant that was not greasy.  It's all about finding the place has an acceptable level of grease for your tastes.  They had an acceptable level, although they were pushing it a bit.  The styrofoam is annoying too.\\n\\nAll in all, I would give them another try.

The servers were very on top of things and since we were starving and ordered immediately the food came promptly. I was happy with their signature beef noodle soup. However it wasn't the best I've had. I've had better in Irvine, CA and in China. The beef rolled party was tasty for a western pallet. Beef rolled in a pastry with sweet duck sauce would make most westerners happy. \\n\\nThe Bad: Since it isn't known for their Juicy Pork Dumplings, they were decent but not great.

My boyfriend and I unwittingly ordered the same thing: yakisoba noodles with mixed vegetables and chicken, with sweet chili sauce.  I am pretty sure the sweet chili sauce is just sriracha sauce.  It came in a big bowl in layers: noodles, vegetables, sauce, and the chicken on a skewer on top.  The noodles were stuck together on account of the sauce being un-mix-in-able, some of the (steamed) vegetables kind of tasted like garbage, and the chicken on a skewer was too unwieldy and embarrassing to eat in public.  Those are my only complaints.  Our friend had brown rice with chicken and I think teriyaki sauce, which he said he wouldn't recommend.\\n\\nTheir menu isn't very varied: you basically pick a grain (rice or noodles), then either vegetables or choice of meat at varying prices, then a type of sauce (teriyaki, sweet chili, or one other thing).

We were lucky enough to come fairly early in the evening so the place was almost empty. I believe we were served by the owner himself and outside of a single case of \\"water glass is empty\\" it was great. \\n\\nAs first timers, he gave us a great run down of the menu and made a few recommendations for us to try. Of course the Pork Belly Confit was on that list.\\n\\nThe drinks were absolutely perfect. For them alone would I come back. We had the White Bean Fundido, the Guacamole, Tapenade, and Salsas, the Jicama Asian Pear salad, the Pork Belly Confit, and the Pulled Duck Cracklin' Tacos. \\n\\nThe Jicama and Asian pears complemented each other perfectly. The Tapenade set off the salsa and guacamole in unexpected ways since olives are such a rare ingredient at most Latin American places. The Pulled Duck tacos were perfect, the meat was moist and flavorful and the cracklins on top added the perfect hint of salty decadence. \\n\\nOf all the dishes, the Pork Belly was actually the most disappointing. The tamarind glaze was actually perfect, but the Pork Belly itself was off. It was a little too fatty considering the size of the pieces. The fat overwhelmed the taste in general. They would have been better cut in smaller pieces, and then maybe quickly grilled on each side to add a bit of crunchiness. Even then, it was definitely worth the price, and I will definitely be ordering it again.

We made reservations for Saturday evening, which was a good thing because when we arrived, those walking in without reservations were told there would be a wait of at least an hour. \\n\\nThe lobby, as others have noted, is tiny. With crowds like this, and especially during a humid Atlanta evening, that's not good. We didn't wait long to be seated at a booth. The place was packed and rather noisy. The booths are roomy but the tables are close together as to cram as many people into the room as possible.\\n\\nI tend to get a feel for how a meal will go within the first few minutes of sitting down and this time was no different. We didn't see our waiter for over 10 minutes. The overworked hostess actually brought us our bread and water. I'm not fond of onion bread so I didn't have any, which didn't bother me because I don't like to fill up on bread anyway.\\n\\nThe worst part of the meal, frankly, was the service. Our waiter was nice enough but not very present. We only saw him probably 3 times during out entire meal. We would have ordered wine had he returned. We didn't get water/tea refills until we were almost done and this was done by a new waitress who had come on board to share the load. She, at least, was eager to clear plates and offer us refills, etc. Our first waiter seemed to care less. \\n\\nThe restaurant touts itself as being a 40s-style supper club. My husband and I joked that maybe this is what restaurant service was like in the 40s.\\n\\nWe ordered a calamari appetizer that was mediocre at best. I ordered the petite fillet and mashed red potatoes. The steak was good but nothing outstanding. The potatoes were good enough but probably overloaded with butter and salt. My husband ordered the lamb, which he liked but thought was a tad overdone. He did comment that the creamed spinach actually tasted like there was fresh spinach in it.\\n\\nWe didn't order dessert so I can't comment on that. With the coupon, the meal was incredibly affordable. But when the service is that lacking and the food just so-so, it doesn't merit a second visit for me.

If you like KC BBQ, you'll like the illegal ribs...the rub is great and they're cooked just right.  There's also enough of a selection of BBQ sauces to find something you will probably like, if you're big on sauce.\\n\\nThe drawbacks come once you get away from the ribs.  I had brisket, which is pretty hard to screw up with all the fat content, but somehow it came out a little dry.  Conversely, the smoked sausage was super moist, like grilled sausage, but didn't have a lot of great smokehouse flavor.  The side were also a little on the small side but, given the amount of food, it didn't really bother me.\\n\\nI'm not going to rush back here without checking out the other local BBQ options but, overall, I think this is a pretty solid take on the KC tradition."},{"name":"Sweet Carrot","address":"1417 W 5th Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"We visited twice in a matter of weeks!

My husband ended up finishing my salad both times, so he got by without a side, but I think he would have been hungry otherwise.\\n\\nThe food is very good. The salad comes with dressing on it, but then you also get a container of BBQ sauce, at least with the pulled pork meat selection. The corn salsa has a kick to it, but the quantity is not so much that it overpowers the other flavors. The coleslaw is pretty good, and I'm picky about coleslaw.

These spareribs are very crispy, sweet, and hints of saltiness after you start chewing. The combination of honey and the deep fried pork suprisingly compliment each other very well. I guess I really like this dish because I haven't seen this dish in Chinese restaurants in Hawaii. I hope one day I'll find this dish in Hawaii or somewhere in the mainland! We had other dishes including crispy noodles with veggies. If you like your noodles really crispy, this dish is for you! The veggies and the gravy aren't salty, so if you can't have a lot of salt in dishes, this is the noddles you wantThis dish was good, but it cannot compare to the honey garlic spareribs.

Cantina Laredo offered us a whole section of the restaurant they would reserve for us with no money down and they would let our group order off the menu and pay as individual families.  They assigned 4 different servers to our area.  Everything went very well and our party was raving about how fast they got the food out to us.  All in all, it was even more confusing for them, because we had families split up all over the area - with the kids at one large table and the Mom's sitting together and the Dad's sitting together.  A recipe for disaster and probably the worst nightmare for a restaurant.  But this place handled it all with a smile on their face and polite attitudes and all the checks were correct.

The pastries were warmed up perfectly (probably in a toaster oven and not in microwave). The crust and puff pastry were buttery and light. The only thing is I wish there was some simple items on the menu for the little ones, like toast and jam, cheese plate, or plain croissant. I was hoping my 6 year old would like the cheese pasty, but she ate just the puff pastry part and left the cheese part for me. I love the family-friendly atmosphere, especially the playroom with the play kitchen, train table, books, etc. We will be enjoying the outdoor patio soon.

It can be from a hole in the wall, or a 5-star restaurant.  That sad, this was not the place for me.  I went in to try their Po' Boys.  They had a big sandwich board out front when I drove by a few weeks ago and I knew I had to try it.  With a family based in New Orleans, it is hard not to keep looking for an authentic tasting sandwich.  The gentleman behind the register/ then he helped package it up, was not quite surly, but not friendly.  I had said I was a first timer and was all smiles.  You would think they would have been out to impress.  \\n\\nI decided to order two sandwiches.  The catfish, (I was quickly advised that they did not offer a catfish po' boy, just a 'fish' po' boy.  So, I said, \\"o.k.\\"  Then I also opted for a roast beef po' boy.  (I like getting two items on teh menu when it is my first time visiting.)  I asked if it had onions or peppers, and I thought he was going to growl at me. No need to ask for anything special here, I thought.  I asked for the order 'to go.\\" They made it fairly quickly.  I got to the car, and from the 'feel' of the bag, 'cold,' I was worried.  Took a bite of the fish sandwich - cold bread.  The fish was also turning cold, just that quickly from all of the lettuce and tomatoes.  It was just like someone slapped some fish (a very small amount, which I later fed to my cats) on a piece of cold bread and stuck it in a bag.  Less than desirable!  I was ready to pitch it.  Then, with a sigh of remorse, I reached deeper into the bag for the roast beef.  The crunch of the bread got me.  The bread was warm this time and good.  That is the only good thing I can say for my visit.  Crunchy on the outside, soft and tear-able on the inside.  The roast beef had a little flavor, but tasted like it had been cooked a week or two earlier.  It definitely tasted 'old.'  I immediately went home and made my own.  Wasted my money at, 'On the Bayou!'  Will not be back unless it is to buy the bread!  I just wish I could find a place that sells that very same bread, here in the ATL!

Cooked perfectly (can't tell you how many times I've ordered \\"medium\\" at other places and received something that was either way undercooked or overcooked and resembling shoe leather). This burger was perfect, the cheese perfect, the lettuce & tomato fresh, and the special house sauce that topped it was delicious. The sweet-potato fries complimented it perfectly....they're an additional buck but worth it to upgrade (although the regular fries that my wife had were superb also).

If it isn't awkward enough to hear managers pounding the \\"last calls\\" into the heads of servers, and guests alike, how about having a beer (or a few shots) with the server that just waited on you downstairs? In theory, it sounds like a pretty relaxed, casual environment, but in actuality, the crappy attitudes of a select few and the monotonous, profanity-laced work gossip that can be overheard by anyone within earshot is a huge turnoff. I'd have to say the most uncomfortable I've ever been at this location was on a Sunday night sitting at the bar with a friend while literally everyone else in the upstairs bar was an off duty employee pounding back shots and sending off a manger who had just worked his last shift at the store. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for having a good time and working in a relaxed atmosphere, but alienating your clientele and acting like fools is never a good idea. If you truly want to get hammered and act like crazy, go to one of the many bars that are literally in the same shopping center or across the street to do it!\\n\\nThough the upstairs bar can often be incredibly awkward at times, I'd be doing the place a disservice if I didn't cite the terrific bartenders and servers that I've encountered in my MANY experiences there.

The sweet (and scantily dressed) waitress was excited and said how much she'd been dying to try it. When she came out with the entree, which showed up about 5 minutes into the fried onion, one of the eggs was broken and seeping onto the side (two strawberries). Sweet waitress said she had commented about it to the 'chef', and he said that was fine and it would taste the same. REALLY? Well, I guess that should have been my first indication that this crab cake was going to taste like crap anyways. When my sweet waitress asked how my crab cake eggs benedict was, I couldn't help but give her the 'I didn't even eat half of it, what do you think?' look.

I loved all the huge chunks of avocado and the acidity from the lime. It pairs really well with the salty tortilla chips. My bf loved the cheese dip with chorizo. The chorizo was a little sweeter than I like, but the cheese dip itself was delicious and creamy. It's not the artificial, smooth white cheese that you would get at other Mexican restaurants. The cheese dip had some texture which I actually really liked. I ordered three tacos - the al pastor, short rib and mole. All of the tacos tasted great.

If it was a little cheaper, I'd consider coming more often."},{"name":"Barley's Brewing Company","address":"467 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"If you love to try different beers with typical bar food and be surrounded by an upscale clientel, you'll enjoy Barley's. I sat at the bar and was very impressed with the Scottish Ale on tap. They also have a decent $5 happy hour for food as I tried their loaded fries. No complains here. Finally, their wings are amazing. One of the few times when I tried wings that were grilled and not deep fried and they were delicious. Bartending staff was friendly and got my drinks and food in a timely manner on a Friday during Happy Hour."},{"name":"Jiko - The Cooking Place - Temporarily Unavailable","address":"2901 Osceola Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Over this past weekend something magical happened at Jiko; my younger brother who (love him dearly) but rarely tries anything new, was introduced to an array of incredible food, and....he loved it. This sentiment alone could earn Jiko 5 stars (in my opinion). \\n\\nI'm not even sure where to begin, but I do know that the quality of food at Jiko was incredible. Our table shared a ton of food including:\\n\\n- Kalamata Olive Bread\\n- Wild Boar Tenderloin - so delicious!\\n- Ahi Tuna Salad - an incredible cut of tuna, we knew it was super fresh because it didn't have that \\"fishy\\" taste\\n\\nMy entree dish was the grilled shrimp curry and it tasted as amazing as it looked. The curry sauce was complex but not overbearing and the basmati rice (citrus and coconut flavored) was scrumptious. I could have easily eaten a whole bowl of it. The rest of the table shared parts of their dish - and I tried the filet mignon and lamb, all which were exceptional. After thinking I consumed just about everything on the menu, I had to wonder if anything at Jiko was actually *not* delicious. But thankfully I didn't run into this problem. \\n\\nI'm not normally much of a dessert gal, but we all shared the creme brulee and if there;s one thing you have here, THIS should be it. Holy moly it was heaven on a plate. I've had creme brulee a few times and have never been all too impressed, but this was the perfect ending to an already special dinner. \\n\\nAlthough there is seating in the open, we were seated in a room off to the side of the restaurant, which was shared with about 2-3 other parties. This was actually really nice because there were musicians/performers in the main area, but this area allowed us to have a little more privacy (of course the performance would be great if you have kids in your group - we, however, didn't).\\n\\nAs for the service, our server was pleasant and had no problem bringing out the chef to accommodate the needs of 2 members in our party (they have food allergies).\\n\\nAll around everything at Jiko was top notch, and  I feel a little embarrassed not knowing such great food existed in Disney World."},{"name":"The Sandwich Shop","address":"Lonsdale Quay, 123 Carrie Cates Court","city":"North Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"Hidden in the corner of the Quay, The Sandwich Shop- @Sandwichshopca could easily be overlooked, but if you pass by you'll miss out on something special because good things come in small packages.\\n\\nFirstly, I was impressed with Shallaw, the proprietor who is knowledgeable about gluten intolerance food issues. His recipe for Pulled Pork is Celiac safe. He went over each ingredient to be sure. I had it over the slaw and I can't wait to stop by again for more. Not only is this a mad delicious meal, but it's a deal too!"},{"name":"Chick-fil-A","address":"3100 S Cobb Dr SE","city":"Smyrna","stars":"3","text":"As with all Chick-fil-A's that I've been to, this one is clean, well run, has friendly competent staff, and serves consistently high quality fast food Chick-fil-A style and serves the food fast.

However, even if it was 15 dollars for 30 dollars worth, I still feel as if the experience was not worth it.  \\n\\nService: The servers are rude, abrupt and they only come to you to take your order and give you your food.  Even when they do come to give you your food, they just quickly place it on the table and leave. Never stopped to ask us how everything is or gave us any opportunity to talk to them. We did not receive plates before the sushi came and it took me a good 5 minutes for me to track someone down (and they did not even apologize). \\n\\nFood: The food is horrible!.The sushi was all cold and the fish was not fresh  My boyfriend ordered pork skewers and they were raw on the inside!  The vegetable teriyaki contained horrible flavorless teriyaki sauce and it was comprised of mostly just bean sprout. We did not even finish any of the dishes that we had ordered.\\n\\nService: So as very upset customers, we waited for a waiter to come by and see that we were just sitting there ,with most of the food untouched, but nothing. The waiters walked by many times as we were sitting right by the door and they could see that we were very unhappy. They even looked at our table! Nothing. So after 10 minutes, we just walked out.  This will absolutely be my last time.\\n\\nWaste of my 15 dollars."},{"name":"Brick & Fire","address":"1621 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Really amazing crust and pizza toppings.
