Stanley Park Brewing is a rather large establishment and I believe is the old Stanley Park Fish House. It's nice... new... I liked the long communal style tables which would be great for celebrations ect. Stanley has patios on both sides of the restaurant, a main dining room, a bar and lounge and then the area with the communal tables at the end of the main dining area. What really affected my visit in a less than wonderful way was the stand off ish and almost rude ladies working the front.  We were told a 20min wait.... It turned into a 45 min wait and it was frsuatraing because there were tons of empty seats all over the brewery. I checked in with the hostess as I wasn't sure if she forgot about us. Usually, it's pretty easy to seat a twosome, not at Stanley. Be prepared to wait..... Unnecessarily.\\n\\nAlso.... There is no control over where you sit... You just get seated where ever, including the bar. We were finally seated at a high top Table on the bar and lounge side of the restaurant. Surprising that  there was no music on, and we were told by the hostess there was also no happy hour on holiday Mondays (super lame).\\n\\nOur server was lovely.... Friendly and funny. She gave us happy hour because it was already in the computer system, like why would you not! Thanks you so much. I was gonna order a beer flight, but all the beers I wanted to try on the menu were \\"coming soon\\" beers. Why put beers on the menu that you don't even have. So silly. \\nFor happy your you get $4 off pizzas, a few other food discounts and a discount on all the beer and the beer flights.\\n\\nI ordered the Pesto Prawn pizza; was just okay. Definitely lacked toppings and way too much crust in comparison to actual pizza. I ordered a side of tomato sauce to dip the crust in cause otherwise.... My beer was the Sunsetter, which is a refreshing peach wheat ale. Not too sweet, not to hoppy, pretty easy drinking. \\n\\nOverall, the food here is more expensive than I was expecting. $16-18 for a sandwich, $17 for a salad, $19 for basic nachos with no meat or guac. \\n\\nThis is a popular spot.... make a reservation if they take them.

As far as I can remember I've been coming here, and although ownership may have changed the service and flavours remain outstanding.\\n\\nYou can find The Bombay in Westwood Centre, which has two entrances(one on Lougheed next to the Nissan dealership and another on Christmas Way off of Westwood St). Now I know when that craving hits for Indian we all are jumping in the car and ready to go, but Bombay isn't open the traditional hours. They have a lunch and dinner service which means they close between 2:30 to 5:00 in the afternoon for prep. As well they are closed on Tuesday's so no dinner and cheap movies at the theater for you!\\n\\nAnyways, once inside you'll notice it's not overly bright and has quite a nice ambiance. You are quickly greeted by one of their friendly staff members who will fill up your glasses with water and give you some menu's. I tend to opt for the vegetarian dishes such as the Paneer Pakora's, Malai Kofta & Shahi Paneer but the meat dishes like Chicken Tikka and Butter Chicken are super tasty too. Just a tip as well, some the the dishes that are already seasoned with salt tend to have extra salt added. If you aren't a fan of overly salty food just ask your server to simply not have extra salt added. Enough of that though, overall this is a great place to dine and I highly recommend giving The Bombay a try. Your taste buds definitely won't complain."},{"name":"Sapporo Sushi Factory","address":"732 N State St","city":"Westerville","stars":"4","text":"Baan and his wife, Mint, are wonderful hosts to fresh(!) sushi.

There was a wait at 8:30, no big deal though because as I said, we were not hungry, just curious about the hype.  \\n\\nStill, we didn't expect much, since it would seem that most of the enthusiastic Yelping is really about the breakfast/lunch (aka Chicken and Waffles).\\nWe started with the hushpuppies, which were good, it tasted like what it should, but nothing extraordinary. They don't offer chicken and waffles during dinner (too bad), but we got the next obvious choice would be, chicken and mashed potatoes. Oh wow! That chicken!  It is insanely good! The coating for the fried chicken had a great flavor and was so crunchy.  The meat was tender and juicy.  I think it might be one of the best, if not the best, fried chicken I've ever had!  \\nWe also ordered a trio of appetizers, which is a special that they offer.  We ordered a special that isn't on their regular menu (but should be), it was a portabello side dish (regretted not getting the full on this), the gumbo, and the catfish.  Seriously, I would pass on the catfish, if you don't like mushy BUT my boy child said he liked it, so I guess to each his own.  Gumbo has okra, which made it a bit slimy, I wasn't a fan, but my husband liked it.  \\nOverall, it was a good experience.  Our server was really nice too. He didn't turn his nose up at us for ordering apps and one entree to share (5 of us).  I would say, even though there is a wait, no matter the hour it is worth a visit.  \\nPeople weren't kidding when they talked about the chicken.

The food is extremely good as well, so if you're more of a foodie than a sweet tooth than you know what you gotta do: The Veggie Burger was delicious and tasted like a real burger but the best part was the fries, they were delicious. Good tasting food aside, the atmosphere is the real reason you should come to Sugar Factory. Everyone is celebrating something and when their celebration dessert dish comes out (normally one of the giant ice cream sundaes or even a cupcake) the restaurant plays a really loud song and everyone starts dancing, even the waiters!

I ordered the exact same burger that I ordered 2 years ago--black and brie w/ the veggie burger patty and it was not great. \\n\\nWe were there late, 11:30 and they close at midnight so maybe that was why it was not good? But instead of the luscious delicious burger I remember from 2 years ago, what I got was a lukewarm, poorly assembled ghost of the burger I had 2 years ago. \\n\\nEverything looked like it was just plopped together with no care. The cheese wasn't melty at all, the patty center was inedible due to the temperature, and our server didn't once ask us \\"how everything is\\" nor were we really checked on that much at all... \\n\\nMy boyfriend enjoyed his surf and turf sushi. But other than that, I would't go back based on the sad meal I had.

I added American cheese (for a buck, which I think is a little ridiculous). The sweet and tangy pickles added a nice pop of flavor to the sandwich, but it could have benefited from some grilled onions or special sauce (the former of which would have added another dollar). The bun was light and fluffy, which offset the slightly overdone patty. Overall, the burger was good but not necessarily memorable.\\n\\nThe sweet potato waffle fries were delicious. Crispy on the outside, soft and slightly mushy on the inside--just how I like them.\\n\\nI wouldn't describe the service as hospitable, but our orders were correct and our drinks were refilled regularly.

The only plus side is that they had the Coca Cola Freestyle machines, so you had a variety of sodas to choose from.\\n\\nSERVICE (1/5): I felt bad for the cashier, who was attempting to take orders on the register and running to get the food at the same time. I observed a supervisor who was more interested in getting the drive thru line under control than to tame the line that had wrapped through the dining room. Props to her for holding it together, though I could sense that she was very stressed. \\n\\nATMOSPHERE (1/5): While the location is new, it left much to be desired.

The waitress sold us on the \\"Crab Rangoon Dip\\" with her excitement about the dish. \\"It's like Crab Rangoons, but inside out!\\".  Okay fine, it was okay but it's basically a crab dip with pieces of fried wonton wrapper instead of chips.  The wonton wrapper was greasy to the point of glistening, but other than that it was fine.\\n\\nI ordered the \\"Jen's Fresh Find\\" roll because it wasn't fried, cooked, drowned in a ton of sauce, or whatever else is so often done to ruin otherwise good sushi.  It's description states: \\"Premium tuna, cucumber, green onion inside, topped with premium salmon and avocado. Served with a side of yellowfin tuna poke.\\" And at a frankly ridiculous price of $19, I figured it had to be pretty awesome.\\n\\nWell, it wasn't awesome.  It was okay, as long as I didn't think about the price.  It was what I would expect for a roll at a middle-of-the-range sushi joint for about half the price. There was nothing \\"premium\\" about any of it, despite having used the word twice in the description. My favorite part wasn't even in the roll, it was the side of \\"yellowfin tuna poke\\". And that's saying something, because of the bewildering lack of tuna anywhere on it.  It was a small seaweed salad on a wonton with a spicy ponzu sauce.  I loved the sauce and the seaweed salad, but you can't really call it \\"yellowfin tuna poke\\" if it doesn't contain tuna.\\n\\nMy wife ordered the Dynamic Duo burger, which sounded so much more interesting than it tasted.  I had to actually check the burger to make sure that the listed ingredients were in there, and to my surprise, they were.  Where did the flavor go?  And why is this burger room temperature?  Since our friend's burger was also room temperature, we figured it must have sat out waiting for the sushi rolls to be ready.  But this is your deal!  You wanted to do burgers and sushi, it's your whole thing! Figure out a way to time your dishes so they don't go cold.\\n\\nThe also-room-temperature sweet potato fries weren't too bad from a flavor perspective, but most of them were limp and a little underdone.\\n\\nIt's convenient for the park visitors, sitting right in the middle of CityWalk and beckoning to you after a long day of standing in line, but if you've got the time and the desire to explore, I urge you to step outside of the park and find some of the truly great local food that Orlando has to offer, away from International Drive and the attractions."},{"name":"Liberty Pizza of Cochituate","address":"116 Main St","city":"Wayland","stars":"3","text":"Gave them a second try.\\nSandwich was completely wrong and gross anyways.\\nSorry guys, I never give bad food reviews but you need work."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"When people see the Facebook pics of standing in line they inevitably ask the same thing, \\"4 hours for BBQ, was it really that good?\\" I always reply, \\"pretty much!\\" \\n\\nThe food at Franklins out does anything I've ever had that resembles BBQ.

This review was very close to being a 1 or 2 star review.  The only saving grace was that the Dim Sum food was about the best you can get in the Boston area.  (not better than NYC though.)  So we picked this place out because it was actual Dim Sum with the serving carts and not ones you order off a menu.  I'm sorry peeps, if you order off a card its not Dim Sum, its a small plates restaurant.  This turned out to be our downfall though.\\n\\nSo the trick with any Dim Sum restaurant is patience.  You got to wait for the carts to come and sometimes wait longer for carts that have the food you want.  Sometimes you may wait 5-10 minutes and its rough.  I'm a veteran Dim Sum eater so I have patience when it comes to this.  However, the cart pushers here were record breaking bad.  After sitting and waiting for over 20 minutes and not having a single cart even come near us, my mother in law (who is Cantonese herself) decided to take action.  She walked over to different cards and just started telling them what we wanted.  She ended up serving all of our food to us like SHE was the server.  It was absurd she had to do that.  I pointed out her nationality because its important to know that some of the servers may speak little very little English.  She was able to order so easily because she speaks Cantonese fluently.  \\n\\nAgain, I normally never advocate doing this in a Dim Sum restaurant, but when its been 20 minutes and you see them leaning on their carts not moving, it gets frustrating.   As for the food, it was really tasty.  The chicken feet were good, the churng fun was super tasty, and the rolls were fresh.  \\n\\nThey are a little pricy for Dim Sum though.

To make a long story short, FB is worth the hype, but maybe not the price.\\n\\nI'm a fry fiend, so we started with the Black & White Fries---hand cut, sprinkled with parmesan cheese and truffle oil, served with squid ink ailoli for dipping.  Definitely one of the best plates of fries in Portland, but at $8 for a large order, it may be a bit spendy for the budget.  To me, they were worth every penny.\\n\\nThe burgers----I had the Foster Burger ($8) topped with Swiss ($1) and a side of Beer Cheese Soup (.50cents additional).  The beef is local and they grind it there.  The buns are homemade and divine.  It came with lettuce, pickes, onions and Foster sauce (think fry sauce) on the side. This is the best burger I've had in a long time (with the exception of the Heathman).  Milkshake---chocolate ($4.50).  Would be nice to top it with fresh whipped cream, but it was good..  Considering what I've paid at Red Robin (and even Carl's Jr.)  for the same type of meal, I didn't mind paying it.  BUT, paying for three people---lunch came to almost $50 + tip.

Too bad it didn't work out for us as it could make it if they'd change some things:\\n\\nThey need to turn the lights down a bit. They need to use real food instead of buying frozen. The salad bar was horrible. Everything came from a bottle or frozen and you could tell. Instant mashed potatoes, dried out lasagna just to name some. There were only 6 meats that came out...wait make it 7, they brought chicken hearts after our plates were picked up. The meat was very dried out. When they first brought the cheese rolls out, they weren't bad but then a few minutes later as they cooled off, they tasted freezer burnt. \\n\\nSorry but we mark this one off our list.

We def. did not want to chill for 6 hours so you can usually find someone to wait in line for you, for about $100.\\n\\nI don't think I even need to say this, but IT IS WORTH THE WAIT.  For the first time in my life, I had a meal of JUST MEAT.  The hubs and I ordered 2 lbs moist brisket (you can choose moist or lean),  1/2 pound sausage, and 2 lbs of pork ribs.  \\n\\nThe ribs: The meat just falls off the bone and if you manage to pick it up without the meat falling off, the bones will break.  The meat is so tender and juicy and with several sauces to choose from at your table, you can spice it up anyway you like.  Just forget everything you thought you knew about ribs because your about to have your mind blown:)  This is usually the first item to sell out.\\n\\nThe brisket: When in Texas thou shall not go lean.  Your here! Just order it moist and be done with it.  Again the meat is juicy, moist, and just heaven in your mouth. There really is no need to even sauce these guys, I enjoyed as is.  I wouldn't doubt if the lean was just as juicy.  These guys are that good.\\n\\nThe sausage: My least favorite.  I had Salt Lick the night before and I feel their sausage had a lot more flavor.  I would not order the sausage again from here, surprisingly, it was a bit bland to me.\\n\\nLastly, the service is great. Everyone is smiling and having a grand ol' time.

It has to do with the staff. My friends and I walked in the door at about 5:30pm this past Wednesday. There were people at the bar, and one table taken, but otherwise it was empty. We sat at a table and were given menus after the hostess acted as if she couldn't be bothered even faking a simple \\"Hi, how are you?\\" After ordering drinks and some apps, we were bombarded almost every 2 minutes asking us what else we wanted. Now, normally this would not be such a bad thing, but this was the \\"What else can I get you so you can get the hell out of here and I can make more money\\" way of asking it. We had two servers and another employee (may have been a manager, hostess, or bartender - I'm not sure since we didn't see her before) ask us what else we wanted as she put the food down on our table, and when we said we needed a little time to decide what we wanted next, they returned one minute later - and by they, I mean all of them separately within 30 seconds of each other. We weren't rude, spent a good chunk of money, and were pretty sad that we had such awful service because, as I said before, the food and drinks were great.

We were in the mood for spicy food and looked to our fellow Yelpers for where to go. Zam Zam more than satisfied our culinary desire. If you're looking for an elegant restaurant with ambiance to match, Zam Zam is not your place. If you are looking for authentic Pakastani/Indian food, Zam Zam delivers in droves, including halal and vegetarian options.\\n\\nZam Zam was not busy for sit down dinner, though there was a constant stream of folks for take out. It was also a holiday after a major snowstorm, as such on-street parking was actually not a problem.\\n\\nWhile perusing the menu, I noticed a few staples: samosas, naan, curry and of course mango lassi. I then came upon a surprise of surprises, Haleem. Oh. My. Word! I haven't had haleem in years, ever since my Pakistani friend moved away. I had to have it. We decided to go family style and order samosas, dried fruit and nut naan, lamb curry, mutton haleem and jasmine rice. \\n\\nWhen asked by our server how hot/spicy we wanted our food, my guy replied medium for the curry. I replied mild for the haleem and changed it to medium. (Oh silly me, I knew better!) I didn't get too many pictures as once our food arrived, the fragrance had us drooling and we tore into it as though we'd been starved for weeks. Pictures were way past an afterthought. \\n\\nThe meal brought me back to eating with my Pakistani friends.  The lamb curry had tender pieces of lamb in a fragrant sauce. It was mildly sweet with a nice level of heat, medium was perfect. Paired with the jasmine rice and naan... heaven. Now the haleem, holy mouth on fire! I don't know why I overrode my common sense and chose medium spice. Haleem by nature is a spicy dish. This coupled with my weaker palate having not eaten Pakistani food recently, what was I thinking?! Haleem, the flavor was absolutely amazing, and the heat....  Then I remembered...yogurt! I asked our server and thankfully Zam Zam makes their own yogurt (not on the menu $2), it was perfect, just the right consistency of thick and fresh tangy flavor. Just what I needed to cool the fire down and allow me to enjoy a delectable dish. \\n\\nEnded dinner with mango lassi, creamy and sweet. A perfect finish to our meal.

Someone at the hotel that I was staying at mentioned that Cowfish was a new-ish place that had decent food.  So, on a Saturday night at 7, I put my name down to try this place.  It was about a 30 minute wait, which is not too bad for a Saturday night.  They will text you once your table is ready, so you can shop around Citywalk.  Once you get the text, you can check in for your table.  The restaurant itself looked pretty nice.  Very modern and trendy.  There was 2 floors (the main where the sushi bar is and an upstairs).  I got seated in the main floor.  (It is VERY cold in the restaurant so make sure to dress a little warm).  \\n\\nThe menu has both burgers and sushi, but because I was craving a burger, I decided on the Black Truffle Burger.  The burger also comes with a side and I decided on the French Fries.  When my burger came out, I dived right in.  I have to say that I was rather disappointed by the burger.  Although the meat quality was good, my burger itself was rather bland.  Also, for a truffle burger, I could barely taste any of the truffle.  In addition, my bun was so soggy by the end of my meal (which was weird since my burger was very bland). In addition, I know it was a busy Saturday night, but I pretty much never saw our waiter except when he took our order and when we brought out the check.  \\n\\nOverall, I was rather disappointed in Cowfish and will try another place as there are so many other options to choose from in Citywalk."},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Every bite was perfect.

We indulged with milkshakes on the drive to Atlanta the night before, but the next day as we explored the city, we were really excited to try REAL food in the form of South City Kitchen. C wanted to show me a few spots in Midtown to explore, and I searched Yelp for great restaurant reviews in the area to have a late lunch. SCK won out with mentions of soup and fried chicken. \\n\\nI ordered both - buttermilk fried chicken served over collard greens with potatoes, and she-crab soup. The soup was creamy and tasty, pretty much perfect upon adding a dash of freshly ground black pepper. Not too heavy on sherry, as she-crab soup can sometimes be. C got a pimento cheese burger and was just thrilled. He loves pimento cheese, it was cooked correctly medium, and the bun was excellent, I hear.\\n\\nC got sweet tea, which tastes best in GA and SC, I feel. Extra sugar, no doubt. Meanwhile, I ordered a drink with whiskey because I thought it would warm me up on the brisk day, but I didn't like it. Our server Autumn noticed although I didn't say anything, took it off the bill, and brought out tasty banana bread pudding to compensate. Talk about going above and beyond.

The Balm Dot Com was pretty good but nothing to write home about. The second one, Kiwi's Big Adventure was a far better bet and (somewhat sadly) the best thing I had this evening. The food was all lacking something - seasoning, spice, flavor in general. Why are so many restaurants so petrified of seasoning their food?! The worst offender was the Burrata on Waffle(?). WHAT IS THIS I'm thinking as I'm eating another flavorless morsel and why is it even on the menu? The Chicken Thigh Torchon wasn't bad. The Tuna Crudo I had was ok but all the flavor was on the cucumber garnish and not on the tuna. The Patatas Bravas were pretty good but it's kind of hard to mess those up.

Also the secret burger is not bad but not as good as Neptune's or Craigie on main's. The kale was surprisingly good. I don't like kale so I was a little scared ordering it.

When asked if we were ready for another drink, we said no, but were hoping to take our time and stay for another round before heading to dinner.

Although this may seem to be pretty standard pub fare, that amazingly delicious word \\"gastro - \\" brings it to the next level. \\n\\nSimply put, I've eaten pork belly all over the world - I have a minor obsession with it -and this was some of the best I've ever eaten.

From the moment you walk through the door you realize you are about to have an experience, not just a meal.\\n\\nA quick side note. We opted for an early dinner this evening. My wife, mother-in-law, 7-month old son, and I. We were taken to one of only a few large round tops. So often with a small child you're relegated to a corner and have to navigate around your dear offspring to grab a bite. Not so at Bambinelli's. Like a true family restaurant our son had his high-chair and could feel part of the family at dinner - like it is back home in Europe where well behaved kids are an acceptable and normal dinner companion. As our meal went on the kid to adult ratio changed dramatically as you would hope - to an atmospheric adult dinner spot. \\n\\nSo to the food! Rumor has it that at Bambinelli's all the sauces are made in-house from scratch. This is definitely true. A note of warning - IF you want haute new cuisine take yourself to downtown Decatur or Buckhead BUT if what you want is for your soul to be warmed with REAL, HOME MADE, GOOD, HEARTY, FILLING \\"IM AN ADULT AND MOMMA's TOO FAR AWAY TO MAKE ME A MEAL\\" food jump in your car and drive as fast as legally possible to Bambinelli's. The marinara can only be chopped tomatoes, salt, pepper, garlic, olive oil and two or three herbs - AND THAT is what God clearly intended when he gave that recipe to the first Italian grandmother to make a pot of! My wife's Fra' Diavolo was indeed devilishly hot and perfectly Lenten with mussels. My mother-in-law's gluten free pizza made her heart sing too! By the way - you'll also get to leave with tomorrow's lunch! AND if you don't want to leave the comfort of your pajamas they do FREE delivery (it arrives warm and delicious every time!)!\\n\\nAND finally - in case you needed any other reason to get straight over there - the Bambinelli family won't shout about this but when a downtown shelter they know has had food supplies pull out at the last minute, on several occasions, they have made sure that over 100 of our fellow Atlantans on hard times have a hearty warm meal - the shelter director says the ownere never asked for a thing in return. \\n\\nSo, if you want to feel the love of a good meal, have a great time, and support a business that you know is helping those who most need it - book at Bambinelli's."},{"name":"SOJUba","address":"1265 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Good food and excellent service.

However...\\n\\nI've been there dozens of times. I basically always order the same thing (\\"Gold digga\\" poutine, with soft poached eggs and duck fat potatoes). However I've tried a few other things. Nothing they have, in my opinion, is as good as their Gold digga poutine (although it's a bit too salty).\\nThey have very fresh sea food everyday, it's always in quite limited quantities, but I don't like much. I don't think they have great skills in cooking sea food.\\n\\nTheir waffles are nothing exceptional. They're basic \\"OK waffles\\". Not bad, not great.\\nTheir croissants are very basic too, maybe even a bit less than basic, but I've grown up in a country where excellent croissants are cheap and eaten on a daily basis (France) and I've literally eaten many thousands of croissants in my lifetime, so my expectations for croissants can be quite high.\\n\\nTheir brioche is ridiculous though. It's not brioche! It's at most some \\"pain brioch√©\\" (\\"brioched bread\\" if you want). Calling that a brioche is like calling a serving of fries with half a coffee spoon of cheese a poutine. Yes you can, but only if you're fearless!\\nI don't mean that their (fake) brioche is bad. It's not bad. But it's not brioche. It's just some toast bread that had a tiny bit more of butter or cream than regular white toast bread.\\n\\nTheir crepe is nothing exceptional. I do recommend you pass on the seafood version of the crepe unless you already know you'll like it.\\n\\nThe fruits are a bit ridiculous... They don't cut out the skin of kiwis! Why?! I know it's edible, but who eats that?\\n\\nI tried the scrambled eggs once. Poor cooking, poor seasoning, weird taste... Won't have it again.\\n\\nIf you've read this review to this point, you might wonder why I give 5 stars and not 3 or 4. The reason is simple: their duck fat potatoes are the best potatoes I've had in Vancouver and by very very far, and I couldn't even give you an address anywhere in the world that serves better potatoes. I really love the Gold digga poutine and for that dish I could give 10 stars out of 5 (if it made any sense). So for me, that compensates for the ridiculousness of the things they get wrong.\\n\\nI can go every week and not get bored of the gold digga poutine. I couldn't go everyday, because that would be way too much salt.\\n\\nAlso, since I've had dozens of Gold Digga poutines there, I'll tell you this: OEB is not a restaurant that will cook everything the same way everyday. Some days are better than others. Sometimes the soft eggs are super super soft, sometimes just normal soft. For the gold digga poutine, sometimes they cut good chunks of meat, sometimes tiny ones; I prefer the larger chunks because they feel less salty (and less dry) since they've lost less water in the cooking process.\\n\\nIf you don't eat potatoes (for whatever reason), or if you hate that they're cooked in duck fat, maybe OEB is not for you...\\nIf you hate soft eggs, maybe OEB is not for you...\\n\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nOriginal review:\\n\\nBest breakfast / lunch place I know in Vancouver!\\nTheir duck fat potatoes should be standard! They're so so good! Can't believe not everyone is serving them!\\nI've been there many times since they've opened.\\nI almost always go for the Golddigga poutine. Their poutines are the exceptional thing they have. Their waffles are good but more like \\"normally good\\".\\nIf you wanna go for lunch on a weekend day, get on the waitlist 2 to 3 hours before your hoped time for lunch.\\n\\nIf I have friends visiting from far away, that's one of the few places I'd recommend not missing!\\n\\nThe only thing I hate about OEB is that they close at 3pm, so if you wanna have dinner there, it's not possible..."},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"OUTSTANDING!!!

The sushi is decent but I would stick to fishes that are commonly ordered and turn over fairly quickly, such as maguro, hamachi, etc.\\n\\nPrices and values vary. A bento box makes quite a reasonably priced meal. Sushi or sashimi is a bit pricey. Other dinners are moderately priced relative to value.

When I walked into Sarpinos just off Piedmont Rd. in Buckhead it was clean, with a nice modern appearance.  There was only one woman working.   She definitely seemed like it had been a long day already for her as I didn't see a smile when she came out to take our order.  I ordered the Margherita. I usually do this because its a simple pie.  sauce, cheese, basil is usually it.  Although, most places try to put their own twist to it.  So it gives me a good measuring stick of an establishment.\\n     After ordering we didn't get our drinks and being that she was only one working she was now in the back.  After getting our pizza (and drinks) we sat at one of the two counter sections to eat.  The pizza was definitely in the same class as a Dominos or Papa Johns.   They added sliced tomatoes on top (eyeroll) that I will admit were hotter than haiti right out of oven.  There is a lot of cheese.....ALOT....again I revert back to Dominos or Papa John style. The crust is your typical commercial pizza style.  Nothing about the pizza was special but nothing was noticeably bad either.   \\n     All in all it was exactly what I expected.  If your looking for a great pizza spot there are much better options.  But if its a pizza on a friday night to watch a movie with the kids. Sarpinos will do."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

Just the togo order and dine in price bothers me, maybe it's because they're in Portland. But if this happens in Los Angeles the customers who notice it will probably be furious.

The fact that I can build my burger however I want it and not be charged extra for all the specialty toppings, definitely makes it worth it. \\n\\nMy husband stopped at Bay 1 and following the overheard advice of one of the employees ordered the rotisserie chicken with veggies. His sides included mashed potatoes & green beans. Definitely among the healthier fare when dining at a theme park. As he said, it was \\"a lot of cluck for the buck\\".

We were directed to the 2nd floor where we were asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside. We chose inside as it was getting hot and wanted the AC. Our waitress was bright and bubbly and knew her stuff. I was originally going to get a burger because although I love sushi I am not a fan of seaweed/nori but our waitress explained they could make any roll with rice paper instead. Well she sold me. It took awhile to get our food but I am o.k. with that because you know it hasn't been sitting around. I went with the tree hugger which was made with fried portabella mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms, cucumber, red pepper, red onion and basil. It was beyond great. The kids each got a tempura roll and my son got an additional roll called a tropical storm. We all pretty much licked our plates.  Our waitress was around several times to make sure we had everything we needed such as refills, extra napkins and spicy mayo.

The salad was pretty basic and was a self serve station while the remaining dishes were on a buffet style arrangement but were served for you on a tray.  The Goat Curry was the most flavorful, but a bit overly salty.  The chicken in the butter chicken was a bit tough and bland and the sauce was reminiscent to me of Campbell's soup out of a can.  The saag paneer was seasoned well and flavorful.   The naan was nice with a few bits of light char.   Service was very friendly, and while the food wasn't bad, seeing the plethora of 5 star reviews raving about this place led me to expect something more than your average strip center Indian restaurant and on that front, it didn't really deliver.  Also, I didn't look at the menu, but opted for what was ready on the line, so perhaps there was more variety there, but what was available didn't seem unique and I was expecting to see something I wasn't familiar with considering I'd never had Himalayan/Nepalese food before.

Indeed, you can count only 14 such reviews out of the 2375 I've written so far. But I find that all the fawning reviews here defy logic. Maybe they're mostly from gringos who don't know any better.\\n\\nChau Chow City was indeed an impressive venue when it opened 20 years ago, as it was a sparkling, multi-level affair that was probably the largest of its kind in Chinatown. For a long time, it remained the busiest and the best, whether for dim sum or for evening meals.\\n\\nIn recent years, however, the quality and service declined markedly. The dim sum was bland and stuffed with low-quality ingredients, if not outright fatty \\"filler\\" of mysterious provenance. Even with all this lard, or whatever it was, the offerings didn't taste all that good, and they were often left steaming around for ages.\\n\\nThe bad dim sum experience was enough to turn off most Chinese and Asian locals from the evening fare altogether, although I see many non-Asian folks loved it here because it was open late. As I like to say, restaurants that are 3 stars at best when you're sober will probably taste like 4 stars if you're buzzed and 5 stars if you're totally smashed.\\n\\nMoreover, even by the disappointing standards that Chinese restaurants enjoy for cleanliness and service, Chau Chow City plunged ever-deeper lows in its final years. The venue and all the fixtures got quite dingy, and there were so many questionable food safety and handling practices that were out in the open. It's a surprise it wasn't shut down by the health department (bribery investigation, anyone?) before finally closing doors on its own.  \\n\\nAlas, it's no surprise that, as of a few months ago, Chau Chow CIty is no more. It had a good run while it lasted, and for a while it was actually a pretty decent and successful place. Fortunately, its demise wasn't anywhere as disastrous as, say, that of the infamous Weylu's in Saugus.

We got plain cheese, and it was the best pizza I've had since moving to Allston. It was so good, very light on red sauce (a true blessing) and very cheesy. It was also super thin crust and all around amazing.\\n\\nLastly, the bowling - let me preface this by saying I was mislead. I was told there would be bowling, so like a normal person I expected large balls and duck pins. But NO, this was C A N D L E P I N bowling a.k.a. unnecessarily hard bowling.

My favorite was the crab toast as the combination of crab, bacon, and light greens seasoned with a lemon juice/vinaigrette were well balanced. The fried green tomatoes were also good but with a dish that I have many memories and associations with as a southern classic, adding goat cheese was just a little too untraditional for me. If you love goat cheese then go with these as they also come with a delicious tomato pur√©e. The she-crab soup was also very creamy and a good way to start your meal on a cold day.  \\n\\nFor the main course we ordered a variety of things off the menu. If you are looking for a veggie option that is light and healthy then the zucchini strata with tomato jam will be hard to beat. The combination of creamy egg and jam was a match made in heaven. If on the other hand you're looking for something to fill you up all day long, I would order the king biscuit XL or their staple dish of the locally sourced Springer Mountain chicken. The chicken is wet brined in butter milk for two days so it's ridiculously moist and the crust on the outside of the chicken has a delicious blend of spices that puts this well beyond a bland crunch. The collards and potatoes underneath make this a southern staple. The King Biscuit comes in a scallion and sausage gravy along with an over easy egg. The thing that puts this dish over the top was the melted cheese that has just enough of a punch to stand apart yet blend well.

Just let me look at the screen and order through the microphone!!!!!!!!!!! Arriving at the window, the overly zealous manager courteously greeted me, which I appreciate. But his obstructing the drive is very dangerous. Because I had to situate my car away from the window and because he leaped toward a car 2 cars behind me to give them their food, the impatient jerk HAD to drive around me (even though in 2 seconds she would get to leave) and only because of the obstructive but nice manager did I avoid getting scraped by the impatient weasel. This restaurant needs to reconsider their choice of placing human beings in the middle of traffic. It's not safe at all, and did I mention how annoying it is?"},{"name":"Punjab Cafe","address":"653 Southern Artery","city":"Quincy","stars":"4.5","text":"My favorite go to Indian spot in the area! Everything is delicious. The servers are frequently. The atmosphere is casual. We got the dinner for two and was surprised at how tender the chicken tandoori was as it looked so dry but surely wasn't! We also chose the chicken jalfrezi and wished the portion was a little bit larger as we got a lot of naan. We upgraded to garlic naan for $2 which was worth it but wish it was cooked a little more to taste a little more crunch. The gulab jamun is an Indian dessert that is comparable to a fried donut which sits in a sweet syrup, and when I say sweet, I mean sweet.

I like it a lot. I've mostly had good experiences but tonight wasn't so. Our bartender Paul was downright rude. Not only was our service very slow (even though the bar was empty given it was Halloween weekend and everyone was probably too hungover to go out). At around 2:40 am the bartender asked to us to go inside and close the tab. We said give us 10 mins. In the next 5 mins he came out twice again telling us to pay right now or there will be consequences. Me and my friend were just trying to finish our drink but his rude, holier than thou attitude didn't make us feel great, to say the least. Given the poor service and the attitude we got from him, we did not tip him. He called us 'losers' for not tipping. In my opinion you should only tip based on service. It's something extra you give. But if the service is down right terrible why should I tip? Being called a loser in one of your favorites places... just makes me sad. Towards the end he told the bouncer to make sure we are out by 3 am not a second late. He comes out twice again to tell us to leave. Maybe he was having a bad day. But experiences like this makes me not want to recommend this place to my friends. Again, I love this place, but the bartender ruined my night.

You'll likely need reservations to get in here on Friday, Saturday and holidays (Valentine's for example). It's a pretty big venue (200 seats) and has a fair-sized bar for those waiting on a table, so if you don't mind knocking off a bottle of wine while you wait you can skip the reso and try your luck.\\n\\nThe dining room is really bright, as it is wrapped by windows that allow you to marvel at the harbour and the North Shore Mountains. If that doesn't bring home the reality that you're on the West Coast, the food is \\"West Coast\\" cuisine and the wine list features many delicious BC wines. The service is mature and professional yet still very friendly.\\n\\nThe seafood and fish here are usually well done, and Aqua Riva is an Ocean Wise restaurant (committed to ocean-friendly seafood). The Sablefish ($28) will melt in your mouth. There's also chicken, beef, lamb and back ribs for those who like heartier fare.\\n\\nI only had one bad experience when I ordered \\"fresh\\" oysters on the half shell ($2.75 each). I'd had them here before and they were delicious, but this time they were bloated any had an almost cream-cheesy texture in the middle that makes my stomach turn to remember.

I did not realize how small this place was so it was a good thing that we made a reservation.\\n\\nWe were pretty hungry, so we just decided to split several small plates:\\n\\nPuffed pita (3 stars): The flavor of the pita and hummus was good, but I usually prefer my pita to be a little more soft and less crispy. Also, I felt like the dish should have been double the size.\\n\\nPanzanella (5 stars): Oh my godddd...the griddled corn bread in this dish is to die for!! The ingredients on top also added some great flavors, as this dish was one of the strongest of the night.\\n\\nGrilled avocado (4 stars): This dish was also very solid, with the avocado shining through and just the right amount of grilling to heighten the flavor.\\n\\nShrimp toast (5 stars): I am not the biggest fan of shrimp, but this dish had me wanting more. I still don't know what the sauce that it came with was, but it provided a nice layer of flavor on top of the perfectly grilled bread and BBQ shrimp.\\n\\nLamb ribs (4 stars): The meat on this dish is definitely 5 stars, but the difficulty of eating around the bones and the fact that it wasn't served very hot brought the rating down for me a little bit.\\n\\nHalibut (3 stars): Though this dish was not bad, I felt like the fish was a bit undercooked. Also, the extra ingredients did not really come together as well as I was hoping.\\n\\nDessert charcuterie (5 stars): This was the perfect ending to this dinner of small plates. I love having the opportunity to try a bunch of small bites, so this did not disappoint. My favorites from the board were the dessert salami and the buckeye, and I didn't really care for the homemade s'more.\\n\\nOverall, this place has a lot of potential and is still getting its feet wet, as it has still only been open just over 6 months. A lot of the dishes here had great flavors, I just felt that they were a little small for the price. Apparently adjustments are made to the menus daily, which means that there will always be new things to try. As I mentioned earlier, this place is pretty small and I felt like it lacked a certain sort of ambiance, but maybe that was because we were there early in the week. I am curious to see how they continue to develop, as the food is off to a strong start."},{"name":"818 Lounge","address":"818 Main St","city":"Oregon City","stars":"4.5","text":"Love it!

Lately I have been having hot water with lemon during my meals at restaurants, it's been growing on me for a while now.  As each dish arrived, we admired its beauty and quickly dug in and ate like royalty.  I believe it was my first or 2nd time having mussels.  The diablo definitely delivers a nice spicy punch,  I will admit seafood is usually not my first choice for dining but the mussels were just that damn good.  \\n\\nI played it safe and ordered the burger, and believe me that burger is better than what is served in most restaurants in Portland today.  Toasted bun is always a must, the burger was juicy and well seasoned, and the bacon reminds me of how bacon used to be cooked back in the day.  I sampled the steak, crab BLT, and pasta, and those were all winners too.  \\n\\nWe left happy, satisfied, and definitely looking forward to the next visit.

The general experience, apart from the food, was very pleasant. And, despite the problems, we plan to give Zucca another try in the near future (hoping that the problems will have been fixed by then).\\n\\nBut. The food. With only one exception, everything we tried completely missed the mark. The calamari was perfectly fried, but the breading was inedibly salty. And the accompanying pepperoncini sauce/relish was very astringent, and didn't complement the calamari at all. The foccacia wasn't like any foccacia we've ever had before, extremely dense and dry. The suppli weren't heated through, so the little cheese cubes within were unmelted. The sausage pizza was unusually bland. The shrimp scampi weren't shrimp scampi. The dish consisted of overly-broiled shrimp, served with an oddly thick and chunky sauce (mostly almonds?) that, flavor-wise, actively worked against the shrimp. The slider buns were so hard and dry that a serrated knife literally couldn't cut though them. Nor could hungry teeth bite through them. The only decent thing we had was the tiramisu, which Callie offered us as a comp for those inedible sliders. (Except for the dessert, we paid for everything.)\\n\\nSounds like we would never return, doesn't it?

I did not expect Atlanta to have so many awesome restaurants to be honest and it really made me want to go visit Atlanta again in the near future after eating here! My sister and I came here on a Saturday morning around 10:45am and there was already lot of people seated! Definitely recommend making reservations ahead of time especially during a weekend if you can! We got seated upstairs and I loved the simple decors inside the restaurant. It was pretty cool to be seated upstairs too and we were able to see the bar area and the kitchen area from above!\\n\\nWhat we ordered: \\n- Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes: I ordered this one and I can see why it's a popular dish on the menu! The crab cakes and the farm egg makes the most amazing combination ever!! It was super delicious and filling! The salad also was nice and simple and it also came with some potatoes! Mhmm....so delicious! \\n- Signature Fried Chicken: My sister had this one and she definitely enjoyed the whole dish! The fried chicken definitely was super moist when I got to eat try some and the mashed potatoes were also delicious! \\n- Crab soup: We shared a small bowl of this deliciousness! I wish we each had our own but we knew we were going to be full from our main so we decided to share lol. Anyways, the crab soup is simple and delicious. There was some crab meat inside the soup and it was actually quite filling since it's creamy but I'd definitely recommend this soup! \\n\\nOur waitress also was super nice and attentive.

Even though the wait time was 30+ minutes, they had benches outside, a fan+mister along with a water cooler so you don't die in the heat and can stay cool. Overall best bbq spot I've ever been to. The pulled pork plate is what I got along with double mac & cheese for the two sides. We told the waitress we were in a bit of a rush(due to the long wait to be seated) to get to the airport for our flight and asked if we can have the food some out faster than usual. She said no problem. The presentation was as basic as it can get. Only real downside to this place is their bbq sauce variety. Most places I have been to have more than 3-4 sauces. I went with their traditional bbq sauce which had a real nice flavor. By the way, don't be shy to use a lot of sauce on the meats. The more the merrier. The pulled pork was absolutely delicious. It's not as good as Smoked Bar and Grill in PA but till up there. My friend had the brisket which I tried and it just melted in my mouth. You can't go wrong if you go pulled pork or brisket. If you go brisket get the fatty cut and you'll be in heaven. My friends sister got the chicken and it looked like a lot for a half chicken. Maybe it was the lighting but it looked a bit undercooked. If you're willing to wait a bit, the foods well worth it. I'm pretty sure all the bbq plates available come with a single slice of bread on the bottom of whatever meat you got.

The beef burger and bacon  had no taste whatsoever. I think they expected the kimchi and gochujanhg sauce to provide the flavoring. There was barely any sauce and the kimchi tasted weird. I've been to many Korean restaurants and real kimchi doesn't taste like whatever was in that burger. To make matters worse, the fries with the burger was completely bland as well.

Me, I started thinking about how I should've chose a better major freshman year of college. Psychology doesn't pay the bills.\\n\\nBut some of the things Psychology 101 taught me a decade ago still stick with me to this day.\\n\\nTerms like rationalization. Where people tend to justify decisions that otherwise don't make sense. Like waiting hours for BBQ and telling yourself that it's the best in the world because you dedicated your whole morning to it. Bring a book or some TV shows to watch.\\n\\nI didn't think it was the best BBQ in the world. Hell, I didn't even think it was the best BBQ I had in Austin. The fatty brisket at Franklin was good, but La Barbecue is right up there.\\n\\nThere's also the sunk cost fallacy, where after waiting 3 hours and paying for your food, you'll eat the half pound of ribs you ordered, even if they're not that good. You could see the rub, but the meat itself was a bit bland and dry. Didn't fall off the bone at all like others have mentioned.\\n\\nAnd then there's Stockholm syndrome, where hostages start feeling friendly toward their captors. Especially when they lend you lawn chairs and sell you soda and beers while you're waiting.\\n\\nDaniel is a cool guy who just runs around taking people's beer orders while they're on line inside the store. He also helped get me a specific shirt I wanted from the back that they didn't have displayed on the shelf. And he also helped fix a pricing error on my receipt (they charged me for a pint of slaw instead of a single portion, and he nullified the entire side, which was good because the slaw was kind of subpar).\\n\\nThe people working the counter are also cool and take the time to give you brisket samples, answer your questions, and handle everything with care.\\n\\nSo at the end of the day, is this good BBQ?

Banana French toast was equally underwhelming, nothing one cannot make themself. \\n\\nInterior/ambiance is nothing to looked at. Tables are sardine packed with echoes hard surfaces make romantic dining akin an octagon UFC fight; loudness of the place borders headache inducement. \\n\\nPrice wise it is on the high side considering the food was not all that spectacular.

When we arrived, the line was out the door for the hostess stand, and I ran up to see if we'd even have time to wait before the movie.  She said the wait was about an hour, which would have made for an extremely quick dining experience.  I asked if there was open seating at the bar, and it turns out - yes! They have an outside, inside, and upstairs bar.  We all split up to see what we could find, and Kelly H. scored 3 seats at the outside bar immediately. Booyah, everyone in line.\\n\\nWe were greeted by Michael, who was our bartender/waiter extraordinaire.  But seriously, he was great despite the mess later.  We ordered some drinks, and looked over the menu for a bit.  Kelly and Stacy got some kind of burger sushi thing and an order of cheese fries to split, which they were obsessed with. I ordered my typical grilled cheese and fries!  Michael helped me customize it, putting it on texas toast with white cheddar cheese and adding basil. Yummy.  I also ordered a side of garlic aoli to dip my fries into.  He said I could get an adult portion that was much larger than the kids, and it would cost $14. I said that was fine, cuz I was starving.\\n\\nWe were amused at all the issues that seemed to be going on around us.  Each table needed the manager to come by, mostly for long waits for food.  It did take a long time for the food to come out, and everyones seemed to be good... except mine. :(  As Michael would later point out, it seems interesting that the chef can make all these crazy sushi rolls and menu items, but can't even do a grilled cheese right.\\n\\nMy sandwich came out with the cheese melted, but somehow the bread was not toasted at all. Like seriously fresh out of the bag, soft, unbuttered bread.  What? Ew.  I tried a bite just to see.  It was so gross tasting.  I told Michael, and he took it back to get fixed.  When he came back out, I asked \\"Are they just going to put my same sandwich back on the grill, or make a fresh one? Cuz I think if it's the same one, it's going to be really gross tasting.\\"  He went to the back and assured me he'd get a fresh one made.  Kelly H. and and Stacey B. were almost finished with their whole meal when my sandwich came back, and surprise: SAME exacty sandwich with the bite taken out of it. Not buttered. But toasted at least.  Again, took a bite just to see - Soooooooooooo dry and nasty. Not edible.\\n\\nAt this time, the manager, Zack, was at the cash register right next to our seats, and I stood up to ask him:  Is this how your grilled cheese usually is? No butter? He said yes. (ew). I then asked, is it normal to get a sandwich remade and just have the same one you've already bitten into brought back?  He said no.  I then asked, \\"is this the same size portion as the kids meal?\\" He said no, it's the same size.  I then asked \\"why am I being charged $14 instead of $7 then?\\"  He was very surprised for a moment, and then noted that I got texas toast instead of white bread. I laughed and asked, \\"texas toast costs an extra $7?\\" He actually said \\"well, yes.\\" Haaaaaaaa. no.  So then I said, \\"this sandwich tastes so bad since it was re-grilled.\\"  He actually asked me \\"well, can you just soldier on through and eat it?\\" NO!!!!!!!!!! Why would I eat something that I think is disgusting?! And he still wanted to charge me for it! NO!  I said \\"can you please remake it?\\" and he said okay, and promised it would be exactly as I ordered it to begin with, but made right.\\n\\nI waited a while, and the sandwich finally came it.  Except it came out on the thinnest white bread I've ever seen, not the texas toast I was promised.  It was soggy with butter and barely toasted.  I kind of just stared at it for a moment, and Zack asked \\"is something wrong with it?\\"  I said \\"really? look at it! this is not texas toast, and it's soaked in butter to the point of being soggy.\\"  He said \\"well, we wanted to get it out here as fast as possible for you, so the bread must have been an oversight.\\" Seriously. It didn't even come out fast, and then it wasn't what it ordered.  I was so annoyed at this point.  He said \\"go ahead and eat it, and I will only charge you the $7 instead of the $14.\\"  Wait, what? So you'll \\"only\\" charge me what I should have been charged in the first place, but pretend it's a discount. No.  I told him I will not pay for it, as it is not what I ordered, and is still not edible.  He finally agreed, but would not stop standing there making a bunch of excuses and arguing with me.  He was extremely arrogant.\\n\\nIn the end, I was so frustrated by this experience.  I realize all I ordered was a grilled cheese, but seriously... this is my dinner. I shouldn't be a low priority because of what I order.  Zack is a poor manager, and I don't think I will be back.  Again though, Michael handled everything well and was very apologetic.

The experience could not have been better. \\nHere is a short list of things that were awesome:\\n1. Food. We had cheese and rosemary naan, Lamb rogan josh and chicken Korma. All 3 came out excellent! You can choose the level of spice for each dish on the menu. We went with Medium and it was pretty spicy for me, so don't order anything over medium if you are not ready for some good burn. Both rogan josh and korma dishes had a generous amount of meat and you can always ask for extra rice. I loved that it came with only one bowl of rice as first. The described above portion is probably a little too big for 2 people (because of the naan), but most people will find it reasonable. I enjoyed every bite and can't wait to explore the rest of the menu. \\n2. BYOB. We brought wine and they had everything we needed for it, wine openers, glasses and the staff was very good at keeping our glasses full. BYOB significantly reduces the price on the check while allowing you to have a great eating out experience. I treated it as an opportunity to be extra generous with the tip. There is also a liquor store right next door from the restaurant, so even if you didn't come prepared, they got your back. \\n3. Service. Great, attentive staff with a nice personal approach to every customer, yet not annoying or invasive. I understand this is very individual, but if you are like me, who gets frustrated when your conversation is interrupted 8 times in 1 hour with \\"How is everything tasting? Do you need more water? More naan? Want a desert? Need a napkin? How is your day? Anything else?\\" this guys just have it right! They are always there when you need something (even when the place gets busy) and they let you have a good time and talk. They had some good advise on the menu for us, which was very helpful. They were very fast seating people and accommodating big groups, by moving the tables around. Some people seemed to know the manager personally and had some brief conversations with him. Overall I felt like I'm visiting a friend's house. \\n4. Atmosphere. It was very nice and cozy, nothing too fancy but you can feel equally comfortable wearing a nice dress or shorts and a tank top. I liked the lightning and the mural on the back wall. The place is very clean and the music is not loud. Perfect for a low key get together or even a date (when you don't need to impress someone, just want to have a good time). The only down side is it's in a strip mall, so the view is on the parking lot and no outside seating, if I remember correctly. \\n5. Price. Because of BYOB a whole meal for 2 (and we could have boxed some of it if it was not that freaking tasty!) ended up being around 20$ + whatever we paid for wine. Very good deal for as delicious as it was. \\n\\nI loved the experience and the food. Adding this place to the list of my favorite Indian places in Austin.

My husband's chicken parm looked completely different from the one at the next table.  In fact, he wasn't even sure if there was any cheese on it.  It was some chicken under a pile of tomato sauce.  On the other hand, my friend had a veal chop that looked lovely and the other had cioppino that seemed to be fine.   We had used a groupon:  perhaps they felt they didn't have to provide decent food or service because of it.  My husband thinks they ran out of food and had to buy more supplies.  The groupon included dessert, but after 1.75 hours at this restaurant, we didn't even have time for that.  \\nYou would think after waiting so long, they would send over a free glass of wine, or at least have the manager personally apologize.

We were the only ones in the actual store, and we still had to wait well over an hour for our pizza.  Even though I heard them talking on the phone and taking orders, telling people how long it would be to receive their order, they did not extend us the same courtesy; I had assumed that, since the pizzas take very little time to cook, they would be sneaking ours in with the to-go orders, much like when you work at a Drive-Thru and you're making orders for the window and for the counter at the same time.  Nu-uh.  We waited.  And waited.  And waited.  We did get a free half a pizza, but I would rather have been told upfront that they were not going to make our pizza anytime soon.

Odd. Maybe it's because it wasn't lunch time yet? (We were there at 12:30pm) anyways, no one greeted us at the front, and finally someone noticed as we walked in halfway to the counter and told us we'd be seated in a couple minutes.\\n\\nLooking at the menu, prices have gone up by about $3-5 per dish, such was expected due to inflation and whatnot over the years. From the 2 for 1 menu we ordered 4 dishes for 5 people. First to arrive was the Risotto Al Frutti Di Mar ($21.95) with rose sauce (you can choose from tomato, rose, cream, wine, or curry). It was a pretty small portion if it weren't 2 for 1. The risotto was about 0.5 inches deep and although it tasted great, it definitely needed more cream to the rose. Tasted like plain tomato sauce. The mussels were hit or miss on freshness, some of them have definitely gone bad.\\n\\nNext was the Linguine Al Frutti Di Mar ($20.95) in white wine sauce. Portions got smaller for this one, definitely not like the pictures on the menu. The was about a cups' worth of pasta on the plate. There were scallops, mussels, clams, and shrimp in this dish. The flavors were great and noodles cooked al dente. Again, the shellfish was not fresh, tasted fishy and smelled pungent. \\n\\nThen the Fusilli Alla Lucana ($22.95) arrived a little on the burnt side. Interesting presentation since it's covered with pizza dough on top, which helped keep the dish warm while we finished the others first. At this point I didn't understand why they used such large plates if they were only going to fill them 1/3 or halfway because it just looks bad. Anyways, only dish that wasn't seafood, the sausage and pasta was decent. Pizza dough was very dense and although interesting in design, felt disconnected to the whole dish.\\n\\nLast was the Linguine Soul Bianco ($21.95). Last time I came here I got the Linguine Soul which is the spicy tomato base, but I wanted to try something new, the Bianco is a white seafood sauce base. This was very delicious with fragrant herbs and succulent seafood sauce infused in the pasta as it bubbled in front of us. Unfortunately the mussels and clams weren't all fresh, more than half were inedible.\\n\\nIt's sad to see such a great restaurant come to this. The flavors and execution were amazing, but subpar staff, ingredients weren't fresh, and portions were tiny. I was disappointed and unsatisfied with my revisit.

It's the second destination restaurant on my cross country trip. I arrived at 8:45am on a Tuesday and was about 30th in line (40th after the line hoppers showed up. Not cool, people). Somehow I managed to snag a spot in the small parking lot, too. I brought a comfy chair and a cooler with a few bottles of Coke and water, along with a bag of chocolate & peanut butter pretzels from my new favorite, Buc-ee's (review coming soon). The time flew by. Before I knew it, they were opening their doors.\\n\\nOnce the doors opened, it took about an hour to snake my way through the restaurant and up to the counter. They hand slice every order, so it takes a little while, but it is worth the wait. I ordered 1lb of brisket, 1lb of pork ribs, 2 sausage links, 1/4lb of turkey, and a single side of slaw. I skipped the pulled pork. It's not really my thing, especially when brisket is the star of the show. Add an iced tea, some white bread, pickles and raw onion, and I had lunch for the day, plus dinner for the next two nights.\\n\\nTo the meat- the fatty brisket is the best thing by far. I ordered half lean, half fatty, but I wish I had ordered all fatty. The lean was a bit dry because my pieces were sliced off the end. The turkey was also a bit dry. I wasn't going to order any, but the girl working there talked me into it. If turkey is your thing, get some, but skip it otherwise. I'm not a white meat poultry person to begin with. The pork ribs were fantastic. Some of the best I've ever had, and the slaw was perfectly fine. Cool and a little creamy. The sausage links were tasty, but I didn't think they were anything special. The special link offered the day I was there was hatch & poblano chiles with American cheese. I didn't think it was particularly cheesy nor full of chile flavor. It was mostly smoky. Don't get me wrong, it was good, as most sausage is, but I was expecting a little more.\\n\\nIt's amazing what some salt, pepper, and smoke will do to fatty meats. That's all they use here. After thinking on it for a few days, if I ever end up back in Austin, I will order only the fatty brisket and the pork ribs. These two items were head and shoulders above the rest of the menu items, especially the brisket. Maybe I'll visit on a weekend, when you can order the beef rib, but I hear the line is even crazier on the weekend. Also worth a mention is how nice everyone is that works there. You can tell they really enjoy their jobs. If you ask real nice, they'll even let you tour the pits.

For dinner I had the lamb stew (qurma chalaw). My bf ordered the badenjan (eggplant). What came to the table was one plate of rice for us to share, one person could have eaten that rice. My stew came in a little saucer that was smaller than my hand and his eggplant came in a small plate. One person could have had both of those meals. Just the entrees alone cost 14.95 and 12.95. Way way waaaay overpriced. If they are trying to make up for the salad and bread, I'd gladly dismiss the salad and order my own bread. The lamb was nothing to write home about at all. It lacked flavor and was ugly. His eggplant was better than my lamb. \\n\\nIn the reviews, there were raves about the Afghan ice cream, so we ordered that for dessert.

The decor is a bit mis-matched, as there is a statue of a shark in a Hawaiian shirt and sunglasses in the foyer, along with neutral floral curtains, a dark stone waterfall, and a table full of flyers and business cards for local businesses. The chairs at their free-standing tables are on wheels, and look like they were lifted from an executive office in much need of updating.  The restaurant is small, and the atmosphere is definitely cozy within; the music was so quiet that I could hear the conversation three tables away.  We were offered the lunch menu, a double-sided sheet of paper that had seen much use, and had to ask for a sushi menu.  I was a little disappointed at their selection -- for a restaurant with the words \\"sushi factory\\" in the name, I was expecting a great deal more creativity.  However, the boy and I got a laugh out of the offering called \\"American Lovers sushi.\\"  \\n\\nWe ordered salmon nigiri, a salmon and avocado roll, and the samurai roll.  We each received a small bowl of \\"clear soup,\\" which was not miso, and had a few slices of tempura onion floating in it.  The sushi was nicely presented, and while it was certainly better than, say, Benihana's offerings, nothing was spectacularly amazing about it.

Blisters were forming on my feet, and I didn't care.  Well no, if the food sucked, I'd be pissed.  But I was finally here and ready to chow down on some duck.   \\n\\n I arrived at 1:15, and just beat out the other 10 people arrived just after I did!  After getting my food, I hobbled down to the pier, and thought this food had better be worth the blisters.  And it was. \\n\\nI ordered the dirty bowl  ($10) which had Japanese rice cooked in duck drippings, with some pickled slaw, cilantro & green onion, Kung Pao mayo dressing (no idea whats in this, but its tasty), shredded duck, a perfectly cooked oozy egg, and a slice of grilled pork belly.  I'm trying to cut back on my carbs, but not today, no ma'am.  The egg seemed to tie everything together, I loved the sauce on the seasoned rice, the duck was nice and tender. If it were me, I'd hit the rice with a bit of furikake (seasoned mix of dried seaweed and sesame seeds)\\n\\nSadly, I am knocking a star off because of the pork belly.  This was the part that I was looking forward to the most, but unfortunately, it was incredibly dry.  I saw it come off the grill, but it looked like hard stiff cardboard.  It was pretty much scratching its way down my throat.. not nice!   Not sure what happened, but it was definitely overcooked. I don't know, but they probably had an off day, and am hoping its normally a lot more soft and tender, melt-in-your-mouth kind of feel. Anyway, I still maintain that it was worth my walk.  I'd order it again, and maybe pass a word to the chef about the belly, it'd be disappointing if it was dry a second time! Next time, I'd get half rice, and add on more slaw (and a touch more of that dressing).  They also serve a number of different dishes, such as the duck confit \\"philly style\\" sandwich, and another grilled cheese type sandwich, worthy of trying but I'm addicted to the dirty bowl because the slaw seems to balance out everything.  Anyway, it was well worth the 50 minute hobble in the search for one of the best food trucks in the city.\\n\\nSo put your comfy walking shoes on, and get to the Fat Duck Eatery.

It was hot as hell inside, so we sat outside on the shared patio, where every table had an ashtray. The staff had very little knowledge of what on their menu contained gluten and why. I ended up ordering a burger with tempeh bacon, which I was told contained gluten because of soy AFTER being assured that it was gluten-free as long as I had them swap out the bun. I assumed that they didn't know that soy is safe, since they seemed generally confused (they said all the sides were gluten-free, but almost almost none of them are), and later realized they probably meant soy sauce, which does contain gluten. The glutenous tempeh bacon tasted like it was burnt. The guacamole had the flavor and texture of guacamole made in a factory somewhere long ago, and sealed tight for shipping. The bun was tough and overwhelming. My burger was unpleasant to eat in flavor, texture, chew-ability, and (my lack of) confidence in the ingredients. My son got the nuggets, which I wish would have been advertised as being made of tempeh. I was expecting soy or seitan, and would not have ordered tempeh nuggets, as it seems like a strange application of tempeh. He likes tempeh, but these were bad. He threw them away.

Cow GOOD!  Rawr!!  mmm, mmm, smack....buuurp.  ahhhh....ME WANT MORE!!!!\\n\\nFranklin BBQ turned me into a caveman today.  I'm just glad there was no one around to see it.  I needed a shower after lunch.  I had to wipe down the coffee table AND the floor under it (much to my dogs' disappointment).  I found BBQ sauce on my CREDIT CARD hours later.  God, what a delicious mess!\\n\\nI arrived at 10:45 and was STILL 5th in line.  That's gotta make these folks feel pretty good that people are lined up for their tasty meat before they even open.  I chatted with a nice lady in line while waiting excitedly for them to open.  Not fair having to smell that for 15 minutes before...great advertising tho!  I felt like I was in line for a ride at Six Flags.  \\n\\nWhen I got to the window, I ordered a mix of fatty and lean brisket, ribs, and pulled pork.  The nice guy asked if I wanted sausage, and I innocently asked \\"It's just Elgin sausage, isn't it??\\"  He looked at me like I was crazy and then my little ploy worked cause he whipped his sausage out, cut off the butt end and gave it to me to taste.  Now I know that the butt end collects all the juices, but when I bit down, there was an explosion of hot grease in my mouth.  Some may find that pleasurable, but I was a bit turned off by it.  I skipped the sausage.\\n\\nUpon arriving home, I learned that the meat does not travel well.  Be forewarned and put it in your floorboard!  The bag was dripping grease when I brought it in.  I made just enough time to grab a plate, a drink, alot of napkins, a fork and a superfluous knife before digging in.  Turns out, I only needed that fork for the sides (of which, I wasn't crazy about the bitter cole slaw and the mustard potato salad woulda been great sans mustard).  The brisket, even the lean portion, was fall apart tender. I couldn't get it on a fork, much less need a knife for it.  Definitely the lean brisket is the shiznit.   The ribs were fatty as well but tasty.  I even sucked the bones shiny.  The pulled pork reminded me of the pork roasts my grandma cooked when I was young.  And I looooved the espresso sauce!!  Honestly, I bought waaay too much food and paid a hefty price for it, but I wanted to try it all.  I even skipped the pies (they now have lemon buttermilk and pecan pre-made mini-pies for $4).  Of all of that, I would most definitely go back for the brisket.  Pounds of it.  And lemon buttermilk pie. (Speaking of pounds, can we have a moratorium on reviews??  All of these places I HAVE to try are ruining my bikini line!)\\n\\nSo now the only problem is, I don't know when I'll make it back to Franklin.  With their daytime only hours and long wait times, even tho they are minutes from work, they may as well be in Timbuktu.  Now, it's like the frustration of a long distance relationship.  I'll try to make it back to see you baby, when I can get away, but in the meantime I have your perfume lingering in my car and brisket burps to remind me of you."},{"name":"Mongolie Grill","address":"8400 Alexandra Rd","city":"Richmond","stars":"3","text":"Came here with a few friends that have been meaning to try a Mongolian BBQ style restaurant - since Mongolie Grill is probably the most well-known, we decided to hit this Richmond branch.\\n\\nIn short, you grab a metal bowl, walk down the buffet trough, fill it up with your selection of stir-fry veggies, sauces and meat (beef, chicken, lamb & bison), get it weighed and priced and the chef grills it up for you.  It's $2.59 per 100 grams (cheaper if you get veggies-only).  I was careful not to overdo it (some of my friends bought $20 plates) - so my sub-500 gram plate came to $12.  They also give you 'free' soup, rice and wraps to complement your stir-fry.  If you guess the price within $0.10 of actual value, your dish is free.  I was off by about $11 dollars -- oh well.  My friend missed her guess by $0.03.\\n\\nNot sure if I understand the appeal of this place -- if my plate tastes bad, do I blame the cook, the restaurant for poor ingredients or myself for making bad selections?  My plate was pretty so-so - for the same money, I rather leave it to the pros and get similar portions at a regular restaurant.  For anybody that loads up to $20 into their bowl - there's tons of AYCE places with better quality (and portions) at the same price.\\n\\nThe interior is clean and there are tons of seats - but something about the whole process and the staff reminded me of Uncle Willy's -- but more expensive and less food.\\n\\nSo it's mediocre food at mediocre value.

Cambridge area has always been full of amazing little finds, and A&H is no exception.  Located in the basement level of the Brattle Theatre, the restaurant appears small and intimate upon arrival.  However if you step out of the hostess/front area, you'll find yourself passing by the open kitchen (which can get very warm if you sit by there) and a more open dining area in the back.\\n\\nThe menu is based on tapa plates, from lighter items on the left to heavier ones on the right of the menu.  My server was sweet and helpful; she informed us that it's about 2 plates/person.  So my boyfriend and I ordered a total of four:\\n\\n1.  The salt-roasted beets\\n2.  Tuna belly\\n3.  Pork belly\\n4.  Pork shoulder\\n\\nI apologize for the lack of proper dish names, but there you have it.  We ordered mostly on the right side of the menu.  Starting our night was the amuse bouche:  pickled green beans with sesame seeds. It tasted exactly as it sounds.  The first bite was strange but it grew on me right after.\\n\\nThe salt-roasted beets with caraway yogurt and peanuts was light, healthy, and.. salty.  The beets were too salty to eat alone.  Perhaps the chef wanted us to mix everything together, because then the beets were more tolerable.  The yogurt was my favorite part of the dish.\\n\\nNext, we had the tuna belly.  Sitting on top of a sort of sweet corn sauce, the tuna belly had crispy skin.  The fish was not cooked through so as you cut, the tuna belly goes from cooked to slightly raw.  The slice of the belly was a substantial size.  And my only complaint was the crispy skin was a little too salty.  And that seemed to be a repeated pattern for my night.\\n\\nThe next dish is the primary reason I was drawn to Alden & Harlow.  The crispy Berkshire pork belly.  This was his favorite dish of the night.  The crispy pork belly, on top of a layer of grits, with cooked peaches on the side.  Again, I am guessing the chef wants the dish to be devoured by mixing all the ingredients together.  Because the grits was too salty to eat alone.  Someone must've been heavy with the salt dosage that night.  The pork belly, however, was perfect and fatty.  The peach was sweet.  Overlooking the salty grits, this dish was pretty great.\\n\\nThe last dish, also known as my favorite of the night, was the pork shoulder.  It was the debut night, freshly placed on menu.  And I hope for everyone's sake, it will stay on the menu.  The pork shoulders came in 3 pieces, with droplets of creme fraiche and some buttery savory sauce.  Again, the creme fraiche mixed with the sauce was way too salty.  I expected it to be on the sour side; but not the case.  The pork shoulder was juicy, tender, with texture, yet melts with every bite.  It was perfect!\\n\\nI highly recommend this place - would've given it 5 stars if the salt level was more balanced."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

Depending on what time you come, there may be fewer carts/less food rotating around.  I came here today around noon and had to wait 10-15 minutes just for the first cart of food to come around.  In terms of their food, it's pretty standard for a dim sum restaurant.  If you haven't had dim sum before, I like to think of it as Asian-style tapas.  You get to try a little bit of everything.

The big tasty burger was actually not bad so the poor review is more aimed at the turkey burger and side salad.   First of all, the turkey burger was laughably smaller than the regular burger and extremely overcooked.  Secondly, the $4.50 cost of the side salad was quite literally a box of lettuce with nothing else other than 2 sad slices of carrot!!!   Absolutely ridiculous if you ask me.

We had a wonderful cake-tasting meeting with Shamane at her bakery in Boulder, sampling six different flavors of cake (all were delicious, moist, rich, and very edible).  We chose our top three flavors (Almond Raspberry, Gingerbread Caramel, Lemon Ricotta) and couldn't have been happier with how grand the flavoring turned out to be.  We told Shamane exactly what we wanted for the design of the cake - Three Tier, White Buttercream Icing and Fondant Icing with Draping.  We also asked for Sugared \\"Frosted\\" Berries to accent.  Shamane is truly a wonderful person.  She is sweet, thoughtful, welcoming and an absolute pleasure to work with.  She is also an extraordinary pastry chef.  She was a great asset to our wedding team.  Our wedding day took place during a beautiful January snow storm (perfect for our theme) and Shamane made quite the exciting, snowy drive from Boulder to Littleton to deliver our cake.  She was perfectly timed, and the moment we saw the cake, we were blown away.  It was more magnificent, elegant and beautiful than we were expecting, and we already knew it was going to be gorgeous :)  We received so many compliments from our guests, saying it was the most beautiful wedding cake they have ever seen and how delicious it was.  It definitely was the most beautiful, unique wedding cake we've ever seen, and it truly was our dream cake in reality.  The design was definitely \\"us\\" and what exactly we wanted.

Familiar with their ramen and sushi selection, I was stocked to hear they were opening a ramen shop much closer to work.

Many of you wondering what Asian flatbread is-- it's roti. This wrap is very buttery.

Rice, lightly battered jumbo shrimp, chili mayo sauce, scallion, and sesame seeds. You get 5 battered jumbo shrimp on top of rice. Chili mayo sauce is basically spicy mayo + Thai chili sauce (sweet and spicy). I like my food plain, but this was so plain for me. The shrimp tasted good, jumbo for sure. I think adding veggies would make this bowl not only look more appealing but taste better overall. Also, it's odd to me that a lot of the items on the menu have sesame, but they fail to have sesame oil. I think drizzling some sesame oil on this will also add flavor to the bowl. \\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/e-ramen-atlanta-2?select=oKmj1EDm2hRCzdmJBSwsWA&utm_campaign=www_photo_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)\\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/e-ramen-atlanta-2?select=DwSJemgeMyjoFrndzkRP4A&utm_campaign=www_photo_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)\\n\\n* E Signature Ramen ($14.50): OK. Pork broth, pork belly, ground pork, scallions, egg, string beans, chili oil. I'll start by saying...or asking: who puts string beans in ramen? With such an uncommon topping, I hoped that they would be able to substitute string beans for something equally priced. Unfortunately, they are not very flexible so that was a turn-off. The ramen broth was creamy and the soft boiled egg was pretty good. Portion-wise was enough.

Needless to say, they were just as good as the government cheese sandwiches and Jello-mixed-with-Cool Whip cups.\\n\\nNow that I live in Texas and can pick up fresh churros from local panaderias, I yearned to taste the difference.

It doesn't matter that it's 85 degrees out - just do it!\\n\\nThe al pastor torta was stuffed with stunningly tender, pineapple-kissed flavorful pork, generously smeared with perfectly-ripened avocado along with plenty of onions and a healthy hint of cilantro.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"From reading some of the reviews, I must be the crazy one because I am one of the select few who didn't quite warm up to Fox Bros.\\n\\nOn a recent trip to Atlanta, it was between B's Cracklin' or Fox Bros for our barbecue meal and since B's Cracklin' was closed due to a fire, we put all of our eggs in the Fox Bros basket. Unfortunately, the food just wasn't what we thought it was going to be based on the reviews. With 3400+ 4.5 star reviews, the hype train was full steam ahead and could you blame us? Expectations were sky high with each and every review I had read.\\n\\nWe showed up at about 5pm on July 4th, thinking that we would beat the crowd, but were we wrong. There were throngs of people not only waiting to dine-in, but for pick-up as well. As we later found out via our waitress, they had so much take-out business on July 4th that they had run out of brisket by 2:30pm! The first question that popped into our heads were \\"Are you serious? 2:30?! .... 2:30?!\\" Apparently, unlike years' past, the restaurant was not restricting how much customers could order for pick-up, so people were going all out on their brisket orders to the point they ran out early. That was completely unacceptable and disappointing to hear, and worst off we were not told about it until we had sat down. We might have reconsidered eating here if we knew earlier. A definite word of advice going forward would be to limit how much could be ordered for take-out per customer, or either limit how much could be ordered for take-out overall for the day, so that at least dine-in customers have a chance to try it beyond 2:30pm.\\n\\nAnyhow, although that was a damper, we refused to let that ruin our meal. When we arrived we were told it was about a 1 hour wait, but luckily the turnover was quicker than expected and we were seated within 30 minutes. As a full-service restaurant, there was quite a lot to look at on their menu. It was more than usual at Barbecue restaurants - Appetizers, Salads, Sides, Sandwiches, Plates, Solo Items (pulled pork, beef brisket smoked chicken, short rib, spare ribs, sausage by the pound), Dessert - but we already had our minds made up as we scanned the menu during our wait. We tried to order what we had read was popular, at least in terms of appetizers and sides, but the meats were definitely lacking because we didn't have any brisket to choose:\\n\\nFamous Smoked Wings - Basically, these were hickory-smoked wings. We asked for them dry since the sauces were on the table and we could dip them freely, but in retrospect, I would have ordered them wet because they were really dry without the sauces.\\n\\nChicken Fried Ribs - Definitely the best part of our meal, by far. These ribs were thick, heavily breaded and fried perfectly. It was something that we had never tried before anywhere and it was really tasty. Surprisingly, although it looked dry with the breading, the ribs were quite juicy.\\n\\nClassic Combo (Meats: Pulled Pork and Jalapeno Pepper Sausage Sides: Chili-Mac and Brunswick Stew) - I'm not sure if we were full, but everything was just average or even below. The pulled pork was really dry and needed tons of sauce to make edible. The sausage was my favorite part of the combo plate, but my wife wasn't a fan. I loved the cheese filling and jalapenos spread out as they added more flavor to it. If you've ever had a cheese dog with the cheese filling inside, then you'll know what I'm talking about, except the serving is way bigger. I wasn't too impressed with the sides either. The Chili-Mac and Brunswick Stew were pretty much the same thing, which I should have known, but nevertheless nothing about the flavors were great. It was pretty average.\\n\\nClassic Combo (Meats: 1/4 Chicken and Ribs Sides: Brisket Chili and Frito Pie) - Unfortunately, we were so stuffed, we took the chicken home and never got a chance to eat it, so I can't grade that. The ribs weren't bad, but could have been more tender. The meat didn't exactly fall off the bone. We were really looking forward to the Frito Pie for some reason because it probably reminded us of those crazy childhood creations that we made as kids .. and guess what .. it was exactly that. This is probably something a 5th grader could have concocted with a little creativity. It had chopped onions, shredded cheese and chili inside mixed together with crunched up fritos. It taste exactly like it sounds.\\n\\nFrankly, it sucks that such a well-reviewed and popular restaurant was disappointing. I have not run into too many of these situations before, but it's another lesson in \\"don't believe everything you read\\" and that's why you must always try it for yourself to really formulate your own opinion. Lesson learned with Fox Bros."},{"name":"Condado Tacos","address":"132 S High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Finally checked this place out after numerous friends have recommended it to me.

Happy hour is 1/2 off so that's a great time to go back. The ghost pepper steak taco was excellent, and the brisket was pretty good as well.

He says he was in training. He called all the female diners, \\"Love\\" and we thought it was so sweet. He advised us that the chefs heavily season the meat. After we each ordered steak instead one ordered the burger, our drinks were brought out promptly. Then the salads followed. My husband is super picky when it comes to steak. His was perfectly cooked; medium rare and the cut made it extra tender. Melt in your mouth. He came home and made steaks with the Longhorn copy-cat recipe because this was the best he's had steak in a very long time. Our sister enjoyed her meal including the salad which she normally doesn't care. Her steak was equally as delicious. She raved about it the second day that she'd like more steak. My steak was cooked perfectly. I normally eat steaks with steak sauce but in this case, I didn't need it. The portion was enough to be full. \\n\\nOur waiter is so awesome as well.

I arrived here at 11am (opening time) on a Thursday and there was already a line. As I got in line one of the workers told me it'd be approximately a 2.5 hour wait (it was more like 2 hours) to get your food. Some tips, they tend to run out of pork ribs the fastest so if that's what you're looking for it's best to line up early. They also sell alcohol here so as you stand in line, having a beer or two probably will dull the pain of waiting. \\nThe Food: I had the pork ribs, brisket, and sausage along with potato salad and coleslaw. All were great (potato salad is mustard base, not a fan but it wasn't bad). As cliche as it sounds, the brisket was truly moist. They let you choose whether you want more fatty or lean brisket. Pork ribs were delicious as well topped with their bbq sauce (my preferred sauces were the original and spicy bbq). Is Franklin's worth the hype? Absolutely. It is by far the best bbq I have had. I guess my only complaint is that they don't serve beef ribs.

The time flew by because we got to chat with people from New Mexico, Ontario and Australia. We sipped coffee, tea and beer in lawn chairs while waiting. It was extremely comfortable.\\n\\nThe staff at Franklin's were very considerate and friendly. They told us we could grab lawn chairs under the stairs.

The graham cracker crust had a crunch. The bandana cream was so velvety and the pie had layered slices of banana inside. It was not too sweet. Also it was a great contrast to The buttery richness of the brisket.\\n\\n Cons:\\n\\nThe ribs were a little dry but very flavorful.\\n\\nThe brisket was so rich that you could only eat two or three slices before being saturated.

The pizza it self was lighter then expected (Jumbo 18-inch), but did have a airy crust and dough. It was similar to a national chain's pan pizzas but it wasn't dripping in oil which was nice.

The last few years I will admit to becoming a bit of a bbq snob. I've never really liked the East Coast way of doing bbq whether its putting coleslaw on my bbq sandwich (gross) or the Carolina style sauces (also gross). I am a Texass bbq consumer and while I will occasionally indulge in chain bbq places (ie: Billy Sims, Ribcrib etc) I prefer the places that turn simple smoking and cooking of meats into a work of art (Snow's, Franklins, Pecan Lodge, Burn Co etc). I was hoping for a positive new experience based on the large number of Yelp reviews for this place. Unfortunately it was not to be. I like the interior with the blues being a major theme in the decor. It's not a very large place but seats quite a few people. However it takes more than that to be a good bbq joint. I am always suspicious of places that cover their meat in sauce before they hand it to you. Really good bbq meat doesn't need sauce. Sauce covers up the flavor of the meat.

Myself, husband, and our son. Online it states appetizers are provided during the pre show, so we did not eat most of the day. Upon arrival and waiting about 30 minutes into the \\"pre show\\" nothing had come out. We were then advised it was only for VIP guests (not stated on the website that way or when I called to confirm prior to arrival). Additionally, they ask you arrive 90 minutes prior to show starting for again, the \\"pre-show\\". We were there at 6pm (which is when I was told the doors opened ci telephone that morning) and stood outside in the rain until about 6:45pm.There was no pre-show until about 10 minutes to the actual show starting. So it was a crowded room filled with people and nothing but a bar to purchase drinks from. Our son ordered soup as his appetizer, when everyone's salads were brought out- we again asked the server for his soup. He had forgotten. My sons soup came as entrees were being delivered. Free soda and water is provided during the show. 6 people per table and only 1 pitcher of soda was provided and we asked several people to refill it and for a pitcher of water for myself- we kept being told we had to wait for our server. I only drink water, so I spent most of the 2 hour show with no beverage. It was also SO loud, I had to makeshift earplugs out of the ONLY napkin we were given my son's ears. 1 napkin for 3 courses? It made it hard to hear clearly due to the extremely high volume which was unnecessary. \\n\\nThe food was a good portion, but not much flavor and does not come out as pictured on the website. We only saw our waiter when he was delivering food- and again, no other waiters would help. My husbands fork was taken with his salad and another was never brought out. We shared a fork for both our meals, because again- our server was no one to be found and every other person refused to help saying \\"you have to ask your server!!\\" My food was actually taken from me when I wasn't even finished eating it (I was near the stage as a guest for the treasure hunt) he ran off before my husband could say anything. \\n\\nThe show itself was just ok. Not bad, but not every exciting either. We also were asked to tip a minimum of $5 per adult and $3 per child. Being in hospitality, we tipped, but the way we were asked to do so and the lack of attentiveness- I felt it was not deserved. My biggest pet peeve was not having a simple glass of water most of the show. \\n\\nAll in all, it was an experience, and I am glad we did it using a coupon instead of paying the full price per ticket. However, this is not a show I would recommend or come back to..."},{"name":"Hei La Moon","address":"88 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I came here in a group of 7 on a Sunday around 1 pm for Dim Sum.

Still, this is tremendously helpful considering the absolute shortage of parking in this area.\\n\\nAtmosphere: This place is jam-packed??? Two large banquet hall style rooms were full of tables AND people (one on the ground level and one downstairs). Plenty of space and not terribly loud. Decor and vibe were authentic-feeling.\\n\\nService: Nearly everyone speaks only Chinese with extremely limited English-speaking skills. This was remarkably inconvenient and mandated a seat-swapping to allow for the Chinese-speaking members of my party to sit near the aisles where the Dim Sum carts come by. They do serve complimentary hot tea.\\n\\nFood: Dim Sum here was hit or miss. Some dishes were spot on delicious and others were either over-seasoned or unappealingly oily. Perhaps it's my lack of appreciation for authentic-appearing Dim Sum, but, as a non-native, casual Dim Sum eater, I was not entirely satisfied with my food here.\\n\\nPrice point was very reasonable. $12.50 per person, and I left with a ~70% full stomach.

It came out on a sizzling plate with a side of lime and hit every high note I wanted in tandoori chicken, perfectly seasoned, moist, and roasted on the outside. The momos tasted like Chinese dumplings with curry powder mixed in and it wasn't worth the price IMO. The chicken tikka was tasty and had good flavor, tasted very cinnamony. The naan was okay. \\n\\nOverall, it's definitely probably one of the best Indian restaurants in austin but I can only speak for the Indian food and not for the fusion items they have on the menu.

The restaurant is located at beautiful Scioto Mile. It is always very nice to walk around after dinner. This year, we had kiwi smash and raspberry julep for drink. Both are fruity and refreshing. Nice summer drink! We had calamari and pork belly for appetizers. We always order calamari when we see it on the menu. It is very interesting that we see how the restaurant changes different styles of making calamari dish throughout these 6 years. For this Nashville style calamari, visually it looks like Nashville style, but for the taste, I think it is missing some flavors other than the hot sauce on the calamari. Honestly, I like the original version of the calamari the best (fried it, with some sweet red peppers, and two different sauces at side.) I wish the restaurant would bring back that version of calamari. That was the best I had in Columbus! For pork belly, it was so delicious!! They cooked pork belly perfectly. The texture was so soft and and it was very juicy. They used vinaigrette to balance out the sweet peaches. For entrees, the burger is classic and has good quality of beef patties. The cauliflower dish was tasty. I wish there were more coconut curry sauce in the dish though. In the end, I just had rice and cauliflower to eat. It got dry overtime. The lobster dish was light and delicious. I appreciate the fact that they didn't just boil the broccoli and serve to the customers. They were seasoned well. Also the sauce was not too buttery or oily. It had amount of flavors, and I think different kinds of tomatoes helped add extra flavors to the sauce as well. For desserts, I loved the pana cotta. It was perfect texture and flavors. But I was not the fan of the bread pudding. Overall, great service and delicious food as usual. The food prices are very reasonable.

For four years I pretty much only came for the chickpea fritter (also guys it's just called falafel, why we gotta be all hipster with it?) after a meh experience with a sandwich that had too many cold and hot components for my teeth to enjoy. \\n\\nRecently when I came in to order my typical chickpea fritter, the staff member suggested that since I am from the area, I should pivot to trying out the seasonal menu instead. So I did! \\n\\nI tried this Nashville hot mushroom sandwich and I LOVE it. Really nice flavor and texture from the breaded and fried mushroom, and came with a nice garlicky mayo sauce with some veg and hot sauce. Not very hot but very palatable for a general audience. \\n\\nI wanted this sandwich again so I came back two days later and it wasn't on the seasonal menu anymore (cue internal screams of sadness). I ended up trying something else on the menu which was a the Japanese sweet potato sandwich. It was okay. They had the fried mushrooms as a side so I'll let it slide. But i really wanted it as a sandwich. Maybe I should have asked.\\n\\nThen I came back again a couple days later which an old friend that was back in town and he really wanted to go to Clover so here we arrived yet again (really exceeding my Clover quota for the month). I got the Sharan sandwich (really blindly following that guy's advice to try lots of new things) which is an indochino fried cauliflower with slaw and crisp rice noodles. Loved the flavor but was really annoyed that it was dripping oil everywhere. I used like 7 napkins to sop it up and it kept getting on my hands and also making the bun soggy. \\n\\nSoooo yeah I'm not sure, I'm very conflicted. The average of 5 star and 3 star shall be 4 star.  But if I could give 3.5 for consistency I would. \\nSometimes I find stuff I absolutely love and sometimes I walk away wishing I just stuck to my chickpea fritter life....\\n\\nProbably will keep coming and trying new things because it's right around the corner from work, why not."},{"name":"Da Bomb BBQ","address":"744 Broadway St","city":"Revere","stars":"4.5","text":"First time eating here and last unfortunately!

He at least listened - which was extremely helpful and nothing like anyone else we had encountered there. The best part of this place was the broken down pirate ship and equally broken prop box out by the trash can.  We got some great pictures in their Pirate Junkyard.  Total class all around . After 30 minutes holding with Expedia who was trying to call non-stop and getting nowhere (Expedia was just as confused as were were) we were told they would speak with the manager tomorrow who would give us a refund.  I'm sure that will be a smooth experience as well given the Pirate Show track record to date."},{"name":"903 Mills Market","address":"903 S Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"GAHHH!

It was chunky and delightful with salty bits of ham, perfect for a brisk yet sunny day!\\n\\nI made it a combo ($7.99) and paired the soup with a half of the 903 Signature Chicken Salad Sandwich.

It's a proven fact, something simply comforting in a dish of fries (or frites), gravy, and cheese curds. From what I'm told, poutine is also awesome hangover food. Not that I'd know (no hangovers in my life).\\n\\nI walked inside on Halloween (Wednesday) for lunch. Not many people were inside, so I could sit anywhere I wanted. Pretty dim lighting near the bar. The bar stools and tables closer to the exit have much better lighting.\\n\\nThe online menu had about 5-6 different types of poutine, but the current in-house menu only has three. I tried my luck with a FoPo poutine ($8 small, $11 large), where sauteed onions and diced pork belly get added. The usual plain poutine would be $6 for a small, $9 for a large.\\n\\nThe online menu is different and appears to be outdated. There were apparently more poutine options in the past, but it's been trimmed to just three.\\n\\nI've found that the gravy really becomes the telltale sign of how the poutine suits my taste buds. This one, a veggie-based light brown gravy with ketchup and wine added, was pretty good. It had good thickness and a bit of sweetness. They use Beechers cheese curds here.\\n\\nUltimately, I didn't think the pork belly added much to this one, mainly because there wasn't much to speak of. Tender and juicy, yes. A hint of savory smokiness, yes. Maybe if I had more actual meat to rave about (instead of being 90% fat), it'd be more worth it.\\n\\nThe buns here are from An Xuyen Bakery, literally next door. No problems with that. The \\"Burner\\" seems like the choice for the spice-lover. Sriracha, fried jalapenos, and onion strings FTW. Hmm. Got anything spicier?\\n\\nThere's also a large banana split on the menu for $13. Two bananas, 10 scoops of ice cream, etc. That's definitely right up my alley. The \\"regular\\" version is $5, if you have the more normal appetite.\\n\\nFYI, Happy Hour is from 3 to 5:30 p.m. $5 burgers, $2 PBRs.\\n\\nThe FoPo poutine was OK overall, but I may have been better off this time with the plain poutine.

So I decided to order a Mondo burrito added extra meat and toppings almost to a total of a $7 burrito ( that included the extra 50cent price of sour cream) no problem. Then the same burrito duplicate.and a 2 Enchilada platter. Well the total first came to $15+ ok, then the guy says, \\"Oh theres a mistake\\" and he says I have to charge you $4 extra more.... \\"Why\\"? I asked. He then started pointing out that each shredded beef extra is 50 cents more, and I acknowledge it because that was already on the receipt which I didn't mind and I pointed out I already was charged for the extras,  a total of 3 servings of shredded beef TOTAL (2 serves on one burrito and 1 single serve on the other) that would equal to $1.50 , the extra for sour cream was already charged on there too totaling $1.00 and it says right there on the reciept.... $2.50 extra toppings MAX.... \\"so where do you get I have to pay an extra $4.00 ?\\" I asked him.  He then couldnt come up for a reason just said I have to pay another extra $4.00 which would make my bill to around $20.... well that would not make sense because the Enchilada Platter was $6.50... a regular Mondo burrito was $6.00 , mind you that the substitution for regular meat for shredded beef was 50 cent for each serve so I had 2 one 1 and 1 on the other total of 3 servings. $1.50. \\nNow both burritos also had 1 serving of sour cream which would come to another $1.00 so it would be $2.5 altogther extra which I was willing to pay, but then he said I HAVE TO PAY AN EXTRA $4.00 on TOP OF ALL THAT??? MAKES NO SENSE. If the burrito I ordered came close to $7.00 and $6.50 for the Enchilada meal, then it should be around $13-$14 TOTAL.

The service is great. I actually got the same server twice. He's very knowledgeable about the different steaks and its cut. I like that they offer steaks from regions that I don't see elsewhere. However, I did find their steak to be a bit more on the simple side. I know simplicity is the key to steaks but the steak itself felt a bit underwhelming in flavour (maybe some more salt and pepper to enhance its natural flavour). \\n\\nAnother thing I enjoyed while dinning here is that everyone on the table can choose the same cut but from different places and you can taste the difference in the tenderness, the fatiness and flavour. \\n\\nWhat I do recommend at Elisa is their tartare. Soooo good. Both times we've ordered tartare and it's blown us away. The first time was the special of the night and it came with caviar (5/5) and the 2nd time was the bison tartare (4.5/5) on top of a toast. The 2nd one isn't that great for sharing since it's over a toast but definitely recommend it if you like smokey flavours. \\n\\nSteak cuts that I've tried:\\n\\nAlberta Wagyu coulotte (3.5/5): So apparently this is a cross between an angus and wagyu. Well.. it didn't specifically say on the menu so I was expecting ultra tender wagyu and got disappointed. I overheard on my 2nd visit that it was a crossbreed which explains why. I'd say I've had better Alberta steaks. I didn't think the wagyu did much to it. \\n\\nHolstein dairy cow, wisconsin striploin (4/5): Seems like the Holstein is a popular one so I decided to give this one a try. Now most people I know got the ribeye but I opted for the striploin as recommended by the server to be less rich and heavy. I personally like the striploin cut more than the ribeye (in general) so was happy to go forward with his recommendation. This was super tender and it was rich indeed. Not sure if I can do anymore richer than this. \\n\\nblue dot, prince edward island striploin (3/5): You don't see PEI steaks too often so we had to give this a try. It was definitely less tender than the Holstein but this one is beefier. \\n\\nOverall, really enjoyed the tartares. I enjoyed trying less often seen types of steaks. I do think they could do more with seasoning as the steaks felt really bare. It does come with a red wine jus but good steak should taste good one its own with just salt and pepper."},{"name":"The Steakhouse at 9900","address":"9900 SW Canyon Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Excellent local steakhouse!

Like I get it, people love this place and the service is very friendly and personalized (they sent a staff member to give updates on the line every so often!), so something makes it worth it. And the brisket is almost that. It's probably one of the best brisket I've found, but I'm not sure it's worth waiting hours for. In addition, I felt that the line could've moved a bit quicker if they had more than 1 person carving at any given moment. It almost feels like the line was manufactured and artificially longer to inflate the hype for the place. You can find slightly less awesome brisket for much much shorter lines elsewhere around Austin. \\n\\nAnd maybe this is blasphemous to say, but I found the sauce underwhelming. Luckily, the brisket stood very well on its own, with the added zing from a few pickles.  The pork ribs were good. Amazing texture (falling off the bones), but slightly too salty for my taste. The sausage casing was too chewy, which negated the great smokey flavor for me. \\n\\nI'd go back for the brisket, not the hype or the lines."},{"name":"Sugar Factory","address":"8371 International Dr, Ste 70","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"I think this is the perfect place for a celebration or to people watch.

I brought home the leftovers with the intention of putting them over rice and drizzling with soy sauce...really how this should be prepared. \\n\\nAll in all - reasonably priced, good selection including many veg options, decent drink/beer list, average service.

The bread and spicy dipping sauce was a nice surprise. For mains, my mother got the raspberry mousse stuffed French toast. Huge portions. Overcooked though (and took quite awhile to come out) so one side was very burnt and inedible. I went with the steak and eggs. Steak was great, actually tasted medium which is hard to get sometimes in restaurants. The egg was way overcooked. The yoke was dried and it was burnt. Yuck. The potatoes were on a bed of some weird slightly sweet and tomato like sauce. I didn't like it at all. When we told the waitress she said we should have requested it without it.

We had high expectations for BiSq, since they frequently make it on a lot of Boston foodie lists. MAN, how disappointing. After this experience, my husband has sworn off eating at any Cambridge (besides Harvard Sq) restaurants. \\n\\nThe restaurant opens at 5:30. Our reservation was at 5:45. I don't know if this has anything with us being the early birds, but this restaurant smelt weird, like cleaning supplies.\\n\\nOnce we were seated, the waitress asked if there were certain foods that we were allergic to / couldn't eat. I told her that I was pregnant so I was on a restricted diet (i.e. no fish, raw meats, etc). FYI, the prix-fixe isn't like traditional prix-fixe restaurants, where each person gets their own dish. It is a 2 per 1 dish type of restaurant = sharing plates.\\n\\nThis is what we got:\\n1. apple, fennel, pistachio, dill vinaigrette salad - we were both not a fan of this\\n2. beets w/ goat cheese - the waitress did not tell us if the goat cheese was pasteurized; basically just handed this dish off to us and disappeared to who knows where so i couldn't really eat this\\n3. gnocchi  - both of us loved this one, especially the green sauce. The only thing we did love.\\n4. swordfish - i couldn't eat this b/c pregnant women can't eat fish w/ mercury\\n5. steak  - the chef was nice enough to make me a medium steak, whereas my husband had his medium rare; did not standout\\n6. cheesecake w/ kumquats and graham cracker crumbs - again, i couldn't really eat this b/c the waitress never told us if this was pasteurized. my husband said it was not memorable\\n\\nOverall, the food did not impress us and the service wasn't what it should have been at a restaurant like BiSq. It's really bad that our waitress couldn't alleviate our fears about whether or not I could eat a food item. I understand that not all waitresses/chefs are aware of what pregnant women can eat, but (1) we booked this reservation one month in advance and I specifically called out that I was pregnant and may be restricted from some food and the res was for the 6 course prix-fixe menu so they could have prepped this properly and (2) you can always google what a pregnant women can/can't eat."},{"name":"La Cava del Tequila","address":"1200 Epcot Resort Blvd","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4.5","text":"My favorite country in EPCOT has always been Mexico.

But its a wonderful place to go when feel like you want to drop off the grid and take a break from Disney, and/or your travel companions. Granted, its Disney, so there's a lot of foofy drinks on the menu and the prices are kinda ridiculous. But you're in Disney, so you pretty much signed up for that to begin with. But set that aside.

It should be noted I'm not a self proclaimed BBQ aficionado like some. I  was staying in the downtown Austin area and discovered I was only minutes from Franklin's. I had heard lines could be long. It was a warm spring Saturday afternoon so I figured why not try BBQ for lunch and if I had to wait It was in warm temperatures compared to the east. I arrived about 10:00am to a crowd that had already formed. It was fun people watching and even talking too people who came from all over to taste what they call the holy grail of BBQ. The line seemed to move pretty quickly although it was more like a two + hours wait until I got inside. Decor was cool lots of awards and people siting a picnic tables eating massive amounts of meat. I finally reached the counter and ordered the brisket platter. After finding a communal table I sat down and began my BBQ tasting test journey. First bite was an Interesting flavor and I was surprised at how a beef brisket could be both lean and fat at the same time. I was amazed at how it fell apart. The flavor was very good. I sampled all the sauces that were offered at the table but found that I pretty much preferred eating it naked rather than covering it up.

But it was torture, as the place she mentioned was in Atlanta, and not Memphis (my private jet is being serviced in my private hangar).  \\n\\nThe torture gets worse.  In October, I went to Total Wine to procure my favorite brew of all time (which they SAID they had)- the Southern Tier Creme Brulee Stout.  When I got there- they said some place called \\"Palookaville\\" bought all of it.  I mean, WHAT THE HELL!?!  With that being said, this place was my list, not sure though if it would be on my shit list or hit list, but I knew it would be on one of them.\\n\\nLast weekend, I had the opportunity to go- so you better believe I went!  I had the pleasure to go with Atlanta Mayor Daniel B, and awesome Vyvy T.  I rarely make it to Avondale Estates, so it was a treat to go.  I saw it on the corner, and then I asked myself, \\"where in the hell am I supposed to park?\\"  Thankfully, if you go around back, follow the fence and go down a hill, there is plenty of parking- complete with trees, benches, and a police station.  My car didn't get towed so I assumed it was legit!\\n\\nAs we walked in, all I could think of was Willy Wonka and FAO Schwarz had a baby, and Palookaville was the result.  I really don't know how else to describe it.  There is a patio, a food truck, plenty of tables on the inside, and a bar to sit at as well.  \\n\\nWe waited about 5 minutes to get a table, which wasn't bad, given the fact it was Sunday afternoon and a nice day outside- so I will take it!  The table we sat at came from an old (I think) Chinese restaurant, and the chairs looked like something that came out of kindergarten in the 80's.  It held my weight, so it was all good!\\n\\nWe were then greeted with a gentlemen with an iPod (thats how he took the orders) and menus.  The menus were almost overwhelming- especially when they brought the drink menu!  \\n\\nI tell you what- they make their money on the drinks here.  The have countless amounts of house made sodas, and you can mix them with whatever.  I decided to start off with a sour cherry soda and Maker's Mark.  Worth a try.  I think after that, I may or may not have lost track.\\n\\nIn fact, I was so infatuated with the drink menu, I hadn't even looked at the food menu yet!  So, I finally decided to pucker up and order.  I got a corndog, and a burger with mac n cheese, bacon, fried egg, and probably something else on it.  Hell, I just remember, when the food came, there was no space left on the table!\\n\\nAfter eating pounds of food, I wanted some dessert.  And you won't believe what I saw!  A picture of an ice cream float served with SOUTHERN TIER CREME BRULEE STOUT.   So it WAS true- they did hoard the city's supply!  You better believe I ordered it!  But at the same time, I knew how rare the drink was, and I tried getting it in October, so I just wanted to see what they would say (yea, I am the asshole who asks questions I already know the answer to!)\\n\\nA few moments later, the server comes out and tells me \\"I am sorry, we just sold out yesterday!\\"  Bullshit!  False advertising!  You know and I know they have been out for a while, but just wanted to cocktease fools like me into thinking they still had it with that beautiful picture of an ice cream float.  To me, that was the defining moment of me giving this place 4 stars instead of 5.  \\n\\nAnother factor to me (which is great for them though), is that the tab will add up QUICKLY, especially if you want to try different things- so be careful, the drinks can add up!  I decided to finally end the meal with a Mexican Hot Chocolate shake, and I gobbled it.  I did not add alcohol to it though.\\n\\nThis would be a great place to have a UYE, and a cool place for a casual date.  The menu is big enough that I am sure no two experiences will be the same!

I got there around 1PM and was seated right away as I waited for him to come, which was nice. The place has a very old-school feel to it - nothing fancy, but comfortable booths and ideal for families.\\n\\nThe menu is pretty extensive, and while I was torn between a couple of options, I ended up going with the Florentine eggs benny, which came with a side of potatoes. My friend got the meat lovers omelette and a single pancake as a dessert. The eggs benny came with a \\"cheese sauce\\" instead of a typical hollandaise, which I was intrigued by, but ended up being tasteless and I would have much rather preferred a typical hollandaise. The potatoes were good, however I wish that there was more of them as they were quite sparse with their portion size. The best part of the food was the pancake - this was delicious! It tasted like a vanilla cake and was perfectly fluffy. \\n\\nThe food and ambiance at this spot were mediocre, but what really put me off from Paul's Omelettery was the service. While all the staff were rambunctious and loud, I found our particular waiter to be quite rude. When he asked for our drink order, I didn't want a drink and instead wanted to order our breakfast but as soon as I started listing my order he cut me off, saying that he had specifically asked for my drink order only in a sassy tone and walking away. When he came back for our food orders, I asked about the \\"cheese sauce\\" (since most eggs benny's come with hollandaise sauce so I was curious to see what this was) and he simply said that it's not hollandaise and left it at that. \\n\\nOverall, the food at this place was nothing to write home about and the service only made the experience worse.

They added an automatic tip of $3+ (it was like 15%) to my \\"to-go\\" order, in which, I am glad I caught it because my husband & I was about to tip cash, yes, even after the experience. It took me back because it was already added. These comments (including some of the 58 not recommended reviews) are not lieing, customer service is very poor, BUT, if you are seeking a joint to grab some late night sober food, this is your spot. It stays open pretty late too, especially on weekends. \\n\\nI felt bad because it was my idea to swing by and support this local neighborhood pizza joint, I just knew it was gonna be a good experience, but Cook Out probably would've been the better option....

In addition, my box had hot sauce all over it & pizza box was a little damp, but honestly, by then, I was really through with them plus it was some other ticked off customers as well so I just left because the wait on the food was already long enough. Just sloppy. Have the decency to wipe off the container before handing it to the customer. I've been here a few times & never experienced this level of customer service. FYI: Parking is tough but it isn't their fault because they've been there forever. It's a bustling area, the city definitely could improve this factor for sure. Since the last time we visited this area, I notice they have restricted certain areas to park & added parking meters. I'm almost positive if we would've came much earlier the dynamics of everything might've been different, just maybe? There is room to grow for this Edgewood staple and it starts with the declining CUSTOMER SERVICE (friendliness, attention to detail, providing a welcoming atmosphere, etc.). I'm sure others complaining about customer service doesn't want the staff to sprinkle gold leaves on our pizzas & hand out massages.

DD was also the first coffee that I drank from a franchise.  (I didn't start drinking coffee until after college.)  However, as my taste for \\"good\\" coffee increased, I started questioning the making of DD coffee.  Why does the coffee at this DD taste different than the one at this other DD?  Why does the coffee not taste as good when I use less cream?  Why do the store-bought DD coffee beans not produce good tasting coffee; other coffee bean brands produced good coffee?  And, why do New Englanders love this crap?\\n\\nDD is the reason I don't drink flavored coffee anymore; I would visit several locations, but I still could never get good French Vanilla coffee from them.  There is no consistency between DD locations.  You'd think that a franchise would produce consistent food/beverages between locations.  One location serves coffee that is more burnt than burnt coffee from the other location.  Their coffee would taste better if they made and kept it fresh enough throughout the day: dump it out after it has been sitting on the heater for 30 minutes or more.\\n\\nIt's all in the light cream.  I used to think they used half and half as the cream until I saw them make my order.  They dump a lot of cream into the coffee.  (No wonder the coffee texture has a full-bodied texture to it.)  But, if you start using half and half, milk, or less cream, you realize that you end up with what tastes like watered down coffee -- if you're lucky; it depends what is in the water used to make the coffee.  DD coffee is decent at best.  (Can we get some actual coffee flavor in here?)\\n\\nWith the exception of the donuts, breakfast food is bad too.

Surprisingly, there was only brisket, sliced or chopped, when we got to the counter. No pork or sausage or anything else. We got plenty of brisket and potato salad for the six of us, and the brisket was delicious and moist. I ended up sandwiching slices between wonder bread with raw sliced onion. However, the potato salad was the worst I've ever eaten. All we could taste was dill pickles. It needed sugar and salt and less vinegar. There was no balance of flavor at all. I couldn't even taste potato, just pickles. We collectively agreed it wasn't good and left a lot of it untouched. The sauces on the table were nothing special and I ended up not using them.\\n\\nConsidering the wait, the brisket was good but I expected so much more. I can name at least two equally good places in Houston for brisket, Killens and Truth, and their sides are far superior.

The establishment itself was one of the few open for Christmas.  Although reservations were booked we were instructed the bar area was open seating.  We took our chances and sat at the bar.\\n\\nThe bar was slammed!  Mike was the barkeep charged with filling bar, as well as restaurant patrons orders.  To say he was running around like a chicken without a head would be a serious understatement.  The man was running around filling orders for the two and half hours we were there without any breaks or breathers.  Yet, he took the time to tend to our needs, orders, requests, and made us feel very welcomed.  Thank you Mike.  You deserve the next couple of days off.  \\n\\nThe food was pretty good as well.  We ordered pan fried oysters, which were lightly battered and pan fried.  Served with a light tartar sauce.  The oysters were plump and juicy, and tasted of the ocean.  We also had the deep fried calamari, as well as their version of the classic fish and chips.  Both dishes were presented and tasted great.  All dishes were washed down with locally produced IPA's.

We ordered a couple beers to start and I was very confused because they had Celis White Ale on tap, but the brewery that makes Celis (Michigan Brewing), is out of business (last I heard, anyway). I asked the waiter if they had an old keg of Celis or if the brewery was back in biz. He offered to find out, but I never got confirmation either way. I'm not entirely certain what I drank, but it tasted fine at any rate.\\n\\nWe started with the edamame hummus. It doesn't come with bread, but the waiter did offer us some. The hummus is covered with carrots and I wished there were more hummus and less of the veggies (or at least the serve the veggies on the side). The hummus itself was really good.\\n\\nWe split the burger of the day (which was just a basic burger with cheese and fried onions on top) and the Nigella Flatbread.\\n\\nThe burger was cooked to medium rare perfection. There was no fault to be found in the burger, but it also wasn't anything to write home about. The taste profile was fairly standard and the fries were good. Not complaining!\\n\\nThe Nigella Flatbread was excellent in concept, but not in execution. You can't pick up a piece and eat it. The toppings just fall right off the soggy crust. The veggies and cheese would have been tasty over some sort of grain. We could have done without the flatbread itself.\\n\\nLastly, we ordered the green tea ice cream with brownie bites and almonds. This was a delicious, light and refreshing dessert.

Further, not only was the built-in walkway blocked off so our kids could not check in with us, our server and the hostess both asked us to not have our kids come up to the patio while playing.

The \\"house made noodles\\" were spaghetti! Yes, spaghetti, exactly like the kind you get dry in a box for 99 cents at Safeway. I could go on for a while about how I lived in China, have eaten Chinese food all over the country, etc., but it doesn't take any kind of expert in Chinese cuisine to recognize spaghetti.

The veggies are plain, no salt at minimum and I wasn't impressed with carrot shavings on my side dish as I'm aware at how low of a cost those are for a 45.00 plate. Service was slow if existent at all besides our food and drinks being dropped off by anyone but our server, I'm hesitant to assume it was our age range or mix of nationalities in our group as we are all in the restaurant industry and it hurts to assume that but that was our overall feel on why we were neglected. I don't want to press every experience here will be this way, but if you also have been blessed with the food culture this city provides I wouldn't consider this one of the best options."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Long wait but it is so worth it.

The fish's beurre blanc sauce came with capers, and when coupled with a balsamic vinegar syrup, was excellent.  The cod was fresh and seasoned well.  The polenta was fine.  The Pacific Red Snapper was equally good.  The basil tomato soup had an especially nice texture.  Tasty too.  Overall, I have to say I really liked S&R's spice combinations.\\n\\nService was good.

I liked they have many options to add additional such as fresh garlic.\\n\\nThis place seemed really popular with younger people in their 20's and 30's. They play music really loud.

Tonight, knowing it is never ready, I ordered it at 6:00 for a 6:30 pickup, to give them the extra time. I stroll in at 6:30 and look through the pickup rack to only not see my order. I ask the cashier and she yells something down the line and says it will be a minute. For 15 minutes I watch everyone in line get served. After 10 minutes the cashier did ask if I wanted a drink while I wait. It took 15 minutes for me to get my order that was supposed to be ready at 6:30. What is the point of promising a ready time in an app when it is never met? It can't be how busy they are because the one I go to for lunch is always busy, and they always have my order ready.

The offer included 1 appetizer of our choice and a house salad to share, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert to split. It was really hard to decide on what to get, since everything sounded AMAZING, but ultimately, we ended up going with the Korean barbecue tacos ($15) to start, the complementary local mixed green salad ($8 for the small) which was automatically included in our deal, the steak frites ($27) for Mark and the roasted duck noodle salad ($26) for me, and the butterscotch pudding ($10) as our dessert... It was a meal to remember! We also added in the buttermilk fried chicken wings ($14) as a second appetizer to sample, the fried egg ($2) to enhance the flavors in my noodle dish, and the pitcher of red sangria (I think it ran around $20) to sip while eating. Each and every bite was worth the calories. The short rib tacos came two to a plate, and were incredibly flavorful, as well as fall-off-the-bone tender... the Asian pear kimchi and the candy ginger aioli certainly complemented the beef. Frankly, we weren't that excited with the chicken wings which everybody brags about. They were actually pretty basic... Bland, even wthe poblano ranch dressing for dipping, and heavy too. Wouldn't get them again! However, despite not being salad lovers, we totally enjoyed the uniqueness of the roasted kale, along with the Japanese ginger sesame, and the carrot vinaigrette... Unbelievably fresh and tasty! As for our mains, we found both of them, the steak frites and the duck noodles, equally delicious, and the portions large. Mark said his steak was nice and flavorful, especially when dipping it into the sherry pesto aioli, but he wasn't that thrilled with the patata bravas which accompanied the meat... They were bland, and more like French fries. Besides the shredded roasted duck, my noodle dish had some charred broccolini, bean sprouts, and honey roasted peanuts... All adding crunch and texture. The hoisin glaze brought sweetness to everything, and the fried egg was better than expected. Mark pretty much cleaned his plate, but not me. I was so stuffed, that I ended up bringing almost half of it home for lunch the next day. We finished off the meal with their amazing butterscotch pudding that had toasted crumbles on top. Sadly, I could only take a bite, unless I wanted to be sick, but the dessert was still incredible! I would get it again, though not with two appetizers first... Lots of food!!! We managed to polish off the whole carafe of red sangria, probably thanks to the ginger they add to it, which gave our drinks a wonderful spicy kick... Different than other sangrias. We will definitely return, with or without the Groupon. They have a large menu with unique options, friendly staff, and the restaurant is upscale casual.

Easy to get to and parking right there. They do charge $6 to park and I was surprised that was extra after paying what we did for the tickets. Don't they own their own lot? Lot only about 1/3 full. However, even using the handicap spot it was a LONG walk from the parking lot down the side of the building to the entrance on the opposite street corner. We were running late and got there just as the pre-show ended at 7:30 pm. No line and tickets ready. There were 6 of us ages 86, 60, 32, 33, 5 and 1 1/2 so we represented a large age group. We posed for the usual group photo and then went into a large area that was set up to look like a 1700/1800 dock. The cash bar was closed by the time we arrived but many had purchased drinks. There were a few tables around but if it had been a busy night it would have been SRO. Gift shop with usual trinkets. Some of the cast had been out \\"charging up\\" the audience. They call you in by your assigned colored section. There are 6 sections so if you are one of the last two sections you have a bit of a wait. We were assigned table #2, one row back as my mother has some mobility issues. This was great for us as the chairs are free standing and the 2 of us who are tall could push back for leg room. The rest of the tables had fixed bench seating. The stage was well done. There was lots of audience participation. There were many times kids were called on to help and a couple times all kids could join the action. Dinner was served soon after we sat down around 8 pm. Having been to this kind of show before we had anticipated a late meal. We had the pork loin (not chop) and shrimp, corn and mashed potatoes. All good. Mom had the veggie and pasta and it was tasty. The kids each had the chicken fingers with mac and roni. They gave us pitchers of cola, sprite like soda, diet, water and mom got an ice tea so drinks were fine. Yes, a brownie for dessert but it was not stale. The show was constant action. A lot done by swinging ropes and such. Pirates, soldiers, mermaids and maidens. All that makes a good story. You find yourself rooting for the heroes. Yes, the audio is a little difficult to understand sometimes but it is no worst then other similar attractions I have attended. We all had a great time and will return. After the show the \\"dock\\" area is open with some dancin' music which the kids jammed to. Some of the cast was there and you could take pictures with them and chat with them. This made the kids night. Wheelchair friendly, clean restrooms. This is not a Broad\\nway show folks. This is a fun place for the family to come and enjoy. My biggest complaint is the tray the wait staff place on your table at the end of your meal. They \\"suggest\\" a $5/ adult tip and a $3/child tip. When you calculate the price of the meal this is WAY more than even a 20% tip. Plus we did not come with cash. We had our credit cards and had prepaid. We had to dig around through everyone's pockets to come up with the addition $25. This should be told to you when buying the tickets or at least noted on the web site so you can come prepared. And if this is expected why not just add it in as a \\"service fee\\". When it is \\"suggested\\" that way it is no longer a tip but a service fee anyway."},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"This was the first restaurant I visited.

Come to think of it, I'm adding a few of those fries to the vault too.  \\n\\nMy entree choice was the Smoked Chicken Enchiladas which is two enchiladas with apple, onion, hickory smoked chicken, and Monterey Jack cheese on corn tortillas with a choice of three sauces... Sour Cream, Guajillo, and one other that I cannot remember.  I doubled down and got both the Sour Cream and the Guajillo sauce.  The Guajillo sauce is like a magic light mole it is not spicy, but delivers such a complex layer of goodness on top of all the other goodness.  My flavorful sides included a lime cilantro rice and rustic black beans with epazote.  The epazote in the black beans helps with digestion.  Such a satisfying meal and experience on all so many levels.  I can't wait to try the other items on the menu, as well as the Portuguese egg custard tart pastry for dessert, and the coffee as well, the scent of which was downright intoxicating.  \\n\\nThere are just a few parking spots in the actual Bem Bom lot, and you can only enter the lot from one direction.  It is well worth the slight struggle.  You will most likely have to be a courteous parker on the side or main streets.  I hope you have the same wonderful experience at Bem Bom that I did.  I'll be back, and happy to trade some of my guacamole for a few of your Bomb Fries.  Bom apetite!!\\n\\n********\\nI came back the next morning for an expresso ... or three!!  Bem Bom is open on Sunday mornings at 11:00 am.  Soon they will have the breakfast menu officially in place.  Bem Bom is still in the soft opening phase ... but I already have a soft place in my heart for this warm, friendly, family team and their extraordinary cuisine!\\n\\nIt was quiet when I came in at 11 am, and Chef Chico graciously put together an inaugural plate of Portuguese eggs, and fresh beautiful bread to go along with my expresso.  It was my first time having Portuguese eggs... which are a heavenly treat!  \\n\\nThe plate consisted of 3 local organic eggs over easy, with a special cooking method that delicately crisps the edges up perfectly.  It's not like when you cook the edges up crisp at home, and cannot eat that part.  This egg has an almost like a caramelized candy edge.  The plate comes with three savory sauces:  a green tomatillo, a middle of the road slightly spice sauce, and a darker very spicy sauce.  Pick your favorite by testing on the beautiful warm bread first.  Then enjoy the sauces drizzled on the eggs, and on the beautiful bread.  I seriously enjoyed every single bite, as well as every single sip of my three expressos!

Despite the $15+ price for their bowl of ramen the way I like it, I'm still definitely a fan.

Unfortunately, this place did not meet any expectations. I knew it couldn't be comparable to some of the great places I've tried, but I thought it would be decent given the great reviews left on Yelp. \\n\\nI arrived on a weeknight where the restaurant can be found in a quiet plaza filled with other asian establishments. The restaurant was busy, but not overly crowded, which is still a good sign that they had some good business. The concept is a bit different. As you walk in, you will be shown where you will be seat and then given a place card with your number. You wait in line and look over the menu that is posted up on the way. As you're in line, someone will get your drink order. Finally, you get to the cashier to place your meal order. After doing so, you walk over to your assigned sitting area and rest your place card so the servers know where to drop off your ramen. \\n\\nAs for the food, I ordered the Tonkatsu with nori, pickled ginger, and corn. I also ordered a side of spicy edamame. The edamame had a really good spice to it, but reminded me of lucas (an old spicy, sugary powder you can find at ice cream trucks). After some time, the seasoning was just way too salty to my liking. When I ordered this appetizer, I was thinking of the spicy edamame from Katsuya in Los Angeles, but it was not up to par. The ramen was good at the beginning, but like the edamame, the soup was too salty. I was also sad that the nori, pickled ginger, and corn were at an additional cost. Most places include those and charge additionally only if you ask for extra. Also, the noodles itself wasn't the thick noodle type that I am use to. \\n\\nThe atmosphere and customer service was great! That's a big thumbs up! All the staff members were very helpful in helping me make a decision on my meal.

He wasn't helpful at all and didn't seem thrilled that we weren't buying more.\\n\\nWhile I could have overlooked all that, my main issue was that the margaritas were at best ok, and at worst made the stomachs of the girls (who love margaritas) upset. The mediocre margaritas for $15-$20 after such a long wait and crappy service were very un-Disney to me.

I'm not a huge chip person so I would have preferred some other side options, but that really is a minor gripe because y'all, the sandwich is delicious. I see that prior reviewers have noted that they had fatty, too-chewy sandwiches. Either KR has fixed this or I just got lucky, because my sandwich was practically perfect in every way. They make every sandwich to order, carving the meat in front of you, so be prepared to wait a couple of minutes for that. The meat is medium rare, with plenty of flavor.

This is reasonable, considering stadium hot dogs and pizza (meals of far inferior quality) cost about $6 to $8.

My father and I happened to come in around noon on Tuesday of this week and were more than surprised to see such a cutely decorated restaurant that had only one other patron in it. I became a bit skeptical and glanced over the menu displayed in the front and thought the prices seemed a bit high -- but an older gentleman had come out (perhaps the owner?) and stated everything is flavorful and made fresh. So I looked at my dad and we both agreed to give it a shot. \\n\\nThe older gentleman told us to sit where every we would like and he would come to us. He handed us menus and then went back to the other patron in the restaurant to finish chatting. I was a little surprised he didn't offer to grab us any drinks before leaving. He came back as the other patron was leaving and asked if we were familiar with this type of cuisine, to which we replied yes. We were in a little bit of a time crunch so we placed an order for 3 kefta (angus beef) kebabs (1 was to go for my husband). He suggested because it takes a little while to make -- insisting that it is fresh -- that we get some hummus. So we did. 10 minutes later he comes out with hummus and fresh pita bread -- this was fine, nothing stood out or anything. 25 minutes later and our food comes out. I looked at the plate and back at my dad's face -- it looked like we both had 90 second rice heated up in the microwave with 4 meat sticks and a blob of white sauce. Now mind you, this dish costs $17.99, so I expected what the older gentleman had said -- that it would be fresh and flavorful. It lacked any flavor at all, I was so disappointed, especially since my father was just visiting in the area. For the price we paid I felt like it was a scam. Now the reason I distinctly said 90 second rice is because there was no other employees in the restaurant and I had heard the microwave being used more than once. At least add some spices or herbs to the rice to give it some type of flavor. It was very evident this was 90 second rice. I don't know if the kebabs are made the day of or prior to, but regardless there was not any flavor.\\n\\nNow as for all the prior reviews..... I don't quite understand. I did read a couple reviews where some people had thought maybe some fake reviews had been submitted as the score was quite high. Don't get me wrong, there are outstanding restaurants that deserve such rating -- but not this one.

The interior of the restaurant is average, nothing spectacular however I'd assume that most people aren't going for the d√©cor they're going for the delicious 2 for 1 pastas.\\n\\nI'd like to start out by saying that I absolutely love the food at Jimoco's, I've been ordering take-out here for years. As long as they stay consistent with their quality & quantities I'll continue ordering here religiously.\\n\\nOn this particular visit I decided it was time for me to write a long overdue review of this fine little establishment, so I ordered 4 of their popular Pasta dishes. First up was the Penne Verde that came loaded with fresh seasonal vegetables in a light flavourful tomato sauce, if you want a meatless pasta that's extremely satisfying I'd highly recommend ordering this dish. Up next I ordered one of my personal favourites at Jimoco's the oven baked Penne Al Forno that comes full of chorizo sausage, bacon, mushrooms and chili peppers in a tomato sauce, the dish comes smothered in cheese and is baked so it's quite similar to a lasagna just with different noodles, if you want a HEAVY filling dish this is the one for you. For my third pasta I went with the Fusilli Alle Salsiccie, it had Italian sausage, onions, bell peppers, sour cream all in an spectacular rose sauce, HOLY COW this one delivered, I can't believe I've never tried this one before it may be my new favourite. Lastly I ordered the Penne Alla Bombay, this IS my favourite dish at Jimoco's, everything about it is PERFECT, the chicken, broccoli, chilli peppers and tomatoes go together so well in the creamy curry sauce, if you LOVE curry and penne as much as I do I HIGHLY recommend you try this one.\\n\\nThe key to Jimoco's is their 2 for 1 pasta dishes, how can you go wrong with that? You can't. It may not be the most fancy place, sometimes the waitresses are over worked so the service will be a bit slower than it should be but all that is forgotten when you pay the bill. Jimoco's is one of the rare places where you really get your moneys worth AND the food really is of top notch quality. If you love noodles with some sauce then I highly recommend you give this place a try.\\n\\nI will be back for sure!"},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"It was rainy today, so I guess the line was probably not as long as usual, but it still took a while (20 mins or so) to get to the window and order. The sausage was pretty good, but they get it from Texas Sausage Company on 12th st.  I am a moist/fatty brisket lover, so that's what we got. The moist brisket is not as fatty as I like; it's pretty meaty; but the burnt ends of the fatty brisket are what I should order - it melts in your mouth!  The pulled pork sandwich was ok.  The pork ribs did fall off the bone, but they were kind of bland.  They don't make the frito pie anymore.  Didn't care much for the beans (a little spicy), the cole slaw (was ok) or the potato salad (too plain).  Aaron did a great job checking in with the customers and keeping them occupied in line.  The sauces are good (the espresso and sweet sauce in particular).

I don't like the sides but the shakes are good. Service is decent but they seem to rotate a lot of people so it's not always the same. I go around lunch time and one day it may be dead and another it may be totally packed and I can't tell why. As I write this it seems things aren't totally reliable but I've had enough good experiences to give 4 stars. The best thing may be the rewards program and the coupons.

New Orleans-inspired tapas just seems like a head scratcher of a mashup.  When I think of Southern food I usually think of generous, hearty portions rather than delicately crafted small plates.  The idea is definitely novel, and they really commit to the execution in terms of decoration and ambiance, but I'm still not sure this is a twist that needed to happen.  Your mileage may vary, but after sampling a fair bit of the menu I wasn't really blown away, certainly not enough to justify the pricy-ness of the place.  It just didn't feel organic or natural, like our server somewhat awkwardly forcing himself to say \\"y'all\\" to the customers.  I think this is one case of simpler being better.\\n\\nWe tried the Cajun guacamole, which was basically regular guacamole with mildly spicy shrimp on top and served with spicy potato chips rather than the traditional tortilla chips.  Not bad at all.  We also had the aged gouda mac n' cheese topped, for some unfathomable reason, with flaming hot Cheetohs.  This is definitely something I could have done without, but I know a lot of people are fans of this trend.

You can meter park along the street and go right on in.

PRO TIP: The Coconut Ash (the black ice cream) is very popular, is not too overbearing coconut flavor, and makes for a dope picture. So I had a Split (Two scoops) on a black come which I believe was vanilla flavored cone. I had Coconut Ash and Rosemary Honeycomb (photo provided) with Hibiscus sprinkles. For $0.75 more you can pretty much get your ice cream covered with toppings of your choice. From the classics (caramel, chocolate, sprinkles, nuts etc...) to some more unusual toppings (Hibiscus, rose, etc..). 2 scoops and one topping on a cone cost me about $7.50 (Kind of expensive) but I guess it's downtown and rent is HIGH. FACT: Some if the flavors are VEGAN! Guess who's like a quarter vegan now, and respect the vegan skills of making ice cream...

The standout for me here is the chia waffle cones. I have always hated the taste of waffle cones and always had to use a bowl but these are super yummy! Also the Bourbon Caramel Drizzle is incredible and worth the add on.\\n\\n For me this place could be 5 stars except that I've never been particularly impressed by their customer service and a one scoop icecream cone is $6-7 which is a little steep for me but I do understand that it's high quality!

Our server was friendly, nice and gave his recommendations for drinks and food. We decided to do family style dinner to really experience the concept of Revival, which is family-style dining while sitting and enjoying your meal with friends/family. You get to choose your entree and dessert, and the rest such as hors d'oeuvres and trimmings are picked by the chef, along with their famous iron skillet corn bread.\\n\\nWe ordered their grass-fed beef and pork meatloaf wrapped in bacon, pork chop, savory sweet potato pancake and brunswick stew. Everyone seemed to really enjoy their dish. If I had to pick a favorite, the meatloaf was a winner. As for the sides, we all liked the mac n' cheese and the pork fried potatoes. The mac n' cheese had potato chips on top, which gave it that extra crunch. And as for their dessert, literally everything was good, but the lemon icebox pie was definitely a favorite. \\n\\nSo their corn bread is extra special here. My friend was raving about the corn bread, since he's the only one thats already tried this place before, so he really hyped it up. It was good, but I didn't think it was THAT good. However, I will say, its different from any corn bread I've ever had. It had a smoky ham taste to it, almost biscuit like, not too dense and light, which I liked. The outside had a nice toasty-ness to it, and with a spread of butter on it, it was good. We did order two more, which they charge you extra for, but if you really love it, like my friend, than its worth it. According to our server, only 3 people know the recipe - its that secretive!\\n\\nOverall, we had a great dining experience. The only reason I'm giving this place a 4 is because everything just came out slow. We were done with our kale salad, and we were just sitting and waiting for our next dishes.

Boston deserves a more authentic sort of Mexican food and the revolution may begin here at Harvard. \\n\\nI thought the inside was more like a glorified Rubio's Fish Taco restaurant (which is a chain of Baja California restaurants in California primarily) so it didn't stand out as totally original to me. I was surprised that there was even a 20 minute wait tonight. I did think that the service was pretty good, as the server kept checking with how we were doing. \\n\\nOverall, I've yet to find a decent Mexican restaurant in Boston, and I'm starting to lose hope. If you're from Boston and you find yourself in California, be sure to try any single establishment there for a dose of real Mexican food. It's usually so good, you'll be tempted to call \\"la migra\\" to double-check the place's legality."},{"name":"Blue Dahlia Bistro","address":"3663 Bee Caves Rd, Ste 4A","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Looking for a place to kill some time before our kid's bus arrived at Westlake HS, we found this spot nearly by chance.  Positive Yelp reviews sealed our decision to go in on a Friday night.  Nearly full, we were able to sit at end of long communal table, and proceeded to have amazing food, delightful service and fun company.  This place is fancy-casual.  Meaning you can wear sandals, shorts and a T-shirt, but the food is more like a fancy French bistro.  I had their breakfast of Sweet Vanilla Belgian Waffles.  Sweet but light and really hit the spot.  My wife and son split the open faced Roasted Turkey sandwich, and it was plenty of food for 2.  I would recommend that you try this great spot tucked away in back corner of strip center if you are near this part of Bee Caves.  We even went back for brunch on Sunday when picking our kid back up, and again had amazing food and perfect service.

We were roughly 20th in line arriving this early; me hoping the expectations and the accolades would survive the move and impress a BBQ lover that can't get anything decent in Colorado. \\n\\nWe visited with the folks surrounding us, some visiting 5 days a week while others heard about it and stopped by just to check it out. Some law enforcement officers from the metroplex, hipsters, and purists. We hit the counter around 11:20; brisket, ribs, Tipsy Texan, and sides. Oh, a pound of ribs and brisket to-go. \\n\\nThe meats proved epic as usual. Mouth watering brisket, a sandwich that could have doubled as the leaning tower of meat, and tender ribs. I have to admit Franklin serves the best brisket I've ever had, period. Ribs are up there as well. The sandwich nearly finished my entire food consumption for the next two days. \\n\\nFranklin is near perfect and sure I'd give them a nod for one the best in the business. My endorsement stands with the meat as I'm still not a fan of the sauces.

When we entered, we asked the hostess to be seated on the patio.  She looked visibly unhappy about this request despite the fact that there was another table seated out there and plenty of open seating.  Roughly ten minutes later a server appeared to take our drink orders.  I ordered iced tea and asked for sugar to be brought out because it wasn't on the table.  He asked if Splenda was okay; but due to an allergy, I requested regular sugar.  I was given a sauce cup full of loose sugar.  He took our order and informed us that chips would be right out.  Another 10-15 passed and I had to go ask for the chips and salsa.  As soon as they arrived, so did the entrees.  My order was wrong; but at this point, I began to eat.  We were never given a caddy with s&p and hot sauces, and we had to go in to request refills and silverware.  Since I didn't receive the rice I asked for with my order and was given beans instead, I asked for a side of rice.  I was brought a dish of cold rice and the check.  The check showed that I was charged for the side of rice that should have been included with my original order.  Realizing we weren't going to get anywhere, we paid the bill and left.

They're located in a strip mall way over on the northeast side of the 270, so not somewhere that I would normally go.  It was pretty quiet when we showed up for lunch, but they were happy to give us the Restaurant Week menu.\\n\\nI started off with the chop salad, which was great except for the very chewy, gummy candied pecans.  I'm not sure, but I don't think they were supposed to be that chewy.  For the main course, I had the smoked prime rib; the server said it would be medium rare, but it came out preeeeeeeeeeetty rare, which wasn't a problem for me, but might be for others.  It was a nice piece of prime rib, though I found the smoked flavor to be improved when I reheated it later and cooked it a little more.  The side of green beans was on the snappy side, and I wasn't too impressed by the cheesy potatoes.  The peach bread pudding dessert was ok, but I think I was expecting a little more peach and a little less bread.\\n\\nThe server was very helpful in describing various offerings on the menu, and checked up on us during each course.  And towards the end of our meal, another staff person (perhaps an owner or manager?) spoke to us about their commitment to using local products and thanked us for visiting during Restaurant Week.\\n\\nA nice place to try during Restaurant Week, but probably not somewhere I'd visit again.

We skipped a bike ride and walk to wait in line for them to open. Over two hours and worth the wait. We ordered a 1/4 puma of everything as well as potato salad and coleslaw. What a feast. The brisket can be cut with the plastic fork it is so tender, the chopped brisket in sauce is delicious on bread with color slaw. The turkey was even better the next day (we took some home) on a sandwich. The ribs meat was falling off as it melted in your mouth.

We must've waited 30 min just to get it. The line kept moving, so we stayed in line. All we wanted was the avocado margarita. It sounds gross but it doesn't actually have avocado in it. I saw the bartender pour in a green juice. It tasted more like prickly pear to me. At first we were scared they didn't have it because it's no longer on the menu. But they make it if you ask! It came with a delicious salt and spice rim, in a talk plastic glass. Paper straw is optional. \\nNot the kind of car you can get your drink and chill out in. They had people behind us waiting to order. So you get your cocktail and you move on. You gotta have a reservation to hang out. \\nThe menu has a lot of tequila and a few mezcal.

While waiting I recommend you check out Heart cafe.\\n\\nThe first time around I had their traditional Eggs Benedict. I would not change anything with the dish - it was absolutely fantastic. The second time we came I had their famous fried chicken & waffles. The portion is humongous - I loved it!

The first time we ate here back in 2015 they were generous with the noodles. But more recently, we visited a few months ago 2019, we noticed the change.

That being said, the atmosphere is pretty cool and the servers constantly dancing at tables for celebrations is why the service is slow. We've had their staple burger, chicken fingers, chicken Alfredo to name a few. All the entrees we have tried were flavorful and prepared well. The burger was a little undercooked for me, but still had great flavor. The dessert (we got the cookie sundae) was delicious! In my opinion, the things this place does right is entertainment and desserts. \\nNote that it is extremely loud at times and NOT good for people with noise sensitivity or a place to converse lol.

I must say I preferred the Paris Brest, it looked like a french cruller and was doughier than the other puffs. My toddler LOVED the Mochi ice cream. It is ice cream covered with a flavored Japanese rice paper. The results looks like a cookie but is ice cream you can hold. My son put down his cream puff for the Mochi but I preferred the puffs. The Mochis come in many flavors including guava, blueberry and chocolate strawberry. \\n\\nOh, and they sell cake pops too. We ordered a chocolate one and it was delicious as well.

Getting a burrito or even a burrito bowl here is kinda like Mixing all your food together and having slop, the flavors don't always blend well and honestly I'm not sure what these slop in a tortilla chains are thinking. When they make your burrito they seem to just plop everything on the tortilla you ask for and seem to have no logic or reason to the assembly of the burrito. I think they may have a better product if they would take the time to put things on the burrito in the correct order. Also the foil wrapper makes the tortilla sticky and and gross, think moist white bread thats smashed out till its paper thin and sticky on the outside. Don't eat here! Don't believe the hype!

I would say the drinks this time around were indeed mindblowing, whereas last time I felt they were just okay.

The couple next to us asked the bartender to surprise him each time and he got some really impressive and beautiful drinks.

The only two cons personally found about this place was how loud it was. There are soo many options to help with acoustics in a restaurants. It would be a worthwhile investment. The tables are picnic table style and pretty wide so you have to lean in and raise your voice if you want to speak with anyone in your group. Second thing we're some of the waiters.

So, how's the pizza? Good. It's definitely got a much more authentic taste to it, from how it's made to the ingredients. Don't expect dominoes style pizza. Got a fresh taste to it, and the style of it is much more akin to what I guess you might find in Italy. No pineapple here (unfortunately). They have a couple different sauces you can throw on your stuff, such as a \\"spicy\\" sauce that isn't very spicy but has a nice chipotle style taste. They also have calzone sandwich's that are really good. Overall the food is great and though it's pricey, you're paying for quality food. Good taste, good ingredients, Papa Johns. Wait, wrong place jajajaja. It's absolutely worth trying if you're in the mood for some expensive pizza. Also tried the Nutella pizza with strawberries and banana, that was good. Basically pizza crust with those out on top, makes for a good dessert. Like I said, good recommendation if you're looking for good pizzzzza.

The first time, our waitress was great. My husband and I each ordered a bento box (eel for me and chicken for him) and we added a specialty maki roll to share. The waitress gave us special sauce for the dumplings in the bento box. The maki roll is on the smaller side compared to other restaurants, maybe 2-3 pieces shorter, but it was tasty. The eel in the bento box is small, slightly burnt on one side but still tasty. \\nI went back about 1 week later with my mother and it was a different story. The glass containing our water was stained and dirty. The sushi in the bento box were poorly made, falling apart, and the avocado in the sushi looked really old. It was mushy and turning brown in several areas. The salad was so cold and there were some ice in the vegetables, so obviously just came out of freezer and not sure if it was washed because that should have melted the ice. I again ordered the eel bento box and the eel  this time was a poor quality - it was full of elasticky skin rather than that soft meat that is expected, and again burnt on one side. My mother ordered the rib eye teriyaki for $2 more and that thing came looking rare inside even though she ordered medium rare. I was afraid for her to eat it. The waitress did not bring a separate dipping sauce for the dumplings. \\n\\nUnfortunately, based on this second experience, I cannot recommend this restaurant.
