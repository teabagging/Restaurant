Perhaps I've been to one too many Japanese restaurants that serve this type of fare in Japan and also in North America.

Would they like to work on my home also?? Unfortunately, this doesn't help my review of this place since I don't come to restaurants just to glean interior design inspiration \\n\\n3/5 service - we clearly were new and didn't understand the process/didn't know what to order and didn't get much guidance. \\n\\n2/5 for value/taste of food \\n\\nI guess Little Eater is meant to be vegetarian/vegan friendly, but I did not necessarily find it friendly for other dietary restrictions. I'm not usually this girl, but I am trying something new so I am temporarily eliminating some food groups from my diet. So I knew eating out was going to be a little rough, but thought if anywhere this might be a good place to try! Almost every vegetable side here was not an option for me as they had some sort of grain, quinoa, chickpea, couscous. I was expecting my options to be limited, but did go out of my way to come here expecting it would be similar to Northstar - i.e. easy to navigate the menu even with my currently limited diet, and easy to substitute items. \\n\\nThey were out of the frittata. I ended up ordering the curry pumpkin squash soup, which was fine but not earth shattering. I also wanted a small side salad to go with it. But there were a few items I wanted left off and they said that they could only customize a full size entree salad, which was kind of disappointing. I forked over the extra $$$ and my meal - a soup and a salad was $20. The most disappointing part was that the salad was extremely plain - spring mix with a carrots, cranberries, radishes, and a very generic oily vinaigrette. I kind of expect a $12 salad to have a little more depth and be a little more tasty than rabbit food!! The second most disappointing part was when my salad came out... without the special request I made. They did fix it for me, and ended up giving me a free cookie (which I couldn't have anyway - I gave it to my friend). Which was kind of nice.. but my friend later texted me telling me it was not tasty lol and she couldn't even finish it!! \\n\\nMaybe we didn't order the right items.

The salad was okay, mine didn't come with many onions, which I am very thankful for! I upgraded my side to the sweet potato casserole for an extra $4 to accompany my filet. The filet was cooked perfectly to a medium rare and it's definitely one of the best steaks I've had, which is great since Ruth's is known for their steaks. The sweet potato casserole was also tasty, and as my friend described it tasting like Thanksgiving! After we finished our entrees, we waited for quite a while, probably around 15 minutes for the dessert to come, but were presented with the check. We were confused and we're going to ask about the bread pudding, but wasn't sure who our waiter was since there were multiple people coming to our table. A few minutes later right as we were about to ask, the bread pudding came out. Honestly, not a fan of the bread pudding, but it didn't matter too much because I was pretty full from eating the filet and casserole that I didn't have much room left in my stomach for more.

There was someone in the booth and a family seating in the middle of the dining area. So the waiter takes us strait to seat to the table right by that family. We objected as we have little kids and don't like to disturb others. So he starts thinking where else they can find us place (the whole area is empty... like hello?!)... and he offers us the table at the very back by the bathroom that doesn't even have any glasses or silverware on it. We both protest and ask for a better table by the window at the beginning of restaurant. The waiter grudgingly give us this table saying something like it's high business area. But there is NO ONE at the restaurant. \\nAnyways, we seat and the lady comes in to take our order. Not even hello, nothing. Like \\"what do you want?\\". Ok. So we have 2 little kids so we asked if the have a kid menu. NO. Ok, so my husband asked if the can make a smaller portion of fried rice. Absolutely not. That's where I go, seriously???? How come you just cannot take half of ingredients and make it smaller? Unless, they have already everything pre made and pre measured. I really don't get it.\\nNow, to the meal.

I hate leaving negative reviews so I have given this place so many tries the last several months in hopes that it's just a phase and they get better again but today was the deal breaker.\\n\\nI ordered 4 tacos for delivery, 3 grilled chicken and one shrimp. They did let me know on the phone that the shrimp is Cajun and so it's spicy... I have had Cajun shrimp many many times, I confirmed spicy and not salty right because their food has been over salted the last couple of orders and they said yes. Not only was the price insane, $22 for 4 tacos and the order took over an hour to get to me, but that had to be the most disgusting shrimp i have ever had in my life. The shrimp tasted like old expired overly seasoned seafood and the taco literally consisted of 3 pieces of shrimp and a soft shell soaked in grease. I couldn't eat it after the first bite and had to throw it away... what a waste of money. There are so many better Mexican places in the area and at a better price..

I've been here twice and can't wait for my 3rd visit.  For $75, you get yourself an amazing prix fixe menu with approximately 12 dishes.  Typically, most of them change throughout the season.  One is always a mainstay which I am so glad that they keep on the menu.  Kanom krok.  Their version is scallop and coconut cream served in a rice cup.  DELISH.  Probably the best little morsel I have ever had.  I wish I could just order 20 of these and call it a night.  \\n\\nYou'll get a bunch of other dishes to take you throughout their theme.  They start off with apps, maybe a soup, some entrees, and desserts.  By the time you get to the entrees, you're usually stuffed but just can't wait to stuff your face some more.  The curries I've had were spicy with a beautiful kick.  \\n\\nThey do offer a wine pairing but I usually stick with beer.  Reservations are extremely tough to come by.  Think ahead and make a reservation early!  They have 2 seating each night that they're open.  Btw, also semi-difficult to find.

We waited about 15 min after checking in with the host(did wait list to cut down on waiting time..highly suggested). Once seated our waiter came and introduced himself as William and went over the menu. Food arrives.  Less than 10 minutes later the waiter is back asking if we need a to go box and brings us the checks.  After reaching over our food to place the tickets in the basket on the opposite side of the table he leaves. He comes back 2 minutes later with to go boxes (that we didn't ask for) and asks if we are ready to pay? At this point im irritated because we aren't even halfway thru our meal and we are being rushed because there is a party of 20 waiting to be seated. Well if you have ever been here you know it is almost impossible to seat that many people together.  Then the male host comes to pick up my check i had put my card on and said \\"i will take this to your waiter\\". Here comes a bus boy and ask if he can take our plates,which we are still eating from.My waiter comes back all flustered saying \\"they keep giving me the eye\\" insinuating that they want us to leave.I was like \\"its cool yall have a business to run we will just leave\\". He apologized again. I was so embarrassed because up to this point every experience has been nice. This time we were rushed thru our service by staff. Granted it was only a party of 2 and not 20 but our money and experience should matter just as much as the next person waiting.

If you just want to try to food, order a plate. If you want the full experience and to try to prove how much BBQ you can eat (it's probably way less than you think), go for the unlimited. The friendly servers will watch you like hawks for any sign of running low on something and immediately bring you more. The sauce was especially good (probably sacrilegious in Texas), but it helped to break up the meat and help eat more. The brisket was incredible, without a doubt the best I've had. The sausage was also very good and tangy.\\n\\nService was good as mentioned. We were seated and had our order taken quickly.

I pan fried everything myself after eating three or four bites of mushy noodles, and in general it was not very flavorful.

(These are the kind that try to make you feel like they are doing a huge favor when providing wait service.) \\n\\nI chose Brewers Table as it had availability for a large party (6+). We were sat outside (which we were fine with) given our dinner menus and drink menus as usual. As a group we promptly ordered drinks upon the waitresses second arrival to our table. Time went by and by and by and by and by. So much time that (20 minutes later) the waitresses returned and didn't have our drinks. She told us that the bar was backed up and that we would have them soon. There were only friends of the bartenders at the bar and they were chatting, not making drinks or pouring beer. (Isn't that the job of a bartender?) Bare in mind with the exception of two drinks out of 8 people, only beers were ordered from draft. More time went by from there (15 minutes) and a gentleman came out and delivered three drinks (that being it). \\n\\nWe asked the gentlemen about the others and he said that they were coming. (15 minutes more went by - maybe more as it was enough time for the three people who got there drinks to finish them). \\nMyself and two others in our party went inside to ask the bartender about our drinks. The bartender told us \\"how about you relax and I will do ALL the hard work\\" - blonde bartender with a beard. (No one raised there voice or anything) Last time I checked the answer should be I will look into that for you or I will get your waitress. Personally, felt like the bartender was pulling a Sean Spicer speaking to the press. We all saw how that worked out........\\n\\nAt this point our group was just about ready to pay for what we got and leave, having not gotten our drinks or food from an order that occurred ~45 minutes or so prior. Right about this time small plates that had been ordered began to come in. Still no drinks......  Finally, an hour or so later the first beers we ordered appeared. \\n\\nTo comment on the food as well, the food is absolutely nothing spectacular given the plenty of options available to you in East Austin. For example, Suerte, Tillery, Justines etc. \\n\\nTLDR - \\nYou don't need to be accosted by Bartenders, blown off by waitresses, and generally treated like a second class citizen or belittled like a member of the press by Sean Spicer.

We never make reservations and usually sit in the bar area, including the times we take our son with us.  We had another family visiting and I called and made a reservation for 7:30 on a Saturday night, for 8 people, including 4 kids.  When we arrived, the hostess looked the kids over, sneered at us, and announced that they didn't have a table ready for all of us and that we'd have to wait for 10-15 minutes.  Isn't that the whole point of making and taking reservations????  They told us to move out of the way and perhaps get a drink in the bar, which is not a large area.  We moved everyone out of the way, and stood against the wall while the hostesses whispered and looked over at us.  I approached and asked if perhaps we could just sit at two of the bar 4-tops but before I could complete my sentence, the hostess snapped \\"Absolutely not.  I told you it would be 10 minutes and you'll need to just wait.\\"  Our child and the other three are not young children and they were being well behaved while waiting, but obviously the hostess did not want to seat our families at all.

Excellent pizza - as if the reviews don't share this opinion already! \\n\\nIt's a small space with two rooms packed with tables and chairs, communal style. You get in line, place your order at the register and find a place to sit. A waiter will walk around with your pizza, calling out your order number. It's a no-frills type of place but the pizza is incredible and it's very, very worth it. The menu is small and simple with no substitutions or halves allowed. They also have wine and beer, bottled sodas and juices. They don't serve you on any plates - the pizza comes on one big tray with some knives and forks and you just dive in. Giggity.\\n\\nWe stopped in on a Saturday afternoon, around 12:30, only an hour after opening, and it was busy! The line was to the door. The cashier was probably the only not-so-good part of the experience. We told her it was our first time, hoping for some recommendations, and it turned into some weird type of staring game as we waited for her to school us on what to do, or, you know, even mention what the favorites are, but we got back a hefty dose of ambivalence instead. Mmmkay. We decided on the lasagna pizza since ricotta on pizza is my jaaaam lately, and it didn't disappoint. Meatballs, ricotta and romano and 100% satisfying. The crust, the ingredients, the flavor, the texture, the way it went down so, so easily... I saw a LOT of couples finishing one pie between themselves. It's very easy to do! It took us a minute to find an open seat and not even five minutes later our pizza was sitting in front of us. If you are claustrophobic or hate sitting next to strangers in a small space, this might not be an enjoyable experience for you.

They're premade by hand, kept in the freezer, then get resteamed. People are so mesmerized because they're fascinated at how cool, strange and authentic it sounds.

First, getting rid of one of the two shuffleboard tables was tragic (replaced by arcade games, which I've rarely seen used). I kept going for the incredible cocktails and the fabulous dinner menu. Unfortunately they replaced the dinner menu with a tiny menu that is mostly comprised of bar snacks, and there are almost no options for gluten-free customers. If you're looking for a great cocktail, it's a perfect spot, but I'd recommend eating before you go if you're looking for more than an empanada (or, anything substantial that is gluten-free)."},{"name":"Antico Forno","address":"93 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The food here is delicious.

Next, the tom yum soup was way too salty to the point where I couldn't even finish it (I'm the type of person who has an urge to finish everything/stuff myself). My hot pepper beef lunch special was also salty and wasn't anything that I would rave over. However, the massaman curry was delicious and flavorful. It had peppers, carrots, onions, potatoes, and peanuts with chicken and a fried egg added (fried eggs on top of anything will really change up the food game). It was a mild level of spice and I would recommend getting the curry if you decide to go!

The espresso is generally pretty good, but ordering any other kind of coffee drink is a crapshoot. I'd rather not pay $5+, after tip and non-dairy upcharge, for a cappuccino that seems lazily steamed by undertrained or overextended staff. When you order food, the staff no longer brings silverware with them to your table, unlike at the other locations. Instead, they leave them out at the service station. I don't totally mind getting up, and I understand that policies change according to the needs of a particular location, but it's both inconsistent and starts to chip away at the reasons to justify charging $9 for a breakfast sandwich when the service isn't there. The food itself, while still the same pricey Tatte food, is also more sloppily put together. My eggs have been overcooked more than once. Maybe it's because this location caters mostly to Northeastern students, so management think they can cut corners for the student clientele, or the staff is overworked. Could this location have inherited some of the awfulness that was the old Au Bon Pain that used to be here? Or maybe the staff is mostly college students with other things on their minds¬†(I've been there!)?

We were told the soup of the day is mostly chicken with potato soup.  The atmosphere is sophisticated and suitable for a date or business gathering.  There is a separate dining area also suitable for private functions."},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Overall, we enjoyed our dinner at Raglan Road.

Unfortunately, we could not see the stage where we were seated, but what was great is that the dancers came around to tables with kids and taught them some of their dances. It was fun to watch and the kids loved it. \\nOur service was good and food was tasty. At our table, we had the Bangers and Booze and the seafood stew. Kids had the Shepherd's Pie. All food was enjoyed by all, but highlight was the Bangers and Booze. Also, the Bread Pudding came highly recommended by our server.

It was served not too hot so perfect for eating right away and I finished it fast \\n\\nThe pork and veggie egg roll was delicious, perfectly crisp on the outside with soft crunchy vegetables and bits of pork inside. I could eat ten more of these.\\n\\nThe kung pao chicken come in a biggggg portion. I didn't end up eating the rice and it was still a hefty meal. The bamboo was nice and crisp like the texture of a savory apple. The chicken was cooked well, nice and juicy. Combined with the peanuts and cashews for a crunch all the textures were nice. I liked the combination of the bell peppers too but those were sparse. It was supposed to be spicy but it wasn't really spicy. As a person who doesn't handle spice well, this wasn't spicy to me at all. The sauce was really good though despite not being spicy. Not overly heavy or greasy.\\n\\nMy friend ordered bun bo bowl and the meat was delectable and tender. It came in a generous proportion of crisp noodles, lettuce, carrots, and cucumbers drizzles in a light savory sauce. It was a very refreshing dish as judged from the one bite I took.\\n\\nFor service the waiter was really nice and the ambience of the place is chill and clean.

We go to talk to the only lady at the front desk who was swamped with people having their own issues but she is able to contact the management for us only to have them come up to us after waiting for twenty minutes and find out that this has happened before to somebody else but they say they're not responsible but have security patrolling? No one is patrolling at night or there wouldn't have been an issue. I'm absolutely dumb founded that they would not have installed cameras or have someone patrol outside knowing that this is not the first time this has taken place. This is a nice hotel and we paid $300 to stay here plus the $100 hold.

So when I saw one opened up in Mueller down the street by me, I was so excited to try this place out.\\n\\nThe good: The place was very clean and decorated well. They have indoor and outdoor seating as well as a bar area and it's very open and airy. In fact, it king of looks like they are trying to make it seem more like Snooze. There is a lot of parking options, and I like that you can put yourself on the waitlist through Yelp and use that to keep track of your wait.\\n\\nThe bad: Pretty much everything else. We were a party of 5, quoted 20-30 minutes. 55 minutes later we were sat, and the host, an older gentlemen, was rude, dismissive and short with us. When we walked in after getting a text he had no idea who we were and why we were there and we had to tell him three times that HE texted US. He passed off us to a young guy who literally wandered our way through the restaurant and clearly was not sure what he should be doing or where to take us until he spotted a booth with a chair stuck at the end. This is my next issue. Most of the restaurant is booths that fit four. They do have tables scattered around that fit four and could be moved together, but we noticed they kept those open to push together for larger parties, leaving us with this awkward chair at the end of our booth. I guess maybe 5 is just an unlucky number there. The menu was the same as the other location, but there was no seasonal menu. The 38th street Kerbey lane locale ALWAYS had a seasonal type menu which usually why I liked to go there. Our server finally comes over and she could. not. have. cared. less. to. wait. on. us. She was short with us, completely checked out, it's fairly loud in there and she wouldn't even open her mouth enough to speak so we could hear her. I had to dictate to the table (I was sitting on the end in the weird chair). Bare minimum answers to our menu questions as 4 out of the 5 of us had never eaten at any location. There is nothing I dislike more, as a former server, than a server who does everything they can to passive aggressively to let us know they would rather be anywhere than waiting on you. I get it, brunch is crazy and stressful but let that out in the back of house. Not on your tables. In fact, when we were leaving I noticed that most of the young wait staff looked like they were being forced into indentured servitude. Not a lot of smiles or pep. Just sullenness.\\n\\nOur food took over 35 minutes to arrive (2 omelettes, 2 breakfast tacos and a salad), but over all was fine except anything extra we asked for (i.e. i had asked for two dressings) clearly wasn't written down because it didn't come. The girl who ran our food was super nice and accommodating though. We also couldn't find over server for any drink refills. And that was that. We paid and left. an overall 2.5 hours or so for some waters and eggs.\\n\\nHonestly, I'll probably be back to a Kerbey lane at some point in my life, sure, but it'll take a lot to go to that locale. My advice - put your whole staff through another round of training. As Mueller continues to get built up, it'll be harder and harder to get people to come back to mediocre food and bad service when there are a lot of other options."},{"name":"Kal√©","address":"50 SW Pine St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Cute mom and pop restaurant with tasty Japanese curry!\\n\\nWe were just leaving the Portland Saturday Market and looking for nearby lunch options and found this on Yelp.

He was not on shift during the evening I was there for the Harvest dinner miscommunication. He personally called to apologize, to which I said was not his fault as he was not there. He asked for my mailing address so the restaurant could send a gift card as an apology. I said the gift card was not necessary, because that was not I was aiming for, and plus I don't like to give out my address. But he was very generous and said he wanted to give it to a long time loyal WS customer to rectify the situation. So I gave out 1 of my tenants' addresses (I rent several apartments out) and told them to watch for a mail from White Spot for me. (I was careful not to tell my tenants it was a gift card, otherwise they might use it and lie to me that they never got it, haha.) When they passed it on to me, inside the envelope was a personal typed letter from the manager and a $40 gift certificate enclosed. WS has won me back as a customer again with their quality customer service experience. My family (parents and grandparents) have been going to WS for the last 20 years as a family go-to place. We were going to stop going to WS and look for a new family restaurant venue after the previous negative Harvest experience, but now I would like to return to WS again and again with my family. We usually frequent the WS Park Royal in West Vancouver and WS Kitsilano, where they give amazing service, so I'll chalk up this one negative experience in Richmond as a one-off. The manager (who was not there that evening, so it was 100% not his fault) resolved it professionally, going above and beyond what I would expect. I may also post this up to my 9000+ connections on LinkedIn, to show an example to other brand managers on White Spot's example of winning a dissastified loyal customer back.

I researched a few different Italian restaurants in the North End and all roads led to Giacomo's. The food is outstanding and tastes like food your Italian Nonna would serve at a Sunday family gathering. I ordered the homemade fusilli with lobster and shrimp and the Giacomo sauce (a blush sauce). There were only about 2 shrimp in my pasta, however, it was full with delicious lobster and I was not angry about it. I would easily drive 5 hours to Boston to repeat this meal. The price is not bad either. Moderate prices for delicious food. A bottled wine list is available and most bottles are $20. There seems to consistently be a line out the door so be prepared to wait.

You also have to wait a good bit for your pizza when you order ahead~ the last time I called, it took over 30 minutes from call time to actually getting the pizza in your hands (in the middle of the day, not even lunch or dinner times). I arrived about 10 minutes after calling and I still ended up waiting over 20 minutes.

The restaurant cannot hold large parties, and the venue itself is very tiny. Parking is very hard to find because the restaurant only offers very limited amount of spots. I really believe that they can do better if the owners moved the restaurant to some place bigger. The seating is very tight, and it feels crowded and small in there. \\n\\nFood is pretty good. The reason I gave this place a 4 star is because the restaurant does not serve overly greased Asian food. Thai and Chinese cuisines are light, and do not over feed you with ridiculously huge amount of food. The portions are just about right. Additionally, you don't leave the restaurant feeling very heavy or bloated. \\n\\nI had the chance to taste the drunken noodles, an appetizer, and garlic shrimp with hot sauce. All the dishes were light. Drunken noodle is very popular here, and it's pretty much sauteed noodles with other meat and vegetables. The dish was not overly sauced, and it was not heavy. The balance between the sauce and rest of the ingredients were well put together. The portions of meat and vegetables were well thought of. The appetizer, I forgot the name of it. But it's pretty much an appetizer where you dip a sauce into. I wish I could remember the name right now, but I totally have spaced out at this hour. Moving on! The garlic shrimp with hot sauce is very very very light. I didn't expect it to be this light. I expected some heavy dish, but it came out to be something really healthy. The portions weren't big like the Cheesecake Factory, but it's enough for you to enjoy yourself with. The ingredients were very fresh. The chicken, beef, and shrimp I had at this restaurant all tasted great. The chicken didn't taste like old chicken nor did it have that smell. Additionally, it was not the cheap kind either. The beef can be said the same. The shrimps were larger than what I expected, and I enjoyed them. \\n\\nOverall, it was a crowded experience, but food wise, it was great. I wouldn't go here all the time because I prefer Thai of Norcross, but it's good enough to visit when I am around the area. Don't bring you big match dot com dates...

We were the second round sitting from when it opens. My friend ordered the Lobster ravioli and i opted for the homemade Fusilli pasta with lobster meat.

For some reason he was trying to keep people away from the bar - no explanation.  It was basically empty yet fully staffed.  There were 2 open seats so we walked over to order.  My friend and I were enjoying a pre-dinner drink when 2 more from our party arrived.  We waived at our friends but the host insisted they could not join us at the bar instead directing them to the basement where our group would be seated.  We closed out our bar tab and approached the host for him to take us to our friends since they couldn't join us at the bar.  He proceeded to tell me if I didn't like the way he managed things we could leave - when I started to follow the employee who was seating us he actually continued to argue with me about his way of managing coming after me down the stairs saying again I didn't have to be there!  The whole thing was completely insane and his demeanor was frightening.

Served in a chilled shot glass the tequila we chose was absolutely delicious. We did order a salsa trio. It was served with crispy house made chips. Each salsa was distinct in it's profile, spicy and yum! He also ordered some street taco's. What's not to love about a taco.....hello....or should I say holaaa. The blood orange margarita is just perfect. A little sweet, a little sour, and the mixologist put a generous amount of alcohol in the drinks. \\n\\nThe restrooms are FUN. Yes I said FUN.....there are TV's in the women's stalls.

I've mostly had the Korean dishes here because it is the only Korean place in Coolidge Corner - mostly recently I got the bibimbap which was actually quite good despite the over cooked egg and abundance of lettuce in the dish.

Sadly, I so rarely actually get the food that I order...\\n\\nI have ordered takeout from Sweet Chili several times, and the delivery service had been hit or miss.  Lately, it's been more like a giant swing and miss.  The last several orders I've made, they've either forgotten part of my order (sometimes the main entree), or messed up the order in some way.  \\n\\nLast Saturday, they forgot one of the entrees we ordered, but last night I decided to give them one more chance.  I placed a relatively simple order - drunken noodles, all veggies (no meat, no fish), and a couple of apps.  I'm told 30-45 minutes for delivery.  \\n\\nAfter about 75 minutes of waiting, I call the restaurant to find out how much longer the driver will be.  Amidst laughter, I'm told \\"we don't know\\" and \\"the driver wont answer his phone, but we're sure he'll be there soon.\\"  Another 15 minutes later, I call back - I'm told the driver will be there in 20 minutes.  So now I'm looking at close to 2 hours for delivery from a restaurant that is 1.3 miles from my house.  On a wednesday night, not Superbowl Sunday!  I'm obviously irate at this point, and I'm expecting AT LEAST some sympathy, some sincere apology, maybe even a discount or rebate on a future order.  I even ask for something like that -- the woman on the phone (who refused to tell me her name) said she'd ask her boss.  Then she came back to the phone, laughing, and basically said too bad.  And started throwing out random # of minutes for how far away the driver was (even though she hadn't been on the phone with him).\\n\\nFinally I asked to speak to her boss.  She tells me the boss is not there.  Yet she literally JUST spoke to the boss 5 minutes ago to ask about a rebate/discount.  I ask where the boss went, and I'm answered with silence.  I ask a few more times, and she mumbles some nonsense that I really can't understand.  I ask her point blank if she lied about talking to her boss, and again, silence.  \\n\\nAs I'm talking to her, the delivery guy FINALLY shows up - approximately 2 hours after I placed my order.  I am ravenous at this point, I open up my order and find shrimp all over the drunken noodles.  The same shrimp that I expressly asked them NOT to put on my food.  So I have to call back and ask for another order, and I'm told the wait will be able 30 minutes.  STILL no offer to comp anything or make it up to me in any way.\\n\\nTo their credit, I think a random person hopped in a car and delivered me the replacement order within 30 minutes.  But when the food arrived...there was tofu all over the drunken noodles (also something I asked them NOT to include).  I found the tofu less offensive than the shrimp so I was able to pick around it.  But the sheer incompetence of the ordering/delivery was mind-boggling.\\n\\nI love their Thai food -- WHEN I actually get what I order.  But 2 1/2 hours wait for my whole meal on a Wednesday night (with that much bungling) is totally unacceptable.  Unless I'm driving to the restaurant and inspecting the food before I leave, I'm never eating here again."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The reviews are true.

Started off with the fried alligator small plate, which was served over coleslaw. This was amazing! I also had a cup of black bean and sausage soup which was really good and I could have ended after that. It was topped with 'margarita sour cream' which sounded interesting, I was a little disappointed that it was topped with only a tiny amount!\\nFor dinner, I had the lamb tacos small plate, which were also very good. I have never seen lamb tacos on a menu so that was new and definitely worth it. My fiance had the Hawaiian pizza, which was not so great. For a $17 personal pizza, it seems weird to get large chunks of canned pineapple thrown on. The crust was also burned on a few slices which you would think the cook would have noticed.

From quick service, to even bringing out a few samples of sides for us to try, the service was great.\\n\\nSo why the 3 stars?\\n\\nOkay, that's simple: Food is just okay and already overpriced for the amount you get on the plate. I had the beef brisket and while the quality of the meat (Carlton Farms) was pretty good. Believe it or not, the sides (we tried many) really SUKED! The homemade baked beans were horrible and tasted nothing like baked beans. The store bought canned stuff is amazing compared to Paulo's. Coleslaw was like a simple milk broth over the slaw, tasted FLAVORLESS!! On top of that, the portion sizes were very small and I don't eat much, but I left here feeling hungry for $13.50.\\nHad we not bought a couple BEEF ribs on the side for $6.00, we'd have left pretty hungry. Lastly, the cornbread was hard and tasted stale, was cold and tasteless. I actually choked on some, it was so dry. POOR POOR POOR.\\nIn the Positive column:  Okay, the Beef Ribs were pretty great actually. But at $22+ are a bit high. In the end, we might go back for a $10 sandwich, but it's very unlikely. PaulO's doesn't even come close to the old Reo's ribs out here, and Busters BBQ really knows what they are doing compared to PaulO's. I wished I could be kinder, but from the lime green (puke colored) decor to the lack of real umph with their lacking tasteless food, Paulo's was and probably will be put in our 'loss' column."},{"name":"The Brewer's Table","address":"4715 E 5th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I think I'm in love. \\nFar East side, close to Justine's.

Choose any number of meats, cheeses, and accoutrements you'd like. Pretty much everything seems like a good choice: I know, because we were originally brought the wrong order and I actually got a little jealous because everything on the board seemed awesome. But, so were our choices. We got: 1) Prosciutto de Parma (salty, fatty, a bit slippery, and fresh); 2) Westfield Blue cheese (milder than some blue cheeses, but still delightfully tart); 3) Pantaleo cheese (reminded me of a Parmesan off the block); 4) Fig jam (savory+jam=always a fun combo); 5) Vermont wildflower honey (so fruity... always get honey with a cheese plate). The plate also included an astringent mustard that added a nice finishing touch and cleared out our sinuses as a nice bonus.\\n\\nWe probably could've stopped there, because with the bread it was all quite a bit of food, but we just had to do a full pizza as well.

The roasted mushrooms gave the pizza a delightful boost of umami. \\n\\nA note about crema di Prosciutto: It's the real Italian deal. I was trying to figure out what, exactly, it was (I mean, I get it - it's Prosciutto cream - but, like, what? How?), and there are just not internet explanations of this phenomenon in English.

So why the 4 stars you may ask. Well, my friend ordered the lobster ravioli and I had one bite and fell in love. It was in a garlic cream sauce and the ravioli had that fresh quality where it kind of melts in your mouth. Oh man. I shared my dish with my friend and she ate part of mine as well.

But it was time, and so I came, though now it is called Dine Out Boston.  And for $20, I was coming for 3 courses.\\n\\nFor my starter, I selected their Roasted Tomato Soup, which I found to be a bit thin, but quite intense in terms of the flavor of the headlining ingredient.  I liked it, though I did eye a passing Steak House Salad with House Vinaigrette and find that it looked rather tasty as it glistened by.\\n\\nThe bread arrived as a full loaf partially sliced through the thin crisp crust, with a soft fluffy center.  It was served warm and the soft butter easy to spread.\\n\\nI treated myself to not just the filet (The most tender cut of corn-fed Midwestern beef broiled expertly to melt-in-your-mouth.), but it Oscar style (crab cake, asparagus and b√©arnaise sauce) for an extra $15.  It came sizzling on a plate, and I was considerately warned that it was hot.  My filet was tender, the crabcake enrobed with the b√©arnaise sauce quite rich, the asparagus 3 stalks just tender.  If I were to upgrade my meat similarly in the future, I wonder if they'd be able to present it deconstructed as it may have been a tad too well sauced for me.  But it was quite good, with the sole disappointment being the lack of lumps in the crabcake which consisted mainly of the shredded flesh of the crustacean.\\n\\nSpeaking of lumps, I was surprised by the texture of the garlic mashed potatoes here.  Mashed was quite a misnomer as it was more pureed, though not quite whipped.  Perfect for infants in terms of texture, though definitely not bland enough for the wee ones.\\n\\nI seemed to remember the sole dessert being characterized as warm, so when my Warm Bread Pudding with Whiskey Sauce arrived at room temperature, I was caught off guard and my tastebuds were not satisfied.  When I inquired, I was told that it was served warmed for dinner, but things moved so fast at lunch that it was being served at room temperature.  But they were quite willing to warm it up for me, and not only that, but they ended up presenting me with an entire new portion of the dessert instead of the one I had already taken a bite out of.\\n\\nWith their RW crowds, food took longer to come out of the kitchen than is comfortable for someone who has to go back to work.  Service also suffered similarly somewhat as it took an extraordinarily long time for me to get my credit card back.\\n\\n*** 8/2014 RW ***\\n\\nTime for another RW lunch for $20!\\n\\n. Fresh Corn Chowder - sweet corn kernels, with a hit of pepper\\n\\n. Filet: The most tender cut of corn-fed Midwestern beef broiled expertly to melt-in-your-mouth.  Medium rare arrived closer to medium.\\n\\n. Creamed Spinach\\n. Garlic Mashed Potatoes\\n\\nUpgrade your Side to Sweet Potato Casserole for $4 - so I upgraded for $4 and then re-added the lunch time portion of creamed spinach for $4.75 since an order of the dinner time sweet potato would have clocked in at $10.  The casserole was like candy!  My DC opted for the garlic mashed ($5), so we had all 3 sides on the table for our utter enjoyment.\\n\\n. Chocolate Cheesecake - the flavor hit like whoa!\\n\\nYum, yum, yum, yum, yum, and yum!\\n\\nA very satisfying meal indeed.\\n\\n*** 8/2014 RW II ***\\n\\nI shouldn't have, but I didn't get the filet on this visit.  I thought I'd give the Salmon (Fresh wild salmon broiled and served with sizzling lemon butter) a try.  I rounded that out with their Steak House Salad with House Vinaigrette, and the totally yummy but no other option, Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake.  Oh, and I upgraded the side for $4 for the Fresh Asparagus with Hollandaise Sauce (normally $11 at dinner).\\n\\nThe salad was fine, except a bug decided to dive right in and find itself a little nest.  And this after I had but two bites, so I brought it to my server's attention and she had a runner bring me a fresh salad.\\n\\nThe fish was fine as well, but it lacked the wow factor that the filet has.  The asparagus were, as they say, pencil thin, though there were actually thinner than a pencil mostly.  This being the case, I assumed they would be young and tender, but turns out a few of the stalks were rather tough and fibrous.  On the whole though, they were rather tasty with the hollandaise.\\n\\nOther than the unfortunate little visitor (RIP, as I got him as he tried to make a second landing at my table), the only other negative was - Why was the party of 3 who arrived after my little party of one had made her arrival known at the hostess stand get seated before me?\\n\\n*** 8/2014 RW III ***\\n\\nThis time I opted for my filet rare.

It is in fact the best burger you will find in Boston, if not the country. Sure, $26 is steep, but it is also worth it. The meat is perfectly juicy without being greasy. The French fries are a mysterious combination of crispy on the outside and cloud-like fluffy on the inside. (Probably the best fries I've ever had.)

I was seated immediately and was told upfront that the restaurant is accepting cash only. The server was very personable. I made it known to her that it was my first time eating Senegalese food, and she was able to quickly offer drink and food suggestions. She highly recommended the Bissap juice, the first 4 appetizers from the appetizer list, the M√©choui, and the Maf√©. I ordered most of what was recommended. The service was slow because there was only one chef. The chef seemed to be doing all of the prep work and cooking after the order is placed, one dish at a time. To give you an idea, it took about 20-25 minutes for the appetizer to come out, and another 25 minutes after that for 2 entrees. \\n\\nThe Bissap juice was absolutely refreshing. I loved the hibiscus and acidic, fruity flavors in it. The Croquettes de Poisson soaked up a lot of oil and felt a bit heavy. I did like the crispiness of the croquettes and I could definitely taste the fish. The sauce was made by the chef in an episode of Chopped on Food Network, and it was a nice herb flavor. However, I wish there was more of it as there were 3 croquettes but only a spoonful of the sauce; it was not enough. The M√©choui was the best dish of the night, as the lamb was very tender and all of it just fell right off the bone. It had great texture and roasted meat flavor. The couscous that came with the dish was a good balance when eaten with the lamb. The Maf√©, which is the server's favorite, was also quite delicious.

In New Orleans, they call them Bacos. I have eaten many. I felt like the flavor combinations were creative, but the actual flavors of the Baos did not always work.

I believe one was a coconut shrimp, and the other was a bit spicy. The two shrimp ones were just OK for me. The sauce that was on each one had very little flavor and therefore the bao had very little flavor. The Avocado Bao was really good. It was a piece of fried Avocado with some veggies and a sauce on top. We shared the Fakinit tater tots ($2.50), and I was surprisingly not a big fan of these. They are made with vegan \\"bacon\\" (which I like) and covered with a slightly sweet/spicy sauce and green onions. The issue really was that the strips of bacon sat at the bottom and were very thick instead of being on it where we could enjoy the flavor with the tots, and the sauce was quite wet and soaked through the tots quickly so they were soggy.

The brand illy is everywhere at the cafe so I assumed that's what they use to make their coffees and espresso. The ham and cheese on a croissant ($9) was good but I think their food was a bit pricy however given that tax and tips were included so it's understandable."},{"name":"Long John Silver's","address":"4670 W Broad St","city":"Columbus","stars":"2.5","text":"The food is great and my favorite is the fish tacos.

The kid that answered the phone was upbeat and positive and welcomed my order. When I picked my order up, the owner and the kid were extra hospitable. I don't typically care about about someone's attitude if the food is good, but the Donato's experience made simply picking up a pizza a positive experience.

Arhiboo Shawarma is a casual go-to, offering a mix of typical Middle Eastern fare, from gyros to falafel, in simple digs. Interior decor pretty minimal, but the food is very tasty.\\n\\nAs the saying goes, \\"good things come in small packages\\". This small restaurant located in Stone Mountain off Memorial Drive and Rock Bridge Road is the best Mediterranean food. A humble family operated business. The lady that is at the counter is so lovely and friendly. Food is prepared to order, freshly cooked and you can see their kitchen from the counter while ordering and paying your bill.\\n\\nMy first time coming here, went with a colleague of mine and we ordered the meat combination Shawarma plate which comes with two kinds of meats of your choice with Basmati, Rice, Greek Salad and Pita Bread. I choose for Lamb and Chicken as the meats. Large portions of meal, tendered meat, very flavorful and tasty food with minimal wait time. Basmati Rice was soft and fluffy just the way rice should be. They give you a ton of rice, get some extra sauce though.\\n\\nThis place is just a counter seating. It is really a take out place with few places to sit. They have few chairs outside, you can use that when the inside is full or if you like to enjoy the patio style. Reasonable and affordable prices. Clean place and they also have drive-thru available. Go eat at this place, you won't be disappointed. As this place is in a shopping plaza, their is ample free parking in and around the restaurant. I would really recommend this place to give a try. I will be sure going back."},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Very tasty pizza! We got the funghi and the Etruscan!

This was the day 2 years in the waiting. I first caught wind of this restaurant/brewery idea during their early crowdfunding efforts and have been following their progress ever since. As a homebrewer, a craft beer evangelist and perpetually on the eternal quest to find the best food and experience, the idea behind this establishment has kept me tuned in and eagerly waiting. \\n\\nWalking in, the space is open, inviting and filled with smiles of the staff, none excluded. The window display of their foeder (Wood Barrel) room, I could not stop looking at. Beautiful. I sat at the corner bar as I wanted to attempt to take it all in. Behind the bar was an open faced wood grill and very friendly and professional staff. I had a great time talking with the one gentleman behind the bar (Air Force, and apologies for not getting his name) cooking my burger. \\n\\nI ordered the hearth burger as it seemed a great lunch intro to what they are capable of. The burger included dry aged beef, mushroom ketchup, raclette cheese on a buttered brioche bun. Cooked perfectly. The raclette was melted bubbly with a kitchen torch and was a perfect touch. The mushroom ketchup had every bit of umami one would guess it would and I look forward to having again \\n\\nMy waiter Tyler was open, engaging and friendly in his ability to answer any question regarding the menu or space I had. I really appreciated founder Jake offering to give me a tour of , and the story behind, the Foeder area. Sadly the house brewed beer was not ready yet, but i'm positive good things will come to those who wait. Otherwise they have a solid selection of guest beers, wines and spirits. I took a look upstairs at the brewers table overlooking the restaurant and yes, this will definitely be a birthday spot. Adorning the upper walls of the downstairs are jars lined with an amazing and colorful array of vegetables fermenting/pickling. Above those hanging from the rafters are a plethora of air drying herbs. \\n\\nThe question remains, 2 painful years in the waiting. Was it worth it? Unconditionally and unequivocally without a doubt, a resounding YES. This is a beautiful space, great food inspired in part by the 4 main brewing ingredients. One would be hard pressed in finding a more inviting, friendly, professional and knowledgeable staff in Austin. Great parking is always a plus.

Not too long after, our food came out, hot, beautiful presentation, and tasted absolutely delicious. \\n\\nOnce the kitchen closes, this place turns into a real bar. The lights dim, and music comes on much louder. While we were there, they played 90's RnB. We had a great time. \\n\\nThe pricing is affordable for the value of the food.

Anyway, I noticed the put the fries in a basket and place them inside the bag, uncovered. I thought that was pretty weird that the fries weren't covered. When I got home, they were a soggy, cold mess needless to say. The wings were so basic, it was already breaded and just re-fried and tossed in sauce. I could have gotten that from a bag out of the frozen food section. The lemon pepper seasoning was waaaay too salty. Now I know why I haven't gone in years.

Although I'm a sucker for pasta, I try to stay away from ordering it out a lot. This pasta was freshly handmade that day so I definitely couldn't resist.

First of all, I like personally, full pitas that I can wrap my meat and fixings in and be able to eat together. But this is the platter not the wrap, so I dug in.  The meat and rice just were not seasoned or cooked properly.

Rice is good, very important. Karaage chicken is good. And of course, the tiki drinks are good. I know that a place like this has to put sushi on the menu to get all the whitebread in the door, but honestly it's a waste of menu space. More of the tasty, fun fusion plates would be welcome.

This sushi spot has it all; Contempory/romantic ambience, great customer service and uniquely delicious sushi rolls. \\n\\nUpon arrival around 730pm on a Saturday night we were greeted and seated right away. Our waitress (I need to start remembering names!) was the sweetest and very personable. We ordered Miso soups, their popular Sushi Nachos and two of the signature rolls; The Black Panther and Hulk Smash. \\n\\nThe Miso soup was very flavorful and the tofu was soft and not gummy. We enjoyed the sushi nachos but wouldn't be something I'd order often as it was good and very filling, but I think their signature rolls are what is really worth getting here. I definitely loved the uniqueness and freshness of both rolls. Never had spinach on my sushi but somehow this worked out well! The eel on the Black Panther was perfectly cooked and not burnt. In short, our sushi cravings were beyond satisfied. \\n\\nThis place is a good option for a date night. It can be a bit pricy due to their signature rolls, but well worth it.

She told me fruit & cheese plate was what they had, along w/ the beef chili & other meat items that were of no concern to me. Seriously, are you expecting me to eat that for dinner? Um, no. If you have an event give people better veg options, so inconsiderate.\\nBut wait, it gets better. We were hungry & decided to just eat in the restaurant. So while we stood there waiting for someone to help us & then a line formed behind us because it took more than 5 minutes for someone to seat us. So we then wait again for the server to even come over, which she should have done sooner & bring water, but she didn't, so we had to ask for it which doesn't come w/ ice, which doesn't make sense. Oy vey. We finally get our food, which came after the people who sat & ordered after us which was weird. If your menu is going to say that something is roasted, please don't bring it out steamed/boiled/etc. Then to make matters worse, it's not even hot. The table next to us had complained about their water for tea not being hot at all. Apparently they don't understand the importance of temperature. It was like 60 degrees outside & they had the a/c blasting, super uncomfortable & just stupid & wasteful. So then it comes time to pay & I have a gift card to cover part of the bill (not cheap either).

I don't frequent this place, but it's slightly cheaper than Thai Moon especially for dinner price so I thought I'd try their Drunken Noodles. I first checked their menu online, which annoyingly makes you download the PDF automatically. I called to place the takeout order to which a lady answered but put me on hold because \\"we are very busy right now\\". She actually didn't put me on a normal hold where you hear cheesy elevator music, but it seemed she just left the phone receiver on the counter since I could hear her distantly telling a customer how much to pay for his order. Then she started chatting with a coworker in X language. I waited a good 5+ minutes before I tried saying, \\"HELLO??\\". A man answered the phone and finally took my order. He told me it would take 10 minutes. \\n\\nI arrive at the restaurant which completely barren and has literally 1 customer dining in. I don't get why they said they were busy. I go to pick up my order from the counter, and the takeout bag feels very light. I come back home, open the bag and find the takeout container is not filled to the top. In fact, the rice noodles & some veggies thrown in were sparse and warm-- Not wok-fried or served hot. It's NOTHING like the drunken noodles, or Pad Kee Mao, I've had before. Zero spice. The rice noodles were not even cooked all the way and had a bite like the hard refrigerated ones I've bought from Hong Kong/88 Market. The carrots didn't look fresh or peeled. I assume the chef just tossed some oyster/hoisin sauce to \\"season\\" the noodles and called it a day. Probably closer to Chinese he fen than Thai.\\n\\nSeriously disappointing and not even worth my money.

There's something on the menu to please everyone and the cocktail menu was intriguing with all the interesting drink names - \\"No Sex in the Rainbow Room\\" or \\"Absinthe-Minded Professor.\\" \\n\\nWe started with the Goat Cheese Panna Cotta. Now, I don't know much about panna cotta except that I usually watch Ina Garten make a beautiful one on her show. This panna cotta was creamy without the usual pungent smell of goat cheese and I loved how fried green tomatoes were served with it because the flavors compliment each other well. The only con to this dish was that there was not more fried green tomatoes to eat with the panna cotta. Some people and I actually started smearing the goat cheese on the complimentary bread. \\n\\nI shared the Gemelli pasta and a Funghi Pizza with a friend. I expected the Gemelli to be served with an excess of tomato sauce, but I was pleasantly surprised that it had  very little sauce, and was more creamy, almost with the consistency of Hamburger Helper haha. I know it must seem insulting to compare a dish to what others may call a disgusting contribution to lazy American cooking, but I mean this in a good way. Ok, let's just call the dish a fancier mac n cheese.\\n\\nThe sizes of the pizzas were slightly larger than personal pan - about the size of a California Pizza Kitchen pizza. Sliced into quadrants, I was full after 1 slice of pizza. I'm not quite sure what type of mushrooms were on the pizza, but there was definitely a combination of different cheeses on top of the pizza and no tomato sauce. I could smell the Brooklyn pizza next to me which did have a tomato sauce on it. To be honest, I thought $16 was a bit pricey for the pizzas granted they probably use better ingredients (that's totally an unintended jab at Papa John's haha). Pizzas are $10 after 10pm - which is a better deal. However, after having cold leftover pizza last night, I have to say that Cibo's pizzas are best consumed fresh and hot. The portions were generous that there were definitely leftovers brought home. \\n\\nSeating is comfortable in the restaurant. It's a little dim so it's kind of romantic but still okay for a casual group of 8. The only thing I didn't like were the overstuffed pillows on our seats on the bench booth - we were seated in the middle of the restaurant with 4 2-person tables put together. Pillows just got in the way. Service is okay - sometimes it was a little difficult to flag down our waitress. The server with the food was a bit odd because he'd roll his eyes and give us death stares when we were confused about the entree he was about to set down. I think he actually said \\"You better eat it if I'm putting this down.\\" \\n\\nService isn't going to put a damper on my experience at Cibo though. I want to come back to try the other items on the menu. There are many small dishes there that I want to try that I think you can almost get away with doing a tapas-style dining experience."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Being from Kansas City, I'm a huge BBQ critic.

Seating is really difficult at dinner time and it's particularly difficult if you have a large group, but if it's just the two of you, you'll likely be butt up against the patrons next to and behind you. \\nWhen it comes to pizza, I want to be able to customize my pie. You have all the ingredients, can't you just make something with all the things I want? You can easily pay over $20 for a pie here and there is really nothing special about it and in my case it's often not even the pizza I want; its a group compromise.\\nParking is a nightmare because this area is always crowded. There are stairs to navigate in the back and the front is narrow, so accessibility is an issue if you have a wheelchair or someone on crutches.\\nPeople love to regard this place as THE BEST IN ATLANTA (I think people just repeat this enough to believe it) or COMPLETELY OVERRATED.

Being bombarded by \\"best of\\" signs as I entered, I couldn't help but get my hopes up. \\n\\nThe place itself isn't as nice as I'd expect. It looks more like a middle-of-the road Italian/pizza shop than a thai restaurant -- at least the ones I go to, which have a slightly dressier look to them. The waitress seated us and we were given some the wine and food menus, both of which offered a good selection. We had trouble deciding what we wanted, but finally settled on the mango curry chicken and lemongrass beef. \\n\\nThe food came out within five minutes -- I was impressed! But it wasn't nearly as good as some other thai places I've been to. I actually like Thai Moon in Arlington better -- and Brown Sugar in Boston MUCH better.

Save up and do the 10 Course Chef's Tasting.

Fortunately, the staff stepped in and cleared out a bar table for us to roost in while waiting for our diner table to open up.\\n\\nWe were seated a little before when our reservation was supposed to start in the far back corner.

After not -too- much deliberation we decided on the 10-course Chef's tasting which is about $125 per person. \\n\\nOur first few courses were light and fresh - almost entirely seafood based. There was everything from squid noodles to a delicious piece of lobster salad to a plump juicy scallop. They were all delicious but the next 3 savory courses were incredible. A couple of those stand out in memory - especially the Sweetbreads and Chicken Confit plate and the Lamb three ways: OMG. Those were seriously out of this world. Our waiter was really helpful in telling us about everything on on our plate and kept the water, drinks and wine coming for our table. It was quite an experience. \\n\\nOur dessert courses were so unique (there were 3 of those) - one course was a tea-infused Panna Cotta - Absolutely amazing - the tea tingled my senses and I highly recommend this if your are a fan of herbal, light desserts. We were also served 4 different things all in the same course - each of us got a different plate and we took turns sampling each other's plates - Out of that course the Taza Chocolate Mousse stood out as well as a Peanut Butter Ice Cream dessert that was out of this world. \\n\\nI recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to splurge on a true culinary experience.

I'd been trying to get a taste of this hip, sustainable and supposedly delicious sushi restaurant. Twice I went to the one in SE Portland, and twice I left disappointed because the wait was impossible. So finally, one opened up on NW 23rd. I was pretty thrilled about it and was determined to wait it out no matter how long the line would be.\\n\\nOf course the line at NW 23rd was also long but I stayed. And I was so glad I made that decision. The ambiance was very chic and modern, totally suited for the Alphabet District.  We sat at the bar where our bartender was also our server. We ordered brisket, sauteed geoduck, crustacean roll, sunset roll, and sea eel roll. Their selection of mock cocktails were quiet impressive, just as tasty without the effect of alcohol. \\n\\nThe beef was very tender, juicy, and smokey. They claimed the beef to be only grass fed and no hormones added whatsoever. The fish was very fresh. Normally I do not like sea eel due to the fishy smell. But at Bamboo Sushi, there was no fishy smell at all. The crustacean roll was interesting; shrimp wrapped in some nori noodle w/ butter poached lobster and yuzu foam on top. It was fun to look at. The lobster was absolute delicious but as a whole roll, the taste didn't give me a wow moment. The California sunset roll was like the typical California but topped w/ spicy tuna and tempura flakes for an added crunch. \\n\\nThe last, but not the least, dish was the geoduck. I would give this place 5 stars for this dish alone. It was something I'd never tasted before. I don't know what went in the chef's mind when he put together this delicate and tastebud exploding dish. The geoduck was thinly sliced, lightly battered and fried and then sauteed with fresh shitaki mushroom.  The geoduck was very tender and sweet. The shitaki mushroom complemented the texture of geoduck very well.The sauce was so amazing; the aioli was very creamy but yet light. I could indulge myself just by eating the sauce alone. What I found so amazing about the sauteed geoduck was that when you took that one bite, you'd know that it was perfect. It was a guilty indulgence - buttery, sweet and a full flavor of umami. Surprisingly, afterward, the taste was so clean that I didn't have any aftertaste or even a realization that I just ate a geoduck. This wasn't my first time of eating the geoduck. The first time I felt like eating a low-tide sponge but that's for another review. \\n\\nDid I mention about the service? It was pretty top notch. We noticed that the bartender inspected each glass for marks or smears.

Now down here at the food carts on 9th, I have eaten at around 13 or 14 of the carts, I'm not sure anymore of the number, but I still have a long way to go. On a Saturday, the carts tend to get busy. The Hawaiian place with a line, the German place, a Korean cart doing well. I wanted to try a different cart, and you can never go wrong with Thai, but no one was at this spot?\\n\\nMy standards are always either Tom Kha or Pad See Ew and I decided to go with the latter and a Thai iced tea. I was asked if I'd like it spicy? Of course! And he did deliver on the spicy.\\n\\nFor the most part, this was your standard chicken pad see ew. The broad noodles, the light and sweet soy sauce, green veggies including broccoli, and the addition of carrots (which could have been cooked a little more, they were a bit on the raw side) and then there was the spice kick. Some places I've been to, will basically just throw some red pepper flake into a dish and call it Thai hot or extra spicy. The problem with that is that it doesn't get cooked into the food or the sauce and it's just a bad taste to a meal. Here at Sawasdee, it was cooked into everything and the heat was beautiful, that is if you are one that can take that sort of heat. I thoroughly enjoyed this dish and will gladly grace this cart again in the future. The Thai iced tea? Can anyone make this bad? No. And it was good here as well.\\n\\nJust because there isn't a huge line doesn't mean the food isn't on par, it just means that it's still not known to everyone yet.

My friends couldn't get a reservation big enough (20+) at Benihana so we called up Nakato. They were very helpful and were able to reserve two hibachi grills back to back. My friends and I have been back to Nakato over a dozen times since. It is the only place we go for birthdays or just a Friday night to get lit (hibachi pun) with your friends. The only thing better than the service is the food. I love the filet and calamari but everything is great. Good luck finishing everything because the portions are huge. And again, I am not just some guy, I know my hibachi and Nakato is the crown jewel. Don't listen to the haters, if you want to go to some place and be in and out in 20 minutes, go to Panda Express.

From other Yelp reviews we had dinner there last Saturday night (3/16/19) and it was spectacular.  We came from Sarasota, my son from San Francisco and met because he was there for a conference. We started with ceviche (the one with pink sauce and also the mixte).  Both were wonderful although the pink sauce seemed to win out.  The hot sauce they serve with it, is h-o-t!  Just be careful.  We had the ceviche accompanied by an avocado, perhaps ever so slightly over ripe, but delicious nonetheless.  And the green plantains that accompanied the dishes were a favorite. From there we went to the house specialty, roasted chicken.  From the first bite we were surprised at just how delicious chicken could be!  Wow.  This was and is something worth the detour, or perhaps even worth a return trip.  It was more than outstanding. We finished the meal with creme brulee which also was absolutely wonderful.  On top of that great food there were other pluses: Santiago was a wonderful server, and there were two birthday parties where the staff sang, to everyone's delight.\\nThis was truly a wonderful and spectacular dining experience IN EVERY WAY.

The brisket is also great, not too spicy, not too tough.  They don't carry Jalapeno Sausage, or were out when we were there.  The regular Sausage is juicy and good.

If I could, I would eat here every single night of the week. There is no where else that you get this quality of food for the price. Every other place has pasta dishes over $20, but here you can get a shrimp and scallop pasta for less than $20. AMAZING.\\n\\nRemember CASH ONLY. Lots of places in North End are cash only so be sure that you bring enough or else you might be running out to the ATM in the middle of your meal. The first time we came here we arrived at around 4:45 PM on a Saturday night. Since it opened around then, we figured that it would be plenty of time and we wouldn't have to wait that long. Boy, were we wrong. Maybe it was cause it was Labor Day weekend and the fact that it actually opens at 4:30 PM and not 5, we actually had to wait around 2 hours. It's unfortunate that you have to stand in line the entire time. \\n\\nRecently I actually went to the South End location that takes reservations and after having ordering the same thing at both locations, I can honestly say that they are identical. Although the Hanover street has a much better location being that it is in North End, the South End location takes reservations, which is a huge plus. You might not be able to get Mike's or Modern Pastry after dinner, but not having to wait hours in line is definitely worth it.\\n\\nFood:\\n\\nShrimps and Scallops w/ Giacomo's Sauce 5/5: From the very moment the server puts this pasta in front of you, you are filled with a sense of heavenly bliss. The smell is amazing and the food looks just as good. The linguine was cooked perfectly al dente and had just the right amount of chew. Both the scallops and shrimp were tender and not overcooked to the point where it tastes rubbery. The real magic is in the Giacomo sauce. It's described as a lobster based red sauce, and that's exactly what it is. It's rare where you can actually taste the lobster in the sauce but I swear, it actually tasted like my dish had lobster in it. I've never tasted any sauce like this before. If this is your first time at Giacomo's, I highly recommend you try their house special sauce first.\\n\\nLobster Ravioli 5/5: Best ravioli I have ever had. I feel like I'm saying that a lot in this review, but honestly this place has the best Italian food. The ravioli is tender and filled with lobster. When you cut the ravioli in half and mix it in the sauce, you won't ever regret waiting two hours in line. The sauce it comes in is a creamy garlic sauce with diced tomatoes. Both the lobster ravioli and linguine with Giacomo sauce are so vastly different yet both wonderful that I highly suggest you order both.\\n\\nAlso be prepared to eat lots of bread. One of my favorite parts is dipping their bread in the pasta sauce, both the cream sauce from the ravioli and the Giacomo sauce. If you have any hesitation on eating here, quickly throw it out the window and start lining up! You absolutely will not regret eating at Giacomo's!"},{"name":"Nan Ling","address":"179 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"1.5","text":"horrible customer service.

I know I shouldn't be surprised after all of the 5 star reviews I read, but I was! I was not expecting the food to be as good as it was!\\n\\nFirst, we were so lucky to not have a line when we went, but the downside was there was so much to take in, since it was our first time in the restaurant.  Since we were alone, we were able to ask a lot of questions to really get the full menu experience.  In my mind, you can't go wrong with tots, so I was thrilled to see all of the different variations.  We went with a simple truffle tot, but it was incredible.  I would highly recommend it, but I know I will be venturing out to something different next time. \\n\\nFor the 'main' meal, we got the Glen Rhee Bao, Kicken Chicken, Firecracker Shrimp, and Oh My Grouper.  I'm not sure which was the best option, because I liked them all individually - but for different reasons.  First, the chicken, even with sriracha, wasn't terribly spicy.  So, don't let that hold you back.  However, it is full of flavor and goodness.  I also really enjoyed the Grouper - its a lighter alternative and the slaw really adds texture.  The Glen Rhee was great with the Asian Pear salsa, it added a difference that I've never tasted before and it wasn't overpowering.  Lastly, the Shrimp was also super tasty and very filling. Also, not too spicy- which is a super win."},{"name":"McMenamins Crystal Hotel","address":"303 SW 12th Ave.","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This place is pretty effing awesome, although it's not a conventional hotel experience, per say.

That was to be expected but the problem is that they didn't have an area to accommodate the people in line.  Everyone was herded like cattle into the small space between the hostess stand and the front door.  We escaped outside only to find ourselves trying to avoid getting hit by the front door or by cars trying to navigate the tiny parking lot.\\n\\nWe waited for half an hour to be seated.  Then it took fifteen minutes to be acknowledged by our server and get water glasses.  Every seat was taken and the volume was at a ridiculous level.  They played loud music over everyone's voices and that made it difficult to maintain conversation.\\n\\nThere was barely any space between tables so I felt like we were right on top of the people next to us.  To make it worse, the server stood in the gap while taking orders and delivering food to other tables; for me it was too close for comfort.  It was as if they crammed as many tables into the dining room as possible without regard to the dining experience.\\n\\nI ordered the Shrimp and Grits--shrimp and diced chicken sausage in a rich cream sauce.  It was not the best or worst I've tried but it was tasty.  The portion was generous and I couldn't eat it all.

I'm a Virginia native and I love myself some barbecue, especially now that I'm living in LA. Here's my take on my experience at the Salt Lick.\\n\\nWORTH NOTING FIRST: The Salt Lick is *CASH ONLY*! This was a surprise to us when we first arrived. They do have an ATM on site, but I believe the fee is $3. Bring cash with you when you come! Alcoholic drinks are BYOB, but you can also buy them on site in case you forget. Also, if you are visiting the Austin area, please note that this is about a 30 minute drive from Austin. Your Uber/Lyft there and back may cost more than your meal - if I remember correctly, it was $30/per person for family style (all you can eat). We had a rental car and made the drive, but I think this is a crucial point if you're in Austin for vacation and don't have a car. \\n\\nOkay, now that the crucial points are out of the way:\\n\\nFOOD: We were a large group and we all opted to do the \\"family style\\" options. I believe it came with brisket, ribs, sausage, and maybe one othe rmeat? However, we were so disappointed it didn't come with pulled pork! The family style option also came with cole slaw, baked beans, potato salad, and bread as sides. The ribs and sausage were by far the best part of the meal. They were both so juicy and tender. We honestly couldn't get enough of the sausage (har har). The brisket, however, was super dry and required quite a bit of sauce to be palatable. The sides were good - I only tried the cole slaw, which was perfect and crunchy. My family loved the baked beans and potato salad too.\\n\\nAMBIANCE: The Salt Lick is set up like one giant dining hall, and it is absolutely packed full of people! The tables and benches are super long, so you can fit quite a bit of people on one table. The service was really great and our waitress was attentive in bringing us our food \\"refills\\". Initially, the vibe felt very much like a cattle call for food, but once the food came out, I completely forgot that I was crammed in there with what felt like 500 other people. This place definitely has tourist appeal and it was bumpin' the whole time we were there. They also have this giant wood fire pit at the front of the restaurant, but spoiler alert: this is for show and there's no way they cook all the meat like that!\\n\\nOverall, I liked my experience at The Salt Lick. It wasn't the best BBQ I've ever had in my life, but the overall meal was enjoyable and we left full and content. However, I will say that if you're looking for less of a cattle-call for food, far drive from Austin, tourist-trap-packed-with-people experience, you might not enjoy the Salt Lick."},{"name":"Pambiche","address":"2811 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"First time back after a few years.

There was nothing in particular that I didn't like, I just wasn't impressed by the prices and the atmosphere. It was simply okay and that was how I felt. I recently went to Barcelona in Inman Park for a friends birthday party and I was blown away. Our server was JR and to say he was amazing would be an understatement. Because there was more than 6 of us, he told us about the family style tapa menu option they have for big parties. Basically, you pay $35, $45, or $55 for family style tapas. Instead of everyone ordering separately, JR asked all of us what we liked and didn't liked, and catered the tapa selection to the things that fit our table best. The down side to this is that they don't tell you what tapas you are getting but that doesn't even matter because they bring so much food that you couldn't possibly not have something to pick from. This style of serving changed our night from a simple dinner to an entire experience. I know that we would not have had that much fun if we ordered separate tapas ourselves. All the guesswork was removed and it was so much fun. It was my friends birthday so I brought a cake and they brought it out to the table on time and even help cut and serve it. It is always really hard to pick a restaurant for a large group (especially when you have picky eaters (one of my friends only eat chicken tenders and fries smh)), but even she enjoyed it bc there was so much to choose from.

We had reservations for a private room at the steakhouse. Two servers tended to us throughout the evening and they did a fine job keeping up with water refills, and drink and food orders. \\n\\nI am not a steak eater so when I found out this was where we were going, I was not overly excited as most people are. Also we have a Ruth Chris in Pittsburgh so being that it was a chain, again my hopes were not too high. \\n\\nTo begin, I ordered a Pomegranate Mash - a tasty, strong cocktail that ended up being my only one of the evening. Our table ordered various appetizers/sides as everything is a la carte - Lobster Mac and Cheese, Brussel Sprouts, Mushrooms, and their special of the evening, Hashbrowns topped with bacon, cheese, and sour cream. We were a little ambitious as we got two of the mac and hashbrowns but the dishes were licked clean by the end of the meal. The brussel sprouts were perfectly crispy with a hint of sweetness. The hashbrowns had a very crunchy fried exterior with a nice soft potato filling inside. And though I do not like mac and cheese, I gave it a try! It was actually pretty good, even paired with the lobster (seafood is never high on my list). Overall, this was a pleasing start to the meal. \\n\\nFor my entree, I ended up getting the Harvest Salad with the addition of chicken. Again, not being a red meat person I knew my options were limited and I was not interested in filling up on chicken alone. The salad was well balanced, with a spice from the pecans, sweetness from the cranberries, and well seasoned with the addition of the tender chicken. I was very satisfied with my choice! \\n\\nMy husband thoroughly enjoyed his steak (I could not tell you which one he had) and even shared a bite or two with me. Though on the rare side, I did not find it to be too bad! \\n\\nTo end the meal and celebrate the bride/groom and the brides birthday, the waitress brought out two large slices of chocolate cake for the table to share. It was stacked three layers high with a thick chocolate frosting and sliced strawberries on top. The perfect end to a delightful meal. \\n\\nThough very very expensive and not our usual night out, I enjoyed this experience way more than I anticipated.

I just told her that it needs to be made correctly!\\n\\nSecondly, my plate comes back ... it's STILL not blackened shrimp, all the cool did was put some more seasoning in it! Mind you it's the same shrimp, how I know? As someone who knows how CHEAP AF these restaurants are I make sure I took two tails off of the shrimp before sending it back... the plate came back with those two shrimps with missing tails .

We were planning to go to Universal and this was one of the only restaurants open at 11 around the area so we gave it a shot. It was practically empty when we came (makes sense, we came in like 10 minutes after it opened). The waitress was very welcoming. The food took a little longer for it to be made but it was pretty good. We got the Peruvian chicken since that is one of the things that it was known for. The chicken was not as juicy as I expected and was a little dry and saltier than I would have liked but the overall flavor is still positive. The Chaufa rice had a good amount and contained plantains which in honestly complemented the saltier foods really well. I would probably not order the same thing as I felt that it was \\"OK\\" but the selection is wide and I would definitely come back and try something else as they seem to have some pretty good things on the menu. \\nFood: 4/5 \\n--Ordered the Chaufa Mixa Rice which contained rice, beef, chicken, and shrimp as well as a side of plantains. The dish was good but I felt the meats were cooked a bit too much and felt dry because of it. It is large enough to be shared amongst two individuals\\nThe Peruvian rotisserie chicken I ordered was flavorful, but it was a little salty for my tastebuds. \\n\\nPrice: 3/5 \\n--Chaufa Mixed Rice $18\\n-- Half Rotisserie Chicken $7.75\\n-- Definitely more on the higher end in terms of pricing\\n\\nAtmosphere: \\n--Nice ambiance. You can see the rotisserie chicken being slow cooked when you walk in. The place is quite large.\\nService: 5/5\\n--The waitress that served us was very helpful and gave us recommendations and always had a smile so it was a good welcoming experience."},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"A must if you are in ATL!!!

The original location doesn't take reservations, so if you're pressed for time, come here instead. The menu is exactly the same and any difference in flavor is negligible.\\n\\nThe signature dish is the Ike's Vietnamese fish sauce wings. The wings are marinated with fish sauce and some sugar before they're deep fried. After the fryer, they're basted with even more fish sauce and some garlic to help balance out the flavor. The fish sauce is incredibly potent in the wings; the flavor is infused in every aspect of the chicken. This also makes the wings very salty, and no amount of sugar or garlic can counteract this. The chicken is piping hot, juicy and tender. The skin adheres well to the meat and is very crispy.\\n\\nThe Muu Paa Kham Waan is pretty good. It's extremely spicy grilled boar collar served with chilled mustard greens. The greens are kept on ice to help keep them fresh and crisp. You're supposed to wrap the boar up in the greens and then eat it. The boar is very meaty, but not gamy or tough to chew. The level of spice in this dish is incredible, so beware of setting your lips on fire.\\n\\nThe Hoi Thawt is a Thai interpretation of Vietnamese banh xeo. It's a broken crepe with mussels, eggs, chives and bean sprouts served with a sriracha sauce. The overall flavor was nice, but the crepe needs to be crispier to give the dish more texture.\\n\\nThe khao soi with chicken is a very hearty dish that's easy to share. It's coconut Thai curry with noodles and chicken. The chunks of chicken are large, tender, and moist. The curry is sweet and creamy. The noodles are flat egg noodles and have a good al dente texture and bite to them.\\n\\nService was pretty friendly and attentive. Everything came out fast and hot. The portions are small here so it's almost like a tapas place."},{"name":"Ocean Wave By Harry And Sons","address":"820 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Had a sushi craving and a girls lunch date so the pick was Ocean Wave. First time here and I'm eager to return. Parking was $5 However we were given a voucher for $5 off the bill so I was happy about that. There was no wait so seating was quick. I love the decor and atmosphere. There was a full bar and a separate sushi bar, booth seating a window tables. I notice past the bathroom is another dining room. So large and more tables for dining. The goal was sushi so I decided to go with the spicy shrimp roll. Such a great choice. It's just as it sounds with a cucumber added. I also went with the dim sum and cheese roll appetizers. Cheese rolls were so good I ordered a second one for the table. Lastly we're the drinks. Now since I was driving and I stay pretty far considering if I want to drink so I went with a martini under the light and fruity section. Now I was expecting the drink to be light and fruity and it was NOT! Omg it was the strongest drink I've had for a lunch meal. For any meal. It's the type of drink you make it your trying to get drunk. My friend had the lemon drop and it was just as strong. We couldn't drink them so we asked for it to be removed or the tickets. Our server politely explained he can not remove items and proceeded to give us separate cups of juice to try and dilute the drink. He apologized and said they usually have strong drinks.

The head brewer, Charles, was tending bar and it was a pleasure to get a chance to meet him and chat about beer and his love of music, which is why the brewery is called Broken Strings. Apparently they have music events at the brewery, so I'll have to be sure to come back! The Sunday afternoon was quiet and there were other cool people at the bar who were friendly, as craft beer people tend to be. I ordered the Mr. Wendal in a 12 oz pour before I realized it was over 11% ABV so it was a sipper, no doubt, but not only due to the higher alcohol level, but to truly enjoy all the lovely flavors in this Bourbon Cognac Barrel aged sweet stout with flavors of hazelnut and vanilla beans with a reference to Arrested Development. Since the one beer was quite enough I decided to take some beers home to enjoy later. Can't wait to come back again to experience some of the awesome music!

Its a bacon cheese burger sandwiched between 2 donuts, it may sound weird, but surprisingly delicious.  Another favorite are their Parmesan & truffle oil fries, which are addictive.  Their burgers are huge and well worth the money.  Their Philly's are awesome with a soft bread inside and crunchy outside, tons of meat & onions with a cheese sauce, a little messy, but worth it.\\n\\nOverall hands down one of the best food trucks in Orlando!

You're sitting on backless acrylic stools and if you're wearing slick leggings like I was, you'll be fighting to not slide off. Lol. We asked them to give us backed stools and they move the furniture around without issue. \\n-the hookah is C average. Doesn't last long without burning or the flavor becoming too strong to smoke...almost like you're licking the tobacco. Gross! They made attempts to fix it for us but it didn't help much. I'm a hookah connoisseur so I know what I know. We paid for a new hookah, same result. They were also out of the first 2 flavors we requested. So inventory may be an issue. They will add tip and gratuity to your hookah and ask that you pay for it when you receive it and not when you're ready for your total check. \\n-Music was A+++.

The restaurant was very modern and had great atmosphere. We got seated quickly and our server (Caitlyn) was excellent. The cocktail menu was interesting and inspirational. The taste was not as good as we expected though(still good just not outstanding). The dishes on the menu all sounded delicious, and we ordered three appetizers. Assorted papad with three different chutneys was a great start to the dinner. Three chutneys were totally different styles, but so harmonious to eat with the papad. Then we tried potato tikki with kale tempura. That was delicious! Kale tempura was crispy and refreshing. The pork belly was juicy and tender. The sauce was kinda like bbq sauce but had more sophisticated flavors. For entrees, monk fish dish exceeded my expectations. It was not fishy, and the curry was the star of the dish. The scallop was cooked beautifully. The seafood flavors were soaked into the curry sauce. Yum! Then we also had butter chicken. The chicken was tender and flavorful. It was a very creamy dish. I asked for a side of rice ($4) to eat with butter chicken. But I was also disappointed that the rice didn't come with the dish directly. The dessert menu only had carrot cake and house made ice cream at this point. We got the cake and it came with the honey saffron ice cream. The carrot cake tasted very freshly of carrots and we loved the saffron ice cream. Overall, the food were fantastic. It was a little pricy for the portion they served.

The breakfast tacos are a small egg omelette wrapped in a mini pancake with bacon  layered on top. The shrimp were well seasoned and tasted great. Everything was out in a reasonable amount of time.

I forgot to ask for it to get grilled, but they charge an extra $0.50 for grilling anyway. Talk about being petty and charging for every darn thing. \\n\\nA sandwich here is $7.95 by default with or without protein. I wish they differentiated the prices.

Chef Tony Maws does a fantastic job of using unconventional ingredients and powerful flavors to make really memorable dishes, and if you reserve early enough you can even snag a table right in front of the kitchen for a really special treat. I had been anticipating my evening at Craigie the entire time I was in Boston, so it was an easy decision for me to do the 10 course tasting menu for $115, and to go ahead and do the 4 drink \\"cocktail whim\\" tasting along with it for just $20. [Note: Photos of each course are uploaded here and Flickr: http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4179871607/in/set-72157622864759653/]\\n\\n#1 - seafood trio of crispy brandade fritter, fresh uni w/ lime pickle vinaigrette, & squid noodles w/ nuoc cham: While these were probably the most simple flavors of the night, each item really showcased its raw characteristics, and I especially liked the fritter. The noodles were also very unique, and the quality of the uni was very high.\\n\\n# 2 - salad of hiramasa sashimi w/ red onion-shiso salsa, avocado, & harissa-rose vinaigrette: The quality of the yellowtail was top-notch and harissa is probably my favorite spice, so this dish was a major hit. The avocado was a nice addition as well, as the creamy texture really mirrored that of the fish, and did a nice job cooling down the harissa heat.\\n\\n# 3 - grilled Nantucket Bay scallops w/ salsa verde, golden raisin-verjus sauce, & curry oil: My third rendition of these scallops in less than a week, and unfortunately these were the least impressive of the three, mainly because of the simplicity compared to the other two. Although, the size of these was slightly greater, but you only get a few, so it doesn't really make up for it. The curry oil was a nice addition though, and they were probably the best cooked scallops of the week.\\n\\n# 4 - red chile & sesame marinated Faroe Island sea trout kama (the shoulder): Wow, this course was absolutely out of this world. If you ever see this on any of the menus here I suggest ordering it, the kama is so delicious and fatty and it just melts off the carcass. The red chile goes great with the fish, neutralizing any overly fishy characteristics this piece would normally have. Freakin awesome!\\n\\n# 5 - lasagnette of house-made rabbit sausage w/ fresh local mozzarella & celery root puree: Another home-run dish. The rabbit flavor in this dish is intense and game-y in a really pleasing way. There was plenty of meat too, and the mozzarella was so gooey and delicious with the rabbit. The presentation of this dish is also interesting and you get a real surprise out of your first bite.\\n\\n# 6 - slow cooked Vermont organic lamb rib w/ burnt caramel vinaigrette & crispy shallots: As you can probably imagine this was another fantastic course, it's obvious Chef Maws is an expert with meats. The lamb was so tender and moist, and the burnt caramel was a delicious rub to put on the rib, I'm definitely going to try this combo back home. I would of course have liked a little more than one big rib, but I'm sure most people are really full by the end of this tasting menu as it is.\\n\\n# 7 - Pain d'Epice crusted Texas sika venison leg w/ venison sausage, red quinoa, autumn olives, quince puree, & fall farm vegetables: Finally, the main event! I was really excited to try this duo of venison, and was not disappointed at all in the execution. The vegetables were nice, but really seemed like an afterthought, especially separated from the meat like they were. The flavors in the venison half however were uber delightful, really taking you straight into the woods. Every ingredient really stood out distinctly, which is hard to do when you've got such a strong game meat as the highlight.\\n\\n# 8 - jasmine tea infused panna cotta w/ candied citrus zest: Like most of the other reviewers, I was a little bummed by this course, and it was the only one I would really have liked to replace. Flavor wise the dish is ok, it just comes across as really underwhelming, and considering there were two other \\"desserts\\" on their way I thought this felt a little unnecessary.\\n\\n# 9 - olive oil & taza chocolate mousse w/ walnut coulis: It looks pretty ugly, but it tastes outstanding. The flavors here mesh so well, and the chocolate is superior quality.\\n\\n# 10 - ancho chile & cardamom spiced Valrhona hot chocolate: A very nice, fitting end to the evening. Never miss a chance to indulge in something simple, yet refined, and always add a bit of spice.\\n\\nAs for the cocktail whim, here were the drinks, in order:\\n\\"Belle de Jour\\" - champagne w/ housemade grenadine\\n\\"Corkscrewdriver\\" - gin & absinthe\\n\\"Communal Rye\\" - whiskey, housemade vermouth, orange\\n\\"Jerez Flip\\" - Oloroso sherry, eggnog, nutmeg\\n\\nThey were all great drinks, especially the Rye. This restaurant exemplifies what I expect from a tasting menu (not a bunch of fru-fru veggies)."},{"name":"Barcelona Inman Park","address":"240 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Enjoyed the vibe, food and service.

Well today I needed to stop by the produce market to get some collard greens to make for Thanksgiving. My best friend and I love to frequent mom n pop diners so we decided to drop in for lunch today.\\n\\nFrom the outside the place is just very plain and if you are not looking, it is easy to drive right on past. As you get near the entrance, the Breakfast and lunch specials are posted on white boards.  We walked inside and the place was virtually empty. To the right is the counter and there are booths throughout the rest of the dining area. The counter and table tops have seen better days and so have many of the seats in the booths. \\n\\nThe menu is HUGE...  Way too many decisions to make for a place that is only open from 6 am until 2 pm. You expect a menu like that in a 24 hour diner but in a place that is basically open for breakfast and lunch it is an overkill of a menu. I looked thru the menu and between the small print and tons of choices, it was simply overwhelming. We ordered coffee and I took a stroll around the place so I could snap off a few pictures. \\n\\nOur server was very pleasant and knew that menu inside and out so I can only assume she's been there a while. I have to admit she really made that place special during my visit. My best friend ordered from the breakfast menu but I chose to try something new since my server raved about the burgers. I chose let her decide what burger to try and it came with a side of Fries and coleslaw. To be honest, I did not feel like trying to read thru their novel of a menu.\\n\\nOur food only took about 15 minutes and my burger looked great. It had bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato and pickles. I added some mayo, mustard and ketchup and as you can see from the pic... It was a nice sized burger. I have to say...  That was one VERY tasty burger! The fries were just your basic frozen french fry and the coleslaw was just your average coleslaw. \\n\\nService - 5\\nMenu - 1 (Print is small and the choices are endless)\\nAtmosphere - 2 (counter/tables/booth seats need some attention and the place is dated)\\nCoffee - 4\\nBurger - 5\\nFries - 3 (Fresh cut fries are always preferred over frozen fries)\\nColeslaw - 3 (Generic slaw mix with some pre-made dressing)\\n\\nThe service was top notch and that burger was great but the dining area is showing its age.

I was hungry and unsure of what I wanted so I ordered an Aloha burger and a Killer taco with Mojo fries.  So apparently with the burger, instead of one fat patty they give you two thinner ones (what Robin A. refers to as a \\"double\\" in her review is actually a single but it comes with two thin patties).  I'm not sure why they do this but it's fine with me.\\n\\nOf course, between the two patties and the large, thick slice of pineapple all well-lubricated by a sizable helping of teriyaki sauce, holding the burger together between the bun became an exercise that was something akin to stacking marbles.  As such, it was pretty easily the messiest burger I've ever eaten -- but again, I'm not complaining.  That's why we have napkins and indoor plumbing.\\n\\nThe taco was equally tasty and will definitely be a part of my next visit.  I did wish it was a little more spicy though.  The menu had mentioned a habanero sauce that covers the Killer taco, and while the sauce was good (and there was some heat to it), it didn't quite live up to the expectations that the description had summoned forth.\\n\\nFinally, the Mojo fries were just different enough to be worthwhile, but since the taco came with some chips (and I had just eaten an entire burger), I felt like maybe I didn't need to order them.

At Raglan Road Irish Pub, you'll possibly pick up a few more Irish sayings and history by the time you decide to leave the food, fun and music. \\n\\nI admit I was kinda skeptical with the Disney-typical faire and prices. I figured any restaurant at Downtown Disney would be quite Epcot-ishly faux worldly. I will also admit I didn't want to go in.

So, in accordance with this thought, I had no trouble deciding what I wanted to eat. MISTAKE!!! First off, $20 ought to get you one heckuva fine quality and quantity of fried fish and french fries. NOPE! For 20 bucks, you get 1, that's o-n-e, fairly small and not so savory piece of fish. And you get a small handful of fries. That's it! For 20 DOLLARS...they deliver this 'dish' in a chrome wire funnel and dump it out on your plate. I think they should have just dumped it out, period.\\n\\nOkay, so here's my renowned overall impression. Great atmosphere and ambiance. Great entertainment. An Irish band of 4 talented musicians aptly played and sang. Very cool. At times, some Irish dancers would kick and swirl on stage in front of the band. And, as promised, that platform in the middle of the dining room? Different dancers would assume the spotlight and dance their hearts out on that small elevated venue.

Maybe I had different expectations, but for a place that boasts healthy options and green choices, I expected a very different bowl than what I received. The Walkers bowl had a shallow bed of undercooked rice, cold salmon fillet, in a dill sauce, pickled red onion, and almonds. No greens, no fresh ingredients, just really unappetizing. \\n\\nThis is also served in a styrofoam to-go box -- even if you're dining in. \\n\\nThis place brands itself to feature healthy choices, but the actual dishes and presentation of the food says otherwise.

No one is rude at all by any means but all of the servers I've had all seem to be very straightforward and give off a very indifferent attitude.\\n\\nAll that to say, I've never had a poor experience either.

I heard how beautiful the restaurant was, but unfortunately I did not hear anything about the food...now i know why.\\n\\nFor anyone who is just as interested in the food as they are the decor I highly suggest reading this review... sorry if its long winded\\n\\nLets start with the good, this place is beautiful. Visual striking in every way. The set up around the bar is a show stopper that I suggest all to visit at some point, but what ever you do, unless you don't care about money or taste, never venture outside this bar area and never enter this restaurant hungry.\\n\\nI will try to keep this as short, but no promises. To prequalify my rating, I spent nearly 10 years working in multiple different front and back of house positions in high end restaurants throughout New England. I am more than willing to spend too much money on a delicious dinner as it is probably my favorite indulgence, but this restaurant was more reminiscent to paying for internal stomach and taste bud bondage, actually some people like that stuff, so lets call it culinary torture. \\n\\nThe drinks were pretty good but at $14 a pop I expect something that at least approaches Eastern Standard's level of quality, not slightly better than Clerys. Stick with the over priced beer, at least they can't mess that up, wait one of my cocktail's glass was slightly warm, so yes, this place can mess anything up.\\n\\nAs for the food, the rolls in the bread basket were amazing. The butter on the table was at a perfect temperature, which is normally an oversight, and it really set the stage. That roll was the only thing I enjoyed eating the entire night.\\n\\nWe had a large group, but we kept the ordering simple enough. We went with the dumplings, tuna tartare and a few other apps. Also a few of us ordered steaks and the halibut.\\n\\nEverything lacked seasoning. Literally, the $50 Filet my girlfriend ordered had nothing on it and was so dry, I would of much preferred some road side hillbilly gas station homemade jerky. They served it with the \\"speciality\\" demi, again no salt, very little taste, WHAT a disappointment.... and this was the best dish of the night. \\n\\nThe dumplings:  way to much wrapping, no seasoning again, and the sauce was garbage. At $25 for 8 small dumplings I expected a wow factor, instead I ate the culinary equivalent of watching anything involving a \\"real housewife\\" on tv. You will do it if someone makes you or stuck on a plane without other options, but by no means do you want to repeat the experience or pay a fortune for it. \\n\\nNow to the Halibut, or should I say one of the worst dishes I have ever paid for. With a $36 dollar price tag, u expect amazing. When the dish came, I was immediately amazed, a 3-4 oz portion, I have literally had tasting menu portions larger. But I'm cool with it if its amazing, yet again no salt, drastically over cooked and dry, and the only word I can use to explain it was \\"blah\\". But it gets so, so, so much worse. The dish came with some clams. Considering Boston's location, no chef should ever send out a mediocre clam. Well, long john silvers in Akron Ohio, does clams more justice than this place. Three people got the Halibut at my table, three people spit their clams into their napkins. Horrible, but what comes next is even worse. When we told a manager(might not been a manager, but he worked there and was wearing a full suit) that we think the clams went bad, he just shrugged it off and said okay I'll tell the chef. That's it. Didn't take the plate, didn't offer condolences, nothing. Theres the wow factor I was looking, unfortunately it was negative not positive.\\n\\nSo if you like to spend a crap ton of your hard earned money for horrible food, by all means go to LAH, otherwise, stick to the bar. \\n\\nWhat a shame...SMH"},{"name":"On On Wonton House","address":"5640 Kingsway","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3","text":"We've stopped here before... we were introduced to this place many years ago by a fellow Lion's Club member... we came here on the weekend, we were given tea and menus, and we kept trying to get the waiter's attention and she just kept walking by... wouldn't even look up even after the both of us kept calling for her... we ended up just walking out. \\n\\nthe time before this, we stopped in and the service wasn't much better...

First off, Cannoli is still excellent. I would like to say that the pizza has gone steadily downhill for me. So much so that I trashed most of my pizza this past Saturday. The sauce, which is normally delicious by the way, was so watery that my pizza was dripping wet. I ate a piece the second I got in the car, no will power to wait until I got home, and I was barely able to pick up a slice with out all the cheese sliding off due to the excessive wateriness of the sauce ( is wateriness a word?) The pizza was decent but way too wet- as I said before. I kept the box open so the pizza wouldn't steam as I drove and I watched rivulets of sauce pour off the pizza all over the box. There was so much running off I was worried the box would be breached and tomato juice would be all over my seat. I got home and looked at the pizza. It looked unappetizing as hell. I probably could have baked it for awhile to get that sauce to dissipate but the thin crust had soaked up so much that nuking the pizza probably wouldn't have helped so I trashed it.

After being there for 5 minutes one of the two hostesses asked us to move to the bar area.  Well, the bar area was overflowing so back outside into the cold.\\n\\nFinally we were seated at 8:15, a wait of more than 1:15, standing up the whole time.  The hostess explained that they had some guests who didn't leave, but guess what, it's Saturday night and that shouldn't be a surprise.  \\n\\nThe waitress was nice and I told her about the situation (pleasantly, it obviously wasn't her fault), and she took a couple of drinks off the bill without me asking, which was appreciated.

However, they should have had a manager talk to the waiting folks, as the hostesses were frazzled.  \\n\\nThe rating for this one is hard.

Since it was my birthday and it was all about me, I made everyone do the 6 course tasting menu. \\nOur very knowledgeable waiter questioned us on our likes, dislikes to see if we \\"qualified\\" for the meal. ooh, the pressure!!  Happily, we qualified and I could breath a sigh of relief. \\nThe waiter made it sound like they created a menu based on what you liked/disliked on the fly, but it was more like they had the menu set and if your dislike was an ingredient, then they would modify the pre-defined dish. \\nOur waiter was so helpful picking out wine, I can't stress enough how perfect the service was. It was fine dining service without the snootiness, as was the atmosphere. You have a view of the kitchen from almost everywhere in the dining room. I would love to sit at the bar around the kitchen to watch them actually cook up close. And it was a really quiet kitchen too which was interesting. \\nEvery course was delivered and placed in front of you at the same time.  A new person would describe each course, but for some weird reason, I could never remember what they said as soon as they left. 'What was that? what did they say that was??' but who cares, it was all pretty good. This is what I remember, not that it matters because the menu changes all the time, but it will give you an idea of what to expect. \\n\\nFirst course was a trio of something that I think was pickled (this was one of my fav's of the night as well as everyone elses), a smoked salmon and then a blue fish rillette with a cheese crisp\\nSecond was fried clams with squid ink and OMG the clams were THE best I've ever had. so lightly fried and the clams were so tender. I haven't eaten very many before but the ones I've had in the past were a little chewy and these were NOTHING like that. If that's the how they should be, then I declare myself a clam fan!\\nThird was a european trout that was pink, it looked like salmon and it was sooo perfectly cooked, tender and moist. I loved mine, but my sister didn't care for hers and after we were done, they descended on our table, asking if there was a problem or there was something she didn't like about it. I like how they seemed genuinly concerened but didn't make you feel weird about it. I got the feeling that if she said she really didn't like it, they would have made her something else. \\nFourth was rye pasta with venison and mushrooms. That was my first venison and it was not at all what I was imagining, very tender and the parmesan on top was yummy\\nFifth was pork 3 ways with some kind of jam. I wasn't blown away by it, I liked the suckling pig, but I wasn't in love with the rib or the pork belly. We also tried the bone marrow, not a fan, but I wanted to try it just to try it. I didn't like the gelatinous texture nor did I like the flavor. But holy crap, apparently lots of people like it cause almost every table had one. In fact, a couple next to us had ordered two of them and were going to town.\\nThen came the sweet & savory palette cleanser, mellon sorbet with cheese, which I was thankful for, marrow be gone!\\nLast course was 4 different desserts with a bday candle. I loved that they did a variety. We had a peach thing with cheese that my sister mistook for ice cream (that was funny since the cheese was kinda tart), small square chocolate/mousse squares, a berry pie with ice cream (amazing crust, could've done without the mint) and an ice cream in espresso with some kind of coconut.\\nOh, and I forgot to mention, that the owner came over to our table when they dropped off the 5th course and described our entree.

We like beer, and we were able to walk to this bar, so it was a pretty nice spot for a nightcap.\\n\\nWe arrived around 11 on the Sunday night of a long weekend, and the place was already emptying out. I guess it closes at midnight on Sundays, which, I guess, is fair enough. We got a small table for two near the bar, and we got table service. The bar was cozy, a little tight even, but we had a relaxing time. We squeezed in two rounds of beer.\\n\\nThe selection was fantastic, with dozens of beers on tap. I had a Monday Night Bed Head Imperial Coffee IPA and an Orpheus Transmigration of Souls, which was a strong double IPA. My husband had the Orpheus Peace.War.Truth.Lie and the 21st Amendment Brew Free or Die IPA. We like IPAs, apparently, and all four of these were top notch.\\n\\nWe didn't get to spend much waking time in Little Five Points this trip, but coming from L.A., I liked this little hipster part of town.

We dined in on a Sunday evening and there were plenty of seats available.\\n\\nAs soon as we got our food our excitement diminished. The takoyaki was okay. The pan fried gyozas did not taste fresh. It was as if it were frozen and dropped in a fryer. The ramen is where it gets really disappointing. The broth was not good. My friend said his broth (paitan) tasted like canned chicken noodle soup, and my broth (veggie) tasted like hot water and spicy oil. When it comes to ramen you need to nail the broth because it brings the whole dish together. I usually eat an entire bowl of ramen and lick the bowl clean (kidding), but I only ate half and couldn't have anymore.\\n\\n1 star for the very polite waitress, however she disappeared for 10 minutes when we were trying to get our check.

However, one time after a visit for some minor adjustments I discovered cracks in the top tube that clearly looked to have been caused by someone clamping it. The guys in the shop and manager agreed that someone had clamped it - they just refused to admit it was anyone in their shop. One of them went so far as to insist I had taken it elsewhere, despite me clearly stating I hadn't - ever. I eventually got a replacement frame from the manufacturer through the shop, but it took months, and at least a dozen calls. They moved the parts from the busted frame to the new one, but the shifting was all messed up afterwards, the chain started coming off, etc. I was told by one shop that these were symptoms of sloppy work. Also, the snarky, snobbish attitude displayed by some in the shop (including the manager) was truly remarkable. Long story short, this was the worst retail experience of my life.

My sandwich can on a soft bun filled with tender beef onions,peppers,mushrooms and drippy succlant house made whiz. Simply divine. I left full and satisfied.

We loved the Clintonville restaurant as it offered a great place for our now 9-month old to explore and look around at the beautiful interior design. In fact, Little Eater was the first restaurant my wife, son and I all went together to since his debut on the planet - and it was particularly exciting because we hadn't been out in weeks! Years before that, my wife introduced me to this restaurant, and I remember I wasn't sure how much I would like it - I didn't really get the whole scoops idea as a selling point, but I am certainly glad she convinced me to go. The menu is fairly simple, but to really know it and appreciate it, you have to start trying different things and watch them come together made to satisfy all of your senses. I have yet to find a quiche that has such a delightful, flaky, but not too doughy crust. The black bean soup is so satisfying, you will never want a canned black bean again. The baked goods are extremely flavorful, without coming with any guilt or regret from too much sugar and processing. I know the vegetarian-only menu can be a hard sell to those who regularly consume meat, but I thank Little Eater for being specific about their food goals, even if that risks drawing from a smaller pool of customers. Everything about this store is conscious-living, from choosing to provide food from local vendors, to providing unique, healthy, and wonderfully made recipes. It is unfortunate this restaurant is no longer available for regular service in Clintonville, because that is where we frequented it the most. I am sure we will still make it our to North Market, but the memories I have from the Clintonville place are special.

As someone who prefers the drier, (sometimes) cleaner style of Texas BBQ over sloppy Kansas City BBQ, this place is a great find on par with a glorified BBQ shack on the outskirts of San Antonio or the mom-and-pop BBQ joint in Houston.  What piqued my interest was the aroma outside as I drove by to another store.  Musty, complex, meaty.  The next day, I took my family of four to try this new restaurant out.\\n\\nAt 6pm on a Saturday, the restaurant was about a quarter full.  Reception and wait staff were responsive and friendly.  I believe the menus (adult and child) and wall art needed improvement - but that isn't what I was there for.  What I was there for did not disappoint... at all.\\n\\nMy wife had pulled pork with Texas Caviar, both of which were very tasty.  The pulled pork was on the upper end of acid-digested (little stringiness) and moisture-soaked for my preference, but it was still in the top 10% overall.  The TX caviar was very interesting, unique, and tasty surprise.\\n\\nI had the x4 beef ribs with house fries and potato salad.  When the plate was sat in front of me, I knew that Paulo's served Texas-sized proportions.  The potato salad was more Portland-gourmet than Texan, but still very tasty.  The house fries were real, as opposed to the plasticized, rigid fried of fast food stores.  But the ribs... as anyone who has prepared beef ribs knows, there is a hefty challenge in preparing them correctly.  The tenderness was exceptional, the dry rub was spot-on, and the sauce glaze was light and complimentary (instead of overpowering).  The jalapeno cornbread tasted like the a recipe straight from Austin.\\n\\nMy kids had the mac and cheese, which was on par with a more gormet style, but it did require additional salting to bring the rich flavor out.\\n\\nWith the remainders of our large dinner stowed in Chinese takeout-style boxes, we thoroughly enjoyed a shared slice of sweet potato pie.  The cinnimon flavor balance was fantastic and the crust was firm and flaky.\\n\\nWhen I don't want to take hours to dry rub, mesquite-smoke, and sauce it my own backyard - this is the best place for Texas style BBQ in Portland for my money."},{"name":"Sea Thai","address":"3812 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We've been to this restaurant before but haven't been here in a while and noticed the decor had changed.

I ordered a rib dinner with Mac and cheese and baked beans. The Mac and cheese was extremely bland (ironically) and lacked the consistency you expect from typical baked Mac and cheese.

For noms, we got an order of the large calamari and the house special with fracomo sauce. The calamari was super crispy but other than that, there was not much flavor to it. I'd recommend skipping appetizers anyways if you're going to get the fra daviola. The fra daviola house special is a large seafood pasta dish filled with mussels, scallops, shrimp, calamari, clams, and one whole lobster. It is meant to be shared with two but if you're sharing it with more, the restaurant charges an extra $10 per person. My brother and I are big eaters and we were barely able to finish. Almost every table around us ordered the same dish and I don't believe anyone else cleared their plate so I'd recommend coming with 3 people and paying the third person fee. I appreciate that the dish was packed with seafood and not just pasta. The sauce was a little watery but it was the perfect amount of spicy. The best part was that the dish was $60 for two people!!

I went there tonight and was served a Molcajete dish in a plastic bowl, that was supposed to look like an actual molcajete.  They didn't used to do this.  The tortillas were cold and stuck together, only to rip apart when trying to separate them.  It's like they just grabbed a pile out the microwave, slapped it on a plate and served it to me.  Additionally, the seafood molcajete used to be a thick flavorful dish.  This molcajete was watery tomato juice with some baby scallops.  I was still hungry and decided not to try to grab a half ripped tortilla and fill it with cold tomato juice and scallops.  That's not what I ordered.\\n\\nI spoke to a manager and he said hat it was temporary to have the plastic molcajete.  Well, why are the tortillas sticking together when that has never happened?

I don't want your free drinks, I want to know if I'm going to even come back here next time, I'm trying to figure out if this is a place I need to drop from my list.\\n\\nTruth is, this place is cutting costs and the quality is dropping.

We ordered some of each and we loved the Continental (pepperoni, Italian sausage, ham and bacon) and Coup de Ville (BBQ chicken).  They also have salads and pasta on the menu as well as cinnamon knots for dessert.\\n\\nThe retro vibe continues to the drink menu where they feature at least five types of root beer, Yoohoo and Coke in glass bottles.  They are still in the process of getting their liquor license, but will eventually serve beer.  The dining room is still under construction and should open in about a week with custom-made booths and stools that will remind you of your favorite soda shop.\\n\\nAs you can tell, I fell completely in love with the spirit and style of this place and the excitement of the owners who are living their dream.  The pizza on its own merits is at least a four.  It is closer to what you will experience at Escape from New York than Apizza Scholls.  But here you probably won't experience the attitude (which my family loves at EFNY) or the long lines.  You should factor in some extra time to check out the hot rods in the parking lot while snapping bubbles with Bazooka gum.  \\n\\n\\"The car is Auto-matic. Its System-matic. Its Hyyyyydro-matic.

The squid ink pasta was an absolute mess, and was probably one of the worst dishes I have had at a restaurant in a while. If I had to be blunt, I would say it looked and tasted like burnt spaghetti noodles chopped up into little pieces, with an odd fishy taste and chewy squid rings. The chorizo and fig was way to salty, and tasted like it had a whole bottle of vinegar in it. One of the other very bad dishes was the blood sausage, this is something I usually like, but in this case it had a very mushy texture and a horribly off taste.

This is a locally owned establishment and the owner, Greg, bought it from the Davidsons, if I remember correctly, back in the 90s.  He has maintained the local charm by still providing home cooked meals, soups and baked goods at an affordable price.  Greg is very friendly and his welcoming approach is reflected in his servers and staff. \\nManyservers have been long-term employees, a sign that the restaurant has been well-managed as employee turnover in small places like Davidsons is usually high.

My wife had an omelet which was piping hot and also much more than she could eat.  My meal included a cornmeal muffin which also came fresh from the oven and was delicious.

The cleaning staff was also accommodating and was friendly providing fresh towels and sheets even after they had previously cleaned.

Another issue was that there were not enough outlets to charge my devices and there wasn't adequate lighting period. Also, I don't recall coming across a gym, but that couldn't been an overlook. \\n\\nOne thing I didn't like about this hotel is that the bar was in the lobby and it gave the hotel a social feel but it also was just ugly on the eyes.

I don't care which location you go to.  The sandwiches fill a need when money is tight or convenience means everything.  That being said here are a few tips to help enhance your Subway dining experience.\\n\\nBring an imaginary friend and order two $5 footlongs.  Carefully unwrap the second sandwich for your imaginary friend, then unwrap yours and enjoy.  After a minute or two start shouting out loud to your imaginary friend that he or she should be grateful for the sandwich and that Jared would appreciate such a nice gesture.  The staff may or may not offer you a free cookie to shut you up.  Be prepared to never eat at that particular location again.  Don't worry.  There are many other locations you will be able to go to.  I do recommend not pulling this stunt at each one.  \\n\\nSo there are better ways to enhance the experience.  One of my personal favs is getting a meatball with pepperoni.  I had been doing this one way before they decided to add it as a menu item.  I also enjoy requesting a little marinara on my Spicy Italian or Italian B.M.T. (Biggest, Meatiest, Tastiest, if you've ever wondered but were too ashamed to ask).  I suggest staying away from the chicken, the steak, and the seafood whatever.  I have been burned each time and do not want to relive the experience.\\n\\nAside from the meats and cheeses, all the other items are included and you CAN ask for a little extra to be added.  Don't settle for five tiny olive slices on your foot long.  Ask for more until you are satisfied.  \\n\\nA hui hou!"},{"name":"Stats","address":"300 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Was here just over a week ago with a large group before a wedding.

Yes there are other pizza places with delicious pizza, but Antico is the original spot for some of the best pizza in the city. There is street parking, parking in the back and parking in a side lot by the gelateria dubbed \\"Little Italy\\". \\n\\nThe dining process has largely remained the same over the year, come on in (BYOB if desired), order a pizza and find some seats. Self seating can be overwhelming for some, but a solid backup is to head across the street to eat outside at the gelato shop (even better on nice days). Seating inside is basically IN the kitchen, which is super cool, but also can get super loud a peak times. TIP: before your pizza arrives, grab some parmesan, spicy peppers, garlic and olive oil by the pizza prep area.\\n\\nFOOD TIME. When each order is ready someone walks around shouting the order number, so keep a watch for yours. Usually the wait is really short as these pizzas cook super fast in the massive pizza ovens.\\nAntico pizza is a magical combination of crispy outer crust and chewy inner dough. The consistency of the dough is PERFECT! I like my crust almost burnt, which is how Antico cooks their pizza. Grab some forks and knives, it's ok to use these as it can get quite messy otherwise.\\n\\nI started off ordered the Diavola (because I love spicy), but switched my allegiance to the San Gennaro, which has meatballs and sweet peppers. I always grab some peppers from the back (same peppers that come on the Diavola), so you can make any pizza spicy! I have tried pretty much every pizza on the menu and you really can't go wrong here.\\n\\nCons: It can get a bit loud at peak times and it can get a bit crowed as well. It's nice that you can BYOB, but often we feel a bit rushed to get out because there are so many people waiting to snag some seats. I recommend trying Antico on a weekday evening instead of weekend for a calmer experience or ask them to bring it to you across the street at \\"Little Italy\\"."},{"name":"Nantucket Shrimp Shack","address":"7675 West Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4.5","text":"The boom boom shrimp was awesome!

The first thing he asked while I was helping him book his upcoming trip was: are we going to that place far away where they cook the meat in the ground all day?! Yes dad, yes we are.\\n\\nIt's probably best to put this review in perspective: my Hispanic family does not eat out. Ever. When I go visit home, there's not a scratch of outside-prepared food in sight. However, when my parents visit Austin individually, their personalities change. My accented dad wants to know where we're GOING, not what we're EATING. He becomes a ramblin' man, with no place to call home, needing to be out and about. Well alright.\\n\\nOut we go. We'd all reached the I'm-getting-pretty-hungry level about 6pm one evening, the day we'd planned on the Salt Lick. We warn my dad it's a ways away, and he was up for the adventure.\\n\\n\\"Is far? 40 minute? Tha's okay to me! What else an gonna do?\\"\\n\\nWe told him it's BYOB, and he immediately knows what to bring. \\"Is good Dej!\\" he proclaims about his beloved Manischewitz. Ok dad :)\\n\\nAbout 30 minutes into the drive, I believe my dad's status changed to I'm-hungry-and-this-better-be-good. The car got quiet, and I could sense his desperation when we reached the end of Mopac and he asked how far we were. This part's my fault: I always think it's just down the road once you T at Mopac. It is not just down the road.\\n\\nBy the time we rolled in, my dad was looking nervous, and his eyes were bugging out. I was worried. When they told us the wait was 40 minutes, we had to catch my dad as he became faint.\\n\\n\\"Oh Dej, what we gonna do now?\\" he pleaded. Except there really aren't any options around. So he miserably paced, maniacally giggling every now and then. \\"Wow, I can(t) believe we drive so far to suffer in a restaurant.\\" I'm sorry dad, I said, and I assured him it was pretty good - right? isn't it good? I asked SO. Yes yes, it's really good.\\n\\nWe're finally seated. We ordered our meals. The food came out 3 minutes later. I couldn't find my father in the flurry of bones and food that flew from his general direction. In 5 minutes, nothing remained on his plate, and his Manischewitz bottle was down by half. The beans, prepared unlike what we eat at home, and the coleslaw were gone. He looked delirious. We ordered dessert to go.\\n\\nIn the car, dad was verklempt. \\"WOW Dej! Tha(t) place is COOL! The ribs were good like WOW! Man I like the old wood. Wow. An gonna tell your mom about this place. WOW! You getta bring her here when she visit. Wow. Oh man. Tha(t) was good. They don't getta place like this in New Jersey. Wow.\\" I could already tell he was going to get himself in a world of hurt telling mom (who's ribs are perfection) about how great the food was.\\n\\nI whipped around and handed him a spoon with blackberry cobbler. He gobbled it up and said \\"Dej, they leave the bone in this one.\\" I don't think my dad had ever had blackberry dessert.

After a whole week without carbs, I was greatly looking forward for some beers and food.  The first thing I noticed was they did not use the space they have wisely.  If appears as if you are eating in a warehouse with a few pictures scattered on the wall.  But I was even more upset with the menu and the service.  There are a lot of different options on the menu, but no theme.,  For example, if you offer burgers, do something special with them.  After mulling over the menu for a long time, I went with the ribs.  Big mistake.  Things went all too familar when I found out that Tanners Tavern from Wobun owns this place.  Their ribs are not good as well.  It took forever for us to get our drinks, and at one point I even went up to the bar because we did not see our waitress for some time.  The worst part of the night came when the bill arrived.  WAY too much money for a night that I would have rather have back.  Now usually I am not picky, I like Unos in Woburn, Chilis in Reading and Wilmington and the Tavern In The Square in Cambridge, Alston and Salem.

This place is along the same lines as the Thai version of Panda Inn.\\n\\nTwo dishes that can be ordered at any good Thai restaurant will give you a good metric of the quality of the cuisine are yum pladook foo (catfish salad) and yum nua (beef salad).  The former is difficult to prepare as it involves catfish that must be steamed, next the meat must be separated from the bone, and, finally it must be fried into a puff-like consistency.  Typically, it is garnished with a combination of fish sauce, lime juice, brown sugar, and green mango.  If this is done well, it is a mark of an excellent kitchen.   The beef salad here was insipid not the hallmark of a cuisine known for being hot, sour, salty, and sweet.

The sides are not awesome in my opinion.  The beans taste like they are straight out of a Ranch Style Beans can with that heavy sauce and tang.  No thanks.  The slaw is a Southern vinegary slaw.  I like it OK, but not my favorite.  The potatoes are almost a mix between mashed potatoes and potato salad.  Again, not bad, just kind of a weird texture.  My point is that the meat for the most part is great, but don't waste a lot of room on the mediocre sides.  I love their building and Texas decor.  It is a sprawling restaurant with inside and outside seating and some live music.  The service is good, so make a trip out there!  Just bring cash and beer.  ;-)"},{"name":"Chambar","address":"568 Beatty Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Excellent ambiance!

Upon arrival the waiter gave us restaurant menus and a specials menu. It was extremely dark and nothing was explained. Although there were electric candles on every table I could barley see my own hands lol. When they waiter arrived he was below sub par. I mean he did even ask if we wanted to start with something to drink or an appetizer. He said very dryly \\" ready to order\\". As a former waitress for these prices I would expect an introduction or something smh. When the food arrived we took photos and the waiter came by not to ask how everything was but to scold us by saying \\"your still taking photos!\\" Before disappearing back into the dark restaurant. After one bite I realized my steak was actually over the temperature I requested. When he came back to his section to clean off another table I got his attention. He went back and forth with me saying that I was wrong and my steak was in fact medium rare. I explained it was not and could he check with the kitchen. He told me they can't do anything about it. After about a minute of this exchange he finally took my plate. When he returned with out my plate he still insisted that my steak was in fact cooked properly. I explained it was not to my liking. He asked did I want a medium steak I assured him no I wanted a medium rare steak. He then said I was mistaken and I must have wanted it rare. Yes I know ridiculous right. I just stared at him in disbelief and he informed me he was going to get a manager. As soon as the manager arrived he asked me how he could help. I informed him I wanted a medium rare steak. He immediately said no problem. The manager delivered the steak and disappeared. He did not wait for me to cut it open and see the temperature. When I did I could barely slice it with a steak knife because it was RARE. I just ate the edges the best I could. Not to mention the green beans were bland but the crispy onions strings were a nice touch. The cut of strip steak was not quality either so it was overpriced indeed. I will not ever return to this restaurant or recommend it to anyone.

This place looks straight-up WEIRD from the outside. Sea Thai is not the most inviting name I've heard and, when blasted on the front of a strip mall with red and blue block letters, it is sure to get passed by me every time. But it shouldn't. My roommate mentioned that it was pretty good, and when we had some friends in town, we decided to give it a whirl. Upon pulling up I noticed that what I thought were weird black out windows were in fact windows completely covered in award banners for all the local nods Sea Thai has gotten in recent years. OK... I guess I misjudged this place!\\n\\nI was surprised to enter and find a low-lit, dare I say, swanky, dining room with white tablecloths and comfy booths. We were seated at a larger table and, as I perused the HUGE menu, I realized this was probably going to be a great meal. Their selections range from the very traditional to the interesting and experimental. I've never been a huge curry fan, but it's something that I really WANT to like, so I continually order it in hopes I will be converted. I love duck, so when I saw a Duck and Pineapple Curry I knew I wanted to try it. I skimmed over the rest of the menu just to be sure, but there was no way I wasn't ordering a dish that interesting. \\n\\nOur food came out looking awesome all around. Servings are huge, and I will probably go for a split in the future unless I'm planning on a ton of leftovers. My curry was AMAZING!!! It was my first time trying a red curry, so that could just be my favorite kind, but I also think the credit goes to Sea Thai's preparation. The duck was cooked to a crispy perfection and blended perfectly with the creamy red curry, fresh pepper slices, and juicy hot pineapple chunks. What a unique flavor combination! Everyone around the table was left with a positive and tasty impression as well. I took home over half of my boat of curry, and it made for a delicious lunch the next day.

Next was the day's special fish - dover sole stuffed with a scallop stuffing with mixed vegetables $24.  We were sharing all the dishes, which was good since our 2nd entree - the chicken al mattone served with pesto linguine $19 - we had been warned, would take longer.  It also made for a more well rounded meal on both our parts as we had both vegetables and pasta as well as seafood and fowl.\\n\\nThe stuffing was generous.  If only the fillets were as well - they should have been thicker cut, for as they were, they were hardly there.  The vegetables were vibrant and tasty, but a tad on the side of being overcooked.  I prefer some bite to my vegetables, which is quite rare in the world.\\n\\nThe chicken arrived as a breast and a thigh.  As a dark meat person, I found my piece to be crispy skin over moist meat.  However, I did have a bite of the larger white meat chunk, and unfortunately that taste was rather dry.  The linguine was al dente noodles, well doused with creamy pesto and a very good portion.\\n\\nThe Nutella bread pudding $7, served a la mode, was a bit depressing in presentation as it was both short and smushed.  Rather than being warm and crusty on the outside while custardy on the inside, it was served at a single note room temperature.  Sure, it had a good flavor, but it was rather mushy.  The tiramisu $7, on the other hand, was served slightly chilled, a rather good sized rectangle, and rather good.  My DC preferred the tiramisu due to the consistency and the temperature, and I heartily agreed.\\n\\nThe single unisex bathroom was large and handicap accessible, but the light was slow in brightening.  I noticed a pair of high chairs and a booster seat stored there.  However, there is a single step to get past first at the front door.\\n\\nI spotted a neighbor being served the BUTTERNUT SQUASH RAVIOLI $17 (Fresh sage butter sauce, sundried tomatoes and fresh vegetables).  The fresh vegetables were the same as was served besides our fish dish. it looked colorful and relatively healthy.

I ordered three tacos: chorizo and egg ($1.50), chicken fajita ($2), and pastor taco ($2).  You're given a choice of flour or corn tortilla.  \\n\\nThe chorizo and egg was great. I was pleasantly surprised that cheese was included.  The egg was fluffy and there was just the right amount of chorizo to add flavor but not make it too greasy.  I order this with a flour tortilla and it had clearly been heated/cooked as well.  It tasted fresh made, but I can't be sure. Very delicious.\\n\\nThe chicken and pastor tacos were prepared in authentic Mexican street style: small pieces of meat with only cilantro, onions, and an optional spicy salsa.  The chicken was flavorful and moist.  The pastor seemed a little overcooked and lacking deep flavor; it didn't seem much like the stewed pastor I'm used to, so it's possible there was a mistake and I got the wrong taco. Regardless of what it was, there wasn't enough flavor for me to want to order another in the future.\\n\\nThe woman in the trailer was nice and I thought the food overall was great for the price.

He asked if we had questions, and when we did ask, he patiently explained everything to us. He told us the menu is designed to get people to try new things but still offer the basics. For example, the skirt steak is served with ox tail, pork loin is with sweetbread, etc. I can't tell if Craigie's either love pigs so much that everything they have is pig or they dislike pigs so much that they want to eat them all. Haha.\\n\\nThe server also recommended that if anyone is doing the Tasting menu, then everyone at the table should do the same. Instead, we opted for the Pri-Fixe. After 15 minutes or so, I finally decided what i wanted to try. But then the server comes back to let us know my chicken entree has been sold-out. So after a few more minutes, I chose my food. For appetizer, we tried the rigatoni, potage of potato and watercress and rabbit sausage with pig's blood. For entrees, we got the skirt steak, pork loin and the Pig's Head.

Nice area with a huge outdoor patio/lawn and tons of parking.  I'd say The BRewer's Table feels more like a farm than a restaurant upon driving up, but inside is classy and communal with 2 bar areas/chef tables and tons of circular tables.  Upstairs dining available as well for larger groups, it seems.\\n\\nFor food, I came alone so didn't partake in the large format, but I do believe it exists (wasn't shown on the menu though, so who knows).  Menu very small with dip, salad, bread, burger, rib, and few other smaller dishes.  Everything tiny and sharable and requires 2 per person.  Had the pork ribs and the dip.  Pork ribs came with 4 but perfectly marinated and not overly wet.  Loved the pickled veggies on the side to add some sourness to the plate.  Ribs cooked great and filled me up.  The sweet potato dip was a must starter.  So much mashed sweet potato and some crunchiness in the plate with broccoli and bread.  Bread tasted a bit stale but even eating the sweet potato itself was worth an order.\\n\\nFor beer, their own beers were weird in all honestly.  Basil, beets, and other un-beerly ingredients.  But if you want more traditional, they also have about 20 other guest beers and most at $6-7 which is super affordable for a place like this.  Some cocktails available and wine, but I would stick to the beer here.\\n\\nWhole restaurant is beer-focused.  Cocktails contain beer elements, food is cooked with beer yeast or the like, and they brew their own out back.  Really great spot for just drinking or a nice date-night.

What's between the bun: an egg souffl√© square topped with your choice of ham or bacon, cheddar, arugula, and tomato, dressed with some dijonnaise. (One should always choose bacon just on general principle.) Unfortunately, when I saw the freshly baked bun (which itself was quite nice), I knew the texture of the bun wouldn't hold up to its contents, and indeed it didn't, creating a bit of a mess from bite to bite and making for some interesting maneuvering to keep everything from falling apart. The dressing had a bit of a flavor edge that I didn't think melded well with the rest of the ingredients, and the egg souffl√©, while fluffy, had a texture that seemed more knife-and-fork to me, so while this is a hearty (if messy) sandwich that will keep you feeling full for hours, I can't say that I'd order it again.\\n\\nThe cold brew coffee is great - strong and balanced. Throw a little cream in and you have yourself a nice mellow mid-day caffeine pick-me-up.\\n\\nThis place is hopping, especially around the lunch hour, so go a little early or a little late so you can find seating and not have to deal with the crowd of people up front waiting for their order.

The food menu we had was not even two weeks old yet and some of the items mentioned in previous reviews here were not to be seen.  The 1 dollar Fenway Franks were there though, as I think that might be how this place catches on this summer.\\n\\nIt was odd being in this space for the first time since the Deli Haus closed it's doors so many years ago.  It's much smaller than it's predecessor and we've got a much classier vibe going on.  The place is dressed up a bit but it feels like it's more than ready to get some dirt under its nails.\\n\\nI'm hoping good things for this place.  The menu is good, if a bit pricey -- but you're getting big portions.  The burger is ten bucks but your getting a half pound of meat and you can add bacon and guacamole for no extra charge -- and that comes with fries or your choice of four or five other sides.  Not too shabby.  And for the area it's not a bad deal.  Actually, it's the only place in the area where I feel comfortable sitting down to a burger and a beer.\\n\\nAs for the beer menu, the taps are the way to go.  Seems there's a reason they call themselves a tap room.  The bottled beer selection is top notch, but too pricey buy a dollar or two.  If you get up to the 22 ounce bottles it may be worth it, and then there's always the 40 ouncers (Black Label, Mickey's, Private Stock, and Schaefer if I'm not mistaken) that they are \\"Proud to Pour\\".\\n\\nThe staff was eager to please -- our waiter was attentive and happy to answer some of our nagging questions.  Like, why the bread on the club sandwich tasted like french toast.  The answer of course being, well, they used to have a french toast sandwich (see previous positive review of this item) and their still working out the kinks in finding a steady menu.  He had us wanting to leave him a good size tip, which really is the sign of a good waiter.\\n\\nSo good luck Lower Depths (still don't like the name, tho), I have a good feeling about you.  I know I'll be stopping by again when I'm in the neighborhood.  You having Leatherlips on tap and all...\\n\\nUPDATE: (5/9/07) So I was over here the other day and the menu had changed yet again -- different dishes and sandwiches and everything was a dollar or two cheaper.  A finicky friend of mine swears by the steak tips on this new menu.  Also, they do have service going on for their three or four tables outside but do to some lame MA law service out there ends at 10pm or so.  Still four stars.  Still good food, drink and service.\\n\\nOh!  and they're starting up the old Bukowski's drinky card club.

A large extensive list of wines and tapas that threw off our group! It was an experience unlike any other. I recommend setting up a reservation to save you time waiting for a table. Just make sure everyone in your party is present by the time the table is ready' \\n\\nService: it was packed and incredibly busy for a Saturday night. I made reservations literally 2hrs prior and managed to get a decent time! Our server worked hard to try and check up on us even with a full house. She did her best to talk over the crowd and explain some of the wines to us and give suggestions. She didn't check up on us too much since we were a very low maintenance table, but every now and then she would come over to make sure our water was filled up. \\n\\nFood/Wine: tapas were delicious! The Chorizo was sweet and savory. We actually dipped our bread into the sauce since it tasted like jam. The Eggplant was nicely cooked and a good bit given. It tasted more savory than it did spicy. We also got Calamari that had a mix between squid rings/legs. With just 3 tapas and a wine each, we were pretty satisfied. \\nNow, we had a general idea of what wine we wanted before heading to this place, but once we saw the menu we were completely thrown off. We all decided to take the chance and try a wine we've never had before. \\n* 2017 Muscat Blend was semi-sweet with a slight fizz to it \\n* 2016 Petit Manseng Blend was dry and crisps with a slight sweetness \\n* 2016 Riesling was the sweetest and fruitiest of the 3 \\n\\n4/5 - because it was incredibly loud inside the restaurant.

There was a larger group that was already seated and they seem to be enjoying themselves...especially the kids. Our server seemed a bit inexperienced but my husband and I are understanding people and we can overlook that-we all aren't great at everything in the beginning. Before our meal came, the server gave us a paper plate with a bib, 2 gloves, a fork, nutcracker and a smaller fork.

After the group left, the servers separated and wiped down the smaller tables that made it possible to have one big communal table. My husband and I were seated at a table in that row (so instead of the \\"one long table\\", then ours and one more on the other side of us, we were the only/last party seated in that section). A different server (not our original server) later asks us if we didn't mind moving to the booth across from us because a party of 13 was waiting and had been waiting for \\"a while and was getting a little antsy\\"--you read that right--we were at the tail end of our meal when we were asked to get up and move to another table to accommodate a larger party. I literally only had one potato left on my plate and my husband had a few crab legs. Now, we eat out a lot; from 5-star high-end establishments to food trucks and greasy spoons...we've seen and experienced a lot.

Well, when he went to use the coupon that was mailed to us to try out their place as part of their grand opening (there were several on the mailer but we chose the buy one entree, get another for 50% off), we were told that we couldn't use the coupon because we were already given the discount. She said you can get $5 discount now and use the coupon next time. Huh?? I informed her that the coupons expired on 10/16 and we were not planning on coming back next week AND we would be saving more than $5 if we used the coupon that WE chose. After she fruitlessly tried to convince us to accept her discount, she relented and processed the bill using our coupon. While my husband was reviewing the final bill, the manager blatantly asked: \\"so you're not coming back or what?\\" I was truly thrown off first by the situation in general and then everything that happened afterwards. I told her that I wasn't sure but we both knew the answer.

Both are so good, the one with sweet potato one has sour cream and another topping that makes it fit so perfectly and the avocado has a mango salsa that was so good!! The dough taco is ALWAYS so soft and warm, 10/10 recommend :)\\n\\nThey have different styles tater tots that allow for a tasty side. I got the truffle flavor tots to share with my sister and they're for sure good for sharing :) The tots did not taste like they had much truffle but we asked for more and they gladly gave it with no complaint!!

We were offered to check our coats in or bring them with us to our table. We ordered the crab cake, calamari, mackerel pastrami, tuna crudo, clam chowder, lobster roll, and the cornbread. The portion sizes were surprisingly very big so I would but recommend ordering as much as we did unless you have a larger party or if you can eat all of it. \\n\\nThe crab cake comes with an aioli that is delicious. It also comes with guac and a small salad that is very tart. The aioli really added flavor to the crab cake. The calamari is soft and a little spicy because it's fried with jalapenos. Some of the breading of the calamari would fall off. The mackerel pastrami came with creme fresh. It cut through the saltiness of the mackerel, but I did not really like the dish. The clam chowder had fresh herbs in it that added extra flavor to the chowder. It was good. The lobster roll was greasy. The roll itself was too thick and too much bread so I ended up just eating the lobster which was fine. The chips were good. The tuna crudo was nothing special. The cornbread with maple butter was good.

Booked reservations the day of, hostess and server were very welcoming and seated my girlfriend and I at the bar to start while I table was being set (we were slightly early due to street parking being easy).\\n\\nWhen I got to the bar I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of craft beers they had on draft. I would say there were about 10-15 different beers on tap, varying from pilsners to lagers to IPAs to stouts. I looked further to my right and you could see their raw bar and the quality of their seafood.\\n\\nI requested in my reservation to be somewhat close to the TVs so I could watch the game and we were seated with a great view, but still far enough from the bar that we didn't hear a sound. Our waitress was great, she knew everything we could ask about the raw bar and gave great recommendations on what to choose.\\n\\nMy girlfriend ordered 3 different types of raw oysters (only $2.50-$3), split an order of the lager steamed mussels that honestly was a meal in itself and beyond flavorful, and I ordered the warm buttered lobster roll for myself since that was their staple and why I chose the restaurant.\\n\\nEvery dish was well plated and could taste the quality. Literally everything just melted in your mouth. The lobster roll itself lived up to the hype, and it's not your typical lobster roll that is almost like a slaw. Row 34 put whole chunks of lobster in a fresh buttered roll with a side of homemade chips that had the perfect crunch but still melted in your mouth. There was so much lobster that I was eating some with my fork first just so I could bite into the entire thing.\\n\\nWill definitely be making another visit on my next vacation to Boston because this was my favorite meal the entire trip.

This place is in the middle of nowhere. Surrounded by empty pastures and dirt. 20+ miles from the nearest Austin suburb.

There's definitely a nice, thick, sexy smoke ring on each piece, but what was advertised as \\"moist brisket\\" was half moist, half dry and lean. The ribs, in my opinion, are their best. The sausage is decent too. The potato salad is very potato-y and not that mayo-y, which I like. And the sauce... I LOVE the sauce. It's just the right mixture of sweet, savory, honey-mustardy that I don't really have the foodie vocabulary to describe. But it's not as vinegary-pungent as other sauces.

But as I sat down in front of my computer to write a review the next day, I wondered, \\"Would I have liked Frank Ma's as much as I did if I didn't go in a group?\\" I tried to ignore the question. But it lingered forever and ever and a little longer.  Urgh, the damn reasonable doubt. So my boyfriend and I revisited Frank Ma's to see if my first impression was correct.\\n\\nI will say that it was difficult (and a bit scary) to walk into a restaurant that the sole language used doesn't really match my language knowledge. In other words, I had no clue what the special on the board was, had difficulty understanding our waitress, etc. (Now I know what you feel like upon walking into a Korean restaurant!) I asked our waitress for recommendation, but she didn't give me any; she sort of explained the specials of the day (which we didn't understand) and that was it. My boyfriend and I tried to translate the menu, but that didn't really work, either. So we just ended up ordering the specials (which I later learned to be Pepper Steak) with some other dishes. My favorite was the Onion Pancakes, which just melts in your mouth.\\n\\nOverall, the food was still very delicious - just as how I remembered it from the UYE night. But it lacked variety: Obviously, it's hard to try all those different entr√©es with only two people! Still, the incredible portion persisted. I swear, we didn't order that much, but we went home with three containers (which we enjoyed the next day).  \\n\\nAs I mentioned above, although our waitress and we had difficulty understanding each other, I could feel the warmth in her service. She was friendly, prompt, and helpful to a degree. She was always smiling and explained carefully as to what each dish was. I really appreciated that.\\n\\nAnswer to my question: I think I enjoyed it a bit more when I went with the large group. Nothing beats all that variety! The night I went back, Frank and Amy weren't there, so I was a little bit bummed.

I especially appreciated the menu stating their bbq is gluten free.  That was the cherry on top for me.  The pork ribs melted off the bone, that was a favorite for the whole group.  And that sauce!  I'm not usually the saucy bbq type but this was an exception!  Bbq was delish with or without the sauce.  I mostly used it for the sausage.  For sides I only ate the coleslaw as I couldn't eat the other sides due to allergies but it's okay I ate everything else and was stuffed!

My order should've come to $13 or so with tax, but he quoted me $19. I told him I'll pick it up instead because that's ridiculous-I've never heard of a place charging a delivery fee and a separate delivery tax.

You walk in and have to find a seat, good luck. We finally found a seat and a service person came by our table and told us we had to go to the bar station to order food and drink. Waited in line for 40 minutes and finally got to place an order and was told that we should have ordered at our table??? Waited another 30 minutes to get our food. Got our pepperoni flatbread ($10) and strawberry and spinach salad ($9). The flatbread tasted like a frozen pizza which wasn't cooked properly. The salad was better but they didn't trim the spinach stems. The people next to us at the table never did get any food or drink. They had to cancel their order to make the concert. \\n\\nSo here are some thoughts on how to make this place better:\\n1. The open seating, trying to squeeze yourself in-between 2 strangers doesn't work well. And the space utilization is inefficient.\\n2. The food and drink ordering process is inefficient/chaotic and having a sign which says \\"cash only\\" when it really isn't doesn't help things.\\n3. The menu is ridiculously small and having a big sign promoting your cheese steak sandwich when it is not on the menu, is pretty lame. There are more food options at a gas station minimart.\\n4. The prices are too high for the quality of the food.\\n5. The staff need better training and you need more of them, twice as many. Honestly, most of the customers felt sorry for the staff. It was so obvious that the service problem is a management problem not a service people problem. They were doing their best to provide service in an absurd work environment. \\n\\nIt's unfortunate that this is the only game in town next to the Moda Center.

This crappy trend is prevalent with Americanized Mexican food places, but I never experienced it at an \\"authentic\\" restaurant.  Oh well, focus on that P and L.\\n\\nSalsa is limited to boring spicy red and mild green, they also carry the bottled regulars.\\n\\nBreakfast Burrito with al pastor = excellent.  The scrambled egg pieces, jalape√±os (or maybe it was guacamole) and tomatoes are nice and small.  It's juicy and the tortilla is soft and grilled.  Size isn't huge like at some of the carts, but still decent.\\n\\nThe enchilada plate was full of flavor and portion.  They offer three sauces, so get one of each.  You also get your choice of filling, the gooey cheese makes it my favorite.  The rice and cabbage were good, but I prefer refried over black beans, but they don't offer the former.\\n\\nI was initially disappointed that they filled the churros with fruit compote, but warm any churro and it's usually very good.  Be sure to sub the cheap Reddi-Wip with ice cream.\\n\\nPlenty of seating, table service, and easy parking.  Service was friendly, but slow and inattentive (they were filling a gigantic togo order.)

It's pretty easy to find and I would say this is a better location than their previous one on Morrison but this is mainly because of the parking and convenience. Being in downtown Portland, it's mainly street parking if you don't want to fork out the money for the parking lot. However, if you're willing to fork it out, there is a private lot directly across from it. I would definitely take advantage of the free street parking after 7 pm to save a few dollars. \\n\\nMenu/Pricing: I love how they broke down the menu into 3 simple steps, sauce, rice and \\"type.\\" They do offer brown rice for 50 cents more but I wasn't really able to tell the difference since it was drenched in curry. It is a tad expensive or at least more than I would like to pay but it's worth the experience - will come back once and a while. \\n\\nFood: I ordered the Beef Katsu Kale Doria with brown rice and it was very hearty! It was packed with flavor with the cheese giving it a unique taste and style that I haven't had before. The chicken didn't have much of a crunch but I am very picky on that. A warning for those that order it, the dish does come out extremely hot. \\n\\nService: The only service you'll get is when you order because it's a sit down and bus your own table type of restaurant. Even with this fact, the service here is still better than most places where you sit down and they take your own.

We had pulled pork, brisket, and turkey - pork and turkey were our families favorite."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"For my first visit to Texas, I knew I had to try BBQ. As a lifelong west coaster, I constantly hear that our BBQ joints don't compare to those in the South. I feel like I'll have to do some more research in the future before I make a call though on who has the best BBQ. It may be a matter of you favor what you know but I wasn't completely blown away. Yes, the meat fire pit was impressive and the decor was absolutely amazing with the rustic dining room and trees growing through the roof, but I wasn't as impressed by the food. \\n\\nI debated between the chicken and the brisket before deciding on the brisket since this is Texas and Texas is known for its beef. Unfortunately, none of the three sides (baked beans, potato salad or Cole slaw) appealed to me so I opted for just the 1/2 pound of brisket. I would have loved a mac and cheese side. My BFF has been to Texas a few times and she has raved about the brisket in the past. I wish she'd been there to let me know how this one compared because to me it seemed a bit dry and maybe overcooked. I'm not familiar with brisket or how it compares to other beef but I like my steak to be medium rare and juicy and this brisket was too dry for me. Maybe it's supposed to be that way and it's meant to be doused in the BBQ sauce. It wasn't bad by any means but just not my favorite type of beef, I guess. \\n\\nI also ordered a blackberry cobbler and was amazed at the portion size. Wow! That's a lot of cobbler! I couldn't even finish half of it. I highly recommend adding a scoop of ice cream to it as it adds a nice bit of creaminess. The cobbler itself was less sweet than I had anticipated but the ice cream made it sweeter.\\n\\nWe all had bigger eyes than stomachs and we hated leaving the food uneaten but we couldn't even take it with us since we had a busy day planned. Unless you have a huge appetite, you could easily share a plate, especially with a dessert, with another person. \\n\\nThe restaurant is cash only and they can't split the bill so come prepared or use the atm on site. Luckily, I had enough cash on hand to pay for our group."},{"name":"TooJay's","address":"10185 W Colonial Dr","city":"Ocoee","stars":"3.5","text":"if your looking for a quick bite of  home style favorites then this could be yourplace.

Impeccable service comes infrequently in fine dining, no matter the Zagat/Michelin star rating.

We were served by 7 or 8 people during our meal and each was utterly professional in the manner you want from an excellent restaurant. Most fabulous was our waiter who must have taken his training seriously as every move was as it should be, down to folding the serviette when we vacated the table briefly. That's how it used to be done but sadly, now, even in very respected establishments, staff feel it's acceptable to greet you as \\"guys\\".
