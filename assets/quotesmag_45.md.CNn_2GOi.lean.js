Those three c's are \\"Coffee, Computers, and Comfort\\". Coffee, obviously refers to how good the coffee is. Computers covers the amount of tables, whether or not they have free wifi, and how many electrical outlets there are. And finally comfort, referring to how the space feels.\\n\\nPalio is damn near close to hitting a 10 on all three categories.\\n\\nThe coffee tastes great. Admittedly, I'm not huge into coffee culture. I just know when a cup of coffee tastes good. I order black coffee wherever I go, and Palio has good drip coffee. 'Nuff said. I did wish that they had free refills though. Refill charges bum me out a little, but I understand. A lot of places are charging these days.\\n\\nThis place was practically built for working customers! It's great. I don't sit and read or chat too often in coffee shops, so I'm just looking for a place I can plop down my laptoppy. The back room is just full of large tables, each one with a electrical outlet AND a power strip, and it's always quiet. It's kind of study room for Reedies, but there's usually one seat available.\\n\\nAs far as comfort, Palio feels nice. The walls are never bare, they feature local art often. And there's enough decoration and smart use of space to help you breathe easy.\\n\\nMy one reason for bumping it to 4 stars: there's a slight passive aggressiveness here. There are signs up stating that there is a certain amount of time you should be seated before you should order something. This is probably referring to poor college students looking for a cheap place to study, but it makes me feel weird. Is a drip coffee enough payment to allow me to stay an hour? Do I have to buy a pastry too?\\n\\nIf the answer is yes, and I do have to buy a pastry, then I probably wouldn't complain. Those pastries and desserts are a new category altogether. Super super good.

I enjoyed the decor, but there were many little workings that made the hotel strange. For example, the main restroom for the hotel was in the basement. You went through a room keyed door, which basically brought you into a closet where you went into the actual bathroom. Very poorly planned and odd. I felt like I could be murdered and no one would know. The dining areas had an unfinished feel to them. What I mean by that is it seems that they just put a couple guest rooms together and hailed it \\"The Lounge\\" or \\"The Cafe.\\" Anyway, the lobby and majority of common areas were sparkling clean and appealing. The room itself was in great shape. The armoire consisted of a large flat screen TV and well-stocked mini-bar. There were lots of little touches and everything was monogrammed. Parts of the room and hotel are showing its age, but that's what makes historic hotels charming and it does not bother me. The closet in the entryway to the room was a little strange. It had a keyed bolt, which made no sense at all. So I could actually go in the closet and lock myself in. Panic room? I was surprised that the windows opened all the way. If I had been depressed I could have made a complete nose dive onto Newbury Street. Thankfully I was in high spirits. The bathroom was tiny and the door would not stay open unless you held it still. Molton Brown toiletries were appreciated, but the shower itself was a disaster since an inexpensive shower curtain was used... So as soon as you turned on the shower it blew in and wrapped itself around me the entire time. It was almost like wearing a giant ribbed condom in the shower. The room service attendants were polite and content. Housekeeping made a trip up during our dinner service, turned our bed, added chocolates and bottled water on the nightstands, which is a common occurrence in most hotels anyway. The doormen were disambiguated. Only one was pleasant, but as our experience with the elderly server in The Cafe, the older ones would not look or talk to us and acted completely aloof. Hello, you are a doorman! Nice facilities, but not what I expected in terms of service or luxury, so not likely I would stay again. Great location on Newbury Street though.

It seems with this Chick-Fil-A, I'm willing to put in the time (by waiting in line) and I care about the product (i.e. rewards in junk food).\\n\\nAtlanta International along with many other southern airports seem to easily win me over when it comes to chains I know I won't get in NYC.

However, when compared to Din Tai Fung, these are not on the same level.  They are smaller, thinner skin, lighter flavor and less soup.  Some would prefer those qualities.  Din Tai Fung became my personal standard for XLB and its not fair to compare with another restaurant, so I recommend try them for yourself.\\n\\nStir Fried Bamboo (picture)\\nThe dish we were served did not match the picture on the menu.  The menu showed a light colored sauce, but the actual dish was heavily covered in dark sauce.  It had a strong hoisin/soy sauce taste and I couldn't eat more than 1-3 at a time.\\n\\nSpare Ribs w/ Salt (picture)\\nThis dish was very, very dry.  There was barely any meat per bite.  We couldn't eat much of it.\\n\\nSteamed Mashed Taro Buns (picture)\\nBun texture and chewiness good.  Taro filling was not sweet enough.\\n\\nAlmond Tofu with Fruits (picture)\\nI couldn't taste the almond flavor at all. Tofu is very bland.  Not sweet enough (I am used to eating the almond pudding version.  If you like the more bland tofu flavor, you will like this.

I wanted to try all the things and figured they'd make good leftovers, so I got the pate trio, the eggplant walnut-pate roll-up dealies, the smoked-bean stuffed-dough doohickey, the mushroom dumpling jobbers, and a side of the red pepper stuff (I don't recall the proper names of anything, sry). \\n\\nThe beet pate legit tasted moldy (don't ask me how I know what mold tastes like..?), the carrot version had a cardboard flavor going on, and the spinach pate would've been good if it wasn't so salty. The eggplant walnut-pate dealies were pretty bitter and seemed too rich to be eaten on their own.. it was basically just a mouthful of pate. The smoked-bean dough thing was SOooooooo effing salty.. and I'm not one to shy away from salt. I couldn't even put the red pepper stuff on it cuz it just added more salt, but it def could've used the extra flavor otherwise. The mushroom dumplings looked so good, and I LOVE all things mushroom (and dumpling!), but these were all mushroom and nothing else.. the beauty of mushrooms is they take on the flavor of whatever else you cook them with. These just tasted like lonely old mushrooms home alone on a Friday night cuz they weren't invited to the onion and herb party at the Savory's..

Although, the side of red pepper spread was pretty tasty. Heavy on the fenugreek tho, which is one of those spices that you sweat out for days after you eat it. The pita-like bread that came with the pate trio was good too, so if I eat there again (unlikely) I'll get the bread with a side of fenugreek-sweat surprise, and maybe I'll try the meat dumplings.. \\n\\nHopefully these peeps start tasting their food more before they serve it so they don't make any more super salty or moldy-tasting mistakes!"},{"name":"Get Sum Dim Sum","address":"4400 N Lamar Blvd, Ste 102","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Tried this place last Friday, and was very pleasantly surprised.

Their patio rocks and on a beautiful day, its a perfect place to just kick back, drink and enjoy the good laughs you get from everybody else out there. \\n\\nI will give you the following warning though: SERVICE SUCKS!!!!! It took us about 15 minutes after being sat to get water on the table, and even then our server didnt introduce himself or say anything at all. Dropped water and boom.... gone! He showed up about 10 minutes later to ask if we were ready and quickly hurried away again. After ordering our shorties, it took f-o-r-e-v-e-r to get them, and our server came to tell us the bar was being really slow. (How long can it possibly take to pour a shot?) When he came back we just told him to go ahead and bring us a bunch of them and leave them for us ( which he happily did.)\\n\\nLong story short don't go here and expect good food or good service.

Yes, Barlata is not cheap, yes, it's a hot new place and gets packed, yes, parking is somewhat limited, communal seating, blah, blah, complain, complain, whatever!  If you know Spanish food and make smart choices about when you go, you are going to love this place.\\n\\nFirst, make a reservation in advance on Open Table if you don't want to wait or be there during the rush. Even better, be open to eating at the less hip hour of 5:30p and you should have no trouble at all having dinner here on a Saturday night. Since I'm all about the food and could care less about being seen, eating with the AARP crowd suits me just fine. Leaves more time for after dinner adventures elsewhere, and the place isn't so crowded that you can't establish a bit of privacy while seated next to your new friends at the next place setting.\\n\\nSecond, don't get cocktails if you're pinching pennies! Order a delicious glass of Spanish wine or draft beer and taste the terra madre.  We drink the house sangria and the Estrella cerveza on tap - tasty, refreshing, and just about the lowest price point on the adult beverages menu.\\n\\nThird, choose wisely from the food menu.  If this is your first visit and you are going for substantial portions, order one of the paellas as your main dish.  The small is plenty for 2 to share (assuming that you ordered a couple of the other small plates before).  The crab stuffed piquillo peppers and the house cured salmon are lovely. Keep in mind that the seafood is super fresh and all of the Spanish ingredients are imported, so you're paying for that premium. \\n\\nFourth, save room for dessert! If you choose the most adventurous option, it is likely that the chef & owner will serve it to you personally. On our last visit, that was the tomatoes 3 ways option, Pan con tomate (marinated fresh mini-tomatoes with vanilla olive oil semifreddo, roasted tomato soil, tomato jellies, and sweet garlic chips).  I love it when a dessert mixes the savory and salty with the sweet and fresh, and this one was a delight. \\n\\nEveryone from the hostess to our server to the chef and his lovely wife could not have been more welcoming to us.

Got a Rita on the rocks (liked it) good size, the goblet was warm but it happens. I ordered a swirl next and that was pretty good as well. The ratio between tequila and mix works for me. The chips were warm and delicious as the salsa. The salsa is flavorful and not chunky (which I like). I ordered the Barbacoa plate. The tortillas are definitely made there and at first I was impressed. They were warm and the right thickness but when I got to my second one I wasn't. Too thick and hard around the edges. The rice and beans were to die for!! So tasty! The rice was that soft fluffy tomatoey rice. No peppers, peas or carrots cut up in it. The beans were fresh and creamy. Definitely the highlight of the meal. The actually Barbacoa was okay. It along with the guac needed salt.  The portion were a little on the small side but I don't mind. It's actually annoying to me when I get a plate put in front of me with enough food for an army. The salad under the guac was very good, flavorful.

It was our first time trying it out, and I'm sure we'll be back again. Since it was our first time, we took the easy route and got the two dishes that the lady at the counter recommended. My daughter ordered the BiBimBop with the ribeye, and I got the Ramen Soup with the chicken. To drink, my daughter ordered a Coke, and was surprised to get it in a large bottle, which was a 1/2 liter of Mexican Coke (tasted the same as US coke to me). I got the refillable cup for \\"Dragon Water\\" and had my choice of four - one was a sweetened black tea, one was jasmine green tea, and there was a unique lemonade that among other things had apple cider vinegar listed as an ingredient, and a mango drink that also had ginger and lime. I loved both the mango and the lemonade, having a glass of each.\\nThe BiBimBop was quite spicy - I think if my daughter and I hadn't shared, she wouldn't have been able to eat it all due to the heat in it (and she likes spicy food). So if you decide to get this, be ready for some heat. The same caution applies to the Korean sauce at the table. The ribeye was chopped quite finely, so once you mixed up the bowl, it was hard to really get a taste of it specifically. The other add-ins were cucumbers, spinach, lettuce, bean sprouts (marinated in a soy/sesame mix) and the egg and rice. Very yummy!\\nMy Ramen was great. The texture of the noodle was not that of \\"regular\\" ramen, but not like lo mein or spaghetti, either. But very good, even if hard to describe. The chicken was a big pieces, and there were also cucumbers and bamboo shoots. The flavor of the broth was terrific - my daughter would have drank a bowl of it by itself. There were sauces to choose from on the table, and I couldn't decide on my favorite. I alternated with each bite I took between the Thai peanut, Chinese sweet and sour and Japanese teriyaki. Good thing we ate in and I got to use all three!\\nThe lady at the register was none too friendly, although she was also answering the phone while helping me, so she may just have been distracted. She didn't give me a cup - I had to go back up and ask for it. \\nAtmosphere is nothing special or unique, but not off-putting, either. The other dinners who were there while we were there were diverse in color and age, so it's a place anyone should be comfortable dropping into.\\nPlenty of parking in the adjacent lot, so overall a great place to stop if you are in the area and craving Asian flavors."},{"name":"Boston Kitchen Pizza","address":"1 Stuart St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This is how pizza should taste.  \\n\\nI was staying at the Hostel International next door and I was very glad that I tried this place out.

You've provided me with a wonderful diner experience since the day I came to Portland, and I am truly ashamed of not reviewing you more quickly before I left Portland. This business is now closed, thanks to the building-up and gentrification of Hawthorne, Division, and Belmont streets. I hope the owners enjoy a wonderful retirement, knowing they provided a service that will be missed. To the guy who owns the building: enjoy your soulless capitalistic ill-gotten gains. You forced them out of business and you know it.\\n\\nThere is nothing not to love about this place, assuming you're a casual kind of person who likes extremely friendly (if sometimes slow) service from two older parents who are raising a child while running a restaurant. The kids' stuff in one corner is a dead give-away, but their daughter is insanely friendly and well-behaved, although I believe she's in Kindergarten now. My, how quickly they grow.\\n\\nThe food is nothing insanely special. It's simple, oldschool, tasty diner food that can be cooked relatively well to order. They understand gluten-free and no-whatever just fine, and will make just about anything into a combination if you ask nicely. That said, the portions are sizable, and the hashbrowns are legitimately good and not-greasy, and the bacon is always crispy.\\n\\nI come more for the incredibly low prices compared to everything else in the area. It's a nice place to sit and talk for a while over coffee and a sandwich. It's a nice place to do the morning crossword.

This place has truly mastered the art of catering to a diverse customer base without necessarily losing its underlying identity. In the end, this family-owned dive is worth a visit for multiple reasons, not the least of which is because they offer $1 beers and pizzas topped with ingredients such as mac n' cheese, baked beans, and mashed potatoes. \\n\\nFood:  Jack's is a seemingly traditional American pizzeria. Nonetheless, the flavor profiles of some of their specialty pizzas are incredibly impressive. During my first visit, my dining partner and I opted for a medium \\"Jason\\", which was topped with a duo of gluttonous perfection: mac n' cheese and bacon.  The pizza was perfectly cooked and the ingredients were fresh and generously portioned. We also ordered the plain pizza rolls, which were equally as a delicious. \\n\\nService: Friendly and unpretentious. There isn't a host, so menus are kept at each table and patrons are responsible for seating themselves. However, the staff is fairly diligent about keeping track of new arrivals and greeting them in a timely manner. In addition to dine-in service, takeout and delivery are also available.\\n\\nAtmosphere: The physical state of the restaurant itself is fairly rundown, but it's all part of their whole shtick and doesn't appear to deter customers. The clientele is incredibly eclectic and runs the gamut from hipsters to families with children. \\n\\nCost: Reasonably priced for the quality and quantity of the food offerings. \\nAppetizers cost $4-$6, wings (10) are $8.50, salads are $5-$7.50, sandwiches and calzones are $6-$11. Pizza is $5 per slice, $15-$17 for a medium pie (serves 2-3), and $17-$22 for a large pie (serves 4-5). Alcohol is noticeably cheaper than most other bars in the area; $1 beers are available all day every day.  \\n\\nOther: In addition to featuring live entertainment on a regular basis, Jack's Pizza and Wings also hosts various recurring events throughout the week, including trivia on Mondays (general at 8PM and cartoon at 10PM), poker on Wednesdays, adults trivia on Thursdays, drunk bingo on Fridays, and \\"Blood Sundays\\" (Bloody Mary and mimosa specials)."},{"name":"Bruegger's Bagels","address":"1630 Neil Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Great place to stop in for a quick lunch or to study.

We stayed in the new tower.  It was clean with contemporary decor. I love the TV in the bathrooms even if there was only a couple channels.  The bed was super comfy.  Our room came with a desk, sitting area with a huge TV (don't ask me how big), iPod docking station so you can play your own music & a refrigerator.  \\n\\nQuick tip:  If traveling without children, the old tower pool is better to catch some rays and relax. Most families choose the new pool because of the beach, children's pool and slide area.  The upstairs pool was pretty empty in the midst of spring break.\\n\\nWe enjoyed the jazz singer at the lounge.  Yummy martinis. \\n\\nExtras: $25+ to valet park, $10 resort fees which includes wifi (that was super slow BTW). The coffee from the coffee shop is $9, a slice of key lime pie is $8.  No soda machines anywhere in the hotel.  The fountain soda from the B-Line Cafe is $4.  You can buy it cheaper from their gift  for 2 for $6 for 20-ounce Coke bottle.  \\n\\nLast tip. Upgrade to a club suite if available for $95 and get continental breakfast, free valet, water, soda, hors d'oeuvres from 5-7, desserts pre-bedtime and a room in the new tower. \\n\\nWe will definitely come back again and again. LOVED it.\\n\\nPS.  Please bare in mind that the 5-stars comes ONLY from compairing Orlando Hotel experience only.\\n\\nPPS.

I clearly have a lot more exploring to do, but I looked to Yelp and Google for some help. So being one of the semifinalists for the 2011 James Beard Award for Best Chef in the South, and the fact that it's called \\"The Ravenous Pig\\" (what an awesome name!) didn't set high expectations for this place! And I hate it, I mean HATE IT, when I get my hopes up and get dismally disappointed when they don't deliver. Happy to report that The Ravenous Pig didn't disappoint!!! My boyfriend was the total skeptic, since he likes to find the hole-in-the-wall diamond-in-the-rough good eats... he was very pleasantly surprised and impressed. \\n\\nWhat did we have... \\nSTARTERS \\n-Crispy Pig Trotter: interesting, tasty (but isn't everything that's battered and fried?), worth trying, but not amazing \\n-House-made Charcuterie and Artisan Cheese: great variety, good flavors, and more filling than we expected! \\n*Would recommend both. If I had to choose between the two, I'd choose the charcuterie and cheese over the trotter \\n\\nENTREES \\n-Prime Beef Brisket-with kings farms athena melon, heirloom tomato panzanella, sweet mustard glaze, pickled watermelon rind chutney \\n-Maple Leaf Farms Duck Breast-bbq beluga lentils, glazed artichokes, dragon beans, rhubard-basil relish \\n(Czech beer & Cab) \\n*Would definitely recommend both!! A lot of interesting flavors with both dishes that really went well with each other and the meats were perfectly cooked! The duck is cooked sous vide and then finished off with a crispy skin. Ahhhh... so juicy, crispy and good!!! The brisket was served with a cantaloupe tasting melon... sounds strange and wrong, but is soooo right!! \\n\\nThe portions were perfect... if you think it's too small, maybe you should do some caloric counting and check your BMI.

This place was crawling (and in many cases, literally) with children.  I have to commend some of the wait staff for their tolerance.  I am continuously amazed how parents let their kidlings run free range in completely unacceptable places.  \\nCase in point: We had reservations for The Wave on a Friday early evening.  Lots of children... Actually, I can tolerate children, but the running around and screaming gets on my last nerve.  My parents didn't tolerate it and I knew better than to pull that crap.  When we sat down, the 2 girls at the table across from us were about 6 and 8 years old.  Their parents were ignoring them for about 15 minutes while they swung themselves around in a large circle, jumped around the tables, and generally did everything possible except stick their butts in chairs.  I was annoyed because they had at least 2 close misses with wait staff.  Wait staff who were carrying large heavy plates topped with piping hot food and sharp pointy things.  These plates are heavy enough to give a kid a good whack on the head.  It's unsafe and inappropriate to allow children to act like animals just because you want to have a conversation.  \\n\\nBut I digress.  Annoying children and parents, but a professional staff that avoided the little heathens from suffering self-inflicted injuries by circling around them like racecar drivers swerving around road hazards.\\n\\nOur waiter was really scattered.  The meal started well with alot of attention, but he disappeared in the back at least 3 times for 10-15 minutes and always sounded like had just had a triple espresso.  Because of his frequent and long lapses (and I don't mean waiting on other customers... I mean walking into the back and 15 minutes later finally appearing with 3 iced teas for another table they ordered, take another order, and repeat... and he didn't even serve the food to the tables... it was runners who did that), we decided to skip dessert because he was irritating so much... it shouldn't take 30 minutes to get an iced tea and a check if you only have 4 tables, aren't running their food, and only need to get their drinks.  It wasn't like he was lavishing attention on the other tables... he was treating us all this way.  I commented to the husband that The Wave must not rely on his sections for turnover because our 45 minute meal took about 90 minutes solely on just waiting on him and not the food itself.\\n\\nHowever, the food itself was nice.  I had the Strawberry salad and the pork loin.  The Strawberry salad was a standard strawberry and greens salad with a light vinigrette.  It was executed well.  It arrived with a very crispy long cracker that added a nice texture to the overall dish.\\n\\nThe pork loin was an interesting dish.  I really liked the concept and saw what the chef was going for, but he/she didn't quite pull it off.  The pork itself was slightly smoky and charred.  It was moist and flavorful with a portion that was perfect for an evening meal (read: the recommended portion of meat for a serving... not half a piggie).  This smoky flavor was supposed to contrast with the sarsaparilla and root beer sauce.  The sauce had a nice depth of flavor, but was a little too sweet.  If it was the only sweet component on the dish, I think it would work, but the sides were a bourbon sweet potato and spinach salad.  The bourbon sweet potatoes were whipped and smooth as a baby's bottom.  Truth be told, I didn't really taste the bourbon at all.  These added an additional sweet flavor to the dish when in combination with the sauce made the overall effect cloying sweet.\\nThe spinach salad was excellent.  It had to be there to add a slightly savory, smoky, rich element to the dish that would pair with the pork and play off the sweet of the sauce and potato... in theory.\\n\\nThe salad was good, but it wasn't enough to cut through all the sweet on the plate.\\n\\nOverall, I really liked the pork and thought it was an extremely good dish that needs more thought.  Each of the individual elements was excellent and worked.  However, as a cohesive whole, they did not meld together into a chorus of flavor.  It was more like a bunch of solo artists fighting for the spotlight."},{"name":"Hot Pot Buffet","address":"70 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Having been a patron of the original Little Q in Quincy for all its years since it opened, I was heartbroken to see them have to close down and move away. Fast forward half a year: I'm back in Boston again and while wandering around Chinatown one day I see the large sign beckoning; like a moth towards light, I walked towards the sign and stared in disbelief reading the words \\"Hot Pot Buffet\\". Instantly added to my \\"to-try\\" list.\\n\\nA week later, I grab a group and convince them to head into Boston for Hot Pot Buffet's $14.95 hot pot lunch. For broths we picked black bone chicken and mala (hot and spicy). Since the group was much heavier on testosterone than estrogen, we proceeded to order as many dishes as possible with the majority being meat. Buffet for guys mean \\"all-you-CAN-eat\\" and that means it's an actual physical challenge of gluttony. Our first list was 6 orders of beef, 2 lamb, 2 pork, 2 of each ball, 1 dumpling, 3 various vegetables (bok choy, etc.), 2 mushroom and 1 clam.\\n\\nFood comes out 1-2 items at a time, which works out as the table is only so big. The mala broth ends up not being spicy enough for us chiliheads, so our gracious server brought out an entire bowl of red chili peppers with some schezuan peppercorn (we ended up dumping the entire bowl in; the broth at the end of the meal looked like a nuclear zone).\\n\\nThe meats are all decent quality and have beautiful marbling (make sure you always get the \\"fatty\\" cuts if applicable; they're much more tender and most of the fat will boil off anyways). All the ingredients are pretty much what you would expect for hot pot. The broths were a slight let down; if you're a fan of Little Q's broth, you'll probably be slightly disappointed too (they're much less \\"herbal-ly\\").\\n\\nSome people have complained about service, but I saw nothing wrong with any of it; empty plates were cleared off our table almost instantly and our glasses never got more than half empty. My friends and I were so impressed with the service that we ended up tipping around 4 bucks each. One thing though; they bring out only a single order of everything you order no matter what number you write down so if you want extra you'll just have to ask them for another sheet. This is probably to reduce the amount of food being wasted with patrons over-ordering.\\n\\nAt $15 bucks, Hot Pot Buffet is hands-down the best hot pot deal in town. It ain't perfect but it sure does fix a craving."},{"name":"Ranch 616","address":"616 Nueces St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Ranch 616 catered our company's 10th Anniversary party and provided excellent food and exceptional service.

This has been a tradition since before the kid-unit would even eat steak.\\n\\nThere was very little \\"good\\" to say about our visit.  The wait-staff (we had two, a girl who introduced herself, and a man who did not) was aloof, though relatively attentive to our needs.  Our friends had a few questions about items on the menu, and out waiter answered them knowledgeably, but in a really \\"put-off\\" manner.\\n\\nI ordered my standard, which is the triple filet (two Bearnaise,  one mushroom sauce), along with a shrimp cocktail and a wedge salad.  Kiddo ordered the kids filet ($12), and the wife ordered a baked potato and a shrimp cocktail as well.\\n\\nMy steaks were done correctly (medium), and the Bearnaise was good.  The mushrooms have changed from a mushroom in a wine reduction to wine-soaked mushrooms (not good).  The sides were fine, though unremarkable.  \\n\\nThe shrimp cocktail has changed significantly since I was there last.  In the past, the shrimp was served on a bed of tortilla strips and peppers with a vinaigrette.  This is no longer the case, though.  Instead, the shrimp was served over a bed of ice \\"diamonds\\" (hard to call them anything else, because the clarity of the ice was actually quite impressive).  The shrimp was served with traditional cocktail sauce (with fresh horseradish-- a nice touch), and a remoulade, as well.\\n\\nQuality of the shrimp was good, with the exception of one of them that still had a leg attached.  Not a big deal, but also not the quality I expect from JGs'.\\n\\nThis is where things went downhill.  My daughter's steak was served, and though it was a decent portion for a filet, it had an odor about it.  At first I chalked it up to either the wood smoke from the grilling, or from the other food. \\n\\nAfter I cut it up, she tried it and told me she didn't like the flavor (which is really unusual for her).  I tried it as well, and found the flavor \\"off\\" a bit.  She ate about half the steak, and finished up her chips and grazed at some of the items on our shared appetizer plates.  I tried another piece and found the steak to be \\"sour.\\"  \\n\\nI took a piece over to my wife, had her smell it and taste it.  After about two bites, she had to spit it out.\\n\\nI took a piece to the manager, and he declared the smell to be \\"fine\\", but graciously offered to remove the entree from our bill (which I accepted).

They clearly haven't done anything in terms of upgrades since it's Ritz days. There were many details that could have had more attention paid to them, but all of that aside, i had a serious water issue. Serious. \\nI went to take a shower before a business dinner that I had to go to, and when i turned the shower on, the water came out black. I don't mean \\"slightly brown\\". It was black. I called downstairs and they said to let it run for a bit, that they had blown a water main or something. So I did, and nothing changed. The supervisor then suggested I take a shower down the hall, where supposedly the water wasn't black; so like an embarrassed one-night-stand-gone-bad I walked down the hall in my bathroom to this other room, where...the water was still brown. \\nI was already running late so I finally said i had to leave, sans shower,  and when i came back, if necessary, i could change rooms. Well, i came home at 11:30 pm to find the tub almost full of extremely hot water, and my entire room completely steamed up (since they have no ventilation in the bathroom, the steam infiltrated my guest room). The water was no longer black, but apparently they had to let the water run for 4+ hours in order for this to occur. \\nI had to turn the water off myself, and then clean out my tub myself so that I could shower the next morning. I have a feeling if I didn't come home when I did I would have had a  flooded bathroom. \\n\\nThe glamor of the Ritz days are obviously long gone for this hotel. In my opinion, this is completely unacceptable for a hotel of this supposed caliber.\\n\\n**Update: upon checkout, I had expected some sort of compensation for the major inconvenience and for the way they had handled it. Nothing was offered at first, so when reviewing my bill I mentioned to the employee at the front desk that i had expected some sort of compensation for my bad experience, and his response was \\"some things are out of our control\\". I'm sorry, but  having black water come out of my shower was out of my control as well. His only offer was to comp my internet and breakfast, a total of $40.

The door man (who thinks because he's a doorman that he is god) was one of the rudest people I've come across in the service industry (which I worked for 10 years). He was actually flat out swearing at people and even threatened to kick out a paying customer who was \\"giving him attitude\\" because he walked out to make a phone call. It was appalling. But it doesn't stop at the doorman. The hostess (who I later found out was the manager) was almost equally as terrible. So much attitude from someone who is supposed to be SERVICING you. It's such a shame because the food was decently good and our waitress was a delight. But doorman and hostess were so awful that I'll never return here again.

She said, \\"They are pretty big!\\". Then she used her fingers and made a measurement around 5-6 inches.

But within 1/2 hour, I remember it was BECAUSE THE SERVICE SUCKS SO BADLY HERE!\\n\\nFirst, everything seems to be unclean to a certain extent.  Admittedly the property is really old and that's part of the charm, but there is an air of dank mouldering that rather permeates the entire experience.  I'm not saying that I need to eat every meal in the equivalent of an Intel clean room but a little effort would go a long way.  And the fire marshal would have a field day with the amount of humans squeezed into the place and lack of passable aisles to provide any kind of ingress or egress. But I digress....\\n\\nSecondly, the desert was ok.  I appreciated the freshness of the fruit (especially in winter) but the desert wasn't anything I couldn't have whipped up at home.  They had no lemons for hot water or tea (seriously, a coffee and tea house without lemons?) and I had to wonder when was the last time they laundered their funky \\"napkins\\".\\n\\nBut finally, the coup de grace was the service.  We were some of the first ones in just after 7 and we waited for someone to take our order.  The deserts came really quickly (but really how hard is it to cut cake, scoop ice cream and fill a parfait glass?).  But we waited nearly 1/2 hour to have our check TAKEN.  Not to be brought but to be TAKEN.  Yes, the service is so bad here, they are even slow to take your hard earned cash.  And it was cash, not a card they had to run or get approval on.  My eating partner actually had to flag someone down to take money from us.  Absolutely ridiculous.\\n\\nSo if you have tons of time to kill, by all means, enjoy yourself at Rimsky's.

It was fun cooking everything and I improved my chopstick skills throughout the course of the night. \\n\\nThe scallops and the dumplings were the standouts for me and the dipping sauce was delish. \\n \\nThe reason I'm giving 4 rather than 5 stars is because I was expecting the meal to be $21.95 per person but it came out to be $30 per person and we ordered some things but didn't receive them.

Personally, I've grown tired of scallops at finer dining, but it always seems to be a centerpiece for many a restaurant starter. It is here at Benatti's, however, that the freshest, tastiest sea scallops are made. I was really impressed by this particular starter. Soaked in an orange juice reduction and spinach, the flavor was bright, lively, and the antithesis of the dreary weather that awaited us outdoors. \\n\\nMy friend ordered the gnocchi while I chose the pan-seared yellowtail snapper. The gnocchi was soft and fluffy, good through and through while the yellowtail was firm, well prepared with saffron vinagrette. \\n\\nOverall, very pleased with Benatti and during my next trip to Boston, will certainly return.

That can't be doing the wine and good.\\n\\nBut I decided to eat anyway, since the food was really what I came for.  I started off with the scallop lollipops.  There were three of them and boy were they small.  My next course was the small cheese board, consisting of three small chunks of cheese.  My three were cheddar, pecorino, and emmanthaler.  It also came with a couple of bunches of grapes and some candied nuts.  The nuts were the best of the bunch.\\n\\nThe long and the short of it was that it was just okay, but not good enough to bring me back."},{"name":"Joe's On Juniper","address":"1049 Juniper St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Well, it failed it's health inspection.

I went with a regular, whose order they screwed up (putting the wrong sauce on wings). There is a frizzy haired blonde southern lady who is a manager. She will stand out - just look for the hair and listen for the accent. Anyway, he informed her of the mistake and she insisted that they gave him what he ordered. She was wrong. He and I both knew, and she didn't even look at it. The next time he was there, the waiter recognized him and told him that he was right that they had given him the wrong order.

We saw a cockroach here two days ago, and the restaurant manager seems not to care their hygiene at all and ignores us. An alive cockroach hidden between a pile of deep fried bean curd sheets was awaken by us at very beginning of our dinning here and began to roam around the plate. It indicates a horrible restaurant hygiene. A waiter saw it and asked us if we want another plate of the bean curd sheets. However, we would assume not only one living cockroach is around the kitchen, so we said no. The waiters and the owner/manager seem not to care too much about the cockroach and just leave us there without any word about cockroach or sorry anymore. Then we felt we cannot eat anymore at this restaurant although we were still hungry. We asked for the check. The waitress gave us the check without any apology about the cockroach. Since it is a buffet restaurant, the waitress assume we have to pay the full amount for these insanitary food. So I just asked I would like to talk to the owner without even mentioning the cockroach. She realized it and went inside for a while and told us \\"the owner is not here, but the manager said you can have 20% off.\\" The manager didn't show up. When I asked again to the waitress that I wanted to see the manager, she just ignored me. We ended up paying $40 for two people and 20% tip for our original waitress (since our original waitress is a nice girl, the other waiter and waitress I mentioned above are other people. They always have many waiters around). We don't have a chance to complaint the sanitary to the owner and the manager, and ask them to improve it. So I decide to post here in case you could have a better reaction when you still insist to dine in here and see the cockroach around. \\"0\\" star for their dirty dining environment, and irresponsibility and indifference to their customers."},{"name":"Texican Cafe - Manchaca","address":"11940 Manchaca Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This location has great service and warm atmosphere.

If nothing else the electric blue chairs were intriguing and a factor in my choice. \\n\\nOn our arrival at around 7ish, we were seated immediately as there was only a couple other tables occupied.\\n\\nWe started with beverages. I went for wine. The list was limited in selection but did have some nice choices. I will say, what the list lacked in content was not lost in price point!! WOW, they don't give away their wine!\\n\\nFor food we started with appies. We shared the Bacon & Onion Alsatian Tart and the Dungeness Crab Cake. Both were very tasty. The tart was a nice size for sharing but I must say the Crab Cake was a huge disappointment. It came nicely presented but without a doubt the smallest crab cake I have ever seen. It should be re-named a Crab Bite. And for $14 they should be ashamed. \\n\\nFor the main course be both had the Line-Caught Halibut. It was pan seared then finished in the oven. The fish was delicious and cooked to perfection. As the menu clearly stated, the halibut was served with \\"kabosha squash ravioli\\". Note the single tense in ravioli. YOU GET ONE!! The dish overall was very nice but once again.....very small portions for the price point.\\n\\nAs you have probably already guessed, I was still hungry so opted to go for desert. I had the White Chocolate Cr√®me Brul√©e. There really isn't much for choices on the desert menu. My partner had casually mentioned that it was my birthday so the server presented my Cr√®me Brul√©e with a b-day candle inserted. Woohooo! It was actually a nice sized serving and quite yummy. \\n\\nOverall we enjoyed our dining experience. Loved the room and the food was great. Our only real complaint was the portion sizes, especially the crab cake.

Only 30 minutes earlier, we'd been given the upgrade of the century at our resort, the Grand Floridian and I was so excited to try the new restaurant at the Contemporary, which was the resort we almost stayed at, and would like to stay at sometime soon.\\n\\nBoy, I wanted to like this place, but I just didn't.  \\n\\nLet's start with the atmosphere.  The entrance was awesome.  So chic.  Its chic-ness was only matched by the bar and bar area.  In hindsight, we should have asked to eat in there.  The actual dining room itself was boring.  The walls were beige, there were dark wood beams and if I recall correctly, there were flashes of red, attempting an Asian feel.  I'll rate that attempt as a fail.  \\nThe service was also mediocre at best.  Our server was friendly enough, but she was pretty useless otherwise.  We were on the Disney Dining Plan for the first time, and were admittedly a bit confused as to how it worked, but she didn't seem to know how it worked either.  It took forever to get the bill settled.  Speaking of taking forever, she disappeared a lot.  This would have been acceptable, had there been more than 5 people in the restaurant.  \\n\\nHere's a heads-up to Disney Diners.....THERE ARE PLENTY OF TABLES AT THE WAVE!  IF LE CELLIER DOESN'T WORK OUT FOR YA....HEAD OVER TO THE CONTEMPORARY.\\n\\nBack to our server.  She was pretty useless, but nice.  I don't think there's much more to say.\\n\\nFor dinner, I had the Angus Chuck Bacon Cheeseburger on a multi-grain roll with roasted potato wedges  The bread tasted like cardboard and my burger, which I had asked for medium, was cooked completely through and bordered dangerously on overcooked.  Another fail.   The potato wedges were exactly that.  Not fries-cooked potatoes cut into wedges.  Healthier than fries?  Yes.  What I was looking for?  No.  \\n\\nThe alcohol and dessert fared better.   I had the Antioxidant Cocktail and it was delicious.  The trio of sorbets for dessert were also wonderful and our server, noting that I enjoyed the tea I ordered, gave me several extra tea bags to return to my room with.  That was appreciated.\\n\\nI would actually like to try it here again and see if perhaps this lunch was a fluke.  At the very least, I plan on drinking here again in the future."},{"name":"The Storm Crow Tavern","address":"1305 Commercial Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Cheap and tasty food, great events, and friendly staff.

We waited about 15 minutes to be seated, which was fine since the hostess quoted us 30 minutes. When we got to our table, we instantly got a vibe that the waiter was rushing us. He asked if we wanted an appetizer immediately after taking our drink orders, and we had barely sat down, let alone looked at menus.  Ironically, the waiter was rushing us, but then he took forever to come back with things that we requested, such as: straws, napkins, my line sister Tyy's strawberry lemonade, change, etc. Tyy did not get her drink until a second reminder and brought her a empty cup instead of a To-go cup of lemonade. None of us received refills or were asked, for that matter. The food was probably the only decent thing about the experience and there were some mess ups with that too. My 3 year old loved his Kid's Pasta and fruit. My Cobb Salad was tasty, and I ordered it with Salmon. On a negative note, I enjoyed the Friday's sampler, except one of my mozzarella sticks was missing cheese, so it was like one fried piece of batter. I told the waiter about that and he acknowledged it, but he did not do anything about it. That was annoying. My line sister Tierra's fries were cold. Right before it was time to go, I got the waiter's attention to tell him it was my line sister Angelica's birthday, to see if we could surprise her with a dessert, and he said \\"Nah, we usually don't do anything, but I can get a birthday sundae\\". So, I said \\"okay great\\". With it being a surprise, I was trying to be discreet, but he never came back with the sundae, and our kids were starting to get restless so we ended up leaving without it. Also, most of us tipped with cash, but the birthday girl gave a $20, and was owed like $8 and the waiter kept coming back to the table without the change, so that was kind of aggravating because the kids were ready to go, and we thought he was killing time to bring the dessert, but it ended up being that he was just being forgetful.

I have been trying to convince my team to come to the \\"nerd bar\\" for a while.  It's funny how your friends will let their inner nerd shine when they enter a place like Storm Crow.  They start admitting to liking certain shows, books, games etc.  Anyhow, the team was actually pleasantly surprised by Storm Crow, and so was I.\\n\\nThe best part for me was the availability of gluten free menu items, and a knowledgeable server who was happy to help point out everything safe to eat and offer suggestions.  This was a huge bonus and relief for us, since the Charlatan down the street has been less than helpful in that regard every time we go there after floor hockey.  So points for Storm Crow right off the bat.\\n\\nNow, I'm not into Star Trek, Dr. Who, or any anything like that.  I do love Game of Thrones/Song of Ice and Fire dearly, however.  And while the tavern is decorated with armour, swords, laser guns, crossbows and other items, it wasn't as nerdy as I was expecting.  No one was serving giant pints of beer dressed as an elf and barbarians didn't serve me my food.  So I really didn't feel out of place here at all.  In fact, the whole place had a very welcoming vibe, was easy going, and they seemed truly accepting of whoever wanted to come hang out and get a beer or food.  Which was nice, because we were in shorts and it was snowing outside, so must have looked crazy.  I actually really liked the feel of the space, and the friendly service.  We all commented on how nice it was and felt this could be our new post-floor hockey hangout.  \\n\\nOf course, with a $6 menu, we had to try food.  As mentioned, yeah, portions are small, but it makes for fun sharing if you order a few items.  And for $6 each, why not?  The best thing we tried were the chickpea fries.  And they are totally gluten free!  These were similar to polenta fries but with an earthy taste.  I really liked them.  The rest was just okay.  Nothing to write home about, as my friend said, but decent for the value.  We had the ratatouille and the beet salad.  Other people at the table had the french onion soup, a couple stews, and the beef brisket sandwich.  All were satisfied, but nobody was wowed by the food.  \\n\\nDrinks were not cheap like the food, but I guess they have to make their money somewhere.  Overall, though, drink prices were average for the area.  And they had mead.  Which I adore and so very rarely see.  Though a 4 oz. glass would have been nice rather than a 3 oz.  Merridale apple cider is also available and is another favourite I rarely see, so props for that.  And they had an okay selection of beers available.  Maybe another cider option would be good, for the gluten free folks. \\n\\nOverall, I really enjoyed Storm Crow.  One of these days I'll play one of the many board games available and geek out for an evening.  For now, it will be a great place to come after playing some hockey.  Step up the quality of the food a notch and they are looking at 5 star glory.\\n\\nEdit: I stand corrected.  I was served by an elf last night.

At first glance, the light brown bundt cake I saw in the box was so plain-looking with merely some powdered sugar dusted over it.  There was no fancy frosting or icing.  I was quickly reminded that you cannot judge a book by its cover!\\n\\n* Chocolate Chip Pound Cake ($26) - Per the menu description, this 9\\" round bundt cake is a \\"sour cream based pound cake with chocolate chips in it.\\"  Sounds pretty boring, right?  WRONG.  I cut myself a small piece of it because I didn't want to fill up with something I may not like.  As soon as I bit into it, I knew this was not the plain, boring bundt cake I thought it would be.  The outer layer of the cake was a light brown and slightly crisp, while the inside was perfectly moist.  I loved that it was just as sweet as it needed to be, no more, no less.  Although I wanted more, I knew I shouldn't since I was about to have half a brownie...\\n\\n* Brownies ($15/dozen) - I love the menu description: \\"These decadently rich chocolate cream cheese brownies might possibly be the best brownie on the planet.\\"  Chocolate cream cheese brownies?  Never heard of such a thing before.  But WOW!  I was blown away by how good this brownie was!  I split my brownie with a co-worker, but I regretted doing so after tasting it.  I couldn't specifically taste the \\"cream cheese\\" in the brownie, but it had a wonderful, chewy texture and was one of the best brownies I have had in quite some time!\\n\\nOverall, Piece of Cake gets 4.5 stars for their wonderful Chocolate Chip Pound Cake and delicious Brownies.  I can't quite give them 5 stars before I get to try their Red Velvet Cake.  Once I do (and who knows when that will be), I will be happy to update and add a star to my review.  Craving some of the Chocolate Chip Pound Cake right now and can't wait to eventually taste the Red Velvet.  =)\\n\\n[Review 253 of 366]"},{"name":"Suerte","address":"1800 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"It's loud, hipster, and the best place I ate in Austin! \\n\\nWe came at happy hour, which was terrific, because we could try multiple small plates for $5 each.

Turns out The Greek Village was once The Indian Village (them cosmopolitan restauranteurs...)  Ironic, cuz I was gonna go from reviewing this to Memories of India!\\n\\nThe place was busy for a Tuesday, and it took a couple of minutes to seat us.  \\"Waiter\\" Evie (sp?) turned out also to the the chef, who has to do double duty because his girlfriend is away.  He was friendly and accommodating.  When we did not care for a taste of the first wine he brought, he opened another, which was much better (will have to get name, take picture of the menu, wine-list etc.)  Having heard rave reviews of the octopus, we had to order it.  At $9.95, it's pricey for an appetizer, but not when you consider the portion size.  I mean, we're talking enough tentacles to bring down a small hapless vessel at sea - I'd say OK to share among 4 people.  Being in a hurry, we wouldn't have ordered it had we known; it's a much better choice for leisurely dining.  Not that it was tough or chewy.  The more tender parts really are proverbally \\"like chicken\\", while the fleshy tentacles had a little more fight in them. It had a great smoky punch from the grill, but I found the lemon-y marinade rather one-dimensional - a few notches too tart and too salty for my taste.  I'm also thinking that maybe I shouldn't be feeding the octopus harvest (read SLAUGHTER) by feeding on the \\"Eight-clawed fish\\".  I once saw a TV program that highlighted this critter's problem-solving skills.  Made me just slightly uneasy.\\n\\nYour entrees come with a side (soup or salad, I think).  Again, since a few had written about the lemon soup, we both opted for that - fragrant silky broth that had well-boiled grains of rice in it, even if the taste itself was again simplistic.  For our main, my wife had the combo, while I (foolishly?) chose the \\"Greek lasagna\\", which in hind sight was doomed by the cheesy, goo-ey, saucy expectations conjured up by the 'L' word.  My wife chose the combo platter.  The gyro was tasty, even if the tzatziki was a smidgeon on the bland side.  Moussaka was good, as was the stuffed grape leaves...but I was distracted by the self-inflicted kicks: for such avowed lamb lovers, why didn't we order any lamb?

They have fundraisers for important causes.\\n\\nWhat I wasn't quite as fond of were the clientele.  I got a few looks for not wearing the required uniform that goes with this culture. Apparently I do not have enough tattoos or piercings either.  One person was blocking the way to the bathroom and I had to ask 2 times for him to move, and he was not in line.  There is that definite junior high vibe about needing to fit the image. It wasn't coming from the staff and I hate to deduct points from them but it can be uncomfortable for some people.  (Though I have to admit I found it a bit comical).\\n\\n\\nWorker-owned and vegan are both pluses to me. And around the corner from the vegan mini-mall. I will go back for some of the fundraisers."},{"name":"Sushi Katana","address":"4192 Conroy Rd, Ste 103","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"I love this sushi spot!!!

I couldn't really tell what exactly a mozzarella bar was from their website or pictures, and no one wrote about it in their review, so I was hoping it wasn't just a gimmick. Sadly, that's exactly what it is. \\n\\nThe mozzarella bar is: a 2 seat counter where you can eat. They don't make it in front of you, it's not a buffet where you can sample different kinds, there's nothing at all that would elude to anything resembling a mozzarella bar. Nope. It's a 3 item list on their menu that you can order, each kind individually. You can order buffalo, fiore di latte (no clue what that is), or Burrata. You can't get a little of each, no sampler. Needless to say, the \\"mozzarella bar\\" is complete false advertising and a major disappointment. :(\\n\\nThat being said, however, the food was good. My friend and I ordered the Burrata (mozzarella with a ricotta like center) and it came with an arugula salad and flatbread. It was excellent and I highly recommend it. \\n\\nWe also ordered the Italiano pizza which had arugula, prosciutto, cherry tomatoes, fresh shaved Parmesan, and drizzled evoo. It was delicious and I would order this again for sure! There were 3 slices left and we \\"fought\\" over who got to take 2 slices home vs. 1. (I lost.)\\n\\nWe also shared an order of the spinach and ricotta ravioli. This was not that great. It said that everything was made in house, but it definitely did not taste homemade. The filling was ho-hum, the dough was ho-hum, and the marinara sauce was ho-hum. Neither of us cared for it and neither of us wanted to take home the leftovers. \\n\\nBecause that wasn't enough food, we decided to share a few deserts too. We got cannoli and tiramisu. The cannoli came with two huge ones and they were \\"meh, okay.\\" The shells were a little stale, and the filling was very plain and did not have much flavor. I'm not much of a tiramisu fan so I'm not a great judge of how it really was, but it was definitely not the best one I've ever had. In my opinion, you can skip dessert here. \\n\\nAtmosphere - 5\\nService - 5\\nMozzarella bar - 0\\nBurrata - 5\\nItaliano pizza - 5\\nSpinach ravioli - 2\\nTiramisu - 2\\nCannoli - 2\\n\\nI'd definitely go back!"},{"name":"Mohr & McPherson Caf√©","address":"460 Harrison Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Great spicy chai to warm up a winter afternoon.

The chicken, after all, did taste all right, although about halfway through I started becoming overwhelmed by the sweet and tangy sauce. But the service was good (they let all ten of us get separate bills), and the agedashi tofu a co-worker shared with me was, at worst, middle-of-the-road.

We all agreed that we wish they had a charcuterie board with some of each of the items instead of separate. Of the two I preferred the cheese board. The meat board to me seemed very repetitive in their selections.   For dinner the three entrees we had were the filet, the buffalo and the fish. All were good however none were wow factors for me. I had the steak which was very well seasoned you didn't need a sauce with it. I choose the Mac n cheese as my side. I expected this to be amazing and it wasn't it was missing something in the cheeses in it. My mom had the buffalo which was good but the sauce paired with it we all agreed was awful it didn't do anything for the meat and was overpowered by lemon taste. She said it would have been better if there was a sauce that complimented it. She chose the Brussels sprouts as her side which were good. Lastly our friend got the fish which was cooked and served in parchment paper. He really enjoyed this however my mom and I didn't care for it.

The interior decor had me hopeful that we'd get some great tex-mex, but there are probably 500 Mexican restaurants in Austin that are better than this place.  The salsa had the consistency and taste of tomato sauce, no flavor or kick at all.  The queso tasted like what you get at Taco Cabana, but the chips were not as good.  You had to pay $2 to get chips and salsa, which should be complementary.  The migas were a mushy mess that had raw corn tortillas with no noticeable onions, tomatoes or peppers mixed in, topped with the same flavorless cheese.  I didn't think you could mess up eggs, but I guess you can. Even the refried beans and potatoes lacked flavor.  My husband had breakfast tacos that were ok, but still not nearly as good as some of the food trucks on 71.  He also said the coffee was bad.

Neither of us enjoyed the food or overall experience here.\\n\\nWe went with high hopes, but were disappointed at almost every level.\\n\\n1. AMBIENCE - partly because of Yelp's mention of its outdoor seating, and partly because we had not dined here yet, we decided to go tonight, a beautiful 80-degree night with a light breeze.  Upon arriving, though, we were said to see only 3 small outdoor tables, and they were on the Lamar side.  Very small, flimsy tables and very, very noisy.  We decided to move, with our 9-month old, inside.  Inside dining was better although the lack of some kind of music or vibe made the place seem empty and generic.\\n\\n2. CHILD ACCOMMODATIONS - This is NOT a good place for kids, despite Yelp claiming that it is, for two major reasons:  First of all, ALL FOUR of their high-chairs were broken - 3 of them had broken straps, and the other one was structurally falling apart and would not stand up right.  Secondly, there is not any type of child-friendly menu, and due to the unusual taste and texture of much of Dim Sum, children are not likely to take to the food easily.\\n\\n3.  THE FOOD - Most importantly, we were quite disappointed at the quality of the food.  Some of the items were good, but most were 'blah' at best.  Unfortunately the experience was so poor I have nothing good to say about the food.  No beer or alcohol was sold there, either, to help clear the tastes out of my mouth.  I rushed home and brushed my teeth to free my taste buds from their distress.\\n\\n4.  THE SERVICE - The service was fairly good, although I felt the walk-up ordering process was a bit awkward.  Additionally, a worker that helped with the high chairs admitted they were mostly broken but then proceeded to hand me the worst chair of them all - the one whose wooden parts were coming apart and that was unstable.\\n\\nAll in all, I give this a big thumbs DOWN.  I will not go here again nor would I recommend this place.\\n\\nDim Sum was a new type of food for me, but not for my wife-- and we're both into international cuisine of all types and not afraid to try much.  But the disappointing food-- from the traditional chinese items such as potstickers and hot & sour soup to the dim sum items-- combined with the overall ambience/child accomodation issues will keep us far from Get Sum Dim Sum."},{"name":"Boston Tea Stop","address":"54 Jfk St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"BTS is a great place to get a delicious drink and hang out with friends.

Bottom Line - check this place out for some tasty sushi and interesting takes on Japanese Classics.\\n\\nThe long version:\\n\\nI've been to One Sushi + several times and always leave happy. The atmosphere inside is very modern and every detail has been thought about. The tables, art on the walls, and even the chopsticks are made of metal. The glasses have a tilt to them which I think is pretty interesting (though can make drinking out of them difficult sometimes). \\n\\nThe only downside here is price but it's a sushi restuarant so you are expecting to be expensive. Some items though are ridiculous like the $4 Miso soup, come on guys lower that price - it's hot water and miso paste essentially. On my last trip I did the Sushi Sashimi platter and it was amazing! It had several kinds of nigiri and Sashimi on the plate. The presentation was beautiful and the fish tasted very fresh. I think it might be my new go to at this place. Some other rolls that stand out are Sex in the City, Picante, She-Sho Fresh, and Gangam Style which has short ribs! \\n\\nAll in all, this a perfect place if you're craving high quality sushi and definitely worth the trip regardless of where you live in Atlanta.

I arrived back at the breakroom at work with a good portion of medium rare steak, mashed potatoes with gravy, and a creamy pile of macaroni and cheese (apparently I had been starch-deprived beforehand).  My little lunch was the envy of the table.  However, I was surrounded by only slack-jawed disbelievers when the answer to their query about the origins of my lunch was Doc Green's.

Check my photo - the portions are not \\"pig out\\" style - they're reasonably sized.\\n\\nI dare say the bbq was better than 4 Rivers! The ribs were moist, tender, and had an excellent smoky bark.  I found a coriander seed on the ribs, so the rub has some nice components to it and coated with savory glaze.  The sliced pork had a similar sauce to the ribs, were fairly lean, and tender. Also, the collards and peas were excellent sides.  I would give the jalapeno cornbread edge to 4 Rivers though.  The little cupcake was tiny, but pretty good.\\n\\nI've tried them for dinner and you really can't miss.  I would suggest getting an app or 2 and splitting the giant pork porterhouse.

Ever.\\n\\nI'm not a big sweets or cake person, but Piece of Cake's Red Velvet cake is amazing.  It's highly addictive and I can never have enough.  The cake has the perfect amount of moistness, delicious flavor, and ideal proportion of icing.  The icing is my favorite part.  Normally, one would get sick from eating too much icing, but that's not the case with Piece of Cake's icing.  It's rich, smooth, and creamy.  It's heavy too, but that's what makes their cakes so good.  They don't make any fat free or sugar free cakes.  I had leftover cake for days afterwards and it tasted just as great as the first day I ate it.  I recommend finishing the cakes sooner rather than later, though.  They do not refrigerate well.\\n\\nPiece of Cake has five locations in metro Atlanta and they ship nationwide.  They offer about a half dozen different pound cakes along with seasonal cakes.  Pound cakes are $26 and feed 10-15 people.  They offer eight different kinds of layer cake at  $23 for medium (6-8 people) and $32.50 for large (15-18 people).  Some of the cakes, like the aforementioned Red Velvet, are available in sheets that feed 20-25 for the same price as a large layer cake.  It's a good deal, but you have to pre-order.  Along with cakes, Piece of Cake also sells cookies, coffee, cupcakes, and other treats.\\n\\nThe cakes are gourmet, but they aren't overly fancy or intricate.  They're tried-and-true cakes made well and baked with high quality ingredients.

In fact, the vegetarian dishes surprised me with all the flavor and I could easily just eat a whole plate of that, next time.  Note that I was also famished, having been trapped in meetings all morning long, so I ate the whole steaming hot plate of food in less than five minutes (so I didn't really linger on the flavors), and also guzzled down a bottle of water cause some of it was pretty spicy.

I stopped in again later in the week for lunch, and got a slice of veggie/ricotta pizza, and again - wow! This was even tastier than the veggie pizza I had. Maybe because this pizza was out of the oven for a bit, and the flavors had time to meld together.  \\n\\nOverall, this is a great place for an inexpensive meal that really fills you up.

Being brown I was underwhelmed by the chicken tikka - I'm not sure why the chicken is fried and the sauce is good but it's not chicken tikka. Also the rice was a carb overload for the taco. The grilled shrimp with fried cheesy grits were DELICIOUS!! The unusual combination in a taco form just worked so perfectly. Only downside was the giant pieces of half cooked tomato inside - not a fan. The tater tots were pretty bad.

It was our first time at Sage so we asked about the Bottomless Mimosa Brunch and his response was \\"Have y'all not ever had bottomless mimosas before?\\" Next, we were asked for a card to hold which is fine (I'm a 7 year Bartender, I get it.) however, no other patron that came to the bar was asked for a card to hold which is a bit discriminatory to say the least, but okay.\\n\\nWe were introduced to another server who stated he was new, which was fine, again, my friend and I are service industry as well, so we get it. It was not busy at all when we got there so for service to be a bit slow, was interesting.\\n\\nThe food was really good! The Bellinis were awesome and the live jazz added a nice touch to the atmosphere.\\n\\nMy biggest issue is how management tried to fix a discrepancy, (my card was charged 3x and then another card was charged for the same transaction) and there was no empathy. The first manager who handled it was very helpful but the second manager over the phone had a hard time listening which caused miscommunication and a lot of frustration. I was JUST trying to gain clarity on which card had the right charges and which one didn't. It was a lot of backtalk and rebuttals from the manager on the phone which that resulted in me still not getting a clear answer. \\n\\nAlso, instead of getting my car, the valet stood there and chatted amongst themselves instead of going to get my car. Again, it was NOT busy yet, and we waited 5-8 minutes for the car to come up. \\n\\nOverall, I know this place has a great feel and it is in a great location. I just wanted to express my concerns with my first experience so that this won't happen again. We had high hopes of returning next week with more friends from out of town. With a bit more training, (ex: champagne bottles were touching glass rims during refills) this can be a premiere brunch spot.

We were so sad that we were being treated so poorly in one of our favorite places. I don't think it would have affected us so much but we realized it was a pattern. Then another nice couple came in and the man behind the counter seemed overjoyed by their presence and greeted them nicely and said \\"what can I get you\\" after asking them how they were doing. Maybe the difference between us and this couple was the fact that they had dreads and gauged ears and we were dressed a little preppy. I'm not sure.

I think they kept this in mind in the design, and it shows.\\n-Breakfast sandwiches!  And all day long!  Oh, if only Diesel had breakfast sandwiches, too.\\n-The owners have been really trying to respect both the environment friendly and their new neighborhood.  A move towards using more environmentally-friendly practices in addition to attempting to be as community-inclusive as possible (for a new business that will most likely contribute to the gentrification of the immediate area) is commendable, considering that these things are not requirements for businesses.  If the area is moving towards gentrification, I hope more places follow Bloc 11's lead.\\n\\nCons:\\n-The hipsters flock to Union Square.  With the Green Line on its way, it was bound to happen as soon as a coffee shop opened.  Alas, here we are.\\n-The vault thing weirds me out.  I think it's a great concept, but sitting in a vault definitely has its claustrophobic moments.  Good thing there are plenty of seating alternatives.  \\n-Prices are still pretty steep.  The prices for a sandwich here are just as steep as Diesel.  But I suppose the quality and freshness makes up for it.  You definitely get what you pay for...though you might need about $7 to get a bite.\\n\\nBottom line: Check it out.  It's not another Diesel, and it's definitely worth the trek.

This was our second visit.  We had the charcuterie and ceviche for appetizers. The charcuterie was a great choice for 4.  Lots of cured meats, a couple of cheese items and some slices of bread and pickled veggies.  Everyone loved this one. The ceviche serving was small and expensive at $15 and  unremarkable.  I've had better elsewhere.  The salad was great with an excellent herb vinaigrette.  One of my sons thought it was the best dinner salad he had ever had.  It was one of the best for me. For entrees, everyone loved what they ordered.  Between us we had the lobster and short rib--very flavorful, but a small serving size with an interesting foamed sauce that tasted like a sherry based lobster bisque; the 16oz pork porterhouse--a gigantic piece of broiled pork chop that seem marinated and was very tasty; flounder with crab meat--very-very good; and finally duck which also was outstanding.  We skipped dessert as between the shared appetizers, salad and entrees, we were all very full.  We also skipped the alcohol this time for personal reasons. On another occasion  we had drinks and wine. They have an inventive list of drinks and a good wine list.  Parking for the valet was very quick.  Staff at all levels is friendly. Service was perfect.

It was actually pretty good. But food is not everything when you go out to dinner. We had reservations for a table at 5 at 830 at night. We got there and they said they were waiting for our table to clear. Not a big deal its a Friday night and we were not in a rush. So we got sat at our table and the waiter came and took our order and was very friendly. We were waiting for the 5th person to get there before we ordered any type of food. So we ordered drinks.  The drinks were very EXPENSIVE. 11.00 for a drink is just crazy here in Austin. But we got one anyways. So our friend came and we ordered the two appetizers when our friend sat down. The appetizers were out before our friends drink that she ordered. It was very very quick. Not that that is bad. But it all started going down hill from there. The waiter would come over almost every couple minutes to see if we wanted to order. We did not even get our first couple of bits of appetizers. So we all agreed to get him to stop coming over we would quit talking and figure out what we wanted. And he came back and we ordered. We got tuna, chicken, some salads, mussels, and more drinks. The feed came out way to quick. This is the fastest meal that ever has came out. Honestly less than 5 minutes. And i am sure that would be great if we were in a rush. But the problem was we had 3 bites of both of our appetizers and our food came out. So we all had to decide do we eat the appetizers and let of expensive dinners get cold or forget about the appetizers and eat our 25.00 meals. Well we ate our meals. So our appetizers were a complete waist. They ended up taking them off the table and they were almost completely full. We were very rushed by the waiter. We all started getting pissed because it seemed like he just wanted to turn the table to another party. But there was no one waiting for tables so maybe he was ready to get is Friday on.  Well it really pissed us off because we had no option on the tip we could give him because since there were 5 of us they automatically added 18% and i have to say it was not worth 18% tip. Now the review on the food. It was good. But to pay 18.00 for a small piece of chicken breast it was not worth it. And again the drinks were 11.00 and when you have 3 or 4 of them it ads up.

You don't go to Casa Del Matador for authentic Mexican (let alone \\"Tex Mex\\"). People come here for more than food. They're here for a good time. And depending on how the night is going, Casa Del Matador might just be the perfect venue for it.\\n\\nThere is a bit of a corporate / franchise-y feel here. It's not exactly a Mexican casa meets dive bar, but more of an darkly lit saloon meets Carrabba's. As a result, tequila and taquito novices can approach with no intimidation and for this being their first location in Portland, they seem to have done quite well. There's even another location on the east side, which has literally the same look and feel.\\n\\nLet's get our drink on shall we? Margaritas, Patron shots, and Mexican beer are all available for libation lovers and lushes in training. They have specialty cocktails and various tequilas for students majoring in mezcal. The 4-6pm happy hour is extended to their food, which for $4-5 each, one can score some serious plates of mile high nachos to Tex Mex egg rolls. I like their habanero prawns, even though there are only like 2 or 3 per order. Thankfully like all good NW happy hour specials, it extends into the late evening from 10pm-1am.\\n\\nHappy Hour food plates aren't enough? Then dive right in for lunch / dinner, where the platters range from $10-25 each. It feels spendy for Mexican food naturally, but the \\"gourmet Tex Mex\\" tag they're pushing is a much safer alternative than having venturing out of one's way only to order in Spanish at some dive across town. Fear not gringritos, there are skillet seared fajitas ($15-17) and taco/enchilada combinaciones at your disposal. Vegetarians, portobello mushrooms are available as a filler option.\\n\\nGroups, you've found the right spot. They have a massive 40 seat private room and plenty of tables spaced out for you and your amigos to find some separation for a fiesta only bebidas alcoholicas can provide. Solo diners, don't be intimidated, but don't bring your laptop thinking this is a chill place to do work either.\\n\\nIf there is a handicap, it's the service. The less than warm attitude from the staff has been the biggest deterrent since I started coming years ago.

I stopped going because I felt they were leaning toward the club or party environment than a restaurant.  Yesterday I decided to try it again, after not going in a year.  \\n\\nThe hostess stand was super friendly and nice.  My server was nice and attentive until she got another table.  She spent a lot of time talking to to them.  I do not believe she knew them, but that they were attention demanding.  As a result of their attention demand our service lacked.\\nOur food was just ok.  The \\"steamed\\" broccoli was either steamed from frozen broccoli or reheated after being steamed earlier. It was rubbery and a disappointment.\\n\\nConsidering we ate at 4:45pm on a Tuesday and they were not busy, I do not see why we had an issue with our food.  Or why our server did not ask for assistance when she needed it.\\n\\nMain issue I had on this visit... We asked for cocktail sauce for our shrimp.  Our server told us she would get it but began talking with the \\"demanding table\\".  Took us 10 minutes to get the sauce! We were pretty much done with our food by then!  When the bill came we were charged $0.50 for the sauce.  I have no problem with charges that are communicated!!! But to just assume I know or am ok with it, on top of making us wait for ever... no cool!\\n\\nI'm going back to avoiding this location.

Overstuffed with your choice of fillings, one will easily do the trick. I have no preferred taco, but I always include potatoes because they are cooked just how I like em!  (crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside)\\nThe chips are worth mentioning becase they do them right at Maudies.  They are the thin, crisp kind which are apt to break when you dip, but they are still my favorite.  \\nDitto on the margaritas.  If you're looking for a deal, then look elsewhere, but if you're looking for a good margarita , you could do worse.  Not too sweet and not too tart- if they use a mix then it's a good one.  I order the large because I like to drink.  A lot. \\nCase in point, in the midst of my most recent terrible hangover,  I ordered the Strait Plate with some trepidation. You see, I have always been curious about the practice of serving enchiladas with fried eggs on top, but have been afraid to try it despite numerous raves about the dish from my tex-mexpert of a dad.   Well, consider me a convert.  These beauties come out on their own plate, filled with beef, smothered in chile con carne and topped with the fried eggs.(over easy per my request)    Once punctured, the egg yolk merged with the chile con carne and created a  chili flavored hollandaise-like concoction that had me swooning, although it could've been the hangover...  \\nWhatever the cause of my swoon, you can bet that I'll be back for this dish the next time I choose to abuse my liver.  \\nThey also serve a half pound burger which is ok, but I think the meat is frozen-   and the \\"Maura's Bean Dip\\" can make a nice meal for two, or  three if you're not starving..."},{"name":"Mariscos Las Islas Marias","address":"2745 SE 82nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Not only the best seafood I've ever had, but some of the best food I've ever had in general.

Bastas has become my go-to restaurant for just about everything. When I'm busy or haven't had time to prepare dinner I swing by and indulge in the all-day happy hour, which is really more of a bar menu, but I'm still pretty happy about it. Everything on the Happy Hour menu is more than affordable. The portions are well-sized and you never feel like the food was prepared cheaply unlike in other restaurants in town where you feel second-class for ordering Happy Hour.\\n\\nHowever, Happy Hour is only part of what this wonderful restaurant offers. I love to take friends visiting from out of town to Bastas because the food is well-priced, pleases a broad audience, and the service staff seems to get as excited as you do when it's a special occasion. I took bachelorette party here for pre-drunkenness dinner and our server brought us complimentary champagnes. Even my brother, who is a very picky eater and I can agree that the steak is inventive, delicious, and a great deal for that cut of meat... my words, not his.\\n\\nThe wine list has slowly, but surely made me a lover of Italian wines. The way that the owner once explained Italian wines to me is as follows, \\"Italian wines are made to go with food and they continue to develop throughout a meal and a bottle.

I could say the same for most conversations that accompany the meal!\\" \\n\\nBastas offers excellent service from a staff that loves the restaurant, most of whom have been there for years, a wine list that opened up my Northwest-centric tastes, and a wide array of dishes, that, as the owner intends, are meant to please."},{"name":"Which Wich","address":"13450 Research Blvd, Ste 239A","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Had lunch there today..turkey sandwich and it was really good and tasty.

So this is your place to go after a dinner date gone well, and you're looking for a quieter place to talk/continue your night that isn't a bar/club.\\n\\nService here is spotty and that's because of their self-seating and wait-until-a-server-arrives-to-greet-you policy.

I had high hopes for this place as I liked the simple approach and the unique western name. We were both starving as we had to wait forever for our menus (we finally had to get up to get our own from an empty table) and then we waited some more. \\n\\nWe decided to each order our own dish which we made clear in our order, and that's where the fun began....I ordered the Pad Thai (not too creative, but that's what I was in the mood for) and he ordered the Curry with mushrooms and something else. (He's not a big pad thai fan). I'm not a big Thai curry fan, so I didn't pay too much attention to his choice at first, at least until I realized that was all we'd be eating for our main course! \\n\\nWe shared the spring rolls which were a bit greasy but tasted pretty good, even if they were quite small for two spring rolls that were cut in half to make them look bigger, I imagine. \\n\\nI would have liked a glass of wine, but since they did not have a liquor license, that was a no go. I was fine with just water as I was there for the food, after all. \\n\\nHe received his curry, which was buttery but quite tasty. Since we were both starving, he wolfed his down, and I saw my pad \\nThai delivered to the larger table that had come in and ordered a little while after us. \\n\\nSo I had to WAIT until he was finished his curry (he shared a bit with me,) until the Pad Thai was delivered. I politely asked my server about this, and I realized, that she had completely forgotten my order.  I tried to ask my date to wait a bit, but his food was getting cold, so I told him to go ahead, and I thought that I would give his dish a try.\\n\\nAt this point, he was pretty full, and then my food was finally delivered. He watched me eat my pad thai, until I knew that he was bored, and I finally just asked for a take-out container. It was tasty, but again oily. I usually ask for \\"less oil,\\" but I had just given up.  Some reviewers mentioned that the portions were small, but actually, I preferred the quality of this place over the quantity, which would have been acceptable. \\n\\nI could tell that the waitresses were working hard, but I was not accustomed to eating after my date, and not even having a drink (other than water) made the time go by that much slower. Overall, the food was good, but is it too much to ask that we all eat together? I looked around, and some bigger tables seemed to only have one dish at a time, too. I guess that's how they do it here?\\n\\nAlso, I had to wait for a bit for the one bathroom, which apparently had no tp which is why the wait, I guess. It was clean, but unbearable to enter if you know what I mean. To pass the time, I stood by the bathroom and watched them scoop out the rice, while noticing the mounds of dishes (three tiers in fact) that they would be doing later in the night. I actually felt bad for them. \\n\\nI would really like to give this place a higher rating, as the food was quite tasty, but unfortunately, the service here will prevent my return, even for take-out. Next time, I'll try the classic Thai place up the street. Poor Bob.\\n\\nps-The price of Pad Thai at $12 is MORE expensive than some of the most expensive cities in the world and not half as good!

The pastries (from Iggy's bakery, I think) are uniformly wonderful. I'm a sucker for the pecan rolls, and the brownies rival Rosie's bakery for decadence. I've even had vegan fare here that was surprisingly tasty, considering I'm mostly a carnivore. \\n\\nAnd the coffee is seriously great. I'm no coffee snob, but even I know a delicious brewed cup of joe when I taste it.\\n\\nSome comments on negative nonsense I've seen posted about this place: \\n- The music is not too loud.

So, I don't suggest sushi pieces here. \\n\\nHowever, the rest of the food was excellent.  The roll was freshly made, and wow that makes all the difference between awesome and barely edible.  I would give the yellowtail roll 5 stars.  The rice was properly done, the wrapping was done perfectly, and the fish was fresh tasting.  The salad was also very, very fresh and tasty.  The miso soup was tasty, but if you are looking for serious miso soup, this is not the place to do so.  It tasted a bit Americanized and was lacking in the back-fish flavor.\\n\\nThe ambiance could use some work, or thought, or something.  Basically it just hasn't been attended to.  It's clean.

As we were waiting for our bill, one table remarked that they had been waiting for some time along with the couple beside them and still hadn't had their order taken or drinks served.

It is a sweet corn cake topped with your choice of  chicken, pork, steak, or vegetarian. Definitely, get the pork. It melts in your mouth. Also, on top of the corn cake are tomatoes, banana peppers, avocado, romaine lettuce, and cheese. They serve it with a side of cilantro sauce, which is completely addicting. You can buy it by the bottle for $6 or $7. After my 4th time of going there, I finally ventured out of getting the Chocolo and got the Patacon. Yum! Nothing is better than lightly fried plantains with the same toppings as the Chocolo. I believe black beans were also added to the dish. It was so flavorful. I got chicken for this dish (at the recommendation of the waiter) and it was a bit dry, but still ok. \\n\\nMy friend says their lunch specials are great.

A very \\"meh\\" experience overall. \\n\\nAmbiance\\nVery cool and quirky interior. I think it's supposed to be like an Italian grandmother's house. Lots of mismatched items, random photos, and weird trinkets. It works, though. It has a fun and comfy vibe, and there's certainly plenty to look at on the walls. \\n\\nService\\nFirst, it's kinda of tricky to find this place. It's tucked away downtown next to the nationwide arena, and on the weeknight evening we went the whole area was deserted, and we weren't sure if we were in the right place. There is some metered street parking as well as a garage across the street. We were greeted and seated promptly though not particular friendly. The server was OK (can't recall her name...), but not particularly friendly or responsive. Dirty plates were often left on the table and drinks not refilled (or refilled on request neglecting to check whether others also needed refills). \\n\\nFood\\nLarge LARGE portions is what Buca is known for. A \\"small\\" will easily feed 2-3 people, so figure that in the cost as small entrees are typically $25-30. Everything is a la carte.  No soup, salad, or breadsticks included as at Olive Garden nor any sides. Just plain Italian bread in a basket with the meal. Our bills for one cocktail, two soft drinks, two small entrees, and one dessert was about $115 before tip. The peach Bellini was very good though fairly small for $10 and presented without much flair. We had the appetizer trio (breaded mozzarella, calamari, and spicy shrimp). It was average to below average. The shrimp was ok but seemed like it was cheap frozen shrimp. And what is Italian about spicy shrimp? The fried mozzarella was also just ok. The calamari was oily and generally unpleasant. For entrees we had the chicken carbonara and chicken saltimbocca. The saltimbocca was the highlight of the meal. Juicy and flavorful chicken which was very tasty. The carbonara was incredibly heavy and not like true Italian pasta carbonara which has a much lighter creaminess. The pasta was also over cooked - definitely not al dente. Lastly the tiramisu. A huge piece (as per Buca standards). It was very disappointing. The lady fingers were dry and tasteless and did not taste soaked in espresso as advertised on the menu. Quite a contrast to Olive Garden's tiramisu which is moist and the ladyfingers soaked with coffee flavor. Also, it is supposed to come with hazelnut biscotti crumbles, but it didn't. We tracked down the server after she dropped it off, and she said \\"oh yeah, we're out of those.\\"  Ok... that would've been a good thing to mention when we ordered it...\\n\\nJuju\\nOverall a very disappointing experience. Lackluster service and marginal food at best. Sad since our previous experiences with Buca have always been very good both in service and food. As such we may gave this location another try based on previous good experiences."},{"name":"Dinesty Dumpling House","address":"1719 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Soup dumplings and other dumplings were veryclean tasting.

It's essentially a glorified cafeteria, sans the meatloaf, hairnets, and octogenarian staff. \\n\\nFood: Doc Green's specializes in standard health fare, including salads, sandwiches, and light entrees. The food is by no means innovative or exceptional in flavor, but there are a variety of options and the ingredients are reasonably fresh. They also prominently post the nutritional information for each of their menu items, which is certainly an incentive for those wishing to monitor their calorie intake. \\n\\nService: Charmingly incompetent. The staff are certainly friendly, but their ability to correctly prepare non-standard items, such as the \\"build your own\\" salad, is limited. During my only visit, I also took issue with the fact that the staff member working the register charged an 18% gratuity on the bill because I was using a restaurant.com certificate. Although this is mentioned on the certificate as part of the site's standard language, I wouldn't expect a restaurant with no table service to charge a mandatory gratuity. I'll normally tip a few dollars in cash at the register in these types of places, but to be forced to pay over $5 in gratuity at a fast food restaurant is a bit extreme. These individuals are not classified as tipped workers under Georgia law and are paid the standard minimum wage. \\n\\nAtmosphere: Institutionally sterile. The tables and chairs are uncomfortable, chintzy, and mildly reminiscent of a high school cafeteria. \\n\\nCost: Inexpensive, but still not commensurate with the quality and quantity  that you could get elsewhere for the same price. Base salads cost $6-$9, but meat and additional toppings cost several dollars extra. Wraps and sandwiches are $7-$9 and entrees are all around $9. Fountain drinks range in price from $1.50 to $2 depending on the size.\\n\\nOther: Fortunately, the one thing this place has going for it is ample parking. I've never had a problem finding a spot in the section of the garage directly below Doc Green's.

This time, sadly, our pizza was a little too cold when it go to us and so not all that good.

We had a reservation but were seated in the bar area because half of the restaurant was closed off (slow night I assume).  I did put in my reservation notes that we were celebrating a birthday so I was surprised at this choice of seating - thankfully we weren't looking for anything special.  They also made no reference to the birthday celebration - I would have expected them to pay attention to the OpenTable notes for a place this nice/expensive.\\n\\nThe food was good but I wasn't blown away - there are many other Italian places in the city with better food and more reasonable prices (Scampo, Sorrellina).  The server was very nice - it was her 2nd day but she was very attentive.  At the end, we split the bill (both signed our credit card receipts) and left.  Several days later I found that I was charged for the entire bill which has since cleared onto my account - my friend still has a charge pending for half of the amount.  When I called to speak to the manager, he wasn't very helpful - he told me to get my friend to give me the money or have him call back with his credit card information because they don't have it anymore.  Apparently the slips we both signed saying we'd pay half the bill meant nothing because my friend's payment was somehow deleted which meant I had to pay the whole thing.

So after reading some reviews online, I decided to come try the $88 Peking duck. It was grossly fatty. Never seen so much fat on a duck before. A good inch of fat between the skin and meat. There was just two of us eating the duck and they gave us each a little bamboo steamer with 5 wraps in it. We ran out of wraps and asked for one more steamer, and also one more hoisin sauce. When the bill came it was surprising to see that they charged $5 for the extra wraps and $3 for the hoisin! I understand that usually more people share duck instead of just two people but at least give us enough wraps and hoisin for the duck not individual sizes for larger groups. So cheap of them to charge extra for that! Oh and also, you don't really get a second course with the duck either. Just a small bowl of soup each. While walking out we saw a pile of duck carcasses just sitting on the table. I'm sure that's where our one ended up and they used other old ones for the soup(makes sense though bc how can you make soup stock in the 10min they take your duck away). I strongly suggest not bothering getting the duck here. You can go to Sun Sui Wah or Kirin for a better two course duck(real two courses not the little bowl of soup) for less than half the price!"},{"name":"Five On Black","address":"1805 29th St, Ste 1138","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Delicious food, quick service and affordable price.

Don't worry - they're next at the firing line too.\\n\\nAs I come here at least once a week (if not twice), I cannot fault their food. Their beef brisket chow mein and their beef with scrambled egg sauce on rice noodles are just to die for. The crispy roast pork is one of the best in Vancouver. You get more bang for your buck if you get take away compared to eating in as you don't get much roast or bbq pork on your rice. Congee is also top notch.

Just because it's fried doesn't make it right.\\n\\nMy main gripe with Patt's lies in its awful service. We dined at 8PM on a Sunday, and the wait staff were extremely inexperienced.

We waited over an hour for our food which was unfortunate. Though the beer was plentiful and the authentic Irish food was truly worth waiting for. One of our party never got her ice water or hot tea, and we did ask for it several times. Just don't arrive here if you're really really hungry.

Well friends, I think I found my new spot. Suki Hanna has some of the best sushi for the price. $21.95 gets you all you can eat from the sushi bar, kitchen, and dessert! I loved the salmon and tuna. It was fresh and the perfect temperature. Most AYCE places have rice that is weird due to making it too often but they have it just right. Also with most of the AYCE places, it takes a little while. We got our food in a reasonable amount of time and it was all delicious. I do not like the paper ordering system and having to ask for a new menu every time, but it is what it is.

Folks that I was with had the chicken fried beef shoulder with tiger shrimp and they said it was one of the greatest things they have ever eaten when combined with the cheese mashed potatoes on the plate.  We started the meal with thick, perfectly fried asparagus, bacon wrapped shrimp, truffle fries and fried oysters.  They were all awesome, but the headliner was the shrimp - they're a can't miss.

I got seated right away and our waitress came over to ask about our drink order promptly.  The menu was huge, so I decided to ask the waitress for recommendation.  I decided to try the following:\\n\\n1. Cheese Bread:  These were so delicious! It was crispy and flaky with the right amount of cheese in the bread.  Definitely a must-try item. \\n\\n2.  Brazilian Fried Chicken: This dish was also very delicious.  The fried chicken was fried just right.  The chicken was also very tender in the inside.  It was also not too greasy, which was a plus.  Also, the had fried garlic on the dish, which I thought was unique and pretty tasty. \\n\\n3. Top sirloin and fries:  This was a little disappointing to me.  The sirloin tasted a little overcooked and chewy.  The fries that came with the dish was very good. \\n\\nOverall, I would come back to this place again.

Fries were standard frozen type- but still hot when they arrived.\\n\\nThe Baba Ganoush- oh. my. goodness. SO, SO good! A lot of restaurants leave too much of the charred skin on before blending, which gives it an ashy taste, but this had a nice, smoky undertone which brought out the taste of the eggplant and garlic. There were several pomegranate seeds on top, which was a nice twist. \\n\\nWhat made the meal, however, was how incredibly nice the staff was. They had forgotten the pita that came with the Baba Ganoush so I called them and, not only were they really nice about it- they brought it right over and threw in some awesome Armenian Honey Balls- which are absolutely sinful! \\n\\nI will definitely order from here again- and I really hope they add desserts to their Foodler menu-  I would definitely order them!"},{"name":"Banzai Sushi & Grill","address":"3914 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I like eating here for a quick lunch.

The sauce was rich, so save some for lunch tomorrow.  The cajun chicken sandwich is great.  On a fluffy ciabbata bread roll, the sandwich comes cut into two triangles.  I opted to pay more for a side salad over fries, but I was not impressed with the salad.

I expected there to be more strawberries, persimmons, nuts and vinaigrette. However, it was 99 percent lettuce. Very bland. My entree was also completely flavorless. I thought for sure that I had just lost my taste of smell due to allergies, but when my boyfriend tried it he also claimed it had no flavor. It was much different than his over-seasoned meal.

The four cheese pizza was DELICIOUS. so much cheese and perfectly crisp but chewy crust. I was very impressed. The BBQ chicken on the other hand was delicious in a completely opposite way. The toppings were abundant, and the caramelized onions and chicken was great. The BBQ was a little sweeter than what I usually enjoy, but it was still really good.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the tots (appetizer) and the sriracha ranch sauce that came with it was AMAZING! How come I've never heard of this brilliant combination? Definitely making this concoction at home everyday.\\n\\nThe grapefruit beer they had on draught was absolutely delicious.

We were outside in the patio, a big group of 7 girls. We were seated swiftly, and she took the drink orders, but after she dropped off the drinks, we told her we were ready to order, but she didn't come back to our table until 20+ minutes... Next, the food took SO LONG to come out! \\nHere's something funny - the waitress was carrying three plates (one in each hand and one in her arm) and while she was coming out, PLOP, one ketchup plate falls. two seconds later, PLOP another one falls, along with some fries. Waitress starts complaining that the plates were SO HOT. and PLOP a freaking SANDWICH falls...LOLLLL Honestly, I would have been fine with all this, but she didn't apologize! She just kept going \\"ooo the plates are so hot!\\" I thought SOMEONE would at least say something because they had to bring out the sandwich again which obviously took longer so my friend was waiting around while all of us started eating. A simple - \\"sorry about that\\" would have been fine...they just brought out the sandwich and gave it to her...\\nAnd obviously we had to wait forever to find our waitress for the check too.\\n\\nAnyways, the service was off this time, but I would definitely come back here since the food and drinks were splendid."},{"name":"The Matador","address":"1438 NW 23rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Aesthetically speaking, this restaurant is bad-ass, but I've never been a huge fan of their food.

We got the House Special broth, and ordered a variety of meats (lamb and various types of beef), seafood (salmon, scallops, crab, fish balls), and veggies (spinach, enoki mushrooms, bok choy). I wouldn't say anything was super high quality, but the meat was good enough and given that it's all-you-can-eat, it was a great deal. Our party seemed to like the choice ribeye and lamb the most. The seafood was okay but nothing special - I would advise just getting more meat and skip the seafood. The spinach was unexpectedly tasty after cooking in the broth. I also got a milk tea with bubbles, and it was quite good.\\n\\nCompared to other places like Q (which I've also eaten at multiple times), this place offers only one type of dipping sauce by default (whereas Q offers a variety), and overall quality of food is not quite as good as Q's. The wait so far has never been long here, at most a couple minutes (whereas at Q, I've had to wait for as long as an hour, even after calling ahead for seating).

The tacos were made on two corn tortillas a piece and, unlike some places, you'll need them both to properly wrap around the giant portion of meat they give you. \\n\\nYou'll be glad you got that generous helping of meat too, because both that I tried are great. You shouldn't judge a book by its cover, but you can easily judge a Mexican joint by it's carnitas. If it's tasty, there's a good chance that everything else is too. Romano's is no exception. The pork is juicy and tender with lots of delicious crispy bits throughout. Perfectly seasoned, though not to spicy (if you like it hot you can get them to add as much hot sauce as you'd like). The suadero was something new for me, thin sliced slow cooked brisket that I believe must have seen a little grill time (hence the crispy bits). This one was flavorful, and melt in your mouth tender. They offer a bunch of other options for taco's too. I know I'll be back soon for the campechanos, lengua, and chorizo tacos....might take me a few visits to work us the courage to try the cabeza tacos. \\n\\nThe only negative I can give them is that their delivery is a little slow, but all the food arrived hot and delicious; next time I'll probably opt for take out though."},{"name":"Hudson Grille","address":"4046 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Hudson Grille is an Atlanta-based chain serving bar / pub-style food with a totally decent bar menu.

A lot of wooden booths, tile floors, TVs on every available surface, etc. You get the idea. \\n\\nThe menu is fairly extensive. There are all your normal bar-style items like chicken wings, burgers, chili cheese tots, nachos, etc., but there is also a selection of healthier options like turkey meatballs and zucchini pasta. Pretty solid if you're trying to pick a restaurant to feed a variety of palates or cravings, which is exactly how we wound up here recently. \\n\\nOn our last visit, we started with the artichoke dip (no pic, but I'm sure you can imagine). The portion is kind of small but it was tasty and we polished off the entire bowl. \\n\\nThe BF ordered the ribeye with broccoli and mac&cheese. I'm sure it wasn't the highest quality steak we've had in recent months but it seemed to hit the spot because his plate was scraped clean. He did mention that it was cooked to order. I tasted the mac&cheese and WOW! Really tasty!\\n\\nI had the chicken tacos, which can be ordered \\"pulled\\" or \\"fried.\\" The pulled chicken was pretty good. It almost tasted like it had been smoked. The tacos come on a large platter with three soft tacos and a big side of chips and salsa.

Sean is one of the best servers I have ever met. He was so attentive to all of us. It probably helped that we were celebrating an anniversary and a birthday but, we are very thankful for his service.

All of the food was excellent, the field greens salad had excellent flavor combinations with the pears, blue cheese, and vinaigrette mixing nicely.  The Roasted Buffalo tenderloin is not for everyone, because Buffalo meat has a tendency to have a little bit of a gamey texture, but if you like venison you should be fine.  My tenderloin had just enough spices and the Blackberry Noir reduction and the Purple Potatoes made an amazing flavor combination.  Finally the cobbler, which I get every time I eat at Artist Point, is just perfect.  Seasonal berries (this time it had blackberries, raspberries, and blueberries) and cobbler crumbles with a raspberry ice cream is just amazing to eat at the end of your meal.\\n\\nOur server was also courteous, and even brought a champagne toast to us because he noticed our anniversary buttons that Disney gave us.  He was also very knowledgeable and gave my wife a good run-down of each item in order to help her make her food choice, considering how picky she can be.\\n\\nI also like how the meal does not seem rushed at this restaurant, and you can take in the Copland music that is playing in the background."},{"name":"Mother Juice","address":"100 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I love Mother Juice, and regularly visit the Kendall Sq & BPM locations.

Goodbye Santa Fe Turkey on delicous farmhouse wheat. \\n\\nThere are a lot of other options though and I have never had anything from them that I hated. You do have to clearly specify to go light on the dressing/sauce unless you like your sandwich/wrap/walkabout to be more dressing than substance. If you're in the mood for a salad they have a pretty decent salad bar although I find all of the salad dressings to be pretty disgusting (I get a side of hummus instead, which seems odd, but works well for me). \\n\\nThere always seems to be a line, but they are very efficient and I have never waited for more than a few minutes.

I also ordered a house marg which wasn't very exciting and a little too sweet for my taste.  Sure, it's only a house marg, but they could do better.  The chips and salsa were also mediocre, which is always a sign of what you're in store for at any Mexican restaurant.\\n\\nOverall I had a good time with my friends despite the noise, and the bill wasn't out of control.

I'm used to hash that is cubed up smaller, this came with taters like you'd but in an au gratin and slices of the meet.  Wasn't bad - needed more onions and peppers in my opinion.

Okay, probably not that, either. But let me make my case.\\n\\nShari's is open 24-hours, and serves an entire international menu, almost all of it deep-fried. Burgers, pot stickers, seafood, spaghetti, pancakes. The waiters are a promising, surprising mix of bizarre and sweet. I have been to almost every Shari's in Oregon: on Murray, we once had a waitress named Tisa who was about to give birth. When we returned two years later, we remembered her and were able to ask about her son. On another occassion, we showed up in a myriad of sparkly spandex underpants, totally smashed, after a superhero party had been broken up.

Yami Yami is #17 -- that's how much fail this restaurant was to me.\\n\\nYami Yami is sushi restaurant located in the Peachtree Center Mall food court.  While walking around the food court, one can't help but notice Yami Yami for its large, appealing, and often busy storefront.  It's the only sushi restaurant in the food court and it's one of the only, perhaps *the* only, self-serve restaurant.  It's unique.\\n\\nIn addition to sushi, the restaurant serves Asian salads such as Thai cucumber salad, soba (Japanese buckwheat noodle) salad, seaweed salad, and Greek salad, and hot foods like chicken teriyaki and Americanized Chinese foods like spring rolls and sesame chicken.  The quality is food court food quality.  In other words, not very good.\\n\\nWe went for dinner where the following prices were in effect:\\n\\nHot food, salad: $7.99/pound\\nHot food, salad, sushi: $10.99/pound\\nSushi only: $1.00-$1.50 each\\n\\nNo matter which option you choose, I think you're screwed.  Since the food is self-serve, it's like a one-visit buffet.  You fill a disposable Styrofoam box with whatever sushi, hot foods, and salads you want.\\n\\nThe quality of the sushi is on par with Ru San's, which is the standard for low quality sushi in the Atlanta area.  It's all about quantity over quality with Ru San's and Yami Yami.  At least with Ru San's, you're paying a cheap price for cheap sushi.  I can live with that.  At Yami Yami, you're paying an expensive price for cheap sushi.\\n\\nI noticed Yami Yami uses sushi plates with the logo for Badayori.  Badayori is the name of the now-defunct sushi buffet in Sandy Springs.  Before it was known as Badayori, it was known as Minado.  Today, it's Nori Nori.  I have no idea if Yami Yami is connected to Nori Nori in any way.  If the two are connected, Yami Yami should hang its head in shame because Nori Nori is actually good.\\n\\nThe sushi selection was poor.  There were only two types of nigiri offered: shrimp and tuna.  There wasn't even salmon or yellowtail, which are some of the cheapest and most basic nigiri every sushi restaurant serves.  The same can be said for the rolls.  I came upon one section of six plates of rolls where five of the six plates were completely empty.  Ridiculous.\\n\\nOf the rolls that were available, they were mostly of the Americanized cooked, fried, and sauce-drenched variety.  The nigiri was hurriedly and sloppily put together with way too much rice and the rolls were lackluster.  Do not come here and expect authentic Japanese sushi.\\n\\nAnother issue was cross contamination.  I'm allergic to shrimp.  I tried the tuna nigiri and several of the rolls.  I'm not sure exactly which pieces were cross-contaminated, but I had an allergic reaction to the non-shrimp sushi and rolls.  Not good, especially for those who are more allergic than others.\\n\\nAt the end of the ordering line, there are self-serve containers of soy sauce and water.\\n\\nEnded up getting a box of 2 tuna nigiri and 10 individual roll pieces, a veggie spring roll, and some broccoli and seaweed salad for nearly $18.  In order to save money, I recommend you do not place soy sauce, ginger, and wasabi into your food box.  Come back and get them after you've paid.

Not a lot of tables so I'm sure it can get pretty busy. The vibe of the place is very comfortable and casual. \\n\\nSERVICE\\nIt was not busy (plenty of empty tables) but it took our waitress 10-15 to finally approach our table. At the end the hostess cleared our dessert plates and our waitress again didn't approach us for about 15-20 minutes. In between the food seemed to come out very slowly with the exception of our entrees. \\n\\nFOOD / BEVERAGE\\nThis was really where the meal fell short for us. For appetizers we tried their tomato bisque and the brie plate. The tomato bisque was OK but not what I would typically expect from a bisque. The brie plate was WAY too sweet. It really needed something salty, savory, or spicy to balance out ALL the sweet things on the plate -- apples, strawberries, marmalade, honey. For the entree we got the sesame orange glazed salmon and the chicken saltimbocca. The salmon on its own was good, as was the broccolini that came with it, but the sauce was WAY too salty and the rice was under-seasoned. The chicken had a weird quality that made it look reheated which was not appealing. It lacked flavor and the sauce was not particularly great. The au gratin potatoes were a crowd favorite. For dessert we both got the apple crisp and it was truly the highlight of the meal. Absolutely perfect. \\n\\nRESTROOMS\\nCute single stall restroom.

I've been here for lunch twice and the experience was no good.  The first time we came was just a few weeks after it opened and it was just awful.  I had the worst salad of my life.  My friend had bland watery soup and I avoided the place forever.  Then a few years ago I was hosting an event in the ballroom upstairs, so we went down here for lunch and had very lackluster cheeseburgers.  \\nHowever, my husband had never been here and wanted to try it.  I had yesterday off from work so we decided to check out breakfast and it was a delight!  So 1 star for lunch and 5 stars for breakfast equals 3 stars.  That's the math I am going with for now.  \\nWe made reservations for 9:15 breakfast.  A reservation here is generally not too difficult to get, but it was pretty crowded yesterday morning since it was a holiday weekend and thus I would still recommend making reservations if possible.  Also, if you don't have reservations they may very well stop you at the guard gate and not let you park at the resort.  The Contemporary regularly struggles with people trying to park there and walk to the Magic Kingdom.  \\nI find the lounge waiting area a little too blue for my taste.  Maybe it works at dinner, but at breakfast there is no one at the bar and the lounge has these weird blue lights that feel very nightclub like.  The dining room is lovely though with these really neat copper waves on the ceiling.  The room is not as bright as I would like, but there are no windows in the restaurant so that is why.  \\nFor breakfast you can order off the menu or help yourself to the all you care to enjoy buffet.  My husband chose the buffet and I chose to order the chicken and waffles off of the menu.  \\nThe buffet is priced at $23 which is very reasonable for a Disney breakfast buffet.  There were all the regular items you would expect, biscuits, gravy, bacon, scrambled eggs, sausage links and Mickey waffles.  However, they also had some slightly different items too like sweet potato pancakes, cheddar grits, eggs Benedict with a key lime hollandaise, smoked salmon, and yogurt parfaits like banana, caramel and granola.  The yogurt with banana and caramel was like a dessert.  The cheddar grits were shockingly good and had an amazing texture and consistency.  My husband was absolutely in love with the Eggs Benedict and key lime hollandaise.  You may not get characters and let's face it, they are a huge draw, but my husband liked the food on this buffet far more than he did on the Chef Mickey buffet upstairs last month and Chef Mickey is double the price.  \\nI ordered the chicken and waffles off of the menu and at $16 this was reasonable enough for Disney.  The waffle was a large Mickey waffle with cinnamon butter.  It was awesome.  They had to bring me more cinnamon butter.  The chicken was crunchy and flavorful.  It was super juicy and added just a dash of hot sauce to give it that extra kick.  It was a boneless chicken breast too which was nice too.  I would totally order it again.  \\nSo we LOVED breakfast here and will probably return for breakfast.  Our service was not so impressive.  It took forever for anyone to greet us.  Our drinks took forever and my refill never came.  I had eaten 1/2 my plate before our server came to ask how everything was and I basically had to hunt him down to get my extra cinnamon butter and hot sauce.  I think he knew he was giving us the attention we deserved though because he offered us a discount, gave me my refill to go, and I heard the table next to us tell him about their myriad of allergies, which I know slowed him down. It was also a holiday so it was quite crowded.  I appreciate him trying to make up for it with the drink to go and offer of discount.  \\nOverall, I highly recommend this place for breakfast, but definitely not for lunch."},{"name":"Joe's On Juniper","address":"1049 Juniper St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I only really come here to see my friend Brad, but it's a nice enough place to hang out and relax.

Receiving a $50 credit mailing from them, got our attention.  Also appreciated the expiration reminder via email.  Flemings did a good job us using technolgy to create a positive and useful customer contact experience.\\n\\nOnline reservations via the Flemings website was easy.  We dined early (6:15) becuase the prime times were already booked.  When we arrived at the Valet on Friday night, the earliest dine time available was 9:30pm!  Glad we had a reservation.\\n\\nOur experience was very good.  The reality is that we are not in the habit of eating lots of read meat, but could not imagine ordering seafood or chicken at a place known for steak.  I had the Porcini rubbed filet mignon. It arrived sizzling hot and perfectly cooked to the requested medium rare.  The gorgonzola sauce was rich and creamy.  The steak did not need the sauce, but I ate ever drop.  My husband enjoyed the Ribeye as well as the 3 sauces.\\n\\nThe side dishes and drinks really shined.  Next visit we may feast on side dishes and drinks.  We split a Flemings salad, which included candied walnuts and was light and perfect.  Recommend splitting as the salad is quite large for one.  We enjoyed the Smokey Cheddar Mac and Cheese.  it was perfect and the next day left overs were even better.\\n\\nThe drinks!  The wine list is extensive.  I discovered \\"The Prisoner\\".  Awesome, and now I am imprisoned by wanting more of a wine that is a bit above my standard price point.\\n\\nThe drinks!  Lots of fancy cocktails on a menu.  My husband started with a Margatini and then another, and then was very happy.  He was very clear this was the best margarita he had ever had and did not care to understand that this was a martinini that he was enjoying.  If you like margaritas, give this martini a try.\\n\\nThe service here was amazing.  From the valet, to the hostess, to the waitstaff, to our waitress - all were personable and service oriented.  \\n\\nThe ambiance was updated from the traditional steak house and I appreciated that, as I am not fond of the dark red decor of the past.

First off, if you are not a dog person, this is not the place for you.  Almost everyone dining here at their canine companions with them but not all dogs are created equal.  Some very high strung and the wrong look from a neighbor canine diner can start a lot of barking, yelping and possible dog fights.  So, if you don't like dogs, are allergic and afraid, don't dine here.  Secondly, this place is a tin shed - there are no walls made of concrete so it's kind of cold inside, especially this time of year.  I think this place is probably great from say mid June to mid October but otherwise make sure you are dressed in layers.  Now that being said, the food is wonderful, the menu has something for everyone and the service is not only friendly, a tad funky but great.  They actually check on you once the food is served to see if everything is to your liking.  I had the special eggs Benedict on fresh crab cakes with a side of potato mini cakes.  So good, fresh, hot and just the right amount of food.  The plate was so beautifully and the color of the hollandase just stands out not to mention you may want to bath yourself in it.  My dining companions had a burrito, the Spike, that looked like it was cooked to perfection and a good portion, and the Good Dog with avocado.  Also, we all had Bloody Mary's, their traditional type and perfection!!! So good and not too much ice and so tasty.  I would say this was such a great meal and fun dining experience because we do like dogs, although startled a few times but some barking, and we were dressed for the cold weather."},{"name":"Boteco Restaurant","address":"5135 International Dr, Ste 12","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"First time at a Brazilian restaurant.

Just enough richness and mushroom flavor. We also got the Whiskey Glaze Confit Natural Bacon which was good. The almond butter blintz that came with it was an odd pairing. I would definitely recommend the soup over this for an app. \\n\\nThe BF got the Salmon as an entr√©e, and said it was good. But it didn't seem to blow him away as he mentioned the price tag for that plate didn't match the quality of the dish. I got the Seared Diver Scallops and they were cooked to perfection.

Poppin Pita is a small restaurant located off of 14th Street, in between a halal supermarket and the Touch Indian restaurant.  It's on the left side when you drive past State Street towards Northside.  There's a handful of tables both inside and outside the restaurant.  Unlike other Mediterranean restaurants in the area, all of the food isn't on display at the counter.  Parking is very limited in front of the restaurant.  I placed an order for dine-in when the restaurant was empty and it took about 10 minutes to receive my order.\\n\\nOn the Menu: Menu categories include appetizers, salads, sandwiches, half platters, and full platters.  The difference between a half platter and a full platter is that full platters come with both salad and hummus, while you only get a choice of one with the half platter.  Proteins come in the form of shawarma or kabobs.  Types of meat include beef, chicken, and lamb.  Falafels and veggie kabobs are available for vegetarians.\\n\\nWhat I Tried:\\nChicken Shawarma Full Platter ($10.99) - This platter includes thinly sliced, small seasoned chicken pieces on a bed of rice with a side salad, hummus, and a medium sized piece of pita bread.  The chicken had good flavor - the seasoning is sumac heavy.   Served on the side is a sour cream that goes well with both the meat and the rice.  The salad is your average salad with lettuce, tomato, and feta cheese.  There's a lot of dressing and the vegetables aren't super crisp.  My favorite part of the platter was the hummus.  It was warm and smooth - excellent for dipping with the pita bread.\\n\\nVerdict: If you order a half platter, I'd pick the hummus over the salad.  Also, I think it would be better to call in advance for takeout.  But the chicken shawarma here tastes good and the full platters are reasonably filling."},{"name":"Jac's Cafe","address":"29 Crest Ave","city":"Winthrop","stars":"4.5","text":"I LOVE Jac's Cafe.

As a foodie I really appreciate the fact that this place makes fresh, homemade, hand rolled dumplings to order.  \\n\\nThe food: I split the vegan dumplings, dumpling room dumplings, mini bao dumplings, and nutella banana dumplings with co workers.  All were fantastic!  I loved the presentation - they were all different shapes, colors and garnished in different ways.  In response to previous viewers - yes they were doughy, but that is how dumplings should be!  I found that they all had ample filling, in fact the dumpling room dumplings had whole shrimp in it and the vegan dumplings had multiple edamame in each one (in addition to other vegetables).\\n\\nAlso, in addition to the dumplings on the menu it appeared per a chalk board in the restaurant they feature dumpling specials.  \\n\\nIn addition to the fantastic dumplings here are a few more reasons I love this place:\\n\\nThe cost: If you check on YELP for the first time - you get 15% off your first order.  We were a party of 7 and ordered a TON of food and the bill was under $60 (with the YELP discount)\\n\\nThe Service: They ran out of the chicken dumplings and therefore our order was significantly delayed.  The chef came out of the kitchen to apologize, gave us a voucher for 2 free orders of chicken dumplings the next time we came in PLUS a free order of pork dumplings AND the chicken dumplings we originally ordered (just late).  He was extremely friendly, polite and apologetic.  Now that is service!\\n\\nAlso as for other logistics - this place is located in Central Square so parking might be a challenge.  There is plenty of metered street parking in the area but it gets filled up during prime times.  The atmosphere was simple, modern, understated yet eclectic.  \\n\\nOverall I would definitely recommend this place in a heartbeat to anyone who loves dumplings.  This place was like a foodie dream!   I will also definitely be back!\\n\\nOh and also, per the name of this place, it is a dumpling room - therefore they only make and serve dumplings.

Now don't get me wrong - I don't dislike Bob or his thai food per say. The half a dozen times my laziness has won out, I was left pretty satisfied. The food is tasty - not, write home about it tasty, but i'm content to wolf it down in my pjs over an episode of Misfits. But compared to some of the other thai joints in town, it's missing the mark a bit.\\n\\nWhen they failed to ask how spicy i'd like my curry it should have been the first clue to what would follow. If you're like me, and like your food melt your face off (pleasantly) spicy, then most definitely pipe up when ordering. The last few times, I failed to follow my own advice and wound up with MORE then mild curry. I felt like I had accidentally ordered off the child's menu mild.\\n\\nRoasted duck red curry is always my go to. I'm a sucker for duck so it's pretty dang hard to disappoint me. The red curry was indeed tasty - mild as all heck - but tasty with the odd exception of both over cooked and under cooked tomatoes. I'm still trying to figure out how they pulled that one off. But after religiously scarfing down Sawasdee's red curry for the last year, this rendition lacks anything interesting. The ratio of meat is quite small and in a to-go container, you're looking at a bowl of mostly curry sauce with very little substance.\\n\\nBetter off to try your hand at their chicken green curry. Again - mild mild mild - but the ingredient ratio seems to be a lot more balanced. The curry is a bit sweeter then i'm used to but hey, i'm no expert, and it didn't stop me from taking down the entire meal in one foul swoop. And the eggplant was well cooked - tender but not mushy. Yum.\\n\\nThe servings are a good size for the price but double up your rice as they tend to be quite skimpy. \\n\\nAll in all, i'm sure Bob and I will have another go and see each other over the bright lights of my Netflix again in the future but when my spice meter trumps my laziness, i'll walk the five extra blocks for something with a little more oomph."},{"name":"50 Plates","address":"333 NW 13th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"They pack you in like sardines!

I also curse myself that I didn't come here more when I lived in Portland.\\nIt's true, the best meal here is breakfast--though the wait can be fairly horrendous on a weekend day, so I prefer to come during the week. My most favorite breakfast of all time is the veggie pesto scrambled eggs, which is filled with roasted sweet potato, onion, and whole garlic clove goodness, and is topped with really tasty pesto and a dollop of cream cheese for good measure. I always get mine with the potato pancakes served with sour cream and green onions, yum, as well as a biscuit that I slather with the very fresh-tasting raspberry jam on the table. \\nIt's fun to come for dinner as well--the patio area is equipped with overhead heaters and a few times they've given us blankets to spread over our laps when it's cold outside, which is totally cute. I love the laid-back feel and the cocktails made with fresh juice--I could hang out here on a nice fall night for hours. Some tasty choices for dinner food are the cobb salad (I think the bacon is caramelized--my god! and the blue cheese dressing has wasabi in it), as well as the burgers (especially the one with black bean mango salsa). \\nA quintessential Portland spot--I miss you, Tin Shed!"},{"name":"Ranch 616","address":"616 Nueces St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Ranch 616 is a neighborhood hang-out that's just a few blocks away from most downtown hotels.

To start the portions are noticeably small for the price. Obviously their rent is very high given their location and they are selling tacos, but I do believe they would sell more if they beefed up their tacos a bit, with say cheese or flavors other than just hot sauce. The tacos are basically just meat, cilantro, and spice, on a single corn tortilla. Very underwhelming. Also, nearly everything on the menu is spicy. I specifically asked the waitstaff what tacos I could order that wouldn't be spicy (because I'm a wimp) and they told me to order off the kids menu. Not to mention the only reason I knew a lot of their tacos had spicy things incorporated was because I had looked that the menu online earlier in the day. The menu they give you at the restaurant does not list what comes on the taco besides what meat it is. I don't love that. Perhaps the worst thing though was the \\"salsas\\" they give you for your food. They have three: a red, green, and yellow/orange. By the end of the meal my mouth was so on fire that I figured I would try the red and the green, presumably the least spicy of the three. The green was one of the worst versions of salsa I had ever tried, while not overly hot it was so vinegary and citrus filled that it was all you could taste. Really disappointing. While there was much dissatisfaction from my initial visit to BarTaco, I must comment on how excellent the service was. Very attentive and friendly waitstaff, which I certainly noticed and appreciated. Overall, I can't say I would go back by my own desire, but could end up here again through friends.

I'm not a huge fan of torchy tacos and this is what this place seemed like another torchys. Since we needed to kill time we walked from the Apple store to velvet taco. I ordered the picnic taco and the Cuban pig. The price always scares me because tacos should not cost that much. It was worth it thought. The picnic taco was delicious. The crema was very tasty and the chicken was just as good, little bit of lime and I was craving another. The Cuban pig was a kick to the taste buds. I didn't need to add anything to it. The combination of pulled pork, ham, cheese and mustard grain was perfect. I have to say whenever I'm in the domain i am definitely eating here. For dessert we had the red velvet cake which was very delicious. The staff was friendly and even picked up or trash for us.

But the food takes second stage to the chefs, and it is a shame, as the ingredients and concept were solid at Mikado.  I was very impressed with the quality of steak, shrimp, and scallops, which were huge.  But when soy sauce is the only seasoning used when cooking, the flavor is very one dimensional.  And when you mix soy sauce with rice and an egg, charge $5 and call it fried rice, it is a rip off.  The accompanying sauce could have been more flavorful, but they were both bland.  Prices are fairly high, starting around $30, but it includes a soup (miso or a very flavorless miso), salad, and shrimp appetizer.

We ordered the following off the Chinese/English menu that's on white paper near the register.  It looks like they also have a to-go American/English menu that's printed on glossy color brochures.\\n\\n-Steamed fish & tofu - a winner with everyone, but be careful to avoid the red chilies at the center if you can't take too much spice (that's me).  This is a steamed dish with toasted sesame oil & soy sauce poured on top.  Great with rice.\\n-Pork belly (On the menu, the dish starts with \\"Mao's...\\") - Great flavor, medium-light spicy, but the pork could have been a little more tender.\\n-Green beans - yummy and not overcooked as it can be at so many other places.  I love Chinese salted green beans -- so crispy and flavorful.  It looks like it's cooked with shallots, etc.\\n\\nKid tip: Most everything on the menu we tried was mildly spicy.  Even dishes that were \\"Oh, it's not spicy, kids eat that dish\\" (I'm looking at you, steamed fish) were too spicy for our young kids.  We ordered a chicken chow mein from the American menu for the kids and it was not spicy at all, so that menu is probably the best route to go for tender-tongued babes.\\n\\nReservations: I called the day before to ask about the need to make a reservation, but the person on the phone assured me that was not necessary for the time-frame and date.  We showed up and got the very last table for our group, but then the place was only a third full later.  I think since it's a small-ish place that seats ~35, how busy it is will probably fluctuate.\\n\\nLocation: Right between a pet store and Reach church.  I could really use a tea or ice cream shop next door for post-dinner dessert!  Too bad the yummy Crown donuts 2 doors down is not open during dinner hours.\\n\\nService: With just one person at the cashier and another one pitching in to help deliver food and clear tables, we had to wave down someone to take our order and bring us bowls.  It doesn't bother me -- the place is small enough that it's not hard to get someone's attention and the food is worth it.\\n\\nAlso, I have no idea how this restaurant is getting labeled as a $$$ place.  Each dish is about $10.

'He's too busy.'  I insist on speaking to the manager 'I'll have him call you back'.  9:30pm still no food and no call from the manager.  Call again and manager is still too busy.  about 9:45pm a delivery person for another restaurant appears at the door with my now very COLD food.  He said that the original delivery person's car had broken down.  (Why the restaurant never bothered to tell me that when I called I have no idea...)   He tried to call the restaurant, but the manager wouldn't talk to HIM EITHER!  He said he had to give me the food and have the slip signed so he could get back to his own restaurant..

When you walk in here, it's as if you have been thrown into a time warp back to the 70's and you can picture a booth filled with Mob Figures enjoying their Italian Dishes. The dining room hasn't changed since the opening and the wood paneling on the walls is cool. The bar is small and the bartender serves up beer and mixed beverages. Be warned, this place does get packed and you will wait to be seated. What sometimes might suffer is service on a real busy night. But you will like the character and atmosphere of this place.\\n\\nUpon sitting at a table you are greeted by a food server who could be old enough to be your uncle. They 1st bring you out some pretty tasty garlic bread dunked in some butter and some pickled veggies. I could probably do witout those as it wasn't too inspiring. I guess people must like it as they have been doing this for years. \\n\\nI usually get the Breast of Chicken Francese. The chicken is dipped in egg batter, sauteed in butter, lemon, and white wine sauce. It 's a delectable dish and one of my favorites. Also try the Scampi Alfredos, it is a delectable dish. Also try the Alfredo Scampi. It is jumbo shrimp baked in garlic butter and herbs, served over angel hair pasta.

We don't have time for that, make them split the bill themselves\\". \\n\\nwtf? First of all, she was the one serving us, you go mind your own damn business. Second, we only have cards so we can't exactly split the bill. When I confronted him about his attitude, he made up an excuse they don't have time to punch in the calculator our price and divide by three. Well, Instead of intruding, and being so rude, you should have nicely asked us to do so instead of shoving the bill right back to us. I highly doubt our time arguing decreased that simple task the beautiful waitress was about to do.\\n\\nOh, and if you are reading this, you should stop drinking while on the job.

What I am disappointed about is the response from management concerning a complaint I had reported. As I was laying out by the 4th level pool, hotel maintenance used this poolside deck as the pathway to go from inside the hotel, moving or relocating what appeared to be white fencing and post. When it first started, my thought was it would just be a few passings... but after about 10 passes back and forth within 3 feet of my lounge chair, I decided I have had enough. So, I cut my pool time short and headed in. I decided to report this to the front desk and to say that surely there is a different route they could have taken verses by the pool area where several of us were laying out. The first person was very apologetic. Then, she brings out a member of management... her name is Jade. I repeat what happened and she did halfway apologize but what has lingered is her respond. She actually recommended me go to the other pool on the lower level. So, now this response has been dangling in my head all night. So, instead of actually taking my complaint seriously, she suggest me move or change from the spa like pool that is more secluded and relaxing to the very crowed and loud pool on the lower level so to accommodate the relocation of fencing.... which, I'm sure there had to be a different route they could have taken or if not... at least, this process done early in the morning or late afternoon, when no one was out there.

For some reason, they have two registers funneling the line of customers in two different ways, and it's never clear what side of the island your sandwich or drink is going to appear on.

We went on a sunny Saturday morning, waited briefly with our cups of coffee, and were soon led through the pleasant patio area into the indoor seating area. I'm not sure if it was the hot weather or the open feel of the cafe, something about it made me feel like I was in Hawaii, which put me in a pleasant frame of mind. \\n\\nThe menu offered a range of breakfast possibilities, with some unusual offerings like curries, yam french toast, tofu dishes as well as the more traditional bacon, eggs, grits, etc. So I was excited to try something new, choosing a tofu curry that sounded unusual and fantastic. Our server was super polite, but the food took forever to come out. When it did come, my dish looked like everything the menu had promised, but when I took a bite of tofu, it tasted like nothing so much as lighter-fluid, same with the vegetables. I've had this experience before at restaurants that serve grilled vegetables, I don't know how it happens, whether they douse a fire in fluid while the food is on or what. I couldn't even put away half my curry, and I'm usually a plate-cleaner. I really should have sent the dish back, but I get embarrassed about doing things like that. \\n\\nSo, despite my high hopes the food experience was bad enough that I probably wouldn't go back. I was tempted to give two stars; the third is for what seems like a lot of potential.

After that I decided this place wasn't an establishment I wanted to support.\\n\\nHowever, this morning I found myself at the post office and thought maybe it was a fluke, maybe it wasn't so bad, maybe it was worth another shot.  Man, was I wrong.  I ordered a vanilla latte and a bagel with cream cheese.  They were pretty quick on the order today, maybe a five minute wait.  However, my vanilla latte was a scalding hot cup of coffee with a shot of vanilla.  That's it.  No latte.  I got my order to go and since the coffee was incredibly scalding hot, I didn't drink it until I got home.  I know it wasn't a communication mix-up because the guy that took my order made my drink and I paid for a latte.  Just lazy, that's all.\\n\\nTwo visits, two really bad outcomes.

My friend ordered some apple bitters martini. I asked for a Cosmo, and was told it could be made with citrus vodka. The apple bitters martini was more suited for fall, but very good. My Cosmo was ok. \\n\\nFor an appetizer, we went with the pork taquitos. They were spicier than I was expecting, which was nice; but the portion was somewhat small. I think we had four bite-sized pieces on the plate. \\n\\nFor dinner, we got burgers served with tater tots. The burger was juicy, if not a little too juicy. The bottom bun slowly dissolved in my hands as I was eating it. The tater tots were very hot, plentiful and somewhat oily.

I hopped on Yelp and to my surprise reviews were great, which made me look forward to the Yelp infamous fried chicken.\\n\\nThe place has a great vibe, lots of energy but not raucous. The have a long wide bar which I will be visiting again, great for having a chat and some imbibing. Though note, their forte seems to be for beer and some basic cocktails (margarita, caesar and 2 I do not remember). I had a margarita to start and it was decent (if you follow me you know I am a margarita snobette). Think pub drinks. Decent wine list, nothing to complain about.\\n\\nI thought service was great, my partner not so much. We were a table of 10 and my side of the table which consisted of 4 women got fabulous service, the other half of 4 men and 2 women, not so much :) Our waiter was young, prompt but very by the book, any changes I asked for were not met with not much room. Asked for salt on the rim of my margarita- \\"they don't do that\\", HUH? What? How hard is that? Asked if I could just get dark meat for my chicken, same thing, can't do that.. HUH?\\n\\nSo now you know, I had the chicken and it was yummy, melt in your mouth, luscious and moist. Me not one to like breast meat much because places tend to over cook them, devoured my breast. I am sure the chicken was brined in a sugar and water solution as it does impart a sweetness. The coating is crisp but also leaning towards the sweet side. The gravy too has a sweetish taste that bleeds into the mashed potatoes. I am a fan of the light sweetness and so was the rest of the group less my partner, was not his style, not savoury enough. For all its accolades, it is not a dish I could have over and over, it's like turkey dinner, you love it, you're stuffed, but its too much to have weekly, let alone monthly. Awesome bird but still not up to my Flying Pig roast chicken I could eat every week (see review).\\n\\nOther dishes had on the table were a seafood bake, the owner of that dish loved it others not so much, comes down to personal preference. Comes in a large bowl with a dollop of rice. Appetizers! The Creole shrimp must have been laced with pot because the more I ate the hungrier for it I got, delicious sauce. The calamari, grilled fresh with a ancho dip met with approval. I had 4 kushi oysters which came in a darling bucket with all the condiments and they were fresh and light. Could have had 10 more. Mussels, we had the tomato-sausage base which I kind of thought would be meh. Normally I prefer the standard French treatment or Asian bent, but the mussels were plump and bursting which negated any thoughts on the broth but their sausage should be a meal on its own as an appetizer, if I didnt have to share I would have had them all!\\n\\nThere was no room to squeeze dessert and it was a paltry selection (this is where I deduct a star). Also star deductions came from my lack of salt rim, lack of cocktail selection and the crappy glasses they use to serve wine. For pete's sake if I am going to spend $86 on a bottle of wine, actually 3 bottles, I expect a wine glass not a $0.10 cheapie 6oz scratched up glass to degrade my wine to about a $20 bottle in taste.\\n\\nHowever, fix those few minute things and Chewie's you would be bordering on a 4 to 4.5.\\n\\nSee you soon."},{"name":"The Matador","address":"1438 NW 23rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"One of only 3 times I have walked out of a restaurant.

This is part of the reason that the crowd at the front is such a pain; all the people by the big bar in the front have nowhere to hang out except right where you need to walk to get to the back.  Other things... by about 11:00 the men's bathroom was absolutely foul.  It smelled pretty rank, and the floor with soaking wet.  The bathroom itself is remarkably tiny - gas station tiny - and seems really out of place next to the stylish decor of the main room.
