We were able to purchase salt water heaven straight out of the ocean. Translation, I'm pretty particular when it comes to fish and seafood. As an aside, I'm sensitive to gluten and dairy so when I cheat a handful of times out of the year, it has to be worthy...Garbo's is officially \\"cheat worthy\\". \\n\\nFirst things first...they painted their truck like something you'd see up north. It was white with a red lobster on it. Simple, effective and brought back childhood memories near the beach. The folks running the place are from Maine and Connecticut so we had plenty to talk about amongst the crowd. They're nice, sociable folks with excellent customer service. On to the critique...I opted for the lunch meal special. $17 got me a lobster roll, chips, watermelon and ginger brew. When they delivered it to me they did so with a healthy sample of their New England style clam chowda...nice touch! \\n\\nThe rolls were as they should be...stuffed to the gills! I ordered the Maine style roll which is the classic. Their mayo is hand made and is used sparingly. These guys let the lobster speak for itself and that it does! Briney yet sweet, tender and rich. Huge chunks of tail, claws cooked to absolute perfection. I was heaven! The bun itself was definitely tasty. They get them from Sweetish Hill Bakery. Again, they were tasty but different from the style you'd find up North. Trust me, it's irrelevant. No doubt SH was chosen because it was probably their best option. Overall experience...mega cheat worthy!!\\n\\nI'm still smiling from the experience as it really did bring back memories of younger times.

Not particularly busy so that should have been a clue, I guess. \\n\\nThe first thing we noticed was a decided lack of attention to detail by the staff. We were seated by the greeter who took the two extra plates and two utensil sets, leaving the two of us with one set of silverware as there had only been three on the table(four plates though). The tables have these tiny water glasses on them and both of the ones left by our greeter were dirty with stuff crusted on them presumably from the dishwasher. The server introduced herself to us and was very pleasant. We asked for clean water glasses and gave drink orders and asked for another set of utensils. She said she'd bring them.\\n\\nWater and new glass arrived but no utensils. Drinks arrived but no utensils. We didn't have food yet so no real issue. We placed our order and the server said she'd be right back with chips and salsa. A big plus for me because being from California were you are almost NEVER charged to chips and salsa and coming to Atlanta where you almost always are, this was a nice throwback and we LOVE chips and salsa. We waited. And waited. Our server walked over to the waterfall wall and stood vaguely watching as another table was seated. I flagged her down and she approached, smiling brightly.\\n\\n\\"You mentioned something about chips and salsa?\\" I said. \\"Oh yes\\", she responded and she walked over to the waiter's station about 20ft from our table collected some chips and dropped them off with salsa to be forthcoming. She returned momentarily with the salsa and...well, if you like Pace Picante Sauce, you will love this salsa because that is EXACTLY what it tasted like. If you like authentic salsa, you will be massively disappointed. I can forgive a lot of things if the salsa is good, and Pace Picante isn't good.\\n\\nThe food arrived and we once again had to ask for the silverware which was quickly retrieved this time. The food was decent but I feel overpriced considering it was \\"decent\\". I ordered the Tablon(Braised beef short rib) which had a decent flavor but was incredibly greasy and my lovely better half ordered the Quesadilla de Tinga de Res which she actually quite liked. My better half, who is a Margarita expert, ordered one and felt it was mixy and questioned to herself whether it actually had Patron in it as described but we didn't say anything to the waitress. With the mix overtones, there could have been, she supposed.\\n\\nSo as I said; mixed bag. Some of the food was good. The salsa tasted store bought. The glasses were dirty. The waitress, though very pleasant, couldn't keep her head in the game.

They sigh, they roll their eyes, they take forever, they don't know anything about the breads, they don't answer questions. And, here's the coup de grace: they then have the audacity to give you a weird, mad look when you put a zero with a slash through it on the tip line on the credit-card receipt. On more than one occasion, I've looked around for the hidden camera to see if this is some sort of clever TV show.\\n\\nI know some people rave about the food here, but as someone who's eaten good sandwiches all over this country, I find these pretty unimpressive and grossly overpriced. I've tried many of their offerings.

I asked if they would do anything for the inconvenience... she said maybe a discount? At this point she should have gotten a manager.

It's a hindrance because the potential to be obsessive about it is huge.  You could be dominated by checking every single newsfeed that Facebook and Instagram have to offer.\\nIt's an asset because your newsfeed could contain gems of places that people you follow have experienced.  PONKO Chicken is the place in which I've had that happen.\\n\\nThe people I follow on Instagram are always posting about their life.  It's raw, real, and honest.  There is no photoshopped quality behind it.  I've come to discover this place through the perusing of my Instagram feed when I saw this place open up.  A local musician posted a pic of this restaurant stating that friends of his opened this place up and wished them the best and future success of this place.  So naturally, I had to check it out the first chance I got.\\n\\nThe fact that it's so new that they haven't even finished their dining room but that the outdoor seating was so limited on a Sunday afternoon shows how popular this place has become in such a short time.  And if locals know their place, you need to ensure you make the visit so I followed suit and ate here.\\n\\nIt's a simple concept.  Chicken.  Chicken tenders in fact.  But there's something different than the chicken tender's you're thinking of.  Normally, tenders are heavy on the breading and light on the meat, HERE it's different.  The breading is light, almost a panko (play on words with the namesake for the restaurant?  Perhaps!) but what's genius is that it doesn't seem to affect the crunchiness of the tenders.  And when you order spicy, it's not at all what you'd expect.  I ordered the spicy and what I got looked like it was dowsed in Frank's Red Hot sauce.  But wasn't.  There wasn't that vinegary bite behind it.  It did have that Frank's kick but the backend had this sweetness to it.  Very flavorful!\\n\\nI opted for the fries and coleslaw.  The fries were definitely light and had flavorful and the coleslaw was creamy but still light.  The food here is light and is not so oily compared to some places that fry their foods.\\n\\nThe only complaint is the $10 for 4 strips and 2 sides.  Would love to see a little bit more in terms of quantity but for what it's worth, definitely worth going to!!!\\n\\nHighly recommend!"},{"name":"Jam On Hawthorne","address":"2239 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"My new favorite spot!

Everyone's resting on their past success, the stench of apathy lingers, and the restaurant experience is going downhill fast. \\n\\nThe music is terrible, and it's a sign of the need for change. \\n\\nEvery time we've gone in the past few months, they've been playing an awful horrible collection of 90s music pulled from the Dawson's Creek soundtrack. It feels like someone in their mid 30s had a really bad breakup back in high school and can't get over it. They're making everyone else suffer thru it. \\n\\nPlus the kitchen staff plays their music at top volume to compete with the bad music played by the depressed front of house staff - so when combined with the noises of a crowded restaurant with lots of kids, it's just a cacophony of awfulness. \\n\\nAnd dear lord, please let whomever was responsible for the insane amount of salt in our food not die of a heart attack. I feel like a mummy stuck in the Dead Sea after breakfast today. If they salted their own food like that on a regular basis they'd be as puckered as a pickle. Yikes. \\n\\nFinal memo to Jam's management: it's time to care. There are reasons why people invest in service training and pay attention to music. Your staff is taking your restaurant downhill.

While my wife's Shepherds Pie was good she said it wasn't great and seemed to be heavy on the potato side (and my wife likes potatoes).  I was very disappointed in my Fish & Chips.

Their toppings and seasonings are minimal and flavorful, but they definitely do not serve plain raw fish either. Think O Ya without the expensive price tag. The BLUEFIN TORO was our favorite, which came in four pieces and was accompanied with just the right amount of seasoning. We also had the YELLOWTAIL (paired with grapefruit oil & chili) and SALMON (with a salsa verde), which were also great options. \\n\\nCROSTINI: Their crostini comes on a large slice of toasted baguette, sliced into four pieces. We tried the CHICKEN LIVER, FIG & SALAMI, and BONE MARROW crostini to share, which would normally be a good appetizer for a smaller group. Because they provide plenty of bread for the table with the crudo, we didn't think the crostini was necessary as part of our meal.\\n\\nPASTA: Now for the main meal, we were shocked that after ordering three pasta dishes, we were brought out additional dishes that were the chef's special! We placed an order for the SPAGHETTI, ORECCHIETTE, and PACCHERI dishes. Of the three, my favorite was the PACCHERI, which came with lobster, green onion and tomato. The sauce was creamy, but not heavy, and paired very well with the lobster. However, I do wish there was more lobster in this dish! The spaghetti is a classic dish flavored only by salt & pepper, which some of my friends loved. The orecchiette was extremely flavorful with the sausage. The chef's specials included one pasta dish topped with plenty of black truffle, and a clam pasta dish. \\n\\nDESSERT: My absolute favorite part of the meal was dessert! I can't choose a favorite because I loved all three options we ordered: BLUEBERRY CROSTATA, APPLE BOMBOLINO, GIANDUJA TART. They were all perfectly buttery, savory, and sweet. These were perfect to share within our group, and we licked our plates clean!\\n\\nWe were extremely stuffed from this meal!

With that picture painted in your mind, you gotta ask yourself how badly you want the lobster roll.\\n\\nThey have an awesome oyster selection that you can order by the piece,  you get a sheet of paper you tick off like at a sushi bar.   The clam chowder was \\"meh\\" for me.  It has a good flavor to it but was too watery for my tastes.\\n\\nThey have a really awesome beer selection and food menu, i can see someone coming here every week... or maybe even a couple of times a week!   The prices are not cheap though.  30 bucks for the lobster roll and 12 bucks for the chowder.  Oysters were ~2.50ea.\\n\\nI would actually suggest splitting the lobster roll.

I ordered a half slab of the St Louis ribs. They were terrible. The majority of the ribs were extremely dry and hard. I should have sent them back. They were the worst ribs ive ever had. the fact that they would even serve ribs that were so bad is even more disappointing. Clearly these ribs were overcooked.

I had a psychological reservation to eating this high of fat and cholesterol as the first meal of the day, much like my intial reservation to eat chicken feet in a dim sum restaurant, but that's totally different baggage than Pine State's food quality and taste. These guys do everything right, you can tell it's from scratch and it's really good.

My friends and I had a drink at the bar while waiting to be seated.  There were four people behind the bar frantically trying to keep up with the orders.  I was finally able to order a glass of French white wine after waiting about 8 minutes.  They have a limited, but varied wine list.  The bartender was not able to find a wine glass, so he used a champagne flute instead, and didn't charge me for the drink.  Nice.  The interior decor is nice, with beautiful light fixtures over head, but I would imagine the main draw is the balcony, which overlooks the creek and has more of a tropical setting.  We didn't wait too long to be seated after that.  Our waitress showed up right away, but proceeded to ask if we wanted to start with appetizers without asking if we wanted water.  She seemed nervous.  As far as Mexican food restaurants go, I haven't seen a menu like this before.  It has an entire section devoted to a la carte tacos, and the prices are very reasonable.  I ordered the Caesar de Arbol salad with tomatoes, plaintains, and avocadoes for $4.75.  As far as dressings go, this Caesar needed much more anchovy and garlic.  It was bland, and I wouldn't order it again.  I also ordered the oyster tacos, which may not sound very appetizing, but are heaven on a plate.  The crispy, fried oysters topped with the tangy, habanero aoili are the same that Garrido made famous at Jeffrey's, except they are wrapped in a perfectly homemade corn tortilla.  I believe it was $3.75.  My dining buddies were equally satisfied with their tacos: shrimp, pork carnitas, and ribeye.  Even though the tacos are small, I'm a big fan of this style of eating; ordering many small items instead of the grande platter.  I will definitely return for the tacos alone.  The service, however, needs much help.  Our waitress forgot to put in my order of oyster tacos, although I did receive them right away (probably someone else's order), she nearly took both of my plates without asking while I was still eating, and she brought our tickets, separated, but forgot an additional drink order.  I think she only had two tables.  She continued to apologize and I felt bad for her as this is obviously her first waitressing job.  Judging from the other comments about the service, it looks like Garrido's needs to seriously focus on the entire dining experience as a whole , train their waitstaff, and possibly rethink their dress code as well.  Service can certainly make or break a dining experience, no matter how good the food is."},{"name":"OAK Long Bar + Kitchen","address":"138 St. James Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Decorated and aimed towards a crowd that wants to see and be seen - the OAK Long Bar generates an atmosphere for people watching in a nouveau-riche setting. When I visited, people were holding a post-Gatsby viewing party (in costume) and fit in so well to the place that it took me most of the evening to realize that these were not members of some highly-insular wealthy circle who had descended to the street level to gawk at the common peasants for the evening. My mixed drink was solid, and served as a double-serving, so while I paid $13 for a Manhattan, I really received two (with appropriate strength I may add). The appetizers were delicious. I recommend the place, but go prepared for a good amount of mutual staring, and the possibility of meeting strangers - I had a lovely time and I do feel that something about this place drags one out of their comfort zone.

The chicken is not dry at all and that scallion oil they put on top is one of the best thing I've ever tasted. It ties the whole meal together.

When they recommended \\"the place that has good chips and salsa,\\" of course my interest piqued.\\n\\nEl Sol de Mexico really isn't much different than a lot of Tex-Mex places; it definitely has the Azteca vibe. And the LOUD vibe. Not so much the music, but the host.\\n\\n\\"HOLA AMIGOS,\\" he practically yelled, scarring my eardrums. \\"HOW MANY TODAY?\\"\\n\\n\\"Cinco,\\" I reply. He continued to mumble something in Spanish. I wasn't really listening. But I did notice that he consistently yelled at the patrons in Spanish. Whether they knew what it meant...well, that's still a mystery.\\n\\nNext!\\n\\nChips and salsa. Like Jen mentioned, nothing super special. I doubt the chips were homemade, but they were hot, and they had what looked like a cornmeal texture to it. The salsa, though? Shiiiiiiiiiiiiittttttttt!!! It was way spicier than I thought it would be. By the time our meals came (lunch specials were $6.50), my mouth was already on fire.\\n\\nThe food was good, although it took a while to eat because everything was SO damn hot. So the combination of the spicy salsa with the SUPER [temperature] hot food literally made me start crying. Not necessarily tears of happiness, either.

Neptune Oyster is one of those great restaurants.\\n\\nThe restaurant is tiny with not much of a waiting area. When my wife and I got there, the place was packed. No room for us inside the door so we stood outside and waited.\\n\\nThe restaurant is longer than it is wide with an L-shaped booth-like bench stretching along the entire left side of the space and half of the back wall. Several tables were jammed together in front of the bench with chairs on the other side. With seating for twenty-six at the tables and another ten at the bar, which ran along the right side of the restaurant, this place might be considered large by some North End standards. The very front of the restaurant, just inside the etched glass window fronting the sidewalk, was the raw bar where J and I watched the show. Rows and rows of shellfish, and a woman shucking oysters like she was pouring water into a glass. Smooth, effortless, perfect.\\n\\nAfter about ten minutes outside and another twenty minutes inside, we sat down at a table. J and I started our night off with two glasses of NV Borgo Magredo Prosecco and a dozen oysters. Four Wellfleet, medium sized, salty, and sweet; four kumomoto, small, sweet, plump, and creamy with hints of cucumber; and four Fanny Bay, medium sized, plump, low salt, sweet, and buttery with a melon finish. Neptune Oyster has a dozen different oysters to choose from as well as little necks, cherry stones, and shrimp cocktail braised in Harpoon beer.\\n\\nMoving on to course two, we shared Neptune's Bottarga Salad. Bottarga is cured fish roe and is delicious. This salad was fantastic with Boston lettuce, red grapes, fennel, caramel onions, white anchovy, grape seed oil and a Parmesan dressing.\\n\\nWith dinner we drank a bottle of Carpe Diem Chardonnay from the Firepeak vineyard in Edna Valley, California. J ordered Neptune's Gloucester Cod Loin served with stewed tri peppers, oregano, mustard, freshly grated horseradish and a grapefruit vinaigrette. The plate was garnished with supremes of grapefruit.\\n\\nI ordered the Fillet of Salmon with a saute of crispy duck, pea tendrils, avocado, ginger and soy. Both of our entrees were truly spectacular, but J's cod loin dish may very well be the best dish of the year. The cod was cooked to perfection and the spicy horseradish was balanced so well by the sweet, tart grapefruit, the mustard and the oregano. The cod dish was definitely the star of the meal.\\n\\nNow for the best part of the evening. We return to the car to find a carefully placed PARKING TICKET on the windshield! Sometime between the last time I was in the North End and last Friday night, Hanover Street converted all the on-street parking to Residents Only after 8pm.\\n\\nOh well.

My friend found the location to the Jenny's and we made our way there. But because of the lack of parking, we decided to admit defeat, until we saw Jake's Ice Cream. And we saw parking!  We said to each other, \\"We need to try new things. Besides, Jenny's is too mainstream.\\"  And it was such a great find. \\n\\nSo, you are first greeted with a very rustic building.  The decor is very cute and does the rustic look very well.  The little picture framed sign for their special July flavor was still up and it was the end of September.  I would have loved to try the special flavor. The line was almost out the door for their ice cream. While we were waiting, we were looking at their various types of baked goods.  I think there are two types of people (three, if you are counting gelatos), people who prefer ice cream and people who prefer sorbet, I'm a sorbet fan. When we got to the sorbet freezer, I was very excited because of the four flavors available, I actually wanted all of them.  The flavors available were: Very Berry Lime, Wild Berry Blast, Mango Mimosa and Blueberry Basil. I've tried all of them except the Mango Mimosa. It was hard for me to decide because I love any type of berry flavors. The Very Berry had the flavor that you would imagine it would taste like, so was the Wild Berry.  The most uniquely flavored was the Blueberry Basil.  It was so weird, but I really digged the basil.  It had the classic blueberry taste, but something earthy with it.  It was so fun. I ended up getting the Very Berry and at this moment, I wish I got the Blueberry Basil. I was worried that I would have gotten tired of the flavor, but my biggest regret was not getting that Basil.\\n\\nMy friend saw the blueberry ice cream and went for it. She said it was very refreshing and that was what she was looking for.  I tried hers, and I agree that it was refreshing. She did mention that there was a different if colors (it was a darker shade of purple).  Come to find out, the darker color had a slight freezer taste to it.   The portion was very nice for a double scoop.  We sat outside to enjoy the weather and look at the wall art. I would totally come back again and happy that we couldn't go to Jenny's."},{"name":"Stretch the Noodle","address":"232 SW Washington St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"You can't beat fresh made  noodles, pulled from the dough right before your eyes!

Flies were everywhere, I thought I was going to throw up, but based on the reviews I HAD to try it.  Why is it so dirty you ask?  Because they basically are situated on a dumpster.  The dumpster is literally nearly connected to the truck, and they don't really close the doors or windows to the truck.

Huge salad bar/cold food buffet and \\"endless\\" roasted/grilled meat on skewers served tableside.  I tried a few of the bar/buffet items that were ok, but it is mostly just filler.  The meat came - there were a lot of options, maybe two of them were fairly good and rest ranged from ok to poor.  One major problem was that some of the meat was not cooked well.  They had these 3 inch cubes of beef and some of these were totally raw on the inside - they were cooked on the outside, but half an inch in they were just completely cold, solid red meat.  It would not even cut with a knife.  I like my steak medium-rare, but this was just completely inedible.  I'm not sure why they can't cook their meat properly - this wasn't even close to being right.  \\n\\nSo I have not been to any other churrascarias so I cannot compare, but I have to believe this has to be near the bottom.

The Kusshi really did taste like cucumber. Very cool.  \\n\\nThe chowder was solid. Watery for those who like the thinner chowder and had about 4 full size clams. It was tasty. \\n\\nThe burger came with these fried oysters that were my second favorite thing in the place. These things were so good they should be the bar and standard of fried oysters. Could I have ordered an entire side of them?  Oh...the burger? It was cooked well, quality beef and next time I will get the sauces on the side. Wayyyyy too much. \\n\\nThe beer menu was also solid. Maine Beer Co. - that's a plus. \\n\\nThis place is small, I had to make sure I was drinking my water and not the guy's next to me. Yes, 2 parties of 3 were seated at the same table and everyone else is sitting that close to each other too, it's the north end, you deal with it.  \\n\\nI wish I could give Neptune Oyster 4.5 stars. This place is sooooo expensive and the 2 hour wait list at 12:00 on a Friday sucks.

And I'm not sure why I keep going back. \\n\\nLet's start with the service.... It's completely awful... Last Sunday I waited 5 minutes before any of the staff spoke to me although they definitely made eye contact with me and a few were just standing around. I get that there were a lot of people but it was seriously uncalled for.. We waited another 10 minutes for a table even though the tables had been ready for a few minutes. We got seated in front of the restaurant where you think we get attention alas we were barely helped and the only thing we got a lot of was a bone chilling breeze  everyone the door opened. We ate a lot but my water spent a great deal of our meal empty.. Time for the check right?? Well I wanted to order some baked goods also but my waitress slyly dropped off the ticket without the receipt holder and I almost didn't see it.. So, I walked up to the bakery counter and waited another 5 minutes for acknowledgement before getting helped... \\nI also tried to place a to-go later in the week... I called about 4 times with no answer. When I arrive to place my order in person there's about 4 employees standing around in a virtually empty restaurant so I can't possible think of a reason they couldn't answer besides having a broken phone which I can't see that being a good thing for a business, maybe instead of standing around they should've been working on getting that fixed...\\n\\nNow for the food... We'll start with my to-go food, I ordered the chicken strips and calamari with a side of fries..\\nChicken strips were good! I think they would've been way better with gravy.. The ranch just didn't really cut it. \\nCalamari were great! \\nThe sweet potato chips or whatever, not so good very greasy and just lacking in my opinion.\\nFries were literally a ball of grease! (Lucky for them I like my fries kinda soggy) but if that's not your thing it's not even a remotely reasonable way to eat them. \\n\\nI've also done brunch a number of times. It's a really great concept and a pretty good price. The presentation is very drab and the food in general doesn't really spark a lot of interest just by looking at it but if you give it a shot it's pretty good! Although there's a distinct lack of labeling so it's pretty much mystery food if it's not obvious. If you have any other dietary restrictions you'd be playing roulette. \\nThe macaroni was bland.\\nAnd the French toast could be a bit sweeter but overall yummy! (With syrup)\\nHad some great mystery meat and ate it with the macaroni, it really spiced it up!\\nBiscuits and gravy were also great, but if you don't like your biscuits on the sweet side don't bother... \\n\\nI've also had their chicken fried steak which was very good. And their burger was also good. Although I didn't think they were worth the price. I tried their berry lemonade and there were far to many fruit in it I felt like I was eating fruit through a straw.. \\n\\nNow everybody seems to rave about their baked goods but I'm not feeling it. \\nHad the expresso cheesecake and it was very flavorless!! I was shocked! \\nI've had several cupcakes from them and they don't even measure up to what I whip up in my kitchen and I'm by no means a chef.. I was incredibly disappointed.\\nI also bought a loaf of bread, appreciated the softness and the flavor wasn't bad but it just kinda crumbled apart. You can't really use it for sandwiches or French toast or anything really... \\nHad a lemon bar and it was just ick. It wasn't sweet or tart it was bland and barely even lemon. \\n\\nOther comments: atmosphere maybe like 3 of 5. It tends to get too loud and when they're not busy it gets eerily quiet which makes me feel too uncomfortable to have a conversation. \\n\\nI wouldn't recommend it unless you are only GF and don't mind bad service.

It is our favorite dining experience in all of WDW.  It's not a fine dining restaurant with three Michelin stars, but between the service and the experience of dining outside during Illuminations, it is the one restaurant we look forward to the most each year we visit Disney.\\n\\nThis year's visit was pretty typical.  We make an 8:00 PM reservation so we are just finishing up when Illuminations ends around 9:45 PM.  We always ask for a table close to the water.  The host or hostess always say they'll do their best, but we always get one.  It probably helps that we usually visit in December and many people don't like eating outside in 50-degree weather.\\n\\nWe started with the fruit and cheese plate.  This used to be a really dull first course, but about 3-4 years ago, they started including much tastier cheeses, like Stilton and Irish Cheddar, in addition to the most wonderful onion jam I've ever tasted.  Apparently the onion jam is so popular now, they have pre-printed recipes to hand out to the many diners who request it.\\n\\nWe then moved on to appetizers.  We both had the potato and leek soup, which is always great on a cold night.  This year's version was a little more watery than in the past, but good nonetheless.  This soup is probably one of the best appetizers on the menu.  We avoided it for so many years because it just never sound very tasty.  However, about three years ago we tried it for the first time and have been hooked ever since.\\n\\nFor the main course, the wife had the fish & chips, and I had the steak & fish.  This year we fell back on the more traditional items because we had experimented with so many new dishes over the past several years (pork, lamb, etc.).  However, the fish at R&C is no joke.  It's always fried perfectly and never greasy.  The steak was a perfect medium and very lean.  My Woodpecker Cider was a great complement to both the steak and fish.\\n\\nBy this time, Illuminations was about to begin.  We both ordered tea service as it was getting pretty chilly and windy.  I also ordered a 2 oz. pour of Ferrier Tawny port to warm the bones a bit more.\\n\\nThe one weakness of the R&C has always been their deserts.  Everything is just average.  I really wish they would change the line-up a bit.  The tart, trifle, and pudding have been on the menu for at least 10 years.  However, when eaten during Illuminations, you're so engaged in the fireworks that you don't really care.  This year we tried a new no-bake cheesecake they had on the menu.  It definitely was better than the other desserts, but there was nothing British about it.\\n\\nThe service here is the best you'll find in all of World Showcase.  The British are always polite and full of personality.  However, some credit is due to the management, and I wish Disney would use R&C as a model for how a restaurant should be run."},{"name":"The Thurman Cafe","address":"183 Thurman Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Awesome!

They really try to keep up the Moroccan theme in their decor and serving style, with damp towel on your left shoulder etc. First the decor reminds me basement of a frat house with rusty couches and chairs and rugs hanging on the wall. It makes you want to smoke a hookah hanging out in there, but doesn't really set the mood for food. They also have belly dancing on weekends which is below average - part of the reason being the dancer isn't as fit as a belly dancer is supposed to be for its moves. The place is an absolute ripoff for their terrible quality food.\\n\\nThe service here is pretty good, at least the waitress we had. She was very polite, explained the menu and drinks to us and how we should eat the food that would be served. There was another waiter there that we are happy we didn't get because he must have been stoned out of his head as he came over to our table several times thinking he was waiting on us. Not really sure about that guy. \\n\\nDrinks here are expensive and they tasted very weak.\\n\\nThe food is just horrible. We had the 5 course dinner where you pick your entree and everything else is served family style.\\n1st course - Harrira Moroccan Lentil Soup - Pretty Good. Maybe the other reviews are wrong about the food.\\n2nd course - Moroccan Salads with a Side of Red Harissa - I really liked the spicy dressing that came with this and the salad was ok too. \\n3rd course - Appetizer B'stella - Not real sure if this was an app or dessert? Basically a pastry filled with hen, egg, and other stuff topped with powdered sugar. The egg consistency in it kind of freaked me out. \\n4th course and main entree - Lamb Tajine - Lamb was very tender, but the crap they cooked it in just ruined it. \\nLamb Tajine Morozia - Lamb that tasted like they dumped a 5 lb bag of sugar on it. \\nRoasted Lamb Shank M'Choui - Not too bad on this one, it was actually decent but certainly not worth what they charge.\\nCornish-hen Tajine - Same as the sugary lamb above. A diabetic certainly should not eat at this place. \\n5th course - Dessert With Moroccan Hot Mint Tea - The hot mint tea was great! The dessert sucked; basically it was hot fruit cocktail and a little piece of chocolate filled dough.\\n\\nOur whole party was pretty damn disappointed by our meal. I would probably give this place 1 star if the waitress we had wasn't as nice as she was. My advice is please stay away from this place. My fiance and her sister both had migraines from all the sugar and MSG they put in the food.

No matter. Just go to the pub across the street or to Bread & Butter around the corner for an iced coffee.

They have a decent beer and wine list. \\n\\nEat: Yes, get the oysters. There was someone earlier who reviewed this place based on their burger. Are you insane? It's called Neptune OYSTER. What the eff else would you get? Oh right, their super famous lobster roll, which comes either hot and buttered or cold and mayo-ed. We had it hot and it was straightforward and delectable. Yum. The crudo wasn't bad either. \\n\\nWear: Some St. James. Fisherman's scarf and beard optional. \\n\\nGo with: Just one other person. The table wait is long, you guys."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"When I first went to Neptune Oyster in 2009, I didn't know much about the place. Namely, I didn't know it was so honking popular, and I didn't know it was so honking popular for its lobster rolls.\\n\\nTurns out I still did okay - after a second visit, I can say with confidence that the crown jewel of this New England seafood mecca is the juicy, meaty Neptuneburger.\\n\\nNeptune does not take reservations, and apparently showing up at 7:30 on a Thursday was very naive.  We went to Daily Catch instead and came back before noon the next day.  Had we come any later, we would have met the same fate.\\n\\nOur party of four sat at the counter and managed to dine family style without too much difficulty.  The service was reasonable enough, and the food came out fast.\\n\\nThe food was delicious.  We started with oysters and an octopus cocktail.  The oyster menu is expansive and seasonal, and every oyster I've had has been superb.  This time I enjoyed a firm, crisp Kusshi and a larger, briny Wellfleet that had a great sweet finish.  The octopus cocktail was likewise tasty and refreshing, with top notch seafood and clean ceviche flavors.\\n\\nWe shared two Maine lobster rolls, the bronzini, and a Neptuneburger.  Neptune is known for the lobster rolls, and we tried both the hot and cold versions, which came with butter and mayo, respectively.  They were $25 each and while they were scrumptious, so was the $13 roll at James Hook.  But that isn't a real complaint - the serving of lobster was generous, and both preparations showed strength in the sheer quality of the meat.  Robed in butter, the hot lobster roll boasts pure, satisfying flavors and a nice meatiness to the huge chunks of lobster.  The mayo on the cold roll was just enough to bind, and though the cold was not equal to the hot, it was quite nice.  One actual gripe is that the rolls were just not exciting.  Even the plain hot dog buns were a missed opportunity (for more butter, mainly).\\n\\nThe whole grilled bronzini was a fabulous entree, with a delicate texture to the fish.  It didn't yield to the fork in flakes, but it wasn't mushy, either.  It was served alla cinque terre, with basil pesto, fingerlings, and fennel salad, in a shallow pool of tomato-olive broth.  The flavors were broad and soothing.  But the winner was still the Neptuneburger, that juicy cheddar cheeseburger with fried oysters, garlic mayo, and that irresistible relish.  Forget seafood for a second.  Choose meat.\\n\\nEverything is great, though, and I don't actually recommend forgoing the incredible array of fresh seafood.  Get your lobster roll (hot), and get your burger on top.  And if you want to eat at all, show up early."},{"name":"Chi Phi - A Taste of Two Cities","address":"68 E Pine St","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"A friend posted something about Chi Phi on Facebook yesterday, and as soon as I saw it, my boyfriend and I decided we needed to try it immediately.

He had some type of Italian Beef thing (can't figure out the name by looking at the menu, sorry) and enjoyed it. We shared Chi Phi Fries and they were AMAZING. Just like Chickie's and Pete's with the cheese sauce. They really nailed the taste of Philly with this one. I had the Philly Cheese Steak Egg Rolls which were pretty good. There was a slightly odd taste to them -- maybe the oil they're fried in -- but I still enjoyed them and finished every bite.\\n\\nPrice was good, too. $16 for everything listed above, plus a large Dr. Pepper. Not bad at all.\\n\\nNow, onto the atmosphere: Really cool. They have a large Jenga set and life-size Connect Four that we had a good time with.

I preferred the cold rolls vs. the hot ones, but they were both good. They truly let the lobster shine without putting too much mayo or butter; the lobster itself was very sweet and delicious. I wish I had a big enough stomach for the other dishes. I kept eyeing the table next to us and I was salivating, even though I was already full from what we had.  \\n\\nAs others have mentioned, the wait is super long if you do not get there 30 mins before opening (approx. 2hr wait; restaurant is really small). However, the food I believe is well worth it. They do take your name and number down and call you when your table is ready.

The draft beer list is small as well, but, at least during my visit, everything on it was a really solid choice. It's especially nice that they let you get a slightly smaller pour for a dollar off the pint price. From the looks of it, the wine menu is good too. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is fine, nothing special - it kinda feels like a high end 3rd wave coffee shop, which is to say it isn't very comfortable, there's a lot of wood, and the aesthetic is decidedly minimalist.

And 'cause I'm married to a Dominican. So what, right? Well, Chago's is Puerto Rican. I know you don't understand. It's pretty much a battle of which country makes the best Mofongo, (or Mofo, as I like to call it.)\\n\\nYou see, Mofo is a dish made of plantains that are mashed with cracklings, garlic, olive oil, and broth poured on top, then served with your choice of meat.  Dominicans say their Mofo is the best, and Puerto Ricans say theirs is. So which is best? The Puerto Rican Mofo or the Dominican Mofo? That's a topic for another day.

Let's not point fingers and accept the facts: \\n\\n1. You can find Mofo at Chago's. \\n2. It's amazing!\\n\\nI had mine with churrasco (skirt steak) and a garlic based broth.

When we walked in, the place was pretty empty. You would think that the waitress would be right over, however, that did not happen. She was too busy socializing with her friends. After about 20 minutes she finally comes over and says \\"Hey man what can I get for you.\\" I guess she thinks she is working at Dicks Last Resort. Ordered the burger and fries. If you are expecting actual fries, you will be disappointed since what they give you are new potatoes that are cut and burned. My boyfriend got the same thing and he was pulling out burned potatoes left and right. During our meal the waitress never came by to ask how our food was or to refill our drinks. It was only when we were about to leave that someone asked if they could refill our drinks.\\n\\nSo, now it's time to pay. I know waitresses need their tips, however, they also need to EARN their tips. Typically if we have had bad service it is generally because they are just having a bad day. The bad service we received is due to the waitress not wanting to do her job which resulted in her not receiving a tip. There was another waitress who I wish we would have had because she was attentive to her customers.

We ordered the Margherita pizza for $20. And while the pizza was a decent size, there was very little in the way of toppings for a pizza that price. The crust was the biggest I've ever seen on a pizza, which in my opinion is not what I look forward to when I order a pizza. If I could order a pizza crustless and get more of the cheesy, meaty part, I would do it every time. In addition, our crust was a bit burnt and not the tastiest. We left a lot of the crust untouched, which is not a good sign for a \\"good\\" quality pizza. There is also no service here as everything is self-service. From waiting in line to order the pizza, to getting your own water, picking up the pizza and utensils, and cleaning up after yourselves, it felt more like a fast food joint than a decent sit down restaurant.

Cocktails at sunset can't be beat.\\n2. Probably the best sushi roll (The Deluxe Roll) I have had in quite a while. It was beautiful, fresh, and full of flavor. \\n\\nNot Good\\n1. Unless you have the best luck in the world, there is no chance you will get a seat at any of the tables, benches, booths, or bar stools in the bar area. It was LOUD and packed to the gills. If you make dinner reservations and want to go for cocktails ahead of time, do it somewhere else. \\n\\n2. The entree portion of the menu. Clearly, this restaurant's hefty price tag is for the ambiance because the food definitely is not good enough to warrant the enormous prices. \\nI ordered the Apple Smoked Pork Chops and my date ordered a steak. My chops tasted nothing of apple nor smoke. The only sign of grilling were the grill marks. They were tough and under seasoned. The mashed potatoes served with them tasted exactly like boxed potatoes. They had that thin grainy texture you get from those boxed powdered potatoes. The green beans were bland as well but at least fresh. My date ordered a $63 steak. When the waiter asked him what kind of potatoes he wanted, he gave him a choice of mashed, baked, or a garlic potato dish with Bearnaise sauce. He chose the garlic potatoes. When his dinner showed up, there were 5 waffle fries with yellow sauce on them. The same type of fries that come in a bag in your grocer's frozen section. We could not believe this is what they served with a $63 steak! What was worse, the fries tasted like a sour salt lick if that even makes sense.\\n\\nOverall, the Portland City Grill has a view that can't be beat, no complaints there. They have a decent wait staff, and have a nice cocktail menu. In my opinion, the best way to enjoy PCG is in a happy hour/drinks and appetizers capacity.

I own, not only a coffee machine but also an espresso maker and for reasons I can only explain as extreme laziness have been entirely dependent on this local spot, frequenting often. Each and every time something has gone awry. As per usual I'll use yelp to air my complaints. Here are a few examples. \\n\\nVisit 1: Hungover... Bacon egg and cheese on everything, large iced - black, to go. Enjoying my first breakfast sandwich was not possible as I was marooned in the Boston harbor on a sailboat with no condiments to lube the crusty dry bagel with a fried \\"over-hard\\" egg down my throat. The 12 pack of Amstel Lite cans I had procured at the goose couldn't even water this arid sandwich down. \\n\\nVisit 2: Hungover again... Repeated the order and managed to grease the sandwich down with ketchup and butter. However my girlfriend ordered a custom turkey, mayo, cheese on a wheat bagel. I know, queue the barf bag... Not surprisingly I had finished eating by the time her order came completely f'd up. I won't go into details because she deserved it but I had to wait another 20 minutes for the revised monstrosity to show up. \\n\\nVisit 3: Dazed but not hungover. Long line (expected). I ordered a double iced espresso. Waiting... Waiting... A couple minutes later was asked \\"that espresso to go?\\", Confused but clear response \\"yes\\". Espresso came hot, however the sweet, cute barista realized her mistake as soon as she saw my face and quickly remedied. \\n\\nVisit 4: Gin hangover. With 25 minutes to catch a train at north station I figure it was best to forgo ordering food, speed is not their strong suite. \\"large iced coffee please\\". 5 or so minutes later I politely remind them they forgot to pour it and the always chipper young ladies reminded me that sometimes I just need to \\"stay on them\\".\\n\\n***Disclaimer: staff extremely friendly but have the work ethic of the French.

The restaurant was in a neighborhood that looked very cozy and nice, so we went out to walk around.\\n Coming back in half hr, we wanted to check to see how the line would go. The hostess approached us 10min later and told us that we couldn't wait there due to the small walking space, and that she would give us a call when it was our turn. Her words could have been more friendly instead of saying \\"You can't wait here, you have to go walk around\\". When we left, I assumed that she would phone call us as we did leave our phone numbers and since the hour wait was just an approximate. \\nWhen it was 8.05, we decided to leave the cafe shop that we sat in, and go back to check. Upon arrival, there were already a line in front of us consisting of either people waiting to be seated, or waiting to put their names down. When we entered the restaurant attempting to ask if the hostess had called our names, a few other customers stepped up and said that we must wait in line and the hostess has not gotten to them yet. After I explained to them that we had already placed our name an hour ago, we were still being pushed to the back of the line, outside. \\n\\nThe hostess later sat us down at 8.40pm, an hr later than our expected time. On her list, I saw that there were already two parties' names that she crossed off, both parties did have the same number of guests as us, so I was not happy since we didn't hear her call us at all, despite standing near the door. She later confirmed that she had not called our name, but she did sit the other two parties down at 8.10?! Do you not sit your guests by the guest list? Or else what's the purpose of creating one in the beginning?\\n\\nWe weren't too hungry because it was already pretty late. So we shared a few oysters and a seafood stew. The food was fresh and tasty, but with the previous encounters during the wait-time, it was really hard to be all excited and happy about the visit. \\n\\nOur waitress was nice and helpful as she explained to us the variety of oysters and offered to bring us bread for our stew. \\n\\nFood: 4 stars\\nService: 3 stars\\nHostess: 0 stars\\nEnvironment: 2 stars"},{"name":"Portland City Grill","address":"111 SW 5th Ave, Fl 30","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Nice place, fantastic views of the city.

Grapefruit, cherry, peach, pineapple, coconut oil, guarana - I lovelovelove the first two, but I'm not a fan of coconut and I've never really had a peach. But today was a day to try new things, so I just went for it. Holy cow, that smoothie was delicious. Helpful tip - they can't make the stretch armstrong in the 9 oz size, so you have to get the 18 oz or 24 oz. (Totally worth it, though.) My friend got the Busy Bee and that was awesome, as well. (And the name is super cute - how could you go wrong?)\\n\\nI just noticed their juice called the head cheerleader, made with fresh watermelon, lemon, and raspberry juice. Oh. My.

It was ok, but I was definitely underwhelmed after all the hype, and considering how much everything cost. \\n\\nWent here on a business trip to Boston & had about a 60 minute wait on a Wednesday around 6 PM. Put our name on the list, then went to one of the neighboring restaurant for a drink while we waited. This place is TINY and there seems to be a line out the door at all times. \\n\\nOnce we got in, we were sat at one of the tables that are jam packed in the restaurant. We had only a few inches between our table and our 2 neighboring tables. Tried the clam chowder & hot lobster roll. The chowder was disappointing-- runny, luke warm & didn't have a ton of flavor. The lobster roll on the other hand, was very good with more lobster piled on than I've ever seen in a lobster roll-- but for nearly $30 I would expect that. The bread was buttery & crispy on the inside, the lobster was plentiful and also came with melted butter on top. I like butter, so this was good for me! My only complaint was my roll could have been warmer, as parts of the lobster were not hot. I did not complain or send anything back. \\n\\nService was attentive once we sat down, though I did witness the hostess snap at a couple girls that came in and didn't realize there was a line just to put your name on the list.  If you hadn't done research before walking in there, it isn't clear what the process is, so I don't fault the girls for what they did. After the rude treatment from the hostess, the the girls turned around & left after being treated that way. While we had nothing but good service personally, I hate when uber popular places act like this because they know they are going to have a line out the door no matter how they treat people. \\n\\nConsidering the price & the wait times, in a city known for seafood/ lobster, I think I would take my chances somewhere else before coming back here again."},{"name":"Pho Pasteur","address":"682 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Pho Pasteur when it just opened in the mid 90's was good.

My go to meal was always the chicken suizas enchiladas and still is, but they changed the chicken some time ago and instead of nice white chicken breast, it's orange and not nearly as good. They also changed the rice and it's only fractionally as good as it used to be. The margaritas (frozen) are still great and they have a unique and tasty salsa that I like.

Since I ate at Magnolia this morning, I will crown it the winner. Amazingly, Magnolia Cafe earns this rating from me based almost exclusively on the Love Migas.  It improves on already-fantastic migas through the addition of a garlic and serrano butter in the eggs.  The black beans served with it are also tasty, not just a plate filler like they can be at other restaurants.  In addition to the Love Migas, I've also enjoyed the Eggs Zapatino (eggs and queso on an English muffin) and pancakes.  The latter rival Kerbey Lane's famous flapjacks in deliciousness, but are richer and more cakey.

Big disappointment, seriously. If I ever come back here, it definitely won't be my choice.\\n\\nWe had a reservation for 7:30, and we got there about ten minutes early. We checked in with the hostesses, and they said it'd be about 5 minutes. Which is fine, but these girls were A MESS. They got a party of 4 from the bar and were about to sit them, but then told them to wait and gave their table to someone else. That is quite unprofessional. Then, they sat these two girls who got there after us, and I stood there just brooding over having to wait. Finally, the hostesses got their act together and sat us.\\n\\nOur waitress was a hot mess, and I mean that quite literally. It seems that whomever hires these waitresses (all girls) just goes for goo-looking girls, regardless of them being able to do their job. It took about 10 minutes for her to come over and take our drink order, and about another 10 to get our drinks. Then we ordered our entrees, and waited and waited. The people next to us got there later and ate first. I do not exaggerate when I say that a good 40 minutes went by from the moment we ordered to the moment we got our dishes. I had to loudly say that the food was taking FOR-EVER in front of the waitress so that she popped into the kitchen and came out with our food. \\n\\nAnd when we finally got the food, it wasn't as good as I've had it before. I mean, Match is not terrific food, but this was far below their usual level of quality, I guess. My plate looked messy and sort of hastily thrown together. When we were done eating, it took forever for someone to clear our table.\\n\\nBy this time, it's probably around 9, and we really just want to get the hell out of there. The place was extremely loud, the service was horribly slow, and the food was less than satisfying. So we called our waitress over and asked for the check. Except it took her like a good 15 minutes to bring it over. Printing a bill takes no more than a minute and there was nobody else at the register (so it's not like it was busy), but she was just running around waiting for drinks at the bar, or serving entrees or something. I seriously wanted to just get up and leave without paying, because why the hell would we have to wait 15 minutes to pay?! Needless to say, girl did not work for her tip.\\n\\nOverall, I'd think about it twice before coming back here again. The menu is just so uninspired and simple, and yet they can't get it right. The mashed potatoes are bland and lacking seasoning. The chicken I had was tender and juicy, but the \\"mushroom\\" sauce it came with-- well, that was just atrocious. That was like baby vomit or something, totally flavorless and chunky and gross. We got some fries to share, and these tasted like they came out of a bag in the freezer. Frozen fries are OK at the Cheesecake Factory, but for a place this trendy and expensive, I would've hoped for something more homemade-looking. If I were to pay regular price for this food, I would be very, very upset by the end of my meal.\\n\\nI doubt I'll go back."},{"name":"Scampo","address":"215 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I had a business dinner here and like the hotel it was / is great. We had a table near the busy kitchen so it was a tad loud but not bad. I didn't select the starters but we had burrata, beets, dates, & honey crisp apple with curly endive & brown butter dressing. You can't go wrong with burrata although I'm not a fan curly endive - I find it a hard restaurant salad to eat- there's no delicate way to eat it as the curly leaves are sticking out every which way. It's almost a better green to be eaten in the comforts of your own home and not a fancy restaurant. We also had souffl√© potatoes and root chips, which was interesting. The souffl√© potatoes were light and delicate so not like a nochi which is denser and the root chips made it more seasonal. The 2 of us had miso glazed Scottish salmon which was perfectly cooked with the skin on and so delicious with saut√©ed snow peas and creamed purple potatoes ($34). Another person had the spaghetti with black pepper, which is typically a second dish or accompaniment to an entree. We had the German chocolate cake roll and gelato, which was nicely presented but a bit dry - it appeared the cake and coconut/nutty filling were made separately and then combined for the affect.

Right off the bat, we ordered two lobster rolls - one hot, one cold that came w/ fries on the side.  Both hands down the best lobster roll I've ever had with plump, succulent, fresh lobster but I had the hardest time choosing which one I liked more.  Hot soaking w/ butter vs. cold tossed with mayo - I ultimately went w/ the cold.  We also got the Neptunes on Piggyback (crispy oysters, Berkshire Pig, raisin confit, pistachio aioli) which was damn good.  Never would've though a fried oyster would go so well w/ pork but there are probably very few things in life that don't go w/ Berkshire.  Everything worked super well together.  Disappointingly though, the clam chowder was bland and needed pepper to have some flavor.  Don't get me wrong, it was good especially w/ the potatoes cooked harder than most and just having a fresh quality to it, but bland is bland.

I had a shrimp fahita burrito.  The shrimp was cooked well, the veggies were crisp, and chips were fresh and yummy.   The prices were also reasonable and they had several tables outside to eat at.  I wasn't won over though for a couple reasons.\\n\\n Disappointment #1 - The menu states that all entrees come with rice and beans.  I thought based on the menu that this would be a platter type of thing with beans and rice on the side but it was all inside the burrito I guess.  That wouldn't be a deal breaker but it didn't set up the rest of the food well to have your expectations already lowered.\\n\\nDisappointment #2 - The flavor in the burrito was very bland.  I started piling on the hot salsa to at least increase the heat inside of it.  I do admit that maybe I should have ordered the custom burrito so I could make it exactly how I want but since it was my first time there I thought I would give one of their entrees a chance.  I did take my leftovers home and jazz it up with some fresh lime juice and red sauce and it brought out more flavor... but I shouldn't have to do that.\\n\\nI doubt I will ever go back to Aprisa.

It was very good, actually just as good as a similar offering at a certain fine dining restaurant beginning with the letters \\"G\\" and \\"P.\\"  It was a bit greasy as befits such a dish, but the greens it was served with helped with that, and the chutney and mustard served to top the sandwich with were great complements to the cheesy goodness.\\n\\nWe all liked the other food that we ordered, though perhaps not as well as the appetizer.  My oysters were decent for being in a land-locked part of the state, and the homemade chips that accompanied them were fine once I blotted off some of the grease (remember, I was a bit ill at the time).  Of course the broccoli was good, especially in texture ... it was neither too crunchy nor too limp.\\n\\nThe others' food didn't seem appetizing to me (sick, remember!) so all that I sampled was a bit of my friends mac and cheese, which was good, not great.  My husband wanted me to try his reuben but I do not really enjoy any of the components of such a sandwich even when well, so I abstained.  But he apparently enjoyed it as well as his pea salad.  My friend's pork chop was a beautiful piece of meat but I didn't want to ask her for a bite since it was also fairly expensive.  She'd been wondering if her green beans would be of the preparation that was the daily special (can't remember what the variation was), but they weren't.  She said they were still good as green beans go.\\n\\nWe of course saw some tempting desserts in the display case, but we were all quite full, so we decided that would be an adventure for next time.

The aromas in the restaurant were fantastic. We had a long wait, but they will call/text you to let you know when your table is ready so we could walk around the shops until then. The restaurant itself is really appealing to the eye. Dark wood tables, low lighting, and beautiful views of the pier. Our waiter, Tom, was wonderful, attentive, and funny! We had our three kids with us, and they had an extensive kid's menu. Two of my kids got the linguini in garlic butter with shrimp, and my third got the snow crab legs cluster. In her words, \\"They were good, but a lot of work!\\" I was debating between one of their Seafood boils and the cioppino and ultimately went with the cioppino. It was excellent-full of flavor and a good amount of seafood. I also had a house salad to start and the veggies were fresh and the dressing very light. The birthday man ended up with the King Crab and shrimp boil (build your own). Honestly, I was really excited for him because it would be his first King Crab experience, and he deserved it! The reason for the star knocked off is because of his meal. When it came out I was disappointed for him, and I could see he was too. They gave him 1 large King Crab leg with the smaller knuckle, and his shrimp were extremely underwhelming and small. (However, the shrimp in my cioppino were my favorite part). For the uber expensive price you pay you would expect a more visually appealing and filling dinner (there were potatoes and corn in the boil as well, but not aplenty). Also, I did see another customer who got the Lobster boil, and the amount of food in her bowl looked excellent. They also served pull part rolls with cinnamon sugar butter. The butter was good, but I'm a weirdo who doesn't really like sweet things with my entrees and I would have liked regular butter. Tom was great in that when I asked for a spoon for my cioppino broth he told me I really needed a loaf of bread to sop up the broth and brought one. Too bad I don't like \\"soggy bread\\" (again, a weirdo, I know!). The restaurant very generously complimentarily brought out their flourless chocolate cake in honor of his birthday (my 6 year old graciously told them). It was incredible and big enough/rich enough for the entire family to share and be sweetly satisfied.\\n\\nTom contributed to our great night and should be commended.

We have spent many special occasions here and the food is beyond yummy. The service, however is the only reason we will not be back. We decided to celebrate my parents 50th wedding anniversary here last week. Big deal, right?  I told the not so friendly hostess when we made the reservations that this was a very celebratory occasion. Her attitude alone should have been a clear indication of the events that were to unfold. She didn't seem interested at all. Also mentioned we would be bringing a cake which she stated was fine. When we got there we were seated by the bathroom. The hostesses crotch length dress was also a bit much for a Tuesday night. My 12 year old niece was a bit dismayed. My husband had arrived first and explained that the table they had chosen was not ideal so they did move us to a beautiful table. Not once did the server acknowledge the occasion (the cake with Happy 50th Anniversary was indication #2 of the occasion). The food was pretty good as usual but it then took close to 30 minutes to clear the table (we had my 2 year old with us but he was on his best behavior). I asked for dressing on the side for my salad but they did not include dressing on ANY of the salads. I'm not one to complain but I just feel like there could have been more attention paid to us and especially my parents for this memorable event. We won't be back.

Jam wasn't that full yet, but we got there just as they were sitting several larger groups.  I inquired about the wait and the hostess said that since we were only 2, we'd be seated in about 5 minutes, which seemed optimistic.  Lo and behold, she asked if we wanted to sit at the bar about 5 minutes later, but we refused and said we'd wait for a table, since we knew the food would take a while (because of the large groups) no matter when we sat down.  But my wife asked if she could get some coffee and the hostess quickly grabbed us 2 mugs of coffee, cream and a dish of sugar.  Definitely beyond what she needed to do, but also something that makes the waiting customer happier.\\n\\nWe got seated shortly thereafter and were promptly given menus.  I'm not a big fan of their menu style, which can be a little hard to decipher.  And I agree with another review that it doesn't look all that kid friendly, but since we didn't have the kids, we didn't see a possible kid menu.  \\n\\nAnyway, food did take forever.  I actually went across the street and got a croissant from Grand Central to tide us over.  But the coffee kept coming and there were lots of apologies about the wait.  As an update, Jam uses Portland Coffee Roasters (according to their menu) not Stumptown, as a prominent review claims.  They must have changed at some point.  The coffee was strong and hot, but the long wait did get me pretty caffeinated.  The food was just fine when it arrived, but my scramble was missing the bacon that I had ordered.  The server was obviously irritated that we had to wait so long and the kitchen couldn't even get my order right.  I said I'd be fine with a side of bacon, but he brought me a box to take home the erroneous order and brought me a whole new order, complete with bacon.  AND he comp'd my meal, which I thought was going way beyond my expectations.  \\n\\nJeez, this is probably the longest review I've ever written.  Suffice it to say that the service was very attentive and the food was good.  The kitchen at Jam needs to work on keeping up with big tables and perhaps they could have some pastries on the menu (besides the biscuits, which they were out of) to tide customers over.

I finally found my way over on that side of town. Well, actually I drove 20 minutes out of my way to go to Mary's Pop Shop. I had a hankering for some true gelato. When I got there, I conveniently remembered that I had not had breakfast yet. So I decided to have the breakfast sandwich with fresh sliced avocado, tomato, crumbled feta cheese, fried egg on toast. I love how everything Ken, the owner and chef, makes is so fresh. Gosh, that sandwich was so good. Remembering that I had come in for some gelato, (of course after I ate the entire sandwich) I decided to get the gingersnap cookie with cappuccino gelato sandwich. I ate it as I drove away, happily,with the Rittenhouse salad, sitting next to me, that I was going to have for dinner. So, Yep, I pretty much ate breakfast lunch and dinner with Mary's pop shop. The cookie was amazing, The cappuccino gelato in the cookie sandwich was smooth and delicious. Eating while driving, was not the smartest thing I've done. But, dang, it was so good. When I got home I put the Rittenhouse salad in the refrigerator and went to a couple of appointments. Later that evening, I had my Rittenhouse salad. The homemade balsamic vinaigrette is fresh and perfect. The nice fresh mescaline greens with the candied nuts and cranberries mixed with the homemade balsamic vinaigrette was the perfect ending to my Sunday.

I have been coming to this restaurant for a couple years now. I have celiac disease so I have to avoid gluten and this restaurant has been a godsend. However on multiple occasions the food has been undercooked to the point that it was inedible. On one occasion it was the calamari and the pizza that I bought and now this morning I went to the buffet and they have an avocado dish and the avocado is sliced in half and stuffed. My avocado was completely rotten and I don't mean it had a dark spot, I mean the entire thing was rotten and black. My daughter got the same dish and hers was a beautiful light green like you would expect an avocado to be, so this had nothing to do with cooking. The bacon was undercooked and the eggs were cold. When I spoke to my waitress about it she mentioned something in the back but she didn't credit my bill and the same thing happened when they messed up my calamari and the pizza the last time. They never credited my bill either that time. The food here is not cheap. The buffet that I just attended was $19.95. and I had to pay that full-price despite the fact that the food was rotten. \\nIt's really unfortunate because as a Celiac I'm very limited in the places that I can eat and it feels like the staff here do not understand the importance of this establishment to people like myself.

The food was so bland and boring that I didn't bother giving it a second shot.  Each time the ladyfriend said \\"Let's get Indian!\\", I'd pick one of the dozen sushi places in the area to go to instead.  My love for sushi knows no bounds and the ladyfriend is never one to argue with more sushi in our lives.\\n\\nSo when the ladyfriend wanted to go this week, I finally relented.  After hearing so many people rave about Anmol, I figured we should give it a go.  First, because I was hungry and would eat just about anything at that time, and second because it is in my hometown so I just like to go there.\\n\\nNow, I remember this place when it was the Wine Cellar and, decor-wise, not much has changed, apparently.  Some Indian decor has gone up, but everything else has stayed the same...and I like that.  Reminds me of a simpler time when Beverly wasn't chock full of overpriced gastropubs where everyone is tripping over each other to get you to spend $8 on a triplesecretdoubleprobationhopped IPA or something (and I can be a bit of a beer snob).  It seems like each time an old Beverly establishment goes away, what takes its place is something to drag the yuppies out of the Farms to dine with the commonfolk.  There are few places left in Beverly where a good meal is met with a modest beer selection and a \\"broken in\\" feel to the establishment...and Anmol has that.  No pretentiousness, just a relaxed atmosphere and good eats.  Novel concept, eh?\\n\\nNow to the food itself, if I knew this is what you could get with Indian food I would have given in ages ago.  This place is to Indian food what Cielito Lindo is to Mexican, you can go elsewhere and get bland boring crap that will distort your idea of what is possible for this food or you can go here and get the real thing done right.\\n\\nWe got the anmol mixed platter, the tandoori mixed grill and the keema naan.  I wasn't sure how much food to expect...it ended up being a lot.  Despite being super hungry, we both ended up with very large lunches the next day.  I could go on and on about the food, but my words don't do it justice - it is hard to explain what awesome tastes like.\\n\\nAs for the service, while the waiter was eerily quiet, he was attentive as all hell and very pleasant.

Unfortunately, reality fell short of expectation. Early seating, nice enough vibe, music and smells were good. Within 10 minutes of opening the place as slammed. All bodes well. Our server, a pleasant enough gentleman, took our drink order, brought glasses, then proceeded to handle drinks and take food orders from a larger table seated after us, all before coming back with our wine.   By the time our first food order came from the kitchen, it'd been 50 minutes since we were seated without a single acknowledgement from our server, except to pour more of the bottle of wine we'd ordered to go with our meal.  The staggered service meant to promote sharing, seemed to mean that the plates that began to trickle  of the kitchen have no relation to anything. We received a starch, some potatoes to go with our wine. Then two staggered entr√©es. It wasn't until the very end when we actually received a protein in close proximity to a vegetable side. Ordering more wine meant a wait of more than ten minutes while I watched my food grow cold and my server clear plates and other tasks. When I finally caught his eye to ask about my wine, I was brusquely informed that it was on its way. \\nThe plates themselves were varied. Each dish seemed a touch under seasoned and required salt, which was thoughtfully provided on the table.\\nAll in all an underwhelming event and an attitude that difficult to stomach.  We never know what is going on in the lives of those around us, perhaps our server was going through a rough time, perhaps it was an off night.  In truth, I don't know.

I am not one to deal with long lines either and didn't travel from SF to Portland to stand and wait. Given the number of positive reviews I was afraid of the waiting game. \\n\\nHOWEVER, the bf convinced me to just \\"check out the wait\\" and if it's long, we'd just bounce and nibble at the food truck corner. We were seated immediately (it was 6:00ish pm on a Monday night). The ambience upon entry, as with any upscale restaurant, was pleasant, the lighting was dim, and the waiting staff were great. I never noticed the waiter refilling my water cup but somehow it was constantly being refilled. This is the mark of a fantastic waiter! \\n\\nSome snacks on the table were house-made corn nuts. If you like corn nuts you'll love these and if you don't, well, they may still tickle your fancy. The dishes here come out as they are made and are meant to be eaten family style (the chef's vision for food). I really appreciated this since the dishes were served at their optimal temperatures etc etc. \\n\\nWe ordered: \\n1.) farm salad--this was delicious and had pickled fennel and a very light but refreshing vinaigrette. Nothing mind blowing but it's a salad and I would totally order it again. Great blend of seasonal vegetables. \\n--\\n2.) Hmong style beef tartare--this was just AMAZING. According to our waiter, the chef's inspiration was pho and so this was a deconstructed rendition of pho. I was skeptical at first since I grew up with a pretty strong Vietnamese culture. However, the tartare was unimaginably flavorful. Interestingly, the tartare alone without the side pairings tasted nothing of pho but upon combining it with its sides, it tasted just like it. I thought it would be off-putting but I was definitely proven wrong on this one. This ranks as one of the most delicious and enticing Asian fusion dishes I've ever eaten. \\n--\\n3.) Iberico pork-- dear goodness, right when I thought the Hmong beef couldn't be topped, this dish came out. The richness of the pork and fattiness from the acorns were heightened by its preparation (perhaps grilled with a light char?) and was married beautifully to the sauce plated beneath the meat. It tasted like an olive oil emulsion with red peppers and pine nuts. Seriously a match made in heaven. I would strongly STRONGLY recommend this dish and would come back to eat it again. \\n--\\n4.) grilled octopus w/ olives-- phenomenal. The octopus could not have been grilled more perfectly. It was tender, juicy, flavorful and when combined with a spritz of lemon, some roasted garlic, butter, and olives...wow what an explosion of flavors. It was rich in the best way possible but strangely not heavy. We ordered some bread on the side (they gave us the delicious rustic kind of bread) to soak up the olive oil/ butter that the octopus was resting in and it really took the dish home. \\n\\nNone of the dishes were over-salted, which is amazing since many restaurants compensate for their lack of flavor by making the food saltier. I am extremely sensitive to salt and tend to swell up when I'm eating overly salty foods. Having said this, it was definitely not undersalted either. Simply. Just. Perfect. \\n\\nIf only this restaurant weren't so far away!!!

And my goodness! All of them were so good and very authentic too. BOTH my mom and aunt were impressed, and that says a lot. \\n\\nMy mom was raving about the steamed fish. She said that it's almost impossible to find this specific dish anywhere anymore, and to find it made so well too... she was happy. \\nMy aunt never has more than one bite of dandan noodles anywhere we go, but she had a few bowls and was even drinking the soup (my jaw almost dropped). \\nFor me, I enjoyed every dish. I usually don't eat fish but I was picking at it until there was none left! Also, this place has become my favourite place for dandan noodles. The spicy level is just right, the soup isn't too thick, and the texture of the noodles were perfect. \\n\\nThe only reason why they lost one star was because of the service - the restaurant was completely filled during lunch hour and there was only ONE server (the only other one ran to the back to help with the cooking). The server looked so exhausted, I felt so bad! But at the same time, we couldn't get our tea/water refilled (all of our dishes are spicy too). She would place our dishes down at the very edge of the table and walk away right away while you were talking to her or look super pissed off if we asked her for water. There were customers standing at the front door for 15 minutes and being ignored - thank goodness they were patient.\\n\\nOverall, I would definitely come back. The food is amazing. So glad that I don't have to go all the way to Richmond anymore. But I won't be coming back during peak ours. I read other reviews and can see that they only ever have 1-2 servers.

I would say that the food is very good but not worth a 1-2 hour wait imo. That is not a shot at the quality of food here or the level of service, but I don't want to spend a whole afternoon waiting to eat a meal. \\n\\nWe showed up on Friday afternoon around 11:30 am and didn't get a table (expected) but were put on a wait list and were told the wait would be ~45 min.

There is no free bread here but this dish is inexpensive and a good starter.

Ok this was obviously a very good lobster roll but when account for the time to wait for it, I'm not sure this is exactly worth waiting for. Come with a large heaping of fries and definitely very filling. I would say it's a good meal but not a MUST HAVE every time. \\n- Lastly we got the scallops with bacon and corn.

It was much better than standing around watching the other patrons enjoy their meals, and is probably necessary as Neptune is a tiny dining spot.\\n\\nWe ordered Neptunes on Piggyback, which are fried oysters on top of a crostini with shredded pork, greens, and golden raisins.  Delish.   We also got an order of the PEI Mussels, which are served in a red curry sauce with chopped cashews, cilantro, and lime juice.  This was probably my favorite part of the meal.  SO delicious.  The sauce was so good that we asked for some bread to soak up the remaining sauce, and I even had a brief moment of considering putting the bowl to my face and just drinking the rest of it.  Lastly, we shared a hot buttered lobster roll.  It was everything we expected and more.  Just large, juicy chunks of lobster covered in delicious butter atop a soft, buttery brioche roll.  Fries on the side were delish, too, but when paired with lobster, who cares about anything else.  \\n\\nThey also had several craft brews on tap and in bottles.

For those new to real ramen, throw away all the opinions you have based on the instant cup noodles you were budgeted on back in college. Real ramen is in a whole other class. It's like comparing a Hungry Man Salisbury Steak with a Dry Aged Kobe.  Real ramen involves days of devotion to produce deep, complex broths, handmade noodles, and delicious toppings - extremely rare to have around here. There are probably less than 5 places in the southeast that I would recommend having ramen at, and this place tops that list.\\n\\nTonkotsu refers to the ramen's broth and is loosely translated to \\"pork-bone\\". It's generally created by boiling pork bones for days and gets its creamy, porky taste from the collagen that dissolves into the broth. It differs from the usual ramens you'll find at other Japanese places that often only offer Shio (salt) or Shoyu (Soy Sauce) chicken based broths. Yakitori Jinbei finishes theirs with some chewy ramen noodles, a few slices of melt in your mouth, slow cooked pork belly, and a healthy handful of vegetables. The combination of flavors is out of this world. \\n\\nWhy take my word for it? I'm a bit of a Ramen nut. I've subscribed to Momofuku's quarterly magazine just for their issue based on Ramen. I have spent countless days and money trying to perfect my own Ramen broths at home. I even have posters of Yamada and Yamagishi San (Ramen Gods of Japan) hung in my office.\\n\\nFor those wondering how the rest of Yakitori Jinbei stacks up: the D√©cor is typical of most Japanese places with a sushi bar and lots of booth seating. The menu is traditional dishes and rolls with the addition of a pretty good yakitori selection of local farm raised chicken that have been skewered and wood grilled - pretty tasty. Service is consistently good even during busy times and my green tea is always filled promptly. I wasn't too impressed with some of the sushi and other dishes I sampled which most folks usually look for when dining Japanese; to be honest though, I usually don't come there for anything besides ramen. \\n\\nI'm sure ample emphasis has been made throughout this review why I'd recommend going here. If you want to try \\"real\\" ramen, Yakitori Jinbei will not disappoint.

I got really lucky, or 2.) Most of the people that reviewed this place came here in the first couple of weeks expecting a new cafe to be the end-all/be-all restaurant.  Come on people, this place isn't expensive considering the times, and it definitely serves good food...if you want perfection, expect to drop $25+...  Some people are so clueless.\\n\\nAnyway, here is my take.  (4.5 stars with a little room to improve-since there is always room for improvement).\\n\\nI went in today (Thursday 5/19) around lunch time.  Service was quick, although the place was filling up.  Jill was my server and was on point from the start.  I believe the other nice lady brought me a water.  I am all for servers helping each other out.  Jill was attentive, but not pushy and she offered me the breakfast menu when I said I wasn't sure what I wanted.  I am a late riser, and I love breakfast at lunch time.  During the week it's that more of a treat!!!  \\n\\nI had a cheese omelette w/sausage thrown in and it was great!!!  Easily up there with some of the best I have had.  Potatoes where perfect, on the dark and crispy side, oh and large to boot.  That are how home fries should be!!!  Toast were served w/o butter, with real butter on the side.  My large iced coffee was served w/cream, and sugar was on the table.  Everything was to perfection, and the price w/tax was just over $10.  I can go down the street and get a breakfast sandwich and a large Iced for almost as much and it isn't going to fill me up for a long time, and it's going to cost almost as much...   \\n\\nJust from what I saw, the lunch menu looked interesting and I definitely want to try some of there specials...but breakfast was so good, it may be hard to get me away from what I already know to be near perfection.\\n\\nHonestly, I wouldn't change a thing, well except some of the pretentious customers.  By the way, I scanned some of the tables and everyone looked like they had good food and were happy.  It's hard to believe I got lucky...but for some of the nay-sayer's, I suggest trying them again and preferably not when they are getting slammed by the Sat/Sun brunch crowd."},{"name":"Food 101","address":"4969 Roswell Rd, Ste 200","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Great Service!!

I've always liked the food and had trouble branching out from my absolute favorites, and the service has been friendly and tip-worthy. I make a point of eating on the early side, as the place does fill up with families around 5:30-6pm, so be aware of that, if kiddos are not your thing. If you join their email club, they give you a free entree and dessert on your birthday, and I've had many. Ordinarily I'd give them 4-5 stars for living up to expectations.\\n\\nLately I've noticed a disturbing trend, which may be a management oversight problem. They've started offering a 20% discount on takeout on game days, which is great if you need to drum up business and you can actually handle the crush; unfortunately the last few times I've been there when the offer is on (once for eat in, seated at the \\"pizza bar,\\" and twice for takeout), they seem less and less able to cope with the pressure. The kitchen has its limitations - one pizza oven, and one or two pizza chefs (it's almost worse when there are two - too much confusion and delayed orders). Also, as mentioned in another review, I noticed the hostess flirting with the bartender rather than helping out the two flustered and overloaded people handling takeout orders & payments. Nobody needed to be seated, so she felt she was just \\"off-duty\\" - meanwhile, at least one customer had been waiting for well over 20minutes for his order. My order was placed around 2:30pm for 5:30pm pickup (by this last attempt I knew how backed up they get, so wanted to give them plenty of time to pull it together), but even so, it didn't come out until perhaps 5:50 (and then I had to rescue it from being given to the wrong customer). It was what my dad calls \\"organized grab-ass\\" up there.\\n\\nThe staff is trying hard, but I don't think the current manager is really on top of things. I've seen him come around - a very pleasant, well-meaning fellow, but he needs to exert a little more control (and perhaps suspend the 20%off deals until they can keep on top of things better). Lastly, the pizza I got with that order was supposed to be a margherita, but there were only a couple whisps of basil on it, and a good third of the periphery of the pie had nothing on it. It was just made toooo quickly; I like toppings right out to the edge, but I know that's not the norm - this was pretty disappointing."},{"name":"La Empanada","address":"325 S Orlando Ave, Ste 1-1","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"I follow them on twitter and found them at OUC with other trucks.

But she was real nice, and had lots of suggestions. \\n\\nPretty impressively, the lady deduced I was a vegetarian in like two minutes without me telling her. She then recommended the grape leaves which were made in-house, and were the 'most delicious things ever', which was a pretty good compliment coming from her because according to herself she was a very 'persnickety grape leave wrap-eater'... She then recommended that I get the secret non-menu advertised euro with stuffed grape leaves sans meat.

Sitting at the bar and watching him work was impressive, he was quick, courteous and just downright rocked his job.\\n\\nGosh, I'm making myself sound really old... \\n\\nThe foodie and holistic nutritionist in me was impressed as the only thing I really wanted was food and there were grass-fed meat, local and organic food options to choose from which made me and my baby happy :-) \\n\\nSo there you have it!

Not really hipster in a good way, either - just kind of, neutral, basic hipster. We're all familiar with the term \\"basic,\\" by now, right? We typically use it to refer to, how shall I put this delicately, those on the bro/frat/sorority spectrum. However, \\"basic\\" can come in many flavors - and I think it's time we add \\"Basic Hipster\\" to our lexicon. \\n\\nAnyway, that's what Jam is: Basic Hipster. And that's not a bad thing! They do hip really well! Our waiter, for example, had a serious hipster schtick: He was deadpan and a little sarcastic. But like, the perfect amount of deadpan sarcastic - his 'tude didn't feel mean-spirited and exclusionary, like a lot of quote-unquote \\"hip\\" service can feel. It just felt like he was having fun at his day job, and letting us in on it a bit. I think that's pretty hard to do well, but he did it.\\n\\nThe food is also Basic Hipster - tons of vegetarian and vegan, and duh: On Hawthorne, which is the most Basic Portland Hipster street of all Basic Portland Hipster streets. OG Hipster, if you will. So's the decor: Lots of quirk, a bit of clutter, lots of color, lots of lighthearted wall-writing, but nothing too studied, nothing too family-unfriendly.\\n\\nThe line out front was also Basic Hipster: Long enough to be Hip, but not so long as to serve as a deterrent. It was also well-managed: Self-serve coffee was available for we queuing weekenders, which goes a long way to making sure we don't leave in a huff, and the time-to-getting-seated estimate was accurate.\\n\\nAs for the specifics of the food, I really appreciated the variety of vittles on offer.

There are maybe 30 seats available, which you cannot reserve. so take some time to wait (the waiter will take your number and you can go and have a drink at one of the many bars in walking distance until you get a table). Oysters are presented at the front window, the decor overall is comfortable and fits the seafood menu.\\n\\nFood:\\nThe PEI mussels were soft, no sand, great mussel taste with a surprisingly well tasting sauce. Not your average garlic white wine sauce, it is spiced up to taste a notch sweeter and very extraordinary - but still supporting the taste of the mussels rather than distracting from it. \\nWe had about 30 oysters and tried all oysters they sold that day. All were excellent in quality (which was certainly supported by the right time of the year for oysters), we specifically liked the Summerside ones.\\nThe Neptunes on Piggyback were fantastic, as well. I always try things in restaurants that I would never put together in one dish myself. Most of the time I find out there is a good reason why I wouldn't and occasionally I have a chance to extend my horizon. The fried oysters and the pig already worked incredibly well together and came on a very tasty bread. The raisins were a fabulous addition to that taste, I simply loved it. I considered ordering it again as a main dish...\\nBut then decided for North End Cioppino, which was a delicious fish stew with saffron rice. Very tasty and the prawns topping the dish were as fresh and moist as they get. Yummy. Some of the fish was a bit dry, but that's to be expected as they provide the flavor for the stew.\\nWe also had pan roasted fish from the daily menu, which came roasted to perfection, extremely moist and very lecker. And least but not last at all Lobster Stroganoff. Wow, that sounds crazy and it tasted very, very well. Not too much cream so that the Lobster taste was strong in the dish. Surprisingly (again!) the Lobster was supported by the mushrooms, rather than put to the background. Just great.\\n\\nDrinks:\\nThe wine selection was really good. We picked a very nice French Sancerre, but I don't remember which one it was. It did go very nice will all our dishes.\\n\\nService:\\nThough no reservations are accepted, you get a call when your table is ready (after you showed up with the complete group).

I am writing this from my first and only experience here, which was, of course, $5 ladies night.  \\n\\nIt was not as overwhelming as I thought it would be for a Thursday night, but the place was packed.  We had a group of 7 and we put our name in for a table an sat at the bar.  About a half hour after I put our name in and told the hostess that we would be at the bar, I got a telephone call asking if we had been accommodated.  I was a little confused that the restaurant would be calling my phone when they knew I was at the bar, and also confused that they didn't know! Anyway, I told her that no, we were waiting at the bar for the table.  I hung up and went to talk in person.\\n\\nAnother 15 minutes goes by and we're now about 4 drinks in (they are so small and overpriced btw) and I get another call!!  The hostess called me, while looking at me from the hostess stand, to tell me that my table was ready.  Talk about laziness and lack of customer service! When I am with a group of friends the last thing I want to do is guard my phone so that i don't miss a call from the restaurant I am standing in!\\n\\nAnyway- onto dinner.  Filet Mignon for $5? We knew that we should prepare for disappointment, and I am glad I did.  Perhaps my medium rare filet was grey because there were seven of us who ordered it? Fine, I can deal with that.  But sandy spinach? Ouch!  Such a weird thing to report but the spinach they put on the side tasted like it had been rolled on the beach before plated. Ugh, fine, so I have grey meat and sandy spinach over dry mashed potatoes.  I should probably tell the waitress that my teeth feel like they are going to split, but, to no surprise, she never came back until our plates had been cleared.  \\n\\nOverall the experience was fun and I would give it a second try.

Hubs wasn't impressed with his sandwich, it didn't have the greatest flavor to it. He did however love the grit casserole that came as a side. I did LOVE my shrimp po boy. It was large shrimps breaded just right with a great sauce to compliment it. The fries that came with it were also very good. I can still taste the meal myself!! \\n\\nLastly, we decided upon the key lime creme brulee for dessert. Another item that was amazing!!! Definitely a different taste to creme brulee, but a familiar taste as the key lime was truly decadent. A must try for sure. \\n\\nHubs and I have been back here once since our first time and we brought his entire family with us and they too raved about the food as well.

I am surprised at the number of 3 star ratings. My husband, who is Mexican, and I decided to give the place a try based on ratings as well as a particular posted photo. I tried the pollo asado (grilled chicken) and my husband ordered his all time fave, chile verde. First of all my pollo asado looked NOTHING like the picture one reviewer posted. The two chicken breasts were paper thin - no exaggeration! There were no grill marks to be had anywhere on the meat. My husband's chile verde, which should be chunks of pork, simmered slowly in a flavorful green chile sauce was simply pathetic. The cubes were about 1/2\\" and they were floating around in a weak verde sauce...no flavor or heat to them at all. To make matters worse, there were literally 10-12 TINY chunks of meat...enough to fill one of the 4 flour tortillas served with his dish. Oh, and the tortillas were not homemade at all. We live in Milwaukie and eat at Mi Pueblo often - they make the most delicious corn tortillas. The ones served with my pollo were from a grocery store and not very warm or soft. The rice was decent as were the beans but everything felt like it sat in the oven or a microwave because the plate was screaming hot...even by the time we finished the meal and they cleared the table. The salsa they served with a hefty bowl of chips was very good - nice heat to it - sadly that was the best part of the meal. I guess I wouldn't be so critical if they only charged $10 for the plates, but each one was $14.95 - overpriced for the quality/quantity. We will never eat here again.

Luckily, the Back Bay location was just a few minutes walk from our hotel so it was extremely convenient. \\n\\nIt's very easy to find off of a major street and just around the corner from the Boston Public Library and Marathon Finish Line. \\n\\nThe decor is modern industrial with a few touches of fishing memorabilia. The place is a little small with only a few tables and counter seating but people eat pretty quickly so the turnover is not bad. We luckily got a table while waiting for our food so everything worked out well. \\n\\nThe menu is pretty straight forward. Of course we ordered the lobster roll and it was amazing! The roll is served on a hot dog bun but is loaded with lobster. For $17, it's pretty fairly priced. It is lobster after all. \\n\\nThe lobster is also barely dressed, which is how it should be. Some places drench the lobster in a heavy dressing to hide the lack of meat. Here, the lobster is the star!\\n\\nFor $4 more, I got a side salad and a drink.

They are made with a fish sauce, not fishy but really jam packed with mouth watering flavor and the Brussels sprouts were made perfectly with a little extra crisp to it. Lastly we ordered the north west Migas which is this Tex mex concoction of tortilla chips at the bottom, egg scramble on top and layered with grilled peppers, corn, and salsa.

These dishes aren't really family size if you are planning to order with a group of 4 or more.. maybe 4 you would be fine have a little of each dish.

The portions are weird. A kid's pizza is half the price but almost as big as the full size that costs $17. The rest of the toppings seemed slapped together. We ordered the Salami with the mama's little peppers and olives. I counted 5 olives on the entire pizza, most of which were on one slice. We ordered our daughter the kid's pizza and had them put salami on it. They charged us an extra $3 to add a grand total of 6 slices of salami to her pizza.

We had gone there every so often when all of us still lived in Boston (c. 3 years ago).  When we arrived this time, we were notified the kitchen was closed, and they were missing a few ingredients to make a few of their signature drinks.  All in all we still had a great time, but we were so surprised that we were really the only patrons there on a Friday evening (granted, it was a bit early for drinks).  It seemed like the kitchen wasn't just closed at the time we were there, but semi-permanently closed.  Does anyone know why?  Their sliders were so good, and I had just gotten in after a long drive from NY so I was looking forward to the food.  Such a bummer. Our server was very nice, but she walked over with our drinks with this look on her face like she had recently dropped too many of them and would be immediately fired if another one spilled.  It was amusing, but still, maybe she should work on not showing that fear!\\nOverall it was a weird vibe because it's such a lovely, open space and it was just so dead.

Typically, yeast doughnuts are graded by their light and airy nature (thus the reason for using the yeast as it grows expelling gas and then is captured in the gluten structure of the dough causing it to rise and stretch giving a fermented flavor, technically speaking).  However, these are not light or fluffy.  If you are expecting that--forget about it.  As heavy and chewy as they are though, they are curiously tasty.  That may be the Artisan draw to them.  The trendy glazes like salted and caramel bacon, orange pistachio and peppermint are very good.  The cake doughnuts which are quite similar to their yeast counterparts in texture are available too.  If you do drop by, the most fantastic thing I found on the menu was an outstanding Rose Cardamom Chai.  Rich & frothy, this delight is worth returning for often.  The prices are reasonable, sometimes they offer two for one specials and overall everyone should try this place for themselves and form their own opinion.

The outside looks kind of like a dry cleaner, but once you step inside, the interior is all warm and inviting with lots of paraphernelia dotted throughout the place. \\n\\nAfter a stretch of less-than-impressive restaurants, I figured why not give this diner-esque place a try?\\n\\nLocated within 2 miles of Dedham's Legacy Place shopping center, it's well worth avoiding the craziness of eating at Legacy Place, and the variety of foods offered is well worth driving the extra distance. \\n\\nThe place is clean and bright, the service is efficient, and the food is solid. \\n\\nThere are only about 6 tables, so if you go when it's busy, plan on taking food out unless you happen to be lucky. \\n\\nOne piece of advice I'd give is to go with two or three friends. The reason why this works out great is because if each person orders something, then splitting any dish into thirds or quarters provides the perfect amount of food to really taste and appreciate the food without getting numb to it. \\n\\nCase in point are the chicken tenders (called \\"Chicken Littles\\" here). They were battered and fried to perfection, and I'm pretty sure I've never said that about any fried food that I've reviewed on Yelp. They serve about 8 pieces per order, and 2 was the amount that I and my friends derived max satisfaction from. By the time I hit the third one, I realized that I should stop. \\n\\nWe ordered the Corn Puppies (hush puppies), and I can't say I was as big a fan of those because they were a bit more doughy than I'm used to. \\n\\nThe fries were fantastic, and I would get them every time. \\n\\nAs for sandwiches, we ordered a couple. The first was the Linkage which is a pork sausage with peppers and onions or mustard and sauerkraut. I chose the latter, and I regretted it as soon as I started eating. This wasn't the fault of the restaurant. I kind of thought it was going to be grilled sausage but it ended up being boiled, even though there was no indication that they were going to grill it. \\n\\nThe other sandwich was a chicken breast sandwich which was fantastic. The bread for both sandwiches was this great ciabatta, so kudos there. \\n\\nThe last item was actually the one that the person at the counter highly recommended: the Chinese egg rolls. I ordered them not because I had particularly high hopes that a place that had a 100% American menu was going to knock it out of the park with an appetizer that I've heard doesn't even really exist in China (note: it's kind of like the corn beef and cabbage Irish myth). I ordered them because it was the day before Easter, and who doesn't like a good Easter egg roll (on the White House lawn or elsewhere). \\n\\nIt was easily the worst item we tried. Honestly, if I hadn't tried it, I would have given the place 5 stars. The wrapper was a bit too chewy, and the ingredients inside were to the point of being over-considered. Their size was impressive because they looked like mini Chipotle burritos (fyi, high praise). But the taste and consistency just weren't there.\\n\\nSo, overall the place is a bit more than 4 stars, and I'll head back later for a second round because this is the sort of place where you want to try a bunch of stuff on the menu.

They didn't ask what level of seasoning I wanted, so I think I must have had mild.   I could have handled more spice, but that's my bad, so I'll ask next time.  But the CTM was legit.  Flavorful, I must have sopped up every drop of the sauce in my bowl.  And the naan, so large and so good.  Seriously, puts a lot of naan in this town to shame.  I would rather pay a couple bucks for fresh naan than get free naan that is soggy and lackluster.  Yes, Clay Pit lunch buffet, I'm looking at you.  Also got a Masala Chai because I wanted something warm, but it was unlike the chai I'm used to and I didn't much care for it.  Too cloudy, not spicy enough.  But the food here is what you come for.

I invited about a dozen friends for my birthday dinner here, and the fun atmosphere made for a really great time.  Upon arriving, guests are asked to remove their shoes and are seated on comfy pillows and cushions piled on the gorgeous Persian rugs.  Between eating and chatting amongst ourselves, the bellydancers provide some fun entertainment.  The food, however, doesn't seem to be worth how much you pay for it ($45-$65 per person); I guess I'm not an expert on Moroccan food, but I didn't enjoy a lot of the flavors in the meat dishes - they were a little too sweet - and I found the vegetable dishes, on the other hand, a little bland.  The drinks are delish, but super expensive (like $30-something per pitcher).  Definitely still try Imperial Fez for the experience, though - go with a big group on Friday/Saturday night and you're sure to have a good time.\\n\\nP.S.

But I could probably be a competitive eater, so it was awesome for me.\\n\\nThe Som Tom is a papaya salad, with peanuts, fresh green beans, peanuts, and more. It came with sticky rice. This was amazing. And I love spice and spicy foods, so this was perfect for me. If you're averse to spice, maybe ask them to tone it down, because it would be good either way.\\n\\nThe Larb Moo is this weird minced pork dish with fresh cucumbers and fresh herbs and such. So good, and again, rather spicy. It also has that Thai basil flavor, which has the essence of licorice. Amazing! So, so good. Again, sticky rice was included. I doubt many people order this, because it looks and sounds sort of unfamiliar, but as long as you aren't opposed to Thai basil or cilantro, you will not be disappointed. It seemed like most people were ordering Pad Kapow instead. I'll probably try that the next go-around.\\n\\nThe line is relatively short to non-existent compared to La Barbecue, which is in the same food truck park. The wait on food is a bit longer than I would have liked (I was quoted 15 minutes and it took more like 25), because the lovely woman making the food seemed to take a lot of meticulous care preparing each dish individually. The food is totally worth the wait. It's immediately one of my favorite places in Austin. It really rocketed up to my top/elite food trailers and even restaurants overall.\\n\\nThe other knock on it might be that they were out of the pork skewers, which were still listed on their sandwich board menu outside. The proprietor seemed a little exasperated having to tell every person that he had noted this on the website but hadn't updated the board. Basically everyone was ordering the skewers and then having to call an audible at the last moment. Some seemed pretty disappointed to the point of irritated.

For those who want the short version, basically we were there this past weekend (Friday 7:30pm) for magical dining with a party of 12.  Service was slow for our table which made us call over the manager.  He just made the situation even worse basically challenging any statement we made and had an overall condescending attitude.  The service/manager left such a bad taste in our mouths we tried to pay and leave even before our main entrees got there.  In the end, we ate our food, paid, left the restaurant and vow to never ever return to the place.\\n \\nMy fianc√© and I arrived first and decided to wait at the bar until more people arrived. We had ordered a drink and got maybe half way through our drinks and 5 more people arrived shortly (4 adults, 1 baby).  I go to ask if we can sit at our table now and they gladly seat us.  Maybe within 10 more mins everyone has now arrived.  We had two waiters, the first started to pour water for us and just didn't give a friendly vibe off.  Nothing happened, it's just when you try to be friendly with your waiter and get nothing in return kind of sets of a flag.  (the 2nd waiter was great though)  We order drinks and my only complaint here really wasn't the service but the drinks were so watered down.  While we are drinking, I notice another large party sit directly behind us mostly kids looks like a birthday party, we'll come back to this.  Everything good so far, just some watery drinks, we place our entire order.\\n \\nAppetizers (oysters) comes out first.  Decent service time, ordered more drinks, nothing to complain.  The drinks got finished and the ice in those cups became water.  We see our waiters being way more attentive to the other tables around us.  I look over to the large party behind us and the kids are eating their food already.  I'm a little mad now we don't have food or even anyone checking on us.  A few of us decide to leave to go to another restaurant/bar next door to get better drinks since it seems we'll be waiting forever for our entrees.  Basically took us about 20-25 mins to get our drinks and drink them at this other place.  While this is happening, my fianc√© who is now even more upset we still don't have food, asks for the manager.  The group that got drinks comes back to see still no entrees.  At this point we decided we just want to leave, we'll pay for what we ate/drank and just leave.  Manager comes and says \\"what can I do for you?\\" we say we just want to pay and leave, he responds with your food is right here right now and the restaurant is busy, never really gives a decent apology. \\n \\nWhile they are clearing out our apps I ask the manager how come the table behind us got food first.  His first response is \\"I think they sat down first\\", which I respond \\"no I'm positive I saw them sit down\\" (hard to miss a bunch of kids sit down).  His next response, \\"Well you were at the bar\\", I respond, \\"Yes I was at the bar but we sat here before them\\"  His next response and my favorite, \\"Well they have more kids, but let me go check\\"  WHAT?!?!?! So you're telling me the more kids I bring the better and faster service I get and you're checking to see if I'm wrong??  Pretty sure \\"Customer is always right\\" is the golden motto in the service industry regardless of how bad of a customer you had.  Pretty sure you don't challenge their statements.\\n \\nHe comes back and says ok that table is still waiting on their food and it was just the kids who ate since they ordered from kids menu.  Fine I take full responsibility for my mistake in assuming they ate before us but I tell him that should of not been his first response to me.  I try to tell him how it sounds when someone replies \\"they have more kids\\" as a reason a table may have their food first.  After some heated exchange he drops another bomb, \\"You guys are just trying to get free stuff\\"  (Now back up 5 mins...while they were clearing apps, my fianc√© had asked if we could get comped for drinks for the trouble, to which he said it could not be done in a polite manner and we said fine)  So now this guy accuses me of this, like it was my master plan.  Now I'm heated which in retrospect I should probably have not been as voices may have been elevated, but in summary I said that is the last thing I care about and all you had to do was take ownership of the situation but instead you chose to make excuses.  He walks away and that last we see of him.\\n \\nWe ate our food which I have nothing negative to say other than 1 steak was overcooked which they rectified and someone didn't get their dessert which I'm sure they also would've rectified but we just wanted to get out of there.  We paid/tipped and left.  In summary, food 9/10, drinks 3/10, service, -50/10.   Never imagine a place of this caliber have such awful service all the way up the line.

The ribs were 100 times better than the last place I went in Texas (very tender), and while the coleslaw was pretty small it had good flavor. At first I was dissapointed that they put the ribs on top of most of the fries, but as I ate through the ribs I uncovered fries with a nice lite  coating of BBQ sauce. I couldn't eat everything (except the slaw - they could give a bit more of that).\\n\\nInside looked nice and there were a fair amount of people at 5:15 on a Friday evening.

No.  Because, when you go to Cuatros, you don't go there for the food, unless you like fries that taste like they were bought at Sams or burgers that are good but forgettable.  You come to Cuatros to grab a cheap beer with friends and catch the game on the huge flat-screen TVs on the patio.\\n\\nThe service is really fast.  My friend and I were given attention the moment we sat down.  Our beers came out soon after that, with our food being delivered shortly thereafter.  Our waitress checked up on us frequently despite the place being packed with everyone watching the baseball game that was on.\\n\\nSometimes your team loses.  But other times your team wins.  And its those times when you want to be at Cuatros, so when you hear that fan of the losing team cry at the table beside you, you can sip your beer and have it taste that much better."},{"name":"Thai Pasta Cuisine","address":"11461 SW Scholls Ferry Rd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"Extremely tasty Thai food, wish I had found this place sooner.

The server announced that it would  take a little longer because each batch is made upon order to ensure that the ingredients don't become overcooked.  Good! Well that didn't work! What I got was  rubberized squid remnants submerged in a watery, flavorless stock. There was a dollop of overcooked crab meat that rose in the center of the bowl like an unsightly iceberg.

Considering the fact that it was utterly freezing out and people were willing to shiver for a LONG time, I thought I'd give this place a try.  The result?  Well, if it's freezing out, and you have to stand in line outside?  It's worth it.\\n\\nI'd say the seating is minimal but it's not, it's just that Pine State is too popular; so you're going to have to wait.  Or really, you're going to have to go up, order your food, and be ready to pounce on any open seat.\\n\\nWe opted to try two sandwiches, The Reggie (Fried chicken, bacon, cheese & gravy) and The McIsley (Fried chicken, pickles, mustard, and honey).  These things are absolutely stellar; The Reggie has perfectly fried chicken, succulent and juicy, with the protein heavy toppings that will leave you sated and warm on a cold day.  I don't know if I was starving or cold, but it didn't feel too heavy.  The McIsley almost felt like the opposite kind of sandwich, as much as too almost identical sandwiches can be opposites.  The sweetness of the honey gave the meal a kind of lightness, and the flavor combination of honey, pickles, and mustard will keep you interested; the pickle works perfectly to add a certain crunchy texture that it would otherwise be lacking.  I normally hate pickles in my sandwiches but it just works perfectly here."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This was such a fun treat on a cold winter day!

But if you're the type to enjoy Southern BBQ done right, you're not going to mind. \\n\\nThe ribs are all well-done, tender, and flavourful. You're going to get them piled atop beans and coleslaw, but you can substitute another side if you wish. You'll get free cornbread at the beginning of your meal, alongside beverages served in ginormous Mason jars. And if you're up for sweeeeeet, you'll order the Sweet Tea (oh, god, yum). \\n\\nThe chili is a bit on the thin side, but still excellent, with giant cubes of meat. Fried okra is crispy, not greasy.

This was my first time coming to this bar/resto, but I am pretty impressed. I got the fizz as a drink and it was bomb-tastic, perfect for the hot weather. The dinner was for father's day so the 6 of us got a bunch of small plates plus 2 entrees. We got the pork belly, the pate, clams, lamb chops, crispy chicken wings, grilled octopus. For entrees, we got the steak and gnocchi.  I'd say the highlight was the octopus, clams and lamb chops. Everything was as expected and tasted great! I think we didn't really care for the pate though, we're used to it being in Vietnamese banh mi, but I think the pate needed a bit of flavoring to cut the...game-iness? My sis got springtime in Kyoto for a drink and I thought it tasted like medicine? She drank the whole thing though. My dad got the lions tail, very strong and good for a whisky lover like him. I'm biased tho and I loved my fizz.

It's really no kind of coherent dish; I ended up eating them separately because they tasted better that way.\\n\\nI felt like I needed to give them a second chance, so I got a dessert biscuit, which was also unimpressive.

It was delicious.  The flavors were bold, unique, and unlike the usual Indian food that we get.  The only other time I have had Indian food like this was at Bread Bar at Tabla in NYC, which we also loved.  One quick note, the online menu is really out of date.  When I called in our order, half of the items that I tried getting aren't on the menu any more.  But, whatever, they had great substitutions.\\n\\nFirst up, roasted pumpkin samosas.  I just about died when I saw this on the menu because pumpkin anything is awesome in my book.  They didn't disappoint, they were delicious!  Plus, they went perfectly with the pear chutney that I got.  The pear chutney tasted like a warm pear pie, so good.  I loved both of them.\\n\\nThe Dal Vadai was OK, it was a bit dry but when you added some chutney to it I was good.  It reminded me a lot of falafel, which is a good thing!  I wish it had a bit more spices in it, that would have made it more enjoyable.\\n\\nThe cheese naan was also good, so fresh.  I had a couple bites that were a bit salty but overall it was delicious.  It was funny, I hesitated ordering it because the reviews had mentioned that the naans were salty but I am glad I ordered it.  It was quite fresh and super soft.  Good stuff! \\n\\n\\nMy husband loved the pork vindalho.  He normally stays away from pork, he finds it too fatty.  They spiced it up for him which he loved.  There was some fatty pieces of meat in there but overall he really loved in.  In fact, he kept mentioning to me that he really loved it, which he normally doesn't do.  My husband is actually the one who declared it five stars, I probably would have gone with a solid 4-4.5.   But, five it is!  \\n\\nThe flavors were seriously fantastic.  Slightly pricey but worth it!"},{"name":"Le Coq Au Vin","address":"4800 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I was very excited to experience this restaurant -- I came here with my fiance for a romantic dinner. The decor is rustic -- lots of stuff on the walls, seems reminiscent of the old \\"Public Houses\\" of Europe, but with white tablecloths and wine glasses on each table. Seems like it started out country but then changed its mind and became fancy.\\n\\nThat, however, was where the fancy stopped; this was mostly to do with service. Our server, Joseph (a young man in his late 20's), seemed to know about as much about the menu as we did -- right from the initial greet he was stuttering and soft spoken. He went into the hors d'oeuvres specials, seeming as though he was asking us about them (\\"It's a lobster macaroni and cheese? Served in a carafe? Big enough to share?\\") My fiance asked for a beer recommendation for the steak; he seemed as if he had never been asked that question before, and stammered that he would go and ask the chef. I requested a wine recommendation as well, and he once again stammered (questioningly) a wine which was delicious if only he had recommended it with confidence. I felt nervous about ordering it because HE was nervous about me ordering it. \\nAbout halfway through our hors d'oeuvres, the server finally asked if we wanted our wine and beer right now, or with the meal. This was around 30-35 minutes after being sat. Halfway through our hors d'oeuvres, and around 15 minutes after we had given our entree order to the server, he came up and rather tactlessly informed us about the entree specials AFTER WE HAD ALREADY ORDERED. Kind of like an \\"oh....and if you wanted to order this....sorry...\\"\\n\\nTo start, we ordered the escargot and the onion soup. The escargot was simply seasoned, but the sauce was great -- similar to another reviewer, I too dipped the bread in the sauce because I really enjoyed it. The onion soup was AMAZING: I actually tipped it to get the last of the soup out because I didn't want to waste any. I ordered a glass of the German Selbach Reisling, which was delicious and went with everything I ordered; my fiance ordered the Durkel, a dark German beer that he raved went perfectly with his New York Strip steak. \\n\\nFor our entrees, as mentioned before me fiance ordered the New York Strip steak medium rare -- he was obsessed with the au gratin potatoes, and we both agreed that the carrots were cooked wonderfully. The steak left a bit to be desired -- then again, obviously this isn't a steak place, but the cut of strip did not seem to be the best, with a lot of fat and a bit tough. We both wished that the pepper sauce had a bit more kick to it, but it was very good as well! Another suggestion for the service -- when the steak arrived, Joseph then stated, \\"let me go get you a steak knife.\\" Three minutes later, he arrived with it. Since this restaurant brags a fine-dining feel, having to stare at a delicious-looking, hot steak for three minutes not being able to cut into it seems a bit amateur. I won't eat until he can, so why not have the steak knife as a pre-drop, so both of us aren't watching our hot food become cold while you get him the proper utensil to eat it with? I ordered the coq au vin, and it was GREAT -- one of my favorite dishes to order, and the reason why I came here. My chicken was cooked perfectly, the sauce and mushrooms were great, it was the highlight of my evening. The coq au vin and the food are the reason for the two stars that I did give\\n\\nWe did decide to order an additional side of the truffle fries, just to see what they tasted like and they did not come out with the meals. I reminded the server about them, at his first (credit given: diligent) check-back: he informed me he would get them immediately. 20 minutes later, he checked back with us twice and informed us they were coming -- 25 minutes later, we were finished and asked for them to be cancelled. \\n\\nI ordered the creme brulee for dessert. I also ordered a cup of coffee. The coffee was delivered, and it was then that the server asked if I would like cream and sugar. I replied with the affirmative. My creme brulee arrived (with only one spoon for a couple....thank goodness my fiance didn't want any), and I reminded the server about my cream and sugar -- once again an item getting cold and untouched because of the server's inability to plan ahead for his Guests.\\n\\nThe flaws in service were ignored at the time because I will not let a bad server destroy my romantic evening. I definitely think that Joseph should be put through some additional training (wine/beer knowledge, food knowledge, and maybe a serving class) and next time in order to receive a better, classier experience I may request one of the older more experienced servers. The steak was nothing to write home about, but everything else was great and I would definitely eat here again if not to try more items on the menu. Especially my truffle fries, which I was looking forward to trying but then never received."},{"name":"The Mighty Bowl","address":"108 W 8th St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"AH-MAY-ZING!  \\n\\nI was headed back home and much to my happy surprise I spotted the Mighty Bowl!

Trust me, that's the highest form of praise that I think can be given to a BBQ joint located in the middle of New England,LOL. I was in Boston recently, and being the BBQ addict that I am, I had researched where the best places were and Redbones is the one that I decided to give a shot. Redbones BBQ is located near Tuft's University if I recall correctly, I could be wrong there but I seem to remember seeing a lot of signs when we were going to the restaurant. They are located fairly close to a train station and the walk wasn't too bad, the whole neighborhood had a cool college-town, bohemian kind of feel to it that I really enjoyed.\\n\\nWhen we entered the restaurant, we were immediately greeted and shown a seat by the hostess and our server came over not too long after that. I have to give major props to our server; he was very friendly and attentive throughout our meal. I got the Memphis style ribs and the wife had the St. Louis style ribs (which I also got to sample) and they were both very good. The meat was falling off the bone and you could really tell the difference between the ribs. The St. Louis style tasted like that....it wasn't just a name and that goes for the Memphis dry rub style that I had as well. Our order came out very quickly and we barely had time to finish the corn bread that they brought out for us.....that was really the biggest surprise of the night.....their corn bread was some of, if not the best, that I have ever had. It was really good. Our meal also came with beans and Cole Slaw which were also very good. I also have to add that we got good value for our money, food is expensive in Boston (in my opinion), and we both got a lot of ribs for the price. I don't know if each of us got a whole side of ribs, but it was close.\\n\\nThe only down side to me was the sauce. Their sauce, while not bad, was nothing to write home about. They have three types of sauce.... sweet, hot, and mild. I didn't have the courage to try the hot variety since the mild was already a little spicy in my opinion. It reminded me of Fatt Matt's sauce with a little less kick and more of a \\"ketchup-y\\" taste to it.\\n\\nI would recommend this place to anyone if they are in Boston....excellent service here and fast.

I also had an interesting lemon bay (laurel) soda which was floral, refreshing, and interesting--in a good way.\\n\\nMy recommendation for this restaurant goes to those who seek decent, light French fare without the fuss.

This restaurant is from the folks that also own the Publick House. They started out as the Roadhouse and initially I thought they were on to something. The food was good and it brought something different to the neighborhood. Then they went to the tex-mex/creole place because they had to remove the smoker. This was terrible. The food was bad and for some reason the service went downhill. So I was a little skeptical coming to American Craft. Overall it wasn't bad and its worth a shot. They obviously know beer that's not the problem. The food however, wasn't bad but wasn't perfect. I started with the onion soup which I thought was delicious. Since the burger seemed front and center on their menu. I went with the burger and fries. It was so-so. I did get a couple of toppings on it but there was very little cheese or carmelized onions which I ordered. The fries were just ok. It certainly does not compete with the burger and fries at the Washington Square Tavern down the street. As for the decor. We thought it felt cold and empty inside and we were there at 7:00 on a Friday night. I thought they were trying to get a Washington Square Tavern vibe going on but there is only one Tavern in this neighborhood. I think  the menu leaves something to be desired but they just opened and I think they need an opportunity to tweak it. Overall I think it has potential and I really hope they are able to make this work because the neighborhood needs it. One other comment is that they need to do something with the outside decor the colors are terrible and the place always looks closed at night when they are open. I really hope they change the colors and make it fit in with the neighborhood better.

I'm normally the person loathing grilled meat, but they manage to keep it tender and moist here.

For a fact, the beef my date ordered was. \\nHowever; I literally think I had happy hour at least once a week for a year - when it first opened.

I'm also a sucker for their rice paper spring rolls and California rolls. \\nThe bar used to be a meat market - so not only was the happy hour food phenomenal for the price, but it was a great place to meet and mingle. Now, it's more like a place just to go for great food or to take out of town guests for the great food and beautiful view. \\nI don't know of anywhere else in the city you can dine for under $10 and get a view of most of downtown and the lower east side.

The biscuits were oven fresh and the gravy was probably the best I've ever had. I ordered the Reggie Deluxe which is a biscuit with friend chicken, gravy, cheese, bacon, and egg.

Luckily one of us left the office early and got there early to snag us the last booth in the place. You've got to get there early or I suppose come for lunch, if you want a seat by the windows to see the view! \\nWe all ordered a cocktail to start. I had a Pomegranate Martini, I've had better in my opinion. My second cocktail was better, I had the Black Rock- definitely a stronger drink. We looked at the price differences for the cocktails (from happy hour to the regular menu) and most of them seemed to be about a 50cent difference- what a steal! Joking. But there were some \\"deals\\" with the beers and wines. There were five of us women and my boss said to order a bunch of different plates. Not being into much seafood person myself, I wasn't super excited by all of it's options, but if you like you're fish and your rolls- this is a great place for you. I'd say they need something else on the menu for the vegetarians- we're in Portland, why wouldn't you? One of our coworkers is a vegetarian and she ended up just getting fries and the caesar salad, which aren't the best options. They did have veggie spring rolls with a peanut sauce, but they had cilantro in it and she's not a fan- her loss! Those were one of my favorite things of the night.\\nNot sure if they rotate the menu and change it up often or not. \\nI ordered the Spicy Pork Rice bowl, that was delicious, pretty salty though. It had a little kick to it, but nothing crazy. It came with a scoop of rice and a jicama, carrot slaw on the side. The rice was good and it had a sauce poured all over it, seemed like something mayonnaise based- aka delicious. I started to notice a trend though, all of the plates that we ordered had sauce on them. I am a sauce lover. Everything deserves a sauce. But this was a salt overload on the food. The fries were COVERED (caps lock necessary) in salt. The salad was wet with dressing. This place is great, but it's the location and the ambiance that they have going for it. The food needs some work. Which I've had other people tell me as well \\"Amazing restaurant, but the food is just okay\\". I mean I suppose people will keep coming back- the place was packed in the late afternoon, on a week night. But someone please elevate the food a bit! This place would be phenomenal. \\nService was alright, I think we had 4 people in total helping us. Our main server was nice and the food all came out very quickly, which was unexpected seeing how busy it was. As our waiter said from the beginning the plates will come out randomly and not altogether, which was totally fine. We ordered so much we wouldn't of had room on our table all at once! Overall presentation of the food was nice as well. \\nIt is definitely a bar scene though, maybe things slow down after the happy hour. It was a loud spot, I couldn't hear the person on the other side of the booth unless leaning over \\"huh?\\" they shout it over, oh yeah okay!\\nI'm looking forward to coming back and trying to get a seat with the view- it's beautiful!!

It's nothing like Fogo or anything, so you can't expect phenomenal cuts of meat on a stick, large & elegant dining rooms, extensive wine lists (or any, for that matter), or cute guys in funky pants.  No, this place is the antithesis of all of that.  But you CAN expect to get a great home-style, all you can eat feast for a super price!  \\n\\nThe buffet, itself, is small.  There's usually a choice of at least 2 or 3 various kinds of meats, cooked veggies, starches, as well as a simple salad bar.  Try the tropical fruit salad!  Heaven!   Depending on the day/night, they may have a soup or stew.  On a good night, they'll have yucca and or fried plantains.  On a great night, they'll have cheese rolls! *drool*  On the best night of all, they'll have chayote!  Once, they had spaghetti (huh?)...But the rice and beans is where it's at!  Amazingly simple, and simply amazing!  I CRAVE their rice and beans at least once a week, on a regular basis.\\n\\nAs Addy C. mentioned, the meat can be really tough.  Know what makes it incredibly delicious?  The hot, malagueta pepper sauce that's on every table.  Yes, I would love to just eat a whole bottle of those delightful little guys!  They're INCREDIBLY HOT, though, so be careful!  One little pepper is enough to spice at least half of your plate!  I'm serious!\\n\\nSo if you're brave and go for the bottle of peppers, you're gonna need something to drink!  I suggest their freshly squeezed orange juice!  It's about $3 and very much worth it! They'll add sugar and ice if you want, but I find that it's great right out of the juicer!  Of course, you could be boring and opt for a canned drink or something, but I say it's best to \\"eat outside of the box\\" and try something adventurous!  Speaking of, they also offer Brazilian mango and cashew drinks...although, I have to say, I wasn't a fan of the cashew.  Live and learn.  \\n\\nAnd the moral of the story is:  If you're around Delk Rd during lunch or dinner time, stop by and check it out for yourself!  Don't want to sit there and gorge yourself on the buffet?  They offer to-go containers and sell the food by the pound!  So now you have no excuses not to try it...Sabor DO Brazil is just too delicious to pass up!\\n\\nFor real, if I could eat the rice and beans everyday...I just might!   *poot*"},{"name":"Asian House","address":"407 Cheney Hwy","city":"Titusville","stars":"4","text":"Asian House is definitely the best Asian/Japanese restaurant in Titusville.

It was Tuesday evening and I had a mission for some Wagyu skirt steak. 26 bucks? Sure, why not. We'd walked past a few times on our way to the food carts and the place looked nice, and had a cozy outdoor dining area. When we got there for dinner, I realized 26 bucks was not enough for a seat here. My wife and I came from out of town, wearing target/walmart clothes. Looking around, we were probably out of place and realized we didn't have enough to buy the brand of casual wardrobe that granted us access to a meal here. That point was driven home when I talked to the hostess. \\n\\n We had enough for a meal, but I felt like we weren't the hip clientele they wanted eating at their establishment. We were basically given the run around by the hostess. An hour and thirty minutes for a wait. I said sure to the hostess. She told me she had other things to do, other people to seat, other calls to make before she could even write my name down in the reservation book. Literally, she around for 10 minutes before I could even make eye contact with her again.  Funny how the lady who came in 10 minutes after me had the clout to get her name in the book with a few whispers, even though she came off the street just like us. We had the money for a meal, we had the time to kill, but we decided we didn't want to eat where we weren't wanted. \\n\\nFood is probably ok, but over hyped anyway.

First off...I'm between 1 and 2 stars and only because the weather is nice out and I'm in a good mood (regardless of my poor experience)...that they are getting 2 stars from me. Also our server was nice.\\n\\nSo the bf and I have been wanting to visit Beignet Connection for a while and today we decided to give them a try for brunch. We walked into an almost empty restaurant (3 tables were full) and after a few minutes...a man who was eating lunch at the bar said we would be helped soon. We could only assume he is the owner/manager. A few more minutes pass and still waiting for a table...so the same guy (still eating at the bar) seated us. \\n\\nLong story short...within 5 minutes we ordered and about 35 minutes after that we were served. Another table who was seated after us actually received their food first. Keep in mind...we ordered a cold sandwich and their standard breakfast plate (pancakes, eggs and bacon). This order should have never taken that long to make. Below I mentioned a few of the major \\"fails\\" we experienced.    \\n \\n* Side salad - lettuce with 2 thin slices of red onion (was supposed to have avocado on it, which I mentioned to the waiter, but after 5 minutes or so...he said they were out) - fail\\n* Finding a hair in my side salad - fail\\n* First ordered chicken salad sandwich because the menu stated it was chicken, shallots and pecans...yet was full of grapes, which I'm allergic too. Another fail.\\n* Then ordered shrimp po boy...bread was way too thick and dry (italian loaf), but the shrimp (besides the heavy breading) was ok. \\n* We ordered a beignet and it was underdone. You could tell this by just looking at it and obviously by tasting, as well. Umm...biggest fail since this should be the best item on their menu.\\n* The fact that after all of this bad stuff...the manager never came to our table once. The man who seated us (again who we think the manager was) ate at the bar the entire time we were there.  \\n\\nNote - they are also closed on Mondays. \\n\\nOnly bonus - free parking in the garage next door.\\n\\nLast thing I want to mention is how the inside of the restaurant looked. If their intention was to feel like we were in New Orleans...add this to my \\"fail\\" list. Their decorations consisted of 8 mardi gras masks hanging on the wall. I suggest they add some more color and flair.  \\n\\nOverall...I'm not a fan of giving bad reviews, but the only way to improve is to learn from your mistakes.

Usually eight or nine of us will just head downstairs, and usually receive seating pretty quickly. The downstairs area is filled with all sorts of zany paintings, nostalgic music (Eels and Beck, for instance), and a rotating tap of fairly unique beers, which go for $7.50 or so. The staff is laid-back, and the service is quick. Food comes quickly, but not too quickly, and the drinks flow freely. Admittedly, I've never really spent any lengthy period of time at the bar upstairs, but it seems like a good place to catch the game with a brewski.\\n\\nIt's just tough to not enjoy yourself at Redbones. The staff seem genuinely happy to be working there, the beers are good and interesting, the prices are reasonable, and the walls are covered with aliens.

I eat at the soup peddler almost every day for lunch since I live in the neighborhood. I usually get the soup because I am lactose intolerant but decided I wanted to try something new on the menu. I politely asked if I could get a sandwich with no cheese on it. (since there are no dairy free options). Both employees seemed annoyed and told me no because they are pre-made. I asked if I could personally hand pick the cheese off before they grilled it so its not melted and would be easier for me to take off.  The dark haired girl with thick eye liner rolls her eyes and asks the other girl working if this is allowed. Her friend respond in a snarky way and says \\"we don't want to waste food\\". \\n\\nThis was so incredibly rude and I feel talked down to and discriminated against for being allergic to cheese. Even if there was no possible way they could have allowed it, they should have been kind and polite and I would have understood. To not waste food?! that is a dumb excuse especially because I can do whatever I want with something that I paid for. FYI Jo's takes the cheese off of their pre made sanwhiches for me and its not a big ordeal like it is here.

The combination just doesn't work. The bread practically disappears as you try to hold the sauce slathered meat inside. So, as I ate my sandwich, the entire thing fell apart as predicted.

However, that is in part due to my own culture. Family style here doesn't include 10 vastly different dishes ranging from fish to vegetables to meat to be shared by a party of 6, nope.\\n\\nFamily style here simply means that food comes in the order that it's ready in - each dish to be savored in the moment that it's brought out. It easily feels like a multiple course meal with friends as you dig into each hot plate that arrives straight out of the kitchen.\\n\\nI've only ever been here for brunch and the food is amazing. Everything on the plate works well together. Flavors are easily balanced in all the right spots with an array of sweet & savory to choose from. Furthermore, they have \\"smaller\\" and \\"bigger\\" plates for when you're feeling a little bit of everything. I do have to say that if you're there for your first meal of the day, the strong flavors might hit you in the face and punch you in the mouth. While that's all dandy with me, some might not quite like it as much. Some foods are also a little heavier than others, so definitely make sure you know what you're getting into! \\n\\nPersonal favorites: \\nPolenta n Sugo - Braised pork and cheese covered with an over easy egg on top of a bed of polenta...what more could you ask for?\\n\\nPork Schnitzel - It seems that it's a different variety of pork (as seen by pictures of other pork schnitzels that didn't match what I got) depending on the kitchen. I had two decks of fried pork cutlet with ham and cheese sandwiched in between. On the side was a flavorful mustard braised cabbage that was absolutely delightful. Oh, and a runny egg on top. Can it get any better than this? I personally feel that it would've gone great with a side of toast or biscuit.\\n\\nPersonal (not so) favorites: Korean Chicken bowl - just wasn't the right taste for me and the rice was undercooked. \\n\\nQuick tip - it does get crowded on weekend mornings, so be there early!

Downhome Southern cooking--biscuits and gravy and sweet tea like my grandmother made growing up in Atlanta.

For those of you who don't know, it's a expertly breaded and fried chicken breast served on a perfect biscuit with grainy brown mustard, drowned in delicious honey. It's amazing. Their Reggie sandwhich--chicken, bacon, and sausage gravy biscuit sandwhich--is out of this world. And did I mention the Sweat Tea is Church pot-luck *perfect*?\\n\\nNow, tables are first-come, first-grabbed, so take that into consideration if you plan to arrive after, say, 930a on a weekend morning--you may have to sit outside, eat at the bar, or eat standing up. That said, the tabled-folks are really cool about eating and moving on fairly quickly, so in my experience a table usually opens up right about when my food comes off the line. Regardless, so far as I'm concerned, the food makes less-than-ideal table conditions, if you have to weather them, totally worthwhile. Granted, that's a summer/fall assessment; in the rainy season, I might not be so happy to eat standing up/sitting outside.\\n\\nEntrees run $5-9, drinks run $2-5, extras run $3-5.

As well as a line when I selected a table by the window and started to eat. I guess this location is busy, being by Florida hospital. But to only have one cashier working and having to wait several minutes because the cashier needs change and has to wait for a manager to bring change. Then when I am ordering a medium combo, the cashier enters small combo, then calls a manager over to show him how to enter an order for a medium combo.\\nAnd when you have customers holding up the line for what should be a simple order, that only makes matters worse.\\nAnother employee helped with placing orders at the counter. But it seemed like all of the employees were focusing on the drive thru window. \\nYeah, I know there is three or four cars at the drive thru, but there is also a line of customers at the counter.\\nMy food was served hot, and the cashier did apologize for any wait.

Wait was about 20 minutes. Not too bad, but there's no good waiting area. There's a tiny area that can fit maybe 6 people, but with how popular this place gets, that's nothing.\\n\\nBetween the four of us, we got the juggernaut, superchef omelet, superchef breakfast platter, and the wings+waffles. I haven't really had chicken and waffles too many times, so it's hard for me to compare this place to other establishments. Individually, the chicken was great, the waffles were great. I'm just not so sure about them together - mixing the sweet and the savory like that. But that's not a story for here. The omelet, breakfast platter, and wings+waffles were all great as well. The wings were very crispy and greatly flavored. Similar in style and taste and Vietnamese styled fried chicken marinated in fish sauce (yes, I know, really specific but someone out there has to understand what I'm talking about). My favorite, favorite, favorite part of the meal were the hash browns. We had heard beforehand they were great...and they sure didn't disappoint. So crispy, so flavorful. Honestly, probably the best hashbrowns I've had. If your order doesn't come with any, I'd highly suggest you get a side of it.\\n\\nTwo of us also got the homemade blueberry coffee. And I literally mean homemade. There's a large thermos/canister out in the front that holds coffee that apparently one of the ladies makes at home and brings in. So unfortunately the blueberry coffee is probably a revolving product. If you get a chance and like coffee, I'd suggest giving it a try. Great blueberry smell and the coffee flavor itself was still there. Not an overpowering fruity smell either.\\n\\nService-wise....not bad either. I've read some other comments saying they could use improvement there. I could understand why - we came early Sunday morning and it seemed like they were pretty busy. Kitchen was almost short staffed it seemed. Took us probably about 20 minutes from the time we ordered to when we got our food (I typically expect quick times for breakfast food). They were fairly attentive with refilling our drinks as well. \\n\\nAll in all, a solid 4 stars. Not quite to the level of OMG BLOW MY MIND 5 STARS, BEST RESTAURANT EVER. I'd definitely come back though to try some other items. (Like the pancakes! Someone got the pancake sampler platter of 6 different ones...looked delicious).

I arranged for call ahead seating on my phone app and when we arrived were shown to our table immediately.  Our Waiter, Tyler, was quick to arrive and take our drink orders.  My wine showed up quickly as did the other drinks.   He was pleasant, professional, efficient, yet friendly.  My daughter ordered a guac/bacon burger and my friend ordered one of the chicken sandwiches.  Since I'm an ahi tuna fanatic, I ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad.  All food arrived at an appropriate time and appeared nice.  My guests enjoyed their meals a lot and, while the actual salad itself was acceptable, the Ahi Tuna on it didn't taste normal.  It didn't taste spoiled, but just wasn't right.  I've had this salad here before and it was very good in the past.  When Tyler checked on us I let him know something wasn't right with the Tuna.  He immediately asked if I wanted something else and I said no at that point.  He said he would let his Manager know.  The manager arrived and inquired what was wrong and I let him know the situation.  He looked at my salad and said 'well the tuna looks pink which means it's fresh' at which time I agreed, but said it still didn't taste normal and  I wanted them to be aware so no one else could get sick if it were problematic.  He said he would go to the kitchen and try it, asked if I wanted something else, I said no, and then took the salad away.  That was the last I saw of the Manager.  When Tyler brought the bill he looked at it and inquired \\"did the Manager mention he was taking it off the bill\\" and I responded that he did not and that we never saw him again.  He immediately responded that he would go talk to the Manager since he feels it would be inappropriate for me to pay for something that was concerning.  He returned in a bit stating that he had to talk to two different managers, but did get the salad removed.  Obviously Tyler went out of his way to do the right thing when the Manager apparently didn't find my satisfaction or feedback important.    \\n\\nI will return to BJs eventually to give them an opportunity for redemption, but only because of Tyler's professionalism and customer service.

It took asking two different waiters at least twice for most everything.  And the complimentary bread only came two pieces at a time. If I'm paying a week's worth of groceries for your wine tasting and food, I think you can handle a mini-loaf.\\n\\nIt seemed to get even more bizarre when everyone else at the restaurant seemed to be enjoying the small food portions and wine, while my friend and I were looking over our glasses not tasting anything to write home about.  \\n\\nMeanwhile, appetizers with only two crab cakes went to the table next to us while we tried the mussels.  Too fishy  to be fresh.  Then we joked about splitting the pork chop dinner...that there was probably just one pork chop for the $19 entree.  It was classic when the waiter said yes, there was only one.  And it was neatly cut in two for us to share on a pile of tasty mashed potatoes that were unfortunately not much bigger than that half piece of pork chop.\\n\\nSure, they were probably busy with the wine tasting and the regular crowd, but getting only four pieces of bread, fishy-tasting seafood, overdone pork chop and potato portions that would make the Irish cry was not worth $30.   Sure it was funny...but I seriously questioned the viability of Murphy's as a wine expert when the wine tasting didn't even come with any palate cleansers.
