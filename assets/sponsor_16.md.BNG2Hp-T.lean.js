She was chipper and happy, asked us where we were from, how we spent our new year, and day. The customer service from her was stellar. I ordered the seasonal soup - it was mushroom soup with some other vegetables which was pureed. She came back ten minutes later saying a new batch of soup was being made because they ran out. Once the soup came, I ate it. Half way into the bowl of soup, I felt twigs in my soup which wasn't digestible. I brought this to her attention and she took the extra mile to bring my plate back to the kitchen to ask the chef what the twigs were. Turns out, the twigs were leeks used in place of potatoes (they ran out, she stated). I didn't know the kitchen staff switched up the ingredients but I am not too picky. To some, this may be a reason to leave a bad review or sour taste for the restaurant. However, she offered to take the soup off my bill totally. I decided to pick out the leeks and eat the soup anyways because I'm not cheap. This small issue spoke volumes about the restaurants stellar customer service. I was hesitant to head to this restaurant after reading the reviews but don't let other people's bad experience determine your decision. Thank you for the excellent service, Thor!"},{"name":"Lure","address":"1106 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Crescent Avenue is supposed to be THE nightlife district in Atlanta, or so I'm told. For me, it's just been a non stop construction zone for the past 10 or so years. I have memories when this area had the original  turn-of-the-last century architecture dotted with lil gems like Pasta du Pulcinella, Vickery's, Martini Bar, Cotton Club, Karma, South City Kitchen and even Club Anytime and Metro. It's too bad that Atlanta decided to tear everything down and replace with multiple mix-use high rises, never looking at reserving anything Atlanta had to offer pre 1996. After all these years, after all this non stop construction, Midtown is slowly coming together. Corporate restaurants are moving into those empty store fronts that have been sitting there for 3 or so years. \\n\\nWell... Lure finds it's place here in Midtown. It has taken the shuttered and abandoned Vickery's house and turned it into a much needed seafood restaurant. I am so happy to see this house remodeled in the way Fifth Group did. The outside dining is great, the interior is nice. Atlanta finally has a new restaurant without a \\"lofty\\" feel. Though, the colors may be drab at best, it still offers a warm setting. Lure aims to give us an alternative to the Oceanaire and Atlanta Fish Market humdrum. No longer do we need to venture downtown to Legal Seafoods and McCormick and Schmick's. \\n\\nThank GOD.\\n\\nI am most impressed with the drinks served by the knowledgeable bartenders. The array of Shochu and mixed drinks is just damn impressive. The bartenders are right on their game and deserve 5 stars all the way. We never sat without a drink, and tried many. Hands down, bartenders get the award. Lure's food, however, leaves me wanting more. The menu seems to be all over the place but never offers more than seafood. Seafood is what you get and that's it. ~You may have nothing else.~ The trout seems to be the crowd pleaser here. We had the chilled seafood platter. And I gotta say, at $36.00 I was only thrilled with the ceviche. I was uber happy to have whelks on the platter. It did leave me craving the ol' English whelks and cockles you get from the boardwalk in Anywhere Coastal, GB. I do hope Lure reaches what it aims for in this menu, which is what I assume to be inventive, worldly seafood cuisine.\\n\\n\\nOverall, I may be a little generous giving Lure four stars. I'm sure they'll shape up as these first weeks pass."},{"name":"Meianna Bakery","address":"2850 SE 82nd Ave, Unit 27","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Locally owned and really talented Baker and pastry chef this is the go place for cakes!

The reason why we came to visit this restaurant was because they listed an online special where you order 3 dishes and you get a free order of clams in black bean sauce. We were sad when we arrived at the restaurant and saw that they changed their menu to offer Hainan chicken instead of clams (and the price had gone up).\\n\\nAs with many old-school Chinese restaurants, the first thing to arrive at the table was the complimentary soup made with vegetables and some bone-in meat.\\n\\nDespite not offering clams in their special combo anymore, we did wind up ordering the combo where you pick 3 dishes and you get 1/4 Hainan Chicken for $55.95 (you also get rice and dessert with the combo). Hainan (or Hainanese) Chicken is served cold and with a nice dipping sauce (this version was bone-in chicken).\\n\\nThe Beef Brisket and Radish Hot Pot was quite large with a plentiful amount of daikon radish (but noticeably fewer pieces of beef brisket). The tender beef brisket was good and had plenty of sauce that's perfect for sopping up with rice.\\n\\nSimilarly, the Seafood and Tofu Hot Pot was a generous portion and contained shrimp, fish, and squid along with the tofu.\\n\\nOur third dish was the Chinese Mushroom and Veggies. As with all of the other dishes, the ingredients aren't cut up into bite size pieces (probably to save time). This does make it a bit harder to eat things (especially when you try to take a bite out of a whole Chinese mushroom.\\n\\nDessert was a Tapioca soup which was not overly sweet.\\n\\nOverall, the food itself was pretty good but the pieces were cut large (which makes it difficult to eat) and there's really nothing which makes this place shine.

The owner was very concerned and kept encouraging us to eat and try the flavour before the fries became too soggy - turns out he and his staff have been tweaking the flavour and seasoning on all of their food items since they opened a mere two weeks ago based on customer feedback.

The wings were so juicy and cooked perfectly - I thought the sweetness was right on but I also prefer my food a bit on the sweeter side. The house fries were better than the brisket fries in my opinion - I liked the slightly spicy seasoning even though I'm typically not a fan of spicy foods. And the plain fries definitely had a very good crisp to them - they were the more slender \\"straw\\" variety which made it easier for me to eat more of them. \\n\\nI think the customer service was excellent and the owner's desire to improve and serve great product really came through with his receptiveness for feedback and constructive criticism.

I tried my best to be understanding and polite to the host staff and you are enjoying the fact that our night is ruined (or heaven forbid, doing it on purpose)? I had an ice cream cake in their back freezer, so we couldn't leave the restaurant easily. We had been waiting so long that we started losing members of our party who had other places to be after dinner. Our party of 10 dwindled down to 6 after 1.5 hours of waiting for a table. Happy Birthday?\\n\\nOnce we were sat everything was wonderful. Our waitress was great and very friendly. They brought over a round of complimentary shots to apologize for the wait (which was very appreciated). The food, as I said, was delicious. But due to dinner now being so late, our after dinner plans were missed/ruined and everyone went home. It was very disheartening to work hard to organize a birthday dinner, only to have the majority of the staff treat us so poorly. Overall the night was sadly a failure, no matter how delicious the meal was. If I eat here again I think it will just be a take out order."},{"name":"Cafe Gauguin","address":"9840 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"I tend to be very hard on the Rosen properties, because sometimes, they tend to have a higher opinion of themselves than warranted.

Now this was nomtastic.  This large tasty fish is pan roasted with some greens, greek olives, fennel, and smoke chili.  I don't know if it's because I haven't had fish in a while or because it was just really good, but I had a food blackout and devoured it.  The server de-boned the fish tableside, so I wouldn't have to.  Yah I'm lazy.  I love munchkins and when the server explained that the Greek Doughnuts were donut holes, I had to order them.

I attempted to reach them by phone to place my order several times only to get a voicemail repeatedly only saying to leave a message for when you want your reservation. I did not want a reservation I wanted to talk to a human being and make a to go order. This was the first ordeal I had to go through. I finally got through to a hostess to be told that they do take deliveries over the phone, however, they were \\"too busy\\" to write down a simple to go order. Instead I was told that I could come in person and make a to go order....how can a hostess not write down a order over the phone, but if I drag myself in that was the only way. Once I got there, with my order in check from looking over the online menu, I am told that that menu was not updated from quite some time ago, creating problem number two of deciding on a complete different order for two people on the spot. Nonetheless I do and I ask how long one dish will take and am told \\"I don't take orders so I don't know\\" and am told the pizza however will take 15-20 minutes. So I wrote number down after they asked for it knowing that only one dish will take 15-20 minutes, but they have my number so they can call and simply tell me when the other dish is ready. An hour and a half later, I was very patient waiting that long, without receiving a phone call still I finally called...once again straight to voicemail then again I finally get through and explain my situation to the hostess who informs me that \\"the bartender threw away my number and if she wanted it she would have to go through a trashcan in the bar\\" and goes on to explain that she expected me to come in after 20 minutes since \\"thats what she said\\" about one simple dish. She continues to tell me that she was not going to go through the trash and just ended up throwing the whole order out. Basically it was my fault for the bartender throwing away my number and not coming in 20 minutes later because she had told me, when in reality she said she had no idea because she was not a server...clearly incapable of even asking a nearby waiter. They did not apologize once, instead their compliment was that they could re order it for me if I wanted. This restaurant tries to act like a legitimate Osteria, when in reality their service suck and their food is far from anything near the prices they charge. Hey Winflo owner and or manager tonight get your shit together and learn how to get some respectable hostesses and non incompetent bartenders that thrown away phone numbers to contact the customers when the food is ready for pick up. In fact you should just shut down this restaurant and learn how to run a legitimate Osteria or whatever the hell you call your restaurant, because it sure as hell is not a Osteria....here is a real Osteria http://hostaria.com in Aspen, CO, maybe you could learn something from their website...maybe update your menu, something along those lines.

Gone are the days of gigantic portions that should be 3-4 meals each with little regard to quality.....or super cheesy d√©cor.  The inside is now much fancier and almost the entire space has been upgraded.  There are cool inserts of six ft. tall cases of wine corks, Portuguese glass and stoneware all around the restaurant and I think even an updated bar area.\\n\\nThe new owners have done just about everything right on the inside and it seems to have a lively atmosphere, at least it was for a recent dinner show we attended.  My understanding is that they also have a guitarist one day a week although I don't remember the exact day.  Service was spectacular and even sincere all night long, nobody had attitudes and people were just genuinely friendly.\\n\\nFor our special dinner, it started with a side salad that included fresh mozzarella and roasted peppers.  The peppers could have used a little more char on them and a few of the greens were not the freshest.  Dinner consisted of a pork roll with mashed potatoes and broccoli rabe.  Everything was outstanding except the pork was a tad overcooked and dry.  We ended up getting two desserts and thought the tiramisu was amazing balanced with sweetness and the right amount of cake with not being overly drowned by the other ingredients.\\n\\nI won't review the show since it likely won't be back but there was a lot of confusion when it was over.  I wish the waitresses anticipated when this might be so people could have had checks closed out and been on there way, instead we had to stay an extra 10 minutes while they hunted everyone down and it was already past 11 PM at that point.  Really the only flaw in the otherwise impeccable service.\\n\\nI hope Rocco's can find its footing and figure out if it is going to go an Italian route or Portuguese with the new ownership.

This is my usual when I work at the clinic next door - something quick and cheap that can get me through the night. \\n\\nI'll admit I've never dined in at Cazuela's which could bias my reviews of the place. Flautas, the chimichanga, and fish tacos are all items I've tried as take-out with good result.

The actual restaurant is a bit cramped and is usually a full house on most evenings. I can see wait times being pretty long if dining in - take-out has been relatively fast. It is clear it needs a nice new coat of paint and some wiping down.

The fact that the managers noticed problems and corrected them before I could even think to complain was phenomenal.

Sure the food is great and organic but if you were to visit any other Chipotle establishment within a 5 mile radius, you'd get the same delicious, organic food. The actual restaurant, however, is nice. It's perched up from the street so you get a small break from the hustle and bustle (forgive the use of outdated lingo) of DTX. As well, because of its proximity to the financial district, it does attract a fair amount of businessmen. For these reasons, it's great for people-watching, especially if you sit by the window. As for the service, it's OK. Not the worst I've received but some ways behind the best. It ranges from surprisingly pleasant to unsurprisingly nonchalant.

My husband and I shared the Dragon Soup, and he had the Peking Pork Ribs while I had the Salt and Pepper Squid.  I think we also had a pupu platter that we split with all of our friends.

The owner ended up knowing us very well and provided excellent service and food. The side dishes were delicious, the meat quality was superb, and the prices were reasonable. After I moved up to Seattle for school, my parents stopped going to Toji because the food just wasn't the same anymore. Five years later, when my bf and I were in town, we decided to go to my \\"favorite\\" KBBQ spot! As soon as I walked in, the owner saw and recognized me immediately (that's what happens when you come here every week for a year...). \\n\\nWe ordered japchae as an appetizer and chose kalbi and bulgogi to grill. Back then, I recall the side dishes (banchan) being incredibly delicious and could be a meal in itself. Now, they lack flavor and are measly in comparison to before. Mostly sprouts, no fish cake or acorn jelly. They used to have bomb kimchi but I barely touched it this time. When the japchae arrived, I noticed 2 things: the portion was incredibly small (for $10) and came quite watery. My non-Korean bf loves japchae and even for having an untrained (very American) palate, he knew right away this was not good japchae. It was WAY too sweet and the noodles were slightly overcooked. He kept commenting on how \\"sticky\\" it was and didn't eat much of it. \\n\\nWhen the meats arrived, I was particularly excited for the marinated kalbi. They had some of the best kalbi and was the main reason why my family came here so often. The kalbi was on point! It came perfectly marinated, was tender and juicy. But the bulgogi...oh gosh, it was terrible! First off, I think 50% of it was fat. I held up portions of it with my tongs and was disgusted by how much fat remained. I used scissors to cut off as much fat as I could and ended up with a heap of nasty that could have been a whole portion's worth of bulgogi. The meat was also very pale. It was hard to differentiate the fat from the meat because the meat was pink, almost grey in color! My mom's made bulgogi plenty of times for me to know that is not the normal color of bulgogi. Finally, after cooking it, I tried some of the bulgogi and it tasted as if it was marinated in the same stuff as the japchae! Again, way too sweet and not what bulgogi is supposed to taste like... \\n\\nI know good Korean food and this is not it. When I took a look around the restaurant, I only saw one group of Koreans. I have a theory: good ethnic restaurants will have many patrons of that ethnicity because who else would know their own food best? If you know what real Korean food tastes like, you wouldn't be coming here for it. \\n\\nI appreciated the owner recognizing me but aside from that, I am disappointed with my recent experience and even more disappointed by that fact that I'm disappointed... :( \\n\\nCons:\\n- Tiny parking lot. There's less than 15 stalls total\\n- Quality has gone down \\n- Food no longer has that authentic Korean taste; more suitable for an Americanized palate \\n- Charges for extra rice (seriously, Korean restaurants are KNOWN for free extra bowls of rice?!) and reluctant to give extra side dishes \\n- prices have gone up (darn you inflation!)"},{"name":"WedgeHead","address":"3728 NE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Love this place!

I ordered an egg and cheese sandwich on a plain bagel. I was hoping for egg whites but they don't serve that. All I can say is I expected so much more. I had no idea that the eggs are warmed up definitely not fresh.  The bagels are a step up from dunkin donuts and the egg and cheese is much better at dd. I couldn't even tell what type of cheese that was. Also had an iced coffee that tasted watery.  I've been to bagel places that cook to order fresh off a grill. But I havent found a place like that in the area.

The new Austin \\"flagship\\" store, that just opened in the old Bennigan's location in front of the Tech Ridge HEB at Parmer and 35, is many times larger (and much closer to home).\\n\\nThe store is in two halves.  The right half is the retail side, featuring the fridges on the left holding the ready-to-heat meals, and a consultation room in the back.  The right side has the registers near the door, and a \\"cafe\\" area armed with microwaves for those that want to eat there.  I'm curious to see how well that does.\\n\\nThe left half of the building is the kitchen/assembly area that will supply much of the Austin area.  There are windows looking in around the outside of the building, and on the adjoining wall from the retail side (though it looks like it's refrigerated, and fogs up) for the food voyeurs among us. \\n\\nThe good:\\n- staff always seems eager to help.  I've seen some reports otherwise, but we've never seen it.  Today, Henry helped us out.  Being veterans, after checking in with us, he knew my wife wouldn't need constant care.  But he dashed across the store when he saw she was getting an armful of stuff to carry it to the register for her.  I'm sure that strategy keeps folks from putting stuff back, but it does seem nice\\n- the food is always fresh, and 90% of the menu is gluten free.  If you have a special diet, you can probably find good choices here.\\n- since the food isn't frozen, it's much faster to heat up when you're really pressed for time.  It's also easier to make sure it's heated thru since you never end up with a little block of ice in the center of boiling lava like you sometimes get with \\"frozen foods\\".\\n- There is a very big selection of foods available.  Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  I'd like to know how the selection here compares to the Braker store, or even the selection in HEB stores.  We were shocked at how large a section they have at the McNeil/Parmer HEB.\\n- the trays the food comes in are great to reuse for your home leftovers.\\n\\nThe not as good:\\n- The food is fresh, and not frozen.  That's a selling point for them, but it means that we can't get a full week's worth at once.  What we bought today is \\"best by\\" 3 days from now.  It's best if you pick up twice a week.  Sometimes that's not as convenient to do.  There is internet ordering, etc., which might make it easier.  But since we zip in and out of there in under 5 minutes usually, we haven't tried that.\\n- It's not cheap.  The lunch/dinners are near $7 for the \\"small\\", and go up from there.  If you are the type that thinks they should be priced the same as your average Lean Cuisine, you're going to be sorely disappointed.  But to a certain extent, you get what you pay for.  I'd still say stop by and give it a look. \\n\\nDon't forget the free lemons!\\n\\nSuggestion:  My wife has some favorites, and has also had some she hasn't been in love with (which isn't unexpected).  Especially at this store, with all the room, and the microwaves/tables, you should schedule occasional  \\"happy hours\\" with a few different samples for folks to try (esp. when you are developing something new).  That might bring in new curious customers, and expand what some current customers purchase.

We arrived at 12:15pm,  seated and meat arrived at 12;25pm.  At 1:20pm when we asked for one more which would be our last plate, we were told time is up.  End of story.   If we are 2 or 4 people sharing a grill, I am fine they count to the second with a stop watch. As that is fair.  Buffet needs boundary to avoid abuse. But when there are 6 customers sharing a small grill.  The fact that they gave us 55 mins grilling time and no flexibility whatsoever is not good .

The result is ridiculous.  $32 for a lunch buffet? Please.  $15 for just basic of your ramen (and then $5 per additional ingredient)? Ugh.  \\n\\nI ordered two small plates: citrus bacon wrapped mushrooms and vegetarian spring rolls.  What a disappointment.  For $8 you get four bites (literally bites) of mushrooms wrapped in un-rendered bacon, which was chew and mushy and spongy.  I ended up having the peel the bacon off and just eat the mushrooms.  So $8 for four half-bites of mushrooms.  And the spring rolls?  Store-bought, freezer-stored, not fresh, greasy rolls.  You know, the kind where you can buy a 50-count bag for $3 at Trader Joe's if you ever get the notion to make microwave Thai food at home?  $6 dollars for that?  Please.\\n\\nMy colleague got a Ramen (which, with only very basic ingredients, ended up costing him $20... for lunch).  He felt bad for me and my pathetically unsatisfying lunch, so he offered me what was left of his Ramen when he was full.  Now, i'm not a person who likes salty foods, at all.  But I also understand that a small amount of salt in cooking is necessary to bring out flavors.  Clearly something the kitchen staff did NOT understand.  It was bland, bland, bland.

There were10 people in our party, so we each ordered 2 tapas plates and shared them. There ended up being enough food for a small wedding reception.\\n\\nMy favorites were the Canelon de Pollo (baked chicken and spinach with a tomato and cheese sauce) and the Patatas Bravas (fried potato with spicy tomato cream sauce). Out of the 20 different dishes I tried, about 7 were hits and the rest were misses or simply mediocre. All the tapas were well-priced between $4-7.\\n\\nI got the Pastel Basque for dessert (chocolate cookie, toffee, bananas, and whipped cream). Holy connoli, this was absolutely dynamite--it reminded me of banoffee pie I had in London. Needless to say, the birthday girl wished she had gotten this instead of her Apple Tartlet.\\n\\nThe sangria here is a must-try. It's almost as good as the stuff I had in Barcelona.

The Farm Egg Antipasti was an amazing surprise the pork meatballs dish was very well paired with the fig-tomato base.  I also loved the Suppli which was risotto and mozarella fried in a corn base.  It may have been better paired with a nice tomato-based sauce, but still tasted good on it's own.   The butternut squash mezzalune tasted fresh, simple and the sage-pecorino combination on top was the perfect finish.  My only complaint with the entire meal was the over-doing of raisins in the sauce that went with the mezzzalune.  Holding back some of the raisins or not actually putting raisins in there (even though they are part of the sauce) would've been so much better!

I can't believe they charge so much for what you get.  And not to mention the ingredients don't even taste the fresh.  I would avoid the sirloin steak like the plague.

The restaurant feels like an upscale place from Buckhead or Midtown, with tons of plants, wooden trim, wide open bar, and plenty of glass, letting in outside light. There's a feeling of lightness/airiness to it all that I really, really appreciated. Once a lunch or dinner rush is in progress, though, the restaurant quickly begins to feel cramped, as tables are rather close to one another, and the ambient noise of others becomes a little too much. \\n\\nMENU (2/5):\\nWhile the flavor was pretty authentic (I'm southern Vietnamese), the dishes are incredibly expensive, and the selection is quite limited. I was rather disappointed with the lack of variety. I live in Marietta and had wanted a Vietnamese restaurant in the area for a long time, but I think I'll just continue driving to Dunwoody, Doraville, or Duluth for my Vietnamese food. \\n\\nFLAVOR (4/5):\\nFor this visit, my husband and I had ordered the pork chop with shrimp plate. The flavor was authentic, but the pork was tough to cut. We were also given the wrong knives to even attempt cutting the pork.\\n\\nSERVICE (2/5):\\nI visited NAM Kitchen right before the dinner rush began (so about 5pm). Our waitress was a young woman named Sky(e). Though our food came out on time and she was attentive with our waters, twice she attempted to remove my husband's plate despite the fact that he hadn't been finished with it. \\n\\nThe second time, she just grabbed the plate and left without a single word. She disappeared into the kitchen before we could call for her. (The restaurant is small, and she was rushing back to the kitchen.) When we pointed it out, she could do nothing but apologize, saying she hadn't noticed food on the plate! That makes it seem as if she simply wasn't attentive at all. \\n\\nMost places would compensate for having taken, without permission, food we had paid for. Neither the waitress nor the hostess mentioned a single thing, though the hostess had offered to call us back. When I'd asked for what purpose, she'd had no reply. I don't just give out my number to businesses.\\n\\nWhile I tipped because our waitress did bring us water in a timely manner, I wouldn't say that anything else was complimentary regarding her behavior.\\n\\nLOCATION (5/5):\\nNAM is located at the new Sandy Springs performance arts center plaza, with plenty of free 2 hour parking.

No complaints here. Everyone at the table was happy with their martini choices. Each of us also choose an original cannoli and we all loved our choice. The ricotta was just sweet enough, not overly sweet, creamy and the perfect match to the crispy shell. My local friend said it was definitely better than the other places close by that had long lines for their cannolis! So glad we chose this place.

Kind of kills dinner when you are the only one eating because everyone has eaten already! Would love to say the wait was worth it, but it was not. My carne asada was 4 chunks of fairly thick steak that were so insanely salty I couldn't even finish it. I'm not sure what they marinade in, but everyone at the table agreed. Salt was the ONLY thing I tasted. And honestly, any decent management would have offered to comp something off of our bill with the wait we had for my meal, if not the actual dinner we waited on at least the drinks or chips and salsa. \\n\\nTotally not worth the price or the hype.

I had an 8 o'clock reservation for a party of three to celebrate a coworker's new job. When we arrived, the hostess claimed they mistakenly had us listed for a party of two, and that we would need to wait for 20 minutes before being seated. Surprised, since there were at least two empty tables inside and eight empty patio tables, we were relegated to the bar. Couldn't help noticing that that during our wait, tables were being cleared and new patrons being seated, some that arrived well after we did. After a half hour of waiting, one of my friends went to the front to ask how much longer for the wait. She was told that there were two parties of two that had priority before us. Interesting, since those parties of two arrived after we did. \\n\\nI've lived in the Columbus area my whole life, and I consider this to be a pretty open-minded town. It wasn't hard to notice that there were only two other African Americans in the restaurant, both seated with white patrons. In my mind I was giving the restaurant every benefit of the doubt and refused to jump to conclusions. I've never had issues at any other restaurant in Columbus regarding my complexion, and this surely couldn't be the case tonight. My optimism soon diminished, and the final straw came after 45 minutes of patiently waiting when a party of six was seated after only a five-minute wait at the bar.\\n\\nFrustrated and hungry, we left the restaurant. On the way out, my friend commented to the hostess about the poor service and how we weren't given patio options, yet \\"certain\\" patrons were given priority over us time after time. The hostess then ran after us in the parking lot to issue an empty apology and to let us know they had a table ready. Really? We had to bring up the apparent issue of race in order to be seated?

Clintonvillian if you will! In the span of one and a half months, two of my very favorite mini-chains have opened locations in my neighborhood. In late September/early October, we celebrated a new Jeni's, and in November, we celebrate a new Graffiti Burger. But unlike Jeni's, which is in the northern part of Clintonville just slightly too far for an evening walk, Graffiti Burger is practically right across the street from my apartment. I. Could. Not. Be. Happier.\\n\\nBeyond the wonderful atmosphere, beyond the delicious fries, the delectable thick shake, and the friendly and helpful staff, Graffiti Burger makes a damn good burger. Customizable to a tee, this burger is so tasty, so thick and so packed with my fix-ins. I got mine with bacon, mayo, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, and provolone cheese. The only one of those toppings that cost extra was the bacon, at an extra $1. This burger will fall apart as you eat it, and you will be picking at every last morsel with your sticky hands because it is that good.\\n\\nSpecifically at this Graffiti Burger, I loved the neighborhood pride that the graffiti on the walls instills. I loved seeing Studio 35, neighboring schools and their mascots, and the Old North Columbus arch. The staff was extremely friendly. The woman who took our order up front used to work at the Grandview location, and said she recognized Rachel P. and I. She was super helpful, and when no one was up at the front, she went around asking if people needed anything, and she cleared plates. When we were done, the guy replacing ketchup bottles took our empty plates. It didn't even seem like it was his job; but he did it anyway. They are so, so good to you there.\\n\\nThe burger was excellent. The fries were a perfect mix of soft and crunchy and well seasoned (a medium is a good size to share between two), and the milkshake... ohh the milkshake. No words folks.\\n\\nIt is clear Clintonville is a right fit for Graffiti Burger. Across the street, Patrick J's said \\"Welcome to the Ville, Graffiti Burger\\" on their sign. How awesome! I am certain people from OSU will make the trek up the #2 bus or take a long walk for this delicious food. My only suggestion to Graffiti Burger? Even though you are seen as a hip but family-friendly establishment, you will get HUGE business from possibly drunk college students from the hours of 11pm to 2am (and possibly beyond) on Friday and Saturday nights. Even though you want to maintain an understandably clean image, no one would blame you for staying open a few hours later to appease that demographic. Your returns will be large, this I guarantee. \\n\\nGraffiti Burger, you have become a regular in my local food outings.

The inside is pretty cozy in the winter, but if the weather is nice, definitely go for the patio, so you can people-watch on Newbury.\\n\\nI'd start with the tuna tartare.  Out of the appetizers, the rock shrimp quesadilla and the gnocchi also make good lighter entree options.\\n\\nSignature dishes include the burger, which is huge, moist, topped with caramelized onions and sauteed mushrooms - I guess you can't really go wrong with that combination. I love their entree salads in the mid afternoon or for dinner for a lighter option.  My favorite is the grilled jumbo shrimp salad, with giant prawns with a nice slight charred mark but still plump and sweet - it's not cheap, though, at $23.\\n\\nLobster pot pie is another classic, which in my opinion is way better than the lobster roll.  It's very comforting in the winter.  Also, try the mac and cheese to share with the table, as eating it on your own can be a little too heavy.\\n\\nAs for desserts, the only one I really enjoyed was the caramelized apple bread pudding, with warm caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream.\\n\\nIn all honesty, for the price, it's overrated, but as far as Newbury dining goes, it's one of the the better options."},{"name":"Flyers Wings & Grill","address":"5621 W Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Terrible go and eat with a lot of people they automatically charge tip to your bill \\nThey rude and racist."},{"name":"3 Margaritas","address":"592 S Mccaslin Blvd","city":"Louisville","stars":"3.5","text":"CREDIT CARD FRAUD ALERT!\\nCREDIT CARD FRAUD ALERT!\\n\\n\\nI'm a huge fan of 3 Margs so recently on a trip to Louisville (I'm in Ft Collins and eat at the one here monthly) I saw 3 Margs and knew it was good so we stopped in here to eat.

Now there's obviously the possibility that this waiter didn't steal my card # but the the fact that this card hadn't been used in weeks and suddenly hours after using it at this 3 Margs it's stolen is a major red flag.  \\n\\nI still love 3 Margs and will keep going to my local one but it's worth warning people that there's a middle aged waiter at the 3 Margs in Louisville that is 'most likely' jacking your CC# and sending it to friends/family in CA. \\n\\nAnd if you're wondering how somebody in CA can make purchases without the physical card in their hand, they aren't. They simply take the number and recode the magnetic strip on the back of a card they have (you can by these little recoding devices on Ebay).

Went out there for wine down wednesday a couple weeks ago. Heard some good things, so needed to check it out for myself. Not much of a wine drinker, but I do enjoy a glass every now and then and if there's free food involved, im all about it! \\n\\nSo the deal for wine down wednesday is, you pay $20 bucks, they give you a wrist band, and you get all the wine you can drink and food you can eat from 5pm-8pm. The first thing I noticed that I really didnt like was the fact that if your doing the $20 wine deal, you have to pretty much stand around outside because they are saving all the seats and tables for all the suposed dining guest. Which is really stupid because from 5-8 the only people there are the wine down crowd. So here I am standing outside in the heat with my wine glass in one hand and my food in the other, with all these people walking by and constantly bumping into me. \\n\\nNow about the complimentary food.... first of all they give you these tiny little plastic plates which can barely even fit one little peice of flatbread on them. So if your really hungry you will have to be making a lot of trips from the outside area to the buffet inside in order to get more food. They have quite a spread of food, but it really wasnt that great either. They had some kinda veggie pasta that looked like it was left over from lunch time. Crackers and some kinda nasty looking dip. There was these neat little smores display with gramcracker, marshmallow and chocolate although the chocolate was sitting in a fondue pot that wasnt even heated which made it very difficult to scoop out. The flatbread selection was pretty decent. Basically it was just a bunch of little nick nack stuff that looked they had just thrown together without much thought. And the one thing that really grossed me about about the whole food display was that most of the stuff like the flatbreads and crackers and stuff had no serving utincles so everyone there was pretty much just sticking their hands all in the food.\\n\\nI will not be going back for wine down wednesday.

Our server (Alexis) was friendly and attentive.  For apps we had the crab cake and a few oysters. Presentation was great and the food was fantastic.  My wife and I agreed that the crab cake was one of the best we'd ever had.  For entrees we both got steak.  She had the skirt steak and I ordered the hanger steak.

I was a little overwhelmed at how I had to go on a tour when I arrived before I could consume. I think they would win the client over better if they greeted them with a tasting of their preferred wine while showing them the various options for consumption. Let me explain. \\nIt first appears to be a regular wine bar where you order off the menu but once you see the menu, you'll notice there are only 4 different choices for red or for white. Well at a wine bar, that is pretty shockingly low, I have to say. Most wine bars offer 20 or more choices ( at least ) per type (red vs white etc ). Well at Vino  Venue, you have the option to purchase a tasting card that is prepaid and you can decide how big the pour is  ( in ounces ) at an Italian dispensing station so that you may try various different wines. Yet I found the majority of the wines available at this place were extremely expensive, such at $25 a full pour/glass. I wasn't able to try the food menu since I had just eaten dinner but it looked pretty promising. I feel there should be more options on the service/wine menu and more mid price options on the self-serve dispenser \\"menu\\".

I was pulled into the restaurant, considering that Japanese food in Vancouver is rather a safe and decent choice and the number of awards and \\"Trip Advisor\\" stickers on the door were quite abundant.

However, the texture of the seafood seemed like it was way overdue in the freezer and not properly cooked or defrosted.  In fact, some of the seafood was not even floating in the soup, which would indicate that it was not completely cooked.  The squid also had a sour/bitter taste in the center.  My bowl of udon was mostly noodles, with very limited seafood and vegetables.  The only source of vegetables were bean sprouts.  Typically, there would be some actual greens or carrots.\\n\\nGiven the rule of restaurant dining that \\"despite bad food, you should still tip appropriately as tip is for service\\", I decided I would still tip appropriately.

(I'm a dim sum gangsta.) In order to break the awkwardness, I introduced myself. And in our conversation, I found out that they're both from the Atlanta 'burbs and have lived there for over 20 years! So I had to ask them the most important question of all: \\"Where do Chinese people go for Chinese food in the Atlanta metro?\\" Their answer? Canton Cooks #1. \\n\\nTwo weeks later I'm sucking the sh** out of a garlic cooked crab and stuffing salt & pepper squid (same time? Maybe) without shame, while washing everything down with hot tea in front of my Taiwanese girlfriend and her mother. Authentic Cantonese eats? Hell yeah.\\n\\nI. FOOD\\nLook, I wouldn't venture to this restaurant if you're the type of person that likes to eat Kung Pao Beef, General Tso's chicken, or cream cheese wantons. Honestly, I've never met an Asian person that has liked or ordered these dishes. (If you have, feel free to introduce yourself to me, because that would be a first. lol.) Canton Cooks is for authentic Cantonese eats, so consider ordering what we had:\\n\\n*Fish Maw Soup: I'm not sure what all is in there -- think one of the things is fish lung? -- but it's delectable and a great way to start a meal.\\n\\n*Lobster w/ Garlic Sauce: Honestly, I don't think there's any better way to consume lobster. It's messy, so be prepared to use your hands. And like what I did, suck the sh** out of them shells, yo.\\n\\n*Steamed Sea Bass w/ Soy Sauce & Garlic: It was good, but definitely could have used more soy sauce. Also, the fish itself tasted like it's been in the freezer for a while. Not bad, but not sure if we could've ordered it again.\\n\\n*Salt & Pepper Squid: We read the Yelp reviews and decided to include this dish in our order. And you know what? It was one of the best that night. Nicely fried, perfectly chewy, and slightly spicy -- I could eat this all day. \\n\\n*Pea Tips: It could use a tad bit more salt, but I loved it. Veggie lovers, this is a must.\\n\\n*Seafood Chowfun: Sauce was a bit too watery, and I think they could've used some starch to thicken it up. It's my preference, though, and not a knock against how they cook it.\\n\\nII. SERVICE\\nThere was a lot of yelling in this restaurant from the owner/ manager, so we definitely took this as a sign of fast service. (And it was!) Owner/ manager also came out and talked with my girlfriend's ma. She's cool. lol. \\n\\nIII. ATMOSPHERE/ D√âCOR\\nIt's drab, yet it looks like many other authentic Cantonese restaurants I've been to. In other words, it's not the type of place a dude should take a lady on a first date. It is the type of place to see if she's wifey. Nah mean? Lol.\\n\\nIV. PRICES\\n$12-$30+ for dishes. Obviously, the cost of seafoods depends on the season so they fluctuate. Very reasonable, though. If you got all those dishes above, it'll cost you somewhere north of $130+. \\n\\nV. OVERALL\\nI'll continue to search for great Cantonese in the \\"A,\\" but for right now Canton Cooks is the clear favorite. Thanks mysterious Taiwanese couple! If you're reading this, send me a message so we can reconnect! Maybe over some lobster with garlic sauce."},{"name":"Old Chicago Pizza & Taproom","address":"100 Superior Plaza Way, Ste 100","city":"Superior","stars":"2.5","text":"Great place to go for a midnight burger or wings.

I replied just checking on that sub is it almost ready? His response \\"NO\\" I said want to check if he's making it? NO!! I said pal it's been 20 minutes I'm all set thanks.

We arrived here around 4:30 PM on a sunny Saturday afternoon and we were promptly seated upon arrival and our drink order was taken.\\n\\nWe ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes ($7) to start, which were deep fried hot and crispy (slightly greasy), served with a cool ranch dipping sauce. This was very good!\\n\\nFor dinner, I went with the Berkshire Pulled Pork Tray ($18) served with 1 cold scoop & 1 hot scoop, soft white bread, pickles & onions. The pulled pork was moist and juicy and had nice smoky flavors. The potato salad was creamy and the potato chunks had a firm texture. The broccoli & cheese casserole was rich and filling.\\n\\nMy buddy went with the Fat Cheeks Tray ($26) choosing 3 meats including pulled pork, brisket, & pork ribs served with 1 cold scoop, 1 hot scoop, soft white bread, pickles & onions. Each of the meats had good smoky flavors. The brisket was very tender with some fat attached. The ribs on the bone were slightly chewy. The carrot & raisin salad was very good, which had a good tangy flavor with shredded carrots, raisins, greens, & crumbled bleu cheese. The hot collard greens were pretty good.\\n\\nThe portions of food were generous and we barely finished our dinners. We had to pass on the dessert. I would've ordered some butterscotch pudding if I saved room. The service was attentive with refills given on our soft drinks and the food arrived in timely order.\\n\\nAfter dinner, I asked our server if Tiffani was in the restaurant and mentioned my sister's name. Tiffani stopped by to say hello and asked us how the food was.

Nay, the need.  \\n\\nThe only thing that quiets the beast is a DQ blizzard with Butterfinger and Oreo.  There is nothing like it, and I know that 56th and Division has me covered, every time.  Their parking lot sucks on a multitude of levels, and their drive thru is a true oxymoron in the summery months.  None of that matters to me when I get the calling - the giant DQ beacon in the sky.

Both times the place was busy and very full. Like most chinese restaurants, one should not come here expecting good service. Though the last time we were here for my mothers birthday, the servers were more rude than I would like. Food took long to come, therefore we were there for longer. The staff then asks us to hurry and eat our birthday cake because we had stayed there a long time. I really didn't appreciate that. I rarely comment on bad service but that really rubbed me the wrong way. With that being said though, service does not change my view of the food.\\n\\nThe last time we came here we ordered...(not sure what all the names really were, was a bad yelper and forgot to take pictures of things)\\n\\nHouse special soya chicken - this was the bomb dot com. Don't know what they do but man that soya based sauce was so delicious. The chicken itself was super moist and juicy! Nothing bad to say about this and would HIGHLY recommend it! According to my mother, this is something that needs to be ordered ahead of time because they do tend to sell out (sorry that I don't have an actual name)\\n\\nSalted egg yolk dry ribs - for those who love the whole salted egg yolk craze, this is definitely a must get. There are other salted egg yolk items on the menu as well like the famous lobster, but we chose to get the ribs as we weren't really feeling shellfish that day. The rub was so flavourful and the meat still juicy. It was a little heavy so you wouldn't be able to eat a lot of it but it was a great dish for family style.\\n\\nEnoki and egg tofu with veggies - how can you go wrong with egg tofu dishes, you really can't. This dish was good nothing too exciting or special. \\n\\nBraised vermicelli pot - this was a crowd pleaser for sure. Very flavourful dish. The vermicelli just absorbed all the flavours. This was the last item to come and even though we were all very full we managed to finish this very large portioned dish.\\n\\nShrimp paste fried morning glory - this was also very nice. The shrimp paste was not overwhelming and balance of flavour was on point. Not to salty so the sweetness of the morning glory was still there. Very impressed with this dish.\\n\\nDessert was the very well known mango pudding along with our birthday cake. \\n\\nTL;DR\\nFood is good. Service... is the same as other chinese restaurants. But you don't come for the service. You tolerate it for good food.

In all, it was great, the Japanese Manga books at the front while we waited along with the many iconic Japanese trinkets and figurines gave us plenty to look at while we waited.

We looked up some of the places and we came across Nagoya Sushi. I looked them up on Yelp and say a good review posted by one of the elites that has proven to be accurate in his reviews of other places I have been to that he reviewed. We agreed this was our place to dine this evening...\\n\\nWhen we arrived, there was a father and son that had just left and they were likely sitting at the sushi bar since there was 2 uncleared spots. The staff quickly cleared everything and we were given menus. The server was very nice and assisted my wife with her Sake selection. Iced tea with lime for me as usual. We looked over the menu and finally decided on several of the sushi options and two of the seafood soups that sounded pretty tasty.\\n\\nWe were brought warm towels to clean our hands and shortly after that our drinks arrived. While I was waiting on our drinks I decided to snap off a few pictures since I really liked the decor of this place. If you look at the pictures, you will see that on top of the sushi case there are two serving trays and I can only assume they were from the guests before us because of the food particles on them. To my surprise, the sushi chef put one of the rolls un-sliced rolls we ordered on that dirty plate. I immediately told my wife not to drink any more of her Sake. About 1 minute later, he reaches up and grabs the roll, sets it on the counter in front of him and starts to slice it. \\n\\nI said to my wife we will not be staying and told her to hang on. I motioned over my server and quietly let him know what I just observed and to please cancel our order. We immediately left. They may have very good food for all I know but when I see something like that take place, I leave and never return."},{"name":"FuddoYama Ramen","address":"8610 SW Hall Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"I love the interior, although most of it was left behind from the previous business. They definitely added a Japanese aura to it by adding the cute lanterns and table accessories. \\n\\nI'm all for short, simple menus. The one thing I dislike most is having to read a novel-sized menu in order to pick one dish, so I'm really glad they kept it concise. Although I'm sad they had limited both options, they made up for it when the variety of toppings and protein you can choose from. \\n\\nThe broth itself seemed a lot creamier than what I'm use to. Other places I've visited in Oregon make it clearer but this broth almost looked like Tom yum at first glance. I personally don't like it too creamy, but it wasn't salty and that's a plus. The chashu pork was really good because the basically pan fry it to a crisp and then put it into the soup. The noodles tasted fine to me, although my friend got a chunk of noodles clumped together and tasted rubbery and she wondered if it was made in store or not.. \\n\\nThe appetizers were great for the price and I liked the sauces that came with them. The Kara-gae was cut pretty thin which made it super crispy but some pieces were dryer than others, making them lose their juiciness in the middle but I like my chicken either way. \\n\\nThe staff was helpful and attentive, the wait for food was quick, the prices are good, and overall I really liked it!

The place doesn't look like much: a hidden strip mall shop near Sand Lake Road and John Young Parkway with a few tables, minimal decor, some typical Japanese lanterns, etc. like it could be any other sushi place in town. But look a little closer and you can see along the walls...specials of the day like squid legs fried spicy and cooked sting ray.\\n\\nFor appetizers, we chose the chicken karaage, made with juicy, succulent, and well seasoned pieces of fried chicken. Definitely a must try. The grilled squid appetizer, which appears to be an entire squid cut horizontally and grilled, was good but at times could be a bit chewy for my tastes. Maybe I should have went for the squid legs fried spicy instead.\\n\\nThe sushi here is some of the best I've had in town for the sheer freshness and taste of the ingredients. The aji - \\"horse mackerel\\" - nigiri is one of my favorites, luscious and tender, topped with scallions and horse radish and a hint of that spicy wasabi.\\n\\nSushi Tomi's Pork Tonkatsu Ramen Noodle soup bowl is heavenly...deep earthy flavors of pork soup and delicious slice of seaweed...\\n\\nMy fiancee, who is a bit of a futomaki (literally \\"large roll\\") connoisseur, loved her futomaki roll here. Rolled expertly and compact, the sushi was filled with delicious morsels of tamago (egg), pickled cucumber, kampyo, and other veggies. Really good tamago takes time and just the right balance of sweet and saltiness to it, and the tamago here is exceptional. She declared it the best futomaki roll in Orlando, and I would have to agree.\\n\\nOverall, I would definitely recommend Sushi Tomi if you enjoy really great Japanese food with simple, yet bold flavors - truly a taste of umami.

I (and many other customers) stood there as an employee yelled on the phone, to who I'm assuming was her friend, that she was going to 'cancel the Door Dash service' because they order too much food, aka, bring in business. I once watched every single employee in the restaurant - 5 total - stop what they were doing and debate whether or not to pour a dressing on a woman's salad that she originally asked for. Right in front of the customer I might add. On top of all of this, it has never taken less than 10 minutes (and this is no exaggeration) to literally pour a cup of soup.

My friend who recently banished himself to a life in the suburbs had been aching for me to come out to the hinterlands, so I came, I saw, and I ate...\\n\\n... and it was good. \\n\\nWe started with 2 apps, the saba (pickled mackerel) and the natto age (natto wrapped in shiso then deep fried). The mackerel was good. Nothing mind-blowing, but tasty. The natto age was heady and tasty, but a tad flat. The shiso lost some of its zing in the deep frying process, but haad a nice crispy texture, and the natto inside added a base fermented flavor to the flat, batter flavor from the frying. Both my dining partner and I found ourselves looking for some salt on the table, something it seems we shouldn't be needing for such a dish. While I was stoked to get natto (a rarity in PDX), it wasn't anything to write home from Beaverton about. \\n\\nFor the main, I scored the Kakuni Ramen and my associate the Chashyu Ramen. They seemed to be identical, but the Kakuni Ramen had added stewed pork belly. The broth was a cloudy, salty, rich, savory pork broth (shoyu is available as well on the Chashyu) over a pile of very well-made ramen noodles, some roast pork, some stewed pork belly, seaweed, pickled ginger, and green onion, and was served with a bowl of fresh garlic and sesame. The flavor of the pork belly is downright amazing, and while overwhelming in it's richness, it's a delight for the palate. Succulent, scrumptious, savory... the s-adjectives abound. Regardless, it was super soup (souper?). While not the best ramen I've ever had, it's by far the best I've had in Portland... as well it should be for $11 in a hole-in-the-wall out in Beaverton. \\n\\nThe rest of the fairly large menu offers numerous grilled, stir-fried and souped up options, but really from what I've read and heard and tried, I think the main goal of a trip to Yuzu is to try the ramen, which is quite awesome. \\n\\nAdd in some shochu (a nice extensive list), sake (again, great list) or Japanese beer, and you have yourself a quality meal. Were it not for the misses on the apps, this would easily be 5-stars... and maybe after I've had a few more bowls of this fantastic ramen, it will be. I still would like to see mo'better off the menu, because in this environment, $55 for 2 shochus, 2 bowls of ramen, a mackerel sashimi, and tiny natto age, is a lot to pay.

It was so strong you couldn't taste anything else besides the alcohol. Which, don't get me wrong, isn't always a bad thing when buying a drink, but it was just not enjoyable. I got the coconaut. It was on fire and SO fun when they brought it out (I really wanted a drink on fire and didn't realize that I ordered a drink that was going to be so I was thrilled when they brought it out... it was an awesome surprise).

Also, her cheese on her grilled cheese sandwich was barely melted and you could still clearly see the slices of cheese inside. Their chocolate chip cookies were pretty good, but that's where it ended. This was my first visit to a Zaxby's and I'm pretty sure it will be my last as well.

Wednesday night at Emmer & Rye was a delight. Sure the menu is a little pretentious and needs a dictionary, but good food is good food! \\n\\nFirst the setting: a little industrial, a little farmhouse, a little hipster, a little yuppie. You feel welcome immediately and I always love an open kitchen. Pro-tip - request a counter seat for the best view of the chefs.\\n\\nThe menu: Curated. Which is a nice way of saying small but it did seem well thought out. We heard that the cacio e pepe is a staple but just about everything else changes regularly. The \\"dim sum\\" cart has small bites and shared plates as well, so you should probably order 1 less item than you would otherwise if you plan to partake in the \\"cart\\" offerings. (Thank you State Bird Provisions for introducing this concept to the restaurant world outside of Chinese restaurants!)\\n\\nThe drinks: I had the shrub which was beet the day we happened to be there. It was less vinegary than others I've had and it was delicious. The wine selection is eclectic and (mostly) moderately priced. \\n\\nThe food: We ordered the following:\\nLabneh and roti: A. First of all, can I say how happy I am that labneh is finally getting its time to shine? If you haven't had it, it's basically a tart yogurt. Almost like sour cream but with a yogurt consistency. I liked the combination with the nutty pecan and buttery roti.\\nAvocado mole: A. It was creamy, it was rich, it had flavor, it had texture...what more is there to say? Comes with one giant tortilla which made it slightly harder to eat than individual tortillas, but then again I don't think it was meant to be eaten delicately.\\nCacio e pepe: A-. Seriously how do they get it so creamy? It was almost like a carbonara. So delicious and rich. May give you a heart attack. Worth it.\\nBlue crab: B. Not bad but not my favorite. Definitely more soupy than expected.\\nLamb neck: A+. I know what you're thinking which is that neck is weird. I promise you won't even know it's the neck. The meat is pull apart soft and whatever is on that toast I would order by itself. \\nBread: A+. I half wished we hadn't ordered this because it was large and filling and left us with no room for dessert. But it was REALLY good bread. Like AMAZING bread. They should open a bakery and just sell this bread.\\n\\nAnd had the following from the cart:\\nBeef tartare: I didn't have this one because being pregnant sucks. But it looked amazing, and my coworker made a face/noise that would probably be considered inappropriate in most workplaces. I believe she said she would come back for that bite alone.\\nConfit eggplant on foccacia: A+. Instead of the tartare I had this bite of eggplant on buttery foccacia. I would have been more upset about the tartare but this eggplant was bomb. SO good!\\nBlueberries in salted cream: B. It was pretty simple so I'd say skippable. Not that it was bad, just given how great the rest of the food was I would have preferred to save the space in my stomach.\\nCorn cakes: A-. If I hadn't eaten the same dish at Nancy's Hustle in Houston, I think it would be an A.

The crostini with kale, mushrooms, and ricotta was sooooo good. The salad was light and had delightful little flowers which made me wish my mom was with me as she loves eating flowers. The chicken was very tender and juicy, good flavor. The pizza was ok, the addition of the chili flakes, oregano, and Jacobsen salt was needed instead of just an enhancement. The chocolate budino was tasty and the white chocolate and lemon gelato was quite enjoyed. The check was brought out with two butter cookies which was a charming touch. \\nNothing awful about my experience but for all the hype of Renata, I expected so much more for everything. Service was probably the biggest let down, it wasn't overbearing but rather...lacking.

I've gone here with my girlfriend at least 6 times. I've never had a problem with the service or the manager, the staff has always been polite and prompt. The wait staff won't try to have a conversation with you or try to be your friend, they take your order and then bring it out as quickly as possible. If this is a problem, I would highly recommend going somewhere else. The first time I gone to this place with my girlfriend was on New Years Eve, the manager a tall elderly Caucasian gentleman who was very warm and welcoming. Because of this, we continue to come back.\\n\\nThe place is hidden and not the easiest to get to, but thanks to their big sign it's not a problem. Parking can be tough to find, but so far I haven't had any issues. I feel if they chose a different location, they would be more popular and do very well for themselves. The lightning can also be an issue for some as it is dim. Last time I went there, they hired a singer. Great idea, but it was a bit loud, I think hiring someone to play the piano or light jazz would be a bit better.\\n\\nThe food is delicious and taste authentic. I always get the red or green curry. The curry has a nice balance, all the flavors blend well together and you get a subtle sweet taste with it. I've also had the soft shell crab which is to die for. The thai curry at other restaurants around Boston is either too watery, the flavors don't balance well, or plain bad. The green tea fried ice cream is also a great dessert that they serve, highly recommend it!\\n\\nOverall, I believe Maekha Thai is the best thai restaurant in Boston, unless another Thai restaurant can prove me differently."},{"name":"Shabu & Mein","address":"148 1st St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"One of my new favorite foods is ramen.

The tables are lined with white linen, there's two round tables and literally 1 of them has a plastic foldable chair that you buy at Costco. It's eerily quiet, cold, and barren-feeling.

The menu has an extensive list of both savory and sweet options.  Ordered the chicken N waffles and Hillsboro huballoo.   The chicken was tender juicy crispy and waffle held up against the fried chicken. It wasn't saturated with grease or soggy.  The chipotle butter was so good and a drizzle of maple syrup made this dish 5 star.  Everything at Gigi's is high quality execution.  Seasoned potatoes were ok as a side item. A bit too much seasoning and had less of the soft hot potato texture without the crisp edges.   Hillsboro huballoo was very tasty. The sausage gravy over eggs, potatoes and bacon was rich but well balanced.  Overall a nice cafe for brunch, the chicken and waffles is far superior to screendoor or besaws (hands down Gigi's cafe is one of the best I've tried.  On a level with pinestreet biscuits or basilisk fried chicken quality)Something special about the Belgian waffle varieties here. They are thick and dense without being too fluffy or dry.

It's now nearly July. For 8 months I've been a regular at the Beaverton location, frequenting the establishment on average at least 4 days a week, but often times more than that. The biscuits and gravy were that addictively incredible. Because you can taste the real butter baked into a perfectly textured biscuit, as well as the real, rue-made gravy, I'd literally go out of my way to have them for breakfast or lunch as often as every day of the week. \\n\\nI've been having nothing but the \\"Hipster Bowl\\" at that frequency for the past 8 months. It was a perfect biscuit, covered and surrounded by gravy in a bowl, topped with a fried egg and strip of bacon. I would begin by breaking up the biscuit with a fork while eating the bacon off the top, and finish it all with a spoon to scrape up the last drop of gravy. \\n\\nImagine my surprise and utter disappointment, when I come in for my usual, and suddenly it's half the biscuit. I know very well how my fork used to break through the top of the biscuit and then the bottom as I crumbled it into the gravy as a matter of habit with literally dozens and dozens of Hipster Bowls throughout the past several months. The top of the biscuit used to sit just below the egg and you could see it. It was a complete biscuit, of that I am positive having had this dish for 8 months straight, and now they are slicing them in half and passing it off as the same. It's not nearly the same now, as with half the biscuit it is soupy and totally ruined. The slice of biscuit now sits well below the egg floating on top of the gravy, and when broken up into the gravy there is almost no biscuit to scoop up or taste.  The amazing texture is lost in the gravy and egg. To add insult to injury, they've also upped the price while providing less.\\n\\nWhen I ask about the portion change, they flat out lie and say that it's never been a whole biscuit. Again I repeat, my fork used to break through the top of the biscuit and then the bottom as I crumbled it into the gravy as a matter of habit with literally dozens and dozens of Hipster Bowls throughout the past several months. It was not a slice of one half before. I know without a shadow of doubt that it was in fact a whole biscuit, I know exactly how it used to fill the bowl and the gravy. Now it is not at all the same portion, but they've decided to charge more for less...and on top of that to outright lie about it to someone who's known this signature dish of theirs with the utmost intimacy. \\n\\nThey've lost the business of a loyal regular over this fiasco of suddenly unsatisfactory food and poor business ethics. Repricing something that was an incredible deal to begin with would have been completely acceptable, but they've ruined my favorite breakfast and decided they could lie to me about it.

Before our food came out a different server brought a try of salsa cups. The rude server came back with our food. He called out the name of each dish and asked who ordered what. My brother was in the process of serving himself a couple of the salsa cups from the plate and this man grabbed the plate, told my brother to \\"just take what he needs\\" and had the nerve to try and hank it from his hands. Did he not notice that we all ordered tacos and we would all be using the salsa? He never asked how anything was. Finally he dropped the bill on our table without asking if it was all together. There were four of us and we needed separate checks. I could not believe this man's reaction to such a simple request. He started to ask who ordered what again and you could see that he was very annoyed with having to deal with a very simple request. He was shaking his head and rolling his eyes. He came back with our checks, sat them on the end of the table and didn't say anything. We all then got up and went to the counter to pay for our bill so we could leave right away. I can't believe the way we were treated. We went into Dan's this morning expecting to have a pleasant breakfast and it was everything but that.

Bursting with flavour, tangy, sweet, quick, fresh, heaven in your mouth.\\n\\nThis is more of a lukewarm heaven, or that space between heaven and Hades, which is Noodle Box.\\n\\nIts not Asian, its \\"western Asian\\", all the true spices are muted down and the dishes engineered to come out assembly line predictable. Best example is like buying one of those Asian frozen dinners at Save On, they're good for a frozen dinner but you wouldn't invite anyone over for some.\\n\\nThe chicken satay is bland and the peanut sauce is a bastardized version of peanut sauce. The roti canai is pita bread, not the light flaky roti, and the curry sauce is a blend of  red curry and nothingness. The gyoza looked limp. I don't recommend any of the appetizers.\\n\\nThe meals. I think the best meal is the Nasi Goreng. It's fried rice, hard to go wrong with fried rice, or fried noodles. Which I am then saying, their noodles are OK too. Get one of the two, stay away from the curries. You'll get a hearty helping of noodles and rice, and generous with the protein. Flavours are decent, their spice chart is the best aspect, you actually can get spicy! I have tried everything down to their spiciest and for me I sit in the \\"hot\\" category which is pretty spicy for the average bear, so stay away.\\n\\nAll the Thai curries, I being from Thailand, are a bland version of Thai (ie they used the Thai curry paste and coconut milk but that's where the association with Thailand ends) mixed in with a bunch of things you would never find in a Thai curry. It comes like a big bowl of soup with rice noodles, hello? I can assure you no such dish exists.\\n\\nI dig the space, high ceilings, modern, bright and enough space not to be crowded and super casual. I love the concept of the fast food Asian, so want it to work, but its just not quite there yet. Truth is I should just open my own.

What a mind twist.\\n\\nSo, end result, its MacDonald's of Asian food, you go here, you know what you're going to get, its not really a burger but its good enough to fix the itch. Though at $13 a plate, its not cheap, you could get better Asian at a slew of restaurants for the same price, though not as quick and casual. \\n\\nPerfect for a lunch break meal or a place to get a casual bite with a close friend that won't judge you for your food tastes."},{"name":"Emmer & Rye","address":"51 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Came to brunch for their Emmer & Rye American Diner theme.

The portions were tiny, but the dish was good. It only went downhill from there.\\n\\nWe got the pork sausage pasta and it was ground pork drowned in butter. It tasted okay, but wasn't anything special. There was no wow factor to it, but it was edible, so that's a plus. The last thing we got was the Margherita pizza. It was not good. My dining partner, who LOVES pizza, mind you, was not impressed either. The sauce was decent, but the cheese tasted burnt as did the crust. I love Margherita pizzas, but this one, I could've done without.\\n\\nOnce the dessert menu came out, let me tell you--I'm not usually one to pass on dessert.

So let me start by saying this review has nothing to do with the food. Compared to other brunch buffets this one is pretty good. It's the customer service and the outside patio environment that ruined the entire experience. I booked this restaurant for a party of 14 two weeks prior. I made an initial reservation for 8 people and then called the restaurant the next day to change the party size. When speaking with the young lady she informs me for that party size I would need to change the reservation to 11:45 as opposed to my initial 11:15 slot. I tell her that's fine and before hanging up I confirm with her that my original reservation for 8 has been changed and updated she confirms. Come the day of the event we are running 5 mins late and I call the restaurant to see if that's an issue and to see if could hold our table. They say it's fine our table is waiting. Upon arrival I go to check in and the hostess (young girl short brown hair, green shirt) checks the reservation and says the reservation was cancelled due to no show. She tells me they tried to call the party and received no answer. I tell her I called the restaurant and they said it was no problem. She tells me and I quote \\"Well I don't know what to tell you\\". She then says we can find a spot for you but it will have to be outside on the patio. However I can clearly see the table that was reserved for us unoccupied and it remained that way for 2 hours. She leads us outside and shows us our table, which is dirty and you can clearly see that people were just sitting there. Furthermore, the table holds 6 ppl and I have a party of 14. She then grabs who I'm assuming is the manager. A young woman (brown hair in a braid, jeans and a black quarter sleeve button up) I tell her this table is not big enough for the party and she rudely stated \\"Well the reservation says 8 and I don't know what happened to the other one.\\" At this point she just storms off. She was utterly rude and disrespectful when it was the restaurants mix up from the beginning. As I mentioned prior I can still see the table for the party size I reserved roped off with my time and party size. I tell her that was our table and she says \\"No\\" and starts staring at her iPad. We ask for someone to clean our table and the waiter comes out and starts sweeping the crumbs directly onto us as if we're not sitting there. When he returns he throws the plates down on the table and drops all the loose silverware on top. 3 different homeless people came beginning for food and utterly just made the entire experience uncomfortable and awful. Our two waiters were the only saving grace as they tried to make the most of out the situation for us. Upon leaving the table that was booked for my party finally became occupied at 2:30 Which was 2+ hours after our reservation started, so no one was waiting on it. I'm not sure of the reason for the hostess' hostility and rudeness but it made a lasting negative impact and I will continue to tell people of the awful customer service I received."},{"name":"Toppings Pizza Lounge","address":"495 Whitehall St SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"awesome food and service for sure coming back"},{"name":"Yuu Japanese Tapas","address":"1118 - 3779 Sexsmith Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"This is a Chinese owned Japanese restaurant, so it's not authentic Japanese flavours but the food is still good.

When someone finally came up to the counter they looked at me as if I was ab to be placing an order five minutes before they were going to close. no one was eating there as normal and no employees appeared busy doing anything (also normal) so i assumed they'd know why i was there but as soon as i said i was here for a pick up, I could tell by the look on the employees face that my pizza was not ready to be picked up. and for second time picking ip an order, i was told i was probably at the wrong location or that i had ordered from a different pizza restaurant all together.I gave my name and then play looked at the computer screen fidgeted nervously for a second and said \\"oh uh k wait um yeah just um give us liiiiiike 5 no no sev seven minutes\\" It was frustrating hearing this because I didn't want to call the employee out on forgetting the order, I know what that's like it happens but I also didn't want some shit pizza thrown together in a hurry just so no one gets in trouble.\\nI stepped outside to wait for the pizza despite it being hot out.

We went again last night for dinner and were very disappointed. The service pace and timing were very off. Our waiter greeted and took our drink order, He came back in a few minutes and told us what the dinner specials were so we took that t mean he was ready to take our order. There was a walleye special and a NY Strip special not on the menu and we ordered one of each special. My dining partner's soup came out in a few minutes and still no drinks. His soup is now finished and still no drinks. Finally cocktails arrive.  Dinner comes in a few more minutes. The walleye was tasty with a nice presentation and cooked well but the sides were all very under seasoned. My Steak was cooked properly and had a nice presentation. The crab cake was very herby and had virtually no crab in it. I enjoyed the taste but was disappointed by the lack of crab taste. The Steak was absolutely awful. it was extremely tough and leathery and had a great deal of fat and gristle that I had to trim away at the table. Cutting and trimming the steak should have been done in the kitchen. The cheap quality of the meat is simply not excusable. Their Facebook page talked about a 50% off promo which we were happy to learn about since we were going there anyway, It turned out to be lottery sort of thing so we only got a 15% discount, which was still nice but not what we had hoped. Oddly I had just had steak the day before at Applebee's which was much better quality and it was $15.99. To my horror the NY Strip special which was not on the menu, so I didn't even know the price of when I ordered, turned out to be $47.00. which was about 50% higher than most other entree's on their menu. In my opinion when you are an upscale establishment and you promote a special, especially at a premium price-point it has to be flawless and this unfortunately was not even close. Very disappointed."},{"name":"Hill's Cafe","address":"3600 Presidential Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"2","text":"I've heard they stick it to you at the airport. Well, hills cafe is them.

I have seen SO many outrageous things here and I am always amazed. From men playing shovels like guitars to T Rex's getting nude..... you will almost always have fun here. I feel like sometimes they overcharge you for drinks, depending on the bartender and I don't love that their wine is boxed.

As in, no one is assigned to wait on our table, someone dropped off the wrong food, our food showed up 40 minutes after we ordered, no one checked in on us, couldn't find anyone to get me another beer, took literally 20 minutes to get the check after we were clearly done and desperately trying to get ANYONE'S attention to be able to leave. And it wasn't just because they were slammed, because a similar situation happened fairly early on a Tuesday when they weren't particularly busy. Once, we got a free dessert, but then after delivering the (admittedly delicious) fried Mars bar, our waiter disappeared into the ether yet again, and we, again, couldn't get the check to save our lives. \\n\\nThe food is really good- the fish supper is my standby and I really do think it's pretty exceptional. The rotating seasonal vegetarian entree is also good and surprisingly interesting for a place that obviously specializes in things involving meat (thank you for that!).  The portion size of the fish, however, has ranged from surprisingly tiny to the sort of small-but-adequate portions you usually see in fine dining restaurants.  And the side of minty mushy peas is so unusual and delicious, it really would be nice to get a bit more of that on the plate to complement the salty fish & chips.\\n\\nI could mostly forgive the service and portion sizes if this place were cheap or moderately priced.

We live nearby and my parents came in town this particular weekend, they don't live in Atlanta so when they come to town we like to take them out to dinner, we wanted to do something semi casual so we chose MidiCi.   I told them how good it was etc but was embarrassed and will not return after what happened.  This was the weekend of June 22.  We walked in a few tables were there, no one greeted us at first and eventually a hostess came by and sat us.   When we sat down the table near ours was dirty and there was a watered down cocktail in a clear plastic cup on the window sill next to our table.  Our waiter told us he was new when my husband ordered Dr Pepper and he said he didn't know if they had it, my mom asked about a pizza on the menu and he didn't have much insight or suggestions.  Honestly none of this was that big deal just a few small hiccups.  When we ordered  my dad, husband and I all got the same thing except I added extra cheese and ricotta to my pizza,  after a VERY long wait with now only one other table at the restaurant two of the pizzas came out.   My husband was handed his and I was handed mine and told here's the one with extra cheese but there was no ricotta or any extra cheese  so I chalked it up as him being new and just got over it.  We sat and waited and waited and waited for my parents pizzas.  We also had been waiting on a cocktail that never came out as well.  The place was empty our waiter was just hanging out and talking to another waitress and then others were starting to clean up and yet here we sat w two missing pizzas, and empty drinks.  My mom finally got tired of waiting and walked up to the bar to ask where the other two pizzas were.   About 10 mins later they came out, as if they had just made them because they were super hot and fresh, my husband and I at this point had already finished eating.  My moms was pretty undercooked so she only ate one piece which is frustrating considering she had already waited that long.  We saw a group of 6 walk in 45 mins before their posted closing time, they were also not greeted so they walked towards the dining area and asked to be seated, they were turned away and told \\"were closing\\"  I saw them question it considering it was still open for 45 more mins but again were turned away so they left.   We got our check which they kindly took off the two late pizzas which I appreciate.   However the terrible service, late pizzas,  forgotten toppings, undercooked pizza and watching them seem to be more worried more about closing and getting out of there instead of checking on us to realize we waited almost a good 40 mins for missing food and then seeing them turn down business 45 mins before closing turned me away from wanting to come back.   I feel bad I talked this place up to them and wasted a night out to eat in Atlanta on this place.

This with three scoops of protein, along with a variety of add ins. I choose spicy tuna, tuna, and salmon, and they give a generous amount! They have their own house bled of their version of \\"spicy mayo.\\" It's a must try! I always go back for more sauce. You can even ask for some on the side. They also have an avocado creme sauce which I liked. The aesthetic of the place is very island themed, it has a nice vibe.

Everything was amazing but my favorite was the cannelle. Perfectly cooked, with the caramelized texture on the outside and soft eggy inside. The kouign aman was incredible too, but a little different than the ones I've had other places. Definitely a good different. I loved the fleur de sel they put on top, great way to cut the sweetness. The croissant was as perfect as they get stateside.\\n\\nThe vibe is busy and vibrant. They were very accommodating when my toddler threw a tantrum and I suddenly needed to box up some things.

They do not have the stamp card here. Their ordering sign can only show 5 numbers and it's not updated regularly so make sure you stay close by to hear the meek call outs (we waited almost 20 minutes for an order that seems to be ready a while ago but not displayed in screen). When you do get your order, double check what you get because they will give you something different.  We ordered milk tea but got lemon tea and no bubble waffles despite the receipt stated that . The bubble waffles are also made ahead of the order, looks burnt and cold. This is despite they have 6 people hanging around behind the still.., would have thought they put more efforts getting the order right and putting regular updates on order board.

I rely on Yelp often for consumer opinions before making a dining choice.  This one really backfired.  First of all, chicken is my go to meal of choice, so I ordered the 1/2 chicken dinner.  Not only did it taste like ham, but it was the saltiest food I'd ever eaten in my entire life.  As if a whole shaker of salt was used on my dinner alone.  Ridiculous this day in age when many restaurants are being chastised for NOT being health conscious.  I had two bites and just couldn't stomach it so I switched out my dinner for pulled chicken at the waiter's suggestion.  Mind you, I didn't think I've ever sent a meal back except for maybe a piece of steak that was undercooked and definitely not because it was soooo salty.  Anyway, the pulled chicken was slightly less salty but still not very appetizing.  In fact, the whole meal seemed compromised to me...too much salt, too much butter and wayyyyy too much fat on the brisket (which is what my boyfriend ordered).  Nothing tasted like food.  What a shame.  Anyway, my boyfriend wound up horridly sick in the middle of the night.  In short, this place is overpriced and the food is overly seasoned and just overall 'eh at best.  The waiter knew I was disappointed, he was pleasant enough and understanding...probably the best part of the whole evening.  At a minimum, I was expecting to NOT be charged for my meal but surprisingly we were.  $70 later and one sick boyfriend in the middle of the night pretty much guarantees we won't be back.

The fact that Baldwin Landing is an old Colonial estate makes the individual rooms kind of bee-hivey, which makes it hard for servers to keep an eye on tables.  We got drinks and ordered apps right away, but no one checked back on us and it was some time after we'd finished the apps before the waitress came back to take our entree order. \\n\\nHere's what warranted my 3 star rating (and I could go lower):  one of our apps was the cold rabbit with chili vinaigrette.  I eat rabbit frequently.  I know it's generally boney, but when I eat it in a restaurant, it's been cleaned and de-boned...this appetizer, though flavorful, was completely off-putting because of the bones that were attached to the diced rabbit.  Nowhere on the menu did it mention this, nor did the waitress point it out.  I don't know how everyone else's choppers would hold up, but crunching on chopped bones was NOT the culinary experience I was hoping for.  We fished out the peanuts and scallions, the only things that remained boneless.  We mentioned this and the waitress said, \\"Oh, I didn't mention the bones?\\".  Um, no, you didn't mention that dentistry would be required to consume this dish.  I really expected to be comped for the appetizer or at east switch it out for something we could eat, since 90% of it was left in its dish."},{"name":"Wine 4 Oysters","address":"1957 S Alafaya Trl","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"For several years now, my wife and I have always used Yelp to find cool, interesting, and awesome places.

In the meantime, since CBC is located in a pretty large outdoor mall/plaza, we walked across the way to a Jewish delicatessen and shared a sandwich. Once our buzzer went off, the party began! My fiance and I ordered 6 sour samples, each at $3.50. We also ordered a barley wine and a sake beer variant. Both had pretty high abv and were interesting experiences to try. I don't think I was as into them as I had expected to be. Not sure if I want a sake flavor to my beer. Anyway, my fiance enjoyed it. We couldn't get sample sizes of those beers unfortunately, since that deal was only for the sours event. Overall, fun experience. We also got the nachos with pulled pork. Really tasty but had to leave most of the bottom nachos since they were not covered in any toppings. Still worth it for 12 bucks.

I forgot the name, since it's been a while. But for the price and quality of food, I wanted to see if Los Hermano's compares. \\n\\nComing in around 8pm-ish, the restaurant was half full in it's L shaped design. The bar portion of the restaurant had a large party that took over 2 long tables, but we were kindly greeted and seated right away. All the tables along the wall were taken so were seated along the middle, and facing the kitchen. My friend made me change seats with her since she hates looking into the kitchen as well as facing where the front door is. She's a bit shy sorta speak. \\n\\nService starting off was great, even though I couldn't understand/hear what our server's name was as he introduced him self in a heavy, low accent. The receipt shows it as \\"Server name: 291 Nacho\\". As we were sat down a bowl of chips and salsa was placed on a table as well as our drink order taken. \\n\\nAfter just deciding to order waters from drinking coke all day, and explaining to my friend from the reviews of the so called margaritas, we surveyed the menu of something filling but not expensive since we were only half hungry. I decided on the Asada Burrito with the green tomatillo sauce on the side. And my friend ordered the Shrimp corn chowder bowl size and a fish taco. The soup came quite quickly after the server entered the order into the computer system, It was pleasantly good, I would say better then average. The shrimp's were not as many, and quite small. The chowder itself was a surprise as it  did have a hint sweet before taste and a mild spicy kick at the end, quite tasty. Our dinner came no later then 2-3 minutes after the soup. We decided to share bites with each others' meals, the fish taco's seemed to be deep fried which left me disappointed since I favor grilled fish taco's instead and the sauce seemed to be just made out of tartar sauce and lime, but were quite good and not greasy. The onions are where the real flavor is at though, very spicy for my taste but added the needed flavor that was missing. The asada in my burrito first started out dry in the first bites but after my friend took her share, she noted that it was quite moist and seasoned. I'm guessing they first filled it was some left over meat that didn't complete an order before a new batch? The black beans were of the usual fair, the rice was light on taste but made with a blend of steamed carrots to add to the flavor. \\n\\nWe were both to stuffed to try for desert. I'm hoping to come more hungry in the next visit as I'm anxious to try their Tres Leches cake. \\n\\nThe total came to about $16.85 before tax and tip. So overall the prices are just a smidge higher then your usual tex mex but service is top notch and I know some of their better selections would let me rate them 5 stars.

Of those that I have visited so far, Yakuza seems to be among the best. While I enjoy the very traditional versions, I really enjoy the Asian Fusion concept that Yakuza showcases.\\n\\nTypically I have a problem with the rotating menu and not being updated on the website right away. But Asian food is usually safe, right up until I get served Sea Urchin, so I let that slide. The menu posted on their site is about 50% right though, they have a few of the more popular items all the time with a smaller selection of rotating items.\\n\\nDrinks were a very nice dry sake, and the \\"Honey Cube.\\" Both were excellent although I wanted to eat the honey infused ice cube in the Honey Cube. The Honey Cube is a bourbon based drink that can get you fast, while the sake was a generous portion that can also get you fast if you're not careful. \\n\\nOur plates were the Yakuza Burger, the Jicama Salad (both on the menu as standard,) and the Kimchi and the kabocha. Of all of these, the Yakuza burger was possibly the least interesting. Not to say it was bad, just the rest of the food was that good. \\n\\nThe burger looks small but is a very thick patty coupled with a thick bun that you need to either eat sideways or deconstruct. I couldn't taste the spicy mayo over the shoestring potatoes, but the catsup added a nice occasional sweet bite to the over all burger. The meat itself seems like it had a hint of teriyaki flavor in it. Over all, not the best burger in town, but definitely something I'd come back for.\\n\\nThe Jicama salad was also good. The dressing is a bit on the spicy side which is nice because jicama has such a mild flavor normally. \\n\\nIf you have not had a chance to try the kabocha, go now! This is large pieces of kabocha, tempura battered and fried. It's then drizzled with a honey ginger and chili glaze that is also served on the side. It's sweet, and then spicy, and then savory all in the same bite. \\n\\nThe star of the meal was the kimchi. Take spicy kimchi, batter the pieces and deep fry. Serve with anchovy lime aioli on the side. This was absolutely awesome. I will definitely be going back for just a serving or six of this. The kimchi pieces were also very good with the honey ginger chili glaze from the kabocha dish.\\n\\nThe only negative, and a minor one, was that the service was a bit off. Nothing major but they didn't seem to be busy enough to justify water glasses being empty or the length of time before neighboring tables got to order their food.

The first time we stumbled across it, their kitchen had just closed and we needed dinner (it was 11pm, we'd just flown in from Seattle). The gal at the front was sassy and funny, so we came back earlier the next night, to try it.\\n\\nThe guy at the counter was genuinely UK, and casual but good with the service. There were a few other people there at the bar, and it was very quiet. The decor was decidedly Britpub, with football and rugby everything. The menu was limited, but also pretty British. They have a decent beer selection, but your standard supermarket beers, nothing new or exciting (I'm bummed out they had Guinness, not Beamish). \\n\\nThe food, sadly, was incredibly disappointing. Maybe it'd be kinder to say it was typical pub food, except when I was in London eating at pubs I'm pretty sure it didn't taste like a microwave meal. My meat pie was doughy, the top popped off to reveal what looked like Alpo (and was basically flavorless) and the whole thing was lukewarm.

I've tried it a few times and it always makes me gag, even the mundane California rolls.\\n\\nBut, my daughter really wanted sushi for her birthday dinner so I decided to take the family to Yakuza Lounge which offers other small plates, including a burger that a friend of mine told me is one of the best in the area.\\n\\nThe restaurant is located in a trendy dining area of Portland on 30th and Killingsworth. It's a nice open space with communal tables and chic, Japanese-inspired decor. The murals on the walls are particularly beautiful.\\n\\nThere were 5 of us in the party so we ordered a number of plates to share, including 2 salads (kale and radicchio), edamame, scallop tempura, smoked mussels, 3 different sushi rolls (Yakuza, negi sake, and spicy tuna), the pan seared salmon, and, of course, the burger.\\n\\nNow you might think this is a lot of food for 5 people -- I certainly did -- but it wasn't. The servings are exceedingly small in some cases. We left satisfied, but not stuffed and no leftovers.\\n\\nThe salads were delicious, I especially loved the radicchio salad which was tossed with a tasty sweet soy dressing. The radicchio was crisp and not bitter, like it often can be. The flavors were very well balanced.\\n\\nThe scallop tempura was absolutely divine. The large, fresh scallops are wrapped in shredded filo then fried up, so not the traditional tempura batter that I was expecting yet even tastier. The presentation was beautiful with the pools of spicy sauce underneath and the dark shreds of nori scattered about. The small plate of tempura for $6, though, was really just 1 scallop, so 1 bite for 1 person. We had to order 5 for everyone to have one.\\n\\nThe smoked mussels and sushi rolls were beautifully presented; the Yakuza roll stuffed with tempura butternut squash, shishito pepper, and asparagus was especially inventive. The sushi was rolled tight and didn't fall apart when dipping it in sauce or eating it.\\n\\n\\nI was disappointed in the pan seared salmon. While the salmon was nice and fatty and cooked perfectly, it was a small piece of approximately 1ÔøΩ?x 2ÔøΩ? Just look at the size of the salmon compared to the garlic clove or micro green garnish; it seemed to have more garnish than salmon. I had ordered this plate for my main since most of the group was eating sushi. It was delicious, but too small for the price and not enough for a main dish or even enough to share as an appetizer.\\n\\nOf course the Yakuza Burger went to my burger loving boyfriend, who always lets me try his food. It was a good size with a 1/2 pound beef patty that was cooked to order (medium rare). The burger was juicy and delicious but did not live up to the hype for me. There were so few truffled shoestring potatoes on the burger that they could barely be tasted, certainly not the stack that is seen in Yakuza's own promotional photos nor the presentation. And the bun was too thick which masked the overall flavor with entirely too much bread. Definitely not one of the best burgers I've had.\\n\\nOverall, I had a mixed experience with Yakuza Lounge. While much of the food was delicious and I would certainly eat it again, others were a miss and the servings were too small for the prices. On the plus side, service was fantastic and the speed was right on target.\\n\\nTaste 6/10\\nTexture 7/10\\nPresentation 7/10\\nAtmosphere 5/10\\nStaff knowledge and attentiveness 10/10\\nSpeed of Service 10/10\\nOverall 45/60"},{"name":"Brookline Lunch","address":"9 Brookline St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"their food tastes great, BUT, their sanitation SUCKS.

The table side guacamole with everything lacked the herby flavor of cilantro, instead there was too much lime flavor. I had Al Pastor tacos in what was supposed to be a soft corn tortilla.

We came on a Saturday night around 9:15 pm, and there were only a few other tables occupied.\\n\\nThey have a fairly extensive menu, but my eyes were drawn to their seasonal ramen, which is the volcano ramen. You can choose to get it with either AAA beef or jumbo clams and prawn for $19.50. I went with the seafood version. \\n\\nYes, it's a bit pricy, but the presentation was quite interesting. They bring the ramen out in a sizzling stone bowl with everything except the soup. They then pour in the boiling hot tonkotsu broth and you can hear it sizzle in the bowl. They cover the bowl up and come back in a couple minutes to uncover it and let you know that it's ready for you to eat! It's quite fun to order and go through this whole experience.\\n\\nThe tonkotsu broth was very rich and flavorful. I actually think it's the best tonkotsu broth I've had in years, since my last trip to Japan. I'm actually drooling slightly as I write this review and remember how delicous that broth was. The jumbo prawns and clams were good as well, if a bit on the bland side, but it was a lot of work to peel the shrimp. I also had to de-vein the shrimp myself. You'd think the restaurant would have done that for you. Next time I think I'll stick to the beef version.\\n\\nMy friend got the chicken and tomato ramen ($13.95), and that was also really good, especially if you like tomato soup. The chicken that comes with it is served on the side, so I tried a couple pieces and it was well flavored with really crispy skin.\\n\\nWe also ordered a potato croquette appetizer ($5.95).

I write a lot of reviews but probably wouldn't have written this one if not for one exceptional thing that I noticed. \\n\\nSo, for many, many years now, I've complained at fast food restaurants that they should have a list of the sauces they offer for chicken nuggets. Put it on the menu, make a sign, make a display, I don't give a damn, but stop making me ask what flavors you have, and stop making the cashier try to remember them all.

I'm sure you can walk in without reservations during the low season but be sure to make them during the 'free dining' season, tables go fast! BTW, they do have a dress code but it does not seem to be strictly enforced. I came in with a sundress and cardigan and the BF wore a v-neck and plaid shorts. \\n\\nThe BF was a bit worried when I mentioned that the food was African/Indian/Mediterranean inspired but he ended up loving it! For appetizers we got the seasonal sweet corn bisque and curried beef rolls. I loved my bisque, not too sweet and perfectly balanced with lump crab and crunchy bits of celery. Best soap I ever had! I'm drooling just thinking about it now, hah. The beef rolls looked like tiny eggrolls served with a slaw that was quite delicious together. The BF ended up eating everything which was interesting cause he usually hates slaw.\\n\\nWe got the oak-grilled filet mignon and the seared barbered duck breast entrees, both were delicious. The filet was cooked perfectly, tender and juicy. I really enjoyed the mac and cheese which was rich, not too saucy and worked well with the filet and wine sauce. BF said the duck was the best he ever had and ate up the whole plate.\\n\\nDesserts were ok, I got the celebration special which was an apricot sorbet and cake and the BF got the spiced cake. Both weren't memorable like the other 'signature' restaurant desserts.\\n\\nOverall the restaurant was great; exotic flavors, delicious, intimate ambiance, and great service. Our server Michelle was wonderful, very nice and helpful. She informed us of the popular and personal favorites on the menu.

She was still walking around this restaurant as if it was huge. She finally seated us. We were given 4 waters with no ice. Basically warm water. We see the party of 2 directly across from us with ice filled water. We finally get to order, and decided to do the option C of AYCE. We started off with the galbi, their Toji sauce galbi and a few others on the menu. Absolutely horrendous. The meat was hard and chewy and was overly salted. The side dishes were terrible. The kimchi tasted like just cabbage, the pickled cucumbers were soft and just tasted like cucumbers, all of the sides were plain tasting. Previous to my other reviews \\"if the side dishes are not good, 100% the food will not be either.\\"\\n\\nWe ordered their \\"pitcher\\" of soju. Literally it was just a glass they called a pitcher.

She said she'll bring a glass full of ice for us. We asked for more potatoes from the side dishes, she said they ran out and she'll bring some when they have more, which was about 30 minutes later, after asking 3 more times. \\n\\nWe had the shrimp and scallops. The scallops were frozen and the shrimps were NOT deveined. We asked for the grill to be swapped out as most KBBQs do it without us asking.

It looks peppery with small chunks of cheese rather than creamy macaroni, but still delicious. \\n\\nMy coworkers ordered a potato with pulled pork, bacon, broccoli, cheese, and sour cream.

They also have a dim sum offerings.  It is all small plates that are meant to be shared.  We ordered a few things from the starters - polenta dish, porridge and the mackerel.  The polenta was different, but in a good way.  Usually polenta that I've had is more firm and this reminded me more of grits, which I actually loved.  I was not a fan of the porridge and oats dish.  It was a bit salty for me, but we did express this to our waiter as they asked what we thought.  They made up for the salty dish later in the meal for sure.  My favorite starter was surprisingly the mackerel.  It was super fishy, but I was into it and I loved the pickled tomato seeds with it.\\n\\nDim sum started making it's way around and we got a few more small plates from this.  The johnny cakes, cauliflower and short ribs all came off of dim sum. The cauliflower was so simple but one of my favorite things the whole meal.  The johnny cakes and short ribs were both excellent too.  The fat on the short rib was literally like butter!  Oh and the bread that came in the tin with the short rib was amazing!  I really enjoyed seeing the dishes come around on dim sum and then deciding if I wanted to indulge.  We also ordered a pasta dish - I can not remember the name of, but it was a grain pasta with lamb shoulder in it. \\n\\nLast - dessert!  Don't skip it.  First we were served a complimentary dessert wine on the house, which was so nice.  Then we ordered the tres leches cheesecake and OMG it was perfection!  I never would have thought to pair tres leches and cheesecake together, but when you think about it... it just makes sense!  I loved every bite of it. \\n\\nI think Emmer and Rye definitely has a good thing started here.  I'm absolutely part of their new fan base!  The service was awesome all around!  They have been open for almost a week now and I am sure they are only getting started!  I look forward to trying them again after they are definitely in their groove."},{"name":"Greenleaf Juicing Company","address":"810 NW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I love Greenleaf.

I mean, for years/ever, this Safeway location has been OFF-THE-HOOK. \\n\\nGranted there have been ever-so-slight improvements from, say, 8+ years ago when patronizing this location was a potentially life-threatening experience, but save for not feeling like I might seriously get mugged in the parking lot as much (still a ton of geeked-out/tweeked-out locals lurking, and the front entrance is usually a scene of sorts, with mobs of angry mutants flooding in and out), the improvements have been modest, no, MEAGER at best, and that's coming from a historical perspective. This place has ALWAYS been horrendous. It's almost like because this Safeway has ALWAYS been revolting, there's a sense of duty to make sure this Safeway forever remains a spectacle of human suffering.\\n\\nI prepare/brace myself for endurance by making sure I'm equipped with a pair of headphones and an upbeat \\"I'm okay with whatever happens in life right now\\" attitude, 'cause if I don't have those two things, I end up being subsumed with HATE, LOATHING, and/or HOMICIDAL THOUGHTS. Look, I'm just being real, and if you've visited/patronized this location, you would have likely felt one-or-more of those emotions. I don't like feeling those feelings, and I try to avoid things that compel or bring forth those feelings. But sometimes the urge for pizza or imperative for coffee is heavy enough to outweigh the certain pain that the Safeway experience will likely unleash...\\n\\n...or not, like today when I waited for only about 4 minutes (for some gawd-forsaken reason the self-check-outs were closed) before I politely vacated my place in line, put my items back in their respective shelf spots, and promptly left, opting instead to walk elsewhere to buy coffee, and to order pizza. Though walking elsewhere took more time and energy, and the pizza I ordered was much-more expensive than the pizza I was aiming to purchase at Safeway, the pain wasn't worth it. I could see in those 4 minutes I waited that the whole ordeal was likely to take 30+ minutes. In utterly-typical Safeway fashion, it was a bad scene, almost like a horror scene. So yeah, paying 3x the money to avoid the trauma of Safeway was totally worth it."},{"name":"Dharma Kitchen","address":"3667 Broadway West","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"OH MY! No... Just no. \\n\\nMy friend and I stopped here for lunch one day. It was super dead. I wondered why at first... now I know. \\n\\nThe server was very friendly. Really friendly. Topping up your water every few minutes friendly. I didn't mind because I'm a guzzler with my water at restaurants, and they're short glasses... but maybe some people wouldn't like that. \\n\\nWe didn't want anything else to drink, but he brought us a little sample of chai to try. I don't really like tea, and I hate coffee. Hate... But this chai was good, and I actually thought well I can probably drink it's cuz there's no dairy in it either.  It was really good. So I would say the chai is best thing about our experience here. \\n\\nMy friend ordered the tempeh burger with roasted potatoes, and I ordered the dharma dude bowl. \\n\\nI had asked what was in the dressings, but could not get an answer if all the dressings had oil in it. I can't stand salads with nuts, avocado and oil all over it. It's really too much concentrated fat for a small bowl of lettuce.  \\n\\nBut all he said was \\"Everything on the menu is healthy\\".  I just kinda laughed inside.  Healthy is relative. If you eat too much of anything that in itself can be unhealthy... so that's why I wanted to know if all their salads were just oily salads. Essential fatty acids are good, too many calories from fat is not good. You know what I mean?\\n\\nSo we waited for a while and then our food came out. The tempeh I got on my bowl, was the same as the burger patty.  It looked and tasted like a burger patty.  It was all right.  Definitely the most flavourful thing in the dish.  The rest was just plain steamed veg, with an oily mild gravy and some COLD slightly reheated potato rounds. \\n\\nThe potatoes on my friend's plate were the same too. \\n\\nWe felt cheated, like everything on the menu is the exact same stuff presented in different combinations... and this is not a good thing. \\n\\nIt all tasted like blah.  \\n\\nNow if you're vegetarian or vegan, don't you generally know some tasty recipes for veg bowls and stir fries? You'd think right. \\n\\nCuz this is probably the worst blah tasting vegan food I've had in Vancouver. \\n\\nI create healthy low fat vegan recipes for my business. I KNOW how to do healthy and flavourful.  But this kitchen doesn't get it. Even without garlic and onions, you can still make stuff flavourful, and not have it just be barely reheated and tossed together.\\n\\nI have to say that I have no desire to come back because I'd rather pay $14 for something tasty at an Omni restaurant.  It's a shame because the place looks nice and warm inside, but the food is what is driving customers away. \\n\\nWhen you're dead all the time, it's the food or the price.

It used to be a sizable nationwide chain of drive-in restaurants, but its numbers have severely dwindled over the decades.  Now, only a handful remain.  They aren't so much drive-ins anymore, but rather old fast food restaurants.  This location on Piedmont Rd. is currently the oldest surviving Zesto in Atlanta -- since 1955 according to a sign inside the restaurant (the Zesto brand was founded in the 1940s).  Other popular locations can be found on Ponce De Leon and in Little Five Points.\\n\\nZesto is known for its ice cream and that's all I've ever had at a Zesto.  The company originally competed against Dairy Queen and, like DQ, expanded its menu to serve burgers and hot dogs.  The double-patty \\"Chubby Decker\\" is their Big Mac/Whopper equivalent.  They also serve tacos, burritos, and quesadillas.\\n\\nAll the Zestos I've been to or seen in Atlanta look old and worn down.  This Piedmont location is no exception.  It does have an old school 1950s drive-in/diner look and feel, which is kind of neat, but also makes it feel extremely dated.  It resembles a long lost brother of Dairy Queen.  Small booths and chairs, even some counter seating.  Relive the 1950s by ordering a milkshake and sipping on it at the counter.  There is fenced-in outdoor seating and a small TV inside for your viewing pleasure.\\n\\nMenus, with helpful pictures, are posted on the wall behind and next to the ordering counter.  When it comes to ice cream, all the classic American favorites are there from simple cones/cups to sundaes and banana splits.  The ice cream is soft-served out of machines.  The Arctic Swirls ($3.35 each) are damn good.  Smooth, creamy, and utterly satisfying.  They're essentially the same as the DQ Blizzard or McDonald's McFlurry.  Unlike the latter, Zesto's Arctic Swirls do not come in different sizes.  However, there are more flavor options such as Oreo, Snickers, M&M'S, Butterfinger, Mint Oreo, and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.  My favorite: Oreo.\\n\\nService is good.  Shout-out to Vernitha.\\n\\nIf you live in Atlanta and have never been to a Zesto, you should go at least once.  Who knows how much longer they will be around?"},{"name":"ReelHouse Marina Bay","address":"542 Victory Rd","city":"Quincy","stars":"3.5","text":"Amazing food & bloody Marys.

The cocktails seemed a bit weak and watery, but I enjoyed their wine selection after that.\\n\\nThe thing that almost ruined the experience for me was being sat next to the server station in the side of the dinning room. Our table was jammed up against a short wall where several staff at a time might come up to process payments or grab supplies.

The waitresses working were really nice and when we arrived we had to wait which we expected and the hostess gave us a time frame for waiting and that ended up being very accurate. I appreciated that! The service was good, the ladies working were very nice. Our waitress in particular was personable and attentive.\\n\\nI went in really wanting the coffee rubbed pork belly, but it had been changed (as I mentioned I only looked at the yelp menu and not the one on the website which was updated.) Instead it was changed to a coffee b√©arnaise sauce.. which I decided to try.. seemed interesting. It was off putting and I didn't enjoy it so I ordered the regular b√©arnaise. We both ordered our Benedict's poached medium but they both came out so soft. My bestie was too hungry to say anything so she started to eat hers and didn't say anything, but the white part wasn't even cooked and that weirds me out so I had to say something. She took it back and it did take quite a while to come back out and when it did it was poached hard. When she quality checked she acknowledged that and apologized she said they just wanted to make sure it wasn't runny. Which I can appreciate that, however, I would have originally asked for hard if that's what I wanted. Anyways, I appreciate how she dealt with the small situation for sure, very well handled. I'm just left confused with the chefs as that just doesn't make any sense to me. For a breakfast place if the egg isn't done right the first time, sure that's fine it happens .. but the second time? \\nI did like the root vegetables on the plate, though they were a little undercooked but still fresh and good. The house made leek sausage was nice but I was over the flavours after a couple of bites.. it was very one note.

We rarely eat here, but it happened to be one of the places that didn't have a line snaking around the restaurant in the drive-thru, so we gave it a go.\\n\\nThe bacon and cheese burger lacked flavor, and it was loaded with your typical condiments, the meat patty, pickles, and onions, the last two which were the only things I could taste. For a burger that advertised cheese, I looked everywhere on the bun and couldn't locate it. And because a simple fast food experience shouldn't equate to a Highlights magazine Hidden Pictures game in trying to find one of the main ingredients, that burger was easily the most forgettable I've ever had.\\n\\nGoing from flavorless to flaccid, the fries were as limp as a failed erection waiting on Viagra to kick in. I picked one up to feed to my boyfriend while he drove, and it almost broke in half. There was no crunch factor, the salt was overwhelming, and no, the angels did not materialize from the taste buds of bliss to signal love at first taste. This most definitely was anything but a French fry love affair, and yes, I do judge fast food places on the quality of fries. \\n\\nSo now we've covered flavorless, flaccid, and now we're at flat. Upon the first sip, the Dr. Pepper tasted sweet, as if the syrup was newly added. Five sips later, it's about as weak as a flatline. There was no life whatsoever in the soda, probably because the excess of ice watered down the flavor. Regardless, I poured it down the sink before I drunk even half. \\n\\nMediocre was the service, but then again, I don't dine anywhere for the service. It's not like I can digest a bad attitude or a friendly server and say I got what I paid for. For drive-thrus, service is immaterial. \\n\\nSo now I've covered the three F's of Whataburger and will be sticking to the A list of fast food restaurants."},{"name":"Panera Bread","address":"555 S State St","city":"Westerville","stars":"2.5","text":"Came here for a lunch with co worker and haven't been in quite some time.

Apparently they're down 30% in sales due to the traffic problems Chick-fil-A has created.  Just terribly unfair to them.  We got seated right away at 7pm on a Saturday night because nobody can get in to park.\\n\\nI remember as a kid when they had a location back in the early 80's inside the Clackamas Town Center when it was a greasy mish mash and they quickly packed up and retreated back to the South and appeasing places in the Mid-West. Fast forward a generation and their menu is in the trend of gourmet fast food and they're the hottest new place in town.  Pretty sweet turnaround!\\n\\nThe Clackamas location was built from scratch, a rather expensive endeavor but they had a masterful plan in a brilliant location.  Tried the fries here, same great taste, you just cannot do any better than this.  I had hoped the menu had been updated to include a veggie option, but no dice.  I don't expect it, but you would think moving into the Pacific NW, that idea might come to fruition.  We can always hope!  If there were, I would eat here a lot.\\n\\nService was top notch and very friendly.  They go out of their way to make you feel welcome and help you through their menu, and way of expediting which I give them points for.  The included sauces are a bonus, complete with specialized box to fill up with napkins, packets, and accessories.  Nice touch!  Cleanliness is supreme.  As insanely busy as it was even at 4pm on a Tuesday, everything was spic n' span as could be.\\n\\nSo why just 3 stars?  Traffic flow and parking is just atrocious.  While the \\"newness\\" is overwhelming and attracts many new customers, if they don't fix this situation it will turn bad in a hurry.  When you have to put a barrage of orange cones down the street and a rather nervous young employee directing traffic in the very small parking area to get cars into the drive through, it's a problem.... and not one that can be maintained for long.  This alone will keep me from returning and that's a shame.  Be prepared for long lines, backed up onto the street and long wait times.  If you're in a hurry, you'd better drive on.  They have a great spot off the Sunnyside/Sunnybrook corridor, but how the city approved their build out with that drive through I cannot comprehend!\\n\\nOverall, just great food with great people and I highly recommend eating here.   If you can relax and put their corporate politics aside and enjoy yourself, you'll have a nice time.  However, the restaurant occupying the same small parking area is no doubt being affected by the traffic bottleneck created by Chick-Fil-A.  If they haven't already had a less than polite sit down with an official mediator.....get ready it's coming!"},{"name":"Applebee's Grill + Bar","address":"1220 NW 185th Ave","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3","text":"I knew Applebees would be terrible, but I went anyway because of a gift card I received.

The roasted portion of the veggies in the scramble were the best.  There were also some pan-sauteed veggies (bell peppers & onions) in the mix and those were quite greasy, sopped up & soft with oil from the pan perhaps (at least they did't appear to be cooked the same as the roasted veggies in the dish).  It was still all very tasty, just those peppers & onions needed some improvement.  \\n\\nThey also don't do tipping at this restaurant and there is a sign on each table explaining this.

The highlight was the friendly accordion player trying to keep things lively with a Sunday afternoon crowd. \\n\\nIt's terribly unfortunate, but everything here tasted frozen and definitely not made from scratch. The pretzels were bland, the sauerkraut balls were generic mass bought in, even the potato cakes were just forgettable. \\n\\nThe German potato salad was really sweet. I know there's different variations on German recipes, and maybe I'm having some sort of Northern/Southern German food crisis here where the cuisines are different, but I really did not care for the German potato salad here. The potatoes needed to be cooked a little longer, the pork was just too sweet in them, and there was no taste of vinegar what-so-ever. \\n\\nI'm not done... Even the brats were sad, tasteless little wieners with no robust crunchy outer skin like Schmidts. Not made with love, or sourced with love. They were served with some brown gravy, and kraut (which surprisingly was not bad).\\n\\nThis one will get you--The beer was not good. I just went with a standard Lager, and it was swill. The saddest part is that I believe it's their own brewed Lager. The Hefe Weizen is a much better choice should you find yourself here.  \\n\\nIn all honesty--This place is probably an excellent choice for mass consumption of bier, but I have a feeling food enthusiasts are going to be let down by the HBH chain mentality. That's why we should really hold places like Schmidt's dear to our hearts to avoid the Disneyland hype these types of places create, but don't both to focus on the quality of their product.\\n\\nI'm just a bit let down with the experience.

The inside of the chicken was chewy. Overall, the chicken on a stick was pretty good in flavor, but in mouth feel and chewiness it really Tank's what could've been delicious. \\n\\nBeef on a stick - The beef on the script came with the same amount of skewers and the beef was slightly less jerky like on the outside, but it was even more chewy on the inside. I'm not sure what they're doing to their meat on a stick options, but I really don't get the appeal of chewy meat. It almost reminded me of the chewy sensation of intestines.\\n\\nI also had one of my usuals, the hot and sour soup - which is the only saving grace for this particular meal because, it was absolutely perfect. They always put all the extras into the hot sour soup and cook it fresh every time, which makes it that much more appealing.\\n\\nI'm docking them by one star, because three items were just not up to par on a four item meal.

They have a nice lunch menu with certain items. You can get a bowl of ramen, appie of the day, and a drink starting at $11. \\nI ordered their ramen in savory tomato soup with chicken, my gf ordered their ramen in Tokoyo style soy sauce based, topped with savory bbq pork, corn, egg, bamboo shoots and bean sprouts. For my drink, I ordered passion fruit calpis.\\n\\nFirst time ordering the ramen in savory tomato soup was really good. Either that or I was starving. I like it! The chicken was nothing special, straight up cut chicken and dumped it in the soup. I didn't eat the chicken as it was unappetizing for me. But the broth was delicious. My combo came with a potato croquette. I don't like potato croquette, but this was crispy and had a yummy sauce. I didn't finish it though as I just don't like potato croquettes. My drink was good! Nothing to complain about.  My gf broth was much more beefy tasting. Very different than mine. I much prefer my order than hers.\\n\\nThe second time I came here they moved next door to a bigger space. I came here w my spouse. I ordered the same thing ramen in savory tomato and he ordered the Japanese curry udon with deep fried prawns and chicken fried udon served on hot iron plate (yes he eats alot!). The tomato in savory soup wasn't as savory as before, so not much to say besides, it wasn't savory. The curry udon with deep fried prawns was good, until we got sick of it. The prawns were deliciously fried, the curry had a hint of spice, but the soup was thick. Halfway I felt disgusted as I was basically drinking curry. It's thick like the curry u can make at home (the glico pack). Definetly not going to order that again lol. For out udon, the server made a mistake and thought we ordered something else. She thought we ordered the chicken fried noodles served with hot iron plate. The dish wasn't good, it lacked flavor and the noodles were borderline overcooked. We also ordered the peach calpis. I really like their calpis, it's good.\\n\\nOverall this place is ok. I'll still come here if I'm craving noodle soup and I'm bored of pho or tawainese beef noodle. Next time I want to try their hot pot or their iron plate. The table next door ordered this hot plate with rice and boy did it ever smell good!

I ordered a lot of toppings, but the highlights of the dish were: sauces (garlic and curry were so good), pink cabbage, pickles, and the basmati rice. I would happily eat this plate again and again! My main piece of feedback is to put larger scoops of toppings, or, ask the patrons if the scoop was enough. I had a sprinkle of cabbage/pickles but I secretly wanted way more. Another nice touch is that the plates are compostable - yay!\\n\\nSince this place is new, I'm giving it 5 stars for great service, awesome chicken, good price point and overall great flavors that deserve to be complimented early-on. If you like Bezoria, you'll probably like Shawarma Non-Stop! If the owners happen to read this, my wish list items for this spot would be: 1-2 falafels included in a plate or as a side item, hummus as a topping and the side of fries to come with a dipping sauce (that curry sauce + fries would be literal and figurative gold).

It is a huge and beautiful resort with 6 large towers.  Back Bay Grill is right behind Tower 3.  It is adjacent to a lovely pool (heated when it's cold) with areas for a pool side band.  With an outdoor deck area, the main dining area is also open to the outside but they can put down large blinds and also use large heaters if it's too cold.  There is a large bar that fills one entire side and tables throughout.  The decor and furniture is nothing fancy.  It's basically a nice poolside and outdoor eatery and their name is perfectly suited.\\n\\nIt was a Thursday night so it wasn't busy at all when our party of about 8 arrived.  We actually just seated ourselves by pulling a few tables together.  Our waiter was very good.  Cordial, friendly and attentive.  He got our drink orders right out and kept our glasses topped all night.\\n\\nFood here (as well as any resort or park in Orlando) can be expected to be pricey.  Back Bay is no exception.  They had a simple did menu with different choices such as chips with guac, wings, tenders, fish n chips, a variety of salads, and of course a variety of burgers.  I wasn't in an adventurous mood so I just ordered their regular House burger, but they also have a Bourbon BBQ, Teriyaki pineapple and a Turkey burger.  The food seemed to take longer than usual.  Not sure if it was because we had a large party or that's their normal.  When it finally arrived my burger was room temp.  The pepper jack cheese was already melted and also room temp.  The lettuce, tomato and slices of red onion was fresh and the burger was nice and thick and tasted pretty good despite the temperature.  The most disappointing for me however was the Brioche bun which was thick and rather dry to me.  I opted for a side of onion rings which were nicely fried, tasted ok and unremarkable.  For a $16 burger, my expectations were a little higher.  Again it's a restaurant on resort grounds very close to Disney World.\\n\\nIf we stay here again next year I may return and try again, but this first run was rather unremarkable."},{"name":"The House Of Banh Mi","address":"511 NE 76th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is absolutely delicious.

I almost never have to dip my fries in ketchup/sauce and I had to for these. The sandwich tasted like it had been frozen a really long time because it was super tough and very hard. The breading stuck to it oddly. I really liked the bun, which almost tasted like garlic bread...and that's pretty much what I ate because the chicken itself, I didn't want. I should have complained, but I was semi in a rush to get to a store after dinner and didn't feel like waiting.

Close second to Eggplant on yumminess scale\\nPan E Tomat. (2*)- what can I say. Looked like someone brushed toast with salsa. Not my thing.\\n\\nFrom the dimsum cart:\\nPoached Shrimp (2*)- Sounded good but tasted totally blah. Ironically eaten with the blah mackerel.\\nFried okra (3*)- I noramally love fried okra (or any okra), but these didn't offer anything interesting.

I was delighted to find a menu replete with some of my favorite culinary components - eggs, cheese, biscuits, avocado, sourdough, and much more. I ordered a hot chai latte to go with them, and a slice of blueberry pound cake. Knowing full well that this was entirely too much food, curiosity had simply gotten the better of me.\\n\\nMy chai latte was served at an excellent drinking temperature. The foam was quantitatively appropriate and qualitatively pleasing. The sizes for their beverages are also pleasantly modest - 8,12, or 16 ounces. Though the chai latte was enjoyable, it lacked sufficient spice and complexity for put it over the top - an aspect of the meal I soon found to be a common theme.\\n\\nThe egg and cheese on biscuit enticed and intrigued in ways I've not yet experienced with regards to breakfast sandwiches. The egg (which I believe they called a souffle but which resembled nothing of the sort) sat as a gelatinous cube between two slices of biscuit. Though a sublime hint of sage permeated the sandwich, the egg lacked in both seasoning and viscosity. The biscuit was sweeter than expected, and presented precisely the desired ratio of cohesion to crumbliness.\\n\\nThe avocado on sourdough normally comes with tomato but I opted out. The avocados were properly ripe, salt and pepper were employed in exactly the amounts I prefer, and the sourdough was toothsome without being tough. Nice execution on simple fare.\\n\\nThe blueberry pound cake exerts a surprising amount of lemon for its lack of appearance in the pastry's title, and I fear the blueberry is a bit muted. The slice itself is also a bit dry. The quantity and value for this item, as for all the rest was substantial. The blueberry scones looked more appetizing, but they were a third the size for the same price - a difficult purchase to justify without better information readily available.\\n\\nThe two employees were friendly, professional, and efficient.

A friend of mine had never done one before so I called 48 hours ahead (their website says they need 24 hours notice.)  I asked to schedule an afternoon tea and when I told the man when I wanted to do he said \\"oh no, we can't do it THIS Thursday!\\" (This was in the Spring) I told him I was confused, the website said 24 hours notice and he said they were too busy that day to do it.  If that's the case, you might want to note that 2-3 days notice is more appropriate.  I waited quite a few months to try to schedule again as that left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth.  \\n\\nThis time I scheduled a week out and there was no problem with the day I chose.  However, the service was skittish at best.  She delivered our food before we even gave our tea order so we had to sit and let it steep for almost 10 minutes because the water wasn't hot enough.  We had to ask for the honey and creamer we were told we'd get and I had to get up to flag her down.  We saw her once after our food was delivered and I had to wave her down to refill our water.  (My husband and I got 4 pots of tea each the first time and we barely got two this visit.)  The scones were either stale or overbaked and hard.  We had to put quite a bit of cream and jam on top to cover it up.  I was also disappointed to see their signature marzipan peach that we each got at my first tea is no longer included in the tea.  They swapped it out for a dry and tasteless, in comparison, slice of bread of some sort.  We had to pile the jam and cream on that too.  I asked for a peach to split and paid extra for it just so she could try it.\\n\\nSo if I'm comparing the two experiences, the quality on both service and food has gone way downhill where afternoon tea is concerned and not just the service but quality of food.  Everything from food to tea was lukewarm.  Not to mention we felt completely rushed by the rest of the staff to leave.  They kept walking by and looking at us as we were talking and to the point I asked if they were closing soon about the fifth time they did it.  She said they closed at 5pm and it wasn't even 4pm yet!  (This was a different employee by the way, not our server, she left so we were never tended to the rest of the time.)  When we got up to leave 20 minutes later at 4:15pm, all of the bar stools were on the bar up front and they had been removing rugs beside us as we talked which, frankly, was rude.  They still had 45 minutes left of business!!  When we left and said how weird it was they were rushing us out, a whole family was coming in so I can only imagine if they were staying how they felt.  I'm really disappointed that this was my friends first impression of afternoon tea given my expectation from the previous experience a year ago.  I love afternoon tea and have been to many of them in many cities so I know how they should be.  While this is the closest place to me, I think that might've been my last at Mozarts.

It's essentially tuna cut up into little squares with seasoning and it's one of the most refreshing dishes I've tried in this fine city (also marked down to only $5 for happy hour). In addition, I tried the beer battered OG tacos and they weren't too bad either -- but the ceviche is undoubtedly the best thing I tried that night so it was hard to compare the two. My friend had their broccolini and seared scallops (which she didn't like but was able to switch out for shrimp tacos). We tried a variety of drinks, but the best, in my opinion, was the island time (be sure to sub tequila for mescal if you want both a smoky and fruity taste). It's only $6 during happy hour and not too strong or too watered down but perfectly balanced. The waitress was completely attentive during our visit, got our food to us quickly, and we both thoroughly enjoyed our meals. Although the space is on the smaller side, they have both indoor and outdoor seating to accommodate people who prefer either and on days like the one we went, it's the perfect patio bar to visit for bites and to hang out with friends.

Based on my experience, it appears that I was at a totally different Restaurant.  Ok, now for the review.  I saw Do (Dough) featured on the morning news and my heart started racing with excitement! I am a technology junky and knew that I must check this place out. I e-mailed my babe and suggested that we go out to eat for dinner, and he was game- YES! \\nAs a previous review stated, the location is not the best. We also passed the place and had to do a u-turn. As soon as we turned into the restaurant we were at the valet. Now I am not a big fan of valet when it is not needed, however I will put all of my \\"suggestions\\" at the end of this review (as if anyone cares about what I think would make the place even better). Once we were out of the car, we walked through the front door and were immediately greeted by a young lady. We were asked if we had reservations or were there for the event. I responded by saying no to both questions. The server stated that it was not a problem, retrieved two i-pads and walked us to a table. I am not going to go into details about the decor of this place because there are pictures all over the net, but the pictures do not do it  the justice it deserves. I was loving the projections on the wall. (Note that you should pay attention to what is being projected- you may find a discount before you leave.) When we were seated, the server sat down with us, as we had expressed that this was our first visit. The server explained how to place an order on the i-pad, how to let the valet know that you are about to depart, and how to log into wifi on your apple devices and request a song from the Do music library. \\nWhen she left the table, I proceeded to place the drink orders. After placing the order for the drinks a note  flashed across the i-pad stating that a 15% gratuity will be added to the check. My assumption is that they are simply ensuring that the people that walk around and ask if you are doing ok, as  well as the people who bring your food get tips for the night- this was not a big deal to me. Where else do you go out to eat and not leave a tip?Additionally, the servers are doing everything that any other waiter would do with the exception of physically witting down your order. Back to the experience. The drinks came out as ordered, and I placed the order for two pizza's. As we waited for our food, I browsed through the Do music library. By babe and I both requested that a song be played. After a few minutes of enjoying the projections on the wall, I figured that I should check out the bathrooms. Can you say LOVE! As a previous review stated you have to press a green button to go into the bathroom. once in--- Ok I am not going to tel you about it. Just know that it is like no other bathroom that you have seen. I do want to address some things stated in previous reviews about the bathroom. Yes, there are only 2 bathrooms, however, what is wrong with that? This place is small and I can not see it holding 300 people. I do not think that there would be a line of 10 people waiting to enter. During my experience there were only about 25 people in the building. I state this to make a comparison. I was at  One Mid-town Kitchen a few weeks ago when they had a full house. Guess what- they also only have two bathrooms and there were no issues and/or complaints. I also read that there is no way for you to know that someone is in the bathroom, that is not correct. The green light that you press to go into the restroom turns red when the bathroom is in service. No, there is no big sign that reads in use, however, they make the assumption that people know that red means stop. Last but not least, someone noted that there are no mirrors- wrong. The little device placed above the sink is your mirror. It is  the Mac photo booth so you can switch from normal, MIRROR,  infrared, ect. I thought that it was a neat concept, although I do understand that some just like to keep things simple, so please note that the Do- by no means is simple. \\nRegarding the food, I personally thought that it was good. Regarding the price, we had two pizza's, 1 alcoholic beverage, 1 fountain drink, and a banana pudding for a grand total of $43.00. Was it worth it- Yes. We all must admit that when you go to places like this you already know that you pay for the ambiance, this place is no different. I think that this is one of those places where you take your friends that visit from out of town. I also think that it would make a great venue for a small gathering/meeting. I am not sure of the rental rate, but I am sure it would be a little on the pensive side. Will I go back---- Yes, I am checking my calendar now to see when I will have guest in town again. \\nOh- no- it  appears that I have typed too much. I am not going to be able to leave my suggestions here. Note that I think valet need work, as well as the music library."},{"name":"Dharma Kitchen","address":"3667 Broadway West","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Dharma says on their website that they're vegan but yet I was offered honey with my tea.

We know it was recently sold and had a renovation done after many many years of being owned by the depasquale family.\\n\\nWe are seated right away, and are at a nice table rather than a booth. We order drinks and the meals, and our waitress was nice enough. The food came out about 10 minutes after ordering which was great.  My husband orders a second beer, I ask for a water. When the waitress returns with the second beer, she decides to reach across me, instead of walk around to his side of the table.

Not my meal, not my one glass of wine, nothing.  To say I was shocked was putting it lightly.  I wasn't looking for freebies, but sort of expected something for my trouble, and something more than a $6 dessert. \\n\\nI paid our bill-$62 before tip. I gave the waitress $10 because I figured she had to make a living. But the food was sub par- my husbands food was basically inedible- so we won't be back. I think in a situation where I tried to be really nice, and not cause a scene or be rude, actually bit me in the butt this time. Maybe if I had told them I didn't enjoy eating while soaking wet and wreaking of alcohol, I may have gotten a different response.  I think the best message I can send, is to never visit there again, and they can lose out on $60 from my family once every few months.\\n\\nOh and I did pretty much write this exact write up via an email and got zero response.

Nice, trendy environment inside. It was relatively quiet when we arrived there around 7pm. The service was attentive and kind. Very please with our waiter and his helpfulness in giving opinions on dishes. We originally came for the happy hour specials but ironically, ended up ordering off of the regular menu. The guacamole was especially tasty. I thought the salsa was excellent as well. My colleagues both ordered the salmon entree with the brussel sprouts, which they thoroughly enjoyed. I ordered the Shrimp tacos which were actually pretty spicy (almost too spicy) but quite flavorful. Don't order if you can't handle a little heat. They came with a side of pinto beans which were a bit of a bland filler. They also came in a soft shell, almost like a pita, which I enjoyed more than a traditional taco tortilla. I ordered the sangria which was average in taste and came with too much ice for my liking. The entrees were overpriced in my opinion, but there again, it is Boulder, so many I need to adjust my standards!

Even with the wonderful sauces I couldn't eat more than one of the generous 4 pieces offered. Thank you for even having a vegetarian option which frankly I wasn't even expecting to see. One suggestion would be to deep fry the Tofu a bit before adding the breadcrumbs. This way you wouldn't be biting into raw tofu. You could also bake the tofu and then coat in sauce and bake some more. Another thought would be to have a basket based around one of several amazing plant based sausages out there \\"Field Roast\\" has an amazing line of plant based sausage that would make a great basket.

Another dark and rustic modern restaurant in the recently very controversial area of downtown Vancouver. Another higher end restaurant being picketed by protestors. Today we got a first hand look at all this as we were talked down to coming in, and shouted at each time the restaurant's heavy glass door was opened. We were seated closest to the door and it was opening a lot. This was a popular restaurants with long lines and bodies lingering well into 9pm. Luckily we had made a reservation, and I suggest you do the same if you plan on coming down. If you miss the place, a purple neon skull lights the way. \\n\\nThis was our first time navigating a Latin menu, and they didn't make it easy on us. Nothing was self explanatory, with titles and ingredients spelt out in Spanish. Half of what we ordered, we didn't know what it was. We did ask our waitress for clarification over a few items, and even she couldn't pronounce a few of the words. It ended up being a matter of pointing to our selection. I would suggest a glossary if they didn't want to spell it out, for those unfamiliar with the cuisine. \\n\\nA page each was enough for the food and drinks listing. The drinks were tequila centric. Cocktails with rosemary, egg whites, and sugar cane. With the most intriguing being their \\"Tequila Flights\\", three tequila samples bundled together for sampling. Think a beer taster paddle, but tequila in each of the glasses instead. The food was simple. Fresh ingredients prepared with skill, and allowed to shine with minimal seasonings. Each of the entrees came grouped as threes. Our waitress gave us the option to add one of two more servings in order to give everyone their own. This was a nice touch that most places don't offer. Entrees are not typically meant for sharing. By meal's end we agreed that we were all full from sharing; and that it was better to have shared everything, because it was all so rich.\\n\\nWould I come back? - Yes and no. In a larger group it was fun to share bites and try a portion of everything. But if you are to come and order just one entree for yourself, the flavours are so rich it may prove to be difficult to finish alone. Having tried more than half the menu I can state that the food is solid, yet I am not compelled to come back to order any of what I had again. For tacos I know more authentic places. For steak I have tried better. For seafood the options are endless. And for everything else, it available somewhere.

On top of that, the woman running the show was despicable. We saw her yelling at the employees, grabbing their arms, talking down to them as if they were slaves, etc. Overall she was just a downright awful person to be around. \\nAt one point, one of the two servers we had brought us an incorrect dish and asked if we wanted it anyways, to which we agreed.

We tossed around a few local places, and decided on Rocco's.  We know it was recently sold and had a renovation done after many many years of being owned by the depasquale family.\\n\\nWe are seated right away, and are at a nice table rather than a booth. We order drinks and the meals, and our waitress was nice enough. The food came out about 10 minutes after ordering which was great.  My husband orders a second beer, I ask for a water. When the waitress returns with the second beer, she decides to reach across me, instead of walk around to his side of the table.  She then proceeds to dump her tray of drinks on me, and on my dinner.\\n\\nI tried to be gracious about it, telling her not to worry and she ran off to get napkins. My whole top is soaked and the thighs of my pants. She apologizes profusely, but seems to be more concerned with my meal needing to be replaced than by how wet I am.  I will also note that it was an alcoholic drink of some sort, so I also smell like a ton of booze.\\n\\nI should have said I didn't want my food replaced, and the check would be fine.  But I didn't and agreed to let them re-make my meal.\\n\\nI sat there for another 10 minutes with no food while my husband and 6&8 year old ate. I was then approached by who I believe was the new owner and she stated that the waitress felt really bad about what happened, and then walked away.\\n\\nWhen the waitress comes back with my meal, she then tells me she will buy me a dessert. A dessert?  Why would I want to sit here soaking wet even longer? \\n\\nI politely declined, made up a lie that we were stuffed, asked for 3 boxes and the check.  Nothing was comped on the check. Not my meal, not my one glass of wine, nothing.  To say I was shocked was putting it lightly.  I wasn't looking for freebies, but sort of expected something for my trouble, and something more than a $6 dessert. \\n\\nI paid our bill-$62 before tip. I gave the waitress $10 because I figured she had to make a living. But the food was sub par- my husbands food was basically inedible- so we won't be back. I think in a situation where I tried to be really nice, and not cause a scene or be rude, actually bit me in the butt this time. Maybe if I had told them I didn't enjoy eating while soaking wet and wreaking of alcohol, I may have gotten a different response.  I think the best message I can send, is to never visit there again, and they can lose out on $60 from my family once every few months.\\n\\nOh and I did pretty much write this exact write up via an email and got zero response. I was basically just looking for an apology and let them know in the future the customer shouldn't be the one making the staff feel better about dumping drinks on them.\\n\\nUpdate:  i was slighted by a fellow yelper for not providing a review of the actual food that was deemed inedible by my husband. He ordered the buffalo chicken calzone, and the chicken had tendons all through it, so not high quality? And the cheese in the calzone was not melted at all. \\n\\nAlthough it may seem like a rant, the evening this happened i was pretty pissed off.

There was a generous amount of pepperonis and chunks of tomatoes and garlic.  It taste amazing!!  My husband isn't big on garlic and he loved it.  The crust had a nice crisp too it also.

The chashu fried rice had very little chashu which was a little disappointing. Red miso ramen had a slight kick to it but the broth was unique and was well made. It wasn't too salty which was a plus and also had several toppings included. Would consider adding the soft boiled egg for next time. The Fuddo-Yama Ramen was their standard ramen with noodles, green onion, a piece of nori and one piece of chashu pork. The broth was not overpowering and was tastier than it may appear. Flavor was well balanced. The ramen noodles was the perfect amount of thickness. Added the soft boiled egg which was perfected and the yolk was still runny. \\n\\nOverall, the food was good and service was great. Only advice is to order extra chashu for the carnivores.

The ahi tuna was good, all the fish seemed fresh. \\n\\nService was great. For some reason, the take-out lids don't fit onto the bowls so the cashier has to tape each one.

Let me start by saying the cheese itself was good, tasty, enjoyable. Unfortunately, the class didn't live up to the hype. Do yourself a favor and spend $45 on cheeses in the shop, then go home, invite some friends over and tell them to BYOB, and have your own cheese class. You will have a much better time.\\n\\nCons:\\nFirst, the Fareground is not a good spot for what is described as an \\"intimate\\" class. It's essentially an open dining hall/meeting space with sound-echoing floors and ceilings. There was a happy hour event taking place a few feet away from our table and we could barely hear the cheese master describing what we were eating. Second, to make matters worse, the shop had a printing issue and we weren't given menus to actually tell us what we were eating. At the end of the night, cheese master Brenda (?) said she would email us a list of the cheese we tried, but she should have done this before the class so we could follow along.  And I have not received the email yet. Third, when I signed up for the class I could have SWORN the website said \\"Should you choose to bring your own wine or beer, there is a $4 set-up fee.\\" (it did - I just checked the facebook event that still exists for this April 17th event and it says exactly that)...but when I went to the website to double check the set-up fee on the day-of, the event description had been changed! \\"NOTE: THIS EVENT IS NOT BYOB. You must either purchase the ticket with the alcohol pairing or purchase alcohol through the bar at Fareground.\\" Fine, I said. Rules are rules; we'll buy drinks from the bar if we have to. But the women next to us hadn't seen the update (I don't blame them) and brought their own bottles. The Antonelli's staff first told them they couldn't BYOB, then caved and opened up their bottles for them. So I spent $40 on drinks from the bar when I could have brought a $10 bottle of wine after all. Fourth, they asked us to take out our tickets and then never came by to actually look at them. Then they kept asking if we had gotten the tasting w/ alcohol pairing or without. Seems like an easy way to get scammed by less honest customers...and finally, the communal bread baskets ran out about halfway through the tasting and when I asked if we could get some more before trying the last (bleu) cheese, was told that the bakery was out of bread. It's a cheese tasting of 7 types of cheese - you are going to need more than 3 baguettes for 14+ people.\\n\\nPros: Like I said, the cheese was good. I'm still a fan of Antonelli's, but doubt I'll make it to another one of their special event classes."},{"name":"Bittersweet - Cafe & Confections","address":"836 Main St","city":"Louisville","stars":"3.5","text":"We popped in here by chance, a typical trendy little spot, thankfully we were able to find seating.\\n\\nMy friend & I both ordered caramel macchiatos but they tasted completely different.

The seasonal one today is ninniku tonkotsu (garlic pork). The black garlic oil and chili sounded like a warming combination as the weather has gotten colder.\\n\\nAs it was post rush hour (1:20 pm) there were only 3 other customers. It's a well lit facility with brick and white/black paint motif that reflects the Old Town feel. 3 beautiful potted plants with leaves cascading down at the entrance/exit. You can hear the chef sharpening the knife, and with kitchen which is hidden by dish racks, but activity can be heard clearly. \\n\\nNow.... the ramen. The presentation was beautiful - the bowl has signature mountain, the wood block for customer number is heavy and inscribed with Afuri insignia, and top it off so does the chop stick. Branding is well represented. The broth brimmed, but I noticed it was very \\"see through\\" and oil was thin... egg was cold and was not right out of the boiling water. I tasted the broth - it was watery. \\n\\nWhen I order tonkotsu I expect rich oily broth packed with flavors. I want it to add extra layer of skin on my body for the impending winter. Even after mixing all the ingredients to enhance the flavors, it was still unsatisfactory. You can't make up the lack of umami in the soup base.\\n\\nFor such high price point, portion is smaller than other competitors. Noodles were also bit over cooked and straight noodle type - I like mine curled to catch the broth. I had hoped my experience would improve since visiting the main site, but it seems it has similar issues. Perhaps I'll try one last time with the dumplings next time, but it'd be sad to enjoy that over the ramen."},{"name":"Waffle House","address":"1227 Virginia Ave","city":"East Point","stars":"3.5","text":"A pleasure to walk in and be greeted kindly.

Taking advantage of the opportunity presented to him, we started with a dozen oysters (not fried) and a ten-piece order of the sweet soy wings.

It's not anti-establishment to make my spinal column look like a slinky at rest.  It's just dumb. \\n\\nI was saving the best for last.  The Internet.  First forty-five minutes free, $5 an hour after that, and a double-digit membership price for returning guests.\\n\\nWhy?  Profit, that's why.  Salut for trying to make a buck.  But you still suck.\\n\\nThe real question is: Does the cafe really need that money?  Between the pool tables, the amount of space, and the drinks, Diesel is not going to run out of customers any time soon.  But assuming I'm wrong about that, then keep the membership charge and the free forty-five.  But for people who are somewhere in between one-timers and regulars, occasionals if you will, a lower hourly rate would be better at drawing them back.\\n\\nMy grasp on finance is shakier than Michael J. Fox but, from a customer's point of view, frequency and familiarity with a place are what convince a part-timer to purchase the full version of anything.  Therefore, your special offers have to be really special to make sure stingy people keep coming back.  I'd happily pay a dollar fifty to two dollars an hour for Internet.\\n\\nIf I keep coming back, I might think to myself, I'm here every other day anyway so I might as well buy the membership, because by then the membership price will seem more worth it than it initially did.  Consult your accountant, take my advice, and I'll come back.  Not that it matters.  You'll do fine without me.\\n\\nThough the staff was helpful, it's not enough to salvage the place."},{"name":"AFURI ramen + dumpling","address":"50 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"#tyzuramen good, #gyoza #potstickers amazing, #noodles good, #softshellcrab just ok, pork bun not good, #friedchicken #karaage good."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(n=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return n.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"search-container"},R={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],D={key:0},j={key:1};function F(n,e,s,f,i,r){const u=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",H,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",R,[(a(!0),o(m,null,y(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(u,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",j,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",D,"See more"))],8,N)):w("",!0)])}const G=c(E,[["render",F],["__scopeId","data-v-2415d5c3"]]),V=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/16.md","filePath":"sponsor/16.md"}'),L={name:"sponsor/16.md"},Y=Object.assign(L,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(G)]))}});export{V as __pageData,Y as default};
