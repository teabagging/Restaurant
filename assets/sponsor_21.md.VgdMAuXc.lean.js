The deep blue fa√ßade, the neatly trimmed vines, the huge picture windows. It's a gorgeous restaurant. But what started as a casual spot, where you could casually peruse the shelves, order something at the counter, and lazily sit and snack, as slowly becomes something more... strained.\\n\\nThe waiter service for a menu that doesn't deserve the pomp of waiters makes no sense to me. For one, the place was clearly designed for a more casual experience, as is indicated by the total lack of waiting space. Second, the food here has never been good enough to warrant the higher prices and more turgid approach. Always good, but never great.\\n\\nAnd while I've had some memorable experiences with desserts - I'm looking at you cookies - I must comment on the mediocrity of the beignets. They look delicious, puffy and sugary, but they taste a bit too much like the oil they are cooked in. And textually, they aren't quite as crisp on the outside, or light on the inside. It's like the beignets are a metaphor for this entire place - visually stunning, but ultimately ordinary."},{"name":"Yakuza","address":"5411 NE 30th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I'll admit it: I went to a Japanese restaurant for it's burger.

I'm happy to have a place like this here, because I don't know of any shabu-shabu places in the Cambridge area! Overall it was a very standard meal but with a nice, clean environment (in contrast to some of the Boston staples like Kaze or Shabuzen), and I like the diversity in the menu.\\n\\n- Beef combo shabu shabu - got the default broth. Very standard, Chinese tasting hot pot (haven't found a Japanese one in the US yet). The veggies were standard (some mushrooms including enoki, daikon, taro, spinach, cabbage, etc). The meat seemed fresher than other places I've been.\\n\\n- Xiao long bao (soup dumplings) - fairly tasty. Not very strong, not a lot of soup, and the vinegar sauce is strong so use it sparingly. I prefer mine to have a lot more soup in general. The meat is good though and the skins are tasty and don't fall apart like other places! My favorite in Boston are still Gourmet Dumpling house. \\n\\n- Green tea ice cream - surprisingly not much flavor (in contrast the deliciously bitter matcha ice cream at Gyukaku). \\n\\nOverall, the tastes of this place don't seem too different from other shabu shabu places in Boston. I like the list of the side menu and am curious about the ramen for next time. Everything looks clean and I like how it has the upscale look of other East Cambridge restaurants while still being affordable.

OTP, in this case, more appropriately stands for *on* the perimeter rather than outside the perimeter.  The restaurant used to be open until 2am on most nights, but recently changed its operating hours to:\\n\\nMonday, Tuesday, Thursday: 11:00am to 12:30am\\nWednesday: Closed\\nFriday: 11:00am to 1:00am\\nSaturday: 12:00pm to 1:00am\\nSunday: 12:00pm to 12:30am\\n\\nI thought the change warranted an updated Yelp review.  I also have some new food recommendations since my original review.  They are:\\n\\nFried Fish Maw with Crab Meat (Soup)\\nHouse Fried Rice\\nWor Shu (\\"Sue\\" on menu) Duck\\nPeking Spare Ribs\\n\\nSalt and Pepper Squid (\\"Pan Fried Spicy Salted Squid\\" on menu) and Sauteed Snow Pea (tips) are still highly recommended.  At dinnertime, most entrees are around $11-13.  Seafood (fish, crab, oysters, clams) and duck are higher.\\n\\nThe Fried Fish Maw with Crab Meat soup is one of my parents' favorites.  If it's on the menu at a Chinese restaurant, they'll order it almost every time.  It's a mild soup with a clear, thick broth.  Fish maw has a light, spongy consistency.  This soup is best eaten with a little bit of red vinegar and white pepper.  If there isn't any red vinegar at your table, ask your server for a bottle.  It changes the flavor of the soup significantly.  Also, I tend to think they use imitation crab in their fish maw soup because I'm allergic to crab and it didn't affect me.\\n\\nI can't believe I'm recommending the House Fried Rice, but I am.  It's good stuff.  Freshly prepared with all sorts of chopped protein (egg, chicken, pork sausage, shrimp) and a few veggies like carrots and peas.  Delicious and filling.\\n\\nThe \\"Wor Sue Duck\\" (as printed on menu) is boneless, fried duck served over mixed vegetables.  Typically, Chinese duck is roasted and served bone-in, so this dish is different.  Each slice of duck has a layer of crispy batter around it.  It's pretty good over a base of veggies such as baby corn, cabbage, broccoli, snow peas, and mushrooms.  A thick brown sauce at the bottom provides more flavor.\\n\\nThe Peking Spare Ribs are very good.  These are served at most Cantonese restaurants.  Pork spare ribs, chopped bone-in, and coated in a savory red sauce.  Sweet and tangy, kind of like BBQ.  I don't see how anyone cannot like this dish unless they're opposed to too much flavor.  It can be a little strong.\\n\\nI'm upping my rating for this place, though I'm still not a fan of their cramped table seating.  Generally, I think it's good for all-around Cantonese comfort food."},{"name":"Emmer & Rye","address":"51 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This place wouldn't be so bad if you're on a date, but when eating with a bachelorette party sized-group, it's kind of depressing (everyone only gets 1 bite!!). \\n\\nWe tried: \\n- (from the dim sum cart) Wagyu Beef Tartare, Sunchoke Miso, Thai Chile, Kohlrabi, Egg Yolk, Rice Cracker - good, but you only get 1 cracker for $4?!?!  \\n- Blue Crab, Green Tomato, Green Papaya, Daikon - okay.

It's the first time I was here in \\"daylight\\" and before the crowds; i was amazed by how large the dining area is. On previous visits, we sat at the bar, which is also nice, but this night since my friend and I had a lot to catch up on, I enjoyed being in the restaurant area. \\n\\nCocktails to start are a must at Renata! Even for a typically red wine drinker like me. Their bartenders do a great job with craft cocktails and the standards.  The Text on the Beach, with blood orange gin, Grand Marneir and verjus did not diassapoint! Actually, it went down way too fast!\\n\\nWe both started with the endive salad. Each \\"boat\\" of endive had bright Meyer lemon and olive oil dressing contrasting nicely with the bitterness of the endive. They piled up the leaves into a pyramid, sprinkled with Parmesan, making a lovely presentation. \\n\\nFor dinner I had a pasta dish with pesto topped with fresh burrata followed by braised chicken over fennel.  This was part of The Portland  Dining Month special. Both were bursting with flavor. \\n\\nWe didn't have time for dessert, but will try the cannoli next time. \\n\\nI'd be remiss if I didn't do a particular shout out to our waiter, Daniel. He was attentive but not overbearing, offered great suggestions, and made sure we had enough time between courses to enjoy them while being conscientious of time so we could make the concert. \\n\\nThe reason I like Renata so much is they prepare meals with just a few, but high quality ingredients. When Meyer lemons are in season, they cook with them. When mushrooms are available, they are on the menu in several dishes. The flavors are strong, but not overpowering. It's Italian cooking the way Italians in Italy cook!

The lady looked really irritated and responded, \\"I don't have an opener.\\"  She never stopped walking while she was talking to us and she didn't offer to send a waiter over or bring an opener back to us. At this point I was ready to walk out.  We had already been sitting there for several minutes and no waiter came to our table.

I've never had a bad onion ring until this day.  We only had about 12 onion rings in the stack.  We shared these rings amongst 5 adults.  We did not even bother finishing the onion rings, they were not good.  I had clam chowder, mediocre at best.  My mom ordered the chunky chicken salad and hated it.

We sat at the bar because we were there for the ramen not the hotpot. The service was excellent (the restaurant was slow however). Now on to the ramen. First let me say this is the only ramen place anywhere nearby that offers vegetarian AND gluten free noodles, as my gf is gluten free and vegetarian. I got the tonkotsu ramen and she got the vegetarian ramen with rice noodles. Both were exceptionally good. I've tried a lot of ramen and their ramen stands up with the best of them, surprisingly really. Broths: tonkotsu broth was rich and creamy, vegetarian broth was flavorful. Egg: the seasoned egg stood out and was probably the best I've had. Noodles: the texture of the both style of noodles was just right with the wheat noodles holding the broth slightly better. Pork: both styles of pork are delicious, but the pork belly was my favorite. Cost: this was the only downfall of the experience, their ramen is fairly expensive when compared to other ramen shops I've been to. Two bowls of ramen with a side or two ran up to $50 with tip.

I came back to pick them up as I saw they were nearly finished. We paid in a different area where you can pay for sandwiches and any other take out items together. Tris may work in their favor as anyone just wanted some sides to go doesn't have to wait for someone who is paying for a sandwich - I think... except to place the order.

A bag of chips makes a perfect side, but don't overlook the delicious caprese salad either. They provide a water / coffee station to self serve, making the wait for the sandwich seem a little less.

You park in front of the building, then go inside to check in.

Why is it so complicated?? I wish they had valet instead. Parking was very limited, and I got a spot in the very back, farthest from the hotel. Being that I didn't arrive until late at night, this was not a good experience for me. Luckily I didn't get robbed or attacked :|\\n\\nOnce I entered the hotel, it reeked of chlorine. This smell lingered throughout the hotel. To get to my room was quite the hike, and it was not clean. Ugh!! After working all day and almost three hours to get here, I had to deal with all of these obstacles. The sheets on the bed were dirty, and the carpet was sticky. I'm glad I always travel with Lysol to spray things down. I opted to use my blanket instead of the sheets. I was exhausted so I immediately feel asleep. When I woke up the next morning to use the restroom (this was my first time going inside), I noticed it was dirty as well. There was mud and towels on the floor and urine in the trash can. URINE!!!!

The salmon piece was torn too and I asked the sushi chef about it. He said it's still ok to eat. Fortunately he replaced it with a fresh one that wasn't too bad. It was disappointing and my friends agreed that it wasn't as good as they have have had there too. Maybe it was ordering the combo.

I ordered the Tonkotsu Tantanmen, Buta Gyoza, and Yuzu Limeade. Ordering is self-serve from a digital kiosk which is pretty user friendly. Staff was nice and super helpful as well. The Ramen was really good, flavorful broth with a good medium-hot spice. Noodles are cooked to a firm texture which I prefer. The Yuzu Limeade was addicting and was one of the most favored parts of my meal. I was pretty disappointed with the Buta Gyoza. The texture was quite off for me as the filling had more of a paste texture with chunks of onion, like the pork was put through a food processor rather than having a consistent texture of a pork mince with onion, with that it was really hard to finish the order of Gyoza. \\n\\nThe kitchen is in a pretty open area and the table I sat at was the closest to where they did the assembly and expediting. There seemed to be a lot of confusion in getting orders to the correct table and even witnessed a waitress deliver a plate to the wrong table. The plate sat with the wrong customer for ~3-5 minutes before it was picked up and then delivered to the correct customer, personally I feel the order should have been remade as the order sat in front of the wrong customer and could have been touched.\\n\\nAll-in-all not a bad experience.

Great food and the best service"},{"name":"Cactus Club Cafe","address":"1085 Canada Place","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"We were a party of 7 and made reservation for 6:30. When we arrived, we were told that the table wasn't ready yet and we would receive a text when the table became available. So we just walked along coal harbour to enjoy the sunshine. We probably waited for about 20 minutes before we received the text. The wait was understandable given that it was friday night and the restaurant was busy. We sat at a booth and luckily we were able to enjoy the beautiful view. \\n\\nWe ordered a bunch of appetizers to share: mini burgers, szechuan chicken lettuce wraps, calamari, yam fries, and baja fish tacos with yam fries. The mini burgers were great, buns were warm and crispy, the beef wasn't dry at all, and it had the perfect amount of mayonnaise to hold everything together. I really enjoyed the szechuan chicken lettuce wraps: excellent contrast between the crunchy lettuce and the tender chicken. The peanuts also added an extra crunch to it. I loved the sweet and spicy flavour, it had just the right kick. The baja fish tacos were also very tasty. I enjoyed the beer battered cod. However, I thought there was just a little too much shredded cabbage, salsa and radish on top. The yam fries were yam fries, nothing spectacular about them but they were addicting. I was disappointed in the calamari because when it arrived it looked like it had been sitting out for too long. They were soggy and looked flat overall. I had to rely on the tzarziki and the aioli to give it flavour.\\n\\nI ordered the tuna poke bowl for my main course and it looked delicious when it arrived. I thought there were too little tuna given the amount of the rice it came with. But I did enjoy the edamame, mango, and avocado as they tasted very fresh. There were a lot of lettuce and it looked like half my bowl was covered with them. The description said there was crispy tempura but I couldn't find any. On another note, it was interesting to see how a couple slices of cucumber and radish made it onto the menu description but the lettuce didn't. This poke bowl used jasmine rice but it just didn't offer the same taste as it would with japanese rice. Maybe it was because japanese rice and vinegar enhance flavour of the fish (and other ingredients) and I didn't find that here. As a result, I felt the rice was a separate component on its own. \\n\\nThe summer smash and frose that I had were excellent. Summer smash was refreshing and it was the perfect drink before a meal. The frose was on a sweeter side, but I didn't mind it. It was a good drink to have while catching up with friends because drinking it too fast would probably lead to a brain freeze and you wouldn't want that. We shared a key lime pie and chocolate lava cake. I loved the key lime pie much more than the lava cake. The key lime pie was light and smooth. The outside of the chocolate lava cake was too hard for me, and I had to take a sip of water after each bite to wash it out a bit. The ice cream was good though.\\n\\nI wasn't sure if the server sensed that we were ready to pay but she gave us the bill when we didn't ask for it. We felt like we were rushed to pay our bill and leave. Ironically, another server dropped by with the happy hour menu as it was approaching 10:00 PM. We decided to get one more round of drinks so the server retrieved the bill she left us earlier. When we asked for the bill, some items were assigned to the wrong person even though we didn't switch seats. The server gave us a pen to make corrections so that she could readjust the bill for us. Unfortunately, she still got it wrong even though she said she understood the changes when I personally explained it to her. We just decided to pay back each other the difference of the wrong items because we knew it would take a long while before she came along again. Overall, the service was considerably good as the server came by to check up on us except the little mix up at the end."},{"name":"Kouzzina","address":"2101 Epcot Resort Blvd","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"3.5","text":"My first impression of the restaurant walking in was that the decor is tastefully done, but nothing that would make you feel like you were at an upscale Greek restaurant.  While I understand the restaurant is part of a Disney resort, a dress code would have been nice, which is something other Disney resort restaurants have as sitting across from a patron in a t-shirt with ripped off sleeves and shorts somewhat detracts from feeling you're someplace nicer than Olive Garden.\\n\\nWhile the appetizers and salads sounded nice, many are as expensive as some of the entrees, so we passed on them.\\n\\nThe restaurant has only recently opened, so it is understandable that there may be some hiccups, however our waiter was absolutely atrocious every step of the way.  He was hardly comprehensible and he would disappear for long extended periods of time.  We ordered the \\"Wood-grilled Flank Steak with fresh Herb Saltsa and Kouzzina Potatoes\\" and \\"Fisherman's Stew with Fennel, Grilled Bread, and Ouzo Butter\\" and after a while our meals were brought out by a food runner, not our waiter.\\n\\nWhile at first glance, the meal looked good.  The steak and potatoes had a great aroma as did the fisherman's stew.  The portions however were inequitable.  The steak appeared to be a 4-6 oz. cut and there were only five small potatoes, whereas the fisherman's stew was a hearty portion filling a large bowl.  I don't like seafood all that much, but seafood stew had a nice, spicy broth with a generous helping of clams, mussels, calamari, shrimp, scallops, and snapper. Cutting into the diminutive steak however, I found it was well done and I had ordered it medium rare.\\n\\nOur server never came around to check to see how everything was, he literately disappeared.  As after ten minutes of waiting for him to come back, I tried to get the attention of other waiters, but they all seemed to be in their own little worlds or didn't hear me, so I finally got up and asked one to get the manager.  A couple of minutes later, she arrived and I showed her how the steak and she promised to take care of it.  After about ten or fifteen minutes, she came back with the replacement and asked me to cut into it for her and again it was completely well done.\\n\\nAt this point, I figured that the grill chef could not cook a steak to temperature (and I can't stand an overcooked steak, especially a tough cut like flank steak), so I just said I would switch over to the \\"Oak-fired Pork T-bone with Farmhouse Greens and Citrus-Fennel Marmalade\\" done medium well, as overcooked pork is less of an issue than beef.  After waiting another ten to fifteen minutes, my dish came out overcooked again, but I wasn't going to make an issue of it and turn the evening into a disaster.  There was little flavor to it, certainly no smokiness from being \\"oak-fired\\", it was probably only a half inch thick, and all you tasted in the marmalade was the citrus, which added a little bit of sweetness if eaten with the pork.  In my haste to order something new, I neglected to realize the greens were cooked greens, which I'm generally not a big fan of and these were no different.  They were bitter (as greens tend to taste to me) and none of the supposed garlic flavor came out with them.\\n\\nOur waiter continued to show his incompetence as the night unfolded.  He came back to our table with a steak knife and soup spoon only after the steak had been sent back and my wife was already half way through her stew.  After the steak went back a second time, he stopped by and mumbled something something I couldn't understand; it wasn't until the manager came back with my pork that I found she was offering me a drink as compensation.  I took her up on it and tried a flight of the Greek reds, but even if I had understood what our waiter was saying, I would have waited to ask her about pairings as he was no sommelier.\\n\\nFor dessert, we both had the Baklava with Pistachio Gelato which was okay.  The baklava was rolled with the filling in the center rather than layered, which was a little difficult to eat with a fork as it was dry as it would shatter into crumbles.  The flavor was good though and the pistachio gelato was very good; I could have taken a big dish of the gelato by itself.  As the coup de gr√¢ce, after we had told our waiter that we wanted to take our desserts to go, he came back with a pitiful little cupcake barely big enough to hold the two candles stuck into it and lit them at the table with a cigarette lighter in \\"honor\\" of our anniversary, which I told the host of when we checked in.\\n\\nThe food at Kouzzina wasn't bad, it just wasn't consistently good and certainly fell short of my expectations, especially for the price.  The service we experienced however was very bad and for the restaurant's sake, I hope it improves."},{"name":"iPho 2 Noodle House","address":"156 Lake Ave","city":"Maitland","stars":"4","text":"The fried rice was tasteless and the spring rolls tasted like fish.

My daughter's chicken parm was pre cooked because parts of it were stone cold and that portion was a bit stingy.  My wife got the lemon chicken with a side of risotto.  the chicken was under seasoned and was nothing more than chicken tenders you would buy at Market Basket.  Not to mention they were cooked to the consistency of hockey pucks.  The risotto was the biggest dissappointment.  It was way overcooked and was basically a bowl of mush.

The Mayo was more like butter, I got a side of it and thought it actually was butter at first. I also got a side of the pate and thought it tasted like the canned variety, not good.

I had heard good things about Noodlebox, and when chance came upon me to finally go to an establishment I perused the online menu for what I should consume. Scanning, I did, until the very moment I saw \\"Butter Chicken Box,\\" that I knew with a greater certainty than the fact that I would die, what would be in my future and body very soon. \\nI arrived to Noodlebox with determination and hunger. Words exchanged, money given, I waited. There were two orders, one for my lovely company, and one for me. Sitting on the stools chatting with my wonderful company waiting for my Butter Chicken Box listed under the specials, most of me in the conversation, but a part of me reserved solely for counting down the minutes until I could obtain the Butter Chicken Box and regain my HP and find my joy in life. \\nThen, my name was called, and I found the aromas that made me get up in the morning; the flavors and spices that powered me through my day and unconscious dreams. I finally had in my possession the answer for why I slaved all my days away working. However, I noticed that the box did not even come with a cute chopstick that stuck straight up from the side of the box that my friend had (which, is actually a bad gesture to do in some areas of Asia, ahem* Southeast Asian street food Noodlebox...). I was quickly disregarded after being told that my Special Butter Chicken Box came with a separate box for my naan bread (less than ten pieces of misshapenned questionably oblong pieces of flat bread). I thought to myself, perhaps these people have had a long day, and considering there is a box of take out chopsticks, I should get them myself--after all, why else would I have been bestowed the power of legs and walking, had it not been for this very day (January 20, 2018) to grab my own chopsticks. Alas, I was on my way with my bag of two take out boxes (Butter Chicken Box!!!) and the chopsticks that I had grabbed. \\nEons later after having found a parking spot somewhere else unimportant, I was able to eat my grub (still warm, all good--for now). Realizing my hunger, I tore open the chopstick pack and opened the takeway box, ready for my life's sustenance. I smelt the familiar scents and immediately starting feasting. At first all was well, and then the deeper I dove into this somewhat densely packed small container the gut feeling attacked. I felt something was off. I started chewing slower, really trying to feel the textures, then I noticed that what made my Butter Chicken Box \\"Special\\" was the \\"Special\\" lack of protein. \\nI put my years of chopstick experience to the greatest test as I searched for my chicken! But yeah, no chicken was found, no bock bocks to be heard in this box of rice and butter chicken wannabe. \\nI do not employ the mindset of regrets, but peeps, I paid like $14.70 for some naan and rice soaked in butter chicken shower water. I get that the place is called Noodlebox, not Ricebox, but I don't want to get into that, my butter rice box only gave me enough cals to type this much. \\n\\nHave a great day by not getting the butter chicken box y'all."},{"name":"Lebanese Kitchen","address":"18631 SW Tualatin Valley Hwy","city":"Aloha","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing Lebanese food.

Several employees saw me in line with the baguette and didn't bother to ask me if I needed anything - they were just standing around behind the counter. \\n\\nWhen it got to my turn, I asked the woman behind the counter if I could have another one and explained that the one we got was over-cooked as I handed it to her. She rolled her eyes and told me that was the way baguettes were cooked in France. OMG! Really? French people like their baguettes burnt? I think not. I have had baguettes in France many, many times having lived there for quite some time and that baguette was definitely NOT something that they would eat or serve.

I hate to leave a 1 star for anybody I really do but when I pay $15 for a sandwich I expect the quality of the meat to be on par with the price. I don't know if the beef comes sliced, or if they slice it in house before they cook it but that kind of quality, or lack thereof is unacceptable for any price really. That's how you crack a tooth or choke plus it's just unpleasant man it's disgusting. Also, what's with the tipping at the counter? I called in an order and picked it up, why am I being asked to tip? Picking up is not the same as being served and apparently the meat cant even be sliced without bone and cartilage so am I supposed to tip for the slicing lol?

I'm sure it's great for a date night, but I would not recommend it for a group as they will not be friendly or try to accommodate. The food was delicious! Several of us had eggs Benedict, which I would highly recommend. We shared a cinnamon roll which did not disappoint. It was plentiful and each dish provided a unique twist on a breakfast classic. Everyone in the group agreed the food was excellent. We all had Dole Whip mimosas and I would go back just for those as they were amazing. That being said, being a wine bar, I would not have brought children along except that it is located in Disney Springs. As we live in the area, we have visited almost all of the restaurants in Disney Springs with our children (as well as just my husband and I on date nights) and all restaurants have been more than accommodating due to being on Disney property. In fact, I think restaurants and Disney employees generally go above and beyond in terms of customer service. I realize this restaurant is not an official Disney restaurant, however, being on Disney property I believe they need to realize they will need to function a little differently than if they were not or else should only be open in the evening as they clearly do not want families there. The manager and employees in the greeting area were not friendly and seemed irritated with any and every question and request we had. We felt like an inconvenience to them as we were more than just 2-4 people, even though arrangements and reservations had been made well in advance. Our group agreed it was a mess of an experience and not something we would attempt again.

I usually go around lunch time, and there normally isn't a big wait, but my friend came to visit so we decided to go for dinner. There was a huge temperature drop in Austin, which made it perfect for hot pot, but I suppose everyone had the same idea. We waited an hour for a table! The wait was well worth it. Even though the entire place was jam packed, the food was still top quality and amazing. We ordered the $29.99 dinner special and it came with vegetables, noodles, 2 types of meat, and a variety of seafood. This was plenty of food and there was a lot of variety. We also got the \\"half and half\\" broth which is mild broth and spicy broth. Both broths were well seasoned. \\n\\nThe reason why I gave it 4 stars was because the service is always inconsistent when I come here. The very first time I came here, one of the ladies felt annoyed when we asked her to explain the menu. She kept pressing us to do all you can eat even though we wanted to know the other options. The second time I came here, the service was amazing and our waiter took time to fully explain the menu (which I'll explain below). During my most recent visit, the place was extremely understaffed. Our waitress did an amazing job and she seemed to be the only one tending to patrons in the entire restaurant, but everyone else did a subpar job and barely tended to everyone other than placing their order at their table once it was ready. We understood that there was high volume while we were there, however, our waitress was the only one that went above and beyond, I wish the other employees had the same sense of urgency. \\n\\nFurthermore, if you're confused about the menu, I was finally able to ask enough questions to clarify the options during a different visit. During weekdays Monday-Friday, all you can eat options are available. It's about $16 for lunch and $20 for dinner, if I remember correctly. For weekends, that option is only available for parties of 6+. During weekdays, you can order off of the \\"picture menu\\" (for lack of better terms) basically it's a laminated menu that's one sheet front and back with 3 different specials: one smaller portioned lunch special for $9.99, and two different tiers of lunch/dinner specials. For these specials, no substitutions are allowed, but you are able to order \\"a la carte\\" options and add it on to those specials. On weekends, if I remember correctly, they only do \\"dinner\\" pricing and add a $5 charge to each special. Hopefully this clears up some confusion and saves you some time when it comes to ordering!"},{"name":"Rogue Eastside Pub & Pilot Brewery","address":"928 SE 9th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Attention, make sure you go to Goodwill and get yourself a flowered club shirt that would rival Charlie Sheen's wardrobe because on Tuesday it's Hawaiian shirt day! Just come bearing your most hideous flowered prints to receive a free pint of beer! Don't fuss over your appearance too much because the 50 beers on tap at Green Dragon will surely activate everyone's beer goggles anyway. \\n\\nI'm probably going to need a mulligan at this brew pub, I liked the venue but there were a few things that made it less appealing. First logistics, they've chosen to split the taps here with 20 up front and 30 in the back. Why exactly the larger tap is located in back is a mystery to me because logic would prove more beers will be ordered from there. I suppose this concept is fine for patrons sitting in the back, however if like me and you're sitting up front this placement seems to really effect the service. Your server will now be required to hot foot it across the bar to retrieve your libation and do you know how many patrons he or she will encounter along the way? My experience was a lot because ours stopped to strike up several conversations as I impatiently waited for my beer. Maybe our server just suffered from A.D.D. but I wished he'd focus his priorities because each minute longer made my ice cold refreshment slip away. Then there's that, cold wasn't something I felt much inside because it was hot and not in a Paris Hilton kind of way. My beer felt warm and my back warmer as the windows of the RV sized door beside us magnified the sun's rays and lit me up like those poor ants when I was a kid. I'd assume they'd open said door during the summer months to allow fresh air in but maybe on Hawaiian Tuesday's we are trying to simulate the heat of an island sun or rather being in the belly of a fiery green dragon?  \\n\\nStill no one can argue the pleasure of consuming a free beer and paying a cheap check just for showing off some botanical cheer!

It would be good to have some dipping sauces at least included in the AYCE, as most people tend to eat hot pot with the dipping sauces. Overall the atmosphere, experience, and food was just okay.

I liked that the top part of the paper covering on the straws was left on, for the individual to uncover themselves. The Sizzler Steak was decent. Not the most tender but good. And hot. 3. I tried the ribeye my uncle ordered and that was better. My aunt had a steak sandwich thing which was tasty. 4. Including a glass of wine and a gingerale, between 5 it was $150 ish dollars. That's 30 a person, and 2 of them were 5 year olds. Kinda pricy, and it was good, but maybe not the best restaurant for a $30 dinner. That being said, it was full.

My brother always likes the Beef with green onion with Oyster sauce, but he was severely disappointed. He said it had absolutely no taste. They even charge $2 per small bowl of rice, when most places just give you rice. As an added disappointment, they said they could not take my credit card since it was under CS$50. However, they never posted anywhere about the minimal spending and that could really be a problem for people who don't usually carry cash with them.

Compared to those Korean mum and pop place, I think Toji is a bit more Americanized with the \\"sweeter, saltier, and less spicy\\" Korean food. Nonetheless, their food is pretty good. I especially like their soup and noodle soup. My boyfriend loves their bento. Grilling on the table is always fun. They have a wide variety of banchan and they often come up with new ones.\\n\\nService is great compared to other Asian places. The servers are helpful and friendly. Your water glass and tea cup will never be empty, and you don't need to hunt them down to ask for an extra napkin. The Korean servers have poor English, but they've never gotten my order wrong before. One lady in particular has MAD memory. I went with 6 or 7 friends on my birthday and we ordered at least 8 different dishes. That lady memorized ALL of them. No notepad. No mistake whatsoever.

The lighting might be too dim for some people, but I think it creates a nice atmosphere.\\n\\nAs odd and irrelevant as this may sound, I like their restroom. It's very clean and not stinky at all (unless you go in there right after someone took a dump). Most restaurants often neglect the cleanliness of their restrooms.\\n\\nPrice is kind of high and you don't get a whole lot for the price you pay. I guess, you're not just paying for the food at this restaurant but also the service and environment. It's not a 5-star restaurant, but it's not one of those typical Asian restaurant with no mood and service. \\n\\nParking is kind of limited on their busy days. They have a very small parking lot that they share with another store. There are street parking, but it's rare to find one (especially on Hawthorne). \\n\\nIf you want to take your friend(s) from out of town to a nice Korean/Asian place, I think Toji is a good choice.

I am a big taco person so you have to understand I was jumping for joy to know something was coming locally. \\n\\nSo I waited and waited and finally it opened this past Saturday. We came in the afternoon and there were already a few people inside but considering it was the grand opening, there wasn't a lot of people. \\n\\nWe went in and the decor was extremely nice. I loved the fairy lights and the rustic look to it all. Very clean, and very bright with very big windows. \\n\\nWhen we first walked in, we were greeted by what seemed to be either the owner or manager. Very nice man, and he made sure we felt welcomed. \\n\\nWe continued to look at the menu and considering we already had lunch prior, we opted for just a few tacos. My brother ordered the pork and beef taco, while I ordered the chicken and the tuna taco. They also had an assortment of hot sauces which is really cool. \\n\\nInitially I was a little bit disappointed in the size and also the amount of ingredients for the tacos. For the most part, it had a good amount of vegetables and sauce, but the actual meat/fish was lacking considering it was a $5-6 taco. If it was 3-3.50 like Sal Y Limon, I wouldn't be disappointed, but for 5-6 bucks you'd expect a little bit more.\\n\\nFrom least favourite to favourite..\\nChicken taco was the least favourite as it had the least meat. The flavours were decent but nothing spectacular. \\nTuna taco I was hesitant on because of the wasabi and I am not a big fan of wasabi, but to my surprise this taco was my favourite. It was light and well flavoured. \\nBeef taco was alright, but my brother mentioned the beef was a bit too chewy.\\nPork taco had the most flavour and he liked that one the most. \\n\\nHowever, the one common thing I disliked about the tacos was the hardness of the flour tortilla. They should be softer and not as firm. This made the whole taco texture something less to be desired. \\n\\nSo to recap, 1. Wasn't enough meat  2. Price was high considering what you get 3. Tortillas were hard 4. Some tacos lacked overall flavour.\\n\\nAs much as I wanted to love this place and make it my go to taco shop in coquitlam, I just don't think at its current state I would make that call.\\n\\nIt's definitely worth a try if you're into tacos and in the area, and I haven't tried the bowls or the quesadilla's yet which I probably will.

You stand in line and they serve you when you get to the front. Only one person is tending the drink line at a time, though I think the food line person sometimes assists. For a place this popular, on a Saturday night, why are you so short staffed? There should be at least 3 people manning the taps. I spent almost a third of the time there standing in line to order instead of sitting and enjoying my drink. Knowing this, I stood with a half-finished drink to pass the time, but that is sub-optimal. Recommendation: Arrive off-hours if you can, or else come with a group so that you can designate one person to stand in line and bring back drinks for the lot, or at least all stand together.\\nSo yeah, actually, overall I guess it's 3.5 - 5 for the beer, 2 for the line waiting.

When I found out that she opened a restaurant in Boston in the Fenway area I was ecstatic. I've heard mixed reviews on the establishment, more positive reviews than negative reviews. My son in I being in the area decided to go there to give them a try. We ordered 1lb of beef brisket, 1 rib, and 1 biscuit to share between the two of us. The best part of the meal was the biscuit!! Soft, flaky, buttery, and warm are the words that comes to mind with their biscuits. The one biscuit was truly worth the $3.50. I thought the worse part of our meal would be the one rib that we ordered for $3.50 which came out a very dry and flavorless piece of meat. Boy was I wrong, the worse and most expensive part of our meal at $23/lb was the god awful brisket! At first taste I said not bad, upon eating more of the meat I noticed a tremendous amount of fat. This is acceptable for me because it's brisket, but then I noticed the lack of smoke rings and that there was a strong unnatural taste and smell that I experienced with each bite. . . well after further tasting and smelling I realized what it was, liquid smoke! We took the remaining brisket home and headed straight to the cabinet to grab the bottle that we had in the back of the cardboard and as soon as we opened the top the smell and taste of the brisket was exactly identical!!!! At $23/lb an unnatural liquid smoke smell, taste, and flavor is the last thing I want to experience on my meat. Knock about $5 or so off of that price maybe, just maybe this would be a little acceptable but for this price, shame on this restaurant for misleading untrained taste buds.

My verdict - this is one of the most confusing buffets I have ever seen. Watermelon and pineapple? Check. Chicken flautas? Check. Bresaola? Yep. Pudding?

And even tho I consider myself a \\"pro\\" drinker, two of these always gives me the warm-and-fuzzies inside. \\n\\nI would have to agree that this place has a decent Italian veneer.

I finally had the opportunity recently with a large work group to check it out.  We made reservations in advance for a group of 11, and were seated once all our group arrived.  The service was phenomenal.  The easiest way with this large of a group is to just order the entire pre fixe menu and share.  We all got to taste a bit of everything.  Located on Rainy Street, Emmer & Rye has all the ingredients for being a stuffy and pretentious ambiance (great location, great wine and cocktail menu, made from scratch, farm to table sourced ingredients, small plates, seasonal rotating menu) but in the execution it is not. The staff were knowledgeable and friendly.  The environment is inviting, casual and warm. I felt that the price tag here actually met the quality of the experience and food.  Everything on the menu was tasty, and plated beautifully.  Each dish was an art piece.  Everything was full of flavor and tasted fresh. All the bread and pasta are made in house, and you can taste the quality difference.  I was enjoying my meal so much that I almost forgot to snap photos.  Thankfully my colleagues kept reminding me of my Yelp duty! I missed only one shot of my favorite dish - the Short Rib Carnitas.  Paired with the White Sonora roti it was INCREDIBLE and melted in my mouth.  The menu stand outs of the night for me were the Red Snapper, Buckwheat Tajarin, White Sonora Wheat Baguette, Short Rib Carnitas, and the Prple carrot cake for dessert.  \\n\\nAt the end of the meal when we got up to leave, the staff realized that some of us had white paint on our rear ends.  They had recently painted the chairs, and thought they were all dry. They were very apologetic and gave business cards to each of us kissed by the white paint.  They asked us to send in receipts for new clothing to replace those damaged and provide them with contact information for reimbursement.  WOW!  Talk about on the spot amazing customer service. We wouldn't even have noticed walking out.

They actually added fried lemon slices to it that gave it an extra zing! So good that we ordered fried lemon slices although they're not offered on the menu. We also ordered the sweet rolls on the appetizer menu and really, they tasted like the Hawaiian bread sold in grocery stores.  Generally, the bread is a freebie but not in this case.

They only had three options for the tacos and none of them were tickling my fancy. So we settled on the \\"queso\\". I put quotations because normally queso is melted cheese that's liquid form in order for you to dip you chips... this was more I guess you could say it was like queso fundido.... it was just cheese that had been melted yet still stringy and stiff. Like the cheese topping on your pizza or the cheese on grilled cheese. Of course it's cheese, so my boyfriend enjoyed it but he definitely said he wouldn't call it queso.

Flatbread was soft with a bit of a crunch, topped with a small amount of sauce, pepperoni, sausage, and mozzarella cheese\\n* Baby back ribs - was nicely grilled and smothered in a succulent BBQ sauce. The fries was fried to a golden brown and the coleslaw was satisfactory though it didn't have that tart acidic taste I usually detect when eating coleslaw \\n\\nThough I didn't have enough time to have a dining experience at Tony Toma's, I did enjoy the food.

It was Dine Out and the restaurant was active but not full.  We dine out frequently throughout the year, but thought it was a good chance to try Cafe Il Nido, which for some reason escaped our notice.  The room was cosy and pleasant, and the noise level very low, both which recommended Cafe Il Nido to us.  Even though there seemed to be a lot of staff about so that we were never kept waiting for long, the service was very impersonal and at times quite brusque.  It may have been the owner who hurriedly took our orders, but others served us, and I don't believe we got a smile the whole evening.  The menu choices were varied and the dishes were fairly well-done, but the osso buco which two of us had was under-braised so that it was actually very tough to cut off the bone, instead of being meltingly tender as we're used to.  The meager vegetables served alongside our mains were a little disappointing.  Afterward, the group of us compared notes and felt that while it was an okay experience, it felt really flat, and with all the choice of restaurants in Vancouver, we won't return.  The comparison that really hurt was that a few days later we went to another Dine Out restaurant for the same $40 price, and it was incredible: the menu choices exciting, beautifully cooked and presented, and the service was lively and attentive.

I called earlier in the week to make the reservation for 13 and pay the deposit which I was adamantly told the cover charges for everyone HAD to be paid prior to the day of. No problem, gave my card to the manager at which point he told me that he'd be charging me. The day of comes, we arrive, everything is fine. We ordered our drinks and meals. The drinks (old fashion) were made very poorly for those who ordered it. When we told the server she said the bartender is the owners gf so she can't do much. The same drink on different bills ranged from $12-15. They may charge you for a double even when you specifically order a single. \\nOn top of that they charged me for 4 drinks when I had 2 & charged me for 2 entrees when I ordered 1. \\nThey charged us the automatic gratuity for a large party which is understandable, however they put the \\"cover charge\\" on the bill, so it increased the bill and then charged gratuity on that total. Everyone basically paid gratuity on their cover charge. Super shady. \\nWhen I spoke to the manager all he said was, Sorry, & provided no explanation of why he told me that it needed to be prepaid asap and later decided not to charge until the day of. Clearly, it was to increase everyone's bill for the purposes of gratuities, that extra adds up for large parties. Again, sketchy. \\nI believe there is new management or a new owner but its definitely not the same classy, well run & organized place that I remember. \\nWe had to continuously look for our as ever bc she was either overextended or not paying attention. Regardless, not a good experience, I won't be back. \\nWe had to check every single thing that was done or said. This is not where you want to go after a long work week to relax and unwind. The music was the best part. The food is okay. \\nThis place is more ideal if you just want to go somewhere for a glass of wine and to hear great live music. \\n\\nADVICE IF YOU GO: \\n*Don't order the 1 cocktail they make, the Old Fashion (its orange & very sweet) awful and pricey. Stick to wine/beer.\\n*Check your bill, they like to slip extra items on your bill.\\n*Make sure that if you go with a large group that the cover is paid prior so that it's not apart of the percentage that determines the tip. \\n*Understand that if you go there it's not for anything more than the live entertainment."},{"name":"Leonardo's Pizzeria","address":"16505 SE 1st St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Yum!

We found out that he was the only person tending to the bar and dining room all night. There were tables standing up waiting to pay, we found ourselves in the same situation over an hour later. Randomly, during our ~20min wait as we were done hoping for the bill, someone who appeared to be in management stopped by and asked how our food was and then he was gone. Even knowing there was another staff member in the building that whole time made us wonder why we we're completely unattended and this poor waiter was truly in the weeds. \\n\\nI understand the staffing in the service industry can be difficult and unpredictable so I do hate to comment so much on it, but I hope this isn't something other people experience! \\n\\nIf you've gotten this far in my review, please note: the service we did receive was friendly, but noticeably stressed, and the burgers, sweet potato, and truffle fries were really good!

I got two scoops in a waffle cone; Strawberry and What the Fudge. We like all of the seven flavors (the only flavor we didn't try was Coconut brownies & cream). They are creamy, and not too sweet!

They are striving for higher end but fall short. For starters, 13$ on the low end for a glass of wine - that is fine -But it is a 3oz pour. Keep in mind most places, including Grill 23, a glass of wine is 6oz or 9oz for a small up charge.  If you want a 6 oz glass of wine here that will be 26$.  Keep in mind that it was a 12$ bottle of wine that won the international wine festival. Let's say they are serving wines that cost them 50$ a bottle (I highly doubt it) - they are still charging you 26$ for a small! glass.  Now the food: I had the crab & avocado eggs Bene & it was reasonably priced at 18$ And it was quite good But I do not think there was even 2 tablespoons of crab meat. I wanted& expected \\"crab meat\\" bene and I would not have minded paying $26 for a generous amount of crab meat - hrmph!  The bene did come with perfectly cooked potatoes & a solo asparagi lol- never been served one piece of asparagus - how about 3 or 4?

When our three dishes arrived, the potatoes were underdone and not edible; the back bacon was not omitted on a benny and there was no butter on an order of sourdough toast. There were no other customers in the restaurant so what could the problem be - certainly not busy staff. The waitress failed to return to check on our experience. In fact, one of our party had to leave the table to get her own butter for the sourdough toast and syrup for pancakes!

We booked our reservation for Valentine's Day dinner in advance, and as we were seated nearly on top of our fellow diners we looked puzzlingly at each other as to why they were packing folks in so tightly. I asked the hostess for a new table and mentioned the fact that a nearby open table was where I had proposed to my wife. An emotionless reply of \\"oh that's nice\\" further confused us until our server arrived. \\"Yeah so there's new management, there have been some changes...\\"\\n\\nIndeed. The prices have either stayed the same or increased, some new dishes were added, but the portion sizes reduced, in some cases drastically. We would typically split four or five tapas plates and be satisfied; seven plates later during this dinner and we were still hungry. The tab was eclipsing $100 for seven mediocre plates and a pitcher of sangria, so we paid our bill, left a healthy tip for our waitress, and left. The food wasn't bad... it simply wasn't a hundred dollar meal.\\n\\nI'm sure Valentine's Day is a big earner for both a restaurant and its staff, yet no communication with their customers was made that the menu had changed or that the restaurant was under new ownership. Instead, the messaging was left to the servers, who seemed almost apologetic about the changes. At best this is poor management, but for such a neighborhood staple and on such a busy night was a glaring oversight that felt deliberate and disingenuous.\\n\\nBest of luck to the next chapter in Tasca's history.

Got in a bit before the dinner rush, maybe 5:30-ish. There was a momentary look of panic on one of the hosts when we said that we didn't have a reservation, then a look of relief when we asked to sit at the bar (our preference).  Fun thing about sitting at the bar - if it's not crazy busy, chatting with the bartender can be very informative about the menu and the restaurant in general.\\n\\nWe took a look at the drink menu - only four beers on tap - and ordered.  I wasn't sure about one of the beers and the bartender easily offered a taste which I accepted and ended up ordering.  A German lager, nice and perfect for my non-hoppy palate.\\n\\nRenata has an all-day happy hour menu and from that, we ordered the marinated olives ($8) and the pork rinds ($7).  These came quickly and the still-warm dish of olives was overflowing with not just a few varieties of olives but also some carrots and greens.  Very tasty and the pork rinds had a good crunch to them, but were a bit bland to my taste.\\n\\nFor our dinner, we ordered the Belgian Endive salad ($12), the Tagliatelle ($21), and the mixed sausage grill ($30).  I really enjoyed the Endive salad.  The buttermilk herb dressing had a pleasant subtlety to it and was not overwhelming.  The Tagliatelle was nicely aromatic and the Oregon truffle included, while pronounced, was not overwhelming.  As for the sausages, they may have been the weaker part of the meal.  The lamb was interestingly sweet, the pork was less flavorful than I would have expected.  But the beef was a pleasant surprise - nicely rounded with flavor and not dry as we might have expected.\\n\\nOverall, we had a positive experience here.  Final bill was $88 plus tip.

We were there to eat sushi, and maybe that was our mistake. They are mostly known for their Korean BBQ, which we didn't have. The sushi was good, but not great.

It's been a while (i.e., college) since I've been. I never remember the name of this place but stumbled upon in on Yelp, so I'm likely writing the most non-useful, funny, or cool review ever. This is really just so I won't forget what this place is called.\\n\\nFor college students and people just visiting, you're not likely to end up here. For the razzle dazzle, there's Uchi to the south, and for penny-pinchers, there's places like Kyoto or Mikado. However, if you've got a father staying in the Arboretum for business and raking in the per diem, then this is a great location. Hence, how I ended up here (thanks, Dad!).\\n\\nThe one thing I remember about this place is the avocado kama, which the girlfriend absolutely loved. This was back when she wasn't a fan of raw fish (don't worry, she's slowly been convinced). She did however love all things green, and thus the avocado kama was the perfect choice. I actually prefer it to Uchi's avo bake; Musashino's tastes less salty.\\n\\nAs for the sushi, the reviews are true. It's one of the fresher options in Austin.  Don't worry; you're paying for the quality. I also recall the rolls having some American-sounding names, something you don't normally see in a traditional Japanese joint.\\n\\nLast word of advice: skip the Chinese restaurant that's connected upstairs. It's definitely not as authentic as what you'll find on the first floor."},{"name":"Musashino Sushi Dokoro","address":"2905 San Gabriel St, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I really like Musashino.

They are also great and I enjoy them very much. Each have their time and place. Musashino is great for families and non-kiddo peeps as well. Our young daughter loves this place and we save the swank for when we call a date night just for the grown ups. \\n\\nWhat I like most about Musashino is the combination of really well prepared and high-quality food paired with a comfortable and authentic environment. It just flows organically without any sense of trying to be what it is. Very attentive service and support team, all taking their jobs very seriously. The service ranges from pretty good to fantastic. The house-made unfiltered sake is a great addition to any meal. Make sure you listen to the specials as they can be the gems of the evening. I'm a tough one to please, with standards that can be unattainable for many places. I've seen other lower star reviews and would recommend they try again.

All the food I have had is great, but I have some other issues that are going to keep me from coming back very often.\\n\\n1. Menu - the menu descriptions are vague and I'm not exactly sure what I will be getting.   For example \\n\\n\\"Chicken Terrine - cheddar-broccoli puree, florets, confit mushrooms\\".  \\n\\nI really have no idea what I am getting.  Is it a chicken breast, a casserole, etc.?  I asked tonight and the guy at the counter said it is kind of like sausage.  Huh?  If I had ordered this and gotten chicken sausage, I would have been pissed.  I haven't been to France and I'm not that familiar with French Food, so help me out with the menu descriptions.  \\n\\nI mentioned this once to the person at the counter and she said they want people to ask about the food so they can describe it.  Unfortunately, when I went in tonight, the person at the counter had no idea on several of the items and I was left without any confidence on what I was going to get.  Because of this, I have defaulted to the burger several times, which is pretty awesome!\\n\\n2. Serving sizes - Tonight I ordered the gnocchi parisienne to go.  I asked for it without eggplant.  The cost is $11.99 and there is not meat product.  I got the to go bag and it seemed very light.  I got home and was shocked at the serving size.  The container holds about 16 fluid ounces of water.  It was less than half full of the gnocchi and while there was plenty of onion, there were no tomatoes.  I know that in the US most restaurants have serving sizes that are way too large, but this was a little ridiculous.  Most restaurants serve appetizers that are larger than this entree.  I called about the missing tomatoes and they apologized and said they would take care of me next time I came in, but not sure what that will mean.\\n\\n3. Ordering - I agree with everyone else.  If I go somewhere that serves wine, I will usually want a second glass.  I don't want to go wait in line and have a second charge to my card.  Hopdoddy does something similar, but at least they have the table service.\\n\\n4. Product availability -  I have ordered several times and have been told that they are out.  Tonight, they had smores listed as a special dessert.  The guy in front of me tried to order the smores and was told they were out.  I have had the same thing happen with other items.\\n\\nSo to sum it up, the food has always been very good, but there are too many negative factors for me to give more than 2 stars and want to go back (except maybe for the burger - at least I leave full with that meal)."},{"name":"AFURI ramen + dumpling","address":"50 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Delicious ramen.

And dare I say it, but those fruit and vegetable concoctions were delicious and worth every penny - I'm almost tempted to hire one of them to make juices and smoothies for me all day, every day. \\n\\nFirst, the location is awesome - it exudes Austin and is so hipster I love it. It has a ton of cool trinkets, shirts, and other items for sale. Also, there's a ton of area for seating both inside and outside on the patio. The staff is super inviting and really helpful if you want help making a choice from all the great options. Anddd, I might even ditch my favorite coffee shop and opt for JuiceLand instead when I have work to get done because there is free wi-fi!! They know how to steal my heart. \\n\\nThe highlight is of course their fresh juices and smoothies. I'm not a Michael Pollan fan, but man, he would be so proud of me. I'm obsessed with the smoothies and they are a great meal substitute when you're on the go. My absolute favorite is the Tikal - made from pineapple, papaya, supergreens, lime, and mint. MINT. I love mint. Mostly because it reminds me of mojitos, and this smoothie was just as tasty (I didn't know that was possible!). I loved it - the mint really shined through and added so much to the smoothie. There were also real pieces of papaya, which was delicious. I would highly recommend this one. \\n\\nI also really like the Peachy Green smoothie, which is spinach, kale, apple, and peach all blended together to make some delicious goodness, especially when it's hot outside. It's the perfect summer smoothie. They also have the \\"regular\\" berry smoothies such as the Brazilian Kisses smoothie if you don't want to go out on much of a limb, but my theory is, if you're going to pay $5-7 for a smoothie, I say try something new!! Any of their \\"Next-Level Smoothies\\" are REALLY good - I recommend Vegetable Kingdom or Morning Sunshine. \\n\\nThe smoothies are delicious, the place is quirky and quaint, the staff is helpful, however, the prices are a bit steep. Although I can't always flush out approximately $6 for a smoothie, JuiceLand is a great treat.

I think part of the price point is the area-- Newbury is a great shopping destination and the porch at Stephanie's is so nice and relaxing!\\n\\nI ordered the pesto farfalle (which comes with tomatoes, arugula, zucchini, etc.) and was really impressed with the freshness of the ingredients. The tomatoes especially complimented the pesto, and the portion size was hefty. \\n\\nAs for service, the hostess was not very friendly or welcoming. The waiter was nice, but he didn't really check on us. He did come over toward the end of our meal to offer coffee, which we declined and  asked for the bill instead. He never brought it over so we ended up having to flag him down for it. It wasn't a big deal to us, as we were just chatting, but I could see it being a hinderance to someone else who was maybe in a rush to leave.\\n\\nI would be open to coming back (especially if I had someone visiting from out of town) or if I was already in the area with friends, but I wouldn't necessarily make a special trip to come here.

I had read how other vegan yelpers commented on how good the vegan burritos were. Well I was not eating those burritos. It was disappointing. I got the burrito vegetariano I got mines vegan, i asked for no rice because I don't care for that fried rice that is usually cooked with chicken bullion cubes; and most of those are loaded with so much sodium. I really don't know how Nayar taqueria makes their rice. But I wasn't taking a chance. So the burrito was ok but not good. It was small and their wasn't much to it. I was hoping it was going to be big and full. But instead it was skinny and did not hold together as I munched on it. I like corn but not in my burrito. (My fault I should have asked for no corn)  it was out of place. It didn't enhance the burrito or add some special flavour. It was just grains of yellow corn floating around in my beans. I asked if they had roasted chilli peppers and ordered 2. Guess what? It's $1 for each chilli peppers! What?  The bloke at the till told me they cost $1 because they are big ones. At most places a$1.50 will get you 3 or  4 chillis and roasted onion. So I don't know why Nayar Taqueria feels they have to jack up the price for some thing that is not expensive. \\nAnother thing that made me feel no love; their was nothing else on my plate just the burrito. I know I ordered a burrito what should I expect other then what I ordered. They gave us 2 plastic bottles of salsa. I can't lie their was nothing memorable about the salsas. I tried a little of the red salsa on my burrito once but didn't want any more after that. So I looked around to see if their was a salsa bar and nope; no salsa bar.  . \\nMy friend liked his Chicken enchiladas. Said they were good. The chicken was moist and he really enjoyed the whole plate. Which came with beans and rice. His only small bleep was the portion was to small.\\nIf I was in the area I might come back.

Not traveling very far from home, I arrived at Chubby's Family Restaurant in East Orlando right around 7:30 and there were already patrons sitting outside and inside (was a bit of an older crowd). Definitely a diner where \\"everybody knows your name\\" (hope the younger people get that reference...haha). The restaurant is located in a commercial strip center off Colonial Blvd. I almost missed the place because their main sign just says \\"Restaurant\\" - the name Chubby's was on a smaller fabric sign posted on the window.  \\n\\nParking was ample and I made my way into the joint. Upon entry, the waitress hollered, \\"sit anywhere you like\\", so I made my way to a booth tucked away on the side of the building (always excited when I get a booth). I had not been seated more than a few seconds when the waitress dropped off the menu and asked my choice of beverage. The coffee was good (and I got a big mug,yay!!) but I didn't like they only had Sweet n Low for sugar substitute and half and half for the cream option (think I am spoiled???).  Perusing their menu, I was intrigued by the selection of skillets (I'm thinking they were named after the waitress/patron that created the dish). It was a toss between the hash skillet and the ham skillet and I end up choosing Gloria's skillet (the ham) because I was in the mood for hash browns (the hash skillet came with home fries and, yes, I am sure they would have substituted for me but I needed something to break the tie and that is my excuse ) The waitress was very nice and recommended the home made biscuits instead of toast and she was not wrong (in fact, it was the best part of the meal). Gloria's skillet was good (diced ham and onions with cheddar cheese on top of hash browns with two eggs nestled on top of that) but nothing to write home about. I will say this...it did arrive in a ceramic skillet and it was actually reasonably sized (not a giant heap of food that only a man four times my size would be able to finish at one sitting).  This place is more for the regulars to gather and catch up on life, not for experimenting with finer cuisine . So, in my opinion, the decor has to be the reason this joint made the list. There were sections of each wall dedicated to old icons including  Betty Boop, I Love Lucy, James Dean and many more. I enjoyed looking around while filling myself with my breakfast skillet. \\n\\nAll in all, a typical diner experience with a twist on the decor. \\n\\nTwo down, eighteen to go!!! \\nEnjoy breakfast, it starts your day right!!"},{"name":"Harlow","address":"3632 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The quality gets worse and worse.

However, I see several misguided reviews here on Yelp so I feel the need to chime in.  If you are seeking truly exceptional Tokyo-style sashimi, nigiri, and maki there is only one place to go in Austin, and that place is Musashino.  \\nFrankly, I almost hesitate to write a review because Musashino already does such great business that you can often expect an hour or more wait on weekends.  While I don't want it to get over-crowded, I definitely want the best for Smokey and the gang as they've been such a big part of my Austin life for so long.  I took my wife there on our first date and year later proposed to her there.  So, take my review for what it is...a long time friend and fan of Musashino setting the record straight.  \\n\\nNow, what makes Musashino so good?  The fish, the talent, the ambiance, and the fish.  Oh yea, and the fish.  \\n\\nFish - Let's start with the fish.  Most sushi restaurants get their fish from standard foodservice supply companies.  They have the typical yellowtail and salmon but nothing exotic.  Better sushi restaurants have specialty seafood suppliers shipping from the coasts.  These might occasionally have toro (bluefin fatty tuna) and better shellfish selections but nothing from Japan.  Finally, the very select few..the best of the best will have a lot of their fish broker-selected from the Tokyo fish market and overnighted to the restaurant on a regular basis.  There are only a handful of places in the country that do this and there are two are here in Austin that I know of.  Musashino and Uchi. Most upscale sushi places you go in NYC, SF, LA, Chicago will have toro, but rarely will they have several grades (toro, chutoro, otoro..) at once.  You can find all of them every weekend at Musashino, as well as exotics like giant clam, japanese scallop, shima-aji, spanish mackerel, arctic char, and much more.  YES, this fish is going to be more expensive..OF COURSE it is.  It comes from the best supply in the world. \\n\\nTalent.  There are lots of talented sushi chefs in Austin.  Uchi is mentioned a few times in these reviews and as I just said they get fish direct from Japan as well.  Tyson Cole created Uchi after his six years of apprenticeship at...guess where...Musashino.  Cole is very talented and he learned and developed much of that talent from Musashino's proprietor, chef, and sushi master Takehiko Fuse (friends call him Smokey).  Cole was smart to turn his style away from traditional Tokyo style sushi and do more trendy fusion style.  Smokey meanwhile continues to serve the very best sushi in Austin in both traditional and creative styles.  Smokey's right hand man and sushi rockstar these days is Kazu, another amazingly talented and creative sushi chef.  Trust me..Smokey and Kazu and the rest of the crew at Musashino know what they are doing.  \\n\\nAmbiance.  If you are looking for flashy neon, bad Korean techno, glass and steel...you should look elsewhere.  Musashino is traditional Tokyo style from the teak wood sushi bar to the pufferfish lamps.  Smokey has created a warm and inviting environment that honors the traditions of sushi.  Musashino has been successful for decades because it is like a comfortable home for the best sushi in town.  \\n\\nHow do I compare Musashino?  Well, in the 90s I lived in Dallas and San Francisco and found the best of the best sushi I could.  Business has taken me to Japan half a dozen times over the years and I searched out the best sushi I could find there as well.  I can honestly say that Musashino is as good or better than any I have had in the States, and on par with the best neighborhood places in Shinagawa, Ginza, or Shibuya.  \\n\\nSo go to Musashino.  Expect a wait...it's worth it.  Get your pager, go upstairs to the bar they share with Ronald Cheng's Chinatown, and have Henry make you a fantastic cocktail or pour you some cold Onigoroshi.  If you know sushi, you already know to sit at the bar and talk with the chefs to get the best Omakase experience you can.  Put your trust in Kazu and Smokey.  You will not be disappointed.  Just don't tell too many people like I just did :)"},{"name":"Epicerie Cafe & Grocery","address":"2307 Hancock Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"It's been a while since I've eaten here and after the meal we just had, I'm wondering why!

For brunch, they have the standard things you'd expect- french toast, omelettes, eggs benedict, etc. Their drink menu is pretty solid too.\\n\\nI took 1 star off because they sell half of a grapefruit for $4.29 and a banana, apple, or pear for $3.95 LOL that's crazy... But other than that the pricing is in the standard $$ range and the portions definitely fill me up.\\n\\nService is decent. The place isn't super big so you might have to wait during peak weekend brunch times, but it's still less crowded than the Thornton's on Huntington Ave. \\n\\nOverall I'd recommend this place for brunch.

My girlfriend was wanting one of the new ciabatta bread sandwiches, but as the guy behind the counter put all his weight on the blade trying to cut through the bread and pull it apart somehow not realizing how stale the bread was, she opted for another sandwhich. At that time he gave a little attitude, but did change the bread. He also just toasted the sandwhich with out asking if we wanted them toasted. The final straw was when I asked for a cup for a drink and was informed the fountain machine wasnt working except the water. So I said that's fine I'll just have a big cup for water. She then proceeded to charge me 3+ dollars for a fountain drink . I was expecting maybe like a 50 cent charge for a cup, not a charge for a full drink I couldn't even have.

This place as you walk into the door you instantly are like \\"Oh! Cool!\\". You walk in over a tiny bridge and there are things hanging from the ceilings. Bamboo lines the ceiling and walls to give it the Tiki look. There are bright purple, red and green lights everywhere giving a dark fun vibe. The bar is set down low into the floor which really gives you a sight line straight to the back of the bar where they have statues and more islander decor.

I loved it.\\n\\nThe menu, I immediately ordered the sweet Hawaiian bread and we also got an order of the pickled eggs ( I didn't try the eggs). But the Hawaiian bread was so warm and crunchy and came with a delicious sauce. I would eat an entire loaf of it, but it is great with drinks. \\n\\nWe ordered the jet pilot and, well I cant remember the other drink names but I can say that the Jet Pilot comes with the magical fire show and is a ton of fun. The drink its self is strong! Sip slow! One got me going pretty well, but I am a whiskey and rum fan. One of the couples near us ordered the biggest drink that looks like a volcano and comes on fire, it says on the menu it is good for groups of 4 - 6 and its $40. My group wasnt upto trying it but when they brought it out to the other table the lights go lower and they have rain, thunder and lightning effects where you hear the rain and lightning and there are white lights that flash every few moments. It is like a show! They drop cinnamon onto the flame of the drink and it makes it all dramatic and fun. Totally love it. There are even smoke machines behind the benches that turn on and it fills the room and looks like fog.

The toasted cheese on top was just delightful and the crossiant was flaky and delicious.  I probably preferred the Frittata over the turkey and cheese, but just by a small margin.

Two friends and I sitting next to each other split the eggplant with spicy garlic sauce, the chicken with cashew nuts, and some vegetable dumplings and scallion pancakes for appetizers. The vegetable dumplings were great! They had an amazing umami mouth feel and I liked how substantial the wrapping was and how finely shredded the filling was. The eggplant was perfectly cooked and had a great flavor, not too spicy. I believe there were pieces of seaweed in the eggplant dish too which I really enjoyed. I think my favorite thing that we ordered was the chicken with cashew nuts. What was special about it for me was the fact that all of the components of the dish, the cashews, the water chestnuts, and the pieces of chicken were about the same size. This uniform dice made for a really cool textural experience, which was complemented by a delicious sauce.

I don't know if you know this, but the head bartender, Ran Duan, is kind of a big deal. The restaurant is in an historic mansion. The mix of fine cocktails and excellent Sichuan food in a quirkily juxtaposed atmosphere is charmingly confounding.\\n\\nI lived in China for a while, and I speak some Chinese (Mandarin). Our waiter was very cool when I slipped into Chinese. He spoke Chinese with me, but transitioned into English whenever I didn't understand. That was a lot of fun, but then he mysteriously disappeared and we got a different waiter, which was odd. The second waiter was professional and nice, but used only English. At the end of the night the first waiter reappeared again with our signed credit card receipt, which made it even odder. My fiance and I joked that the management got wind of the non-native Chinese speaker, and cut that off right away.\\n\\nThat's one cause for the 4 stars, but I doubt any other diner would experience that. The second reason is that we never got the appetizer we ordered, and the shredded pork with spiced tofu & cayenne chili had no pork in it; I'm pretty sure they brought us the wrong dish, but it was delicious anyway.\\n\\nRegarding drinks, we ordered the \\"bartender's choice\\" with the first waiter. He said that we needed to be at the bar, but he would ask since we were in the dining room. Eventually Ran Duan himself came to our table, asked which booze and flavors we liked, and created two excellent cocktails for us.\\n\\nAll in all a good place.

It was fairly busy. First, a girl working behind the counter, taking orders, asked us if she could take our order, however we were still deciding what we wanted. She acted annoyed. (We had literally just walked up!!) We placed our order with a guy who was very helpful. Here's the tricky part. We ordered 2 smoothies and after a minute, 2 smoothies showed up on the counter. They sat there for a while so we thought they were ours. That's my fault because I didn't ask. It turns out they weren't ours, but the guy who had ordered them apparently didn't know they were his either, because he was standing there the whole time just staring at them. Again, I admit this was my bad. I do wish they'd take names so that this kind of stuff doesn't happen. When there was confusion about the smoothies, I spoke up, admitting my mistake. That same girl that was rude to us at first rolled her eyes and acted so irritated. I already felt terrible about making a mistake and the eye roll just sealed it for me.

This just happened to be the closest place that came in our direction, no pre-planning involved. The menu is as extensive as you would expect from other Chinese eateries. A lot of the food has seafood. If seafood is not your thing it'll be hard to find something appetizing to eat. I had the house special spaghetti that had slices of ham in it topped with a fried  egg. My girlfriend had a seafood lasagna dish that was baked with a side of French toast. The French toast wasn't bad but I think this was the Chinese version of French toast which tasted a bit different. Either way I was OK with it. It didn't taste bad it was just different. This is more of a heads up. Both my girlfriend I shared a plate of the pineapple fried rice which was amazing.

This was a miss for a few reasons.\\n\\nFirst, service was extremely slow. We were 1 or 4 tables on the patio and probably 10 tables total between inside and the patio. The wait staff didn't have any sense of urgency. It's outside in the summer, so the flies were waiting for an opportunity to get on a plate. The wait staff didn't get our used dishes until we asked them to take them from the table.  Imagine a table full of plates that had donuts with sauce on one and entrees on two others. Oh, and cocktail glasses empty too.\\n\\nSecondly, of course I would order a steak here. The steak I ordered was supposed to be medium. It was cooked at the medium-well level. I didn't send it back like I would normally because my first point. The steak had very good potential but the flavor of pepper was sooo overpowering, I couldn't enjoy it like I normally would.\\n\\nThird, water refills and another round of drinks took forever. As a matter of fact, I had to ask 3 times to get a water refill. I mean, it's summer, I Georgia, I'm a patio - water should be he easiest to keep refilled. Our second round of drinks took another 15 mins to come. No doubt, the cocktails were amazing - totally forgot what my friend ordered, but it was so good I switched to a cocktail after my glass of Rose'. \\n\\nLastly, it was time for the check and our server took another 10 mins to bring it. On a normal Friday or Saturday that's totally understandable. But on a Sunday morning, with 4 tables, come on let's move. \\n\\nOverall, I might not go back. Drinks were great but the steak was meh.

It was beautifully presented. Thin slices of sushi with two kinds of sauce on the bottom and a little mouse or something on top.

The restaurant was quiet with one diner. We were greeted immediately and offered to sit where we liked so we picked the table by the window.  Our waiter came over with menu's quickly and offered drinks.  I ordered a hot tea (which came with an assortment of tea bags) and one friend a hot fruity drink (can't recall the name and she thought it was ok, not great).  We ordered two soups:  the vegetable quinoa and the white bean and chicken along with two appetizers to starts:  the veggie filled avocado and one each of the baked Saltenas (beef & chicken).  The soups were piping hot, very tasty but a bit on the salty side for all of us.  The appetizers were delicious. We liked the beef Saltena more than the chicken.  For our entrees, we split the Steak Tips over fries and rice (Lomo Saltado) and the Chiorzo.   The steak tips are cooked in a very light brown sauce with cooked sweet red onions served over the crispy thick fries with white rice on the side.  The chiorzo (two of them) is served over a toasted bun with lettuce and tomatos, a side salad with a very light dressing and these very yummy sliced yukon crisp potato slices with a spicy sauce drizzled over one end.  Service was excellent and the restaurant is VERY clean.  Without the groupon, our tab would have been around $50 without tip.

First thing I wanna say is if you're going to talk shit about customers you should probably make sure that they don't speak Chinese first. I'd been here once before with no issues, just the regular slow service. But this time, which will be the last time, was like a trip to crazy land.\\n\\nI didn't care about having to get my own menu, but then when buddy in his Hawaiian shirt came over to take our order and straight up prodded me with his pen because... he thought I was taking too long? I didn't even know what to say. For whatever reason, they couldn't do any shakes for \\"at least half an hour\\", and he suggested pop or beer. I said I could wait half an hour, and we ordered pho and a spring roll (big mistake).\\n\\nThe food came and the spring roll seriously looked like rotten ox penis. No joke. Don't order the spring rolls. \\"But just because they look terrible doesn't mean they aren't secretly delicious\\" is what I thought, and I was wrong. They were lukewarm, soggy in some parts and chewy in others (when was the last time they saw a deep fryer?) so we let the guy behind the counter know and he started arguing with us and asking what we wanted him to do about it. We said he could taste it if he wanted, but that it was clear that the spring rolls had been sitting, and we could either cancel the order or just get a fresh one. He started to raise his voice and cause a huge scene so we just said cancel the order.\\n\\nHe then proceeded to talk shit about us in Chinese to the cook and the other server and then gave our spring roll to another table \\"on the house\\" for them being such \\"great customers\\". That's after he used his hand to touch them to see if they were lukewarm when we brought it up. Ew.

We came in at 7pm and the place was pretty slow. The restaurant is one of a kind for someplace in the Midwest. The beer hall feel with the most uncomfortable benches I have ever sat on. There was no band or musical entertainment and happy hour was from 3-6pm so we just missed it. Our server and everyone we interacted with was pleasant. The portions and price on the food are twice what they need to be. For the Bier Cheese Chicken I received a plate with two chicken breasts and two massive heaps of mashed potatoes. I just don't enjoy paying 16$ for a massively oversized plate. I'd rather pay 9$ for a sensibly sized meal that I can eat in one sitting and not have leftovers. I personally wasn't super impressed with the food but my husband and our three other friends loved it. I think the mashed potatoes and saut√©ed peppers had a weird after taste. The bier cheese was watery. We also got the \\"Yard\\" sampler plate and I wasn't impressed with their flavorless fried pickles and I am crazy about fried pickles. The pretzels and deep fried  sauerkraut were good, but nothing to come back for. Overall I was really unimpressed and underwhelmed by the food. I'll be sending my leftovers with husband because I'm not interested in them. That tells you a lot about a place and their food if you don't even want your leftovers.

Based on reviews, I knew I was getting the fried stuffed olives and the squid ink pasta, which was gnocci on our night.  Neither delighted me ... I expected the stuffed olives to explode with juicy flavor in my mouth, but they were kinda dry, almost tasted like they were oven baked vs. fried.  The squid ink gnocchi was salty and the sauce overwhelmed the calamari that I eventually discovered in the dish. (Restaurant could use more light!) One friend's butternut (?) ravioli was delicious ... but another's pasta bolognese was on the dry side and simply not what she expected -- no tomato sauce.  Maybe it's authentic that way, but it didn't do anything for us. Sauteed greens were again way too salty for any of us. Above said, I'll give 2 big thumbs up for the desserts: the panna cotta with blood orange granita and sour cherry sorbet were both delectable.\\n\\nLooking at the dishes I see on Google that we didn't order, I'm thinking maybe we just didn't order the right things.

I ordered the Fuddo-Yama ramen, husband got the Black garlic ramen, and I got very excited by the Chashu fried rice because the photos on Yelp look very similar to my favorite yakimeshi from Ringer Hut. So we ordered the fried rice.\\n\\nThe Fuddo-Yama ramen was nice. Creamy, rich broth, lots of noodles. I wasn't a huge fan of the chashu pork, and there was only one small slice. Noodles were bouncy and chewy. The Black garlic ramen tasted similar to the Fuddo-Yama but with garlic oil in it. Couldn't really tell much difference, at least from one or two spoonsful. \\nThe fried rice did not taste like what I was hoping it would. It was a bit disappointing as it needed some salt or something to bring out the flavors. It was pretty lacking in any sort of flavor, to be honest. Also, I am allergic to eggs and I asked if they could make it without egg but was told no, as it's premade (and then reheated). I picked out the bits of egg I saw but it was difficult to see much - most of the yellow bits were corn. So allergy folks, beware.\\n\\nWhere does this place rank among my favorite ramen shops? Maybe 4th or 5th.

Well executed balls of dough with octopus in the middle and green onions, mayo and okonomiyaki sauce... If you've never tried these, you must.

For a restaurant on Disney World property, it is surprisingly affordable (especially when dining with a group). \\n\\nMy girlfriend and I ended up sharing a simple appetizer and one of their specialty pizzas. We had the Fritto di Verdura - crisp fried vegetables with a marinara dipping sauce. The vegetables included eggplant, zucchini, asparagus, artichoke heart (!!), and portabella mushroom. As you can see, I was particularly fond of the artichoke and was more than happy to enjoy the entire piece (as my girlfriend was not really into it). The best part though was the wonderfully sweet marinara sauce accompanying the dish. Excellent. \\n\\nWe ended up ordering a large wood-fired specialty pizza (Prosciutto e Melone). When it arrived we were a little taken aback at the sheer size. On the menu, it states that it would be suitable for 2-3 people. Well if it is for 2, they must be bringing quite an appetite - especially for lunch. If I were to do it again with just the two of us, I would have ordered an individual pizza for the two of us to share. It would have been the absolute perfect amount. \\n\\nThe pizza itself had a wonderful crust with a nice layer of fontina, mozzarella, and pecorino cheeses. However, knowing the quality of their marinara - I somewhat wish we would have ordered a pizza that had it. The prosciutto and the cantaloupe was an interesting combination but the prosciutto was entirely too large (with one piece covering almost the entire slice - and these were large slices). If the salty prosciutto would have been more contained and not dominated the overall experience, I think it would have been even more enjoyable. \\n\\nAs others have stated, if you want bread service, you must ask for it. Speaking of service, our server was very nice but quite new. He obviously was being watched over carefully as we had several individuals come to assist our table. Though he did a fine job, the amount of attention given to our table was a little off-putting.

Everything in general is overpriced. I absolutely cannot give a neutral review due to the bizarre circumstances we encountered last night.\\n\\nMy friend ordered a hot sake. It arrived, not steaming as it should, but we didn't really notice. She sipped on it quietly then asked me to try it. Her exact words: \\"Does this taste like water to you?\\"\\n\\nI wanted to believe it was sake. But no, I didn't really taste the alcohol. My boyfriend tried next. \\"Well, it smells like rice, that's a good start...\\" but he didn't exactly taste the sake either. Friend #3 tries, too. He thought something was up.\\n\\nJust as my friend contemplates how to awkwardly send the sake back, the server arrived with a fresh bottle. She said she tasted it in the back and realized something wasn't right. (How she was able to taste OUR bottle wasn't quite clear, but I digress.) She goes on to explain that she thinks someone was washing the sake bottles, left the warm water inside, and that's what we were served. That's right, world, they served us soap water.\\n\\nDid they comp the sake? Nope. We were planning to keep ordering drinks and appetizers but cut that short. When we received the bill and split it, the individual checks seemed high. I had checked the itemized receipt and it was correct. I grumbled about how much money I'd spent but didn't investigate.\\n\\nAfter we signed our bills, the manager walked over to inform us they'd accidentally overcharged us. He apologized and canceled our original checks and the split bills all came back $15 cheaper.

Had heard a lot about it and just never made a reso until this week. Overall, there is definitely the potential for me to come back and like this, but I don't fully understand the cart (even though I knew about it beforehand). My bf and I each ordered two dishes with a fifth dish to share. Immediately after we ordered a cart came by with three options - starving, we took a grain salad ($6). It was overly water-y and not worth $6. Next we got the carrots and these were really great. I enjoyed this dish a ton. Then came some sourdough toasts and the blue crab. I had seen rave reviews about the crab but I believe it has changed on the menu since other diners have been since this was super uninspired mango and cucumber noodles and cold crab in a bowl (again with a ton of unnecessary broth). I bit on a large shell piece and set it aside. The sourdough toast was surprising and very tasty. I could eat this for a light lunch. Then the cart came again, this time with a poached shrimp toast/cracker which was AMAZING. I thought this was easily one of the best dishes I've had recently and would come back just for that if it were on the menu. Then came the pork belly carnitas which our server told us was a smaller portion that day - she wasn't kidding! It was very small and (again) sitting in a broth. What is with this place and broths? Anyway, again the cart comes and it's johnny cakes. These were delightfully decadent and tasty, a fav for the bf. Last was the 'cacio de pepe' which is a very simple dish that I was sold on because of the in-house pasta. It was so disappointing both in flavor and texture.

A friend and I went to Emerald last night for some drinks for my birthday and it was awesome. I have to say I was really pleased with this place. As someone who doesn't love Boston's nightlife and wishes we had more upscale lounges, Emerald was a breath of fresh air. It definitely has a more NYC/Miami feel than most places in Boston and that is what I like about it. For those of you who don't know, it is located in the Revere Hotel near Park Plaza in the back bay (get off at Arlington T). \\n\\nI got there early because I had other birthday plans to attend to after but I wanted to make sure to stop by and try the drinks and see the place because I had heard good things from a friend. Aggelos knew it was my birthday and he took excellent care of me and my friend!! Thank you! He recommended their best drinks and we were sure to try them and they were awesome. I love a good craft cocktail and a good one can be hard to find but Emerald was great. They definitely have a tough balance to strike on weekend nights because they are making high end craft drinks in a fast paced environment where people don't want to wait long. I was there early (around 9) so I didn't have to wait long and I wouldn't have minded too much if I did because the drinks were great. I had the Vo-Jito first (blueberry mojito) and it was so yummy. It is dangerous because you could easily drink a few too many! The blueberries were muddled well so you really tasted their essence and the drink was smooth. My friend got the grapefruit cosmo and it was really good. She also got the Rosemary Smash which was also good and came with fresh rosemary as a garnish. I ordered the Fig Sidecar and it wasn't totally what I was expecting but I knew I was taking a chance because it was cognac. I am not the biggest cognac fan but I still enjoyed it. I would probably order the Vo-Jito or grapefruit cosmo over the Fig Sidecar but if you like cognac then this is a great choice and a unique flavor -- I don't see too many fig drinks too often.\\n\\nThe place is high end and they do have a dress code for men (collared shirts). The crowd tended to be in the 20s and 30s. They book private parties too in case you need a venue. Also, they have a dance areas w/bottle service that you can reserve. The venue is good because you can go dance in the back or be more low key and sit on the couches in the front. Also, they will be opening up a patio when it gets warmer and will be having a pool on top of the garage! Yes, please! \\n\\nI mean this may be weird but the bathrooms are wicked nice! Ha, who would have thought I'd be so excited over a bathroom. They were clean too. \\n\\nOur waitress was sweet and the hostess was great too. Aggelos has done a great job. I highly recommend this place if you want a swankier experience with good music, good vibes and great drinks. Price point for the cocktails --$13 but worth the price.

My entree was the Parmesan crusted chicken which turned out to be a grilled chicken breast with this creamy and slightly crunchy parmesan garlic cheese sauce. It certainly wasn't the most healthy thing in the world but it tasted good. Maybe a tad bit on the salty side but decent. I also had a side of mashed potatoes that I really didn't like.

My son had the chick, broc and ziti Alfredo and added marinara sauce, his preference, and enjoyed it very much.

In fact, we all brought home the leftovers and will enjoy tomorrow.  I did eat all my chicken but will eat the remaining fusilli for lunch tomorrow at work.  I had the house merlot, very generous pour, and it was smooth and enjoyable.  Our server, Alexa, was very attentive and pleasant, making our first time experience a definite plus!

Spacious, not jammed next to other diners.

The meats in the tray came in smaller portions than I expected, but I couldn't pick a favorite because they were all so good. They made up for the mediocre hot and cold sides, which were both just a waste of money. The mac n' cheese was bland and tasted like fake cheese, and the potato salad had a strange, unrecognizable tang to it.

The remaining half star is a generous round-up from 2 given that I have to give them some credit for the good times I've had here before.  All was undone, Alfredo's, with tonight's delivery service.  \\n\\nIn the past, I can vouch for the quality of the food we've gotten here; the Alfredo sauce is creamy, the fra diavolo is spicy and chock-full of yummy veggies, and the bread they give you I could eat and eat and eat.  The food is really not the problem so much, and I would probably recommend this place based solely on the menu.  I also haven't had too bad a time with delivery prior to this, but in a time when there's hundreds of places I can choose from, I would think everyone everywhere would be trying to hang on to the loyal customers they can, and what happened tonight was laughable.   \\n\\nWe ordered a standby, Alfredo with broccoli, and a new trek, toasted ravioli in marinara with meatballs.  We placed the order at about 6:15, thinking this was pretty early for a dinner rush on Friday.  I suppose we thought wrong.  The wait began.\\n\\nI called at about 25 mins past our ETA of 7:05, thinking of course that I could let a bit of time lapse given this is a bustling Friday night.  After much muffled confusion and lots of shouting back and forth of my address across their kitchen, we're told the delivery is on its way.   Hallelujah.  \\n\\nTwenty minutes later and we get the call.  Food downstairs.  I put aside my resentment for the wait and suddenly don't feel so bad that I wasn't able to tip over a dollar due to cash restraints, as shitty delivery doesn't really warrant much in the way of tip in my mind.  \\n\\nSo I hand the guy my cash, and he says, \\"come on, no tip for coming all this way? all the way to somerville?\\"  Uhhhh, I'm sorry dude, but maybe you shouldn't deliver to Somerville if the 7 min drive over is hurting your pockets that badly?  I'm extremely apologetic, mind you, instead of being the irate I should've been, and say that I'm sorry as much I can in edgewise.  The guy has the nerve to GO ON to say that they usually charge $3 for delivery....  is this supposed to be making me feel bad, or better?  Did you expect me to pull a wad of cash out and hand it to you?  Maybe you shouldn't offer free delivery if your delivery drivers are going to guilt people into tipping more, for what Google claims is a 3 mile drive from me.\\n\\nIn my opinion, tips are generally reserved to show gratitude for excellent service, not my food arriving 1 hour and 45 mins late with little explanation or apology.  Also, you usually wouldn't gripe your way into getting a bigger one when we're standing at my door an hour and 45 minutes after I've already decided I'm hungry and counted on your company to fix that problem.\\n\\nOn top of the audacity of this guy, I get upstairs to find that the Alfredo has congealed and clumped up on the pasta, lukewarm, and the toasted ravioli was covered in a slab of cold yet previously melted mozzarella, and the meatballs were a bit off, like heavy on some particular spice or another, and barely warm throughout.  Big thick breading on cheese ravioli, also not exactly what I was expecting either.  Totally disappointing. \\n\\nSorry, Alfredo's, but your lackluster delivery guy left a bad taste in my mouth, and I probably won't be trying any of your delicious food again (though I really, reaaally will miss the diavolo.

I can't even put this into words, it's an insult to longtime neighborhood customers like myself, and it's why I hadn't been back for several months. They have leaned so heavily on the Rogue brand that the place fairly reeks of tourist bait. They spent money on the dining room area but completely ignored the ratty bathrooms. Your $14 sandwich and $6.50 pint sure aren't buying new fixtures or lighting in the one area that stands out the most when the entire rest of the building gets repainted. \\nIn the years since I first stepped into the GD, this area has grown quite a bit, it's understandable from a business perspective why Rogue would slap their name all over the place, but the competition is still light years better - Loyal Legion has 100 taps compared to...however many are left here. And you won't see nearly the selection as the other places since this is now A ROGUE TAPHOUSE (blarf) - no sir, most of the taps are now Rogue products. They still claim '19 independent taps' but they tend to be the same breweries - ymmv there. \\n   Same space, totally different feel, and they blew it - the shade of red they picked is terrible.

The overall service was fair (I would say 3 stars, nothing spectacular). The waitress was new and didn't know much about the menu, but she was nice and willing to listen. I have nothing against this place, and wanted to like this place, but it didn't turn out that way. \\n\\nFirst of all, if you're seeking for Japanese food, this is not the place. This place may be appealing to Portlanders for something different but I do know Japanese food, and this is not it. If you're coming here and not ordering the burger, you're making a mistake. I came here with my parents and sister, to try out a new place and I've heard great things about the burger. The other food...from what we ordered, wasn't so great.\\n\\n\\nMy mother ordered a sushi roll, the hamachi one with a pear.  The rolls were small, and wasn't anything special (photo posted of two pieces). They weren't good, weren't bad. The plate was $12 for 8 small pieces of meh! It was bland... Sushi Land is better in my opinion...and I don't even care for sushi land (we went there right after this place because we were still hungry). We were comparing the two places, which is actually pretty sad to think that I'd rather go back to Sushi Land if I wanted sushi.\\n\\nAnother thing that I was baffled about was the waitress told us they serve their food family style, so we all order items and share. My fathers item was so small, like smaller than an appetizer, and was served in a miso bowl. Oh yeah, and it was $10.\\n\\nMy father ordered the \\"Donburi\\". He tried it and was grossed out...took two bites and threw his chopsticks down. Donburi in Japanese is a hot bowl of rice, served in a certain type of bowl, covered with some kind of meat (katsu, chicken, whatever) and this was a very small bowl of cold/room temperature rice covered with very tiny cut pieces of what looked like Chinese BBQ pork, and a fried something  (photo posted). And by small i mean extremely. Like I said, itt was served in a miso bowl and this thing was $10!!! We joked that the $3 udon bowl at Sushi Land was a bigger bowl than this. I thought the fried something was fried pork but it turned out to be a fried poached egg. It was weird. My father took a few bites and was upset and pushed it away. My mother tried it and was confused as to why it was called Donburi. Then we wondered whether the owner is Japanese or not. She literally explained to the waitress what Donburi actually is, and that they should correct their menu or add some notes that it was room temperature rice which is abnormal if they're going to call it \\"Donburi\\". \\n\\nThe waitress was kind enough to listen and not to charge us for this item. \\n\\nThe burger itself was pretty great. 8 ounces of thick beef was cooked to perfect medium rare (photos are posted). The spicy sauce was blended well with the white creamy cheese (I think it was cheese), and the thin fried potatoes added a great crunchy texture. This burger is worth coming for, and this is all I would get from this place if I come back. \\n\\nHowever, the burger was delicious, but, it's not something I would crave that I'd scream to come back for (Brunch Box, Glisan Barnyard and Killer Burger do that for me). It was more of an experience, and I'm ready for a different ride. It was also pretty pricey in my opinion for not coming with a side. I would be just as satisfied with the Biwa Burger (somewhat similar in taste), which costs less and comes with some side dishes. I do recommend this burger though.\\n\\nI don't really recommend this place if you care to eat some Japanese food, but if you don't care particularly for Japanese food, or want to try the burger, go for it!

If you want quality sheesha, this place might actually be the worst joints to smoke sheesha at (yes, worse than Kasbah!).\\n\\nREAD ONLY IF YOU'RE AN EXPERIENCED SMOKER:\\nIn my last 6 years of smoking sheesha, this joint was probably the biggest let down. Typically what you notice at most sheesha places is that the flavor starts off great but then deteriorates quickly within 20-30mins (that's where the novices suffer when the staff doesn't supervise the replacement of coal); more experienced smokers can make the best of a poorly made bowl too adjusting the valve, repositioning charcoal, placing a wind cover and exhaling into the hookah from time to time. I put myself in experienced category because I've been doing this for a pretty long time so at the very least I know the difference between a good bowl and a bad one. \\n\\nMy friends and I got 4 hookahs here, each mounted with a standard bowl but just had 1 natural charcoal each. 1 charcoal just isn't enough to get a bowl started so we asked for another round; the lady at the counter obliged but said it would take a while (there is simply no reason to be parsimonious about the charcoal at the beginning but we let it slide). We asked for wind-covers that were on display, but she said she couldn't give those out. We asked for aluminum foil so that we could build our own wind covers to deal with the substandard hookah and get more heat concentrated on the bowl (yes, we had to build our own wind-covers folding the foil in a cylindrical fashion and mounting it on the bowl). Anyhow, the makeshift wind covers worked for 2 of the hookahs, but didn't for the other 2. \\n\\nThis is because the bowl mounted on the stem was not air tight; no matter how many coals you put on it, every time you inhale you just won't have a good smoking experience. We pointed this out to her and she just gave us a dirty look. Regardless she grudgingly obliged but failed to fix the problem in an educated manner; instead of wrapping some tissue paper on the grommet at the tip of the stem (where the bowl is mounted), she thought that putting more coals on it will fix it. Unfortunately 2 things went wrong; first this just burned the flavor faster with a very marginal improvement in smoke. Secondly, the coals she gave us weren't completely burned so that means that 2 of the sides of a 6-face cubical coal were black. You might think that hey if that side didn't burn well, just place the side on the foil that DID burn well. Alas, what happens is that the unburned side keeps shedding a fine and thin layer of black coal soot and this seeps within your bowl. So if you move the coal around (or do nothing), you will see a thin layer of soot seeping into your bowl and soon you'll feel the damn thing in your throat. Air-tight or not, our hookah experience had now been consummately doomed thanks to the incompetent staff member with the glasses. We had heard good things and had moderate expectations, but this turned out to be a colossal waste of time and money.\\n\\nOur service was sub-standard and the sheesha was hands down the worst I've had in Austin. I usually make my own sheesha at home everyday so I understand the difference between good and great sheesha. At least at kasbah the hookah runs well for about 30mins and then craps out, but at Yahala it was garbage from the very beginning.

Whenever I'm looking for a good burger and I find a restaurant that's supposed to be known for some good burgah, I like to order it simple, maybe just with cheese and experience the original flavor of the burger. Got fries and water with my order. \\nBurger was alright, a bit disappointing since I was pumped and ready to order a second one if the first was gonna knock my taste buds out of the ballpark. Didn't happen. The major reason why I didn't enjoy it was the burger patties. For a double cheeseburger, the patties were about the same size as your average McDonald's - as thin as it can get, no real flavor, bland. Fries were delicious. Crispy but not greasy, good amount, spot on. \\nThe restaurant also has some type of a burger challenge that I will probably come check out because I like to eat but as far as burger goes - aa-ok.\\nFinal note - they have some interesting burger choices such as peanut butter one, I guess if you're into experimentation, this is your place!"},{"name":"South End Open Market","address":"375 Harrison Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"A very hipster vibe, but if you don't know that going into a place like this you've been living in a hole.  \\n\\nParking can be a bit of an issue, but we parked over by the cathedral with no issues.  \\n\\nThere was a great range of food trucks and our only wish was that there was someone selling drinks alone.

The cafe is small, but well decorated and very welcoming; I love the door to the electrical room, it is a painting of the Eiffel Tower, twinkle lights and all. During the soft opening there was a limited menu, but the full menu was available for perusal (I cannot wait to try the items with smoked salmon!)  On this visit, my husband and I shared a chocolate croissant, and breakfast sandwich, a caramel latte, and a Snow White Mocha latte. The lattes and croissants were delivered quickly, but we had to wait a bit for the kitchen to prepare our sandwich.\\n\\nFinding a table was the most frustrating part of our visit. It would not have been so bad had the outside tables been an option; however, cold and rainy weather had everyone inside (and probably slowed down everyone's pace to enjoy their warm beverages). Our lattes were wonderful - a perfect blend of espresso, milk, and flavoring.  The croissant was fine, but comparable to other bakeries in the area. Once the sandwich finally arrived, we were very impressed. The baguette was warm, soft, and clearly freshly baked. The unique thing about this was the option to pick your fillings (not just a standard sausage/bacon, egg, and predetermined cheese). We opted for egg, spinach, and goat cheese - which was truly decadent. We could've added more ingredients, but there is a small up-charge for more than 2 ingredients + egg. \\n\\nAfter we ordered, the employees took the menu down and were strictly pastries and coffee for the remainder of the day. We truly got there just in time. \\n\\nMy husband and I can't wait to return in a few weeks when they have their full menu available and have some of their opening kinks worked out.

When we learned that what we got instead was essentially a california roll with avocado on top for $11, we asked if we could please get eel to go with it.

Our dissatisfaction about the quantity did only increase once we found out how freaking flavorful and delicious everything was - but we'd do it again in a heartbeat.  \\n\\nOur next step is to see if the buffet can beat Amul India.

After my first spoonful I was in awe and it is perfectly finished with a hint of sherry that gives it a perfect touch of heat and flavor. For my next course I ordered the filet medallion duos which came with two filets; one topped with a mushroom bordelaise sauce and the other a b√©rnaise. Let me tell you. Each of these pieces of steak were cooked perfectly to my medium rare preference! There was a delightful, cohesive sear and a juicy pink middle. The two sauces did a great job of enhancing the flavor of the steaks. My meat was accompanied by crisp, fresh green beans and chateau mashed potatoes which were very, very good to say the least but couldn't hold a candle to the beautiful pieces of steak which were put in front of me. To finish my meal off I had the strawberry cheesecake which was advertised as a slice but in reality could feed a small group. It might have been one of the lightest, creamiest and yet simply cheesecakes I've had. It was the perfect ending to my meal.\\n\\nWhile the prices of Del Frisco's may be at the upper end your meal will reflect it.

After waiting for 30 min our food finally came and it was NOT like I remembered at all. (I always got the chicken penne) To say I had a plate of sauce with a few noodles and chicken pieces hiding in it somewhere is an understatement. Super weird and really tasteless. Way too much sauce, drowned the whole dish. My husband said the tacos were alright but definitely not worth $10 for 2 small tacos.

We were patient and courteous as always while sitting at the bar waiting to order food/drinks, but the barkeep was not having it.  The tall, scraggly self-important young droog behaved as if it were SUCH a BURDEN to take our order (2 pulled pork sandwiches, greens and slaw, 2 beers).  He even resorted to eye-rolling with full sigh.  Keep in mind that there were only 5-8 more people in the entire restaurant.  And if you're reading this, young droog, please get a bigger septum ring.  Yours is so small, smaller even than my girlfriend's septum ring, that it looks like you got punched by a stapler.  Commit and get a badass, heavy septum ring or take out your small one...I digress.  \\n It speaks to the manager of this place that he/she would allow such a non-chill vibe to develop in an otherwise great establishment with such potential.

Now, this is not your standard dim sum fare. This is Shanghai style. A little more refined, and a little different than most would expect. The xiao long bao is definitely worth the trip if you don't venture far from downtown. In fact, all of the dumplings are very good. Some improvements can be made in terms of table layout and 1-hour lunch time service. It took a little while to place an order. It's not cheap either. Lunch will cost you over $20, and more if you're hungry.

My husband and I were searching for the right place to host a 15-person dinner following our small wedding ceremony. From the moment we walked into the restaurant and were greeted by their kind and welcoming staff, we knew we had found our place. Amy S. and her staff were incredible from the very start. Of all the things I had to worry about and stay on top of in preparing and planning the wedding, THIS was never one of them. Amy kept in touch with me from beginning to end.  She showed me the rooms she had available and let us have our pick, highlighting the perks of each room. She worked with me to make slight adjustments to our menu and made recommendations where necessary. The night before, I popped in to drop off some provisions and Amy's colleague, Shannon, took the time to go over with me, how the table and each place setting would look. She took notes and made me feel 100% confident that the table would look exactly as I hoped it would. The day of, I was completely blown away by the presentation. From the moment we stepped out of our car, Amy was taking pictures (with our permission of course). We lucked out that she took professional photos as B&Co's marketing director. She took pictures of us in their amazing restaurant, jam packed with unique photo-op spaces and asked us what pictures we wanted her to capture.  She took pictures of our table, our guests enjoying drinks before dinner, my husband and I, our daughter, etc. I cannot say enough what this meant to us. She shared the pictures with us the same night and the next day. We will hold these pictures close forever! The table looked like something out of a restaurant magazine. They even took the time to print out our personalized menus and sent us home with some B&Co keepsakes, which was so incredibly sweet and just the cherry on top. Aside from the amazing welcoming and presentation, our server was AMAZING.  She was attentive and sweet and so on top of everything. She made sure everyone's drink was full, made sure there was always food in front of us, and was SO sweet with my daughter. There were other servers as well, and I feel terrible I cannot recall names, but they were all so amazing. I was so impressed with everything but let's not forget about the food.  Absolutely to die for. Everything was absolutely delicious and the food presentation was classy. The shrimp were jumbo, the steaks were cooked to perfection, the food was fresh and the drinks were delicious. Bancroft & Co truly MADE our wedding day. We cant wait to come back again and again and again. (I'm so certain I am forgetting something - there were so many wonderful things about this whole experience - my family and I are forever grateful to B&Co, Amy, and her staff, for really making our wedding day so special)."},{"name":"Dan's Hamburgers - Austin","address":"5602 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Dans is the bomb.com the staff is always so nice and helpful!

Well that was a fantastic decision.  El Madina's falafel sandwich is leaps and bounds better than Safy Market's version.  It may be the best (authentic) falafel sandwich I've ever had, to be honest.  It's filled with lettuce, tomato, hummus (extra 50 cents, but definitely worth it), and the piece de resistance, pickled turnips.  The first time around, I didn't know what those were, but I made sure to ask on my most recent visit.  The owner explained that they're house-made pickled turnips, and that they're what make the sandwich.  And he is right indeed.  I didn't think I even liked turnips, but apparently I was wrong.\\n\\nAnd speaking of the owner, he's really very kind, and he told me that he also has taboule, grape leaves, and baba ghanoush that he can prepare if he has a little time (call ahead).  That's awesome.  He also recommended trying the spinach pie, which he said many people really like, so I'll put that on my list of things to try as well.

This is ramen that is dipped into broth that's served on the side. It's basically a ramen bowl that's been deconstructed into its individual elements.\\n\\nThe ramen broths here are either chicken or pork, and they'll build additional flavor profiles from these 2 bases. You can get shio, shoyu, or yuzu.\\n\\nI opted for their tonkotsu shio ramen. It comes with chashu pork, half of a soft boiled egg, black garlic oil, green onion, pickled ginger, and kikurage mushrooms. I'm not a fan of ginger in ramen, so I requested that it not be included. The noodles are made in house and they're straight and medium thick. The consistency is on the firmer side, which is always encouraged. The broth is a milk brown and very savory. This is a result of the combination of the tonkotsu, shio (salt) and the black garlic oil. The broth is rich and salty, but balanced out by the garlic oil. The chashu is a large medallion of pork that's juicy with a medium amount of marbling throughout to make it tender and give it flavor.\\n\\nWe also tried the yuzu ratan because we wanted spicy broth. This bowl of ramen is made with chicken broth and comes with bamboo, egg, chashu pork, sesame, sansho pepper, lemon peel, korean chili powder and a piece of crispy nori. The broth had a nice level of spice to it that permeates your mouth and lingers without setting your mouth ablaze. However, the yuzu and lemon peel made the broth a bit too tangy and pushed the flavor profile more to the sour end of the spectrum.\\n\\nThe buta gyoza is a good appetizer to share. A serving has 8 dumplings and each is filled with a blend of pork, chives, ginger, garlic, napa cabbage, sesame oil, and soy sauce. All the gyoza is also made in house and deep fried together. There's a thin layer of the wrapper that connects all the pieces together and it's extra crispy. The dumplings themselves are juicy and flavorful, but slightly underfilled. The wrapper has a soft and chewy consistency to it."},{"name":"Taqueria Los Hermanos","address":"4418 Hugh Howell Rd","city":"Tucker","stars":"4","text":"#yelp 365\\n\\nThis was our first venture outside of the house for a sustained period of time since chicken soup and banana bread for days on end... literally.

My husband and I ordered two different things, or so we thought-- the burrito acapulco was a special-- but it was the Same exact sauce as mine. Disappointing to say the least. The only difference was that his burrito came with squid, octopus, and scallops. The taste was exactly the same.

Im assuming that it is this way because of a few lawsuits from people burning themselves while walking back to yhe table, but they need to be especially careful when setting down hot food in front of babies and toddlers.  Their employees at this restaurant are not friendly and I don't plan on returning even though we were regulars before.  Maybe the trick is ordering the food in to go containers, but paying the taxes so that you can actually eat it in the restaurant."},{"name":"Yahala Hookah Lounge","address":"6617 Airport Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Best shisha spot in all of Austin. \\nFriendly staff, always so sweet, welcoming, and accommodating. \\nComfy couches. \\nBoard games. \\nBYOB. \\nI love this place."},{"name":"Canton Buddha","address":"2900 Peachtree Rd NW, Ste 115","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Way more food than I expected, very hot and fresh ingredients, really tasty wings!

We sat inside, in a glassed-in room with tile floors.  The endless hard surfaces made the noise level from conversation so amplified that it was impossible to even hear the person at the other side of the table.  And there were only five of us.  The food was average, at best and the service was terrible.  We waited more than an hour for our food to arrive.  Granted it was busy, but the waiter never even came by to tell us that he was sorry for the delay. On top of that, when we did get our food he kept coming over and interrupting our conversation (as difficult as it was with the noise) to ask how our food was--once would have been enough. \\n\\nI ordered the NY strip steak.  It was tough with quite a bit of grizzle, which for $32 and no accompanying sides is a complete rip-off.  The seasoning was good, but the quality of the meat was poor.  I will say that it was cooked rare, as I ordered.  \\n\\nAfter a couple of us had finished our meals--in my case just as I was taking the last bite--the waiter brought the desert menus.  This was despite the fact that three of our party were still eating the main course.  It was so annoying that one of our party asked him to bring the menus back later.  It seemed like he was trying to rush us out.  When we finally did finish, it took more than 30 minutes for our desert orders to come out.  And when it did come out, the waiter had one of the desert orders wrong.  Amazingly, he brought the correct order in about two minutes.  One wonders why if they can operate that fast when the get things wrong, they can't do the same all of the time.  \\n\\nThe short of it is:\\n\\nService stinks\\nAtmosphere makes conversation almost impossible\\nThe taste of the food isn't bad\\nThe quality of the cut of steak was fair, at best\\n\\nThere are several positive reviews for this place here, so it may have been a bad night.

The problem must be me, as the reviews seem to be pretty positive overall, so take my words with a shaker of salt!\\n\\nMy complaints from last time had been improved upon, which is great!  Service was super friendly and quick! My mac and cheese was mouth-burningly hot!  The portions seemed to be a generous size!  But something is just missing.  I got the Philly cheesesteak, and it was just aiiiiiight.  It tasted pretty good but the filling was really wet and homogenous.  I know there are tons of kinds of Phillies and this kind just didn't wow me.  The sandwich was on a po boy roll, which would be fine on its own but didn't work great with the meat--when I'd bite it, all the filling would squeeze out the bottom and it was tough to get a good bite since the bread is chewy.  The mac and cheese had a great flavor towards the cheese-covered top, but the bites closer to the bottom tasted kind of chemical-y.  I'm just guessing, but the MacCheese comes in a cute little iron skillet and I think since this is a new place and the dishes are all new, the skillet may not be seasoned yet.  That's my totally non-scientific guess, though.\\n\\nMy husband's roast beef po boy had similar problems to my Philly.  The meat was very wet and nondescript, but he liked the flavor.  Our dining partners (okay you caught me, it was my in-laws) got a hot dog and a Mediterranean veggie burger.  They both loved what they got, and I might be persuaded to try either of them in the future.  The Mediterranean is like a big ol' falafel and it looked really good.  The sweet potato fries had a great texture, but were seasoned with sugar and cinnamon.  I'm more into a spicy/savory sweet potato so I'd ask them to skip the sweet stuff if I got them again.\\n\\nProbably my biggest gripe with the Imperial is that Decatur has a BUNCH of pubs, so if I'm going to visit yet another one it should really stand out.  I love Phillies, hot dogs, and burgers, big time!  But, there's nothing really special about anything on the menu here, and the things that ARE supposed to be special (like the wings, or the \\"Phreaky\\" Philly) haven't won me over."},{"name":"Circosta's","address":"2960 W State Rd 426","city":"Oviedo","stars":"4.5","text":"If you see a Shell gas station, then you are in the right plaza. \\n\\nIf you can, just order take out from here.

The service was good and the food was good but the owner was a misogynistic prick. The reason we went to this red was because a friend had 8 $10 gift certificates that expired tomorrow. She tried to use them to pay for her bill only to be told they only accept up to 4 per table. After speaking with the owner he showed us on the 3rd party website where it said that (not printed on the gift certificate). Fine we accept that, shady as it is... so since the certificates expired tomorrow we thought we would do something nice and pass the remaining 4 out to the only 4 other tables in the restaurant. This is where the problem occurred.. we started hearing the servers telling the other tables they couldn't use them bc they came from the same source. Again nothing about that on the certificates or website, only restriction was per table. At this point I went to the server and asked for the remaining 4 back so we could use them tomorrow (we wouldn't have gone back but it's the principal). At this point the owner comes up to me, telling me he already ripped them up. Then continues to berate me, threatening to call the cops bc I'm asking for our property back, tells us we were the only table all night that used gift certificates and that we should have called them before coming in to ask about using the gift certificates. Who calls a place and asks if it's ok to use a gift certificate to the establishment the go is for?!?

I grew up eating Sonny Bryan's brisket and Cooper's smoked chicken. I was missing good barbecue super bad for the first year I was here (yes, I've tried your favorite, no, really, that one, too, and if you think that's good barbecue, oh, pumpkin, I'm sad for you). Then I found my new BBQ home. \\n\\nI am here to tell y'all, if you are looking for legit Texas-style barbecue, Que'd is the real deal. The brisket has deep, smoky, meaty flavor, lovely moisture, and a great bark. I don't like beef fat - but I eat the fat on the brisket here. That's how good it is. They use fantastic local sausage. Ribs and pulled pork are tender and luscious. \\n\\nJust as important, they don't neglect sides! The mark of a mediocre barbecue place is having good meat or good sides, but not both. Que'd is great on both, and that's rare and delightful. The coleslaw is crunchy, bright, moist but not overdressed. The beans, flavored with brisket scraps, are some of the best I've ever had. The first time we visited, we enjoyed their Mexican-style corn, but now that it's out of season, they have a fabulous tangy sweet potato salad. My favorite, though, is the mac and cheese - curly cavatappi pasta in a lush cheese sauce topped with (oh god) chicharrone crumbs. I literally whimper, \\"Oh, gawwwd,\\" after every bite. \\n\\nAnd the family that runs it couldn't be sweeter. Food trucks aren't noted for great service; it's just a fact of the setup that you usually have a quick, impersonal interaction. But David, Donna, and the kids bring true Southern hospitality along with their clear commitment to a beautiful food tradition. This ain't a BS hipster place where some bearded white dudes who say they studied with real pit masters make money off other people's recipes. David cooks from memories of his grandfather and a real passion for the demanding art of the pit. This is real, down home cooking from the heart.

My boyfriend and I had an excellent lunch here and can't wait to come back the next time we are at Disney Springs. We didn't have a reservation but they seated us right away on a Saturday. The air conditioning was such a relief from the Florida sun! This new restaurant is beautiful inside and out with sleek modern features and two bars (upstairs and downstairs). They also have an outdoor patio upstairs that is perfect for people watching and relaxing outside when the weather is nice. They have over 100 types of wine available by the bottle, the glass or even the ounce! This is the only restaurant I've ever been to where the namesake was actually present. George himself was behind the bar mingling with customers and talking to his staff! So awesome! Our server Olivia couldn't have been nicer. She walked us through the menu and made sure we had what we needed throughout our meal. \\n\\nFor lunch we started with sangria and their wine margarita, the fried mac and cheese bites, and the spiced olives. The drinks were good but the mac and cheese bites were killer! So good! Order them! The olives were served warm which was a game changer! For entrees I ordered the steak frites and my boyfriend had the BLT + C. The steak was very flavorful and cooked perfectly but I would have liked more sauce/gravy to dip my fries in. My boyfriend also enjoyed his entree. I was celebrating my birthday and the staff were kind enough to bring our desserts with birthday greetings printed on chocolate! If you like olives get the olive oil cake! This was a knockout dining experience.

I am not sure how the breakfast sandwiches are- I keep it pretty simple with plain cream cheese on my bagel.

Otherwise, there is something seriously wrong with your taste buds. Less fast food for you.\\n\\nI tried 5 items on the menu. Brisket, ribs, fried chicken, watermelon salad, and corn on the cob. Every single one of them tastes like amateur's first attempt, and a failed one. First of all, the chef has never heard the word seasoning. I rarely use the table salt outside of France, but here, i covered everything with salt so that I could taste any flavor. They dont put any salt on the table. The brisket, is sadly the best among these. Juicy = soaked with fat, because the cook don't know how to trim the fat. Each slides has 40% fat, 60% meat. The whole thing was boiled before hitting the grill, and a thick slides of brisket is falling apart under a folk. Ribs, need another 3 hrs. Can't taste any work in the rub. Fried chicken is the absolute worse. The whole thing was overdone. Crust smells burnt. No flavor whatsoever in the meat. What it had was unnecessary fat that supposed to be cleaned. Tasted like boiled chicken, no joke. Corn was not done. Wrong choice of corn. Watermelon salad was a slice of watermelon topped with ricotta cheese. If you are trying to make it simple I suggest you to serve a slice of watermelon and skip the extra calories.\\n\\nAs you can definitely tell by now, I am petty. However, if you are a professional who is cooking for a living, you should be up for this. I am judgy to all restaurants, but yours is ranking a solid worst 3.

There were two fairly thick slices of pork belly, which, while a bit chewy, was well-seasoned and flavourful. Surprisingly however, my favourite part had to be the English muffin: it was buttery, crispy on the outside with a soft and chewy interior. The amount of bearnaise sauce that they served was pretty scant, but I honestly didn't mind since I found it to be a bit too acidic for my liking (I prefer hollandaise). Unfortunately, I did find the sides to be a bit disappointing. The vegetables (which consisted of kabocha, daikon radish, carrots and pappers) were pretty bland.

I decided on getting an extra of the cod fish, but had I known how huge and delicious the shrimp was going to be, I would have definitely chose the shrimp. The shrimp wasn't just any shrimp, it was JUMBO shrimp and so delicious! It was perfectly crispy, wonderfully seasoned and quite tender and juicy. My 2nd favorite was the cod fish, which was nicely crunchy and flavorful. The calamari was decent, but there was barely any of it in the basket. It would have been nice to get a bit more of the calamari. And french fries were yummy. \\n\\nThe service was pretty good.

Even the bread excelled with some tasty oil and loads of fresh butter.  Crab salad and farm egg made for nice apps.  Farm egg blew us away with its large portion and flavorful polenta base.  Definitely worth it to save bread to dip for this one.  Tremendous opener and stupid to not order each and overtime you dine here.  For entrees, branzino a nice rendition and pastas fresh.  Peppers can be added to spice everything up and they add a nice kick without overpowering so worth asking for if you're a fan of heat.  Shrimp a great addition to any vegetarian pasta while the chicken pretty basic so probably stick with seafood.  Tiramisu for dessert tremendous and a chocolate-lover's paradise.  The donuts a nice lively dessert for the summer months with lemon flavored ice cream.  Really everything we ordered was tasty down to the last bite.  Tiramisu and farm egg must orders, but overall all the pastas were great and entrees filled you up.  Definitely a nice spot to celebrate or just have a leisure night out in Austin.

Since then it has really gone downhill, I think there must've been a change in management or something. Last year (2017) they started getting stingy and would charge you an extra $5 soup base fee if your table had more than two people and it didn't say anything about that on the menu so they relied on servers telling people (which of course they didn't). When we complained about the extra $5 fee on our bill and the Manager explained why, we said the server didn't tell us. He was standing right there, so the Manager asked him and he said no. She gave us a $5 voucher to use on a future visit but refused to take the charge off. We came back again just to use the $5 voucher and noticed they had new hot pot menus with the $5 soup base fee for more than 2 people printed on it. I don't remember what we got but it was just some cooked meat/noodle plate instead of hot pot. When we tried to pay they told us we had to spend at least something like $25 to use the $5 voucher, which was on there in fine print that we had missed. So we had to order something else, which really defeated the purpose because we had already vowed to never return again and just wanted to use the voucher and be done with it. So we ordered some kind of \\"sweet potato mochi\\". I'd never tried mochi before, but I've seen it in the stores and thought it was like ice cream. What I got was nothing like I expected. It was deep fried, dripping with oil and disgusting.\\nWe haven't been in a long time and I wanted to take some family out to try hot pot so we took them. The old package deal hot pot menus are gone, no more $5 soup base fee for more than 2 people. They messed up the order so bad I thought they must've brought someone else's order to our table. They gave us sweet potato instead of carrots, mushroom instead of tofu. They took the sweet potato and mushroom back and finally brought carrots, but we never got the tofu we had ordered. The food here is really good, it's just the service and management that's the problem and it's really overpriced for what it is. It ended up almost $15 per person plus they added an 18% gratuity on split checks which came out closer to $17 per person. They didn't do anything for the mixup on the order but remove the tofu we never received.
