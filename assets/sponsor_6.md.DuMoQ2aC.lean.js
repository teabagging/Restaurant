The calzones are THE best that I've ever tasted. They are very generous with their \\"toppings\\", are always made fresh, and they are so moist! You really don't need the extra sauce that comes with it (unless you want a soggy calzone). Also, they come in 2 sizes: regular and large. \\n\\nPizza is fantastic! My favorites are the greek pizza with gyro meat (instead of lean ground beef) and the classic pepperoni. My husband and I have tried some of the other pizza selections, but we always come back to these two. \\n\\nSalads are...eh. It's just lettuce and dressing basically, nothing special. Sandwiches are dry and bland somehow. Not a fan of those either. The wings are horrible! They are soggy, so my guess is they don't fry them. Perhaps they are baked? I don't know.\\n\\nI haven't actually ordered the lasagna myself, but a friend ordered it once and let me have a bite. It wasn't bad, but I remember the sauce being sweet. Maybe it was just that batch, but regardless I won't be ordering the lasagna anytime soon. \\n\\nThe employees are always friendly, and the deliveries are always on time. The prices are pretty standard, but they offer coupons that you can reuse over and over again. This makes it a little more affordable. It may seem that I have a lot of negative things to say about this place for having given it 4 stars, but if you avoid the crappy food, the good food is REALLY GOOD! It's safe to say that the hubby and I order from this place an average of 3 times a month. I recommend it!"},{"name":"Cambridge Brewing Company","address":"1 Kendall Sq, Bldg 100","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"We go here often before heading over to the Kendall Cinema.

It's a cool idea but falls flat- between the blaring stereo, music vids covering every wall, and occasional concert smoke blast over at the bar it's easy to get distracted from your plate. Plus there's not even a dance floor so you can fully enjoy the soundtrack (which is influenced by guests via the iPad at each table). Pizza is good but not memorable. Kind of greasy, too thin crust and not enough topping. For $12 I expect to feel more satisfied. The salads and dessert are amazing though, but small portions on both (good thing w/ the dessert, not so much w/ the salad).

I was pleasantly surprised at how flavorful the broth was.  However, I didn't feel the Pork Belly added anything special.  Next time I will order ramen with the Tonkotsu broth.  I think the thin straight noodles people are referring to are somen noodles.  The noodles were cooked just the way I like them - al dente.\\n\\nHubby ordered the miso ramen.  This one has curly noodles in a miso (soybean paste) base broth.  Hubby said he liked the flavor, but I thought my Tonkotsu broth tasted better.\\n\\nI didn't care for the gyoza.  They were a little too mushy for my taste.  The chicken karaage was lightly breaded and seasoned nicely.  They were delicious, however, overpriced for the portion size.  The pieces were larger then half a thumb nail as another reviewer noted, but not  by much more.  There are 6 pieces per order which amounts to about a $1 a bite.\\n\\nBeing from the LA area, we have many ramen options to choose from.

The first reason I give this two stars is because of my experience having a server spill a whole glass of red wine on me.\\n\\nI came here several weeks ago on a Friday night for dinner with a group of friends. We did not have a reservation because we had planned on going somewhere else. There were three hosts at the entrance that were trying to find us a table (although the restaurant was pretty empty at the time). For some reason, I did not see any of them smile the whole time we were standing there. \\n\\nThey gave us a long table upstairs along the wall which was great. Our server greeted us and took drink orders to start. When he came with the wine and other drinks, he asked me if I had a red wine. I said no, that my friend next to me ordered it. He then proceeded to reach over me to hand her the wine and spilled the whole glass on me. The wine got on my blouse, sweater, jeans, phone, and even my coat hanging on the back of my chair. Number one rule of serving: never reach over anyone with anything!!\\n\\nThe server immediately apologized by saying \\"oh my gosh, I'm sorry. I don't know what happened.\\" He went to get me several cloth napkins to clean up the mess. I was not too upset, but just bummed that I was completely wet, and my clothes covered in red wine. What disappointed me though was the level of service after this accident. The server asked if I needed anything else and that the manager would come over and speak with me. However, at the end of the meal my entree was still on the bill and the manager had not come over.\\n\\nMy friend told the server that I should not have to pay for my meal and that I wanted to speak with the manager. He said he forgot to take off my meal. The manager then came over and explained he did not want to interrupt the meal and that they would pay for my clothes to be cleaned. Having been a sever myself for several years, I know that you should be apologizing profusely and doing everything you can to make the guest happy. \\n\\nThe service overall was very slow and did not match the cost of items on the menu. My burger was $22 and was not cooked medium-well as ordered. I emailed the manager several days ago with my request to reimburse me for my dry cleaning but he has yet to respond. I also called yesterday with no response. I understand accidents happen but making it right is what is important. And so far, this restaurant has not done anything to make me want to return."},{"name":"Sweet Cheeks Q","address":"1381 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Is there any other option wherever you are? Oh yeah, then go there and do not even bother reading this review. This place was probably the worst meal/drink I've had in Boston. I tried a gin and tonic (had some funny taste that we could not figure out which probably was either horrible tonic, horrible gin or both -- they don't have Hendricks or Bombay or Tanqueray or Beefeater or anything I could recognize). I also tried a beer that was equally horrible. \\n\\nSo why am I telling you not to bother going here? Well first, it is not really BBQ. No hush puppies and the fries are some weird round potato things. I asked the waitress if she could give me aioli with the meal and she said \\"I'll check in on that\\" and after getting the horrible cherry aioli the check subsequently had a $1.50 charge for aioli on a $5 bowl of fries which is not only absurd because of the price but because she didn't even bother telling me that there would be a charge at all. When I brought it up she said \\"oh we always charge for sides\\" -- oh well it sounds like communication is something they don't teach here. In summary, weak drinks, weak BBQ and weak service -- so ask yourself, why bother going here??"},{"name":"Haveli Bistro","address":"185 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"This is my third time going to Haveli in the past week, and I have been consistently impressed each time. So far I've only had the buffet, an appetizer, and a cocktail, but each element has stood on its own in such a way that I feel comfortable passing positive judgment on the general restaurant. \\n\\nFirst, the buffet. They have a changing buffet menu (unsure if it's rotating or is different each time), and each offering has been delicious. The buffet is $12.95, with 14 different dishes ranging from appetizers to entrees to desserts. Some of my personal favorites have been the ginger chicken, chili potatoes, mushroom chicken, chicken biryani, black lentil curry, and tandoori chicken. Haveli offers multiple unique Indo-Chinese dishes, and the buffet intersperses them with the mainstays like saag paneer to great effect. I admittedly haven't ventured out to extensively in Columbus's smaller Indian cuisine, but the restaurants I've frequented (Aab, Himalayan Grill, Dosa Corner) haven't offered anything similar to the flavor palette displayed here. On top of this, the kitchen doesn't hold punches when it comes to spicing the buffet, which is a blessing when compared to Aab's more lackluster offerings. Everything tasted flavorful and delicious, and the waitstaff was dutiful in refilling the containers despite the large amount of people milling through the line. \\n\\nSecond, the appetizers. Because I haven't gone to dinner here yet, I haven't gotten to try most of the appetizers, but they were kind enough to let me order the Gobi Manchurian when I went in during Happy Hour (when I went they hadn't ironed out a Happy Hour specific menu, but said it would be finished up very soon). This is the only other place in Columbus outside of Himalayan Grill that I know of who has the cauliflower dish. It was decidedly different from HG, but similarly delicious. My only gripe was that the appetizer portion was a bit pricy for what I got and I'd love it if they offered this as an entree at a similar price point. The other appetizers I've tried through the buffet (chili potatoes and a few others I can't remember) were also very very good. \\n\\nThird, Happy Hour/Cocktails. They offer half off cocktails from 4-6pm on the weekdays, and it's a great deal for what you get! I tried the Bollywood Bourbon Smash and it was incredible! The liquor wasn't overpowering but you could just taste it, and the flavors intermingled perfectly with the fresh fruit. The bartender/manager who was working had created the cocktail list himself and it was fantastic. I really look forward to coming by after work and trying the other cocktails. \\n\\nA few things of note that are nitpicky:\\n-The rice in the buffet seems to get a bit over cooked and some kernels got very crunchy. \\n-Mentioned above, a bigger portion of the Gobi Manchurian for the price it's listed as would be wonderful!\\n-The system for cashing out customers in the upstairs seems to be a bit chaotic and probably needs some ironing out for the lunch rush. There was a card mixup but it was fixed after a few minutes, but it seems like they might need to have another station to be used for the buffet. \\n\\nOverall, I am so excited to have a new Indian restaurant so close to my work, with a great lunch buffet (and lunch specials but I have not tried them as of this review) and a promising Happy Hour."},{"name":"Upper Crust Pizzeria","address":"683 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Don't order a salad from the UC.

They locally source their ingredients and make their own pastas and bread in house. Off menu they offer items dim sum style. They come around with a cart of goodies and let you pick what you want. If you're on a first date and want to be adventurous this could be really fun, but otherwise I'd recommend coming in with a group so that you try a little bit of everything. \\n\\nThe menu changes consistently depending on what they have available. On this particular night our favorites were the Tres Leches, the kale salad, empanadas, and the polenta. \\n\\nYes, I listed the dessert first - the Tres Leches. Talk about an amazing treat! The texture was perfect and the flavors were very organic and natural. We also had the Meyer Lemon Sorbet and that, too was fantastic. It was a great palate cleanser and I'd love to try it again on a warm day.\\n\\nThe empanadas were perfectly seasoned and the crust was just the right kind of flaky. The polenta was creamy, earthy, and perfectly buttery. Truly decadent and comforting. But my personal favorite was the kale salad. I believe the kale is fermented and they use the liquids as the vinaigrette, but however they did it was epic.\\n\\nThe pork dishes were a bit too salty for my tastes. Not bad by any means, just not my style. \\n\\nWe had 5 people; everyone had one drink under 10 bucks, tried 8 different dishes, and our bill was very reasonable (35 + tip).

It may not be a regular occurrence, but once is enough to potentially cut your intestines (a thick commercial grade staple) or clog food traffic (plastic casing).

Eat at your own risk or until an episode like Chipotle occurs at Piada.\\n\\nUPDATE:  Because it was a carry out, I stopped by and spoke with chef.

The client√®le is on the younger side. Menu boards behind the counter are in a ridiculous comic book font and ads on the tables promote the purchase of Austin Java gift cards. Blech.

For dessert, a version of peach cobbler made with a HUGE biscuit.\\n\\nThe babybacks had a nice bark, no discernible smoke ring and were pretty dry. Only by adding one of the sauces offered were these ribs decent. The brisket had nice bark, a discernible smoke ring but were gray in color. The brisket was also pretty dry. The sauces offered were sweet, spicy and what appears to be a Carolina mustard/vinegar sauce. The spicy has a nice bite and is hot enough for just about everyone. To be honest, I'm not a fan of their sweet sauce. Not that Sweet Cheeks' sweet sauce is \\"bad\\" or \\"wrong,\\" it's just a personal preference.\\n\\nAs for the sides, the bbq beans had plenty of meat and a nice, tangy sauce. However, the kidney beans were significantly harder than al dente (underdone?). The mac n cheese was excellent. It had a lot of cheese with pasta and some crackers crumbled in it. The house-made biscuit was warm and had a pleasant cheesy flavor with a side of honey butter you can either apply sparingly or slather it on.\\n\\nThe dessert was a pleasant take on a peach cobbler made with an oversized biscuit.

Uchi usually gets all the raves but Musashino's is just a good of quality - without the hype and central location. If you're in Northwest Hills and crave sushi, or can make the drive you won't be disappointed."},{"name":"Jimmies Cafe","address":"48 Corinth St","city":"Roslindale","stars":"3.5","text":"Last night I was marvelling at the ice cream sundae I bought from another cafe, and I recalled how I once used to love Jimmies Ice Cream. I started to think about the slow decline in the products served, as well as the increase in prices.  (I'm not sure when the increase in prices occurred, but they are definitely higher than they used to be)\\n\\n My most recent purchase at Jimmies occurred in the early summer/ late spring.  My boyfriend and I decided we would take the dog and walk down to the village.  I was in dire need of ice cream, so I decided to drop on into Jimmies and grab a cookies and cream frappe.  It was $4.50 and good god, it felt like I was drinking milk. Straight up milk.  I'm not sure they actually put the four scoops of ice cream in like the menu said....\\n\\nOn that note, the size of the scoops of ice cream are awfully small.  The scoops in a 3 scoop sundae, results in a very small amount of ice cream and thus ice cream.\\n\\n\\nI'm not sure what has happened.  I am a Roslindale resident, and I love to shop locally and buy locally.  But, the next time I want Ice Cream, I'm heading elsewhere."},{"name":"Tasca Restaurant","address":"1612 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"I'm a bit of sick of trying, only to be disappointed, different \\"Spanish\\" restaurants in Boston.

The Haven is the only Scottish restaurant/pub in Boston, and as a person of Scottish descent who has visited Scotland many times, I can vouch for the authenticity of the food.  In fact, some of it is elevated (as with the Scotch Egg - totally addictive) and the Sticky Toffee Pudding.  Over the course of many visits I have had the Scotch Egg (obviously), Cullen Skink (a mightily delicious and silky smooth smoked haddock soup that is almost like a chowder with a light aromatic broth), Vegetable Bridie (a Bridie - pronounced \\"bride-ee\\" is a triangular piece of puff pastry traditionally filled with ground beef and onion) which is reinvented with cheese and potatos inside, the Rocket Salad (rocket being what people in the UK calls arugula) with mizuna, Braeburn apples, Stilton cheese, walnuts and a mustard dressing; for main courses I have had their Fish Supper (fish & chips with incredibly fresh haddock & great big, fat, hand cut chips), the herb roasted Giannone 1/2 chicken that comes with a small batch of arugula and a rumbledethump cake ... that is a crisped up circular mound of a combo of potato and turnip, The Haven Burger is outstanding and I can not explain why other than it is juicy, on a delicious roll served with those great \\"chips\\", the white pudding sassitch (sausage) and mashed potatoes with crispy kale, roast carrots and a mustard gravy which I liked very much, and I have had, of course, the haggis on Robert Burns' night ... must admit, I'm not a fan of haggis because I don't like lamb but I did eat it ...on to desserts!  The Sticky Toffee pudding is my absolute favorite everywhere I go and theirs holds up to my standards.  They also serve the unique Scottish delicacy ... the deep fried Mars bar ... a chocolate candy bar coated in batter and deep fried, served with home made fresh whipped cream.  It originated in the owner's hometown of Stonehaven, Scotland.  If you have not tried it, you must.  There are many beers on tap and they are applying for a full liquor license.  There is occasional entertainment, meetups of specific groups like Outlander fans, the chance to watch Scottish athletics (and other European) on TV.  The atmosphere is rustic/cozy.  You are warmly greeted, set up with your own carafe of water (which is magically refilled) and a plate of homemade Scottish oat cakes and fresh creamery butter.  I supposed you have the idea I like The Haven at this point and you would be right but I think it is more like love.  There is a Scottish saying \\"Haste Ye Back\\" and I always know I'll be back, and soon, whenever I step outside of their door.  p.s.  I noticed their phone ringing frequently for take out orders for the lucky locals.  p.p.s.  You do not  have to be Scottish or of Scots descent to enjoy all on offer at The Haven."},{"name":"Rolling In Thyme & Dough","address":"333 W Hwy 290","city":"Dripping Springs","stars":"4","text":"Stopped in for breakfast as we were passing through town, got two breakfast sandwiches and coffees for $20.

Unfortunately for me, the \\"legume of the day\\" ended up being garbanzo beans, which are like my Kryptonite (I dislike them immensely). Now, I don't hold that against them as I should have asked prior to ordering my bowl so I could have substituted for something else. The pancakes we got here were delicious!

The story is one of those best of America.\\n\\nAmericans are world travelers to an extent, but not, say, to the extent of Australians.\\n\\nTravelers brought the first tiki bars to America in the 1930's.\\n\\nAmerica's military, and of course the Peace Corps, are travelers. It is the military which fueled the popularization of tiki bars. \\n\\nWWII had American military persons exploring the South Pacific Islands. Those cultures had developed religions based connecting with totem gods. A example are the Eastern Island head carvings. By the way. we got surfing from them too!\\n\\nEntwined in that experience was the musical South Pacific. Based on a Michener novel, 1947, it is about the characters struggling with racism amidst authentic cross cultural romances on a South Pacific Island. \\n\\nTiki bars came from that experience too. People had them in basements and the Trader Vic's and other commercial tiki bars thrived, all from the curiosity of military service people returning from the Pacific Islands and America's new outward interest in the world. There is actually an underground Portland tiki bar group.\\n\\n(The famous Trader Vic's Bartender's Guide, a book published in 1947, is a great encyclopedia of 1500 old drink recipes, including those inspired by the South Sea Islands at the Trader Vic's tiki bars. It is out of print, but can be found online.)\\n\\nHale Pale is the small tiki bar open to the public, no basement required. The storefront has a waterfall and a small bridge crossing flowing water. \\n\\nThe interior is decorated with puffer fish, lamps - source of the dangerous fugu sushi, carved totems, bamboo mats on the walls and has a dark intimate atmosphere. \\n\\nThey have a variety of unusual drinks, some revived from the out of print Trader Vic's bartender guide. Most are sweet. They have group shared drinks, think long straws. One is a volcano drink, which is served in a bowl with a volcano in the middle and announced by a volcano sound effect. \\n\\nOne unusual tradition of Hale Pale is their seasonal aged egg nog. They make fresh egg nog from dairy and egg yolks, add brandy, other liquor and spices, then age it for quite some time. http://artofeating.com/aged-eggnog/ It is available in small servings over ice each year for a few days around Thanksgiving. \\n\\nOur waitstaff was gracious and the bar kept up, but realize that their complicated drinks take some time to make. Just imagine yourself on island time in a place you want to be!\\n\\nPortland's Hale Pale is one of the few public tiki bars here.

For a $3 cup of tea, I expect they use a higher end tea bags, not something that is low quality.   The mocha roll cake slice taste ok, but again $3 for the thin slice of roll cake is just not worth it.

Great quality beef, crunchy potato strings, chevre - yum! We also got the vegetarian option of a cold noodle dish. It was ok, but didn't compare to the burger. Our son ordered the salmon tartare off the regular menu. I loved it but he wasn't crazy about it. The fish and the beets were delicious, and I ate what he didn't want.

They were dark and after the pepper jelly with the cheese we couldn't taste the jalape√±o. I could see the crab in the churros, but it wasn't very flavorful and mostly batter--more like a hushpuppy than a crab cake. Our server described it like a hushpuppy, so this ratio was expected. The cheese was definitely the more flavorful dish when eaten side by side. \\n\\nWe both opted for salads, the beet composition and the kale and mustard green caesar style salad. Both were delicious. The eggplant croutons were delightfully crispy and I loved them as an alternative to croutons! Both salads were nicely seasoned, dressed, and presented. \\n\\nFor dessert I had the lemon bar and my Dad had the pecan tart and bourbon ice cream.

There was a vegetarian option for both the second and third course, but not the first and when I addressed this with the server she said I could just have the second course for me first, thus leaving me without a second course. I'm not a picky diner, but I do try to not draw attention to myself as a vegetarian and I knew if everyone else was eating their first/second course and I was just sitting there, attention would be drawn to me. Thankfully, the server asked the chef for a vegetarian substitute for my first course and it was all taken care of.

The place is big and clean with plenty of seating, and they donate their food to charity at the end of the day, which is pretty boss.\\n\\nSo far, I've fared better with their cold sandwiches instead of their hot wraps. Though I hesitated to buy a premade shrimp wrap (shrimp sittin' around- not so appealing), I womaned up, went for it, and was rewarded with DELICIOUSNESS. On the other hand, the warm buffalo chicken wrap failed on multiple fronts- after sitting in the warmer all day, the wrap stuck to the packaging, the tortilla was very dry, and for some reason the sauce in 90% of the wrap tasted like marinara sauce instead of buffalo sauce. I had to check the wrapper multiple times to see if I had indeed picked up the correct wrap. I also got a chai tea latte that was rather underwhelming and consisted of a teabag dunked into hot water and topped off with a bit of milk. \\n\\nSo, a little hit or miss- as of right now, I'd say that the cold wraps and sandwiches are a good bet, but beware of the warmer in the evenings, tempting though it may be in the Boston winter.

I wound up going in and trying to find a waitress to explain we were all waiting on the last dish .We were not given silverware. Had to get that myself . Overall the food is ok . Depending on what you order . Stay away from anything that takes a while to cook . This was on a very slow day . Had to find napkins , an extra plate and water myself . If it was a busy day as usual I could understand it might take a while but it was dead . This happens every time we go there . Every time!!! We always say we will never go back but try to give them another shot every 5 months . Nothing has changed . One more thing . The chairs outside are soooo uncomfortable . After sitting for a long time waiting for your food you will need to stand up and take a walk around . I can understand that maybe they are short staffed but the only time our waitress was nice was when she handed us our check . Which I might add I had to go in and ask for after another 10 minutes of waiting when she knew we were finished . The only reason we go back is due to the perfect location .

Or is the Chinese food bad here because they are diluting all the flavors in the dishes to appeal to the \\"American\\" palate?  I think it's the latter, in King Fung Garden's case.  Here's why:\\n\\nThe ingredients were fresh, which is why they get 2 stars instead of just 1.  I feel confident they were not serving us expired produce.  But the flavors never went anywhere.  They used a single kind of sauce for two dishes that by any reasonable standard should not have tasted the same.  And the prevailing flavor of our dishes was soy sauce, not much of any other spices or seasonings.  Bland.  Diluted.  You know those fakey Asian frozen entrees they sell at grocery stores?  It tasted like that to me.  Yes, I've tried those.  Feel free to judge me.\\n\\nOh, I forgot to mention that the chicken they used in our green bean dish was so dry and tough, I avoided eating the meat all together.

The waitress told us that because the other customers, since they were non-asian, didn't want the sweet red bean soup, so they got cookies instead (every table i saw with both cookies and red bean soup were all asian). I then asked, \\"why the table behind me had the cookies and the red bean soup?\\" - which were still on the table as they were cleaning it up which then waitress then asked now if we wanted the cookies (We didn't take any after that ordeal). We ordered a total of 8 dishes for 6 people and ended up with the bill of $152. But guess what? THEY CHARGED US EXTRA ON 2 OF THE DISHES, when we questioned the waitress about it, the waitress acted as if she didn't understand what was wrong, then grudgingly fixed the price for us after we showed her the bill to the menu prices, no apologies or anything. After we got the bill fixed THEY DIDN'T ACCEPT ANYTHING BUT CASH. There were no signs outside the restaurant stating that they only accept cash. Although there was one sign behind a pot of flowers on the cash register which my brother saw after he went up to pay the bill. We also asked for a few take out containers which they didn't give us a plastic bag for until we asked for one.\\n\\nSo in conclusion, if you don't mind getting ripped off a few extra dollars (or a lot more than a few if you decide to eat seafood that charges by weight) with some attitude from the waiters/waitresses there, the food isn't bad.

They did take off the main dish price, after berating us for eating the dish--which we thought was what we had ordered--but not with any graciousness, given that it was their mistake.\\n\\nAs for the food, it should have been better than it was.  We ordered miso soup, an appetizer and several maki rolls.  The fish was fresh, but everything tasted similar perhaps because all the food was served ice cold.

I've been coming here for 20 years, but haven't visited in the last 5. Pastry recipes have changed and not for the better. \\nThe Hungarian goulash is still one of the best things on the menu. I miss the curry chicken salad! The smoked salmon sandwich had great quality salmon on it, but not much of it and the focaccia was so dry! They're serving focaccia with everything. Good with soup, way too dry as a sandwich. Way too dry to be served alone.\\nThe tiramisu has gone from the most amazing I've ever tasted to a very generic unimpressive version. The espresso in it is utterly tasteless and now there are sprinkles which just detract from the flavor of the cake. The cherry cheesecake was awful. A giant maraschino cherry on top of eggy custard. If we had tried it while we were still inside the restaurant, we would have sent it back. From the look of the other cakes and pastries in the case, they've changed everything. \\nMozart's has definitely missed the boat on changing with the times. Everything needs an update, but the recipes need to be changed back to the originals. The new location decor/setup looks like the cafeteria in a nursing home. It is possible to be a high end piano bar and cater to your aging demographic while still drawing customers (and REVENUE) from this generation of young foodies.

Soups, sandwiches, rugelach: all at your fingertips. All within a community where you'll soon find yourself a regular noticing the other regulars.\\n\\nTheir pastrami sandwiches are addictive. Their kosher potato salad on the side can't be beat. Omelettes are good, either with avocado and sour cream or spinach and feta. The bagel and cream cheese selection will leave you second guessing your choice. So, you'll have to come back and try the jalepeno cream cheese on a sun-dried tomato bagel next time 'round. The bakery selection will entice you to take something home for later.\\n\\nOne thing you'll notice right away is the menu selection, which is vast. Items are even numbered on their menu so you won't loose your place. The next thing you'll notice is the price you're about to pay. If you're a soup fan, expect to pay upwards of $4 or more for a small bowl. Portions aren't as generous as you'd expect a diner's to be. \\n\\nAs you can tell, my only gripe with Bagel Palace is the menu prices. It seems as if this NYC deli forgot to shake the NYC taxes.

But, the food is so good that I'll return and buy more. \\n\\nCome here to meet someone for lunch and be embraced by the atmosphere and the comfort casualness.

I toyed with the idea of going full vegan on some of the dishes (have them nix the meat, sour cream, and cheese), but those are essentially the bulk of the food costs. I would like to see more veggies available, not to mention, reduced prices for those deleting the costly food items from their order.\\n\\nOur children's food was delivered super fast -- too fast. While us parents appreciate the children's food coming out first, it came out way before the adults' food, which meant the timing was so that instead of us corralling wild children prior to food arriving, we were forced to corral them while simultaneously trying to eat our own food.\\n\\nOur appetizers were forgotten and rather than take them off the bill, the server put the order in again and had them delivered at the end of our meal. \\n\\nAnd it was Tuesday, so we got a pitcher of margaritas for $15, which was a great deal and apparently a regular special?

It reminds me of that old traffic jam game where you shift the cars around until you create an opening to move your car through. That's exactly what it's like in their parking lot. Usually I don't even bother and head straight for the neighboring streets. The other thing is you don't order at your table. Everyone herds up to a counter, staring at the wall menu to order. This can create a mess when it's busy and you're trying to walk in. Once you order, you walk over and get your drink. Finding a seat is not always easy, but the little (almost hidden) patio is a cool place to sit. \\nThe burgers are really amazing here, whether you go for Turkey or regular beef, you can count on a juicy, flavor-filled burger with melting cheese.

I am not fond of disaffected hipsters who care less about your patronage and more about other aspects of their job; how they present; or are otherwise distracted from their customers and their experience.

We decided the best course of action beforehand would be to grab a quick bite nearby, and since Lure was just a block over and had great reviews so far, I made a reservation for 10 PM. \\n\\nWhen the three of us arrived, Lure was pretty busy (even at that time of night), but we were quickly seated inside. Lure is a nice, more upscale seafood restaurant with a fairly big patio looking out on Crescent Avenue smack-dab in the middle of Midtown. The inside has a big bar on the right side of the restaurant as you enter and lots of nice hardwood floors, tall tables and nautical-themed decor on the walls (the good kind though, not cheesy).\\n\\nAs I said, since we were going out clubbing afterwards, we weren't planning to eat anything heavy and instead decided to order some apps and small plates to share. There are two menus served for dinner: the main menu and a smaller menu that features the fresh shellfish of the day. Seafood is predominant and consists of all kinds: mussels, scallops, many types of fish prepared every way, clams, ceviche and soups. There's also a few vegetarian dishes and other meat entrees like steak and chicken. The wine selection and mixed drinks are also very extensive.\\n\\nFor my group, we ordered calamari with onions in a red sauce, Peekytoe crab dip with toast points, some complimentary bread and butter and a smoked fish sampler platter of salmon, pollack and sable. We also had wine and vodka tonics to drink. \\n\\nLet me tell you, for just the appetizers, I was quite impressed. The smoked fish sampler and bread came out first. Yum! Each fish was beautifully presented and sliced into three servings so we all got to try one of each. They were moist and well-seasoned and very tasty either on their own or on top of a piece of the thick bread. I enjoyed the salmon the most, I think. And when the hot appetizers came next, I was even more impressed with Lure. The calamari was hands-down some of the best I've had (everyone agreed on that), and the baked Peekytoe crab dip was rich but no too thick and creamy that the thin toast points couldn't stand up to it. Very yummy.\\n\\nService was excellent from our waitress (Bonnie?), and although the prices at Lure certainly reflect the level of service and quality of food you're receiving, if you are prepared for that (or have the company's expense account at your disposal), by all means go.

It seems like everything on the menu is made with the same 9 limited ingredients.

Even though there were several people in the kitchen, our food didn't arrive for another 25-30 minutes and it was salads and steamed vegetables.

First I want to say that the staff were very nice.  Also the atmosphere was very open, spacious, comfortable, pleasant.  I liked the convenience of seating myself, grabbing my own water/menu, and being able to order at the counter.  Also to-go containers are accessible which is awesome.  I ordered the sample platter.  The quality of the produce seemed fresh.  There was very basic green salad that was simply greens and a yummy lemony dressing.  The raw corn soup was okay-  not super impressive but not bad.  It had a nice amount of spice.  The asian wrap was good- crunchy and well seasoned.  The sweet potato rice was pretty yucky in my opinion-  the starchy raw sweet potato did nothing for me and the flavors were in no way justifying the weird texture.  Raw potatoes are a bad idea.  Last there was a zucchini salad that was creamy and mediocre.  The menu had a very diverse offering and I will go back to give it another try.  Very curious about the raw mac and cheese.  Nice drink selection with specialty elixirs and beer on tap."},{"name":"Canton Cook II","address":"6690 Roswell Rd NE, Ste 410","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"4","text":"Solid \\"old school\\" Chinese restaurant.

The wine is sourced from Oregon and Washington vintners and uses nitrogen as the propellent.  All this is fascinating to me as a homebrewer!  They even sell the wine to go in 1.5-liter resealable \\"EZ-Cap\\" bottles, much like Portland's vaunted craft brewers sell their beer to go in glass growlers.

My friends have raved about their quality and service, so the expectations were very high.  \\n\\nWe had about 12 in our party, and from the get-go our waitress seemed overwhelmed and unable to handle us.  The timing of the dishes were way off - as some got theirs way earlier than others and we weren't able to enjoy eating as a group.

Every time I've visited, without fail, I've become horrendously sick to my stomach.  As a result, I suspect my in-laws think I'm a combination of sickly, delicate, prissy, hippy-dippy, and weird.  Which is 100% true in various proportions depending on the circumstances.  \\n\\nTherefore when in Ohio, I've actively sought out restaurants that minimize distress to my gut, my wallet, and my reputation.  Which has been.... difficult.  However, en route to raid one of Ohio's many pristine Targets, I noticed the sign for Edamame and felt a flicker of hope.  Ninety minutes and an armful of Rodarte for Target later, Joe and I snagged a parking spot right in front of Edamame's door and entered the Oz-like oasis of neon green lucite, likely-inauthentic wood, and exposed kelly green steel beams.  \\n\\nI was very entertained by the way they designed this space.  The logo screams national mall chain, but the interior felt more like a corporate cafeteria on the 4th floor of a skyscraper.  You know what I'm talking about... the sort done by a big-time, high-priced designer as part of management's attempt to remain hip to their employees while they cut benefits and increase layoffs. \\n\\nThe menu was unremarkable - standard for Ohio, I'd wager (a lot of cooked rolls).  I stayed away from sashimi and rolls and as a defensive maneuver ordered a really simple tofu and rice dish.  What surprised me so much were the vegetables.  They were perfectly cooked and in a unobtrusive but supremely flavorful soy-based sauce (with garlic and ginger, I think).  Each dish came with a generous side of two condiments: a thick soy sauce with scallion and a ginger sauce.  Both were excellent but to be truthful, the vegetables were done so well they didn't really need any additional condiments.  \\n\\nA quick note on the service: their system is unconventional but seems to work well so I have no complaints there.

It was so greasy, it didn't cut right at all, it tasted so gross and it slid around the plate like it was a hockey puck.

The inside is, in terms of square footage, somewhere between a postage stamp and a toolshed, cramming in just a half-dozen tables or so. Gari's decor is a little strange. No wilting orchids and Japanese prints here, just odd finger-like chandeliers with Technicolor lightbulbs (think Ikea circa 1997) and a strange crystal perched on a glass shelf.***\\n\\nSo as for sushi. Everything was good to great. California roll was a tad bland, of course, but I never liked them and they were ordered for our Sooshi Noob, perennially afraid of all things raw. Grilled eel, forever my favorite, was a winning version with that damn delicious unagi sauce particularly smoky and sweet here. A softshell crab roll was fatty and grand; it's fried, so, you know, how can it be bad? (Other than horribly bad for me; clogged arteries say \\"hey-o!\\") Yellowtail sashimi was also really fresh and toothsome in a good way. No slippery, slidey, mushy fishy here. Gari doesn't offer the most beautiful presentation as far as sushi plates go, but all of our rolls were very good. Shockingly, not a thing was doused in mayonnaise so I didn't feel SO fat. Just like, a little fat. A tiny bit fat. A tiny fat. Adorable.\\n\\nThe place was mostly empty for Saturday lunch, though I've seen it get quite busy at night. Service was fine, but we were essentially the only ones there. It's hard to forget customers if you've got nothing else to do but read the Metro. Really decent, nicely-priced sushi right around the corner. Not the most innovative but definitely worth a few trips. Like, maybe Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.\\n\\n\\n***Footnote! ...

Like all restaurants, things cannot always be perfectly perfect.  The difference with Northstar is the lengths they go to make it right.  Yes, Northstar is expensive, but when something's not right, they do exactly what a business should do: they listen, they fix it, AND they give you a free meal next time.  That's what I especially love about the Beechwold location.  Even when the food just takes a little bit longer than they'd like coming out, they give you the next meal on them (without you even complaining about it)!

They have an excellent brunch on Sundays, and they always have inventive cocktails.\\n\\nSo you are probably thinking, why the 1 star review. My last experience at Stephanie's was so appalling that it must be shared.\\n\\nAfter dinner in the South End, my fiance and I headed home, thinking we would step into Stephanie's for an after dinner cocktail (or two). We love the dark lighting and the ambiance, so we thought it would be a romantic way to end the evening. \\n\\nMy fiance ordered a scotch, I ordered a cinnamon martini; but we didn't get to enjoy our drinks. I actually was a little scared to sit there. Why? Because an exceedingly drunk man sitting at the bar started air boxing, knocking over glasses, and yelling. At first, a female bartender stared him down, a male bartender asked him to calm down, and I thought that would be the end of it. No. Instead, they all ended up fist bumping, he was given more drinks, and he got louder and more violent. \\n\\nI watched patrons closer to where he was close out their tabs and head for the door. A group of three sitting having a late dinner at the bar got up and left without finishing their food. He ruined the experiences of countless patrons, and what did the bartenders do? They kept serving this man more and more alcohol, even though he could have easily punched out a patron walking by him to get to the bathroom.  \\n\\nIn the course of the half hour we were there (yes, things went downhill that quickly, five people other than ourselves left. We would have ordered a second round, too. Instead, we were too scared to sit their any longer. I could not focus on my fiance but, instead, watched the man intently to make sure his full arm, close-fisted swings wouldn't come our way and knock my man unconscious. \\n\\nIt cost Stephanie's at least another 50 bucks from our table, not to mention building the tabs from the patrons who also left. We expected an apology as we left but received nothing. Our romantic evening turned into a conversation on how irresponsible Stephanie's was by continuing to serve this man who had no business ordering another drink. Had a patron gotten punched out, it would have been a lawsuit.

Candi's was busy but not overcrowded. We waited in the doorway to be seated, only to have the four-top who walked in after us be seated first; our presence wasn't acknowledged by the hostess/waitress. A few moments later we were seated, then waited a solid 10 minutes for our server to take our food and beverage order at the same time.\\n\\nAfter ordering, I walked over to the restroom, which was clean, except for the fact that someone had given him or herself a haircut that morning, leaving the scissors by the sink, and a nice coating of hair on the sink and floor.\\n\\nI rejoined my friend and then waited about 45 minutes for our food to arrive, while all of the table who arrived after us were fed. Having to endure the wait with no refills on their already weak coffee and somebody's stray toddler terrorizing the dining space was pretty unbearable. We ordered the stuffed biscuits, and it states on the menu that they will take about 20 minutes to cook, but it failed to mention that they would arrive overdone. The oil from the five cheeses and hollandaise that I ordered didn't help; it took a considerable amount of sawing in order for me to take a bite.\\n\\nAt the end of the meal, we went to the register to check out, and our server, who had come by our table once to take the order, and once to drop the food and walk away, asked, \\"Oh, did she not bring you your check?\\" I don't think she knew she waited on us. At this point she asked how the food was, and when we told her it was overcooked, she wondered if the hollandaise helped mine, and told my friend she should have ordered gravy. I didn't realize sauces had the ability to un-burn food. Who knew?\\n\\nThe only positive part of Saturday's experience was that we used the Scoutmob, so at least we got a discount.

I went there very recently and found that the place was seriously crowded with only 3-4 waiters serving all those people. Earlier there was white sheet that they used to cover the tables. Those have been removed not sure why. I think this is one reason why people here are commenting about the place being dark and dingy. I had ordered Chicken Bhuna Masala but when the dish was served I felt it was no different than the Chicken Tikka Masala. BTW, the chicken pieces were too big for this dish. Pongal has been my favorite restaurant in the Boston area and I have recommended this to anyone who wanted to taste an authentic Indian food.

The hosts and waitstaff were really friendly and helpful when ordering if we had any questions. Last time we ordered the dim sum, haiku roll, yama yama roll (to me this tastes like a large fair all rolled into sushi), spider roll, dragon roll, and Philadelphia roll. All of them were delicious! The sauce that comes with the dim sum was great! All the cuts of fish were extremely fresh and the rolls were perfectly cold enough and warm enough (depending on the type of roll). The waitress told us which was which when she brought them out. \\n\\nThis visit we had the soft shell crab as an appetizer which was smaller than we thought but still really delicious. The lime vinaigrette was so so good so make sure you're dipping in that! We then got the yama yama roll and haiku roll again because we loved them from last time. We tried the harvest roll which was similar to the yama yama but more like fall and not as much like fair food. We also tried the veggie fotomaki roll which is pickled Japanese veggies. It was good but nothing to rave about. \\n\\nOverall a great dining experience. The barstaff is also very friendly and helpful and the bar is small but sufficient for this type of establishment.

The fish in all of these was excellent, very fresh, very subtly flavored. Good fatty salmon has this almost buttery way it melts in your mouth. You just have to close your eyes and focus on the food. The fatty tuna is even more delicate, and demands your full attention.\\n\\nWhich brings me to my complaint and the reason I'm giving four stars instead of five. Every piece of fish truly was excellent, but the chef was heavy handed with the wasabe, and worse -- added a sauce to each piece of fish. This is regrettable on a $14 piece of fatty tuna. \\n\\nThe urchin with quail egg is not for beginners, but I definitely recommend it. The different flavors and textures add up to a piece of sushi you can savor for many minutes. The second time is always better because you've gotten over the fear and can appreciate the tastes and creamy textures. If you're curious to try it but worried, keep a large piece of ginger handy. At the first sign of trouble, bite into that and all will be well :-)\\n\\nThe Texas Hybrid is a good finish. You have to eat this last because it's overpowering, and you won't be able to taste anything else after. It's a feast of creamy garlic and jalapeno and your choice of salmon or tuna in a ricepaper-wrapped roll.

We went to a show at the Paradise Rock Club (right next door) Sunday and BurgerFi was behind the line outside to get in. Seemed logical to pop in, grab a quick bite and a cheap beer and wait out the crowd, right? Wrong. Took twenty minutes to process a line of six people because customers who had already been served kept cutting in to complain about their food orders being incorrect.

I picked the place because of it's menu and proximity to where my in-laws were staying.  The music was really loud, which is fine for a bar, but makes it impossible to talk over and, in the case of our waitress, hear what the customer is ordering. \\nWe had to change tables a couple times, once for my father-in-law's back and the second because we had moved to a reserved table. Not a problem. The manager was very apologetic and gave us a chair for my father-in-law, and even gave us a comp sushi roll for the trouble. Might I add that the manager was excellent. He is certainly excluded from my claim of bad service, but our waitress . . . horrible. \\n\\nAfter waiting 15 minutes or so for service, some waitress ran by us in a huge hurry and said I'll be right with you guys. She came back about 10 minutes later to take our order. She never smiled and was never cordial. When the food came she had got one of the sushi rolls wrong and apparently never heard my mother-in-law order Sashimi. I blame this on the blaring music. \\n\\nThe food was good, some things were excellent. The sushi was average. You can get the same quality for half the price at a dozen places around town. The ribs were my favorite item. \\n\\nAfter we had all finished our plates, the only item left was my mother-in-law's Sashimi plate. We waited about 30 minutes before having to catch the attention of our waitress, who had not checked on us ONCE during this time. We had empty beer glasses sitting on the table. That's money to be made. I might have had three beers that night if she stayed on top of it, but instead I only had one. We asked about the plate. Her exact and curt response was, \\"The plates come out as they are made. I have no control over that. \\" And then she quickly ran off before we could reply. \\n\\nWe eventually had to ask the manager about our Sashimi and told him how long it had been. He quickly took care of it and comped the dish.  Our waitress came by a little while later to throw the plate on the table and give us a half-hearted apology before she ran off again. We discussed desert but decided it wasn't worth the wait. \\n\\nSo if you add up the two free plate and the two more beers I would have had, Yakuza lost out on about $40 dollars of business that night.  I'm not including the beers anyone else in our party would have had or the desert we decided not to have. Of course, we don't even know if they have deserts, we were never offered a desert menu. \\n\\nDefinitely in the top 3 of worst waitresses I've ever encountered in my life. I kept asking, \\"Are we being punished for something?\\"\\n\\n I would only ever go back to try the burger, but I would sit at the bar and I wouldn't bring my family."},{"name":"Canton Cooks","address":"5984 Roswell Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Simply delicious, and authentic.

We received a small plate of tortilla chips with no more than a couple tablespoons shredded cheese sprinkled on top. Not melted. Nothing else. Does that qualify as nachos?

The service is exceptional and food is delicious. We started off at the bar while we waited for the rest of our party. Brian was so nice and easygoing.

I've been here twice and was put to sleep with the most delicious brisket and biscuits (with honey butter I've ever had).  \\n\\nIt's in a great location right by Fenway and is a great space.  There are large wooden tables spread throughout the space as well as a large bar to sit at.  It all looks out onto Boylston so it's a great spot to hang out and people watch. \\n\\nAs soon as you walk in here you're slapped in the face with smokey meat and I'm all for it.  As soon as we sat down, I got to business.  We ordered the salt and pepper potatoes, one rib and a bucket of biscuits to start.  I got the brisket plate with BBQ beans and my mom got the pulled chicken with collard greens.  The potatoes were large crispy, flaky chunks of potatoes perfectly fried and served with a nice dill, mayo dipping sauce.  It was a pretty good portion and these were delicious.  The rib was super juicy and moist and full of smokey flavor.  I had tried the biscuits during my first trip so I knew what I was expecting.  These things are flaky, dense, cavernous mountains of dough layered to perfection.  These are the best biscuits I've ever had and if I died with one in my mouth I'd die happy.  Add the honey butter to this and you have the best combo of all-time.  Honestly you could come here and eat nothing but the biscuits and honey butter and leave completely satisfied.  \\n\\nThe brisket is more tender and juicier than any piece of BBQ I've ever had.  It's awesome on its own and when you throw in their sauces it takes it to another level.  They give you a generous portion for the lunch plate as well.  It's hard to imagine getting anything other than this when I come here.  The beans were alright.  A little harder than I would have liked and I was not a huge fan of the sauce on them but they weren't bad.  My mom's pulled chicken was very moist and flavorful.  It tasted a little salty for my tastes but still probably the best pulled chicken I've had.  The collards were awesome.  These collards were mixed with little chunks of meat and the flavor permeated throughout the entire cup of them.  I could eat these as a side with every meal. \\n\\nOverall, this place is a must visit if you like BBQ at all or just good food in general.  The service has been speedy and attentive each time I've been there and I can't really say anything negative about the place.

I've been for lunch and dinner; I've dined alone, with a date, and as part of a group; and I've tried most of Sweet Cheeks' menu. Obviously I like the place. For years Boston had two top BBQ spots, Blue Ribbon and Redbones. The food at Sweet Cheeks is every bit as good as those, and the overall dining experience (seating, comfort, decor) is much better. I think it's now the #1 spot.\\n\\nThe whole menu is great, but I have some favorites. Start with the biscuits. They are oversized and dry and fantastic, with or without the honey butter. Try the lemonade. It's rich, sweet, and complex. The collard greens are pure umami, and they go great with every entree. For dessert, there's a dinner-plate-sized nutter butter cookie you can share with a friend, or a thick butterscotch pudding--topped with a sugary syrup to trap in moisture, and bits of delicious contrasting salt--that you can keep all to yourself.\\n\\nFor entrees, I don't have a preference. They're all great. For dinner Sweet Cheeks serves a fried chicken plate that comes crunchy, well seasoned, and plentiful. (Yes, there's a breast. That's always my question with fried chicken.) The pulled meat sandwiches are great on Texas toast. Even the various BBQ sauces are interchangeably tasty. My only advice is to try different things, because that's what I keep doing and I haven't been disappointed yet.\\n\\nI have one criticism of Sweet Cheeks, and it's structural. During late afternoon, half the seats in the restaurant face a sun-glaring window, and for some reason Sweet Cheeks hasn't yet invested in a shade. I know it sounds like a silly nitpick, but if you end up sitting down at three o'clock, you'll see what I mean. I've asked to move my seat, and I have overheard other customers doing the same. If anybody from the restaurant sees this review, I'm sure they will know exactly what I'm talking about. The window just needs a simple remote-controlled shade along the top edge, and the problem would be fixed.\\n\\nOverall, Sweet Cheeks is a win for Boston. I get cravings for it, which is one of my tests for a \\"favorite\\" restaurant.

The crust was awesome. \\n\\nThere is a separate line for take out only and they have a meal on the menu which is on a scale so that even underprivileged people can get an awesome organic meal.

Delicious. I love the Harvard Street with a bunch of basil....mmmm.  I was so excited when this Upper Crust location moved into the South End -- just what we needed around here.  I ordered from them once, and was dissappointed to see that my pie arrived folded over onto itself with cheese all over the place.  As a result I enjoyed half a pizza with cheese, the other half with none.  But I wrote that off.  I ordered from them again, and did takout this time versus delivery.  This time, my Hingham pizza was pretty darn skimpy on the scallops (but at least it was flat and not folded over).  I ordered from them for the third time last week, writing off the first two experiences, and my large pizza arrived, filling only about 2/3 of the box.  Those were some small pieces of pizza for what we paid and it was pretty clear it was not a full large size from the excess cardboard around the edges of the box.  So that is three times where I have been dissappointed.  The third time I had guests and it was a shame because I felt like I had talked up the Upper Crust and then we didn't have quite enough food to feel comfortably full.  I feel like this Upper Crust location needs to up the ante on the quality of pizza they are distributing.  I know they can do better!!  And I want them to!

The food was wonderful but it took awhile but came out piping hot which was great. There are like 3 big screen tvs i think placed very high up above the tables which confused me because it appeared to be like a bar instead of an restaurant. No one can watch the tvs because the people are so far below them and the people at the bar have their back to them. It's also very noisy and if you sit by the door it's freezing. They put the air on when the smoke from the cooking filled the space which made alot of people put their coats on. I was served an ice tea and they gave me a bottle with a short straw. My mom asked if I could get a glass and the waiter brought one without ice. You never serve ice tea without ice. You could tell that the wait staff is very inexperienced but they seem to try and believe what they are doing is fine but it's not. My mom said the raviolis she ordered were some of the best she's had but because the service was less to be desired she would not go back.

We requested that the kids be served first - so they got the kids menu out by about 9.30 pm (just a few lassis, noodles and a mini idli). We waited and waited and waited after that and were very annoyed to find complete chaos - many people waiting indefinitely, many just walking away tired of waiting and people being served out of order. How can you run a supposedly successful restaurant by clearing having no pattern to your customers orders? Then finally at 10 pm we could not take it any more and we decided to walk out. The bastard Manager was unapologetic and even told us that his was a \\"special\\" restaurant - my ass special - my business will never be given to you morons again. He even told us that we had placed our order at 8.50 pm and it was only 10 pm - no apologies, no nothing!!! The server was laughing his ass off as if he found the whole thing amusing.

Julia had great difficulty with splitting the checks correctly, but seemed very unapologetic the entire time. After waiting an additional 45 minutes to the 30 min wait I have been originally told. Julia walked up to the counter and told me \\"we don't have the calzone you ordered ready yet, but we do have another one ready would you like that one instead?\\" Keep in mind that she had already charged me for the more expensive calzone I had already ordered.

According to China Palace, an egg roll is a spring roll, which I thought was a little egg roll...This wouldn't have been so bad if they were delicious but they were tasteless...almost, there was a little egg taste.\\n\\nNext we have the peppersteak.

Got a groupon to come and try it out (had never heard of the place before) and were excited to try something new.  Service was mediocre (not enough staff to keep tabs on all the tables) and the food was okay, but not great.  \\n\\nTwo main complaints are:\\n#1. The menu says 3 Belgian waffles but really it only comes with two.  These are small square waffles (about 4\\"x4\\") and I was shocked that they would charge $9.00 for two small waffles and syrup.  This is not even close to a regular size round Belgian waffle that most places serve (that often come with meat for the same price).  I asked for the waffle plain but it came with whipped cream so I sent it back, when I got it back plain it was partially burned but at that point I wasn't going to argue again.\\n\\n#2.  The groupon is for $24 but they only took off $21 from the bill.  When I asked why I was told that it was only for the food (not coffee).  This is not what it said on the Groupon--yes I checked the fine-print (it only excluded alcohol)--when I challenged her on this she just said that is how it works.  Now if the food/service was good I wouldn't make much of an issue of this, but it wasn't, so this made things ever worse.  \\n\\nSo Groupon users beware and for all, if you are hungry don't order the waffles."},{"name":"Artesanal","address":"5226 SE 26th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"i cannot believe what just happened to me at this place, holy crap!

Boston-born, former Top Chef contestant Tiffany Faison's vision for a modern BBQ joint is awesome - I'm a big fan of the place. From the menu to the decor, the service and the style, I totally dig it and from my first visit on, I felt both welcomed and very comfortable.\\n\\nLet's face it folks, Boston has always been lacking in terms of solid BBQ. Sure there' the Village Smokehouse in Brookline, but their hours are weird, parking can be a bitch and their menu is on the pricey side. There's always Blue Ribbon out in Newton and Arlington but that's not exactly in Boston now is it... Then came this place, a big, conveniently located restaurant, built out of wood, with a large patio which is going to open soon (I can't flippin' wait!) and which also features a solid drink list. What differentiates this place from others, food aside, is the fact that the food is served in trays. Now some might cringe at this but I think that it's great. First off, it's super easy, secondly it's consistent and best of all, it's affordable and makes sure that every patron is set with bread, pickles and onions. Goodbye overcrowded table and hello elbow room: I dig the concept and the execution. It's a lot less messy too as the tray 'contains' everything and nothing leaks out of it onto the table either.\\n\\nThe tray aside, you basically can order sandwiches or various meats like ribs, pulled chicken, pulled pork, brisket and even pork belly. You can get a single meat, two or even three if you're a fat mess. Then you get to pick from a selection of both cold and warm sides ranging from the classic collard greens and mac and cheese and more creative ones like the carrot & raisin salad and the cheese casserole. There's 10 of them to pick from and the cheapest combination featuring a single meat and two sides will run you anywhere from $16 to $25 depending on what you get. The 'Big Cheeks' tray featuring two meats runs at $24 and the even bigger 'Fat Cheeks' tray is $26. Personally, I've never once been able to finish a tray featuring one meat but usually order two because I like the variety and it's not much more expensive - plus they pack it very neatly when you take the remaining food to go... so it makes for another tasty leftover feast!\\n\\nThere's a few more items like biscuits, fried okra, hush puppies and even fried green tomatoes. I've had the latter and it was pretty good. They also have the absolutely delicious Sprecker root beer ($5) which might be the very best root beer out there. It's a bit expensive but oh so tasty.\\n\\nBut enough about the food, let's talk about the decor. The place is has a lot of tables and even a bar in the back which can seat a decent amount of people. The place is pretty much all wood and has few decorative items but just enough to give it a neat atmosphere. There's large windows on the side which faces Boylston street. Each table has 3 small bottles featuring distinct BBQ sauces which are made in-house - a vinegar based one, a hot one and a regular one.  \\n\\nIn the front of the house, the friendly hostess directs the crowd but the place isn't always big enough to accomodate everyone - it's in a very busy area and it quite popular. Almost every time I've been there I've had to wait for a table except for the one time I went there on a weeknight late at night. I'm going to go ahead and assume that trying to eat there before a Red Sox game is going to be impossible, even with their soon-to-open terrace; I really hope that I'm wrong... \\n\\nAll and all this is a welcome addition to the Boston BBQ scene with some tasty, juicy BBQ'd meats, an innovative presentation via the trays and some pretty tasty drinks and desserts. And while it is a bit expensive, the food is very tasty and the portions large enough to cover you for a late night snack later or even a second meal later depending on your appetite. Service is efficient but the lines, at times, can discourage quite a few... And it looks like I found yet another reason to return soon as I just read in Forbes magazine that the biscuits which Faison makes might content as the best in our nation: guess I'll have to find out for myself on another trip there, which hopefully will be soon..."},{"name":"Toji Korean Grill House","address":"4615 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Being from Jersey the one thing I miss is the cornucopia of authentic Korean restaurants. Toji however might be the go to Korean restaurant.  Yes it is a bit pricey, but most Korean restaurants are. The good thing is you will never leave without feeling completely stuffed.  The servers were super nice and attentive, and the restaurant itself was spotless.  It is great for those new to Korean food because it gives you the Korean dining experience without scaring the hell out of you. I only had the combination meat platter (delicious), so I can't speak for the rest of the entrees. However, there is nothing like designating a person to grill slabs of meat and divvy it to your guests.  The best way to go is in a larger group and splitting a combination plate.  The only thing negative I have to say is that I wish they would have a better variety of \\"banchan\\" (side dishes.) The last time I went I only got different types of \\"kimchee.\\" \\n\\nThis is not your average hole in the wall Korean restaurant that overruns the Beaverton area.  The quality is much better.

I dined here alone one night in Boston, and the place romanced me like no man has recently done (unfortunately).\\n\\nEveryone on staff was simply lovely: the hostess who answered when I called to check if I needed a reservation (I didn't); the manager who seated me; and my waitress Ashley, who provided excellent recommendations.\\n\\nMy meal started off with a bread basket filled with a warm, soft roll and a delicious raisin scone. It should be illegal to offer that many carbohydrates before I even have a chance to look at the menu. I ordered a glass of Rancho Zabaco Zinfandel, a cup of the Boston Clam Chowder, and the Pecan Crusted Warm Goat Cheese Salad (field greens, spiced pecans, late harvest pears, toasted brioche and balsamic vinaigrette).\\n\\nThe wine was fruit-forward and spicy, exactly as I'd hoped, and the clam chowder was rich and decadent. But the salad - WOW. I'm not really a salad girl, but that is the best salad I've ever tasted. It arrived slightly deconstructed, with slices of pear along one side of the plate, toasted croutons on the other, and the toasted brioche atop the field greens and spiced pecans, crowned with a beautiful warm cake of goat cheese crusted in breadcrumbs and crushed pecans. *swoon* I was already starting to slow down after eating the clam chowder, but I managed to eat about a third of the salad. It's definitely large enough to share and a spectacular dish if you are fond of goat cheese.\\n\\nI didn't need dessert, but I figured if it was anywhere near as good as everything else I'd ordered, it would be a shame to miss out on it. Ashley recommended the Pineapple Upside Down Cake, which was served over caramel sauce with a side of vanilla ice cream. Soft, gooey, sweet, and perfect...I nibbled away at as much as I could before my stomach pleaded with me to stop.\\n\\nI love comfort food and I adore good service, so Stephanie's is definitely on the list of places to revisit when I come back to Boston."},{"name":"Nagoya Sushi","address":"5661 Red Bug Lake","city":"Winter Springs","stars":"4","text":"Sushi is awesome here, they have an email club as well as coupons on restaurant.com.

I found  the arrangement of seating very comfortable and the natural brick of the building gorgeous. We were seated by Anthony who was more than pleasant and had a lovely blonde waitress who was just awesome.  We started with a Rissoto and i loved it! We are both fussy about mushrooms but i didnt even mind because it was so good. The Hubby got the chicken dish and enjoyed it very much.

Everything my friends and I had was fantastic. I had the pulled pork tray with a scoop of mac n cheese and a scoop of black eyed peas served with two slices of white bread, pickles and onions. We got a bucket of biscuits to share and I could live off those for days, the honey butter that came with them was a perfect companion. We all tried various cocktails in mason jars and were equally pleased-I particularly liked the apple moonshine beverage. The drink I ordered was a take on a Manhattan but quite a bit sweeter than the standard, too sweet for my taste.\\n\\nOur server was very helpful and charming. She answered every question we had, gave great advice and when one of us needed to order food to go for a friend who couldn't have garlic she brought us a menu with all the non-garlic items circled by one of the chefs. She was super. \\n\\nThe only thing that kept them from 5 stars is the atmosphere. It was very, very loud. The tables are lovely refinished wood but they are rather wide (which is helpful with all the food you get) but makes it even harder to hear your table-mates. There are at least 7 TV's throughout the space which is about 5 too many in my opinion. Between the noise from the other customers and the TV's playing a variety of different shows and then the music (which was a great selection of everything from hip-hop to classic blues but all played a bit too loud) it gets very distracting and hard to focus on the people you're with. Two of the TV's were playing a reality show about plastic surgery which was really graphic and not exactly what I wanted to watch while eating a lot of tasty meat. \\n\\nThey do have great options for take out so I think that's what I'll be doing in the future.

This place is a slight notch above as far as feeling authentic with the metal trays and brown paper, but both the chic looking bar and the pop music playing in the background are clear giveaways.\\n\\nThe baby back ribs are the best thing I tried.  The flavor soaks through the whole rib.  Instead of a smoke ring, the whole chuck of meat has a pink-ish coloring.  Its plenty good without any sauce.  Going off of two plates of brisket, it seems like there's a conscious effort to mix the fatty and lean chunks evenly into every serving.  The whole pile is just greasy enough and it's tender enough that you don't need a knife to cut it up.\\n\\nFor the sides, the mac + cheese was solid.  It's not the fancy-mac that every steakhouse offers, just solid, totally orange, mac + cheese.  The barbeque beans are different than the other local bbq joints I've tried.  It's more earthy, bitter, even, and completely addicting.

It seemed mildly crowded when we first arrived, around 7:15.  We slid into our comfy giant booth and began browsing the menu.  I had high hopes for this place because the atmosphere looked nice and elegant, and the prices were not terribly outlandish.  But hotel restaurants can be hit or miss...\\n\\nWe decided to start with the Tuscan bean dip with flatbread, pesto, fontina cheese and salsa.  It was very delicious.  The key is layering all these goodnesses together onto one delicious piece of warm flatbread.  The table bread was also served warm, which is always a plus.\\n\\nBut that is where my positive review ends.  We waited for over 30 minutes after we received our appetizer to get our main courses, and we had all ordered \\"small plates\\" (aka appetizers) and salads, which should not have taken that long.  My co-worker from South Carolina ordered the oysters, and she said they were the worst she's ever had; very fishy tasting.  The crab cakes were dry, which is pretty hard to do, and there was a giant piece of uncooked potato in the mashed potatoes.  The seared ahi was bland,  and the arugula salad had about 3 times too much dressing on it, plus it was wrapped in some sort of a hard taco shell type thing.  Very strange.\\n\\nWe did not have dessert, which I guess might be a bright spot.  But if you must eat here, my only recommendation is the bean dip, so I hope you're not too hungry.

I'm gluten-free so the idea of a full menu I could eat was heartening. I didn't realize it was opened by the Prasad folks, that would have been a draw for me. \\n\\nSo, we came back in and stood there. And stood there. No one behind the counter even looked up at us. So we eventually took our original menu and sat down. No one looked up. No greeting. No sign of what to do. So my companion went up to the counter and they told him indeed, you order there. Good enough but maybe a sign by the door: \\"Come in, welcome! Please grab a menu and order at the counter.\\" Or a greeter? A sign by the counter? A note at the top of the menu? Anything? \\n\\nDecor was an odd combination of the old bar and the new restaurant. Oddly spare for the feel of the farm tables and fleur de lis wallpaper. My buddy suggested that it looked like someone came in and \\"took all the good stuff,\\" which made me laugh. Nonetheless, it was a pleasant environment. \\n\\nThe juice and smoothie menus are extensive. I got the Melody Juice and it was the perfect blend of ingredients.  The vegan GF mac & cheese \\"Hawthorne Mac\\" was quite good with large chunks of kale mixed in. My friend got the stir fry, also good. Lots of veggies. Rice noodles were a little overcooked but it was so veggie heavy that it didn't really matter. Light spice. Nice balance. \\n\\nI'll go back and revise my rating up, I would surmise, as they work out the kinks. I really think table service would elevate this place greatly. \\n\\nOh, if anyone from the restaurant is actually reading this, it would be great to note on the menu, in addition to the fact that you should go to the counter and order food, that lunch is served through the dinner hour, it's a little confusing."},{"name":"8 State Bistro","address":"8 N State St","city":"Westerville","stars":"4","text":"8 State Bistro has a wonderful menu with food that you would never receive anywhere else.

This place is very nice, has great food, amazing coffee, and the line is just a jarring experience.  The first time my wife and I went for dinner, we turned around and walked out because it just felt weird to stand in a line to order a $20 steak.

So on our first visit to Boston after she opened her very own eatery, husband and I headed out to the Fenway neighborhood to check out her venture, inspired by a road trip through Texas.\\n\\nRight away I liked the backyard-cookout-meets-industrial-park vibe; I didn't like the salty hostess who huffed at giving the two of us a four-top despite it being a 3 o'clock lull and the place nearly empty.  Our server was really lovely and helpful, however, a highpoint of our visit.  She started us with some drinks while we scoped out the menu -- a Leinenkugel Summer Shandy for me and a House Bill 819 corn whiskey cocktail for him (served, like every libation here, in Ball jars).  \\n\\nWe settled on a Fat Cheeks Tray to split: a choice of three barbequed meats and two \\"scoops\\", or sides: one hot, one cold.  For himself, husband picked out the brisket, pulled chicken, and pulled pork.  I added the mac 'n' cheese and Farm Salad -- arugula, wheatberries, Parmesan, plums, and candied hazelnuts.  The tray also came with white bread and house-brined pickles and onions, \\"for making sandwiches like they do in Texas,\\" our waitress informed us.  Everything was fine, but I guess I expected far better from a Top Chef.  Especially considering the sky-high prices.\\n\\nThe mac 'n' cheese was excellent: creamy and al dente but I could have done without the Ritz crackers crumbled on top.  The Farm Salad, while completely awesome in concept and pleasant in flavor, was undercut by over-dressing.  Three homemade sauce options were available on the table -- traditional, Carolina vinegar, and haba√±ero -- which I sampled with my Wonderbread and on my macs.  Again, for Top Chef conceived sauces, I was unimpressed.  And despite being a fan of heat, the haba√±ero was so hot it incapacitated my palate for awhile.  Husband was a bit underwhelmed by the barbeque itself: the brisket was a little dry, surprising considering an entire half of the plated portion was fat cap; the pork was standard; the chicken was his preferred of the three, tho honestly he felt that all of them lacked that distinctive BBQ tang and smoke.  His verdict was that this was average, three-star barbeque.\\n\\nI have \\"Top Chef\\" issues.  I'll eat anywhere associated with the show.

Yes, that's hella random. But they roast their own coffee there, and the whole place smells delicious. If awakeness had a smell, it would smell like Stauf's.\\n\\nNow that I've got that out of my system, I should mention that the drinks here are also pretty decent. Ironically, for someone who loves coffee so much, I normally get tea when I come here. Namely because A) I come here at night to study, and I don't need a whole cup of coffee at 9pm, and B) they have a WALL OF TEA. Yep, a whole wall of loose teas that you can make your own bag with, or you can buy it in bulk to take home. The selection is fantastic, probably about as good as you're going to find outside a specialty tea place. \\n\\nAs a study place, Stauf's has its goods and bads like any other Columbus coffee house. There are lots of tables just big enough for 2-3 people to hang at, and it's quiet enough that I can focus but not eerily silent. The outdoor seating is nice when it's warm and not raining (so like, 2 months out of the year). But the outlet situation kind of stinks, and I think they might win some kind of award for most uncomfortable wooden chairs ever. With some cushy chairs and more outlets though, I might just move in. \\n\\nRandom side note: the parking situation may or may not suck depending on when you show up. During weekdays, the parking out back is nice- you don't have to parallel park or jockey for a spot. Nighttime Thursday-Saturday though, expect to be circling the lot like a vulture waiting for another car to move. You'll eventually get a spot, but it might take some time. \\n\\nIf you prefer to make your coffee at home, this is a great place to buy your beans (ground or whole). And like I said above, the bulk loose teas are reasonably priced and they have a great selection. They also have a decent number of french presses, mugs, and other miscellaneous supplies to help you get caffeined up. So even if you don't need a new hang out spot, it's worth your time to drop in and do some shopping."},{"name":"Rolling In Thyme & Dough","address":"333 W Hwy 290","city":"Dripping Springs","stars":"4","text":"Adorable place!

The majority of the plate was full of mashed potatoes and some cabbage.  For $10 (shepherd's pie) you get some meeting in gravy on your plate, not in the 'normal' bowl with a large glop of potatoes on top with cheese.  The majority of the plate is filled with coleslaw.  Typically coleslaw is supposed to compliment your entree, but in this case it was the other half.  I think the head chef needs to spend more time on the menu.

I happened to be in the area running errands during the lunch hour and decided to give it a try for  a quick bite to eat. Judging by the exterior and geographic location (it's directly across the street from Buckhead Diner) I was expecting the typical desperate Buckhead crowd; however, much to my surprise and enjoyment, that simply wasn't the case.\\n\\nFood: Buckead Bread Company can best be described as a Panera Bread with a smidgen of class. As can be inferred from the name, they do have a full service bakery with an assortment of breads and desserts. However, they also offer sit down service (Corner Cafe) that features a nice assortment of soups, salads, and various sandwiches. On my first visit, I opted for the crusted chicken roll salad, which was sizable, fresh, and well flavored. My partner ordered the chicken salad sandwich, which was quite large and much to his liking. On the way out, we also purchases a red velvet cupcake from the case. Unfortunately, it was exceedingly dry and the alleged cream cheese frosting was virtually devoid of said cheese.\\n\\nService: Upon entry, we were promptly greeted and seated. Shortly thereafter, the waitress arrived and she remained friendly and attentive throughout the duration of the meal. The restaurant portion was also at full capacity, so I was impressed that they were able to maintain such a high level of service.\\n\\nAtmosphere: There isn't much ambience here, but I'd consider it a perfect place for a quick business lunch or for church ladies to meet up and talk some trash. The clientele is mostly your typical trendy Buckhead types and there also seems to be a fairly large contingent of regulars. However, it appeared to me that the regulars and non-regulars were being treated to the same level of upstanding service.\\n\\nPrice: Overall, I found the prices to be commensurate with the quality of the food. Both the salad and sandwich were around $12 each, which I personally consider a steal for that locale. The cupcake was $2.50, but it was also extremely large.\\n\\nOther: The parking lot is cramped and tricky to navigate. If at all possible, your best bet is to enter the lot through the side street directly adjacent to the restaurant (East Paces Ferry), as opposed to the entrance on Piedmont."},{"name":"Chela Tequila & Tacos","address":"183 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Chela Tequila & Tacos is a perfectly decent taco establishment.

This food is a combination of flavors that explode in your mouth. The kitchen is putting together items that you may not consider they go together however, they make every bite a taste sensation. There are times in your restaurant travels that you find food that looks good and the taste does not match this is not one of those times. No plate is pre assembled or prepared to look exactly the same.

That sounds like a joke or that I'm trying to be funny, but it's true.  It was a place of comfort during a rough part of my life.\\n\\nAnyway....I've been looking for something like Donkey in Columbus.  Stauf's has come the closest.\\n\\nIt's great because there's a lot of space, the tables aren't crammed together, there's outdoor seating, prices are reasonable - less than $2 for a cup of coffee or tea.  Fancier things are up around $3 and $4, pretty standard from my perspective.  The baristas were standard - friendly and fast, but nothing extraordinary.  Coffee was good, and the merchandise section is pretty neat and unique for Columbus.\\n\\nThey could definitely improve, though, and I think they could make some easy changes.  First, more stuff on the walls.  There were some big bare spots that could hold some nice local art, or just something.  The lighting is pretty good - it manages to be dark enough even with big windows.  Ideally, they'd get some floor-lamps in there to provide nice, localized lighting for a nice cozy, close atmosphere.  Also, hardwood floors = huge plus.  Everywhere else in Columbus has tile!  Why?  It feels so sterile.\\n\\nSo Stauf's is pretty good.

Against the far back wall were authentic family style sofa-booths.   we then received warm toasted pita bread with feta cheese an butter (which was delicious!). We then ordered water and a Shiraz dough. It is a Greek yogurt an mint drink served over ice. Very refreshing in my opinion but an acquired taste for sure. Next we ordered a few appetizers we started with the falafel, followed by hummus an tabbouleh. The falafel was my favorite of the three but all were excellent. The tabbouleh was very fresh, packed with herbs an garlic over diced tomatoes. The hummus was smooth and creamy an perfectly paired with the warm pita. Falafel was crispy an crunchy deliciousness served alongside a nice light lemon yogurt sauce. After that we ordered the chicken tagine with the beef keftas. And let me tell how Amazing they both were! The chicken tagine was a succulent marinated chicken quarter served over onions peppers and olives surrounded by crispy fries. It also came with a delicious wheat loaf baguette for dipping. The beef kefta was served with a roasted plum tomatoe, a hill of rice and a pepperoncini.

I was really looking forward to trying this restaurant because I enjoy other Italian chains. Our server was polite even though he couldn't answer some menu questions and he had to ask someone else. What it really comes down to was the food.\\n1. Freebie bread and oil - bread was soft but  crisp on the outside, bland though. The olive oil was fine the spices were salty. Wasn't tasty so we just ate the bread by itself. \\n2. Soup and salad - I ordered the minestrone soup and my husband ordered a salad with Italian dressing. The salad looked like someone threw some oiled leaves on a plate, shredded carrots and one half cheery Tomato, pathetic. I love a good soup and I like the minestrone soups from comparable chain restaurants like olive garden and Johnny Carinos so I was expecting something hearty and tasty. Well it ended up being a cabbage soup with a bean in it. It wasn't fresh,  it tasted old. \\n3. Entrees - we ordered the chicken parmesean and the new baked Ravioli \\"al forno\\" sounds fancy right?  Wrong. This is where it gets interesting. My \\"al forno\\" dish (oven baked) was as small round bowl with 8 breaded raviolis with tomato sauce and melted cheese on top.  Small but willing to try. The raviolis were hard and chewy on the outside and soft on the inside. The taste wasn't  bad but because the edges were overdone and maybe stale to begin with, it wasn't a pleasurable texture in my mouth. I asked the server if I can get a fresh one because this one didn't taste right and he said sure and went back to the kitchen. He came back and said unfortunately this is how it comes. Really? I don't think anyone could get through half of those raviolis. He gave me a menu and asked if I wanted something else, sure. I wanted something vegetarian and they don't have a lot to choose from unlike other restaurants. So I ordered spaghetti. He asked that's it?  Yeah it was just going to be pasta with Tomato sauce. Lame. I asked do they make baked pastas with veggies and cheese or something? He looked confused and said he would ask. He said they could melt some cheese on top if I wanted. Fine. At that point I knew I wasn't going to get any good food. So I need up paying  $12.50 for spaghetti. Ridiculous. \\nOK the chicken parm, easy classic American Italian dish right?  And at $18 a plate you'd expect and nice size portion. Well, it was very thin small arguably medium peices of chicken with a side of Italian garlic mashed potatoes. The potatoes were cold and tasted like onions weirdly. It looked like a scoop that came off the cafeteria line.   We didn't bother with dessert. Based off the rest of the food that night, it wasn't  worth it. Instead we drove to Amy's ice cream afterward and had a much better experience there. \\nI don't mind paying for good food but this was not.

Then at the end of the meal, the waitress started clearing everything and picked up my sake and spilt it all over me, the table etc. and then just walked away.  It was all over my lap and caused a big sticky mess.  I couldn't even find her again to ask for another napkin or anything.  This just seemed unacceptable to me for a $200+ tab.  I was also surprised that they factored in the tip on a table of 5.  That's probably their policy but didn't seem like that big of a group to do that too.

So he walked over by the bar where the manager went and asked why we couldn't sit over in that open section. He told my husband that he couldn't allow more than 150-200 people at a time or his kitchen would \\"crash\\".

Maybe they bring in their water from New York to give the bagels that authentic flavor?  Beats me, but I'm glad of whatever their secret is.  And did I mention the baked goods?  Cookies as big as your head I tell you!  Cannolis the size of small baseball bats and the traditional black and white cookie of New York deli legend.  \\n\\nAlmost always I get breakfast regardless of the hour of the day.  Their omelettes are great - the fajita one with chicken, peppers, onions and cheese, the veggie with broccoli, mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes and spinach... scrumptious.  And the portions are \\"generous\\" to put it lightly.  In addition to the entree, you get your choice of bagel flavor (there are many types to choose from - cinammon raisin's a winner), cream cheese flavor, and hash browns, grits or fruit for side.  It's easy to make two meals out of one here.  Everything has always come out hot and fresh and the servers are very friendly.\\n\\nSince I'm not a \\"New York bagel snob\\" like some of the Yelpers here - sorry, but I've never experienced the Nirvana that is H&H Bagels.

If you are not on a diet like me I recommend the wings, hands down, they are the bomb.com. The fries are good too. Because of my diet, I chose the grilled shrimp with a baked potato, and corn. The salad did not sound appetizing, with my current restrictions. I loved the shrimp and the corn. They seasoned the shrimp perfectly. The corn was sweet, and gone quickly. My baked potato was just a little dry, but still tasty. I tried the Jack Daniels Honey Bee, and enjoyed that. We also had a few shots. My aunt had her birthday party here, and she definitely enjoyed herself. They gave her a section with a couch, in the back and 3 tables. She also had 2 trays of wings. I sat in a section close by because I did not want party gratuity added to my tab. It was really a good time. The DJAY really turned up for my Aunt. There was also a quick live performance. Our waitress really is the reason for the 3 stars instead of 4. The food and drinks are definitely a 4 out of 5. But the service is like a level 2. The waitress was swamped, and she was handling her tables pretty well, once you ordered something. But like always, it took about 15 minutes to get our waitress' attention. And it finally happened because I asked the ladies at the table next to me to have her come over. She did not consistently check on us, so it took a while for us to order our second round of drinks. And I got up to give her my check and be cashed out, because I did not want to wait. When she came back with the copy for me to sign, she gave me a pencil.   UM, no ma'am you will not be erasing my amount and putting your own.\\nI most definitely found my own ink pin. Not being funny, but that is very unprofessional.

Don't forget to add the bacon and grilled onions or try the Steak Burger and even better then that, the Steak Bites. Your choice of Garlic, Chili, or Spicy cheese fries, all topped with sea salt.  I didn't notice the Mac & Cheese as the other review noted, but he does make a Texas style Chili - no beans.  I think there was a menu change since the move.\\n\\nWe ordered the Cheeseburger with Garlic fries and a Chocolate Mlkshake.

I did not find Sriracha, chili sauce, or spices of any kind. Just soy sauce. Believe it or not fried rice is a $2 up charge. A basic soda and teriyaki beef bowl comes to $15. That's a pretty expensive bowl of rice. I did not see any other products in the fried rice aside from soy sauce. I guess they charge you to reheat rice in the skillet and add soy sauce. The Bento boxes look good maybe next time. But they are not a bargain either. The small amount of teriyaki beef was nothing exciting. There are several places in the city where you can get a much better deal. Very little bang for your buck.

This was made more irritating by the fact that one of our party's dishes was a full ten minutes later than the rest of us (even after the long delay) with no real explanation. \\n\\nOn the plus side - Every one's food was great.

It's sort of a cross between American greasy-spoon and Middle-Eastern lunch place. The woman working there was very friendly and welcoming.  She immediately offered me very acceptable coffee (much better than most greasy-spoons). I took one of the many empty tables, looked at the well-worn menu and ordered whole-wheat French Toast with bacon. When I asked for sugar-free syrup (I have blood sugar issues), she told me the only syrup was what was on the table and that she also had honey and jam.  The bacon was overcooked and somehow just not right. French Toast was OK, but actually tasted better than it looked, probably because it was *smothered* in butter, most of which I had to brush off. The cinnamon and raisins on top gave it a nice, almost middle-eastern flavor.  I didn't have to use much of the sweet, but not maple, syrup.

The gameli was a small, twisty, chewy pasta with deliciously spiced bits of pork sausage all strewn in and arugula to break up the oiliness. The whole wheat ravioli was stunning with swiss chard, capers and a delicate cheese filling.

Every time you add something, there's a charge.  The menu is about 95% pork, a couple dishes of chicken and a couple sides without meat.  If you are a vegetarian, you are severely limited to ordering sides like fried okra, jalapeno bites, potato chunks.  With all of that being said, the fried potato chunks were different and very good.  While it's customary to have cole slaw on the pulled pork sandwich, (which is an extra cost to get cole slaw) until you've tried the cole slaw and know you like their homemade slaw, get it on the side and add it later, if you can.  The brisket on Texas toast was good.  It came with marinaded pickles and onions on the side.  Probably to decorate the large pan and take away from the large space from the small sandwich, but I thoroughly enjoyed eating it.  The mac and cheese (a side) is good, too.  Overall, we were pleasantly surprised with the experience.  Some food was ok, some was good and some surprised us at how good it was.  It appears EVERYTHING is homemade.

Some of the sandwiches are like communism, great in theory, but not so tasty in execution. I had the MQ2, smoked salmon, gouda, honey mustard, tomato, cukes, carrots, onion & greens on a sesame torta -- sounds great, right? The honey mustard overpowered the taste portfolio and drowned the  yummy smoked salmon, and then the gouda's taste was too subtle and forgotten (RIP). Also too many shredded carrots made this hard to eat neatly (which isn't a complaint, but I like sandwiches because it is a delicate and balanced meal -- and this was all over the place). I tried my friend's tempeh sandwich and the taste was a little underwhelming for me. I love the idea of the new sandwiches, keeping everything fresh and local, but I guess I'm just not a fan of the palates they are after.

Clean, modern, and with dining options for everyone, I've never brought anyone here and had them leave disappointed.\\n\\nOnto the food. Get the veggie burger. Doesn't matter if you're a full-blown carnivore. Brace yourself for the most delicious veggie burger you've ever eaten. Made with beets, brown rice, and beans, it has the crumbly texture of ground beef and nicely picks up a charred flavor from the grill. Topped with sharp white cheddar, tangy mustard, pickles, and a light salad of spring mix, it sits on a delicious, homemade, buttered 'n toasted bun. Also check out the chopped salad with sliced apples, roasted or smoked turkey, bleu cheese, sliced apples, raw almonds, and a great vinaigrette.\\n\\nBrunch at Northstar is also outstanding, but be prepared to wait. Some of the best pancakes I've had, made with creamy ricotta cheese to give a light, fluffy texture, and served with sliced bananas and Ohio maple syrup. A massive breakfast burrito with a runny egg yolk mixed with flavorful sweet potato hash. Great coffee. A killer breakfast sandwich of a huge, house-made drop biscuit filled with local bacon or sausage, eggs, and cheese is the best deal for the house.\\n\\nLocal is a recurring theme and watch out for the seasonal drinks featuring local ingredients. Teas with local honey, amazing mulled cider with maple whipped cream, and a spicy hot chocolate with cinnamon added.\\n\\nNow, my qualms: The prices are a little outrageous. Really-- $6 for a scone and $4 for admittedly the best double-chocolate cookie you'll ever have? Most of the juices even run in the $5-6 per glass range... and they don't even have liquor in 'em! The place is also almost ALWAYS crowded-- good for business but it's a little tiring to constantly have to hunt for a seat. Finally, no wi-fi? Northstar has the perfect ambiance to make a great study or hangout spot with comfortable seating, a great patio, and piles of magazines to read... but no wireless and next-to no cell phone signal available to at least AT&T patrons.\\n\\nAll this said, though, Northstar is a fantastic place. Friendly servers, great food with an emphasis on local and organic cookin', creative twists on old classics, a seasonal menu, wonderful patio, and ample parking."},{"name":"Yuzu","address":"4130 SW 117th Ave, Ste H","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"Is this place even open?

Unfortunately, Noodle box has slowly progressed from a place I would seek out and recommend to others to a place that now needs improvement.  \\n\\nThe concept of Noodle Box hasn't changed, there are rice or noodle based stir fry options that you get to choose a meat (or meat alternative) and a spice level that can range from mild to incredibly hot (but still with flavour). There are still several options from King Pao to Spicy Peanut to Green Curry and more. Importantly, the dishes are still somewhat customizable/adaptable to be made gluten free or if you want extra meat or another addition such as to add an egg on top.\\n\\nHowever, what has negatively changed is the speed of service, cost and significant reduction of meat and veggies.  Noodle Box is a place where food is made to order. As a result, there is some wait time which is understandable. However, I would still hope an order would take less than 15 minutes to make.  My average wait time on my last 3 visits was closer to 20-25 min. Also, Noodle Box is now accepting orders made by phone.  Unfortunately, on the last 2 visits, these phone orders have received priority over the orders from people that are in the restaurant. One time it caused my order to take 25 minutes (even though I had my order in first) and in my last visit, while I was eating my meal in, I saw many people bumped to fulfill phone orders causing them significant wait times. One thing I found odd, in some cases some of the phone orders were made for times significantly in advance (i.e. pickup time of 6:35pm, but they order was on the counter waiting at 6:10pm).  Not only does having a food order made so far in advance give time for the food to get cold, but it caused increased wait times for people that were in the restaurant physically and ordered first.  \\n\\nWhen I wrote my first review on Noodle Box in 2012, the average cost of a box was $11-12.  Now, the price has increased by $1-2.  It's not too much of an increase, and normally I would not bring up such an item (as food costs can go up as time goes on); however, I have noticed the amount of veggie and meat included in the box has reduced significantly over the last 1.5-2 years.  As a result, the meals to live up to their name of being a noodle box, but really I think most people want a stir fry.  With this said, the boxes can be noodle heavy, but 85%+ of noodles seems to be a bit much (this is ever with asking for additional veggies. Additionally, on orders involving chicken, most boxes only seem to get 1/4-1/2 a breast.  If it is a \\"full breast\\" it is some of the smallest I have seen. To add to this, Noodle Box gives you the option of choosing free range chicken for $3 more.  To be honest, with the small size of chicken included, the additional cost is not justified.\\n\\nWith all this said, I will try Noodle box again to see if these items will change over time, but it most certainly will not be in the near future."},{"name":"Tasca Restaurant","address":"1612 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"Quite disappointing.

We ordered two more rounds of that drink and then ordered one of their other signature drinks.   All of the signature drinks were 5 dollars, while the Ciroc was 8.50.   When I received my bill, I was mischarged for the drinks. The waitress said I had 3 Cirocs, even though the Ciroc and Sweet Bee taste nothing alike.  I asked her to correct the bill. She left and came back and I handed her my debit card, thinking she made the correction.  She ran my card, came back and told me she didn't charge me for the last round of drinks, then I saw she never corrected my first bill and brought back a second bill. \\n\\nI asked to see the manager, who was a horribly unkept woman with a terrible attitude.  She did not help me and I told her that I refused to pay the second bill that was brought to me.  She then had my mother, husband, friend, and I outside with the waitress and the police.  The waitress was rude and so was the manager, especially when I asked her to correct the wing order my mom made. I was basically made to pay both tickets, even though it was wrong, or face going to jail.  \\n\\nThis was the worst customer service that I ever experienced in my life.

I rarely enter a restaurant that I haven't read or heard about, but a friend and I, being somewhat famished were driving on the way to another venue when out of the corner of our respective eyes, spied on a cute little edifice, cradled by leafy dark green baughs off on our left hand side.\\n\\nWith an accent aigu over the first e, the sign struck us as just a tad cheeky.  My friend was also somewhat put-off by the garishly pink, \\"Open\\" sign...  We bandied the idea of a blind try back and forth, and 3 streets later, we hung a \\"U\\" and gave it a go.\\n\\nThe drizzle left us undeterred as my friend traipsed out to ask the hostess whether there would be a wait.  Sparsely filled, it turned out that there wouldn't be any wait at all.  We made our way to a table tucked away in a corner, led by warm and courteous wait-staff.\\n\\nThe decor was dominated by mid-range hued woods, white table cloths and with wall decorations primarily comprised of dark woodworkings, suggestive of a southeast asian origin, given the type of thatching and design.  The blinds were dark bamboo rolls.  Interesting choices in decor -- prompting the two of us to posit whether the decor was meant to suggest a colonial vietnamese origin.  We haven't a clue... but it was definitely a point of discussion.\\n\\nThe wine list is small, efficient, and thoroughly Francophillic.  Love 'em or hate 'em, you have to respect consistency in cuisine.  We both tried French Onion soup, and I had a hanger steak and my friend had a tortellini dish in a red sauce.  We both agreed that the food was quite good.  We paired the foods with a glass of bourdeaux and a Beaujoulais respectively.\\n\\nI found my steak (I've been on a beef kick, lately) tender, zestily seasoned, but well balanced such that it did not mask the quality of the meat, nor the native flavour:  delicately translucent.

It was slightly sweet and fatty, carmelly  and artfully displayed.  The menu makes no mention of how exquisitely prepared the food will be, and is such an understatement to the joy that lives on your plate for only a short time to then be devoured but hopefully respected for its centuries of tradition.\\n\\nWe chose several dishes that were artfully plated with skill and love.   \\nSalmon sashimi, Negitoro, and a non-traditional called the Elvis Roll were brought to our table and then showered with oohs and ahhs before being carefully eaten so as not to upset the balance of good conversation and flirtation.

There was a line when we got there because the restaurant was not yet open and there are a lot of impatient, hungry tourists with small children who absolutely NEED expensive brunch at 10am on a Sunday. I had family visiting from out of town, which was the only reason I was there in the first place because, honestly, locals should know better than to have 10am Sunday brunch ANYWHERE and especially on Newbury St. But hey, gotta feed the 'rents. SO. There was a bit of a wait, first for the place to open, then for the slow-motion stampede of the crowd, then for our table, even though we did have a reservation. The staff was also not super-attentive, but hey, there were really busy, even I could see that. And when they did come around, they were nothing but polite, even to my goofy family. The food, such as it was, was pretty good. It's brunch, people, what do you want, right? Everything was tasty, hot, and well-prepared. The juice was fresh. There was plenty of coffee. The whole experience was overpriced, but that's only to be expected. Why, then, you must be asking yourself, did she give this place 5 stars? Three words for you, people. REAL. MAPLE. SYRUP. After a grueling, heartbreaking couple of years of passably good brunch food completely ruined by the absence of sweet, sweet tree sap--nay, made nigh uneatable by the blissfully ignorant liberal application of what turned out to be that crime against nature, fake syrup, the fat, sticky carafe of real maple heaven that was sitting on our table at Stephanie's was a revelation. As a Vermonter, I find fake syrup a moral assault as well as an epicurean one.

I so wanted to love it and give it five glowing stars, but I just can't do it.\\n\\nLet me just state that the food is five star.  The service and atmosphere are what knock the rating down to three.\\n\\nWe walk in on a Saturday night, and the place is packed.  Luckily we already had a reservation for our group of 7 at 8:45, so we're good to go... or not.  We arrive and the hostess informs us that it will be about 5-10 minutes before we can be seated.  Okay.  20 minutes later, we are still standing by the host stand waiting for our table.  The hostesses are a bit frazzled, explaining that the table they are waiting on is lingering much longer than anticipated.  We continue to wait, but our stomachs are growling and we're pretty frustrated.  30 minutes in, the hostess apologetically offers us complimentary glasses of champagne.  Much appreciated, but not ailing the hunger pangs.  Finally, 45 minutes after our scheduled reservation, we are seated at our table and informed that appetizers are on the house.  I do indeed appreciate that they acknowledge the slip-up and offer these, but we are still off to a sour start.\\n\\nOnce seated, I am able to really take in our surroundings without the cloud of frustration.  The interior is lovely with white table cloths, dim rustic lighting, and a generally clean and classy look.  The sounds of the Watershed, however, are not so satisfactory.  Voices really carry in the dining room, and it is difficult for us to hear the waiter as he shouts out the specials to our table.  We ask him to repeat himself on too many occasions to count.  On top of that, the background music does not match the beauty of the surroundings.  I hear a little Ke$ha, some Miley Cyrus, and a smorgasbord of poppy tunes.  Don't get me wrong - I love these jams when I'm belting them out in my car or hosting an apartment dance party, but they don't fit in this setting.\\n\\nOur server is very polite and attentive.  I can tell that he is taking special care considering the rocky start of our visit.  Water glasses are promptly replenished, menu questions are answered with knowledge and confidence, and he eagerly offers up the last salmon entree of the evening which I hastily snatched up.  I was on the fence between the salmon and sea scallops upon reviewing the menu, but that last chance offer of scarcity sealed the deal.\\n\\nWhich brings me to the restaurant's most redeeming quality of the evening: the food.  We order a Malbec and Pinot Grigio for the table, and both are quality.  Our free apps are pimento cheese toast and some sort of meatball dish.  I'm not a big meat and cheese gal, but the other members of our party gobble them up.  I snag the last salmon entree of the night, and boy was I glad that I did.  That fish is cooked to perfection and quite honestly one of the juiciest salmon filets I have ever tasted.  The kale succotash is savory and pairs so very well with the flaky fish.  Oh yeah.  This is one well done meal, and my taste buds are beyond pleased.\\n\\nDespite the initial hiccup and the less than ideal noise situation, I can't write off a return visit to Watershed.  Such a delicious meal cannot be forgotten.  And I am pretty intrigued by this whole wine tasting thing they've got going on ($20 for 20 tastings + light bites held on monthly on a Tuesday)."},{"name":"Leonardo's Pizzeria","address":"16505 SE 1st St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Friendly staff!!

I had heard good things about this place. I'm a KCBS certified BBQ judge so have some experience in BBQ.  Sadly they have decided to cater to the popular misconception that \\"fall-off-the-bone\\" meat is a desirable quality of ribs.  It's not.  These ribs are way overcooked.  The meat is bland, dry and mushy.  Mushy, dry rib meat means that you cooked it too long or you cooked it too long yesterday and re-heated it today. Or you boiled the ribs and then cooked them too long to ensure that they would \\"fall-off-the-bone\\".  Either way it's a fail. There was no smokiness to the meat either and the bark was bland.  The signature sauce was also bland.\\n\\nCame with a side wedge salad which consisted of iceberg lettuce with dressing, topped with onion rings and bacon.  Funny concept but, it was just conceptual.  It really didn't work in terms of flavor or textures. It was eye candy not mouth candy.  \\n\\nThe Mac-n-Cheese side would have been good if they threw it out and started over using better quality mac and better quality cheese and not cooked the mac into mushy submission (aldente please!) - then passed it under the broiler to get a toasty bubbly crunchy top.

Very disappointed with this restaurant. Love the location, how it's tucked away, and their outdoor patio. Waitress was a little snooty but we can deal with lack of customer service if the food is worth it, which it was not.  To be specific, there is no value for the product.  Very expensive (and ultra-small) avocado appetizer which was eaten in two bites. The LARGE salad was the size of a tall small cup (kind of like a larger than usual coffee cup).  I ordered the jumbo shrimp tempura dinner and jumbo they were not.  Jumbo is U21-25, which is 21 to 25 shrimp per pound. These were more like U41-50, very smal. The batter reminded me of pancake batter, very thick, and not light and airy as it should be. Served with asparagus, broccoli, and yam, there was one asparagus spear, one small chunk of broccoli, one small slice of carrot, as well as one okra, half a mushroom, and a Serrano pepper, which were not listed. Very few veggies, which I love, and thank God I didn't bite the Serrano pepper because I can't eat these.  Quite a surprising letdown as most sushi places serve a good amount of food on a tempura platter. My daughter and her friend shared a roll, which they said was good, but they could not order their roll with soy paper as they do not have it.

I thought it was bland and wouldn't recommend it. My husband got a BBQ bacon burger (he's not a seafood guy) and said it was pretty good and would give it a 4.5/5.

My mother in law got the crab cakes and I also ate some. It was really delicious with barely any filling. You get two crab cakes in the dish.

Vancouver has such a dearth of 24-hour eating establishments that I'm tempted to give Pho Extreme an extra star. However, their food is \\"extremely\\" average so I'm forced to stick with three. I went here with my parents and we all felt, based on the menu and nature of the restaurant, that we should stick with soups rather than ordering a noodle or rice dish. I ordered the steak pho, my dad ordered the steak and brisket pho, and my mom ordered the chicken pho. I always avoid pho ga, but my mom said it was pretty good. All of the soups contained a generous serving of protein, and this is great value when considering the $6.50 pricetag. The broth was forgettable, but pho is designed to be customized with various sauces and additions, so forgettable stock has never \\"broth\\"ered me. We also ordered the saladrolls to start, which are very reasonable at $4.50 for two rolls (four pieces).

Were originally from Hawaii and been stationed out in North Dakota so there really wasn't any fresh fish there. The sushi definitely made us want to come here more. We had the spicy ahi roll and it was as good as you it can get. It was delicious and was good for the price we paid. We also got track and shrimp teppan, and that's were things went south. The shrimp and steak were really good but everything else was so bland and unflavorful. The price imo was for quantity and definitely not quality. Overall if I'd ever go back here I'd stick to just getting a spicy ahi roll, idk how the other sushis taste but the kobe teppan was definitely a huge let down. Esp with us being Asian, I could've easily made the dishes with more flavor. We spent the money so we took the rest back to the hotel as left overs and hopefully we can make something of it for breakfast. \\n\\nOur server was really nice too, he was attentive and easy to talk with.

My mom ordered her steak Medium Well which came out more on the rare side, her mashed potatoes were cold and it was clear the green beans were frozen and not fresh. I ordered the Lobster Rizotto which only came with one small piece of Lobster that had a rubbery texture as if it was made with fake meat like you would find in a store bought seafood salad...It also came with a side of Haddock that while cooked well didn't have much taste..the whole dish was bland..I usually give new places the benefit of the doubt but for the price I don't think we'll be back.

To put it simply, I was very impressed by what I experienced.

We made reservations days ago just in case it got too busy for them on Chinese New Year; it really wasn't necessary because, surprisingly, they were not that busy at 11:30 am. The waitress was very attentive, and very patient with us when we were indecisive with our order. The waitress made some good recommendations, which I thought was helpful. We ordered 6 dishes, which included an eggplant with salty fish hot pot, a sweet and sour pork chop, stir-fried gai-lan with diced chicken, a fried fish batter with a savoury corn sauce, and a stir fried bean with chicken. And of course, we had lots of steam white rice to compliment this feast. Parking is quite limited in this parking lot. If you live in the neighborhood, consider yourself lucky.

The al pastor also had pieces of pineapple in it from its marinade, and I always like that.  I do think that the tacos were a bit expensive. . .but that's just because I'm extremely frugal (cheap).

But they are so ostentatious; goat cheese on this, pancetta on that, with sundried tomatoes. How about some good ol fashioned baked ziti or Veal Parmigian. How about instead of lobster ravioli just plain old cheese ravioli. And does it have to be pomodoro sauce and tomato cream sauce. What ever happened to good old tomato sauce?\\nFunny side note: When the waiter (Thomas, who did a fine job) poured out the olive oil and seasoning my mother got a confused look on her face and asked what that was for. You see back home, restaurants don't do that. So I explained it to her she tried it squinched up her face and asked for butter when the waiter returned. Haha. Oh and what's up with that bread.

With the exception of Mad Mex, which has the manufactured \\"one-of-a-kind charm\\" of a Volkswagen Beetle, the only other option OSU students have for a meal within walking distance that bares some semblance to Mexican food is Taco Bell. Needless to say, we can close the book on that issue right there.\\n\\nI'm a firm believer that if you've seen one authentic Mexican restaurant in Columbus, you've seen them all. In that regard, the menu at Cazuela's is nothing out of the ordinary-  a predictable selection of fajitas, taco platters, burritos, enchiladas, and so on and so forth. Clearly, this is no attempt to reinvent the wheel. They keep things simple here at Cazuela's, and thankfully they do a darn good job at it.\\n\\nThe chicken strips in the fajitas I ordered on my first visit were at that perfect halfway point between adequately cooked and burnt to a crisp- just what the doctor ordered. The tortillas were soft and free of crispy, stale edges, which happens a lot more than one would expect at places like this in Columbus. I sampled the beef enchilada that my friend adjacent to me ordered and was equally impressed- gooey, cheesy, melted goodness that made Mad Mex and El Vaquero look foolish for ever trying. One thing that needed work however, was the salsa, which was runny and downright disappointing compared to the otherwise delicious spread of food in front of us. \\n\\nWhat really makes Cazuela's shine is its outdoor patio. Nestled under the shade that's  generously provided by the canopy of trees lining Northwood Avenue, this small wooden enclosure bustles with energy provided by a friendly waitstaff and a dinky set of speakers that blasts hokey mariachi music for patrons to tap their feet to while they anticipate the arrival of their entrees. Even if you're just in the mood for a couple Coronas or a stiff margarita at happy hour to start the evening out with, the patio is a perfect place to chat with friends and watch the busy foot traffic of High St. pass by.\\n\\nIf you're too late to snag a table outside, however, it might not even be worth it to stick around and eat in the indoor dining area. Fashioned from what used to be the living room of the house that Cazuela's now inhabits, the dining room feels more like the locale of a bad softcore porn movie than a Mexican restaurant. The walls are painted an obnoxious bright orange color and are dominated by enormous mirrors, which is likely to freak out anyone with more than just a couple of drinks in their system. If they'd tone it down a notch and ditch the Studio 54 mirrors, the place might feel a little more cozy and inviting. Instead, it manages to give off the vibes of a tanning bed dialed up to eleven.\\n\\nRegardless, the addition to Cazuela's to the otherwise spotty dining scene of the North Campus area is greatly appreciated and worth checking out. Whether you're in search of a Mexican feast of epic proportions or just a few drinks in a colorful and festive atmosphere, Cazuela's is the place to be."},{"name":"The Haven","address":"2 Perkins St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"4.5","text":"Having (almost) breached a one-year window from hosting an Elite event at this place that I LOVE, and a series of subsequent meals/drinking sessions, it's officially time.\\n\\nJason and Chef Wax have something real.

Service and coffee are really uneven, most of the times, I don't feel welcome being served by inexperienced teenagers (I can't blame them, they just need a little guidance, it's more the management's responsibility). \\n Half the time, I don't receive what I ordered (last time I got a decaf americano instead of a regular coffee), and I wonder how they figure out the prices, because each time, it seems to be more expensive than what is marked on the board.  $5.60 for an iced chai (regular milk), I expected a big size (there are two), and when I saw my drink, if it is their biggest size, it does not deserve more than $5.00.  Same with my regular coffee, I order a small, regular, that should cost no more than $2.00 including tax according to the board, and I get charged $2.60 for in the end getting a small decaf.\\nI still go there only for the patio from time to time, always hoping that they'll have improved or that I' ll be lucky that day, but really, when the weather is not cooperating, I' d much rather go to Vic's, located almost in front of bittersweet, where the staff is always friendly and you get what you ordered at the expected price."},{"name":"Market Street Cafe","address":"701 Front St","city":"Celebration","stars":"3","text":"LOVE IT!\\n\\nI live in Celebration and frequent this place fairly often.

The two of us ordered a whole bunch of items to try and I still ended up taking home enough to satiate another person or so.\\n\\nFirst off, one of their Cheese Pupusas $2.00 (Homemade tortillas filled with cheese) because of Julia F.'s lauding.  Simple looking, yet tasty.  It came with a tomato sauce of sorts that wasn't spicy.\\n\\nWe eyed both the Chicken Tamale $2.00 and the Chicken Chuchitos $2.00, considering one of each, but were informed that they are pretty much the same, so we went with the Chuchito.  I found the cornmeal and chicken rather bland, so after just a taste, I turned my attention elsewhere.\\n\\nTheir tacos are $2 apiece.  I went with a Lengua Taco, which arrived two corn tortillas high, topped with an acceptable portion of cubed tender beef tongue.  Simple, yet good.\\n\\nThe star of the meal, however was the Grilled Shrimps $13.95 (Shrimps with rice, beans, french fries and salad), which we ordered due to the photo on the menu showing that it came with broccoli.  Yes, we were in dire need of vegetables to round out our meal, and this was our way of getting it.  And did we get it - this entree was impressive in that it arrived on not one, but two, or perhaps 3 plates (assuming that the foil wrapped twin fat tortillas came with this dish).  The shrimp themselves numbered 4, but they were huge buggers, each split in two so they took up quite a bit of space as they encircled the nice mound of broccoli, cauliflower, and carrot that were either pan fried or oven roasted, but either way, they retained both a nice crisp and color, and were a joy to eat.  Yes, I am capable of finding veggies joyful.\\n\\nThe mentioned accompaniments were found on an entirely separate plate - rice, beans, salad and french fries.  Eat the fries quick, as they lose their crispness due to their association with their moister neighbors.  The salad was crisp.  Beans are beans.  The rice was not clumpy, but included a smattering of vegetables (ie. peas, corn, carrots).  This would be a filling and well rounded meal for a very hungry eater.  4 stars on this alone!\\n\\nThe Chicken Wings $5.95/$9.95 (Chicken wings with rice, salad and french fries) came in two sizes, so we ordered the small, and at 5 (I think) wing pieces with a plateful of accompaniments, it would have filled either one of our appetites just fine on its lonesome.  The chicken was tender inside and crisp outside, and not particularly oily.\\n\\nThe finish our meal, although we actually started with it, we ordered the one dessert listed on their menu - speaking of which, I loved that it was loaded with photos with every menu item - a cake which came $3.50 for a half portion and $6 for a double.  I don't remember the name, but it was listed at the top of the back page, above the many liquid options which we had refrained from on this visit.\\n\\nThe cake was lightly sweet and a little pound cakey, but nothing particularly special.  If you have a sweet tooth, it might do the job - or one of the juices might as well - but I wouldn't yearn for this.\\n\\nService was acceptable, although each server seemed to have their own tables, and never the twain shall meet.  Food took a while, however, with the cake arriving posthaste, while the next course took 20 minutes, which seemed an eternity to my poor hungry dining companion.  And 6 minutes more till the lastly ordered chicken wings flew in.\\n\\nTo tote away the leftover, I requested take-out containers which came in the form of styrofoam clamshells and a plastic bag.\\n\\nA unisex singleton bathroom is available to the right of the counter located at the innermost side of the restaurant.  Two flat screens adorn parallel walls.  And the dining area is of a good size.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself was bright and cheery, and rather casual.  More a place for the family or a simple outing with friends rather than for a date or something else where you want to make an impact based on the atmosphere.\\n\\nThe walk from Maverick station was quite reasonable - perhaps a comfortable 8 minute walk or so.  Finding the restaurant was a little more difficult as we only located it because for some unknown reason I looked back after we had crossed Saratoga Street - and there it was!

We let the server know and he was incredibly apologetic and handled the situation well. \\n\\nMoments later we were harassed by a homeless man who had managed to walk right past the dynamic duo at the host stand and proceeded to steal $5 from one of my friends. He was escorted out before we could get it back. Our server was as shocked as we were and he notified the manager. No one from management ever came over to our table. The male host that evening came to refill our waters later in the meal and I mentioned it to him which prompted an awkward and drawn out monologue that resulted in nothing.\\n\\nMy friend ordered soup, the server brought out the wrong soup and gave it to my other friend for free.

Coming from the SF Bay area (and the sublime Sushi Sho in particular) I did not expect to find sushi this good for such a reasonable price on my first try in Austin. I ate at the bar.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n-The fish was very fresh and generally of high quality. That's the bare minimum standard for an acceptable sushi joint, if you ask me. Even the uni was good, which is always a gamble when it's your first time at a new place =) Unfortunately I forgot to try the saba.\\n-The prices are very reasonable, unless you want the super-premium fatty tunas, which ranged as high tonight as $15 for a single piece of bluefin oo-toro (and I'm sure that's just the reality of getting good fish in central Texas). Fancy-pants \\"Texas fusion\\" rolls looked a bit overpriced to me too, but I don't generally go in for that stuff anyway. All told, I got 10 pieces of nigiri, 2 rolls, a hand roll, miso soup, salad, tea, and a glass of shochu for $53 plus tip.\\n-The California roll that came with the standard sushi assortment was superb. I don't usually get these, but there's a reason they are so popular: it's a great combination of flavors and textures that pretty much anyone can enjoy. The crispy oyster nigiri that came with the assortment was also a delicious surprise.\\n-Drink service was very attentive. My tea and water were always full.\\n-If you want, you can get in and out very quickly. I think I spent under 45 minutes in the restaurant.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n-The sushi rice is merely adequate.\\n-They have many chefs of varying levels of experience. Mine was generally pretty competent--no great shakes, but he didn't ruin anything. He plated my assortment in a somewhat haphazard order--the unagi should not be the first piece of nigiri in front of me, with the maguro and sake hiding behind it!\\n-They spread some kind of sauce or glaze on every single piece of nigiri, as far as I can tell. They put what appeared to be ponzu sauce on my uni, even, which was disheartening.\\n-They wouldn't make my favorite vegi roll (ume-shiso + takuan + bonito shavings), explaining they only work from a set menu of rolls. This is kind of a silly restriction when the chefs are making each roll by hand as you order it! On the plus side, the ume-shiso roll (with cucumber) was very good.\\n-The tamago was absolutely terrible. Mine was sickly sweet and mushy. Ick. Easily avoided by not ordering it ever again, but oh how I will miss Aki-san's sublime tamago from Sushi Sho =(\\n-It's a very busy atmosphere. This is NOT a place to go to slowly savor a relaxing 2-hour meal. I guess I'll have to get to Uchi at some point ;-)\\n\\nAll in all, I would definitely go back.

I freaking LOVE big kahunas and I am SO indescribably happy this place popped up so close to my home. There is nothing else like it in the area and the poke bowls are AMAZING. The food is so fresh and delicious- seriously check their Instagram to see how fresh their fish is. Not only is the taste and quality of the food perfect, the service and ambiance is amazing. The decor and aesthetic is perfectly on theme without being over the top and obnoxious and the restaurant is clean and bright. The owner has been there every time I've visited and you can tell he has poured his heart and soul into this business. He is always attentive and helpful and checking in with customers and helping his employees. The staff is also amazing. I feel like I really need to call this out because it's so common to visit quick service restaurants and coffee shops that are hip and trendy and staffed by high school and college students who don't even to pretend to like their jobs. I've gotten used to sub par service at most places I go where the employees are apathetic and unhelpful. However, the employees at big kahuna's are bright, friendly, quick and completely on top of their game. They also make great recommendations when you're ordering. I am so impressed at how this entire business is run. Everything about Big Kahunas exceeded my expectations, my only concern is that now I'm addicted snd constantly craving poke and dole whip.

I didn't have any beer, so I can't speak to that, but several of my friends really liked the Cambridge Amber.   That was about the only positive.    We had a party of 9, so I can understand the service being slow (although the fact that we had to ask 3 times just to get glasses for the whole table was weird) but the problems really started when we ordered food.   One of my friends wanted the Southwestern Chicken burger, but they told her that they were out, and she asked if she could have the Southwestern Burger with a beef patty instead (since they indicated they were just out of chicken patties).   It took quite awhile to communicate this to our waitress, who kept insisting to my friend that she should get the \\"blackened chicken sandwich\\" and they could even scrape the black stuff off...um, it was the \\"Southwestern\\" in \\"Southwestern Burger\\" that she wanted, not the chicken, thank you very much.   You'd think the fact that she was trying to get the burger with a BEEF patty would make this clear, but no.    The waitress was not the brightest bulb.   When they brought out our food, they just brought my friend a plain burger.    We told the guy who had brought out the food that this wasn't what she had ordered and he seemed very confused, brought out another women who we explained the situation to AGAIN, and finally our waitress emerged with a little cup of BBQ sauce.   When my friend politely said \\"Is this all there is to the 'Southwestern Burger'?\\" the waitress rolled her eyes and replied \\"yes\\" in an exasperated tone.   The saddest part of this story is that because of our large group size, we were forced to leave a mandatory 18% tip (probably the exact same reason that we got such crappy service).   Still, I've dined in large groups in plenty of other establishments and I don't think I've ever had service this bad.   We gave her the evil eye for the rest of the night, but I would rather have had our $25 of tip back.   As for the rest of the food, it seemed to be hit or miss.   I heard several people complain about how their burgers were cooked, although that may have been due to some confusion amongst my friends, two of whom accidentally switched burger orders.   I had a \\"white pizza\\" without any white sauce, which was bland but not inedible.

S&M offers the absolute freshest and most consistent shabu ingredients I've ever had in the Boston shabu scene. In addition to the fresh ingredients, I'd like to point that they offer a pho broth & ramen noodles (side) that no other shabu restaurant offers. You can't go wrong with any of the meats, my go-to is the \\"crunchy\\" tontoro (fatty pork cheek) & the perfectly marbled short rib and prime rib.\\n\\nI might get called out on this but I'll go out on a limb here and claim that the wings here are the best in all of Boston. There I said it. Go for their soy chicken wings. That's all I wrote. \\n\\nThe ramen is A-OK, it's not bad but not exceptionally great either. The noodles don't have that preferable bouncy texture and the broth is passable. I will however give creds to the toppings - the slices of pork are fatty, tender, & tasty and the egg is runny as it should be. \\n\\nThe only caveat with S&M is the price, it's not cheap given it's pricey location next to the mall & Kendall Sq.

The restaurant was not crowded, so I was able to order right away. The burger was great. Cooked to order and fresh. It was meaty, but not beefy meaty, if that makes sense at all. It is the best version of a plant based burger that I've had and can be a great substitution every once in a while.  The price was a little steep at $12.00, but it was worth it for the experience.

We ordered a soup duo with the onion soup and the new england clam chowder. I had the chowder and it was delicious. They had generous amount of clam in the soup. For main entree, I had the veal bolognese, which was AMAZING! Bolognese is such a classic dish but most place can't do it very well, mostly too dry. This place the made is perfect. It was the perfect meat to sauce portion and it was moist. The flavor was rice and good. I could not stop eating. I think I would go back just for this dish.\\n\\nPrice: We spent about $65 for the dinner with two glass of wine. It was worth the price for the quality of food.\\n\\nOverall, it's a great place for a casual weekday dinner with quality food.

Which was about 12 years ago.. Anyway went here while I was in town visiting family and had a taste the sushi. So naturally I go to the spot that I know I can anyways get great sushi! And well it was mediocre at best.  They drenched one of my rolls with way too much sauce that I had to scrap some off. I wish I had taken a picture of it.  Once I scrapped of the excess sauce it was ok.  I also ordered the shrimp tempura and they don't even take time to de-vein them, when u asked about it the waitress said they don't do that on the tempura dish... Maybe they were just having an of night so knows, but it deterred me for sure.. At least for now.. Smh \\n\\nWhat I do know is that I will not be running back here for sushi anytime soon. And the ambiance hasn't really changed.. They may have  re-upholstered the furniture but it still looks like it needs to be updated.  Needless to say I was a bit disappointed. So sad b/c it use to be a great sushi spot. I must say they still had a bit of a crowd, but wondering if that's b/c ppl don't know another sushi spot to go to our they just like and are loyal to Ru Sans..Things that make you go hhmmmm...\\nAs for me I know other spots so that's where I'll be going when I'm back in town. I'll give them a min and maybe try back another time during the day and not at night when they may not be as tired,  then maybe the food will be better prepared..

It is located right in the library, making it perfect for a midday work break. They serve a wide variety of sandwiches and coffee drinks that are very serviceable. But the most astounding thing is that their avocado toast is only $5. I think this underscores my favorite part of it - they are trying to be accessible by offering price points that most library users can afford rather than just trying to make a buck. They could have well charged a lot more for some of their offerings (like the Map Room Cafe on the other side of the library).

The beef was a bright red and had great marbling and the pork belly was nice and fatty. Those two meats are my favorite since I don't like lamb. The vegetables are also extremely fresh. They're always crisp and green, they're never wilted. The soup flavors everything nicely, especially the spicy soup, but if the soup doesn't flavor the food enough, they also have a sauce bar. The sauce bar has classic sauces like Chinese BBQ sauce and sesame paste. I really like mixing sesame oil into my sauces also. Not only do they have meats and vegetables, they also have seafood, tofu, noodles, and a bunch of other things.\\n\\nThis place is extremely fun and is a good place to eat if you have a group of people.

As a result, the speed of service is a very important factor. Because we had a group of 9, a reservation was made in advance.  They even called bright and early the same morning to confirm the reservation. Unfortunately when we arrived we had to wait and I am not sure why.  \\n\\nWe were seated and introduced to our server who was very friendly. She advised our group that the assistant servers were in training and I appreciated being given that information before anyone's patience ran thin.  We were waiting on one person before we ordered, so we requested the servers come back a little while after we received our drink orders. The drink orders arrived quickly but they were slow on getting us our bread.  Our final party did arrive and the servers were slow getting back to the table to take our orders.  We placed our orders and it felt as if it took some time for our orders to come out. And when they did not everyone received their dish at the same time.  Overall the food was good. I ordered the Chicken Francese which is one of my favorite Italian dishes to order and I haven't had it as good here in Atlanta as I have had in NY. And that opinion still stands. The portion size was great, three pieces of chicken with the regular portion and two with the lighter version, which I had. The sauce is the winner of the dish and it was too light. I am wondering if it was because of it being a lighter version which takes away from the awesomeness of this dish. The regular version has potatoes and the light version came with pasta. Potatoes are strange as a side for an Italian dish.......maybe it's just me.  I was satisfied since I was hungry but I was not blown over by the dish. Since it was my birthday, I got a birthday desert which were some cookies and a strawberry with a candle in. That was just eh.... I mean who would not rather have some cake!\\n\\nOverall, all though the service was slower than what I would like for lunch, everyone was very friendly and responded to requests which can add up with a group.

My beer brat was tasty but served on a way-too-large roll which I had to remove half of to even fully taste the meat, saurkraut and mustard - which are not subtle flavors to begin with. Friends both got salads which were good but fairly small, so the side order of delicious Belgian style fries hit the spot. Best thing about our visit? Running into an old college friend from Santa Cruz who I hadn't seen in many years, and who joined us for dinner. Live music that night was mediocre but could add nice dimension to an evening or afternoon of sipping.

She engaged in conversations with us and still maintained a proffesional attitude. I was so impressed with the service and the food was typical cactus club food reasonable price and cheap.

I ask for a receipt, she prints out the wrong one, I ask for MY receipt, I get it, the receipt doesn't make much sense to me as the bottom half is showing US currency (I don't know what buttons she pressed?) but she is saying she ran my cash of $15 through as $16.50, so I owe her a dollar. Really? You are going to have this arguement with me over a dollar because YOU screwed up? Sure, I walk back to the table to get my wallet to bring her back a dollar, and then she gets passive agressive with me and doesn't want it. Great.

My friend and I organized a joint birthday party for ourselves this year, and we decided to end our night with some dancing at the 90's night at Library Square. We had even spent our afternoon at thrift shops searching for the most hideous (yet hilarious) 90's outfits so that we could arrive in theme. Imagine our disappointment when we arrive at 10pm to find a line-up out the door filled with 19-20 year olds, all dressed in the same short, black mini-dress.\\n\\nLet's be clear: this place is a meat market. While in line, there were girls in front of us who were trying to take pictures of themselves making out with each other so they could post it on facebook. It's THAT type of place. I'll admit, we were stupid enough to stand in line for an hour waiting to get in. Over the course of that time, our friends gradually dropped out one-by-one -this place was just too lame for them.\\n\\nI'll admit: we left before we got in, but from what we could see, the inside was just packed with 19 year old bumpin' and grindin' with each other. A lot of the music they were playing wasn't even from the 90's! From past times being there, I can also warn others that the drinks are very over priced. I know it's not really a \\"club\\" drink, but a pint of Guinness is over $8, as a point of reference.\\n\\nOverall, it's a Donnelly Group establishment, so I shouldn't have been surprised. The Donnelly Group is really good at serving up a pre-packaged idea of \\"fun\\" to stereotypical vapid suburbanites.

I find that a lot of their styles are quite suitable for the younger generation living in condos.  The store basically sells any piece of furniture that you may need in a home ranging from couches, islands, stove, ovens, home decor, candles, picture frames, lighting and the list goes on endlessly.  Their prices are one of the cheapest considering their quality is not bad.  The reason why their stuff is cheaper than others because you literally have to do everything yourself: from picking up the pieces whether its a bed or shoe rack at the warehouse downstairs to assembling it yourself.  They do deliver if you are unable to bring them home yourself and it'll cost you 75$.  If you are too lazy to assemble the parts yourself, you can also book someone to go to your house to do it for another fee.  However the downside is they don't usually deliver and assemble at the same day unless you really plan ahead and timing is not an issue.  Make sure to check out their clearance section (seasonal items, slightly damaged or display pieces) at the lower left corner of downstairs.  Their cafeteria is OK selling hot dogs, frozen yogurt, pizzas, cinnamon buns at a low price and I usually just grab a hot dog combo when i'm there to browse.  Right beside the downstairs cafeteria is the snacks and food items from Sweden which is pretty neat. They also have a \\"nicer\\" cafeteria upstairs as well selling pastas and meatballs etc.  Large parking lot available."},{"name":"Diesel Cafe","address":"257 Elm St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Good coffee, I especially love the Vietnamese coffee with sweetened condensed milk, so delicious, no need for cream or sugar.

For the ambiance and space i think the prices were very fair. They seem to not charge you for coffee, so it's pretty much included in the meals. I really enjoyed the shakshuka which came with a delicious roti on the side. The shakshuka was absolutely delicious. There was this very big cinnamon stick (it was larger than any regular cinammon stick ive ever seen) in my dish so i pulled it out (bit it...bc...taste test) and put it on my other plate and finished my delicious meal.

I told her that really wasnt necessary because i still really enjoyed the meal and it wasnt like it was just a random serving spoon that ended up in the dish, it was actually something that was part of it.

The food is ok and the prices are not bad but they have some very dishonest people who work there.  We went through the drive thru Saturday night at approximately 12:30 am.  We paid with a credit card but we needed change for a five so we gave the guy the credit card and the five and asked for change.  He said he didn't know how to do it so he gave it to his manager, which I witnessed.  I got the drink and the food and pulled off.  I realized after pulling out I forgot the change.  The doors are locked at this time so I called.  The manager had no idea what I was talking about and asked the other manager about it who also I had no idea what I was talking.  Mind you I just left there and actually saw with my own eyes this woman taking the five.  No help Saturday so Sunday I went in and another manager pretty much said I don't know what to tell you even after I gave him the description of the two workers and pointed out that they could just look at the videos surrounding the drive thru.  Still nothing.  I realize that I drove off but for someone to blantingly lie is just so wrong.  Whoever owns this restaurant should know that some of the people working there are thief's.

He is always tinkering with creating new drinks when the bar isn't as packed (as you can see if you spy on him when he isn't busy), using infused liquors and ingredients that you might not think go together.  Don't be scared off by the drinks.  Take a leap or faith, you won't regret it.  You can tell he really has a passion for what he does.  I ordered one of his creations and absolutely loved it.  When he came back, I said \\"I loved this, got anything similar?\\"  After asking me a few questions about my drink likes and dislikes, he went behind the bar and did his magic.  The result?  An even BETTER drink than what was on the menu.  Ran is amazing.  He also has a personally created drink that has been entered into a national competition.  He gave us a sample... it should absolutely win!

Well, the moment finally came, we were driving by and it didn't look too crazy, so in we went.\\n\\nTo summarize...\\n\\nMenu: a bizarre mix of offerings, ranging from the obvious (their signature burgers) to the seemingly out of place (chicken nuggets, wraps, Mexi-style this, Western-style that. Huh? I thought the concept was to be reminiscent of a Southern-style cook out?)\\n\\nService: a handful of young adults who seemed pretty checked out. Whatever system  they are running seems disorganized and random. The number of people taking orders is woefully inadequate for how busy the place is. Ditto the number of tables.\\n\\nFood: Husband ordered a combo plate: 1/4 pound burger with hush puppies and corn dog. Burger was small, indifferent and featureless, not even on the same taste planet as the glorious Five Guys. Even Zesto's Chubby Decker is far better prepared and tastier. Hush puppies were greasy, flavourless and hard. Unforgiveable given that Cook-Out is a Southern chain. Corn dog was identical to the frozen ones you get at the supermarket ie. small and nasty tasting.\\n\\nDrinks: I got a Chocolate Cobbler milkshake and my husband got a coke float. Now, to be fair, they were both excellent. Definitely the high point. Perhaps Cook-Out should rebrand as a soda fountain and just do drinks :)\\n\\nCost: Shockingly cheap, but we got exactly what we paid for: below average, greasy, dull fast food that does not deserve a single one of the accolades heaped upon it.

A bowl of that is a meal.  Can't go wrong with a margarita or the fajitas.

I used to adore their kinoko cream croquette and lamb chops, but sadly, they discontinued these items. I'm also always amazed how the hostess/waitress lady handles all the customers singlehandedly with ease and grace.

I've also ordered a handful of their appetizers. Their service is friendly, their food is fresh their prices are a tad bit more steep than I've encountered with other Japanese restaurants who seem to either serve more bang for their buck, or more exotic sushi/dinner. \\nI ordered spicy tuna rolls and sashimi on a few occasions. The rolls were a bit on the small side and the rice wasn't perfectly cooked. Pieces kept falling off left and right making a run for it, not sticking to the seaweed wrap long enough to clear landing. I've had better quality tuna with less fat and more flavor. \\nWhile I wouldn't discourage anyone from dining here, it's not the place for legit sushi enthusiasts. If you'd like a nice quite meal at a hole in the wall restaurant with speedy service, then this is your spot.

Every time my parents would visit me at college, I always recommended eating at Stephanie's. The Cobb Salad is always fresh and loaded with grilled chicken, avocado, fresh-off-the-cob corn, and bacon. Plus, I'm a sucker for a tortilla shell. I'd recommend ordering the dressing on the side so that the shell doesn't come out soggy, since the salad is always done first and they deliver all the meals for your party at once. \\n\\nAlso worth trying are the tower of onion rings (enough for the entire table), the baked spinach and artichoke dip and their mac&cheese (but if I remember correctly, they only serve the mac&cheese for dinner). \\n\\nThe cocktails are always delicious, but low on alcohol. Personally, if I order something heavy like a chocolate martini, I don't want to have to drink 3 before I feel a buzz going. Still delicious though! \\n\\nPlus, Stephanie's on Newbury has amazing outside seating that is perfect for people-watching. (Hey, everyone loves that).

So the nice girl working at the counter politely hands me my order and I walk up to the door to leave and this jerk is on the outside still applying this sign to the glass I stand there waiting (it's a glass door and he sees me but ignores me) and starts carefully patting down the sign taking his time because well, he's an a-hole. Then after finally opening the door he walks into me and deliberately tries to body check me and very loudly and sarcastically snaps \\"Oooh soooorrryy!\\" He is a scumbag and should kill himself instead of bringing his over the hill punk attitude to work. Wings might be good, haven't tried them yet I'm so appalled by the moron managing the joint, girl at the counter was great, but f that piece of dirt who calls himself the manager.

The woman I spoke with had trouble finding the address, but when given the cross street of the school, assured me they serviced that area.  I was calling from my place of employment, so I confirmed my cell phone number with her several times as the point of contact.  I inquired about a discount for schools, and she told me the manager wasn't there and that he was the only one with that information.  It took 15 minutes to place the order, which was already a red flag, and I stressed that we really needed the pizza by 5:30.  Another associate - Christian - got on the phone and assured me that the pizza would be delivered by 5:30 and that the manager was due to be in any minute and he would hold the ticket open to check on a coupon code.  Before hanging up, I confirmed the school address and he said, yes, we have everything.  At 5:40 (with 60 hungry kids waiting at play rehearsal), I called and confirmed that someone was on their way and was told, \\"Oh yeah, we tried to call you several times...we don't deliver to your area.\\"  I asked what phone number was called as I had provided my cell phone number multiple times and he said, \\"I don't know, we deleted the order.\\"  Total incompetence by all staff and no apology offered.

Some of the food passing by the table looked better so perhaps I've yet to find their strong suite.  The place is a little bit pricey but the large portions help to offset that (if the leftovers will survive reheating). The three main courses I tried so far were the Spicy Orange Beef, General Tso Chicken, and Mongolian Beef.  Unfortunately they were swimming in gooey or watery sauces and a light coating instead would have greatly improved their appeal. The Sizzling Rice Soup, Won-ton Soup, Egg Rolls, and Chicken Wings were good, but not spectacular. The Hot Tea was so hot I couldn't even pick up the tea cups they radiated with so much heat. There are no refills on soft drinks (it's by the can). Service was adequate. Atmosphere was mediocre, but it's hole-in-the-wall authenticity and crowded tables were charming and actually appealed to me. So I'll be back in the hope of finding their better dishes and upping their score -- or if not at least until I find a better Chinese option locally. NOTE: It took me two tries to find this place.

Definitely order the hot pot -- that's the reason for going to a Shabu restaurant. The food is brought to you raw and you cook it in broth yourself, leading to an exceptionally fresh flavor. But recognize that it takes work. You have to calculate how long you want to cook things, then fish them out (our Udon noodles were delicious, but retrieving them from the broth was like catching eels), and choose the condiments to put on top. It will be fun but messy. Make sure you're OK with your table mates putting their utensils directly into the same pot.
