The portions were large but not ridiculous.

It was delicious. The Chicken Romana was tender and loaded with artichokes and olives in a light red sauce. The house Merlot was so tasty I would buy a bottle to have at home.

The food has always been great (best Chicken Francaise in the North End) and it was my wife's birthday so when I asked her where she wanted to go it was L'Osteria.\\n\\nSo, the one star is for the food but the way we were treated was deplorable!  We arrived 6:15pm for 7pm reservations so that we could be assured a table in their main dining room and not in the basement overflow room.  The hostess (to whom my wife had spoken with) came out to get us at 6:30pm and proceeded to bring us downstairs.  I said to her that we had asked to be in the main dining room and we were willing to wait.  She said, \\"we're slammed tonight but I have a table coming up in the back corner\\".  \\n\\nWe were seated 30 minutes later (actually had to seat ourselves because the hostess was yapping away at another table for about 5 minutes).  The table was set for us but no water or bread, so after 5-6  minutes I asked the hostess if we could just have some water, and she promptly returned with water and bread.  \\n\\nThe waitress took our entree orders, and I also ordered a house salad, (which I know she heard because she asked my wife and daughter if they wanted a salad as well).  15 minutes later, still no salad, so I asked the hostess if she could just check on my salad and SHE brought it over promptly (They call it a House Salad but it is a side salad of lettuce, two slices tomato, one small black olive and three tiny red onions in a vinaigrette dressing).  I wolfed it down, thankfully, because right as I put my fork in for the last bite our dinners were served.\\n\\nMy wife and I had ordered Chicken Francaise with linguine but the pasta served to us was ziti.  I pointed this out to the waitress and she said, \\"I'm so sorry, we are out of linguini, I guess I should have told you\\".  I just stared at her with a rather distraught look, she could see I was upset, so she began to remove the  pasta saying, \\"I will get you linguini, it will be about 15 minutes\\".  WHAT, our dinners were already in front of us, so I said, \\"leave the ziti, we don't want to wait\\".  \\n\\nDinner was delicious and the waitress brought over a dessert  for my wife's birthday, on the house.  I was ready to let the 15 minute salad and the pasta caper go and planned on compensating her for this (I tend to tip 20-25% but this WAS our favorite restaurant so I was planning on giving her $15 on a $50 bill, 30%).\\n\\nWhen the check arrived I noticed a $6.00 add-on charge so I assumed this was the salad.  I said to the waitress, \\"the $6 charge was kind of steep for a side salad, could she see if they could discount it a bit (let's not forget, they switched our pasta on us without even telling us).  \\n\\nWhen the waitress came back with the bill she told me that the $6.00 I had referred to was actually for my daughter's chicken add-on (which I hadn't realize she had ordered so I was absolutely fine) BUT NOW, wait for it, you're not going to believe this, read on...\\n\\nTHERE WAS AN ADDITIONAL $6.00 CHARGE ON MY BILL!!!!!!  Not only did she NOT discount the salad, SHE ADDED THE FULL $6 COST OF THE SALAD, that wasn't originally on the bill when the bill first arrived!!  The hostess was standing right there so I asked her to look at my bill and I said, \\"when I first looked at the bill I thought the $6.00 was for the salad, which I understand now it wasn't, but now the waitress ADDED another $6.00 to the bill, that doesn't seem right?\\"\\n\\nThe HOSTESS said to me, \\"First you asked me for a better table (not actually true, we had reservations for the main dining room and arrived 45 minutes early), then you ask me to bring you a salad (again, not true, I asked if she could check on the salad I hadn't received), I'm sorry, we cannot take that off the bill\\".  \\n\\nIt was now obvious, the waitress had forgotten my salad in the first place, which is why I didn't receive it from her and it wasn't on the bill.  I said, \\"this is ridiculous, how can you do that, we come here all the time.  You should be ashamed to add this to my bill after the fact\\", to which she replied, \\"You should be ashamed of yourself\\".  THIS IS HOW YOU TALK TO A CUSTOMER? \\n\\nThe hostess took the check and my credit card to process and returned with a smile on her face and said, \\"Here's your bill sir\\" and, while literally chuckling, said, \\"The waitress said just don't tip her\\".  I guess at L'Osteria, the customer is not always right and their very happy to lose customers proving so!\\n\\nSo, if you want some good food and don't mind the poor service, terrible attitude and are willing to take whatever they decide to serve you, then this is the place for you.

The restaurant is right in the center of hotel atrium with a glass ceiling to let the sunshine in. Loved it! First course was lobster bisque, one of the best I've ever had. On to the main course Rabbit Confit on flat bread, the taste was a show stopper! A mix of citrus, butter, delicious variety of mushrooms, onions and of course perfectly cooked rabbit confit, topped with arugula on perfectly toasted flat bread. So rich and delicious! For dessert a sundae comprising of creamy vanilla chocolate ice cream on top of delicious brownie sprinkled with chocolate shavings, toasted sugar and espresso.

They advertise that everything is cooked to order and is fresh, which I am not adverse to believing.  I had two egg rolls, pork fried rice, chicken fingers, and kung pao beef with white rice.  The egg rolls were decent but I think they were vegetable.  The kung pao beef had too much celery and the sauce wasn't my favorite - it had a strange taste but it may have been due to the mushrooms they used.  The beef was a bit chewy but I really loved the peanuts and wished there were more of them.  \\n\\nMy favorites were the pork fried rice and the chicken fingers.  The rice had nice chunks of pork and it was darker in color, which I like.  The chicken fingers were huge with good breading and meaty chicken.  The duck sauce was pretty good.\\n\\nI would definitely order from here again and try the General Tso's chicken next time!"},{"name":"Petit Robert Bistro","address":"480 Columbus Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"THIS EXPERIENCE WAS SOMETHING!!\\n\\nI will start by still giving this restaurant a 5 star rating, as I have been a customer since it first opened in Kenmore Square, and then opened in the South End where I live.  I have recommended this restaurant to numerous friends.  \\n\\nI recently dined at Columbus Ave. along with 5 of my co-workers.  They had heard me rave so much, that they were very eager to try it.  Being\\nunfamiliar with French food, a couple of them had questions for the waiter.  The waiter,a pleasant heavy-set man, did not have a clue as to what Sweetbreads were, nor did the Manager (I assume).  They were able to engage a french speaking employee who fully explained Sweetbreads, along any other questions we had about the specialities on the menu.  I was shocked (and somewhat ashamed, as I had raved so very much about the establishmen), that a wait staff person was so unfamiliar with the menu.  He was pleasant, although he could have thrown out the gum he was chewing prior to working.  Quite loud and seemed to have a good repoire with a young blond waitress who was working that evening.  They seemed to be complaining about various things between them which to my way of thinking is very unprofessional.  \\n\\nWe did end up having, as usual, top quality food - so the 5 stars remain.\\nI applaud the french waiter for being so helpful to us and making the evening turn pleasant as it seemed it was going to be a touch night!\\n\\nI would suggest to the Managers and/or Owners that all of the wait staff be fully versed as to the food being offered - it is good practical business.\\nI also think that employees should not be chewing gum when waiting on customers!!

However, I visited Au Bon Pain a few mornings during the summer when during a vacation in Bean Town. And now it is time to spill the beans on this cafe. \\n\\n   Au Bon Pain is on the ground level of the Beacon Hill Wyndham. It makes for a convenient breakfast or lunch while staying in the hotel. In our case, it served as a glorified Bacon Hill Wyndham cafe. It really is a self service cafe similar to Pret Manger. As soon as you step inside the two story cafe from Cambridge Street, on the left is a self service pastry case. The case holds pastries, bread, croissants, bagels, and so on. Past case is the counter. This is where you order sandwiches, coffee beverages, and pay. There is a wide variety of breakfast and lunch sandwiches. Being a self service cafe, the customer picks up the order when it is ready. Further into the cafe and opposite the far end of the counter, is the self serve bottomless coffee station featuring a few varieties of coffee. There ought to be something for everyone. \\n\\n   In this paragraph I will discuss the food. I would always order a cup of bottomless coffee with my breakfast. As far as coffee, I rate it as \\"good.\\" That goes for the few varieties that I sipped. Ditto for the blueberry scone, that was equally good to one I'd have in a Starbuck's. The same for the poppy seed with butter. The bagels were good yet nothing exceptional. How freshly baked could a bagel be if I pick it up at the self serve pastry case then have an employee behind the counter toast it? To me a true bagel is one that is warm and soft to the touch upon paying for it. The southwest sandwich I ate on a different morning was one more good yet short of very good item. As far as the cherry danish, I give a thumb's down. A cherry danish just tastes wrong when there is no cherries or anything in it. Au Bon Pain might want to look into their quality control with their pastries if there is an accumulative 2 star rating and I purchased a cherry danish that was in reality an air danish. Beside the cherry danish the food is 3 stars. \\n\\n    What we liked about Au Bon Pain was that management never rushed us. On the days that we ate here before touring Boston, after finishing the food we took our time talking and drinking coffee. Owing to the fact that it is two floors, there were plenty of tables. \\n\\n   As far as the cafe layout, the one flaw just like quite a few Boston cafes, is that the rest room is upstairs. Access to this restroom is with a key that an employee will hand you at the counter. \\n\\n  In conclusion, Au Bon Pain is better than the two star rating it currently has. With the exception of an air danish; everything about this Au Bon Pain is good. That makes sense considering that Au Bon Pain means at (or to) the Good Bread."},{"name":"Au Bon Pain","address":"209 Cambridge St","city":"Boston","stars":"2","text":"Poor service and not friendly.

The Bianco pizza was good, the calamari pizza was apparently just ok (I didn't eat it). I watched them prepare it, and it seems that they simply place the toppings on after they bake the pizza, so a lot of toppings just fall off when you move the pizza to your plate. There were four of us, and we really didn't have room to move. We ordered two pizzas (I'm a vegetarian so we had to order an extra for me) and there was no room for two pizzas at a table for four. We had to reach blindly under the pizza for our drinks and toppings. We were also on top of the people sitting around us, which was uncomfortable. My purse even got stuck on another person's chair, that's how close we were to adjacent tables. All this after we waited an hour for a table.

We also ordered the lobster mac which I was most excited about but I was probably the least impressed with this dish. I didn't find it that cheesy and the cheese they did use was not the kind in classic mac and cheese, which threw me off.   I also found the flat noodle choice odd.

The venue is small and has a friendly vibe with the chef and his wife (owners of Salts) frequently interacting with patrons in the front of house. While the space is nice and elegant, tables are just close enough together to decrease the intimacy and the chairs were not the most comfortable. \\n\\nThe website's menu has not been updated in a while, but offers a feel of the style of cuisine offered and pricing. The menu is on the smallish side with approximately seven each of appetizers and entrees; beverage wise there is no liquor but a largish wine list (emphasis on French), a few sakes and handful of bottled beers (most of the bottled wines are at least $70, but wines by the glass were reasonable with some options in the $11 to $13 range). \\n\\nWhile none of the appetizers appealed to me (most of the non salads involved organ meats or game and I was in the mood for something milder), but nearly all the entrees were enticing. We had preordered the whole duck (it is recommended to order this in advance as there is limited availability) but inquired about sharing a second entree as a first course and were obliged (sturgeon with faux caviar made from truffle jus via spherification, accompanied by gnocchi). We were pleasantly surprised that this was delivered individually and attractively plated. This and the hot-out-of-the-oven rolls (quickly replenished when we devoured the first round) brought the evening off to a nice start. \\n\\nThe whole roasted duck is brought tableside before being carved and with the rosemary stalks protruding reminded me presentation wise as the duck at Eleven Madison Park. The duck is deboned, filled with a housemade stuffing and ample veggies (including multicolored heirloom carrots and sunchokes among other goodies) baste in the delicious rendered duck fat. I was expecting the breast meat to be on the rare to medium rare side a la Eleven Madison Park but the meat was cooked through more in the style of Peking duck. As this was the case with other ducks I observed served to nearby tables I assumed this was intentional and not that ours was overcooked. The duck was nevertheless good, but far from the best I have consumed which was a bit disappointing. Portion wise it was huge and expect leftovers if sharing enjoyed by a party of two. \\n\\nDessert had a really cool presentation; yuzu parfait with honey granita topped with cotton candy and garnished with edible flowers; hot blueberry sauce is poured tableside melting the cotton candy to sweeten the sauce. Great concept, beautiful plating, but like the duck was in the good not great category taste wise with the parfait being oddly firm with an unpleasant texture.\\n\\nOne problem we encountered was with pacing; a three course meal (plus a nice sunchoke soup amuse and light mignardises) lasted two hours and forty five minutes. I am hoping that they were short staffed or incurred a problem rather than this being typical - but if so it would have been nice for them to have acknowledged this.

I got the gravy coop and dragon girl got the large charlie bowl. Holy moley the charlie bowl is huuuuuge. That was easily 2-3 meals worth of food in a monster bowl. The fried chicken for my dish was good but the plate could have used some more gravy as my 2nd biscuit was left without any. The charlie bowl also could have used a bit more moisture. When i reheated the leftovers i added some water and it made a huge difference. My freshly squeezes oj tasted a bit like a mix betwern freshly squeezed and tropicana, not sure if they maybe mix the two a bit... still good though. Definitely get there before 1030 if you dont want to wait more than 30 mins."},{"name":"Canteen","address":"2816 SE Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Fresh n healthy in a totally Portland-esque building.

GRR!\\n\\nI went here with two friends just to check the place out and see what the hell they might have at a place called \\"maiden in the mist\\".  When we went in, I was impressed with how they made the crappiness of the sun rice interior really endearing and cozy.   What I didn't expect though was the heavy romantic vibe.  I was with two friends and I think we felt a little silly.  Mostly because of how obvious it was that we were all willing to put out if someone else picked up the tab.\\n\\nThe place has an old nautical theme, including the cuisine with lots of stews and things like that.  I appreciated it because it wasn't over-done.  It's so easy for those things to cross the line into cheesiness.  Strangely, I just noticed that their website says \\"Your neighborhood bar on the industrial cuff\\" and has a picture of a cute goth girl who kind of looks like a young drew barrymore, except goth.  What?  I didn't find the place to be the least bit \\"industrial\\" and if anything I would have phrased it something more along the lines of \\"Your quaint date restaurant on the middle-aged women cuff.\\"  I'll have to go in and consider this new perspective soon, but for now I'm gonna go ahead and say NOT INDUSTRIAL, NOT EVEN CUFF-WISE.\\n\\nThe food and drinks were both very good, if anything a little pricey for the size of the portions, I should have eaten more bread.

She brought my friend the wrong food, overcharged me by $3 for my dish, and put a neighboring table's drinks on our bill.  Wow, that's a lot of fucking up for one table, considering there were only two other parties in the place.  The food she did bring my friend was delicious though, so he just went with it, and she corrected the billing problems, though with a good deal of coaching from us.

I'll preface my review saying that I hold this restaurant to the standards of its price point and to similar charging restaurants in boston. \\n\\nmy date and I arrive on a Friday night and had a reservation, we were seated. The restaurant was very busy and loud. first comes a basket of bread and my first complaint. I noticed right away they were all cold. I'm paying upwards of 200-300 hundred, the bread should be warm. attention to detail comes with this price point. even a 40 dollar meal at cheesecake factory guarantees warm bread. second, the butter was nice and whipped but I noticed LARGE chunks of salt mixed in it, and a lot of it. Both me and my date didn't have much of the bread at all cause of this. \\n\\nthe appetizer was fried calamari. it may have been undercooked as i never really had slimy wet calamari. it wasnt very good at all, and it didnt pack a punch in terms of flavor/seasoning. date and I didn't finish the dish. \\n\\nI ordered the porterhouse steak and mashed potatoes. date ordered brick chicken and tater tots. I ordered my steak medium rare...it came well done towards the edges and medium well by the bone. did I just pay 70 bucks for an improperly cooked steak? yeah. also, salt seemed to be the only seasoning. that maybe some people's thing but not mine, I expected some black pepper or a more imaginative rub. The mashed was underwhelming, and had the consistency of cafeteria mashed potatoes you get in elementary school, maybe powder mix or mashed to hell in some sort of industrial machine. \\n\\nmy dates tater tots were disappointing. dry, hardly any seasoning, no sauce, no spice. very unimaginative and plain honestly. my dates chicken was pretty dry, once again it was VERY plain...she later asked for ketchup to dip it in cause it was so bland and unimaginative. I didn't try the risotto it came with, but she mentioned it was pretty good. \\n\\nbus boy later comes by and cleans our table, knocks my dates water over and spills it all over. ok fine, ***t happens I guess. But honestly it was probably because he was in such a rush. The place was very busy, and this is honestly a \\"churn\\" em out restaurant. everything we got was mass produced, or felt mass produced. paying this much, we did not feel special. The food was unimaginative, bland, over cooked, improperly seasoned. staff was rushed and overwhelmed it seemed. \\n\\nspend your money at other 4 dollar restaurants in boston if you're looking for a special night.

The interior of the restaurant was very warm and modern, which is a tough balance to achieve (most restaurants I find are too modern and not comfortable). We were with a large group of 14 and most were already seated by the time we arrived.\\n\\nWe had 1 main server and 1 assisting her and they both did an excellent job at taking care of us.

The octopus was extremely tender and meaty, perfectly (and I just cannot stress enough how perfectly it was cooked). This is the way octopus should be served to you! My only complaint was that there was barely any octopus on my otherwise huge plate of roasted peppers and onions. \\nThe cured meat was an assortment of prosciutto etc. served with large flat breads that was quite yummy.\\n\\nMy dinner partners decided on monkfish and the 3 piggies while I opted for the red snapper to split and share. My favorite was the monkfish, it's served on seasoned lentils so it has a heavier, spiced taste that complimented the heartiness of monkfish. Overall, very delicious. \\nMy snapper was runner up. It was very crispy on the outside and had a nice, compact meat that was also delicious. My least favorite was the 3 piggies. \\nI found that the pork variety was very bland and tough to even cut through much lest chew. \\n\\nSince this was a birthday dinner party, we opted to have our cupcakes for dessert instead of trying one of the restaurants. \\n\\nThis is not a place to go if you are on a limited budget. SO and my dinner along with 2 cocktails came to about $130 alone. \\n\\nThe service was very, very attentive and good, the food a bit of a hit and miss depending on what you order, and I must gripe about the portions, they just don't match up with the price point."},{"name":"Tom's Bao Bao","address":"84 Winthrop St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"Great little place for lunch today.

What was most memorable during my dining experience that night was the service. Our waiter was very attentive and made some good recommendations. \\n\\nI tried the kobe dumplings, lobster bisque, beef wellington, rack of lamb, bananas foster, and creme brulee. The kobe dumplings were very delicious because the beef had a strong buttery flavor and it was so tender that it melts in your mouth. The black pepper/soy sauce they paired with went well with the dumplings and enhanced the natural beef flavor. The lobster bisque was very standard. \\n\\nThe highlight of the meal was the beef wellington. The flavor was so complex because of the many layers--phyllo dough, spinach, foie gras, mushrooms, and of course the beef. Writing this review makes me want to go back again just to order the beef wellington again.\\n\\nI thought the rack of lamb was not bad, but it was a little on the dried side. That could have been due to my request because I wanted medium instead of medium rare. I thought the mint jelly would be weird because I am not a fan of mint, but the sweetness of the jelly balanced the savoriness of the lamb. The mint flavor was not that strong either. \\n\\nAs for dessert, I opt for something light because I had so much to eat! So I ordered the creme brulee. It was good but not the best creme brulee that I had. I wish it was more vanilla-y. There was a good contrast of texture from the creaminess of the custard to the crispiness of the caramel that was on top of the brulee. The fruits lightened the heaviness of the custard and the sweetness of the caramelized sugar. The banana foster was pretty good and our server complimented on our choice when we ordered it. Sometimes banana foster has a bitterness to it because there is too much rum or they didn't evaporate all of the alcohol, but the one we had was delicious. \\n\\nThis is perfect for dates or small gathering with a couple of friends.

Wei Wei can only accommodate about 20 people at a time, so make sure to peek your head in and see if there's space during a rush hour. \\n\\nIt's a simple and clean space with lots of white decor and a pop of yellow in their seating. A straightforward menu--with a series of soups, rice bowls, bao, and small plates--is written up on a large blackboard wall. Although it feels a little bit sterile, Wei Wei's unpretentious simplicity is it's strength. It doesn't overcomplicate and doesn't fuss it up, unlike many of its peers in Portland. \\n\\nTheir tea list is impressive, but the iced tea (specifically the passionfruit) tasted too sweet. The three-bite bao seem overpriced and unimpressive, but perhaps it's just in comparison to the massive noodle soups. Grilled squid had great presentation and charred flavor, but I personally can't get over the texture of squid. I'd recommend adding some spice on everything; I think they play to the lowest common denominator for spice tolerance, but there's sriracha and chili oil for the rest of us. \\n\\nThe beef soup is the only reason Wei Wei is 4/5 instead of 3/5. This soup is a miracle, a blessing, and a warm noodle-y embrace. It could use some more greens, but the broth is a fatty and delicious surprise. It coats your mouth with a flavorful heat; I wish I could dip everything from Wei Wei in it. And by dip, I mean drench. The noodles are soft and fresh, and after a day in the fridge they become even more flavorful as leftovers. There's a reason why even the lukewarm reviews rave about it. \\n\\nAs far as the service goes, I'm hesitant to critique a new restaurant with surprising popularity. I'm sure they're adjusting their workflow as time goes on. I did end up waiting quite a while as they prepared a massive to-go order. Service is pleasant enough, and the waiter did apologize for the wait upon noticing me impatiently look over my shoulder. \\n\\nMy ideal meal at Wei Wei:* \\nPan-fried bao (pricier and juicier than the regular bao)\\nBeef soup \\nSaut√©ed mustard greens (because after all that meat you'll want some veggies, but make sure to add some spice!)\\n*This will leave plenty for leftovers at home."},{"name":"Dunn's Famous","address":"827 Seymour Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"\\"if we moved to Vancouver would this satisfy your craving for deli?\\" \\"Oh Yeah!\\". \\n\\nwhile it looks like pastrami its not and it is. its prepared and taste like pastrami but they don't use the naval end of the brisket. so in turn its softer the bite and not as soft-tough as a NY pastrami even if you order a Katz pastrami fatty. their rye could use some work, it felt like store bought rye.     \\n\\none thing that surprised was their matzoh ball soup. great broth and great tasting matzoh ball but again killed by the very warm broth. is there some kind of hot foods law that soup broth can't be hotter than hell in Vancouver? nothing in this world is more comforting on a cold day than hot soup. \\n\\n\\nwhen we had dunns famous we just had Canters pastrami and brisket on rye less than a week ago before boarding our flight. dunns I would say was better than canters pastrami. why? it took what I love about pastrami (taste) and what I love about brisket (texture) and called it Montreal Smoked Meat. can't wait to try the real deal when we go to Montreal."},{"name":"Addis Restaurant","address":"3750 Cleveland Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"This is a hidden gem in the heart of Columbus.

Not even a hint of romaine. Also, get this. They don't have Italian dressing. Cool story bro tell it again? The Old Spaghetti Factory doesn't have Italian dressing.\\n\\nI ordered the Meat Lovers, I think was the name. Meatball, sausage, and meat sauce over spaghetti. The entire plate was cooked to death. The sausage I'm sure they start poaching first thing in the morning and just pull from the water to order, regardless of how long it's been dying. The noodles were way over cooked. I imagine they aren't cooking pasta to order, but they are a noodle house. They need to come up with a process. Cook 30 orders at a time if you need to. There's no reason to be serving mush. Al Dente! The meatballs? Same. Everything on the plate had the exact same texture. From the noodles to the sauce to the sausage and meatballs.\\n\\nNormally there's cross-table sharing and discussion of food, but not this time around. I didn't poke at anyone elses food and no one volunteered to share. I'm not sure if theirs was delicious and they were holding out on me or if everyone was dining in the same shame that I was.\\n\\nA curious business model I must say. To invest so heavily in d√©cor, high backed chairs, elaborate furniture and interior architecture and chandeliers, and have such terrible food. They could really use a menu consultant to some degree.

I honestly cannot recall what we ordered, but I know I loved it.\\n\\nAnd now comes along the need to take in dinner at a unique and novel location.   Moroccan food seemed like just the ticket for date night.\\n\\nWe arrived early, at around 5:45, and the place was almost empty.  We were seated in the larger room away from the entrance.  One of the most jarring things about the location is that when you step in the door, diners are right there in front of you.  There's no real lobby to speak of, as low couches and floor cushions abound and people basically just cop a squat wherever they're pointed.\\n\\nSo we're practically in the middle of the floor, sitting on very low cushions, at very low table.   I think this effect is deliberate; you are not at McDonalds, this is an experience restaurant, step out of your comfort zone.\\n\\nThe young lady designated to serve us (I would not quite call her a hostess or a waitress; neither seem dignified enough for her role) came over and set a large basin on the table and poured water over our hands to clean them.  There are no eating utensils at Marrakesh; you eat with your fingers.  And since part of the fun is sharing dishes with your companions, it's nice to see everyone wash their hands first.  Large, fluffy white towels are also present for your lap, for finger wiping.\\n\\nSo the wonderful lady explains the menu, which doesn't take too much.  Each person picks an entree (for four or more people, I cannot recommend the Royal Feast enough.  I remember this from my last visit, it's a number of house selections made by the chef, of whatever is the absolute best at the time, and served to the table at large.  It was fabulous, but requires a minimum of four people) and that entree is part of a five course meal.\\n\\nIt is possible to purchase and consume an entire sheep, but it requires three days notice.  Call ahead!\\n\\nI ordered the Tagine of Chicken with Honey and Prunes, my lovely companion ordered the Chicken Brochette.  Perhaps not the most daring of choices on either of our parts, but solid representations of the food.\\n\\nWe were given a \\"salad,\\" which I confess, I did not try.  Wonderful pieces of bread were served to us out of a large communal basket, and you use that bread to scoop up bits of the (what appeared to be) hummus-like mass in the middle of a ring of chopped vegetables.  I am just not a salad person.  We also received small bowls of lentil soup, which you drink from the bowl.  The soup was spicy and delicious, and very hot without being scalding.\\n\\nNext is one of the more alien (to American palates, that is) dishes, but really isn't all that exotic when you think about it.   They bring you a medium sized, round flaky pastry dusted with a generous amount of powdered sugar, and inside is a combination of spiced chicken and almonds, perhaps a few other similar ingredients.  You tear into the pastry and eat it all with your fingers.  The pastry is just that, a sweet pastry, and the powdered sugar gets everywhere, yet all it does is bring out the wonderful spices in the chicken, and the flaky texture perfectly compliments the chicken and almonds.  I had completely forgotten about this part of the meal, and was happy to remember it all over again.\\n\\nOur main dishes arrived and were excellent.  The Chicken Brochette had a great spice to it, and was very flavourful.  My chicken with honey sauce was surprising at first, it's not quite what you expect, I guess, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I was a bit startled to find the bone in the middle, but that's more my fault than anything else.  I'm just used to being coddled in restaurants.  After that, I easily just tore off bits of chicken with my fingers and enjoyed it that way.  My companion felt the same way about my dish, that it wasn't what one expected to taste, but I notice she ate all of the portion that I shared with her.\\n\\nDesert was a small bowl of mild pudding, with almonds and coconut.  It was delicately sweet and capped off the meal nicely.\\n\\nIn the middle of the meal (which is a long, leisurely affair, have no doubt), a very stunning woman came out and performed a belly dance, complete with sword balanced on her head.  Quite amazing, really, and definitely something worth seeing.\\n\\nA wonderful experience, and one I will not wait another five years to have again.\\n\\nOne last note:  My friend pointed out that the menu said something to the effect of  \\"Welcome to the friendly, warm authentic taste of Morocco,\\" and emblazoned in the background of said menu was a number of men, charging forward on horseback with swords waving over their heads.

They've remodeled since then but the interior is still awkward, they need a restaurant architect.\\n\\nI left with the exact same opinion and almost the same experience as the last time. The food is hit/miss and lack's consistency, not just conceptually but also the quality. Some things burst with flavor and others are bland and to make matters worse we had temp issues with the food being tepid, both times we went. We had to send a dish back because, although cooked it was sort of room temp. Concluding our meal this time again the dessert (bread pudd)  was tepid and unappealing and the coffee was room temp.\\n\\nIs it Asian Nouveau or is it Northern Italian? Persoanly I think the chef does the Asian better than the Italian!  I think if the chef were to hone his skills/influence on one of the two we would have a better experience. I'd venture to say he could give Wellesley's Iron Chef a run for his money, IF he were to focus on (1) concept.\\n\\nIn addition, it's \\"stuffy\\" in a formal, unappealing way, they are trying too hard and/or take themselves too seriously. I imagine a manager constantly scrutinizing and micromanaging the staff (who looked uptight).

It was basically tiny cuts of tender beef marinated in a sweet soy marinade. It's served with a mountain of the beef laksa, rice, some veggies and a sunny side up egg. The tart fish sauce can be poured over if you like.

But, what isn't understandable was waiting over an hour for a table. Meanwhile, people arriving after us, seemed to get tables before us. And this is for a party of two. \\n\\nBesides the above, once seated, we waited a long time for each part of the meal.  It took a while to be greeted by our server, get water, place drink orders and get refills on our coffee, which we had brought with us from the waiting area.  After placing our orders, we waited over 45 minutes for our meals.  We ordered dishes that should not have any reason for taking over 45 minutes, regardless of how busy it was inside the restaurant.  With a restaurant that has a high volume of people during brunch time, you would think that timing would be a lot better.  Once our food did arrive; pimento cheese omelette and meatloaf sandwich, both dishes were cold.  You could tell by looking at the omelette and feeling the heat from the plate that it had been sitting under the heat lamp for far too long.  There were plenty of people walking around the restaurant that someone could have run the food in time and not let it sit up there for over 10 minutes.  I have worked in the food industry for a long time and I understand the importance to get the food out immediately.  We did not mention the fact that our food was cold, from the sheer fact that we did not want to wait any longer for food.  We did not want them to heat the food up in the microwave or for our food to be lost on the line, again.  \\n\\nThis being said, the food could have been enjoyable, if it wasn't cold.

The nice hostess gave me a shout back promptly the next morning around 11am and asked when we would like a reservation. Went with a 7pm time and it was on like Donkey Kong. My palms were sweating with anticipation. \\n\\nHere's the deal: If you're planning on eating at Gunshow, take heed to the words of other recent patrons -- It's dim sum-style. Not exactly a \\"traditional\\" dim sum experience, but sticks to the main idea. You're going to have chefs whizzing around the kitchen, plating dishes, and then making their way out into the room with their creations. ***DON'T*** be prepared to \\"put in an order\\" off of the menu. The food comes to you, in no distinct cadence. Let me rephrase: Utter brilliance. I can easily say this has been my favorite dining experience of the past 5 years without the shadow of a doubt. The menu is laid before you, you see what's on the docket de cuisine for the evening, and then when each respective chef/menu item makes it's way to your table, you give it the ol' Caesaric thumbs up or thumbs down. If you want it, it's yours and they mark a tally on your menu, if not, then it's onto another table of greener pastures. Simple as that. Be prepared for this style of dining, have the right attitude, and you're in for a real treat. \\n\\nHere's what we had (in no order of favoritism): \\n\\nMezze Plate of local veg\\nCoq au vin, butternut pancake, truffle mousse\\nRoasted Mushrooms, fromage blanc, sous vide egg, arugula\\nSzechuan Fried Shrimp\\nAssorted Savory, spicy, crispy, and crunchy snacks\\nAutumn Greens Salad w/ apple, pistachio, fennel, chevre\\nPork Belly, Steam Bun, Braised Cabbage, Pickled Carrot (This was the coup de gracie for me. Probably one of the best things I've eaten in the past year)\\nBONUS: My wife is a vegetarian and Chef created a Steam Bun with mushrooms instead of pork belly just for her. Yes, it was effing amazing\\nJoey's Pumpkin Dessert\\nKevin's old-fashioned banana pudding\\nChocolate Thin Mint\\nA few beers to boot\\n \\n(Note: The menu changes daily-ish and weekly. You may see some popular things on the menu for longer spurts of time and others may a little more fleeting. Just be aware that the menu [above] may not exist past this week or next.)\\n\\n Extra bonus: Chef's beard and general astute beard-growing skills are out-of-this-world.\\n\\nThe service, care, consideration for local product, and amount of pure love and fun they put into the menu shows. These guys and gals dig what they do. They've created an atmosphere that can be approached from every angle and they make you feel welcome, make sure you get the gist of how everything works, and offer every ounce of gratitude for you being a patron. \\n\\nGunshow just stole my culinary heart and, for that, I am thankful."},{"name":"Grill 23 & Bar","address":"161 Berkeley St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I haven't been here for years, but wanted to give them another try.

This original location has so much charm and quirkiness to it, it's usually our go to rita stop when we find ourselves in West Austin.  We have our favorite items which ties us over while have a few of their ritas.\\n\\nWe generally will start  with the Tejas Trio.  A great combination of Queso, Salsa and Guacamole.  The chips are always excellent.  Their Salsa has a great smokiness to it, perhaps Adobe spice, not sure, but it is a bit different from other Tex-Mex offerings around town.  The Guacamole is fresh and Queso is creamy with a swirl of salsa placed on top.\\n\\nWe then jump into the Aha Tuna appetizer.  This is one of our favorite appetizers in town.  Often copied elsewhere, but they don't quite hit the mark like they do at Z'Tejas.  Blackened and encrusted with sesame seeds makes for a crunchy, velvety tuna experience.  They have a peppercorn vinaigrette which is laid down on the plate first, with the Tuna placed on top.  It's a great play on the sweetness of the vinaigrette and the blackened spice rub on the Tuna.\\n\\nAnd for the win, their friggin cornbread served in a skillet.  Who would of thought such a simple dish could round out these two appetizers, but it does.. in spades.  Make sure you ask for a serving when you are there.\\n\\nDrinks are on point.  During their happy hour you will find the above Appy's between 5-7 bucks and signature margarita's at 5 bills.  We usually like the frozens with a chambord swirl in them.

The smallest of these was still a hearty portion  at quite a reasonable price.  The pho was tasty, although the spicy lemongrass beef pho was not quite the dish we had in mind, lacking the signature fiery red broth in favor of standard beef broth.  As is true of many restaurants, meat portions were a little leaner than we'd imagined, but still well-balanced.  Overall, a delightful spot for a quiet dinner."},{"name":"Gunshow","address":"924 Garrett St, Ste C","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I want to appreciate the concept here, but unless it offers some utility, there's no point. To some extent it seemed that the dimsum style hindered the food from being properly executed. Only about half of the items I tried were truly delicious. Shout out to the broccoli risotto and salad with ginger and pumpkin. The fact that I couldn't really enjoy items like the lobster with squid ink fettuccine and the foie with date sauce (AND date cake) should be a fair warning. The lobster was overcooked, and needed something to round out the flavor of the sauce (the Danish cookie crumbs didn't help). The foie, while seared beautifully on the outside, wasn't that great quality in terms of flavor. I loved the idea of the date puree, but the additional date cake made it too sweet. Then there was the pork dumplings- $13 for two shitty dumplings that had less flavor than the average dimsum place, and a wrapper that was thicker than a turtle's skin. I could have gotten 2 orders of great xlb for the same price. The banana pudding was just weak- this is Georgia, step up your game if you're gonna serve it. Lastly, as another review stated, the food is a bit overpriced, and this is coming from someone who'd happily pay $500 for meal... as long as it's worth it. I'll be back to see if the night before the break was just a bad time, but unfortunately I don't have high hopes. I don't know the criteria for what dishes can be served, but this was an interesting dinner nonetheless as it reminded me of a typical episode of a cooking competition e.g. Top Chef: there were some hits, misses, and very few homeruns.

Specifically, Ledet, Desta, and Meskerem share the same parking lot at the corner of Clairmont and Briarcliff.  I've been to all three and each is pretty good in its own right.  Desta seems to be the most popular.  I'm no Ethiopian food connoisseur, but I think the food at Meskerem and Ledet are just as good.  Service-wise, Meskerem takes the cake, followed closely by Desta.  This is where Ledet can most improve.\\n\\nLedet is in its own standalone building, which looks to be an old house remodeled into a restaurant.  The front entrance of the restaurant faces Briarcliff, but you can enter the parking lot from either Clairmont or Briarcliff.  Ledet is located across from a Chevron gas station and next to a small car emissions inspection stand.\\n\\nInside, the restaurant has pretty basic decor.  Hardwood floors, white tablecloths, wooden cushioned chairs, a handful of booths, and a small bar.  There is one semi-private, elevated table at one end of the restaurant that is specially decorated for special meals.  There are also two TVs (HD) mounted on either side of the interior and a small stage with large speakers and music equipment, for occasional live Ethiopian music performances during the weekends.  Finally, there's a small, umbrella-covered patio outside for outdoor dining.\\n\\nLedet has a generally simple menu which consists mostly of in-house special dishes, tibs (sauteed meat and vegetables), and kitfo (raw/rare ground beef marinated in chili powder).  An example of a special includes the \\"Fifity Fifty,\\" which is cubes of beef marinated in kibe (Ethiopian butter), mitmita (spicy Ethiopian powdered seasoning), and other spices.  The special gets its name because half the dish is cooked and topped with jalapenos and rosemary and half is raw.  Most of the entrees are anywhere from $10 to $14, which in my experience, is normal for Ethiopian food in this town.\\n\\nOne item on the menu that caught my eye is the \\"Ethiopian Sushi\\" ($4).  I ordered it once out of curiosity and was pleasantly surprised.  It's chopped fish, marinated, and rolled in injera (Ethiopian spongy flatbread).  It's cut into eight bite-sized pieces.  The appetizer resembles sushi in both look and presentation (it's served on a sushi dish).  Tasty and neat.\\n\\nAll entrees are served with a basket of fresh injera.  No eating utensils are used in Ethiopian cuisine.  Instead, you tear off pieces of injera and use them to pick up whatever meat, vegetable, or stew is on your plate.  For entrees, I recommend the both the Ledet Meat Combo ($14) and the Goden Tibs ($13).\\n\\nFor $14, the Meat Combo is a good value.  It comes with vegetables, Doro Wot (Ethiopian chicken and hard boiled egg stew), and Alicha Fitfit (Ethiopian gingered stew with butter/oil and vegetables).  The Meat Combo is served on a plate with four compartments.  Two compartments have chicken and two have beef.  Both pieces of chicken are cut bone-in and are simmering in rich buttery stews, one yellow and one red.  Both chicken compartments also come with one hard-boiled egg.  The beef compartments have chunks of sauteed beef with sliced tomatoes, onions, jalapenos, and rosemary.  Overall, both the chicken and beef in the Meat Combo are tender and flavorful and it's a very filling dish.\\n\\nThe Goden Tibs are prime short ribs that are slowly fried then grilled with tomatoes, onions, japanenos, and rosemary.  These remind me of Korean galbi (short ribs) except without the marinade.  The Goden Tibs are served hot from the kitchen and vigorously sizzling on an iron skillet.  The ribs still have the bone attached and the meat is extra smoky and savory.  They are delicious and served with a small refreshing side salad of lettuce and tomatoes.\\n\\nService is satisfactory.  It doesn't take terribly long for the food to come out, but the servers could stand to be a bit more attentive for little things like refilling drinks and bringing the check.  Also, the last time I went, the dirty paper placemats from the previous diner(s) at our booth had not been replaced.  Isn't the whole point of paper placemats is that you throw them away after each use?\\n\\nLedet has some good lunch specials ($6.99 for one meat and two vegetables) and they're also open late (until 1am or 2am most nights)."},{"name":"Dinesty Dumpling House","address":"4501 Kingsway, Suite 104","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3","text":"I'm surprised the reviews are so poor.

The pork XLB are very good. The dumpling skin is thin and the meat is flavorful. The crab and pork XLB is even better! Worth the extra price. You can taste the prominent crab. The pan fried shrimp and pork potstickers may even be better than Din Tai Fung. It's extremely crispy. The shanghai noodles are delicious. Sensibly salted and stir fried to a nice chewiness.

The goat cheese was wonderful--subtle but sharp at the same time.  And I loved the pistachios.  I've never thought to combine pistachios with cheeses.\\n\\nThe third item we had was the tuna tartare which was good, not fantastic, but only b/c the lemon creme fraiche seemed to lack the lemon...or perhaps there was just too much creme fraiche on our tartare.

I absolutely HATE waiting for food, but my friend said that it was going to be that anywhere on this side of town. So we sucked it up and 30mins turned out to be closer to 15. We got sat at the counter (I'm guessing the origin of their namesake) and I perused their menu. It had all the basic Austin brunch fodder and fare. I love benedicts, so I decided to order the seared pastrami benedict since that was a first and I like to try and be food-venturous when I can. My friend ordered one of their blueberry pancakes and the thing was not only thick and ginormous, but the way they make it the blueberries basically melt into the batter. I had a few bites and, though I am not usually a pcake person, it was actually pretty damn delicious!\\n\\nI wish I could say the same for my benedict. It was ok, but maybe I had just set the bar too high. The seared pastrami was good, but again, nothing mind blowing. The potatoes were just ok too. \\n\\nNow the reason for the rating. First off, while I appreciate our waitress was busy (I was a waitress for hot minute, so I empathize with being SWAMPED, but when I was overwhelmed I either asked for help or made all kinds of notes when tables made requests, especially for refills); but the fact that she forgot my coffee refill multiple times and then ran out of carafes for our mimosa (which was not her fault) so she said she would bring us individual glasses that would be equivalent to 3 each, though I only got two even though I asked twice for my 3rd, (which was her fault) did not sit well with me. Second, again, I can appreciate the place is busy, but to run out of mimosa carafes on a brunch day is just bad management. Either have the stock or have someone washing them like crazy. I absolutely HATED having to sit there and wait to try and catch the waitress to request my next mimosa and then have to wait again for her to bring it. It may sound like a trivial first world gripe, but when the carafe costs $20, I should be able to drink my mimosas at my leisure and not have to stress about if and when I am getting my next fix of watermelon juice and champagne between bites. \\n\\nIn any case, there was nothing special or good enough about this place to bring me back, especially for the inconvenience of the wait, service and price point.

The chicken dish with nuts, eggs, and raisins baked into a flakey pastry with powdered sugar is fantastic. The lemon olive chicken, lamb couscous, apricot chicken and beef kabobs ... all excellent. And the mint tea at the end is a winner. That's the good news.\\n\\nBut: we were there on a Sunday with a large party. The waiter steered us quite forcefully into the Royale Feast for 10 (we were 4 adults, 4 children and 2 teenagers, to be joined by 1 more adult with toddler). We thought that would be too much food, but he waived us off, told us not to worry. \\n\\nWe were right to be concerned. First to arrive was a big (tasty) salad and a huge meat starter, which together filled up 2 of the kids. Our friend showed late, but departed again just 20 minutes later when her little boy started acting out. We again asked our server to reduce our order, and he again blew us off. When the main courses arrived, we knew we were in trouble: no fewer than 6 platters of meats and rice and sauce, each enough to feed at least 2 or 3 adults. We did the best we could, and maybe plowed through a little under half the food. The server smilingly boxed up the remains, but then-- here's the fun part-- charged us for a group of 11. We felt taken. \\n\\nHow do you fight it? Call for the owner, make a scene in a crowded restaurant? With all the kids watching? Haul the server to the kitchen and demand a discount? Stick part of the bill on the friend with the cranky kid?\\n\\nGo for the food and the experience. Ever eat leg of lamb or chicken in prune sauce with your hands? Nothing compares. And the table hand-washing ceremony is great, and the giant towel you get for a napkin. The kids were enthralled with the dancer, who even gave the girls a quick lesson.

Normally, I'd be quite content to sit at the bar and have a cocktail, but the place is so super small that it was impossible to hover without knocking in to people. And my dream of a cocktail was ruined upon discovering they're a beer and wine only establishment. But as someone who has never turned down a glass of wine in her life, the crowded bar was my only issue. \\n\\nThe intimacy of the place is quite nice once at a table and the few severs, although busy, were more than happy to help us in whatever way possible. The service was great overall and everyone was very accommodating.\\n\\nWe started with their amazing calamari, and as a fried food expert I was delighted to find this was drizzled with a bangin' aioli and there were plenty of tentacles.

So we got six halves...\\n\\nFig and Proscuitto - YUM.

Classic marinara and mozzarella. But I'd guess that it's probably better than you've had it before... or a close second anyway.\\nPortabello - These steaky mushrooms were amazing, drizzled with a bit of truffle oil and a mushroom puree. So delightful.\\nBBQ Pork (I think) - This was a special and it was my favorite! It was BBQ and topped with a creamy cole slaw. I know what you're thinking, cole slaw ON pizza?!?! I don't even like cole slaw but something about the creamy crisp-ness of the slaw, paired with the sharp BBQ sauce, and on top of the crisp and doughy pizza... well, it made my life better. If you see it listed as a special when you go, dare to give it a try.\\n\\nNext time I'll be trying the pizza with what looks like a salad on it. Maybe it's basil but it looked like spinach.

We sat at the bar and had a REALLY awkward bartender. Like, SUPER awkward. He made me feel really uncomfortable and I can't explain why. The way that he talked to us and his mannerisms...weren't very polite or hospitable yet he didn't say anything inappropriate.  Food was good though...love the fried short ribs. They looked like cubes of fried mozzarella on the outside but on the inside had super tender, juicy meat which melted in your mouth. Loved the aoili sauce on it, too. 3 stars.\\n\\n- Room service in our hotel room. I was feeling under the weather (surprise surprise) and we ended up cancelling our reservation at Andimo (sp?) to stay in. Luckily, our room service order came from Urban Farmer. I had the hand cut pasta with mushrooms and tomatoes with 6 oz of flat iron steak added. I LOVED the cut of pasta...it tasted really fresh and the tomatoes were great, too. I didn't really like the mushrooms...they weren't my favorite. Another thing I didn't like was the saturation of oil on the pasta. WAY too much. 4 stars though because the pasta and steak were so good. \\n\\n- Breakfast. Can you tell we didn't get out much? Thanks to my not feeling well, we didn't venture far for breakfast either. Ended up here and I ordered a flat iron steak (because it was so good the night before)  with sausage gravy, a potato patty, and 2 eggs over easy. Oh, and a bloody mary at the bloody mary bar. So I probably shouldn't have ordered the bloody mary...especially because I remembered after I got it and took a sip that I had just taken some meds. Oops. But they have this awesome bar with tons of pickled veggies (green beans were my favorite) as was the candied bacon. Delicious! The steak was great as was the gravy. Because the steak with gravy was so good, the egg and potato patty was nothing special. 4 stars. \\n\\nAll in all, all three experiences were not as great as my first time there...but still satisfying overall. A solid 4 stars."},{"name":"Mar's Meadows Chinese Restaurant","address":"9620 N Whitaker Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Great General Tso's chicken. The best I've had in Portland so far.

Since then, employees stepped up and kept things going and the restaurant continued in an excellent fashion -- till now. A silent owner has come forward and hired on a new chef, beverage director, and is changing the design and feel of Vino Vino. When I inquired about the changes, they said the goal was to make a \\"world class restaurant\\" and to also run a less nice wine bar. The issue I have is I dislike with all of the changes so far. The wine by the glass menu options are smaller than they used to be. All the food items we loved are now absent from the menu. The cheese plate we ordered came with just 3 pieces of cheese on a normal dinner plate. This is a striking change from the days of old when the cheese plate playing was dressed up with laced honey and garnished with some chopped nuts. We were offered carrots as a compliment of the chef but they came out mushy, as if they were frozen - not caramelized like you would expect. The coffee service is gone. \\n\\nAesthically, there are big issues. There is a huge and very ugly cooler in the middle of the wine bar room and then two other wine coolers. The staff claims there was no longer room for it in the kitchen, so it was put in the common area of the wine bar for convenience. It's a HUGE eyesore. Now there are big red velvet drapes dividing the wine bar and restaurant which look like something which was a great idea in the 90's. The restaurant area is really not attractive. The art seems cheap, like it was bought from Hobby Lobby. The booths they installed are okay but they are a striking blue color which conflicts with the red drapes and bright art work and white painted walls. Sadly, Vino Vino reminds me of an establishment that is lost. Is it a wine bar or a restaurant? When asked about this, we were told \\"the restaurant will be first class, the bar will be coach. We know we may lose some regulars with the changes.\\" How in the hell is the restaurant first class? It looks cheapened. Our dining experience did not bode well on the restaurant -- although we only tried a few of the new things. \\n\\nI am trying to keep an open mind here but Vino Vino did some simple things very very well and the new direction seems to disregard that. The new direction seems like a solution in search of a problem. I hope I am wrong as we have loved Vino Vino for years."},{"name":"Salts Restaurant","address":"798 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"We went to Salts for the first time for our anniversary.  From start to finish, the entire experience was amazing.  Here's what happened:\\n\\nI called more than a month in advance to reserve a table.  I spoke to Analia, one of the owners, who couldn't have been nicer.  She said she'd put my time down tentatively, but since it was so far away, they may have a private party or another event that would preclude us from getting a table.  She said she we would most likely be able to get a table, but I should call her back approximately three weeks before the date just to confirm.  I did that, spoke to Analia again, who was again gracious and charming.  She said our table was reserved and she'd see us then.  I mentioned we were coming for the first time to Salts, we were very excited and it was our anniversary.  \\n\\nThe night arrived and we showed up at Salts on time for our 8:15 reservation.  Nearly every other table was taken and we were seated immediately.  Analia guided us to a table with gold stars and hearts pieces drizzled on the table.  Analia said the table was ours for the remainder of the evening, as she knew it was a special occasion and had also decorated the table (the stars and hearts) for our anniversary.  A very nice and thoughtful touch and a great start to the night.\\n\\nFrom there, the incredible food took over.  Here's what we ate:\\n\\nFresh, warm, homemade sourdough rolls:  We each got two rolls.  I've never seen that before, but didn't complain.  The bread was wonderful and the salted butter that came with it was tasty.\\n\\nAmuse Bouche:  A corn puree soup.  Light and delicious and a nice start to the meal.\\n\\nAppetizers:  We had three (we were starving):  Bergamot Cured Ocean Trout, Rabbit Three Ways, Soft Cooked Farm Egg.  The trout was like trout sashimi, the rabbit was fantastic and I didn't get any egg because my wife devoured it.  Everything was prepared magnificently and the flavors were fantastic.  Wow, these were some great appetizers.\\n\\nEntrees:  We had two:  Sturgeon and Agnolotti.  The fish was prepared impeccably, with light potato gnocchi as an accompaniment.  I tried the agnolotti and while it was stuffed with peas (not my favorite veggie), the flavor was outstanding and my wife loved it.  The sturgeon was as good of a piece of fish as I've had in many years.\\n\\nDessert:  Panna cotta with strawberries and tiny pieces of sponge cake with some small serving of ice cream.  When it was served, there was a candle and a cookie with \\"Happy Anniversary\\" written on it.  Again, a small touch, but very thoughtful.  \\n\\nAfter that, when we received the check, we received some green tea shortbreads and some jellied candies that were delicious.  My wife had two glasses of wine and I had two Diet Cokes.  Total bill, before tip, was $160.\\n\\nMy only note of caution is that you should be prepared to have a leisurely dinner.  Our meal took 2 hours and 20 minutes.  At no time did I think they had forgotten about us, but the pace is slower because Analia personally attends to each table.  It's not a big place, but there are enough tables to keep things busy.  So when you go, know that this is not the type of place where you'll get out in 90 minutes.  The pace is slower, but man, it is worth it.  I've lived in the Boston area for nearly two years and go to dinner 3-4 times per month.  Salts is one of the five best dinners I've had since I've been in Boston.\\n\\nI can't recommend this place highly enough.  Analia is so warm and welcoming and really gives the impression that she wants guests to enjoy themselves.  The food is spectacular and the space is large enough so you don't feel on top of one another, but small enough that it feels intimate.  We will definitely be going back soon.\\n\\nMeals like the one we had at Salts remind me why I love to go to dinner and how exciting good food and service can be.

The menu selections are solid -- having tried a few of them (Caesar salad, raw tuna salad, three-cheese flatbread pizza), I have no doubt that the others are just as serviceable.  The service itself has been efficient and friendly in my experience, including on an extremely busy Friday night.  I was disappointed by my cocktail, an alleged Tangerine Mojito that tasted like neither, but I'm willing to give the bar the benefit of the doubt.  In all, Temple Bar is a choice that's hard to argue with, especially if some diners in your party are less adventurous or if your group can't agree on an ethnic cuisine.  And yet, I won't be back if I can avoid it.  Why?  Because this place feels generic, so similar to Grafton Street, the Tavern on the Square franchise, and seemingly thousands of others as to be almost indistinguishable from them.  (Also, the entrees seem overpriced for what they are, which is nothing special.)

Also, the black pepper conchiglie was crazy peppery, heavy, and just not that good. Lastly, service was a let down. The 30 minutes between the appetizers and mains was a bit on the long side and the lack of communication resulted in over half hour before anyone asked if we wanted something additional to drink.

Since then it's become a fast casual staple for my girlfriend and I. The food is pretty good, and it's quick, but doesn't taste pre packaged, which is nice.\\n\\nMy favorite thing on the menu is the Alfredo MontAmore, which is spaghetti noodles, Alfredo sauce, Parmesan crusted chicken, spinach, mushrooms, and tomatoes. Not the healthiest thing on the menu, but I love it. It started out as a seasonal dish and made it on the menu permanently, so I was happy.\\n\\nAlso excellent: the penne rosa, especially if you get it with feta instead of Parmesan. It's a little spicy, which makes it a nice change from a lot of their dishes. I recommend adding in Parmesan crusted chicken to it too.\\n\\nThe not so good seems to be their Asian dishes. Maybe I'm just not into their kind of Asian noodle dishes, but they don't taste that good to me. I tried my girlfriend's Thai Hot Pot one day, and the sweet-spicy combination of the broth really threw me off. \\n\\nAlso, their iced tea is bad. Not bad like Chevy's had, but it's like coloured water. They changed from their previous brand, which I think was China Mist, to HonestT. Their normal iced tea is like coloured water, it has almost no taste. And their \\"slightly sweet lemon tea\\" is just nasty. \\n\\nIf you're at the mall and in the mood for something better than normal mall food, and also don't want to sit down at the Claim Jumper or the RAM, Noodles & Co is worth checking out.

Bottom line the marriage of menu offerings, wine list, and and associated prices are right on point. You can share a salad, pizza, a bottle of wine and go home with leftovers for well under $100. Also you are never going to get looked at sideways if you want to share! \\n\\nThey don't take reservations and due to the location's size there is often a wait (so my advice don't arrive hungry) however, you are on Charles Street which is adorned with cute shops galore and places to grab a pre-dinner drink.

I was very excited and the reviews I've read bolstered my confidence. I was ready for a unique meal featuring local ingredients.\\n\\nThe restaurant was quiet and intimate - though pretty empty for a Saturday night at 9. We were seated and our water was filled. That was the extent of service for the first ten minutes (I was a waiter, I clocked it). We looked around the room trying to figure out the decor choices. A barnstar? Fake candles? Egregiously uncomfortable chairs? Mere oddities in light of what should be a delicious meal, right?\\n\\nWe were brought two bread rolls a piece - lovely, someone noticed we're here. Stale and flavorless. Perhaps this was to highlight the butter. I have no respect for a place that serves bad bread. ESPECIALLY one with French leanings. It's so, so easy. \\n\\nOur waitress finally arrived and inquired about drinks. I picked a bottle that was then decanted and ended up the highlight of the evening. \\n\\nBefore our appetizers were brought out, we were presented with two small bowls of a creamed corn soup with caramel popcorn. Bad start. Flavorless soup and soggy corn...just a weird combination. We were confused but excited for the appetizers - a citrus trout tartare and a fried egg risotto with snails and mushrooms.\\n\\nThe presentation of these dishes was outstanding - truly beautiful with colorful spring flowers dancing on our plate. Then we both took bites. The tartare was served with what could only be described as Red Lobster popcorn fish bites and the overall flavor was...totally non-present. The fried egg tasted as though the snails were killed with Salts and the whole dish was like eating salted lead. This is not summer menu fare, so why is it on the menu?\\n\\nThoroughly disappointed at this point -- with no one to tell. Our waitress had disappeared and the bus boy had no mind to inquire why our plates were untouched. Back to the wine, pray for mind-blowing duck. \\n\\nOur duck was presented then carved in front of us. The skin was crispy and sweet, but the meat was under whelming and a bit dry. It was served with a broiled pear, which was nice, but to the people raving about the stuffing - you are insane. It was soggy chunks of plain bread and further detracted from the meal. Turnips and carrots continued to weigh it down. Again, how is this summer fare? \\n\\nWe stopped eating and a puzzled busser asked if he could clear the table. Yes.\\n\\nWhen our waitress returned, I explained that we were to this point terribly disappointed with our meal and would forego dessert (something she would have learned after our first bite had she been around) and she offered to bring the chef out.

I explain to the chef that I had such high hopes for this special occasion and now my girlfriend's birthday was essentially ruined. The appetizers we both bland and over-salted. (He explains people have raved about the egg.) He is holding back a smirk the entire time, clearly too accomplished as a chef and owner to have his meal called into question. He explains that I should not have eaten it if I did not like it (was he checking the busboy upon return?). I told him we did not eat the appetizers and no one asked if we were enjoying it. He offers nothing but \\"I'm sorry it was not to your taste.\\" which is a pompous chef's way of saying, \\"I'm sorry you don't have fine taste.\\" He looked at me like I was a kid trying to get a free meal to impress his girlfriend. He is wrong.\\n\\nBoth my girlfriend and I have been fortunate to dine at 3-Star Michelin restaurants in France and hole-in-the-wall burger joint gems. We know good food and good service.

When we entered the parking lot (which was vastly empty for a sunday afternoon.) made me a little suspicious, which by the way is just the beginning of the story my friends.  Join me on our little tour of horror!  \\n\\nThe ambience was well old and dusty, and a little (way too little) dark.  Apparently the a/c was not working well either since there were fans everywhere blowing their little hearts out.  The music they had being piped in was stuck in a loop.  It only played three songs while were were there.  OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN......\\n\\nNow, we all had different orders, as you would expect of course. I ordered the veal saltimboca with lemon/butter sage sauce.  My wife ordered the eggplant parmasean, and grandma Sallie ordered the fettucini with crawfish, and of course Grandpa ordered the seafood plate.  \\n\\nNow grandma and grandpa's plates looked well, and they did not offer any complaints at the time of eating (though grandpa does not complain about peoples food.) \\n\\nMy veal came out on a plate, that when the waiter placed it in front of me looked more like a soup with something flat and white in the middle of the plate./  The veggies that were supposed to be served with the dish were on a separate plate. (guess they figured that if they put in on the plate it would be a soup.  the sauce was so runny.  Not to mention that it was SUPPOSED to be a \\"lemon, butter, and mushroom sauce with sage.\\"  Well, if there was any butter in it, it must have evaporated, and in place of lemon I got baslamic vinegar.  I am sorry, but the lemon butter sauce over saltimboca should be creamy, not to thick, and definately not SOUPY either.  Never should baslamic vinegar be used in place of lemon.   It just does not turn out right.  If that was not bad enough, the veal was tough as shoe leather and drier then the gobi desert. Not good eats. \\n\\nMy wife's eggplant parmasean was even worse.  If you order a parmasea dish, it should never be swimming on sauce... Why do you ask?  We it simple, it turns the breading into enedible MUSH.   Which is was happened to my wife's dish.  That and we soon discovered upon cutting into the eggplant that it was 98% breading. the so called eggplant looked like it was shaved into micro slices.  I mean come on man, really... Skimping on EGGPLANT. I can see it in the way of VEAL or something more expensive, but not eggplant. \\n\\nThe one saving grace of the dinner last night was the fact that the marinara sauce was REALLY good.  I mean it tasted freshly made, no bitter or acidic bite like what you get with canned sauce or canned tomatoes. It was very very good, and had absolutely no complaints there. \\n\\nThe service from our waiter was quite nice, and prompt.  We had no complaints there either.  This place would have gotten a 1 star review, but the good service we received and the fact that the house marinara sauce was really good I had to give it 2 stars.

Other patrons were arriving at the bar after us but being served while we were blatantly ignored. After we finished our first round of drinks we tried every attempt to show that we were ready to order(ie.putting down our menus, putting our menus away, attempting to make eye contact, asking kindly, etc.) but we were continuously ignored and others were helped ahead of us. Finally everyone at the bar had finished their meals (the very same meals that they didn't even have yet during this whole waiting period). \\nI had already commented to my boyfriend that I thought the bartender seemed either drunk or high. He was acting very loud, rambunctious and out of character. After being ignored for this amount of time we began questioning what exactly was going on. Because everyone else was being served during this time we felt we were possibly being blatently ignored,  which confused us. To make one final attempt to get their attention my boyfriend asked in a more direct way if we could please get some service. Everything in the universe came to a halt. The bartender stopped spun around, stared my boyfriend down in a way that exuded intimidation. He then responded that he would get to us \\"as soon as he could\\". That was BS. He then told us how busy it was. That was BS as well. We were sitting at the tiny bar  in Stoneham, and there were empty seats when we arrived. While we waited everyone finished their dinner, had their leftovers wrapped up, waited for and then paid their bills. There were no patrons waiting for seats at the bar. That's how \\"busy\\" it was.  So Mike from that point, took everything up about 15 notches. It was quite clear(not only to us) that he was intentionally slamming things around.  He also extremely loudly and repeatedly thanked all the guests that were paying their bills \\"FOR THEIR PATIENCE ON SUCH A BUSY NIGHT\\"!! He's staring my boyfriend in the face while \\"thanking\\" the others. \\nThis was just too much for me. We just wanted to come out for a nice low key dinner. But I could see that wasn't going to happen with Mike. We decided that we were not going to order food from him.\\n I'm not quite sure what happened that night. I was a regular customer of the Ninety Nine Restaurants since my Nana would take us as kids. \\nI've worked in the restaurant service industry and understand how tough it can be. I always tip 20% and usually tipped more like 23-25% because it's important for me to take care of the people that take care of me. I was practically in tears leaving that night. \\nI stopped and discussed my experience with the bar manager. He was kind, but all he did was ask me to do him a \\"favor\\" and \\"come back again\\". Needless to say we left starving. Next day I am still so upset so I reach out to human resources. The manager called me and listened to experience was. He was kind enough to apologize and offered to send a gift card along to try to mend the situation. That was nice and all,  but he sent a gift card for $25. Honestly, $25 will get my boyfriend and I one drink each plus a tip. Is that a joke? For us, that felt a like a smack in the face. I did not feel that my complaint was taken seriously. $25 certainly won't make up for the awful, infuriating, rude, ignorant, possibly intoxicated, seemingly racist bartender, Mike"},{"name":"Weeyums Philly Style","address":"777 Oak St SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place kind of reminds me of the varsity.

It is that bad and the corporation should be ashamed that is even exist.

While I wait for my laundry, I head into the Village for one of their bargain breakfasts that will take you back to 1970 -- especially the coffee, which is totally retro (meaning you won't think you are at Starbucks).   I like my eggs sunny side up, so the yolks can run onto the hashbrowns and sausage, and be sopped by by the toast.  You are free to follow your own preferences.\\n\\nFor lunch, I would recommend my favorite -- the Souvlaki on pita, with lettuce, onion, tomato and feta.

Unfortunately there's much more to a restaurant experience than the food and the experience we had tonight was a two-star disappointment (and if the food wasn't so decent it would be one.) \\nFor starters, the room we were seated in felt at least 15 degrees warmer than the rest of the restaurant. Next, the benches at our table had zero padding so the whole night was spent shifting uncomfortably in our seats. While I greatly appreciate the effort of decorating for Halloween, the hanging ghost that makes annoying ghoul sounds every four minutes should not be turned on during dining hours, even in the bar. Finally, the Lobster Mac and Cheese was extremely oily, the pulled pork nachos were drenched in (although delicious BBQ) entirely too much BBQ sauce, the prime rib was fatty beyond enjoyment, the cod sandwich was soggy and the pumpkin beer tasted rotten. \\n\\nThese unattractive aspects of our meal pale in comparison to the service we received tonight. Maybe being from a customer service background, I'm extremely biased because I know it's not difficult to do your job with a smile and show a little urgency. Our waiter leisurely stopped by our table about every half hour. When he did, he seemed to only check in with one end of our very long table (15 people to be exact) at a time. He didn't proactively refill any beverages for us, not even waters. We had to ask for the check twice. If that wasn't bad enough, upon exiting the restaurant, we passed by three hostesses who were too engrossed in a conversation to tell any one of the 15 of us thank you or have a good night.

Pangaea is the first real dance club that we have found in Austin since we have moved here from Chicago. The music was good, the crowd was fun and friendly, and it really came to life after 11pm right up to closing. \\n\\nMost clubs that we have visited in Austin are nothing more than bars with worn out wooden floors, and crumby seating and poor music. At Pangaea the ladies wore skirts and high heeled shoes (yeah!) and the men realized that there are in fact shirts made that actually have buttons and collars on them, and shoes that are made for going out and not just running.  It was refreshing to find a real club with people dancing, having fun, and not just a cheap bar full of people just getting drunk.\\n\\nThe layout of the club was inviting with the bottle service area set up in rows down the middle of the club, and not in a separate VIP area.  Drinks were high priced for Austin, but still cheaper than found in major metro areas around the country, plus there was no cover. The club could do better by loosing the animal heads, and the stockade walls and redesign the motif to be modern and elegant (but that may be too much for Austin).\\n\\nWhile Pangaea does not rival the clubs that you will find in Chicago or NY, it is certainly a step in the right direction to turning Austin into a city.

Judging by our dinner selections, the starters and small plates are the real stand-outs: like delicious mini crab cakes, a superb curry soup, and a watermelon salad with feta, mint, and olives -- an amazing combination that was fresh and light.

If the food is actually good, you don't have to mask it with unnecessary sauces and flavoring to make it taste better. They also offer different portion sizes, but even the original was not enough for me, or maybe it was because I had trouble putting this bowl of nasty mush in my mouth. Well, I am a big fan of buffalo wings, so I ordered their buffalo chicken burrito bowl. I seriously wanted to throw up what I ate back in the bowl.\\n\\nOk, maybe my expectations were too high, because I expected it to be somewhat similar to Chipotle or what buffalo wings taste like. It was no where near Chipotle or buffalo wings. There was too much sauce on my burrito bowl that it turned the rice into a pile of mush.

Christopher's and The Flying Biscuit don't quite cut it for me. I'm not much one for breakfast foods but every once in a while I run across a little shop that just takes me away. A few months ago I ventured out of my comfort zone to a place called Le Petit Marche. Located in a very obscure area of town I had noted it was one of the most relaxed, European-style cafes I had been to in a while. When I first walked into Bab's it had a similar feel to it, brick walls with an eclectic d√©cor hanging on the walls. It's a bit difficult to find as their location is underneath a Health and Wellness house but look out for a red awning with a white Bab's stamped to the front.\\n\\n As I walked in I was greeted with a cheerful \\"I'll be right with you\\" from the do-it-all host and server. Charming and hilariously over the top, this man made the restaurant, his name as I found out later, is Randy. Randy, oh Randy... what do I say about this man who made my dining experience THAT much better. I'm pretty sure he's gay. Hell, it's on Juniper St. in the heart of Midtown. I expected to walk in and have a relaxing breakfast with my friend but alas that is not so when you have a bombshell waiter. He advised us for food, emphasizing on the time old tradition of trying new things and \\"living dangerously.\\" He convinced, perhaps even pushed me and my friend to have what he called \\"Sake Mary\\" with a dash of Sriracha. It's essentially a Bloody Mary with Sake, it's a excellent invention, and the recommendation for a dash of Sriracha won me over instantly.\\n\\n As for the food it was lovely. I settled for a daily special, a Cuban wrap grilled panini style with sweet potato fries. The pork cuts were a bit chewy but overall the Cuban was a success, with a nice sweet hint to balance out the salty ham and briny pickle I devoured the first half happily. The sweet potato fries were something else. I had grown accustomed to the idea of overly sweet, sweet potato fries but these fries came served with a tangy honey mustard and curry dipping sauce that was absolutely divine. It complimented the soft and subtly sweet fries. \\n\\nOverall, a wildly different and kookier experience than I had expected. A sake-mary down, filled with good food I left Bab's smiling having a different eclectic yet all together relaxing morning.

We were concerned that not choosing a particular dish would hurt the chef's feelings (he's standing RIGHT THERE!) but were assured this isn't a problem.  In the first place we chose nearly everything.  All the dishes were wonderful without exception.\\n\\nThe only negative (and I report this often with today's restaurants) is that the restaurant is all hard surfaces and when all 50 patrons are dining, really noisy.  It all adds to the excitement.  Service though unusual was excellent as were the limited wine and beer choices.  The menu is constantly changing but I'm sure it will always be tasty.\\n\\nWe'll return often with semi-foodie friends to enjoy the food and the clever way in which it's served.  Oh, and save room for Kevin's banana pudding.

The soup tasted like it had been made earlier in the week.  I ordered a medium rare steak.  When it came it was cut so thinly that there was no possible way to make it medium rare.  I looked at her steak, it was much thicker and she didn't say anything, so not wanting to ruin the dinner, I didn't say anything.  The tastiest thing on the plate was the potatoes, the rest was bland and boring.  My luck - I invited my friend, so I ended up paying over $50 for food that I did not enjoy.

They gladly took a picture for us and gave us an extra serving of tator tots to go, since they prematurely took the tots that were still on the table.\\n\\nThe food was decent-to-good. Bread was sort of below average. Just cold, hard bread, nothing special. Butter was just standard butter.\\n\\nFor entrees, most of the table had the same thing - the 100 day dry aged ribeye, which is their signature item. However, the chef tends to overcook the steak by one temperature. If you want a true medium, order a medium rare. Likewise, if you want a medium rare, order a rare. I ordered a medium and over half of the steak was grey with not a hint of pink. Still tasted good though (no dry aged ribeye will taste bad, regardless of how you cook it).\\n\\nFor sides, we ordered the tater tots, the asparagus, wild mushrooms, and lobster mac and cheese. The tater tots were amazing, perfectly battered, and had just the right hint of truffle oil. The asparagus, mushrooms, and lobster mac were nothing special. The lobster mac and cheese is the priciest, but honestly just tastes like regular mac and cheese and has very little lobster in it.\\n\\nConclusion: come here for the steak (the sides are meh) and order a temperature one level more rare than you normally would."},{"name":"Black Rooster Taqueria","address":"1323 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Great take on Mexican food, not typical but definitely fresh and that's what I enjoy.

With 8 people in a party you sometimes encounter issues with paying, food delivery, service, etc. Not here. This place is made for crowds, or just 2, and can handle pretty much anything.\\n\\nThe \\"salad\\" bar. This is by far one of the best I've ever had. There wasn't a lot in the way of a salad bar like you may think, it was really more of an antipasti/side bar. Meats, cheese, salads, rice, beans, soup, potatoes, this thing had it all. I could have just eaten that all night and been happy.\\n\\nThe sides. I never tried the mashed potatoes because I considered it a waste of stomach space, but those who did enjoyed them. The polenta fries were probably the best I've ever had and the carmelized bananas were amazing.\\n\\nI was also probably the happies with the Pao de Quejo (I have no idea how to spell that properly) since I haven't had any since I was in Brazil. Holy moly, did these hit the spot.\\n\\nThe star of the show: the meat. Now, I'll preface this by saying I'm not a huge steak person. The ribs were by far my favorite thing we got, and because it was dining month I didn't get to try filet mignon or another of the meats. What I did try was good, and I enjoyed it, but for me, steak is steak. This was salty, delicious goodness.\\n\\nWhile I wanted desperately to try the delicious chocolate thing I saw people eating, by the end of the meal I was ready to explode. I'm sure another bite would have done me in. \\n\\nThis is not a fancy steak house. This is a south american steak house which is very different from what Americans are used to. You are paying for quantity as well as quality and you're paying for the whole experience. The meat is well above average, but not as good as a single $60 steak at a place like Ruth's Chris. \\n\\nIf what you want is good meat, variety and sides, then this is place to go."},{"name":"Stouthaus Coffee Pub","address":"4715 S Lamar Blvd, Ste 102","city":"Sunset Valley","stars":"4.5","text":"I always have such a great experience when I stop in.

The french fries were cold and old. I sent them back and the server returned moments later with more cold, old fries. Come ON, Victoria Station! You can't do good FRIES? The salad bar of my childhood was still there and I filled up on salad. The bread was stale and cheap (of course), and the coffee tasteless sludge.

I was greeted with a smile by a friendly guy with a nice head of white hair. \\nWe were gladly seated even though all of my party had not yet arrived. Our server didn't seem happy to be working at all. She never smiled and wasn't very welcoming/friendly so I asked her was everything ok. She explained that she wasn't having a good day and was cranky, which coming from 13 years in the service industry I totally understand. But you can't let personal feelings effect your job to the point you make others feel unwelcome. So i reassured her that I understood and we were a group of service industry individuals and she seemed to lighten up. The brunch menu changes weekly and is kind of limited but with very good/healthy choices. I had the Greek omelette minus the olives w added roasted tomato and a side of fruit & potatoes which was delish! I think we tried the entire menu between the 10 of us and everyone was happy with their meals. I also tried the Bellini which was a basic Bellini made on the rocks w a couple of frozen peaches.  Atlanta has bottomless mimosa/Bellini specials all over the city for an average of $15. A $9 Bellini is definitely over priced. The owner introduced himself (Rob I think)and had a great personality and graciously closed out our tabs individually for us. I don't think an auto gratuity for larger party was added.

The lithe duo splitting the tag-team duties (Tammy serving up front, and heir-to-the-throne Jennie cooking in the back) were unfailingly courteous, inquisitive of their customers, and display a love of their craft and (presumably?) unique Swiss-Hawaiian fusion history, as well as their common destiny as tied together in this robust little business. How one can behold their story, and wish them anything other than smashing success, I can't even begin to fathom.\\n\\n\\nOn the other hand, I had a bit more trouble bringing to literal terms the purported and highly celebrated Swiss- Hawaiian bloodline of this menu. The fare is unmistakably Central European in ancestry, whatwith their schnitzels und das gh√∂ul√§sh und their br√§twursts √ºnd Der F√∂nd√ºe S√ºppez und their R√∂sti ja ja. There was nothing in the mix that we disliked, even as we wondered why the hashbrowns (Rosti) was featured so prominently with nearly every entree. I spent a few days in Switzerland whilst tramping around Europe in the late 90s, but have no recollection of the fare, let alone claim any expert familiarity with their foodstuffs. \\n\\n\\nNonetheless. The execution of the menu items @ CH (as opposed to C&H? Maybe this is the secret tie to Hawaiian Paradise---that, as well as Jennie's Legendary wizard chef and father, Herr Wyss) evinced admiration and bespoke competence and industry. The damnable thing of it was, we happen to eat @ CH when they were firmly ensconced as Portland Yelp's #2 hot spot. #2! Yes, their food was good @ CH, maybe even pretty great, yes the service was absolutely gracious and lovely. But these days in Portland, there is an almost infinite number of quirky, charming, wickedly delicious little bistros and shoppes and food carts and so many amalgamations and fusion scenarios it makes the head spin. \\n\\n\\nIt seems to me that the lofty, rarified air characterizing Top Ten eatery airspace belongs to places most anyone can agree on, with very little controversy---- this would be the likes of Andina, and Screen Door. And Tasty/Toro Bravo--- and so on. Places that have reigned at/near the top for years. Add to that your quirky places that \\"shouldn't\\" rule the roost, but are just so good at what they do, you can't possibly begrudge them their success: think PBJs, Waffle Window, here I'd include the frequent heavyweight champ but oft-MIA Built to Grill.\\n\\n\\nEven if we break it down the \\"best of its class\\", I  have to give the nod to T√°bor when it comes to schnitzels (pork or chicken) and ghoulash; and Pr√∂st and Otto's when it comes to the brats, although CHs are big and juicy and pretty dang tasty. 4 stars shouldn't be taken as a slight-- some of these other eateries also got 4 stars, overall, from this Yeep--- and hey, what do I know, anyways?\\n\\nBottom line as always: Would I spend money again @ Cafe Hibiscus? I most certainly would, with pleasure, and well before I darkened the doorway of many other pretenders and contenders, again (\\"cough cough Meriwether's cough cough\\")."},{"name":"Babs","address":"814 Juniper St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Such a great spot.

I've been probably a handful of times and have never had a bad meal.  The burgers are amazing!  Just tonight I stopped in for a Christmas shopping pit stop and got the Jalape√±o Burger with spicy fries.\\n\\nThe burger's flavor was amazing! The jalape√±os are actually stuffed into the Angus beef.  That mixed with the two layers of Pepper Jack cheese, BBQ sauce, and the straw onions on their organic sesame brioche (buns) made for a absolutely delicious meal.\\n\\nI found that the spicy fries had a bit too salty of a taste for my liking.  They definitely weren't a good choice to accompany the burger I got.  However, my mother got the sweet potato fries with her Reuben sandwich (which she LOVED!) and they went perfectly with my burger.  So FYI, if you go with the Jalape√±o Burger, I would recommend the sweet potato fries as the side.\\n\\nWe also got an order of boneless buffalo tenders (with blue cheese) to start.  They were good, nothing too exciting but good.  If you're looking more for flavor then for heat, then you'll like these.  The buffalo sauce was tasty without overpowering your mouth.  Which I liked, cause I would've been really upset if my mouth was burning throughout my delicious burger.\\n\\nTonight was my mother's first time here.

No judgement here, but if you dine at the drive thru, shop at Walmart for your groceries and enjoy sweet-n-low in your coffee and margarine in your breads then you will certainly like the food. If you shop at the farmer's market or Whole Foods you will not care for their food since its of lower quality. Their menu says their waffles come with Maple Syrup..not so; its pancake syrup made from corn syrup; they didn't even have Maple Syrup. After looking around, we realized that most people were there for the $10 (now $11) bottomless drinks. Also, the place is as loud as a ball game (which didn't bother me but did my husband) and there is only 1 bathroom per sex so go b4 you must because you will be waiting in line for the toilet. On the positive, we had reservations and got seated right away even though it was very busy.

This couple also had me changing my original order after seeing theirs. The waitress staff were nice and brought out some very fluffy and tasty biscuits with preserves, uummm yummm. I had previously viewed the menu and had decided on a croissant sandwich with a side of potatoes and the bottomless Mimosa, but after viewing the chicken & waffles with blackberries, I ended up with that. My friend ordered the fish and grits and we shared our meals. I am not a fan of grits and didn't care for them much, but the catfish was very flaky and tasty.\\n\\nThe chicken & waffles rocked and was very fresh. We didn't get the bottomless Mimosa's because they don't start serving them until 12:30 (alcohol law)?! We could have ordered them later but were about finished dining when they were starting to serve them. I ordered an herbal mint tea and my friend had coffee. By noon Parks Edge was packed to capacity and lots of eye candy for me:-))). Everyone seemed so upbeat on this beautiful Sun afternoon, that was a +.  The Mimosa's seemed to be on every table. \\n\\nThe decor is nice, clean and classy. The location is kinda hidden, but is in the Highlands and if you may recall its the old LUSH restaurant location. Its nice to know yet another fine establishment is housed there now. My guest and I said we would definitely return, and next time we shall have those Mimosa's !

Of course if your a student this is great but if you're a normal government employee it's too busy for a quick run for food. The food itself isn't bad cuts squarely in the middle of Chipotle/Qdoba and Torchy's and here in lies my problem. They have no where near the flavor of Torchy's but have more customizability than Chipotle. Everything taste fresh which is awesome but the food is lacking that little punch you get from Torchy's. So if you want great tacos go to Torchy's if you want a great burrito or bowl go here or Qdoba only difference is this place maybe slightly healthier.\\nSo probably the real difference here is the food had more of a South West flair instead of the oh so familiar Tex Mex flavors which may be the welcome change you need."},{"name":"Gourmet Garden","address":"1032 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The restaurant advertised \\"Dim Sum Brunch\\" and once we got into the restaurant we noticed a lot of the tables haven't been cleaned.

This hostess was everywhere...but the hostess stand. Power to her though--she was cleaning tables, running food, etc. \\n\\nFood. DISSAPOINTING. \\nThe \\"fresh\\" oysters were dried out. \\nThe she-crab soup was tasty, but it would have been nice to have a WARM bowl of soup. \\nI should have skipped my \\"grilled\\" crab leg entree. Everything was pretty much burnt. \\nThe pecan-crusted grouper special my boyfriend had, bland.  \\nAnd my pet peeve, when my food is not coursed-out. We received our appetizers and entrees within a minute of each other. Wtf!!!!\\n\\nAnd lastly, the service. I understand that it was a busy night.

I was in town for my birthday weekend from St. Louis and learned about this place from Yelp. I wasn't exactly sure what to expect from Gunshow but I knew from the reviews that this place is a must for a foodie while in ATL, and that's indeed what Gunshow is.\\n\\nThe concept of Gunshow is that you are seated at a communal table and are given a menu. The menu is changed every week (I believe. It could be nightly) and each item is made by a different chef who makes two small dishes each night. That chef then comes to you with one of their dishes for you to decide yay or nay. If you say yes, then they give you that fresh, gourmet plated meal. If you say no, then they put an \\"X\\" on the menu by that dish and keep it moving. I felt bad saying no to the chefs because I know they put a lot of thought and attention into their dishes, however it's expected that you won't order everything on the menu. A waiter also comes around checking on you and relaying messages to the chefs on your behalf, if you want seconds or are ready for dessert, etc. Also, a mixologist comes around to you to take your cocktail order and explains any of the drinks on the menu.\\n\\nI made my reservation in advance, which I can't stress enough. MAKE A RESERVATION! I was seated by two delightful women who were visiting from Virginia. We all engaged in conversation and gushed about the items on the menu. I ordered smoked octopus (delicious and very unique), fried soft shell crab (I think it's safe to say that it was the best soft shell crab I've ever eaten, granted I don't have that often being from the midwest), delicious chicken won tons, pork belly (really good and flavorful), and the standard baked banana pudding for dessert (so filling and thick it's great to share). I also had a really good, frothy pineapple-fruity rum cocktail which was fun and good.\\n\\nA good way to describe Gunshow is that it's a unique, creative American take on dim sum. I really enjoyed the experience and it was not like any restaurant that I've ever been to. I like that the menu changes so every time you go, you'll have a different experience, and nothing will get old. The price tag on an experience here is no cheap feat but I think the way to combat that is to come with a friend or two to share the dishes, and the tab.

We came after dinner and were looking for some good wine and a snack.  The wine was fine, the ambiance was good, but the snack was a bit yuck.

Another fail, but not as bad as the first time.

Wine list has changed, the cheapest red being a rather nice Malbec for $9. The menu has totally changed, it now is the typical, expensive a la carte steakhouse.

Though the curry was mainly gravy, I ate whatever lamb I could manage to get out of there.

After a couple of months, yesterday we returned to Temple Bar. As always, we ordered the tuna tartar and the mussels. Once they arrived, they appeared to be different (no seaweed salad in the tuna tartar and no chorizo in the mussels). The waitress told us that the chef had changed and he brought some amendments to the menu. But a few minutes after, we noticed that not only the chef may have changed, but also the quality of the ingredients they are using.\\n\\nFirst, the tuna tartar does not come anymore with real pieces of avocado mixed with the tuna. Instead, they are using the faked avocado puree that you usually find in junk food places. Believe it or not! Digging deeper in faked ingredients, the tuna is now mixed with lime juice, but not genuine lime. The \\"chef\\" is using a preserved and processed lime juice that does not appear to be natural (shouldn't a lime taste at least a little bit acid?)\\n\\nThen, the mussels came with tons of tomato sauce, which tasted like the cheapest one you could buy in the supermarket.

I can't see myself making the trek to Nud Pob, but I'll give the benefit of the doubt that this could be due to delivery instead of having them prepare and combine the ingredients together and serve it in a bowl to you. I've tried the Tom Yum Noodle Sou; the soup was a little more sour than I like it, and I've tried the Chiang Mai Curry Noodle. I was really eager for the Curry Noodles because it's a rare find, but instead of spicy, I found the Curry noodles to be more on the sweet side which after downing half the bowl, the other half seemed too sweet.\\n\\nSo you may be wondering how the heck did Nud Pob get this 4.5 out of 5 if I have all these qualms with the noodles. It's because Nud Pob has BOMB RICE PLATES. Indonesian Fried Rice = definitely try once (you will probably will be getting it again and again after that). I've had the Kao Kah Moo - pork leg on top of rice, cilantro, Chinese broccoli served with a boiled egg - which by description alone had me hooked even though I tend to like spicy Thai food more - these sweet and savory pork leg hit the spot. The Chinese broccoli really takes the dish by the way, I wish there was more of it.

Both dishes could use a bit more sauce for flavor, otherwise I found that the meat was perfectly cooked, not hard and rubbery like many other places.\\n\\nThe little additions are what makes Flyin' Hawaiian stand out. The typical rice is covered with a sesame seed/seaweed topping that I was a bit leery about at first, but ended up asking for more. The macaroni salad was not over powered by the mayonnaise, nor did it tip the scale completely flavorless. Instead it was just about darn near perfect. A small wedge of pineapple and a Sweet Hawaiian roll completed the meal, making me wonder where I was going to put everything. The amount of food was a serious deterrent. \\n\\nBut somehow, I managed to clean the plate.

I got my little box and opened up to see two full-meal sized tacos staring back at me, with what looked to be a dinner salad on top of each one! The flavor of these things was incredible. Juices from the fish smothered with blackened seasoning, the delicious cole slaw, veggies, and cilantro-ranch dressing all came together to make a mouth watering combination.

Price wise, each bao is between 3-4 dollars, which is a huge red flag since steamed buns normally sell for 1-2 dollars, max. \\n2. These baos are smaller than your average steamed bun. When you eat it, there's way too much dough and the filling is extremely minimal (see reviews from other people who have pictures). The small portion won't get you full for lunch unless you plan on spending 20 dollars. You're definitely not getting your money's worth. \\n3.  Also as others mentioned, the baos are not steaming hot or warm, but rather cold. They weren't kept in a heat lamp (or as is usual in restaurants, on a steamer) but simply out on the table behind them. As a former cook, this probably also violates health regs.\\n\\nIn summary, but for that price and for that quality, never again. If Tom cares about his bakery, he needs to make major adjustments.

But to rate just the pizza is to miss that they serve more than the best  NY pizza in town. \\n\\nThe heroes  (subs, grinders, whateva') are the best I've had outside the northeast.  I prefer the sausage parm but the meatballs are great too and you can even get a combo sausage/meatball parm for the days when you don't have anything else to get done the rest of the day. Sausages rolls are a nice change of pace from pizza too.\\n\\nAn Italian ice at the end brings back great childhood memories of hanging around the neighborhood pizzeria with sticky ice melting down my arm.

We arrived in Roslindale Village around 9:50 am and the center was dead except for the line ~10 people deep outside of Redd's. I had read on Yelp that this was a popular brunch spot but I was not expecting a line before opening at a place in Roslindale. It wasn't until 10:15 am that the restaurant flung open the doors to let the hangry crowd pour in. There was an inside and outside eating area, both decorated with a retro-hip vision in mind. My first words upon sitting down was, \\"This is a Yelper's dream.\\" My boyfriend and I had skimmed the menu on the website before coming here and knew we were going to order a bunch of things to share. We ended up getting:\\n\\n- Sticky bun: We were going to order this last as a dessert but since we were hungry and saw that tables around us received this as soon as they ordered it, we ditched our original plan and got this first. Though they were supposedly baked the morning of, the sticky bun was served cold. The bun could have been a little softer but I really enjoyed the toffee flavor on this. I would highly recommend. \\n- Hush puppies: I'm not a fan of hush puppies but we wanted to order this because of the bacon onion jam that came with it. I'd give this appetizer 1 star. At Redd's, they decided to use corn bread for the hush puppies. Though a good idea, the hush puppies were very burnt and dry. The onion bacon jam was not a jam but just a mix of bacon and onion pieces mixed together. The combination of the two ended up being overly salty. \\n- There's No Basement in the Alamo!: One of the more unique benedict options. Instead of using bread, the poached egg and meat was stacked on top a large onion ring. I love onion rings so I thought this was a great idea. My boyfriend had opted for the grits instead of the home fries which was a mistake because we each ended up taking only one bite out of the grits. Overall, this was a good and innovated way to make an eggs benedict. \\n- Pork hash: 9 out of 10 times when I go out to brunch, I get some type of hash. I loved this interpretation of the dish especially the addition of beets and asparagus. The pork in this dish was prepared 3 ways: pulled pork, 1 small slice of sausage, and 1 small scoop of p√¢t√©. The pulled pork was good and if it were up to me, the only way the meat should have been served in this dish. The sausage was a light gray/pink color. Not appetizing to look at but it tasted alright. That being said, one bite was enough for me. Even though I'm Vietnamese and we use a lot of p√¢t√© in our sandwiches, I don't like it. This p√¢t√© tasted more like mushed up pulled pork so I didn't mind it too much. This was my favorite dish here but I was disappointed by the meat to potatoes ratio. \\n- Waffle torta sandwhich: fried chicken cutlet, cheese, beans, avocado and aji salsa all between two waffles. Sounds like all the makings of a perfect sandwich right? Even with so many ingredients, this dish was incredibly bland and was just mush between my hands. The worst thing we ordered that morning. \\n- Back porch punch: Listed at $4 a cup, I did not expect this to be alcoholic but it was and it was strong. Delicious and refreshing especially in the summertime. \\n\\n3/5 stars for the mediocre experience. Even so, I plan on coming back for brunch and would recommend it to others. My boyfriend and I said that we would just order differently next time because Redd's is definitely onto something."},{"name":"Ronin Sushi","address":"6100 Parkcenter Cir","city":"Dublin","stars":"4","text":"Small place with good Sushi.

Well, when I stopped by around lunchtime a few days ago, I remembered seeing one of the faces from my previous visit; so, nothing new there! They still performed the latte art presentation; however, the barista seemed to struggle to bring the perfect look in the final cup. I saw the cracked bubble on the top of my latte. For me, an espresso based drink is more for the taste; and if you are not really an expert in latte art, then just skip this part and just serve the good drink. \\n\\nI also tried their soup of the day: Taste point-not bad; Price point-$4.50 for a very small bowl with a couple of tiny pieces of bread. It was a little bit pricey for such an okay taste; but again, this is Lake Oswego and it is okay to overcharge the customers in Lake Oswego. For some reason, new merchants in this town seem to assume that we will keep coming regardless. LOL...it's not for me though. I will pay the higher price for great tasting stuff; and, I am willing to travel a longer distance for the better soup/sandwich as well as a better latte. Sorry folks, I am not impressed by your new management. I love the old folks, who were operating this place a few years ago before this new management took over.

Now to the good stuff.\\n\\nOur waiter explained our wine choices to us and even let us try both whites so we knew what we were dealing with as they were not your typical varietals.

We were allowed to choose from either the appetizer or light bites menu, so we went with the coconut mussels for our app.  They brought out a bowl of large mussels in a creamy coconut sauce that had a bit of a kick.  It was delicious.\\n\\nNext up salads - I kind of wondered if they'd just give us side salads as part of the SM, but nope, we were allowed to choose from any of them.  I had the nicoise, which was really good and my husband had the caesar.  I was getting pretty full at this point.

My party ordered a multi-course feast so we got to taste a bit of everything.  The lentil soup was quite delightful as it went down with the bite of chili.  The appetizer however was uncongenial to my palate.  In essence it tasted like a giant donut filled with meat; not my thing.  The entrees ultimately concluded in a 50/50 split.  The mushroom chicken dish was quite delectable; just enough mushroom flavor but none too overwhelming.  The chicken covered in thick apricot glaze however, made both my tongue and stomach shudder.  A goat dish was also thrown into the mix, but I do not *do* goat, so alas, I cannot help you there.\\n\\nIf you've never had moroccan food before, then by all means go ahead and give it a whirl.

The service was excellent, from the bartender to the kid who refilled my water glass and iced tea, the bus-boy and my fantastic waitress, Ryan (who is a woman).\\n\\nTrying to decide what sounded best from the menu, which was primarily salads and sandwiches..but not your basic deli type sandwiches..to cheese and veggie plates was difficult.\\n\\nI chose the 'Tasting Menu' and was told it was smaller portions of their dishes.  A different menu each day, depending of what the chef finds fresh at the markets, by the way.  The tasting menu was a flat $20., quite a bit more than I would usually pay for lunch, however the entire experience was well worth it.\\n\\nMy meal began with a wonderful roasted corn bisque soup, which had a dollop of ricotta cheese and chives on top.  I'm a cook and, honestly tried to duplicate the soup for my dinner tonight without success though I got close.  I think there is a touch of fennel in it..in any case, it's delightfully rich and creamy as a good bisque should be.  It was served with a lovely warm roll and whipped butter.\\n\\nThe entree' was duck comfit on a bed of butternut squash, both pureed and grilled, a schmeer of a coffee drizzle on the side was an interesting taste and roasted pumpkin seeds and cranberry relish completed the dish.  It was a large thigh of duck, my favorite part of poultry and the dark meat was rich and moist.  The squash was delicate and though both the puree and cubed grilled that slightly different flavors, they complimented each other and the duck.  Cranberry relish was a perfect addition.\\n\\nI couldn't do justice to the baked apple dessert as I was full by the time I finished the duck.

Not overpowering on the heat, but enough to know you're not eating plain ole chicken soup.  Kelly (the waitress) was awesome.  Friendly, helpful and always making sure we were taken care of, and when I wanted the other TV changed to the 2nd Hockey game, she gladly made the change for me.  Kelly knew the menu from food to beer and was spectacular... Give that girl a raise I say:-)  Unfortunately, her shift ended before the Hockey game did and so I made sure to close out so that I could give her a good tip.\\n\\nNow as for the 2nd waitress that took over (name starts with an H and ends in ether)... BOOO... Snarky attitude, and kind of off putting when it comes to service.  One of my friends showed up a little later and ordered some food.  When the food came out, he asked for another little side plate to put condiments on and she looked at him like he had the plague then told him that they don't like giving out side plates, b/c they run out of those a lot... Really?  I've never had a restaurant/bar say no to something so simple... I have to admit, it went from awesome service to horrible service in a flash.  Service also became ultra slow as well.  On top of that in the middle of the game I noticed the channel changed on the TV playing the Capitals Rangers game and asked her who changed it and if someone else requested to change it.  She stated, \\"No, I changed it\\"... What?  Seriously?  The NBA game was on the giant TV and she changed the small TV on the wall to the NBA game that was playing already on the giant TV right next to it?... Come on!!! So she did change it back...

So wonderfully reviewed, yet constantly overrated. \\n\\nA few years ago I remember being told this was THE best breakfast spot in Atlanta.  I mean people REALLY hyped it up, especially the Yelpers. Well, I really REALLY wanted to love it just like everyone else, I was hyping it up to my boyfriend at the time and everything and was SUPER excited to go here. But GEEZ was I disappointed in that first  Flying Biscuit Meal. Flavorless pancakes, dry biscuit, and spicy jam???! Are you kiddin' me with this jam though, I looove the taste of sweet strawberry jam on my biscuit, so the spicy/hot taste of this was just NOT good. \\n\\nSince then I've gone back a few times. Why? Well because it's close and I keep hoping that one day it'll live up to the hype. But it doesn't-- despite the LONG line it has everyone weekend. \\n\\nMore than anything the tastes of the food at this location is clearly meant for those who are natural food store types, that are used to their favorite foods lacking flavor.

Okay, well, not always consistently, but all my juices are organic, I have whole pantry shelf full of teas, I always get the high-fiber grain version of any wheat/bread/carb type food, shoot even my sweets are natural and organic. Point is I can see it from both sides, and if you aren't used to eating grainy/organic/ \\"substitute this for that\\" type food then steer clear of this Flying Biscuit. Honestly, the healthy meals at iHop are better-- yea I said it. lol. Okay, I won't compare them to a chain, but this isn't the best brunch spot in Atlanta, there are many more that are better. \\n\\nAll that said, I went to the one in Buckhead for brunch one day, and sorta kinda loved it... weird, huh?

They just opened, so it's understandable that they have a few kinks to work out.\\n\\nBefore walking in, we were told it is \\"fresh American food.\\" I think they're confused about their brand identity. A lot of the items on the menu were Asian fusion, which is cool, but unexpected when the restaurant is touted as something else. They do have roast chicken, a burger, duck and steak on the menu, so maybe we just ordered the items that were Asian fusion.\\n\\nTHE FOOD:\\nWe got the cheese puff appetizer, the fried snapper and the miso grouper.\\nThe cheese puffs were awesome. The food took a long time to come out (surprising for how slow they were, but a kink that will surely be worked out the longer the restaurant is around ) so they were a lifesaver. Highly recommend.\\n\\nThe fried snapper- it is a whole fish. Be expecting to look into a fish face while you eat. The fish was tasty, but I was told the salad dressing was too exotic and that a starch would have made the dish better. I was thinking grilled or saut√©ed veggies including a squash would go well. I actually liked this meal best.\\n\\nThe grouper- it had a miso sauce and was served over rice, surrounded by grilled green onions. The presentation was beautiful. It was a bit salty for me, but that's to be expected with miso. I also feel like the grouper is a pretty meaty fish for the delicate miso flavor. Maybe a lighter/ thinner/ more buttery fish would have been better in this dish. The rice had big pieces of ginger in it, which was surprising. I could have just missed that on the menu. Even though the onions were pretty, I would have preferred something else green to eat with that meal.\\n\\nNext time, I would try the kimchee pork rice dish. \\n\\nBased on the name, the music, all of the bee hive looking decor, the mason jars with baby's breath on the tables, I feel like they're going for a hipster vibe. I wasn't a fan of the music.\\n\\nThe menus looked like a mistake, the print was too small for the page and was pretty hard to see. The lighting was also pretty harsh in some areas. When I think hipster watering hole with fresh fare, I want it to seem a little more romantic. I was also put off by the $40 price tag for an 8 oz steak. You could easily go to $80 per person with a salad, a steak and a couple of cocktails.\\n\\nI think this place could be great with some fine tuning. I kind of felt like the brand was all over the place, but the food was pretty tasty."},{"name":"Hai Phong Vietnamese Restaurant","address":"1242 Kingsway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I've been back a number of times since my original review and they have converted me into a fan.

While the location is in the heart of Midtown, this means parking is a pain. You can either do street parking which is limited to two hours and then you have to go recharge, or you can do valet/self-park in the lot adjacent for $5. I did the latter and was glad because your meal here will take you a while. The ambiance of the place is nice and can make for a good setting for groups or even date night. I would not really encourage kids here unless they are in their teens. Since it was my birthday and I had a group of 7 we were seated in one of their tables in the party area away from the rest of the restaurant. Our drinks were all good. We did some cheese starters which came out just fine. The process of the pot and the melting ingredients is a little interesting, at first at least. Our main course took a while to make an appearance. Apparently quick service is not their motto. Either that or they believe in realllllll relaxed dining! Entrees themselves were good but the process of heating the broth and then cooking the meat can take a while and unless you have a party where conversation is flowing, this might take its toll on the evening. And then dessert , which was just one pot, took longer than the entrees for no obvious reason. By this time, the novelty of the experience had worn out and we really need to move on. They were nice in that they got me a little birthday plate with a candle and some sweet treats but then came the tab and there was no easy way to do it. We had multiple rounds of clarification and card transactions before we could call it a night. It took us a good 3 hours to get done with our meal and half of that was just waiting for the next course even though we had placed our orders when the previous course arrived.

Beautiful plating but I was a little disappointed by the meager amount of prosciutto served; there was one small piece for each of us. The tomatoes were the largest things on the plate.

My Prime Dry Aged Ribeye was a little disappointing. The flavor wasn't for me and I usually love a dry aged ribeye but also my steak was cooked more medium than medium rare. The sauces we got helped. We got the Bearnaise, Lou Jean's BBQ, and Au Poivre. Of these 3, the Au Poivre was my least favorite. Was promised to be a little spicy but really was just bland. The sneak favorite was Lou Jean's BBQ. It is UNREAL - forget your traditional idea of a BBQ sauce - this is a light flavorful tangy steak sauce. Highly recommend.\\n\\nLooking for sides to pair with your steak? Look no further than Saut√©ed Spinach & Garlic and Whipped Potatoes - go for the larger portion of potatoes. They are so fluffy and you will mow through the smaller order sooner than you'd like to; I know we did.

Perfectly cooked, simple pan sauce, absolutely delicious.  \\n\\nOur other entree was sword fish  and was over salted, end of story.  \\n\\nThe appetizers were probably the low light: shrimp ceviche was essentially a few whole shrimp in a spicy marinade.  I can't handle spice but honestly there was no heat, no citrus and essentially no depth.  The old-bay saltines? had no hint of old bay-- I'm from Maryland so I have an uncanny ability to detect old bay.  The sorbet was interesting but didn't really belong.  The cured meats were, well a plate of cured meats.  Not the best I've had, not the worst.  \\n\\nFor dessert it was the hot date, which was a toffee pudding and really good. \\n\\nService was outstanding and the chef came out to say hi and thanks for coming. Our server was great and gave enough distance so that we could enjoy the meal but was attentive enough to make sure our drinks were never empty. My friend left her sweater and the staff were nice enough to call and let us know.\\n\\nI have to point out though that our server, like servers at ever new american restaurant it seems, felt it necessary to \\"walk us through the menu.\\"  I was surprised to learn that small plates were appetizers and large plates were entrees.  Seriously, is this necessary?   My friend and I had both had had a long day and we just wanted to eat-- thankfully we both had drinks in our respective hands at this point.  The funny thing is that the same friend and I had seen Bourdain when he visited Atlanta last year to give a talk of sorts and he was bitching about the same thing.

I guess I just will write an open letter to the owner a young man I had an encounter with. I want to tell you you have a beautiful restraunt and the food is pretty wonderful. I also want to ask you what is having a beautiful restaurant worth if who you are on the inside and how you treat people is horrible? One day your restaurant will close, you will not be of this Earth and all that will be remembered of you is who you were and how you treated people. I've been spoken to like I'm below others before but never by someone I wasn't employed by or who I didn't even know. You sat there and looked and spoke to me like I was less than the ants you step on walking in the door each day. I don't understand why. I don't understand why people aren't more kind and gentle with one another. We all just tear each other down in a quest to make ourselves feel better and in the process we lose our souls. When are you so unkind that you tell someone who's just trying to make it you don't want their money because you own a restaurant? That you're above them and they should just accept everything you say because you have more money then they do. I don't understand sir. I never will. Because at the end of the day when all is said and done and we fall asleep and the world is quiet you have to live with yourself and how you make people feel. It's so obvious you don't consider what other people are going through and you think that because you own something you deserve that chip on your shoulder. You were once a boy and I'm sure someone in your life spoke to you like you were nothing- maybe someone picked on you at school, maybe you never did good enough for your parents, maybe you lost someone close to you and no one gave you a break when you needed one... you've become the pain others have given you. I implore you to read this and instead of getting angry read this with love. Because I love everyone. I want good for everyone. Even the people who treat me like I'm nothing because the cycle must end somewhere. The negativity, all of it. No man is better than the next. We are all equal and we all make up this world and we need to take care of each other. Be kind when you can, be good when you can, love like it's your last day because nothing is promised. Be the person you want to stand with in life. Love your neighbors because you share the world with them. We are all in this. There is enough ugly in the world that is out of our control but what we can control is how we treat each other. I can only hope that you will stop being smug and stop belittling people and that you will radiate joy and love and I hope that positivity spreads like wildfire. You opened a restaurant, a beautiful one- congratulations. Now I can only hope you will open your heart. Thanks if you read and if someone else is reading please pass it on. Thanks. Much love."},{"name":"Swiss Hibiscus","address":"4950 NE 14th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"This restaurant was one of seceral my wife and I researched and put on a list of several in Portland for a long weekend trip.  We were not disappointed.\\n\\nThe restaurant was not busy, which was both sad and surprising.  Several restaurants around the block were quite active for a sunny Saturday.  Perhaps, this restaurant was hindered by not having a prestigious Alberta St address, even though it is no more than 50 feet away.\\n\\nWe sat outside, as the sun was beckoning and the inside is a bit cramped.  I think there were only two other tables being used, one inside and another outside.  All seemed pleased--as if to review by proxy.\\n\\nWe started with escargot, gravlaz and fondue--can't eat at a Swiss restaurant without having fondue, eh?  The escargot went over well with my mother who is a really picky eater--remarkably picky.  She ate 3 of the 6 or 7 served in a specially designed escargot pan with special escargot forks.  Oily and herby, they were nice.  The gravlax  was adequate, but I was the only one who seemed pleased with the dish.  Capers were needed by be but shunned by my tablemates.  I would have put them under the salmon to help them stick, but I realize this would have diminished the addition of color they brought to the item.\\n\\nThe fondue was a bit disappointing.  It was not hot enough.  To be fair, the breeze may have prevented the sterno from staying on.  I scraped the pot.  A better utensil and more to dip than bread would have been appreciated, especially since it is a $25 item.\\n\\nI had the weinerli.  My mom had the chicken schnitzel.  My wife had the spaghetti--supposedly cooked in the Italian-Swiss style.  My sister filled up on appetizers and only ordered coleslaw.  My wienerli also came with coleslaw, it was less mayonaise flaoered than I am used to, more sour--delicious.  The weinerli was nothing more than a bunless hotdog, I don't think it was worthy of a meal without having the appetizers prior.  My wife enjoyed the pasta and stopped conversing to focus on devouring it.  My mom really liked her schnitzel, but I think the pork would have been more appropriate.\\n\\nMy meal came wiith special mustard.  Don't be shy, it is not over-powering.\\n\\nThe service was attentive.  The chefs came out to greet us and thank us for dining there.  I was a bit shocked by this, as it looked desperate--like the business is struggling from lack of patronage.  They denied this--yes, I lack tact at times and commented.  The point is, this is a restauant that deserves to stick around.  So, toss them your business.  You won't regret it.\\n\\nI really enjoyed the dessert.  I forget the name.  Basically, it is backlava with pie crust rather than filo.  Served with really nice vanilla ice cream.  My wife and sister enjoyed their desserts too--I don't recall what they had because my mom was too busy gushing about her backlava thing."},{"name":"L'Osteria","address":"104 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"This was the first restaurant I visited as I'm from California.

For a steakhouse, I hesitate, but I think their salad bar may almost be my favorite part.\\n\\nMore importantly, the meats. My one cautionary advice is that Its dangerous to get too hasty with the friendly green \\"GO\\" symbol and even more dangerous when the staff are so friendly and eager to offer you food! Its one thing to have such a wide selection of meats, all cooked to your request, but its another thing to have staff that go that extra step in remembering that kind of meat AND that level of doneness! \\nFogo de Chao is the kind of place that makes you feel like a King or Queen - with not just their amazing spread of foods, but also the way they treat you as a patron.

I was looking forward to trying their gluten free pizza as I haven't had a pizza made in a restaurant in years.  They only have one size, which is pretty much the norm anywhere else that serves gluten free pizza, so didn't think anything of that.  I ordered a few toppings, sausage, olives, mushrooms, salami, extra cheese, basil.  \\n\\nWhen the pizza was served, the crust was pretty much carbonized around the edges, way past the burned stage-- it was carbonized like charcoal.  The one tiny basil leaf in the middle was carbonized black and disintegrated into ash upon my touching it to remove it, so I didn't get to experience that topping in the way I had anticipated.  It just added to the burned flavor.  My friend and I wanted to split it, but they brought it to the table uncut, and that crust was so carbonized around the edges, it was like a huge cracker, and couldn't be cut with the butter knife we had with our utensils.   We had to ask someone to cut it, and the server was nice to come with a pizza cutter and cut it for us into 4 slices.  Why couldn't they have already sliced it before bringing it to the table, I wonder?  \\n\\nThere was so little sauce on it you couldn't taste it; the light brushing of sauce had cooked into the crust and become like a reddish coloring for the cracker surface.  There was barely enough cheese to say it was a pizza.  The mushrooms, strewn around in abundance, and the only topping that was, were the ones you get in the can from the grocery store, not fresh at all.  Needless to say, because of a few good toppings that weren't ruined, and the fact that I really do like a thin crust, it was edible, and I was hungry, so I ate it, burn taste and all.  \\n\\nWhen the server came by to ask how it was,  my friend said, \\"well, it was a little dry\\", and her response was, \\"well, that's to be expected with that type of dough.\\"  Are you kidding me?  You're going to blame the fact that it was gluten free?  I've made gluten free pizzas at home for years and never had that experience.  All in all, I probably won't go back.  It's way too expensive for what you get, and  I make a better pizza at home.  I give this a two rating because I did eat the pizza, and I like the fact that they actually catered to my diet needs.

I was there last night for some bluegrass. The music was great and it usually is. However, and the joke of it is that they charge a 5 dollar cover. Ok I'll deal with that. You know it's like 20 degrees outside so I'll pay it for warmth right? No, the heater was off so it was at least 40 inside.  Also, they don't willingly serve food.. However I was hungry as hell so I got some pasta. My friend got the meatloaf sandwich. She liked her food however mine was awkward. I've never used that to describe food before, but it seemed like someone just threw some meatballs and red sauce on al dente penne. Not great.\\nAnyway I'm not trying to bash this place in anyway. The thing is that it could be such a great place but  whoever owns this place obviously doesn't try too hard. It's a music venue without alcohol (beer and wine only) and a \\"cafe\\" without food and coffee (maybe they do have coffee but nobody was drinking it)? Instead of charging $5 dollars at the door why don't they try to serve food? I think they only have 1 menu though. Also, the seating is all over the place. Not gona start on that. \\nOk, I realize this place is supposed to be a rouge blugrassy place and I do appreciate that. And the owners obviously aren't to worried about beer selection or food. So if they are making money on this joint they surely could be making ALOT more under good management. \\nI think I like the idea of this place alot more than the place itself.

I imagine hippies telling their kids, \\"If you take out the recyclables and don't tell Grandma about Daddy's pipe, you'll get to go to Dalo's when you die.\\"  \\n\\nI say \\"cheap\\" because it really is a rare bargain, unlike so many little Portland restaurants where you spend your check and still leave hungry.  We shared an 8.99 vegetarian platter with four bowls of Misir Wot (spicy lentils), Misir Alitcha (mild lentils), Atkilt Wot (a cabbage-potato-carrot dish), Gomen (garlicky spinach) , and two giant servings of injera (bubble bread).  It was all wonderful.  There was so much food we took some home, and we were pretty damn hungry when we got there.\\n\\nIt was a bit of a wait for service, but for a busy, popular place it was hardly unreasonable -- perhaps 10 to 15 minutes before we got menus and water and another 10 to 15 before we were served.  We had the honey wine because hey, honey wine sounds good, and we expected it to be sweet but it was *sweet.*  Unless you are a total sugar fiend you'll probably struggle to finish it.\\n\\nThe fact that there's a bar and unexpected little menu oddities like milkshakes and Italian sodas (with whipped cream, if you want it) is just a bonus for an already totally satisfying experience.\\n\\nJust go, hippy or not.  You'll be happy you did.\\n\\nUpdate (12/21/08):  We've gone many times since this review and on a few occasions have had long waits (but never more than 30 minutes).

Even when completely devoid of customers, he refused to accommodate any changes to the dish or sizing. And when pointed out that he should try something along those lines, he proceeds to shout and told me to get lost.

The restaurant is a tiny, dingy, fast-food counter of a joint on the main drag through Stone Mountain village.  Across the RR tracks from City Hall and across the street from a nice little park.  It's likely you'd drive past it unless you knew something about the place in advance or you're like me and always take a chance on dives.  \\n\\nOrdered (after much brooding) our 7 sandwiches and started our wait.  Warning: most regulars probably have their menu memorized, so when turistas such as us showed up trying to figure out our choices, we probably wore their patience thin.  The total wait time for our food was 40 min.  For sandwiches, mind you.  Not that I'm complaining, but just be aware that most customers just phone in their order, then mosey down after 30 min or something.  \\n\\nAnyways, when we got our food, we sat down at the picnic tables in the park across the street and proceeded to wolf down the best philly cheesteaks I've ever had.  (This includes a sample size of 4-5 places in Philadelphia proper).  The sandwiches are a bargain considering the size of the portions.  None of us could eat more than a half.  The steak meat itself is thinly sliced, nicely grilled, juicy, and not overdone.  Nice and tender, and actually tasting like steak, not some cheap chipped beef as is common in lesser places.  The full monty includes mayo (lots of it), grilled onions, and 3 or 4 different types of peppers.  Don't come here if you are a cardiac risk.  \\n\\nTo give you a feel for how good the food is, a fight broke out amongst our kids the next day over who would get to eat leftovers.  Can't get any better than that.\\n\\nAnyways, plan in advance for a possible wait, don't act all antsy like we did (\\"got to slow down\\", as the head cook advised my wife), and enjoy a handcrafted sandwich to rival the best that Philly has to offer."},{"name":"The Family Dog","address":"1402 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I was only here for drinks for a work function, but the options were excellent - especially the seasonal slushies.

Granted, it was an early Saturday night dinner (5:00pm) but I can't recall ever being completely alone in a restaurant in the city. Maybe that should have been a sign. We got a decent bottle of white wine and some sushi rolls. Random sushi rolls. Let me explain...there was a paper slip to mark off your requested rolls, and instead of those we were brought a random selection. When asking the waiter (none of us had ever even had yellowtail, so it never would have been ordered, and certasinly wasn't marked on our sheet) he just kind of smiled and said we ordered it and maybe we forgot. All three rolls (spicy tuna, spicy salmon and spicy yellowtail) were all the same dull red minced filling that looked like it was squeezed from a tube. I'm not a frequent sushi eater, but I have never seen the fish minced into a paste. It was unappetizing in both visual appeal as well as mouth feel. When cashing out our split bill, the waiter only split it by three people instead of four, so at the end we were shuffling around cash to make sure we split the bill equally.

Not what I would of expected for a nice table but it was away from some large loud parties, so it did. \\n\\nOur server gave us our menus then took our drink order immediately before we even had time to look at the wine list. My boyfriend and I settled on mixed drinks. We then looked at the menu and decided to do the $35 pre fixed menu which has some good options, clearly giving you a good bang for your buck against ordering the items separately. In addition to that we decided we would order another appetizer. \\n\\nAn amazing bread baked in a cast iron skillet came out with butter. This was the best bread we ever had. It was dreamy. There was sea salt texture on the top. As other reviewers have said, it rocked. \\n\\nThe server then came with our drinks and went over the specials on the menu. We had already up our mind so it would of been better if he explained those specials to us when we got the menu. \\n\\nSo we went with the mussels and chorizo appetizer to start. It arrived in a little cast iron pot and some toast on the side. The mussels were out of the shell inside a seafood broth, then the chorizo gave it a spicy kick. \\n\\nAt the same time, our appetizers from the pre fixed came out. I got the clam chowder. Not very creamy but rustic with huge clams and chunks of potatoes and little slabs of panchetta. The potatoes were a bit tough as if they were not cooked enough. I enjoyed the broth and clams. On the side a plate of large oyster crackers was given. My boyfriend got the Caesar salad. It was enormous and very good. The dressing had a strong anchovy taste which he liked. \\n\\nThe times in between courses were very slow. It was clear our server was swamped between too many tables. The bus people were working hard helping out in between. \\n\\nFor my entree I got the cider glazed salmon with beets and squash. This dish was delicious. The portion of the salmon was large. The top of the fish had a crispy skin. I didn't pick up much of a cider flavor but the true flavor really shone through. I loved the squash on the side. It was a candied texture which was sweet. My boyfriend got the 12oz sirloin with marrow butter. The presentation was very contemporary with the marrow butter in the bone and a rosemary sprig coming out of that. He said it was cooked perfectly and the marrow butter accompanied it nicely. I tried a bite and agreed. The creamed spinach on the side was very watery. It made it unappetizing to eat. I have made better. \\n\\nWe then had another lull in between our plates getting cleared and dessert coming out. I was really surprised a place with the magnitude as it has could be so slow. Being it was my actual birthday it made me kind of annoyed they were not as attentive as you would expect for a fancy place when celebrating a special occasion. \\n\\nThen our plates got cleared and our server came with the desserts and a candle in my pie with a Happy Birthday plate. That made me smile and made up a little for the slowness. The apple pie a la mode was delicious. It was its own little pie with a crust all around, topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Divine. The brownie sundae was also good. \\n\\nHad service been swifter this would be 4 stars. The place overall didn't have that wow factor for me. The decor was very vanilla with beige walls and blank canvases of the same color. If I were to return I would sit at the bar since the a la carte prices were outrageous and the service didn't match up."},{"name":"Las Margaritas Latin Resturant Tequila & Rum Sports Bar","address":"1842 Chesire Bridge Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Yea, this place is pretty decent.

The corn was tasteless, beans were of the \\"campfire\\" variety, sweet potatoes (hardly any left) were burnt on the bottom, what I thought was soup was actually broccoli (again, just a few pieces left). The rice was the best with a little spicy kick, french fries were okay, fried okra was pretty decent and the hush puppies were hot and fresh but not much flavor-wise. The coleslaw contained no mayo, which would have been fine if it were not so dry. The tartar sauce was fine; I read some reviews that people were charged extra but perhaps that was for dinner. At lunch, the containers were out there for the taking. The \\"Caesar Salad\\" did have romaine lettuce and Parmesan cheese but a Caesar dressing and a few croutons do not make a proper salad--oh well.\\n\\nAs for the fish, as per other reviews the fillets were tiny, about the size of your index and middle finger together. While they were juicy and obviously just out of the fryer, the flavor was strong, bitter and overpowering; catfish is a mild fish, like tilapia. Still, enough malt vinegar and tartar sauce made it palatable. At $10.99, a good value, it's not. And despite all of the great signs and memorabilia throughout, ambiance wasn't enough to improve my experience.

This was an awesome spot to just unwind for a bit. Our server (Chris maybe?) was one of the best servers I've ever had. Anyone that gets picky ole me to step out on the edge with not only the appetizer, but to try something new for my entree AND dessert?!? \\n\\nNow, THAT is some serious service! We began with the garlic bread, and opted for three pieces with the tomatoes baked in, and three pieces with onions baked in. They both sounded unappetizing to me as I don't like tomatoes or onions! However, while the onion bread was just okay and slyly passed off to hubs, the tomato version was delectable! Especially with a bit of their spice infused olive oil drizzled on top. Next, they don't have regular ole' pepperoni pizza. Blasphemy! However, the server gave us a brief lesson on Northern Italian cuisine (which the restaurant serves), and why I wasn't going to find the beloved pepperoni classic. I went with *gasp* four cheese! I know, not living on the edge for most, but as someone who *only* eats pepperoni pizza, this was big. Once we got over how thin and almost see through the pizza was, we found the flavors spot on. For dessert we went with the cheesecake with custard and caramel drizzled on top. What the heck!?! I just wanted plain ole' cheesecake, but Chris assured me I would really like it. You don't even know me man, but you haven't steered me wrong yet! Buddy was right. That cheesecake-custard hybrid was divine! \\n\\nOverall, we really enjoyed our dining experience here, and would definitely come back the next time we visit family in Atlanta!"},{"name":"O'Charley's Restaurant & Bar","address":"4850 Morse Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"2.5","text":"Well. This was a sad experience to say the least, and certainly the last chance I'm giving this location of O'Charley's. We arrived around 7pm with s party of six and were surprisingly seated right away. Which was great, mostly. They put us in the far back dining room by the bathrooms which I assume is only meant for overflow. Small perk it is close to the restrooms. Large downside, the air is not circulated correctly in there and it is FRIGID. Like, brrr. \\n\\nWe were approached relatively quickly by our waiter who took our drink & app orders and left. Both of those came out relatively quickly. The one thing we were lacking however was their signature rolls. It took about 10 minutes and three times of asking for our table to get a basket. When they arrived they were quite squished and very oily. Several members of the party went to reach for a napkin but we didn't receive silverware. Our waiter was few and far between so my partner went off to find some. \\n\\nThe evening continued and our main entrees were still no where in sight. I get it. Busier time of night, larger party... we waited for probably about 30 minutes to get our dinner (a sandwich, a burger, two pastas, a salad, and chicken). As the meal continued dirty dishes remained on the table, water glasses were left unfilled, all while several wait staff/ bussers walked past. What they did seem to have the time to do though was chat in the back corner by the drink machine about how much they hated their job. Something that was very audible to my table. \\n\\nFor the most part everyone enjoyed their food. Major consensus was that everything was too salty. Good reviews for the salad and french dip (minus the salt issue). \\n\\nThe restaurant itself seemed to be in good order, although the bathrooms were a tad disheveled, toilet paper strewn across the floor, trash overflowing. \\n\\nThis was your last chance O'Charley's."},{"name":"Gallettos Wine Bar & Grill","address":"3875 S Kirkman Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Absolutely delicious!

This is perhaps more thought than cheap cambodian food often deserves, but it's very true here.)\\n\\nWe ordered the following:\\n\\n1.  Garlic Chicken Wings - these were fried very well (quite tender and moist).  I ate the first, and it was very good, but then I tried one with the lime pepper sauce and was much more impressed.  \\n\\n2.  Bo Luc Lac (marinated beef on rice with egg) - overall my favorite dish.  Tender beef, sauce with just enough sweetness, and well-cooked rice.  Doesn't sound that hard, but I don't find many restaurants that get it all right.\\n\\n3.  Butter Beef - also very good.

We'd called to say our movie got out late and would be late for our reservation.  When we showed, he asked about the movie and chatted a bit with us before leaving us.  Great guy.  \\n\\nOur waiter?  Not so much.  He just wasn't that attentive, although I have to say that I LOVED the fact that he brought me a complementary glass of wine when our bottle was finished and my husband and daughter still had some in their glasses but mine was empty.  A great gesture (\\"to keep them company\\" he said, as he put the glass down in front of me).\\n\\nOh and place is gorgeous - great atmosphere.\\n\\nThe problem is the food.  They start you with a basket of nice focaccia, fried won tons, chili sauce and hummus.  The won tons were a bit heavy, but very tasty.  Overall a nice start.\\n\\nWe ordered one serving of scallion pancake to share as a starter.  It was basically inedible.  (We should have let them know, to be honest, but we didn't. We just picked at the edges of it.)  It was dripping in oil rather than crispy.  I'm not an expert, but maybe the oil wasn't hot enough?  In any case, it was just unpleasantly oily.\\n\\nThen we had 2 salads - one was Japanese seaweed with baby spinach, the other arugula with Padano cheese.  Both were very nice.\\n\\nFor our 3 mains, I had sauteed skate wing with capers over wilted baby spinach.  It was very tasty, but again a bit too much oil.  The plate was swimming with oil in fact. But I enjoyed the dish.  My daughter had pad thai which was just so so  My husband had pasta (orechiette) with sausage and broccoli.  It was also just so-so.  Nothing at all wrong with it, but nothing interesting either.  \\n\\nAt these prices, we would all have expected some creativity in the dishes.  They were just average.  \\n\\nFor dessert, we had pavlova with fresh berries which was wonderful - just perfect.  They also brought us a tiramisu on the house, which was nice of them.\\n\\nSo to sum up the food, some very nice things, several very average things, and one terrible (the scallion pancake).

It was tender, flavourful and tasty. (He says it's more of a \\"regular\\" size sandwich from his perspective).\\n\\nSince they didn't offer a smoked chicken dinner, I went for the smoked ribeye steak.  (Only offered Friday, Saturday and Sunday). The steak was cooked perfectly to my medium rare request.  The flavor was spot on however i was surprised at how tough it was too cut through and there was a lot of fat and gristle I had to cut away.  I was happy with the corn muffin and the Wilbur beans in the side.   \\n\\nAfter the house chips and the order of fries as an appetizer, I was too full for the side salad, although it looked good. \\n\\nTheir French fries are terrific, served hot, fresh and that perfect combination of crisp on the outside and tender in the middle. \\n\\nWe were seated right away.

But instead of the naked guy covered in tattoos talking to himself in the corner at 3:00 A.M. there was guy spinning a crystal over his table for the duration of our lunch (I swear!) while his companion stared out the window as if hypnotized or just completely bored out of her mind.  There were the gringo rasta guys were there with their moms, but I also saw one of the prettiest girls in the world there, too.\\n\\nThe food's pretty straightforward veggie/macrobiotic fare, some might call it bland but then you're really talking down to the vegetables themselves because besides cooking them not a lot has been done to alter them.  When I was there they offered a fixed menu for $12.00.  The carrots and parsnips were very tasty, the kale with the nut sauce was also very good.  The black bean soup was a knockout, and the salad was dressed in a Cesar-ish type dressing that was very nice.  The whipped sweet potatoes with cherry glaze would have made a lot better desert than the vegan flan did (some things should NEVER be attempted as a vegan version) and despite what others have written I was full when I left.  Unless you're a totally unsocialized carnivore you shouldn't have any problem getting happy at Casa de Luz.\\n\\nThe service is good and friendly, and there's a nice vibe from the kitchen.  It's little spendy, but the place is gushing goodness and light.\\n\\nOne thing I thought was odd was there's no ice for the tea.  I asked the guy in Spanish who was working there, but he just sort of shook his head \\"No\\" at me.   What on earth could be wrong with ice?   I didn't notice any other condiments around either, but it's not the kind of food you pour ketchup or mustard on anyway, however a little pepper sauce would have really stepped up that kale!\\n\\nStaying true to their vegan theme, Casa de Luz doesn't monkey around with trying to make artificial meat dishes, like Tofu Chorizo or gluten turkey breast.  Really, fake meat is the same as real meat.  The intention is there. \\n\\nSo, I liked Casa de Luz, it's in a lovely garden-like setting and the space is very clean and relaxing.

I still believe in the concept, but it needs some tweaking. As soon as we sat down, we felt like we were bombarded with food. The chefs kept coming by with their dishes, making it difficult to relax and enjoy the meal. The constant interruptions became frustrating, and it's awkward to tell the chef who cooked the dish that you don't want to try it. It was also oddly difficult to find our main waiter to order additional drinks and request the check. Since he isn't bringing out the food, clearing the plates, or checking off items on your \\"list,\\" it shouldn't be that hard to track him down, right?\\n\\nWhen I described the service style to a friend, she suggested they implement a Brazilian steakhouse style of service, where you have a red and green disc you can flip over to indicate when you don't want to be approached with any more food.\\n\\nService issues aside, we really enjoyed several of the dishes. They tend to be on the small side, so as other reviewers have noted, they add up. However, menu prices include tax, and the drink list is very reasonable ($6 wine and beer).

Even if you're too full and have to get it to go and eat it later, for the love of god, get it. You won't be disappointed.\\n\\nThe service here is also really good, but maybe the one thing I'm knocking a star off for. You have to kind of awkwardly wait in the front hall for a table. It's a little weird, honestly, especially when it's freezing cold outside and you just keep getting blasted with icy air every time the door opens. Kind of a weird set-up, but the food is worth the weirdness. The servers are always very attentive, and so are the bus boys/water fillers.\\n\\nI will agree with some of the other reviewers that parking is a little weird, but there's always plenty of street parking on the back alley, and usually some parking in the random side parking lot. Fortunately, I walk when I go, so I'm not going to count off for the parking situation.

On the expensive side, but the quality of the food was excellent. Our waiter, Jason, was exceptional - very knowledgable about the menu and wine pairings, friendly, not rushed (despite the night becoming rather busy). Had a couple of well-made cocktails at the bar before being seated. The mini bread rolls, as others have noted, were a treat also. For the main courses, I splurged on the Australian Kobe sirloin, and it was just about worth the cost - perfectly prepared and well presented. Not something you'd order every day, but certainly memorable. My wife's filet mignon was very nice as well, although it came out closer to medium than medium rare as requested. We split an order of parmesan truffle fries, which were light and flavorful - a great and whimsical complement to the excellent steaks. \\n\\nThere is one area Mooo could definitely improve on, and that is front of house service. We had an early reservation (5:30), and arrived about ten minutes early. Planned on having cocktails at the bar anyway, so certainly weren't expecting to be seated before our serving time. But there was no one at the front podium (despite a full crowd already at the bar), and we stood there waiting for several minutes. When someone did finally come over, she seemed distracted, and not really focused on welcoming us - more of a brusqe \\"We can't seat you yet; there's the bar, go wait there\\" attitude. Didn't get our evening off to a good start. Second strike was after we'd been at the bar for a while (15 mins or so), and noticed that our coats that we'd checked were still draped haphazardly over the banister, with others now piling up on top. At a high end restaurant, where people tend to wear nice clothing, that really isn't how it's done. I went over to ask (politely) when our coats would be properly hung up, and got a rather snooty brush off (\\"we're very busy when we first open, and don't always have time to walk downstairs to the cloakroom, we'll get to it soon\\"). The attitude was poor, and just this side of making us walk out. \\n\\nUltimately, glad we stayed for the very good food and the excellent waitstaff - but I can't give them the 5 stars that the food and waiter deserved because of the poor front-of-house (I could almost hear Chef Gordon Ramsay in my head, watching us on a hidden camera and shouting, \\"That's not good enough!)"},{"name":"Swiss Hibiscus","address":"4950 NE 14th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Absolutely delicious food!

Often my reviews are filled with a bit of sarcasm and a crapload of backhanded wit but I am gonna be serious with this one. For the reviewers who said that this place \\"tries to be pretentious\\"- I couldnt disagree more. The interior of this restaurant is impeccable, stylish, different and beautiful. I would have a wedding reception here for sure. Its absolutely stunning. \\nI arrived earlier than my Aunt who I was meeting for dinner and Randy the Manager showed me to a spot at the bar. The bartender greeted me warmly and offered me the wine list. I chose their Pinot Noir by the glass and it was delicious. I asked the bartender about the concept of Italian and Chinese cuisine because its something I find really interesting. Its not fusion, its just that the chef is madly in love with both of these places and their cuisine. As I enjoyed my wine I glanced around the room. The servers moved gracefully around the tables and Mitchell Maxwell approached tables to speak to them about the food and answer any preparation questions or requests they may have. There is a certain joy I take in seeing a chef doing table visits... not because he has to but because he sincerely wants to. The difference between the two is always incredibly evident. \\nShortly before I finished my wine my Aunt arrived and we were shown to our cute private table near the back side of the room. Our waitress (little blonde-sorry i dont remember your name!) greeted us with a smile and told us about the specials. We let her know it had been a while since we had seen each other so we woould be taking our sweet time to catch up. The entire evening she paced us slowly and left us alone but at the same time.. we never needed anything. If our plates were empty, or our glasses low.. someone appeared almost magically and it was done. \\nAs for the food... it was excellent. We started with a lobster rangoon appetizer that was yum yum yummy and perfectly filled and fried. We then split the beet and goat cheese salad that was phenomenal. I could eat that every day. I ordered the orrechiette bolognese and my aunt ordered the orrechiette with brocoli, sausage and garlic sauce. They were brought out in big wide bowls and the pasta was cooked perfectly. The portions were perfectly sized.. enough to bring home but not so much that you feel like you will have to eat it for two meals. I am not a huge fan of leftovers so I like when there is only a bit to take with me if I want. \\nAt the end of our three hour meal I was happy, full and ready for bed. I live in South Boston so to hit up Natick is a bit of a haul but I think my Aunt and I will make this a monthly thing. I will also definitely be taking Tim there when he returns for a romantic welcome home dinner. \\nThank you Maxwells. Your staff is lovely, my night was lovely and you should be proud of what you have going on there in Natick. I'll be back to try the lobster gnocchi!"},{"name":"Pad Thai Cuisine","address":"1201 Barbara Jordan Blvd, Ste 1220","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Extremely disappointed with this place, especially coming from a Thai food lover. I've ordered takeout twice and both times been very dissatisfied. The first time I ordered the Tom Kha with shrimp. It was luke warm, not very many shrimp that were obviously thrown in at the end, and had nearly zero other ingredients. All the other ingredients listed were either absent or so small they were hardly there. It was basically shrimp with the tails still on sitting in broth. The broth had an okay flavor but that's it.\\n\\nSecond time I ordered the Hor Mok Talay which is listed as a \\"house specialty\\" and one of the pricier items on the menu. I am not a picky eater and I had to throw it away it was so bad. The rice was old and dry. The red curry paste was not a paste at all but pink and clumpy. The seafood was a mix of chewy low quality ingredients. Then they did not package the items well and they all leaked out of the box and then bag.\\n\\nThe staff has at least been friendly but that's all I can say that's good about this place based on my two times ordering here.

Of the many times I've been, I've only had one good experience.\\n\\nService is always spotty.  If waiting at the bar for a table on the patio (let's face it, aren't we all), it's a struggle to get someone's attention, let alone get a drink.  I realize they are busy, but if they can't staff appropriately for the crowd they should now know to expect, that's their mistake. Don't let so many people up to the patio if you can't serve them. \\n\\nTable service is also spotty, and the food is, for the most part, disappointing for what they charge.  On several occasions that I've had dinner service, at least one dish, if not a few, was/were sent back due to improper cooking.  My friends and I are by no means picky or fussy, but the Keg is supposed to be a steakhouse. If they can't cook a steak within reasonable done-ness of how it was ordered, there's a problem. On one occasion, myself and my three friends, in our party of 4, sent back our steaks.  I have NEVER sent back food at a restaurant, except at the Keg. I worked in the restaurant industry for 15 years, and I am a very easy and understanding customer because of this.  When I ask for my steak medium and I get served a plate full of blood, I was pretty let down (and grossed out). I was actually a bit disappointed that our server brought our plates to our table, as we had ordered from him and he knew the cooking we had requested.\\n\\nNevertheless, I will not argue with the fact that this is definitely one of the top spots in Vancouver for people-watching and meeting/mingling... just order steak at your own risk.  As J.N. said, the appetizers are generally tasty, but don't expect a great dining experience.  Particularly this location, it's all about the social aspect."},{"name":"Pho Gia","address":"1944 NE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"First let me state that I am not a soup person.

I'm all for a fun atmosphere, but when you can't hear who you are dining with - it's a little annoying.  The food is out of this world - everything we had totally wowed us.  The only thing that didn't wow us were some of the prices for some of the miniscule portions they were serving.  The pacing of the meal can be a little frustrating.  At one point, we had 3 items on our table when a 4th came around.  We declined it even though we really wanted to try it....just not that second.  We found out that they wouldn't offer it to us again unless our server went & told the kitchen we wanted to try it and THEN it might be 45 minutes before it came around again.  Whaaaatt? The drink cart idea is cool for the specialty cocktails.  What is not cool....waiting 20 minutes for your drink after you order it.  The glass of wine I ordered showed up in less than 5 minutes.  So it's a mixed review for me - fabulous food but I just don't care for the service concept - not because of how they present it - but how the pace of the meal was completely off.

Delicious and interesting flat-bread pizza options - and other good seasonal food too. The atmosphere is fun - small, dimly lit, crowded with locals, and bustling/loud (don't come if you're prone to feeling claustrophobic!).  Grab a seat at the small bar (first come first serve) or wait for a table (reservations recommended but you may still have to wait 10-15 minutes).  I live in Beacon Hill down the street from Figs and this is a great go-to place for a nice meal that can be very affordable if you split a pizza with one or two other people (or pricier if you order a multi-course non-pizza meal with drinks...also good!). My favorite pizza? Hard to say but probably Isabelle's (country ham, asparagus, sweet onions, aged provolone $18 and serves 2-3 people) mmm!"},{"name":"BBT Cafe","address":"5979 W Boulevard","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"BBT Cafe has managed to appeal to a variety of ages. It's not just kids who come here, but their parents, their parents friends, and even their grandparents. Thus, be warned: this is not the place to come with your secret boyfriend or girlfriend or mistress if you don't want to be seen.\\n\\nSolid Taiwanese favorites such as FRIED PORK CHOP ($7.95) and DEEP FRIED CHICKEN NUGGETS (a.k.a. popcorn chicken) ($7.95), MEAT SAUCE (pork) on rice ($5.50), etc. are reliable. The meal combos make for a perfect lunch as the protein comes with a side of sweet corn, scrambled egg in tomato sauce, green vegetable (either mustard greens or broccoli) and a bowl of rice. On my recent visit, I felt like trying the STEWED EGGPLANT ($8.50), which was excellent.\\n\\nAn order of fried tofu or SPICY DUMPLINGS ($7.25) makes for a good shared side.\\n\\nThe drinks here are pretty good, though on the pricy side. The SHAVED ICE is brilliant: you know how after you eat the fruit and other toppings, and eat up the shaved ice that has the condensed milk, then you're left with just a pile of plain ice? Well, at about that point, here at BBT, your spoon will tap into the underground (under-ice) reservoir of hidden flavored fruit SYRUP that has been injected into the depths of the bowl! Lovely. But extremely sweet.\\n\\nThe only reason to de-star BBT Cafe is the shaky service. On my last visit, we had to wait a good 10-15 minutes at the entrance feeling rather awkward before one of the servers came over to ask if our names were on her clipboard. When I told her my name in English, she gave up and told me to write it myself, since she couldn't be bothered to try spelling my name. We had to ask several times before our tea or water were refilled. It wasn't so much bad attitude as it was negligent. An older lady at an adjacent table really chewed her out, yapping away in high-pitched Chinese ferocity, for her faults. Guess what? After that, the service was great.\\n\\nCredit cards accepted.

I asked about several menu items, and after receiving a few one worded answers & absent stares I decided to go with the bacon, cheese sirloin burger just to end our interaction. Her peers were less than helpful too. If you work at a restaurant you need to be knowledgeable in its menu and ingredients used. That's basic. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself was unbearably hot, even when I chose a spot by a fan. I don't understand why restaurants don't spring for A/C units.

In fact, when my meal was brought it was napkin-less and someone who came out from the kitchen (probably the person they were complaining about) kindly brought me a napkin). One of the ladies also proceeded to burp very loudly while behind the counter. So odd.

Indeed, I showed up on Restaurant Week but doesn't mean that my water should never get refilled, that my iced tea just left empty without question. I paid $4 for it so it should deserve a bit of attention! To get my coat from the coat check was another steadfast wait. The hostess was no where to be seen and the person who walked up the stairs was surprised to see six people waiting to get their coats. No tips for the coat check since we had to stand there a bit for any service. Disturbingly, my friend's coat was just left by the hostess stand instead of being delivered to the coat room as we had lunch. The guy that picked up the tickets was saying to my friend that he could've just taken it instead of waiting here. I don't think I'll check my coat here again if there is another time. I don't want to chance losing my coat and have to walk to my car in the cold.\\n\\nI had the onion soup to start which was to my liking. It was not salty at all; but rather sweet. The level of sweetness was unnatural of the onion. The sweetness did kill the onion flavor. Rather, what onion flavor? It was presented in a cast iron cup. I never touched it, but let's hope that it was put into the oven instead of presentation purposes.\\n\\nFor 2ND course, I had a sirloin steak Au poivre. I didn't like this at all. Too much peppercorn and way too salty with the sauce. Every time, I took a bite, the initial flavor was peppercorn... then the after taste was just salty beef gravy. It wasn't as rare as I would like it to be which I did ask for as rare as possible. For a steakhouse, they do suck at making rare or beyond rare. The Frites that came with it was too salty. I must say that they did a good job frying it - nice golden color and perfect crispness. It might have been sea salt they used on it. I had to ask for ketchup for my frites. I was in dismay when I realized that they use cubed sugar instead of loose sugar since I have this habit for adding sugar to my ketchup.\\n\\nDessert was a chocolate mousse cake. I don't like desserts but I gave it a whirl anyways. I am not a fan of chocolate and for me to say it doesn't taste much like chocolate.. it was really sub par!

We were seated just fine and our food was good as well. However, the service sucked. We had 5 PM reservations Friday evening and when we got there, we had the place to ourselves. Things did fill up quite quickly around 6 PM. I ordered a mixed drink when our waiter explained everything to us. It took almost 15 minutes to get my mixed drink from the bar. We went to the salad bar which was only so-so in terms of options. We have been routine customers at Rodizio Bar and Grill and Tucanos and they are both better and $20 cheaper per person. The meat selections were good but it was obvious they were trying to push the cheaper cuts of meat to fill you up quickly. The bread rolls on the table were cold and hard. When they brought out mashed potatoes it was enough for 1 spoonful for each of the 4 of us. The above listed places actually offer the potatoes, plantains and other options at the salad bar. When we asked for more potatoes and plantains, 10 minutes p[assed and I had to ask again. This time, the waiter said bring a large order. We got 2 small orders instead and then our waiter brought 1 large order. I was really really disappointed. I was hesitant from the beginning because of the prices. I wasn't sure how someone could offer a product that is $20 more per person than Rodizio or Tucanos and make the experience that much better. Foge de Chao answered my questions with a resounding thud. It isn't possible. Unfortunately, if you want Churassco, this is the only option in the area. I do not think I will ever return.

We ordered the side sampler flight, and were disappointed in both the spinach and the mushrooms, though the fries and mashed potatoes were very good.  To elaborate, the mushrooms tasted and had the consistency as though they came out of a can from the supermarket, and the creamed spinach was terribly watery, more like spinach soup than anything.\\n\\nI would say our neighbors on either side added to the poor experience.

Not bad as nearly everywhere else was 60-90 minutes. We had dishes of Penne, Spaghetti, Chicken Parmigiana and calamari. It was all good, not great but overall a decent meal. The bread is delicious but the marinara sauce is ordinary and on the bland side. This is a big problem in this neighborhood as you can imagine as the bar is set very high. Red sauce is beyond important.  Anyhow, the price was right for the quality of food. Service was average and the place itself is nothing special and a bit dated.

We had the half-shrimp and half-fig+prosciutto pizza as well as my beloved Macaroni Simone. Amazing but not as good as I remembered. I almost left without getting the bread pudding (which just tells you that they forgot to ask us if we wanted dessert) but we got it as a takeout when we paid our bill. I'm planning a visit to Boston in August and Figs is most definitely on the \\"MUST VISIT\\" list.\\n\\nI've never been to this location but there used to be a Figs in Wellesley up until a couple of months ago.

Macaroni Simone (actually orzo + four cheeses + garlic bread crumbs), fig & prosciutto pizza (the jam is so delish!), golden tomato (white tomatoes with again, the bread crumbs), and the white chocolate bread pudding for dessert.\\n\\nThe latter is simply amazing, it melts in your mouth. I literally didn't want to let go of the taste in the mouth, until I looked down and saw that I had more and promptly picked up the fork again.

But seriously after a morning and early afternoon of absolute suckage, the Melting Pot was able to bring a bit of brightness to my day along with a food coma.\\n\\nWe came here last year during Midtown Restaurant week, which wasn't a bad deal, but it was like they stuck us on the right side of the restaurant near a kitchen door for being cheap. We did get moved but that was just funny...this time, it was just fine: nice and tucked away in a corner, although it was kind of weird that the table across from us was a mom and a maybe 13 year old boy (or maybe an older woman with a very interesting taste in guys, who knows) and neither of them would leave their phones alone. I can hear the voicemail bot lady over here.\\nAnyway, they weren't that bad but...voicemail bot lady. I hate her.\\n\\nThis was the opportunity to try the whole Big Night Out thing, which is currently a Pacific Island theme, complete with matching drinks. (Next is a French theme, no idea when.) We stuck with that for the most part, except for dessert.\\n\\nThey should have called the cheese fondue \\"triple alcohol\\" because it had not only white wine, but also sake and mirin. I was a bit put off at first because I had a bit that just tasted overwhelmingly of sake, but it neutralized itself rather quickly. It kind of didn't go with the apples, which are usually my favorite. The cheddar cheese one is indeed awesome for apples.\\n\\nI wasn't crazy about the lettuce wraps for a salad. The flavors didn't entirely go together for me, and I could not figure out how to eat it. I tried both cutting up everything and eating it as a wrap. The wrap was too messy and all the stuff on top didn't work well with a fork. Basically it was a romaine lettuce leaf, topped with a mixture of shredded carrots, bean sprouts, cucumber slices, and somewhere in there some mint. The dressing was really good though, it was a mandarin-ginger dressing with some black sesame seeds.\\n\\nThe entree portion was awesome. We substituted the pork tenderloin for filet. I had actually joked to a friend before that I wondered if you could just substitute something for filet, and our server just automatically went with filet when we said we didn't want the pork. Awesome. The chili marinated chicken was great, and I loved the ahi tuna. The teriyaki sirloin is always good, but I couldn't bring myself to try the key lime shrimp. They are indeed limey, from the color to the taste, according to my boyfriend. There were also some veggie potstickers, which I would say you should just toss in the broth/oil rather than try to keep on a fondue fork. You will end up needing the food overboard spoon.\\nAlso my favorite thing is to first put the potatoes in, just so I can be in charge of their cooking and then announce \\"potatoes are go!\\"\\n\\nAnd if that is not enough, the dessert menu comes along. And even after stuffing your face already, every single chocolate option sounds really good. We went with the chocolate s'mores fondue, which included fire. Tableside flambee is always a win with me, even more when it involves a marshmallow on chocolate and I get to dip cheesecake in there.\\nYou may die when dipping a brownie in here. Just saying.\\n\\nIt is really expensive, even with the $50 towards everything (okay we also had 2 drinks and a cappuccino and cafe latte). In any case, I don't think fondue is really something most people do more than a couple times a year if that...if they do, they probably have a fondue set at home (hi, mine is shaped like a Hershey kiss), but it's definitely a good time if you want to treat someone out to a fun dinner.\\n\\nNow excuse me, I must return to my coma."},{"name":"Zoes Kitchen","address":"2333-A Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"The only reason why I'm going to give this place a 3 star is because I've been here on a couple of other occasions.

Either way, there are a lot of drunk messes on Thursday nights, which can be fun, or not. When I was there a guy literally fell on our table...a few too many dollar beers I'd say. He did offer to pay for the spilled drinks though, what a nice guy ha :)\\n\\nAs I mentioned, though, there are some perks to this place. I went a couple of weekends ago on a Friday night and was pleasantly surprised by how different the bar felt! There were fewer people, the service was friendlier and there was Karaoke! The karaoke was awesome- everyone got really into it and people were just having a fun, relaxing time. The bar is big too, so the people who didn't want to do karaoke could go to the other side and watch the sports game or just sit and eat/drink. I'd definitely come back here on a weekend night for another dose of beer and karaoke. Just be prepared for the college party if you are planning on a Thursday."},{"name":"Cioffi's Meat Market & Deli","address":"4156 E Hastings St, Suite 4142","city":"Burnaby","stars":"4","text":"I have been shopping at Cioffi's for years despite the iffy service. You can receive some seriously rude service sometime. Today was one of those days. I went to the newer store that has the butcher shop. It started off well, when I approached the store a customer held the door open for me and was very polite. As soon as I walked in I had to walk past an employee in a butchers coat, she was very grumpy looking! Then when I waited in line to be served at the butcher counter she bypassed me and asked some other customers if they needed help, when I informed her that I had been waiting she was extremely rude and said she wasn't the only one working. \\nI couldn't believe that she had said such a lame response. \\nI would have said something else but meh, who cares.

The food was very good (we had the eggs Benedict [two people] and the salmon croissant sandwich).

The staff was very friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable, all of which was appreciated. The table we were sat at was a little small for three people, though, making it difficult to have three plates of food, coffee, cream, water, bread, and a salt/pepper shaker on the table at the same time. The tables were rather close to each other, making it difficult to have a conversation or which meant someone in the party would be pinned in between another person at their table and then by a table/seated person next to them.

Just one of a kind experience. It's a huge restaurant with a formal ambience but casual attire. We made reservations but didn't really need it. We were new to the concept but omg that's a lot of meat you can eat. It started with the salad bar which was extensive along with a separate section for hot sides. My tip - don't fill up in the salad much (it's good but not out of the ordinary). We ordered a Bottle of Malbec recommended by our server which was reasonably prices and paired really well with most of the meats. Then started the meat fest. My favorite were the fillet mignon, prime rib and the pork ribs. Others were good too but kinda overshadowed by these 3. And I forgot, the biscuits/bread that came at the start was pretty awesome too.\\nWe ate like pigs n then felt like animals in the  end too.

I came a few years ago and felt it was good - not great, but not a place to avoid. It was nice in terms of decor, decent in terms of service, and the food was pretty good.   But I don't know what happened.  They blamed it all on chef Ramsey - but if you own a restaurant, I think you need to take some responsibility.\\n\\nFirst they assigned two waiters to us - one for one side of the table and the other for the other side - since we were supposed to have a party of ten, but we were actually a party of 7, which I think could have been handled by one waiter.  Of course the restaurant was so empty (warning sign #1) they probably wanted to try to help the waiter get some work.  Of course the only competent waitress ended up doing everything since the other one was not that great.  I ordered a drink.  It took so long for it to come that I asked the food runner if he could please inquire with our waiter where my drink was.  Then they brought me my BASIL strawberry caipirinha.  It was undrinkable.  A few slices of strawberry, a mint leaf and some alcohol.  I tell the competent waitress if she could tell the bartender they forgot to add the sugar to my drink. So they add about a 1/2 cup of sugar and still forget the lime. Oh and they are out of basil  - I guess they figured mint basil, there both green.\\nThe food.  Their decision on spicy wings?  The entire whole wing. So I had to cut it up. Brilliant. The taste?  A fried wing with some Texas Pete on it. The entree. Well, they take everyone at the table's order except mine and then didn't come back to the table for 10 minutes.  I guess the waiter with the four people on our side of the table got overwhelmed.  So everyone else was done eating when I got my entree.  It was rigatoni with mushrooms.  \\nOMG. It was awful.  First, it was not piping hot.  Seeing as everyone at my table has eaten, could you have a sense of urgency bringing out mine maybe?  Second the pasta was woefully overcooked.  Mushy.  The flavor was disgusting.  It had grease and oil oozing off the plate.  The \\"sauce\\" tasted like the absolute blandest not fully cooked floury tasting roux ever.  Like paste.  No garlic, or salt, or cheese, or wine.  I took one bite, my friend saw the look on my face and took a bite and then we asked to see the chef. She said you cannot eat that!  That is terrible!\\nI left without eating dinner. Thank God Barcelona the lovely place around the block had delicious hot food and was still serving.\\n\\nBTW none of my friend enjoyed their meals.  I am actually shocked to see good reviews.

The scallops arrived with a deep brown color, so it was a dead giveaway they were overcooked. Again, unacceptable. I ordered the New York steak cooked medium rare. The steak came rare to raw in parts. WHAT??? This is an upscale, totally pricey steakhouse, and the chef can't cook the steak properly. And I had to cut off parts of gristle.  The steak should have been perfectly trimmed.  I've gotten better quality steaks at Costco.  We split creme brulee that was good, but I think you have to try really hard to screw that dessert up. All in all, it was a huge disappointment, and I know our kids were bummed because they put a lot of thought and research into selecting Grill 23. My advice is if you want a great meal at an upscale steakhouse, stick to the tried and true like Capital Grille, Mooo and Morton's and you won't be disappointed,\\nPS - A gentleman on one of the other tables sent his meal back, probably because his steak wasn't cooked properly."},{"name":"Aashirwad Indian Food and Bar","address":"7000 S Kirkman Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Heres the context:  \\n\\nIm a bit of a bloodhound when it comes to north Indian.

They cleaned our table right before i sat down and i still had to wipe up some nasty cream smear.

From the moment I walked in the door, I could notice the bad service. There was no one to check in with for a table in a restaurant with standing room only and people packed up and down the hallway. Then, once I did check in, it turns out she never wrote down my name the first time. Once we finally were seated, it got worse...much worse. We each ordered a meal and bottomless mimosas for brunch. The food came relatively quickly, but when the wrong meal was brought out for one of us, it took over 30 minutes before we saw the waiter again to correct the mistake. And the bottomless mimosa idea loses its effect, when it takes 30 minutes to see your waiter and another 30 minutes for him to bring them out and then only brings enough for a half glass each despite your requests for more at a time.  In total, we maybe caught a glimpse of our waiter 6 times total over the course of a 3-hour meal (not that we wanted it to last that long). And then, when the check came out, he tried charged us for both the incorrect meal that he rang up and the corrected meal. I really enjoyed the food and drinks here, but the service really killed our vibe.

If you hit a problem, talk to management and they helped us by making a new pizza (the first one had almost no cheese) and comped my meal because they had forgotten to bring my salad (I had the unlimited soup and salad).  We sat outside so you kind of expect less than perfect service but ours was really bad.  Water was filled once, no one checked in on us and management did not follow up on the second pizza (which was burned).  I didn't even bother to check the reviews before we came because the chain is usually the same across locations but I would go to another place before this one in this shopping plaza."},{"name":"Boloco","address":"176 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Boloco has long been one of my favorite restaurants primarily due to the nutritious, delicious tasting, \\"real food\\" offerings and reasonable prices coupled with a really generous frequency discount program, their Boloco card.  (FREE item during your birthday month and other great perks throughout the year.)   Locations are mostly in Boston with a few in other places like Lynnfield, Cambridge, &  NH.  They recently raised their prices and changed their menu somewhat.  I absolutely CANNOT compliment them enough on their changes!  They went from being AWESOME to BEYOND-AWESOME.  The nominal price increase is totally worth it for what they offer---and it also goes towards paying their staff better.  The newest offerings are AMAZING--REALLY!!  I just tried their Kale/ Beet/ Sweet potato/ Goat cheese/ mushroom/ Quinoa/ chicken salad and have to say it may well be the BEST salad I have EVER had.  The BEST!!  WELL worth the $8.99.  It is so good that no dressing is needed.  In addition to REALLY tasting good, I feel good about eating it!   I notice that they also have several other choices that I am looking forward to trying.  All of their burrito choices can also be made as salads.  They have also changed their burrito tortillas so that the tortillas themselves have fewer calories!!  The portion sizes are quite generous--the food is HEALTHY---locations are plentiful---Their free Boloco card is rewarding.  Check this place out.  I really cannot speak highly enough about Boloco.  (In addition, their employees are really cool and always pleasant!)    Also, it looks like they use almost all recyclable packaging!   Accrue additional savings when you pay for all purchases at Boloco using LevelUp: INSTANTLY get $5 FREE to spend at Boloco or any of their participating locations when signing up."},{"name":"High Tide Harry's","address":"4645 S Semoran Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Our second time here, left both times happy & full! Seated and served quickly. Great daily specials, we came for the Thursday special pick 2 seafood entrees & 2 sides for $20. Hubby & I both got the snow crab legs & steamed shrimp.

I had never been to a place where I got to try five, yes five, different kinds of meats and it was amazing. There is a good list to choose from including sausage, steak, ribs, chicken wrapped with bacon and pork tenderloin. Whatever meat you ask for, they will bring it. \\n\\nNot only was there delicious meat, but there were delicious side dishes to go with it, like caramelized bananas and garlic mashed potatoes and a delicious salad bar, complete with veggies, fruit, prosciutto, cheese, salmon, fruits and pasta salads. And if you couldn't get enough food, there is the cheesy bread, which was a big hit at our table and an amazing dessert menu (the caramelized pineapple is exquisite). The price is a little high, mainly because of the huge meal that you get, but it is definitely worth it. If you come to Fogo de Chao, come hungry."},{"name":"Turf N Surf Po' Boy","address":"407 Lavaca St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Liked this place a lot; great PO boys, good ambiance, great drinks.

I DO go back."},{"name":"Urban Farmer","address":"525 SW Morrison St, 8th Fl","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Steak is best I've ever had. It's pricey but so worth it.

There was no wait, which was good, but we were sat right next to the small stage and speakers. They were not in use when we sat down, but an hour later a live country musician began playing and we had a hard time talking over it.\\n\\nI went back and forth on what drink to order and the server led me down the right path when he recommended I try the watermelon Tom Collins. It came in a large glass and included large chunks of watermelon as well as middle cucumber and watermelon. It was not a cheap drink, but boy did I enjoy it!\\n\\nI went ahead and snacked on the charcuterie appetizer which was pretty steep but good ($16). It came with a few small buns and some assorted meat and spreads. It wasn't bad but also wasn't something to write home about.\\n\\nThe service was attentive- with the manager coming by to check on us a few times in addition to the server.\\n\\nNot a bad place for a drink, but not necessarily somewhere I'd go if I wasn't meeting someone in the hotel."},{"name":"Marco's Cafe & Espresso Bar","address":"7910 SW 35th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Just ate breakfast for lunch - YUMMY!!

My 6 seafood stuffed shrimp were mostly filled with soggy bread crumbs (not much seafood or texture) and the sweet potato goes were straight from the bag in the freezer...$22.  My wife's haddock plate was good...fish a little bit dry but overall a tasty dish with nice side of mixed steamed veggies.  We instinctively ordered mac-n-cheese for our 2 year old, only to realize when the bill came that a children's mac-n-cheese is $12...that is just too much for your run-of-the-mill restaurant.  The salad bar was not the best ever, but more than OK, especially as one your your sides.\\n\\nOverall we had a nice lunch, but left with the feeling that this place simply doesn't take much pride in its food and that it just feeds off of its location.\\n\\nTry it out if your like a nice harbor-side setting, but maybe stick to some of the basics or lunch specials that offer some sort of value."},{"name":"Hook Line & Schooner","address":"4600 W Village Pl, Ste 3009","city":"Smyrna","stars":"3.5","text":"So happy to have this place near my house.

New favorite place. A newbie getting acquainted with several confusing subtleties with menu offerings and options, and the waiter today seemed a little impatient.
