(In the immortal words of the Kim Cattrall, 'first come the gays...')\\n\\nAlas, no more Hindu beef burger (as mentioned in the review above), as they replaced the flat top grill with a tandoori oven.\\n\\nStill a no-frills, clean and calm atmosphere, but now with service. Our server was nice, efficient and obviously knowledgeable, and educated us about the difference between a korma and a durbari. \\n\\nI ordered the Kheema Masala ($10)--spiced ground lamb with onion, garlic, tomatoes, cilantro, potatoes, and sliced egg. My partner had the Shahi Durbari (with paneer; $10), an almond-cashew creamy pureed curry, analogous to a cream-based korma. You can also specify the heat level (I ordered mine extra spicy).\\n\\nHow should I put this? I've rarely had Indian food this FLAVORFUL and FRESH. More often that not, Indian food is either overly salted or way under-salted, to the point where either all you taste is a salty muddledness, or there isn't simply enough salt to bring out all the flavors of the spices. The lamb here was seasoned just right. I could actually FEEL the different flavors, distinct and clean, hit and pop in my mouth at different times, followed by the heat. (I hate it when, esp in Indian food, all the heat is up front and annihilates your palate immediately.) The difference here was they used both fresh ground spices (eg cardamom) AND whole spices together, so that you get the WHOLE flavor (and texture) profile of the spices. The meat itself was fluffy and not too greasy, and the scalloped Yukon gold potatoes were nicely caramelized on the outside, with a crunch.\\n\\nI had only the curry itself (not the paneer) in my partner's dish. Again, the same complexity of spices, and the cream wasn't too overwhelming (ahem - Claypit) and controlled the heat very well. You can taste it's ingredients selected, and food made with, love and care. \\n\\nMy only complaint is the portion-to-price ratio, but that may only be because I wanted and could've had a second plate of the lamb, without a problem. Both entrees came with a large bowl of cardamom/cloved basmati rice. And, they should serve tepid water by default, instead of ice-cold water. \\n\\nI'll definitely be back, especially to try the Kokum Curry drink.\\n\\nAlso, they give a discount for walk-in or bike-in customers.

Delicious!! Many spring rolls that I have had in restaurants taste like they could have easily been purchased from Costco and just thrown into a deep fryer, but not these. In these rolls, fresh green cabbage, delicate rice noodles, and bits of pork are wrapped in a skin that is more than just run-of-the-mill crispy--I'm talking about real crunch and texture, for which the best word to describe it may be \\"crackly\\". At any rate, linguistic limitations aside, I definitely would order this again! You get 2 rolls per order and a side of some sweet peanut sauce to go with!\\n\\nGreen curry with chicken: 4/5. Very tasty green curry, with still-crisp red bell peppers, spicy green peppers, basil, peas, bamboo slices, and of course chicken! The curry itself was just a tad too sweet for my taste, which is why I didn't award the full 5 stars for this food item, but of course that's personal preference. Comes with a generous portion of warm steamed rice!\\n\\nPad Thai with chicken: 4/5. Note that this place's pad thai normally comes with shrimp AND chicken, but you can certainly order it sans either item, as we did. Noodles were saucy, and tangy-sweet, without much of the strange funk that I've experienced elsewhere in Atlanta's Thai restaurants. I might agree with some other Yelpers who've claimed that Little Bangkok's pad thai is the best ITP, but grudgingly--this place's rendition was still a LITTLE too sweet for me. \\n\\nSERVICE: 5/5. There seems to be far too many wait staff for this tiny space, but somehow they make it work: I have never had my water refilled so many times in one meal. I do feel that we were kind of rushed; our empty plates were whisked away almost before we were really done with them.\\n\\nSummary: Very good choice for Thai food ITP, and relatively affordable as well! 2 entrees and an app for $25 pre-tip."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place used to be very good.

Perhaps it's because the three \\"eats\\" I tried- an eggplant dip, a spinach artichoke dip, and the baked brie- were all pretty lackluster.

Mind you another friend had just ordered a pitcher for himself because he had arrived late and he was told he could not have the pitcher bc we were being asked to leave by the manager.

I hadn't been to one in forever and their Chicken Critters sounded amazing. While waiting for a table, the $5 margaritas on special sounded so fantastic. A hostess brought us to our table in the bar which was filthy. They weren't still wiping it down, it was \\"clean\\" enough to seat us but the benches for us to sit on were disgusting. As the hostess was walking away, we had to ask her to clean it off. My husband stood waiting for a good 3 minutes for them to find rags to do so while I walked off to the ladies room. \\n\\nOur server Craig came by quickly to take our drink order which was great and sold us on the margaritas. As soon as he walked away, my husband unrolled his silverware and noticed a piece of rice stick to his \\"clean\\" fork. Pretty gross. Next time Craig came around we asked for a fresh fork (and so it begins). \\n\\nWe got our margs, put in our orders and still no fork. Our side salads came (my Caesar dressing had no taste-now i know why a random server asked 3 times during our meal if we needed more dressings or sauces -no flavor!). It was basically eating lettuce and cheese with water as dressing. \\n\\nWhile waiting for our meals, we noticed the hostess seating lots of small (3 years and under) kids in the bar. Just thought it was weird and maybe the bar is the place where you'd typically want to seat adults and not small kids. \\n\\nWhen our meals were delivered, my husband asked the guy delivering them for a fork. He said \\"sure\\", told NO ONE or made any attempt to get my husband a fork so he could eat his hot meal and continued delivering food to at least 5 other tables. Finally my husband flagged down one of the servers asking us if we needed sauce/dressings and told them it shouldn't take this many attempts to get a fork in a restaurant. We finally got one. \\n\\nOur food was ok. My chicken critters were soggy, my husbands country fried chicken was just loaded in gravy.  There was no point in saying anything because nothing really gets addressed in a timely fashion or resolved in this establishment.  Maybe we couldn't enjoy it because Craig was always hovering by our table throughout the whole meal yet he never took care of the one darn thing we asked him for off the bat. \\n\\nTwo stars because the $5 margarita was really darn good. But man, train your servers and your server assistants to be responsive if someone asks for something.

It is not actually in the city limits of Austin. There are locations in Round Rock, north of Austin, and the airport. However, Driftwood is home to the original and main location. It is surrounded by vineyards. I drove past it twice because I missed the sign although it was plenty big. At the time I ate at Salt Lick, it was the best barbecue I had ever had. Three days later, I tried Franklin's and it was better. Nevertheless, Salt Lick is an amazing barbecue joint. Moreover, you do not have to wait hours in line (i.e. Franklin's) to eat it. The restaurant is huge. There are multiple dining areas that are large halls. You see the barbecue pit in the front of the restaurant as soon as you enter. There are various combination plates and sandwiches. I decided to go with \\"Family Style\\" for $24.95, which is all you can eat beef brisket, sausage, pork ribs, potato salad, cole slaw, and beans.\\n\\nI made a rookie mistake of eating too much of the sides so I could not eat as much meat. However, they were delicious. The cole slaw was awesome: crispy, not too drenched, and a little sour with sesame seeds. The beans were also excellent. I usually do not like and avoid beans. However, they were vastly superior in Texas. The potato salad was good too. The complimentary bread was great. It was very soft and must have been made fresh in house. In terms of the main event (i.e. the meat), the ribs were my favorite. They were tender, moist, smoked, and glazed perfectly with a sweet marinade. It was also the one meat at Salt Lick that I thought was better than its counterpart at Franklin's. Next, the sausages were excellent. The meat is tender and juicy with crispy skin on the outside. The flavor was also a little sweet. In regards to the brisket, there were three parts to choose from: marble, lean, and burnt ends. The marble was definitely the best piece of the brisket. It was the piece the restaurant leaves in the pit the longest. It had great smoky flavor and was chewy. In addition, it had crunchy sides on the outside of tender meat that breaks apart in your mouth when you eat it. The lean was what the name implies. It was lean. Both marble and lean were dry and not moist. I tend to favor moist briskets (e.g. the fatty brisket at Franklin's). The last part of the brisket was the burnt ends. Naturally, they were rougher and tougher than the other two pieces of the brisket. Nevertheless, they had great smoky flavor. In terms of how the Family Style works, you order three cuts of meat at a time and they come in a small plate. When you are ready to order again, the next wave comes in another small plate. Since the small plates prevent you from eating significantly more than you can eat at the restaurant, Salt Lick allows to you to take leftovers home. The barbecue sauces were also good. One of them was sweet and tangy. The other was called spicy but was not all that spicy. Moreover, I recommend the sweet tea. It was very good although definitely a sugar bomb.\\n\\nIf you are visiting and planning a trip to Austin and looking for recommendations, feel free to message me for my itinerary.

I've experienced better,\\" is Yelp's two-star description and that is an accurate description of this place. Chambar is totally overrated especially considering the price point. To start, the cocktails were fine, nothing special. We ordered the poached shrimp as an appetizer and it was overpowered by way too much cumin seasoning. Weird decision. For the mains, I had the halibut which was overcooked and dry and was $35. My husband had the lamb and it wasn't braised long enough and was pretty gamey, also $35. We didn't bother with dessert. Given the hype and high ratings, I think it's fair to say I expected more. People too often get swept up in ambiance, but at the end of the day, ambiance is no substitute for poorly cooked food.

Partly because they validate parking for Parcel 7 (search for my review) and mostly because their food and service are great.\\n\\nThe same wait staff is always there when I go -- and they are always friendly and accommodating.  If you want to try an appetizer, for example, they'll make a smaller dish for you so that you don't have to order the full size.  \\n\\nMany of their menu items are cooked in a brick oven, including the pizza -- they are fantastic.  Try the baked gnocchi if you want to try something a bit different -- it's sort of like a baked ziti without meat, and with gnocchi instead of the ziti.\\n\\nOnly drawback is that they can squeeze tables together sort of tightly on the weekends, so that you're a bit too close to the table next to you.

Thank goodness I had a bit of cash in my wallet today. \\n\\nMemorize the picture of the outside of this restaurant before you go. I went with a friend, and we drove by it three times because my friend swore that the restaurant was only a painted, hipster Austin house while I (who studied this place carefully on yelp) argued that yes - this was indeed Lola's. \\n\\nWhen we walked in, his fears were not alieved. There was no host to seat us. People sitting at tables looked up and stared. We stood there looking awkward for 30 seconds until a voice yelled from the kitchen telling one of the guys to clear a table for us. Only then were we sure we were in a restaurant. \\n\\nYou know that a place like this with over a hundred reviews and such high ratings must be a no-nonsense, just-get-down-and-dirty-with-the-food type of place, and it was! The food was delicious. For everyone else in Austin to whom Cajun food is NOT \\"a taste of home\\" and soul food consists of fried chicken and oh-so-amazing barbecue, this food was delicious as just food. Is it authentic? I don't know. From the other reviews, it seems so. \\n\\nSo why only four stars? LOLA'S NO LONGER SERVES ALL YOU CAN EAT GUMBO ON FRIDAYS. Lola said that only one of her customers has ever finished more than one large pot of gumbo. However today, both him and I finished our large pots. I could've had half of another pot, and I'm only 99 lbs. Come on Austinites. \\n\\nThe gumbo has a very delicious, strong flavor. For those with weaker tastebuds, the gumbo might be a bit overpowering. I thought it was great. The chicken was incredibly tender.

None the less I followed my husband inside & ordered the Nambam chicken, it came with steamed rice, noodles & POTATO SALAD(?)! But it was really very good. The chicken had this vinegary sauce that danced all over your taste buds.. If know one else was there, I swear I would have lifted that plate to my mouth & slurped what remained left on the plate down into my belly! My husband had the udon soup which he liked but nothing spectacular.  We didn't eat any sushi which is not like us.. But I will say the sushi menu (& kitchen menu for that matter) is not very extensive. The service was good, & that chicken alone was worth the 4 stars.. I took a star away for ambiance cuz there is none in this little place. You would also think the prices would be a little cheaper.  I was deceived at first thinking \\"wow, only $4.25 for a spicy tuna roll\\"! But wait, there sushi only comes with 4 pcs. They have a happy hour where the sushi menu prices are almost half but it's for only 1 hr (5:30-6:30pm)!

We had a party of 8 and a 9 pm reservation, but weren't seated until 10 pm. On another visit we had a large party and a reservation, and were not seated for 2 hours. Both times, however, management was very generous in providing the table with multiple free tapas dishes. If you have a large party, then go in with the expectation that you will be seated later than your reservation.\\n\\nBarcelona is always packed and standing room by the bar is at a premium. Many patrons have to spill out the front door onto the sidewalk while waiting for their tables. After waiting for an hour past our reservation time, we were seated outside (in January). Luckily there are tons of heaters and blankets for guests to drape over their legs, otherwise it would have been absurd that they were seating so many people outside. If you are going to eat here in the winter, wear some layers in case you get seated outside \\n\\nNow on to the food! I apologize for the lack of pictures, but we were with a large group and I was afraid of being judged. Everything was absolutely delicious, per usual. The bread baskets came out piping hot, flaky and light. We quickly started ordering tapas and they came out in rapid succession. Meat and cheese plates, albondigas (meatballs), calimari, manchego and jamon croquettes (one of my favorites), mushrooms and herbed goat cheese, potato tortilla, patatas bravas, Brussels sprouts (highly recommend), butternut squash (excellent), braised short ribs. For dessert we had the churros (amazing) and the dulce de leche crepes. There was not a bad dish in the bunch! \\n\\nBar service was a tad slow, so seize the opportunity to order a drink even if you aren't ready. \\n\\nWe received a lot of free dishes due to excessive wait time, but the final bill split between 4 couples (including food and drinks) was only $55 pre tip per couple! \\n\\nI definitely recommend a visit to this amazing restaurant!"},{"name":"Row 34","address":"383 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Came here for Mother's Day and had a feast!

I was more than a little concerned that he would have to just settle on the least bad of the three bakeries we compared. Oh, that did not happen! Sweetish Hill's Italian cream cake was amazing! It seriously made the others taste like cupcake mix prepared in an Easy Bake. Sweetish Hill uses high quality ingredients and an amazing recipe; the resulting cakes are unsurpassed!  The black & white cake was equally delicious, but I felt like the Italian cream cake was my biggest challenge...it can go wrong in so many ways, but Sweetish Hill has it perfected. The cakes are competitively priced; the pricing is available on the Sweetish Hill website.\\n\\nLeila delivered and set up the cakes exactly as/when promised. They were gorgeous and they were amazingly moist - heavenly! The guests are still raving about the cakes. I will definitely order future cakes exclusively from Sweetish Hill."},{"name":"Tian Fu","address":"446 Washington St","city":"Wellesley","stars":"3","text":"Our further experience (4 more visits accompanied by different friends and relatives) confirms our initial review."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The pizza here is really great.

The Porter puts a very visible effort into crafting a draft list to satisfy all craft beer lovers taste. Bud Light drinkers need not apply.  They always keep a good mix of stouts, porters, IPAs, etc on tap.  They also make a conscious effort to support the local breweries and keep them on tap.

In addition to the draft list they also have a very impressive bottle lists with some stellar vintages of you want to go that route.  The list goes on for days.  \\n\\nLiquor.

That should have been a sign... \\n\\nSo we sit down & I kid you not we wait 20 minutes for someone to even acknowledge & we had to eventually call someone over to place our order for Drinks & Food... So right away my little Yelp Lovin Mind is rolling at what my review is going to say... \\n\\nWater comes 10 mins later & one of my coworkers ordered an ice tea - it was at least 20 mins before they brought that (still no food keep in mind) \\n\\nWe sat at about 1230 - its now around 110-115 and the Mgr notices we have been sitting there & walks over & gives us the \\"Im sorry line\\" he then walks away comes back with Bread & the Chick Pea spread as a Peace Offering  (at first I thought this was great, but I have read in other reviews that COMES with the meal or as a starter) so I somewhat lost love for that gesture! \\n\\nFood finally comes: \\n\\nGarlic Shrimp - was literally SIZZLING... It was very tasty - Shrimp could be better as also stated by other reviews, but that wont stop me from ordering again (Im a big Garlic Fan)\\n\\nGoat Cheese (I didnt try - not a fan) but others said it was delish - I just was a little miffed that it was just CHEESE, No Bread, No crackers - are you just to eat it with a spoon...

Although it's just down the road from us, we've never been able to get there.  If this place is open, it's packed! There's a good reason for that; this is simply the best pizza I've ever had outside of Italy!  Everything I had heard about this place was word of mouth, and all the rumors were true.  This is truly authentic pizza. Giovanni, the owner/chef brought his ovens from Naples, and makes his own dough with imported ingredients, and it shows.\\n\\nIf you've never been here, be aware, the place is small with very little seating. It is very common to see people standing in the parking lot eating pizza. Which leads me to another thought, the parking lot is tiny!  You'll probably need to park on the street. The dining room is comprised of a few tables in the kitchen.  It's also important to note that this restaurant is BYO Alcohol.\\n\\nWe had the Diavola, which was so delicious.  It has roasted red peppers, pepperoni, and mozzarella cheese. Of course, the proper way to describe these toppings is spicy sopressata, pepperonata, and bufala.  The dough here is simply the best.  This is pizza done right.  Cheese is not supposed to dominate a slice of pizza, it should be just topping like everything else, and it's just right at Antico. The crust is thin and but the edges have just the right amount of texture thanks to the stone ovens.\\n\\nMy only complaint is the service.  Maybe it's just because they are also so busy, but the girls at the counter seem a bit arrogant.  It almost felt Soup-Nazi like ordering here.  Once, I tried to call in an order and they were so busy they just eventually hung up on me.

(NOTE: The pizza is the closest thing to imagining yourself in Italy eating pizza... it is THAT DELICIOUS!) Okay the first thing you might notice when you walk is is that people are carrying bottles of wine or kicking a 12-pack of craft beer between their legs as they wait to order their food. It is BYOB so there is no excuse for you not to enjoy the beverage list :P. The dining area is an extention of the kitchen because you are sitting at communal tables just feet away from the Dough Room (where they roll out the dough for the pizzas), the 3 authentic Italian ovens that are pumping out pizzas every second, and the massive amount of employees that are flying around the kitchen preparing the pizzas. There is loud Italian music playing in the background. This is easily another one of my \\"Must Take Out of Towners\\" as the food is incredible and the atmosphere is tons of fun. While some might think the $20+ pizza is pricey... you get what you pay for! Look around the kitchen and see the ingredients they are using.

My date and I are both fans of fine dining - I expected an expensive tab for the evening, but felt the food was very overpriced.  We had tuna tartar as an appetizer, our favorite dish of the night.  I chose the scallops for my entree and was disappointed - for a $35 price tag, there weren't many scallops on the plate, they weren't terribly flavorful, and the pork belly didn't seem integrated into the dish at all - I mistakenly took a bite of pork belly because I thought it was a scallop and almost gagged at the jarring juxtaposition of flavors.  My date had the lamb loin, which he enjoyed, but wasn't raving about.  We had a lovely bottle of wine, recommended by the knowledgeable and affable Wine Director, but found the other staff members not to know much about the restaurant's food and drink particulars.  Our server was polite but her answers to our menu questions were vague.  When we finished dinner, we headed to the bar for an additional drink.  Again, the bartender was very sweet, but couldn't articulate much about the wine selection.  I very much enjoyed LAH's artistic ambiance - if anything, it's worth a visit just to see the giant mural painted behind the bar and the AMAZING photographic doors on stalls in the women's bathroom.

And while the food is solid, there are a couple things I did not like. The meats themselves are solid. Sausage and pork ribs were delicious, while the brisket wasn't anything outstanding (maybe because I didn't go the moist route). Like other reviews have stated the sides leave a little to be desired, although the potato salad was excellent. My biggest dislike is their sauce.

We usually just call them ahead of time and grab our food as takeout, and they're good about taking orders on the phone (they've never messed up). I'm especially a fan of their spicy tuna, chicken teriyaki, and yam tempura rolls: that's my standard combo for the $6.95 deal! If you're looking for a tempura roll, I would definitely recommend the yam tempura over the salmon one; the crunch ratio (yes, I will use that phrase) is more even for the yam tempura rolls."},{"name":"Papa John's Pizza","address":"2151 Savoy Drive","city":"Chamblee","stars":"2","text":"For a chain pizza restaurant, this location is OK.\\n\\nI wish they were more consistent with their food.

We consulted Yelp and all three of our wishes came true with Pio Pio. It was just a short drive away and although our GPS directions were really accurate, I was grateful that some other Yelp reviewers mentioned that the location of this restaurant is easy to miss. It is in a rather non-descript shopping plaza that has no name that was noticeable to me, and it is on the less obvious end of the plaza.\\n\\nWe felt ok about entering this restaurant in our theme park clothes, but people in dressier apparel will feel at home as well. Seating is spacious and the smallish dining room is welcoming and serene. Background music is an appropriate level and sets a nice tone for the meal.\\n\\nOur server was efficient and helpful. My husband and I ordered an appetizer to share. It was a delicious sausage accompanied by a corn cake and tomato slices.\\n\\nUpon my inquiry, our server recommended the skirt steak entree and her suggested doneness was also on target. There was a choice of ripe or green plantains as part of the plate and when I expressed ambivalence about choosing, she offered a split of some of each, which was perfect. The entire plate of food-- a large piece of skirt steak cooked medium well, the mixed side of plantains, a cup of red beans and a healthy serving of rice-- was delicious. My husband had most of the same items but had 1/4 of a rotisserie chicken instead of the steak. He was also very happy with his meal.\\n\\nWe ordered and shared two desserts: tres leches and flan. We liked both a lot; I had a slight preference for the flan, but only because it was possibly the best flan I have ever had.\\n\\nIn all, a perfect end to a fun-filled day.

I found it tacky how their waiting section is nothing but a huge marketplace for their tshirts and overpriced concessions. \\nAlso, thank goodness there is a ATM since it is cash only. I love how the ATM tells you the Salt Lick charges $2.50 for using their ATM. Way to avoid paying merchant fees to the credit card companys but still continuing to profit off the customers. Between the $2 water bottles and ATM fees, I was already annoyed and we hadn't even walked into the restaurant. \\nSo we finally sit. Rustic atmosphere, friendly staff. Tip don't wear a skirt. It's hard to be lady like with a skirt on while trying to get on the pinic table bench. \\nMy boyfriend and I each order the meat plate with pork ribs, sausage, and brisket for $11.00 each. What we each got was a plate 3/4 full of beans, potato salad, and cole slaw with one rib, one piece of brisket and a half a sausage link. Really???? What a rip!!! And it wasn't even that good. It's sweet BBQ which is ok but I'm partial to a nice spicy dry rub. \\nI only ate the beans which were average and the potato salad and cole slaw remained untouched. \\nSo it took us five minutes to eat our small portion and seeing as how we were both still hungry, we ordered some pecan pie with blue bell vanilla ice cream. This was much better than the rest of our meal. \\nSo two drinks, two meat plates, and dessert set us back $35, which is average but we both left still hungry. \\nWe should have just gone to Rudy's where for that price we would have had tons of leftovers and a tank of gas.

Cupcakes: Surly has its signature red velvet cupcake daily as well as a uniquely crafted cupcake du jour. The cupcake we tried was a maple syrup bacon cupcake that featured a french toast flavored cupcake with maple syrup frosting and bacon sprinkles. If you think that sounds gross then you are either too vegetarian to appreciate such a beautiful thing or are just too boring to try something that could broaden your horizons.

(The line would eventually become incredibly long; Yum√© was easily the most popular cart at the event.)\\n\\nI'm an incredibly visual person (with fashion, since birth; but these days, I entertain a growing predilection to quite fussily stage my food for photographs), so naturally whichever one of their selections that had the fried egg and was featured so prominently on their marketing immediately caught my eye. Reading the menu, I discovered this item is called the japajam, which includes an all-beef hamburger, Japanese tomato jam, jalapeno jack cheese, fried egg, Japanese BBQ sauce, and crispy onion strings. Dear God, yes. The only thing that could possibly had made this better would be a side of sweet potato fries. Which they offer, with a side of wasabi mayo. At that point, I was already mentally jamming out to the thought of my japajam. \\n\\nThe burger was hot, fresh, and a veritable melting pot of flavors. The egg yolk broke and mixed beautifully with the sweet barbecue sauce and tomato jam. The crunch of the onion strings added another layer of texture, and I was in heaven (or, let's say whatever it is the Shinto believe is Heaven, to keep with the theme). The fries were excellent--with or without the hot wasabi mayo dipping sauce--and they were giving my favorite sweet potato fries over at The Black Sheep Lodge a serious run for their money.\\n\\nOne thing to note: The burger is on the messy side, but with all that going on, honestly--who cares? I know my face was probably slathered in Japanese BBQ sauce and frankly, if anyone had a problem with that, they could go do you-know-what to themselves. I was having fun. \\n\\nOne more thing to note; This burger was under $6 bucks. I've had fast food burgers, and I've had burgers costing over $50...but in the end, the japajam at Yum√© Burger makes the list as one of the best. It just so happens to be a great value, too. \\n\\nThe line grew exponentially long as time went on. Whereas when I joined it was just another stop among the several carts, those looking to get their Yum√© on would have to stand for who knows how long, because either its reputation preceded itself, or word of mouth had spread that this was one of the best foods to try at the festival. Either way, I doubt I'm alone in my new found love.\\n\\nI'd like to conclude by revealing I did not know that Eric from The Peached Tortilla is also co-founder of Yum√© Burger. I swear this city is so small. But I can't say I'm surprised. I met Eric (who is very cool), and was treated to his amazing culinary prowess during a food battle with Roll On Sushi Diner. I can definitely see and taste the similarities between the two carts. On their website, it explains that \\"Whereas the Japanese adopted and re-created the American hamburger, he [Eric] seeks to now adopt the Japanese hamburger and introduce it to Austin. Throughout the development of Yum√© Burger, Eric has found himself reconnecting with the flavor combinations that bring back childhood memories.\\" \\n\\nAll I can say to that is...THANK YOU. \\n\\n4 Stars."},{"name":"Cibo e Beve","address":"4969 Roswell Rd, Ste 245","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Three of us went for dinner tonight.

We went to celebrate his birthday, and when I was making the reservation on Open Table (which was incredibly easy and I highly recommend it -- you don't even need to set up an account!), they asked what the occasion (if any) was for the meal. I wrote in that it was a birthday, and then they sent my boyfriend an email telling him that if he printed out the email that he would get a complimentary champagne cocktail and dessert ($21 value!!). \\n\\nSo we came in and were seated. I was a little annoyed that despite the fact that I had made a reservation, they gave us a table in a part of the restaurant that I would not consider ideal or suitable for a birthday dinner -- we were right by the busy walkway, right behind the handicap ramp! It was too busy so we couldn't get another table, but for the money we're paying and booking in advance I don't really find that acceptable treatment. Besides this, though, service was excellent and attentive, and not only did my lovely get a complimentary cocktail, but he also got to choose any dessert from the menu on the house! Craigie is not one of those restaurants that gives you some random not-even-on-the-menu free dessert - they actually let you have what you want for free when it's your birthday. Sweet. \\n\\nWe shared the fois gras served with a persimmon puree, candied pistachios, and two slices of toasted brioche; lamb three ways (loin, belly, and sausage), and the arctic char fish with fresh shrimp and mussels in a serrano ham broth; my lovely chose the profiteroles with banana ice cream and valrhona chocolate sauce as his free birthday dessert. They also gave us a truck load of house bread, which was amazing -- my boyfriend loved the sweet toasted sesame rolls; the sourdough-type bread was really yummy, too, and the butter was super creamy with just the right saltiness. The fois gras was really good, very creamy, but I've had pate before that was just as good and not that pricey. The lamb was a real highlight, especially the lamb belly -- not as fatty as pork belly, and cooked perfectly. The fish (cooked sous vide, so a little on the raw side) was good, but not anything amazing -- I really liked the mussels that came with it, though. They were incredibly fresh and tasted just like the sea.The profiteroles were really good, maybe a little bit too overpowered by the chocolate sauce, but the banana ice cream was very banana-y, and the profiteroles were nice and light the way they should be. \\n\\nI went to Craigie when they were still at the original location, and I must say that the quality of the food is the same (which is a positive thing) and the service is still good -- not as formal as it was at the Craigie Street location, but more low-key, which is what I'd personally prefer. The decor is also more modern here as opposed to being on the fancy side like it was before. Like other reviewers have noted, it's nice that they let you know what time they printed the menus to reflect how fresh their food is; I love this place, and I love how generous they are with their \\"birthday gift\\" to you.

My brother ordered the fish (can't remember the name of it) that was on the menu for the night and when it came out it was the size of a golf ball...and it had about 12 peas spread out around it.

No rice or beans.  Dry and uninteresting.  My husband had fish tacos which he said were very good.  My son had a fajita-like dish which he said lacked spice.

I traded my frites with him though I didn't care for the poutine either. The mussels were good, but not \\"wow\\" or anything. I liked the lardons best...I couldn't finish because I got full. Too much for an appetizer for one person!\\n\\nWe were seated by the windows in the back and the restaurant was LOUD! I never really notice things like this, but it really bothered me this evening. It really hampered my dining experience.\\n\\nFor main courses, my son ordered the Le fletan et queue de beouf which was sesame crusted halibut, crispy oxtail rice cake, mustard ginger & yuzu glaze, micro shiso. I ordered the Lamb Tagine: Braised lamb shank with honey, figs, cinnamon & cilantro, served with cous cous and zalouk.\\n\\nWe were both really full so only had a couple of bites before packing it in.

Because we didn't order dessert, no Happy Birthday sentiments were wished or acknowledged. The bill came after that and she didn't even say happy birthday to him. I just thought for a $180 bill, they could have made a little more of an effort to acknowledge his birthday. A dessert amuse or something!\\n\\nBecause of the loudness, the price and the birthday treatment, I won't be returning soon. I'm sorry it turned out disappointing.

I've been here only 9,789,789 times and I've never had a bad experience.  The staff are always soooo kind, the atmosphere is lively and fun, and the food and drinks are sooooooooo good.  Anytime someone mentions coming here for anything...I'm 1000% there already.\\n\\nLocated in the heart of the N. Highland shops district (not sure if that's what it called but sounds good), you'll find a cute little spot on the corner with plenty of seating outside (including a bar, a fireplace, and space to lounge and have an outdoor mix & mingle event) andddd no need to stress about parking (street parking is usually hard to find depending on the time of day) because there's valet.  I've always loved the decor and the layout of the restaurant and just feel fancy when I walk in the door for some reason.\\n\\nDuring this visit, I came for a birthday celebration and I our group was seated as soon as we walked in and greeted by our waitress who was ready to handle a group of women ready to have a fun Thursday night dinner.  The drink menu is full of yummy cocktails and an extensive wine list but I'll admit, I'm a sucker for the red sangria.  It's so bad that I don't even look at the drink menu because I'm here for the sangria.  Needless to say we started with a pitcher of it and ordered just about everything from the tapas menu.\\n\\nMy fav tapas are the...\\n\\n1. Gambas - The shrimp is served in a cast iron skillet and covered with herbs and some type of heavenly sauce.  Delish!\\n\\n2.  Ham and cheese croquets - Sounds simple but the ooooooey goodness of these little fried balls just put me out every time.  Like how can I make these at home?!\\n\\n3.  Patatas Bravas - Simple. Seasoned. Potatoes.  They're served hot and with some sauce that can be a little much but I don't care.  It's good.\\n\\n4.  Hanger steak - I've only had this a few times but order it.  You'll enjoy it.\\n\\n5.  Meatballs - like they come straight from someone's grandmas kitchen.  Made with all the love.\\n\\nBarcelona is amazing and I love everything about this place.

Upon arrival we noted a huge vineyard....it could have been there forever but we hadn't realized it. The property is huge. \\nThey have a beautiful pavilion that can be leased for your next event, on the property , and I'm sure they will cater barbeque over there. \\nWe noted there are wine cellars and signs for tastings. That will be another time for sure as the guests who are coming off their tours into the restaurant seemed extremely happy, and carried large coolers so must've done a lot of tasting and buying. It just added to the holiday atmosphere. \\nAt this location they have table service. They have plenty of staff available to monitor every table constantly. Don't misunderstand, that doesn't mean they're interrupting or hovering over you but there are waitstaff just going up and down the long aisles observing to see if anyone has any needs, drinks, dessert, boxes, or just to answer any question.\\nThe barbecue, the barbecue, the barbecue!\\nYou know I like barbecue, but this barbeque was lovable. My husband had the rib plate and didn't leave a drop of meat on those bones... I had the pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw. \\nEven though it is described as having coleslaw on it the server made sure that was the way I wanted it when I ordered it. \\nI was able to make it a lunch plate and have a serving of the potato salad, coleslaw, and beans right along with it, on one of their little compartmentalized plates.\\nThat pulled pork was fabulous!!!!\\nThey have dispensers of sauce on every table so you have their sweet sauce and they're sweet and spicy sauce available and I loved the fact they don't put sauce in their pulled pork. \\nIt's all meat....you add your own sauce! The smoke flavour on the pork was perfect. I've eaten a lot of barbeque and honestly this is the first time I was enamoured so by the smoke. \\nYou've got to try it!\\nI found the potato salad excellent because it has some of that nice sweet, tangy, barbecue sauce in it, making it kind of an unusual colour and so delicious. \\nThe coleslaw, what was a stand out, it did not have a strong cabbage flavor-if you enjoy coleslaw you know what I mean! \\nMany slaws (you can tell) come out of a large bag of chopped slaw and I think they may grate it core and all -because who can tell. \\nThe coleslaw here was deviated sizes of shreds, the cabbage a mild flavour and consistently dressed with an oil and vinegar style dressing which to be honest is my favorite coleslaw dressing to make and eat. \\nNot over done, just enough to make it tasty.\\nThe beans were, well, bbq style beans, and the only thing I found average. \\nThe bread is more of a seeded roll and stands up better than traditional butter crust sandwich bread. My sandwich came on it, but it is served on the side as well for those that ordered barbeque plates. A plate of dill pickle spears and onions also appears with your meal.  \\nAs for dessert-I literally forced myself to stop at half of my lunch so that I wouldn't feel too bad about ordering dessert.\\nThey have four options, peach cobbler, blackberry cobbler, pecan pie, and chocolate pecan pie. You can get a generous scoop of bluebell on any of them.\\nI had a discussion with the waiter as I was struggling between the peach and the blackberry cobbler. \\nI thought I ordered the BlackBerry but ended up with peach in front of me, with a nice scoop of ice cream on it and since we had that conversation and I honestly am not sure that I did clearly say I wanted the BlackBerry, (as I'm sure they would've switched it out). I chose to eat it instead. Good decision. The hubby who doesn't eat desserts actually was so enticed he picked up the second spoon they had brought with it and started dipping in. He remarked on how delicious the cobbler portion is, perfectly spiced, soft and just plain delicious. \\nSo we both enjoyed that immensely. Surprise!!! I ordered a slice of the Chocolate Pecan Pie to go and although I have not enjoyed it yet I plan to  today. I have no doubt it will be delicious!\\nWe happened to be out in the Dripping Springs area and my son had suggested we stop there for lunch.... but don't wait until you're out in the area, head out that way and make it your destination. \\nIt's definitely worth the drive!"},{"name":"Burger King","address":"5513 N E Gher Rd","city":"Vancouver","stars":"1.5","text":"VERY slow umm fast food hello 15 min is not fast, oh and chewy grilled chicken!

I found out about Pure's special through Creative Loafing's blurb in their food events section. However that's the only mention I've seen of it. That should be something they promote - there was no mention of it by our server when we ordered, (we called the restaurant prior to double check), anywhere in the restaurant,  on the menu, or on the website. So now you know - $2 Taco Tuesdays at Pure.\\n\\nLike many Mexican restaurants we were brought complimentary chips and salsa; they were pretty standard. We killed the salsa. Quick. And our server kindly brought us a new bowl when she noticed. \\n\\nThough I said that we here for tacos, some of the specials on the menu piqued my interest. I decided to try the \\"vieiras salteadas\\" - their scallops entree with fresh avocados in a chipotle tomato broth. Sounds delicious right? In actuality - meh. The scallops were very chewy. I didn't like the broth either, it was a hodgepodge of soggy mushrooms and corn bits that was more salty than spicy. I did really like the avocados (sprinkled with cheese) atop the scallops, I wish the dish was just those components. I also snuck a taste of a few of the boyfriend's tacos and they were decent. I've definitely had better for cheaper though - which is what basically sums up how I feel about this place: Okay Mexican food at jacked up prices.

My wife used that opportunity to ask about the sauce that came with the Rattlesnake bites, saying we did not taste any of the horseradish. Our waitress then let us know that some of her previous customers had complained about the sauce being too spicy, so she just started bringing everyone ranch dressing instead. This might be the first time we've had a wait person make this kind of decision, without consulting anyone, especially us. We would have rather had the sauce intended and designed for the appetizer.\\n\\nAs it was free, we figured we shouldn't make a big deal about it and quietly paid our bill and left, but it still kinda left a bad (ranch flavored) taste in my mouth...\\n\\nSo, as a tip to all wait people, please make sure to talk to your customers before making random changes to the food ordered or, how about just bringing the exact items we ordered?\\n\\nThanks"},{"name":"McCormick & Schmick's Seafood Restaurant","address":"401 Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Fresh, delicious food in an elegant (but not stuffy) setting.

The saltiness of the prosciutto and parmesan worked well with the peppery crunch of arugula, roasted nuttiness of the almond butter, and the sweetness of the apricot compote. AT got the mac and cheese and I opted for the roasted brussels sprouts. The mac and cheese was fantastic, wonderfully creamy and perfectly seasoned, topped with more cheese and finished off in the oven to give the final product a melty crown with slightly crunchy edges. This was a classic done right, made with beer and good ol' cheddar cheese. My brussels were roasted just like I like them, with slightly burnt with crisp layers.\\n\\nAT doesn't love sweets (especially chocolatey stuff) generally, but he still tells me to this day that the very best brownie he's ever had is the warm brownie you can get here.

The Negroni was nothing special (decent, but not memorable), but the Martini was a delight! The blue cheese was served as a \\"chaser\\" to the Fig Martini - wonderful pairing! \\n\\nThe cheese plate was fantastic - well balanced assortment of soft and hard cheeses. I didn't catch the specific names of most of them, but each was paired with a delicious condiment ranging from preserves to pickled apple slices. Mid-way through the cheese plate, our server brought out an impossibly smooth house-made sherbet that restored our palate between cheeses. \\n\\nThe Salade D'hiver, with roasted beets, confit sunchokes, burrata, basil & pistachio pesto, lemon vincotto, and fresh pomegranate, had very well balanced flavours and perfect proportions. While appearing too small to share, it ended up being a great size for two and a refreshing palate cleanser before the entr√©es (the sherbet didn't last past the cheese!). \\n\\nThe Manhattan steak was nicely seasoned and paired beautifully with the Stilton & Madeira butter (definitely a favourite!). The celeriac puree, picked watercress, and sun-dried tomato jus with capers all combined for very flavourful bites. We ordered the steak medium, which was too well-done in hindsight. The server had assured us it was so well marinated that ordering it done a bit more than usual would be fine. If I were to order it again, I would go with my usual medium-rare. \\n\\nWe wrestled between the Pastilla and Lamb Tajine (Tajine D'aziz √Ä L'agneau) for the second entr√©e to share and ended up going with the Lamb (highly recommended by the server, for good reason).

I ultimately just ordered a bottle of Sangria Senorial, but there are at least three categories of different types of juice drinks they make, each with various flavors of its own, then all the somewhat standard Mexican bottled soda options, Jarritos (5 or 6 flavors), the Sangria, Mexican Coke (real cane sugar) and a few others. Crazy drink options.\\n\\nAlso, I was wrong about the fish. Or if there was pescado last fall, there definitely isn't right now.

Asked her or Satchko for 2  cucumber rolls since the owner sushi maker returned my 2 rice rolls ordered avocado and got rice rolls with a dot of avocado in there literally. \\nshe looked like she was writing it down.   When the bill came i asked where my cucumber rolls were after I ordered them from one of the 2 ladies that came over.  they were not written on the pink paper.  you should have told me to write it on the pink paper.  I just returned to my house, starving.  The most uncool, lack of service, lack of communication place.   You hire waitress or a waiter that speaks English, and Japanese that can communicate with you Aki.  Or you tell them I returned the avocado or rice roll as it had no Avocado in there and ask them to let me order something else, or you can remake it with more avocado as there was practically none in that roll.   As the guys were done eating and ready to go the waitress, Suzanne who never ever once checked on us during the meal offered to have Aki make the cucumber rolls.  I did not want to have them wait for me to eat, and did not want to eat by myself.  I sat a over 90 minutes while they were eating and no one came by the wait staff is not at all trained, or they just do not care.  And the owner when he took back the rolls did not offer to make them right. Very Grumpy as I left starving.  Moonfish, Amura much better customer service and I do not work at either of those restaurants."},{"name":"The Proper Pie Company","address":"145 Ridge Center Dr","city":"Davenport","stars":"4.5","text":"This is well worth the visit. the Fish and Chips are made to order with REAL chips (not the frozen kind!!).. the pies are all handmade and there is a large selection of flavors (including Pasties and 'desert' pies).. there is also a selection of British 'goodies'..."},{"name":"Tapatio Mexican Restaurants","address":"18615 SW Farmington Rd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"If your food is going to blow harder than a high priced whore, at least make your drinks strong so that I can swallow the garbage.\\n\\nI do not expect a place with cheesy Mexican decor to be authentic.

Luscious looking combos, mouth watering margaritas. \\n\\nSadly, pictures are deceiving and I would have literally preferred to eat a polaroid picture over the poor excuse for caldo de pollo they served.

I only busted out the extra star because the waitress was sweet, comped my soup and was overall attentive. \\n\\n If this place blew this hard in making a soup that is easier than preparing a bag of .39 cent top ramen, I am afraid to know what other disasters they are cooking up in the kitchen.\\n\\nFat Americans in the burbs are calling this \\"fine Mexican dining?\\" This isn't authentic, this isn't even Americanized authentic.

Bad decision. When we arrived the restaurant  was not very busy. We were sat promptly and waited a solid 20 min before anyone even acknowledged we were there. We did not meet our server until 30 minutes after sitting down when he brought our bread. Our appetizers came with our salads so the table was crowded and I had to remind our server we ordered drinks we still hadn't recieved and for forks and a spoon for the soup. I had to ask for my water to be refilled every time. Dishes were not cleared well. Service was just bad all around bc our server would just  disappear, unless he was bringing out food from the kitchen. During our meal there were 2 complaints from neighboring tables. One never recieved the wine they ordered, and were looking for the check while our server was MIA yet again. The other was making a formal complaint to the manager bc on top of poor service, their food was incorrect and not cooked well after sending it back once already.\\n\\nThe food was also subpar especially for the price. Arugula (which coincidentally was on everything) all wilted and very sad looking. The duck cheese cracker pizza thing was awful. Salty and hard to chew. The grapes were  dry and bruised like they had been sliced days ago and left in an open container in the fridge. Escargot was very chewy and tasted  mostly like butter and breadcrumbs. The warm beat salad was the most disappointing salad of my life. Not warm. Beats sliced paper thin, maybe a total of 6 slices. What's worse is parts of the beats were so dry they stuck to the plate. Wilted arugula and an over blended \\"vinaigrette\\" that had a consistency more akin to mayonaise. An 11$ salad. My main course wasn't bad but I had the beef bourgingnon with carrots and potatoes, a hard one to mess up. \\n\\nDisappointing all around especially since I love the one in the city.

I've been avoiding the place since I heard about it in college as it sounded like it has slowly devolved from a unique Boston eatery into just another Boston pizza chain since it's founding in '01.  But, as is my excuse for so many things these days, I found myself thinking last night: \\"Living on Beacon Hill gives me the strongest urge to force someone else to do my cooking while i stare haughtily out the window of my 6th-floor apartment. I wonder why.\\" And thus, pizza was ordered.\\n\\nThe instant I dialed up the Beacon Hill location, a guy answered the phone and shouted \\"HiUpperCrustpleaseholdthanks\\", and then I heard a click and I wasn't sure if I was actually on hold or if he'd hung up on me. A whopping 8 minutes later, a woman finally answered the phone and took my order, although she sounded about as distracted as the first guy was, so I'm rather impressed she got it all right on the first try. Now, I understand they are popular, but it was 7 pm on a Monday night, and I've never in my life been put on hold for 8 minutes when calling in for delivery before.  Added to that was a hasty \\"it'll be there within an hour\\" tacked on to the end.  I can only assume 20 minutes was tacked on to that to allow time to ride a food-laden bike up the steep side of Beacon Hill.\\n\\nAbout 50 minutes later, my pizza arrived and i was ready to dig in. But to my infinite dismay, the poor thing had been cut 100 different ways, and each slice was about as wide as a breadstick and almost as long. Now, this might work for any normal pizza, but when you have a 1mm-thick crust, you expect a certain amount of girth to your slices, so you can lift/fold one without it flopping all over the place and losing all its toppings.  Which is what happened. Repeatedly. I won't bore you with the remaining details of this miserable experience, but I can tell you that I won't be ordering from Upper Crust again any time soon."},{"name":"Flour Bakery + Caf√©","address":"12 Farnsworth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I come here after the discounted day at the Children's Museum sometimes and it really caps off a wonderful night.

Now honestly I have never had a Papa John's pizza in my life. I see the commercials all the time and they look ok but they were not very big in southeast Michigan, however here in Austin it's a different story.\\n\\nNow Papa John's is supposed to be the best of a bad bunch. I picked up a large pie with pepperoni and extra cheese for $8.99. After the kid docked the shit out of the pizza and put some of those 'better ingredients' on it, he threw into the assembly line they call an oven.  I don't care what anyone says, a conveyer oven does not bake correctly enough to get a nice crunch and chew. I get my pizza after about 15 minutes and at first glance it reminded me of an old dominos pizza, just how the cheese had a weird melt and a lot of little brown bubbles. I also didn't like how the pizza had no crust on it, for hand pressed dough it lacked some crumb as well. While eating the first slice I am trying to keep an open mind and be fair with it. Initial tasting reminded me of when Little Ceasers was at the top of their game in the 80's and early 90's. It had a nice fresh taste but it was nothing special. The cheese had very little flavor, the pepperoni was barely noticeable and the sauce was just about as generic as shit you can buy at the grocery store.\\n\\nEven though the slogan is \\"better pizza, better ingredients\\" that doesn't mean they are using the best ingredients, then again they are probably just using better ingredients than Pizza Hut, Little Ceasers and Dominos. I will give them that, I think I would prefer a pizza from them over the other big chains. I don't think I would return again though.

The green machine is such a unique roll with a bit of spice, sweetness, crunch and creaminess. After having it once I now crave it all the time.

They are big (8 slices per pizza), and the crust is the perfect blend of crispiness and dough that just melts in your mouth. \\n\\n2) There are no substitutions allowed - what you see on the menu is what you get on your pizza.\\n\\n3) The restaurant itself has a very old school vibe, with an open kitchen (check out the pizza ovens they brought over from Italy), a dough room, and Italian soccer playing on the TV.\\n\\n4) The restaurant sells a few different drinks, but you can also BYOB.\\n\\n5) The pizzas aren't cheap and the bill can add up quickly. \\n\\n6) If you are looking for pizzas to try, then these are a must: margherita, pomodorini, diavolo, and lasagna.

The fresh basil that they top most pizzas with is to die for. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe dining experience: \\n\\n1) There is always a line at Antico - be prepared to wait!\\n\\n2) The seating at Antico is what stresses me out the most!!

Giacomo's is one of the most popular places in the North End, if not THE most popular place. You always find a line out the door. Well after a year in Boston living in the North End (eating at better restaurants), we decided to eat here again. I always liked the chicken marsala and the atmosphere. \\n\\nI'm downgrading my review from a 4 star to a 1 star. The food is above average, yes, it's overrated, and it's certainly NOT good enough to tolerate such snotty service. The tone we experienced by this woman tonight was downright nasty. Interestingly, tonight I read another review from this month also complaining about the mean waitress. Yes, she successfully ruined our dinner and I have no desire to eat at a place that sets this kind of tone. It completely kills the local Italian vibe. \\n\\nI know I live in Boston and that rudeness is simply the currency of social exchange here, but when you're running a restaurant, you can't be downright mean to your customers and then expect them to 1) not complain about it on Yelp and 2) ever return to your restaurant again. \\n\\nHere is why I'm downgrading my review for Giacomo's: \\n\\nI was waiting in line (mind you on a very hot day) and the slightly older woman came out to write down how many people are in each party. There were a couple of larger parties ahead of me, and no one behind me. She took down our information on her notepad. After she left, another party of two showed up awhile later. \\n\\nWell 15 minutes later, the lady comes back out and says that a 2-person table is open, and announced the next party of two. That was us, obviously. \\n\\nWe insisted to her \\"that's us!\\" as my husband held the number 2 up with his fingers to also indicate that we were next. I kid you not, this woman goes for a beeline to the couple behind us and doesn't even look at us. It's as if they had some of kind special status or reservation, or she had some kind of innate reason to want to skip over us. \\n\\nBut then I remembered, this place DOESN'T take reservations. The folks in front of us in line were also a little perplexed about what just happened, but we scratched our heads trying to figure out why this woman deliberately ignored us and sat the couple that arrived 15 minutes after we did. \\n\\nShe hurriedly rushed the couple behind us inside so fast that when we yelled to her for like the fifth time \\"we have two, we're next!\\" she finally decided to gaze in our direction, angrily stared at us, and said \\"I know\\" she hurried inside. I honestly think the couple behind us felt like they were next in line, the way she escorted them so fast and completely ignored us. \\n\\nI've never experienced anything like this before, even in Boston. We weren't on our phones or talking to anyone. We were just waiting there in line, patiently. \\n\\nWe were in line at least 15 minutes before this couple she decided to randomly select out of the line. AND then we waited close to 20 minutes for another table to finally open again. My husband and I were pretty irritated, but I always try to assume the best about people, which is why we decided to still wait in line. The restaurant is VERY small which is why it takes forever to get a table. \\n\\nWhen this same woman came back 20 minutes later to seat us, I pulled her aside and asked her directly \\"why did you sit the couple behind us before sitting us?\\" Her response is everything that's wrong with the worst customer service in this country. She looked at me and pointed to my husband and said accusingly,\\"well he didn't say anything.\\" Then I looked at her with a perplexed look and she replied in a mumbled way \\"Well, sorry, but there was no reason.\\" There was no reason. \\n\\nIt doesn't matter how little you speak up in line, the hostess has a job to do and she can't simply indiscriminately seat parties however she feels fit. This waitress made us wait for 20 minutes outside in the hot and humid, for NO REASON and she honestly didn't feel bad about it. \\n\\nI'm not even going to comment on the food, it's irrelevant. Any place that treats its customers with such apathy and ungraciousness doesn't deserve my recommendation or money.\\n\\nPS. This place is crazy cramped and very loud. Not good for children, larger parties, or people who are sensitive to loud noise and crowds."},{"name":"Teranga","address":"1746 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Was pleasantly surprised by this place, the 5th star is for the food.  Cute spot, quiet but nice waiter (family maybe?), with a really open a friendly owner, she was lovely!   Like Anthony Bourdain, I love the sauces and flavors in African cuisines and this restaurant had some of the best I've ever tasted, Afro-French fusion with a touch of (as the owner told us) chinese.  I had the lamb with a wonderful sauce, my sister had the beef kabob, broiled with a nice marinade undertone and casava/yuca fries, the chicken dish for my mother which she also loved and nice appetizers.  The flavors were exquisite if that's not too overdone, not as extreme as Indian or Ethiopian but my brother and I can usually guess all ingredients and we couldn't here.  Everyone including the 9 year old was happy, great adult or family dining experience.  Cons: room was a bit chilly on this frosty night and food took awhile but worth the wait.\\n\\nWe finished up with a birthday surprise, complimentary Madeleines with a touch of candied ginger and whip and I think a hint of mango.

I admire creativity although this place seemed to be shabbily put together. The lighting and decor did not go well with food. I proceeded to try it anyway. \\n\\nMenu- Seemed to grab a few popular food choices and rename them, the selection of wines was disappointing and overpriced. Prices were about $10 and UP per glass. I choose the most inexpensive red and it was $8.95 I was unhappy with my selection. In fairness the server did allow me sample it before hand. Perhaps it was the buffalo chicken sandwich I ordered that wrecked my \\"pairing\\". Seriously what else was gonna go with red wine from a dinner? \\n\\nThe Food- OMG my guest ordered roast beef. The appearance..slices of roast beef from a package. The taste...less appealing than roast beef from a package. It also came with mashed potatoes and carrots.

Not sure how they do that. Because I'm also not a fan of \\"precious\\" or \\"fussy\\". I think it's because the owners, management and entire team really, are thoughtful and pleasant. Nothing is done for the sake of just doing it.\\n\\nThe space is AMAZING and I cannot wait to hang out downstairs next time. The combination of wood, exposed bricks and Bocci lights...i just can't. I want to live in that space. Warm, unique, inviting, luscious. Also, as I mentioned, everything is very thoughtful, including the coat closet in the entrance and the way the menus are stacked like at a fine library. \\n\\nThen come the drinks. Classics to new flavours. If you don't want to crack open the menu (like I often don't) feel free to roll the dice and provide a flavour profile to your server. They won't disappoint.\\n\\nAs for the food, it has not changed much from the old Chambar and this is a good thing. Relatively small menu, with the classics (moule frite, lamb tagine) and a few new plates. Solid solid solid. \\n\\nLastly, the team at Chambar are all equally superb. Very approachable, lovely, efficient and knowledgeable.  And there is no hovering. But they do want to make sure you are enjoying yourself and that everything is up to snuff.

My friend Dan was quiet for awhile and when I asked him if he was ok he responded with \\"the things that are happening in my mouth right now are unbelievable\\".

Come hungry, come relaxed, order some pre-dinner cocktails and appis before your main and be sure save a little room to share a desert and have an aperitif.

My girlfriend at the time and I once sat so long to be waited on that we got up and walked out. I'm a tolerant guy. That means it took way too long. My most recent visit was just to enjoy a drink on the patio while I waited for a shop next door to open. There was a pianist playing a grand piano in the corner. A really nice touch, but a little loud for a Sunday morning. The interior was dimly lit. Again, while it made for a quaint ambiance, I'm not sure it was the right one for the time of day.\\n\\nI ordered an iced Chai and was pleasantly surprised they do not charge extra for the use of soy milk. The Chai was good, and although you would think this would be a pretty simple endeavor, a lot of places manage to screw up the ratio of the contents, which throws the flavor off. Mozart's got it right. They could stand to upgrade the dated, plastic patio furniture.

In fact, most would call it ordinary, and that's a much more accurate description. The dining area itself is cookie-cutter American sit down - indistinguishable from TGI Fridays, Max & Ermas, Fuddruckers, Applebee's, or Chili's. Unlike those restaurants, each seems to have something they're famous for, whether it's a garbage burger, hamburger bar, week-long weekday happy hours, or baby back ribs. O' Charleys, however, does not.\\n\\nThe waitress arrived within two minutes and our drinks arrived in under 5. We ordered the Chicken Apple Spinach Salad and the Cedar-Planked Salmon. Our main course arrived in under 20 minutes and we were on our way.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, the food was both good and great. I thoroughly enjoyed the Salmon and my partner enjoyed her salad. However, her salad was middling at best. It was just what the order said: Chieken+Apple+Spinach+Salad. The spinach tasted earthy, which is what you'd fully expect from spinach, but the chicken was both bland and cold. Even if the chicken was supposed to arrived cold or chilled, there was no taste to it. Imagine a chicken breast cooked the previous day in a microwave and then chopped and stored overnight for the next day's meals. Overall, I can't really say anything good about the salad. Even with the Salmon being pretty good, it wasn't a home run by a long shot. It was ordinary.\\n\\nThe total bill came to 26 and we added about 18% for dip. The service was good and just what we'd expected. There was no over the top at any point in the meal, even something as small as offering a to-go cup or nailing down the refill times like a few places do. However, the GM came over and gave the generally managing question of \\"How was your meal?\\" It was good. Question asked, question answered.\\n\\nThe improvement has to be made in the kitchen. Unfortunately, this is a chain-wide mistake, not a manager, waitstaff, or even kitchen issue.\\n\\nSo, would I recommend it? No - not if you are in the mood for anything else.

We came in on a Saturday night right when they opened, okay, maybe 2 minutes after (but whose really counting) about 1/3 of the restaurant was already seated, and there was a line leading to the door. We were pretty hungry but the line reaffirmed the positive reviews, this was a good restaurant. We were seated incredibly quickly, literally within 30 seconds of reaching the hostess stand. Service was outstanding, friendly, knowledgeable, our water was always full. \\n\\nThe food here is simply put, amazing. We ordered what felt like a lot but in actuality wasn't...okay, that's a lie. I think we ate too fast to realize how full we were getting. We ordered  in no particular order okonomiyaki (pancake with shrimp and mushrooms, topped with parmesan fried oysters, drizzled with aioli and eel sauce), braised short ribs (with roasted root vegetables and asian pear jus), savory aburi nigiri (soy marinated albacore, lightly torched), wild alaskan salmon (yuan-zuke seasoned-soy marinated), salmon sashimi, and tuna sashimi. I was in love with the pancake on first bite and my girlfriend liked it fine (so I ate it all) and she absolutely loved her short ribs. The sashimi was literally so fresh and melt in your mouth. \\n\\nThe best thing about this location is that it's right next to Salt and Straw. Literally, the whole resturant smells like a big waffle cone. There's nothing better than leaving dinner full (and happy) and smelling like absolute deliciousness. I usually always opt for dessert and/or ice cream but even I was too full to even consider it."},{"name":"MAD Greens - Lakeway","address":"2011 Main St, Ste 400","city":"Lakeway","stars":"4","text":"This is my second time visiting Mad Greens but first time at this location. I was exciting to check them out again and of course they didn't disappoint. \\n\\nI wanted to try the Ty Cobb salad this time which consists of romaine lettuce, bacon, egg, avocado (go spicy), tomatoes, red onion, grilled southwestern chicken with light blue cheese dressing. The spicy avocado is the way to go because they use mad spice seasoning. Mad spice is honestly what can make a salad or anything even more delicious. It is a blend of chocolate, chili pepper spices and ghost pepper infused salt. \\n\\nI had a change to sample 3 types of hummus, pita bread (fluffy), salted caramel cookie, 7 layer, chocolate chip and oatmeal cookie. I also tried mint cooler and wake up juices. Honestly I liked everything I tried but the salted caramel cookie won my heart again. Something with sugar and salt pleases my palate.\\n\\nI wish a mad green location was closer to me and soon they will have a location in the downtown area off of 2nd street. \\n\\nI love the concept of using as much local ingredients they can.

Even if you've been to a pig roast, digging down into the head, revealing the jaw bone and the teeth underneath, was quite something else. It is served Peking duck style. It's incredibly fatty, not too much meat on the head. So imagine pork belly but even fattier. It was certainly delicious but I was full/overwhelmed by its intensity quickly. Thankfully our waiter recommend the pinot noir for me. Even though I didn't like it too much on first taste, it really help cut through all the fat and paired perfectly with the pig's head.

I first went for dinner on a weeknight.  As others have mentioned, the restaurant is not large and therefore we had to wait about 15 minutes or so to get a table.  While my taste buds tend to crave fast food vegetarian dishes, Red Lentil leans more towards healthy alternatives, which is what I should be eating anyway.  For dinner, I started with two appetizers (Sesame Encrusted Seitan Strips & Soy Chicken Strips).  Both were quite good, though my friend leaned more towards the former while I preferred the latter.  For the main course I went for the nightly special which was some tofu dish with veggies and mashed sweet potatoes.  I enjoyed it though it was laced with my least favorite vegetable, onions.  Overall, I thought the food was decent, service was polite, and atmosphere was crowded but comfortable.  \\n\\nI went back for lunch a few days later and while being the weekend we had no wait for seating.  This time I ordered the Gobi Manchurian for an appetizer and the Tempeh Reuben with sweet potato fries for the main dish.  I must say the Gobi Manchurian was great.  The server recommended this dish and I'm glad we listened to her.  She also recommended the reuben which I'm afraid I found to be just okay.  In fairness to Red Lentil, I'm used to the veggie reuben at Zoe's in cambridge, which is a bit more flavorful (and loaded with fat).  The red lentil reuben is probably better for me, which is why my body was questioning it.  The sweet potato fries were great as was the bbq sauce that came with it.  \\n\\nTwo additional items we tried during lunch were a fruit smoothie and a carrot cake for dessert.  Both were good, though I would try something else next time.  \\n\\nWhile I'm in general favor of Red Lentil I do have a few cautions to mention.  First, when I went to dinner with my friend, we split the bill on our debit cards.  A few days later I noticed on my bank statement that they had billed me twice, for the amount I requested and also for the entire bill.  They were responsive when I asked them to correct it, but it still was a concern.  A second advisement is that Mount Auburn Street in Watertown can be a challenging area to find parking around.  On the weekend I drove around a bit before finding a spot.  You will need change to park at one of the local meters as well.  \\n\\nBefore going to Red Lentil I would recommend checking out the menu to see what might be of interest.  The lunch menu and dinner menu offer different items (and prices) so that might influence timing of your visit.  I did not find the service to be inhospitable as others have mentioned nor did I struggle with the room temperature.  I would definitely go back again, though probably not this week."},{"name":"Nakato Japanese Restaurant","address":"1776 Cheshire Bridge Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I've been here several times.

We tried it out because it looked like there was a bit of a wait next door at Port 305. The waitress had her happy face on, but forgot to bring our starter, was extremely slow and was very pretentious. I ordered a martini - just okay ... for $10 I want it to taste yummy. The waitress also brought me the wrong drink and had to come back. I am allergic to the 1st drink. My friend's Mojito was definitely thrown together, but at least wasn't horrible. My husband was peeved they didn't have a single beer on draft. He ordered a bottle. Fine. Onto the food. We ordered pasta - over $20 per plate. Two were supposed to come with penne and one with rigatoni. We all got rigatoni. No explanation. My husband's Marsala sauce was totally inedible. It was disgusting. A mysterious clear liquid (thicker than a broth, but not a sauce) that tasted sweet ... nothing that 'went' with chicken or should be put over pasta. The broccoli on my plate were like trees and the chicken was cut in weird shapes and fried to death then added to the sauce. I think the Alfredo sauce came from a jar. The portion sizes were ridiculous. Each of us got our own platter. Although I didn't like my meal, I ate because I was hungry and it was so expensive. The portions were so huge, I ate dinner, took home the leftovers for the kids. I just fed 3 kids and myself from the leftovers. I would far rather have food cooked properly and receive1/3 the portion. My husband barely touched his Marsala, yet when we only asked for 2 containers, the waitress did not ask my husband if he wants a container or why he doesn't want his leftovers. I'm sure she already knew why. I think he should have complained and refused to pay. It was really disgusting. Next time I'll wait and go to Port 305 instead.

Ten times out of ten, whenever I'm on Marietta St on foot with company, we inexplicably end up going a little bit further down and to Der Biergarten.  But on this particular afternoon, a das boot of beer didn't sound that appealing, and the want for some more sustenance other than a ridiculously large pretzel made Der Biergarten not necessarily the logical choice.  So, to Stats we went.\\n\\nAllow me to paint the picture of the time in which I visited Stats for the very first time:\\n* Sunday afternoon\\n* Before post-church crowd\\n* In late-January, the presumed \\"slow period\\" for tourism\\n* Not football season\\n*¬†NBA doesn't play until evenings\\n* No notable events at Georgia Dome, GWCC or Centennial Olympic Park\\n* Did not drink any booze\\n\\nI wanted to disclose such criteria, because knowing the area, absolutely no promises can be made to anyone else who visits Stats under differing criteria will get the same positive result that I received, because given the area, businesses and the surrounding area are subject to such fluctuation(s) as:\\n\\n* Hellacious traffic\\n* Inaccessibility\\n*¬†Gauged parking\\n*¬†Monumental wait times\\n* Happy hour crowds, sports fan crowds, tourist crowds\\n* Fixed menus\\n* Slammed and overwhelmed restaurant staff\\n\\nNone of this should be that much of a surprise, so if you find yourself in a similar situation in which I visited, you might have as equally of a relaxed and well-serviced lunch, but if you decide to come in the midst of college bowl/NFL season, or some major conference/convention, then I make no promises that you will have as pleasing of an experience.\\n\\nStats is located at the corner of Marietta and Baker streets, which puts them a stone's throw away from such notable city landmarks such as the Georgia World Congress Center, the Georgia Aquarium, World of Coke and the Civil Rights Museum, as well as Centennial Olympic Park.

Unlike lots of places in the city, Stats is somewhat reasonably close to MARTA accessibility, be it on the Philips Arena/GWCC stop, or 3-4 city blocks down from Peachtree Center, following Baker Street towards the Aquarium. \\n\\nAnyway, being a relaxed Sunday afternoon, my group and I walked into Stats an hour after they had opened.  Given how empty the place was, I almost thought they weren't open, but there was still a hostess up front, and we were seated immediately.  The emptiness shouldn't be indicative of the quality of the food and service, so much as it was the time and criteria in which I visited; frankly, I prefer beating rushes and getting into places early, as opposed to having to wait egregious times just to be seated.\\n\\nService was polite and attentive throughout the entire experience, and I guess I've been having a bad string of service lately, because I found myself especially impressed by the service staff's ability to anticipate refill needs and bringing them; without having to flag anyone down.  Being a sports bar, I was pleased to find out that the staff, at least the server I had, understood the Joe Namath \\"guarantee\\" reference, in relation to the Joe Namath-namesake wrap they have on the menu.  I'd most certainly have judged them with disdain had they not.\\n\\nI ordered their club sandwich, and what they brought me, for $11, seemed like an absolute steal.  It's a fairly standard club, so it's got the usual goodness, turkey, bacon, cheese, lettuce, tomato, a little bit of mayo on toasted sandwich bread.  It's generously sized, and they're graciously not stingy on the turkey.  The sandwich alone is more than filling, but with a side of fries, it's a very hefty portion of food, which I'd rather have instead of something leaving me jonesing for more.\\n\\nOverall, I had zero complaints about my Stats experience, but again, I know that the circumstances in which I visited aren't the most commonly available, given the fact that outside of January, there are usually lots of things going on in the surrounding landmarks that could have increased the traffic.  The atmosphere is pretty modern, and full of televisions for watching sports, and not as overly trendy as I thought it was going to be.  The service was friendly and attentive, and I couldn't have asked for anything more.  The menu is small, but full of decent options, and the club sandwich I had was a fantastic bang for the buck.\\n\\nPersonally, I can't say that I'd come during a game/convention time, but under this visit's circumstances, most certainly would consider."},{"name":"Blue Sky Cafe","address":"600 Galleria Pkwy SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Good caf√© located in the 600 Galleria building's lobby.

Wow.\\n\\n\\n*** \\"...a macvin prepared according to a secret recipe of 1579 created by the nuns of the Abbey of Chateau-Chalon. The Abbey owned the vineyards of Chateau Chalon in the 16th century and wrote of this special wine that it was \\"notre vin de galant\\". The Bourdy Family holds the original recipe, the only in the world. We are the only estate capable of producing this singular wine, considered the equal of France's greatest dessert wines, as it was made in the 16th century. The must is placed in a copper kettle to which 25 different alpine herbs and spices are precisely measured to the gram. The mix is heated and reduced during many hours - more than one day. The reduced must is placed in old barrels with 1/3 very old Marc or Fine de Franche Comte, some more than 100 years old. The mixture then ages for a minimum of 5 years and is bottled for only a very few. When opened, the Galant pairs with dark chocolate or nut cake, with vanilla cream, raisins or nuts. Cooked fresh figs dressed with almond butter and drizzled with Galant is a glorious match. Pears may be poached in Galant. A most intoxicating way of using the Galant is to deglaze and serve over filet mignon or white meat. This gives a main course never to be forgotten.\\"\\n~Jean-Francois Bourdy, winemaker\\n\\n[If you are interested, I've reviewed many meals at Craigie below, since it is my favorite Boston-area restaurant.

Being one of the only restaurants in this area allowing pets, the Salty Pig was an easy choice. It was right around the corner from my hotel and a nice walk there. We were able to be seated right away. We had to sit outside because of the dog. It was a rainy day so this was not ideal. Our server came over and recommended he put up an umbrella for us. That seem to solve everything.\\nBy the time we left the rain had stopped. I believe I ordered a chicken and avocado sandwich with a side salad, one of my sisters ordered the same and the other ordered the Italian sandwich. They both got fries with theirs. They also got some beers but since I had to work later I was sipping on some lemon water. Shout out to Jamie who was our server. Not only was he a great server, he provided us with great recommendations & was willing to substitute my fries for a side salad although they usually don't do that. He was very pet friendly toward the dog and brought over a water bowl for her. The food came out in a reasonable time. It was consumed in an aggressive time, as we were all starving. Jamie came over to see how we were doing, and then politely accepted our plea to take many photos of us, see below. He was a great sport. My sandwich was fine, but the girls texted me later asking if I felt sick. They said that the only thing they ate that was out of the ordinary were the sandwiches at The Salty Pig. I never felt bad, but it seems as though their stomachs had turned from the lunch. Not sure what happened there. Especially since I had the same sandwich as one of my sisters.

This place is CASH ONLY, no reservations!  When you find the place, there will most likely be a line.  Just get in it.  Periodically someone will come out and go up the line asking for the number in your party.  No names or anything else.  You sit as a table of your size becomes available. The best odds of getting a seat are for a party of two (or one).  Tables of 4 are ok.  Above 4 in your party and you will have a longer wait.  The physical restaurant is very small (as are many in this area of Boston).  From my experience, when you get to the edge of the restaurant in line (with the full width left to go), you are about 30 minutes from a seat. \\n\\nIs it worth it?  In a word - YES!!!!!\\n\\nGiacomo's was features on a Rachael Ray show for their calamari appetizer.  It is some of the better calamari I have eaten.  It has some hot peppers thrown in and fried as well and is served with marinara sauce.  Be careful, food at Giacomo's comes out hot so don't burn yourself.  A small calamari is $7 and feeds one hungry person or two average folks nicely.  All meals come with bread which is to die for.\\n\\nThe dinner menu has a little of everything.  Vegetarian, grilled fish, traditional italian basic foods, and seafood.  Most people eat the pasta with seafood.  The basic pasta is linguini and you pick seafood protein and a sauce (there are five to choose from).  The plates are good sized and could stretch to two people if you are trying to sample around your table.  I LOVE the lobster and shrimp over home made fusilli pasta with Diavolo sauce which seems to be a very common special at $26.  There is always a bunch of lobster meat and shrimp on it.\\n\\nWhen they seat you, the staff will ask if you have been before.  If you haven't they will explain the menu.  The service is crisp but friendly.  I have always been very happy with the speed and quality of the service.  This last time, my calamari hit the table before I finished ordering my main.  \\n\\nGiacomo's does not serve dessert.  Not a big deal since you are a block away from Mike's Pastries where you can get whatever you want.\\n\\nIf you are looking for a Michelin star dining experience or high end experimental cooking, this is not your place.  If you want to spend three hours on a meal in an intimate dining conversation over five courses, also not your place.  The food is basic but really well done in my opinion.

Just her, and one helper.\\n\\nShe opened the restaurant, which she later told me she did just for me, and I ordered gumbo and the Cajun tea. Lola was such a character, and the place was quaint in the best of ways. It felt like I was eating at a friend's place. The gumbo came with cornbread and it was truly great, it was salty, but... cajun food is salty y'all. \\n\\nThe entire experience was extremely authentic and we talked for a bit because it was just me in there.

Worse yet is there is zero air circulation, no fans, and mosquitoes.  The service was the worst we have experienced in quite some time especially for a restaurant of this caliber.  The waiter brought one of the drinks after about 15 minutes of ordering and our glasses were usually empty making it even more uncomfortable with the heat due to zero airflow in the area.

Our server was excellent, extremely attentive and accommodating. I began with the escargot - served without shells in a piping hot cast-iron skillet, the garlic herb butter sauce was out of this world!... so of course my expectations for dinner were raised. Unfortunately raised expectations were not met, at all. Mom ordered a cob salad, she wanted something light, the mixed greens consisted mostly of bitter stems and the gorgonzola piled on top was by far the most pungent either of us had ever tried and it completely ruined the salad. I got the gnocchi with blue crab, served with a vegetable confit in a light butter broth - absolutely atrocious! The smell was an instant turn-off, it reeked of hot wine... maybe there was lemon zest too, the sauce overall was flavorless and tart at the same time, very unpleasing, worst of all the gnocchi itself was severely overcooked - crab just wasn't tasty. The waitress noticing my disgusted face ran over and offered me something else, I immediately ordered my second choice: a ricotta and goat cheese ravioli in a butternut brown butter sage sauce with wild mushrooms. The meal came out immediately, the presentation was beautiful and the sauce was delicious, the sage shined through the smooth sauce. Then I cut into the ravioli... overcooked again! the ravioli ripped apart with my fork, as for the filling, the goat cheese was way too overpowering and I believe I tasted some lemon zest as well, which combined with goat cheese it was just too much. For kicks my mom and I got desert, Creme brulee with brandied cherries, since everything had sucked I asked our waitress to put the cherries on the side, the brulee was okay, freezing cold, but a nice crusty shell on top - the sauce also cold? was decent, not brandy tasting at all which is what i was slightly afraid of, but the texture of the macerated cherries was kind of a turn off.

We were seated right away and the server did a nice job of walking us through the specials.\\n\\nWe decided to start with the Beer Battered Onion Rings served with a spiced smoked tomato mayo.  The mayo is OK, but the ketchup we requested was the better choice for dipping.  For $8, it wasn't cheap, but they did bring out a decent sized plate of them.  I was leaning towards the Cuban, but I wasn't sure so I asked the waiter.  I appreciated his honesty when he said the Cuban was OK, it wasn't the best thing they did and to try the Lamb sandwich special.  I took his advice and was rewarded, the sandwich was very good.  I had two Golden Number Ales which were good, but still heavy.  If you have read my reviews before about brewpubs my compliant qualifies here as well.  Whenever one of these establishments opens they introduce 47 IPAs & Pale Ales, a token Stout and jam some odd ball fruit into a beer.  I love Pilsners and lighter beers too, especially during the hot Atlanta summers, but they must buy the same home brewing kit and that is all they make.  It is a little disappointing, but not uncommon, so I can hardly fault this place for mirroring other brewpubs and their selection.  Rant aside, I enjoyed lunch, but it was pretty heavy.  I will definitely be back again to try some other stuff, but it is a nice lunch option in the area.\\n\\nTo Recap:\\n\\nThe Good:  Good service, nice variety on the menu.  Everything seemed fresh and nice when a place makes its own beers, even if it could use a little more variety.\\n\\nThe Bad:  A small step above standard pub grub, but feels a little pricey when apps and small plates cost as much as sandwiches.  No real deals on the menu.  \\n\\nThe Band This Restaurant Most Resembles: Wide Spread Panic.  A nice little jam band, doing its own thing."},{"name":"Pal Campo Restaurant","address":"13605 S Apopka-Vineland Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Great place to eat Puerto Rican food in Orlando and at the same time feel like your in Old San Juan PR."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Great home style wood fire pit smoked and cooked Texas BBQ.

I've enjoyed the place each time for its food and menu, but it deserves 3 out of 5 stars simply because its service is subpar. \\n\\nOther Yelpers have made a point about the service. The service is mostly inattentive and slow. You generally need to chase down your server for food and drink requests. Nonetheless, the food is quite good.\\n\\nThe menu is divided into four main parts: bread dishes with cheese and meat (delicious!), appetizers, pasta, and pizzas. We had the venison cacciatorini bread entree with herbes de Provence and dried mushroom. The flavors were rich and I especially loved how they added some sweetness in the dish with some jam. \\n\\nUsually, the assortments of meats are quite impressive. The meats are usually combined with cheeses, jams, fruits, and spreads. The real fun in the bread entrees is playing around with your selection of bread add-ons including the fig jam, mushroom conserva, jalape√±o jelly, and smoked shallot marmalade. It's interactive, fun, and social.\\n\\nSeriously, I would recommend taking advantage of their meat selection and choosing adventurous dishes including the roasted bone marrow and the pork tasting. Choose the dishes which sound like they have a good balance of savoriness and sweetness - the two tend to go well together! The pizzas are also affordable and filling.\\n\\nLastly, I would recommend going with a friend rather than a date. The slow service can certainly dull and irritate your mood especially if it's a busy night or the weekend. Certainly, tryout the Salty Pig because their food is affordable and pleasant, but the the service is somewhat disappointing for such a rockstar menu."},{"name":"Strega Italiano - Seaport","address":"One Marina Park Dr","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Excellent food and service at a price.

Not \\"not warm\\" but clearly it had been ready on time, just sat for the extra 40 minutes. I will say the Crispy Shrimp with Scallion (and tons of onions) is among my favorite dishes in the area. As is the Shredded Beef (or Pork) with Hot Pepper. I also like their Dry Fried Green Beans (not spicy), but ask for spicy oil to add to it. Pan Fried Dumplings were okay, and if I could get it without the numb, I would adore the Crispy Diced Chicken.

With no big city living experience behind me, and having grown up in Schenectady (never a paragon of civic beauty), my reaction to Beach Street was \\"Oh, so this is what it's like\\" rather than \\"Dirt, ew.\\"  \\n\\nPotluck Cafe is Boston Chinatown as I know and love it...which  may not be the Chinatown experience you're looking for.  The sidewalks are often crowded, the pavement is broken, the dumpsters sometimes overflow, the streets have poor drainage when it rains and get appallingly hot in summer, but while none of these are exactly selling points, they're things that have never particularly troubled me or put me off my appetite.  If they do trouble you in those ways, or if you have a need for table service, can't stand a crowded lunch line, and can't tolerate the uncertainty of point-and-take-a-chance ordering, you might reconsider a visit to Potluck Cafe.  You have been warned.  \\n\\nBut from where I'm sitting, Potluck Cafe combines the sovereign virtues of convenience, great food, great price, and nostalgia to boot.  Next to Ding Ho, it is probably the fastest lunch in Chinatown, even if you arrive at the height of the lunch rush.  The food is really tasty and there's a huge variety.  There are always several dishes that would look fairly familiar to an eater of Americanized Chinese food (chicken chunks breaded and fried in some kind of sauce with some kind of vegetable), and if you want to eat this \\"General chicken\\" (generic chicken?), well, it's there for you.  But even if you're playing it safe, you owe it to yourself to take a chance now and then -- come on, you get three types of food, and enough of it to feed the Russian army!  Order one unfamiliar thing, it could be your new fave dish!  Eating that way, you'll quickly develop a Potluck Cafe repertoire of \\"that thing with the tofu and chilies and I don't know what but yum\\" dishes.  Today's selection: mabo tofu, a really tasty barbecued chicken, and a thing with pork belly and tofu tied in knots...no clue what that's called, but wow, good.  At $5.50 the plate, it takes me back to the days of the Chinatown Mall, home of sub-$5 rice plates.

Food is stellar - lots of raw bar, oyster, and beer options. This is the place to come for seafood. Island Creek is great, but Row 34 is through the roof (sister restaurants). \\n\\nI've been here twice, service from both waiters and bartenders (Bill, and I think Sarah?) have been impeccable and personable, whether you are solo or dining with others. I've had some of the best service of my life here, waiters are knowledgeable about food as well as the fine details in the restaurant. The pride in their food is written on their walls and delicately flavored into their delicious dishes. Row 34 hasn't even been open a year yet.\\n\\nOysters, steamers, and smoked dishes are my favorites, along with some of the sides. Hot lobster roll is pretty great, but this is more a place for me to try something off the beaten Boston path with their entrees. And I'm not usually one to order cornbread, but that + their maple butter will change your world.\\n\\nDesserts are limited, and I've had all 3. I feel like asking for a little more work in this department, but honestly, I come for the seafood, not a bakery.\\n\\nPractically: if you come Sat. night without a reservation, prepare for a little wait. When I went alone, I waited about 20-30min for a bar seat, and they were great about making sure I was seated as promptly as possible. Sun. evening there was hardly anyone, getting a table was easy.\\n\\nTake your chances with parking. Meters are free on Sun., but you can easily get here by subway, or take a cab from Southie for 5-10min. ride.\\n\\nIt's got a classy feel, but not snobbish at all.\\n\\nI plan to get back here at least a few times before I leave the city.

The sandwiches have about 4 slices of meat on them the hot platters come out cold & the food tastes like it was made in the hospital cafeteria.

I would have left them alone, but my experiences with them over recent years have been quite disappointing.\\n\\nI can remember the first time I had a Big Mac (I'm a child of the 70s).  I thought it was the biggest and tastiest burger on the planet.  I could barely finish it and couldn't wait for my next one.  Between that and the Quarter Pounder in the 80s (high school years), I felt like this place was untouchable.  And the fries.  Dude.  Loved the taste.  \\n\\nThen along came the McNuggets, which had me giving up my arcade money, every chance I got.  Oh, the memories of sitting with my girlfriend as we took turns, dipping them in sauce and feeding them to one-another.  Yeah, sappy, but romantic.  Add the apple pies and the vanilla shakes - this place could do no wrong!  I even remember when they had that special in the late 80s: 59 Cent Hamburgers and 69 Cent Cheeseburgers.  My college roommate and I drove over there in Tallahassee and ordered 10 EACH and ate like kings...\\n \\nSomewhere after the turn of the century, everything went south and FAST!  But for the fries, I really can't enjoy anything on their menu anymore.  These new nuggets have terrible texture and aftertaste.  The cheese on the basic cheeseburgers tastes gummy, often sickening.  The patties, once large and juicy are small (inflation) and bland.  The pickles often chew like plastic and the buns, dear Lord...  It's to the point where I have to remove the middle bun on the Big Mac because it tastes like cardboard.  And I don't even want to talk about food temperature.\\n\\nI think the only thing that I can really order and still enjoy is the Big Breakfast with Hotcakes.  Not as good as it was years ago, but still pretty decent.\\n\\nI don't know who is working in their laboratories, but I'm sure they're not that far removed from the older recipes that they can't see the dramatic difference.  \\n\\nIt's just painful, seeing one of my favorite fast food restaurants drop so far, so fast.  I do hope that they get it together and turn this place around.  Their long-time customers really do deserve better.  \\n\\nOops.  I forgot.  A+ for their Coke (strong as hell) and Sweet Ice Tea.

Burger or Veggie burger. Add cheese, bacon, and maybe one or two other options. Fries, soda and beer, that's it. Like i said, compact. It was a bit off-putting to see the lack of choices at first, but after i had tried a couple of things and found what i liked i guess i came around to it more. Since they limit their menu it allows them to be faster, fresher and better at the small number of things that they do. My regular order now is the Chevre Cheeseburger with bacon and extra pickles...to die for, yo.\\n\\nThe wait times are slightly longer than typical fast food, but impressively quick considering that every order is cooked on point. Their customer service is quick but friendly. They work very fast and hard. The space inside is fairly small but there are quite a few tables as well as a counter right in front of their open kitchen, however most of the time i only sit long enough to get my burgers to go. It's not unusual for punk or classic rock to be blaring in this place, last time i was there i think it was Black Sabbath.\\n\\nThe only thing keeping me from rating this 5 stars is that 2 times now i have stopped by 10 minutes before they close, *hoping* they can still squeeze in one burger order for me...one time it was already dark and abandoned inside, the second time i just got a curt \\"I'm sorry we just closed\\". But i get it...nobody likes serving customers right before closing, especially when you work in high-volume fast food.

I came in by myself for Saturday lunch and got the pate de campagne with wildflower honey and figs jam. I also got the salty pig pizza special. Open kitchen design was nice and Pizza oven impressive. Service was maybe a little aloof at times since I was almost the only person their at the bar, but overall acceptable.\\n\\nFirstly the pizza was delicious since I really like the play between salty and sweet, the abundant topping of arugula provided the perfect bitter balance. However I feel like there was too much topping (which made it hard to eat using the folding method) and the middle of the pizza became soggy very fast from the accumulated juices. So the crunchy/chewy texture of the pizza deteriorated too fast to enjoy properly.\\n\\nNext I got the charcuterie pate, which was deliciously prepared and the accompanying pickled vegetables had the perfect acidity to pair with the savory, salty meats and perfectly grilled toast points. Finally the figs jam was just ok, I felt it was too dry and overcooked to allow the vibrant figs taste to come through.

We walked in and were immediately impressed by the modern, chic, and unique decor - you truly feel like you are dining in an art gallery.  The purple glass chandelier over the circular bar was a perfect way to center the room, and the artwork on the back wall and high up on the other walls was a great conversation starter but conveyed the art theme without being overly intrusive.  \\n\\nThey seated us promptly and gave us a choice of table location (nice touch).  We were given our food and drink menus and they timed the initial service perfectly - gave us enough time to settle in and take a look before taking our water and drink orders, but not so much time that we were trying to flag someone down.  Important note: we wanted to order from both the dining room menu and the bar menu, and to do this, you have to sit at the high top table in the bar area.  Totally fine by us, it was a great vibe in the bar area.\\n\\nThe drink selection is a little limited (only one signature cocktail with each type of liquor) but the cocktails my friends did have were very good, and I tried two different wines by the glass and both were very good.  The server poured the first glass without letting me taste first (small detail) but for the second glass she did give me a taste.  \\n\\nFood-wise, we split a bunch of different small plates, so I can't comment so much on the full dining room menu - but almost everything we did have was excellent with just a couple exceptions.  The yucca fries were absolutely delicious - crispy and not overly salty or heavy.  The pretzel was a tiny bit dry but the mustard sauce was great.  I didn't try the flammkuchen or the calamari but my friends said that they were both quite good.  The weakest dish was the cheese dumplings - they did not taste bad, but they were basically blobs of cheese about the size of half a golf ball each...they were not \\"dumplings\\" as best I could figure out because they didn't really have the dough to cover them...I may be mistaken, but I think it was a little misleading.  I have to say that the crowning achievement was the duck confit - potentially the best one I've ever had.  Well cooked, crispy skin, excellent flavor...I ate almost the whole thing myself!  Desserts (the sour cherry bread pudding and the chocolate bark) were also top notch.\\n\\nI would almost give this place 5 stars, but the service was a bit lacking once we got into the meal.  They were good about taking our drink orders up front, but after that they disappeared for a while ... it took a long time for them to take the food order (we were starving by the time they did) and once we finished our meal we had to flag someone down to order dessert.  But, they were all very nice and tried to be helpful, so I can't fault them too much.\\n\\nOverall, I think it's a 4.5 with 5 stars for ambiance, 4.5 stars for food (on average), 4 stars for drinks and around 3.5 stars for service.  I will definitely be back!"},{"name":"King Bao","address":"710 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Oh no, there goes Tokyo go go Hogzilla! 3 bao combo is enough to fill you up.

There is lots of outside seating but since it was a rainy, cold day we signed up on the waiting list and were seated within ten minutes. The interior decor is small but fun and just as funky as the exterior. I went for the Socialist Soy Hash and hubby had the Plantain Omelette. Both were really good! I really enjoyed the Manzanilla tea (bliss on a cold day) and hubby had a Xingu beer which was kind of like a session Porter - nice. For dessert we shared an apple empanada which was pretty good but needed a bit more filling. Oh and I enjoyed the basket of muffins offered as a starter. \\n\\nSo much more to try on the menu.

A glance at the menu online revealed the Apple Brie Omelet, another excellent combination which sealed the deal.\\n\\nWe arrived and we're seated immediately...typically we're coffee people in the morning but they also offered a broad selection of loose teas and where there's a darjeeling in the house, it becomes a tough choice.  So my wife ordered the coffee which was bold, robust and excellent.  The darjeeling was served in it's own pot with leaves happily steeping inside.  The flavor was good though the pot didn't keep the tea warm.\\n\\nI ordered the Apple Brie Omelet (again when such a thing is on the menu, is there really a choice...) made with egg whites.  It was delivered with the brie oozing out of folds in the omelette. It was a thrill kind of like when you were a kid watching those homemade volcanoes...simply awesome.  I had it with a stuffed banana muffin which was good.  (You can choose any house-made muffin as your bread choice substituted for the regular bread choices.)\\n\\nMy wife ordered the Benedict...she subbed avocado for the bacon. Vegetarian versions of Eggs Benedict are one of her weaknesses so it's hard to choose something else when there's one on the menu in a place like these where the food seems to be made thoughtfully.  Unfortunately this time around it was not her best choice...she felt there wasn't enough hollandaise sauce especially since it was served on an extra thick english muffin.  This was one of those cases where we saw another table's order and wished we'd gotten that.  In this case it was the Morning Monte Cristo which is eggs with raspberry preserves & Cheddar cheese between two slices of challah bread french toast. (Normally with bacon but obviously not for us.)  It looked amazing.\\n\\nWe had a side of the Red Potatoes which one of us thought were great and the other didn't.\\n\\nThis is a great and unique breakfast, or breakfast all day (check out the \\"perpetual breakfast menu\\" on their website) spot which is a very good choice on Newbury Street if you happen to be in the area...there are many other vegetarian options on their menu for breakfast, appetizers and dinner.  Vegetarians won't go hungry and depending on your particular tastes you'll probably enjoy your meal quite a bit.\\n\\nFor more reviews from a vegetarian perspective visit Rick and Addie's Veggie Food Blog: http://poetrysuperhighway.com/vfb"},{"name":"Chung Shin Yuan","address":"183 California St","city":"Newton","stars":"3.5","text":"I have been ordering food here for many years (easily 40 times between take out and eating in).

One con was when I called to make a reservation for a Friday night for 15 people, there was no issue until they called back to confirm later in the week. Whoever I spoke to asked me who I spoke to to make the reservation and I didn't know who that was. The staff person (I'm assuming some manager) then said, \\"Well, just so you know we don't normally have reservations for this large of a party on Friday nights, but we will still honor your reservation.\\" So not really sure why they didn't tell me that in the first place but I informed them that no one had told me that and that my party would still be coming regardless because that wasn't my fault for the miscommunication between their staff.

There is an ATM machine located onsite if needed. Upon walking in, you're greeted by a large BBQ fire pit loaded with various meats on the grill. \\nI ordered the Brisket Plate which is served with potato salad, coleslaw & beans; the bread, pickles and onions come per request. There were tons of seating but decided to sit outdoors for the countryside ambiance. The food came out quick.\\nBrisket was moist, tender and flavorful. I recommend trying both of their sauces: Whiskey Barrel BBQ in regular and spicy. Both are delicious! I'm not a big potato salad and coleslaw type of girl but their's was fantastic. I ate every last bite of it. Also couldn't deny ordering a slice of the blackberry cobbler and pecan pie. The cobbler was perfection, however the pecan was too sweet for my taste. If you find yourself in Texas and craving BBQ, check out Salt Lick!"},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Food was good as usual.

On-site hotel gave us early admission to HP which we took advantage of - nice to have it to yourselves. Also came with unlimited express passes, which felt decadent and were WONDERFUL. Park was already slow, and the passes had us walking on every ride nearly every time! Over the four days we were there, the most we waited for any ride was 10 minutes. Got on all our fave rides five and six times. If you can swing it - early December is the time to go. Macy's Parade was great and the holiday light show on the Castle took my breath away! We got 3-park/hopper tix, but you could easily drop Volcano Bay this time of year. Never stepped foot in it since it was in the low 70's and windy.

Aki does a pretty good job of appealing to both.  You can tell the food is more authentic and there don't seem to be a lot of the specialized rolls you find in the more trendy sushi bars.  Personally I find this a lot more appealing, and the fact that everything is priced super reasonable helps a whole lot.\\n\\nBoth the sushi menu and dinner menus are a little small, but I still saw several things I wanted to try.  I love noodles, so it was nice to see several choices instead of just the usual udon and sometimes soba.  I decided on the pork ramen and was reasonably impressed.   It could've used a little bit more toppings but I think it was great for the price.  I also really enjoyed the sushi I got to try that my wife and friends ordered.   \\n\\nThe dining area is pretty small and the tables are close together, so it's not a place you want to sit and stay at for a while.  Fortunately, the food comes out very quickly and even if they are busy they don't try to push you out like other places have.\\n\\nI like this place, and look forward to checking it out again since there were several things on the menu I wanted to try.

We ordered Bloody Marys (which were good, but not spicy enough for my taste) and brunch/lunch.  My friend ordered the brunch burger, which was fantastically amazing, and I ordered the reuben, which was also extremely good.  My only qualm with the food, was that the \\"salad\\" that you could substitute fries for was simply a spring mix dressed with a vinaigrette - no other veggies.

Antico takes pride in it's pies and so they don't want us messing with them. They have enough offerings to please anyone but don't necessarily need to. \\n\\nPrice - You truly get what you pay for here. The pies are over 20 bucks but worth every penny. They sell booze too but you can BYOB which may be the most amazing idea in the history of dining out. And they don't even shun me when I bring in High Life, which gets some looks when ordered at nice places. \\n\\nFood - Unreal. And out in under 3 minutes. It's a wonderful place, Antico. The ingredients on the pizza are visibly fresh and the toppings they have in the oven room are so good they should be illegal. They have this oil + peppers + salt stuff that I always want to take a gallon of when I leave and bathe in it for the remainder of the night. My favorite pizza is the spicy one. Once you're done, you can head to the Cappuccino place next door for a delicious cannoli and beverage. They are all owned by the same family and it's evident they hold high standards for their businesses. I've never had a bite I didn't like. \\n\\nService - It's gourmet pizza in three minutes. They win. \\n\\nAmbiance - In a very cool little nook with the other family owned places. It's truly got an Italian feel to it and the music, menu and pizza all validate that feeling. \\nIt's crowded often and the seating is next to the ovens, which, while nice to have visibility into your meal, makes the room a little toasty. So keep those beers you brought cold and you'll be fine. They have fans in there too. \\n\\nBest thing - BYOB.

We went for restaurant week and there special was pick one item off one list, two off another and then a desert for $33. They also had a sangria special for $25 for a liter of red or white sangria. To start off with we got a Crusty Brazilian Cheese Bread which was very doughy and not crusty at all. We also had a potato and onion omelette with a side of Cr√®me Fraiche. The omelette and bread both seemed like they were made at the beginning of the night and re heated in the microwave. We got a fried calamari dish with a chili infused tomato sauce which was extremely rubbery and soft. The tomato sauce was pretty good. We also got the saut√©ed artichoke hearts which were pretty good as well. They were cooked in oil and a lot of spices which we enjoyed. The two other dishes we got were a Spanish sausage and a beef tenderloin with chimichurri on top of a piece of bread. The sausage was a very simple and average dish. The steak was the best part of the meal and prepared very well. For desert we had coffee flan and churro with chocolate sauce. These again were average. The food alone warranted 2 very below average stars but it was everything else is what brought it down further. \\n\\nThe fact that the food tasted microwaved to start with put us off.

It feels more like a Joey's inside than the Chambar I loved before. No sense of intimacy inside whatsoever - the place is MASSIVE. Despite that, our reserved table wasn't ready (on a monday night) and the hostess was disinterested at best. We stood waiting by the door for about ten minutes before we were seated.\\n\\nWe ordered a bunch of food and had a few courses. \\n\\nBison Tartare - the thing with tartare is it's supposed to be about the meat, with a little light binding and some light acidity. This was more like grey ceviche on soggy bread. It was overly acidic, generally unappealing and not at all what you'd expect a tartare to be. \\n\\nOlives - well it's pretty hard to mess up olives\\n\\nFoie Terrine - It was alright. There's never enough bread with this dish and frankly i think brioche is too rich for foie. The granita thing doesn't make sense - it's hard to spoon on to fat, soft, triangular bread and the foie is under seasoned both times i've had it. I'd way rather have a nice compote and crusty bread. \\n\\nMoules Coquotte - this is usually my fave dish at Chambar. The frites are awesome. That said, people give them so much praise for mussels - these are literally the easiest thing to make, you can do it at home in about ten minutes. The bacon in the sauce was undercooked. come on guys. \\n\\nPepper steak - this was the worst dish of the evening. The steak was CAKED in whole peppercorns that were completely overwhelming - and i love pepper - served on top of what could only be called a pile of glop masquerading as bearnaise sauce. You could actually pile it on top of itself. it was gross and we sent it back. \\n\\nWe ordered a couple of desserts - don't get the rhubarb one - but the chocolate one was pretty good. The rhubarb one was this mess of too many textures with a little rhubarb flavor then candied ginger. everywhere. \\n\\nThe wine list is great though, as is their beer selection. Go in for a glass of wine and some mussels, don't bother with anything else. for that much money you would be much, much better served going to L'Abattoir or Wildebeest. \\n\\nI haven't had brunch there, but based on the menu they just ripped off Cafe Medina, that used to be next door.

After about 45 minutes from the time I initially called, I left with the fish and chips which cost over $15, and went straight home about three miles at most to eat. The fish was breaded, but the skin was obvious and not appetizing, and they were \\"soggy\\" as were the chips.

The complimentary edamame was great and it made the wait seem short. I went in when it was crowded and the service was quick. \\nI ordered a Veggie Roll, Sweet Egg Roll (Tamago), and Miso Soup. My server asked if I would like chocolate on my tamago and I thought why not. \\n\\nWhen I asked another waitress how much the miso soup cost because it wasn't on the menu, she told me 3 dollars. I expected the miso to cost $1.50 at the most because I've never spent more than one dollar on miso soup. She gave me a free miso soup when I mentioned the price. That's why I'm giving this place 3 stars because the waitress was nice. Yes it was tastier than usual but no average size bowl of Miso Soup is worth 3 dollars. The $5 veggie rolls were more expensive than San Sai, but they tasted exactly one dollar and 50 cents better. Very delicious and my favorite part of the meal. The tamago was bellow average for my liking because the egg was too wet, but it was decent with the soy sauce. I imagined chocolate sauce, but there were little chocolate flakes sprinkled on top and I couldn't taste them well.\\n \\nThen comes my check. The little chocolate flakes cost two extra dollars! I imagined them to come for free and I didn't have that much cash with me to cover the new cost. I'd recommend bringing at least $20 if you want a full meal. The waitress let it go, but I felt all kinds of awkward walking out of there two dollars short. I wish I'd left a tip but it was too expensive for someone like me. I'll be back for a special treat and maybe just order the veggie rolls because they are great."},{"name":"Chambar","address":"568 Beatty Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I was presented with a pair of great seats to see the Canucks last month. Super excited to make a great night out of this event, I made the decision to have dinner before the game at Chambar and just walk over to GM Place. Logistically, the plan worked out pretty well, but I wish I had chosen another place to eat.\\n\\nI need to qualify this review with the fact that I used to frequent Chambar as one of my \\"go-to\\" standards for a cozy dinner out with friends and clients. The ambience they have created is really spot-on and the tunes are great, but in my opinion, these are the only positive things that remain.\\nI understand that this is a Belgian restaurant, but the food choices are not particularly Belgian. Yet, for someone that enjoys a nice cold beer before diving into main courses, they apply a brutally rigid \\"Belgian Only\\" philosophy with their beer offering. (Thier cocktails are way overpriced and are a waste of time). \\nLike many, my preferred style of beer is a lager or a pilsner. I like a crisp, light in color, full flavored, German style beer such as DAB, Grolsch, Pilsner Urquel or even a Heinekin. I also happen to really like Stella Artois, the best selling Belgian beer in the world, which is a light, crisp, German style lager and is from Belgium, but they don't stock it at Chambar. In fact, the only kind of beer that IS available at Chambar are those dark, hoppy, sweet, malty, perfumy beers which I HATE. They are disgusting. They also used to offer one other awesome, crisp,  Belgian beer called PALM, the only one I actually liked on their list, but they decided to remove this and not offer it anymore. Awesome. Thanks guys. Their bar manager should be fired on the sole grounds of being completely clued out to most people's tastes.\\n \\nThe menu is shrinking at Chambar. They offer a grand total of 5 items as main courses and four of which are meat dishes. There's a morrocan style lamb shank with figs which used to be awesome and is now way too dominated by spice, a flank steak, a venison and one Fish entre. So, if you are into eating vegetarian, or you are not a total carnivor, your options here will be extremely limited. \\n\\nThe appetizer list is more comprehensive, but the portions are tiny and the average price point is high. Your looking at between 14 and 20 bucks for a taste of whatever it is they describe. The wine list is average and they mark them up nice and high to ensure you're paying a solid 100% mark up on any bottle or glass. Our bill was something like $220 and I felt kind of hungry walking to the game. \\n\\nOur server appeared every 15 minutes or so with this lazy, lackluster attitude like he just couldn't be bothered and was too cool to serve us. That was just annoying. \\n\\nIn genreal I can't emphasize enough how disappointed and let down I felt at this place that I once recommended to everyone I know. The only reason I gave it two stars is due to the kind of restaurant it once was and the hope that it might one day regain a little of its former glory. With so many cool new places to try that get it right, I'll never be going back to this one that gets so many things wrong."},{"name":"Pepitas","address":"2015 Burrard Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"After climbing the stairs to the second floor, I felt uncomfortable taking up a big table for myself.

Had the brisket, sausage, and pork ribs combo for $15 and it was fantastic.  They slice the pork ribs across the bone which was a neat touch I hadn't remembered having before with American style BBQ pork, allowing you to get to all the meat.

Don't worry there are 2 sauces on the table \\"spicy\\" and \\"regular\\", both delicious!\\n\\nIt's traditionally been a BYOB restaurant (no bottle charges) since this is a dry county, but worry not there are at least 2 liquor stores right where you turn West onto FM1826.  If you can't deal with this, or are in a hurry to get there and meet your party or starving and desparate to put your name in, no big deal. they now have a winery next door which apparently is a loophole that allows them to sell wine and beer just one door down, on the same property.\\n\\nI will definitely pick up some sauce in the airport on my way out (2 people already made sure to tell me, and one of them was from CA)....  also the desserts and everything was reasonably priced.  \\n\\nBe aware there's a 1-1/2 hour limit to stay at the tables because it's so busy (not sure how strictly this is enforced, but something tells me after 2 hours they'd politely ask you to start on your way) so start drinking a beer while you're waiting for your table if you can.  Nobody will mind.  And of course it's Cash Only if you hadn't heard already.  Come on a weekday or very early on the weekend if you don't want a wait.

The place was nearly full but  a table  for  two opened up a few minutes after we arrived and we were  seated  quickly. The menus is large and has more Thai than Vietnamese  choices.  Fortunately here is a good  selection of pho and  some other  Vietnamese classics. We ordered watercress noodle soup, spicy  kimchi  udon, and  an appetizer of  fresh  rolls. the  watercress  noodle had an excellent chicken broth, and the noodles were  just right.  The portion was a bit small compared to the standard  bowls the more  well known places in the Boston area. Spicy  kimchi udon was a great  treat, hearty,  moderately  spicy,  and noodles  cooked perfectly.  The fresh  rolls  with shrimp were a little disappointing. These were  fairly small rolls with just a few small pieces  of  shrimp inside. The wrapping was very fresh and the peanut sauce was  tasty, but I would not order these again. Overall this is a great new place in Arlington and is  worth a try if you are a fan of  Thai and Vietnamese food."},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I'm only giving three stars for the quality of food, if I was rating on service alone I would definitely be giving 1 star. \\n\\nGreat food, terrible service. My boyfriend and I ordered the \\"pork belly confit & eggs,\\" \\"pork belly hash,\\" and the \\"two eggs any style with potatoes, bacon, and brioche toast\\" (I ordered scrambled). The meal was delicious, my scrambled eggs were buttery, fluffy, and creamy. The bacon had an intense smokiness that was quite tasty, especially when paired with a bite of the eggs and sweet brioche toast (complemented by honey butter!). My boyfriend enjoyed his meal, especially since it was his first time eating a soft boiled egg. His asparagus was cooked perfectly, and the polenta was very creamy. His only criticism was that the creamy soft polenta paired with the soft boiled eggs, made for a very mushy (and sometimes unpleasant) consistency. \\n\\nService-wise, it was absolutely awful. It took roughly 10 minutes for a waiter to approach our table, and then we never saw him again! The women refilling our water glasses visited our table more times than our waiter. No one came over to ask how our food was, and when it came time to pay, I had to walk over to get the attention of a different waiter in order to get our check (after watching several waiters make eye contact with us and continue to walk by). When my boyfriend and I were deciding on a tip, we both laughed to ourselves when we couldn't even remember what our waiter looked like...

Although perhaps intentional on the part of the artist, maybe not the best choice for the dining room?). Highlights are the graffiti wall behind the bar and the beautiful glass chandelier. The dining room is separate, but also decorated in a very nice way. A+ for ambiance; if only a restaurant could skate by on that alone.\\n\\nService was good enough. Unfortunately my boyfriend received a dirty napkin (literally, it had a huge brown stain across it. Not sure how that wasn't noticed) and a dirty plate and knife crusted with old food. We brought it to our server's attention and he replaced them promptly.\\n\\nBread was okay. The butter and knife came on a nifty tray, although one of our breads smelled (but luckily did not taste of) exactly like rodent chow. Once you know what that smells like, food that smells like it isn't exactly enticing.\\n\\nIn terms of execution, the food is cooked perfectly. It's the choice of food combinations that can be questionable. There are some jewels on the menu that I felt were overall great--I highly recommend the wild mushroom dumplings, which we ordered for one of our appetizers. If I were to ever come back, I might just do an entire meal of dumplings. The other appetizer, the Rohan duck confit, was on the large size for an appetizer, but solid. The burger is not on the menu for the dining room, but I've heard it's very good.\\n\\nThe Green Circle Chicken is literally just chicken--you have to order your own sides with it (I got the potatoes, which was a solid choice), which was slightly annoying until I actually took a bite of the chicken. I don't usually make chicken at home, perhaps because I find chicken to be unexciting (unless I pay a premium for happy chicken). These chicken eat better than I do on a daily basis and it is reflected in the quality of the meat. Combined with great execution, it was buttery and had the taste of chicken that I knew to be chicken, and yet had never had before--chicken at 150%?\\n\\nThe Colorado lamb loin was also executed beautifully, although I am not a fan of lamb. It was tender and perfectly cooked. The potato puree was great. It's what was also on the plate that I take slight issue with--the green olive/mint gremolata and roasted grapes, which were scattered right next to the lamb and potato. A bit of acid to cut through the fatty meat and potato was certainly needed and were successful palate cleansers, but the green olive and grapes were VERY sour for all the plate real estate they took up, and the sauciness of each sort of bled into the rest of the plate. Suddenly I was taking bites of lamb and potato that had unwanted acidity that did not, in my opinion, blend well AT ALL with the flavor of the lamb and potato. They needed to be separated. In this case just plating differently and more neatly would have saved it. I know that sounds like I'm the kid who throws a tantrum when her parents give her a plate with all the things running together, but from a culinary stand point, that plate with lemon cream pie and turkey gravy mixing is a travesty. I wouldn't say this was THAT, but not what I wanted from a potentially great restaurant.\\n\\nThe other thing that really didn't work well was our dessert, which was unfortunately recommended to us by our server. We were going to order the Thai young coconut semifreddo (still regret not getting that), but we got the Tainori dark chocolate bark. As far as appearances go, it was a masterpiece, but flavor wise, I think several components were lacking or SEVERELY lacking, and going simpler would have benefited it. Major issue number 1 was the smoked black walnuts. They were, indeed, smoky...and incredibly savory and umami. It was like someone squeezed meat-flavor extract all over the walnuts. It wasn't like bacon and chocolate...it was like beef bourguignon and chocolate. It did not go well together (I almost gagged and tried really hard to wash the flavor out of my mouth, to no avail), and I wonder if someone was smoking the walnuts along with some meat dishes in the same oven or something. The other issue I had was the little dollop of tan-colored stuff next to the walnuts--it had a really poor mouth feel, kind of like Starbuck's whipped cream, which makes your mouth feel like it's an oil slick that won't go away. It too was quite meaty and out of place. Perhaps it was just the batch we got or someone in the kitchen was being sloppy that night?\\n\\nThey also gave us some cute mignardises; some macarons & raspberry and olive oil jellies. Again, some had overt hints of savory, so we took a bite and left it.\\n\\nLastly, great beer selection, according to my boyfriend. Maybe we'll come back when it's aged up a bit."},{"name":"Pino's Pizza","address":"1920 Beacon St","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"Pino's is pretty good for your average neighborhood pizza joint.

Our next two apps were yummy, although not perfect. The poached egg over oxtail pastrami was delicious! Fabulous flavors! The egg was very lightly poached/soupy, so there was little to no egg taste. I would prefer a more poached egg/sauce taste. The pasta with venison was delicious as well, I could have used more meat/mushrooms, but I'm a chunky sauce kind of person. The wheat taste of the pasta was overwhelming without more chunky sauce.  \\n\\nThe main course was lamb 3 ways. The neck was also very fatty and unappetizing. The tongue was actually fabulous, as weird as it looked in its curled up presentation. The breast was very good as well, very tender!

So, I waited until they put the seats down, went back to the bar when I was approached by the dude who took me back to the corner with my de-seated friends.  He said, I can't stand at the bar.  So, I am $75 into this, Ron is doing his routine, and Universal is pushing us into the back right corner of the venue.  WTF?  I just want to see Ron White and at this point, I have forgotten about Ron (and I wasn't even drunk in public) and being hassled by Hard Rocks 'thugs'.  I complained that I didn't have a seat that I had a ticket for, and couldn't stand by the bar where I could see him.  So they 'escorted' this 57 year old man out the door.  Goodbye!  First of all, I was there to see Ron White, and it was great from D5 which I still have the ticket.  I didn't expect to be a AARP member and getting kicked out of a comedy show.  Really... (should I scan the ticket as proof?)  However, I could have put up quite a fight.

Onions and pickles are free by the way, and you get some bread with your orders.  We brought our on baguettes bread from Austin.  The tables have plenty of napkins, butter, and some sauce containers to dress your food.\\n\\nThe prices are a bit of high for some of the items, but heck if people pay why bother.

It was tasty, flavorful, the brisket tender and moist, we got the baby back ribs, and the meat was coming of the bones, the sides were well served.  Just plain simple was a great experience.  My sister said the ribs were the best she ever had.\\n\\nSome of the negatives were the fact that the naives were butter knives, come on in a BBQ place you get butter knives.  It was very difficult to cut the ribs in portions with those knives and serve it without the meat coming all lose !!!  We had waiters coming with the wrong order several times, and it looked as if they had no idea what went wrong, even our dessert order was wrong and to correct it took a very long time.\\n\\nThe waiting staff is very young, but they are nice, if they make a mistake, and they do, they happily correct it.\\n\\nWhen we stepped out to get back to our cars, there were still over 200 people waiting and a 30 yard long line of people in check-in process, with still more arriving.

We went up to the counter to order and given a choice of only pre-designed pies - nothing individually chosen. What? I'm paying premium costs and I can't even tell you what I want on my pizza? After doing so went to the seating area which has the atmosphere of a high school cafeteria, containing long wooden picnic bench style seating. Thankfully we found seats within about 5 minutes (we used the hover method to stake out those who looked closest to finishing). Our pizzas arrived just moments later. Thankful for that timing. Other poor souls, who I saw as we left, were left standing up against a wall, holding their trays as their pizza congealed. We had a group of 6, and had 5 pizzas. Since they're served on giant cookie sheets, and we were seated shoulder to shoulder, we were stacking our cookie sheets on each other's to have room to eat. It was blazing hot from all of the pizza ovens and people, with Rat Pack music blaring. I'm going to have PTSD/flashbacks now every time I hear That's Amore.  We went out to dinner so we could see old friends we hadn't seen in several months and we couldn't even converse. The pizzas were good, but not anything special, particularly not worth dealing with the high price and horrible dining room. The toppings were pretty sparse.

Let me start from the beginning. I called and made reservations early in the day for a party of 6 at 8 p.m. We arrived about 10 minutes after 8 p.m. The host told us to go wait by the bar. At this time, the place was crazy crowded, to the point of fire hazard. It was difficult to get through the restaurant without feeling a little violated; but I accept that because it was a Saturday night in Inman Park, after all.  But the energy at the bar was pretty awesome. Despite being overwhelmingly packed, we were served pretty quickly, followed by one of the bartenders walking on the bar to give everyone a fun shot on the house. While we waited outside the restaurant, a bartender actually came outside to give the people waiting some sangria, also on the house. We waited about an hour and 45 minutes for a table (even with the reservations). For the record, I do feel that had we not followed up with the host (who was the GM) repeatedly, we might not have gotten a table (squeaky wheel gets the grease kind of deal). What would have been a one-star review turned into a four-star review when we were finally seated at about 9:45. Immediately and without prompting, we were provided with two bottles of champagne and six tapas - all on the house. In addition, the GM gave us tokens for free tapas on our next visit. We truly appreciated all of the gestures and, surprisingly, it really made up for the long wait. The service was great, the food was yummy, and overall, they were beyond accommodating following an icky experience. In conclusion, they have customer service and food figured out at Barcelona. They know how to impress unhappy customers. They don't quite have reservations and crowding figured out, but I don't know that that is necessarily something that a popular, cool restaurant has to figure out. I highly recommend against going on a Saturday night. Go at any other time and you will likely be impressed and leave full and happy."},{"name":"The Sub-way","address":"235 Newton St","city":"Waltham","stars":"4.5","text":"No frills sub shop; the thing that sets them apart is the fact that they have a real grill, not that flat-top grill that you get at most pizza shops.

I love this place. \\n\\nHaving worked at a cafe, I have a very discerning opinion of cafes. No dunks or starbucks for me. I am such a fan of coffee, I drink it decaf... yeah you read me right. I don't drink it for the caffeine high, I drink it for the aesthetics of coffee. Most recently, I drink it black with splenda, and sometimes a splash of skim milk, so the staining effect is not quite so pronounced on my teeth (or I imagine the skim milk helps)\\n\\n\\nLet's start with the coffee-\\nIt's good hot or cold. Unfortunately, they do not have Iced Decaf coffee, which lost them half a star. \\nThe coffee is flavorful and not silty. \\nThis is one of the few places I've seen baristas who can actually pull good espresso shots. Not to strong, not too weak, with a good crema. \\n\\nThe food is terrific for the most part, but a little pricey. I'm talking an $8 sandwich the size of your hand (w/ fingers stretched... unless you're a giant). The baked items are decadent, more like deserts than breakfast items. The ginger lemon scones are my favorite. Flour lacks on-the-go savory items, though, losing them another half star. They have pockets (pesto and the ham & Swiss) as well as the Cheddar scallion scone. Also breakfast pizzas, but none of those feel right for breakfast. They used to have amazing oatmeal, but they got rid of it, maybe for the season? Currently, I am surviving on their croissants, which are very well made-- crispy and buttery without being overly oily.  Sometimes they offer veggie crudites with a hummus-like dip, i wish they offered that more regularly. Before I move on, I must suggest the breakfast sandwich, which is hefty. Definitely not your $2 bagel-egg-and-cheese at dunks, but well worth the extra dollars. The bfast sandwich is taller than it is thick, has a hefty portion of egg, that doesn't have the consistency of a fake egg, and comes with bacon/ham, arugula and horseradish mayonaise (?). So good, i'm droolin' a bit thinking about it. \\n\\nThe staff is super friendly, and all unique. Despite having smiles all the time they don't act like auto-ma-tons, which is definitely appreciated at 7 in the butt-crack of morning, and you can think about is how you feel like a butt-crack willing yourself into work. \\n\\nAnyway, I absolutely go out of my way to be there. \\nOne word of warning, the boston one is right by the children's museum so you will have to wade through children at lunch time.\\nEveryone who knows me, knows I don't like kids, I even blogged about it, but I still stand right by those screaming bundles of flesh to get a taste of Flour."},{"name":"Kal√©","address":"50 SW Pine St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I had never had Kale before, even though I lived in Japan for quite some time.

The young man walking around with the tablet was annoying and made you feel rushed.  I understand that turning tables ties directly to turning a profit but maybe be less obvious about it.

It was pretty busy for a cool rainy Friday night. I was impressed with the menu, lots of interesting choices. I ended up ordering  the tenderloin risotto and a Caesar salad.  The salad was good. I found the dressing was good, it could have used a hint of more garlic, but all in all, I couldn't complain. There was a crispy breadstick on the plate instead of croutons. The risotto was excellent. The tenderloin was cooked perfectly (medium) and was very tender. The risotto was creamy. The risotto was over some spinach leaves. The only thing I could say about my dish is that it was on the small side. I have a small appetite and found it satisfying, but I feel that someone with a larger (normal) appetite might find the meal on the small side. I think a bit more risotto would have done the trick. The price of my meal was $15.00 which I felt was a good value. My date, on the other hand did not have a good meal, which is why I could not give one more star in my review. He ordered the salmon. He took one bite and immediately said he did not like it, and that it did not taste as fresh as he would have liked. He did not tell this to the waiter. He just did t not eat any more than the one bite. The waiter asked him if it was ok and he didn't say it was bad, he just said he did not want it. The waiter did not push to find out why. I personally would not pay for a meal that I was not able to eat, but this was a first date and I did not question or push the situation. The inedible salmon was $23. \\nThe ambiance at Siro's is lovely. The service was good. Perhaps the waiter should have pushed to find out about my date's meal, but that's just a judgment call, and not necessarily a bad one. \\nAll in all, I had a lovely meal at Siro's and would definitely give this place another try.

The places near me, Shawarma King and Rami's, charge exactly TWICE as much for the same item that is less tasty.\\n\\nAnyways, on to the food. Shawarma can be dry in general so the fresh hummus is a great complement. The kebabs taste fresh off the grill. Also, I'm a bit of a rice snob and this rice was perfect...plump, cooked right, with just the right amount of flavor. If you prefer sandwiches, then like the other reviewers, I recommend the King's special which is chock full of falafel, hummus, and your choice of meat...omg.\\n\\n***UPDATE***\\nLamb shank plates are the Friday special.

We spoke to all of them at different times, and it is certainly true what is said about Southern Hospitality-- People in the South are just so nice and willing to open up and have genuine conversations with you. I love it! This was the case with our busser; we engaged in conversation with him as well. The owner (who is Japanese) was also really nice and everyone came to our table at one point or another to ask if everything was ok. The food was good, though not the best Japanese food I have ever had; having said that, I would definitely return and eat here again, because the food was a bit better than \\"Good,\\"and the customer service was superb. \\n\\nFree Valet parking. They have a Japanese garden. Restaurants need up-keep and re-modeling. Decor was simple, the sushi bar was all kinds of awesome with White shelled-shaped chairs. The restaurant tables were a bit stuffy and out-dated, but that kinda stuff is just cosmetic. Give me good food and great customer service and you can guarantee I will be back there. \\n\\nAfter our meal, our server gifted us with a ginger ice-cream (on the house) which was reeeeally delicious. \\n\\nThe damage was $50 which seemed fair for the amount of food we had ordered and the wonderful evening we'd had!"},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Love it!!

We came here HANGRY and I'll be the first to admit that we might have over-indulged. In addition to the duck ($17) and chicken wings ($12), we also ordered the pickles ($5), duck confit fry bread ($7), house special pho ($14), and the betel beef brochette ($6, think the Vietnamese version of the Greek dolmades!) We were stuffed to the max for two people. Items were reasonably priced and the portions were fair. They have a great selection of beers on tap as well. Our bill came to about $78 not including tip. \\n\\nI would love to give this place 5 stars, but the service could use a bit of improvement. It took a while for our server to come take our order, despite our closed menus and my many attempts to make eye contact to get her attention. Also, our food started coming all at once which became over-whelming (and not to mention, very little table space!) so I had to ask our server to ask the kitchen to slow down (something that I feel a more experienced server would know to do). \\n\\nI will definitely be coming back to try the many other delicious-sounding menu items."},{"name":"Rocco's Tacos & Tequila Bar","address":"7468 W Sand Lake Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I went here on a Saturday night with a friend.

We split the smoked trout and tried out some of the oysters from the raw bar. He ordered the bucatini, which was incredible. Based off a recommendation, I ordered the warm lobster roll. I've never had a better lobster roll in my life (but I'm also convinced they used an entire stick of butter, which would explain it).\\n\\nAs brilliant as the food was, it didn't even hold a candle to the beer. Their draught/bottle menu is comparable to (if not infinitely better than) beer lists you can find at places like Local 149 and Tip Tap Room. I started with the Interlude and then got the Iduna Cru, which were both rich and unique in flavor. They also complimented the food nicely. They told us that their menu is updated constantly, so the beers I ordered might not even be worth mentioning, but I would definitely recommend either.\\n\\nThe service was alright; you could tell the waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu, and she didn't even falter when asked to describe the Fish of the Day. She seemed a bit lacking in her hospitality skills, but to give her credit, it was pretty noisy, and I'm not sure if she could fully hear us.\\n\\nAll together our bill came out to over $100 for the two of us; what I would consider a splurge.

Well, was I ever wrong.\\n\\nI spent time abroad in Spain, and never encountered the variety of flavors that I experienced in a 3-course meal at Black Cat. Our waitress, Lizouli (Liz?), was as empassioned about their food as they come. We ignored the menu at first as she regaled us with vivid descriptions of the ingredients and textures and flavors of each dish. She loved the food, and she knew it. It was like she was talking about a familiar place, and we desperately wanted to go there. We ended up going with her recommendations, and damn - she knew what she was talking about.\\n\\nWe shared the Shrimp Ceviche, which is NOT something my boyfriend would typically order on his own or try. He loved it. I was IN love with it. The flavors, the fresh fruit, the tangy lime, the cilantro... my tastebuds are going crazy right now just thinking about it.\\n\\nSecond course was the Panuchos... fall-apart tender marinated pork atop perfectly fried mini corn tortillas, with a refried black bean layer and a habanero sauce that was too spicy for even me. The flavors, again, assailed my senses and it turned out to be the kind of meal that I assessed with my eyes open at first - appreciated its colors, its textures - then closed my eyes and let my other senses do the rest.\\n\\nThe third course was a particularly delectable Argentinian sandwich, with tender steak, ham, fried egg, cheese, all atop a delicious moist bun. The little potato \\"chips\\" were the best fries I've had in a while. You can tell they're done with love in a pan, with fresh oil, instead of in a stale deep fryer. All of these ingredients, we were told, are organic, GMO-free, and many gluten-free. You can truly taste the difference.

I ordered the kale and artichoke dip as well and it was ok, nothing out of the ordinary.  I sampled the nacho which looked good but too messy for my taste and it was decent, you do get a lot of nacho. My favorite item was the smoked chicken wings they did have a bit of a spicy after taste which 3 out of the 4 of us agreed on , but not too spicy to eat. You get 10 wings so the value is decent for the product.

You sign in with the hostess, and if there's a wait, you are not worried because, knowing that the county is dry, you have come prepared with your cooler of wine, beer, or cider (one time in college my friends and I brought our own keg). Also there is outdoor seating for waiting parties, picnic benches, even live music and a lemonade stand!  The last time I was there, I saw that they added some picturesque grapevines, a wine-tasting room, bocce games, and a kids' play area.  Salt Lick is really stepping up its game!\\n\\nOnce you make it inside, you walk past this enormous smoker where huge sausages hang and huge hunks of brisket are carved before your covetous eyes!  Of course, you order the family-style platter, which comes with unlimited sausage (my favorite!), brisket, ribs, raw onions, pickles, enormous loaves of fresh bread, German potato salad (made with vinegar, not mayo), beans, and coleslaw.  And of course, a mixed blackberry-peach cobbler a la mode to share afterward!  The brisket has a beautiful smoke ring around it, the ribs have a nice bark, the sausage is divinely smoky and zesty and juicy and you drizzle that yummy, vinegary homemade BBQ sauce over all of it.  Try NOT to dance in your seat or let your eyes roll back in your head as you sample a little of everything! \\n\\nSalt Lick is my favorite place to bring my friends who don't live in Texas, and they are always blown away, not just by the delicious food, but by the festival-like atmosphere.

That's where my props end.  I want to like this place, I really do.  But I can't.  I have tried it three times.  The food is likely the most vile that I've eaten, and last night's pulled pork mac and cheese was a colossal train wreck. The texture of the mac and cheese was like velveeta, but even velveeta would have had a cheesier taste.  The pulled pork mixed in with it was not \\"delightful and scrumptious\\" as our waitress said, but rather was incredibly over salty and chewy.  I ate two bites and pushed it away.  I was charged 12.95 for a small bowl of absolute crap that should never be served anywhere at any time.\\n\\nSo then I asked my waitress what else she recommended.  \\"Our biscuits are to die for,\\" so naturally I ordered a biscuit and asked to have a side of sausage gravy.  The biscuit came out.  It was a miserable looking thing.  Small, hard, and stale and tasted like you would imagine.  The sausage gravy that came out ten minutes later was cold and bland, though not disgusting (like the mac and cheese).\\n\\nMy friend had a cheese omlette which came with home-fries and toast.  My poor friend.  He got a pile of a dry yellow egg-like substance that reminded me of the egg-like substance you get at fast food places.  There was no cheese.  There was no anything.  Just literally a pile of cooked egg mixture.  This one cost 9.95.  That should be illegal.\\n\\nOur waitress was nice enough, but she had too many tables and consequently it took two hours to get in and out of here.  Had the dining experience been a good one, I probably wouldn't have cared, but since we waited over an hour for absolute disgustingness on a plate, it seemed a bit too long.  The waitress didn't care that we hated our meals.\\n\\nThat being said, this place was jam packed.  THAT is baffling.  I have tried this place three times.  The last time I went for breakfast and every part of my meal was just as bad.  My friend that time and I both had omlettes and orange juice.  Neither one of us could eat more than a few bites of the gross crap on a plate and it cost us $34 for breakfast, for a really, really bad breakfast.  Again, our waitress on that occassion told us that she wasn't allowed to remove anything from the check and was sorry we hated our food.\\n\\nBravo bananans!

Every significant celebration seemed to happen here - my 26th birthday was quite the dinner here with my parents and they were relatively new at that time. When I came home (living in San Francisco at the time) for my 30th birthday, we also celebrated here. Significant job promotions, parents' wedding anniversaries, etc. When my Dad passed away, my Mom and I came for dinner on his first birthday 6 months after - as we felt it was the right way to honor him.\\n\\nAfter quite the hiatus, I returned last night for their annual January truffle specials. A few friends and I showed up for a 6pm reservation and we were seated immediately. Our service started out to be exactly what I was accustomed to - attentive, consistent, and excellent. Carlos was our lead server, with Jenny (I believe was her name) as the secondary. Unfortunately, she was losing her voice, so it was hard to hear her. She was a trooper and took great care of us despite feeling under the weather.\\n\\nWe perused the menu and were intrigued by all 5 specials - 4 of which had black or white truffles. Since there were 5 of us at the table, we decided to order them all and share. We also ordered some apps to start - and to be fair, in my half dozen (or more) past visits here, I have always ordered the carpaccio. It is my clear favorite appetizer here. \\n\\nWhat we ordered - \\nAppetizers:\\nCarpaccio di manzo - Beef carpaccio\\nProsciutto San Daniele e mozzarella di bufala - Prosciutto with buffalo mozzarella\\nInsalata di Marco - Arugula & Romaine Lettuce with cherry tomatoes, olives, capers,\\ngreen beans, cucumbers, e.v.o.o. & whole grain mustard \\n\\nMains:\\nWhite truffle risotto\\nTaglionlini e tartufo - white truffle pasta\\nPaccheri con branzino e tartufo nero - Pasta with sea bass and Burgundy black truffles\\nOsso Bucco (veal shank)\\nFilleto di manzo - Filet Mignon with Black Truffles\\n\\nDesserts:\\nMousse al cioccolato - Chocolate Mousse\\nSemifreddo al torrone - Nougat Ice Cream Cake\\nGelato alla Mandorla - Almond gelato\\nPecorino Toscano\\n\\nIf you aren't into raw meats, then skip the carpaccio and get the prosciutto, but if you are willing you just have to get the carpaccio. It is light, refreshing, with the sharp Parmesan. Antica Posta has the best version of this Italian classic I have ever eaten. I crave it. The Marco salad is also delectable - a little bit of everything - if a salad is what you are looking for.\\n\\nAs for the mains, I am a huge fan of their Osso Bucco. Again, it is the best I have had anywhere (except when my Dad would make it). The only thing that lacked last night, was crusty bread to smear the marrow onto. The truffle specials (all but the sea bass as I cannot eat fish) were delicious - but by far the stand out was the Filet Mignon. They referred to the black truffle on top as a carpaccio of black truffle... all I know was that is was one of the best steaks I have had in ages (that I did not cook myself). The Earthy, truffley goodness married with the perfect medium-rare filet - was an amazing flavor combination. I was actually annoyed that I only got to eat one-fifth of the steak. If I wasn't full, I would have ordered an entire other steak to eat all by my lonesome. I might need to go back...\\n\\nDespite all we ate, we ordered dessert. Due to my tree nut allergy, I enjoyed my chocolate mousse and did not taste anything else at the table. Obviously, nothing else was safe (well the cheese was fine, but I was content with my dark chocolate). Smooth, rich, creamy - and not too much of it to make me regret eating dessert.\\n\\nNow for the loss of 1-star. Between clearing our dinner dishes and letting us order dessert, we were ignored for over 30 minutes and trying to get either of our servers' attentions was nearly impossible. So our dinner ended up being 3 hours instead of 2 - a disappointment considering my previous experiences and earlier in the evening. I know they had gotten busy, but waiting 30 minutes from giving us menus and checking in - not acceptable. It will not prevent me from returning, but it does keep them at 4-stars. \\n\\nBy far, my best dining experience in Buckhead."},{"name":"Row 34","address":"383 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I absolutely loved my meal here.

As far as Mexican food or even Tex Mex, it's okay. Definitely not a true taqueria. The service was fair, no complaints. Although I do appreciate when I go to a Mexican restaurant and both the front end and kitchen staff are comprised of a mix of cultures, seems like all of the kitchen staff and bus boys were latin but none of the servers or bartenders. \\nChips & Salsa: the chips had good flavor but tasted like they had been fried more than once, too hard. The salsa was basically tomatoes, no heat but it had decent flavor. I asked for a spicier salsa and was given the Adobo salsa, it was spicy but was way too smokey and I was unknowingly charged $0.99. The charge wasn't the problem, I just was not informed of it by the server. Need to have more salsa options.\\nFish Tacos (battered/fried) with Mexican Chorizo Rice & Refried Beans: The corn tortillas were good, the fish had no flavor and neither did the batter. The batter was not crispy. Usually 1 taco should have 1 good size piece of crispy battered white fish, each taco had 2 soggy battered pieces which made the tacos dry. The coleslaw was lacking lime flavor and had to ask for some lime wedges. The chipotle mayo was also sadly lacking flavor and any spiciness. Had to add hot sauce and salt as well as a generous squeeze of lime. A green salsa comes on the side and it was okay, mostly tasted like tomatillos but it's not what you would traditionally put on a Mexican style fish taco. \\nThe Mexican Chorizo rice sounds like it could be interesting, seeing as I have never heard of putting chorizo in rice but alas it was also lacking flavor and again no spice. \\nThe refried beans tasted and looked like they came out of a can, very sad as these are cheap and easy to make. \\nJalapeno Mac n' Cheese: I love Mac n' Cheese but this one is just sad. The cheese is watery and kinda tasted like Velveeta. It had jalapenos that did not add flavor or spice. \\nSadly not a place I would come to again for Mexican food."},{"name":"Kiko Japanese Cuisine","address":"110 S Semoran Blvd","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"Pretty good food for the value.

The bento box had plenty of pork, two pork chops sliced but not enough rice and a definitely lack of noodles. The katsu sauce tasted like a thicker tempura sauce. The bento box came with a salad in it. I was expecting a ginger salad but it was a weird vinegar slaw with cucumbers and carrots. I wouldn't really consider what I ordered as a bento box because usually bento boxes come with a sushi roll or some dumplings or a spring roll.

Once we had our food we had to again flag down a waiter for more water. Let me be clear, the restaurant had four other tables besides us, and as a server, this would not be considered busy enough to warrant slow  service.

I've heard this place dishes out new employees regularly because the managers or whomever treats them so badly. It was enough to dissuade me from applying here. Nor is their food good enough to keep me coming back. For 1 person, I've easily spent $16 for food that left me feeling disappointed and robbed. Once I got their Tuna Burger with Sweet Potato Crisps, which turned out smelling and tasting awfully fishy and \\"crisps\\" that looked more like sushi ginger!!

It's reminiscent of what Buckhead used to be before that night life was erased--a certain rush of frenetic, celebratory activity. But first I'm going to point out my criticisms of this Barcelona, and then I'll talk about the things that impressed me. \\n\\nFirst: Barcelona seems to be a victim of its own success. Lines out the door with hordes of people anxiously awaiting some space to sit and be part of the scene. So *make reservations*. We had reservations, but Barcelona won't seat you until your entire party arrives. Last one in gets a rotten egg. (Not really.) It's standing room only around the bar. Sometimes people aren't so accommodating if you need them to move (and you're on your way to the restroom). It was crowded. And loud. The kind of loud where someone turns up the music on the PA so you can hear it above the loudness, and of course, everyone gets louder to be heard above the music. Loud. So. Freaking. Loud. \\n\\nSecond: The timing of events seemed to suffer from some weird delays. For instance, it was a LONG time between the finish of our last dish and the ability to even ask for a dessert menu. And then dessert took a long time to reach the table. The entire rhythm of the thing seemed off. I had to think the long line of people maybe wouldn't be so long if some of the table-side issues could be ironed out. OTOH, it's also clear that staff has a LOT to do amid all that buzz, especially elbowing one's way through seas of waiting patrons who don't want to move out of your way. \\n\\nThat being said, the food we had was outstanding. And the drinks were very good. True to their name, Barcelona keeps a serious wine list, and the servers seem to get some training on the things that are on the menu. The sangria is seductive. \\n\\nAmong the small plates we tried, a few things really outshone everything else on the table:\\n\\nDuck Two Ways - one of the best things on the table that evening. Slices of duck and with a wing (or something) on top of some really delicious potato hash. \\n\\nThe ham & cheese croquettes, which have a much fancier name on the menu, were my favorite thing on the table. They needed more ham, but were delicious. \\n\\nThe mushrooms were an exercise in simplicity and deliciousness. The calamari was fried very lightly and served with a tasty aioli. (I think it was an aioli.) And I also liked the Spinach & Chickpea dish. One of us called it \\"spinach hummus.\\" Tasty. \\n\\nBy comparison, the Brussel sprouts (which were delicious) seemed average compared to the things I just listed. Same with the Hanger Steak (the most expensive small dish). Again, it tasted good, but it didn't stand out among the others. \\n\\nNow the desserts blew us all away. We stopped *this short* of ordering everything on the dessert menu. Instead we ordered three: \\n\\nThe Warm Chocolate Hazelnut Indulgence was served with a raspberry sauce & coconut ice cream. Total crowd pleaser. \\n\\nThe Churros Y Chocolate, served with a dark chocolate dipping sauce, was perhaps my favorite dessert. The churros were very light, and I had to restrain myself from licking dark-chocolate sauce out of the bowl. \\n\\nThe Crepas Salguero is a very close second favorite for me. Filled with Dulce de Leche and served with chocolate cauce & vanilla ice cream. It didn't even need the ice cream. In fact, they should just leave the ice cream off and give me another crepa.  \\n\\nWe need to go back and try one of the larger, \\"for sharing\\" dishes. It says they take a little while to prepare those, so we'll probably get there while it's still daylight...

There was a huge amount of fish in the tacos and a huge portion of delicious rice and black beans, so you won't leave hungry. The tacos were also very flavorful and fresh. The guacamole was delicious and fresh, it was handcrafted table side and the portions are definitely more copious than Besito guacamole, a similar Mexican chain restaurant. The chips were well seasoned and crispy. The vibe is a sort of Mexican American hipster vibe mixed with we are the touristy part of Orlando and proud of it vibes.

This place is dressed to the nines....where does that saying even come from??? anyway....this place has attitude, almost as if the restaurant itself is talking to you, telling you how good of a time you are about to have. \\n\\nNext, lets get the food out of the way, it's good yes, but that isn't what makes this place off the heezy fo sheezy. The taco's are yummy in my tummy, my favorite being the chorizo but all that I tried were great. Rocco's chips are seasoned, just the right amount of spice. I don't really think you can go wrong with anything on the menu as I have been here multiple times with large groups and the majority of the sounds coming from mouths were not words but different variations of the sound someone makes when they are really enjoying what they are eating.\\n\\nIf that was all this place offered, it'd be a winner in my book but what really Roccos My Sockos is how they are able to combine the aforementioned qualities of a great place to eat dinner with a lively nightlife atmosphere. There are 4 strategically placed bars throughout the joint: two completely inside, one which is half inside but also serves the back patio (which over looks a lake!) and another on the front patio (yes, this place has front and back outdoor areas!) The DJ spins Top 40 and the drinks begin to flow.....if you're not having a good time here, there is something seriously wrong with you.\\n\\nINSIDER TIP: Other reviews are right, this place is similar to Blue Martini when it comes to cougars on the prowl\\n\\nINSIDER TIP: They offer (more like make you) valet your car. Almost the entire parking lot is coned off for valet......it's complimentary but if you don't want some random stranger driving your brand new Aston Martin (or you're just to cheap to tip the valet) you can park over by the Publix and walk.\\n\\nFUN FACT: The Man The Myth The Legend, Rocco himself is known to show up from time to time. He puts on white platform shoes, plays Tequila, gets on the bar and pours free patron shots into your mouth. I even saw him dump half a bottle into some lucky patron's margarita pitcher!  He was there on my Bday and gave everyone whose Bday it was a free bottle of tequila, not sure if this is an all the time deal though.

Having lived in Asia(mostly Penang) for 20+ years, I'd like to believe that I'm somewhat qualified (to a certain extent) to be able to distinguish between 'bad' and 'good' chinese/asian food. Then again, food is such a subjective thing - it can vary from one person to another. Some people love durian - others don't (little hint of my food experience) - some love balut, others think its disgusting.\\n\\nI have to admit, some of the items on the menu are subpar, however, overall, there are some 'must try' dishes that one of the best available of its kind in the Boston area.\\n\\nMy first experience here wasn't good AT ALL as I had ordered the wrong things, in fact, it took me 2 years to return to this place. I finally returned there with a Taiwanese friend and he managed to order all the right dishes - been coming here ever since.\\n\\nRecommending dishes to try is a difficult process as its impossible to know what people like and dislike. \\n\\nFor those who are going to try this place here is what I would recommend (will updated later):\\n1. Chinese Fried Dough (its freshly made) - Not sure what some reviewer was refering to it being greasy was but all you need to do is look around you and almost every table has at least one or two of these. You won't find anywhere in town where this is made to order. I would describe it as tasty and crispy though its tradition to eat it with soup or between the sandwiches.\\n\\n2. Steamed Spiced Spare Ribs - Its fall off the bone ribs on a bed of sweet potatoes with crushed steamed rice over it. This is a unique dish and a must try for those who like munching on cartilage. \\n\\n3. Pan Fried Turnip Cake - Different from most places. Texture is crispy on the outside, a little soft yet firm on the inside - and is made fresh.\\n\\n4. Spicy Beef Noodle soup - Imo, its one of the best in Boston. Yes, I've tried the versions at Shangri-la and Blue Cafe but the quality of the soup and beef itself is much better. There is no 'beefy' smell (For those 'hardcore' fans of this soup, I urge you to compare this to Blue Cafe's and let me know if I'm wrong). \\n\\n5. Shao-Bing with Beef Sandwich - An oven-toasted multi-layered pastry with sesame seeds with slices of seasoned beef and vertically sliced scallions with a light dash of sauce. Seldom find this elsewhere in the Boston area.\\n\\n6. Chilled Beef slices: Selected cuts of beef shanks/shin(because of its marble texture) are simmered in spices and then later chilled. They're then sliced thinly and brushed lightly with a soy based sauced. \\n\\nFood I would refrain from ordering:\\n1. Xiao Long Pau (Small Steamed Bun)\\n- This is traditionally a very difficult thing to prepare and I've not found a place in the entire New England Area where anyone has gotten it right. Skin is always too thick and chewy - so I usually get my fix when I go back to Asia. \\n\\n\\nFinal thoughts: \\n- If you're going to be there early and are trying to meet up with friends there, make sure they're on time. Don't hoard the table of 8 when only two have shown up and others are 'on the way in 20 minutes'. You'll get into trouble with the person running the place.\\n- For those expecting 'kiss your feet' service, remember, this is an asian restaurant - They're not 'rude' but like any other asian joint, time is important - they're not going to chat with you about how your day went and what you did last night. \\n- Those complaining about 'getting your check too early', once again, if you're going to let something as 'small' as that get to you, you're definitely better off dining at Paparazi's or Aquitaine for the fine dining experience. That's how the place does it - they usually leave your check on the table early but why should it bother you? if you need to add more items, they'll just update it. \\n\\nThat place is PACKED for a reason, simply because the food is pretty good (YES even with the shortcomings in 'service'). To avoid the hassle of crowds and service, you can always call to order and pick it up later."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"I had the best BBQ in Texas so it's really hard for me to rate other BBQ places very highly.

Like everyone else, I really want to \\"like\\" this place because of the great atmosphere, but they have a lot of problems. For me, its their inconsistency. \\n\\nMy first time dining here was during the first month it was open and I had a very pleasant meal. Mushroom burger accompanied by their strawberry fields forever shake which was DIESEL. My boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffles. The waitress informed us that it would take 45 minutes but we were fine with it cause we had an appetizer and figured it was going to be wicked good if  it took that long, lol. His  meal ended up coming out in an hour....after mine. the food was decent and our server was nice. It was busy so we understood. Overall, a good experience.\\n\\nI came back a few more times where I received bad service. It'd be things like the server not providing silverware (it's usually already on the tables), waiting 10 minutes before being waited on as 1 of 4 tables in house AND the only table another time, forgetting appetizers, forgetting to make milkshakes, not regularly checking on tables...flavorless food sometimes (I added so much salt to my shepherds pie and it didn't even help).\\n\\nI usually get the strawberry shake and a basket of sweet potato fries. Sometimes the fries are sweet, and sometimes they have no taste at all. The milkshake is sometime has a great presentation (fresh cut strawberries and bananas on top of the whip cream with sprinkles)  which it should being 7 bucks....and other times, it's just the shake with whip cream. I guess it depends on your server. \\n\\nI still plan on going here...it's not that it's bad, it just they need a lot of improvement...with time I'm sure this will become a local favorite."},{"name":"Chambar","address":"568 Beatty Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Chambar is one of those restaurants that is a bit fancier than most but not pretentious in anyway. It's fairly casual in fact, which I liked as I'm not a big fan of formal dining.I really liked the setting of the restaurant and the service was excellent overall. We were also offered free appetizers since they had a large table and expected some delays so that was a nice touch. \\n\\nWe started with some shared mussels and fries and I have to say these were fantastic, I'm not a mussel connoisseur but they were delicious, the sauce they were in was to die for. Apparently Chambar is renowned for their fries but in all honesty I wasn't a huge fan, too thin and crispy for my liking but maybe that's the British in me who likes a thick chunky chip. We also had a side of bread and butter which was delicious, especially dipped in the mussel sauce. The free appetizer they brought was some sort of calamari venison wrap and a  small squid piece in some mild spicy sauce. It was bitesize but very good! \\n\\nFor mains I ordered the foie gras and a side of poutine. I found the foie gras extremely dense and almost unspreadable, not like the pate that I expected. It was as if it was just came out of the fridge and needed to be room temperature to be spreadable. It was good but nothing spectacular, and for $19 it was very small. Also, the cranberries it came with were frozen in ice, which seemed very odd to me. I'm not sure it was meant to be like this but it sort of ruined the warm toasted bread and foie gras. Overall I wasn't overly impressed, I love pate and was hoping for something similar, sadly this wasn't that.\\n\\nAs for the poutine, I was not a fan. I'm not a big blue cheese fan so that might be my fault for ordering it, but it was far too strong a cheese for poutine in my opinion and overpowered the dish. If anything I'd say the fries/poutine was the most disappointing part of the meal for me as I had heard such great things.\\n\\nGenerally I think everybody was content with their food and whole experience but perhaps not blown away, so I think 4 stars is reasonable.

The server will look for the number so you don't have to worry, even if you sit outside.

The fried chicken is crispier, but drier than Chick-fil-A's so my bf didn't like that nor the biscuit.  The syrup that is served with it was no ordinary one, but had a toffee(?)-like flavor which they call brown sugar. That bothered us so much that we asked for regular syrup, which turned out to not taste all that sweet nor good either. The french toast also did not taste custardy and appeared drier than normal too if you look at the cross-section in the picture. It was tough to cut into as well. This was our first time having challah bread french toast and we hope to have a better experience elsewhere. We were both sorely disappointed in the breakfast meal, which was exacerbated by the price we paid for.

They did a nice job renovating the restaurant and they have a wide selection of beers.  That's about it. \\n\\nOn my first trip my husband and I stopped in to get an after dinner drink and dessert.

We got a bottle so at least we didn't have to wait for a drink once they got there.  They really need to train the staff.  I was in the restaurant business for 15 years and they are missing ALL the basics.  The staff does not introduce themselves and do not engage people AT all.  Not once did they ask us if we wanted a menu or anything to eat .  We found out they have a pizza special when there is a game on from a staff member who was off duty and was drinking at the bar.  1/2 price pizza is a great special so I am not sure why they aren't pushing it.  They need to find a place for the staff to be when it is slow. They all just seem to hang out and definitely would rather talk with each other than wait on customers.  They all appear to have one speed and that is SLOW!!! You need to train your staff in basic hospitality or you have no hope of succeeding.

The bowl keeps it boiling throughout the meal. Its a little messy to put together as its served like fresh fajitas. Separate tortillas and toppings.

I remember thinking the first time we went \\"man this place is hard to find\\".  Sometimes just being on a major road is enough to keep you open and unless you're looking for the direction signs on Highland you'll be hard-pressed to find this restaurant (i know, not exactly an original review topic for PK).\\n\\nThat last time we visited they had only been open a short time and we were very blown away.  The food was nothing short of perfect and and the restaurant was bustling with patrons and diligent waitstaff.  Despite being under new ownership, the food was just as good this round, but patrons were nowhere to be found.\\n\\nUpon parking our car (we were the only car in the lot) we approached the building and noticed only a few occupied tables through the window.  As we entered, i noticed a sign that said \\"Parksedge Tapas and Coctails\\" (or something like that).  Turns out there's a change coming sometime early next year and the name \\"Pacific Kitchen\\" will be no more, as well as the cuisine.\\n\\nWe were seated at a 2-person table near the emergency exit along the wall.  Not exactly the best seat in the house, and right after we sat the other two tables cleared (it turns out they work at the restaurant and were just doing work).  I was bummed about getting the least-desirable seat despite being the only patrons.\\n\\nIn the middle of the room was a cluster of tables pushed together and it looked like a big group was coming.  As we inquired about the restaurant, the new name, and so on we were told the big group was \\"running really late\\" but I suspect that no one was really coming at all.\\n\\nAll in all the experience was rather depressing.  We thoroughly enjoyed our food (the steak was perfectly cooked @ medium rare and my diver scallops with fried Okra were equally perfect) and our service was great (we were, after all, the only table in the place).  But the atmosphere was so depressing that all we could think about was getting out of there ASAP.  Visually it's been updated, admittedly the redesign of the restaurant preceeded the new name and menu but without a few seated tables it just feels like an airy house.  \\n\\nI'd also add that $26 for 4 diver scallops, no matter how big they are, is a little excessive.  And by a little i mean a lot.\\n\\nAnyway, I'd suggest that you shy away from Pacific Kitchen unless you have a big group that needs quality food and a guaranteed on-time seating.

Living in Buford,GA, we did not know when that opportunity would arise.  However, after returning from a trip, we had to pick up our dogs from a good friend in Decatur.  What a perfect opportunity!  We picked up our good friend, Karla, and made our way to Little Five Points.  After slipping past the bar into the back room we settled in for a real treat.  We then selected three different drafts (all of which were fantastic) along with the goat cheese fritters and the Belgian fries.  All I can say is Wow!  \\n\\nAfter finishing the appetizers, we ordered our entrees.  I ordered the shrimp and grits and the girls split an order of bratwurst on a bed of kraut.  We had been so pleased with the beers that we had chosen, we asked our waitress, the charming and knowledgeable Rebecca, to select appropriate draft beers to accompany our entrees.  Of course we prefaced the request with information of what types of beer we did not like.\\n\\nThe shrimp and grits were the best I have ever eaten and the brats, made in house as was the kraut, were definitely taste treats.  I was particularly impressed by the kraut, which was unlike any I have ever had in the past.  \\n\\nThe three of us are already planning a return visit.

Moist, melt in your mouth lamb, and paired with Glendalough 13 year old single malt whiskey - a fine drink too - The distillery describes the whiskey's taste as having \\"an intense vanilla fudge luxurious sweetness\\" with \\"touches of fruit - lemon citrus, peach and dried apricot\\" - those flavors matched the lamb very nicely! I'm always impressed how great chefs can combine flavors in new ways.\\n\\nWe were also introduced to several cocktails made with whiskey and gin from Glendalough, and my absolute favorite was a gin cocktail made by beverage director Paulo Pereira - who may be one of the most innovative bartenders I have had the pleasure of meeting! He worked Chef Kopacz to combine grilled grapefruit, with gin and submerged a flavor exploding orb into the gin cocktail - the edible orb explodes with flavor in your mouth with the gin & grapefruit - it was a sensuous orgasm in the mouth - seriously.

Thus, I feel compelled to support my adoration.\\n\\nFirst, it is important to know that there are certain Screaming Goat menu items that are continuously delicious and others that tend to disappoint. Stick with whats good, my personal favorites are\\n\\n-Bean and cheese quesadillas (I add chorizo for extra pizzazz): the tortilla is perfectly golden on the outside, but the insides are where these quesadillas outshine every other I have EVER had, and thats saying a large something. Filled to the brim with flavorful refried beans, spicy chorizo and the most delicious gooey, melty white cheese. The cheese and beans ooze out  with each bite mmmmm.\\n\\n-Chips and salsa: They make homemade chips and 5 different types of salsa. Crispy, greasy these chips are perfectly salted and just thick enough to hold plentiful amounts of the salsa of your choice. I personally enjoy the roja and verde salsa, the verde being my favorite. Its green peppers, tons of garlic and has a nice sweet vinegar punch, incredibly spicy just how I like it. The best perk of the salsa is that you can buy a mason jar full of your favorite to take home, nothing beats fresh food fast!\\n\\n-Drowning flautas: I only get these when they are on special, which makes them like 25 cents per. I enjoy the chicken flautas covered in green sauce with extra cheese on top. The flautas are extra crunchy, the green sauce light, mild, and slightly tart while the cheese on top is rich in contrast and adds a slight but of saltiness. (I haven't tried any other varieties of flautas)\\n\\n-French fries: Some of my favorite french fries in Austin. They seem to have some sort of light batter, or coat that gives them more texture and crisp on the outside while remaining hot and creamy on the inside. (I get these as a side, not with the burgers that they usually come with that I find to be mediocre at best)\\n\\nGo to the Goat, its fresh, delicious and the ultimate comfort food meal.\\n\\nOrder: Chips w/ salsa, quesadillas\\n\\nAvoid: Burgers, and the torta"},{"name":"Escobar Restaurant and Tapas","address":"327 Peters St SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"First time coming was a lil worried from reading all the bad reviews but like they say u gotta try something out for ya self to find out if u like it or not I had the titty boi turkey burger it was delicious my first time ever having it my friend had the crab cakes and he loved it the only bad part are the chairs thought it was gonna break on me other then that I enjoyed it"},{"name":"Spring Creek Coffee House","address":"10600 SE McLoughlin Blvd, Ste 105","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This is walkable from my place.

Luckily there is a garage valet next door which solves most parking stress. Personally I am not fan of this whole bookstore and breakfast mix. The lines always get long and because you are waiting in line in a shared hallway you can't stand abreast. This whole setup is a mess. They should give out transceivers that vibrate when it's their time to eat. The setup of the restaurant doesn't really have a formal waiting area either. The dining room is on the second floor and is relatively packed. While clean, the tables seem rather used and the one we sat at rocked. Also since our table was just cleaned it was damp still. In addition the chairs were ok very skinny almost felt like those portable deck chairs. It's well lit and has bright colors. Overall I felt the dining room was a bit tight they really need to reduce the number of tables they have.\\n \\nService\\nIt's acceptable. I am not a fan of the host/hostess sometimes they seem to be quite arrogant since this place is very popular. Also they don't let you join the queue until your entire party has arrived and are not very friendly about it. The wait staffs are acceptable to a bit below average though. They are not rude, but also not overly interactive. The whole service felt rushed and robotic. They tend to disappear and if you ask another wait staff about your tables they tell you that they will \\"find them,\\" but I have some doubt they do. Also Water was refilled on an unsystematic basis which was rather annoying.\\n \\nFood\\nFood is nothing to write home about or complain about. Maybe my high expectations were based on its Yelp rating. On second thought I am not paying much, so I shouldn't have high expectations. It's your run of the mill breakfast with some flare by adding some fancier cheese and such. As a whole it's quite standard.\\n \\nValue\\nIt's relatively cheap, but the whole busyness of the restaurant and parking don't really make it worth it for me. It's not bad, but take an average breakfast place add in extended wait time, difficulty parking, and barely acceptable service and you have 2 star place. I would consider adding valet parking, reducing the number of tables in the dining room, and either increasing portion sizes or having some real flare to your breakfast items.

It was pretty quite considering it was a Thursday, except for one restaurant among a sea of Italian restaurants. \\n\\nI've been to Giacomo's three times and every time it's always packed to the hilt with a queue forming outside along its windows. The Jekyll and Hyde inside everyone becomes apparent during the transition from waiting to eating. When you're in line all you want to do is yell, punch, kick, and scream at the happy eaters to hurry their asses up because \\"I'm Hungry!\\". You ask yourself if anyone would notice if you went inside and just started taking food off peoples plates and guzzling wine right from their tableside wine bottles.   Would these crazy people who keep bumping into you care at all? Would anyone care?  Arghhhhhhh! It seems the moment you reach your \\"Jekyll Climax\\" your name is called and you feel happy/excited like you won a game of Keno from a deli in a Vegas hotel..... Once your seated you want to take your time sipping the wine slowly, savor every bite, then marinate in your chair hoping you get hungry again soon to finish the meal or maybe order more. \\n\\nGiacomo's is a 10 table sort of restaurant with a family country bumpkin feel. The recipes are surely passed down from grandma to granddaughter and so on. The menu is classic Italian in every way and very simple. Giacomo's sticks with what they know and trust me... they know Italian! \\n\\nEverything on the menu is very good; however, my favorite and the best Italian meal I've ever had was Giacomo's House Special. I've been all over Italy from Milan to Tuscany to Venice to Rome to Florance to Cinque Terre and back to Bellagio. Giacomo's was the best and cheap for what you get. \\n\\nThe House Special was designed for two people to split; however we were four and couldn't finish it. This behemoth of a pasta had a rich and spicy \\"arribiata\\" sauce which used lobster as its base. The linguine pasta had a dozen mussels, clams, calamari, shrimp, and scallops. It was then topped with an entire whole main lobster (about 2 lbs.). It was the kitchen sink of seafood pastas and everything was perfectly cooked. From the pasta being perfect aldente to the seafood being perfect texture. Words really can't do this review justice. It was a 6 out of 5! \\n\\nThe entire special was around $55 and included a bottle of wine. We ordered a 02' Chianti from Tuscany and it paired perfectly. Let me reiterate, I've never had a better Italian meal."},{"name":"Thai Town Restaurant","address":"1065 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Out of all the restaurants we ate at in Vancouver during our vacation, this was by far our favorite!

If I lived in Boston, I would seriously come here all the time. \\n\\nTip: try not to come in a large party. The smaller, the better since the place is literally the size of my living room."},{"name":"Falafel King","address":"48 Winter St, Ste 1","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I just finished my falafel and hummus sandwich.  I hadn't had one from Falafel King in awhile, and now I don't know why I'm not there every freakin' day. \\n\\nIt's so good.  I'm so happy and content right now.  It's the perfect lunch. The actual falafel are the best I've had.  Better than Sultan's Kitchen.  Better than Boston Kebab House.  Better than Schwarma King (but only barely).  Better than Andres.  And better than Boston Schwarma.  \\n\\nThey aren't too dry (Andres).  They aren't like rocks (that's you, Sultan's Kitchen).  They have a great flavor (unlike BKH).  And I love how they put pickles in your sandwich.  No other place does it.  It's probably breaking all sorts of middle eastern culinary rules, but I don' t care.  It adds something wonderful."},{"name":"Row 34","address":"383 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Very busy place. Lobster roll was fantastic.

Ave. \\n\\nThis is one of my favorite places to go in Boston. The food never sucks, the drinks are great, the cafe baristas are adorable, and the underwhelming trivia doesn't suck. If you're looking to sit down with a cup of tea (or coffee, I don't judge).\\n\\nThe tables are pretty small and very close together. Look at it as a cozy situation instead. Also, they renovated the back of the cafe to fit more booths (thumbs up!). If you sit in the front of the shop, enjoy your people watching.\\n\\nI always order the same thing: the Cape Codder. Imagine a delightful grilled cheese and ham (maybe?) with cranberry mayonnaise. Mouth watering. A little strange how all sandwiches comes with chips instead of french fries, but whatever, you do what you can."},{"name":"Alborz Persian Cuisine","address":"3300 W Anderson Ln, Ste 300","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I've only been for the lunch buffet, but I've always left satisfied.

We were seated in a doorway next to the kitchen door.  My chair was shaking all through dinner from the constant race of waitstaff brushing my back.  The noise from the kitchen and hallway was so loud I couldn't hear our waitress and had to ask her to speak up repeatedly.  We didn't ask to be moved because we assumed it was just a really busy evening, but nearby tables for two never filled up.  We had reservations and the restaurant wasn't busy.  I'm not sure why we didn't make the cut for a normal dining room table.  We did mention feeling uncomfortable, but were met with a blank stare.  Ruined the evening.  It was like paying a few hundred dollars to eat in a diner.  I will not be returning.  There are much better options in the area."},{"name":"WINGS Granville","address":"1162 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"Love their wings. They have so many choices and not to mention if you come here when the canucks are playing and depending where you sit, you might win a prize.

Very flavorful and not over dried or over soggy. Just Awesome"},{"name":"The Porter Beer Bar","address":"1156 Euclid Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"This was a place I really wanted to check out and we had our chance! Walking in, it did look small but since they were taking names to be seated I knew it had to be more than just the bar. It's narrow until you pass the bar but then it opens up with seating. The back room is so vintage looking I love it. It has the bottles lined up on seemingly endless rows of shelves on an elevated floor above all the tables. \\n\\nWhat the real turn on was the beer list, or the list that gets you lost. You almost need to have something in mind before you get there or else you could spend hours trying to figure out what type of beer you want let alone what exact beer you should get. I don't think you should get caught up with what this bar has versus another... a lot of the bars have extensive beer lists, great atmospheres, and the bottom line is that you have more than enough to choose from. In fact, I think this says a lot: http://bit.ly/ib6HXi. \\n\\nIn any case, the beers we ordered were excellent (as expected) but the food was just okay. I thought the fries were good but I have had better. The cheese plate was fine. The salted brownie just didn't cut it... it's like they oversalted the brownie itself and it became gross instead of a complement to the sweetness. The bottom line is that I didn't come here for the food and my review is based on the ambiance and the beer and the people and that combo easily earns it 5 stars.
