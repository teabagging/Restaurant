IN ONE DAY.For brunch, I ordered the KOREAN FRIED CHICKEN (rice, house kimchi, sweet and spicy korean fried chicken, eggs two ways) - $14. It also had some pickled cucumbers, which are my fave, and put a smile on my face. The sunny side up egg was perfect because I'm a sucker for that golden yolk.  The balance of flavors and textures really made this dish enjoyable. The crunchy tenderness of the chicken, the softness of the rice, the tart bite of the kimchi, and the sweet and light crunch of the cucumbers, all married together with that creamy golden yolkiness. It was a bit reminiscent of my mother's bibimbbap, only with that sweet, spicy, and crunchy chicken in the mix. A very filling dish that propelled me to have a full Portland day.For dinner, I ordered the GOAT CHEESE DUMPLINGS ARRABIATTA (3 fat dumplings filled with goat cheese bathing in a spicy tomato sauce) - $15. The garlic bread that it came with was delicious and useful in scooping up the sauce with dumplings. This dish was very comforting since it was raining and cold out. I would get it again for sure.Downside: the wait can be a bit long. Luckily, as a lone traveler, I was able to get a seat across the kitchen. This was fun for 2 reasons: 1) no wait and 2) I love watching the kitchen do its thang.Overall, a great place to dine with a lovely warm atmosphere.

The wait was about 45 mins but we decided to stick it thru. \\nThe weather was nice and we had \\"quaint\\" (code word for incredibly small) table outside overlooking Virginia Highlands. \\nWe got our menus and quickly felt overwhelmed because ALL the brunch items sounded impeccable and delicious. No better reason than to oder a mimosa to help us \\"concentrate\\"..... I had read on yelp that a young lady had a blueberry mimosa so I ordered that and my roomie got the traditional. Our server, her name escapes me, explained to me that it was made with blueberry vodka and had fresh blueberries in it. Another server delivered our drinks and I was rather confused as to if mine was correct because it had no blueberries but a great blueberry flavor. Meanwhile the patrons next to me had blueberries floating perfectly in his mimosa. Hmph. \\nWe finally settled on meals. The parmesan crusted chicken for me, french toast with strawberries for my best friend. In the meantime we saw other tables dining on complimentary bread. It took a while for our bread to come, but I imagine it's baked fresh so we didn't stress it much. When it arrived it was AMAZING. I don't like Biscuits, I know, I know.... mentally unstable, but these were warm and soft and buttery and the muffin of the day was pear ginger and it was stellar. The homemade jams and honey butter was a good compliment to the bread. Now the moment you've all been waiting for. *drumroll please* BRUNCH IS SERVED. My plate looked beautiful but........... note the menu states: parmesan crusted chicken with a fried egg, frisee, lardons and a lemon butter sauce. I guess now is a good time to tell you I am a trained, acclaimed chef, yes, it has relevance to the story. I didn't have frisee but baby spinach, no lardons were present anywhere on my plate and someone without food knowledge could have easily been fooled by these tiny mistakes. I told my server about the lardons and she said she'd bring some for me and presented me with a single strip of bacon. -_- Okie dokie. The flavors in the food itself were amazing. My grits were creamy and flavored with Asiago or some other hard milk cheese. The chicken was light and crunchy and seasoned well. The highlight of the plate was honestly the lemon butter sauce. I love lemon butter sauce and that one was spot on. \\nMy roomie enjoyed her meal equally as much as I did. Overall, Murphys has amazing food. I'd definitely go back but it would be wise of them to stand true to the menu. Oh one more thing, there is a drastic up charge for a blueberry mimosa versus a traditional one and I was NOT informed until I saw the check.

My husband and son ended up eating with me. My only sad point is I didn't order the right egg.

And not much butter on it. We had to ask for more melted butter to 'help' our lobster, which was room temp, not warm. The butter warmed it up, and then we could eat it.\\nGlasses of wine are $15? Please. Ridic.\\nMy man had ice water, but I was chilly (rained all day), so I asked for hot tea. Nope. Plain hot water? Nope. Don't they have a mug and a microwave? Apparently not.\\nSo, maybe the oysters are the reason to experience Neptune, but we were not impressed with our lobster roll at all. It's nice they have cold or hot ones, but wish that practice extended to drinks, too.\\n(BTW, Arnold's in Eastham makes a good one.)"},{"name":"Roadworthy","address":"125 Washington St","city":"Dedham","stars":"5","text":"Wife and I come here a lot.

I would have given it 3 stars if it weren't for the view. We are still searching for the restaurant, that for us sets 'the bar' in Portland. Right now that is El Gaucho. We still have yet to go to either Ringside Steakhouse or Jake's Grille, didn't care for Urban Farmers 'outdoor cafe' style atmosphere, and Jake's Crawfish is somewhat rundown needs updating, just like El Gaucho does.

This place fit the bill. They have an extensive craft beer list, and the cocktail list featured a lot of floral liquors and intriguing combinations.We ordered the pork belly as well as the broccoli and cheddar (which were two of the three permanent menu items), along with the salmon with fiddleheads and house fries. The house fries were my least favorite, not just because they were lacking flavor, but also because they were paired with a banana ketchup that really just missed the mark for me.However, the other items were all very nice. The pork belly was perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside, succulent on the inside, and served over a chewy wild grain. I would order this again. The rather dull sounding broccoli and cheddar was actually broccolini topped with crumbled white cheddar and lemon - and it was delicious! Finally, the salmon was fresh, perfectly cooked, and paired really well with the fiddlehead ferns, white asparagus, and marcona almonds. Very satisfying, really tasty.Service was great. They were attentive, friendly, easy-to-please, but not over-bearing.

Get the fish!  All the Vietnamese who come here seem to gravitate toward the whole fried fish with a big platter of greens, basil, and other assorted fragrant leaves.  They serve it with rice paper wraps so you can make your own rolls.  It is a big whole fish, so only do this if you're a party of four--though I think you can order a half fish, which is fine for two hungry people.  Watch out for bones!  Also, it takes about 45 minutes, so if you order this dish you should make a reservation and go ahead and tell them you're getting the fish.Honky tip: pretend it is a Vietnamese burrito...you once had to learn about burritos, right?  Rice wraps are admittedly a bit more delicate.  Com uses a really hearty brand of rice paper, so it doesn't fall apart as easily as others.  However, it is easy to let the paper stick to itself and it becomes a sticky mess...try not dipping it in the hot water quite as long as you might be tempted to (it isn't pasta, and doesn't require much time.  Remember that you are reconstituting it, not cooking it.)Also this is a whole fish, meaning whole fish: bones, head and tail.  This is how the rest of the world eats fish.  It is good to feel personally connected with your food; look your dinner right in the eye.Speaking of Mexican food, my wife ordered some kind of a beef tenderloin dish that came on a sizzling iron skillet with onions and red peppers...just like fajitas.  It was tender and yummy, but a bit of a disappointment since we were expecting something different.  It was a bizarre experience to be in a Buford Hwy Vietnamese restaurant and have a dish that we could have ordered in an insipid Chilli's or Applebee's.  We just didn't know any better...it wasn't C'om's fault at all.Other recs: b'un and grape leaf-wrapped appies.

I normally don't even like tofu, but the tofu here had the perfect crust, texture, and the ponzu sauce was a perfect tartness to compliment the tofu.  This was also the case for the sashimi.  Great presentation.We also ordered a dill salmon california roll, which I was less than impressed by.  It came with a mustard-y type sauce which I found didn't enhance the flavor, in fact just tasted out of place, and the roll itself was quite bland.

There were a few people sitting at tables but the place looked pretty sparse.  It took us a minute to be seated but it took a LONG time for someone to come over and greet us at our table.  So much so that I stopped one of the waiters and asked him if he knew who our server was.  He pointed at a woman who cam over and said that she would be right with us.  During this time, another couple entered the restaurant and sat in our section.  To my surprise and frustration, I saw someone come over to their table and take their drink order BEFORE us.  At this point, I was about to walk out of the restaurant and was looking for someone to give a piece of my mind.  One of the waiters noticed we were not happy and walked over to our table.  He immediately apologized for the wait and confusion and took our drink and food order.  He also offered an order of beignets on the house.I ordered the oyster po' boy with a side of gumbo.  My friend ordered a roast beef po' boy.  My food was great, particularly the gumbo.  Thick and rich base with lots of meat.  My friend said his food was okay.  I had to ask him why he would order a roast beef sandwich from a Creole restaurant though.  I mean you can get a roast beef sandwich from Subways.The beignets were GREAT!

Truly excellent food!We were debating where to go for dinner and I'd been hearing amazing things about this place for a long time! We came in early and were the first table there, but it soon filled up. I was very impressed that it was so busy on a Monday night! We ordered veggie momo and a half litre of wine to start. The server was quiet and I have to say, not super helpful. We asked him what his entree recommendations were and he just said \\"everything is good.\\" Not super helpful.Our wine arrived promptly, but we were left alone after that until our momo arrived (which was a few minutes). When they arrived we asked to order and again asked him which he would choose between two curries. After repeating his original answer he grudgingly suggested the mustard green and potato curry as it's more authentic. The service was slow after that - the restaurant filled up and he had quite a few more tables to take care of, but I couldn't help feeling a bit neglected (perhaps because of our questions?), hence knocking one star off.But onto the amazing parts - the FOOD! These momo might be the most sumptuous deliciousness to pass my lips this year! Wrapped in something like a thin dim sum wrapper and filled with exquisite curried veggies, we happily gorged ourselves. There are 4 sauces that go with the momo and each was wonderful! The goat curry platter was HUGE, including a full sized goat curry and a full sized daal. The goat was tender and flavourful, and very well spiced. The daal needed a touch of salt, in my opinion, and the rice was just a tad overcooked.  The mustard greens curry was super unique, and apparently very authentic. It had a lot of mustardy spice, and a slight smoothing from the potato. I would have liked a bit more potato as we only had a couple of chunks. I found mixing the raaio and the daal was great as the daal smoothed some of the harshness of the mustard (in the way I think more potatoes would also have done.)Everything was super tasty, but the momo were really the stars of the show here! I could have eaten 100 of them... Go for the momo, stay for the goat, and have some time to spare to linger and enjoy watching the giant line up next door while you quietly sup your tasty victuals!"},{"name":"Halal Bros","address":"2712 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"So glad they opened up a brick and mortar location!

Our server greeted us and offered up the specials. I ordered the pot roast and absolutely loved it! My partner ordered the key west reuben and cleaned her plate.

The trivia guy is awesome, so when a couple friends who I used to do trivia with came back to\\nvisit after going out of town, we decided to return. We were a large party and the waiter, Timothy, I think, was pretty attentive, almost too attentive. My boyfriend came a bit later and we ordered food. I'm a pescaterian, which means in a vegetarian, but I eat fish. I ordered the Cobb salad, minus the chicken and bacon and added tuna. When my salad arrived, there was tuna and chicken. I asked to have it remade since, again, I don't eat chicken. The waiter seemed surprised that I wanted it remade, as if I was going to pick off the chicken and eat it anyway, when I made it clear I don't eat chicken and I'm paying for food at a restaurant. That really turned me off. A man, who I think was the manager, brought over my salad and offered a half-hearted apology. At this point, I was starving and my boyfriend had finished his meal. When the bill came, they not only charged me for the salad, but added a $5 charge for the tuna, despite their error and despite the fact that I had substituted this. I asked the waiter to remove the extra charge and he said he would ask his manager, but we \\"already ate the cost of the first salad.\\" I have never, ever paid for a meal where the restaurant made a mistake, let alone been given a hard time when I pointed this out. I was serious angry at this point. The waiter came back and indicated he took off one of the ciders, which he made sure to point out was \\"more than the charge.\\" The tuna was $5 and the cider was $5.50, how generous sir! I tolerated the mediocre food, waitstaff, drinks, and beer menu because of the trivia and the prime location.

As an FYI, Pho restaurants always have a standard beef noodle dish which comes with an assortment of beef parts that are absolutely delicious.  The bowls are also typically huge (when they say extra large, think of a watermelon).  So, that's what we got, as this is the key dish to judge a Pho restaurant by.  Here's the breakdown:-Beansprouts, mint leaves, lime - hard to go wrong here.  However, they gave us a small plate for three bowls, so more should have been expected.  (Normal is two bowls to one of these plates)\\n-Soup.  Bland.  Not as flavorful as some other places, and was missing a lot in general.\\n-Noodles.  A-ok, as yelp would say.  Not bad, but could have done better if the soup tasted more (as the noodles would have absorbed that flavor too)\\n-Beef.  What they had, were pretty good.  Tender and fresh.  However, one key thing they didn't have were the beef tendons, an absolutely staple IMO that they apparently do not include in their main Pho dish.  Disappointing. In summary - not bad in general.  I wouldn't come here if I had a Pho craving as there are other places I'd go to, but if I absolutely wanted Pho and I happened to be in Chinatown, we'd come here again.P.S. - Service here is also a bit iffy, so expect minimal smiles but quick service (so quick in fact that you'd think they're rushing you out.. which is probably exactly what they're doing)"},{"name":"Domino's Pizza","address":"3003 Edgewater Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"Excellent service, excellent pizza, I am very happy with Domino's.

These were fresh water prawns and usually, if they are mushy, that's a sign that they were either frozen or not very fresh.  The entree came with a shrimp bisque reduction for dipping, which was a bit overwelmingly rich and it didn't go particularly well with the mushiness of the prawns.

No flavor - it just tasted like a boiled pepper.So, on the bright side, they have GREAT SERVICE.  Our waiter noticed our dislike of the crab and guac, took it off our bill and gave us a coupon for a free appetizer - though we're not going again so it doesn't really matter.  On a last note, the MARGARITAS ARE YUMMY.  very limey and strong.  so... maybe after a few of those the food would taste ok?  just a thought..."},{"name":"Yakitori Jinbei","address":"2421 Cobb Pkwy SE","city":"Smyrna","stars":"4","text":"I think the ramen has msg in it that I feel very thirsty after having it.

I've been coming to the OG brick-and-mortar location since the year it opened. Revolution Doughnuts is my favorite doughnut place. When I lived out of state I would make sure to pick up a dozen to bring back with me. That's how good they are, you will have dreams about these doughnuts.Parking & the space:\\nThe only negative thing can be parking/ getting out. N College Ave gets busy and it's not easy to back out of the parking. There is parking across the street on grass/gravel when it gets packed on Saturday & Sunday.The space is cute and has some fun art, dark tones but the doughnuts are obviously the highlight.They do sell shirts and local crafts etc.The doughnuts:\\nOrganic ingredients as much local as possible, Revolution Doughnuts started out at farmers markets before becoming the two locations we know today.My standard favorites are raspberry sprinkle and toasted almond. My favorite specials are the pumpkin, white chocolate peppermint, and orange pistachio.Their yeast doughnuts are super fluffy- if you come in late in the afternoon or save them for later in the day they can get stale. Love love love their cake doughnuts because they're dense but not overwhelming.The toppings are sweet but never hurt your mouth like some local shops....If you're looking for a fun treat for a party or event try snagging a Big 'Ol Doughnut. It's a doughnut cake that you can customize with your favorite flavors! I combine raspberry sprinkle and toasted almond. I get one of these every year for my birthday and its a crowd pleaser.Coffee:\\nSometimes the beans they use for espresso do taste too bitter/ burntWhen I think of a real PSL I think of Revolution's- they make all of their syrups and coffee add-ins.During the winter they have a peppermint mocha that will warm anyone up!Tips:\\nSaturday's & Sunday's have LONG lines and they will sell out. So go early. Some afternoons during the week they have half off a dozen so be sure to follow them on twitter and Instagram!"},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"1650 28th St, Unit 1224","city":"Boulder","stars":"3.5","text":"I am always impressed with the chipotle operation.

Expect to wait awhile as the line shoots out the door and there's not a lot of seating space but it does open up. My friends and I were hoping to try the fries with the sausage gravy but after we'd ordered and waited for 15 minutes did they tell us they ran out of fries. One major downside is that you have to listen for your name to be called, which is definitely a challenge because of the noise level inside the restaurant itself.

So, 3 it is. The first time I went there we spend $300+ on our meals total. I picked over half the meal because I didn't choose any of it. TIP: If you are picky skip the pre set courses. Review the menu and get whatever the hell you want. So, that first time things were ok (only ok)  until we got the bill. We were charged $5 for water per person. No, we did not order bottled water, this was just that water that the waiter pours when you sit down. Our waiter swore up and down that it was bottled water. Really? Hmm, ok, since when do you open a 'bottle' of water then pour it into a pitcher, then serve it to customers? I vowed never to return even though I really dig certain med dishes. Fast forward 2  years (yes, I was diligent in my avoidance). My husband's cousin started working there as a waiter and he convinced us to return. I asked him about the water and he confirmed that they used to charge for water from the tap but that it was exposed in the local news (anybody see this?) so they stopped. We went back. This time I picked what I wanted and really enjoyed the food. I went again a third time with a coworker on what I guess was couples night because everyone thought we were an item. She thought it was hilarious so we maded sure to ham it up for everyone watching. I even got up and danced when the belly dancers came around. Some things to know before you go, which I do now recommend: You will have to take off your shoes so freshen up before hand. Your shoes and the bathroom are opposite directions. there are slippers provided if you have to go but, seriously, do I have to explain that part? Parking is in the back/under the building. Bring singles, you get to make it rain on the belly dancers. You are expected to throw the money on the floor. Its not a strip club so  you shouldn't try to hook it into anything she is wearing. (Although a few of them don't really mind) The dancers will usually leave the money where it falls. Someone eventually  comes to get it. I guess thats the custom. Any body wanna clarify? I met the owner. (Yeah, I tend to do that a lot) Seemed nice. I will return now that the water issue has been resolved. Oh, by the way, get the lamb and couscous.

The waiter said it's 7 oz, which seems like the meat from 2.5 lobsters (not sure how many lobsters it actually is). The fries were super salty and I loved them. I am from Cleveland and have lobster on a special occasion, it's my favorite. On my first Boston trip I had a ton of bad, pathetic lobster rolls...most priced between 12 and 15.00. That is expensive to me...so paying 27.00 for one was a total indulgence and it was worth. ever. penny. No piddly serving here. I was full before I could finish it, but I made room for this divine treat.  I would recommend this place and the wait to anyone in search of the best lobster roll. The atmosphere is casual, you don't have to get dressy, I had on shorts and a sweater. I noticed some couples around us splitting the lobster roll, but no way, I could not share this! The beer is also expensive at 7.00+ each. Had a couple oysters from the raw bar, and they were ok, not much of an oyster person and wasn't too sure of what I was ordering.

Placed over a bowl of linguini. I guess I don't realize that I I wasn't a fan of linguini until I tastedit. Linguini seemed a bit dry and not enough sauce to compensate for it.

I've never tasted the alcohol in my banana bread pudding as strongly as the one that Tibby's served and I loved it! It might even rival Ohana's banana bread pudding.My friend ordered the beignets which were good but not as good as my bread pudding.

Giving you a tally of which plate colors you have chowed down on. Typical to every other sushi belt. The service is always fast and friendly, no lurking around because it's essentially a place you serve yourself unless you make a special order, which I cannot speak to. Sushi trains specialize in cheap rolls, less than stellar cuts of fish and love spicy mayo because it covers the cheaper ingredients. It's fast-food sushi, remember that when you venture into one of these places.

By far, my favorite was the toasted almond. It was delicious. Now, the most anticipated doughnut for me was the crodough. I must say, it was just okay. It wasn't as soft and flaky as I hoped. The croissant part of the doughnut wasn't as prominent. It was more chewy. Overall, their doughnuts are great, and I think I had too high of expectations for the crodough.

There are also steamed craw fish if you are into those.  The food doesn't taste bad, but the place seems very dirty.  There were people using the same tong for everything.

I didn't expect it to taste good, given the rather shocking appearance.  Definitely the best part of our meal.  After that I had the duck and my wife had the chicken fried trout.  My duck was tender, but that is the best part.  The flavor was overpowering.  It masked the flavor of the meat.  The  garnishes  did not compliment the duck as I expected.The trout was simple.  Not great, but not bad. just meh.  The butter lettuce did essentially nothing to compliment it.  I would have given it 3 stars, but there seemed to be a problem with the wait person.  She had too many tables to attend to and consequently was unable to provide proper attention to any of them -- constantly rushing around.

With it comes 2 sides as well. I got the rice and potato salad (don't judge me for doubling the carbs). This was my 2nd time going here and I feel like this time is better than the first one.

I decided to cap off a week of good eating with lunch at Neptune Oyster. While tiny, Neptune is a cute space; subway tiles, a large mirrored menu, small tables, and a long wood bar. It reminds me of a Pottery Barn spread; you know the one where you wish you had enough money to replicate it, even the details and accents they're not hawking. It's not ideal for a groups of more than 4, I think there are only 6-8 tables in all. Also, I'm not sure I'd call this a great date place or at least a romantic one, at lunchtime it got quite loud. I don't mind dining solo, but this time I regretted it...a little. On the one hand, this place isn't much bigger than a postage stamp and flying solo I was lucky to immediately score a seat at the bar. On the other hand, there were so many menu items I wanted to try but only so much room in my stomach. After perusing the menu and drooling over the plates of those sitting next to me, I decided on the cold lobster roll. I had only tried a lobster roll once before, it was served at my conference and had an 80/20 bread-to-lobster ratio - meh. Neptune's lobster roll puts that one to shame. The roll was light and airy, and seemingly dusted with melted butter. The lobster was teeming from the bun; huge hunks of fresh, delicious lobster; writing about it is making me salivate. Hand cut fries accompanied the roll, those were excellent too; perfectly salty and greasy, a nice accompaniment to the roll. I washed it all down with a Whale's Tale Pale Ale, my only misstep; it was recommended by my server, but I wasn't really a fan. Service started out a little slow, sandwiched in between two parties at the bar it took a while to get noticed. Once I was, everyone was so attentive and friendly.

You know what sort of food that you're getting at BP for the most part and this place lives up to that.The main standout points of this location are the TV screens all around and the HUGE TV over the bar.  Excellent place to watch sports, and lots of space so you don't have to worry too much about not getting a table.Service was friendly, even when the place was quite busy.  When it's quieter it's even better.  I've been to bars and restaurants before where it's quiet and the service seems to get worse somehow, but this place they definitely became more attentive and were quite fun to talk to.Food is Boston Pizza level, so 3-4 stars for what it is, but the other benefits of this location push it up to four stars."},{"name":"Stanford's Clackamas","address":"8416 SE Sunnyside Rd","city":"Clackamas","stars":"3","text":"We thought, they have just opened up a new restaurant, so we're trying them out. They said, they've been here for 10 years. Problem was, there was not a sign close to the highway, so we can see them, this is btw, our route just East from our house, but we're seeing them for the 1st time?!?We went there for lunch, we were seated right away (wish it could have been a little lighter, but all of their restaurants have that cozy feel). There was a birthday party going on, for awhile there, we thought we came during Happy Hour!  Our waiter was very helpful to us.  He gave us plenty of time to decide, so many good food to choice from, and it's awfully hot, but I also don't want light, we brought our cooler with us, we're ready to bring home whatever leftover we may have - for our dinner!  I ordered the Knife & Fork Crab & Artichoke Sandwich & Widmer Beer Battered Onion Rings. Wow!  Only 2 onion rings? Not enough for sharing, but after eating the 1st slice, you are full. Only the crumbs & Thousand Island dip was left, and the other half of my sandwich & onion ring are both a perfect size for my dinner!  Hubby's choice was the Cajon Linguini, and he ate all of his.  I asked for a small piece of aluminum foil to wrap my leftover, and he gave me enough to cut in half for each of my food.  A lemonade refill, I didn't know was FREE, I wanted, and he even put it to go.  It came in handy, later on, it was close to 97 degrees!Not only was our waiter very helpful, he was also a great salesman!  I didn't know, they offer $20 on your birthday, just by registering Eat Drink Earn Club, by Restaurants Unlimited... The card is good for all the restaurants, which we've dined many times in the past, and will continue to dine in the future, but HE WAS THE ONLY one who ever mentioned this to us.  OK, it's possible, this rewards points, just begun!  What a deal!

Many of my friends order the grilled pork or shrimp as well.I have tried several other appetizers and entrees at Com Grill, which were good.  However, in my opinion, their vermicelli noodle dishes are the rock stars at this restaurant.  Although located in a small strip mall/plaza, parking has never been an issue.

I ordered the chicken rice plate and it was sooo creamy and delish I wish I lived around a Halal Bros back home. An extra plus is that the meat is well-seasoned, juicy, and not dry. On the side is rice and salad (which added some \\"health\\" to the meal). For the people who are sensitive to any spice, the dishes are already naturally non-spicy. A separate sauce cup is given for those people who want that spice.

I was sad bc I'm a big pasta eater However, the second time changed everything - the POMODORO!! I got a meatball but won't do that again bc it wasn't that great and also made me feel stuffed. But the pomodoro is heavenly - the sauce, the ricotta, the basil! I had half for lunch the next day and it tasted just as good. I legitimately thought about it a lot after. I've also gotten a lemon special and then the pomodoro again. I should branch out, but it's hard to resist. I also share a garlic bread every time I go and can't recommend it enough.

They were very tender, and the spice rub was great.Skip the pork butt; it was like a pulled pork but more dry. Of all the sides we had, the creamed spinach and the corn bread were my favorite.

There are few kinds of buffet now-a-days, this is one you get up and get your food.  They have Sushi on one side and cold and hot food on the other side like Minado in Framingham.  This is closer for me, closer to Boston.   They are about the same in food choices.  \\nWe were seated and server approaches asking us for drinks.  Server was keeping up cleaning up the empty plates.  I like to not crowd my food on a plate, so she did a good job picking up my empty plates.  \\nThey have oysters (fresh, but getting dry as they pour out all the good juices), shrimp, snow grab was on hot tables, Sashimi (tuna, salmon, yellowtail, mackeral, and red snapper), other tapas dish on the cold table, and wide variety of Maki Rolls (some rolls may not have your high-end items stuff inside).  Reminder this is all you can eat.  But not as bad as some of the cheaper all you can eat places.  Hot table had Rock crab, lobster, snow crab legs, Roast duck, etc.  You can make your own noodle soups on the weekends.  4 variety of soups.

We came here for brunch around 11 on a Tuesday and luckily we got seated right away. The place is really cute with an urban rustic vibe. We got seated at a communal table which was surprisingly spacious. I ordered the iced coffee and it was a bit too acidic for my taste. As a vegetarian, there weren't that many options, which was disappointing. Aside from a couple of egg dishes, all the vegetarian options were sugary (French toast, waffles, pancakes, etc). Brunch, in my opinion, is probably the easiest meal to cater to vegetarians. I ordered the fried egg and biscuit sandwich and it normally comes with the option of adding on fried chicken, bacon or sausage. I asked if there are any substitutes for vegetarians and the waitress just said they would omit the meat. I would've been really pleased if they had the option of adding avocado or other vegetables but that wasn't the case. The biscuits were delicious and definitely made the sandwich amazing. Aside from the biscuits, it was just fried egg and cheddar cheese and didn't have any noticeable dressings or sauces. My boyfriend got the cast iron frittata and it was nothing extraordinary - something you definitely could've made at home. Overall, I was disappointed in the meal and the service was mediocre. The waitress didn't really seem to be too interested in being there or giving us any recommendations.

We started with a lemonade cocktail, which we deemed a sneaky drink since it tasted just like lemonade but packed quite the punch after we got to the bottom of the Mason Jar!  Not wanting to fill up too much before dinner, we ordered the lobster roll and the watermelon appetizers.  The lobster roll was a hit, and the watermelon was surprisingly good.  I had never imagined those flavors blending so well together, but it was quite refreshing. After reading the reviews and getting a recommendation from our super nice Southern waiter, I went with the fried chicken dinner, while my date went for the duck.  This was probably the best fried chicken I have ever had. I wish I could find out how they got it so moist for being a boneless chicken breast.  The sides were great too - mashed potatoes, gravy, and string beans. The service was efficient and quick without making us feel rushed.

The smiles, helpful attitude, and tasty food kept me coming back.And then....for a good while, I was honestly afraid to come. The staff was surly, unwelcoming, practically scowled at you when you came through the door (even during low traffic times). I was never asked what I would like to order or how I could be helped, I had to ask for it. I went today out of hunger and convenience.When I walked through the door, I was actually greeted (with a smile!) and asked what I would like to order. The man at the register (Reuben, I think his name was?) was very friendly and efficient with taking my order (even with the customizations). I asked to sit outside, and he brought my food, condiments, and napkins to my table. Just a heads up: It always takes 15-20 mins to make burgers and fries, because it's made fresh. After my meal, I saw that staff who had not yet started their shift still were friendly, calm, and helpful towards me. I complimented them on their service today. It's really refreshing to see this location return to their original friendly and quality service (which is what kept me coming back to this location vs. Cedar Park, even!).

The biscuits were  good yet too small and flat to hold up to the sauces and toppings heaped onto them.  It's also worth mentioning that the health inspector must be pretty lax here.

If you're a fan of thin crust pizza or a nice crispy crust, I recommend this place!You should be warned that there isn't a place to sit and enjoy your food. It's a take and go place.They have a limited selection of pizzas. Two things that were of some concern. One being that the staff members did't know what pizzas were which.

Home cooked breakfast for an affordable price... not many diners nowadays. Every time I've been to Olympia Diner I have always received excellent service and food. It does get pretty packed Saturday and Sunday mornings, sometimes there is a line. (Well worth the wait, trust me!) The atmosphere is nice and all the servers are very friendly and attentive. You can seat yourself wherever you'd like which is nice as well as. They serve breakfast/lunch/dinner so this is a great place for whichever meal you are craving. The portions perfect, sometimes almost too big for me, but for an extremely affordable price. My usual is one of their eggs special; 2 sunny side up eggs with home fries, bacon and toast. Simple and tasty for $3.95! (Without bacon would be $2.65...WOW!) No matter what I order, I always leave here full while paying less than $10 for my meal! The only \\"con\\" I can think of is that it is cash only, so stop by a nearby ATM beforehand. (There is an ATM inside although there's a fee.)

Usually, that comes with either a dress code, a large price tag, a reservation or all of the above. Not at Portland City Grill. Located downtown in the US Bank building on the 30th floor, PCG offers a large setting with spectacular views and an affordable happy hour. First, the view is everything that makes this city so amazing. The beautiful river and bridges, sprawling green trees as far as the eye can see, and then gorgeous Mt Hood in the distance, with snow caps atop, even in the summer.Second, the space. I couldn't believe how large the bar and restaurant are. There are a lot of window side booths and tables, and the interior seating is raised so the views are equally as good. And then you have live piano to jazz up the place while enjoying a drink at the end of a work day. I didn't dine in the dining room but took a look and that was also a beautiful space, so I hope to have dinner there on a future trip.Finally, a large, very affordable cocktail and food happy hour menu. The happy hour runs from 4-7pm, and is two full pages of food, martinis, margaritas, mojitos, specialty cocktails, and of course some wine and beer.A lovely experience all the way around!

My youngest overturned both her orange juice and water glass in rapid succession and our waiter coolly mopped it up and soothed her embarrassment.   When my oldest asked for something that is pretty much not on the menu, our server (and accommodating kitchen staff) made it happen.  Thanks you guys.  And on my last visit  I was so hungover and nauseous I could barely stomach reading the menu.  our server intuited my (deserved) discomfort and, without asking, brought me soda and bitters.  It was exactly what I needed.  I know a glass of soda water is no big deal, but that kind of shit makes me feel like i'm in Highway to Heaven or something.  Oh, right:  the food.  It's great.  Chila-motherfuckin-quiles for the win!  There's a good selection of fruit cups and granola to rib-sticking corned beef hash and poached eggs.  They also have fancy espresso drinks with baby biscotti which always makes me happy.Just expect a mad wait if you come by after 9:30-10am.  That front lobby can be suffocating.

It's fresh, flavorful, and delicious. It's slightly more expensive than what you'd get in Chinatown, but the extra dollar is more than worth it.I do have to admit that their boba teas aren't as good as those you'll get in Chinatown, and more pricey, but I don't mind. I usually go for the thai iced tea with pearls. The ladies here really care about their business and customers, and are always friendly and accomodating. My one pet peeve is that it's cash only.

There were clearly people spread out amongst the pod waiting for food, but there was no huge group or any obvious reason for this wait.  In fact, there couldn't have been more than 8 or so tickets up in the kitchen.  Clearly the chefs here are slow and they haven't optimized the way their cart runs.  If we weren't there with friends and happy to just sit and talk, I would never wait that long for this food.

The salad had an odd aftertaste...almost as if the cheese was a bit old, even though it looked fresh. The sandwich was nothing to write home about. I also had ordered a \\"Mai Tai\\" and was informed that it would be an old fashioned Mai Tai (was told it would be the CORRECT WAY) according to how the bartender preferred, which I felt was rather rude.

Then placed order for salad that we received 15 minutes later, and placed order for entrees which took about 45 minutes to prepare. I expected this coming in from other reviews, so I was sure to bring good conversation and I never felt rushed nor did I feel bored or waiting on my food.

She was patient and super nice. - - Next day, bombarded them with 15 people on top of other customers rolling in.  Not ONE stink face or annoyance was shown by the workers!

Time after time, I had put this venture off. Curiosity killed the cat finally.Very casual atmosphere with a stack of home use square paper dinner napkins on each table. To make a note  - they are not necessarily clean. I picked up one and a bunch got clung together by some kind of sauce splatter.  Not exactly the most comfortable offerings even when it's one person sitting at a four top - a bit cramped/tight to be exact. I can only imagine if I had 3 friends with me!I was greeted with a petite square piece of bread and a patty of butter - I think cornbread, I couldn't quite figure it out. The server then asked me what I would like to drink. She kinda looked at me weird when I asked if she has Coke. Anyways, I got my cola in a large mason jar. Large enough that I didn't have to ask for a refill!The server was quite helpful when I asked her about the menu. Guided me thru some choices when I told her I wanted to try a little bit of everything. She did note that the portion of these dishes are ginormous. Fudge! This is when I actually wanted to bring a pig with me so I don't waste food.I ended up ordering a small St. Louis Rib which came with beans and coleslaw. It came with 5 ribs and 2 sauces on the side. Down to the point, I have no idea why there is so much rave about Redbones. Maybe I'm just anal, I actually like my ribs tender, juicy and fall off the bone. It didn't hit any of that. If I didn't drench the meat in the sauce, it was wicked dry. Nothing savory about these ribs. As for the sides, beans. I'm from Boston so when she said beans, I automatically thought, Boston Baked Beans. To my dismay, it was no where close. Honestly, I couldn't figure out what they were trying to do with the beans. It just tasted like blanched beans. For the coleslaw, it was too sour for my taste. Is there a sour version of coleslaw? I don't eat it often, but I never had sour slaw before.

We ordered the plantain chips and guac to start which were fab, guac was super tasty, the chips just could have been seasoned lightly with salt. Then came along the prawns and octopus on top of a bed of kale salad. The seafood was superb and fresh. Could have had a touch more salad on the plate but regardless the dish was delish. Lastly we ordered the Jackfruit Cubano (my bf is vego) and let me tell you, I am a meat eater and the Jackfruit could have easily been meat. Had no one told me I'd think it was. Yummy sandwich with a beautiful layer of melted cheese and pickle. This came with a fresh side salad as well which was yummy. Everything was healthy and felt light which I loved. We treated ourselves to the dolce de leche tart and this fell a little flat for me as the tart wasn't soft enough for my liking and the chocolate overpowered any taste of dolce de leche. We ended with two cocktails, Hemingway Daquiri and Smoke and Tobacco. The first was delish and the second was strong! Definitely will be back to this place, highly recommend checking it out.

The service was A+ Everyone was really polite and happy to have new customers. The waitress we had went out of her way to mention how big the cuts were, that is was \\"truly super size\\". I am thinking, \\"I go to Saburo like every month... I know super size\\". But it is cool that they are excited about the new establishment. We ordered the maguro sashimi, hamachi sashimi, a yummy sushi roll that had maguro, 2 miso soups, sea weed salad,  and large house warm Saki.  At $40 for the two of us, it was a tad less value than Saburo, but damn close.  The rolls were not as good as Saburo, nor as large. The CUTS of Sashimi, on par with Saburo.... maybe bigger.  This made so very happy. The tea they served was a disappointment, I would like Green Tea... what they served tasted like Lipton. The house Saki is not as flavorful as Saburo, but not bad. The sashimi might be even better than Lord Oh Mighty \\"Saburo\\"... However. Turn the fridge DOWN.  PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I swear, my teeth were FREEZING... this had a negative effect on enjoying your wonderful, reasonably priced, plentiful sushi portions. If it is this frozen it makes me question the freshness of the fish."},{"name":"Murphy's","address":"997 Virginia Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I love Murphy's.

It has never failed to impress, with both excellent service and some of the tastiest food you can get in Atlanta. I enjoyed the southwest frittata with a peach bellini, while my friend had the Eggs San Francisco and the berry bellini. From the complimentary muffin & biscuits to the perfectly cooked poached eggs, the meal was an absolutely success.  On a previous visit, we had the chilaquiles and shrimp & grits, which were equally wonderful. There aren't many restaurants that would merit waking up early on the weekend, but Murphy's definitely is one! I've also been here for dinner and enjoyed it just as much. There is always a wait, but it's not ridiculous, at least for a party of two (I think we waited about 15 minutes).

It was the right amount of spiciness and I am simply a fan of fish sauce.  The nice thing was they gave me a few more sides of the fish sauce upon request, so I definitely took advantage of the added fish sauce.  I also liked the pork - I thought it had great flavor to it.The papaya salad was also pretty good - it had the right amount of crunch to it, and it wasn't overpoweringly fish-sauce-dominated, either.The downside was that parking was difficult to find, and the menu options were very limited when we went.

Had I only visited once and ordered pizza, I think my review would be 2 stars at the most.  But here goes...First trip: I ordered the Fish N' Chips for lunch, which were surprisingly some of the best fish n' chips I've ever had (and I've had my share).  The cod was perfectly crispy and juicy, and the fries were great.  I would absolutely order these again! Who knew a pizza place could have great Fish N' Chips.  $13 for the dish, I'd buy it again.Second trip: I couldn't go to a pizza restaurant twice and not try their pizza right? Well, I should have stuck with the fish.  I got the combination pizza, which consists of pepperoni, italian sausage, mushrooms, and black olives.  I was not impressed.  For a place with a classic brick oven to bake their pizzas, I was expecting much, much more.  The dough was very flimsy and chewy (except for the rim), and quite frankly it was nothing to write home about...  It was extremely bland and overall gave the pizza a bad rap.  The toppings (pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, olives) were nothing special; they tasted like very cheap toppings that were not fresh by any means.  In fact, the mushrooms and olives both tasted similar to those of a can.  Lastly, the price is ridiculous on these pies.  For my combination style pizza, it was $21 for a 12 inch or $24 for an 18 inch.  $21 FOR A 12 INCH PIE?! Come on!  With the cheap ingredients that I tasted in the entirety of this pizza, I can't believe they get away with charging this price for this low quality pizza! Overall, based on two visits, I would simply go back for the Fish N' Chips, not the pizza.  I'd consider trying other items on their menu, but I don't see much value when a pizza restaurant can't even produce anything more than a very mediocre pie at a ridiculous price."},{"name":"Gaslight Lynnfield","address":"1100 Market St","city":"Lynnfield","stars":"3.5","text":"I visited the Gaslight this evening with my husband and friends.

Over all the work is wonderfully curated. I woukd say we probabaly should rethink the North and South American Aboriginal art being next to the bathrooms. Ohio of all places is the wrong state to not encourage a fuller appreciation for their work. The environment is okay in places. I appreciate the use of guilds, and personnel to encourage patrons to keep their distance from the work. You never really feel that it's intrusive in anyway. I also appreciated the approach to more modern amd visual displays. I appreciate the risk im displaying modern art, even when it's visually complex.

For $20. And they have thick, heavily spiced Bloody Jerk that shows its sex proudly, swinging a fiercely phallic Slim Jim/olive garnish. Awesome, right?Not quite; the food is bad. And not Michael Jackson Bad, which is awesome, but bad-bad, which sucks when you're hungry. The nachos were cold and congealed, and when asked to have them replaced (by a very cordial server, by the way), the subsequent spinach-artichoke dip had the distinct tinny flavor and watery texture of being nuked with canned 'chokes. Had a bite of the buffalo chicken pizza, which wasted a perfectly good crust by weighing it down with way-too-much sauce, a minimal serving of the bird and uncooked carrots & celery. Of the smorgasbord of the apps opted for, only the plain chicken tenders (skip the artificially tangy honey mustard) and the pretzels (the cheese dip will sit heavy) proved palatable.As a bar or a gathering place to watch the game, Clerys offers something swell for your band of Bro Namaths.

We tried different wines by the glass and all were great and paired well with the food. The food itself was unfortunately not as spectacular as we had hoped:The selection of oysters and raw seafood is really nice and the oysters and shrimp cocktail that we chose were all good but also what I'd expect of an oyster bar. The highlight of our meal was the Cioppino which was out of this world: the broth was perfect and all the mussels, clams, fish and shrimp were cooked perfectly. The lobster roll, on the other hand, was far from perfect. Lots of lobster, but it was rubbery and overcooked - impossible to cut through with a knife. The roll gets accompanied by an overly generous portion of fries that are just ok - not quite the crispy friend deliciousness that it could have been. Out of 6 lobster rolls that we ate this week, it ranked dead last and price-wise was probably the most expensive.We also ordered some off-the-menu uni toast based on some Yelp pictures we had seen but while the bread was good, it was hard to detect any uni flavor.

However, side of special veggie of the day, brussels sprouts, described as browned, were forgotten and when they did arrive, they were near raw.  Sent them back as we were almost finished anyway.  Second visit, medium rare hamburger was overcooked and waitress oddly said she would get us a replacement patty leaving the garnishes and fries with us.

We were given a 20% coupon for the hamburger debacle which was nice thing to do.  Third visit... death knoll struck when we ordered entrees in the $15 range.  CRISPY CHICKEN BREAST had horrible quality chicken, like a creation of a laboratory.  Side of spinach was too bitter.  HONEY GLAZED GRILLED PORK CHOP  had too much vinegar and accompanying mac 'n' cheese was synthetic.  Yuck.First time, staff was friendly and almost totally competent (forgot the sprouts), second time, amateurish, and third time, detached.

Avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid.  The poor service and food was just one after another.Got a table for 8, only got 7 chairs.  Had to go fetch one ourselves from another table.Taking orders, the waiter got the drink order slightly right, missed a coke for someone right away.Took another 10 minutes to take a dinner order, and the waiter managed to skip someone out of our party completely.  Just completely forgot they were there.After that, we saw the waiter once to refill drinks.  30 minutes later, food arrives.  One order is completely missing, another 5 minute wait for a steak.My food was the enchilada which had the taste of only the corn tortilla.  The red sauce was completely bland.  Beans needed any flavoring, only got a bit of salt on the table to make it palatable.  The meal came with a \\"small side salad\\" which was just the shredded lettuce that should have been on the tacos.  It was topped by a quarter tomato and a weird dressing instead of being a side to combine with your enchilada.My husband got a weird steak taco with red cabbage on it, not described in the menu, and completely flat flavor.One friend got a quesadilla with a mystery sauce on it not described in the menu.  She couldn't send it back as we never saw the waiter again.  Male friend got a burrito with a sauce that was less flavorful than catsup.  Chicken caesar salad for a male friend made him hit the bathroom before leaving the restaurant.  And the female friend who ordered a steak got what appeared to be half an Arby's roast beef sandwich serving of thin sliced deli meat, conveniently raw in the center when ordered well done.As we're trying to eat our meal, basketball game switches over to a really graphic episode of CSI with dead bodies in a piano, blood everywhere.  On all the TVs in the bar.  You can't turn your eyes to get away from it.Never once did the waiter ask how the meal was.  Never once did a manager come by the table.  When dropping off the check, the waiter tried to run off to another table, but I caught him and said, \\"Just so you know, this meal was [expletive deleted].  We didn't like it.\\"  This should have been a cue to ask a manager to come to the table.  Nothing, just took the AMEX I jammed in the check tray and left.As we waited the 10 minutes to get our check back, I watched what could only be the manager walk back and forth between the bar, the televisions, and the kitchen, approaching nobody.  When he finally walked past the table, I flagged him down and asked him if he was the manager.  I told the story.  His response, \\"Well, nobody else this evening has had a problem, and we are very busy.\\"  I thanked him and said that was pretty much what I expected for an answer and left.Completely incompetent staff, flavorless food, and uncaring managers.  Not much more you can get from that."},{"name":"Match","address":"94 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Very cool atmosphere, dim lighting and great presentation.

Great vibe, good service, friendly staff, and most importantly, awesome food. We had a pizza with CHOP salami, olives, and sweet-hot peppers and another with melted leeks, fennel pollen, and bacon. Both were excellent -- we probably liked the leek pie best overall, but the sweet-hot peppers were the real standout ingredient. The crust was crunchy-tender-chewy and had a distinctive (malty but not sweet?) flavor that I just couldn't place. We had ice cream for dessert -- miso toffee, malted milk ball, and salted caramel. All were very good, but the miso toffee was the standout (none were truly exceptional, however).So, why only four stars? At the end of the day, as excellent as everything was, I couldn't help but think that Apizza Shoals has better pizza and Salt & Straw has better ice cream. That said, we got excellent pizza and very good ice cream under the same roof and didn't have to wait in line forever to do it.

Chef Ramsay would have a field day tearing the food apart on his TV show. Bottom line: They're just trying too hard to be trendy. The meat part of my burger was cooked perfectly, but then it was slathered in unidentifiable sauces and piled high with a sticky cabbage-and-onion bird's nest. The garlic fries were waaaaaay too garlicky. My partner's BLT had slabs of bacon in it too thick to chew comfortably and both sandwiches were a dripping, sloppy mess.

After putting our names down and being told the wait would be 4.5-5 hours (on Labor Day Weekend), I was very skeptical about whether the wait would be worth it. We got seated at the bar in a little less than four hours. This apparently is THE PLACE to get a lobster roll and a bowl of clam chowder, so we of course ordered a hot lobster roll to and a bowl of chowder. In addition, we also ordered the uni toast, Neptune Johnnycake, Seared George's Bank Scallops, and the Spanish Octopus. This was a splurge meal and it was 100% worth it. I might not be a fan of lobster rolls in general, because I did not find a lobster roll I enjoyed in Boston, not even at Neptune. The lobster meat was cooked to perfection, but there was too much bread going on for me. I would also pass on the Uni Toast. It was good, with a hint of uni, but not as special as everything else I had. The clam chowder was really good. You can taste all the fresh clam juice in the soup. Basically the clam chowder tasted like how real clam chowder should taste. My favorite items were the Spanish Octopus, Scallops, and the Johnnycake. Each item was unlike anything else you could get in Boston. The Spanish Octopus was tender. The Scallops were cooked perfectly, which can be difficult to do. And the Johnnycake was the perfect balance between sweet and savory.

It's quick speedy service, aesthetic, and gluten free/added sugar free menu options is what keeps bringing us back for more. Here's how it works: first you're greeted by such a cheery and colorful atmosphere, then once you're in line there should be a small fridge towards your right hand side. In this fridge there's usually samples of their zucchini brownies or paleo cookies,you MUST TRY it; they're both delicious but the paleo cookies are my favorite, you'll want to buy some to take home. After you've had your quick little \\"amuse-bouche\\" then you get down to business, deciding how you are going to build your bowl. Bowls come in either 4 or 6, the 4 includes: 2 bases, 1 veggie, and 1 protein. The 6 includes: 2 bases, 2 veggies, and 2 proteins. Then there's choices of toppings for an additional price and different sauces. My usually order includes: a 4 bowl with: sweet potato noodles, coconut ginger rice, broccoli, and pesto chicken, topped with feta cheese and creamy white vinegar sauce. I've changed my order time and time again, but I always fall back in love with my first original order. The sweet potato noodles are cold almost glass noodle type of consistency and they are served in a sauce that has a bit of spice to it, which complements any bowl. The coconut ginger rice has a hint of sweetness, which makes it very unique, but I must say I've never noticed any ginger. The broccoli is roasted with Parmesan... need I say more? The pesto chicken, is a grilled chicken covered in a pesto sauce, which I didn't find super noteworthy... but it's still my favorite protein choice they offer. Finally, the feta cheese, I feel completes the bowl; it adds a saltiness and creaminess that really offsets the other flavors. At the end you can choose a sauce, which I feel can be pretty hit or miss. I usually get the creamy white ginger, which is good but again... nothing to write home about. The main reason why I have given Fresh Kitchen a 3/5 is the lack of nutritional information. I've searched online, and every time I have gone in I've asked for nutritional information and am always told something different as to why they don't have any available. For today's visit I was told that \\"they only have 5 stores open and they're only able to get nutritional information once they have 10 stores open\\" ... I'm sorry what? I'm not really sure how that makes any sense, since I've been to \\"mom and pop\\" places that do offer nutritional information and they certainly don't have 10 stores open. So for me that is a little sketchy, seeing that they're so proud to claim: \\"added sugar free, and gluten free\\" but have no nutritional information available. Will I keep grabbing a quick lunch at fresh kitchen? Yes, because it's certainly a healthier option that other places. But in the future I think it would be really beneficial to have some nutritional information available."},{"name":"Bondir Cambridge","address":"279A Broadway","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Real rating: 4.5 stars.Loved our meal here! Everything was delicious, and our server was very helpful. I won't rehash what everyone else has mentioned already (half portions to share, sustainable, daily menus), but will give descriptions of our experience rather than the food. For reference, however, here's what we had with a brief comment.-Pumpkin soup: delicious. Perfect for the weather. Pumpkin seeds were slightly tough, but added great depth and contrast to the soup\\n-Red beet salad: best beets I've ever had\\n-Grits with duck confit: hands down our favorite dish. Grits were silky; duck was velvety; mushrooms were perfect\\n-Black bass: skin was amazingly crunchy\\n-Duck with cornmeal cake and sweet potato puree: creative and mouth-watering\\n-Pork shoulder: felt it was slightly dry, but combined with the apple cider glaze and radish, it was awesome\\n-Tangerine dream: layer after layer of delicious surpriseArrival: warm greeting, sat by the fireplace to wait and defrost from the cold outside; waited less than 5 minutes to be seatedPlating: I actually adore the cute plates they use. Really takes me to some quaint countryside lodge run by a mom/pop.Portions: this was a little weird. For example, beet salad was tiny compared to the soup, grits with duck confit was very large compared to the fish dish, and the duck dish was also large compared to the pork shoulder. My partner and I had trouble \\"keeping pace\\" with each other and at one point, I felt rushed to finish up my larger portion. At another point, I felt like I had to slow down in order to not finish before he did. Not huge enough problem, but knocked off a star (if I could, would have been 4.5).Service: the timing of the courses was good, but the portions were a little off, as stated above. Server was friendly and knowledgeable about every dish.Ambiance/Decor: I think the small size of the restaurant adds so much character to the space. With the fireplace on the inside, wooden decor, throw pillows in the waiting area, flowery plates, and a lemon tree on the service table --- it felt like I was in someone's house. Such a perfect setting for a great meal. I felt like it went with the sustainable theme, without being too over the top.I highly recommend this restaurant, whether it be for a special occasion or a just a casual meal on which you want to splurge.

Intimate lighting. Nicely spaced out from other tables.APPETIZERBlack Tiger Shrimp Tempura - Excellent. Perfectly fried, not too heavy as many tempura dishes can be.. light.. just right, yet, very good tempura flavor along with being able to taste the shrimp. Shrimp was very fresh and tender.. not fishy, but clean taste. Sauces added to the dish, did not take away or overpower (unless you drown it in sauce). Personally I preferred the hot soy mustard.Seared Rare Ahi Tuna - Great bite-sized pieces, each with a good amount of skin/crust and sesame outer. Smoky flavor. And of course, very tender and fresh and clean tasting. And again, hot soy mustard was very good.MAINRibeye - Absolutely amazing. 20 oz, bone-in. The most juicy and tender ribeye I've ever had (more than Ruth's Chris' and without the butter). Very flavorful and perfectly meaty. Still tender after 5 hrs of being in the fridge, cold. Again, clean meat taste (does that even make sense?! not greasy/fatty/overbearing)Shellfish risotto - Big pieces of scallops, prawns, salmon, clams, etc. Truffle oil. A little on the saltier side.. loads of flavor. Prominent lemon flavor. Tasty, but I liked my meat better.DESSERTSin - Layered chocolate cake with ice cream on top (this description doesn't do it justice). Very good, especially with a glass of sherry. Though, left some over after we ran out of ice cream. However, our server offered to bring us more ice cream, but we were too stuffed.Creme Brulee - Yum. Just a good, solid creme brulee. Though, couple small areas were a little overly toasted IMHO.. but not complaining at all.\\nOverall, I really enjoyed my experience here. The vibe was good, and the service was top-notch. Our server, Edward, was very helpful in making food and drink recommendations and was enjoyable to talk to, not too talkative, not pretentious.. I felt very taken care of.Thank you Portland City Grill for making our night a memorable one."},{"name":"Happy Lamb Hot Pot","address":"4755 Kingsway, Ste 200","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3","text":"Hotpot is my all time favorite food group! Little Sheep does hot pot well! Parking is available underground. It can be difficult at times finding a spot but between underground parking and street parking, it's usually not a problem. The restaurant is large, though we have had to wait on occasions. If we know we are going on a Friday or Saturday night, we will book a reservation now. I get very hangry waiting for hot pot.. :) On a weeknight, we usually get in instantly. The service is alright. We come here at least every week to 2 weeks so we've had our fair share of inattentive servers. It takes a little longer to flag someone down and they may forget the odd item, but we haven't had any truly bad service yet. It is usually quite busy so I don't dwell on it very much. On occasion we get someone outstanding though. But hot pot is hot pot and I don't go there for the service. The food is great! For $25ish a person, it's a sweet deal! There is a nice assortment of meats, dumplings, veggies, noodles, etc. Usual hotpot stuff. I love the sauce cart too.

I was attracted to Neptune because of their oyster selections. The first time I visited I was too late to get a seat as they have a waiting list till closing. I had to quench my desire for oysters during my Boston visit so I went to Island Creek the next day for lunch. It actually did not disappoint! Well, except they were out of razor clams... I guess I will write another review for Island Creek. I told myself that I have to go to Neptune during my next visit to Boston and I should try to arrive early during the day. I came again for July 4th - but it was closed. Maybe I should've got the sign that this place and me are just not meant to be...Tried the third time and was thinking if it is really that good, then I will come back the next day for another lunch so I get to try most things on the menu. I arrived around 1pm (instead of 11am as I would like to in order to avoid the line) as I had other arrangements, and was told the wait was 2 hours long... It was steaming hot and I didn't really have anywhere else to go, so I went to the cafe next door. Now the food experience: Oysters: I select the small/medium lobsters with sweeter, non salty finish. For example, kumamoto and kusshi. They don't even have that many that would fall under my favorite bucket. Tried 6 kinds. None of them left me with a wow and a sweet finish taste in my mouth... Some of the oysters are not even that clean. Definitely can't compare to Aqua grill in NY or Swan Oyster Depot in San Fran. Not even as good as Island Creek in Boston...Other cocktails: the clams are OK. The Indonesian Shrimp were HUGE and have great texture, not chewy not powdery. I loved it!Clam Chowder: Major disappointment. I don't understand how they can be proud of their chowder... There wasn't that much clam in it and the soup was simply watery, not creamy at all. It still has pretty good taste but not your typical think clam chowder.Lobster roll: I would give a 5 star for the warm lobster roll. Best I have had in my life. It could be too buttery for some people though. The butter really soaked the lobster. Scallop: the scallops were huge and seared pretty well. Good dish but nothing mind blowing. For lunch it was pretty good. But it became my most expensive meal during Boston visit for the items mentioned above. $140 total for 2! in North end! after 2 hour wait and we were sweating throughout the meal since we didn't feel any AC at all. Needless to say, I didn't come back the next day. Will I come back here next time I am in Boston? Probably nope.

I've been a fan of Jason Isbell for 7 years now following him around from venue to venue catching as many of his shows as possible from Chattanooga TN to Nashville to Portland, OR and on 2/27 at Boston's House Of Blues. My BF and I arrived in the city at 4PM, grabbed dinner, a coffee, and got to the HOB doors promptly at 6:00PM when they were scheduled to be opened. We had GA Mezzanine standing room. I had bought these tickets when they went on pre sale literally clicking to buy them the second they went on sale and these were still the best tickets I could get. We found a nice little spot fairly close to the railing, with a good view of the stage, with just 2 females standing I front of us. We figured as people started to pack in for the show and as ppl moved and shifted to get drinks and go to the bathroom.... Etc.... We'd be able to inch forward just a bit. Nope, we happened to choose Satan's spawns from Hell to stand behind. They were already taking up double the amount of room they needed and kept inviting friends who were meeting then to slink up next to them and in front of me. I'm only 5'3!! Finally we found ourselves in a position where my BF and I were kind of splitting their group in by standing in between them. They asked if we could switch places so they could stand together and my BF and I could be up against the railing with a better view. We obliged and the nightmare began. They proceeded to elbow me, push me, shove me, and verbally harass me to try and inch me out of the tiny space I was already in. When I couldn't take it anymore I went to tell security about this terrible experience. I was upset and ready to leave. Luckily my request for help made its way to Joe Spano and he redirected us to a totally different, very spacious, area to stand to enjoy the show. We had a great view and the sound was amazing. Thanks to Joe Spano I had an amazing experience. It was literally the best live show I've seen ever.

She ignored me and then finally walked up and just stared blankly. Again when my friend arrived, she seemed flustered and unable to handle even simple multi-tasking. I would recommend that management work on having a good first impression as much as they work on having excellent food.

The coffee was a bit of a disappointment.  I hate it when restaurants prepare a good meal and then ruin it with a cheap cup of coffee.Perhaps the biggest disappointment on the night we were there was the service.  Maybe they're not set up to handle large parties.  The dinners came out one or two at a time, which meant that some of us were served for several minutes before the others at our table got their food.  It was also difficult to get our server's attention at times.  I got the impression this was more the fault of the management not staffing properly for the evening than of the servers.

It was decent, with food that ranged from good to underwhelming and service that started off okay and then got lousy.Food: I am not a bread person and don't care about bread. Bondir's house-baked breads were okay but far from spectacular. The cranberry/walnut one was the only one that stood out. The boy and I split a Spiced Pea Soup and Saffron Risotto to start, and both were very good. The half-size portion idea is fantastic and you should definitely take advantage of it. We got the salmon and pork loin entrees to share. They were just okay. Nothing memorable and the pork was on the tougher side.The desserts were much more interesting but ultimately disappointing too. We split the Crostata, Chocolate Panna Cotta and a scoop of the Jersey Milk-Vanilla Ice Cream. The ice-cream was the best, in my opinion. The panna cotta was far too rich for me and the crostata was okay but kind of forgettable.Decor/Ambience: Cozy farmhouse-style with crackling fireplace, but hardly the coziest place I've ever been to. Deuxave, Baraka, Central Kitchen and many more come to mind as being much cozier, more intimate and better-decorated.Service: Started off fine. We were seated quickly and our drink/food orders were taken promptly. Our soup and risotto arrived at a reasonable time. Then everything went downhill. A party of 4 seated next to us, who only arrived when our soup/risotto came, ended up getting their entrees BEFORE we did. How is that possible? We had to sit there and listen to them moan and groan over how good their food was when we'd placed our orders before they even arrived! We probably waited a good 20 min for our entrees. Desserts--same story. The party of 4 got all of their dessert orders before we did. Service FAIL.Maybe Bondir just needs more time to get their act together? I don't know. I do know that if I want delicious locavorian fare, I'll go to the far superior Bergamot (also in Inman), or pay a little more for Craigie's always-stellar service and food.

This does not happen often!The decor appeared to professionally decorated.  Strategically-placed flat screen TV's are on the walls and above the bar, providing a great space to watch a game. The game volume came on at tipoff and the semi-loud music subsided until halftime. Mirrors and black and white prints of local sports logos and 80's rock stars fill up the exposed brick walls.  Food and drinks are a high-focus for this bar. Dozens of micobrew handles and bottled beers are available.  A $3 special for Labatt Blue and Miller Lite was on Saturday, with regular priced microwbrews in the $6-$7 range for 16oz-20oz drafts.  The menu is relatively high end, perhaps approaching a \\"gastropub\\" feel.  Not really too hungry, I ordered a cheese and vege plate.  A Bento box shortly arrived with a huge portion of swiss, pepperjack, boursin, and smoked gouda cheese.  Vege's included tomato wedges, broccoli, red peppers, cauliflower, carrots, cucumber, and squash.   Warm pita was also included in the low $8 price.  The silverware has high quality and even polished!  Definitely a surprise for a sports bar!The bathroom also was above-average.  TV's with volume on the high ceilings, the usual Michigan decals in the urinal, and a bathroom attendant.  The real bonus was the mini field goal with oscillating football crossing the uprights in some urinals.  As the night progressed and the game came to an end, the bar continued to get more crowded.  The clientele became better-dressed as the the time elapsed, attracting mostly a 20-30ish crowd.  The guy sitting two down from me didn't seem too surprised at his $342 bar tab.

That a restaurant on the Drive - a Vancouver neighbourhood known for its strong sense of community - would turn itself over for an evening like that piqued my interest almost as much as my friends' report on the food. My friend's notoriously hard-to-please husband had nothing but high praise for his meal, a dish that is known for being basic and boring: meatloaf. \\"It's wrapped in bacon,\\" he gushed.The perfect opportunity to try out The Charlatan arose recently, when a friend of mine was visiting from out of town. I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere, for while it is very much a neighbourhood joint with prominent bars and flat screen TVs showing whatever game people are concerned with, it simultaneously manages to have the air of an intimate eating spot. The sports bar aspect is really tempered by the dark wood and modern decor, enough so that if a couple were to go there on a date it would still feel romantic and the mood wouldn't be overwhelmed by the feeling of being in a local pub. There are also plenty of booths available, which is nice for those guests looking to connect and converse.Seeing as my guest was on his first visit to Canada, it seemed fitting to order poutine to share as an appetizer. The fries were fresh and crispy, covered in hot gravy and smothered in generous amounts of cheese. I enjoyed this particular poutine because the cheese was actually melted; there's nothing worse than hot French fries and gravy surrounded by lumpy icebergs of cheese curds. Needless to say it was a decent starter and we made short shift of it. For my own entree I ordered the meatloaf (i's wrapped in bacon!) I'd been dreaming of and it really was quite good. Although the meatloaf itself was a touch dry, it hada nice taste to it and I did enjoy the presentation. The medallions of meatloaf were, of course, wrapped in bacon and served with a rich onion gravy, garlic mashed potatoes, and perfectly sauteed carrots and zucchini. Oddly enough, it was the vegetables on my plate that really stood out to me - they really were perfectly dressed and cooked. My guest  ordered the jambalaya and enjoyed it Both entrees were nicely portioned, filling, and very reasonably priced for under $15.The overall dining experience was a good one and I'd definitely go back there for a drink, appies, or a meal. The room at the back is a great place to hold private functions (there's a bar there as well). The Charlatan is a great addition to the Drive, doing a great job of filling the gap between local pub and medium-priced restaurant."},{"name":"Barcelona","address":"263 E Whittier St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Amazing food.

It isn't the best, but they are mighty delicious. The bread and ingredients all come together into one delicious ensemble. The sprouts are fresh and the veggie sandwiches are all very fresh tasting. I do have one complaint: for the amount of calories in one of these sandwiches, I find myself hungry only a few hours later. This is a sign to me that the sandwich lacks certain nutrients necessary.

The only thing there that was super tender was the sliced brisket.  None of the ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender, and some of the ribs were actually kind of hard.  I found myself dousing the ribs in BBQ sauce that they provide on the side.  The restaurant itself was really crowded; I found myself wedged between a chair, a wall, and the computer where orders were inputted.  Sometimes I wondered if people could actually see me, and I couldn't move without hitting something.  However, the waitress we had was amazing!  She was so helpful and even gave us more cornbread to take home with us!  For the price of the BBQ, it wasn't a super good deal.

It's meaty and hearty -- the kind of thing you'd serve yourself the day after making meatloaf.It was a big portion tasty for lunch and definitely gave me the sleepies.  Makes me want to get the cafeteria meatloaf plate one day when I've got a nap scheduled on my calendar.Another contender was the tuna salad.  Seared tuna sliced atop field greens with a light dressing.  Since I got invited to the ladies lunch (!!!) I got to sample that as well.  I'd get it.  \\"Strong enough for a man, but balanced enough for a woman\\"Service was good with a smile and the dessert case is enough to tempt anyone.Best part?

Blue crab nachos being one. Initially tasting a friends I pointed out the queso should be layered between the chips every dish afterward reflected a change in prep. Going back to the old and now long gone Chelsea Street Pub in Barton Creek Mall I pointed out the pile of nachos was abit out of date. Used to be a foot tall pile of chips and a couple of ladles of cheese over the top and call it good. Employees made some minor adjustments ending in stellar results.

Three of the five times have been awful, and the other two were average. This is truly an \\"AVERAGE AT BEST\\" kind of place.The last visit this evening will be my last. We waited almost 50 minutes for our food, which came out in two waves several minutes apart. Not a large party, it was me, my wife, and our three kids. I could be extremely nit-picky over a number of things that I typically overlook - my order was wrong, it took 10 minutes to get a drink, we were almost done with our food before the server checked back, etc. But waiting that long without an apology or acknowledgement is the major issue.I asked to speak to the manager to alert him that there are some real issues, and his response was shocking. He started to argue with me about the exact amount of time we waited for food (44-45 minutes vs the 50 minutes I had quoted him), only conceding when I pointed out that the only meat ordered was one piece of chicken which should take 20 minutes at the longest (the other items were a vegetarian salad and a few cheese flatbreads for the kids). I was blown away by the tone and his intensity to argue with me. It was incredibly rude, specifically given the fact that we had waited over 2x the necessary amount of time for our food. He also started an argument over the other RAM restaurant (which has closed). Very bizarre. Very rude. Very consistent with the experience at RAM in Dublin.I would warn anyone and everyone to avoid this place, which is unfortunate, since it's in a great location. I hope the Bridge Park leadership identifies this sub-standard establishment and replaces it with an awesome restaurant / venue that is worth frequenting.

Here, we got to enjoy a great dinner outdoors in a quiet, shaded surrounding.  And our server was very attentive and friendly, making it an even more enjoyable experience.  We were going to order a large pizza for three kids and asked our server if he thought it was enough.  He suggested we just get a medium as their pizzas are pretty big and thick.

I had high hopes and was a fan because of the recipe books and various interviews I'd read of Joanne Chang. And I have to say those expectations were met, for the most part. The menu is more extensive than I imagined, a good and interesting selection of sandwiches and salads offered each day, with the genius option of having most sandwiches sans bread as a salad instead. This is in addition to an array of bakery items including breakfast pastries, cakes and cookies + whole loaves of bread to take home. Flour is an all encompassing bakery/cafe concept. The space is modernly arranged, with an inviting atmosphere and plenty of seating. It gets quite crowded, but we were lucky enough to score seats for 4 when we were there. Things we tried and would recommend - sticky bun, banana bread, breakfast sandwich, craquelin, berry bread pudding, breakfast pizza, hummus sandwich (as a salad/skip the dressing) The plain croissant is not that great and I wouldn't get it from this place again - but honestly, mediocre croissants vastly outnumber decent ones, in France or otherwise.

We were told the lobster roll is amazing! My husband is from Maine and he and I love seafood so we thought we'd give it a try!  We dined on a Thursday evening thinking that by going on a weekday the wait would be shorter....reviews I'd read ranged from 15 minutes to up to 3 hrs!! We were told our wait would be 1 hr, so we decided to find a place to have a couple drinks since the restaurant did not have a waiting area that was not crowded with already waiting to be seated customers.  After about 50 min our cell phone was called to let us know our table was ready...or so we thought we'd be at a table.  Side note- they do not have pagers for waiting patrons.  They ask for your cell number and call you when they are ready to seat you.  This is the first time my husband and I experienced this and it left me slightly uneasy in this world of protecting your privacy.  Who is to say they don't sell the active cell numbers they've obtained over days, weeks or months.  Just saying...We were seated at the bar when we returned.  Seats were very tight.  Immediately menus- including a raw bar menu were placed in front of us without an initial hello from our server.  She stood in front of us still not saying anything, wearing a half smile-though waiting for us to say something to her.  A hello would have made us feel more welcome.  I started our communication by ordering a draft beer.  My husband ordered a non alcoholic beverage and the half smile she was wearing turned into a full fake smile.  She showed irritation at his order.  FYI, we were in Boston for an appt with a specialist and having scheduled bloodwork the next am my husband opted for a non alcoholic drink. She even mentioned to a nearby worker that he didn't order alcohol.  I felt that this was rude as we were sitting right in front of her in earshot.  As we glanced at the raw bar menu, I had questions but did not want to ask because our servers behavior made her feel standoffish.  I asked anyway as I was concerned about my husband consuming raw without knowing.  He is to avoid anything raw. Again, the servers personality was lacking and irritated when I mentioned for health reasons he needed to avoid raw.  She recommended 3 items.  We felt pressure to place our orders before we had a chance to throughly inspect the menu since our server stood peering at us.  We ordered shrimp cocktail off the raw bar sold by the piece, which arrived promptly.  The shrimp were large, delicious, finger sized that reminded me of the dinner party scene from the movie Beetlejuice! For entrees my husband ordered a hot lobster roll with a side of fries and I ordered the scallops.  Our food came out within reasonable time.  My scallops were perfect with great flavor. My husband did not feel the hot lobster roll held up to the hype.  He immediately wished he ordered a cold lobster roll instead of the hot- thinking the cold would have been better.  The lobster roll tasted very buttery but plain.  Yes there was a generous amt of lobster which lacked taste being overwhelmed by melted butter which made the roll it was on semi-saturated.  Scallops A+.....hot lobster roll....B-As we were finishing our meals we nibbled on the half eaten, leftover fries on my husbands plate.   As both my husband and I coincidentally reached for our napkins at the same time, our server swooped in immediately and retrieved our plate.  She did not ask if we wanted anything wrapped up or if we were finished.  I asked my husband if he was done and he said no.....but too late now! We received our bill.  Our servers name was listed on the bill, not a common name-Umigame.  I asked the server her name since she was not wearing a name tag and I was not sure how to pronounce what was on the bill.  She told me and also said that all the workers adopt an alias after they have been working there for a year.  She disclosed she had been there over a year.  I couldn't help to think that this is something that may have be put into policy so that the actual person is not named in the review.  Overall, the scallops great, the lobster roll was good.  However our experience was shadowed by bad customer service from our server- so that is why we gave a 3 star rating.I hope this review was helpful."},{"name":"Viva Mi Arepa","address":"5197 Washington St","city":"West Roxbury","stars":"4","text":"This place has really good food but its a little on the expensive side and sometimes can take a while to get.

I wish I could say that the food was good but I never got to that part of the night.\\nMy friends and I ordered drinks and took to the enclosed patio where a server let us know that we could smoke. The first thing I noticed when I entered the patio was that I had two puppies that were tied up to railing jumping on me and almost making me spill my drink. I tried to ignore it, hoping that maybe they just belonged to someone picking up a to go order or getting a quick bite. Well it was quite the opposite. The dogs were loud and barking and any time anyone walked through the patio they would get excited and jump on people and towards their food. Another customer overheard me talking about how annoying it was and told me that this was a regular occurrence, that was when i was told that they actually belonged to an EMPLOYEE. WHO on EARTH allows their employees to tie their dogs up in a SMOKING section of a restaurant where people are EATING. Those poor dogs sit out in a hot and smokey patio for how long?

Neptune Oyster opens at 1130am, and if you're interested in grabbing lunch, you should be there as close to opening time as possible, as they do not accept reservations and the wait can be up to 2 hours (especially for dinner). We popped our name on the list, were given our 45 minute wait time, and went on a mini-stroll through the North End for some coffee while we waited. After 45 minutes, we received our call and returned to be promptly seated at the cozy bar. Most important word: cozy. The space is small, with only about 15 chairs seated at the bar and a few tables pressed against the wall. The tin ceilings with the ceiling fans reminded you it was a warm breezy summer days as you peruse the surprisingly lengthy menu. We decided to split 1 hot lobster roll and 1 cold lobster roll (so we could try both, of course) while T went for the fried clams. the kitchen contains the whole kitchen...2 people....small space, providing a surprisingly lengthy and delicious menu.

First of all, they got both of our orders wrong. My friend wanted his egg runny, and it was well done. I ordered the chilaquiles and they gave me the migas instead. We alerted them to these errors, and they remade our orders, so that was good. But when i did get what i ordered, i thought it was fairly disgusting. It was green and disgusting. I assume it was some type of avocado sauce that they made it with, but whatever they were attempting with that, it failed. These were nothing like chilaquiles that i recently got on a trip to Birmingham.

My boyfriend and I, being Mexican cuisine connoisseurs, almost always get fresh guacamole with our salsa but decided to try the Juan's Ceviche instead.

It's a very small restaurant. When you enter you feel like you come visit your family. And great smell of food coming when you enter the door makes you even more hungry. We order Horiatiki salad that basically comes with 3 different type of olives, big pieces of tomatoes, salad, cucumber, feta and olive oil with different spices. It brought me to my childhood when my grandma was making that for me. And it was delicious. Worth $11 for sure. \\nLet's talk about main menu. Best steak I ever try. No joke. It was so juicy, soft love the spices on it. Pieces of steak were melting in my mouth so yammi. I didn't really care about potatoes that my dish came with. it was nothing special but the steak..... I also got lemon soup as it comes with main course. It was delicious. Not very salty just perfect. \\nWe also got lamb chop and it was as good as it could be. Soft, juicy, you could easy separate meat from bone. I really enjoy the food. If you want try Greek food come here. \\nThe only minus that I had is that bread that was by the way great came 10 minute after soup. Which was a bit disappointing as you have this beautiful soup in front of you but it missing key addition to it- bread. I couldn't resist and start eating soup without bread. But it's a minor issue that I hope they will resolve."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"We went there and tried their lobster rolls....YUM YUM YUM.

My favorite was the brisket slider, I also had the lobster slider which was delicious, tasted a bit like a crab cake and the regular slider which was excellent.  People raved about the lamb slider.  The martini's lived up the their $12 price tag.  I started with the Espresso to get some caffeine and it was great.  My wife liked the Pop rocket one which I thought tasted like candy.

My colleague wanted a glass of wine with her dinner, particularly a chardonnay, but didn't see any on the wine list.  Asking the bartender, she was told that they certainly had other selections not listed on the menu, and brought out a nice bottle from Sonoma, California for her to sample.  Liking it very much, she ordered a glass of it.  I, on the other hand, enjoyed a fine Coke or Pepsi (I cannot recall which) in an awesome Guinness pint glass (I know...sacrilegious to not have an actual Guinness in the glass, but what am I gonna do?).  We both ordered the hot lobster roll with melted butter, served on a brioche bun, opting for a salad on the side instead of fries.  The sandwich was amazing!  Lobster heaped over the top of the bun, requiring each of us to fork out some pieces and eat separately.  Delicious!  Once the level of lobster meat was manageable, we lifted our respective sandwiches and dug in.  So good!  The side salads, served with a nice vinaigrette, was tasty and a fine accompaniment.

The place is a little on the cramped side, as they squeeze a lot of tables and chairs in a fairly small space to accommodate as many diners as possible, but that is a minor issue. Once you're sitting, you are transported into Vietnamese-gustatory paradise.Steaming, big bowls of hot pho are the best thing on cold, rainy days. Everyone gets a dish of spicy, flavorful sauce to stir in, and a plate of fresh bean sprouts, cilantro, and other green herbery to flavor the already tasty broth and noodles. You choose your meats and other add-ins, such as fried spring rolls, pork, chicken, beef, tofu, fishballs, etc. There is always much more than I can eat, so the rest comes home in a plastic take-out container.You can also order other Vietnamese standards, including a tasty version of BBQ pork or chicken, and bowls of skinny rice noodles topped with various Vietnamese style veggies, and choice of animal or plant protein. They have summer rolls, a tasty concoction of chopped veggies, mint and shrimp wrapped in an unfried rice flour \\"skin.\\" There are pan-fried noodles, big flat rice noodles, and rice dishes with mix-ins.Every table is equipped with the necessary condiments (Saracha!! Must have!!) and containers of help-yourself chopsticks.They have alchohol, so you can enjoy a strong beverage with your meal, or else go for the standard tea or strong, French-inspired Vietnamese coffee (in the plunger caraffe with condensed milk... delish!).Cheap, quick to serve your meal, and you can linger over coffee if there aren't hordes of hungry people waiting for your table (in which case, you finish up and leave, if you have a conscience, which you should).Writing about Pho Pasteur is making me want to get on the Blue Line and take a ride into Town for lunch there.

Tons of neighborhood and city reading make it a place to sit and relax during shopping trips. While \\"authentic\\" is a word thrown around by Portlanders all too often about Mexican and other ethnic foods. Being Hispanic and Italian I find that the word doesn't hold water in respect to the recipes which tend to be familial and regional. A dish's recipe can change from street to street in the huge Mexico City and not to mention how the recipes change from town to town along the border. This is excellent food made well and with care. The service is friendly and it's a longstanding neighborhood landmark. The pricing is average for the neighborhood. The one reservation I have is the outdoor seating which tends to attract the smokers and loungers who like to block the walkways and litter the street, not to mention the noise on late summer nights. I know it's difficult for a business to manage such things but it can be a drain on the neighborhood and deserves some attention. So they lose a star for that one issue.

Both were very yummy! For dessert we got the tembleque (coconut pudding). Neither of us had this before and I can't say it would have occurred to us to order it, but we were ready to try something new and so glad we did. It was delicious! Now we can't wait to go back. And although my girlfriend says it will be hard not to get the pulled pork again, I can't wait to try the eggplant and chick pea pastelillos and vegetarian paella.Authentic homestyle Puerto Rican cuisine is hard to come by in Austin.

It came with a side of more hash browns and sour cream + salsa for dipping/eating with the wrap. We thought this was pretty meh. Though it sounds good on paper, it was a bit on the dry side. Not the best breakfast burrito I've had.The salmon hash was tasty if you ate a bite of every element on the plate at once. It comes with a bed of hash browns, topped with salmon, mushrooms, two eggs, and bread. Nothing super out of the ordinary, as far as breakfasts go, but a pretty solid dish.For a drink (my favorite part of the meal here) I ordered a Cold Haze: Crater Lake hazelnut espresso vodka, ice coffee, cream, chocolate syrup, whipped cream, and ice. I made sure to note down all the ingredients because I liked it so much that I want to try making it at home so I can enjoy it all the time.I also really liked the environment of where we were sitting!

They wouldn't let my friend from Belgium in because he was wearing sneakers (even though they were the latest design by Sascha London); yet these plus-size girls were strutting in with their knock-off Gucci bags like it was nobody's business.A few weeks later, I decided to try again, so I brought my date there. They gave me a hard time about wearing a no-collared shirt (even though it was a limited edition Gaultier T that cost $280). When they finally let us in, the 'roof-deck pool' wasn't a pool at all. It was a sad little puddle with water spouting out of it.In addition, the wait staff was rude and arrogant (and wore way too much makeup).

My girlfriend ordered the malted waffle and was very happy with it (it was her birthday so I'm glad she enjoyed her order). I tried some of her waffle, and it was delicious. The outside was crispy with a fluffy inside. Everything about the waffle was perfect. She also ordered a side of spinach and garlic that we didn't see on the menu, but asked for a side of veggies. We also ordered 2 drinks. A white chocolate latte and a mimosa. The latte was delicious, even though a little too sweet for me. I knew it would be sweet because it's white chocolate, and knowing that I still thought the drink was executed perfectly. The mimosa definitely tasted good as well. It had quite a bit of pulp so I assume they use fresh orange juice. I'm not a big fan of pulp but even with that being said, I definitely enjoyed the mimosa.In the end, I would definitely come back here for the muffins we started off with.

Is it possible that someone within 100 miles of Orlando actually makes pork fried rice that isn't yellow and loaded up with carrots.  Is it really true that someone within a 100 miles of Orlando makes pork fried rice where you can actually see pieces of pork?  Is it really true that someone within 100 miles actually makes roast pork fried rice that is moist and not greasy? Hallelujah, my 11 year wait is over.  I am euphoric and have been here 4 times since I discovered this place while sipping quality suds at Hourglass Brewery. In fact I walk across the street and eat it over at Hourglass.  The dumplings, all though not packed with meat and slightly blandm are solid and rank high for the area.  The beef is beef.  I repeat, the beef tastes like beef.  Their five flavors sauce is wonderful, off the charts good. They are also are one of the few that know how to make fresh quality chow fun;  it has wonderful flavor.  The vegetables are always fresh if that is your thing.  Keep in mind I am a tough customer so my 4 star rating means go get you some. So why not five stars?  1)  The wonton soup does not have any pork or greens.  Up north and in Chinatowns in NY, Boston and SF you would never see wanton soup served like this, but Central Floridians sadly only get baroness.  Dumping a wanton into plain broth is not wanton soup.  2)  The Jumbo shrimp are not Jumbo. 3) The roast pork fried rice while giving you more than anyone else in the area still has a too high of peas to pork ratio; a little more pork is warranted.I have no problem paying a little more for more pork.  4) no fried noodles and duck sauce given with takeout order.  I will have to see if they have them.  5)  no minced pork in the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce.  Without minced pork, it is simply not Shrimp With Lobster Sauce. The owners are a super nice couple and the place is clean and doesn't have that old over smoked bad oil smell you get when you walk into a bad Chinese restaurant.

The lesser of the evils is to create your own \\"burger/sandwich.\\"  And the sides? Small BLT salad, seasonal vegetable which is peas,onions etc in a BUTTER sauce.  The choices that you make when you eat out are just as important as any other meal.  We have an obesity epidemic in the U.S.  I know when you're out at a bar that people may not always want the \\"healthier option,\\" however there has to be something that you can offer that may appeal to the majority.

My group decided to try this place out for dinner. We were going to make reservations but then I saw on yelp that they don't take reservations. We ended up waiting about an hour for a table. Like many of the highly rated restaurants in Boston, this place was small but busy. Since this was close to our last meal in Boston, I decided to try the Clam Chowder, since we were in New England after all. It was pretty interesting. They had potatoes in it and it was creamy with an adequate amount of clams in it. I felt that the soup needed some more taste to it though. Instead of getting the soup, my friend ordered an enormous dish of mussels for an appetizer. I tried one and it was very good. I wish I had gotten that instead.For the main dish, I wanted to try the lobster since I heard they are plentiful and cheap in New England. However, the market price for it was like $50 so I went for the lobster roll instead. The lobster roll was covered in butter and looked tasty. I enjoyed it and it was very filling. However, I don't believe it's as good as my friend and the reviews here described it. I thought there was too much butter and it seemed to have overwhelmed the lobster taste. It also didn't look as good as some of the pictures I've seen of it. If I ever come back to Boston, I think I would try the scallops and oysters here."},{"name":"Imperial Fez","address":"2285 Peahtree Rd NE, Ste 102","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"The food is not great , not worth the price you pay for it.

I'm partial to all things Italian, but am generally underwhelmed by our Italian dining options around town. Patrizi's is the real deal, however, and totally takes care of my pasta cravings.We had the carbonara in all of its egg-y, bacon-y glory. It somehow managed to be light, yet soul-satisfying. The pasta was perfectly cooked and the portion was generous without veering into gluttony. We also split the red sauce with a gigantic meatball. The meatball was a little dry and the pasta was gummy, but the sauce saved the dish with perfectly melded flavors of tomato, garlic, onion, and red wine. In case our two pasta plates weren't enough, we threw caution to the wind and ordered the bruschetta starter too. The homemade ricotta was amazeballs. The other two toppings were unremarkable, but I didn't care because I was hyper-focused on the creamy cheese. As you can imagine, we had a hefty doggy bag of food to enjoy the following day, which reheated surprisingly well.I'm so glad that Patrizi's has established a loyal fan base in Austin.

Ive been here closer to fourteen times to date, and Ive had a mix of slow/moderate/good service to ridiculously fast service. Recent example, went there after a Badfish concert at the Newport, showed up around 11:45pm to a semi packed Friday evening and almost as fast as we could order my bacon blue cheese burger and fries along my hot date's loaded omelet, it was sitting down in front of us. Cooked wonderfully and beyond delicious. My post concert famished belly could not have been more pleased with the delivery here. To the point I come here for the atmosphere - the ceiling tiles are decorated and will keep you busy for awhile. The setup is a darker soft light glow style ambiance with a touch of diner home and familiarity that makes me feel comfortable and relaxed. I also come here for the food - the menu offers a unique variety to which I have tried 12 different items and found success with all but maybe one item (didnt care for the value of chicken and waffles, meaning I would have paid more to get more food on that one).  The drink and beer specials are good as well and change up often.

Interestingly, I don't normally like either item (but I wasn't paying, so what do I care, right?), but the chicken wings are brined and spiced-up before fried, and were incredibly good.  The calamari was also excellent, light and prepared perfectly, not like the crappy stuff you get at some kind of low-end seafood joint.  I'd go wings over calamari -- try 'em, you won't be disappointed.For the entree, the filet mignon was cooked to perfection.  Definitely a great piece of meat, with excellently-cooked vegetables on the side.  Loved it.In short, go for the wings, cocktails, and steak.

Eventually, we settled on Alpha in Yaletown.Unfortunately, the small Yaletown eatery was packed late on a Friday night. The staff were friendly and told us it would be a half hour wait. We strolled around Yaletown for a bit before returning. Out waiter took our order early so we could eat as soon as we were seated. I enjoy little friendly touches like that.The place looks normal enough, but it has a odd feeling to it. Our menu was inside an old textbook about the human body. There were graffiti painting adorning the walls.The tuna garlic pepper sashimi was a great starter. I am not the biggest tuna fan, but its garlic taste and sauce was really scrumptious. The Vancouver mango rolls (California rolls with smoked salmon and mango) were tasty and hit the spot. I gave extra points for presentation. One of my favourite dishes was the Chicken karaage. It was very filling with its large, balled up form. The meat was piping hot inside. The Mentaiko Udon was another winner of the night. The seafood and fish roe texture was smooth and creamy. The taste of it was quite scrumptious and delightful.Part of the appeal of Alpha was May's incessant recommendation of the taco rice salad. She went on and on about it, building up its anticipation. Well, she was right. The taco rice salad was delicious. I have no idea why it is served at a sushi bar, but I could not care less. The combination of rice, lettuce, and tomatoes all messed up in a bowl with some sort of barbecue like sauce made the dish tasty.The short ribs and other side dishes including the deep fried prawns were solid too. The beef sashimi was another raw dish served well and quite a treat to eat. The kalamari salad I thought was just okay. It did not stand out like the other dishes quite as well.I thought this Yaletown sushi eatery provided a great late night dining experience.

I was excited by the rave reviews I'd heard and when I'd walked by the space, it seemed like a fun spot to try.I'll start off by saying that, as mentioned, the space itself is cool.  On a weeknight, it was pretty full, and the age spread of the crowd was broad.  The staff was friendly, and we placed drink orders shortly after seating.  They have a ton of delicious sounding cocktails, but we all ordered wine instead.  To this point, I thought things were off to a fine start, but our food was a pretty big let down.We started with a few items smaller items--the salmon with green chili salsa verde from the crudo menu, one of their crostinis, and the octopus antipasti.  The salmon and crostini weren't particularly memorable.  The crudo was good but not any better than anywhere else really.  Maybe if we'd ordered another, more adventurous item off the crudo menu I would have felt differently.  The octopus was probably the best part of the entire meal, but as you'll read below, that isn't saying too much.  I ordered the sweet potato cappelletti with chestnut, sage, honey...sounds delicious, right?  It wasn't a large portion, and I couldn't finish it because the flavors amiss.  I understand that the intent was for the pasta itself to be al dente, but it was tough bit too much for me.  The sweet potato with the other flavors of the sauce just didn't seem to meld well together, and I was sadly disappointed.  I tried a few others' dishes also, but everyone at our table had a similar sentiment about the meal in general.  The favorite entree was probably the paccheri with lobster, green onion, and tomato, but again, 'favorite' doesn't really say too much given the overall experience.I wanted to love this place...I really did.

They accept, and recommend, reservations even for lunch. The space is very pleasing, with high ceilings, robin-egg colored walls and vintage bird cages lend a certain elegance, especially stepping in from SW 6th Avenue, which doesn't exactly remind one of Paris. Anyhow, the service at the bar (and I'll wager throughout) was excellent and very French: attentive without being obsequious (none of that 'hi I'm Kenneth and I'll be you server today'. Just bring me the damned bread and wine list!). Ordered the green salad with banyul vinaigrette, superbly tangy, and topped with shaved goat cheese. Simple and delicious, without a lot of extraneous ingredients ($7). Next (and immediately upon finishing the salad; Little Bird seems to understand that Portlanders, unlike their their Parisian counterparts, usually don't have two hours for lunch) came the gnocchi Parisienne with peas, roasted portobello mushrooms, and pistou. The gnocchi were silky and piping hot; the portion might look small but very filling ($16). Unusually, I declined the temptation of wine with my lunch although they did offer a 4oz pour of a white blend from Chehalem ($5) which I tasted, it was nice and dry with good acidity, but certainly appreciated the nod towards smaller, cheaper pours. A good cup of coffee rounded out a most satisfying lunch. I'll definitely be back and highly recommend this place for lunch, especially for something a little special.

I debated giving this place 3 or 4 stars, but the only reason I would give it 4 stars is for the view, which is absolutely incredible.The place opens at 4:00, and the elevators do not go up to the 30th floor until exactly 4:00. So even if you're the first person waiting in the lobby, if others manage to catch a working elevator before you, they'll get first dibs on the window seats. Thankfully my mom and I were able to nab a window seat before it got too crowded (and then others hovered around our table like vultures waiting to grab our seats as soon as we were done).My mom got the grilled steak house cheeseburger, and I got the spicy basil chicken along with a perfect pink margarita.

HmmmMy Duck was really good, but again crazy salty.  The menu also said that it was going to be served with a sauce.  My sauce consisted of about 8 berries sprinkled on top of the sliced duck.

The BF and I decided to head to Elder Tree for a post dinner drink and snack.  Walking in, you would never know you're in the old Blue Frog Cantina...this place looks great (the nicest bar in the Village)! Dark wood, metal ceiling tiles, and a big wrap around bar are all new updates to this space, and it is a completely different than any of the other places in EAV . We were quickly seated by the host when we arrived, and a friendly waitress introduced herself at our tall bar table and went over the beers on draft (they didn't have a beer list, but I'm not complaining -- they had only been open 2 days).  I ordered a snakebite and the BF got a Bass.  The menu consists of Irish choices, and I can't wait to go back and try some of the main courses.  Since we had already eaten dinner, we opted for an appetizer, The Duck Fat Chips with Curry.  These were delicious crispy fries that were still soft in the center - just how I like them!  They came out with a curry dipping sauce, which was also good, but I'm not the biggest fan of curry so I mostly stuck to plain chips with vinegar (which is on the table).There are several large TVs for sports (word on the street is this place is going to show soccer games - for all you football hooligans out there), dart boards in the back, and best of all -- the bar is NON-smoking (but they do have a heated front patio for the smokers out there).  Overall, this is a great addition to EAV, and I hope it continues to be a great place to have a drink and dinner."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I started coming here in 2006 and back then, I could get a table with a very reasonable wait.  Now, the wait times are extraordinary and I blame Food Network for this undesirable change.  This is my 7th trip to Neptune's and I've now covered most items on their menu minus the daily specials.  I think I've finally figured it out why my meals have ranged from great to mediocre.  Their cooked dishes can lack consistency, which may leave you with a serious disappointment.  If you're a tourist and this will be your only visit, I'd recommend sticking with the staples and be adventurous some place else.  This is also not the place to come for chowder - it's full of clams but so runny.  I like my chowder thick and full of ingredients so this is the only thing Legal's does better.  Lobster Roll - This is the best lobster roll we've had thus far in Boston for $25.  It's better than the $27 version at B&G.  However, for $12 James Hook makes a pretty decent lobster roll (premade in a hot dog bun but what do you want for $12?).  Alive and Kicking serves one for $14 but it's really a sandwich not a roll.  L'Espalier serves a Lobster BLT on brioche toast during lunch hours for $25 but not sure we care for the combination of bacon and lobster.  In the Neptune's version, the cold roll has enough mayo to bind the lobster without being overwhelming.  The hot roll is full of unsalted buttery goodness.  The toasted brioche is a little heavy for the delicate lobster but that's a trivial complaint.  Overall, the hot roll wins.Triton or Neptune platter - Oysters, clams, mussels, shrimp, crab, lobster, and octopus galore.  Mussels are by far my least favourite bivalve and need some type of broth without being able to hold their own without the dressings.  I also prefer Cherrystones over Little Necks.  They claim the crab is blue crab but I really don't think so.  Blue crabs tend to be much sweeter, not to mention they are small in size and these crab chunks are huge.  Overall, these platters are a great value.  There is a ton of fresh seafood here but served without much fanfare (just some light mayo here and there) and it's low on energy expenditure (all the meat has already been taken out for you).  I don't mind getting down and dirty with my seafood but I'd rather save the bib and napkins for home.I really enjoy Neptune's though the increasingly touristy atmosphere has detracted it a little for me. I stood in line behind two guys who were complaining that they don't eat seafood and think raw bars are gross (and in all seriousness were having a conversation about whether a lobster was considered a bivalve, while the other idiot answered, \\"No, shrimp are bivalves\\").  When I asked why they were here, the response was, \\"because Food Network told us to come.\\"  Please, go clutter McDonald's instead and leave Neptune's to those of us who actually know how to eat."},{"name":"Crazy Buffet","address":"7038 W Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"The restaurant was very good.

One of them threw his heavily cologne-musked leather jacket over me while we were waiting for one of my friends to finish smoking her cig...gee thanks!  We were seated right in front of the wonderfully tantric fire wall and ordered the pop rock martinis to start.  The pop rock rim is kinda crusty and gloppy forcing you to gnaw at the rim to experience the pop rock sensation...believe me, I looked really sexy trying to pull that off, and the martini is so sugary; total girl drink.  I love the burger choices and while my two girl friends succumbed to what every other starving girl in there ordered: one mini burger and a salad, I wasn't quite Nicole Richie to ignore my god-given gastronome talents...so I went with the blackened salmon with honeydew melon salsa, sauteed spinach, and risotto cakes.  I tried a micro-mini bite of my friend's burger and thought it was delicious!  Tender, juicy patty on a soft, fresh bun.  My salmon dish was beautifully presented and so tasty!  The salmon was well-cooked and must've had nice marbling because the steak was really flavorful and moist.  The blackened crust was almost too salty but forgivable because the salt carried through and flavored the layer of spinach and risotto underneath.  The strata of spinach was yummy, soaking in all the juices from the salmon layer on top.  The risotto cakes were a wonderful base, slightly crunchy and creamy little beads of rice.  Lastly, the honeydew melon salsa was so good, I was slurping through it and slathering it on everything!Our water glasses were constantly refilled and our waiter was adorable and wonderfully flirty (get those tips, man).  The service is more functional and friendly than it is \\"fine-dining\\".  They left a used knife on the table to be re-used for the next course..very Applebee's of them, right?  The GM walked around like a skeletal praying mantis in her $300 Rock and Republic jeans. The desserts are pretty good!  The creme brulee is spiked with some Bailey's and accompanied by a strawberry and a ultra-mini chocolate cake..or dot is more accurate.  Had my Amelie moment with splitting the hard sugar crust with my spoon.  The \\"pan-seared\\" cookie dough with ice cream was like toasted cookie dough and the portion is pretty modest.I had an awesome meal here with my girl friends and they absolutely loved the place (even after lornfully salivating while I munched happily through my salmon steak).

That was just our one experience, but perhaps it's typical of most Sundays.We took the elevator up to the 30th floor promptly when brunch service began; as others have mentioned, the elevator will not take you up before opening time.

I wish the jalapenos didn't taste like they came from a can, but the rest of the toppings were outstanding  along with the moist and smoky pulled pork.This is my first time ordering the BBQ belt.  I would suggest anyone trying to decide to order the BBQ belt.  It is a great sample of various cuts and types of meat including their house-made sausage.  I can say there wasn't a bad item on the plate.  All seasoned well, smoked and moist.   We both enjoyed everything on the plate and left wanting more, even though we were stuffed.I can't wait for my next visit to the Boston area so I can stop by once again!"},{"name":"Tin Lizzy's Cantina","address":"77 12th St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"went for \\"brunch\\" on a Sunday with my cousin and her roommate.

If you said yes, this place has your answer. This place is located inside the basement of a building in the side streets of Boston's Chinatown, and they serve a simple selection of Chinese barbecue meats. I walked inside, and stared at the barbecue meats, while at the same time, looked at the menu to see what selections and combinations they had. I saw a small and somewhat stout Chinese lady, and she was saying to me in Cantonese Chinese:\\"Yiu mat ye ah? Yiu mat ye ah?\\" (What do you want?) I decided to get a rice dish with three Chinese barbecue meats, since I wanted to try everything so after reading the Chinese characters on the menu, I said,\\"Saam bo, cha siu, siu youk, siu ngaap.\\" (Three treasures, barbecue pork, crispy roast pork, and roasted duck) She seemed to understand everything I said in Cantonese Chinese. Although she seemed to be a competent English speaker from talking with the non-Chinese people inside, she was definitely more comfortable speaking Cantonese Chinese and told me to sit down.  I was given a glass of tea, and some warm chicken soup as I waited. The soup was simple, but good. Within a few minutes, I was given a plate filled with rice, the Chinese barbecue meats I ordered, mixed with a somewhat oily sauce made from freshly cut scallions. The pork meats were tasty, I really liked the crispiness of the roast pork and the tenderness of the meat. Combined with the flavor of the scallion and the warm rice, it was a tasty combination. The roasted duck was also good, was not bony, and it was a fairly meaty and tender duck. I thought I was given a really generous portion. Since the food is served on a plate, if you are not good at using chopsticks, you can use the soup spoon to scoop up the rice. One small bowl of chicken soup, with a rice plate filled with cha siu, siu youk, and siu ngaap should be enough to fill the stomach of one hungry man. After finishing my meal, the somewhat stout lady said to me. \\"Luk mun boon,\\" ($6.50)That's fairly inexpensive for a tasty meal that can fill up your stomach. $6.50 is probably enough to buy you only a low-quality factory processed fast food meal with soda, a large cup of frozen yogurt, a small hot sandwich, a couple slices of premium pizza, a small roll of sushi, or a medium sized salad in the somewhat decent city of Boston. Atmosphere is fairly gritty, so do not expect a really clean restaurant or really nice people, but somewhat effective service. Somehow, they can keep the government inspectors happy. Overall, this is a really good choice if you want a simple Chinese barbecue meal if you can tolerate the gritty setting and atmosphere. This is also a great option if you are on a really tight budget, want a good meal to fill your stomach and if you are not willing to spend more than $10 for a meal. Another fact for those people who love Yelp way too much: This place has not one, but two stickers saying \\"People Love Us on Yelp\\" posted on the counter, so this place should be \\"legit\\"."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"So from what I heard, you can't really experience Boston without a lobster roll. Supposedly this is the joint to get THE lobster roll. I've had several friends rave about it and I had to come here on my first night in Boston.I met up with a friend and we were seated not too long after I got there. Just a heads up, parking in the North End is a complete NIGHTMARE! Try not to drive around like a mad person like I did, just find the first parking garage and walk. Everything is close by.We started off with a couple oysters: Wellfleet, Island Creek, Wianno, Kumamoto, and another that I can't remember the name. All were extremely fresh and juicy. No grit or brine in the ones we ordered. I regret not ordering more.We each ordered a lobster roll for our meal, one hot (with butter) and one cold (with mayo) to share. It didn't take too long for our food to come out and when it did my eyes completely bugged out and my jaw fell to the floor! Huge mounds of lobster right before my eyes. They don't skimp out at all! We had a discussion on which was better: hot or cold and I'm still debating on which one I liked better. With the hot you get the nice lobster slathered in butter. With the cold you get not just standard mayo, they have some seasoning in there that I can't put my finger on. I think just by ease of eating, the cold one wins by a hair. The roll was a little soggy because of the butter so it was a little harder to eat. You can also order it without the roll but what's the fun in that?! The roll also came with french fries, they were good but a little on the salty side.The $25 price tag on just the lobster roll may scare people but it was soooo worth it! From now on every trip to Boston will require a mandatory trip here. Damn I want one right now!As seen on TV: America's Best on Food Network"},{"name":"Food 101","address":"4969 Roswell Rd, Ste 200","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Had reservations at Food 101 and when we arrived we were greeted by the hostess and were immediately taken to a table. It was Valentine's Day so we were seated in what seemed to be the large group room in the back. When we were seated someone immediately filled our glasses with water and the server stopped by to ask if we wanted anything else to drink. He then asked if we would like an appetizer and we ordered the cheese plate. The cheeses plate comes with a chef's selection of 3 cheeses along with cranberry-walnut bread, a dipping sauce that was sweet and tasted somewhat like an apple preserve. It also came with some candy coated pecans as well. The server was not able to tell us which 3 cheeses would be served but when the appetizer arrived all 3 cheeses were very tasty. Still not exactly sure what cheeses they were but enjoyed each of them. The bread was thinly sliced and complimented the cheese well. It was served on a wooden cutting board and the presentation was very nice. Although this cheese plate was delicious the price point for it was a little high coming in at $15.\\nAfter seeing the tables cheese appetizer next to us, we decided to order another round of cheese but this time the pimento cheese. We like cheese if you can't tell! This appetizer came with a nice scoop of pimento cheese and was served with thinly sliced pretzel bread. The price point for this cheese came in much better than the cheese tray above at $6. Despite the price, we enjoyed this cheese even more than the actual cheese tray so we would strongly suggest purchasing the pimento cheese over the cheese tray.\\nBecause we filled up on cheese we split the pork chop dish. This was an excellent decision. We got our pork chop medium cooked and it was served bone-in. The flavor was perfect and the meat was very tender. There was also very little fat on the meat which was very nice. The pork chop was served with cabbage and a sweet potato dish. This wasn't just any cabbage but it was cooked to perfection with great flavor - it also was a red cabbage which was tasty. The sweet potato dish was somewhat like a casserole but was not overly dominated by any other flavors beside the natural sweet potato. Each of the sides complimented the pork chop very nicely making a delicious entre.\\nWhen we finished our main meal the server promptly took our dishes and asked if we wanted to dessert. Since we pretty much ate dessert as an appetizer with the cheese tray (this is also on the dessert menu) we decided we were not up for dessert. The server immediately brought us our checks after this and was quick to slide the card and bring the receipt back. Overall the service was very fast and prompt, the food was delicious, and the restaurant had a nice atmosphere. The cheese tray was a bit overpriced and the server could've been more knowledgeable to what cheeses were on the tray, but besides that everything else made the visit a very pleasant visit. I would recommend going to Food 101."},{"name":"The Thurman Cafe","address":"183 Thurman Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"The ultimate Burger machine .The Thurminator . Enough said.

She was then going to give us a few minutes to peruse the drink menu before coming back. But it took her close to 12 minutes. When she did finally make it back, she sincerely apologized for the hold-up. She was serving an eight-top, while running food, since they were short on staff. Understandable!

This meal was torture, from the moment we entered this place.  We should have cut tail and run when it took 10 minutes to get to the hostess station, as she, another hostess, and what I would believe to be 2 managers, were staring at the seating chart on their computer screen the entire time (there were two parties ahead of us, and they were as perplexed as we were).  But, we were there, and had a reservation, so we toughed it out (how pretentious does THAT sound).  So there are several empty tables inside, and they ask if we're willing to sit outside, as they'd be able to seat us faster.  M'kay, sure.  We got seated next to some of the most obnoxious/loud people, which made the entire meal unbearable.  It takes the waiter a good 20 minutes to actually get to our table, and another 15 minutes to bring us our drinks (not even water was brought to this point, at least a half hour after being seated). Our apps come out fairly soon after our drinks, so things are looking up.  Finish our apps... 30 minutes later our meals come out.  30 minutes is a really long time (when your neighbor is on your lap and yelling to their friends).  We see the couple that was in front of us at the hostess station leaving the restaurant at this point.  Our waiter checks on us immediately after the food is dropped off by the kitchen staff, and we don't see him for another 30 minutes (no joke).  No drink refills, nothing.  When he does stop by, we ask to see a dessert menu, place our order and ask for the check.  Check is dropped off, picked up, returned... still no desserts.  About 5-10 minutes later our desserts come out.  I get the distinct impression that they separate patrons by perceived income-class, with those they couldn't give a shit about on the patio, and valued customers inside.  And their service to said customers likely reflects that as well.  And the kitchen staff seems to prioritize inside food orders well above patio orders?  I don't know... but we were there for over 2 hours, and we weren't even there during peak mealtime (8:30pm reservation).  I can't recommend this place to anyone, and don't really have any constructive feedback for the restaurant owners on how they should go about fixing, as I believe their entire staff needs to be overhauled/trained, and and and.

Perfectly cooked pieces of Linguica, with peppers, onions, home fry potatoes with Cajun seasoning, with two fried eggs on top with cheese , which comes out sizzling on a fajita skillet! FLAVOR CITY.

Chicken, cheese, bacon, smothered with gravy and sandwiched between two biscuits. Mmmm.There are now a couple of locations but decided to come to the OG location in Alberta cause it made sense to try the original!Came here on a Tuesday morning at about 9 am, and the line was about 6 people deep. Not too shabby... perks of going on a weekday! After about 15 minutes of waiting (lots of time to examine their menu), we got to the counter and ordered from a pleasant young woman who knew her stuff. Quick and efficient transaction, nice. Tables inside are limited and they also have bar-style seating. They had 3 tables in the front along the sidewalk, and several picnic tables outside as well. Ample seating and despite the constant line, I never saw people waiting for tables. Just note that this really aint a place to hang out and chat it up after eating - just eat and run!Reggie ($8) - please see sentence #2 in this review for the description of the Reggie (haha)! supposedly you can have a choice of gravy, but we weren't given a choice. oh well. \\nI'd be amazed if someone were actually able to eat this as a sandwich... unless you have a dislocating snake jaw. Fork and knife it is!Chicken Club ($8) - chicken, bacon, iceberg lettuce, tomato, with blue cheese or ranch (we got ranch), sandwiched between two biscuits. A little dry despite the ranch dressing - similar to the Wedgie which I've also tried (which has a fried green tomato instead of bacon).Biscuits with mushroom gravy ($5) - yup, that's it. This gravy was tastier than the one on my Reggie...but I could get pretty tired of just eating biscuits smothered in gravy after a few bites.They have water cups at a self-serving water spout.

I have been in search of restaurants that fill me up without emptying my wallet and Pho Pasteur does just that. My husband and I visited last Friday night at 7:15 or so before we went to an 8:30 movie.  We were seated immediately and given hot tea moments later.  We were seated at a six person table with another couple at the other end, but we didn't bother them and they didn't bother us.  Plus, if I can eat sooner by sharing tables with others, who am I to complain?We started off with the fresh spring rolls and the wonton soup.  Both were delicious and my husband's soup was a huge portion for a small price ($4).  For our entrees, I ordered a medium bowl of the Beef Pho and Pistol Pete got the Crispy Lo Mein.  Oh. My. God.  The entrees were soooooooo good.  My \\"medium\\" soup was mixing-bowl sized and it was delivered with bean sprouts and basil on the side... I want some just thinking about it.  The Crispy Lo Mein was enormous as well, and I kept stealing bites throughout the dinner.  The sauce on it was so tasty.  I would say the best part of the experience was the food and speedy service, but my husband would disagree.  His favorite part of dining at Pho Pasteur was when the bill came at the same time I was groaning about how incredibly stuffed I was and it was only $24!!!!  He said that he couldn't remember a time, even in college, when he was able to take me out to dinner for less than $50.  Granted, we did not indulge in adult beverages, but we were completely full when we walked to our movie.

They are very skimpy with the meat, and most of the pieces of meat were deceptively mostly bone. On top of that the food was very oily making the rice underneath the meat almost inedible. However the worst part of my experience at this place was that the female server was very rude, her tone was harsh even when taking our order, and when she got my order wrong she tried blaming me. The male chef behind the counter was much nicer and fixed my order, but all he did was scrape off the meat that was wrong and added the meat I had actually ordered (because of this I ended up with even more oil on my rice). Additionally it's just not pleasant to be eating your meal and hear someone hocking loogies in the KITCHEN."},{"name":"Jake's Ice Creams & Sorbets","address":"660 Irwin St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"This was a review from back in December 2009.  I was in the metro Atlanta area with my girlfriend and after a busy day of walking around, we decided to treat ourselves with a little ice cream.  A friend of mine who lived here before raved to me about Jakes, so off we went.  The place was completely deserted, only 1 car in the lot, which made me wonder considering it was rated so well...but maybe it was an off night.  We were a little confused when we walked in and saw a diner set up, with no one behind the register.  Only when the young college kid at the ice cream counter welcomed us did we figure out the place is both a diner and ice cream palor.  It actually is a very visually exciting place, filled with a hodgepodge of birdhouses and knick-knacks, reviews of Jake's mounted on the wall adjacent to the ice cream display, and the chalkboard behind the hammered copper counter reading off their Fried Tomato BLT's.  I don't eat bacon, but I've always wanted to try a fried tomato sandwich, so that will have to be another review.  \\nAs for the ice cream, as you may be wondering, well, it was a disappointment initially.  We had looked up the menu at Jake's online and wanted to try out the Chocolate-Slap-yo-Mama, Mexican Hot Chocolate, O, Chocolate Raspberry Truffle, Brown Sugah Vanilla, Tiramisu Su Sudio, Betwixed, Breakfast in bed, and Picasso.  When we looked down in the display case, there were about 8 flavors available...out of which only the Brown Sugah Vanilla was the only one out of our list.  Apparently, with underserved parlors, Jake's did not have much of their icecreams available, especially those with chocolate, according to the server.  We tried the Brown Sugah vanilla, which was definitely a better vanilla flavor with the warmth of brown sugar arriving as you took your first bite.  We tried out the Pumpkin Piescream, Devyn's Animal Cracker, and a few others which were all delicious, but not the ones we wanted.  After trying them, we asked the server if they had any chocolate flavors, which he did...in the deep freezer and only Chocolate-slap-yo-mama.  Honestly, it took about 20 minutes for him to bring up the tub, and try scraping out the ice cream for one cup.  A little off putting, considering I really wanted to try this ice cream, so I gave my girlfriend the cup and told him to just give me the pina colada ice cream made of coconut cream.  While the ice cream was nice, with pineapple bits trying to stand out against the heavy coconut base, the overall experience wasn't.  Chocolate-slap-yo-mama wasn't bad, with chocolate chunks inside.  The Brown Sugah Vanilla is what I went with...subtle and a nice counter to the Chocolate.  But I have to say, not having the ice creams in...not happy"},{"name":"Wild Wood Bakehouse","address":"3016 Guadalupe St, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Delightful gluten free shop.

I get the impression the chef looks for what's available in season and tries to build the menu around that, and it must be an incredibly exhausting creative challenge to rethink that every day, because there are 5 or 6 sort of important things going on in every dish, and the menu changes daily.Overall the food, at least in January, was dominated by kind of earthy heavy flavors.  They encourage you to order up to 3 half portions instead of full portions, but I'm not sure that's such a great idea unless you're a very curious eater, because each plate has so many exotic handcrafted components you'll want to savor, and it can be kind of overwhelming.  I strongly recommend the duck breast and leg confit.  Don't fool around, order the full portion.  We also had a sliced beef dish that was very good, but beware--while it was advertised as medium rare, the medium rare here is more like rare in other restaurants.  The triticale berry (like a wheatberry) with it was fantastic.  I see from other reviews the sea bread is a flash point.  I loved it's briny flavor but I did wonder about the wisdom of using shellfish in a table bread, it excludes a lot of vegetarian, kosher/muslim and allergic diners.  Squid ink and seaweed are also involved and they make it very pretty to look at.  Also I recommend the cranberry sorbet.  It is out of this world, just sweet enough not to mask that bitter edge cranberries have.  Also it was not too hard, but not at all melted.  Perfect.  The night we went they offered Perigord truffles freshly grated over a dish including a pork sausage. It was enjoyable but you see what I mean about the earthy flavors--especially since the truffles were raw.  There was also a beet salad (again, of the earth) with an interesting 1/4 teaspoon pool of oil with some pistachio crumbs on the side of the plate but I couldn't get it to work for me with the beets.  It probably would have been good with some very plain bread but there is nothing plain at this restaurant. The ambiance is romantic, intimate and warm.  The service was leisurely, but on the flip side they do not rush you which I like very much.  The wine recommendation I got was very appropriate for the food. Also note, because each dish appears to take a serious amount of culinary preparation and fussy artistic arrangement they do not bring everyone's food at the same time. That's OK if you are a couple, because you can share and taste each other's dishes while you wait, but for a larger party or something more formal it's awkward to eat while others are still waiting.\\nThere is a beer and wine license, no cocktails. This is a restaurant for open-minded diners who like the idea of patronizing a kitchen that reaches, even if that means not everything is a perfect success.  I would absolutely go again, but not when I'm starving and want to be pleased with easily accessible familiar flavors.  This is where you go to have your palate educated and stretched, where the food will be foregrounded in your conversation."},{"name":"Com Vietnamese Grill Restaurant","address":"4005 Buford Hwy NE, Ste E","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Great food, great service, had a wonderful time.

I had better BBQ at a BBQ CHAIN RESTAURANT in Oaklahoma than I did here, but that's ok. I expected it.We got an ass-ton of food so I wouldn't just be basing my opinions on one thing. Started off with the Barbeque Belt which had Memphis, Texas and Arkansas style ribs with sliced brisket. Aside from liking my ribs basted in a little bit of sauce before being served (I know about not cooking them with sauce to prevent the sugars burning, but a little basting in the end never hurt anyone!) only one style of the ribs turned out a little dry, which was nice. The beef ribs were tender and juicy. I have no idea which ones were which with the pork ribs but one kind was rather dry. The brisket was unremarkable- plain smokey meat does nothing for me; it needs character AKA sauce. I ended up dipping my BBQ into the beans that came with the plate as they were the only thing that held some reasonable flavor. The little pill cups they served the trio of BBQ sauce in wasn't enough for any one person's plate, let alone the entire table (3 oz of sauce was all we got!) but that's ok,  I was happy to pass on them anyway. We also ordered sides of:\\n corn fritters (very dry on the outside, reminded me of bad doughnut holes- it needed the pool of 'maple syrup' it was swimming in), fried okra (the most boring okra ever- no seasonings in the outer shell- just cornmeal or batter, plain plain plain), corn pudding (I can taste the evaporated milk, can YOU? a congealing, solid mass, not very pudding-like), a side of cole slaw (inocuous, but edible) and collard greens (cooked with a little bit of meat and onions). The collard greens were the only saving grace of that entire parade of side dishes and I wish it weren't so- they were cooked really well, soft and tender but not boiled to hell or casting a sickly yellowish green on our plate. I wish this place gave me a better experience but between the crazy-loud atmosphere in the bar which began to give me noise fatigue even before we sat down to our table which was equally loud, their inability to take reservations, and what seemed like them not getting our orders straight (both in sequence, and in what we got- I saw several other orders like ours served differently than our plate), it made for a rough experience.

That being said:I am a college student. And a lady. So hearing about $5 entrees for ladies every Thursday night was some of the best news I've heard in a while, second to securing an apartment for the fall. One of my cousins (also a lady) just got back from Rome (and I from Prague) and I figured that Match would be a perfect wallet-friendly place to catch up on our European adventures.I got there a little earlier than her and was smacked in the face really hard by a serious amount of estrogen. Ladies Night. Thursday night. Right. I say \\"two people\\" and give my name and am told to expect a 60-90 minute wait. That's cool, I ate some dinnah beforehand and could work up an appetite for $5 entrees. Erika arrives and we grab some cocktails. Despite this place being completely packed we were able to snag a spot to drink our draaaanks next to some dudes. Too old to be relevant.I got the Match Made in Heaven martini despite the cheeztastic name and actually really loved it. I'm a fan of lychees and this one was excellent.. though I would have preferred more booze to tide me over. We were in for a long wait, the hostess was not lying. My cousin really liked her martini but I hate Chambord and hers was way more of a dessert than a drink. To each his own.So while I was waiting I was able to take some time to survey the property. This place is pretty. And romantic. And very Sex and the City. And all of the waitresses wear the same exact brown tight dress and have to wear heels despite carrying a plethora of martinis. This seems cruel to me. FINALLY we were able to sit down but not without a little bit of drama. It's okay, they were packed, I'm forgiving. Our waitress was super sweet and lucky for her, I was hungry. We ordered:\\"exotic\\" mushroom pizza (I put it in quotes because I'm quite certain exotic = baby bellas)\\n2 filet mignon entrees (uh $5)\\nonion rings ($3.50 for 5 rings with... BBQ sauce. really?)Pizza was good despite a bit of false advertising. And it was a good portion for two people at a hefty $9.50. As for the filet mignon... well, there was something off. The sauce on top of my steak was cold which made me uncomfortable. How long was it sitting out for? And it tasted well done. I tried to look but since the place is essentially pitch black I could not tell. But it did not look pink in the little light I had. The mashed potatoes were good and I tasted a bit of goat cheese, my dairy lover.Onion rings were... okay. I like 'em beer battered and dipped in ketchup but this fancy plating could do as well I suppose. I was completely full but could only eat half of my filet. Next time I will order something else but will make sure to try someone else's. There will be a next time. Despite the wait. Despite the brown dresses. Despite the 4 creepy looking guys that were clearly looking for their next lay (kinda smart, the place was chock full o' P). Despite it all... I shall be back. With all my single ladies.

I specially asked to have mine with egg, and as advertised it showed a piece of nori which was also missing. I got two small pieces of meat and the picture clearly shows 3 averaged sized pieces. The server had a hard time understanding my issue partly because of language barrier. You work in Canada! Learn the language! They also got my other friends order wrong by bringing her pork instead of chicken. They blamed the errors on a mixed up in the kitchen with the orders. Lastly, the food itself is not good.

We mingle around and watch the Cavs game (first quarter at the time). After realizing that the game was over, and we were still waiting (10pm at this time), my friends started to bitch and reconsider going here. I told them we might as well wait, \\"it's worth it\\".

At least we all got our orders right. The wait time for food was another 20 minutes, in which time I downed a whole becks bomber waiting.So at 10:50, the thing we've all been waiting for, finally arrives. To my dismay they were seemingly having a liquidation on fried onions on the thurman burgers, I literally had more than a whole onion on it. I partially reconstructed my sandwich and went to town. Imagine my dismay when I discovered the ham and cheese on the top half of the sandwich was COLD. Rather than sending it back for reheating, I again re-assembled it down to the bare hamburger parts. At least the burger held it's heat, and filled me up still.Overall this was a very disappointing visit to thurmans. My friends from out of town agreed the wait this time was just too long.

Walking up to the building, the place was already packed. One of our friends had arrived ahead of us, and was already drinking a beer. Spoiler alert: she would later comment that the beer was the best thing she was served that night.There are two dining areas, and we were seated in what seemed to be the larger one. We noted that we were youngest group in the room, by about 20 years. As the night went on, some other younger groups did arrive.Across our group of four, we ordered the tomato tart, onion soup, coq au vin (one with breast, one with thigh), the tourenado (one rare, one medium rare), the souffle (one with grand marnier, one with raspberry), the crepe suzette, the apple tart, some coffee, and some wine. Since we were doing the prix fixe menu, we ordered everything all at once.Since my wife was unfamiliar with the wines they serve there, she asked for a suggestion for a wine that paired well with her tourenado. \\"What do you normally drink?\\" \\"Cabs\\" \\"We have one of those.\\" Sorry, that's not a suggested pairing.The cabernet he \\"sugggested\\"? It sucked. It tasted vinegary. He \\"suggested\\" a blend that they also had. That one went over much better.The first course had things looking good. The soup, while small, was very good. The tomato tart was also a big hit. The second course was made of disappointment. The fillets in the tourenado were tiny, bland, and overcooked. The vegetables were unevenly cooked. The pasta in the coq au vin was overcooked and mushy. The chicken was bland, tough and bordering on rubbery. Nobody was happy with their entrees.Next up was a course of waiting. I know that souffles take longer to make, but we ordered everything all at once. Even still, we waited almost half an hour for our desserts - which wouldn't have been so bad if they were good. The apple tart was \\"passable\\". The person who ordered the crepe kept trying to pawn it off on everyone else. The souffle with the grand marnier was alright, but unspectacular. The souffle with raspberries was downright bad. The custard was undercooked and the raspberries tasted like something out of a can. They were bitter.Maybe everything was done poorly because they were doing batches of things for Magical Dining Month. Maybe it was just a bad night.

It was by far the best calamari we have had, lightly fried in a crispy 1/2 coating, not too greasy or chewy, just piping hot and rings of fresh tasty squid.

What I can't forget is the Jambalaya! I loved how spicy it was, hot, fragrant, with a sumptuous tomato broth and more seafood then I have ever gotten in a Jambalaya before, there were clams, shrimp, mussels, and fish! I also had the pecan-crusted halibut with asparagus and mashed potatoes.

I do not like the fact that receipt paper is sometimes placed on top of your food when it arrives on the table. I prefer not to have traces of BPA in my system.I had the beef and lamb should slices and they were good quality and well presented. The shredded potato salad was like thinly cut French fries, except it wasn't deep fried. Very light and a little crunchy.The mutton skewers was delicious and I did appreciate that it wasn't overdone and they weren't charred. It had a BBQ spicy taste to it.I had udon and white rice noodles which didn't stand out due to House Special broth which I didn't like at all.I ended up getting a headache which lasted for several days after eating at this place which was probably due to drinking the soup from the hot pot.

This lobster roll blew the previous ones I've had outta the water and I've had a lot.  Maybe because it was warm and all the others I've had were cold and had mayo.

I love that they opened a new Indian restaurant on the Drag, as it is close to the UT campus and provides another alternative to Clay Pit.I was brought up eating Indian food, and from my experience I would say that the food at Teji's is definitely authentic Indian. It has less of a \\"restaurant food\\" taste and more of a \\"home-cooked Indian meal\\" taste, which can be good or bad depending on your preferences. I have only been there a few times but each time I liked what I ordered (chicken tikka masala, and veggie dishes).Teji's is more affordable than Clay Pit and the menu does have a lot of variety. I like that they have combos so that you don't have to order naan, rice and kheer separately with your curry. Service is fast too.Since they seem to get a lot of business, I think that a bigger space would have been better for both the restaurant and its customers. During peak hours, especially when school is in session, I can imagine it being difficult to find a place to sit. A lunch buffet would be a great addition, if they could find the space for it. And they should consider adding achar to their menu!

This was the one place that everyone recommended we had to hit on this trip to Portland. We went to the Alberta location and now I know where we will be getting breakfast on the way out of town every time we come to town. Parking was easy to find just a few blocks away. We had to wait in line for about 20 minutes, this was around noon on a Sunday. I was worried about what looked like seating anarchy, there is no wait service or waiting list but there are tables. There is a rule written on the chalkboard menu that you have to order first before grabbing a seat and the regulars were enforcing that very rule on a group that was in line before us when they sent out a scout for a table. We ordered food and found a spot at the bar after just a minute or so. I got the \\"moneyball\\" which was a biscuit, and egg, and gravy. My fiance got the \\"reggie deluxe\\" which was a monstrosity of a biscuit, bacon, egg, cheese, fried chicken, and gravy somehow called a sandwich. I was worried when I saw all of the sandwiches getting a pre-cooked over-easy egg but was glad to see that they cook you one fresh for the moneyball so you can benefit from all of that yolky goodness. The fried chicken was juicy and tasty, my only complaint on the sandwich front is they don't give you enough gravy, I'd order a side cup. One thing you shouldn't miss out on is dousing everything in a liberal coating of Texas Pete hot sauce. This is like Frank's red hot but with more flavor and I don't think I'll ever eat biscuits and gravy without it. Also the extra hot Blenheim's gingerale is a great hangover cure if you like that nostril searing ginger heat. The \\"side\\" of hashbrowns is the size of a dinner plate, nice and completely crispy and definitely enough for 2. Only downside is: the bathrooms.

The valet took the car and the walk through the condo complex didn't bother me.  We were greeted promptly by the maitre d and seated at the table.  We ordered a nice, expensive bottle of wine which was great and they had a wonderful selection.  I had a veal appetizer, Osso Bucco and creme brulee for dessert.  My wife ordered a Caprese salad with red peppers, Filet and cheesecake.  The food was decent.The Bad - Our service was just absolutely horrible.  It was our first time there and I insured that I marked this when making the online reservation, thinking they would make a good first impression.  We were seated at a very small table between a table of five and a table table of eight.  Later we saw other couples seated at nice tables for four at the back of the restaurant with nice cushion seats where they could look out over the entire restaurant.  Not so for us - I got to look at the wall.  And our service suffered because of being surrounded by two larger tables.  After ordering the expensive wine I again thought it would help insure good service but this was not the case.  We waited and waited for our waiter to take our order.  Finally the maitre d realized we were waiting and took our order.  Waters were not refilled (unlike other said) and when I ordered coffee with my creme brulee - it never came.  Our waiter at the beginning of the night never came back to our table again after the middle of the meal.  Someone else took over, though our original waiter was still waiting on other tables.  I'm not sure what the story was but whatever it was was not good.The Ugly - We paid over $200 for the two of us.  And for the price, I thought neither the food or service was on par with what we paid.  The food was all \\"ok\\", but certainly wasn't worthy of the price.  The osso bucco for example was a large portion, but there was nothing about it at all that made me want to come back and order it again.  It was completely forgettable.  Conclusion - At the end of the day we felt like we were outsiders at some private country club.  Some of the prime guests seemed to get the better seats and service while we sat at our small table just waiting for someone to notice us (take our order or get the coffee that never showed up).  They seemed to know the wait staff and each other.  I guess if you are willing to become a regular and pay premium price for sub-par service and food to be a part of the \\"in\\" crowd - go right ahead.

Happy hour contains $5 select appetizers and $6 cocktails. For our appetizer we chose the pretzel sticks with a side of sweet mustard and cheese. My gosh, were these soft, warm, fresh and a gift from God. I could literally eat a dozen of these, although they are a bit salty the dipping sauces did great to balance out the salt; Thankfully I had a white peach sangria to wash it down, it was an enlightening experience for my taste buds. I think we all grew from the situation.For the entr√©e I chose the flat bread with several cheeses and arugula and my boyfriend chose the New York Strip Steak with pork-belly risotto topped with kale. My flatbread was average but satisfying. The ingredients were fresh but the crust of the flat bread was not as thin and crispy as I would have liked it to be (but that's a personal preference.)On the other hand his steak and risotto knocked it out of the park. The steak was perfectly seared and juicy (cooked medium rare) and the risotto was creamy, mixed with pork belly topped with cooked kale and a side of chopped cherry tomatoes that were sweet. The mixture of ingredients made each bite perfectly delightful! The atmosphere is busy and it's probably a good idea to call ahead for a reservations. I wouldn't recommend this as a place for a romantic intimate date but it would be good for a day/night out with your significant other/ friends/ family to be gathered around for a good meal, it tends to get a little loud with all the tables attempting to talk over each other.\\nService was timely and polite, multiple servers float around the dining area and work as a team, so there are several people checking out your drink levels. At one point my boyfriend had 3 cups of Dr. Pepper on his side of the table (the team of three all thought they would solve his empty cup issue and brought him a cup within two minutes, I guess they missed each other, and he wasn't complaining.) The dress code is also a bit nicer than the Floridian flip flop and shorts attire, but not too fancy. Overall it was a great experience and I can't wait to come back for another special occasion- or any occasion- probably for no occasion at all. Too bad I had driven by this place multiple times for a long time and never thought much about it or giving it a chance - thought it was a fairly generic establishment. I was pleasantly surprised and glad to be wrong."},{"name":"Fresh Kitchen","address":"851 N Alafaya Trl, Ste Q-01","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Went here to pick up dinner!

Walking in at around 10:30 am, I expected to wait for a while since the restaurant is very popular, but because I was by myself, I was able to get a one person seat at the bar immediately. The bar service was great, and all the servers and waiters/waitresses were nice and fast with regards to ordering, menu questions, and getting the bill. In addition, the atmosphere was sunny and cheerful, which made my Tuesday morning that much better.After contemplating and debating between the French toast, fried chicken biscuit sandwich, and polenta and suga, I decided on the polenta and suga because many Yelpers posted photos of that dish, so it seemed like a popular and delicious choice. Once it came, I knew I chose right because I have never had anything like it before. It was a delicious mixture of polenta, a light tomato sauce, black pepper, runny egg, cheese, and pork shoulder. The dish was perfection, and I would come back to eat it as well as recommend it to any others who visit Tasty n Alder. I am almost sure that this dish was not the only unique and delicious one on the menu, which says a lot about a restaurant.Tasty n Alder is located in a convenient downtown area with a lot to do nearby as well. Shopping, sweets, coffee, etc. are all only blocks away, so it is a good restaurant to pig out in and then walk it off. I highly recommend Tasty n Alder for brunch!"},{"name":"Korean Grille","address":"1429 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"3","text":"I wish Quincy would have better asian food - especially Korean. =(I love korean food and when I'm too lazy to venture out too far, I find myself here.Food is decent enough for me to eat.. but very inconsistent.

The cold lobster sandwich is just the normal mayo type and not really all that exciting.

The man told me how hot their spicy got, but I just made it clear that it needed to be as hot as they can get. The man nervously replied that there's the hotness level that his wife cooks for herself, but they've never done that for a customer. He'd have to ask her if she'd be willing to do it for me. She said yes, but she was also nervous. I told them that whenever my husband goes to Thai food, he always requests as spicy as they go and it's never hot enough. So, they ageed to make it and my husband waited in eager expectation. The restaurant was worried about his digestive system, but said if he didn't think that the food was hot enough, there was chili oil on the side. The dish was hot enough on its own. My husband loved it. He didn't need to add the additional oil (though he saved it). He did come out crying in the end, but only in the best way.

However, we were impressed by the thoughtfulness of the narrow metal awning going around the corner, protecting waiting customers from the rain. Pine State Biscuits has you order first and then take a seat. However, there is only about three or four feet between the cashier and the door, which does not allow for more than a few people in line at a time, hardly a transition zone. Stepping into the restaurant prompted mouths to water as the aroma of biscuits hit us. The sunroofs and big windows allowed bright, natural lighting. This combined with the indie pop music playing created an upbeat, casual environment. However, the posters depicted the inside of chickens and eggs, which was a little unsettling considering Pine State Biscuits serves almost exclusively biscuits and fried chicken. Bar seating surrounds a kitchen space in the front of the house. We as customers found this to be enticing, but we were not impressed with the stiff slices of American cheese being melted in the open toaster.  Pine State Biscuits pushes their drink menu less than other brunch spots in Portland. There is a large menu of food options above the register, while the drink menu is behind the cashier. Most menu items are similar, biscuits of slight variation. The biscuits we ordered were delicious, but like we read in online reviews, the portions might have been too large.Looking at the crowd, some people came in large groups while others sat by themselves at the bar. Many tourists came both in groups and alone, asking locals for recommendations. The absence of waiters combined with the crowdedness created an environment that encouraged strangers to converse. The popularity of Pine State Biscuits caused quite a bit of foot traffic in the street. The employees were all very nice, some initiating friendly conversation. Even though Pine State Biscuits is always busy with a line out the door and almost no seating, their employees are able to maintain a fun, laid-back environment. All employees wore black, and some wore something colorful on top, like a vibrant Hawaiian shirt or a rainbow cardigan. Though they obviously had guidelines for a uniform, employees seemed to be given permission to be unique. This added to the fun, upbeat yet laid-back atmosphere."},{"name":"Scratch","address":"223 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"Executive summary: This place is not for dinner. It is a nice place to meet friends for a drink and a couple nice tapas before going out, or, for grabbing a bite late before heading home for the night. The tapas are generally flavorful, but the portions are more like small bites than the sort of tapas you had in Spain. Many dishes do not lend themselves to sharing easily. The beer and wine selection was fun, interesting, and well thought out. Specifics:We arrived with friends about the time they were opening. We thought the d√©cor was cozy, cute, and quirky.  We were the first table. Our party ordered some wine and beer.  The service was attentive and efficient for the most part, no complaints there.The best part:The scallop special was lovely, perfectly cooked with a nice bacon flavored crust.\\nThe pork belly's salty and sweet soy glaze with micro cilantro was flavor filled and unctuous.The worst part:The most disappointing was the beet salad which consisted of a few extremely thin slices of beets with a handful of greens on top which mostly buried the main ingredient.  Perhaps, it's just me, but I don't think you should have to dig through a pile of greens to get to what is supposed to be the featured ingredient of the dish.  The other dishes were good, but nothing noteworthy.Conclusion: Under just the right circumstances we might go again, but we are not planning on it.

When it came time to choose a Valentine's Day dinner locale, Barcelona seemed like the perfect choice--a place I'd been dying to try, as well as an opportunity to recreate a most romantic getaway.There were many elements of Barcelona that reminded us of the cuisine on our trip--the extensive, yet reasonable wine list. The extensive tapas options. And of course, the paella (which is the main reason I wanted to come). I can't speak to whether its truly authentic, as I've only visited the country once. However, the taste was incredible, and I think that ultimately outweighs any element of authenticity.Barcelona is hidden away in the German Village, a picturesque neighborhood of Columbus. We easily found street parking. I enjoyed the casual elegance of the restaurant. Parts of it almost have a tavern like feel, with a lot of wood paneling and a bar in front. The tables are a little crowded together, but I never felt like I was a part of the conversation of the table next to us. Our waiter Sean was courteous and attentive, and provided many suggestions and explanations for first time visitors.The meal started with crusty bread with a side of salsa in oil, very reminiscent of our meals in Spain. We opted for a combination of the tapas flight, 3 courses for $30, and the paella Barcelona, which was $28. The flight is designed to be a meal for one, but sharing of both dishes was the perfect way to experience the whole restaurant.

There are two cashiers eagerly awaiting to make your coffee, and one manager who I don't know her name, but we'll call her \\"Punkie McSnarkbitch\\" or who my girlfriend refers to as \\"Ms. I hate my dad,\\" delegating to the two cashiers.  Having made the mistake of ordering prepared hot food from this establishment before, I opted for a bagel which is accompanied by a side togo ramekin of pre-packed whatever.  Surely this complex order could be carried out without adding to the pile of tickets in the kitchen window.  The cashier, having a morning full of experience delivering upsetting news, calmly explain it would be a 15 minute wait for a toasted bagel.  Being a problem solver, I asked if I may have an untoasted bagel with cream cheese, if it was possible to maybe skip the 15 ticket, 15 minute wait, and if she had it in her to grab a fvcking bagel and pre-packed ramekin of cream cheese, and drop it in a brown paper bag.  After conferring with second cashier, they both decided this was a reasonable request and we had a solid case to bring in front of judge Punkie McSnarkbitch.  She was clearly in the weeds herself, single-handedly running the \\"ice in cup / defeated sigh of hopelessness\\" station while the cashiers waited for the second phase of my coffee order, which was pour pre-made ice coffee over ice, secure lid, hand to customer.  Quite successful in this area, they've nailed it, 2 minutes for a drink with two ingredients....ice + coffee.  It must have been the cashiers first day / first attempt in breaking into the cut-throat barista territory, b/c Punkie publicly shot down our request and educated Cashier #1 and #2 that orders were filled in order, even if it's JUST a bagel.  It felt like when your childhood friend wont talk to you and says to your other friend aloud \\"tell so and so I'm not talking to you........\\" while they're 2 feet away.  Yes I understand you fill orders in order, yes I understand most restaurants don't have a system where they roll up my ticket and throw it in a fvcking bingo basket and have drawings for who's next.  So we cancelled the order knowing it would be far quicker to return home and bake one from scratch.  Here's some unwarranted advice for anybody associated with decision making at this place:  I've seen kitchens of equal size successfully execute tasting menus for 12 tables(check out Bondir in Cambridge), breakfast cooking is the quickest and simplest prep'd station of the day.  Either your cook is shit, or you don't prepare enough ahead of time to rapidly expedite food.  Maybe do some prep work from lunch until 8pm when you close?  Maybe?  Your menu doesn't change, you know what sells the most, get it together. You have two cashiers and a useless manager who'd rather treat the customer like a restaurant ignorant patron who is making blind request for special treatment.  How about instead of 1/2 making drinks, you allow the baristas to do their job and find a better use for your time, like lets say.....go toast a fvcking bagel, or help the weeded cook. I wouldn't even try to order food here unless you look at the ticket window and it's empty.  I can't even imagine what the lunch rush looks like, it's most likely full of people finishing their breakfast sandwiches before they close at 8pm.

The A/C only seemed to be half-working, which was unfortunate because it was the hottest day of the week and we had just speed walked over from the other restaurant when we got the call that our table was up.Why: b had been wanting to try it and I was craving a lobster roll.What:Allagash White\\n- b's usual. Light.Sankaty Light Lager\\n- Bar's recommendation when I asked for something light. It was alright. A little bit too bitter of an aftertaste but then again, I'm pretty sensitive to bitterness.Oysters! (duh)\\n- They give you a handy dandy cheat sheet with all of the oysters' names, where they're from, their price, and a short description of their taste. Although whether the taste matches the description is pretty subjective.Island Creek (MA)\\n- b's favorite. We did not find them as salty as they were described. Plump and juicy.Pemaquid (ME)\\n- I liked these. Again, did not find them as salty as they were described. Plump.Browne's Point (ME)\\n- Forgettable.East Beach Blonde (RI)\\n- I really liked these from when I had tried them at Eastern Standard. Maybe I was tipsy at the time. They weren't as awesome as I remembered them. One was also super salty while the rest were moderately so. Fairly small in size.Summerside (PEI)\\n- Forgettable as well.Lobster Roll (I chose to have it served hot and buttered on a toasted roll with fries)\\n- It was good but I was expecting more what with the hype and the price tag. There were plenty of lobster chunks but they were a little bit too drenched in butter. Because of that, the roll, which wasn't very toasted to begin with, was somewhat soggy.Overall, it was kind of underwhelming. Granted, we might have been slightly more excited if we weren't all stressed and sweaty from the mad rush over from Chinatown to keep our table, if the place had been a little bit cooler, and if we hadn't already eaten another meal during our wait. If I do give it another shot, I'll be more prepared for the wait next time. Although I'm not sure what would warrant waiting that long again."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Incredible vibe. Nice staff/people.

I usually arrive at the north end too hungry to wait the quoted three hour wait and find a different (and yummy) place to eat at. Last time, I got called an hour and a half later, but I was already enjoying a meal else where. I was prepared this time, had a snack before hand, arrived and had my boyfriend put our names down, parked the car, walked over, waited for cannolis at Mikes, grabbed a drink at a coffee shop, and finally got called for our table. This took about an hour and a half.I was disappointed in the lobster roll. We ordered it hot, but felt like we got a room temperature lobster roll. I wanted warm, oozing butter dripping down my face! I have had better from Luke's lobster and a the Easton's Beach Snack Bar in RI for half the price.However, I did fall in love with the Cioppino - such a large variety of fish, shrimp, clams, and mussels cooked to perfection with a hint of herbs and a kick of heat on top of saffron rice. Delicious. I will be back for that!! And maybe a few oysters from the raw bar. Great experience over all - had to try the lobster roll once, right? Enjoy!Also, kudos to the hostess that worked yesterday and was so pleasant to everyone, including the angry homeless man that decided to sit down when a table cleared out and argued that he had reservations."},{"name":"Splash Ultra Lounge & Burger Bar","address":"150 Kneeland St","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"Wow wow wow! I'm not sure what some of the negative reviews here are talking about--I had a spectacular time at Splash!My friend and I came for their Wednesday Girls' Night Out special. Purchase a drink and get a 3-course dinner...for FREE! Sound like an amazing deal? It is.Yeah, the drinks were a pricey $13 but my Hendrick's Blossom was pretty good. My friend wasn't a huge fan of her Greygoose grapefruit vodka cocktail, and I didn't like it much either, so avoid that if you want something with a more fruity, sweet taste.But the food! I was prepared for it to be sub-par and small-portioned....but....it.....wasn't. On both counts. Starter was a salad of field greens perfectly dressed and topped with dried cranberries and nuts.Entree (from a choice of 3) was the salmon for both of us. Maybe it's because this dish has some of my favorite foods in it--I wolfed it down. Big, juicy chunks of salmon over a bed of linguine (my favorite pasta) with a light tomato sauce filled with onions and herbs. So absolutely delicious! And when the waitress/bartender came to clear our plates, and I asked my friend if I could finish the last of hers, she said she could just order me another one. I looked at her surprised--I was certain the 3-course thing was set. Nope. \\"Why not?\\" said the waitress, \\"It's free\\".So I ordered another one (I was starving and have a pretty bottomless stomach for my favorite foods when I'm hungry). I guess they ran out of the salmon by the time the order went through, so instead I got the mushroom ravioli. Which my friend and I promptly devoured. Dessert was a slice of NY cheesecake with whipped cream and chocolate and raspberry sauce. Lovely.Even more lovely: Our final bill, which was a measly $26 for the two of us.The staff (both male and female) are all impossibly beautiful 20-somethings, but more importantly, they are so friendly. From the moment we walked in to the time we left, everyone was incredibly nice and attentive. Top marks for service.The roof deck is smaller than the pictures make it look, but quite lovely with cabanas on the side, a bar, and plenty of (bar) tables, with a small pool/fountain running down the middle.

It was so worth it to come back to try this place. I ordered the hot lobster roll and it was incredibly delicious. there are not many places that have \\"hot\\" lobster rolls and by that I mean the temperature, most places serve them cold and having them like this was simply amazing, so buttery and delicious.

For those who never waited two hours for brunch.  What can I say?  I have the stubborn gene.  Also, chef John Gorham's version of breakfast is about the greatest thing I've ever tasted before 12 PM in my entire life.  So there's that too.This time, at his newest spot Tasty n Alder, I knew what I was getting myself into.  It's a wait straight out of Portlandia's Brunch Skit.  But,  I knew first hand that the food is reward enough for a wait here.   This time, the wait at Tasty n Alder was easier than expected.  About an hour and 10 minutes on Sunday, and with Stumptown just a few short blocks away in the lobby of the Ace Hotel. our cell phone rang in no time, and it was our turn.  Turns out if you are waiting for the right one, a girl can wait a long, long time.The brunch options here are staggering.  We didn't really scratch the surface. The problem here is everything is so good, and you want to try a little of everything, but everything is so rich, you fill up quickly.  I think the motto here is come hungry, and try as much as you can.We were presented with a complimentary half order of Auntie Paula's French Toast, compliments of the kitchen right after we put in our order.  This was decadently simple on brioche bread with apple maple jam and whipped cream.  The bambino plate had one of the better biscuits I can remember eating, ever, with honey butter and housemade bacon  --its good to be a kid here.  Its also good to be a mom that gets the remains of the biscuit  --honestly, one of the best biscuits.  Ever.My husband ordered the steak and eggs with jalapeno pancake & jalapeno butter, and this was sensational.  I had the ragu and polenta with egg on top, and this was so incredibly rich, I'd recommend it, but as a shared dish for 2-3 people.  I filled up after about ten uber-rich bites.  The couple next to us got the grilled romaine salad, which looked unique and light, and would have been perfect paired with my polenta dish as a share.  Then an order of Tasso Hash that wandered by to someone else's table is now on my wish-list for another visit.  Oh, and why didn't I save some room for the chocolate potato donut with creme anglaise?  The thing about Tasty n Alder (and Tasty n Sons) is that this is not a place to order a dish, and call it a day.  This is a place to have a breakfast ordering strategy.  Did she just say that???  I am not kidding.  Go in here with a plan.  Dishes should be traded, tasted and shared.  Ordering any one thing leaves you at a distinct disadvantage of not letting you taste something else, and pretty soon you can't eat another bite.  So try all you can, bring lots of friends, twist their arm to order and share and try as much as you can.  Don't worry  --its all good!"},{"name":"The Wing Bar","address":"494 Flat Shoals Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place is legit.They cook wings with real heart and passion.

Also sometimes the culinary experiments didn't work so well-  the Monte Cristo, a croque monsieur with maple syrup was way too overpowered by the huge amount of syrup it was drowning in. Sicilian hash was flavorful but just a bit too greasy. Some operational advice to management:  post the menu on the front door, so the throngs of people waiting outside can start to choose/shortlist items and speed up the process to order later on. Also, we saw several empty tables even while people were waiting, which tells me they haven't figured out how to get tables cleaned quickly and running,at full capacity.

There is a bouncer at the door which is a little weird, especially because the restaurant wasn't crowded.  The music was very good, great environment 5/5. Our waitress was friendly and nice but her service was sooo bad. I wasn't sure who our server was by the end of the night.  We ordered 2 drinks per a person in the 2 hours we were there and we had to flag our waitress down every time we wanted to order (I usually understand if the restaurant is busy, but they weren't and there were empty tables). It was very frustrating for us, because we truly did enjoy the drinks and food once it was served. The most frustrating issue was the restaurant didn't even acknowledge or apologize for how bad their service was, and were clearly aware of what was going on and our situation, we were very patient and didn't whine or complain, but you could definitely tell they knew what was going on. We had to flag a different waiter down every time after waiting to place an order.Drinks: a fun array of cocktails. All very fun names, unique and delicious. Everyone was happy with their drink choice. I ordered a NY Swizzle which was delicious and refreshing as well as a \\"Paul Rudd's....\\" which was sweet but also good.Appetizers: the shishito peppers were so delicious and great flavor. The pork rock candy dish was huge and you could share this with the table or enjoy as a meal, it was so flavorful and succulent. The empanadas were okay, nothing great.  The octopus was incredible and one of my favorites, cooked to perfection the flavor was incredible and you could even order this as a main dish.Food: the burger was very juicy and super flavorful, definitely recommend. My friend has the tagliatelle pasta and wolfed it down.Dessert: we ordered two orders of churros and they only brought us one. These are more like donuts with chocolate dipping sauce than churros.  There was no cinnamon sugar on them (definition of a churro) so just fried dough and sauce.

Overall I rate the various restaurants in the BJ's chain a solid four stars.  While not outstanding, it's a pleasant experience, reasonably priced, service is generally very good and attentive and the we enjoy the food and drinks there.  Food can be a little inconsistent at times and I suspect that is related to who is in the kitchen. It's nothing bad, but my husband always orders the Jambalaya and sometimes it is much spicier than others, but portion sizes and food quality are fine.  I downgraded this overall review to three stars, simply due to one restaurant - International Drive, Orlando. Please note that the remaining part of this review pertains only to this one specific branch.  I don't know who is running the show there, but it is the worst service I have had in years.  We waited a long time for drinks, which arrived one at a time. There was about a 15 minute wait for my beer. It wasn't busy at the time so it's hardly like the bar was backed up.  We ordered an appetizer which took insanely long and our server was nowhere to be seen.  Someone else showed up from the kitchen bearing our entrees and we told them we hadn't received our appetizer yet.  It seemed to be quite puzzling to the staff that we actually didn't want the food on the table until we had eaten our starter.  Another ten minutes ticked by and the appetizer arrived. By this time everyone's drinks were empty and again, you couldn't even see anyone to flag down for a refill.  The moment the entrees arrived it was glaringly obvious that the food had been sitting for close on 20 minutes in a warmer. It was dry, the fries on my daughter's plate were so dried out and hard that they were completely inedible.  I was tired and hungry and decided to keep quiet and just pick on my food as best I could. My chips were so greasy and clearly my plate had been standing around with the others.  Our server did eventually replace the fries with some very greasy ones that daughter wasn't interested in eating.  I can't say I blame her.  There must have been a quart of oil soaked up in that little portion.  We decided we had been there for so long already we would just get the check and leave. On our way out the hostess waved at us and asked if we had a nice time. I simply replied \\"Not particularly.\\"  Without stopping as she walk by in the opposite direction she flashed us a little smile and said, \\"Sorry about that.\\"  That' pretty much sums up the experience.  We will return to the branch we love in Oviedo. But not for a while. I need to get rid of the bad taste this experience has left in my mouth first before I can think BJ's again."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"The biscuit is fluffy how I like, and the vegatarian option of the mushroom gravy is unmatched!

Delicious drinks w/ big ice cubes, all which feature that little bit of extra something that makes it special from other places (whether it's a spice, egg white, or other ingredient).  There's also a fairly extensive wine list too.Our table also ordered most of the menu- too much to name here but high notes included the arancini (fried risotto), and the truffled mushrooms.  I enjoyed all the dishes, but the snacks/sides/small plates are pretty small. Since we were starving, we kept ordering and ordering and ordering....Servers are of the hipster ilk (though no black rimmed glasses), but super nice and knowledgable about the menu.On the southern side of Old Fourth Ward (I live at the northern edge of O4W & Inman Park), on the corner of Edgewood & Boulevard, which isn't the prettiest place but the interior is polished, cozy and cool, without being pretentious. Like Kathleen M. says- not too dressy and not too casual. It's also kinda fun watching everyone go to the wrong door (everyone, include myself, first goes toward the giant windowed doors, instead of the sketchy little side door, which is the actual entrance).

The white sauce on top of it was good but the chili sauce wasn't great, it wasn't a good compliment to the other stuff. When mixed all together, this reminds me of a Mediterranean Chipotle! Definitely a delicious satisfying meal and they give you enough for 2 meals. We also got the beef shawarma. Now thissss had ALOT of meat! Wow it was practically just meat in pita bread. There was hardly any veggies. The pita itself was soft and did not crumble from my bite. The flavor was really tangy though. One thing I'm not crazy about is how both meals had a very strong flavor of cumin, it was almost overpowering. Overall, the price was reasonable for the size of the food.

Yes, you read that right, a three and a half hour wait.  We read other reviews on Yelp that the wait would be long and were 'prepared' to go to nearby bars and have a small snack/drink to kill time.  You cannot go in around 7 or 8 or 9 pm and expect to be seated in an hour or at the bar, etc.  There are others who have waited longer and the hostess will tell you and many others.  You cannot make a reservation over the phone, you have to physically walk in and see what time you can be seated.  Soo, be prepared to plan your night accordingly.  Who knows, maybe you'll go on a slow night and not have to wait that long.That being said, the food is amazingly fresh.  We had the Triton Plateau that consisted of crab cocktail, lobster cocktail, freshly shucked oysters, mussels, littleneck clams, and shrimp cocktail.  Our favorite was the crab cocktail.  We also ordered the clam chowder.  The clam chowder is a little on the runny/soupy side, but I enjoyed the flavor and the fresh taste.  My husband and my sister's boyfriend preferred a more hearty/thick clam chowder.  The men had cioppino with lobster while my sister and I shared a hot buttered lobster roll.

I went there with 2 others, 1 of whom was Hispanic.  The first clue that we should not have stayed was the Host (who we later discovered was also the manager).  He seemed a little flustered as the restaurant was busy and people were lining up at the escalator that was located right at the entrance to the restaurant.After communicating our desire to have a table, 2 or 3 4 times, he finally added us to the wait list.  We were seated about 10 minutes later.  The second clue that we should have left came after we sat down.  Typically in California, where I live, tortilla chips and a couple of different salsas are automatically delivered to the table.  Here, we had to order - so we did.  The 'appetizer; was delivered on a parchment covered baking sheet with 3 take out cups of different salsa.  While the salsas looked different, they all tasted the same - bland.Being hungry we ordered - I will not speak for my colleagues, only myself.  There are a couple of things I like to try in order to gauge a Mexican restaurant - carnitas, pollo con mole and chile relleno.  If they can make those items fairly decently I migfht be back to ttry other things.  No carnitas or anything mole on the menu so I settled on their special 'house' chile relleno - I'm a sucker for anything with cheese and ground pork...We placed our orders and proceeded to be unimpressed by the chips and salsa, waiting for our orders.  About 30 minutes later, our waitress informed us that our orders would be out in a couple of minutes.  45 minutes later we tried to get the attention of our waitress to find out what was going on.  An hour later our waitress finally came back and announced that our orders were going to be up next.Fifteen minutes later, we flagged our waitress to let her know that we were leaving and wanted to speak to the manager.  The response was - your orders are coming out now.  I still wanted to speak with the manager.  The 'manager' aka 'Host' wandered over and asked what the issue was.  We explained that if there is a problem in the kitchen that ends up in a 1 hour 20 minute wait that he and/or the wait staff need to communicate that to their patrons.  His response was 'So what do you want me to do about it?'  I could think of a few things at the moment but decided to simply state that our experience at this place of business would be broadcast for all to see.So, the good.  The chile relleno was actually not bad.  Not the best I've ever had but certainly not the worst (that prize belongs to 'Mexico' in Honolulu - absolutely the worst Mexican food I've ever had in my life.  Never go there.  Ever) On a scale of 1 to 5 I'd give it a 2.5.The not so good.  Charging for chips & bland salsa served on a baking sheet.  Guys, get a grip.  Buy some baskets, find a decent salsa recipe and just put it on the table.  If doing something like that is going to affect cash flow and drive you out of business, you deserve it.  Solid Zero for taste & presentation.The pathetic.  One hour and 20 minutes for 3 not so exotic orders to arrive?  And a restaurant manager who thinks this is no big deal?  You have to be kidding me.  Minus 5 for service.  I can't rate this place as a zero - that should be fixed in Yelp - because Jalapeno Charlie's deserves every bit of a zero based on the absolutely atrocious service.  If this was the best Mexican food I had ever tasted, and it isn't, I wouldn't go back out of principle.  Treat your patrons like crap and they will vote with their feet.Bottom line, if you are hungry or thirsty bring your own food & drink because you will be lucky to get anything served to you out of their kitchen.  And if you do, you won't have any idea when that may happen.  I will never, ever go back there again.Oh, they did comp me for the chips & salsa as 'recompense' for the wait.

These are all fair points, but it never stopped me in the last 4 years from popping in for a delicious sandwich a few times a month. Yeah, the service is generally bad, and the attitude is excessive. But it's a minor inconvenience in the grand scheme of yummy sandwiches.But I will no longer be a customer after my last 3 visits.For the last half decade or so, you used to be able to get a sandwich about the size of your head at Darwins. The cost was \\"pricey,\\" but never \\"over-priced\\"; you could find cheaper sandwiches, but they were smaller.It appears, however, that Darwins has reduced the meat portion of their sandwiches by about 50-75%. A sandwich at Panera is now not only cheaper, but bigger as well. Anyone that has eaten here prior to the last 4 months can check out the photo I posted and see for yourself. When I first went in last fall and received one of these mini-sammys I thought it was just a fluke...but it's not. They've rearranged their seating to look more like a traditional coffee shop, so my charitable interpretation of the sandwich debacle is that they are trying to transition away from a sandwich spot to a \\"set-up-your-laptop-and-sip-your-coffee-and-get-one-of-these-(now)-over-priced-sandwiches-because-you-don't-want-to-lose-your-spot\\" places.Or maybe it's because they just suck now."},{"name":"Clerys","address":"113 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"We stumbled across Clerys not for drinks but to get a drink and do dinner. \\nOk, we got one of those alternative nights that they don't advertise but everyone that shows up was, let's just say odd.

These days I live closer to the Beaverton and Tanasbourne locations, so these are my most frequented spots. Plus parking is much easier as the original NW location is not disabled friendly. The sushi here is pretty much always consistent, especially the rolls. You won't find glitzy hyped-up and over-sized decorative rolls here, a little more traditional in portions and combinations. I mostly go for the Oregon Roll, the real crab (not Krab), salmon, fresh avocado and crispy asparagus bite is so addicting. It's really all I need. Now the not so good ... I'm also a huge fan of Hamachi nigiri and sashimi, but have not had good luck at any location on several occasions, even tried some nigiri and sashimi cuts again just a few days ago. Sadly, never again, not sure why Mio just can't get this one right. Hamachi (yellowtail) is one of those kinds of fish where if it's off, it's just kind of gross. Hamachi should have a more translucent color with a soft clean buttery texture and taste, non-fishy if that makes sense!?! Seriously. More often than not, if it's muddy or dull in color it's probably going to taste off, like old fish. Too bad, as Hamachi is one of my favorite kinds of fish and overall Mio has been a solid sushi experience. Salmon nigiri and sashimi has always been perfect. I've tried a handful of their other rolls and have had no complaints, it bodes well that they use real crab more often than fake, so I will continue to get them here.Pricing is fair and average market price. If anything it's on the lower price scale, but not by much. Parking varies by location, Beaverton is terrible due to recent construction (12/2019) and Tanasbourne is always easy with a big shared lot, NW is stairs only and street parking.

And to top it off I think I got food poisoning!!!!! My mom and I arrived at Neputne Oyster on a rainy Friday afternoon around 1:30pm and the place was packed! The restaurant is extremely small that you have to share tables with strangers. The wait staff doesn't even bother separating the tables out a little bit b/c there just isn't any space. And to make the lack of square footage even worse, camera crews were pacing back and forth filming a TV series for the Food Network (which was kind cool if the food was actually up to par). Okay....so I'll eliminate the service aspect of Neptune Oyster from this review since it wasn't an ordinary restaurant day b/c Food Network was filming. So..onto the main topic..THE FOOD! Between my mom and I we ordered Kumanoto oysters, Littenecks, shrimp cocktail, the hot lobster roll and the Vitello Tonnato sandwich. The Kumanotos were about $2.90 each and they tasted really fresh, however, I had got really sick after we left the restaurant.  I've had my share of raw foods at various restaurants and different parts of the world, and this is the first time I've had this happen to me. So you've all been warned...I've never seen shrimp cocktail the size of my palm, but unfortunately, in this case bigger isn't better. The cocktail shrimps were overcooked which made the texture of the shrimp way too firm. FAIL! And as for the hot lobster roll, I was not impressed whatsoever. For $25 I expected a lot more. I agree with the other reviews that the roll was overflowing with lobster, but the bun was not toasted and our lobster roll was definitely not \\"hot\\", at best our roll was lukewarm. I was thoroughly disappointed when I took my first bite. If I'm going to eat a lobster roll dipped in butter I would expect to taste the butter. Our roll lacked everything I expected it to encompass. FAIL! I decided to step out of my comfort zone and try something that didn't necessarily sound appetizing. I ordered the Vitello Tonnato sandwich which was served with tuna tartare, roasted veal with a cumber salad inside. I thought I would try to let my palate experience different things, but this sandwich made a statement to my taste buds to never mix fish and veal in sandwich. The textures did not merry well and it was just a weird combination. I think the sandwich would have been better off just the tuna tartare and the cucumber salad. Also, the sandwich had way too much roasted veal and it masked the freshness of the tuna tartare. Again...FAIL! I'm sure after reading this review, you know what I'm going to say. Don't waste your time with Neputne Oyster because it's overrated and there's a pretty high chance you might get sick. I'm willing to give this place a second chance, but for now...I won't be coming back to Neptune Oyster anytime soon."},{"name":"Truffles Fine Foods","address":"785 Davie Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I come here for lunch a couple times a week as I work nearby.

Our waiter from the initial greeting seemed like he didn't want to be there, I'm not going to name drop simply because I'm trying to give him the benefit of the doubt and toying with the idea that maybe his attitude was a result of maybe his dog dying or some personal situation that happened right before work and he was having an off night.  As previous reviewers have stated service was slooooowwww.  Some drinks we ordered never came, food we ordered never came etc.  at first I let it go but then it became one thing after another and we all began to feel as though our table was being singled out.  At one point the manager was involved and she stated she noticed our table was not getting much attention etc.  What really did it for us was when we asked for our bill to be split three ways,  20 mins go by and our waiter is delivering three checks to the table next to us, he then comes back to us and goes \\"hey can y'all just do one check\\"... we spoke up and questioned why he just split the table next to us up for them but couldn't do the same for us?  He then leaves again for 20 more mins,  we sat down at 8:35 and this was now 11:15pm for a couple small plates and three rounds of drinks.  He comes back and asks me if I had a gold American Express which I did not... he leaves again, comes back asked my friend what card she had so he knows which one to run for her, as he's asking what card to run she gets two notifications on her phone for charges from the restaurant for $40 and $90.  The manager comes back over at this point we are so frustrated and fed up with the whole experience, we told her we're missing food, we're missing drinks, he refused to split our bills but split up the table next to us, got cards mixed up didn't know which one to charge but had apparently already ran one card for charges that weren't even our bill!  The manager offered to take a drink off.  The food was ok and the place was cool inside but seriously not worth the 3 hour ordeal it took to have some small plates and drinks, when I left I was so frustrated and angry that I was no longer even excited about the rest of our night.   My best advice for anyone wanting to try it out,  EAT before you go and have a few drinks before you go, service is too slow otherwise.  Also I hope for their sake they get more staff because our waiter was able to check in on us every 20-30 mins and when we would order he would walk away before we could even finish or someone else could order, he was the only person I saw running around besides the manager on a Friday night.

Luckily for me I ordered something simple like the scallops but I only got 5 and for that expensive price, definitely not worth it because I've had better. My husband ordered the catfish and he hated it, he said it was overcooked, too much breading & it was cold! He said they made it as if was frozen, already cooked and dumped it in a frier. It came with succotash (corn & green beans) and he thought that was bland. My mom was in town too & she ordered the clam spaghetti & she said it was cold & bland as well. Super overpriced for crappy food. We will never be coming back here which is too bad because we live close to Disney Springs. The icing on the cake was the wait despite the fact we made reservations! We specifically asked for a water view and they said no problem but wanted to to give us what they call a \\"water view\\" and it was a view of the paddle aka an obstructed view of the water, horrible view.Needless to say we had high hopes for this place but we will never be returning and I don't recommend anyone else to go either. This is not what you would expect a Disney Springs restaurant to be, if you're paying all that money for your meal you deserve good food.

Jennie told me to come give her cart another try, and I'm glad I did.First up, another go on the chocolate mousse that I heavily criticized on my first visit ($3). This time, a much more successful mousse. Besides a larger portion, the mousse itself had more structure. The whipped cream on top still lacked the airy, extremely light qualities I'm used to seeing, but in all fairness, even that was still an improvement from the first go-around.Jennie's Creme Brulee ($3) was next. A well-executed brulee, with perfectly torched caramelized sugar sealing a lovely custard underneath. I found the custard light and pleasant. Breaking through the fragile sugar was like opening a present on Christmas day. Best of all, it was not overly sweet. A wonderful dessert.Lastly, one of Jennie's rotating specials, the Almond Cream Bienenstich ($4), a German pastry with puff pastry (or sweet yeast dough), Bavarian cream, and what really amounted to an almond brittle-like topping. The various texture contrasts (a chewy puff pastry, smooth cream, and nutty, crunchy almond brittle) made this my favorite of the three.\\"Bienenstich\\" means \\"Bee Sting Cake.\\" Legend has it that the inventor of the dish got stung by a bee. Another possible story involves people who threw beehives to stop a group of raiders from entering the village, then celebrated by making this dish (yeah, I used Wikipedia).Cartlandia's Facebook page has more pictures of Jennie's desserts. Warning: you may get hungry (again) after viewing them.I got a chance to see what truly comes out of this food cart. I noticed several people stopping by Jennie's cart, contemplating what to order. Yes, it's quite a selection. Honestly, just close your eyes, point to a menu item, and order whatever you pointed to (barring any allergies, of course).

We were okay with it but I wouldn't recommend Lincoln Tavern for a first date, or bringing grandma.Menu prices are veasonable, which was another attractive feature.My companion's entree was quite good - the buttermilk fried chicken, although she wished the sausage gravy have been served on the side.  The scalloped potatoes were to die for.My meal had promise, and the description sounded delicious, but it was overwhelmed and ruined by way too much salt.  A newer menu item, it's the maple brined pork chop.  While the sauce was tasty, and the large chop was served over wilted greens and gnocchi, sodium overpowered the entire dish.  (And I'm a person who really likes salt).  Unfortunate!  Because of the brine prep, the chefs would be wise to cut back on additional salt while preparing this.  Also, I discovered that the chop actually didn't have all that much meat on it - at least half was fat.But...really friendly waiter, good drinks, a lively neighborhood bar scene, and we would consider going back.

We should have known to leave when we went here at about 1pm on a weekday and there was only ONE other table occupied. Most other restaurants in downtown Atlanta are packed at this time with the lunch crowd. Second, you have to go up a creepy elevator to get upstairs to the restaurant. You feel like you're on a ride or part of a low-budget horror movie. The elevator only goes up...creepfest. Third, the menu is bland just like the food with few options, most of which are over $15 per entree. I stuck with the tacos to stay under $10, this is lunch! Oh yeah, and there is not a lunch menu so no breaks there. Four, they served chips with my meal, finally! BUT, no salsa. seriously? I then had to ask the waitress for some salsa, which I needed anyway to add to my dry tacos.

We used to always order the PuPu platter (and giggle every time), and it was spectacular. I'm not sure if the old management is back, but in the past year, I started visiting this quaint restaurant once again. I am now vegan, and I like to find normal restaurants that I can eat at normally (meaning, I don't want to just eat french fries). This wonderful restaurant catered to my needs splendidly.Usually, when I go in, the restaurant is nearly or completely empty. There is always soft classical music in the background, which sets a serene atmosphere. The inside has been decorated the same since I was little; nothing really has changed (even the plates seem the same!). Some may think that this makes the restaurant outdated, but to me, it gives me a bit of nostalgia.The service here can range from a bit pushy to sweet as can be. The older lady that works here I've known since I was little, and I know that she ranges more on the pushy side. If you take it in stride and realize that she's probably been working in this business for the longest time and has probably dealt with more than a few terrible customers, she's really not that bad. The pushiest I've gotten from her is when she seemed a little scared to let my boyfriend and I try the summer rolls, for fear that we wouldn't pay for them if we didn't like them (one, we would never do that, and two, they were extraordinary). So I assume that this has happened before.Both my boyfriend and I are vegan, and whenever we're in the mood for Chinese/Vietnamese food and are in the Orange City area, we go to Jade Garden. He too has been going there since he was younger, and he too ordered the PuPu platter. Nowadays, we go for something a bit more meat free. We've had many of their vegetarian items, and always order the summer rolls when we go now (we ask for tofu instead of the usual meat). When you get the peanut sauce for the rolls, ask for some hot sauce for a little bit of a kick. It's great, I promise. While we've had an amazing experience with their vegetarian menu, we usually order something off-menu now. If you're vegetarian or vegan, please please please ask for sesame tofu. It always comes with a crispy outside and delicious flavors. The price for this usually ranges from $11-13 (it's a really big plate; my boyfriend and I never finish it together), and it's because it's not on the menu and they don't always know how to price it. In summary, if you stopped visiting this restaurant like I did when they changed management, now is the time to go back and give them another chance."},{"name":"Cheese Bar","address":"6031 SE Belmont","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Overpriced for what you get.

We also had a couple bruschetta which were fun ways to start.I got the Mezzana spritzer #spritzerlife (it says that on the menu and my friends and I were dying of laughter about it) to start and it was great--the drinks were all really well garnished with beautiful mint and herbs. A great spot if you're looking for a cocktail.I got the Cacio e Pepe, my friend got the lobster pasta, and the other got the brick chicken. I loved my pasta--peppery, al dente, really good. The lobster pasta was good, but a little fishy for my taste. The brick chicken looked crispy and yummy, but the veggies it came with were basically garnishes. We all got a second drink-1 cocktail, 1 beer, and I had a great glass of red wine--nebbiola I believe, with dinner.We then split two desserts--a pear galette and an apple cider doughnut called a bombolina.

Other than that, the aesthetic is obviously just pleasing a very surface-level hipster crowd (nothing against hipsters, it's just apparent what Propagation was trying to go for). Stay away from this shop at all costs, ESPECIALLY if you're just browsing for furniture. They take chairs and tables very seriously, pricing some in ranges I can buy a whole room of furniture for. And they talk a lot about their clientele in New York and California; how about you focus on the city you're in rather than trying to please cities on opposite sides of the country as Orlando? If you're not going to focus on Orlando, get out of Orlando and live closer to your precious Californian clientele. Travis and Brittany, get a grip. You have a nice space in Orlando that many other businesses would love to use, but use it with Orlando in mind. Stop attacking others just because they don't agree whole-heartedly with your business idea--it's immature and portrays the experience in business-owning that you guys clearly lack.Update:\\nIt's fun to make you guys angry. I was hoping for a better response, but that'll do. THANK GOD THE COFFEE PART IS CLOSING! I see you guys aren't making enough money from your Californian clientele to keep buying coffee beans.

That ultimately was the reason why I ate here, but I ended up ordering the calamari due to my sister's request. Ah! Silly mistake. The calamari was mediocre at best. It was crunchy by not as crunchy as I like. It was just a tad bit soggy. The dip wasn't all that special either. I ordered the angel hair pasta with asparagus and salmon. The same dish served at WA Square's Nordstrom is better! The sauce was a bit bland not to mention milky (in appearance) and watery, not enough cheese. Some of the asparagus was too hard to chew.

I have never been more disappointed in a restaurant in all my years in Atlanta. I have sat outside multiple restaurants and have never encountered the bug problem I did tonight. I was sat next to an area that has obviously been prone to bugs as the waiter said nothing when my friend put her bags down. The gentleman next to us was the one who noticed bugs all over her bag and when I looked down there was one in my lap. They tried to tell us they were waterbugs when it was obviously cockroaches and no body of water in sight for it to be considered waterbugs. When I asked for a free shot for our troubles he went and got the manager to talk it through which took another 25 minutes. She denied us the shot but tried to bring us out a dessert to compensate when I told her multiple times I was not interested in eating there after I had to move my chair to get away from the 20 cockroaches I did see. She told me it was my fault as I was the one who chose to sit outside. I have never dealt with a more unconcerned staff when it comes to customer service at a restaurant in my life. They are the ones who chose to line there patio with tables when they are well aware they have a bug issue and then continue to blame the customer. I was appalled when I left and they still charged me the full amount for my two drinks. I repeat They still charged me FULL PRICE for my 2 drinks. l then had another server bring me my check because they would not face me. I was nothing but respectful when trying to sort out the issue. She took it upon herself to think ice cream would fix the fact that I had a cockroach in my lap at the beginning of my meal. I am absolutely disgusted with how the whole situation was handled and I will NEVER be returning to Rosa Mexicana. I work within Atlantic station at a boutique as I told her and am usually a regular customer which she did not seem to care about.

This Antico has tons of seating, nobody ogling you, and they actually sell beer, wine and cocktails here! Although your choices are limited on the drinks, but heck, I don't have to worry about dragging my bottle of wine here! A plus for me!

We had to wait a really long time for our drinks to come and then we had our drinks for over a half an hour before any food came. I'm a light weight drinker so this is not ok. Bread and butter don't cut it no matter how many times more is brought out.  I want real food. And I want to savor my wine with my food, not drink it on an empty stomach for 45 minutes. We had a question for the kitchen regarding substitutions for my husband who is lactose intolerant (he can do butter but not cheese/cow's milk). After ten minutes, they still hadn't come out to answer our question. So I had to call the server over to take our order without having the question answered. I guess a restaurant that is intolerant to substitutions is not the right fit for us. I can't help but compare our experience to another one we had at a five star Peruvian restaurant in town. There we felt like a king and queen. At Little Bird we felt very unimportant.

We ordered the Mag Mud, Hot Sauce and Chips. It had a lot less black beans than I thought it would have, but.. it was still cheesy, spicy crack in a bowl. Yum.I got the Club Sandwich, and I thought it could have been better. It had ham, turkey, bacon (how can you go wrong with bacon?), and tomato. I didn't taste much mayo on the sandwich, and the cheese was a bit bland. The first piece of sandwich was AWESOME but as it cooled down a bit, the flavor went south too. Oh well, it's hit and miss right?Hubby got the fish tacos and he HATED THEM. But I liked them well enough. The tacos weren't coated in anything, so the texture suffered. It was slightly slimy. But the flavors were excellent. Perhaps they should coat the fish in something like panko or cornmeal to give the dish more texture?MiL got the Magnolia Enchiladas which were SO GOOD. Seriously delicious. Avocados, queso on top, it was divine. The rice and beans alongside were great too.For desert we tried a slice of the peanut butter pie and the Mocha Float, which incidentally tastes like heaven itself if you dunk pieces of the pie into the float, just sayin'. There's lots more I want to try on the menu- the Club Sammie has been my first slight disappointment. But I will be back!

The first thing I noticed was how run down and dirty-looking the place seemed.  The second thing was the smell or rather lack of it. It is odd to walk into a restaurant and not smell any food cooking, even though there are several tables with diners and food.  The service was, well, awkward might best describe it.  We were in the mood for pizza, so we ordered a large salad to share with a large pizza (two of us).  We didn't really want one of their meat pizzas, so we ordered the vegetarian, with some modifications (left off the zucchini), including asking that they use mozzarella instead of feta after learning that their usual pizza comes with feta only.  The salad was OK tasting, not great, but we were hungry and scarfed it down quickly (probably a mistake) while listening to people at the next table speculate on how long the lasagna had been microwaved and whether it might not have been better to just go to the Olive Garden.  As soon as the pizza arrived it was clear that everyone eating at Cafe Allegro would have been better off had they gone to the Olive Garden.  The pizza smelled rancid.  We each took a couple of bites and stopped eating.  The waiter never asked us if anything was wrong with the food, he just put it in a box.  We were going to give some to our dogs, but thought better of it and just tossed the box in a dumpster on the way to the car.  We attempted to obliterate the bad experience by immediately going to dinner at a different restaurant.  It was too late, however, as we were both sick (upset stomach, nausea and then later, diarrhea) within a few hours.

First time was a late night with live music & a sparse crowd with one or two really drunk patrons. The night was okay, but honestly the only thing that made it okay was the musician who was very friendly & entertaining. The bartender was a little frazzled from a loud mouthed drunken patron yelling at her so the drinks were sub par. I can't blame her on that. I even bought her a shot to help calm her nerves. 2nd time here was during a packed Thursday night football game night. From that description one would think it would be slightly better. On the contrary, it was worse. There weren't nearly enough servers & it took our waitress over 20 minutes to get to us. No joke, it was nearly half time in the football game when she came & my party & I were there since the first snap. I also noticed it wasn't just our table. 2 other tables were complaining due the lack service. Poor service & poor management on having so few attentive servers on such a packed Thursday night. The waitress was in such a hurry she didn't even I.d members of my party before she served us drinks. After 20+ minutes we finally ordered & 10-15 minutes later our drinks came. Image eating a plate of salty fries with no drink. Good thing I wasn't THAT thirsty. Geez. I even had to get up and physically find my waitress to pay the tab for the table. I enjoy east Atlanta village very much & come here often to go to the bars and 'clubs' that they have. Unfortunately I will not be back to the Elder Tree & will not recommend it to anyone.

More than $24 for a 12\\" pizza, and $8 for mozzarella sticks, which is what I would expect to pay at a nice italian restaurant for an appetizer, not a dump like this place.The mozzarella sticks came out first and they were quite obviously simple freezer food.  They came out in a basket with tortilla chips. Why, you ask?  I have no idea, but the chips were burnt and I wasn't about to try them.  The marinara sauce that came with the mozzarella sticks had clearly just come out of the refrigerator, could they seriously not heat it up?  Who wants to dip cheese sticks in cold sauce?The pizza arrived shortly thereafter, and it was without a doubt the worst pizza I have ever tasted.  The crust and sauce were nothing special, and the pizza smelled.  I can't quite put my finger on what the smell was, maybe garbage or something rancid, but you couldn't get past it, it was disgusting.After nibbling on some food, we took my son to play on the play structure, which is ok, but nothing horribly impressive.  The play structure is made out of hollow plastic pieces similar to a Little Tikes play structure, it quite obviously couldn't support the weight of my husband or I assisting my two year old son through the play area.  The only thing that makes this place worth visiting is the mini ferris wheel, which was quite entertaining, my son loved it.  The worst part of our experience was that while my son was playing, we had left about 3/4 of our pizza and the drinks and mozzarella sticks on our table, and someone had come by and cleared our table without even asking if we had finished!  I most certainly wasn't going to take the disgusting food home, but seriously?  You're going to throw away my $38 meal when it's not even halfway gone?  Did you seriously think I was going to spend $38 on a meal and not even eat half of it? That's just horrendous customer service; my son hadn't even had half of his milk.  We thought about complaining, but we were all exhausted and just done with this place.  Bottom note, save the money and go to Out of This World Pizza.

The chicken was good even without the BBQ sauce, though I would have preferred a few more spices/herbs in it. The sampler platter was okay, nothing mind-blowing. The mac n cheese was super tasty - you could feel your heart exploding whilst eating it. The mashed potatoes were sub par in my opinion. It would have been nice if cornbread came with your order...

The food has gone downhill over the years, sure, but management continues also to get increasingly more pigheaded and disdainful in terms of customer service. First, they are militant about not taking Favor orders (one of about 5 of Austin's thousands of restaurants who wont). Okay, whatever, lose out on the thousands of dollars Kerbey Lane rakes in each week off of Favor orders. But tonight I came in after finishing my Favor shift. Still had my shirt on. I was aggressively snapped and snarled at by 3 different wait people, \\"Is that for YOU???\\". The question is understandable because they hate Favor, but the attitude was frigging offensive. To their credit, 2 of the freaked-out waitstaff were very friendly once I passed security clearance. Other non-sensical rules. Tried to call my order in and was denied. \\"Too busy tonight, but you can come in and order to go.\\" I was 3 minutes away. When I got there there were only 3 small parties waiting, and that was only because they didn't want to sit outside where there were some empty tables. Only 2 of the 5 counter stools were occupied. It was probably the least crowded I've ever seen the place. Regardless, please explain to me the difference between a to-go order over the phone and one in person??? The difference between the jerks that run this place and any other restaurant is the only answer. I guess when you own a goldmine, you can be contemptuous of the gold miners. Finally, a 75-cent to-go fee sucks. Recoup the 10 cents the Styrofoam container costs you, if you must, but charging that much, again, is contemptuous of the customer. Is my money any less valuable in your bank account than if I stayed there to eat? No, it would cost you more if I stayed, in terms of waitstaff and other customers waiting for a table. Totally screwed priorities. I've been going to Magnolia since they first opened 30ish years ago, but I'm through giving them my money.

Let me start out with the bread- disgusting. It wasn't your typical Italian bread. It lacked flavor and tasted more like a dry biscuit. It also came with no butter, only the oil (plain oil) served on the table. We then ordered the fried calamari- it was ok, but I've had better. Next, we ordered the caesar and beet salads. My friends were not impressed with the beet salad and my caesar salad dressing lacked flavor. Finally, we move on to the entrees and they were the worse! I ordered the eggplant parm with angel hair pasta- AGAIN, what is wrong with the place lacking flavor in ALL of these dishes?!!! The angel hair pasta barely had any sauce and the eggplant was just awful. My friends who ordered the butternut squash ravioli's also complained of lack of flavor and couldn't even taste the squash because they were overwhelmed with the amount of oil these were smothered in. So, now the waiter, Nick comes over and we inform him that we were very disappointed with our meals and he immediately apologizes and informs us he was going to \\"see what he could do\\" and he didn't return for about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, we watch him attending to his other costumers. At this time it wasn't even busy and his attention should have been on us. So, finally he comes over and asked us if we wished to get any desert, which we declined and now hands us a bill and informs us that there is a survey for us to take for the feedback. NOTHING on our bill was compted. NOT even our salads, or appetizer. NOTHING. So, of course we filled out the survey which I highly doubt will ever make it to management.

The calamari comes with a white sauce and a really, really spicy red sauce. It's battered in a tempura batter and seasoned. It is cooked perfectly. Almost melts in your mouth, not chewy at all. My friend also got the pulled pork poutine. All of it was so good. Not a single complaint!You can sit outside on the deck, inside or on a covered patio, but they have all of the windows open so it is almost like sitting outside. We sat on the covered patio at the bar as there was a bit of a wait to sit out on the patio. The service is prompt, the servers are so awesome and fun! The food comes without much of a wait. Even the other patrons there are super nice and we struck up conversations with people all around the bar. The prices are good, a little on the pricy side but nothing absurd.

It is by no means the worst in town, but the two stars reflect both what the dining experience *should* be, as well as the tiny portions and comparative expensiveness of what you end up getting.Nearly everything I've sampled here is, well, simply bland, and it doesn't appear to be improving.  The only thing consistently right appears to be the oyster tostadas, but those are a direct ripoff of a Jeffrey's dish he's had at least a decade to perfect.  On a good night, the lamb pops are great; on a bad night, they're chewier than bubble gum.I also have to question the entire concept itself.  An upscale restaurant serving literally no entrees besides tacos??

The one serving us broke my waffle cone in the process of filling it and automatically gave us a discount for it. Definitely appreciated!

Then it started going down hill...we ordered a glass of wine, to which our server disappeared for 30 minutes or so, before I kindly asked for him to check with the bar for the wine. About 15 minutes later, the wine finally arrived...minus any apology. Guess they had to go out to Napa Valley to get it...The NY Strip was a great cut, but illfully prepared. Virtually no flavor, but I cannot complain about the temperature or tenderness. Cooked a perfect medium and a had no problem cutting through it.The NYO Mac & Cheese is probably the feature dish of the night. It has a great bread crumb crust and some great texture and flavor.We had finished our meals and our server was nowhere in sight. (I guess somebody else ordered a glass of wine that he had to go to Napa Valley to get.) We sat, and sat with our plates in front of us, when finally a server in another section asked if she could box up our leftovers and clear our plates. Props to her!Finally our server arrived with the check, no wine on the check - yet still no apology either. I simply assumed that he owned up to his mistake and just pulled the wine off the check out of good gesture...silly me. Server returns with the check and apologizes, \\"I added the wine to your check since I forgot to ring it in.\\"Really dude? I'm not asking for the wine for free, but you don't apologize for forgetting the wine in the first place, which you so clearly did, nor do you apologize for your mistake with the check, then you just go ahead and charge it without even bringing it to my attention first.

Cheapest bottle of wine was $35, which seemed out of line.

I've visited this Tin Lizzy's numerous times over the past 10 years with no problem.Recently, their team allowed someone to come into their establishment and ask for money. An individual needed to pay a bill and wandered in to my table. The manager and the bartenders all saw this happening and didn't step in. I made eye contact with both bartenders on staff. Instead they watched as this individual continued asking our table for money. I saw the manager walk past twice, aimlessly roaming, stand in the corner for around 5 minutes while this person relayed their issue and asked for money. The manager did nothing. However when this individual went to another table, which happened to have Caucasian males like himself, he then chose to step in and ask the individual to leave. He made no effort to come to our table and acknowledge that it was inappropriate. There was no apology or acknowledgement that this person shouldn't have bypassed the host stand. I would understand if it was super busy and this happened to catch his eye after checking tables. It wasn't. Maximum 4 tables in the front were occupied with maybe 2-4 people at the bar. Multiple staff members were watching and did nothing. If this isn't allowed at Tin Lizzy's, the manager shouldn't have allowed it to happen to anyone.

He loved his steak - it was cooked perfectly.  Hubby ended his meal with creme brulee.  He wouldn't let me try it, so it must have been good.I started with a half portion of the pumpkin bisque (sans bacon topping for this vegetarian).  It was DIVINE.  Rich, creamy and not overly-pumpkiny, with cinnamon on top.  I should've gotten a full portion.  Then I had the vegetable strudel (I know...two appetizers.  But I just couldn't help myself).  It was puff pastry filled with cauliflower, broccoli, and carrots, served with a cream sauce.  Again, delicious.  My main course was the legumes - a plate of assorted small bites.  It was an interesting combination - creamed spinach, sweet potato and parsnip pie, fennel and leeks, and slaw.  Dessert was bread pudding.  Yum.

We had to ask for bread/biscuits after we saw other tables getting it with their drinks. It seemed like a very long wait between our appetizer and dinner.

I would eat there more if I was, like, in my early twenties or late teens. Sinfully tasty but whenever I eat there I'm kind of stuffy around the gills for the rest of the day. I think for me it's the flour they use. Very refined and probably not GMO free. I'm getting more and more concerned about seeking out GMO free flour. Contrary to what most people think, I feel that Monsanto's Round Up is worse for people's health than refined gluten. Yes, that's right: on most GMO crops Round Up is used twice: once for spraying weeds as the wheat grows and then dreadfully right before the wheat is stored after it has been harvested. Round Up is sprayed on the grain as a desiccant which is just plain criminal. It's like soaking Round Up right into the grain. I can't think of anything worse for people. To me, it smacks of eugenics rather than mere convenience. When I eat the biscuits at Pine Street, I think of these things. Why? Because after I eat them, I feel as if I've done something very unhealthy but very very delicious.If Pine Street is GMO Free, then please accept my apologies.

We shared bowls of red salsa, queso, and fried jalapenos. The salsa was okay, definitely spicy but not enough flavor; the queso was melted cheese and in my book there is nothing wrong with melted cheese EVER; and the fried jalapenos were so good I would have ordered another basket if my old lady heart and digestive system could have taken it. The fried jalapenos were served with the spiciest ranch dressing I've ever had, and I liked it...a lot. We also had tacos. One of my friends only eats ground beef in his tacos (who knows why), and they made special tacos for him because they only have one taco with ground beef and he didn't want that one, and he very much enjoyed his special tacos. The other female in the group ordered the BBQ quesadilla and she liked it (even though I was doubtful about that goat cheese). I had the Asian pork taco which was delicious and the Santa Fe steak taco, which is my favorite Tin Lizzy's taco. We shared two pitchers of the \\"Fall Off the House\\" margaritas. In a single serving, this margarita has enough liquor content to make a leprechaun look like an angel, but in a pitcher it merely gives you a buzz. Which is likely a good thing since we cleared two of them. We sat on the patio and they turned on heaters over the top which kept us toasty and as the night wore on, more people came out. I can't wait to chill on this patio in the summer. Initially, we were the first people out on the patio, so no one came out to serve us. I had to go back to the front and have them send someone out. But once she got going, our server was great, very attentive (I think the guy in our group was why), and the manager came out and did a round to check on everyone. This is a good place to grab a drink, quick meal, and just chill. I imagine it will also be great for people watching once the weather warms up.

The chicken was spiced perfectly and was crispy even with the sauce.  It came with a hard boiled egg and a sunnyside up egg, which I stirred well into my rice.  Yum.  The serving size was perfect so I didn't have any leftovers.  My husband had the french toast which was topped with blueberry syrup and whipped cream.  I didn't try it but my hubby liked it.  The atmosphere felt upbeat and so were the staff.  Our server made sure we had a pleasant experience.   We had a nice leisurely brunch while listening to top 40 music playing in the background.  I will definitely be back whenever I am in the area."},{"name":"Garrido's","address":"360 Nueces St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm a huge fan of Garridos! I actually enjoy their food and service more than I do Manuels, which I would say is one of their main competitors downtown. I ended up having a groupon for the resturant for $25 dollars and decided to take a friend with me. We ended up going towards the end of their lunch. They have a special where you get your app, main entree, and dessert for a reasonable price! It was about $15 per person and with everything together it was a great portion. The app for the plate was a bit small in my opinion but with everything it was fine. I ended up ordering the Chicken Enchilada with Habanero cream sauce it was DELICIOUS! The sauce was not crazy hot at all and  you had that beautiful flaver for a jalepeno pepper. The dessert was great, flavorful, and just enough after the main dish. We also go several margaritas which we GREEEEAAAAT!!! A bit on the pricer end but they were nice, strong, and frozen. What really seperates this place for Manuels was the service we had. The guy was not just flippin sexy but he was an awesome server. He went above and beyond for my friend and myself. Even the manager of the resturant did rounds of the tables to make sure everything was spectacular. Service was on point for the day and you guys deserve the 5 stars. I'm extremely impress and will continue to come back."},{"name":"Thai Pasta Cuisine","address":"11461 SW Scholls Ferry Rd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"The best Thai restaurant I have had so far in beaverton.

First the good things, my \\"drink of the day\\" was very good.  The bread brought to the table after we received our drinks was delicious.  Now for the not so good things.  We asked the waitress how the pizza was and she said it had been voted one of the best in Boston.  We ordered the margarita pizza which has fresh basil, cheese and usually just tomato.  If this had been February and basil was not in season, I could have understood the fact that there was three pieces of basil on the whole pizza.  Seeing how it is June and basil is plentiful, this was a little disappointing.  The crust was SO THIN that when you picked up a piece the cheese and sauce slid off onto the plate.  Clearly, not the best pizza in Boston, far from it.  After reading the other reviews it seems that a burger would have been a better option.  Probably won't go back."},{"name":"Jake n JOES Sports Grille - Waltham","address":"70 Market Place Dr","city":"Waltham","stars":"3","text":"Bill H.\\nHad the New Yorker tonight touted as tender.

The chicken wings are awesome! They have hand cut fries, make sure you try the house made fry sauce, it has horseradish in it and is very good. The house soup is a cream of asparagus with dungeness crab, and it is delightful.Happy hour goes from 3-7 every day with great food and drink specials. Wells are $2.50, any one of their draft micros are $3.50 pints (they have 8 rotating taps that feature Oregon craft beer, ask to see \\"the beer book\\" for recommendations and tasting notes from us locals). On Fridays they have a free buffet with the happy hour drinks, always has the awesome fried chicken, a rotating pasta dish ( the meatballs and cream sauce is my favorite) and chips and salsa, so if you're there on Friday, definitely ask for a plate!On lunch, they have daily specials that are $5-6, it's usually a sandwich or wrap and a side.

My husband is a fan of La Sirenita, he goes there often but I have yet to go as from what I hear they do not have many veggie options at all.  In yet another attempt to find the perfect Mexican restaurant we gave Pepino's a try and well, hurray.....we liked it!  Pepino's has tons of veggie options which makes me quite happy.  The menu clearly highlights which dishes are vegetarian.  Very cool.  Plus, most dishes have two size options: chica (some say chico) and grande.  Also very cool, I am all about ordering the smaller portions if possible.  Now, the food is not fancy at all which can be either a good thing or a bad thing depending on the restaurant.  With Pepino's it is a good thing....good food (not great), basic ingredients, and extremely inexpensive.  All of those things add up to Nik Z being very happy.The menu has very basic typical options: tacos, quesadillas, burritos, enchilada, fajitas, and taquitos.  Meat options are basic: chicken, steak, carnitas, and I believe they have fish also.  Most items can also be ordered with veggies and they also have tofu.  This is the perfect place for my husband and I as he is a total carnivore.We ordered a lot of food and the bill only came to $15 which we found to be hilarious.  I got the Quesadilla Chica which was a smaller sized flour tortilla with cheese and salsa.  Very basic and quite small and under $3!  I also got the Tostada Salad  which had lettuce, black beans, cheese, salsa and guacamole which was under $5.  Everything was delicious.  I had asked for the guacamole on the side as I hate it and Paul loves it.  I didn't end up seeing the guacamole, I think they forgot it but whatever....everything was quite good and quite fresh.  I also ordered a side of rice and vegetarian refried beans for us to share which was very good.  Super basic, no frills but I enjoyed it.  Paul ordered the #4 special: taco and a quesadilla.  He got the steak taco and a chicken quesadilla, both of which he enjoyed.  He said everything was quite good and that he would go there again.  The portions were all small but quite filling.

She told me I could wait in the bar or near the elevators and they would find us once a table was available.

When ended up heading to the bar and waiting to grab a table with a view.  That actually worked out and we were able to secure one overlooking the festival.  I told our waitress to cancel the dining room reservation as this would suit our needs.  We ended up having a great time in the bar and PCG lost out on a table that would have probably cost 4 times as much in the dining room versus the happy hour food we ordered.

Did not have food so I cannot comment, though I have heard tell of uber cheap ladies night entrees which may sway me.First time I went in for drinks with a friend we grabbed beers for a few minutes because that's the only time we had.  On first impression, the talent (aka men) was good and we were outnumbered.  Looked posh but casually so so we were able to be comfortable.  Needs more seating, or at least space to put your drinks.  Very crowded.  *   *   *Second time my friend and I showed up at 12:30 and the bouncer wasn't going to let us in, not because it was too crowded or they're exclusive but because last call is apparently at  12:30 and they close at 1.  What?  We worked some magic and got in but it was desolate.  Kind of sad.  No talent left.  If that had been my only experience there I would never have gone back, but my prior experience had shown me that this place had promise.  It's really the decor more than anything that makes the place look, well...hot.  Left in 15 minutes without even buying drinks.*   *   *Third time I actually got to sit down with two friends and enjoy some serious drinks.  The place was crowded, but not super crowded, which is how I like it...and yet it seemed too crowded because they just do not have enough seating or bar surface to stand at.  Had to race some guy to get a table, and then we laid claim for the rest of the evening like it was a fortress.  Stalls in the women's room are pitiful - there's no room to pull down your whatnots without them touching the underside of the toilet which grosses me out because stuff gets on undersides of toilets - why can't they just have one human-sized stall instead of two half-midget sized stalls?  Male talent was lame despite the large crowd.   I would not recommend coming here to meet members of the opposite sex (at least if you have a vagina, though this could possibly go for the penis-endowed, as well) - I get the very strange sense that this place is generally the \\"before party.\\"  We actually got a few creepy guys ogling though it didn't seem the place for that - and not in the creepy old man leering in the corner kind of way so much as the cocky jerk kind of way.  Eurotrash.  Definitely some Eurotrash floating around, including a pony-tailed guy pimping it with four beautiful Latin women dressed in cocktail dresses that looked more like designer lingerie.  Strange.  One Eurotrash guy with slicked back blonde hair (ew, not attractive) at the table over with two women (I could not figure out how these three people were related to each other) was staring at my friends really obviously and I commented really loudly but that didn't stop him.Granted, my friends were a pair of blonde identical twins with really good bodies.That said, fair for people watching.  It seems people take other people on dates here when they're trying really hard to impress them in order to get laid.  My friends and I took wagers on one couple.  I lost.  She seemed so disinterested all night and then went home with the guy after all.  Fair enough though - he was the only decent looking male in the place.The mixed drinks were decent.  Not worth raving about, but decent.  Don't know if I'd want to spend $12 a martini on just decent.  But the ambiance of the place is phenomenal.  You feel cool by being there just because the place looks so damn cool.  Maybe that's why it seems to attract the crowd that's there - they're not uber cool so they want to get cool by osmosis.  The kind of people who care about being somewhere that seems posh rather than somewhere that actually has anything all that special to offer.  Superficial like a lot of the clubs in Europe, Miami and Mexico, only this couldn't even compete with a European, Miamian or Mexican club - not even a lounge in any of those places, frankly.  It tries, though, which is more than I can say for most of Boston so kudos for that.Service sucked.  Mainly because they don't have enough people working tables.  Our waitress tried her best so we tipped well anyway.  And the poor thing was so skinny, but they put their waitresses in these unflattering clingy dresses that don't look good on anyone.so...overall opinion: less hacked then Foundation Lounge (which looks to me like a giant Bar Mitzvah), the closest I've found in Boston to real nightlife atmosphere in other cities that actually have nightlife, but the key word here is \\"atmosphere\\" rather than \\"real nightlife\\" ... if you catch my drift.  That said, I'll be back, because I'm one of those people who likes to feel cool by osmosis, too.

Neptune really makes you want to live it up. Love the well constructed space with the beautiful bar seating. Space is at a premium and I liked how they tucked the bottles of wine wherever they could. You will be right on top of your neighbors so be prepared for buts in your faces when people get up, and eavesdropping over the interesting conversations next to you. I don't order a lot of wine by the bottle just because I'm mostly a cheapskate and want to spend more of my money on food :-). Still, if I'm back at Neptune I will order a nice bottle of white wine because it really goes well with the experience. We started with briny, fresh raw oysters. The menu gives you good guidance as far as size and salinity. I enjoyed the cocktail sauce more than the mignonette but that's just personal preference and how I've always eaten them. Next was the star of the show:  the johnnycake. Oh yes, probably my favorite thing I ate while in Boston. The corncake had a perfect texture of softness, crispness, stickiness- just wonderful. The smoked trout and sturgeon caviar added saltiness and there was sweetness in the buttery sauce. Delectable. Mains were strong as well. The hot lobster roll was just about ideal - good size, buttery. Bread was fine. I think it barely missed perfection possibly just needing a  whisp of added salt or a splash of lemon. Still very good. Then, against all better judgement at a seafood joint- we ordered a Neptuneburger which will live in infamy as one of my favorite burgers. It's a hot mess with cheese and some fried oysters and I know not what else, but GLORIOUS smoky flavor to the meat, and it was juicy, fatty and fantastic. My son and I traded meals as we each liked the other's selection better so I got to polish off half the burger. Outstanding. Highly recommended, and I'll dream of all the possibilities for my next visit whenever that may be."},{"name":"Italian Kitchen","address":"860 Burrard St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"We came today on a Friday evening (night of the U2 concert) and had an absolutely wonderful time! They seated us by the window upstairs and when the sun was shining a little too much, our server lowered the blinds as much as she could, which we appreciated. What we also liked was that the restaurant manager came around to the tables to introduce himself and he was very genuine and chatted us up to make sure our dinner went smoothly. The service was impeccable, we were amazed!With the food, my absolute FAVOURITE dish here is the caprese salad!!! Okay I know you're thinking - caprese salad is just tomatoes and basil, and you're right, it's not exactly worth $16.98 for tomatoes but they add a huge dollop of fresh gooey soft pasteurized burrata cheese with basil and it is just DIVINE!! With some fresh cracked pepper added in by the server and your life will change! The taste and flavour of the dish is worth the price tag for me despite knowing it's just tomatoes. I still order each time I come here so that's saying something!We also ordered their signature truffled spaghetti and meatballs (apparently world famous), and their linguine carbonara. For those watching their sodium intake, do not order the carbonara as this is very salty due to the pancetta; this is not the restaurants fault but they should use less pancetta maybe? The carbonara sauce was creamy due to the yolks, very good texture despite the saltiness. We always enjoy the truffled spaghetti but this time the meatballs were super dry and bland, a bit of a disappointment.Overall a great meal and we'd come again definitely for their outstanding service and amazing caprese salad!"},{"name":"Anmol","address":"258 Rantoul St","city":"Beverly","stars":"4.5","text":"Garlic Chicken Nann.

The party was for a group of 16 people, and we originally spoke to Gurpreet. We told him it was a birthday party and he failed to inform us that :1. They would be providing us with a \\"minimized menu\\" vs. the regular full dinner menu\\n2. They don't allow parties to serve/eat birthday cake unless it is purchased from the restaurantOur reservation was for 8:15, when we arrived at 8:06 there were about 7 of us and they told us they were setting up our table.... we were finally seated at 8:40.Our server, Nikki - was fricken awesome! She was friendly and attentive and even though there was going to be an 18% autogratuity she still treated us like clients and  earned the gratuity. The whole time she was following up and making sure that our glasses were full and checking in to see if we needed anything. She even picked up someone's jacket that had fallen on the floor. I can honestly say that Nikki was the ONLY reason we didn't get up and leave half way through the meal. My boyfriend and I ordered:1. Bruschetta Sampler - this came with 3 different types of toppings (chick pea mix, veggies, and some pesto bocconcini) the bread was hard, and everything was cold. It tasted like it had been sitting out for 20 minutes and then quickly reheated before it was served to us.2. Calamari - we requested for this to be EXTRA CRISPY, Nikki wrote it down and put through the request. We had 3 different people order the Calamari at our table so when we all got our orders, we compared ours to the other 2 to see if it was actually extra crispy. It was slightly darker and more well done that the others but it was still soft, and soggy. SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!3. Garganelli Pollo - I'm not sure if this was actually pasta or DOG FOOD. The pasta was undercooked, and hard - the sun dried tomatoes were flavourless and looked old. The chicken was terrible  - dry and cold. Some of the other people at our table ordered  pizzas, steak, and the Fuscilli Lunghi (pasta).The steak was the only decent item... the pizzas were cold and hard.The people that brought out our food; WORST ATTITUDES EVER! When we asked one of the female servers (NOT NIKKI) if the first order of calamari out was the EXTRA CRISPY order - she gave us a blank stare and said \\"this is the first order\\". She didn't even acknowledge our question and then gave us a completely irrelevant answer. Are you kidding me?It's ironic because you would think that a place that serves ITALIAN cuisine, would get the pastas and pizza right. OH! and by the way, the WHOLE restaurant has 2 washrooms for MEN and WOMEN. so you can only have 2 men or 2 women using the washroom at one time. The restaurant is 2 floors. WHO designed this?I had heard great things about Italian Kitchen through word of mouth, (I heard a few negative things too) but the reviews online were pretty descent so we decided to give it a shot.Conclusion: COLD COLD COLD TASTELESS FOOD.At the end of the evening, I ended up giving Nikki a tip on top of the autogratuity because she provided excellent service considering how large the party was. I let her know how horrible my experience was and she brought over the manager Sean who spoke to us and made an effort to apologize. I can appreciate that he welcomed our feedback but his solution was to give us his business card and offer to make things right the next time we decided to try a Glowbal Group restaurant. There is obviously a disconnect between the management staff here because Gurpreet had failed to let us know the information that was relevant to our party reservation, and then Sean was stuck having to try and explain things and pick up the pieces after the fact.I am so turned off at this point I don't think I am willing to try any Glowbal Group restaurant any time soon. It's too bad that Glowbal Group does such a great job at trying to convey a certain standard but doesn't live up to it."},{"name":"Viva Mi Arepa","address":"5197 Washington St","city":"West Roxbury","stars":"4","text":"Viva Mi Arepa was my introduction to Venezuelan food, and it was an awesome first impression.

I have NEVER EVER had such a horrible experience eating out at a restaurant. We are regular customers, come here often. the first few times we came here is was ok, they have made mistakes on our order. We have spoke with manager she apologized and ressolved the issue. It seems like Sunday's they are extremely busy can't handle work load. We walked inside and was told there was 1hr hold. That was fine we then come back. Placed our order with the waitress, she of course took ticket to the back, then she walks up to us and tells us she ran out shrimp, we said ok cool we'll have fish and explained how we would like for it to be prepared. The food then comes out it's opposite of what we asked for. We didn't ask for eggs yet they managed to put eggs in our plate. We then had to call waitress she apologized and claim she gave them the ticket they made a mistake because they are swamped with orders and she would get it fixed. There was no utensils at our table, so we had to ask waitress to bring us some. When the food came our second time it looked as if it was just slapped on plate. My friend notice this waitress working and politely ask for a menu. Few minutes later this cook walks up to us asking \\" what's going on\\" I was under they impression he was going to apologize about what occurred. NOPE! He comes out and says \\" you see that girl that's my 14 year old daughter you will not talk to her like that!\\" I'm lost for words we asked what was said to her we simply asked for a menu.

He says \\" you will not talk to my daughter like that don't worry about paying for breakfast today I'll cover it and don't come back\\" I'm still trying to process everything my jaws just dropped. Like we aren't animals and will not take your food even if it was free you don't talk to anyone like that. So I was asking who this guy was I'm guessing he is one of the owner. Then my friend ask to speak to the so called woman owner thinking she would be rational nope she was no different she acted like an uneducated, unprofessional animal. She comes out and says \\" that was my husband, and that was my 14 year old daughter you will not talk to her like that. Your never happy, you don't have to come back. We have over 400 orders can't always get all orders right...I still don't see why it's ok for our order to have significant error because of this.  As we try to have a conversation explaininng to her what occurred. She was not trying to hear anything she told us to leave her primises and not to come back. Their daughters is a pathetic LIAR!! the waitesss was shocked herself because she seen what occurred and knows. I wouldn't go back to this place if I was paid to, we were treated like animals. And this woman want to say \\" bye God bless\\" don't claim God your a devil. In addition when I first got there I ordered a beer I specifically asked for something sweet, she recommended this beer that was sweet yet when the beer came out it was very bitter.  She then said \\"I apologize we ran out of that sweet beer do you still want it\\" umm no I don't. She then recommend this drink that's lemon and has gen and soda in it. I said ok cool. She brings out this drink it tasted like perfume, had flowers in it very nice but it taste nothing like the lemon She recommend so I told her and she said \\" ohh I'm sorry we ran out of the lemon ingredient they didn't tell me until after.\\" I'm like ok.. so the entire time they have made numerous errors and the treat us like shit.

I wish I'd looked on here before venturing to try something new in the quest for above average pizza in SW Austin.  I guess I was on a high after several brilliant experiences trying new (to me) establishments around here (Wholly Bagel was excellent and Full English is a hidden gem!).  Plus I had a seemingly generous coupon for a free small signature pizza with the order of a large one.  May be just me, but I found the process of trying to order via the website confusing and difficult to customize, but it did enlighten me to the option of having the large pizza split down the middle so I was able to experience 2 specialty pizzas within one pie.  So I called the order in, mentioned the coupon and waited for the total.  An x-large pizza, the small pizza and a small (side) salad was almost thirty bucks.  Fair enough I guess, but sure didn't seem like the coupon had been applied--of course it had though.  The window for delivery is kind of restrictive, so I opted to pick up--hadn't seen all the latest 'progress' over that way recently anyway.  I got there about 20-25 minutes after ordering and everything was ready, though--noting the first impression of face to face customer service--the Italian [?] guy at the counter who had the presence of being a manager or owner was at once rather gruff, even touching on rude.  For the record, the guy who'd taken my order on the phone was very calmly polite and in person seemed to sense that the Italianish guy was oft-putting, so he over compensated with cool kindness.  Not an inviting first impression overall.Checking over my order, I noticed some items missing and asked about it.  The customer service dynamic described above was in play as they corrected the problem.  I could've sworn I'd read on their website or the truncated menu I received in the val-pak with the coupon that they made their salad dressings in-house, and I was very disappointed to realize--upon first glance--that the ranch dressing was of the oily & near inedible Sysco variety.  I am one of those Austinites that simply insists on freshly made buttermilk ranch as a side for my pizza, so this was a buzzkill.  After further review, I realized I had mixed up their menu in my cranium with that of Austin's Pizza around the way, who does indeed make their dressings from scratch.  Ah well--my fault on that one I guess.  One the upside, my first impression as I grabbed a small piece of the ZBQ on the drive home: the intention to detail and the quality of the ingredients.  I am an amateur connoisseur of BBQ pizzas and was immediately impressed.  Not sure how long my order had been ready, but the warmer they'd put it in had kept everything remarkably hot.  Supple real mozzarella cheese stretched with every bite, moist chunks of chicken tossed in the BBQ sauce, ample fresh red onion and cilantro and the unexpected element of [fresh-?] corn made for an above average BBQ pizza.  Pillowy, acceptable crust that could really shine with a little char to it.  Overall, a pretty good start.For the x-large, I chose the not too far off combination of the Italian on one side and the Tuscan on the other.  The Tuscan was a very well engineered combination of feta & mozzarella three types of mushrooms, caramelized onions and a hint of thyme.  I loved that the mushrooms--though skimpy for three types--seemed fresh and not overdone, but the onions would've been perfect a bit more on the al dente side.  The roasted garlic sauce and truffle oil were pretty much imperceptible, but a good effort nonetheless.  The Italian side of the pie was a blissful blend of Italian basics--black olives, ham, artichoke and tomato--and was quite nicely presented.  Hard not to enjoy food that looks so artful.  A really palatable flavour balance resulted in a comfort food-y satisfaction.  Some good fresh ranch would've really set it off.It's hard to rate places on Yelp without the option of half stars, but I have to go with the \\"A-OK\\" level of three.  May try them again, but not without a stop by Thundercloud for ranch and another 'generous' coupon to level out the negatives of this fledgling joint."},{"name":"La Grotta Ristorante Italiano","address":"2637 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"My favorite Italian restaurant!

Not only is it a gorgeous and comfortable space, the staff were incredibly knowledgable, attentive and passionate about their food and drink. The chef creates innovative and often times whimsical dishes that aren't typically seen in other Portland restaurants (ie. Blackberry bubbles with fresh goat milk custard and streusel, spot prawns served over hot river rocks with spruce, scallop crudo with watermelon water...this list goes on!) Their serving sizes are perfect for sharing as well.  I thought the most unique aspect of Muselet is that Oregon wines are at the forefront and their list is really impressive! We spoke with Ron (owner) and he expertly paired our wine with each course. He really knew the history of each wine as he shared special tasting notes and unique anecdotes with us. He told us that they were recently honored as one of the Top 100 Best Wine Restaurants of 2015 from Wine Enthusiast Magazine. Awesome!It is SO worth the jaunt down to the south waterfront. Note: The Growler Guys have a place right across the street for a nice pre or post Muselet brew. It was a magical meal! We will be back! Come here if you:\\n-Want refined food in a casual, beautiful atmosphere. They have a great patio area as well.\\n-Enjoy Oregon wine, Champagne and sparkling wines.\\n-Want to treat yourself or loved ones!\\n-Are looking for a unique happy hour.

Pho Pasteur is a very stereotypical Vietnamese restaurant.  Don't know if it was because of our large party but it took over 20 minutes for them to deliver our pho.  I ordered the #19 which was rare steak and well-done flank.  I specifically had asked for an XL size but they delivered me a L.  When I told them that they took it back, only to my dismay that the bowl size was legit the exact same dimensions as my friend who ordered a L.  At this point it was over 30 minutes since I sat down without food so I just took the L.The broth is ok with a solid umami flavor but tended to be a little too salty for my taste.  Noodles were on the softer side, with the meat having a nice chew to it.  The Pho itself is your typical Pho, nothing particularly too special about it.  Overall I would have to give this 2/5 mainly for the service.  Probably would not go back to this location given the plethora of other amazing Pho spots all over Boston.TLDR:\\nPho?: Yep!  Not the best Pho but if you are craving it immediately it isn't a bad option\\nService: Needs some improvement (No biggie though!)\\nSetting: Crowded area with small tables.

I had told my wife that I was somewhat nonplussed with the place on my maiden voyage, but I thought, to be fair, I'd give it another shot. Besides, maybe it was my mood that day...who knows?After this second attempt, I now realize that I wasn't as far off as I thought in my mediocre feeling about the place. We hit the place at peak dining hour on a Saturday and it was pretty darn dead. Dead enough that I've got that worried feeling in the pit of my stomach that I was witnessing something that was doomed to be a relic in the near future. Sort of like that feeling that you get driving by those roadside attractions out in the middle of nowhere as you're driving to and fro - that deep sadness that some poor person spent some cash to chase their dream, and it ain't gonna happen. Nonetheless, the server came by and then left and came by and left. I was starting to wonder if we smelled bad or something, alas, we were fresh as daisies. He just had this weird table persona that was non-commital - not bad service just sort of not sure that he was ready to serve us....strange. Anyhow, we finally ordered and I opted to try one of their sour beers (when in Rome, right?). Pretty quickly, the food arrived. My burger was so-so - wish it had a little bit more flavor. My wife's wedge salad was terrible and her beef stew soup tasted like it was of the Campbell's variety. My very young daughter wasn't eating her food, and I couldn't figure out why since she hadn't eaten much all day. I tasted her corn dog, and it was freaking awful. For Pete sake, how in the hell do you f**k up a corn dog?!?! I mean really, if your average toothless carnie can fry up some corn dog goodness, what in the hell went wrong here? The capper was my beer which showed up in a very small glass. While it was tasty, I kept suspiciously eyeing my glass in a stunned sort of manner trying to understand how a such a small glass of beer could remain so expensive ($6+). I understand that it's handcrafted, yada yada yada....still, WTF? For that price, it better be the one of the best beers I've had. While good, it was far from that category. Sure, Cascade Brewing made it right there...so on and so forth. Then it should be cheaper to walk it right upstairs, right? NOTE TO MANAGEMENT: Seriously, don't be so cheap with your brew. What are you gonna do with all of the beer that you're clearly not serving - save it for a rainy day? Come on. Ditch the cute little snifter glasses and don't be shy with the pour.

So VERY happy that I did!  \\nI may go every stinking Wednesday from now until the end of time.  1/2 off all tapas?!?!  Ok, sold.  Especially since every single tapa I shoved in my mouth was so flavorful and savory.  The lamb sliders, mozz & tomato, avoacado cheese thing were so scrumptious.  I really have to give extra praise to the lamb sliders.  I can't even believe this is a tapa because you get two sliders that are pretty decent size.  And since it was 1/2 off it was only $5.  $5!!  I felt like I was robbing them.  \\nAnyway, I just want to apologize to Barcelona for ignoring them for so long.  Please forgive me.

I'm learning that everyone makes their chowder differently so my critique is simply my opinion and not a reflection on the quality of their chowder.LOVED LOVED LOVED the mussels.

It wasn't busy and I was the only patron, so why didn't I get a fresh pattie on the grill? Secondly, I noticed the cook wiping out the refrigerator wells of the toppings and condiments with the same gloves on, wiping the burger prep area with the same wet and filthy towel, and he's going back and forth cooking my already cooked burger.  I noticed this, and I asked for my money back. I was trying to give a small business owner a chance, but CROSS CONTAMINATION at any level IS UNACCEPTABLE. I told the MOD, and I left.

Sushi/sashimi is basically 1/2 of the food they offer here.  So if you don't like sushi, I wouldn't recommend coming here.  Everything looked so fresh!  I had a whole plate of sashimi (hamachi, mackerel, tuna, salmon, surf clam) and tried 2 of their sushi.  Normally the sushi sucks at buffet, but the ones here are actually creative and delicious!  There isn't a lot of options for hot food, but I usually pick a piece from each plate, so it didn't bother me.  They have an udon station (yum!! they actually give you a big bowl of udon.  I had two bowls).  Next to it, there is a soup station with 3-4 different kinds of soup (great soup!).  There is also a chocolate fondue station, but I didn't try it.So to summarize - if you like sushi/sashimi and soup - you'll love it!"},{"name":"Efrain's of Boulder Mexican Restaurant & Cantina","address":"1630 63rd St, Ste 10","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"How do they do it?

The fries where delicious (hot and perfectly salted), they also had a lovely crunchy outside with the soft inside! :) The salmon arrived to the table with a hair on it, but our sever returned it to the kitchen and had a new one fired.

The frites were delicious, but we prefer a marinated steak and so the un-marinated one they got was bland, and the compound butter was made with dill, which we dislike, and scraped off. The rendang was delicious, the meat falling apart perfectly over well-made rice; there was one spice in it I'm not fond of, but I couldn't pick out what it was, and I didn't dislike it's presence enough for it to mar my opinion on the meal. Solidly good, if not a stunner.The Saigon brussels sprouts, on the other hand, were utterly delicious, with a sweet-salty fish sauce caramel and perfect texture. We devoured those in short order, and the sauce left over was marvelous on the frites and steak.

My dining mate ordered the soup of the day and literally received a bowl - no, a cup - about 3 inches wide by 3 inches deep. My lime chicken quesadillas were four small triangles of plasticky cheese and overly-flavored chicken. The desserts are $6 each. Fine, no big deal. But a scoop of Amy's ice cream is considered a separate dessert, so if you wanted...let's say...their Devil's Chocolate Cake a la mode, that would cost you $12.On a positive note, the house salad was a nice mix of leafy greens and ripe cherry tomatoes with delicious dressing.

All things considered, $4 per taco is not bad when you are consuming them in a fairly upscale atmosphere and they taste that f-ing good.  My only issue is that you have to pay for chips and salsa.

Not enough of an annoyance to take away a star, though.Believe me when I say that I forgot about all things monetary when I sank my teeth into dessert (it wasn't just because of the margaritas).  Their Mexican vanilla ice cream with cajeta and apple crumble is TO-DIE-FOR.  I hope the people at the tables in my vicinity weren't too disgusted by my constant moaning, though.

I love how it is all served family style as it gives everyone an opportunity to try a little bit of everything.We got there right when they opened on a Friday and we got seated and served right away. If you love Sriracha- you must try the Dim Summore bloody mary... it is amazing. Totally hit the spot. All of the food we had was great and especially liked the homemade biscuit sandwich at potatoes bravas..Joshua, our server was great! Within twenty minutes of them opening and having our order taken the entire restaurant was PACKED! Even though they were busy, Joshua was attentive and responsive to us. They got a slight order of bacon vs sausage confused. We told them it wasn't a big deal as we both enjoy bacon & sausage (who am I to complain about more bacon?) but even after they rectified the problem- Joshua still brought us complimentary chocolate potato donuts! That was very unexpected but really left a mark. Great customer service!

When we got there last Thursday night it was \\"prime happy hour\\" probably for the folks that work in that area.  But I was 2 drinks away from being comfortable with the screeching voices, apparently happy hour started way before 5 p.m.  Also, they advertised an appetizer special (email pasted below, I have the original) that the waiter had no idea about, in fact, looked at us with the most stupid look on his face for a full minute forcing us to explain the email.  We left, soley based on the utterly quizzical look on the waiter's face.  Strange start of the evening.

Not so much...We were seated at a tiny, sticky table in the middle of the room where we got bumped by every passing server. Coffee, something that should be a staple of any 24/7 diner genre restaurant, sucks here. Cheap, weak coffee. Things were looking grim already. Our waitress was indeed friendly, but she was either high as a kite or long ago killed enough brain cells to render her a speech slurring, deer in the headlights zombie. Either that, or we were supposed to be impressed with her cool, cavalier attitude toward her profession and be wowed with her carefree spirit and whimsical total lack of interest. It would have been more impressive if she'd just done a decent job waitressing. So Zombie Waitress took our order and didn't write it down. (Afterall, she's cool, she's breezy, she doesn't care!) This is fine if you are Jean Phillipe in a Gordon Ramsay Michelin Star restaurant. When you are a terrible waitress in a 24/7 diner, this means only one thing:Our order arrived totally f'ed up. Zombie Waitress brought 1 omelet to my husband, the wrong omelet. Several minutes went by. Then she brought the correct omelet to my husband, and gave me a third kind of omelet. I did not order an omelet. A few minutes went by and she brought me one (woefully bland) gingerbread pancake, a side item to my main entree. By then my husband had finished his omelet and finally then, MY entree arrived. And all Zombie Waitress could mutter was \\"doooooood, like, sorry man, I got confused.\\" Fwiw, my husband enjoyed his omelet, though he would have enjoyed eating it with me. I understand that this place is some sort of iconic South Congress landmark. How nice for it. Perhaps it's a good choice at 3am when little else is open, your standards have been lowered by copious amounts of booze, and you are desperate for pancakes.

Decor was very cute, looked like an Anthropolgie window display(that's a good thing in my book)\\nOn to the food. Started with oyster's, delicious. They were fresh, well cleaned and came w a trio of sauce/accompaniments(more interesting than just a mignonette). I had the duck entree as my main with a king oyster mushroom side dish. Holy cow, one of the best duck preparations I've ever had. It was unbelievably tender and flavorful. The skin had been rendered perfectly, so crispy. That all being said, the mushrooms totally stole the show. They were glazed in a balsamic reduction w toasted hazelnuts. I could eat that dish every day.\\nCON'S: Steak tartare is my favorite dish ever and I had specifically picked Little Bird because I was excited to see their take on it. While beautifully presented, both flavor profile and texture were totally off. The grated cheese and creme fraiche(I know, dairy in tartare?!?) completely obliterated any flavor of beef and the meat had been minced so finely it was more of a meat paste/rillette consistency. Total let down on the dish I'd most been anticipating. All in all, I really like Petit Oiseu, but it is the younger sibling trying to get out of the golden child's shadow.

Neptune is hands down my favorite seafood place in Boston. This is the only place that I am willing to wait for a hour to be seated, and to feel lucky, that I am sitting at a table and at not the bar.  If I could eat shellfish all day here, I would. (And if I had the money...). Many choices from the raw bar.... and all very fresh. If you come here for lunch, get the warm butter lobster roll. Sooo much scrumptious lobster in a bun. Each time I order the roll, I look at the plate and say \\"Oh, wow, so much food, I won't be able to finish it this time,\\" but without fail, I devour it like a gluttonous beast. Everytime. It's a phenomenon that continues to baffle me. If I'm feeling healthy, I get the bib lettuce salad instead of the the fries. The scallops, an entree recently added earlier this year, are seared to perfection and taste phenomenal on top of a creative bed of greens, pomengranate, and duck confit. The foie-wich is one of my favorite appetizers. But beware, it is deceivingly filling, so be sure to share. Each bite is heavenly...The only thing I do not recommend is the oyster burger. It is quite underwhelming for a specialty seafood burger, as the oyster becomes completely lost in the mess of cheddar, garlic mayo, meat, and batter. It's like a treasure hunt on your palette... with sadly no prize in the end. All in all, I always look forward to dining here. I like how they have a small, consistent, set menu with daily specials. If I have any room left after dinner, I always try to grab a ricotta florentine cannoli at Mike's Pastry. Mm you can never have too much buttery, cheesy, artery clogging goodness.

I'm sure it was the kitchen that was holding things up, but waiting an hour for sandwiches doesn't make sense. \\n* Cash-only. I'm assuming this will change, but it's 2015. Get Square and keep it moving.\\n* There is 0 atmosphere here. The inside is depressing and the little patio outside is right next to busy S. Congress, so loud and exhaust-y. A metal tub full of bamboo and other trailing plants around the perimeter of the patio would go SO far.

I appreciated the option between sausage and mushroom gravy for my veggie, halal and kosher eaters. We ordered the Reggie, the wedgie, the pot pie and the club. The reggie and pot pie were by far the biscuit. The biscuits are kinda thing but still soft so they crumble while you eat. I didn't mind but not for someone who isn't willing to get dirty.

It was $45 for two 5-course meals, which is half off what it would normally cost.  We forgot about the gift certificate until the week that it expired, so while this is normally kind of a special occasion place, we went on a random Friday night.There's a valet, so parking is easy.  I'd read in other reviews that you have to take your shoes off upon entering, but they didn't ask us to.  The restaurant was dark and had little tables that were near to the ground.Our waiter was attentive, asking us immediately if either of us were vegetarian, since the appetizer had chicken in it.  The five courses were as follows:1.  Lentil Soup\\n2.  Salad\\n3.  Appetizer\\n4.  Entrees\\n5.  Mint tea and dessertI really liked the lentil soup and the salad.  The salad was actually a large plate with like 8 different salads on it.  We were told to use our hands or the bread to eat each salad, though they did bring forks in case we wanted them.By this point, we were both pretty full.  After a little bit of confusion, they brought us a vegetarian version of the appetizer, which was a filo dough pastry with vegetables inside.  For our entrees, I had the vegetables tajine mhammer and my husband had the shrimp pappell.  I was not that impressed with either.  Maybe it was because we were both really full already, but mine was bland and his was greasy.  After they boxed up our food, they poured us some mint tea (watching the waiter pour it from high in the air was kind of cool) and gave us a plate with two pastries and some syrupy fruit.What I didn't like at all about this restaurant was how loud it got.  Every 20 minutes or so, belly dancers would come out, which was cool, but when they did, all these strobe lights would flash and the music would get really, really loud.  It was distracting.  Same thing with birthdays - strobe lights and incredibly loud music - and a lot of people apparently have their birthday here.  We must have heard it four times.This place was okay.

I'm not a vegetarian (far from it) but the onion and gruyere turnovers were amazing.  I also opted for the roasted bone marrow over the foie gras terrine (since I prefer seared) and that was a healthy helping.Usually, when you eat at a restaurant bar, there is a certain level of \\"neglect\\" you incur because you don't have a dedicated server.  However, the barkeep was very friendly and excellent.  He spoke to all of the food items and the sister restaurant as if he were the manager (he was that knowledgeable).  He also seemed to know his spirits, based on the conversation I had with him about places he had visited while in SF.  I wish more restaurants were like this and employed people with a real passion for food and drink.  That's the difference between a 4-star and 5-star establishment, in my opinion.I also learned that the chef (Gabriel Rucker)  won the James Beard award in 2011 for his other restaurant (Le Pigeon).

The 2 sides don't speak in terms of seating order, so decide which side you want and go for it. Once you've committed, there's no turning back. The food was dirty and delicious. The loaded bowl should not be eaten without an accompanying aspirin and statin but it was tasty. Crisp, fried hash browns, mixed with melted cheese, covered in veggie sausage gravy and an over easy egg on top. I am home. The dirty harry bloody mary was a salad in a spicy tomato-alcohol bath - just how I like it.

Decided to try delivery from the \\"healthy\\" pizza place close to home.  Bad decision...  This was a terrible experience at every turn. First, the website wouldn't take my order because it was 30 mins until a delivery driver would be available. Really, they can't take my order now and deliver it after 30 mins when the driver has arrived?  Stupid.  Fine, I'll call it in. OK, not so fine, since the phone ordering person hung up on me (after a long wait) when she couldn't figure out how to order a new menu item.  Alright, back to the website where at least I can order the pizza I want.  By now, the delivery driver is on duty so I get the order ready.  But, the website form insists that I set the ready time for 50 mins, which is the average delivery time. Surely they will make then deliver the pizza when I put in the order... NO, they waited until the 50 mins was past before doing anything.  I know this because I called the store when they were 15 mins past due, and the hard-to-understand woman said as much. It took almost TWO HOURS to get a pizza from when I first started trying to order it.  TWO HOURS on a quiet Sunday afternoon, not even dinner time.To add insult to injury the pizzas themselves were terrible. The Prosciutto Arugula pizza had arugula that was over-oiled, slimy and wilted with little parmesan. The prosciutto was very salty.  The Mexican pizza was nothing like the picture or description: the avocado was so thinly sliced you could see through it (I didn't even think that was possible), it was covered in too many red onions and had hardly any chicken.  It was not good at all.   Seriously, it was very expensive ($41), with low quality ingredients and terrible service.

It really seems more intended to be a bar than a restaurant.  Options for parking are the same as the other restaurants located in the bottom of the 360 - $7 valet service, hunting for someone leaving, or hiking in from somewhere else.  The space is well designed, open and modern, and would be great for large groups.  There is a very nice creekside outdoor area, but it was far too hot today for us to brave the sun.We were finally forced to rather rudely break the hostess away from the apparently engrossing conversation she was having with another staff member, but once we had gained her attention, she was pleasant and we were promptly seated at the table of our choice.  The service was prompt and excellent and the presentation was great.  We were disappointed in both the quantity and flavor of the chips and salsa ($1.50).  We had to order a second round due to the portion size, so we opted to add guacamole for $3 additional -- the guac was generously portioned but a bit overly creamy for my taste and also lacking much flavor.They have a limited menu, primarily of taco platters.  The waiter indicated that the food was intended to be served tapas-style, but the portion sizes are really not adequate for sharing, and the prices seemed a bit too high to order several dishes and sample.  I had steak tacos and my companion had grilled chicken.  Both were served with very small portions of nicely flavored white rice and a sort of unremarkable refried bean pur√©e.  My two steak tacos were very small, but the meat was deliciously spiced and of good quality.  There was a messy red sauce served over my tacos -- it tasted great, but I had to eat it carefully.  My companion said his chicken tacos were fine but unremarkable.  We actually ordered the second round of chips/salsa/guac after we received our platters because we were concerned that we might leave hungry.All in all, the space and staff were great, and they had an impressive bar menu.  We didn't drink at this dinner, but I know one of the bartenders from a former restaurant, and based on his presence I'd guess the drinks are top notch.

Either way, it's a really cool environment as well as a great date spot.I came here with a group of 4 to celebrate a friend's birthday. The bread and butter for one dollar is a must-order as it is a great deal for a delicious appetizer. I ended up ordering the steak sandwich, which is in many photos for this place. I found it to be, just okay. This just may have been my interpretation, but the steak in the main photo of this yelp page, to me, looks like very thick strips of steak. I was let down to find my sandwich meat be very thin, as if it was meat out of the package of a grocery store. The meat itself was also pretty salty. There were also thin onion rings and peppers in this sandwich.  Complimented with a sweet horseradish type of sauce, it was still pretty good, and I'd give it a six out of ten. I do wish it came with fries though. It was slightly pricier than the burger, they're both about the same size, and the burger does come with fries.  My friend ordered the burger. I did not try any, but he said it was really good but he's had better. It was definitely not in his top five...which is disappointing, for he said (as well as I have) that the Toro Bravo burger, which is by the same owner, is one of the best he's ever had.I did try my friend's duck however. It was duck cooked medium or medium rare, which I've never seen before. It was very tender and delicious, the best thing on the table.

The food was okay, not the best. \\nMy fiance and I went here for my birthday dinner last night. When I told people we were going here they absolutely raved about it. After going last night, I do not understand the appeal.\\nI arrived at 515pm and found they were already putting people on the dinner list to be sat. I put my name down and squeezed into a small spot at the stand up bar to order a beverage while waiting for my fiance to arrive. The bar is extremely cramped. I ordered an Old Fashioned for my beverage. It was delicious but only filled about 1/3 of the tumbler. Either make the beverage larger or serve it in a smaller glass. \\nWe were sat about 10 min later at a small table right up against a half wall with the host desk on the other side of the wall. Everyone once in awhile something slammed or bumped into that wall and startled us. Not the most relaxing place to sit. The place was so dark that I had to use the light from my phone to see the menu. IT was 530pm.\\nAdditionally, they ended up sitting a party of 7 next to us at a table meant for 6. Because they were so crowded into that table one of the guys kept encroaching into our very small little table area.\\nWe ordered the hush puppies, waygu skirt steak, sauteed spinach, duck duck potatoes and the scallops. The best dish was the waygu skirt steak. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare, althoughsalty but I didn't mind that on this dish. The hush puppies were light and fluffy but nothing to write home about. The sauteed spinach was lovely with a light flavor and not overly wilted. The duck duck potatoes are odd. They are flavorful but they were also extremely salty. The dish I was most looking forward to were the scallops as I adore a good scallop. These were cooked well but so overly seasoned and overly salty that you didn't really get a chance to taste the actually scallop. It's almost as if someone spilled a salt shaker in the kitchen and no one wanted to waste any food so they served it anyway. They even had salt on the table but dear god, I don't know who would need to add more salt to these dishes. \\nHere's what I really didn't like about our experience. We were told the food is served family style and comes out whenever it is ready. We got the hush puppies first and almost immediately after we got our skirt steak. Then about 5 min later we got the potatoes and about 3 min after that we got the remaining two dishes. The service was extremely rushed and we weren't able to eat the dishes together to compliment each other. I mean, who wants to eat just sauteed spinach? Also, these dishes are not \\"family style\\". They are tapas. Family style traditionally means large portioned platters that you then serve yourself from. These dishes are extremely small. I mean $6 for 3 hush puppies? um....am I missing something...?\\nFrom the moment we sat down in the restaurant to when we paid the check it was less than 30 mins. Not exactly the relaxing birthday dinner I wanted.\\nOh, and I shouldn't be surprised by this, because it's Portland but the servers were pretentious snobs. My fiance saw a shot glass with paper in it on our table when we sat down. He didn't know what it was so he moved it to the table next to us thinking it wasn't ours. A server quickly came over and said \\"oh, no, no. We might sit this table soon. This is for you.\\" No explanation given to what this paper was. We found out that it was our tab from the bar.\\nEssentially we spent $120 on a meal that was overly salty, filled with pretentious snobs and ate in about the same amount of time as a fast food restaurant.

This may be why we had an underwhelming experience compared to most others.We really are in no rush to ever try their food again."},{"name":"Bar Mezzana","address":"360 Harrison Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Space was large but seating was a tiny cramped feeling.  Definitely on the louder side but it was a Saturday night so expected.  The food took an unreasonably long time but the management did a great job rectifying and apologizing for the mishap.  Why only 3 stars? While the food was ok it was neither memorable or amazing.  It was ok.  The prices were kind of high and the homemade pasta was mediocre.  While I didn't dislike the place, I won't be heading back anytime soon."},{"name":"Luke's Lobster Back Bay","address":"75 Exeter Street","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"As a tourist in Boston, you're going to want to try some lobster rolls and that's just what I did. Out of the two highly rated and reviewed joints that I've tried, Luke's was better. At Luke's you're able to order a trio of sandwiches which include a lobster, shrimp and crab roll. The portion is smaller compared to a single roll, but variety is nice (at least if you just want to try it all). All three rolls are served on a lightly toasted bun stuffed to the maxxxx with meat. I also tried both the lobster bisque and the clam chowder and they were both pretty good as well. The clam chowder makes a great compliment with the sandwiches and is much better eaten with the oyster crackers. The crackers help balance out the salty taste of the chowder. Overall, food was awesome, service was quick and I'd definitely come back."},{"name":"Papa's Pizza Parlor","address":"15700 NW Blueridge Dr","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3","text":"We were here tonight with our soccer team.  We had reserved a room and showed up a little bit early so the room wasn't ready.  They didn't have enough people to clean it quickly so some of our parents went in and helped.  That's fine, we were early.  The boys had a great time in the play area.  The merri-go-round was out of order, but the boys thought it looked cool.  It was nice that the play area is completely enclosed so it cuts down on noise.  There are windows on 3 sides of the play area so you can watch your kid.We had pre-ordered our pizza, but still had to stand in a long line to pay for it.  That took about 10 minutes.  Then you have to stand in another line and pay separately if you want anything to drink.  Another 10 minutes.  Definitely not customer friendly.  I don't like standing in line for my meals... let alone two different lines.  We ordered a taco pizza and a pepperoni for the family.  The taco pizza was just okay.  It was the blandest taco pizza I've had (if you want a good one, go to a Pietro's).  It kind of tasted like cardboard with lettuce on top.  Some of the tomatoes were pretty green on top.  With a little taco sauce it was a little better, but not great.  I can't attest to the pepperoni.  My 11 year old said it was good, but he'll eat anything as long as you call it pizza.I also thought the pizza was extremely expensive for pizza.  We've been to some amazing pizza places and paid a lot less."},{"name":"Viva Mi Arepa","address":"5197 Washington St","city":"West Roxbury","stars":"4","text":"Yum! Great find from Yelp.

So we had high hopes for brunch at tasty N alder.  We got there and stood in line to put our names down for the waiting list, the hostess did not acknowledge in the slightest nor the people in front of us. She seemed a little too busy making jokes and flirting with the waiter on duty. Eventually we got her attention so she could finally start taking names down of the people in front of us and our selves. She told us the wait was 30-45 mins and we said that was fine. We waited and hour before saying something, because we get it, some people take their time while eating. We checked in and looked at the list realizing she had been taking people who had check in after us. And continued to do so even after we brought it to her attention. Eventually we sat down, and our waiter was okay. But the food was definitely great. The difference between tasty n sons vs. tasty n alders is definitely service. The food is not lacking one bit.

It's kind of dark inside which makes the place romantic I guess. It's also a nice place to dine and hang out with friends as they cater big tables for big groups.

The Greek and The Pig are my favorites and I doubt you'd need to stray much from there on your first try. The Greek features a wrap with hummus, cucumber, feta, and chicken along with tomatoes and olive dressing. If you're a messy eater like me, you should have enough hummus drip out to have something to dip your pita chips into.The Pig, which should be in the running for best sandwich in Orlando, is made up of a nicely sized grilled pork loin on french bread with caramelized onions, tomatoes, and bacon. It's delightfully sweet and succulent and if your mouth doesn't water at the thought of it then you may need your pork gland checked, because it's probably not functioning correctly.Greens and Grille has great, fresh ingredients and some expertly crafted sandwiches that will captivate your taste buds.

Hungry and short of time, we decided to settle for this restaurant.

Like Allison Y. said, it is eerily similar to the quality of food they serve at your local college cafeteria. If you haven't had that experience yet, it's nothing you'll miss. Trust me.Food:\\n- Corn tortillas. I'm really not a fan of them... So I don't appreciate them that much. However, they were unlimited, so I GUESS that's cool.\\n- Bacon was WAY too salty and tasted like frozen mass cooked bacon... As a bacon lover, i'm really saddened by this.\\n- Potatoes were one of the redeeming factors. They were cut in a good size and cooked so that they weren't hard, but the insides were soft and warm. A plus!\\n- There was something that resembled an Arepa but had meat inside. I'm not really too sure what it was, since there was no label, but the corn pancake on the outside was really stiff and grainy. I didn't like it at all.Also, their decor was... odd. The walls are painted different colors and the aesthetic pieces don't seem to match at all. A plus of this is that it made the restaurant seem homey, especially in the corner that is SO out of the way that holds a couple of couches for people to study at.I wasn't really impressed by the free mimosa I got either. The proportion of champagne to orange juice was off, giving the mimosa a not-so-great-for-brunch kind of taste.Their normal menu looked decent, but i'm not sure that I liked their brunch enough to go back.

I called Redbones and a manager looked into it, letting me know that my server had accidentally added the amount to my tip.

Everytime I go out of town, I always search for \\"Best Burgers\\". I found this place. I read the reviews about crowds, etc. I was arriving for a late dinner on a Friday, so I expected a wait. I figured, wth and went anyway. I found some street parking a block away, and walked in. There was indeed a lot of people. Since I was by myself tho, I'd hoped it wouldn't be too bad. The host was very friendly. He advised me to stand by the bar, and grab a spot the instant someone stood up, without bothering to wait for it to be cleaned. Otherwise, someone else would grab it. As luck would have it, it only took about 10 minutes to get a seat. There is not a single healthy thing on the menu, but who cares? If you want healthy, go find a salad restaurant. The ambiance reads \\"quirky\\", with dollar bills with sayings on them hung on the walls, etc. It reminded me a lot of my favorite burger/bar place in Atlanta called The Vortex. There were so many things I wanted to try. I opted for the Cheesy Burrito Bites, and the Western Burger. The Bites were good, tho I wound up getting 1 Mini Corn Dog by mistake. I love corn dogs, so no biggie. The burger was a little disappointing. The meat was good; juicy and flavorful, but the bun was dried out and crumbly. The fries were OK, but some were underdone, some were overdone, some were cold. The bar staff was very friendly, but despite a small area, and 3 bartenders, service was a bit slow. Considering they'd want you in and out as fast as possible to get the next guest seated, that was a bit of a surprise. I wound up spending 90 minutes there.

I'm a huge fan of these little fried rice and bread crumb concoctions anyways, but I like Scoozi's take on them.  Bite sized and crunchy on the outside, I really enjoyed this classic Italian appetizer.Low - Steak Frites.  Chewy and undercooked (asked for medium, got a definite medium rare), the Bearnaise sauce saved this from being completely mediocre.Medium - Beer selection.  A decent amount of selections, and \\"I see what you did there\\" with the local brewery inclusions, but I had all three local brewery choices that night, and didn't really like any of them.  Chalk that up to my taste, but as an aside, $7 for an Allagash, yikes!Low - Service.  Our waitress definitely forgot us on several occasions throughout the evening.  Had to wait much longer than average between ordering drinks and ordering appetizers, then food.High - Grilled steak sandwich.  Why didn't I make this my meal?  My dining companion for the evening, Briana M., made the better choice here.  A good cut of steak, tasty, melty cheese, and good ingredients.I probably won't make the trip out to BU again for a Scoozi visit, although take-out for lunch is an option in the future.

Called ahead, found they only had a select menu $38 per person (four courses).  Asked if we could order from the regular menu - no.  Fine.  We'd never been there and were anxious to try their temptations as referred to in previous reviews.  Alas, we'll have to go back to order off the regular menu.  This may be a while.  We were sat (had reservations) and, after ordering cocktails and receiving complimentary champagne, ordered our dinners.  Waited and waited.  Asked for some bread (an up charge!) which arrived after our appetizers and soup/salads.  WTF?  Why bother?  And it was dry, I mean, suck every bit of moisture out of your mouth dry.  Meant for salads and soups i think.  Ordered the Guiness short ribs.  Blech.  Dry, dry, dry.  Did not fall off the bone but yet was over done (how does that happen??!!)  Spaghetti squash was lukewarm and had an odd flavor.  The fries were good, although waaaay too much whatever herb was on them for me.  Then, I see another table receive a full rack of BBQ ribs that was NOT on the menu!!  WTF again?!  Service was good, although our server appeared to have changed somewhere during our meal.

At some point, I kept wondering what the big fuss was all about?For one as a restaurant space it is so sparse and unentertaining. The music creates a very trippy atmosphere but that's about it. If you're not there on a date in which your conversation can be caressed by the music, then it's just white noise to you.Secondly, the food. It took me a long time to decide what to eat. The menu was just all over the place. Nothing substantial. The food that seemed promising was overpriced for very small portions.Then, back to issue no. 1. I am assuming this place is only fun after 11. I kept thinking, I thought the music would start revving up by now, it was 10.30, that maybe there would be a slow build to the \\"madness\\" so to say. But the mood, trippy music continued even until close to 11.Most importantly, the bartenders had zero personality, all four of them. And you know how I am about bar staff having some personality. They spent more time chatting among themselves than they did with their customers. I even tried to crack a joke with one of them and he gave me a cold stare. It was just awkward. An awkward dining experience in a sparse cold space. Plus it didn't help that the seats at the bar were just uncomfortable. I guess they were going for some type  of eclectic look, but they felt awful after about 10 minutes. I left this place thinking, one, I will not come back here in a hurry, not to eat or even dance, and two, what was all the fuzz about.

They waxed poetic about their experience. We said we had a similar experience at Vindalho a few months back and noted, in a \\"different strokes for different folks\\" kind of way, that there were some poor reviews on Yelp. Which made us feel we needed to post our review of Vindalho; belated as it is.It seems some of the poor reviews are a function of expectations and reality being out of sync \\"at the gate\\" if one is expecting Vindalho to be a traditional Indian food restaurant. It is not that and does not pretend to be that.  Marketing materials have always referenced a \\"Spice Route\\" food orientation. On that it delivers. In fact, we'd say owner David Machado has just the right blend of food, ambiance, service and value.Here's what we liked about Vindalho and why we look forward to going back. FOOD: Complimentary chickpea flat bread arrived not long after we placed our cocktail order. A great nibble to enjoy with the luscious libations while we perused the dinner menu. We started with a nightly special appetizer of chickpea and chicken fritters. I was skeptical as I'm not a fried food fan, but the fritters were yummy...crisp outside, tender in, not the least greasy and lightly seasoned. Entrees were pork Vindalho and Madras lamb curry with curry leaves. Both are mainstays of the menu, we were told, and we can see why as each was pungent and delicious. (Nice too that they use Carlton pork for a local, humane source... important factors for us.) We selected the three chutney sampler (only $5) to enjoy creative options to accompany our entrees.  Like others, we also wish Vindalho didn't charge for chutneys, but if that's what allows them to create top quality condiments, well we'd rather pay for them than have something mediocre be free. Chutneys here are great.The entrees were too large for us to finish them, but we were still tempted to share a (large) bowl of house made ice cream and tea to linger in this inviting place on a drizzly Portland evening. AMBIANCE: Contemporary design with nicely subdued light levels that feels welcoming.  Although we'll admit the \\"Pearl District Industrial\\" look that seems to appear everywhere in Portland does get too predictable in new spaces. Hopefully designers would leverage unique qualities of existing older neighborhoods rather than trying to bring the Pearl (as great as it is where it is) everywhere else. Something we enjoyed was that the diners present seemed to suggest this was a neighborhood place, not an elite restaurant catering only to those \\"cool\\" enough to enter. We loved the \\"all are welcome here\\" vibe from on this evening with diners including parents with children, mid age singles eating alone, younger couples and older couples. And added to ambiance is the wonderful aroma that greets you at the door along with the warm welcome by the staff. SERVICE: Our server was friendly without being familiar and knew the menu well to answer questions and make recommendations. We arrived soon after opening on what seemed a slow evening at first but during the meal there was a \\"wave\\" of several diners arriving all at once which made it tougher for him to juggle food orders and delivery. Still, he did a great job of balancing that challenge. He worked like he owned the place, which we mean as high praise for his efforts to ensure everyone had a good experience. When he said, as he delivered the dinner check, that he appreciated that we had come to Vindalho, we think he meant it...more of the \\"ownership\\" focus. \\n. \\nVALUE: About $70 total for the two of us and there was plenty of food to have served three. We wished we'd had a friend along for the meal as we couldn't take the leftovers with us that night. ACCESSIBILITY: Accessible space for people with mobility limits from entry through seating, although we didn't \\"check out\\" the bathrooms. Great to note that a person using a wheelchair was sitting at a window table as it is too often true that people with disabilities are routinely seated in the worst tables, like those right near the door. Often that is because restaurants' layout prevents people using mobility aids from getting to all of the tables equally. Good for Vindalho for the truly equal access. DRAWBACKS: Parking in the Clinton neighborhood area can be bear, but that's true in all Portland neighborhoods."},{"name":"Portland City Grill","address":"111 SW 5th Ave, Fl 30","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Dear Portland City Grill,I recall when I first moved to Portland six years ago thinking you were so wonderful and hip.

I know my visits have grown few and far between over the years. However, I still pop in when I have an out-of-town guest so that they too can experience the wonder you have created.  I now regretfully must inform you we are breaking up.  When I brought my sisters there last weekend, I knew we were done for good.  First of all, you smelled really funny.

I guess you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.The food was amazing.  Again, I can only report what my taste buds told me so I cannot comment on the authenticity of the food.  I had a sampler plate with fried lechon.  The fry around the pork was perfect and crunchy -- it provided great textural difference against the other food in the platter.  At first I thought the pork was a little bland but the key was eating the onions and the pork together!  After I did that, the combination was irresistible!  Another dish worth mentioning was the fried plantains.  They came out potato chip thin and topped with copious amounts of garlic.  The taste of the plantain was subtle but surprisingly, the garlic was not overpowering despite how much of it was there.The thing that brought Havana Kiss down to a 4 star was the service charge.  We were a party of 4 and I believe it is far from standard to autograt a party of this size.  It wasn't that big of a deal but it definitely cheated the server out of a little extra tip (from me anyway)."},{"name":"Cork & Fork","address":"5180 S Conway Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"I'm sitting here and I have barely enough time to express the EXCELLENCE of this GEM of a place ... we will come back and try everything on the menu because WoW !

And I realllyyy love fresh oysters.\\nFor entrees, my mom went with the hot lobster roll and I had the scallops. I don't even like lobster (I know, I'm weird), but the lobster roll was soo good.

Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed, maybe it was the extremely high expectations I had going into the restaurant, or maybe it was just a bad day, I'm most likely not heading back there anytime soon.  First off, I do agree with most in that the lunch menu looks delicious and cheap, definitely cheaper than most korean restaurants anywhere near Vancouver.  However, the gamjaetang which I was really looking forward to having ~ mainly made of pork bone soup and potatoes, was extremely disappointing.  There was hardly any meat on the bones, and the soup tasted really salty and watered down, the potatoes were not nearly cooked enough and looked like they had JUST been dumped into the soup.  I've tried gamjatang in New York Ktown and other korean places in Vancouver, and so far the gamjaetang at Haroo is the worst.  We also ordered the seafood pancake, which of course was amazing like everyone said, if not a little lacking in actual seafood, but still pretty decent.  The LA Ribs were delicious and well cooked, if not alittle burnt and salty for my taste, but again, not a deal breaker.  We also ordered the seafood fried rice, and I would not recommend it as it tasted over cooked and looked unappealing.  The side dishes were probably some of the better dishes I've had, and the jap chae was also pretty amazing, maybe a little too much pepper, but maybe that's how it should really be, since I'm mostly used to sweeter jap chae elsewhere.  The bimbimbap was also decent, nothing special, and a little too oily for my taste, but otherwise your average bimbimbap.  The portions were also pretty decent, the seafood pancake is worth it, but the gamjaetang was 14$+ dollars, and definitely NOT worth it.  The reason why Haroo is getting only a 2/5 for this review is probably because I had extremely high expectations going in and came out extremely disappointed.  Apart from the decent seafood pancake and ribs, I would honestly go to another restaurant for the same food for the same price.  Although I'm still hoping that this is simply just a bad day, or maybe my taste buds just had an OFF day, I would not be too hasty to go to Haroo again, maybe for lunch next time, because the lunch menu looks appealing."},{"name":"Cafe Deia","address":"394 Main St, Ste B","city":"Medford","stars":"4","text":"Best secret breakfast place around Davis.

Not just bad, but terrible.1.  15+ customers in the restaurant and STILL only one person working there.  This caused a 30 minute wait.  This is ridiculous and needs to be addressed by the management.  3. The sandwich was sloppily made.  One half of the sandwich had 2 bites of chicken on it, and the rest was toppings and bun.  2. My chicken was raw in the middle.  And unfortunately for me, I didn't notice it until it was too late.  Fast forward to the worst 4 days of my life, stuck in my bathroom expelling every fluid imaginable.  Sorry Seven Hens, but you have lost my business."},{"name":"Scoozi","address":"580 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I love Scoozi for the go-to items on their menu, namely the prosciutto panino. The girls who work there are nice, I live nearby and always just get to-go for myself, but try and leave a decent tip since their business is so slow in the winter. Like another reviewer, I think the menu is hit or miss. My prosciutto sandwich (with arugula since I ask) always hits the spot, but when I tried the pasta primavera it was only ok. I have to explore the menu a little more, but it's one of those places that seems to do certain items better than others. I like the staff a lot, cooks are friendly too (they're visible here) and I like that they have the San Benedetto cold tea as a drink choice, and the way they include the tiny bag of cape cods with the sandwich is perfect."},{"name":"Teji's Indian Restaurant and Grocery","address":"2100B Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"we have been visiting this restaurant every once in a month. Over the past 3 months the quality of the food went down drastically. I think either the cooks or the mangement have changed so as the quality of the food and the taste of the food. Food was stinking and we were 8 people went to the restaurant and none of the orders were good. On top of it there is no courtesy of listeining to the customers. One of the couple in our group havent got the food for 1hr 20 min, where as rest of us completed our meal. The couple were not happy and would like to cancel the order, but they havent agreed and in return they are telling that if we can wait for another 30 min they can serve us and this really pissed them off and we left with out eating our food.. They were not in a mood to even listen to us or no concern in giving an apology.  This will be our last visit to this restaurant. Good Bye Tejis. you have lost business from atleast 5 dedicated families and I hope Most of them stop visiting this place.

I have been wanting to try this place for years now. I'm pretty sure I've even had a reservation once before. No go. So I talked a new friend into going with on a Friday afternoon, following a trip to the Chinese Garden. You take an elevator up to the restaurant. And the view is all around as soon as you get there. You can't miss it! I suppose there isn't a bad seat in the house (I didnt walk all the way around). But it's still better to sit in a window seat so you can point at shit. So we found the only one we could find at 4pm (start of happy hour) which was in a corner in a spot that really isnt a spot, but two chairs up against a table without enough room for our legs to fit underneath... But we had a view. And it was gorgeous! The place is dark, not unbearable, but like the reviewer before me noted, I could barely read the menu. But it all adds to a really lovely ambiance of romantic and happenin' in the middle of the metropolos. This would be a wonderful place for a date or a meal with visitors (if you can afford the regular menu). I really like the feel. But it doesnt seem like the kind of place where people actually talk to each other, as in meet people. Maybe if we'd sat at the bar. Of course that didn't stop us from making friends with the crazy girls at the big booth next to us (big enough for like 6 people!). They were loud and fun and the one on vacation told us she loved us as we hugged her on the way out. Results may not be typical :).The drinks at happy hour were not terribly cheap. I had the whiskey lemonade for $5.95. It was pretty darn good. Rice paper spring rolls ($4.95) were very tasty, Oven roasted salmon cakes ($7.95) were dissapointing. They needed to be crunchier and have a more distinct flavor. Just 3 very small salty balls for $8. The herb-parmesian fries were quite good, and the most filling plate, at $4.95.So food is 3.5. Service is 4, view is 5, ambiance is 4.5. That's a 4...

You hear about it, people rave and so your expectations are high. I brought my little sister who was visiting from LA. She says there are no good food places down there so I chose this place being one of those popular spots in Portland. We find parking among the street chaos. There are no lots anywhere. We park and there is a line around the corner with a diverse group of people standing there, peeking through the windows and the big chalk menu on the wall above the registers planning what they are going to order. They move people through really quickly. You order at the front and pay first, if you order a drink they hand it to you right here. Their menu is good but definitely don't come here if you are watching your caloric intake, at all. The guy at the register cracked a couple jokes, handed us our mimosas and we went to find a seat. There isnt much seating inside, most of it is outside so If you plan on coming here, bring a jacket, you might be sitting outside in their cafeteria like seating. We got lucky and sat at the counter in front of the cooks. Not sure what to do we sat down and waited. We waited for quite a while and the food was ready, mine was missing meat, I ordered some plate without a biscuit that definitely said it had meat. I was a bit disappointed.My sister got the Reggie or something like that which was absolutely delicious with an egg and chicken, seems weird to me for breakfast but it was good as hell. She was definitely happy. I like this place but I wish it were larger, rushing us through like cattle makes it hard to enjoy your food. I would order this to go if I were to have it again.

I dig Jalopy and have always been a big fan of Nic's -- his cooking is on point and he seems to be a super nice dude.Though it was prime dining time on a Thursday, there was only a short line. As we drooled over the menu and fantasized about the carb-y fate awaiting us, Nic popped out and gave us an impassioned overview of the menu and answered our questions. After much debate, we settled on:1. Pomodoro with meatball ($14) -- Sweet and simple Italian-style red. It's vegetarian by default but we meat-ified it with a juicy, baseball-sized hunk of meat. I'm getting multiple meatballs next time. These boys are top notch.2. Cacio e Pepe with pork milanese ($14) -- Buttery, extra peppery and topped with crisp slices of pork milanese, it was Nic's recommendation and our table's favorite dish. Highly recommended. 3. Carbonara Alessandra ($11) -- Big bites of bacon mixed with cream, lemon, that exquisite fresh pasta and topped with a glorious little egg yolk.4. Asparagus ($3) -- Six spears chargrilled and then chilled and topped with cheese and olive oil. Definitely worth checking out.The pasta was homemade and rolled to order but came out before we could even make a dent in our first glass of wine and the bread they brought out to our table. We spent $42 total and was absolutely worth it. Simple, beautiful dishes and friendly, fast service. And, since this is more of the fresh, homemade approach (rather than the nauseatingly rich, stick of butter in each dish) you dont' feel like you're going to die afterwards.There's abundant seating in the courtyard between the trailer, Butterfly Bar and the Vortex, and it has a great vibe -- feels like your miles away from the city. This is a perfect low-key date spot or no-fuss happy hour destination. There's tons of space and it's kid friendly.It's not BYOB, but we ducked into the charming and chill Butterfly Bar (terrible name, awesome bar) for a $15 bottle of wine. They also have a solid selection of fancy-pants cocktails and reasonably priced beers (from $2.50 Lone Star tallboys to $5-$6 for the premo stuff.) Speaking of drinks, Patrizi's has a cool bar menu of cheaper, more snack-sized offerings. So if you just want some nibbles with your libations, you can get in and out for less than $10.Patrizi's is a welcome addition to a city that lacking in Italian food options.

It's difficult to shoehorn Co'm into any particular style of cuisine - it's definitely Vietnamese (heck is says that in the name) but it's not your typical pho restaurant - you can go to any number of Ph places all along the Buford Hwy corridor and elsewhere as it's become ubiquitous for this style of cuisine. In fact, I don't believe Co'm even had that classic Vietnamese soup/noodle dish on the menu until recently, and while the pho here is good, it's not the reason I love this restaurant so much. Rather than expend energy trying to define the niche Northern or Southern style of Vietnamese traditional cooking, Co'm's approach is more international and I believe French influenced (although many would argue that this is more of an American affectation, rather than a French one - I still think the bread-and-stew, variety of meats and baguettes point more towards the French occupation of the South rather than an American influence). Whatever you want to call it, Co'm has become one of my favorite restaurants in the many years I've visited.Co'm rests in the corner of an shopping center tucked behind a Chevron station - the better known Lee's Bakery is on the front end and Co'm rests several businesses behind it. When you walk in you'll find a very clean, borderline upscale restaurant with booths and tables. The service at Co'm is frankly fantastic - it's rare to find people who care so much for their patrons and if you've ever been to Asia you will never question the bad service you receive in many other Asian restaurants. Thankfully the owners of Co'm have more of an American take on service with quick attentiveness and water refills. The first thing you'll notice when you view the menu is that it's rather no-nonsense - just a list of interesting items by type: Appetizers, Fried Specialties, Signature Salads, Grilled Grape Leaves, French Indochine - what?!Page two continues with Co'm dishes, but the real stand-out for me is the B√∫n dishes (rice vermicelli) - both are similar, you basically get the ingredients listed in small piles, either on rice or rice pasta. Typically you mix it all together with a generous portion of sweet-sour fish sauce. Page three explores the Flat Rice Vermicelli (B√∫nh Hi), the Shaking Wok specialty (something I recommend to friends who have never had Vietnamese - between this and the Ph I usually get them hooked) and finally the Ph itself. Page four has some very special \\"French Inspired Indochine Selections\\" - basically the Vietnamese version of Chinese dishes - these are very special indeed. The menu finishes up with various juice selections - if you come for dinner you get a great scoop of coffee ice cream and delicate cream cakes (this last part is included).Interestingly, the last time I visited (for lunch AND a different group), we basically ordered the same as the previous time. For me, the B√∫n with grilled lamb grape rolls is my favorite (note that it was pointed out to me that although the leaf is similar to grape, it's actually wild betel leaf - something I'm not too familiar with but delicious nonetheless) - these rolls are made up of meat (here the options are tofu, beef, lamb or duck) rolled in betel and grilled so they have a smoky flavor. You mix with fresh veggies and the fish-sauce and chow down.The second and third items that my group had were the Ph and one of the Indochine selections, the Ginger Chicken. We started with some duck grape rolls (a good way to see if you like them without committing). All were quite good and satisfying. What I like about this restaurant is that through all the time I've been coming here for lunch and dinner, it's remained steadfast in it's food quality, and consistent in service. What more can you ask for? Elevating this one to 5 stars."},{"name":"J.

I almost traded mine out for hers but mine was too good to completely give up. \\nPita bread & a side salad come with all entrees. Again, the braid was warm and soft. I ate so much of it!

The service was horrible! We got our appetizer without plates, utensils or napkins. We had no idea who our waitress was - we just flagged down people to ask for our utensils and to take orders. Then finally our waitress comes to take our order and we told her we already gave our order to some other girl and she proceeds to b**** at us that it was all messed up and the order was cancelled because she is supposed to take our order not someone else. Well, we didn't see her for like the first 30-45 minutes (not until after we had eaten our appetizer) and how are we supposed to know your operations?? She was extremely rude, acted like it was our fault - no apology for not being around. Worst waitress, worst service I've experienced in a long while.Oh and I should mention, we were there on a Friday at 3pm - the place was NOT busy AT ALL!Plus the menus were sticky - gross.Will not be back."},{"name":"Pho Pasteur","address":"682 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Great pho spot and reasonably priced!\\nReview based on service and food. The taste of the pho is great! I got the #12 which is an XL dish. My one complaint is that the XL dish should definitely have more noodles, but there was a ton of meat in it so it made up for the lack of noodles. They had all the toppings on the table so we didn't have to ask for anything and if we did they brought it out right away. We did have to ask for more water which was bothersome since everyone at the table was in dire need of a refill and they should have noticed. We were seated right away and were even asked if we wanted to move to a larger table when one became available. This was really nice of them since we had a bigger party.

We arrived 30 minutes early and checked in. 30 minutes AFTER our reservation were we finally seated. Once we were seated and had our order taken, it took over 1.5 hours before our food arrived. About 10 minutes after midnight, which we did not plan on spending in this restaurant, all of a sudden an influx of food was brought out. It seems as if they deliberately held all the food for the guests remaining in the kitchen. All of our food all arrived cold, to the point that one of our party sent her dish back due to how cold it was. Buy this time, it was close to 12:30am and we were fed up. \\nThe manager ended up comping our entire meal, which was close to $300.

My boss and I got there before the vendor, so we decided to order drinks. The waitress had to take my card and \\"hold\\" the table.Wait, WHAT?! After further questioning, she told me she was not going to run it, but needed to link a card to the table. Again, What?!PCG has had so many dine and dashes that the waitstaff is now having to grab a card even before you place the napkin in your lap. Know why? If someone dines and dashes, and they didn't grab a card, the bill is on the waitperson. Which sucks for them--making it awkward at a normally higher-end establishment. Now that I have ranted my rant...The service was good--even for Happy Hour. The food was excellent and we were able to order multiple dishes and share, so we got to try just about everything on the menu.I guess I'll have to come back for that white cheddar burger...mmmm..."},{"name":"Jam On Hawthorne","address":"2239 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I have wanted to like this place. After several tries, I have determined the long wait and shitty service is not worth the mediocre food. First we walk in and are offered coffee to order. My sister requests a hot chocolate, \\" you can get that at the bar\\". We go to the bar and are ignored for a solid 5 and are told \\" you get that up front\\". We go back up front and a front of house woman huffs and puffs and comes back 10 minutes later with a watery resemblance. The real kicker however was my husbands meal. He ordered a hash which came out with hard fried eggs. The point of a hash is runny eggs. We waive down our waitress since she never came back to check on us and she says she will get proper sunny side eggs. She never actually comes back to see if they were brought out and was nowhere to be seen. The eggs finally come out 30 min later so his hash is ice cold. He ate the eggs alone and did not eat the hash. She finally shows up 45 min later with our water glasses dry and my husband still hungry. She asks how it was and I explain my husband's eggs took forever and his food was cold. She says \\" what do you want me to do\\" ...\\"well \\" I say, \\" I just wanted you to know that he was really disappointed and could not eat the hash cause it was ice cold.\\"  She says , \\" well it's a Sunday and brunch is really busy. I can take half off but next time let us know and we can remake everything \\". Really???!! Really?? Well if she ever came back we could have told her! And the fact that it is a busy weekend is not excuse.... Isn't that the job of a brunch place? Cooking brunch, and serving it warm?

If only we had a time machine to prevent us from making such a big mistake and erase our memory from this horrid experience.Seeing other reviews giving Maki Maki 4+ star rating makes me think I am being a bit harsh but I can honestly say that I am not.  I will admit that from the website it showed great promise, prices about equal to Minado and the sushi selection sounded the same.  We arrived at 5pm and were the first customers for the dinner shift...for 30 minutes.  Maki Maki is smaller than Minado, sits about half, but the food layout is identical comprising of sushis to hot entrees from left to right.  Waitstaff greets you upon arrival, bring your to your seat, take a drink order then you make your way to the buffet.  I was very surprised to see that even at 5pm all the sushi was not ready yet, this would never and has never happened at Minado.  On first impression there were various sushi combinations I have never tried before which was a delight, but a great deal of what was offered for dinner was spicy.  My go-to sushi is the White, Pink and Salmon on top of rice, they were not out yet and still bring prepared so I would have to come back a little later.  So, I place my sushi and grab a fresh plate for the hot entrees, of course to two buffet restaurants have the same spread, but I was surprised how much seafood was available.  Some of the items were mislabeled, like the duck, and I found something I never thought I'd ever try before: fried frog legs.  Some of the usual fair was there: chicken wings, dumplings and beef on skewers.  Everything LOOKED good so I was hoping it lived up to reviews I read.Sadly, my hopes were all crushed after the first few bites of sushi.  I will admit that I am a bit bias because I have been a frequent regular of Minado for over 4 years.  But I have been to other smaller sushi buffets and bars with far much more flavor than here.  Nothing had an appeal or WOW factor.  Part of me wanted to get up from the table and walk out in the first few bites.  My girlfriend's reaction to the food was the same as mine, we didn't exclaim that it was bland, flat and tasteless we just shot looks at each other and we both knew we were dissatisfied.  Honestly, how do you say to the owner of a sushi buffet restaurant that their food tasted awful???  What drove me more crazy was the price.  Now, I knew that I'd be spending $30+ a person on this meal but seriously it is WAY OVER PRICED for the quality that we were served.  I didn't want to finish my plate but felt guilted into cleaning it since there was a sign saying, \\"Please don't waste food\\" by the plates.  When we finished we thought maybe the desserts would save some of the experience.  I couldn't believe even the dessert was awful!  How do you eff up dessert?!  Is that even possible?!  The chocolate fountain was something new for us but there was something about needing to dip out chocolate cover fruit in a pitcher of ice water that bothered me.  I know it was needed as a step in the process to make the chocolate harden quick but think about that during a busy food rush.  The selection of cakes/fruit were okay nothing that I haven't seen before.  However, there is more of an ice cream selection than just vanilla and green tea.  BUT you have to scoop it yourself and it is harder that it looks.  Most of the ice cream was so frozen it was very difficult to scoop out, I wanted there to be a soft serve machine there so bad.  One of the more memorable deserts was the Strawberry Moose and Oreo Chocolate Cake.  Neither of them were satisfying, the moose gave off a medicine after taste and the cake was bland and dry.  After we paid out bill $70.00 + tip we left feeling we had been robbed.  As soon as we sat down in the seats of my car my girlfriend said to me, \\"Is it bad I want to go to Minado NOW to make up for this shitty meal\\"?Anyone who is a regular of Minado DO NOT go to Maki Maki.  They offer the same concept BUT NOT the same quality of food.  Don't waste you money like I did."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Lobster roll and the red snapper crudo was amazing.

Every time I go I get the eggs Virginia Highland with the house potatoes.  It's so dang good! I've had dinner from here before, which was tasty too, but brunch is the bees knees.\\nThe first time I went I had the lavender muffins and fell in love! The baker, who does a great job every time,switches up the muffins (flavors) every week. That being said I haven't had lavender muffins since.  It would be nice if customers could join a call list and we get a call/ text when a muffin that we like or have been waiting on will be made for the week...versus me calling every week disappointed because there's no lavender. You know? Ok let's move on. The host with the fancy suit jacket and scarfs is customer service at its finest!!!! He is professional and personable. They couldn't have picked a better host, honestly. I've only had one rough waitress...everyone else has been very pleasant. I think that's pretty dang good. Parking is a total disaster, but all parking in midtown is a disaster. I recommend you catch a ride or parallel park down the street and walk. If you want to play musical for 3 parking spots in front of the restaurant...up to you. Please note: This is a bit of a tourist attraction...so go early if you can or else you will be waiting...and I do mean waiting.

The croque-monsieur sandwich is phenomenal, as are the sticky buns and scones. The cakes and jarred tiramisus are also delicious. The salads tend to be hit or miss. The salads in the fridge are more reliable in terms of quality and quantity. However, if you get a salad behind the counter, you are at the mercy of the person serving you. Sometimes they give you an excellent portion and sometimes its such a small portion that its frustrating to think you paid 5$ for it. The vietnamese rice noodle salad is the only terrible item in this establishment (uncooked noodles, poor balance of flavours on vinaigrette, no other ingredients so just a hunk of crunchy noodles) The breakfast sandwiches sort of share this issue. Most of the time, they are well made and stuffed with lots of goodies. Once in a while though, you'll get a sandwich with more bread than filling. Overall, this place is still a  great place for good quality sandwiches and desserts. Simply be wary that, once in a while, you'll get something of lesser quality than you're used to due to some quality control issues."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I used to be a regular but the insanely long wait (when will Portland finally adopt the reservation policy like a real city?!), cold hostess and inconsistent food.

Unfortunately, the hostess (typically never there or rude) is something you just have to get by.  We've never been here for brunch.  Also, there needs to be an update on their website.

I say \\"visit\\" in addition to eat because dining there is an experience. From the eccentric paintings on the wall to the trendy booths and tables, it has a big city feel while also being very comfortable and home-like. The service was incredible! The servers and bartenders were very knowledgeable of the food and wine and what pairs well together. We ended up meeting another couple there for the first time and we decided to share everything. I had the pleasure of sampling nearly everything on the menu and not one thing was lacking. The food is very high caliber. The artistic and creative talent mixed with the overwhelming flavor of each bite will leave you wanting more. While all dishes were incredible, the standouts for me were: The Sweet Corn Risotto, Scallops Ceviche, Pork Belly Adobo, Beef Short Rib, and King Crab and Shrimp Curry. I won't go into details since you can read their menu on their website but every single one of these dishes were out of this world and I felt the portion sizes were perfect for tapas. We also had a bottle of Xiloca Garnacha which went really well with most of the dishes. I can't tell you how highly I recommend this place. 5 stars doesn't do it justice. From the service to the ambiance to the food, this place is the entire package. A true foodie restaurant in Winter Park that doesn't feel pretentious in the least bit. In fact, the Executive Chef/Co-Owner even came out to check on us and asked how the dining experience was going. He was a super nice guy that has a lot of passion for what he's doing there.Trust me...GO THERE! You won't be let down.
