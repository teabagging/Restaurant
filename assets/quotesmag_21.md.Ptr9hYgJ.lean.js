I met a buddy who drove from the Dayton Area as I came from the Cleveland area. We met (somewhat) halfway, lol. By the way, I removed my truthful negative review experience here. I'm starting fresh and making this review. Most of the servers here are good and service here on last visit was great. But my last bad experience (excluding this review/good visit) or second to last? One of the two? .......caused me or spurred me to let it fly (its now a removed negative review). Long story short: I went here in noon day about 1 month from this dated last visit? I entered and sat at the bar, no busy lines or people waiting. The bar was nearly empty. I ordered one beer, and I EXPLICITLY said, \\"Hi, I'm just having ONE BEER. I'm gonna listen to a few songs (touch tunes) and take off in less than 30 minutes.\\" I was gonna meet a friend for lunch elsewhere, but she doesn't need to know this. And I also added, \\"But I was here last night, and I had a burger, a drink, and it was awesome!\\", is what I said to her (along that description). So the server walks away. So here I am on my phone trying to select a song or I was on you tube? (I forget exactly). I'm enjoying my time on my phone as I'm happily anticipating my rendezvous of a friend  while enjoying a beer. About 4 minutes have gone by, the same server comes back and asks me, \\"Do you want something to eat or order some food?\\" I'm looking at her with incredulity. I say to myself, \\"Is she for real? Do I need to close my eyes and count to three and see if this is happening?\\" So Im looking at her wondering if I'm caught up in a time warp of \\"space time continuum\\" or something like that and I said, \\"No thank you.\\" After telling her this, I was wondering what or who I was speaking to earlier after explaining what I was there for? I had to ask myself, \\"Is it illegal in Columbus,OH to order ONE BEER and listen to music for 30 minutes before taking off?\\" So I go back to my phone again watching you tube and the same server comes back to me, yet again, about 7 minutes later and asks (second time), \\"Can I get you something to eat?\\" I'm kinda looking at her, thinking to myself, would it have helped, after she asked me the first time, would it have helped if I grabbed her two ears, looked her square in the eye, and asked her, \\"What part of the description did you not get when I explained what I was here for? Was I speaking French?\\" I thought it was very rude! Extremely off putting! And very pushy! Here I am, wondering what had I done to warrant this? So I jog my memory, back track and go over my interaction with her. I wasn't rude. I complimented the food experience the prior night. I'm not taking up seats, there are no people waiting for seats................I just couldn't believe it! The only logical conclusion I'd surmise is that she was just a spiteful, rude, and malicious person that does not like seeing someone enjoy a single beer in \\"their establishment\\" for 30 minutes as they listen to music at their expense as they toil. So here I am, at this point, mildly agitated, I look at the server talking to a co worker as she now has time to chat with a co-worker................so I purposefully wave at her, so as to interrupt her (as she did me) and inquire of the menu........then she walks away............she has another break talking to her co worker again. So I look at her, and disrupt her again, and say, \\"Excuse me\\", then I inquired of the menu and asked a stupid question again of the menu. And I did it a third time. I was trying to convey through her thick skull that maybe you just ought to leave someone alone when they're just enjoying one beer in your establishment for only 30 minutes because it's not illegal. And it's not illegal for someone to enjoy one beer in your establishment that you don't like for unwarranted personal malicious reasons. On last visit, I didn't see this server there. The other servers here are good. It's ashamed one server like this can ruin it. And I'll continue to come here. Because logic dictates not all the servers are as sorry as this server was. As a matter of fact, I've decided to have one beer for 30 minutes again. And I do hope I see her again."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Great biscuits!

Now...about the whole happy hour situation I wasn't thrilled so give that 1 Star but can't let it overshadow all the other greatness. So there 1st drink I ordered was the rum mojito. Ummm Issa no! Disgusting. Tasted like club soda & mint even after stirring. I should've known from other yelp reviews but I love mojitos & wanted to try for myself. There were 2 bar staff. A younger girl & older gentleman. She was sort of quiet...and I didn't care for the guy. He talked loud & was just borderline rude. He said happy hour is over when it was only 7:30 and the website & sign clearly states until 9pm on Sunday's. Then he said he can't keep up w the waiters ordering drinks for the inside & the bar outside & that his manager said he shouldn't be taking drink orders for us to go back inside. Ok, but some of my party sat outside watched the game & even orders oysters & lamb out there & watched the game. His whole vibe was off! He still let me order another drink & was like this is going to be your last round ok? So that was that. My least favorite part! The drinks I did like were sex n the city & lemon drop (both martinis)\\nWe sat in the pacific room. Very nice on the back of the restaurant. Good for lg parties or private parties. And Brian...wow.

The dining area is open to the kitchen which exposes a large flame used for the wood fired dishes.  \\nWe started with the deviled eggs and Alex's salad.   Both were terrific.  The salad was fresh and crisp, and taken to another level by the champagne vinaigrette dressing.  The eggs were topped with sugar-cured bacon. Bacon makes everything better.

You'd think consistency would be a fairly easy, but sometimes the only thing consistent about restaurants are their high turnover rates in staff. \\n\\n$9 The Reggie | The sausage gravy is the same consistency, an ideal middle ground between soupy and stand-a-fork-in-it. The gravy has a sort of savory soy sauce flavor with a plethora of sausage bits running amok through the desert sand color. Even when the biscuit is cut in half, it remains hardy enough to withhold the gravy. The bottom biscuit layer absorbs a layer of gravy, then fried chicken, bacon, cheddar cheese, gravy and then the biscuit lid. The biscuit in its entirety does not get soggy and fall apart, it willingly accepts the gravy smothering. You're not going into this mouth first, it's a knife and fork sandwich. Or, a spoon and fork sandwich, depending on where you come from. \\n\\nThe only teeny tiny thing I'd change, the floppy bacon.

Most times I find that places that are considered \\"classy casual\\" are way more hype (read:expensive) than they need to be but I actually ended up being pleased with the food and service that our party received.  It has a nice layout, but is not the place to go if you want to be slightly loud.  Maybe the bar area is louder than the dining room, but I kept feeling like I needed to lower my voice in the dining room. \\n\\nI viewed the menu beforehand, and wasn't impressed with the $20+ entrees and even less so with the $15+ salads.  I understand that its all farm fresh etc, but I'm under the impression that should make it a little cheaper.\\n\\nOur waitress, Sarah, was new and went over the 5 minute spill of the restaurant specials and all the other stuff I tuned out since I had made up my mind before going of what I was going to order.  She was super nice and very knowledgeable of the restaurant in the short time she has worked there. \\n\\nI went with the Oysters ($11), which technically is a shared plate item and mashed potatoes ($6) which is a side item and is not sold together as an entree.  That was the only thing on the entire menu that appealed to me, and both were fantastic.  I received 6 oysters (which makes me wonder how this is a shared plate) and a nice amount of mashed potatoes.\\n\\nSomeone else in my party had the Spinach and Sausage meatloaf, she'd been here before and had that dish, and was familiar with it so, that was an easy selection for her and she was pleased with it this time also.  Another person had the Roasted Mountain chicken, and I was quite impressed with the size of the chicken breast and she stated that it was flavored very well.  Our server had described it as \\"African\\" flavored, and neither of us knew what that meant, but the person that had it said that it was like curry flavored, but not really curry tasting.  I'm still lost.  Another had the brisket which came with mashed potatoes and a vegetable mixture, she'd eaten it before I got done with my six oysters, so I have to give that a plus based on her. \\n\\nSince it was two people in our party birthday, (mines and my friends) we asked about birthday desserts and was told that we could choose two, which we did.  There was no mention at that time that it wasn't complimentary, so I was surprised to see it at half price on my tab.  I had the grilled pound cake and was not only mesmerize at how pretty it was displayed, but it was also VERY tasty.  The amount of peaches I received on the dessert allowed me to give each person in our party at least 2-3 to taste.  The other birthday person had the Mocha cake.  It also was displayed beautifully, but was super rich in taste.  Its like death by chocolate to the tenth power.  \\n\\nThe winner of the evening was the cucumber martinis ($15), which are not on the menu, but Sarah asked the bartender to make me one and she did, and it was better than any other I've had this summer, so I suggested to her that she tells those in charge to put that on the menu.\\n\\nThe only complaint I have,  was I asked for extra cucumbers, and she came back and said the bartender said she was out of cucumbers, which is probably unlikely since they have a drink on the menu that includes cucumbers (Green Machine) and when I initially asked about a cucumber flavored drink, both the waitress at the bar and Sarah suggested that particular drink to me, so I doubt they all of sudden ran out of cucumbers after two cucumber martinis.  I would think if someone spent $30 on two drinks, they should be able to have all the cucumber garnish they like from a place that is \\"local farm supplied\\".\\n\\nI wouldn't make plans to go back, but would consider it if someone invite me."},{"name":"Yuko Maki Sushi","address":"1540 Lonsdale Ave","city":"North Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"I tried this Sushi through Skip the Dishes app and everything was fresh and nicely packed, also tasty and good selection of fish.

Vegetarians - this place is great for veggie options, they have veggie chorizo and veggie breakfast sausage...but I'm not vegetarian so that's all I will mention about that. \\n\\nI stacked my scramble with jalapenos, cheese, onions, spicy sausage, and whatever else I'm forgetting. It was super good! The ingredients are well dispersed throughout the scramble so I was able to get everything in every bite throughout the entire scramble journey. The jalapenos are fresh so you get that kick of spicy every now and again, and I also got the caramelized onions which I found to be a nice touch. I liked eating the scramble with jam and their house made salsa - just my style, but my friend did not agree. The hashbrowns exceeded my expectations. They were not only crispy and perfect, but they had some flavor on their own. We also got the lemon ricotta pancake to try and we were so focused on the scramble we barely ate it, but it tasted good from the bite I had. \\n\\nThe service here is also great! I will acknowledge that this may not be representative of how the service operates on their busy weekends, but I feel like it wouldn't be far off. My friend got avocados on her scramble and one slice fell on the floor. One of the people saw and brought us an entire cup of chopped avocados.

The Covington Mill's breakfast buffet at the Hilton-Orlando Lake Buena Vista proved to be the perfect place to do that. Since I was last at the Covington Mill back in 2011, I thought it looked the same as before, with a casual and clean atmosphere. Within two minutes, my waitress, Ya-Ling, came to my table. She was very friendly and efficient. I ordered an orange juice and coffee for my beverages as well as turkey bacon or turkey sausage, since I do not eat pork bacon or pork sausage due to my triglyceride issues. When I called the Covington Mill before my trip to see if they had an alternative to pork bacon or sausage available, they did indeed and thankfully, my waitress told me that turkey sausage was available at no charge, so turkey sausage it was! Since the turkey sausage would be a few minutes as they needed to cook it, I went to the buffet, where I got a plate of grits, breakfast potatoes, and a grilled tomato with cheddar. It was a great start, as the grits were creamy and slightly salty, the breakfast potatoes, which were cut in a circular fashion and served with tomatoes and scallions, were salty, earthy, and a little greasy (in a good way), and the grilled tomato was sweet with sharp cheddar cheese. In addition, the coffee was robust and the orange juice was sweet and tangy. It was definitely an excellent start to my breakfast! My waitress then came by to refill my OJ and coffee, as they were running a little low. While I was eating, I could not help but notice that Khadijah (spelling?), another waitress was working a different section. I remember her from my 2011 stay at the Hilton as she also provided excellent service and according to some TripAdvisor reviews, many other people feel the same. When she came by, I said hello and to my surprise, she actually remembered me somewhat. We had a great time chatting with each other, mostly about my trip and in addition, it was pretty cool to see a face from the past! After chatting with Khadijah, I got some more breakfast potatoes and a grilled tomato with cheddar. Finally, for my last course, I got some sweet and refreshing fruit salad as well as a banana. I would definitely dine at the Covington Mill again if I were staying at the Hilton as the food was delicious, the service was excellent, and the price at about $20 for the buffet was not a bad value."},{"name":"Narcoossee's","address":"4401 Grand","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This was another Disney restaurant that I've been wanting to check off my list.

The food is really average at best and the menu is incredibly simplistic, even by Italian chain standards.  Based on their childish menu and indoor trolley, I'm frankly surprised they even call it \\"pasta\\" instead of just \\"noodles\\".   \\n\\nIt's not the worst, though.  If you look at the price for the meals, it's not a bad deal for what is included -- you get your entree plus bread, soup or salad, a non-soda drink (tea, coffee or milk) and some ice cream for about $10.  Look at comparably priced places like Little Azio, Figo or Artuzzi's and you'll only get the entree and maybe some bread for that price, and those places typically don't have full waiter service.  Even Eats, which is known for cheap pasta, would cost more for a set of comparable items.  Granted, those places have more diverse menus and generally better food (depending on the dish), but it's one mitigating factor.  I'd rather have the better quality pasta only, but I can put up with OSF every once in a while.\\n\\nAs far as their food goes -- as I mentioned earlier, it's average at best and often below average.  I never had a very good salad there, and the minestrone is at least edible.  The bread is pretty tasteless, though when I go someone in a group typically orders some cheese bread to share.  The cheese bread is tasty, but not enough for me to pay extra for it.   For an entree, I generally get their Crab Ravioli or Spinach and Cheese Ravioli, which is perfectly fine, but their sauces are pretty basic and taste like they come out of a can.  I tend to get those because ravioli is one type of pasta which most of the other cheap pasta places do not have (except Figo).\\n\\nAnyway, I'll go here occasionally if other people want to go (it tends to be in the rotation in a group I attend), but if I were choosing something of my own volition I'd never just want to go to OSF."},{"name":"Oviedo Brewing Company","address":"1280 Oviedo Mall Blvd, Ste 1095","city":"Oviedo","stars":"4","text":"Wow this place already has it together even though it just opened recently.

It is on a huge yacht/boat, with three (or more?)  floors and a rooftop..in Orlando!? I had to try it out. My husband and I made a reservation for a late lunch on a Sunday afternoon which was a great time to go. I wanted to sit on the rooftop but it doesn't open until 5pm. It was pretty hot anyways, I wouldn't go up there until nighttime in fall or winter. We got sat by a one of their huge windows to see the lake...the view was gorgeous! \\n\\nThis is mostly a seafood place but their are quite a few options for non-seafood eaters. I tried the magical dining menu beauce this place is very pricy otherwise. I chose the clam chowder which is made in house but could have been better. For my entree I had the Shrimp and Grits which was very good. Very seasoned and the cheese grits...yess! My husnand had the filet and it was cooked well and came with mashed potatoes. Our server Mimi was fantastic, she was very honest and gave great recommendations. Except for the dessert Lol, she recommended the carrot cake which wasn't good so I took it back and got the strawberry shortcake, which wasn't great either. For their prices, the food really could be better. \\n\\nNow the reason you want to visit here is the views! The rooftop has cute couches and string lights for a great night out. I would come back when the weather is cooler for drinks, appetizers, and the ambiance. For the price I don't think a full dinner is worth it, but for some drinks on the rooftop and for the experience it's nice."},{"name":"West End Grill","address":"63 Mazzeo Dr","city":"Randolph","stars":"4","text":"Excellent bar pizza, staff is the super friendly and attentive.

Did you know they have Abita Root Beer!(I think they will make you a float for desert). We celebrated father's day at this delightfully funky place just south of the freeway on Tremont St. Jameel took great care of us as we navigated through the cucumber smash, the Brussels sprouts and cauliflower saut√© and although they did not have the crawfish mac n cheese(we will be back), my son was more than satisfied with his fried clam po-boy.  It was too much food as my daughter couldn't finish the savory and spicy Crab and Shrimp boil with added andouille for good measure,  as the portions were generous and hearty, enough for two.

I was originally very excited about the Brian's Hash Dish, but found that no substitutions can be made for that or any other hash dish because they've already made a large batch and can't make a special version for those allergic to dairy (due to the sauce and cheese). \\n\\nInstead, I ordered one oatmeal chai blueberry pancake and a side of hashbrowns. The hashbrowns are perfectly crisped and so yummy, even though they aren't cooked in butter. The chai blueberry pancake has no dairy in it and was bursting with delicious flavor. The pancake was covered in blueberries cooked into the batter and you could really taste the chai. The oatmeal consistency wasn't ideal and required a bit more syrup than I'd normally use to eat the pancake, but it still so so good! One is probably enough if you're also getting other things as they pancake is pretty big, but if that's all you want to eat that day then definitely go for the full order which comes with two!"},{"name":"Ardens Garden","address":"3113 Main St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Great friendly fast service.

From the start, Trey our waiter, was half-baked in his approach and service. Informing me allergic reactions tend to be blamed on the server. After all of the interrogation, the lobster bisque was just okay compared to other upscale seafood restaurants, the fish and chips weren't seasoned well, and it took nearly 40 minutes to get both. The request for no cheese atop the fried green tomatoes was another ordeal. Explained that no cheese was a choice not an allergy. These folks have CLEARLY had a pretty hefty lawsuit in the past.

Would have been better if they would have thought of a proper design of the interior to handle the traffic pattern as people are crowding the front entrance area waiting to get a drink at the bar as its smack dab by the entrance as soon as you walk in.  I took one star off my rating because they had too many IPA's and removed another star because their Kieran Barley Wine beer in a 750 ml bottle was being sold for $19 but they actually sell it at Whole Foods for $15...makes no sense to me.  However, they must have stopped selling it at Whole Foods as I haven't seen it there for the past month.  When we left around 4:00pm, there was a long line of people waiting to get in so we were lucky we arrived before people started lining up.  Overall, a very nice brewery with some good beers."},{"name":"Biryani Corner Indian Food Carryout Place","address":"1381 Bethel Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Normally I write reviews after trying food at any place couple of times.

We did not arrive at the restaurant after-hours or when it was posted as being closed, so yes, we did expect it to be open in the middle of the dinner service on a Saturday night. Normally, a business's hours of operations are just that. And I do not expect this review to \\"show\\" them anything because that would imply some sense of receptivity, which we are clearly not working with here. Rather, the point was to share my experience so far, which the owner's response sums up quite nicely.  \\n\\nOriginal Review:\\nThis review does not reflect the food, as I have not had a chance to try it. Rather, it's a reflection of my experience so far, which has been made up of an unannounced cancellation of their dinner service on a Saturday evening (save a sign on the door) and a tone deaf response from the owner when a complaint was made. I've worked for a lot of family-owned restaurants and deal primarily in customer service; I don't leave poor reviews because I prefer to to give a business the benefit of the doubt or vote with my dollar. But replying to a valid complaint with an unprofessional and unproductive comment destroyed my interest in trying a place I had been looking forward to for weeks.

This has got to be the most famous restaurant in Boston and a must-go for anyone visiting. Notorious for its' (at least) 2 hour wait no matter what time you go, Neptune Oyster lives up to its' name. I came here the day before Labor Day and trust me, if you are coming to visit for any holiday.. you better get ready to line up AND WAIT! **Note that you cannot make reservations through the phone**, I arrived at around 3:30pm and was put on the waitlist, at this time.. the wait was approximately FIVE TO SIX HOURS! Yes, FIVE TO SIX HOURS and that is not a typo!! Funny thing is that while I was lining up to put my name on the list, people who lined up at around 11:00am were coming to check what # they were on the list since they had not been seated yet... yes, crazy day. They called me at around 8:30pm that same day to let me know my table was about to be ready and I had 10 minutes to arrive at the restaurant.\\n \\nThe interior of this place is small, for the large volume of customers they bring in.. it would be a really good investment if they had a larger space.. but anyways! Most of the time if you are a party of 2.. you'll be seated at the bar and the wait is also significantly less. If you are a larger party such as mine which was a party of 4, you'll be seated at a table joined by others. Most of the tables are side by side. Anyways, aside from the space.. the restaurant is very nicely decorated and clean.. I appreciate the marble tables and the guy preparing the oysters in the front window really reels in everyone who hasn't heard about this place through Food Network or some other recommendation show/list/website.\\n \\nEverything on the menu is pretty much market price, which means that it'll vary day by day. I decided to try the clam chowder, lobster roll and three different kinds of oysters but I forget the names. The oysters came out first and.. just.. absolutely amazing. Probably best oysters I've had in my entire life and most enjoyable part of the dinner. The clam chowder was less creamy than I expected it to be, the flavor was sub-par and so was the portion. I hear this place is supposed to have the best lobster rolls in the area but honestly.. it wasn't that great to me. It has less mayo than I typically like my lobster rolls to have, the bread was.. standard. I'm pretty sure they put an entire lobster inside those two little buns which is great and generous. The fries were not crunchy at all which was disappointing. For $30 a roll, it truly was underwhelming.\\n \\nIf I come back and they tell me to wait ~2 hours, I think I would give this place another go.. they have truly great oysters.

They taste like someone who cannot bake made a pound cake in an EZ Bake oven and put blood orange /chocolate/vanilla/etc. cr√®me on it. I tasted quite a few varieties because we had a dozen and each one was different ( we were on another one of my tasting missions, my husband hates me!

I like the bar area particularly because there's a lot of seating on a non game night and you can't go wrong with the multiple televisions they have too. The owner of the place is extremely nice and friendly. The waiters that we've had are all awesome and attentive; I enjoy the prompt service, professionalism and patience they have to cultivate the dining experience that's positive and makes people come back! \\n\\nFood\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n\\nAppetizers that I love: \\n-Buffalo Chicken Tenders with extra blue cheese \\nThey're breaded to perfection and are not overly spicy where your tongue goes numb.\\n-Spinach and Artichoke Dip with tortillas\\nThis dip is particulary creamy and rich. I couldn't get enough of it!!\\n\\nEntrees that Rock:\\n-You like steak? Get the steak tip dinner with whatever sides you want that's offered. Personally, I enjoy steak cooked medium and they really know how to do it right here! My friend, Michelle, was happy with it one night when she copied my exact same order.\\n-Chicken Cutlet Sandwich with buffalo sauce is a big portion and fills my bf up everytime...he loves buffalo sauce way too much so buffalo sauce lovers will enjoy this sandwich.\\n\\nDesserts:\\nWhatever they are offering for that night, is ridiculously delicious and scrumptious. Their cheesecake is better than The Cheesecake Factory because i think it's made with love...very filling. My bf and I shared their raspberry lemon cheesecake (share is the key word) because it's huge! I loved every bite and half was enough.\\n\\nThose are my favorites from West End Grill....what's yours?"},{"name":"Golden Eagle","address":"904 Memorial Dr SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"One of my favorite cocktail bars in Atlanta.

I should preface this by saying we used the carry out option & did not dine in due to the fact we have babies at home. Our experience started off badly when we couldn't get anyone to answer the phone for a carry out order. Instead of waiting we decided to drive over and make it in person. We placed our order (1 jason's burger, a side of fries, pretzel bites and a thin crust pizza) and were told 25 minutes. We came back roughly 30 minutes later and were told they were finishing up. We saw a few people come in behind us to pick up their orders and noticed they had ordered after us...so we asked the front desk if they forgot our order or what happened since it was now 45 minutes and people kept picking up food that ordered after us. He said they only had one cook and that's why it was delayed. We were getting pretty annoyed at this point because our order wasn't even large and he wasn't doing anything to remedy the situation. Finally after about an hour and 15 minutes he brings us our food (when we were quoted 25 minutes). We get home and it's cold which probably means it was done awhile ago. We proceeded to call the manager to file our complaint who then disregarded us on the phone and was talking to an employee while listening to us.

It turned out their printer broke, so my ticket didn't get printed to be made up. They were good enough to give me a filled-up punchcard (12 visits and your 13th visit is free, so it had 12 punches in it; keep this in mind), but it messed me up on being able to eat lunch between errands and appointments. Just this weekend I was in the area and figured it'd be a good use of that punchcard, so I went through the drive-thru, where I was told (via the speaker) to come to the window to place my order.\\n\\nThere's no menu at the window, so luckily since it was just me I only had the one thing to remember and thankfully the guy taking my order walked through all the other options. When I went to pay, I handed him the punchcard, he punched a 13th hole in it (which was to indicate that it was my 13th visit and therefore my meal should be free), handed it back to me and told me my total was $8.something. I said this should be free because the punchcard was full, and he told me I could use it next time. I was pissed and should have driven off, but handed him my credit card anyway and figured I'd just give the punchcard to somebody else that needed it more than I did. \\n\\nMy order was readied quickly but was handed to me by someone else, and when he said, \\"oh yeah you wanted a water right?\\" I went ahead and asked him about the punchcard again and explained why I had it and that it was the only reason I'd come in.

While the cafe doesn't look that impressive from outside, the inside is extremely cute. One thing that bothered me was that there were four people in front of me and it took me forty minutes to get to the register. There were only two people working and they were also making the orders/serving people so I definitely think they were understaffed. Seating was also very limited and we got lucky that a table cleared up right as we ordered otherwise there were people standing around with their food looking for a place to sit when we first got in. Maybe it was just an off day but I did like the food. I even got a sandwich to eat for lunch later in the day. I recommend this place to my friends and will probably go back some time."},{"name":"WUBurger Gourmet","address":"1128 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"I've been really curious about WUBurger ever since I saw a picture of their burgers and thought they looked really similar to Shake Shack's. As a huge fan of Shake Shack, I just had to do a final taste test today.\\n\\nI ordered the classic WUBurger with grilled onions and a side salad. Overall a very solid burger, though it missed on a few points. I loved that the bun was super soft and exactly the same as Shake Shack's. The burger patties were a bit under-seasoned, but were still satisfying. I wish they had an option on the menu with just one patty instead of two - two is a bit much in my opinion. Also, maybe it was because I added grilled onions to the burger, but there was a bit too much grease - some of it dripped out of the burger and made a small pool of oil on my plate. \\n\\nReally great service and nice interior, and would definitely be up for trying out some of their other menu options.

We tried the majority of the things on the menu, and all were very good.  We started off by splitting four appetizers.  The lump crab wontons were delicious. Nice and crispy, very flavorful. The pork cheek poutine was fanastic.  The duck confit spring rolls were great, and that's coming from someone who doesn't particularly care for duck. The sweet potato chips weren't my favorite, as they're sliced a little thin for my tastes (like, translucent thin), but the ancho-agave dip is great.\\n\\nMy salad was good, but it was a pretty standard caprese salad.  My friend enjoyed her gazpacho, so plenty of solid soup and salad options.\\n\\nThe main course was the star of the show.  I had a tender and juicy on-the-bone pork chop on top of bacon grits and andouille sausage coins, covered in jalapeno-peach jam.  It was smoky, a little spicy, a little salty, and very delicious.  Very generous portion size too--my wife and I ended up splitting it and we both got plenty to eat.\\n\\nDessert was rich and decadant. We had smores, but with crumbled peanut butter cups and spicy peanuts added.  Went quite nicely with a glass of port.\\n\\nThe drinks were pretty good too.  The pineapple mojito wasn't as pineappley as I expected, but it was still very good.  The Manhattan was just okay.  Not bad, but I think there were other things on the menu that were better.  The jefe sour may have been the best of the bunch.  Bourbon, simple syrup, and lemon with a red wine float.  Tart, fruity, and a little boozy.  Great.\\n\\nService was very good.  We had a friendly and attentive waiter, and our food came very quickly -- probably in part because, inexplicably, nobody was here on a Thursday night.  I hope business is going well and that was just an uncharacteristic slow night, because the food really is fantastic.\\n\\nBeautiful space, both inside and out.  The inside is very clean and contemporary.  The outside has a beautiful patio, and either would be a pleasant dining atmosphere.\\n\\nDefinitely come check out Trillium.

The menu is somewhat limited and you are dining al fresco on picnic tables and folding chairs. But, all in all, it was good. The pasta was clearly made fresh that day and the toppings were as well. I went for the Great Leopold, which was a good pesto pasta. The sauce covered the pasta well - it wasn't creamy or heavy on the liquid (which is sometimes the downfall of pesto sauces).

Banning cash is not a fair policy. That has to change. I also feel it is a system that not only refuses service to people without a credit card on them at the time, whether they have personal accounts or not, this system is also complicit in the recent trend in forcing a certain percentage of tipping from all customers before you even experience any service or food.  The only service this shop provides is the preparation of the food and taking the payment which should have been priced to provide a profit for the business.  In this particular model, you place your order at a counter, you get your own utensils and seat yourself, you pick up your food at the counter, you bus your table before leaving. I did not see a single staff member even wipe a used table. Many other quick casual eateries in Boulder provide some services, some nicely provide everything but taking your order.  I also object to paying a \\"tip\\" upfront though I am happy to tip for service at my own discretion at the end of the meal. There are other places with more patron friendly credit card  software. Politics over.\\n\\nThe place is cute, decor modern and cleanly trendy. The food we had was fresh and tasty and very fruity. We had the Avocado Toast and the Orange Creamsicle Bowl. The avocado was fresh and bright but I felt the truffle oil was a bit overpowering so if I get it again I will ask them to leave it out. The orange bowl was very coconutty though overall very tasty, especially the raspberry chia jam. One thing that is a problem for me at many fruit bowl establishments is that they lean very heavily on banana, mango and various forms of coconut, none of which I regularly eat, since I have some mild mango allergy and don't enjoy the other two, both being such strong flavors that are hard to balance. So I look hard for a√ßa√≠, citrus and grain options that are more unique.\\n\\nPS.

Well, we can bring a random bottle of wine in, have Steve (or one of his other employees) taste it, and then ask them to pair cheeses to it. And boy, we've scored some crazy good cheese pairings doing that. And the best part? If you buy at least one bottle of wine, they comp the corkage fee on the bottle you bring in. And you'll find that his wine prices compete with those at local wine shops (with a couple bucks tacked on for drinking in-house). None of this wine-bar style \\"double the price\\" BS. \\n\\nSo come on in.

These are my gateway beers into the craft brew world. In 2009 I went to Boston and visited the Sam Adams brewery, the first of now over a hundred that I've been to. \\n\\nAfter a short walk from the train stop we arrived and went on the tour. Now I can recite to you what will be said in most brewery tours, they all follow the same recipe. Come look at the giant tanks that we boil the malt and hops in, it's now called mash. By the way, beer is 4 ingredients- water, malt, yeast, hops. Did you know about the German beer law? Here's a malt taste it, here's a hop smell it. Look at all of our barrels of beer storing and here's some history of our company, in this case Jim Cook. Now this being the first tour I've ever done, I was actually very entertained and learned quite a bit.\\n\\nFast forward to the tasting room. The trick here is to go with at least a few people who don't drink beer. Seeing as I went with a bunch of Asian people who get the Asian glow (allergic reaction to alcohol), that way I got at least 2 glasses of each beer. I can't remember how many beers I had for some reason... but I recall part of the line up was Boston lager, Boston ale, Octoberfest, cherry wheat, cream stout, and maybe their light. All of their beers are solid and easily accessible to all beer drinkers. The rest of my time at the brewery is fuzzy so let's end my story here.\\n\\nIf you are interested in beer but don't know where to start, this is a great first step into craft beer.

It's absolutely delicious with an authentic Japanese flavor throughout. Ramen Ciro easily takes the #1 spot for ramen in Portland, which was formally held by Aiko Ramen's Tonkotsu ramen in my book.\\n\\nI ordered the Kara Miso ramen at a spicy level 3 and it was fantastic. The broth was well balanced and I loved how the heat slowly crept up on me. The spicy level was medium and didn't overpower the miso flavor.

The soup had a clear apple flavor with ever bite and the top crust gave it a good texture. As for the tart the onions were cooked well and had a very good sweetness. Along with the flakey light tart itself. As for main course the beef bourgignon with duchess potatoes was a very classic representation of a beef bourgignon. Very tender beef with a rich dark sauce. Plus the vegetables weren't overcooked and still had a bite to it. The coq au vin chicken With buttered egg noodles was great as well. The noodles get coated in the sauce that makes it a great pairing with the chicken. As for dessert I had the crepe and creme brulee. The grand marnier sauce with the crepe was needed to cut the sweetness and it brought a well rounded dessert. The creme brulee is a classic and yes I did get a good crack from the top. Not too sweet it paired well with the champagne. And you can really taste the vanilla since they used vanilla pods. \\n\\nOverall I give this restaurant a 4/5."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Don't shoot me!

Yeah these are bitchin' doughnuts, but some of them are around $3/each.  You could get like three Mickey D's burgers for that kind of money.  If you're going to eat three drive-thru burgers, you're probably not the intended clientele here, but when you're trying to do something nice for your coworkers and you grab some doughnuts, it's kind of insane to drop that much, uh, dough.  And for some reason it takes forever to put doughnuts in boxes.  I don't really mind since everyone there is fun to talk to, but there were many audible sighs coming from the line this past Saturday, and they weren't all from me.  Oh also I love doughnuts but they're not really a meal and they're kind of too big to be a snack/treat.

You may think the price is high, but Narcoossee's in general isn't cheap - it's one of Disney's \\"signature\\" restaurants so the price is pretty on point. For that price you get a pastry basket for the table, an appetizer, entree, and a dessert trio (three individual-sized sweets). The price also includes Prosecco, Bloody Mary, or mimosas (only the mimosas are unlimited, the other cocktails you're limited to one). There's also a special smoothie available for the kids - as well as standard coffee and soft drinks.\\n\\nThe pastries were carblicious, and for my app I decided on the shrimp and grits.

A tiny, crowded, awesome place.\\n\\nCafe seems a stretch. By every obvious criteria, this is a bar. 7 booths, 3 two tops and a dozen barstools in a narrow space with just amazing burgers, other sandwiches (and a few hot dogs) and a strong beer selection including some local microbrew offerings. Don't sleep on the apps either, the beer cheese pretzels are phenomenal and the fried cheese curds are really good also. The Thurman Cafe's claim to fame, though, is the broad selection of hamburgers cooked to order. And they don't shy away from your preference if your preference is medium or cooler like some places do. The Thurman is neighborhoody, familiar even if you are from out of town (like me) and about as pretentious as a box of moonpies and a six-pack of RC. It fits like the ballcap you've had for twenty years and broken in like the glove that goes with it. You've been here... even if you've never been here  And you love it. \\n\\nPark on the street, get your name in early because it doesn't matter what day or time you go there, you are probably going to wait.

However, because my wife and I were willing to sit at the bar or in the aisle tables our wait time was less than a 1/2 hour.\\n\\nWe started with the Macedonian fries which were crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  They supported the toppings of feta, onions, banana peppers, and an Italian dressing that surprisingly went really well with the fries.  These are more of a fork food rather than fingers, and none of them went to waste.  I had the bleu cheese burger with bacon.  The burger was as huge as advertised, and the toppings were great and plentiful.  The only knock for my entire meal was that they cooked it well when I requested medium.  Not getting the temperature right on beef is enough for me to knock off a star anywhere.  I still enjoyed my meal though.\\n\\nThe star of the visit was the service.  Since it's a collective effort by the staff, we never had waits for drinks or a shortage of folks checking in on us.

I had to ask two different people for a refill on my bone dry drink which took about 10 minutes. The food was OK at best, although you could tell the appetizer sampler has sat in the window for quite some time: the celery was shriveled and cooked and the sauces all had a hard layer on the surface.

The last time I was in there the same waitress was a little impatient with my mom who had Alzheimer's,, but I overlooked it because she didn't realize. but, this time I was alone, and having a tough time as it was..

I'm extremely understanding of waitresses as my mother was one for 17 years. Anyway, I asked for extra cranberry sauce as I got half a chicken dinner which requires a bit more  .I also ordered food to go.  I got the bill I questioned why it was a dollar more and her response was the cranberry sauce. To which I responded, but you said it came with the meal? Response?..., \\"yes but when you ask for extra and I HAVE TO GO BACK AND FORTH FOR IT It's a dollar more\\".! I was taken aback but politely said , I'm sorry, I didn't realize that.to which  she responded quote \\"well I didn't know that YOU didn't know that\\"! \\nWOW \\n  So ,it's not the extra dollar at all.  it's that attitude!!!, it's NOT the first time she's had one..

It was different than most other horchatas (that typically have a cinnamon flavor).  Well, Apatzingan disappeared, and I had resigned myself that I would never experience that style of horchata again.  \\n\\nThat is, up until this week when I pulled up to coral-colored Aprisa for lunch.  Lo and behold, here I found my beloved horchata.  \\n\\n Aprisa is a drive-through, not a restaurant, though there is a canopy-covered picnic table or two on the corner of the property.  This was the first time I've been through a drive through and they had a live image of the person taking my order.  I don't know if they had a camera pointed at me and could see my mug.\\n\\nSo in addition to the horchata, I wanted a torta (sandwich) but they were out of torta bread, so I went with a chicken burrito and a side of \\"Krustos\\".  I love how all food is stamped \\"Aprisa\\".  And I mean everything; each and every chip in the Krustos order was stamped!   \\n\\nThe burrito was very good.  In addition to the spicy charred Cajun/Southwest-style chicken, the burrito contained white rice, pinto beans, grilled onions and tiny bits of lettuce.  It was huge, and for the price, a great deal.\\n\\nJP wondered about the dessert's name \\"Krustos\\".  When he snacked on them at home, he thought they were bu√±uelos.  The Krustos/ bu√±uelos are tortilla chips drizzled with something sweet (maple syrup or honey?) and served with a most excellent almond dip (that really does contain sliced almonds).

Her excuse is always that she's just being a typical Jewish mom (her words). Take it from me: there's nothing Jewish or motherly about being horrible to your staff. Treat them with respect and they'll stay. Unfortunately her horrendous attitude is starting to manifest itself in high turnover and inability to staff all three of her locations. The staff that stay are clearly feeling the pressure as they too are often short with or rude to customers. Every year, at least twice a year, the owner makes a public cry for help because she's so desperate for employees. And yet, despite all that, she still isn't the problem, it's just blamed on some nebulous concept of \\"lazy millennials\\" who \\"don't want to work hard\\". An easy scapegoat. Keep that up and you'll be down to one location and working by yourself seven days a week really quickly. \\n\\nThe food used to be great. It's now inconsistent at best. Bagels are hard and stale. They skimp on toppings, even cream cheese is rationed. Cinnamon buns and apple honey rugoleh used to be the stars of the show, a reason to come back... they're now bland and sad. Pre-packaged soups and broths in the fridge next to the cash register were comforting and nostalgic, now they look like they've been sitting there for a decade. Counters and tables were dirty and the floor looked as if it had a thin layer of greasy dust. Not good.\\n\\nThe other reviews here speak for themselves. There are plenty of great delis around the city that have good food and don't treat their staff worse than garbage. There are a few good lessons here for the owner.

Umami punch and well-balanced flavors. Restrained elegance that never becomes precious, and occasionally displays a sense of humor. Aesthetic control of the visual without appearing forced. Attentive service that is simultaneously unhurried. A solid value. \\n\\nSome very good restaurants land a few of these desirables. In the Portland food scene, two of those will garner much press. But how many establishments manage all six?\\n\\nIchiza Tea House is that rare bird for which you can long seek a glimpse. And once spotted, you hesitate to spread the news--especially since tables are few, and sometimes too much positive buzz can gnaw away at the finer points of proper craftsmanship. You know, to handle the crowds, a small series of shortcuts is taken and to care for the throngs, a harried focus loses sight of why the people arrived in the first place. \\n\\nIt is hard to be successful. \\n\\nThat said, we are not there yet. Certainly on a somewhat late Tuesday afternoon lunch, I was the only one there. As soon as I entered, I had the sense I was in good hands. It's the smell that first greets you in restaurants which care. Clean. Healthy. Enticing. In a small kitchen barely hidden behind some shoji, the nose can't be fooled and the honesty of the cooks is instantly communicated in the air. \\n\\nNone of this makes me want to describe even a single dish. Like a spoiler alert, I want you to discover each item on your own, like walking among rare botanics. \\n\\nTo describe the dishes seems unnecessary on this 13 item menu. Go with three other friends and order everything. \\n\\nBut I feel some duty to those of you reading up on this stellar, completely vegan restaurant. \\n\\nSo let's have at it. \\n\\nIron warrior monk tea, served gongfu style, with an appropriately attractive gongfu draining tray. This highly oxidized oolong is like a malty, earthier ti kuan yin (iron goddess oolong). The first cuppings have the requisite floral element, even a first flush darjeeling aroma of distant apricots. The water comes in a vacuum pot and is at proper temperature for a black oolong. \\n\\nAccompanying the tea? \\n\\nChili Oil wontons, delicate as flowers perched around a small lake of a chunky korean chili sauce with a relish like consistency. \\n\\nCheung fun noodle, chopped into four squares stuffed with an effective vegan shrimp and finished with a ground pork topping that provides a yang contrast to the mellow comfort of the broad rice noodles. \\n\\nYue Choy greens, flat-griddled and enhanced with dark soy and toasted garlic, tinged with a sweetness that is fully controlled and which is there to extract the sugars in this dark chlorophyll chinese green. \\n\\nLet's not forget the whimsy of the Ba Wan Buns, tapioca starch dumplings wrapped around shitake, bamboo and pork, then  steamed in precious rabbit shaped molds. These bunnies then nestle on a field of red, a tomato based chili sauce, while they seemingly nibble at a bush of micro-greens. Precious. \\n\\nI could offer a few quibbles about the aesthetic choices of some very high end flavor balancing issues, but now we are arguing about angels on the head of a pin and you can form your own food theologies if you must.

Yes, Chef Colin Lynch loves Japanese food enough to actually fly this fish in weekly from Japan to create an amazing crudo section on this Italian focused menu. The crudo tasting is the best way to go, allowing you to taste 6 crudos for $30 which are all very creative and delicious, even if you aren't a big raw fish person. Personally, this was the only app I needed, but I was also lucky enough to try the octopus, which was perfectly grilled and flavored simply but tastily. Now on to the pasta. The Pappardelle - served al dente with savory braised rabbit, peas and olives that combine into a light but entirely satisfying main course, a MUST in my opinion. The Bucatini - served in a thick spicy red sauce that was OH so good! I also tried the Tortelli which didn't stand the test next to these other two, in my opinion.

The chicken soup look disgusting with sharp chicken bones and milky broth. I ordered a plate of rice with crispy roast pork and roasted duck. And my friend ordered a plate of rice with chicken, liver and bbq pork. Both plates consisted of super thin cut of meat. The crispy roast pork was unacceptable due to no seasoning like boiled pork and fall off chewy skin (not crispy like the name). The bbq pork was like boiled pork, hard like rocks, with no flavor at all. Same for the duck meat. Very thin and no flavor. Instead of chicken liver, we got chicken gizzards and they smell bad.

We came relatively late at night, being that they are a late night spot. We did valet. It's a restaurant centered around a traditional Moroccan experience, from the low tables, on-the-floor seating, no shoes, down to the live belly dancers. It had the ambience of a hookah lounge, which they also had there for purchase. The spacing of the restaurant was nice. \\nBeing that it was my birthday, I'm assuming my father paid for us to be served traditionally. So we served a full 5-course meal and you had to wash your hands AT the table in a bowl, prior to eating. The entire experience of it all was what intrigued me, but I wouldn't say I completed enjoyed myself.... even w it being my birthday. I spent more time googling the food, its ingredients, how it's supposed to look, the Moroccan culture and all, simply from my own interest than enjoying where I was. In the moment, at the restaurant, I was just unimpressed.\\n\\nThe food was served with no utensils. I am assuming is all a part of the experience, which I was initially interested in but didn't quite receive. I liked the belly dancers; we all even got up to join. This happened after our distaste for the food, so it lightened our mood a bit. \\nThe most unpleasant thing was the food, sadly. I didn't seem to enjoy the fact that we HAD to eat w our hands. Being that I am West Indian, I appreciate flavors and spices, so I was definitely eager to eat. Outside of that, I am up to trying anything at least once, w no prejudice. However, the food was tasteless almost. Just not at all appetizing. \\nOur waiter wasn't attentive, even down to the point where we had to repeatedly ask for napkins. The music was so loud that you couldn't hear anyone...not even the person next to you. \\n\\nI feel they try hard to push the traditional Moroccan feel, instead of actually delivering a true Moroccan experience.

Patrizi's is pretty frickin' awesome. Upon first glance at their menu you think \\"hmm, there's not much to this\\" but the advantage of having a small menu is being able to perfect each dish. I'm still in awe that Patrizi's serves up such authentic Italian food with fresh made pasta! I mean it's just super impressive that they make their own pasta.\\n\\nThe Garlic Bread was unlike any other I've had and I appreciate what Patrizi's was going for with it. It's more fresh tasting as they have whole poached garlic cloves, grana cheese and sprinkled herbs on top of pieces of ciabatta. I have my own personal preferences for garlic bread but Patrizi's version is cool. The Cacio e Pepe was delicious. Add some Patrizi's Honey and Smoked Pancetta (bacon) to it for a little extra umph. Cacio e Pepe is a super simple pasta dish but Patrizi's does it well. We also decided to go on the complete opposite end and try the Patrizi's Red Sauce pasta and of course added a meatball. The Patrizi's Red Sauce was pretty tasty but I wasn't a huge fan of the meatball. I just felt like the meatball was missing a little something and the texture was kind of \\"meh\\" to me. I like for my pasta to have a little kick to it so next time I come back I'm definitely trying the Karah's Diavolo.\\n\\nThe staff at Patrizi's is super amazing as well. They're really helpful if you're a newbie and help you pick out the perfect pasta dish geared towards your taste.

Our group with in town and heard that Neptune was the best restaurant in Boston. We checked in on the line every day for 3 days and it was always about three hours. We finally decided to wait the two hours on Sunday.  Overall not worth it-  I wish we had just skipped dinner.  Oysters great, rest of food was OK but our service was appalling.  Our server snapped on us and talked to us like we were pieces of trash.  Our a group has all served at some point, we are usually very patient.  She started off telling us that our order was a hot mess and we had to repeat all of it . She made a mistake  and snapped at us that this is why she read our order back to us - she read it back correctly but brought the wrong amount of lobster rolls.  We wanted more oysters but no one came back to grab our 2nd order sheet that we were instructed to fill out.   We finally just stopped ordering anything else just so we can finish what we had coming and leave immediately.  We looked for managers to complain -none in sight -could not even flag down a different server.  Our server continued to snap on people waiting in the doorway to move or not stand over the seafood bar.  We overheard that she, a young  shorter brunette with a mouth on her, was  possibly a hostess not even a server.  She knew that she crossed the line with our table who completely shut down after her rant and she just filled waters and dropped a check without asking us if we wanted anything else . She conveniently added a 20% tip, so 50 some dollars to the group bill.  I understand groups get charged an automatic 20% gratuity at some places and never have I wished harder that wasn't the case . We should've been apologized to instead of charged for that kind of blatant rudeness . The group was frustrated and the night was ruined. The friend that suggested that we go to Neptune was so embarrassed she just apologized and jammed her credit card into the bill asap so we could leave. Our night ended early after that .  After the fact I called and asked for the owner who I was told would call me back - still waiting on that call.  They should be embarrassed of their business. If they even know or care about what happened. Obviously the popularity of the restaurant has someone at Neptune believing basic civility is optional."},{"name":"Ichiza Kitchen & Tea House","address":"5411 NE 30th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This was incredible.

The Cheung Fun has a great smoky taste. The shumai smelled and tasted exactly like shumai does. The ramen had so much flavor! I wanted the kimchi gyoza to have pieces of kimchi instead of a paste, but my dining companion really liked it so that's just a preference. I can't wait to go again and try everything else.

Of course, we had to go to the \\"England\\" section to experience tasty fish & chips!\\n\\nThis family-friendly British pub was super crowded when we went, and because we were sampling different goodies from every \\"country,\\" we just ordered two of the \\"Fish and Chips\\" entrees to share (we split it among six people). \\n\\nThe fish & chips here definitely did not disappoint ... in fact, later during the day, my auntie wanted to go back to the Pub to get one more order, saying it was the best fish & chips she's ever had (in her life, not just in the Park). So, yes -- the hype is real. If you're in Epcot and are constantly on the lookout for a decent fish & chips, visit Rose & Crown Pub and get your hands on one of these:\\n\\n\\"Fish and Chips\\": This signature dish features beer-battered fish fillets that are served with house-made tartar sauce. My mom and aunt really enjoyed the tartar, but I enjoyed the small piece of fish I had plain (I normally don't use tartar) and felt that the fillet sported enough flavor all on its own. The interior was moist and flavorful, and the breading was light and crispy--not overly oily and not too much batter, either. What a delightful experience. If I came back to Epcot, I would definitely return to the Pub just for these! I only wished I were hungrier when we tried this signature entr√©e ... the \\"Fish and Chips\\" were so good that I know I could have eaten an entire entr√©e all by myself if we had dined there for lunch or dinner.\\n\\n\\"Warm Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding\\": This version of bread pudding (if that's what it was) sounded interesting, and it comes with Anglaise sauce. I didn't see anyone ordering this sweet treat at the time, but because I love chocolate, I'm sure I would like this treat, if it really is a chocolaty bread pudding. Just imagining it served fresh and warm right out of the oven makes my mouth water.\\n\\n\\"Crock of Potato Leek Soup\\": I love a good potato leek soup, so this creamy side/snack sounds it would be perfect on a cold day. I'm not sure what sizes the soup bowls are here, but I'm guessing it would be a great accompaniment to those \\"Fish and Chips\\" if you're sharing the entr√©e.\\n\\n\\"Vegetable Cottage Pie\\": I would have to see what veggies are included in this popular pie meal before ordering it, but on the menu, it sounds appetizing, since this \\"Cottage Pie\\" also includes Cheddar and mashed potatoes. If the veggies sound yummy (i.e. spinach, broccoli, etc.) and there aren't too many onions or other greens that I don't like, I would gladly take a chance and try this dish. It almost sounds like a veggie pot pie, and I'm interested to see what it tastes like.\\n\\n\\"Shredded Corned Beef on Toast\\": Now, this is a unique entr√©e that you don't find at many places, so I would want to get this meal for the novelty factor. It's hard to find a good corned beef that comes bursting with good flavors. This entr√©e includes cabbage slaw, McCall's Irish Cheddar and Branston dressing. I probably wouldn't eat the slaw, but everything else in this entr√©e sounds yummy. I saw most people at the Pub ordering the \\"Fish and Chips\\" (vs. the other menu items), but I would want to try this \\"regional\\" entr√©e at some point."},{"name":"Flippers Pizzeria","address":"6526 Old Brick Rd, Ste 100","city":"Windermere","stars":"3.5","text":"Such a wonderful local gem.

I have a tendency to stick to my comfort zone - the usual pad thai and pad see ew. This was my first time experiencing northern thai street food, and it was memorable. My mouth waters when looking back at the old photos on my phone and yelp. If spicy food is your cup of tea, you're at the right place! I like medium spiciness for my Thai cuisine, which is apparently spicing down when I was ordering. I had the pad kaprow (spiced down), and it was the perfect heat. In fact, I poured the fish sauce with chili over the entire pad kaprow. I am a fan of that spicy stir-fried pork! My friend ate the exact same dish, and it was too spicy for her with the tongue burning & nose running. I say proceed with caution on the spices - everyone is different. To be safe, it might be a good idea to spice down unless you can truly handle the heat. \\n\\nIf you're looking for something soupy, go for the om gai. My friend thoroughly enjoyed her chicken in that flavorful, chili paste broth. I also recommend the tofu stir-fry for the vegetarians out there. Thirsty? Get the thai iced tea; their creamy layer was not too sweet. I wish my stomach had more room to try more off their menu. My eyes wanted to try the mango sticky rice.  \\n\\nDee Dee is also next to another food truck that serves Mexican cuisine. Parking may be difficult to find as it is all street; no luck on a private parking lot. My pet peeve was the flies that was swarming around my food, and I had to wave them away every few seconds.

Our Texas Cheese Fries were served on some sort of plate instead of skillet. They didn't stay warm very long and just didn't have the appeal of that the little cast iron skillet.

It's only $5 and is done correctly, not too sweet and a good portion per mochi ball. \\n\\nDefinitely the best sushi place in all of north Atlanta and arguably in the metro area.

Now, being a native Jerseyian, I never really had a strong opinion on the Maine/Boston cold with mayo / hot in butter debate, but the server said Neptune was known for their hot lobster roll (with buttahhh), so I went with that, but asked for a side salad instead of fries to try and ease the delicious guilt to come.

I even walked into Lincoln Cafe ready to hate it and its hipster ways. BUT I have been 4-5 times over the past few years and they have totally won me over. Here's why it's worth going:\\n- Ambiance: Southie is losing Amrhein's (horrible). Lincoln Cafe is much newer, but almost as atmospheric. If it lasts until 2105, it really will be the new Amrhein's. It has managed to be new and relevant and also comfortable and a real Boston feel. Kudos. It can get loud, but they have a back area that is better for conversations.\\n- Staff: No matter who I am with, the staff here reads the vibe right, and adjusts to be fantastic. I have literally gone here after a funeral, with my mom-in-law, for a girls night out, and a date night, and every time they nailed it! The managers check in, the hosts greet you and the servers are usually attentive (we had one glaring exception) and know their stuff. \\n- Good food and good selection: The menu has lots of nice choices and everyone can find something, and dishes range from quite good to surprisingly tasty. \\n- Hollandaise sauce: This could go above but needs its own line. The B-E-S-T hollandaise sauce I have ever had. I might get eggs benedict for dinner here now, but it was really that memorable.\\nThere's are lots of choices in Southie now, and some have fun vibes, but not many back it up with good food and service.

I am a bacon lover and am too familiar with restaurants charging an insane amount for two small strips.\\n\\nPatty was pretty good, it was beef ground with veggies (almost like meatloaf).

Really enjoyed our experience at Rose & Crown on my most recent visit to Epcot! We were celebrating my sister's Bachelorette Party and had four of us total. We didn't make reservations anywhere because we didn't know what country we'd end up in, what we'd be hungry for, etc. Luckily, by the time we got to the UK Pavilion we were getting kind of hungry. However, since it was President's Day weekend, we were concerned we wouldn't get a table. We held our breath as we stood in line at Rose & Crown to put our name in. Surprisingly, we were told it would be about a 30 minute wait!\\n\\nAll in all, I'd say it took only about 20 minutes or so and our buzzer went off. While we waited, we sat in the park across the street listening to the band play and just enjoying the scenery. We quickly got taken back to the dining area and saw quite a few open tables! It was about 530p on a Sunday. Our server, Sammy, quickly came out to greet us. She was AWESOME! Super personable, charismatic...we really enjoyed chatting with her. She asked what brought us into Epcot and after we told her, she said that they refer to these as \\"Hen Parties\\" in the UK. LOL! For those that don't know, Disney staffs their various Epcot Pavilions with true citizens of the country they are representing. I can't remember exactly where Sammy was from in the UK, but it was great chatting with her.\\n\\nSammy was also great in getting me some iced tea. I had two glasses in all. Needless to say after day drinking, sunlight, and countless sweet treats, I was fading hard core by dinner. Not drunk by any means...just dead tired! lol! I really enjoyed the tea here and would definitely recommend. My sister got the Cider and Black (I think that's what it's called) on the drink menu and I had a few sips. It was right up my alley! But alas, I was too tired to drink anymore.\\n\\nLuckily since I was so tired, ordering was easy. I knew right away I wanted the fish and chips, a classic UK tradition! Our food came out within about 15 mins and did not disappoint! The fish serving was huge! Lots of delicious white flaky fish (I think it was cod?). And I straight up devoured those fries. Between being starving and dead tired, I barely remember eating them, but I know they were good!\\n\\nTo top it all off, Sammy didn't let us leave until she brought out a dessert tray for my sister with two lemon cupcakes (ugh no more desserts!!). I had a small bite and it was okay. It was more the gesture that counted than anything.\\n\\nOnly constructive feedback I have is that the restroom is only two stalls. For whatever reason, many Disney sit down restaurants are like that, which makes no sense to me for the amount of guests they have. I ended up going to the bathroom a few times here and had to wait quite a bit one time. They could really add at least two more stalls in here...\\n\\nAll in all, I'd love to get back here sometime. It provides that true Epcot magic of making you feel like you really transported from Florida USA all the way to a tiny pub in the heart of the UK. Well done Disney!

Well that Sunday morning ended up turning into a Sunday afternoon because of a 45 minute wait slowly becoming a two hour wait. You have to be there when they call your name which isn't so pleasant when its cold outside and you're watching the minutes tick by and hearing other people's names being called before yours. You can't help but glare at \\"Elizabeth, party of 5\\" knowing that they will get to indulge in lemon pancakes with a blueberry compote before you. \\n\\nWe had a table of 9 and considering it took forever to get seated, our food came out really fast!

The hash brown bowl was good but I could barely make it through the meal. It needed something like mushrooms or greens to help tie it all together but ultimately it was delicious and definitely a large portion. The hash browns were cooked perfectly as were the over easy eggs. The french toast was tasty and very sweet so I'm glad I only ate half of a piece. I also had my eye on the lemon pancakes and probably should have given those a try instead. A few of my friends ordered the pork belly hash special and loved it! They also had a couple bloody Mary's and did the bottle of mimosas for the table with blood orange mixer. You can even add candied bacon to your bloody Mary...Yum!

If you come with a group of friends and don't care about hanging out or grabbing a drink while you wait then give this place a try.

In hindsight, DUH.\\n\\nSo we ate at the Daily Catch instead and made plans to come here at a different time.  So 5 p.m. on a Friday, we decide to come and the wait is 45 minutes. For supposedly the best lobster roll in the United States, we could wait 45 minutes.\\n\\nWas it the best lobster roll in the United States? Probably not, but only because I spent a few days in Maine earlier in the summer.  Was it the best lobster roll outside of Maine in the United States? Definitely.  The lobster was tender and fresh and melt-in-your-mouth soft. The roll was the perfect compliment, grilled and toasted with butter. The portion was quite large and came with fries, so don't worry about still feeling hungry.  \\n\\nWhy 3 stars then?\\n\\nWell, price ($30) and wait knock it down a star and the rest of the food knocks it down the other star.  The Cioppino was not that special and the lobster in that dish was very tough and not fresh at all.  I wonder if they used different lobster or if they had just overcooked it.  The shrimp in that dish was also not very fresh .\\n\\nService was fine, a bit rushed but can you blame them?

If I was smart, I would have just stuck to bones.  Made a reservation and told them it was my anniversary.  That is where the anniversary talk ended...\\n\\nUpon my arrival, I went to the hostess stand.  I told her I had a reservation, and was whisked off promptly to a table.  When I made my reservation, they asked for the occasion -- of which I shared we were choosing to dine here for our 2nd anniversary.  I also requested \\"happy anniversary\\" confetti for the table (something they do automatically at Bones).  Of course, our table had nothing on it, and no one made mention of our anniversary.\\n\\nSidebar -- I dont expect Bones experiences not at bones, but why ask if you are going to even mention it?\\n\\nThe Service -- subpar, at best.  When the server took our drink order, he didnt quite understand what I was asking for.  I repeated myself, and he still didnt quite get it.  Thus, I changed my order.  My girlfriend order a glass of wine, and when she ordered a refill, it was a different wine that she didn't order.  Additionally, I had to ask for a stir straw for my cocktail (and when I got it, it was a toothpick for martinis -- not great for a water back)\\n\\nThe server also called me \\"buddy\\".  This is inappropriate.  Sir or Ma'am or Mr would have been much more appropriate...\\n\\nThe Food -- the server initially told me the fish of the day was something that it wasn't (said it changed 10 minutes after he took our order).  When it came out, it was over cooked.  My date's meal was the same.  We ordered two apps (the calamari and the oysters). Both were average -- the oysters were rather inconsistent, and calamari was from a bag in a freezer. \\n\\nThe Manger -- while making his rounds, I explained how poor our experience had been.  He was kind enough to comp my food, provide us with dessert, and give me a $50 gift card as a courtesy.  His name was Nathan.  And while this was kind, it was too little too late.  Nathan was the only positive out of all of the night.\\n\\nOverall:  I didnt expect a Bones experience.  But I also didn't expect a Waffle House experience.  Because of this, I will not be returning to Joey D's.  Lesson learned.  Stick to Bones!"},{"name":"Portland City Grill","address":"111 SW 5th Ave, Fl 30","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Wow!

But there are reasons for three stars. Let us begin.\\n\\nPortlandia informed us well... people do line up for brunches in Portland. Thankfully, we strolled into the line right before 9am on a Thursday so we were seated pretty quickly.\\n\\nNo mimosa? Ok - strike one. This is kind of staple. \\n\\nStrike two. Proportions are not described well on the menu, as far as what is a dish meant for sharing... what is a personal dish, etc. So the boy got some potato dish, which had pork in it (so I cannot eat it) and it was wayyy too much and it wasn't even a \\"bigger plate.\\" Considering the waitress saw it was the two of us, and I had asked her to point me in the direction of dishes that are either veg or no pork/beef, it would have been nice for a suggestion for him to get the smaller size. \\n\\nBut this leads us to Strike three. Our waitress was not good. I really don't think it was the fault of the kitchen... we were ordering dishes that other people were getting left and right. We saw a few tables sit at the same time as us, and leave before we even had our \\"main\\" dish. We ordered two of the potato doughnuts and the kitchen brought out one. It looked so stupid on a dish by itself. Since our waitress was MIA, I saw the same food runner by us, let him know, then 10 minutes later our waitress came back with the other doughnut. On the house. Even made some comment about how I said I wanted one, which I didn't, because there are two of us sitting here and I said the word \\"two.\\" Wow thanks!! ...\\n\\nI got the chicken biscuit and holy hell it was delicious. If there was an option to sit outside, order two chicken biscuits with a side of some sort of potato from a window, I would go back to this place in a heartbeat because I know the food is delicious. But damn, were we treated poorly. And check my reviews - I am not some hoighty toighty demanding ass. Not once did our waitress mention the long wait time for us specifically. If we had a place to be at a certain time, we would have had to cancel our food coming out and leave before our food even came. \\n\\nSo overall, ambiance = hip, casual, loud. I sat on a long bench... but the tables were separated. There was a large family next to me and the grandfather was European. He straight stared at me half of the time we were there. I made eye contact with him several times to imply... yes I see you staring, is there something you want? Nothing. It became humorous to my fiance and I, so at least that was entertaining. \\n\\nFood = delicious. A good amount for the price.

Bad mistake....\\n\\n1) The meat is sodium through the roof.\\n2) You cannot understand a word the meat slicers say except for one guy. We had to repeatedly ask what is this meat 2 - 3 times each time they came by. The only guy who we did not have a problem with hearing him seemed annoyed with my coworker. He kept asking him what he wanted if he didn't want the meat he was holding. My coworker said he wasn't sure yet, as there is supposed to be 16 different meats, which we only saw 6 - 7. Eventually the meat slicer asked again what he wanted, and my coworker said just bring back the NY Strip then. When the slicer came back, he asked how is everything, and my coworker gave an honest opinion. The meat slicer seemed even more annoyed at now and never returned. Hey, you asked!\\n3) I ate a piece that was very gamey. I was told it was beef. If it was, that beef has been sitting out because it was so gross I had to spit it out inconspicuously. At that point, I was afraid what else to try as I didn't know what I would get.\\n4) My coworker had the rump roast and he said that piece was very gamey. I was about to eat it, but after he said that, I avoided it. I then went back to the salad bar to eat more cantaloupe because I had enough sodium and gamey meat for the day.\\n5) $40/each for a horrible meal. That is why this deserves one star. Paying that price for such a horrible dinner is ridiculous.\\n6) Our server wasn't bad, but he wasn't great either. He eventually refilled my drink, but never really checked on us how we were doing or if we were enjoying our meal. He still got a 15% tip to the penny, but I wouldn't give more since the bad meat isn't his fault.\\n\\nI highly suggest you eat elsewhere. There is a reason why this place is averaging 2.5 stars.

The food is great but not worth the treatment of the staff. Of course they do a 180 once you sit down so you can tip them. This is not OK for any establishment whether expensive or cheap. I can see a Peter Wells review of this place as what just happened to Peter Luger in NY. There are too many good seafood places in Boston to be treated badly by the staff because they think they are that good, have the right and there is a line out the door. That line can end one day no matter how good the food is."},{"name":"Bootleg Special","address":"400 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"First impression, the ambiance of this place is amazing!

The wait for a table was well over an hour, longer than I would normally wait for a table if I wasn't on vacation.\\n\\nOne way to skip some of the wait is if you want to stand around and wait for a space to open up at their little standing bar area. You just slide into an opening when someone leaves. If a space opens behind you at the actual bar, you can move over there to have a seat. This is what we ended up doing. The bartender was great making sure that the people that had been waiting longest were the next to get a seat and stopping other walk-ups from grabbing them for themselves.\\n\\nI like that the menu is small plates. With a large enough group you could essentially have a buffet style brunch and get to try a bunch of different things. Between my friend and i we tried 4 different dishes. My two choices were the french toast and the potatoes. Both were excellent, especially the potatoes. I'm a sucker for perfectly poached eggs on top of potoatoes/home fries.

Knowing that they don't take reservations and the wait would be pretty substantial, I was reluctant to spend over 90 minutes waiting in line, but in the end, that's just how things worked out.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is small and can only seat maybe 30-40 people tops, so it's understandable the wait times can be up to 3 hours on a busy day.  Being that they're overcrowded, you're more than likely to share a table with others if you have a small party; either seated at the crowded tables or at the bar.  \\n\\nAs famished as I was, oysters were a great way to start the meal off.  I can't specifically recall what oysters they were, but they were East Coast based.  They were cleanly shucked and decently sized.  The clam chowder and lobster roll (which they supposedly are known for) was severely disappointing.  Though the portions were generous, overall texture and taste was bland.  All I said to myself in my head was \\"a 90 minute wait.....for THIS???\\".  I've had better lobster rolls in SF unfortunately.  \\n\\nI think this is one of the places that just got overhyped.

Two registers had overhead sign that read \\"to go orders\\" and the other \\"pick up for online orders,\\"  neither of those applied to us, so we stood (patiently) by the registers with no to go order sign, we assumed of course this is for people that would be dining in at the restaurant. Well news flash, all orders would be at the labeled pick up for online orders register! Any way we finally placed our order with a not so friendly cashier. Mind you she saw us waiting at the register, but never said \\"oh hey that register is off so if you want to place your order come over here.\\" By the way later on I noticed we weren't the only people confused. People were walking through the restaurant trying to find an available employee to figure out how are they supposed to order since they were clearly being ignored.  I order from the salad bar and my bf orders a sandwich. At the salad bar, there were no plates so I had to ask another busy employee for a plate so I could start making my salad. Oh and by the salad bar there were out of utensils. So I had to ask another pre occupied employee about where I could find utensils she pointed to another station where utensils were basically for employees to assemble for restaurant patrons. This was completely backwards! So finally I'm starting to eat my salad and my bf got his sandwich brought to him. The salad was okay but way too overpriced! A salad with no meat and just a few veggies shouldn't cost $9.\\n\\n\\nOverall the place was disorganized, poorly managed and just a mess. It didn't look understaffed.

Definitely a must try if you're adventurous.\\n\\nThe foie gras was unimpressive. There was no bread to eat it with and there was way too much jam on the plate that it overpowered the flavor of the foie. Also, the foie did not have that melt in your mouth decadence that you would have at other restaurants. It almost was not fatty enough.\\n\\nKorean fried chicken...what can I say...I'm from LA and have kyochon (if you are ever in LA, this is a must if you love fried chicken). This was Korean flavored fried chicken. All you could taste was gochujang which isn't necessarily bad but was way overpowering.

I met a buddy who drove from the Dayton Area as I came from the Cleveland area. We met (somewhat) halfway, lol. By the way, I removed my truthful negative review experience here. I'm starting fresh and making this review. Most of the servers here are good and service here on last visit was GREAT. But my last bad experience (excluding this review/good visit) or second to last? One of the two? .......caused me or spurred me to let it fly (its now a removed negative review). Long story short: I went here in noon day about 1 month from this dated last visit? I entered and sat at the bar, no busy lines or people waiting. The bar was nearly empty. I ordered one beer, and I EXPLICITLY said, \\"Hi, I'm just having ONE BEER. I'm gonna listen to a few songs (touch tunes) and take off in less than 30 minutes.\\" I was gonna meet a friend for lunch elsewhere, but she doesn't need to know this. And I also added, \\"But I was here last night, and I had a burger, a drink, and it was awesome!\\", is what I said to her (along that description). So the server walks away. So here I am on my phone trying to select a song or I was on you tube? (I forget exactly). I'm enjoying my time on my phone as I'm happily anticipating my rendezvous of a friend  while enjoying a beer. About 4 minutes have gone by, the same server comes back and asks me, \\"Do you want something to eat or order some food?\\" I'm looking at her with incredulity. I say to myself, \\"Is she for real? Do I need to close my eyes and count to three and see if this is happening?\\" So Im looking at her wondering if I'm caught up in a time warp of \\"space time continuum\\" or something like that and I said, \\"No thank you.\\" After telling her this, I was wondering what or who I was speaking to earlier after explaining what I was there for? I had to ask myself, \\"Is it illegal in Columbus,OH to order ONE BEER and listen to music for 30 minutes before taking off?\\" One May argue, \\"She's just checking on you to see if you changed your mind?\\" I argue: \\"If so, cant I ask for a menu?\\" So I go back to my phone again watching you tube and the same server comes back to me, again, about 7 minutes later and asks (second time), \\"Can I get you something to eat?\\" I'm kinda looking at her, thinking to myself, would it have helped, after she asked me the first time, would it have helped if I grabbed her two ears, looked her square in the eye, and asked her, \\"What part of the description did you not get when I explained what I was here for? Was I speaking French?\\" I thought it was very rude! Extremely off putting! And very pushy! One might argue: \\"She's seeing if you changed your mind?\\" I'll argue: \\"If I changed my mind? Wouldn't I politely ask for a menu?\\" Here I am, wondering what had I done to warrant this? So I jog my memory, back track and go over my interaction with her. I wasn't rude. I complimented the food experience the prior night. I'm not taking up seats, there are no people waiting for seats................I just couldn't believe it! The only logical conclusion I'd surmise is that she was just a spiteful, rude, and malicious person that does not like seeing someone enjoy a single beer in \\"their establishment\\" for 30 minutes as they listen to music at their expense as they toil. So here I am, at this point, mildly agitated, I look at the server talking to a co worker as she now has time to chat with a co-worker................so I purposefully wave at her, so as to interrupt her (as she did me) and inquire of the menu........then she walks away............she has another break talking to her co worker again. So I look at her, and disrupt her again, and say, \\"Excuse me\\", then I inquired of the menu and asked a stupid question again. And I did it a third time. I was trying to convey through her thick skull that maybe you just ought to leave someone alone when they're just enjoying one beer in your establishment for only 30 minutes because it's not illegal. And it's not illegal for someone to enjoy one beer in your establishment that you don't like for unwarranted personal malicious reasons. I didn't see this server there and, honestly, I hope I don't see her there again. The other servers here are good. It's ashamed one server like this can ruin it. And I'll continue to come here.

Was it worth the 3+ hour wait (granted at 6 pm on a Saturday night)? It was for the one time, but it's not something that I'd do very often (or ever) so I have to knock it down half a star for that.\\n\\nNote: they take your phone number and call you when your table is ready, so you aren't just waiting around for your table to be ready.  This makes a huge difference, because I definitely don't think it would be worth standing outside in the cold for three hours for, but as is, it was worth it since we got to wander around the North End and Faneuil Hall while we waited.  The estimated wait time is just that - there is no way for them to predict how long people will linger at their table.  I have a theory that the longer people wait to get their table, the longer they linger (on principle) and the worse the wait gets. We, for example, were not originally planning to get appetizers, but did just because we had waited so long we felt we had to try more things (and glad we did!).\\n\\nAs for the food....\\n\\nMUSSELS - This was my favorite item of the night, hands down.  The sauce was just to die for and it makes me wonder if I should have ordered the cioppino as my main.  Simply delicious.\\n\\nNEPTUNE JOHNNY CAKE - I was skeptical about this, but it seemed so interesting that I wanted to try it. I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked it.  Definitely worth trying... I recommend sharing it with the table as it's a bit sweet to eat too much of (they actually brought it out with a candle to the people next to us celebrating a birthday).\\n\\nSCALLOPS - Probably the best scallops I've ever had.  There are only 4, but they are hearty and delicious.\\n\\nMAINE LOBSTER ROLL (Hot) - Actually my least favorite item, although still great, and definitely ranks up there with one of the better lobster rolls I've ever had, but maybe my expectations were just too high.  I don't really think it's overpriced given how much lobster there is in this thing.  The quality of the lobster itself is probably what makes this such a must get item, but in terms of the bun and the sandwich itself I (dare I say), I wasn't blown away.\\n\\nEverything was very high quality and definitely well worth the price.

On my second go around, I ordered the LT Burger with a bacon and egg (yay to healthy eating) and a Kunu to kick it off. The Kunu was not particularly strong but the coconut, pineapple, and lime notes made it a very fun, tropical drink. The LT Burger was out of control. If a burger is dripping with juice, you know that is a fine burger. The bacon and egg made this heavier, more filling burger and just held it all together. It is pretty dark inside so if you can grab an outside seat, you should try to nab one (better pics too heh). The staff was kind and welcoming with good service.

A very large portion - enough for the five of us to share easily.

An excellent portion, half of which is still sitting in the fridge to be consumed later. The ribs were nicely grilled and a little black. Very tasty. The brisket had a very good ring and was very moist. They have \\"Hot\\" and \\"Sweet\\" sauce on the table, but I used neither.\\n\\nSides of cole slaw and mac & cheese were good.

Having never been to Boston, one of the first things I wanted to experience was Boston's cuisine, namely their world-famous lobster rolls. Several friends recommended the Neptune Oyster for the \\"best lobster rolls in town\\". I was very excited to try this roll out and decided to walk from the Renaissance Waterfront Hotel to the restaurant. It was a 2 + plus mile walk, which I was happy to do as Boston is a great walking city! I arrived around 8pm. Nice little spot. Happy to have finally arrived and eager for lobster rolls.  The place was full, except for 2 little tables in the front, so there were four seats open. I stood there awkwardly for about 10 minutes until I was finally approached by a Neptune's employee who seemed a bit agitated at my presence. I asked if I could be seated for a party of one and right away he said they were booked. When I pointed at the 4 open seats, he quickly replied that they were reserved already. Disappointed, but not discouraged, I asked if I could maybe place a take-out order. Also, not an option. Still hungry, I asked if I could make a reservation and was abruptly denied...they do not take reservations. A bit confused now--- I asked, if they do not take reservations, why were there open tables already spoken for? The Neptune's representative said that he had taken people's names that would \\"eventually take the tables\\" near closing time. At this point I was very confused. Last time I checked, the actual definition of the word \\"reservation\\" is: an 'arrangement to have something (such as a room, table, or seat) held for your use at a later time'. By this point my enthusiasm for a lobster roll at this location became a chore. I tried everything I could to give this place a chance. The attitude of this employee and the utter lack of care or empathy for their customers forced me to decide that this place didn't even deserve a second chance. Where I come from, even if one cannot provide a service, they are at least courteous and smile.  What I received was no courtesy, no smiles, and definitely no lobster rolls.

We were in Boston for the night whenever I consulted Yelp for a place to eat.  Neptune Oyster had the most reviews in the city along with a great score and so we headed on over.  Upon arriving I have to say that it wasn't what I expected as it was a little restaurant that was crammed to the gills with people.  There was a bar on one side and some seating on the other and that was it.  At most I bet it could hold around 40 people.  We asked the hostess if they had room for 2 and we were told there would be a 20 minute wait.  So we agreed to that and went elsewhere to wait since there was literally no place inside to wait.  Right around 20 minutes later we got a call and headed back and were seated at the bar.\\n\\nFor dinner on this evening I decided to go with a mix of things from the raw bar as well as regular menu.  So to start out with I went with 4 oysters in order to try the differences between them.  The ones that I chose were a Katama Bay (MA), Beach Point (MA), Savage Blonde (PEI) and Beausoleil (NB).  Some of them had exotic tasting notes with things like popcorn, brown butter of champagne finishes.  I would be fooling myself if I said I tasted anything similar to that.  Yes they tasted different but not in a way I can describe.  Since I am newish to tasting different oysters that shouldn't be surprising.  In any case, they all were briny and I thought they tasted quite good.  After those were finished my appetizer came out which was a bowl of clam chowder.  It was large and quite good as the broth was creamy and there were a number of clams inside of it.  Once that was finished my entree came out.  I had ordered the Acadian Redfish & Chips which the menu describes as fish and chips which came with malt vinegar aoili, pickles and MV sea salt.  Honestly, this was probably the best fish and chips that I have ever had.  I am sure that was helped along by having a good fish inside and that malt vinegar aoili to dip it in.  Heck that stuff was really good and I would love to have a jar of it to take home.\\n\\nThe bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.

When we arrived, we were told the wait would be about an hour and that was fine, however that turned out to be oh so wrong. \\n\\nWe ended up waiting about an hour and a half to two hours and got seated at this booth that could hold maybe eight people, and it was just us two. Efficiency and use of space is absolutely horrendous. Let me start at the lobby. The lobby of The Thurman Cafe is a dark environment which is cluttered with games no one plays, nick-nacks, and underutilized space, making the waiting game a joke due to the lack of seating that could have been placed in those locations instead. To end off on the environment note, it has the internal complexion of a hoarders house with a claustrophobic dining area and bar, overall, not enjoyable whatsoever.\\n\\nMoving on to the staff themselves, all of them were pleasant to interact with although knowing who actually worked there and who didn't was a joke. Our waitress was just wearing a black t-shirt, our hostess was in what was probably an Aeropostale hoodie, and the guy handling our drinks was just in a grey shirt. To the customer, they just appear as other patrons, not employees. This made communication with other employees for assistance rather complicated as you did not know who actually worked there and who didn't.\\n\\nLastly, the food. It's expensive, really expensive. Was the all anticipated, much hyped, and to die for burger worth it though? No, not one bit. I had ordered the bacon cheeseburger which was absolutely huge and shared half of it with my dad. Upon my first bite, all I kept thinking was \\"This is it?\\" I had come to The Thurman Cafe expecting a quality experience given their reputation and popularity, however, it is just your average burger joint which you could find similar experiences at your local Steak 'n' Shake as well. The burger came with potato chips which was a nice touch, however, they were incredibly stale and not very good in general. On a lighter note, as a side, we had also ordered the jalepano poppers and their fresh cut fries, both were above average in terms of taste and quality.\\n\\nOverall, I would NOT recommend The Thurman Cafe due to their dark and uneasy environment, long wait times, and their average food quality.

I tried a Coconut-thingy (I can't remember names after a few drinks, okay?) which was a little more sweet than I'd usually go for, but yummy.  I tried a sip of Russ's Mango martini, and that was sweet, but delectably good as well.

I don't think I have ever enjoyed dinner this much before! I love how this restaurant is not a trendy place and is more old money. It's a classic, traditional fancy restaurant, which I found really refreshing because of all the trendy places we go to eat that focus more on ambiance and usually have bad food. La Grotta had a coat check place too which reminds me of the fancy restaurants I used to eat at when I was little lol. It's been around since the 70s and is located in the basement of a older apt complex which I thought was cool because it's tucked away. \\n\\nService: The waiter was amazing. He's worked there for 18 years and was really funny and does his job so well.  He made the dining experience even more enjoyable  with his funny jokes and we were impressed. Everyone there was really nice and the entire restaurant had charm. \\n\\nFood: Started off with an organic spinach salad, pretty basic but was good.  My husband ordered red pepper cream soup for appetizer and it was yum. For entree I ordered veal picccatta scaloppine which was not on the menu but they made it for me.  I judge italian restaurants by my signature dish, veal picatta, and let me just say that this veal picatta was one of the best veals I've ever had in my life! And I have even had veal picatta in Italy! It melted like butter in my mouth, sooooo tender and flavorful. I just wish there was a little more veal, like 2 more slices!  I ordered a side of pasta with Fradiavola sauce and it was actually spicy which I LOVE!   Husband ordered the salmon which he enjoyed. For dessert we topped it off with hazlenut chocolate mousse cake which is another staple for me lol. It was not as moist as I hoped, but it was still delish with the side of cream. \\n\\nThis was a true fine dining experience and one of the best dinners I've had.

It was so delicious."},{"name":"Cuatro's","address":"1004 W 24th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Cuatro's is a great new contender in the casual-yet-upscale, patio-dining category.  Started by a crew of former Chuy's/Hula Hut/Shady Grove managers, Cuatro's kicks the food up about 10 notches from this chain and serves it in a much more modern, less touristy setting.  The result is pretty darn delightful.\\n\\nI had the shrimp and avocado tacos, which were terrific.  The shrimp was perfectly grilled and there was a generous portion of avocado.  It sported Cuatro's \\"ubiquitous sauce\\" (their name, not mine), which is a surprising mix of sriracha (or \\"hot cock,\\" as Yelper Delicious L. so aptly calls it), mayonnaise, salt and pepper.  The tortillas were nicely warmed and tasted very fresh.  The only thing that would have made it better was a little cabbage; I like the slight crunch and bitterness that cabbage adds to seafood tacos.  Two tacos a la carte ran me just $7.\\n\\nCuatro's also offers a pretty extensive selection of burgers, several other types of tacos (including a number of veggie options), and a few salads.  Sides appear to be extra for all dishes, but their pricing is sufficiently low to make that OK.  I did notice that they offer my weakness, sweet potato fries; I'll have to try those sometime when I'm feeling a little more splurge-y.\\n\\nThey have a pretty good selection of draft beers (plus my fave draft cider, Woodchuck Amber) and a full bar, so mixed drinks are an option, as well.  There are drink specials every night of the week.  The night I was here (Wed), they had $3 premium pints and $1.50 pints of the usual suspect domestics (Miller, Miller Lite, etc.).  Fridays, they have happy hour from 3 pm until close!  I don't remember all the Friday happy hour deals, but I do remember that it included $2 well drinks.  Now that's my kind of happy.\\n\\nGreat service, nice open patio that's dog friendly (yeah!), a little bit of free parking (key in West Campus), and reasonable prices.  The only thing I might suggest is that you avoid this place on big game days, as they have quite a few high def TV's and a giant projection TV right out front.\\n\\nAt first blush, Cuatro's rates a high four stars from me.  I'd give 'em 4-1/2 if I could.  I need at least one or two more visits to convince me to bump them up to the coveted five-star rating, but that's a distinct possibility.  Cuatro's is definitely worth a visit - check it out!\\n\\n------\\nEDIT, 5/9/08:  Was back here for lunch with other Yelpers in tow.  Cuatro's didn't deliver quite as well as it had on my first visit.  Service was a little scattered (it was much more crowded), and the food wasn't as fabulous.  I tried the portabello burger, and it was really drippy - I had to give up about halfway through and eat it with a fork and knife.  We tried the sweet potato fries, which I liked fine, but I think I may have been the only one.  Since Don P. was there, we also had to have queso (of course), which was all right, but not amazing.  It was better when eaten with the salsa we requested to have with it.  My favorite part about this meal (other than the company) was the jalapeno ranch dressing, which was very homemade tasting and had a great zing.  I wanted to dip EVERYTHING in it.\\n\\nStill a four-star experience, but not the \\"OMG this may be my new place\\" four-plus star experience I had the first time around.

The waiter also told them that the lobster rolls tend to come out faster than other dishes.\\n\\nNow, back to the lobster rolls!  It was the first time I ordered a hot buttered lobster roll and I was very impressed.  Not only was it delicious but it had a light coating of butter which was good since it didn't overpower the taste of the lobster.  The roll was grilled which added to to the wonderful flavor.  My husband was impressed with his roll, too.  What impressed him was that the mayo coating was light.  Some places that serve lobster rolls put the mayo on too thick which tends to overpower the delicate lobster flavor.  My husband's only complaint---and he said it was minor---was that his roll was a little over-grilled on one side.  However, it was still edible.  The lobster rolls come with fries.  I thought that the fries were a bit overcooked but my husband liked them that way.  They're thinly sliced with the potato skins still on them.\\n\\nWe got a look at the fish tacos and saw that the portion was huge but the man that ordered them said they were delicious---and I don't doubt that!\\n\\nWould we go here again next time we're in town?

It is now located on West Hastings in its own building. It is certainly off the central hub where it used to be near Burrard and Robson Streets. \\n\\nThe restaurant is a very adequately sized and fully stocked; with a liquor and a sushi bar. The interior setting is a bit of mix bag with a wavy ceiling pattern and some comfortable seating, while remnants of Japanese aesthetics linger in an odd juxtaposition.  \\n\\nThe whole time while we were there, the restaurant was sparsely occupied.  I was wondering whether it has to do with the location, lack of foot traffic or whether due to falling out of favour with the general public. \\n\\nFor dinner we had a number of items. Every item was standard without being inadequate or extraordinary. Some sushi, sashimi, tempura, teppanyaki, and salad; all was alright.

We each placed our own orders. So while we arrived as a group we were essentially three unique orders as far as the kitchen is concerned.\\n\\nTo start, upon making the line, we ignored the first sign of trouble which was, the main window is both the order window and pickup window. The second window is occupied by a heat lamp that keeps their alcapurrias and empanadas warm. Odd placement for that, but okay...The, now single, pickup window is overworked and is managing all orders; these include those being placed via phone, in person, and/or GrubHub! \\n\\nAll of these orders are being written down, by hand, by a single person. This causes the line to move slower than anticipated. We let this slide as they are a small business, making due with what they have and seem busy....so on the surface it looks to be \\"worth it\\".....strike one nonetheless.\\n\\nAfter waiting in line for approx. 20 minutes our group of three is able to place 3 individual orders about 3 minutes apart from each other. The cashier takes the payment upfront, and we are asked to step to the side until your name is called....standard stuff. Here is when things go down hill.\\n\\nWe waited 30 minutes or so AFTER placing our order and finally the first of three orders was called. While we thought 30 minutes was an extremely long time we were glad to finally have one of the orders called. We figured the other two would be right behind, as they were all ordered within minutes of each other. We couldn't have been more wrong.....strike two.\\n\\nIt would be an additional 45 minutes until the SECOND order was called. As we waited and looked around we noticed that many of the same people who were either waiting when we got there or not too long after us were still waiting. In between order #1 and #2 there were other orders being filled for customers who came after us and/or picked up by GrubHub drivers.\\n\\nAfter waiting for a combined two hours at this point, we finally decided to ask about the third order. By this time others are also asking about their orders. We discovered that the third order was missing altogether, despite it being written down by hand and paid for already (remember that?). They now decide to retake the order and start the order from scratch again. The third order would eventually take an additional 30 minutes to make AFTER the order was retaken.\\n\\nAll told, it took us close to 3 hours to have 3 orders of standard menu items prepared. All of which were fried, not made to order, with no substitutions. It essentially took 1 hour to serve each person, that is absolutely unheard of!\\n\\nWe waited for two reasons:\\n\\n1. We keep telling ourselves that any minute now we would have our orders. The fact that we paid and there was a long line just to speak to the one person at the window, made it more trouble than it was worth to ask for a refund or risk making scene.\\n\\n2. After hour two, I wanted to see how bad it would get to see if there was any apology or reason why it was taking so long....but there wasn't. This is simply how they operate.\\n\\nWith all that being said, how was the food? Not great...by the time we returned home all but the last order was cold. Some of our food was under cooked (maduros), some of our food was too dry (tostones) and some of our food was too greasy (alcapurrias). The entire trip was a waste of time, money, and effort.....strike 3.\\n\\nI am SUPREMELY disappointed, to say the least, and would caution anyone from visiting this establishment.

Maybe it's been too long since their ventilation system was cleaned and serviced, or maybe something was growing somewhere that never gets mopped; I don't know, but if I hadn't already ordered and paid, I would've left. I found a seat at the periphery where the smell wasn't so strong. \\n\\nBy and by my sandwich and soup were brought to the table, minus the cheese that was supposed to be in the sandwich. I went back to the counter and asked after it; the lady said \\"I'll bring it\\" and a minute or two later brought me a slice of cheese. I disassembled my sandwich, installed the cheese, and reassembled the sandwich. No big deal by itself, mistakes happen. \\n\\nWhen I opened my fizzy drink, it foamed up out of the bottle and got all over the table, my shirt, and my jeans. Whoops! I jumped up, went to the cash register (no customers) and --¬† with my dripping hands held outstretched --¬†pointed at the roll of paper towel behind the cashier and asked if I could have some rags or paper towels. Right at that moment, a woman I would later learn is the owner/manager/big cheese stepped up to the cashier and they started having a chat about money, swapping bills in and out of the till. For some strange reason, owner-woman wants particular denominations (this is obvs not about making sure the register is appropriately stocked for customer transactions): \\"Eeeyeahhhhh...I think I'd rather not have a fifty...maybeeeeeee...I donno, two twenties and a ten? Or two twenties and two fives...?\\" \\n\\nI'm standing there, dripping, as soda pop is spreading on the table and soaking into my clothes. I'm still pointing at the paper towel. The cashier gives me the \\"1 sec\\" hand sign and keeps on chit-chatting about twenties and fifties. I repeat myself: excuse me, could I _please_ have some rags or paper towel? Again I get the \\"1 sec\\" hand sign. By and by, the owner says \\"What do you need it for, is it to wipe your table? Or is it a spill?\\" I say \\"It's a spill, and it's spreading, and the longer we stand here talking about it, the more of it is soaking into my clothes, so for the third time, may I *PLEASE* have some rags or paper towel *NOW*?\\". Cashier unwinds a couple of paper towel squares and hands them to me. My, that was difficult. It's not enough, but I manage to sop up some of the spill.\\n\\nI finish my lunch and go back to the counter, intending to tell the owner why I won't be returning--I think it's only fair that if I've decided to stop patronising a business, the owner ought to know why. I quietly ask the cashier if I could please talk with the owner. Cashier goes into the back, comes back and says \\"She's busy, she'll be out in a sec.\\"\\n\\nSixty secs pass by, then a hundred and twenty, then two hundred and forty--I'm watching them on the big clock on the wall. Cashier circles back to me and says \\"Hi\\". I say \\"Hi. This is not improving with age; may I please speak to her?\\" Cashier says \\"She's still in back...um...is there...what's...can I help you?\\". I say \\"I'm an upset customer and this is not getting better.\\" Cashier says \\"One sec\\" and goes in the back, then comes back and says \\"She'll be out in a sec.\\" \\n\\nA hundred and eighty additional secs later, the owner is still showing every sign of deliberately avoiding me--very classy. My time is not free. I tell the cashier \\"OK, then. Please let her know I'll just take it to Yelp.\\"\\n\\nAnd here I am. Looks like I'm not alone, too."},{"name":"J.

We started with a potato leek soup and a blood orange and beet salad, both of which were tasty, but not particularly inventive or delicious. We then moved on to what looked like a really promising dish, black truffles with a poached egg over grits (and about half a dozen other ingredients), but which really underdelivered. It wasn't that it didn't live up to our high hopes; it was that it didn't taste good. We then had a scallop dish that we didn't even finish, even though it was tiny. The best dishes we got were an herby (but fairly salty) spaghetti and a beef dish with rutabaga, wild rice, and a cider glaze. Having tried most of the menu at this point, between the two of us, I was wondering if we should just go somewhere else for dessert -- but since we were unlikely to return, we figured we'd see it through. We ordered the chocolate panna cotta, which tasted just like the chocolate pudding mom used to make. Unfortunately, my mom always makes her chocolate pudding using the JELL-O powder. It capped off a really underwhelming evening, I'm sad to say.\\n\\nIt wasn't all bad. The service was friendly, if a little inexperienced, and it's convenient that you can order half-portions. The decor is charming, if a little too hip (the pair of skis leaning casually against a back wall suggests, ridiculously, that someone just schussed in from the Cambridge sidewalk) but  it's nice to spend an evening in a restaurant where you can actually hear your partner talking. \\n\\nGiven that we tried most of the things on the menu, I don't think we can blame ourselves for mis-ordering, or say that they just missed on one or two dishes.  And with so many consistently great restaurants in the area, we won't be back. Hungry Mother beats Bondir hands down in every category -- the food, the cocktails, the beer, the wine, the service, even the price -- and Oleana is just around the corner. In fact, because we couldn't get a reservation for Bondir until 8:30, we sat at the bar at Oleana and had a snack that ended up being the best dish of the night -- a delicious octopus-and-brussels-sprouts concoction. \\n\\nAnd if you want to really try a young, up-and-coming chef's ingenious creations in an intimate setting with locally sourced ingredients and a menu that changes daily, drive out to Lenox, MA and visit a place called Nudel.

I follow a couple of bands and they play there occasionally, so I go there, but if I have another option, I take it.\\n\\n I used to like Clyde's much more, but since the new owners took over 2 years ago, the service, which was already not so great, has gone downhill. A person cannot get waited on. The bar is always jammed with people who come to listen to the music and not purchase anything, so those of us who do try to buy food and drink must navigate around them to get to the bar, wait in line, be rudely shoved aside by the servers, just to get attention. Table service is non-existent in the lounge area. I hear that is because they are afraid one of their  servers might get hurt by the drunks on the dance floor. Wonder what kind of lawsuit they will have when a patron is hurt trying to navigate around the drunks? BTW, the drunks often take their drinks to the dance floor and spill them. Wonder if here is a law against that? Clyde's might want to check. \\n\\nNYE was THE worst! My friend and I arrived an hour and a half early so we could enjoy a meal before the music started. Instead, we sat waiting to be served for an hour. Of course,  we did not just sit, we complained. NUMEROUS times. One waitress made fun of us because we kept asking her for service. She was very belligerent and did not bother to even give us menus. We finally got our food somewhere in  the middle of the first set--probably 2 1/2 to 3 hours after we arrived. Yes, they were busy, but really?  \\n\\nThe bartenders are not much better. There is one who has been there for a while and he is very rude much of the time. He says it is because he is from the east coast and we west coast people do not understand him. Hello, dude, this is the west coast. YOU should conform instead  of expecting all of your customers to conform to your rudeness.  The  other 2 bartenders are just overworked and I am sure underpaid because few people bother to tip at Clyde's, but they have good reason to not tip: they do not get service. \\n\\nIt  is a stressful place to go out. The music is great twice a month--when my friends' bands play, but otherwise,  it is not really worth the harassment one gets and the nastiness of the staff. Hopefully some place that offers good service will open and Clyde's can become Portland history.\\n\\nTo those who work at Clyde's and who read this, and I hope you do: start waiting on people. You  will make tips and then it  probably won't be such a horrible job because the way it is now, it can't be great. I feel sorry for you, but tips are for service. You  should not expect to  make them if you do not provide it and ridicule people when they ask you for service."},{"name":"SuperChefs Breakfast & More","address":"199 E Broad St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"This place is awesome.

As a I was preparing for my trip to the area Neptune Oyster was a restaurant that was popping up on numerous Yelp reviews and blogs so I had to bookmark it. \\n\\nMuch like what other Yelpers have said, there is NO RESERVATIONS so the wait for this place can be 1.5 hours plus if you come during the rush. For a group of 3 for a table it took us around 40-50 minutes to get seated once we put our name down ~4PM. It's a small place so you're better off waiting outside or exploring the area since they take your number and give you a call 5-10 minutes before your table is ready. What a great pro on their part! \\n\\nOnce we got called and entered the restaurant it really is like a 30+ seater place so you are fairly close to your neighbors. Keep your distance or try to make friends if your choice. Funny enough we were seated next to the group in front of us and then after us. \\n\\nNow for the food: \\n\\n+ Fried Clams - Get this if you can! This is a great option to share with the group. I enjoyed this dish since the clams were not oily/greasy at all and didn't give me that headache that I sometimes get when eating them at other establishments. The clams here are large and not small pieces covered in layers of batter. The seasoned batter here went well with the lemon and stuck to the clams with each bite. \\n\\n+ Lobster Roll - The must awaited lobster roll! For this dish you can pair it with a side salad or the obvious choice of french fries for $32 (which was market price at the time). I enjoyed the bread they paired with the hot butter lobster roll but it did get soggy quick so eat fast. There were large chunks of lobster that weren't overcooked so if you want a lobster roll this is a great place to try it. Can't say it's the best lobster roll I've ever had but it's definitely in the top 5 or so. \\n\\n+ Shrimp & Grits - Yum! For $34 a dish this is not the cheapest special they have on the menu but it was delicious. It had more of a runny grits texture but I think it was in part due to the spicy sauce they had. Plenty of shrimp as well so I thought it was something we would get again.\\n\\n+ Oysters - They were OK in my book. They had a decent selection of oysters and let you pick the 2 sauces you wanted to pair them with. The oysters were shucked well but for $3+ each for the less common oysters they were tiny for their size. Could probably get bigger oysters elsewhere but I thought they did a solid job of explaining the flavors for each oyster they had on their menu. My faves were the Mookie Blue & Beach point. Katama Bay was OK. \\n\\nAll in all, I left the place satisfied and wasn't disappointed in the wait time especially since they text you so you're not restricted to waiting out front. \\n\\nService here is pretty crazy since they're catering to a mass amount of people in a small space so it's a bit tough at times to get their attention. However, our waiter was awesome and she was knowledgable about all the specials and knew the answer to any of our questions like the back of her hand. \\n\\nI'd come back for another visit, but the price tag here definitely doesn't make it a place I would probably visit more than once during a trip but more so trip."},{"name":"Bar Mezzana","address":"360 Harrison Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Went for a yelp community event and had a great time in the open bar atmosphere talking to new yelpers. The customer service was excellent--we lucked out with an extremely kind server who checked in with us often. Usually, some restaurants fear having big groups due to slow down in service for the rest of their place, but this place was more than ready to handle us. I'd say it is fit for groups! I also noticed a small function hall possibility near the bar with a wall-mounted TV behind frosted glass doors for privacy. Our group ate the crostinis, ricotta and eggplant types, and also shared a pasta meal. The bread was impeccable with baked-in seasoning with dipping oil. I had the Stillwater saison beer (well done, Bar Mezzanna, on the carefully selected beer options). My plus one has the mezzanna spritz with Campari which reminded us of an aperol spirit, well garnished with mint and lemon. This place is easily accessible and walking distance from my place in south end. Driving in May be difficult, but after talking to others at the event, I was surprised how some luckily found metered street parking a few blocks away with ease. The restaurant itself was modern, not overwhelming with decor, and had good flow. There's valet and two hostess waiting to great you. There's outdoor seating on the wide sidewalk from spring to fall (I walk past this place frequently on my way to Whole Foods). I'm so glad to have attended this event and experience this place.

The server was very nice and attentive (which should be a no-brainer since he had no other customers). They were out of a good 1/2 of their soft drinks and unsweet tea, so already not a very good first impression.\\n\\nI decided to go with the iconic two, an Italian beef and a philly cheesesteak. I do love that they let you do a 2-item half sandwich combo when you can't quite commit to one sandwich. My friend ordered a chicken philly and we ordered a basket of fries and a basket of cheese curds to split.\\n\\nWARNING: THESE ARE NOT CHEESE CURDS! I'm from Wisconsin, I know these things. I was so excited, and then my soul was crushed when I bit into them. They're mozzarella balls, but not even fresh mozz, they're that weird creamy processed stuff that doesn't have the nice pull and string of fresh mozz. Such a disappointment I can't even rate them if they were presented as mozz bites, my judgement is tainted.\\n\\nThe fries are thin and crinkle cut, about McDonalds width, and a ton of seasoned salt on top. They come with a side of cheese sauce that tasted a little too plastic to me. You have to ask for a side of ketchup.\\n\\nWhile waiting for our food, we did enjoy the giant Connect Four game - I'd love one of those in my house. Brought back memories. Only problem is that it's tucked in a corner and it's sort of hard to step back and see the whole board before you make a move. I still won, though.\\n\\nFood arrived. I ordered my sandwich wet and yes, was wet where the gravy soaked into the bread, but overall the meat was a bit dry. I had sweet peppers (was expecting slices of banana pepper), this amounted to big cubes of green bell pepper seared to soften and char a little but still mostly raw. They were not well distributed and mainly just fell out. I ordered sharp provolone cheese and it was placed on the very bottom of the roll in one big glob layer. It did not melt, because the beef wasn't hot enough, so it was just semi-warm solid cheese. I prefer my cheese on top, melted, even broiled a little. \\n\\nThe cheesesteak was a bit better, beef was well seasoned and not too dry, cheese was still placed on the bottom but at least was more melted. The grilled onions were scarce but well grilled, and I don't know if I did have mushrooms or not, if I did they were hard to find.\\n\\nMy friend wasn't 100% certain he had chicken on his chicken philly, it didn't really have any flavor.\\n\\nOverall, not impressed. Overpriced ($9.50 for two small half sandwiches and no sides or drink, $4 for a basket of fries, $4 for mozz bites, I think his chicken philly was also $9.50) and mediocre food. I can't say there's one thing I'd go back for.

I don't necessary consider this vegan friendly but more vegetarian. \\n\\nMost of the donuts I got where yeast based since I read that yeast is gluten free. However, I believe it's a mix of yeast plus non gluten flour since I was told Dough-Nut is gluten free.\\n\\nCoconut donut is cake base. I got it knowing it would not be gluten free cause I love coconut that much. Maybe I was really craving some vegan donuts. It just sounded healthier.\\n\\nI ate half of each donut and the other half was eaten by my daughter. So far, I'm okay and didn't have any headaches. I concluded I had great quality desserts, made from love.\\n\\nMy fave is actually the coconut followed closely bu the Dough-Nut. The Orange Pistachio was really greasy.\\n\\nI am glad I finally came and tried them out. I didn't feel bloated or sick so I'm happy.

For Portland Dining Month, the seafood \\"tower\\" is more of like a small sampler platter of various seafood items, which was all delicious. The prime rib was good, especially when you add the au jus to add some extra flavor. The mashed potatoes tasted good and good texture to it. The brussel sprouts were only ok, not the best I have had, and I think it has to do with the seasoning or how long they were cooked, but I thought it could have been cooked a bit longer to get rid of some of the rawness taste. The meal was finished with some dessert, which my girlfriend and I got one of each of the selections provided, so we were able to try each dessert. The creme brulee was just as good as any other creme brulee I have had anywhere with the nice caramelized top and creamy custard on the inside. Chocolate brownie came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top and although delicious, I found everything to be sweet, but I think that's more of my taste changing to not liking things as sweet as I did when I was young. \\n\\nOur waitress periodically checked up on us and made sure everything in our meal was going well and our waters were filled up throughout our meal, great service.

I was planning for Por Que No for lunch but was in a hurry and trying to get through the Mississippi Street Fair wasn't really seeming like a bright idea... so Hawthorne was in the direction of where I was going and somehow I ended up here (still was thinking abour Por Que No tacos, so I had to get tacos somewhere).\\n\\nHad the Taqueria Taco with chicken, and the Taco de Pescada.

The Taco de Pescado was the cheapest of white fish (pollock) and basically taste like that.  \\n\\nSalsas were decent though, and the pickled carrots were quite good.\\n\\nBut I do have a pet peeve... they let pets inside of the restuarant.  I am sure there are more places that do this - but still annoying.  Just because the dog is little it doesn't mean when the owner is standing over the salsa bar with the dog in one hand, the dog isn't going to end up sharing some fur with the next person in line.

Hands. DOWN.\\n\\nI came here on a Monday afternoon by myself; my husband was at a conference and doesn't like seafood so I was super excited to try this place without him!!  Despite it being a weekday, it was absolutely prime lunch time and this place was buzzing! I was lucky enough to walk in RIGHT as the list was growing and snagged a spot at the bar.  The staff was super attentive, friendly, and on top of everyone - despite that place somewhat resembling Grand Central Station.  \\n\\nNow this place is TINY!  Maybe 4-6 tables, and a bar that snakes its' way down the length of the narrow restaurant.  All the while, waitresses carefully navigate their way through hoards of people with seafood layden plates, making this place feel intimate and somehow even more special.  \\n\\nOnto the food.  I knew what I was going to order before I even got to Boston - let alone to the restaurant.  I'm not the biggest oyster fan, so why did I come here you ask? For the lobster roll, of course!  I placed my order for a glass of wine and a hot butter lobster roll - I felt like a kid on my birthday, I couldn't wait!  I ordered a white Chenin Blanc from Stellenbosch (Raats) which was the perfect companion for my seafood - crisp, refreshing, and crisp.\\n\\nHere's where I have to make a confession - I've actually never had a lobster roll before! For whatever reason, Jersey has decided we love mayonnaise on our lobster rolls, which is quite possibly the most disgusting combination, in my mind #sorrynotsorry.  I love seafood but I despise mayo, so I've resigned myself to living a sad life without the joys of a Lobster Roll.... that is, until I heard what Boston was up to.  \\n\\nA short while later, IT arrives.  Now, this lobster roll is a thing of beauty, overflowing with tantalizing lobster and glistening with melted butter; I knew I was in for it.  #getinmybelly.  My first bite was utter bliss; I even made eye contact with the waitress and we exchanged a 'How-can-it-be-this-good' look.  The bread is toasty enough to hold the sandwich together, but soft enough with the melted butter so it's not hard.  The lobster was divine; cooked to perfection - wonderfully tender, just chewy enough for texture, and popping with lobster and butter flavor.  It was a mountain of of lobster, sometimes I would pick it up with just a fork and let it melt in my mouth.  I have to say, although it's an expensive meal, you're getting a ton of lobster - which I appreciate when paying market price ($31) for a sandwich.   I most likely would have been comfortable having half a sandwich, BUT when there's nobody to share with, I have a leave-no-lobster-behind mentality, and I finished the entirety of it.  \\n\\nIt was probably too much food. And a lot of butter which my body probably didn't need.  But I left that place, dreaming of the next time I can come back and have it again. YES, IT WAS REALLY THAT GOOD.  Not exaggerating, not overstating it.  This was quite possibly the most amazing meal I've ever had.  It comes with fries, which I tasted one or 2, but tried to focus my efforts on what really counts.  For the record - they handmake their fries and they're super proud of them.  \\n\\nThey don't take reservations, and there alwayyyyys seems to be a wait; I would probably suggest avoiding weekends if possible. But RUN, don't walk. RUN to this place and order the hot butter lobster roll.

Besides the beers, the bartender (older, white-haired guy) was SO GREAT. We ended up talking about Celtics, Davis and what not. He might be the best bartender in the Davis area! Redbones itself has 2 bars (downstairs and upstairs) and the upstairs bar is really well decorated with sports memorabilia, TV's and with bright, colors.

Whatever. One might think she'd be happy to have a generous, easy-going, fun-loving group in her section. She continually made snyde remarks throughout our meal, which in turn made me incredibly uncomfortable; mostly because most of my family/ friends had never eaten there (and they will never go back either). \\n\\nThe service STUNK!  We were asked what we wanted to drink/ eat and didn't have menus. There was one menu floating around from the early arrivals, but I'm not about to share one menu among 6 people. The server made a point (again) of saying 'we seated ourselves', therefore she didn't know to bring us menus... give me a break. I understand that the table may not be set up, but we waited 20 minutes for menus and water. \\n\\nAs a matter of fact, we didn't get to order our food until 20 minutes before the kitchen closed (10 PM)- which of course, she felt obliged to remind us of (and it was NOT a courtesy reminder). \\n\\nWe still hadn't received our first round of drinks by the time our food was served. I even finished my meal before we got our drinks, which she delivered in time to clear the table of our food dishes. \\n\\nThankfully, a friend took up our cause (nicely) with the manager, so I can't vouch for what was said. I will, however say the manager offered apologies - which sounded more like insincere lip service.  While he stressed the lack of communication from the hostess about the seating- there was still an element of chastisement in his voice. We somehow skipped serious seating protocol... I don't get it.  He acted apologetic and gave us lame \\"$10 off 2 entrees\\" coupons-  which they gave to everyone! Don't want them-- I WON'T be back! \\n\\nAlso, they managed to tack on an obligatory 20% \\"large group\\" gratuity. Thankfully, someone noticed the fine print and  pointed it out, as not to leave any more undeserved tip. Our server, and I hope she reads this, did NOT deserve any tip (not even 2%, let alone 20). \\n\\nBarcelona would not remove the tip portion, because they KNEW we wouldn't leave one. I take issue with that. We are very good tippers given remotely decent service. Had I charged it on MY credit card (instead of my husband paying with HIS)- I'd call the credit card company right now to refuse that charge! \\n\\nIcing on the cake: The server stomped over saying:  \\"I'm outta here. You know, I'm going to be reprimanded for this.\\"   I just replied: \\"You SHOULD be.\\"   Nasty, bratty attitude.  Yuck.\\n\\nI'm unapologetic for this poor review. We should be able to go to a Michael Reams restaurant with high expectations- and I have- THREE times. All three times, Barcelona's sub-par service has put me off, but last night was the ultimate! Everything about this experience was unacceptable.

I mean, how could I not try a Japanese restaurant that the mayor of flavortown endorses. \\n\\nAtmosphere: it's a pretty small place, but tastefully designed. Surprisingly, then can even accommodate larger parties, we came with 8 people. We were there on a Saturday around 1pm, due to our large party, the wait was about 30 minutes.

It's definitely very sticky, so be prepared to have your hands and face covered in orange sauce. I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce on this one, but loved how crispy it was on the outside yet tender on the inside. \\n\\nKatsu curry ramen- they take the broth making process pretty seriously, the waitress mentioned it takes 3 days to make a batch of broth. And you can definitely taste all the work they put into the broth, it's absolutely delicious. The pork on top was crispy and flavorful, and the noodles were great too. Overall just a great bowl of ramen, must try! \\n\\nThe price: very fair, about $12 for a big bowl of ramen.\\n\\nThe service: our waitress was a bit preoccupied and visited our table a total of three times over the span of over an hour.

They have specials on draft beers so I ordered a good one that the server allowed me to sample before selecting.  \\n\\nOn the positive side: I had the scallops with cauliflower pur√©e and saut√©ed brussel sprouts.  My scallops were cooked and seasoned to perfection and I would have killed for a big dollop of that cauliflower pur√©e, it was so dang good! The sprouts were tasty ( bacon makes everything better!) but some were over cooked and some were underdone.  We also had excellent service from a young woman, Ashley, who was friendly and engaging. \\n\\nMy date had the jambalaya and it came out with over cooked chicken and undercooked rice.  What?  How does that even happen?  The manager came over and apologized and it was replaced with linguine with clams that were very sandy!  We sent those back and they brought him a fresh batch.  By this time I was done with my meal and my date was afraid to eat his clams.\\n\\nPositive end to a bad experience was that we didn't have to pay for the jambalaya or the linguine AND they comped my beer and the fried green tomatoes, too!

We had made a reservation for 8:30pm and were seated quickly, and then promptly forgotten about for the next 25 minutes. My husband finally got the attention of a server and asked if someone would be around to our table, and then a server came about 5 min later. Apparently they just didn't assign a server to us and it was an oversight, but sitting for 30 min with no drinks or even a drink menu wasn't a great start to the meal. The manager did come over and apologize, and gave us one of our tapas on the house, so that was an attempt to rectify at least.\\n\\nOnce we finally spoke to a waiter, we immediately ordered 5 tapas (ensalada de rucula, tomates asados, patatas bravas, gambas al ajillo, and humus verde). They brought the salad and tomatoes quickly, along with our drinks, and then forgot about us for a second time for another hour! So we ate our salad in 10 minutes and then didn't see the server for another 45 min. He apologized but had no excuse -- he was just talking with someone at the bar. So we got the rest of our food and were still kind of hungry but it was after closing time at that point so we just got coffee and left.\\n\\nWe did get one of the tapas and the coffees on the house, but our experience was pretty inexcusable for the prices and quality you should expect at Barcelona. Maybe it's because my husband and I were significantly younger than the average diner there on a Friday night, so potentially they didn't take us seriously. Or maybe it was just bad luck.

Both the fava beans and pecorino had been chopped up. There was some kind of spread which served as the base for the two. It had almost a cucumber like taste to it. Either way, it was delish. \\nEggplant, Chili, & Honey - This was amazing. Eggplant was served as a puree type spread. The chili/honey was a great combo. It was the perfect pairing of spicy & sweet. (but not overly sweet)\\n\\nNext, we ordered the Pea Salad & The Orecchiette.\\nThe Pea Salad was great. The peas were on the bottom, and there was a generous portion of Spinach/Arugula on top (or that's what I think it was!)\\nThe Orecchiette was my favorite plate of the night.

When I'm on the east side of Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway, I used to love The Tillicum which was an old school dive bar. Once it closed, my visits to watch games became a choice between Raccoon Lodge and Azteca Mexican Restaurant primarily due to the big screen TV options.\\n\\nFull Disclosure: I am not a beer drinker. So my review is solely based on the atmosphere, food, and other beverage options.\\n\\nOn my visits, I tend to head upstairs where the space is divided between a bar with stools, tables, and booths, and the family friendly restaurant.

Mr. K and I have had a variety of options from the Happy Hour and standard menus on our visits. The HH burger (1/3 lb.) is a good deal at $4.95, but served a la carte. Fries/Tots are ordered separately and they have a variety of dipping sauces. I've been satisfied with items I've ordered from the regular menu, but nothing has wowed me. The item that I personally would not order again is the Beer Battered Fish & Chips.\\n\\nI've always had good service at the bar, although it is a funny cocktail menu. The majority of \\"cocktails\\" include beer. I usually order the non-beer cocktails and they are OK, just not their specialty.

The staff was very friendly, professional and did a great job all around. The menu selection was more than ample and covered about any cuisine that you might want!  \\nThe Bad - I hesitate using the word bad but since there's no other category... my wife ordered the Sirloin, medium well and it came out cooked very well. While it wasn't necessarily tough, it ended up pretty dry and was fairly bland in taste. Her mashed potatoes were cool and the salad was an average salary.  My grilled Atlantic Salmon, which I asked to be cooked medium so there was no sushi in the middle, came out well done and over grilled on one side along with a fairly heavy grille on the other.  Unfortunately, it pretty much wiped out all of the moisture and most of the flavor. The rice and broccoli sides were very good.  Or an appetizer I have the chicken potstickers. Just average width not too much taste and a little over on skillet time.\\nThe Ugly -  Nothing at all ugly. When the server responded to my question about \\"what's the best thing on the menu\\", I should have been forewarned when her response was \\"the pizza and burgers are great.\\"  I bet that is absolutely the case.

They have a large waiting area but of course as busy as the place is it could be much bigger I think.\\n\\nAfter we were called to our table we went into what I believed to be a very tiny restaurant dining area centered around a bar.  There was booths along one wall, the bar on the other and some hightop tables in the middle that seated two.  We were seated at one of those tables.  I'd recommend trying to get a booth though as the space is pretty tight and unless you're skinny minny you're going to feel claustrophobic on one of the high top tables!\\n\\nI ordered the Thurman Burger special and my fiance ordered the Cheeseburger.  We also decided to try the small pizza and got the default fries with our burger.  After a short wait, less than expected, our food came out.  The Thurman Burger was massive and just as intimidating as one would expect!  I dug in and went to town as I was pretty damned hungry (had not eaten for a while before coming).  This burger was quite delicious.  \\n\\nAs they said on Man Vs. Food at times it tastes like a burger but at other times, since it has lettuce, banana peppers, ham, salami, etc it tastes like a sub.  All I know is once you commit to eating it don't plan on stopping unless you want to eat it with a fork because it turns into quite the mess when you squeeze it and if you set it down you won't be able to pick it back up.  Word of warning!!  The fries were really really good but I didn't finish many of them because the burger was so huge.  Yes I finished the burger was I was at my limit.  Unless you're a big eater it's highly likely you should cut it in half from the get go and eat half then and half later.   My fiance really loved her cheeseburger and enjoyed her fries as well.  \\n\\nThis place is really damned busy on the weekends, although our waitress told us they keep making food until pretty late so if you come in later, like about 11pm-11:30pm you don't have that long of a wait.  But like i said, they do have a nice waiting area to have some drinks and hang out and eat some free popcorn while you wait so it's not all bad.\\n\\nDefinitely a must-visit place for out of towners and if you're native to Columbus you have to try it at least one time.  If you're really up for a challenge get the Thurminator which is the double Thurman burger!"},{"name":"Cuatro's","address":"1004 W 24th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Cuatros is one of those places that you REALLY want to give a good review of, but there just seems to be a lot of \\"eh\\" factors.\\n\\nFirst, the food. The portion size here is pretty tiny.  I've ordered the portobello tacos and the veggie tacos, both were tasty, but I could have had two plates of them.  Thankfully, they're pretty damn cheap.  Apps are inexpensive, especially during happy hour.  The fried pickle chips are yummy.\\n\\nSecond, the dranks.  The dranks here are 'eh'.  I tested my ladies marg - it was grody.  I would have returned it, but she insisted on finishing it even though it was gross.  Good news, the Sunday all day happy hour makes this a great place for cheap ass beers and football.\\n\\nThe patio is decent.  I wouldn't recommend sitting on the picnic tables for a lot of time though because it puts a lot of stress on the ole' backski.\\n\\nThe service has been mostly a miss.  I'm fairly certain that they ask the female servers to wear really tiny shorts.  That's a plus in my book, ha.  However, the few times that I have been here, the service has been relatively inattentive.  I think they were serving tables all over the restaurant or something.  \\n\\nAnyways, 3 stars is the best I can do.  Place is alright, take it with a grain of salt.

And believe me, I don't want this to be another \\"Finesse\\" (R.I.P.) review, but ...\\n\\nHaving only tried Chez Vincent (good food, snooty service), we are in search of a \\"go-tous\\" French restaurant (you know, one you feel good about encouraging EVERYONE to go ... some hybrid English-French humor there for you French speakers)  As I was saying: we had made a reservation to come 2 weeks ago to celebrate my bonus day, and then had to cancel last minute.  So last night, after walking out of FishBone's Happy Hour in Heathrow (to be more aptly renamed \\"Yappy Hour\\" or more like \\"HORDES Hour\\"), we thought, why not make it all the way up town?  A quick call and a reservation was secured.\\n\\nWe were pretty early (6:30 ish), but the place was kinda deserted for a Friday (maybe because they DON'T have a happy hour?).  Having just exhausted my supply of Ricard a few weeks ago, I was really looking forward to a tall glass of cold white gold, when I'm told: tres desoles, monsieur (actually I made that up, as nobody we came across spoke a word of French).  I thought at first, mon dieu, a French restaurant that doesn't carry Pernod or Ricard? Danny explained that it's because they're a beer and wine only restaurant. Should have paid more attention to the Yelp info...\\n\\nThey had a Julia Childs menu going - for $35 table d'hote, a 3-course dinner.  Sounds reasonable.  We both opted for the pate, for I believe that it's in their pate (and by their soups and sauces) that you know a chef's mettle.  It's the chicken liver variety, and this one, served warm with cumberland sauce.  I'd give it a 'B', no more and no less.  Just nothing that remarkable about it.  My wife said it came out of a can, but I'm reasonably sure it didn't.  It was served with some bleached onions and ... chopped TOMATOES?  Hmm...\\n\\nMy wife's beef bouguignon was served with some noodles, and of course I tasted it.  Menu clearly said tenderloin tips; I can't swear that it wasn't, but it might well have been bottom round, it was so over-cooked.  Just a few pieces of carrots in the unremarkable brown sauce - no evidence of wine, or lardons or bacon, no mushrooms, no pearl onion. \\"I've had Beef Bourguignon before, Sir\\", I felt like jumping up and saying to the dish, \\"Beef Bourguignon is a favorite of mine; YOU, sir, are no Beef Bourguignon\\".\\n\\nI was warned that my steak au poivre will be thin - sure enough, it lived up to the hype.  Peppercorns were not very abundant either; there was no cognac that I could detect, and only a little cream in the sauce.  But the most shocking discovery was a dollop of ... you guessed it - chopped tomatoes sitting on top of the steak and sauce!  I have never seen or heard of this barbaric practice - with all due respect to the lovely tomato species, they just have no place in a dish like the classic pepper steak.  Bizarre!\\n\\n\\"Presentation\\" for both dishes were shockingly unappealing, and nothing like the pictures on their website.\\n\\nCome dessert time, there was a measure of redemption.  (It helped tremendously that neither the crepes suzette nor the \\"Grand Marnier\\" souffle had our uninvited friend the chopped tomatoes on them).  Crepes were fine, sufficiently citrus-y, but insufficiently sauce-y.  Souffle was OK too, but who stole the Grand Marnier - I didn't taste any in it whatsoever.\\n\\nService was attentive throughout, although I did have to pour my own wine a couple of times (because I drink so fast??).  Everyone we encountered was friendly; the baguette was magnificent, but the decor, not so much.  My wife and I got into a friendly debate as to how important decor was to one's enjoyment of the restaurant.  While nicely decked out in tablecloths and linen, it felt more like a rustic American roadside inn than a French restaurant.  \\n\\nAll in all, I just found it hard to believe that this is a restaurant that the venerable Tom B. raved about a scant 8 months back.  It has to be due to a change in ownership/chef?  \\n\\nOutside, an old sign said, \\"Bon apetit, y'all\\".   That about sums it up: Le Coq Au Vin on this evening felt abut as French as ... well, Georgia.\\n\\nP.S.

My sister was in from LA and she wanted to try it because it was close to my house and we've never been there.  \\nIt started out okay...the salsa and chips were decent and we were hungry.  My sister got a frozen margarita and they brought out a HUGE drink.  She asked what size it was and the waiter said it was the jumbo size.  The jumbo size was crossed out in the menu so we didn't even think that was an option so she asked for the regular size instead.  When the waiter came back with her new drink, I thought it was a joke.  It was so small, I'm not even sure it was 6oz.  Needless to say $6 was way too much to pay for this sampler drink.  \\nI think our waiter was sober but it was hard to tell because I couldn't always understand him and he kept switching from English to Spanish.  When we finally ordered, I recommended that my sister try the fish tacos since she was a vegetarian but she kept telling me that she was going to try something else.  It wasn't until the waiter walked away that she told me the waiter said he wasn't sure if they had fish in the back for the fish tacos.  No fish?!  Weird.  Needless to say, she was now wary of the fish so she ended up getting a cheese enchilada and beans and I got the three soft tacos (one chicken, two carnitas) and rice.\\nIt would be really hard to screw up my food so I would rate it as okay.  I didn't like that the carnitas was served in big chunks vs. pulled but it wasn't a deal breaker.  My sister's food however was a deal breaker.  Not only did it look gross but it tasted gross too.  She said it was extremely heavy and not appetizing.  When the waiter finally came back he just looked at her and the food and said \\"You done.\\"  She said she didn't like it and that it was heavy and he just took her plate and left our table.  No can I get you something else or sorry you didn't like your food...there was no adjustments on our bill.  Nothing.

I really really wanted to. I lived in Columbia, SC for 3 years where there is a very large Greek population and this just... isn't it. I was here with my ex and service was lacking. Our waitress could not understand what we were saying when we wanted to order just ktipiti  and pita and we had to explain it 3 or 4 times. She did bring it out correctly, but it was very frustrating to begin with. I don't remember what the ex got, but I think he was decently happy. I got a small greek salad, and a moussaka and pastitsio combo platter that also came with a small piece of spanakopita. There was also some garlic bread served that was just okay.  Here is where I had a problem: all the food was very obviously reheated. The spanakopita was shriveled and soggy- I have microwaved my own homemade spanakopita before and even that didn't look as bad as the one served to me. The pastitsio and moussaka appeared to have been servings cut out of a pan of the larger dish judging by the square shape of the food, and although they tasted fine, again, they were obviously reheated. Whether they were microwaved or placed in the pizza oven for a few minutes to warm up is not something I can discern but they were very obviously not freshly prepared.

Mostly you will be sharing table with others. Wait to get in is ridiculous. It could even be 4 or 5 hours. I went in at around 12:30 on a Saturday, and my wait time was 1 hour (not so bad). The later you go the longer is your wait period. So you go in, put your name in the list and roam around and comeback later. \\n\\nBut the food is worth all the hassles. Sea food is super fresh and delicious. Maine lobster roll had a ton of chunky lobster filled in it. I took the hot buttered version. It is easily the best lobster roll I tasted. Sea urchin is something I tried for first time here. Live sea urchin was awesome. Initially I was hesitant to try it. But it was fresh, and didn't have any weird smell. Sea urchin meat was creamy and very soft. There is very less meat to eat though. Uni toast was good as well. Sea urchin meat was mixed with probably mayo and spread on a toast. Again as the sea urchin meat was fresh, there was absolutely no weird taste. I also went for the Neptune johnnycake. I loved the johnnycake part of the food. It was slightly sweet and buttery. But didn't like the fish part (smoked bluefish and caviar) that much. It was smelling too fishy for my taste.

The only thing I'd change is the recommendation the waitress gave us to use the onion chutney (I think it was onion chutney) with each bite. You definitely don't wanna do that because the chutney has such a strong flavor that it totally overpowers the taste of the marrow. The marrow stands on its own feet!! Enjoy it in its jello-y glory. That being said, the bread they serve it with pairs perfectly with it. Man..I'd have dreams about that bone marrow.\\n\\nThe beef bacon was not memorable, however. I'd pass on it.\\n\\nThe ribeye...omg the ribeye... It was so good. I ordered it charred rare as always and the char was good but it was sadly a little overcooked. Despite this, this might be the most enjoyable ribeye meal I've ever eaten. Or a super close 2nd place to the ribeye at The Metropolitan in downtown Seattle. The difference is that this ribeye has a lot of complex flavors going on that the latter does not (its topped with yummy chimmichuri and crunchy kava root on the side). Every single bite had me \\"yummmmm\\"ing and doing my happy delicious ribeye dance. 10/10 recommend getting this piece of beef heaven.\\n\\nThe panna cotta was suuuuper yummy too and it's the best panna cotta I've eaten in my mouth's recent memory.

We knew it was a food truck, but we were still surprised about the venue: it's situated in an outdoorsy patio kinda area, with an indoor bar as well. There are lights all over the place and umbrellas so even though it was night, the place still looked really nice. There was a band jamming in one corner and everyone was super loud, but the ambiance was very Austin-y.\\n\\nTHE FOOD:\\nWe ordered the garlic bread (since we heard it was a must have), the carbonara alexandra, the patrizi's red sauce, and an extra meatball on the side.\\n\\nIf you come here and do not order the garlic bread, go ahead and just throw the rest of your meal away. What you doin? ORDER THE GARLIC BREAD. It changed my life. It reminded me of the reason why i moved to America in the first place. I bit into it and it temporarily cured my depression. \\n\\nThe portion sizes were awesome; in fact, I'd recommend just eating half of your meal because the size is one of those where you could eat 2/3 of it but be way too full to finish the other 1/3 but then it's a hassle to bring such a small amount of food back home for leftovers. The carbonara was good; the noodles were amazing and the sauce was decent, but the bacon was a bit too fatty for my taste. Overall still an A dish tho. My boyfriend got the red sauce and his was also really good; I'd recommend getting it with the meatball. \\n\\nWe ended up eating inside the bar at a little table and there was a party celebrating a birthday so it was a bit loud, but it was fine because we were too focused on our food anyways. There's also 2 cats that roam around the bar so an extra star for that. \\n\\nTHE SERVICE\\nFor a food truck, they have pretty awesome service. There was a guy who helped my bf pick his entree out, and they also bring the food to wherever you're sitting.

Our group and the group we were sitting with all exchanged looks as we took in the fact that it could be awhile before we actually ate... a long while.\\n\\nI really wish I was joking or exaggerating here, it was easily 90 minutes between being shown to our table and when the chef finally came over.  Probably longer.  And he ran through our orders as they always do and got right into cooking.  Skipped right past my favorite part.... the sauces.  He served up the rice and I realized we didn't have any sauces yet, which they are supposed to do first, and requested that they be given out.  When he finally did dole them out he did it grumpily like we were irritating him.  The food was alright, but I did request no vegetables, which he confirmed back to me twice, and then still proceeded to put vegetables on my plate.  Luckily i was able to eat around them but it was annoying.\\n\\nHalf of our group had ordered sushi, which had obviously been made and then proceeded to sit out waiting for the rest of us to get our food from the hibachi chef, not one of them enjoyed the rolls they had ordered as they were not fresh.\\n\\nOh, and I almost forgot! As our chef was finishing up with the previous table, the wait staff sat another group at our table of four people, meaning we thought we would have to wait for them to order their food and have it prepped and whatnot before WE could eat.  But no, we didn't.  Instead they brought out a second chef (?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!) to cook for JUST THEM.  I *still* want to know where that guy came from?!\\n\\nThe ONLY and i mean ONLY saving grace, was our server.  She was extremely attentive and quick with the drinks, which we all needed to calm our starving nerves.  Even though I've been before and had decent experiences, it will take a LOT to get me back in there."},{"name":"Bar Mezzana","address":"360 Harrison Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"So glad I visited Bar Mezzana!

If you like ginger try the Moscow Mule. For dinner I had The Empire burger. It has a layer of pastrami (not fatty at all) for added meat. I coupled it with the bistro fries (you choose which side you want), I was in heaven. I went on a Monday night and it was quite full so I can only imagine how packed it gets on the weekend. Please note that they are not open on Sundays. In the restaurant section (you can get food anywhere...bar and outside hightop tables), they had live music with a local guitarist. He added a nice vibe. The bar faces outside windows separate from the dinning room yet feels very intimate. The bar also has hightop tables available. I usually don't visit the bathrooms, but had to go.  It was clean, but had no paper towels.  For me, this is officially one of my favorite Central Florida spots. Great for drinks and dinning.

Perfect for date night and they can accommodate large groups although seating MAY be limited and some of the tables comfortably seat 6. Their constantly rotating menu with fun mashups of different cuisines keeps things fresh. The owner and staff are so passionate and upbeat, you can't help but want to return. \\n\\n**Atmosphere - 5 Stars**\\nJenChans has a very homey atmosphere with chinese lanterns, group photos, and a kids chalkboard coloring station. On Sundays, they do a farm-table style family dinner so everyone can get to know each other since they are tight knit with the neighboring hoods. \\n\\n**Service  - 5 Stars**\\nThe staff has always been super nice and attentive. The owner (Emily) has approached my group and myself multiple times to ask how things are, requests constructive feedback, and infects you with her passion for this neighborhood and restaurant. \\n\\n\\n**Food  -  5 Stars**\\nFirst, they have their supper-club delivery service which you can order online and get delivered to your house, akin to meal service deliveries except these are frozen and feel so much more made-with-love.\\n\\nThey have a cooler of frozen/refrigerated items that range from small bites (e.g. charsui pork buns, egg rolls) to full meals (containers of black bean spare ribs, gouda/cheddar mac & cheese) which are also great. Not to mention shelves of homemade jams, oils and sauces.\\n\\nTheir lunch, brunch and dinner menu has its staple items plus a lot of specials that rotate through. I keep trying to work my way through the menu but it's proving to be difficult in the best of ways. Most items have asian influence but many times, Emily just asks her kitchen staff to come up with things based on their inventory. Salmon croquettes? Why not! (and of course they were amazing).\\n\\n**Prices - 5 Stars**\\nIt's great to have a spot that is not only reasonably priced for the area, but gives you a good quantity of quality food without feeling like you need to go into a food coma. There are specialty dishes that can run $20+ but you can easily find well-priced lunch and dinner options that will still satisfy.\\n\\n**Drinks - N/A**\\nThey should be acquiring their liquor license come the new year. My previous visits they were amazing about BYOB, having a free corkage service and providing glasses. Be sure to tip extra if you're going this route because your bill is going to be smaller than usual with all the great prices :)"},{"name":"Seven Hens","address":"2140 N Decatur Rd","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"We picked up some dinner here on a weeknight and they had a good amount of people in here.

I recently enjoyed dinner for three at Castagna and while it was the earliest possible seating (5:30 pm) the second most surprising thing about this gastronomic gem was the completely empty dining room. We were the only table for 2.5 hours. The most surprising thing however was not the utter lack of customers (which admittedly was actually kind of cool because it felt like we had reserved an entire restaurant) it was the food! Oh good heavens the food! \\n\\nThere are three options to choose from at Castagna. One can select the seasonally appropriate 10 course tasting menu, the equally intriguing vegetarian option or the expanded tasting menu (roughly 15-20 courses).  In addition its either individual wine selection, opt in for a pre-determined wine paring or an exciting reserve pairing to compliment the meal. We decided on the standard winter tasting menu with the reserve wine pairing for two.\\n\\nChef Woodward has created a fantastic journey for the winter menu and the nameless Sommelier's reserve pairing is equally exciting, serving up unique wines of impeccable provenance and vintage. \\n\\nIf a gun were held to my temple forcing me to to summarize an overall theme for the menu I would shout Japanese inspired with a nutty, earthy and richly savory current throughout. It was delicious! \\n\\nWith ten plates arriving in a perfect choreography of orgasmic, tastebud overload there wasn't a single miss which seems supremely difficult to achieve given the number of dishes. Castagna is a gorgeous, decadent experience and truly unique in a town known for spectacular restaurants and innovative Chefs.

The price of their baked goods and other dishes are comparable to other bakeries and I'd prefer to stop here for a fresh pastry over national chain coffee shops that will charge a similar price for a lower quality.  \\n\\nThe bun was delicious.  It was very very sweet, which j love, but I'd recommend getting a mini or another pastry entirely if you don't have a sweet tooth.

And maybe the owner who stands near the door to welcome customers. The others talks with customers like racism. The food takes forever to come and they always forget something in ur order because they just stand there and pay very little attention to you while you are ordering.

This place not only has good service (the waitress like, REALLY understood me...like really) but their food is dynamite. \\n\\nThe inside is so cute. We sat at a table for 8 which was long and had mini stools that made us feel like we were at the kids table. However, I would recommend sitting here if you are going to indulge in their amazing margaritas because it is closer to the ground in case you fall off your stool. The atmosphere is altogether fun. It is a mix between... I'm on the coast with my boat docked outside... and... Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville. \\n\\nThe flavors will blow you away! We tried quite a few things. The tacos are literally the best I've had, and I consider myself a Colorado taco connoisseur. I have lived here my entire life, and I realize I am making a bold statement, but this just became my favorite taco of Colorado. I love the duck taco. It is saucy and flavorful. Most of these tacos are saucy and rich, so you must balance it out with some street corn and chips and  guac. Both of which are delicious! I won't lie, the chips and guac is more like an uncooked toasta shell and guac, but the guac is good enough to drown out the weird tostada accompaniment. The street corn is the perfect mini size so you still have room to feast on everything else. I tried the short rib, duck, fish and chicken tacos. All were delicious. The fish is fried, the chicken has a sauce that tastes like an Indian curry, and the short rib is a sticky rich sweet brown sauce. \\n\\nI hear the maragaritas are good. They have a great selection of beers on tap and in the bottle and I tried one of the cocktails which was fabulous. If you are feeling adventurous, try The Revivalist. It is so refreshing and delicious, it will make you feel like you just left the spa. \\n\\nI am bringing my family back next week so I can make sure the food is still good a week later, but I'm telling you peeps...this place is the top taco of the town!"},{"name":"Luke's Lobster Back Bay","address":"75 Exeter Street","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Love love love Luke's Lobster.

This is one of my favorite go to lunch ideas when I'm out and about my day and I was so excited to see that they opened this place up on my campus!

You will very often find them giggling behind the counters and goofing off and taking their time doing unrelated work things before taking your order and when they do, they often come off rude. I've also seen them eating behind the counter in areas where it shouldn't be seen to customers and they violate sanitary rules. One of the guys working here always goofs off and gives awful vibes making me have to wonder whether I even want to order from there or not and deal with him for those couple of seconds. \\n2. I have come there multiple times hoping that maybe the next time would be better but every time I happen to go there my sandwiches are made absolutely POORLY. They either A. Don't make them correctly and leave out half of what's supposed to be included in the sandwich (I know this because it is obvious & I order the same two sandwiches every time.) Or B. They make them so awful without adding enough mayo to the French bread choices. Making you question what you paid for because they just slap all of it on there poorly and having half of it hanging out between the bread. \\nWhat an absolute disappointment.

Sort of like liholiho in SF if y'all ever have gone there. Their menu is Asian/Korean/American fusion, and had a lot of options without being too expansive. We decided on the scallops ($26), pork chop ($26), bone marrow ($19), wagyu a4 ($26), and asparagus ($9). We also ordered the Jim bean flight ($22) and a Moscow mule ($11). \\n\\nAll the food was SO GOOD. \\n\\nSome highlights: \\nOur taste buds were first blessed by the melt-in-your-mouth wagyu that we got to self grill on a sizzling hot salt block. So flavorful and unique, but definitely not something that can fill you up.

Very rich in flavor, and I believe most bone marrow fans would be pleased. A bit oily imo, but I am not the biggest fan of bone marrow as a whole.  Still fairly enjoyed this dish. \\n\\nThe pork chop was decent, but the pancake upon which it sat was the star in my opinion. It was what I assume their take on a Korean pajun. Just a touch sweet and paired so well with the savory pork. This is also the largest portioned dish, and would be great to order to help fill you up ~ \\n\\nThe asparagus were served with a cream sauce that enhanced the flavor so much. Such a treat and great to eat to balance out all the protein we inhaled. \\n\\nThe only downside was the wait, but we expected a long wait being that it was a Saturday evening of Memorial Day weekend.

I have had a really hard time finding this dish at other Mexican restaurants, and was dying to try it at El Potro.  Needless to say it didn't disappoint.  It came dry, but I remedied this by adding some of the salsa and was quickly on my way.  The masa cake was perfectly cooked and thick enough to carry the toppings without getting soggy.  I'll definitely be ordering this again, next time with pork (which I find I prefer vs. the beef).\\n\\nI tried the tamale last, which was in truth my least favorite part of the meal but still had great flavor.  My only negative was that the potato was a bit much with everything else in there.\\n\\nThe final bill came to a whopping....$20.90.  Not bad, right?  I'd recommend ordering off the apps & hurache/tortas menu as opposed to a taco plate.  There is too much amazingness to be had and wasting stomach space on rice and beans would be an amateur move.  It's also the best way to try a lot of different things on the cheap.\\n\\nSo!  Ignore the painted horses on the chairs and the weird tiki style bar thing at the back and head straight for the tacos, huraches, and pupusas.  \\n\\nIf you're thinking about heading over to Cantina instead, let me mention that two times I went there my friends and I had a nice 60+ minute wait to get our mediocre food.  The service is infinitely better at El Potro, and you can't beat the prices."},{"name":"J.

However, I didn't really like the texture and lack of flavor of the squash competing with the risotto. I have nothing against squash, though! I'd like to say that the seasonal dish cost around $40.\\n\\nI was so full that I skipped dessert which rarely happens.

I think they were a special item, but their potato skins are a delicious way to start a meal. The Rita's Chicken really stands out. The flavor is amazing, and the dinner portion is HUGE. I always end up taking one of the two cutlets home, plus half of whatever side I order. The Blackened Chicken Pasta is also pretty delicious, but honestly...just order the Rita's Chicken. You won't be disappointed!! I'm not a big rice fan, so I always substitute the rice for the cheese grits, which are heavenly. Their sweet potato fries are also very tasty, and even though I'm not a rice fan, the dirty rice IS good. I would like to see more vegetable side options, or at least an option to have a side salad. They don't have small salads at all; they're all full sized meal salads. \\n\\nTibby's is loud. Don't go here expecting a quiet dinner. It's a New Orleans themed restaurant, so the walls are covered in art and artifacts to reflect that. They do have both regular tables and booths, but the booths are limited. There is a full bar, so you can get your drink on. \\n\\nThe service is decent, though I wouldn't call it extraordinary or even great. But, it is good enough. I was very disappointed when I went at dinner time and asked for a lunch sized portion, and they refused to do that, even with a menu item that is on the lunch menu. It was a really big turn off, actually. I get that dinner portions=larger and they get to charge more, but what about those of us who don't want such huge portions? And the manner in which they refused to do this was just obnoxious. The server that night was forced to back and forth multiple times and be a go between, which I felt really bad for him, as he was sent back and forth to our table multiple times to deliver the message that the manager could have easily just walked out and delivered themselves. (I asked if it was possible, he said he'd double check, went back to ask, came back and asked \\"Why do you want a lunch sized portion?\\" then went back again to talk to manager. Then he came back again to deliver the manager's message. This went on for one more back & forth. Excessive, much?)\\n\\nI enjoy Tibby's for the most part, so I'll be back!!

Nice and flaky, but drowned in the sauce. The taco shell was soft and because of all the sauce and juices, it was a bit soggy & I was hesitant to place it back on the serving dish because it was soaked in the before mentioned sauce & drippings.

I got the PONKO chicken tenders with sweet potato fries. The chicken is good, nice texture with the breading. There was just nothing distinguishing these tenders from another restaurant. At the $11 price point for 5 small tenders, I'll take my business elsewhere. I also got the potato salad and side of rice. As you can tell from my photo, 2-3 bites of each and I was done. The potato salad had no flavor and I make the same rice at home. I also got a green bean dish, which was a special add onto the menu during this time. As good as it looks, there was no flavor to the green beans outside of the onions. I prefer to not spend money for food I can make at home.\\n\\nThe service and atmosphere saved this place for me.

This is a change because previously they took plastic but today no such luck.  If it's because their machine is down he could have said \\"I'm sorry our machine is down we can only take cash\\".

For our entrees, we got the fish & chips and scallops. I love crispy brussel sprouts, so decided to sub in my seasonal vegetables for the brussels with a slight upcharge. Big mistake - they were steamed with absolutely no flavor. Not good. The scallops were alright, but definitely nothing fancy. The fish and chips tasted better than the scallops, but still didn't blow me away.
