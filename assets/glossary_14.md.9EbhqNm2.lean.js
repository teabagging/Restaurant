The restaurant was busy but not overly crowded, they clearly have the reservation process perfected to not keep parties waiting.The restaurant is stunning - large windows look over Kenmore square, letting lots of sunlight in while cool, muted tones create a warm and comfortable atmosphere.  The atmosphere is vibrant while not overly noisy.  This is NOT a stuffy restaurant where you need to whisper - we enjoyed the hustle/bustle and feeling connected to all the activity.The staff were fabulous.  Several staff were looking after our needs; being attentive but not obtrusive and truly engaging us in the process of ensuring every need was being tended to.  Several wait staff spent several minutes talking with us and asking us about various aspects of our experience - what restaurant has enough staff to take the time do that?  They made it seem effortless.The food was incredible:\\n- oysters perfectly prepared and presented with just the right garnishes; best we've ever had!\\n- luscious drinks\\n- beautiful heirloom tomato salad\\n- perfectly prepared calamari\\n- gorgeous seared scallops with chorizo, potatoes and greens\\n- succulent lobster roll on brioche \\n \\nHearing it was our anniversary, the staff also comp'd us a pair of oyster sliders; a taste of sparkling rose, and a dessert.

I hope you find this review useful:TYPE OF FOOD\\nWhat I understand from the marketing, the reviews and my experience -- the chef's concept for this restaurant is faithfully translating Thai cuisine and a little bit of the culture for us to experience domestically.Having said that, my personal opinion is that real Thai cuisine is not exactly the most delicious food deserving of such reputation. Was the food good? Yes -- But If a Thai family moved to Portland and opened up this same restaurant, I doubt we would go ga-ga over it.___HAVING SAID THAT... I LOVE THE CONCEPT AND ATTENTION TO DETAIL\\n___\\nNow that I got that out of the way, I thought they put together something pretty cool.+ Good service\\n+ Good food\\n+ Appreciate the food concept\\n+ Appreciated the offbeat environment\\n+ Appreciate the website branding\\n+ Slightly pricey, but not too badI had the house special wings, house special pokpok salad and the seafood pancake.I thought it was all pretty decent but to say that it was some sort of revelation would be a lie. Wings were tasty but I've had better wings. PokPok salad was not amazing and I'm sure if a PDX pod made the same thing, nobody would care. The seafood pancake was pretty good with rice. Bottom line, I am happy I had the experience but I would not come back because the cuisine did not captivate me. I would go to their whiskey lounge though and get the wings there!*Note: I am teetering between 2 or 3 stars and I choose 2 because I would not come back ultimately. 3 would imply I would go back."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Really good restaurant.

I've tried B&G and Neptune. I like them all, but my favorite is ICOB. Food: \\n- Oysters: their oysters are the freshest among all three, at least during my visits, and the oyster liquor is always perfectly preserved in the shell (I love drinking it!). I tried the West Coast ones during my first visit. I personally prefer the briny taste of East Coast oysters. Island Creek and Wellfleet are my favorites because of their finish. \\n- Sliders: decent, not as good as I thought when I was reading the Yelp review. Oyster was a bit hard. The sauce was good, but the bread was a bit dry. \\n- Clam chowder: good. It was a bit on the creamy side. It was not possible to have a spoonful of liquid only, since the whole bowl was full of goodies. It doesn't mean the taste was messy. All the ingredients were well balanced/ proportioned. \\n- Mussels: very unique and worth trying. Mussels are one of my favorite dishes, so I always order it whenever I try a new restaurant. This one was def different. No shells and had a hint of Thai food taste: lemon grass, a little sour and spicy (Fresno I think). \\n- Lobster roll: good; different from the ones I had at all the other places. To be honest, the amount of lobster chunks was prob the least compared to all the places I've been to. However, the sauce was pretty good and more sophisticated. I like the celery (is it? might be some other veggies) touch. The bread wasn't on the dry side. It was def lighter than the one I had at Neptune. I think this is personal preference, so I won't say which one is better (if you don't care about the amount of lobster on your bread).\\n- Bluefish: it was the special on my first visit. It was very juicy and tender, especially compared to all the other western food restaurants I've tried. The sauce and the sides were both nearly perfect. \\n- Swordfish: because of my pleasant experience with the fish here last time, I decided to order the special fish again this time. It was ummm... a little disappointing. The fish was completely overcooked. It was too dry for me to eat. I had a bite and left it on my plate. Everything else on the plate was quite good. However, not worth the money since I only ate the sides.\\n- Alcohol: large wine list by bottle; limited but quality list by glass.Service:\\nThe service is absolutely among one of the best. You don't get your own waiter/waitress for the table. There are multiple people taking turns serving one table I think. Almost everyone is very nice, attentive, knowledgeable, and helpful. The pace serving is very good. AND they take reservations (no offense to Neptune fans)!Ambiance/Settings:\\nVery spacious and romantic. I personally don't like (kinda) sharing the table with strangers if I'm having dinner at a supposedly nice restaurant. I prefer to stand up or leave for the restroom whenever I have a need (again, no offense to Neptune fans). The decor and settings are lovely.

This place has thrown off the previous holder, Lineage, and takes the crown. Literally this was like a food fantasy. I've never had such delicious things. We started with 18 oysters. We ran the gamut and tried unusual different kinds. They were fresh, and cold, and so delicious. We opted that we liked the Misty and East Beach Blondes the best. The Belon, European oyster, was very special... very oceany... not in a good way. LOL. Then the bread. Omg crunchy chewy bread, with house made butter with cayenne, honey, and red sea salt. YUM! Best bread I've had for free. I had to hold back on asking for more. \\nMy boyfriend got the butter poached lemon sole with lobster. It was light and delicious. The portion was quite large with 4 little cones of fish wrapped around a good amount of lobster. He ordered a side of cremini mushrooms that were cooked perfectly. Now for the star... I have the Lobster roe noodles, with lobster, short rib, Brussels sprouts, and squash. This was the most delicious dish ever. The smell was strong and inviting. The roe noodles smelled like the ocean. The lobster was grilled and had great char but wasn't over done. The short ribs were unctuous and coated my mouth with yummy beef fat. The combination seems strange on paper but comes together in the most amazing fashion. After all this food we were stuffed, but it was my boyfriend's birthday so we needed dessert. We had the chocolate pudding. This is not like pudding I've had. That Jell-O company should be arrested and hanged for calling what they serve pudding. THIS IS PUDDING. It was smooth and creamy and surprisingly dense. Very nice chocolate bitter bite. We were presented with 2 shots of house made Irish liqueur. Wow. It was boozy. But clearly in a good way. It complemented the pudding and completed this wonderful experience. The atmosphere is comfy and super relaxed. The funky wall of oyster shells and cool fences and wood gave a super beachy feel. There were tons of people in after work clothes but several people in jeans. I'm now saving every penny so I can eat here once a month and relive this great experience.

I sampled my friend's garganelli, which was much more delicious.  Also had the brussels sprouts appetizer, which was good, but there were only about ten sprouts, and it cost $7.  The desserts were actually quite good, and the only part of the meal that I really enjoyed.I'd give Bistro Du Midi four stars if I had ordered the garganelli and the entrees were say, $7 less.

Though a bit pricey (more recently, it was about $22 a person for dinner), the serving of kalbi is pretty large and comes with denjang jjigae that reminds me of home.  The banchan options are pretty diverse and the kimchi is always tasty.Honestly, I rarely get anything other than the kalbi.  I've had the bibimbab, kimchi jjigae, chapchae, and mandoo -- all of which are very tasty (and a lot a bit better than most of the other Korean restaurants in the area), but ChungKiWa is a kalbi house and it's obvious as to why this is.When I can't get to my mom's (obviously superior) home cooking, I will rock ChungKiWa.  A note about the spotty service: I've been there and have waited upwards of 45minutes to get a waitress at my table (the place wasn't that busy). I've also been there and have been treated like their most favorite customer. It really depends on the day (and where Jupiter is, in relation to Mercury OR if there's a full moon OR if your with your Korean parents who are acquainted with the entire waitstaff....)"},{"name":"Chick-fil-A","address":"3410 Camp Creek Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Yay I can eat at Chik-Fil-A again since they ended there anti-gay policies.

They were super busy on a late Saturday night.  The only seats for our small group was at the deli counter.  So, we stood there a bit.  The bartenders were busy fixing drinks for their customers, while we looked on from this sideview/counter area.  Sort of an interesting set up.  There were 4 or 5 menus sitting to the side, so we grabbed those.  A lot of paper-regular food menu, happy hour menu, wine menu, drink menu.  We flagged someone down and ordered IPAs and tried getting a Prosecco. The bartender offered an option that was \\"close\\". ? All that wine on their list and I didn't see a Prosecco.  The beer was great.  I am not sure which one, as I couldn't see the chalkboard of their offerings, my friend just ordered \\"IPA\\". They serve the pints in cool jars.  It appears they have about 6 unique draft beers. I completely understand busy bar, Saturday night, downtown, but as we looked on  to the deli, food prep area from our seats---not one staff member greeted us or acknowledged us.  \\nIf I could secure a proper seat at the bar I might give it another go.

This \\"satellite\\" location has a slightly more limited menu than their full sized restaurants. They have enough items to keep me happy for a long time though including their delicious PB & J smoothie.  You can get any of their burritos in \\"mini\\" size for a pretty cheap price of around $4. I'm a huge fan of these. At lunch time there is a grab n go section full of recently assembled burritos for you to pick up on your way through line and avoid the creation time.

The wonton noodle soup had literally most delicious noodles I have ever eaten in my life. Noodles!! Noodles aren't even supposed to really have any taste! But these were freaking good. Even the chicken fried rice was extremely tasty and not greasy. The black bean chicken was kind of like the black bean chicken at the usual mediocre Chinese restaurant, but made into something fresh and light and beautiful.

I have no complaint whatsoever about the service.At the end of the dinner when we got the bill, the $40 or so for the two of us felt like nothing to spend compared to the delight we had just experienced.

I will not be back.  We reserved a table at 8:00 for a large group last Saturday night via their phone reservation system.  The reservation information never got to the restaurant and therefore they did not have a table for us.  For the next hour they constantly said there should be a table opening up soon.  When we were finally seated, the server took our order right away and food slowly started coming out for everyone at the table except for me.  I had ordered the grilled vegetables and the lamb.  After 45 minutes of waiting I was told that my vegetables would be up soon but that they had run out of lamb.  I was told they took the tickets in order that they were received in the kitchen and that when they got to mine there was no more lamb.  Hmmm, other people in our group got their food in a relatively timely matter, why is it the kitchen didn't get my lamb order for 45 minutes?  I ordered duck in place of the lamb and I was again told that my vegetables would be up soon.  15 minutes later I flagged down the server (by this point I was more than a little irritated) and motioned to the table in front of me asking if I was going to get ANY food).  The vegetables miraculously showed up 5 minutes later - they were mostly raw and barely even warm.  The duck was a few minutes later and once again undercooked.  I hardly ate anything.  By this time I had had enough and asked for my bill that took a further 15 minutes.  I finally left the restaurant at 11:00 pm from an 8:00 reservation and had to stop to get something to eat on the way home.  I should have talked to the manager right there and then but I was too upset and hungry - I just wanted out of there.

Yes, sometimes that means I'm a little caffeinated, but that's quite okay with me.  On our way out of Orlando, we stopped by Lineage coffee for our, er- my, daily caffeine fix.  I typically judge a coffee shop by their menu, the larger and vast their menu, the lower my expectations.  If they're serving food + desserts + coffee + 100 other items, I won't expect much.  In my experience, the simpler the menu, the better the coffee, as they only need to focus on a few drinks.Lineage has a simple menu: espresso, filtered coffee, and cold brews.  Easy as 1-2-3.It's harder to rate coffee when I have it iced, but it was probably 70 something + humidity that day (and it this was mid-morning) so there's no way I'm going with a hot drink.  I had the iced latte, and upon first sip I didn't like it.  It was a little too bitter, tasted maybe even a little burnt.  I brought it back to the barista, and he was super cool about it- offered to make me a new cup with sweetner.  Now typically, I never sweeten my drinks so I was a little surprised.  It was good though, much better the second time around.Located at East End Market (marketplace), along with a number of artisanal vendors including bakeries and succulents shops.

Largest order of fish and chips ever! The batter of the fish sticks were crispy but not too heavy, and the fish inside was still flaky and not overcooked.

The fried oyster had a nice consistency, and the brioche was good, but I could have used more of the aioli. Overall, I loved most of the food at Island Creek, and would recommend dining at thiis restaurant if you're visiting Boston. They also offer complimentary sparkling water, which is a really nice perk. The only negatives we experienced is a couple of dirty glasses/creamer. The bfs water had some black things floating in it, which could be from their filters, but my cream (for coffee) had some weird orange chunks floating in it, and the bf also had a hair on his toast. Hopefully these are just weird one-off occurances, since this restaurant is really swanky and clean looking.

The size of the restaurant is at best 500 to 600 square feet.  The kitchen itself is open to patron visibility and occupies approximately 250 sq ft of the establishment.  While patrons decide on their consumables for an evening's consumption, they can view the handy work of the chef.  Ultimately, the restaurant atmosphere can be described as cramped & hot (given the open kitchen).  Nevertheless, the simplistic feel renders a slightly charming impression for this North End establishment.Service:  Perhaps the highlight of the evening.  The service was efficient and detailed oriented.  Our server was friendly and swift at presenting beverages and bread during seating.  Orders were taken at a moment's notice and requests for refills were granted in a timely manner.The Food:Calamari & Clam Linguine w/ Red Sauce: Presented on the 12\\" inch skillet for which the application was prepared, the dish itself appeared to be a classic rendition of the Italian staple.  Excessive amounts of Linguine were topped with a generous portion of Calamari & diced Clams.  The addition of Parsley provided the added color contrast to bring out the elements of the application.  Sadly, the presentation was all the noteworthy praise that can be rendered to this dish.  At first bite, the initial impression of the dish was bland!  The tomato sauce used in the application lacked any notable seasoning.  No hints of salt or pepper were detected in the sauce.  The texture of the tomato sauce appeared to be watery, thus lacking the thick consistency to properly coat the pasta.  Given the texture of the sauce, there was an extreme distortion of flavors between the mild tomato sauce and the starchiness of the pasta.  In addition, the seafood was excessively overcooked, to the point in which the texture was rubbery and difficult to consume.  The natural sweetness and scrumptiousness of the seafood was virtually non-existent. \\"Aglio Olio\\" - Black Linguine w. Sauteed Squid: Squid Ink Linguine topped with Diced Squid is sauteed with a based of Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Butter, White Wine & Garlic.  During consumption, patrons will find that the immediate impression of the dish is the exponential aromatics and flavoring of Garlic stemming from the Garlic Oil used as the sauced in the application.  Although the permeating scent and flavor of garlic was in some ways appealing, the excessive presence could've been subdued just slightly.  Similar to the Linguine & Clam application, the dish lacked seasoning!  The flavor derived from the application stemmed from the fruity Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Garlic.  At no time was any detection of seasoning discovered during consumption.  Although the sauteed squid did provide the much welcoming salty base for the application, they were overcooked and lacked the juicy texture commonly known of squid.  As for the Black Linguine, the freshly made pasta did have a nice clean finish.  Unfortunately, the pasta itself was slightly undercooked with certain strands being discarded to the side due to inedibility.It goes without saying, the technical and execution flaws observed in these dishes could easily be remediated had a sampling of our food been taken prior to presentation.  Sadly, the following impressions were observed at the conclusion of our meal...1) The tomato sauce needs seasoning and herbs!\\n2) The White Wine / Garlic Oil base of the \\"Aglio Olio\\" needs a kick (perhaps Red Pepper Flakes or a Jalapeno Pesto).Perhaps the 75 minute wait could've been better spent at another North End establishment.  Like the saying goes...  \\"Curiosity Kill the Cat\\".  In this particular case, curiosity killed $80 from my wallet and 2 hours of my life!"},{"name":"Sam LaGrassa's","address":"44 Province St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Easiest five star rating I've given in a long time.

Upon walking in, the menus on the wall and in the window are just completely overwhelming.  It takes a while to get through the menu but the staff are very nice to offer some advice (though they will tell you that everything is good--which we all know is just not true).  You order at the counter and then seat yourself.  I assume that this is supposed to be a quicker alternative than ordering at the table, however, it takes about 15 minutes to go through the menu on the wall.  It was quite confusing to go through the \\"mess\\" descriptions named after relatives aka \\"mamma\\", \\"nephews\\", etc.   Not quite a different language but really close.  The pasta sauces are homemade as are the pastas.  My fiance and I tried the pastas of the day: prosciutto ravioli with their homemade marinara sauce.  I got a mixture of the ravioli and tortellinis of the day: goat cheese ravioli and spinach tortellini with alfredo sauce.  My sister-in-law tried the Nephew's Mess--which is apparently an assortment of pasta, primarily ziti, eggplant parmesan, a spaghetti meatball, and sausage.   And we got an order of spaghetti & meatballs for the kids to try.  We also got an order of 8 garlic bread pieces.Of all of these, the only one that was partly tasty was the prosciutto ravioli and the garlic bread.  The kids were not interested in the meatballs at all.  The meatballs were HUGE, the size of a tennis ball, and I tasted a hint of pate mixed into the meatball.  My alfredo sauce was just not creamy as I would have liked though the goat cheese ravioli was decent.   My sister-in-law's mess was appropriately named, it was a complete MESS.  The meatball was the same meatball as the kids meal, but the rest was just...\\"interesting.\\"  What was just noted as sausage on the wall menu was actually blood sausage, which was NOT what we had in mind.

Started with spicy rice cakes. These are a very thick rice noodle in a spicy tomato based sauce. I believe there was also cabbage mixed in. Very good. A very strong sauce. Next, we had the Japchae, which is a sweet potato noodle mixed with thin slices of beef, sesame seeds, and cabbage. Very VERY good. Very similar to Mei Fun, which I love. Finally, we had the Soon Tofu with Seafood. I'm not a seafood girl, so he picked out the octopus, mussels, scallops, and shrimp for me. It's a delicate beef/seafood broth with silken tofu, frozen vegetables (I think), and a raw egg. It was absolutely delicious. It is served with a bowl of white rice and the two together tastes amazing as well.

The place manages to feel intimate while being airy and spacious.  In my case there wasn't even a wait on a Friday night, though this was likely due to it being Halloween.  (In case I had forgotten what day it was, the family of 4 skeletons next to us certainly would have reminded me.)I chose to skip the raw oysters this time around, but I've had them at the sister restaurant in the Seaport and they were great.  I instead went for the fried clams and fries.  The clams were excellent, as were the bread and fancy butter at the start of the meal.  However, I'm a bit of a French fry connoisseur (if I do say so myself) and the seasoning on these wasn't quite right.  My friends loved their dishes (lobster roll and a salad -- yeah, I know, who gets a salad at a seafood place...) and we all loved the buttermilk biscuit, though we were admittedly a little perplexed by the amount of honey on it.I had drinks as well -- the first was a Halloween special cocktail that was fine but underwhelming.  The second was a hot buttered rum dessert drink that was absurdly delicious.  I wish I had one right now, in fact...The service had some room for improvement.  A bit hard to get someone's attention, and they seemed annoyed at times when we did.  An off night, perhaps?All-in-all, I'll certainly be back because most of the food was delicious and the atmosphere was very pleasant.

I got the crab cakes eggs benedict with potatoes which was a classically done benedict period. My friend Annie got the house specialty, the lobster eggs benedict which did not disappoint either.  Because one entree is never quite enough (right? right?) and the never-ending dilemma between sweet and savory brunch continues, we also ordered the lemon-ricotta pancakes topped with fresh, in season blueberries.  I don't even like lemon flavored desserts but I could probably eat this every day.  Big yum here.   The waiter didn't even judge us for ordering three entrees either; if he secretly was, he played it totally cool and suggested he bring it to us later as a dessert.  This guy really got us.  Because of the brunch wait, there can be large crowds, especially when the weather isn't as nice as it was this weekend, and the entire place can get quite stressy but psttttt....they take reservations and they're reasonably good about sticking to them despite the crowd.So make a reservation and get over there to enjoy some classics and lemon ricotta pancakes!"},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"This is the biggest bookstore I've ever been to!!!

The prices are extremely reasonable ($8-$15) given the huge portion size of each dish (definitely splittable between two).

The Pho was good, not great, but if not for other factors I'd have come back to eat it again.  My brother's Bun was good, the egg roles were tasty, the grilled chicken had a good lemon grass flavor but the texture was chewy and fatty.  The service was friendly and very quick despite a large lunch crowd.  I was not so happy about the CNN / Fox / whatever being played a loud volume over the speakers in the ceiling.  However, what really did it in for my was how dirty the place was.  The more you looked around the more you noticed how filthy everything was.  The floor, the chairs, the tables, I did not venture to the bathroom.  In addition, the been sprouts that came out with the Pho where nasty, brown and many of them starting to rot.

Was it good?  Thankfully I got a positive response and my uncles girlfriend liked this place enough that we could practically have a private dinner, a good meal and above all else, something healthier than Hons.Most of the food that was ordered for our three tables in this snug restaurant were of the vegetable variety.  A little bit of meat to add flavour, but it was the vegetables in most of these dishes that were the highlight.A lot of the food that was ordered were quite unique to the people at our table and I must say, that despite their unique flavours, this was probably the most Chinese meal I've had in a long time.  The food is basically Cantonese and the presentation was very welcome to the typical dishes that you find being pumped out of Wontun kitchens and Hong Kong Cafes.  A few of the highlight dishes were:\\nThe brown rice medley encased in Lotus leaves.   The lotus leaves infused the rice with this wonderful scent and flavour.  It had a flavour of freshness and it wasn't greasy.  It was very clean on the palate.There was a large green squash (like a large Japanese pumpkin style squash) that was stuffed with all kinds of root type vegetables and oxtail.  I think everything was cooked inside the squash.  It was presented like a soup bowl, but in this case the soup was like a stew and the bowl was edible and naturally sweet from the squash.  The Oxtail was really really good. Probably one of the best I've had in years.There was a \\"yuba\\" (sorry I only know the Japanese word for it) type tofu dish that was very good.  It was gone in 60 seconds flat.There was another Tofu dish with eggplant and scallops.A chicken dish with black fungus.  I loved the black fungus and the chicken was tender, but wish the pieces weren't so boney.  Either that, or by the time I got to eat a piece of chicken all the good stuff was gone.There were many more dishes served that night and they would all rate at least a 4 star or higher for this type of cuisine.  Honestly, I haven't had such an authentic Cantonese meal like this in a long time.The place is pretty small.  We had 3 tables of ten and there was only one other large table and two small tables left.  The service was very nice and when someone asked for a description of the ingredients in the dishes, they were pretty accurate.  Of course, if you could speak Cantonese, this would help better.We did have some unique dishes, like a dried fruit platter and french pastries, but that was from the owner of Garlane Pharmacy and a staff member.  The restaurant was gracious enough to serve it with the meal which was finished off with a tapioca/squash/goji berry desert.  Slightly sweet from the squash and that unique goji berry flavour that finished the evening with more authenticity.I'm pretty sure, that if there are enough people to ask for it,  This could be the first place to start the brown rice revolution served in Chinese restaurants.**note to self. -- keep asking for brown rice options wherever I go that offers white rice.  Sooner or later, enough people will ask and it will be offered.Big note to others.  The food we had, may not garner quite the star rating as I placed.\\nThere were a few individuals who weren't used to this kind of food and I can imagine someone who loves HK cafe's or Wonton places or even  regular run of the mill Chinese restaurants, may rate it a 3 star instead of a 4 or 5.  For me, the experience and the variety of flavours that I had that night were second to none.

It's one of Yelp's existential questions. Especially in Podlandia.A restaurant has a roof, chairs, a nice staff, they bring your food to the table. They sometimes have music. There is beer and wine. They serve food on plates, drinks in glasses, that are washed and reused. Metal cutlery. They might have a television if it's a sports bar. Or a piano if it's a piano bar. A little espresso to finish your meal. Some restaurants even own their Yelp listing and publish hours. They have quality ingredients, are tasty and expensive.D-48 has all that minus the price. It's the next generation of food pod.We have A1 Bird Baths, the adjacent business that has built this pod, to thank. Some of their statues and fountains enhance the decor.The menu is limited and carnivorous. The gem is a hand formed beef-pork burger, 3/4 inch thick cooked. It's on nice bun, grilled onions, cheese, microgreens, fresh tomato. As Bob M, who discovered this spot, mentions, it also has the D-48 famous ghost sauce. It has a just above subliminal heat, and a touch of raspberry that works. They can substitute a chicken cutlet for the burger on request. How much would you pay for this burger in a restaurant? About 10-15 or more. At D-48 it's $5.Maybe you would like a rib eye steak with grilled potatoes and vegies? How about $7? Microbrew with that meal or while you are waiting to take your order home? How about $2 for a pint of Burnside Oatmeal Pale (24oz for $3)? They have rotating microkegs and a macro. Wine too, some even from a bottle, served in a stemmed glass.The space has several covered rooms, a bar area for chatting with the barista, bartender, server; a space closed in on three sides, near the kitchen smells, where a singer songwriter was playing the night I dropped by; an almost fully enclosed room with chairs, couches, a piano and a TV; the large back room open on the sides with large tables, where alcohol is not allowed; and a front room with a fire pit.If the kitchen is backed up, it can take some time for your meal to be cooked. The kitchen is not necessarily designed as a downtown, quick grab lunch operation. But the space is comfortable to hang out in, and maybe have a beverage in the meantime. The staff were excited to be working at this neighborhood phenomenon, and customer-oriented. They are looking for performers too. When I was there, as the folksinger was finishing, an electric cellist was arriving. D-48 is the kitchen, bar and the covered areas. Adjacent are some other carts that can share the covered spaces and bar. This is a great spot for a large meal, or just a friendly drink, for those without dietary restrictions or who can flex meals to the other carts. Some evenings have music.

They also have a variety of yummy salads, with and without pieces of sashimi, crab legs, oysters, and shrimp cocktail (peeled).  The hot bar includes shumai, cooked seafood, terriyaki beef, etc.  They also have a soup station where you can get udon made to order and a grill.  For dessert, they have an assortment of little yummies, ice cream (vanilla and green tea), and a crepe station made to order.  All of this for only $26 per person.  Lunch is even cheaper, however, they don't have the crab legs, shrimp, and oysters at that time.  Not bad, right?  Also, if you join their rewards club, which is free, then you get a free dinner or lunch the month of your birthday.  Nice!

It's easy to do around Central Square.  Whatever I eat tastes good, fills all the nooks & crannies, and keeps me healthily wired and hyper.  More awesome still is that you can get your bad-carb fix from cuisines all over the world!  Every regimen has to be deviated from occasionally, though.  When it's time for a cheat meal, Life Alive (LA) is THE BEST AND ONLY PLACE I go.There are some essential appearances and behaviors everybody should know about before going to LA.  If you're already aware of them, you can skip the rest of this magnum opus and be sure to not forget your customer loyalty card.1.  LA isn't Southwest Airlines.  People are not herded into cattle chutes leading to the cashiers, the take-out counter, and the smoothie bar.  So they meander around the way cows do.  But bovines are at least alert.  This is a big no-no.  If anybody walks in the door and knows immediately where to proceed, their experience is compromised.  Therefore YOU MUST BE STARING AT A SMARTPHONE OR AN iPOD AT ALL TIMES and preferably have ear buds firmly in place also.  2.  English is spoken there...well, kinda.  Fluency in Bloated Sentence English - at least at the tourist level - is strongly recommended at LA.  All the better to strike up a conversation with someone newly met (and caught with their ear buds out), not to mention eavesdrop on your neighbors at the closely placed tables.\\nWRONG:  \\"I laughed so hard!  Then he said...\\"\\nRIGHT:  \\"I know, right?  I mean, the thing is, I was, like, LITERALLY, laughing my ass off, OK, and he was like...\\"\\nBrushing up on Bloated Sentence English is, like, SO easy to do in Cambridge, so this shouldn't be cause for stress.3.  Embrace your fashion victimization.  You're in an earthy crunchy hipster place, so look the part got-dam it!  Ordinarily clean-shaven men should cultivate three days' stubble at the absolute minimum.  20/20 vision is no excuse to not be rocking a pair of thick-lens geek frame glasses.  A scarf around the neck is required for both sexes three seasons out of the year.  Boots extending to mid-calf or higher - also at all times except summer - can't be recommended enough for the ladies.  During the winter, the only way to go for coats is North Face or Canada Goose. 4.  If you sleep with your Fitbit on and travel to every triathlon and street-blocking road race in New England, ya better flaunt dat shit.  Many LA customers are all about these things.  Therefore you're invited to join the self-promotion party.  Don't even think about changing out of your sprayed-on, logo plastered, bicycling gear.  Not after you've blasted through seven red lights to get home!  Share with everyone, non-verbally, that all the Cannondale store clerks know you by name.  Wear that Tough Mudder shirt and see how many nods you catch.  IMPORTANT FOR GUYS:  Think you can't go wrong arriving at LA on your way to work out and dressed the part?  Think again.  From what I've observed the LA clientele is comprised about 60% of \\"presumably\\" straight women and 10-15% of \\"presumably\\" gay men.  More than enough eyes will be taking glances.  Those same eyes will glance back away in horror if they fall on an Under Armour symbol or a show of loyalty to a major-league sports team.  You've let slip that you're an everyday Joe Schmoe who uses the Y, Boston Sports Club, or (OMG) Planet Fitness.  Epic fail, dudes.  Keep the gym clothes neutral (preferably in bright primary colors.)  Let the gawkers THINK you patronize Vim or have a pass to the health center of one of the prestigious universities.  It could make all the difference between \\"boring\\" and scoring.   \\nOh yeah, one more thing:  A yoga mat is an LA gotta-have.  But if you're not into chanting while contorted, fear not.  You can probably paint and roll up a rectangle of foam rubber and no one will know.         P.S.  Get the Swami Bowl or Adventurer Bowl."},{"name":"Kizuki Ramen & Izakaya","address":"11830 NW Cedar Falls Dr, Ste 128","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"SUCH GOOD FOOD!

We had a nice time walking around the trendy neighborhood and then headed to the Whisky Soda partner restaurant across the street. We had great cocktails - a tamarind whisky sour and a Thai bloody Mary. We also had a really cute leaf wrap appetizer, mostly delicious, but with a bit too much kaffir lime flavor. After an hour and a half, we checked on our reservation and found that we could sit at the bar. The bartender was really cool and it was fun to chat with him and watch him make drinks. We ordered the pokpok salad and the vermicelli with mango. I like that the vermicelli had small cubes of mango, which were easily incorporated into the noodles. I didn't like the heavy nature of the coconut cream, which overwhelmed the Thai flavors. The dish didn't feel unqiue, but felt more like \\"cheating\\" with the use of a really rich ingredient.That said, after two bites of pokpok salad, I was trying to gulp that cream. I appreciate that spice is an element of flavor, and wish I had more than my medium spice tolerance; but I have also enjoyed pushing my spice tolerance at other Thai places (chili lime salads at Duangrat's are amazing, if you ever find yourself in VA). This was beyond reason. I didn't taste anything the rest of the meal, especially not any of the subtle Thai flavors that were masked by the coconut cream. I later heard from a friend that the Pokpok salad can be ordered at different levels of spiciness; if so, then the bartender forgot that part. Neither of our dishes were very good and I agree with the other recent reviews - this restaurant is over-hyped."},{"name":"Caf√© Luna","address":"612 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Their food used to be delicious and their waiters used to be friendly and courteous.

Another reviewer posted a picture, thanks!  I hadn't reviewed Yelp before I went over there on my lunch break, so didn't know this item was fried.  I don't generally like fried food, but this was so lightly breaded that I can't complain.  It was delicious - curry ketchup and spicy mustard, with Jaeger sauce on top is a perfect combination.  The sides were regular kraut and sweet kraut, the latter being made from beets, I think.  Both were delicious.  I had a side of potatoes (not the German potato salad which they had run out of) and I'm tempted to say the potatoes were my favorite thing.  Something about their texture or maybe the type of potato used, along with the simple cooking, made them absolutely delicious.

This was not on the menu, but they were nice enough to make one since I'm not a fan of seafood (they offer a kimchi pancake and seafood pancake). The zucchini pancake could have been cooked just a little longer to crisp it up, but had good flavor! The beef bulgogi was very good. Sometimes the bulgogi can be too sweet, but not here. Nice portion size, too. The jap chae was also well done. There was a tiny hint of spice, but not bad at all. We also tried the dduk mandu guk. Probably best part of the meal! Broth was very well done--good beef bone flavor! And the dumplings were not too soft and mushy--just right!!

They use local ingredients. For our meal we tried the entire menu except for the rainbow salad. Let's start off with the best which to me was the pork belly with French toast which was a play on chicken and waffles. This was by far my favorite. Roscoe's cannot compare. I'd eat this every day forth e rest of my life if I could. I also really enjoyed their version of poutine with duck confit and a Tunisian dish called shatshuka which was essentially a vegetarian dip with a runny sunny side up egg and pita. Their oyster po boy had just the right amount of batter and the brioche was crisped perfectly. Overall, a highly enjoyable meal. The only disappointment was the deconstructed pot pie. The cinnamoney muffin crust did not work for us as it made it more of a dessert than a savory dish. Unlike the pork belly this time it did not work.

Reasons why:\\nWe went for breakfast taco's in early January. They are ok. Yeah, just ok. They're good, pretty large and all that, but they don't blow my balls apart. Their strength is definitely in their \\"specialty\\" or lunch/dinner tacos (much like Taco Deli if you ask me, I also believe their breakfast tacos to be fairly mediocre). I mean, if Torchy's is closer to your house than another joint, then still go, but there are better breakfast tacos to be had in this town... (oh, and the coffee was pretty horrible)The boy and I headed over for a late afternoon snack (we hadn't hardly eaten all day and dinner was still a good 3+ hours away) so we decided we'd show some restraint and just order one. While two will leave you stuffed, one will typically satisfy a hunger urge. So I ordered one of my favs, the Mr. Pink, and I was really disappointed. For a place that typically serves up \\"larger\\" portions, I received the tiniest taco. For $4+ I really expected to be satisfied, but instead I was left pretty hungry still and snatching up anything unlucky enough to fall out the boy's.Lastly, the last 3 or so times we have been the Dr. Pepper has been out. I let the staff know and they always eventually (before we leave) change it, but it is getting annoying. I mean, the cane sugar rootbeer is good and all, but sometimes you just want that Imperial DP.

Not long after I came back to the US, I was invited to a dinner here and was delighted to hear and taste the familiar. Things to make sure you try:\\n1) Meze, which are the near-East/Mediterranean version of tapas. Expect lots of lemony overtones, eggplant, garlic, chickpea, the good stuff. This can easily be your whole dinner if you like; I've done this many times and it's always delicious and a welcome alternative to just one entree.\\n2) You have not properly been to Baraka until you try their Cherbat, which is an Algerian drink.  Rose water and orange water are what give Middle Eastern cooking its flair, and this is -- basically -- very sweet rose water-infused lemonade.  Some folks I've been here with have had to water it down a tad it was just too sweet for them.  I like it as-is, and it's amazing. Do not miss out on this.There is a difference between Moroccan food and more \\"general\\" North African fare, so despite the Yelp listing this is more specifically food from Algeria and Tunisia, not so much Morocco.

Did a search, thought the name sounded alright (it's erev shabbat!) So in I went.  There was a largish party so I expected a wait.  The server was polite but not super attentive.  I placed my order, a Lamb shawarma, and waited.  And waited.  Then got their \\"appetizer\\" plate which consisted of two types of cabbage salad, some potato salad, and what can only be described as indian-spiced salsa.  Honestly, whatever that red stuff is was definitely the star of the show.  After eating some salad with the lukewarm rubbery pita they served with it, a plate I chicken was put before me and the server vanished.

Maybe I came in with my expectations too high, but I definitely left feeling somewhat disappointed.First and foremost, they close at 2:30 (then reopen at 5 or 6 for dinner), and when they say they close, they MEAN it. They will literally kick you out, and they stop bringing out food after 2 anyway.The food selection is pretty good, they just leave very small servings out, and I wasn't used to that at a buffet. Some sushi were surprisingly good. I like the Unagi and Volcano Rolls. The maki rolls were a toss-up. Some good, some I can live without. As for the Japanese/cooked items, meat (mostly chicken, really) was a little dry. Fried rice was a little odd, but maybe it's Japanese-styled and I wasn't used to it? Whatever it was, I'm not used to having sushi-rice as fried rice (they have different texture and produce different tastes). Desserts were also decent, not spectacular. Green tea ice-cream is rather bland, like they used powdered green tea. Blech.Service was okay, until the hostess came over to remind us, for the 3rd time, that they close at 2:30. Waitress was also okay, except she didn't bother refilling our drinks until right before she brought us the checks. It seemed like they were more worried about getting us out of there than providing good service.

The food. We started with salted cod croquettes, which were tasteless and extremely dry - the tomato sauce that came with it couldn't save them. Then moved onto clams that were decent but broth overly salty. Lastly, we had the lobster roe noodles and similar to a few other people on yelp, I just didn't get the dish. The short ribs confuse the dish and mesh with the mushrooms to form a brownish substance underneath the pasta. Further more the cheese doesn't play nice with all the ingredients either and it just becomes a heavy pasta dish where I was hoping for something subtle with lots of umami.

For the entree we had their scallops on couscous (4-5 scallops on a bed of couscous $26), tasty I liked  them. Not very filling though.  I also tried the lamb lollipops ($38 for 4-5 small bites), which were pretty great!  Dessert: TX Whiskey Buttermilk Pie $8 Warm, Yummy! Very tastefully decorated and the apricot preserves on top are a nice touch.  I figured buttermilk would mean creamy in some way, but it tasted more like a bread pudding.

The buffet includes warm queso, salsa, warm corn tortilla chips, and taco meat -- everything you need to build your own giant plate of nachos! You can easily make a full meal out of the Nacho Car buffet. Note that you do NOT have to sit in the bar section to partake in Happy Hour, and the entire restaurant is kid friendly. This IS Orlando, after all!The atmosphere is festive and fun with a hipster vibe (Elvis artwork and eclectic tile decor with vintage looking 1950s diner style tables). Everybody gets complimentary chips and salsa too. We asked for the hottest salsa they had and even I could eat it without breaking one little bead of sweat. This is East Coast Mexican food no doubt. That means lots of cheese and bland flavors.I've had many different entrees over the years and I still think the more simple dishes are the best, like the quesadillas (they have homemade flour tortillas and you can't really go wrong with those). Most of the house specialties are letdowns, including the delicious-sounding Chuychanga and stacked enchiladas. It's not that the food is bad, it's just forgettable.

The smoothies are very filling - almost enough for a meal on their own.Life Alive is definitely projecting a hippie kind of vibe.

My review is low given that I tend to focus on food--rather than ambience or staff when writing a restaurant review. The dish I ordered (Mrs. Bennett's Casserole-$25) was bland, over-cooked, and much more like a bisque than a casserole (swimming in sauce-which appeared to be a red, cream sauce)--not to mention topped with what appeared to be crumbled saltines like those found at a hospital cafeteria. The cost-to-quality ratio was lacking given that the dish was not well-executed with the shellfish, obviously the central ingredient to be showcased, being rubbery (a shame, really, given that the scallops were quite large and certainly could have been delicious if not shamelessly boiled). That said they make a lovely biscuit drizzled in honey that is not to be missed. My husband had a pasta dish that he enjoyed enough. Also, our shrimp and oysters from the raw bar were fine (although nothing outstanding). The wine list was  quite nice, however. I can imagine this being a nice place to meet for drinks after work. The staff were very attentive and friendly--that was a plus. Given our proximity in Boston to numerous seafood venues, this would not be my first choice for a seafood meal.

Upon opening a new location on Northside Dr. (conveniently right behind my job) I took it upon myself to purchase some of their notoriously yummy food.  My first attempt at placing an order here took place on a Saturday evening.  They were not terribly busy, and the parking lot looked nice and clean.  I placed my large order for myself and some hungry friends at home.  I remember thinking how clear the freshly installed speaker box sounded.  Upon arriving home I was missing an entire order of nuggets, straws, the sauces I had asked for, and one of the drink orders was incorrect.  For the record, the order was paid in full including the missing items.  I called the store and spent about 20 minutes on hold and weeding through the younger management.  Once I finally spoke to the manager, I was offered a free meal at my next visit. I ended up splitting the food I had purchased so that everyone would have something to eat.  Being a giver of second chances, I have returned to this Chic-Fil-A twice since the first occurrence.

I use to own an Italian restaurant and thought I had the best meatballs, but no these are amazing.  I worried I would not have enough food, but I had so much left over.  We also ordered Scallops and Bacon, Shrine Cocktail and Brushetta for appetizers, they where perfect.  Gennaros made my life so much easier.  My husband and my son picked up the food at around 2:30.  He said he couldn't believe the amount of people picking up food just like us for a party.  He said it ran so smooth and quick.  The owner was in charge and he was just moving so quick.  My husband said the owner never lost his cool and was very nice to his employees that where running around getting the food.  Wih the food there was directions on how long to heat stuff up and also a ton of extra sauce. I had a Chicken, Broc, and Ziti pan and they gave me two large containers of sauce to add to the dish while I was heating it.\\nI will definitely use them for all my catering needs.\\nI never leave messages on yelp, but I thought that this Restaurant deserved one."},{"name":"Life Alive","address":"765 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"I was really blown away by the quality of the food here.I came in a group of six, most of whom are carnivores ...

The first time was flawless, so I decided to come back for my 30th birthday.We walked in and was not greeted the way you should be when you walk in.  The hostesses were very rude and not helpful.  I was told to go wait in the bar and they would call me when my table was ready.  I found that funny as we were 15 mins early and there were tables available all over.  I am not sure how they were going to call me as they didnt even really take my name or give me a pager.We sat down at the bar and ordered our drinks.  I ordered a Caipirinha, which is a traditional brazilian and spanish drink.  It is supposed to be mint, sugar, and cachaca rum.  I was not pleased as it was very sweet, and tasted like it was just sour mix.  Becoming irritated, I asked for the manager.  I work as a chef so I understand how things should operate.  The manager was very attentive and immediately grabbed the general manager for me as well.After the general manager was involved we were immediately seated and taken care of.  Our server was on point and was the best part of the evening.  I ordered the lamb shank and red snapper.  The two things I ordered last time.  This time, the snapper was over cooked, and the lamb shank was dry even though it was sitting in a pool of Rioja red wine sauce and vegetables.  I didnt complain as everyone else was enjoying the evening so I didnt want to make it any worse.I was brought some sort of 3 chocolate/layered mousse that was the highlight of the evening aside from the SangriaI would have to say that I wont be returning to Ceviche unless things change there majorly!"},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great outdoor seating area with Excellent service.

When the food came, it was disappointing. The salad I usually get was not what it was before by any means. The salmon was dry, with little sauce and not flavourful, served with average steamed veggies. Food mixups, forgotten items, dirty dishes sat in front of me for 20 minutes before being cleared and a billing mistake. For 2 of us it was $120, and this did not include a bottle of wine or excessive alcohol. I don't mind spending something like that, when the food is great.

We had high hopes for this place.  However, the restaurant changed the menu for the dine out special, even though it is still printed on the menu they handed to us.  So, instead of offering steak frites, they substituted beef bourgeon and instead of a vegetarian and meat pasta option, they substituted a \\"special\\" vegetarian pasta.  I decided to try the special vegetarian pasta, which had had a very bland pesto sauce and fava beans.  It was quite a disappointment.  My husband decided to order from the regular menu and found a pork pasta, which definitely had more flavor than my fava bean pasta.  There was a mix up with the dessert; we requested the flourless chocolate cake, but the waitress brought the butterscotch pot de creme instead, which was the best part of the meal.  Once they realized their error, they also brought the flourless chocolate cake, which was unimpressive.The service was not great, although they had been open for only three weeks, so we could excuse them for that.

The hostess then asks me if I want to share the table with someone.... Ughhh No... I told her we can keep waiting if she needed that table for another party. She couldn't decide if we should wait and asked me if I wanted the table. I said I do, but its your business you decide of we can have this table. ... Yes we were seated there.. There was only 2 extra seats.. Who were they planning on seating with us.. A couple trying to have dinner? Got a Margarita.. It was fine.. I asked for no salt but got it anyways, It was strong (like I like it). Green salsa had a weird after taste. I saw someone else had loved it.. This leads me to believe my batch might have turned a little.  You have to ask for straws, we never got the tortillas that go with our meal and our food tasted wrong. My daughter said her cheese enchilada was greasy and my rice was white rice. I guess someone forgot to put spices on mine. The food was suspiciously quick for such a packed place. Waitress was obviously stressed, and the bus boy got mad at me when I was standing by the table the hostess brought me to. It has occurred to me that their could be some bugs in the system because of it being new, that's why I generously gave them 2 stars instead of 1.

Typical stuff, had a few model planes, always had airplanes as my desktop wallpaper....but over time I lost interest in them. \\nSo on a cold November night, when all I needed was something hot and spicy, I suddenly decided it was time for buffalo wings. Cruising through Somerville, I saw Wing Works and pulled into the parking lot. and Lys W hurriedly stopped talking on the phone and told me to drive to Wings over Somerville. I remembered Russ's review about the perfect boneless wings, and hoped that Wing Works was not the place that carried it. \\nSo I drove through the ever worked upon Somerville Av, parked and walked into the place and look at the menu.

I agreed.\\nAs I sat there waiting to devour the chicken, I started looking at the pictures of the fighter planes on the walls. Then I looked at the menu in detail. Then it struck me, \\"Darn it, I know the names that they have on the menu\\". Everything is related, the name of the place \\"Wings OVER Somerville\\" (ha, nicely done), the names in the menu....truly a nice theme to the whole place. After some time I went to the car to share my brilliance (not really, I went because I the guy at the counter told it will be about 10-15 minutes). But surprisingly, the wings were ready within 10 minutes and it was really nice of the guy to come out and hand the wings to me. \\nAt this point sitting in the car, I can smell that raw smoked chilli that makes you sneeze.

My mom had the Ahi  entree, and my fad had the 10 oz Filet with the au poivre (peppercorn sauce).  They both said that they were perfectly cooked and all around great.The service lived up to expectations as well.  Last point is that the wine list was a great realistic wine list.  Many high end steak houses have volumes of wines from $100+ - $1k and higher with very few sub $100 options.  While that's great for marketing and it's good to present those options, most folks (at least folks like me) aren't likely to buy over $100/bottle.

The dark chic feeling of the converted industrial space was spot on. Appetizer : After reading a good amount about the lobster fritter I knew that I would be ordering this before getting there. It may have been the biggest disappointment of the night. It really just came off as a bland fried bar food dish. It made me think I was suddenly dining at a Taco Mac.Entree : NY Strip Steak - The prep & cooking was great. Very good taste. But really, nothing extremely special by any means. I could have gotten just as good of a steak from a Longhorn Steakhouse restaurant - and that would not have been $40. It was just a well prepped steak, no surprises. Side : Cream spinach - Again, nothing special at all. It might as well have been a frozen dish which was microwaved and put into a bowl. The service was mediocre. When we sat down we were given bread. And then when we were about to eat it we realized we had no napkins, only utensils. So that took a couple minutes to resolve. Later, we were brought another table's dishes. After that we were approached by a host who asked how everything was and then left as we were answering him.

Party was planned last minute (less than 36 hours notice week before SXSW) for about 25 people and I couldn't have been more impressed with how accommodating and responsive the team at Weather Up was to these requests.  The staff allowed us to kind of customize the back patio area by rearranging some of their adorable furniture for more of a lounge feel to which we added balloons and flowers.  The head chef called me personally and for less than $100 (including 20% tip) provided full table of delicious snacks for our group!  So many high quality small bites including a beautiful meat and cheese plate, olives, homemade chips and dip, huge pitchers of icey water and cups, it was really just so well done.  We also brought a cake for which they provided small plates and forks and did not charge additional cutting fee.  All this on top of the bar serving dope craft cocktails to my friends without the hassle of a group tab in their charming outside setting, it just doesn't get better.

But it's exactly what thai food should be. No star system, certain food has their own level of heat, and not all thai food have to be spicy.The first time I was here was over a year ago, after every single thai person told me that this is the best thai food you can possibly find in US. I wasn't disappointed when I tried Khao Soi, grilled pork collar, Som Tum, and grilled chicken for lunch. Since then, I have alway wanted to go back to try so many things in their dinner menu, which you can't find anywhere in any Thai restaurants in US that I know of.I finally got to go back last Sunday for a lunch, and they have now combined both lunch and dinner menu into one. I did a little happy dance inside my head while waiting for a table because now I got to try those that I didn't get to last time.We ordered Grilled pork collars, and Khao Soi again, and had Kaeng Hang Leh in addition this time.The grilled pork collars was great as it was, but you have to admit that the portion is rather small (aka the real that portion but American price).Kaeng Hang Leh, which is a northern Thai style pork stew curry was really good and pretty close to what I always have had when i was in Thailand. It's a great comfort food dish that's perfect for a cold and cloudy day. I am beating myself as I'm writing that I didn't order it togo when we left.Khao Soi was rather disappointing this time. The first time we had this dish, it was awesome. The chicken was perfectly cooked that the bone fall off nicely but the meat wasn't too soft or flaky. Khao Soi is essentially an egg noodle soup curry in northern Thai style, so the broth is a little thicker than normal noodle soup, but not as thick as a pure Thai curry dish like Green curry. This time the curry soup in Khao Soi is nothing but sweet and creamy, in another word, it's not thing like Khao Soi but the looks of it. It taste really Americanized-Thai, which I never expected from this place.I would still definitely go back here again when I have have a chance, but just only for Kaeng Hang Leh because that's the only thing that I think really worth it."},{"name":"Kiku Japanese Steakhouse","address":"3630 Marketplace Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"terrible service, charges gratuity before seated wish i could get my $53 back!!!! sadness"},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This is a really good restaurant, I've had the catfish at dinner, and it was fantastic.

I told Beck that we go to Top Deacon and she was so confused...)We arrived at around 11:30 and there was quite a few parties waiting already.  I had worked up my appetite and anticipate good food soo much that my stomach was growling before we even got there.  We asked for the menu while waiting so that when we are seated, we can order immediately!  We waited for around 20 min as there were 5 parties before us.  That 20 min sure seems forever when you wait on an empty stomach....My bf decided on the small Carolina Pancake (pull-pork with pancakes), Beck got the Sausage/chorizo hash.  Me...it took a long time to decide!  I wanted biscuit and gravy for sure but to get that with chicken fried steak or with sausage or with fried chicken?  They all sound so fabulous right?  How can you decide!  In the end, friend chicken won.  I felt like a Southern Belle eating the typical southern food?Service was typical.  We got our water, utensils, and waitor came to take our orders.  Staff was friendly and our water was filled once.  No major complains or compliments.NOW FOOD!  Carolina Pancake...the pancakes were big and yet fluffy!  I say they are comparable to Jethro's!  The pull-pork was tender and sweet and went well with pancake.  Good thing the boy got a small...he just finished the plate!  Can't imagine what is the portion like with the Big Carolina!  Beck's sausage hash was my favourite dish amongst the 3!  The chorizo so tasty and not overly spicy.  The hash....OH THE HASH...SO CRISPY AND WELL SEASONED.  The whole dish was just delicious!  Also it came with 2 eggs and Beck like it sunny side up.  She poked thro the egg yolk and let it ran all over the dish.  That is the only reason that stopped me from asking her for more.  I prefer the egg yolk doesn't contaminate my food.  To the boy's surprise, Beck finished the big plate.  It is quite impressive for a tiny girl to polish all the entire plate of greasy goodness.My dish of fried chicken with biscuit...Hit and miss.  To my major disappointment, the biscuit did not live up to my anticipation and some of the reviews.  They were so dense and thick.  It wasn't really enjoyable even with some of the delicious white gravy. I had a quarter to half of the biscuit and then I stopped eating that altogether.  To my surprise though, the friend chicken totally made up for it!  Behind the light and crispy exterior, the meat was moist and juicy.  With some of the gravy, it was a joyous moment in my mouth.

The Camp Creek Marketplace, or just the road in general, can be pretty busy, especially on a weekend, so I was banking on there being lots of traffic and maybe longer waits once we entered the restaurant ( I read reviews stating to anticipate that as well ). However, once we got in, we were greeted and immediately taken to our seats. We chose to sit at the bar where my friend happened to befriend one of the sushi makers on previous visits named Arsa. \\n    From what I could tell going in, to the left there were your standard tables where guests could sit around and watch the cook prepare their meals, and to the right was a smaller area with smaller tables for people who didn't want the full on hibachi experience. There wasn't a big waiting area, as I saw some guests sitting at tables waiting to be seated for the hibachi table area. \\n    I'm not the biggest sushi eater in the world and until that point I had only tried the California Roll sushi at a different spot, so I was eager to try something new. I ended up ordering a California roll and the Philly roll, while my friend ordered the New Orleans roll and the Rockstar roll. We also got one order of the shrimp fried rice and I'm glad only one of us ordered it because of the portion size. It was like someone made a big pot of rice and dumped it onto a plate, so if you decide to order the rice, make sure you only get one order to share. Unless you're someone who likes a lot of rice. \\n   The food was good, and I plan on ordering the New Orleans and Philly rolls next time. The food was made in a timely fashioned, and Arsa provided great conversation while we ate. Our meals were reasonably priced and you get a lot of food for the amount that you pay. However, the shrimp fried rice was $9.95.... But it was good, though. The most expensive rice I've ever had. Also, just to let you know, this establishment already includes 15% gratuity, no matter how large or small your party, which I was surprised by. \\n   All in all, my experience at Kiku was good. If you don't want to drive to other hibachi restaurants like Benihana, give Kiku a try."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Awesome in every way...worth the wait!

The waitperson came by shortly thereafter and I ordered a draft beer, which took a little longer to arrive than expected but was welcoming and ice cold when it arrived, served with spicy roasted peanuts. I ordered the chicken sate (or whatever it was called here - it was broiled chicken skewers with peanut sauce at any rate) with a side of steamed jasmine rice. It was served with a cucumber/green pepper/onion salad so infused with jalapeno that I literally couldn't eat it for the heat. I have no quibble with the meal, as it was perfectly tasty for what it was, but the price for a lunch-sized entree that seemed more like an appetizer, plus a pint of beer, came to over $20.00 before tip! Not what I would call an affordable lunch option! While getting up to leave, I turned around and noticed a blackboard above the tables behind me advertising the daily specials. Y'know, some of them looked pretty good. Don't you think it would have been nice if my server had pointed them out to me before I ordered? Yeah, I think so too. Overall, I'd be OK with trying this place again with a large group so we could share entrees and thoughts about them, since I suspect that's the real intention here. And it is a very cool set-up with the tents and the open air and the metal roof. But, as a single diner, I would have been far better off for lunch at a family owned strip mall Thai or Indian restaurant, where I would have been served pretty much the same thing for easily half the price.

My friend recommended this place to me, and of course I had to make a visit. Yes, there was a wait. Yes, the dishes are not your usual pad thai or drunken noodles. But YES, this Thai food is the best you will ever have.Two of us got there, and the wait was about 20-30 minutes. Not bad at all. It only bothered me because I was so anxious to get this food in my belly...! The restaurant has lots of seating, some of it outdoors. It makes you feel like you're in a tropical country with its wooden structure. The menu will cause your eyes to dizzy with delight - there are so many tasty-sounding entrees and drinks to choose from. It's crazy! Plus, many of them can be made vegetarian which I think is super nice. Anyway, we received some spiced peanuts for the table to start. They were addictive. Then we ordered the chicken wings, a salad, ice cream sandwich, and a few drinks. The chicken wings were the best I have ever had. They were salty, sweet, tangy, spicy, and just AMAZING. I could put that marinade on anything. Just writing this review is making me crave them. No other chicken wing will ever compare.I got a salad that was originally supposed to have pork and shrimp in it, and while I only asked for the shrimp to be removed, the pork was removed as well. Even still, the salad was super tasty and filling. It was a nice accompaniment to the chicken wings and rice. The drinks we got were really good as well. They had all of the flavors as described in the menu. I got one of the specials (sorry, I can't remember what it was), and it was fantastic. The Mango Alexander was also delicious; you could really taste the coconut cream which was so unique. We managed to have some space for dessert and ended up getting the ice cream sandwich, labeled as one found on any Thai street. The ice cream itself was really great, but the outside bread was pretty blah. We ended up eating only the ice cream; we thought the bread was overwhelming and didn't do much to elevate the dish.Our waiter was really friendly and cool. He gave us multiple ideas on what and how to order. He also gave us time when we needed it (since we were so indecisive). And, he was timely in everything throughout the meal.Bottom line: this is it, guys!

I think there was a mere 3-4 thin small to medium size rings of churros per order.  I'm glad I accidentally stumbled upon a small opening that leads to an indoor air-conditioned dining room.

Scratch that.  I absolutely love dim sum.  If you haven't ever had dim sum, then you're missing out on some amazing stuff.  First off, what is dim sum?  Imagine if you will, Chinese food but tapas style.  Most items are steamed or fried and you don't eat it with rice.  Dim sum literally means touching the heart.  My family and I would have dim sum and drink tea (yum cha) on Sundays.  The dim sum lady would push her cart and I anxiously looked to see what items would be in the steamed baskets.  I've had periods of time where the areas I lived in didn't have any dim sum at all.  I was one sad girl.  Luckily, in Orlando we do have a few restaurants serve dim sum even during the week.Whenever I have family and/or friends in town, I take them to Golden Lotus.  It really isn't much to look at on the outside since it's in a shopping center between John Young Parkway and Sand Lake Road.  The interior isn't much to look at either.  There's a large fish tank facing you right when you walk in.  To the right, you'll usually see one of the servers.  The dining area is medium sized and it gets packed on the weekends.  The placemats are the disposable one with zodiac animals on them.  A bit tacky but it's still nostaglic for me.Whenever I get dim sum, I order chrysanthemum tea.  It's light, floral and quite good for you.  It does not contain any tea leaves and it's literally dried flowers.  Upon request, they'll give you rock sugar.  They have varieties of teas available as well.  When you tell the server you're going to order dim sum, they'll give you a menu for you to select items.  It's √† la carte style, similar to selecting sushi and if you have no clue what you're ordering then they also pictures.  They don't have a dim sum cart at this restaurant, which I'm fine with because I know what I want.  As far as pricing goes, it's relatively inexpensive and good quality as compared to some other establishments in Orlando. \\nThe food is brought out when it's done rather than all at once.  Although sometimes everything seems to just come out all at once.  One of my favorite dim sum items is the shrimp rice paste.  As a warning, for those who do not have good chopsticks skills, they will certainly have difficulty eating this.  It's like steamed sheets of a \\"dough\\" that have various fillings in the middle (in this case, shrimp), which is then folded and served with a sweet soy sauce.  It will be slippery.  Next up was the fried taro dumpling, it does look strange.  Some fried brown hairy mass.  I assure you, it's delicious.  Inside it has taro and ground meat.  Taro is a root vegetable used in a lot of cuisines and the light purple hue is natural.  I always enjoy this with a little soy sauce and Chinese hot oil. I then had har gow, stuffed bean curd skin, chicken feet.  Har gow is shrimp dumplings, warm and succulent, you can never go wrong with these.  The stuff bean curd skin sounds odd but it also it filled with yummy goodness.  Inside the bean curd skin, there is meat and vegetables steamed in a light brown sauce.  Perfect with my hot oil which is roasted red chili pepper flakes.  Last but not least, there is the chicken feet.  I'm actually picky about my chicken feet.  It's not that I eat them all the time but when I do, they better be good!  If it isn't done right, it just tasty...fatty.  The chicken feet is here good, tasty and silky texture.  I know it sounds pretty gross still, but this is a great place to try them.  Dim sum is served from 11 am to 4 pm and Golden Lotus has a regular menu with lunch specials as well.

The daily specials ring in at $2.25 and are WELL worth the extra 75 cents. Highly recommended are the Capicola ham and mushroom or the swiss cheese and black forest ham.The only thing to watch out for with 2001 Flavours is to make sure that you get the fresh slices, as it seems that they use no preservatives in their crust. Evidenced by the fact that if the slice sits around too long the crust gets too hard to be rated highly. Having said that, as a regular visitor who has eaten 100's of slices here, I have only had this experience twice. Both of which occurred between 2:30pm and 3:30pm when i reached for my favorite, rather than the freshest. If you visit during lunch or dinner hours, you will never have to worry.2001 Flavours is one of the only, if not the only, cheap slice place in town to use real cheese (rather than vegetable oil based \\"cheese\\" as has become the industry standard for cheap slices) and uses fresh and delicious ingredients on every slice.

A friend of mine raves about this place. So we headed out one day because we had some time and wanted to try it.Turns out half of the great creations weren't even listed on the menu.  It didn't see the bao buns.  no mention of sushi fries as well as some other things.  I did see the sushi  donut but for $20 and not much description I just couldn't quite take the leap. I really wish there would have been a specials menu that covered all of these items that they talked about on their social media. It would be easy to do. Instead we got a regular menu and then a signature rolls menu and I had no prices. By this point I didn't even want to ask either.  It's an easy thing to fix I'm hoping that with this review that is what they will do. Show me those items that you market tell me how much they are and let me order them. Don't make me ask. I don't want to ask if you have 8 different things and then the prices for each of them so we can make a decision. That's no fun at all.  Instead we did get sushi nachos and while they were good they weren't even the chips that were described but they were better. We got a few more of the regular rolls and they were good, just nothing different.

We waited a few minutes and luckily, a table opened up.  I got the Green Goddess Bowl and a shot of wheatgrass and my husband got the Green Goddess wrap.  I enjoyed my food although it could have used a little more sauce.  The shot of wheatgrass tasted like a freshly mowed lawn, which is what I was expecting.  Somehow there's a pound's worth of veggies in one shot which concerns and scares me, but whatever.  It was worth it.Overall, I enjoyed my meal and it was definitely pure health food.

Yet, I am proud to say, it most certainly got the best gas mileage of any of the over sized very expensive cars parked there.Kevin Rathbun's Steak is located (and certainly boasted about) next to what will someday be the famous Beltline. The old warehouse was once used as a cotton warehouse in the 1890's - like so many of the buildings in this area of Inman Park. The original wood inside the building burned in the early 1900's and was rebuilt with steel beams in the 1940's. The warehouse then housed one of the largest Clorox Company's production centers. The space now has been redesigned by The Johnson Studio - the group who also did Kevin's Krog Bar and Rathbun's. I speak a lot of this building because quite frankly it is impressive as hell. The inside is dark - with massive pieces of thick wood across the walls and just enough light to see your menu. (Although a few people had little flash lights.) The large painting of Kevin himself is a bit egregious, but I guess it is Kevin Rathbun - Iron Chef America winner...We started the night with a bottle of champagne and ended the night with two glasses of red wine. Now, I will tell you, their wine list is one of the most expansive I have seen, but it ain't cheap. Don't expect to get a \\"house red\\" for $7.00. We got the amazing \\"Ahi Tuna Poke\\" appetizer which was superb, and I have not eaten red meat in a while, but opted for the smoked beef ribs for dinner- which were certainly the best beef ribs I have put in my mouth. Alison got a 6 ounce Fillet Mignon and it was incredible - like butta. But, I expected nothing less than the best beef (corn fed by the way) you could ask for. The side selections looked fabulous and we chose the night's twice baked potato that was mixed with parsley, horseradish and some cheese I can't remember- but it was grand.Our glasses of water were never more than an inch lower than completely full. In fact, I had to tell the server I was going to waste it if he filled it up again. Our waitress was always attentive and explained in detail the different kinds of beef and how aged they were. For true steak eaters, I am sure this means something serious -\\"dry aged.\\" The wait staff did have to wear unattractive yellow button down collared shirts. Such a bummer, but you always knew where they were because you can obviously still see yellow in the dark!Basically, this place is run like a well oiled machine.

There's really no inlking of any Hawaiian influence in any of menu offerings. Nonetheless, if you live in the area and have a hankering for standard Americanized Chinese or Japanese fare, then Aloha Asian Bistro will certainly fit the bill.Food: As one would expect, the menu is organized by major meat component and each entree is ordered by a unique letter and number combination. Menu offerings include appetizers, soups, salads, vegetarian and seafood sushi, fried rice, noodles, and various poultry, pork, beef, and seafood entrees. It also features a section dubbed \\"spa cuisine\\", which apparently is a euphemism for steamed vegetables. In typical form, I ordered the sesame chicken on my first visit so that it could be readily compared to other nearby restaurants of the same caliber. Overall, I found the dish to be perfectly edible, but not overtly memorable. It's definitely superior to nearby Mandarin Palace II, but slightly inferior to Chin Chin II.  Service: Incredibly efficient, to the point that nothing could even remotely be construed as made to order. We placed a take-out order for two and were advised that we could pick it up in 15 minutes. We arrived for the order after approximately 10 minutes, at which time it was already boxed, complete with rice, utensils, fortune cookies, and an arsenal of unidentifiable sauces. Atmosphere: The vast majority of their business is take-out, so there hasn't been much investment in the actual dining area. However, the restaurant itself is still perfectly suitable for a casual dine-in experience.Cost: Inexpensive. Appetizers cost $3-$9, soups and salads are $2-$6, entrees are $9-$13, and sushi and sashimi is generally between $5 and $10 per roll. Other: There are a limited number of spots available in the lot directly in front of Aloha; however, if you have any semblance of a brain, you should not park directly on Piedmont in front of the restaurant. These are not legal parking spots and the restaurant is located on the bottom of a blind incline, so wayward parkers are typically met with either a ticket or the trunk of their vehicle in their back seat.

When mah boo told me to check this place out, I was wary because of the name (what the heck is a kolache??).  But I try to be more open with food when I'm with him, so we came here for breakfast.  It closes at 2pm so watch out!  Luckily we got here at 1:45pm, and the guy was super friendly.  Mah boo mentioned that I came all the way from CA just to try their stuff (even though he knows it was really for him), and so the guy told us about their most popular kolaches.  I had the bacon, egg and cheese, mah boo had the sausage, jalapeno and cheese, and the texas hot (a similar yet bigger mix).  First of all, I used to love eating the horrible-for-you starbucks sausage, egg, and cheese sandwiches, but made myself stop because that crap is bad for your health.  But these are just like that, yet better.  They're in white or wheat rolls, they're clean, and heck, they're pretty cute.  It'd be nice to bring them to conferences or field trips for kids btw.  The prices were decent too, and even though they're not humongous rolls or anything, the meal itself was pretty filling.

The chicken was very dry and rubbery kind of like the frozen chicken breast you find at Costco. I think we probably struck out by ordering pho as we left generally unsatisfied. I wouldn't recommend this place for pho. Try rice or dry noodles or something. Also we all felt weird after getting home from the food.

We usually go with three or four friends, and all of us rarely carry cash, so we always have to figure out who is going to pay who back, which is getting really tiring.

The chicken was nicely grilled and had a little bit of a charbroiled flavor, which is usually missing from fajitas. Best of all, the peppers and onions were cooked enough to be a little bit soft and also pick up some of that charbroil flavor. All the other times I recall fajitas, the veggies were undercooked and tasted too raw.The fajita mix is enough for two, and comes with rice and refried beans, a bit of sour cream and guacamole, plus salsa if you request it. The five tortillas were not enough, however; so either plan on buying extra tortillas or eating some of your fajita mix with a fork."},{"name":"Kevin Rathbun Steak","address":"154 Krog St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The only bad thing about Kevin Rathbun Steak is the huge creepy '80s-impressionist portrait of Chef Rathbun on the wall. You can see it in the photo at the top left of their Web site: http://www.kevinrathbunsteak.com/Aside from being vaguely disturbed about dining under the watchful eyes of Sr. Rathbun, the trip my boy and I took to Rathbun Steak for his birthday was one of the more stunning meals we've had in Atlanta. They take their meat seriously without making me feel like they wish they could post a \\"Men Only\\" sign on the door and have the waitresses go topless. We started with a glass of wine and the lightly fried okra and oysters that another reviewer mentioned. The breading was crisp and light, the okra was brilliant green and the oysters fresh, plump and succulent. Our main course was the dry aged steak for 2. It wasn't cheap by any means, but if KR is going to have the audacity to dry age filet, that's what I'm having. When in Rome. Incidentally, no one dry ages filet because it's such an expensive cut and dry aging makes it get even smaller as it loses its water. But, dry aging is the hallmark of a delicious steak: the process concentrates the flavors and intensifies the beefiness of the meat.My boy and I had a bit of a tiff over how we would have our meat prepared. Me? I wanted to go for Blue, a new designation I'd never heard before that is *even less cooked than rare* -- I imagine they just set the steak on a plate next to the stove for a few minutes and then bring it out to you. My kind of steak. He, on the other hand, was more inclined to have them actually cook the meat. We compromised on rare-medium rare. It was his birthday, after all. We also got the bleu cheese butter on the side because when you're eating enough meat to feed a small African village for a week at one sitting, what it really needs is more saturated fat. ;)We had a tough time choosing sides because they all sounded so delicious. Okay, we took the \\"Steamed Broccoli, Government Cheese Sauce\\" off the table pretty quickly, but I deeply appreciate the ballsy-ness of offering this selection as part of a meal that we were spending $300 on. We picked the jalapeno creamed corn and the scalloped sweet potatoes with gruyere.Our server was incredibly helpful and recommended a quite reasonably priced bottle of wine that was incredible. The meal was a symphony of the flavors that explode from food that is treated properly with fat, salt and love.We closed out the meal with a respectable creme brulee, an espresso and a port. I'm not sure how we managed to fit dessert into our bellies after polishing off the first and second courses. I wanted to lick the dish the sweet potatoes came in, they were so good.We left happy, $250 poorer and a little tipsy (me, not him). If you're into meat and have the cash to drop, Rathbun Steak is a must-do. A little too spendy for any old time for me, but it's perfect for a special occasion for that avid carnivore in your life."},{"name":"Slappy Cakes","address":"4246 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Service great.

After waiting for an hour and a half (which, granted, we had been told to expect), we sat to eat. Halfway through a dish, I bit down on a very hot chili pepper. Of course, peppers were an integral part of the dish, so I didn't hold it against the restaurant that I ate it; it was not their fault. However, the reaction of both the waiter and, later, the general manager, were  abysmal. While tears were streaming down my face, I asked our waiter if there were anything he could give me to lessen the pain, and he tried to sell me dessert. I left the restaurant in great discomfort and with no sympathy from the staff. Later, I called the general manager to suggest that the staff have some sort of recourse for situations like mine; perhaps they could offer a small dish of yogurt to cut the pain, or at the very least some words of encouragement. Although it is not the restaurant's fault that customers might eat peppers, in the event that it does happen by accident, it is in the restaurant's best interest to keep their customers comfortable. The manager informed me that they were not about to offer anything for free. It was not eating the pepper that turned me off about Pok Pok, but rather the cold reaction from both our waiter and the general manager. I will not go back, nor will I recommend  the restaurant to friends."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"you really can't go wrong here.

After all, in their home countries, how else are many of the people who make less than the US minimum wage standard able to afford a night out.  The foods usually are way too greasy, sweet, or salty but strangely so satisfying.  Having said this, Pok Pok is not the type of Thai place that tries to mimc royal Thai cuisine, but rather attempts to capture that satisfying feeling.But much of that satisfaction is really due to the pricing.  This is where you will see the range of reviews, many of which feel items are overpriced or dishes that are underwhelming. It is just simple economics - better ingredients cost more money, especially here in the US.  Despite this, Pok Pok does deliver on providing some homestyle Thai dishes, similar to what I experienced eating at my Thai friend's house.Kai Yang, the rotisserie game hen, is exactly what you would expect. A nicely roasted hen that is juicy.  Is it a whole lot better than the one you can get at Costco? Not by much, but the dish itself is not that spectacular.Papaya pok pok is wonderful.  For those who have never tried green papaya, it is a salty, crunchy, vinegary dish that is nothing like the papaya you would expect in your smoothie. It makes a great side or salad that really helps to prep your palate for the rest of the food to come.Ike's Vietnamese fish sauce wings is exactly as advertise -  very salty with the pungent aroma of fish sauce.  By themselves, I would not care for them much, but it is a great accompaniment to the rice.  That's right, I said accompaniment to the rice.  Many of the dishes in Asia are meant to accompany rice and not vice versa.  These main protein courses are usually too expensive for the common man to eat his fill on, so they are meant primarily to make the rice taste much better, which is cheaper and more filling.  The eggplant was as expected - garlicky, salty and mushy, in a good way.My favorite dish was the boar collar.  It is basically pork that is a bit on spicier side with overbearing garlic notes.  I liked the fact that it had some chew to it and gave a nice textural change of pace.Ironically, the most fantastic thing I had was the pandan leaf water, which is free.  The water has a wonderful mellow aroma to it like you would get from a good genmai tea.  The best comparison is to the fragrance of jasmine or basmati rice with a subtle green  bouquet.  To truly appreciate the value that Pok Pok brings, you would need to take their dishes in perspective and eschew what you normally have been accustomed to at other Thai restaurants."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"What a great experience.

They have about a dozen oyster selections sourced from different waters, including my new favorite--the shigokus, which, after some online research, are a new variety developed by Taylor Shellfish that just came out last year.  The shigokus taste a lot like kumamotos but are slightly bigger and have a deeper cup.  In fact, I liked them so much that I had them for dessert... I know, gross, right?  Haha.  At the end of night, I ate 18 oysters all by myself because they were that good!  We also tried the island creeks (solid), hama hamas (solid) and belons (a bit too mineral-tasting for me).   My only suggestion is that perhaps they should start carrying cherrystones alongside the littlenecks.

The lobster pasta was quite good too.  Though not cooked al dente, the home-made pasta was very flavorful and complimented the lobster and short ribs well.  Too bad the short ribs don't come by themselves because they were amazingly tender.  The servers deserve a notable mention as well.  They were friendly and attentive without hovering.  Even though we were almost done with our entrees, they still refilled our bread basket without us asking.  Also, the sea-salt, honey and cayenne butter was absolutely delicious.

The menu looks overwhelming at first, but the comments & suggestions are extremely helpful for navigating the menu for the first time. We went with three classics:\\n- Wings: Perfectly fried and crispy while also sticky with a perfect balance of fish sauce and sweetness.\\n- Pok Pok Special (half roasted game hen, papaya salad and sticky rice): Great flavor from the lemongrass stuffing and loved the sauces. Papaya salad was as expected - citrusy, salty and spicy.\\n- Pork belly and pork shoulder curry: Meat was incredibly tender and curry was bold without being overpowering; would've been perfect with jasmine rice.For 2 people, those 3 dishes were just the right amount. Yes, Pok Pok is popular and will likely have lines, and prices are on the high side based on our standards of Thai restaurants, but the food is great and high quality."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"I could wander here forever!

Thunderbird on Manor has windows galore. Windows like a m-fing church. Huge and frequent windows that let all the light in and showcase the meditative passing of traffic outside. Thunderbird on Manor is also cool because it's across the street from that discreet community park with the roosters, and you can park in the neighborhood, say what's up to the roosters, maybe feed them some rooster-food (they aren't discriminating), and waltz across to coffee land. Thunderbird is really annoying because literally everyone inside working on their computer is working on a Mac. Including me. It looks like we are on an Apple commercial. It's such a distinct cultural thing here that I have wondered if there is a conspiracy afoot. But I guess it's the same old conspiracies--college kids get Mac discounts, everyone wants to look rich, everyone therefore wants a Mac, everyone has internalized classism and commodity fetishism in the form of Apple elitism. Including me. Whatever. It's not just Thunderbird, it's everywhere. But enjoy that awkward moment of realizing everyone is using a Mac computer. Welcome to Thunderbird, an orchard of glowing albino apples, lovingly tended to by university students and young professionals. The coffee is amazing, also, but it's unclear to me if Thunderbird automatically includes a gratuity for tip. A cappuccino is like 4 dollars, a little much. Their food is delicious and correspondingly expensive. A saving grace is they have a punch card to buy X amount of coffees and get one free, a huge part of my personal rationalizing frequenting this place.There are some baristas who work here who pretend to be all down with the hippest newest music scene thing and then play 2 consecutive Weezer albums. Yes, WEEZER. Remember Weezer blaring from your Discman as you tried to kickflip outside the bank after hours to exorcise some of that suburban sadness? When you were 15?4 stars for the windows.

Then, as so often happens, the restaurant map around the University did its Boggle¬Æ Dance and a couple of the places I frequented shuttered their businesses. I was in the area wandering aimlessly searching for a place to trough myself, and when I couldn't come to a decision, I opted to give FF a chance.That first time I went doesn't stand out in my mind. I had some shwerma that was more akin to street food than I was accustomed, but it was good enough to draw me back. That's when I learned about the specials. The family has ties to both Jordan and Louisiana, and the matriarch/cook of the family Nuja (sp?) likes to spend equal time in the kitchen on both types of food. On Wednesdays, you can get the best fried chicken in Austin. Really. I used to spend an inordinate amount of time at Tony's Southern Comfort eating chicken drumettes, and loved that, not only was it delicious, but you could look at it and tell it was homemade. Visually, the same indicators are there for FF's version. But it one-ups Tony's in the spice department. This is clearly a Cajun-style fried chicken, with the spice deeply deposited in the meat and dredge. It comes with a side of jambalaya, some mustard tinged potato salad and sliced French bread. None of the specials are cheap (most are $9-13), but you get enough food for two. And if you really want to be sure that you can get some of the chicken, you either need to call ahead or get there early and expect a short wait; FF has a small fryer and no room at the current location to expand, so they can only do so much chicken on a given day. It's well worth the minor inconveniences, though.On Thursdays, you can get Mensaf (which I haven't seen elsewhere in town), a lamb or chicken sauce with goats milk that is ladled over a strata of rice and pita bread. It's rich enough to knock you down for a day. This is really the dish that hooked me on FF; I learned about the fried chicken later, and now alternate weeks with these two.On Tuesdays, Nuja offers up some Middle Eastern specialty. Lately she's been preparing something that she refers to as \\"Upside-down,\\" which upon completion somewhat resembles a Middle Eastern version of tympanum; the dish consists of rice, cauliflower, carrots and chicken, heavily spiced and baked in a large round before being flipped and served. I debate myself now whether this or the Mensaf is better.FF po-boys and Cajun-fried seafood get my praise, as well as gyros and some other ME standards, but if you really  want to try something new, don't miss the dishes that get their own day."},{"name":"Chick-fil-A","address":"503 W Martin Luther King Jr Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"My love for Chick Fil A is well documented across yelp.

Our table was set with bread plates, but we had to ask for the bread. Our food took forever to arrive; it was over a two hour meal even though we didn't stay for dessert, and the restaurant wasn't particularly full.Appetizers were generally good, but uninspired, and the clams were gritty.Entrees were underseasoned and underwhelming, and the prices border on the absurd. I get fancy comfort food, really I do -- I had Thomas Keller's fried chicken at Ad Hoc a few months back and it was amazing. But this fried chicken isn't amazing, and $25 for a few pieces with an unremarkable biscuit and a tiny thimble of slaw is silly. None of the $9 sides were notable -- the duck fat fries were just ordinary fries, and the mac and cheese was standard barbecue side quality.On the way out, we noticed that the \\"market\\" sells the world's smallest jars of Hellmann's mayo for $4. Not fancy gourmet mayo, but grocery-store-standard Hellmann's.

My latte was made to order by an authentic barista (as opposed to someone operating a push button machine).  My latte was absolutely perfect.

I hate the scary mixed egg from a carton or worse pre-cooked eggs that are warmed up again for my sandwich.  At Boston Common Coffee they made my egg right there on the grille and put it on my bagel.  Wow!  Not many places do this anymore.  They also offer sausage, bacon and ham on the egg and cheese.  As well, breakfast sandwiches are available on toast or croissants in place of bagels.  In addition to breakfast sandwiches, Boston Common Coffee Co. offers bakery items like muffin tops, scones and croissants.  The selection would appeal to a wide variety of people.\\n I was so enchanted with my breakfast experience that I decided to return later for lunch.  Boston Common Coffee Co. offers a range of yummy paninis, wraps and salads.  Sandwiches come with a side of your choice of mixed greens, three bean salad or tortellini salad.

Pho Basil accommodated our busy schedule and managed to fit in drinks, appetizers and a full entree into our forty minutes of dining time. I got spicy crab ragoons (not really that spicy, but still good), a tai pho and a glass of Riesling to wash it down with. My pho was very tasty but I wish I had ordered what my husband did, the pho with meatballs. The beef in mine was good, but the meatballs (don't know what this specific pho is called) were out of this world. He also got steamed gyoza which were tasty but nothing special. I'm glad we made it into Pho Basil and got to try them out, would definitly reccomend it if you're in the area and want a quick sit-down dinner."},{"name":"Boston Common Coffee Co.","address":"515 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I came here yesterday to grab a quick cup of coffee with a friend.

Often times, sushi is prepared at buffets simply in the interest of cashing in on the craze, resulting in unfresh, poor tasting, and unsatisfying sushi. While I can eat mediocre pizza, salad, and casseroles from a buffet, sushi just has to be done right. And oh man, does Nori Nori do it right.I went to Nori Nori after seeing an advertisement at a play for the restaurant, claiming they were breaking the stereotype of a buffet being a place people go to simply to get alot of food. This was a bold claim, and one I had to challenge. THE VERDICT:\\nThe sushi was on par with any sushi bar I've been to, with delicious flavors both complex and simple. Rolls ranged from what you'd expect to find at a sushi bar to absolutely delicious combinations I'd never heard of prior to coming. On top of the sushi, which seemed to me to be worth the trip alone, foods from whole cooked fish(bones and all, you just tear off some of the meat with tongs) to several types of salad to a station where a chef makes you your own bowl of udon, are also offered.My only frustration with Nori Nori was not being able to try everything, the sheer variety of food they offer is flabbergasting. I left wondering what a certain roll I didn't try tasted like, or what that one salad I didn't get was garnished with. I can't wait to come back, the food was delicious, the service excellent, and my overall experience a very good one."},{"name":"Thunderbird Coffee","address":"2200 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Good, foamy, west-coast style cappuccino.

There was a culinary Fight Club cook-off. Four chefs were involved, tents were set up on the patio, and the rain did not stop the crowd nor the chefs from smoking up some great cuts of meat and throwing down on the grill. Inside while waiting for the chefs to do their thing, we witnessed a table full of many ingredients for the chefs to choose from. The chefaree announced that it was time for everyone to come in and take the ingredients that they needed within a minutes time. The chefs along with their sous chef scattered around the table to grab as many things as they could before they went back outside to let the grilling begin. We patiently waited inside as we took in all of the great aromas in the things that they were preparing for us to sample later. As the cooking began, we were able to sip on beers and talk amongst each other about what was to come. Once the chefs were finish each Chef brought in their own rendition of what they would Grill whether it was prime rib or a center cut steak. The judges would begin the tasting while everyone watched. Once the judges were done with their part everyone else would have a chance to gather outside under the tents to get a sample as well as a glimpse of everything that these Master Chefs created. We would then take our samples back inside taste everything and judge ourselves on who was to become the winner for the night. Chef Jarvis would take home the grand prize. Although I'm not a meat the sides that they created were absolutely amazing. There was corn relish, potato hash, and tons of macaroni and cheese to die for. Overall I would say that this competition was a great experience and the food was amazing as well my friend and I had a chance to sample some of the things on the menu of smoke ring and the food there was amazing as well a definite recommendation for all of you barbecue lovers out there."},{"name":"Thai Wok Kitchen","address":"5000 E 4th Plain Blvd, Ste A101","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"Ordered the crispy duck in garlic sauce, shrimp wok and shrimp pad thai to go.

They have every book you've ever wanted/needed and more.  I always find my way here whenever I'm in Portland because Powell's is very much a special place to me and any book lover.  The place is massive, so be prepared to take your time and plan for hours here.  No, really, hours.  The shelves are stocked and tall, so it can be a little overwhelming, but there are help desks on every floor.  In my most recent visit I was looking for used copies of books that I wanted to read, which neither were on the shelf.  So when I asked an employee at the help desk if there were any (since used and new books are sorted together on the shelves), she looked up the books in the system, and was able to see that the store had recently received used copies of both books I wanted.  She then called over for another employee to staff the help desk that she was at, so she could fetch them for me since the books weren't even out yet to be sold.  Best customer service here.  They are very much willing to help you find any book you want - new or used.  And I love that they have a system that tracks all the incoming books and can easily order anything that may not be in the store.  Take advantage of the service here! And if you don't read books (shame on you), they do have fun, small gift items, including Powell's and Portland souvenirs and a whole section for board games, or even a place to chill out, as there's a cafe.

By the time we finally did eat, the events leading up to the buffet basically put a huge damper on the meal. Especially since the equivalent of our table was the nosebleed section at a packed concert arena. The restaurant did offer us a discounted meal and (barely) admitted they made a mistake after one of my girlfriends voiced her frustration. I was really disappointed in the lack of service even given the discount.

The rice slowly crisps and the meat slowly cooks from rare to medium (so move it around if you like it raw). The sauces were probably not really all that interesting despite how much they hype it.

Couldn't quite figure out what she meant, but I think she realized she had confused me and clarified that they had the same recipe but no longer bought supplies from blenz.So i ordered a medium mochachilla and surprised it rang up to $6.10 (ok less for me as it ends up they give 10% discount to St. Paul's employees).   Ends up they only offer one size instead of the 3 that blenz offers you.She made the drink and the first observation i had was that it was much lighter in colour almost a tan colour (coffee with lots of milk).took a sip and to be honest it didn't taste like anything.  wasn't sweet enough couldn't taste much coffee.  Asked the barrista if she could add some chocolate syrup for me but the don't have any so i ended up adding some liquid syrup and some chocolate powder from the counter.  Suggested to the barrista that they need to have chocolate syrup for the drink instead of blending chocolate chips as it doesn't break down and melt into your drink, especially a cold drink!In the end my self improved drink was sufficient but not great.

The meal started off fine but fell so far downhill that as we left I told my friends I was never coming back.Strengths:\\n-SalsaWeaknesses:\\n-Food\\n-Ambience\\n-ValueSevere Weaknesses:\\n-Service\\n-FoodThe first 10-15 minutes were fine.  We ordered drinks, thoroughly enjoyed both the salsas that came with the chips and decided on our orders.  Half our party was vegetarian and they both requested vegetarian-specific menus -- I was impressed that they had specific vegetarian menus, but there would be no way to know this unless you ask.  However, I was not very impressed with the menu, at all.  It was somewhat limited and consisted of your standard american style, watered-down mexican food.  I ended up opting for as much variety as they offered, trying a combo: One Beef Enchilada and One Chicken Taco.  Both were mediocre at best; you could do almost as well at a Taco Bell drive-thru.  My vegetarian friend, finding nothing on the vegetarian menu that satisfied him, opted for the cheese quesadillas.  They came out covered in ground beef.  I grant that he did order from the generic menu, however, he specifically asked for a vegetarian menu and then ordered cheese quesadillas (nowhere in the description does it suggest that these quesadillas are covered in meat-sauce) which are, in our experience, categorically vegetarian.  I don't bemoan the restaurant's choice to serve the quesadillas with a meat-sauce -- that would be my personal preference -- but given that he had already identified himself as a vegetarian, I would have hoped our server could have figured it out...This would have been very minor had it been my only complaint, but the service continued to go downhill.  We finished our food in about 15 minutes and proceeded to wait another 30 minutes for our server to return to clear our plates and bring dessert.  At this point, I was in a rush to get back to work (we'd spent over an hour in the restaurant, much of it simply trying to spot our server, who, given the lack of customers aside from ourselves, was somewhere in the back the entire time).  Since the impetus for our visit was my friend's coupon for a brownie-sundae, we ordered his dessert and informed our server of our desire for speed.I will give them credit for the table-side preparation of this otherwise below average dish.  Our server brought out the warm brownie with a glowing sparkler (presumably as it was my friend's birthday, though the lack of other guests couldn't have hurt) stuck in it.  Then our server added the ice cream and served it with four spoons.  It was not a small dessert, obviously, but I have certainly eaten larger ones with no help from others (though I have a large stomach for ice cream and brownies).  Between the four of us (all men in our early twenties) we didn't even finish this thing it was so unappealing.  The ice cream was bland, the brownies were bland.  The only good thing was the accompanying sauce, but that wasn't enough to save it.  Given my penchant for dessert, you know it has to be bad when I don't finish it, much less with the help of three other men.Finally, it came time to pay.  We split the bill evenly between three of us.  It came out to something like $83.61, such that we each paid $27.87, or so we thought.  However, after running our cards, it turned out two were billed $27.86 and the other $27.89.  At this point, yes, I was looking for things to criticize and it could have been a simple computer error, but still... It was simply indicative of the larger sloppiness that characterized our whole experience.Finally, I felt that the ambience was severely lacking.  It was generic, bland and totally boring.  I was not impressed, though this is the most minor of my complaints."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"A trip to Portland would not be complete without multiple visits to this Independent Bookstore Mothership.

The first thing we noticed is that it is very accessible via transit.  We took the SkyTrain and after a short bus ride to 2nd Ave and a short one block walk, we had arrived.  We found out shortly after our arrival that the pub has only been in operation since October 2014.  We were amazed at how large the pub was.  It is actually in a 100 year old heritage building that has been painstakingly restored.  The ceilings are 50 ft high and there are lot of tables, a large bar and there is also another sitting area upstairs.  We felt comfortable and relaxed immediately.  We noticed they have one large pull down screen for major events but at present they have only four other TV's, two large flat screens on either side of the bar. Maybe someday they could add additional TV's to make it a bit more viable as a game day destination. As for the food they have a more smallish menu but my wife had a burger and I had a pizza both of which were very good and were reasonably priced. As for beers we sampled the two different flights they had available and found a couple brews that we thought were really good! I also felt that $6.50 for a pint of micro brewed beer is very reasonable for the Vancouver area.  The service was excellent - our server Jamie was great and we had many of the other servers checking on us as well.  Katy who I believe was the assistant manager came to our table to check on us as well. She asked how our experience was seeing as it was our first time.  We offered a couple of suggestions to her and she was very receptive to our suggestions.  We thought that when you order a flight of the beers, they should be lettered or numbered, so you know exactly which beer you are drinking.  She said that we weren't the first to make this suggestion and she told us that this was a change they would be making shortly.  My wife and I really appreciated her taking the time to speak to us - way above and beyond! We spent a very relaxing Sunday afternoon here and will definitely be back!"},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"They have all of the books and it smells like heaven inside the building!!

Our waiter was incredibly friendly, attentive, and personable.Now for the food:\\n- We got an order of biscuits for the table and if you don't do this, you're doing it all wrong. Nuff said. Amazing.\\n- We also got an order of the mac and cheese with poached eggs to share and also really good. Not AS life changing as I was expecting based on a lot of reviews and photos but still really good. It could have been a little saucier.\\n- I ordered the chocolate and caramelized banana French toast and again whoaaaa so amazing. The bread was fluffy and delicious with lots of toppings and a generous portion. All the French toast varieties are offered as waffles also and I'm tempted to try it/another variety prepared on a waffle because the table next to us had them and they looked amazing also.\\n- My friend ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes with mixed berries and lemon curd and they were so moist and fluffy and refreshing. I would definitely be tempted to order that for myself when I'm in a fruity mood.\\n- My dad ordered the lobster eggs benedict and also really enjoyed his.

I love their bowls and salads. All are very balanced with greens and grains and amazing sauces and a variety of superfoods. I also appreciate the light steaming to make food warm. One thing with vegan food is it tends to be mostly cold and raw veggies, so it's a nice touch to be able to enjoy a warm vegan meal!The staff are also always great dynamic personalities!

The specialty salads are kind of bitter and acidic, but if you mix them with some of the other salad bar ingredients, they taste fine. There is no meat at all, so if you like a chef salad or anything with a little ham or turkey, no luck. The dressings are very good and everything seems quite fresh. Once you understand the limitations and adjust your expectations it's a fairly good place. The side tables offer soups, Mac and cheese and various pizza-like foccacias. Haven't tried everything, but the foccacia is nothing special. They obviously go easy on the salt and heavy on the garlic. Lots of muffins, rolls and breads. Simple desserts, but the fat-free chocolate mousse is delicious and kind of addictive. It's all about worth the price. Biggest complaint is that the place is seriously understaffed.

It has the tendency to be really chill in the morning and mid afternoon. The upstairs is lined with lots of plants and books to enjoy.

It was a little packed and it took a few minutes for someone to greet me however they more than made up for it with the service and the food. The service of the manager and staff were really great. We were given complimentary cinnamon rolls to start which was completely unexpected but very nice.My sis and I both ordered pumpkin spice chai lattes which were absolutely delicious! For food, I ordered \\"everything but the kitchen sink\\" sampler (don't judge me...I was hungry) and she ordered the lemon ricotta berry pancakes. Food was so yummy!!!!!  Her pancakes were so moist and fluffy. They also loaded her pancake stack with fresh juicy berries. Yum yum yum! The everything sampler had so much food and there was every type of breakfast meat that you could ever dream of on my plate... to top it off, it came with an egg (any way you like it), waffle, home fries and a spicy jalepeno cheese sauce. Yes I was in heaven! So I will definitely be back to Caf√© Luna!

No worries there! The selection of broth is quite large, so it will surely satisfy many tastes. My favourite is the mushroom broth. Perfect to sip on after your meal. The condiments bar is stocked full of sauces, pastes, chilis and greens. And the great thing is, it's complimentary. Not the usual 50cents for ginger and garlic deal.

We felt a little uncomfortable because of the service -- not necessarily how we were treated, but how we heard them speak to other customers. I don't think staff had bad intentions, I think they're just a little rough around the edges. We ordered the calamari, scallop linguini in red sauce, scallop linguini in white sauce & shrimp linguini in white sauce. Each of the linguini were $25 each. The portions look big, but they're pretty average. All of us were able to finish & we're not terribly huge eaters. Calamari was good. Lightly breaded and more on the soft side than crispy. I'm fine with this since it's usually meatier. Scallop linguini were good but both dishes had sand. That's really not an enjoyable experience. The shrimp in the linguini was good, but the actual sauce was bland. I'm pretty surprised the ratings are so high and there are apparently lines out the door. Weird for flavors that are so mediocre. Prices seem really high for what you're getting.Place is kind of small and dirty. We had a fly land in our bread. Also, no menu except the one on the wall!

Shout of to Rosita for probably being the neediest table ever, but was so nice and accommodated our every need! Our chip bowl was never empty nor were our drinks. She checked back in to make sure all the food was tasting great. Really awesome! Onto the food...we started with the house salsa, queso and added on a jalapeno cream salsa. First off the jalapeno cream sauce is kinda amazing. It's not even as spicy as you would think. Its cool and refreshing and I probably ate half the chip basket alone with that sauce. The chips are really thin and light so you can just keep eating them. Resist the urge though, get to your main course, you won't be disappointed! I got the ChuyChanga. Crispy outside and really nice chicken filling. It was packed with tender shredded chicken, cheese, peppers and onions and just had an overall great flavor. After eating 2 baskets of chips I probably didn't need to eat the whole thing, but it was so good! The portions for the meals are also LARGE! So come hungry or expect to take home leftovers. I was just hungry, so no left overs for me! All the others in my party also really enjoyed their meals; chicken fajitas that come with all the fixens, taco salad which is the size of your head, and a chicken enchilada smothered in a sauce of your choosing.

Our server was very attentive throughout the meal.Now on to the food. We started with Insalata Caprese, which was very good, but I'll admit, that is hard to mess up. Our entrees were even more delicious. My boyfriend got the Linguine alle vongole, which was linguine pasta with clams in a white wine and garlic sauce. And I ordered Spaghetti Mare e Monti, which was spaghetti with creamy pesto, saut√©ed shrimp, and mushroom. Favoloso!Seeing as it was my birthday, I was treated to a complimentary dessert, Tiramisu naturally. Again, perfection.

The Daily Catch is one of the popular North End destinations for tourists, but it also has a good amount of local semi-regulars ( a group which I seem to be joining). Because of its popularity and small size, there is usually a line outside. Be ready to wait somewhere between 20 min to over an hour. It's a small operation with one cook, one waiter, and one dish washer, and it is probably not super efficient, so just be ready to be a little patient. Despite the wait, I always feel rewarded once I make it inside. It's crowded, it's loud, you sit next to strangers, and yet it's kind of fun? I don't mind sitting next to other hungry diners, and have even shared dishes with them here. Prices are not too cheap, so the more dishes you share, the better. They are largely famous for their fried calamari and black squid ink pasta. The calamari is very good. The squid is very fresh, it's crispy. Simple and delicious. It comes with just some lemons, and while it doesn't really need anything else, I like getting some marinara sauce on the side to dunk it in. The black squid ink pasta Aglio e Olio is a unique and tasty take on the dish. The squid ink is in the noodles themselves and not in the sauce. The noodles are thick and have always been nicely cooked al dente. They add tons of ground squid to the olive oil and garlic sauce, which really makes their version different, making me sometimes get a craving for The Daily Catch Aglio e Olio specifically. I have been here a few times, and there is some variability to the tastiness of the dish. Two times out of three it was a hit, once it was a bit on the bland side. I have also tried a few other things on the menu. The squid meatballs were somewhat disappointing because it's a small version for the price and the taste was not anything too remarkable. The Sicilian clams were a tiny bit on the salty side, but I really enjoyed them. The broth was piping hot and perfect for dipping some bread in. If you are feeling cold after waiting outside for a while, I recommend giving them a shot. The Daily Catch is great for a fun and unique experience for a small group of friends. Order a ton of dishes and maybe some wine on a plastic cup, and have a good time."},{"name":"Mellow Mushroom - Sanford","address":"1831 Rinehart Rd","city":"Sanford","stars":"4","text":"Im from california visiting family in florida.

The marinated chicken is also amazing. Great egg rolls too! Their live tanks have live lobster, crab, oysters and scallops!!! Hard to find live scallops!

No. Not because I didn't like it, but it's not realistic for everyone price wise and that's the honest truth.\\nThe service and ambiance was spot on to when we were greeted and the door was open for us and we were seated and our server shook each of our hands and introduced himself. We were offered mini flashlights if we couldn't quite make out the menu because of the dimmed lighting and when my boss realized she forgot her glasses, our server came with a tray for anyone that needed reading glasses. Cocktail orders were taken and brought back quickly to the table. We took our time ordering our appetizers and then entrees and side dishes. We started with the baked escargot which came with a puff pastry, it was cooked very well and coated nicely with garlic. The ahi tuna tower was delicious as well, perfectly balanced. We couldn't decide between the salads, so our server offered to split up the salads on separate plates for us. I had the bibb lettuce salad. \\nEverything was brought out together and we were all served our plates at the same time, which we all know how frustrating it is to either get your plate and wait for everyone else or be the one everyone else is waiting on. It's the simple things that make this restaurant what it is. Attention to detail makes it an experience and not just another steakhouse. \\nI ordered the center cut filet mignon and fumbled on my words when ordering, knowing the chefs were probably spot on when it comes to the cook of the meat- which they were. This was definitely one of the best cooked steaks I've had in a very long time. \\nI ordered the blue cheese to be on top of the filet, which really took things to the next level for me! For sides we all chose different ones to share around, since the sides aren't small portions. We had the lyonnaise potatoes, brussels sprouts, twice baked au gratin potatoes and asparagus. The sides were very good. We were all tempted to order a couple more, but knew very well we were already over ordering. \\nWe had another cocktail during dinner, I had a Negroni, which I'm pretty darn picky about, but this was superb. Finally a well made cocktail! \\nIt was dessert time and though feeling defeated, we somehow still ordered two desserts- a slice of carrot cake (which could have fed all five of us) and some sort of apple crisp. The carrot cake was  not something I'd have again. I tried a couple of bites and I know how ridiculous this sounds, but it was it tasted too much like carrot! Then the whipped cream on the side? Was just...cream. I suppose it's something that's supposed to just be there to cut into the sugary cake a bit, but it's not that sugary of a cake. That was probably the only disappointment of the entire meal. \\nIt's definitely a meal worth bragging about, but something I won't be back for too soon. Definitely a place to go and put the money on the company card- oops did I say that?

Check in was fast and friendly, accommodating my high floor King bed request. My room was clean and comfortable. They weren't able to grant a late check out which at the time annoyed me but I found my way to the pool at the Ritz and lunch and laying out before my flight home which was probably a more relaxing choice than sitting and working inside.The hotel grounds are pretty amazing. I really fell in love with being able to walk between the Marriott and the Ritz, utilizing both properties and getting outdoors between meetings. The gym is located between the two hotels in the spa area, which I visited 3 out of 4 days here. The equipment is up to date and they offer  group fitness classes. The property boasts tons of activities from golf, to volleyball, tennis, bocce ball courts, countless swimming pool areas, a lazy river, bars, lounges, restaurants, gym, spa, arcades, kids clubs, walking trail beside their wetlands, bird watching, butterfly garden, you name it. Weather here on business or pleasure you should surely find something to appreciate about the place.The conference space layout was easy to navigate with adequate signage even between multiple floors and what surprised me the most was the quality of the food provided during these meetings. Some of the meals were surprisingly tasty for hotel food.I did not dine at any of the restaurants at the Marriott but there are several options. Most were booked to capacity when we wanted a reservation for nine and Kitchen was closed for remodeling. I did hear from some who dined at Citron one night and were not impressed. The restaurants at the Ritz are all walking distance, and can be reached by remaining indoors or walking outside to get to them.They provide shuttle service to and from the parks which is also nice. Definitely a gorgeous place to work from for a week, and I didn't count a single mosquito bite on me the entire time which is pretty much a miracle considering they usually eat me alive.Ubering from the hotel back to the airport (20 min drive or less)  was also extremely convenient and cost efficient.

The tofu soup (soondooboo) is always good and they also have grilling for those who enjoy Korean BBQ. The service is not that great but that's pretty standard for most Korean restaurants.

The mustard greens they bring out to help compliment the dish really help temper the spices of the dish.- Curry/noodle dish: I forgot the name of this dish but it was one of the curry noodle dishes that was more mild in flavor and also came with a side of dirty rice. The mild flavor of this dish helped combat the flavors of the other dish.I loved everything about Pok Pok. The quirkiness of the decorations and the restaurant itself.

I got a volcano roll, general tso chicken combo, and shrimp lo mein combo (not to mention the free crab rangoon i got with a coupon) so that's pretty reasonable. But i would probably order ahead next time. The combos came with egg rolls and fried rice, which i think is pretty basic. The general tso chicken was pretty good, it did taste more like orange chicken and wasn't very spicy like it should be, i did like how it was all white meat though. Shrimp lo mein is one of my favorites and theirs did not disappoint. The fried rice that came with the combos was pretty good and also was topped with white meat chicken. Now for the disappointments, the egg rolls weren't that great (i only ate half of one and got rid of the other), and the sushi was lack luster. Maybe i've been too spoiled by Sushikos rolls, but pretty much only ate them because i didn't want to waste them. The staff was really friendly, and it seemed to be just a single family operating it. In the end i could probably see myself going back here, for the most part it was good."},{"name":"Pepper Lunch","address":"5951 No 3 Road, Unit 150","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"A good place to go for a quick lunch.

It is the kind of no-frills place you expect from a legitimate BBQ joint.  Walk past the large stainless steel drink trough, grab a cold one (or three), head to the counter and order the appropriate amount of brisket (served in 1/2 increments), pay and eat.  There is a lot of indoor seating, but if the weather is nice (read: not too hot), go out on the patio.  From there, you can inhale the wood smoke while eating your brisket.  Oh, yeah, they have other items too, such as chicken, ribs and sausage (although the spicy sausage is quite good).  But, this is Texas BBQ we're talking about here.  And that means brisket, pure and simple.  Rudy's does this cut of meat exceedingly well, and if you get the extra moist cut, doesn't really need sauce.  However, the peppery, thin sauce is quite good and does compliment the smokiness of the meat very well.As far as sides go, you get a stack of squishy white bread standard with your order.  They do have potato salad and cole slaw, both of which are simply \\"OK\\".  I did not get the beans, but will make a point to the next time I go.What I love most about this place, and authentic BBQ places in general, is the price point.

We enjoyed our first visit to Weather Up so much we invited some out of town friends to meet us there two days later for a Sunday afternoon drink. We had delicious drinks, admired our amazing ice cubes, and then ... our waitress lost our credit card.  We waited for a good 30 minutes while the waitress and a couple of people on staff looked for our credit card to no avail. We left our information hoping that we wouldn't have to cancel the card, change all our auto payments, and go without a credit card for a week. I woke up to a call from the bar on my cell phone at 12:30 a.m. letting me know they had found the card. What was the point of calling me that late, when (1) I probably have work since it's a Monday, and (2) the bar doesn't open til 4 p.m.--couldn't you have called me then? When my husband went in to pick up the card, the bartender couldn't find it (again), and instead I had to relay to my husband where the person who left the message said the card would be. When we finally got the card back, my husband joked \\"So next round is on you guys?\\" but the bartender just laughed it off.I understand people make mistakes. I understand that one day you may get great food/service somewhere, and then the next time it's not so great--because that's just the nature of the game. What I don't understand is when a business obviously does something wrong, accident or no accident, and then doesn't make up for it.

Never had anything but an excellent meal. The only thing ever questioned was the style of the bread. Yes there are different styles of \\"Italian\\" bread, but hell he was from northern maine where they think the soft white dinner roll is haute cuisine.One of the few places i'd wait in line. though i try to time it for evening opening or late lunch.It has stayed small (and they got rid of the steam pipe) and reasonably priced for the north end. I also never feel like they are trying to flip my table probably because i'm either at a small table or with a bigger party (the whole big table) and we eat a lot of items. Though i have eaten sharing a table and that is a lot of fun too. Well for me - i probably scared the tourists who were sitting with me into never coming back. Which may not be a bad thing.no bathroom and at 50+ getting across the street in the winter is getting tougher. the wine selection really isn't much of one but you get even less of a selection in places like this is Italia.I think it only seats 18 people but there are chairs out front for waiting. If you eat there in the winter it is toasty warm (even toastier in the summer - no AC) and you will not be attacked by vampires on the way home - bag your clothes if you are at a hotel unless you love the smell of garlic.You want fancy glasses, linens, plates with cute designs, quiet, romantic, candles and a big wine list go to any one of the other good restaurants in the north end. You'll feel so warm and cuddly inside afterward. You want to feel like you're eating in Aunt Francesca's cucina in Italia eat here. Oh yea you are in the kitchen too. You'll leave here satiated looking forward to your next visit. I hate it when i go to boston with a group over 6 b/c i don't get to eat here. It just kills me!I was also in here once when the owner sent the fish back out the door with the delivery guy b/c he wasn't happy with it. I was there waiting for them to open for lunch. If you're a calamari fan you'll taste the difference. I took a couple of Aussies here and his mother had worked in the Sydney fish market her whole life, so they love their seafood. They couldn't believe that Yanks could prepare seafood so well. It also had a feel that they found missing in most US restaurants. Sydney is a foodie heaven so you can put credence in their assessment if not mine. I don't think they serve dessert after all they are across the street from Mike's. We've never asked and we don't go to Mike's for dessert. No I'm not telling where i go for dessert.BTW - the pasta servings are big. even as a fat guy i can get away with the calamari Black Pasta Aglio Olio appetizer and the small fried calamari app. That is under 21$ b4 tax and tip."},{"name":"Slappy Cakes","address":"4246 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I am torn on this one.

There's pretty much always a wait, be ready for that. don't be starving cause that's just a bad combo. I'd avoid the suggestion of going over to whiskey soda, that wasn't a very good idea. it took the server about 15 min to get us water and another 15 or so to grab us drinks. The idea is good, but the execution seems off. perhaps I'll try it again. On to the good stuff the foods. I would suggest you get two things of the wings if you have more than 2 people, they'll be gone in a second seriously. I prefer the spicy, which isn't burn your face off hot, but it's got a kick and a much enjoyable added something. The last two times I've had the broken crepe, Hoi Thawt, which has fast become my favorite dish there. it has a wonderful clean flavor, just good food. The last time it was extremely salty, one and only time I've ever had to send anything back, but it was rectified quickly and it's seriously one of my favorite things there. Kaeng Hung Leh praised pork belly and shoulder was quite good and we enjoyed it, it just isn't as fantastic as the wings or crepe. Kai Yaang- game hen, I actually really liked this, my date at the time had issues with the bones..to which i had to say. peh psh. Yam Khai Dao - beyond tasty, highly recommended. I personally think the coconut rice is much better than the sticky. The next thing I want is the tilapia. there's usually a special of that and I've always wanted to try it, but seems more like a bigger party kind of thing. speaking of, big parties are welcome as I've seen it, but make sure you have a reservation. don't be all bent out of shape that you're wait is an hr and a half when you have 8 people drop in. thems the breaks kids.

For someone who handles heat pretty well, I didn't find any of our dishes to be all that spicy. We were warned that the Muu Paa Kham Waan would be really spicy but the spicy kick lasted only in the beginning for me - but my friend who can't really eat spicy foods was basically dying of the heat. We had ordered the Fish Sauce Wings in the spicy version, but  it was a bit too salty for all of us, albeit it is made of fish sauce (yes, we did realize) so it's best to order a bowl of rice with that dish.

Torchy's was my first foray into Austin-based Mexican eateries.I employed strategy number 1. Burrito. This solely determines whether I shall return or not. Chicken Super Burrito. Every burrito I order at a new taqueria gets the same ingredients. Usually its Chicken, rice, standard beans (preferably pinto or black), salsa, cheese, guacamole, and sour cream (light).I feel this approach is best in creating an opinion of an establishment as the main ingredients in said burrito are pretty much the main, basic ingredients that make up the bulk of a taqueria's menu. Should any piece be below par, it won't be the proverbial nail in the coffin, its just a sign that something is amiss and another menu item may need to be tested.Torchy's passed with flying colors. I got refried beans instead of whole pintos, which I feel may have been a mistake. But everything was well balanced, well cooked, and quite tasty. My only suggestion is. THEIR SALSA RULES!!!!!... but they put it on the side. I wish it was just dumped in the burrito. I found out later that they have several varieties of salsas, which means the salsa on the side makes for a better customer customized combination.

On one hand the pancakes are delicious. They offer a wide variety of toppings that are fantastic, I recommend the white chocolate chips and bacon combination.  I also have to give them props for the music they play in the background, they mix in some of today pop-hits but it's mostly 90's music from when I was a kid. My husband and I like to play name that band while at this restaurant. On the other hand the Service is Terrible. Many people go this restaurant because of the cook your own pancake concept, but what will happen when this trend gets old? Will people continue to come once the fad has passed? If the service at the restaurant continues in the direction it is going, the answer is NO.On both occasions that I have gone to this restaurant it has taken the waitress 10 to 15 minutes to take our order, maybe that's why the wait to this restaurant is an hour because the wait staff moves at the pace of a 100 year old turtle.  If you want a refill on your coffee or any other beverage it would be best if you walked over to the food carts next door and got your juice or soda there, as the wait staff is no where to be found nor do they come around to check if you need anything.  My husband and I ordered some sodas that were flat, it probably took us about 10 minutes to flag down our waitress so that we could get something different to drink. The best part is when we will tell our waitress that the sodas are flat and she responds by saying that the soda machine hasn't been working correctly and it has been like that all day and there is nothing they can do. Ummm yes, yes you can, how about you tell your customers that the soda machine is not working ??? To the owner of Slappy Cakes, hire people who are motivated, who will appreciate having a job and will do it with pride and respect. To conclude, I would just go buy some bisquick or Aunt Jemima Pancake Mix.Get some of your favorite topping to add to the batter and cook the pancakes yourself, this will help you avoid having to be subjected to terrible service."},{"name":"Allston Diner","address":"431 Cambridge St","city":"Allston","stars":"3.5","text":"Stumbled upon this place after getting a car wash from across the street.

My friends and I went there recently around 10pm for a few drinks and some snacks. First, service was both slow and inefficient: two servers would come to the table with significant delays (about half the restaurant was empty) and didn't seem to keep track of who did what. Second, the drinks were expensive ($14-15) which isn't a problem by itself, but also weak. I downed mine in about 15 minutes and felt nothing. Third, the food was expensive (again not a problem by itself) and mediocre. I ordered their dessert which is a \\"PB&J Pot de Creme\\", which seemed like someone put half a jar of Skippy in a cup and a bread cracker from a bag. The server dropped the cracker (which is supposed to be a \\"cinnamon toast brioche\\" apparently) on the table and had nothing to say about it, which given the prices I'd expect some level of observation on. $50 for 3 weak drinks and a few poor snacks with slow service is, in my opinion, deserving of a 1 star review. I don't plan on returning. Had this come out to $30 or so I'd give at least a 3 star review; I can tolerate mediocre food for middle of the road prices. But when it costs me $23 for half a shot of whiskey and half a lunchables, there's nowhere to go but down.EDIT: I'm adjusting this to 2 stars from 1 after speaking to the owner about my experience.

I had to peel a good half pound of meat off of my sandwich to make it eatable (that's right, not edible, EATable - there is no way a sandwich that tall was created with human consumption in mind), but it was a damn good sandwich.

No. When he got home I opened the box that was supposed to have my nachos and all I see is a bed of lettuce. Wonderful. Who puts a plain bed of lettuce in a box and sends it out anyway? We call to let them know and all we get is a \\"ok we will start the nachos now you can come back\\". Awesome! Thanks for the courtesy, maybe you could have offered to comp the nacho, deliver it, or even a coupon would have put me on better terms.

It's service for food is so horrible that I hardly ever come here hungry anymore. That's okay because the cocktails and happy hour will keep me coming back. If they got rid of the food I think it would still be successful. They might even have better profits if they focus on that. I tried this place soon after they opened. The Gateway was a brand spanking new place that replaced a bunch of shady though great bars or restaurants. This was here from the beginning. Since then many others have moved out. This and Ugly Tuna must be doing something right, and it probably has something to do with campus kids and cheap liquor. It has a great but not long enough happy hour from 4:30 to 6:30. It's half off drafts and the margaritas are cheaper. The Mad Mex margaritas are $3 for 12 oz., $5 for 16 oz., and $7 for 22 oz. It has several good flavors of margaritas, but I like the black cherry or raspberry. In addition, Mondays are all you can eat burritos for $6. The problem is these burritos suck. It has no seasoning, no vegetables. Another special is the Late Mex when food is half off from 10 to 12. They have many vegan options, with cheese or sour cream that can substitute. Among the appetizers is the Pennsyltucky Fried Tofu. This is about $9 and comes with bean sprouts, and is tossed in cilantro, sesame seeds, and soy sauce. It's my favorite thing on the menu. Burritos are served with rice. These are about $9 to $10. Angry Hippie comes with black beans, portobello, and spinach. Chickpea Chili comes with tomatillo chickpea chili and rice. Mad Mex comes with choice of protein, black beans, and salsa. Pico comes with black beans and pico. Veggie comes with black beans, portobello, and zucchini. I like these the most of the entrees and would stick to these if ordering food. The enchiladas come with Colorado sauce, which is chili and tomato, or Green Sauce, which is jalapeno and tomatillo. The Veggie is about $11. It comes with corn, portobello, and zucchini. The fajitas are about $12 or more. I'm not paying that much for some vegetables. The quesadillas are better priced. The Happy Hippie is about $10. It comes with mushrooms, pico, and spinach. The tacos come in 3 each and are tiny. It's about $12 or more which is crazy. The Herb O'Vore's Tofu Tacos are good but not worth it. The wraps are about $10. A Tofu Wrap comes with crispy fried tofu, rice, and the choice of sauce. It's not bad but still is not cheap. The service also sucks really bad. They are too busy gossiping with each other, they're playing with phones and other shit like that. I recommend coming here for happy hour or the specials. If you order food late it's half price which brings the cost more in line with what it really should be. The food is mostly average but the margaritas are some of the best and happy hour will not be too bad for you."},{"name":"Rudy's \\"Country Store\\" and Bar-B-Q","address":"11570 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Their BBQ is top notch with an array of meat and poultry to choose from.

The only thing that keeps me from becoming a regular is the price. My meal didn't include any rice or beans and the chips were extra as well.

While waiting for above mentioned dishes, a must-try appetizer is the calamari; the exterior is perfectly fried while somehow keeping the squid juicy.  There's only one chef for the whole restaurant, and it's pretty impressive watching him whip together all these orders at once. It seems there are two cooks who rotate every once in awhile, and my favorite one is the Asian guy (Jimmy Lee).

We started with a dozen oysters, a selection of the Island Creek, Chatham and Wellfleet oysters. Surprisingly, I preferred the chatham and wellfleet over the island creek. The chatham are big and meaty, leaning on the sweet side, while the wellfleet are small, but full of salty, sea flavors. The island creek were in the middle, size wise, and just not as memorable compared to the other two. All were crazy fresh though, so don't think you can really go wrong and who would expect less from an oyster bar?? I had the halibut entree - personally the beets and carrots that came with the dish were more delectable than the fish itself, which is decent but much too large a portion and while the center was done well, the edges were just over cooked. the outside sear was well seasoned and crispy though. one in our party ordered the lobster roe noodles which exceeded expectations. the pasta is so perfectly cooked, I actually felt I experienced what those TV chefs mean when they talk about \\"al dente\\" pasta. it was a delightfully bouncy textured pasta that didnt leave you feeling overstuffed with starch. I was also surprised by the bluefish, which was my favorite out of the 3 fish dishes our table ordered. its lighter than the halibut or striped bass, but more \\"fishy\\" in a good way. makes you think of the seaside. We finished with dessert - the stone fruit tart with buttermilk custard is ok, but the real star is the accompanying herbal ice cream that comes with it. I think it's basil ice cream? Whatever it is, it's delicious, refreshing and rich at the same time. the perfect end to a seafood dinner.The chocolate pot de creme is also really friggin' good and comes with a dollop of whipped cream and a deliciously sufficient layer of caramel. Definitely get it. So worth the $10 price The space is gorgeous and elegant, but the atmosphere is comfortable.

I liked it. But everyone had built so much hype around it. By the time I finally saw it my initial reaction could be summed up in one word: charming. A nice family comedy, that everyone should experience once, but I am not sure I'd willingly see it again. That was Pok Pok for me. A charming establishment. But I don't think I'd choose to go back again. Don't get me wrong the food was great. Usually when I go to Thai restaurants, I want to ask, 'I am in a Thai restaurant right? Okay, just making sure.' I had the Kai Krop Kraprow. It's my favorite Thai dish. Ever. Period. Pok Pok made it spot on! The combination of authentic thai basil, ground chicken stir-fried with crisp cut green beans and green chili topped with a fried egg...mmmmh! So freaking good! Best dish ever! So what was the problem? I paid 10 dollars for a dish that was tiny. Now I know I am being stingy, but if I am paying 10 dollars for some chicken I expect a mountain of food! But I get this plate and I can't help but wonder if it's the staffs way of telling me I need to loose weight. I won't lie, I was really disappointed.Second thing that really bothered me was the staff. They were there, but not at all. Seriously, speaking to them was like speaking to a mime. A lot of facial expressions but no action! When I ask for a refill on my soda, it means I want a refill. I am in no way skinny, but I think I can afford a little extra soda.  Anyways...yeah...was not impressed.Thankfully I am rating mostly on food. So if  you've got a some extra dinero and want to check out a some Thai cuisine definitely check them out.

They're charming."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"My daughter is a lover of books, and I mean she *loves* books. Books are living, breathing creatures made of paper and ink. She loves the physical feel of a book in her hand, physically turning the pages, the smell so unique to books. Books are like works of art for her, she has multiple copies of some novels because of the artwork or unique binding or covers. It made sense that her birthday destination would take us to Portland, the home of Powell's Books, the bookstore of all bookstores.We spent hours at Powell's and she was in heaven, we even had to make a second trip because once was not enough! The stacks that house the books are filled with helpful cards that explain the genre of books located in the section and which books you may be interested in based on your interested of a specific book. How handy is that? Usually, you have to go online to find this type of information, I love that Powell's has made itself relevant in this digital age. The store has an actual map, which is completely necessary! The sections of the store are organized by color codes by genre so you can easily find your section. There are also many fun gift items available throughout the store. New books sit on the shelf right next to used books and the prices are quite reasonable. The store is open until 11 PM and I would suggest you take advantage of the later hours. Powell's is a tourist destination, for good reason, which makes it exceptionally busy during the day time. The parking garage is a little odd, you must drive up to the gate and wait for someone to come out. The attendant takes your keys and gives you a ticket, parking is validated for free up to an hour. Parking is tight! We were there much longer than an hour, but since we came out with arms full of books, the attendant did not charge us for the extra time."},{"name":"Barlow","address":"737 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Walked into this place at random and was blown away!

The service and food were mediocre, and for the same price, I could have an amazing dinner at so many restaurants in Atlanta.It was fairly busy tonight, as in most tables were full, but no one was waiting in line, so I'm sure they've seen busier. Our server, Ian, was rushed and less than polite. I asked about the four specials listed on the chalkboard outside, and he gave me a very vague description of only two of them. He continued to barely acknowledge us for the rest of the dinner, awkwardly reaching over us to clink down our plates and fill glasses, never responding to our thank you's.My boyfriend ordered a filet, medium. It came out as one of the rarest steaks I've ever seen. He nicely asked them to cook it for a few more minutes, and they handled it very promptly and politely. We've never sent food back before, so that should tell you how off the mark it was, although we appreciated them being nice about it.  However, when you have to send your food back and wait ten minutes for it to come back out, it would be nice to get a free dessert, 10% off, or something. None of that happened.I ordered the Crab and Parmesan Crusted Flounder -- the fish had definitely been frozen previously, and there was not a speck of crab to be seen. As for the \\"crust\\" -- it was actually what looked to be melted cheddar (bright yellow) cheese. The flavor was good, but for $27, it just was not where it needed to be.For $92, we could have had a delicious dinner with stellar service somewhere else, I doubt we'll go back."},{"name":"Habibi Lebanese Semoran","address":"6651 S Semoran Blvd, Ste 108","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"As a Lebanese girl, I can tell you one thing AWFUL food  the staff was super nice and I'm very sorry about this review.

The atmosphere is family/casual, spotlessly clean too. Our waitress in particular was very sweet. We ordered the basics, linguine and meatballs, pizza for the kids, and fettucine alfredo. Before the entrees arrived, you do get a loaf of bread. I disagree w/ other reviewer about it tasting like baked pizza dough! It was fresh, warm, and crusty...quite nice really. The food was very acceptable, although it depends on what you like. The meatballs are very dense (but that's how I like them!) and the flavor was good. My husband thought the alfredo sauce was a bit bland. The portions are enormous for sure. We (my husband and I) both got the \\"small\\" sized entrees and they were big enough for 2 adults! (We took home leftovers) The kids both chose pepperoni pizza from the kids menu and they each got 1/2 a pizza!

I saw a bread pudding that sounded amazing so I went with the shrimp n grits as chicken and waffles and a bread pudding would have been over the top. The grits were creamy goodness served  on a bed of collar greens. The shrimp were grilled and had some heat on them. The grilled shrimp actually threw me off a bit - most shrimp and grit recipes seem to have the shrimp integrated more into the dish. But it was good and the grits were awesome. My favorite part of the meal was the bread pudding. The tables around me were eyeing me dessert pretty hard. It was a huge serving that could have easily served 2 or more people. It was dense with a nice baked crust to it and had a big heaping scoop of vanilla ice cream and drizzled with a Caramel apple sauce. I could only eat half because it was so big!

If there's a god and there's a heaven, please let this be my eternal fate. I promise I'll be good on earth and eat as many desserts to prepare for my everlasting duties on my chocolate mousse cloud.Besides loving the concept, it's also a wonderful experience to visit Finale. It's open late which would obviously be the first \\"must\\" for a dessert restaurant and the ambiance is romantic without being stuffy. It's bustling, it's crowded, it's fun and worth the wait. Our wait was about ten minutes which wasn't bad considering there were a few people in front of us. Once we got seated we had spot-on service. Everyone was very friendly from the hostess to the waitress who was extremely enthusiastic about serving us. Although I think I would be too if I were handing plates of sugar to people all night long. As you flip through the huge pages of their menu, make sure you really hone in on what kind of taste you want for the night. Since I'm all about chocolate we ordered the Molten Chocolate (a no-brainer) and the Boston Creme. I have to say that I loved the molten chocolate which oozed perfectly and paired great with the coffee ice cream, but I was addicted to the whoppie pies in the Boston Creme. The bavarian cream itself wasn't anything too special, but the flavor and texture of the pies was *muah* perfection. As if this wasn't enough sugar to make you a diabetic overnight, we also ordered two specialty cocktails, which, I gotta admit, sort of rivaled the desserts. The hazelnut martini was mouthwatering delicious. There's nothing subtle about it--it's an intense hazelnut taste with a nice silky texture, so if you're a fan of hazelnut then you'll love this. We also ordered the root beer float, which was supposedly alcoholic, but if it was, we couldn't really tell. Don't get me wrong though, it tasted good, there was just hardly any zing to it, but perhaps that's naturally how ice cream masks liquor. But I would definitely rate the martini over the float. Overall a lovely, indulgent experience. Yep, it's pricey and maybe not as gourmet as you may think with those prices but I think it was well worth it. For elegant presentation (that you can actually watch in the mirror above the chefs!) and excellent service, I'm starting to crave Finale just writing about it.

The sushi turns pretty quick and is of good quality. Some folks I come with are here only for the sushi. The hot food is not treated like an afterthought and I have enjoyed a chicken and beef dish. I am not a desert person, but most everyone in my party raved about the made to order crepes which can be filled with fruit or Nutella. The physical space is slightly upscale cafeteria. Great for a group get together or hanging with some buddies. Not so great for an early relationship date...\\"Hey Sweetie... they aren't making any money on Big Daddy tonight.. I'm getting my feedbag on\\".Dinner is $26 or $29 depending on what day of the week it is.

For $15, I expected a lot more from my 6 wings.....do you guys realize how expensive this is for chicken wings? They're one of the cheaper parts of the chicken at the market and the ingredients used are cheap too.

In actuality, the style doesn't seem too healthy, but no way would I regret something so delicious. Let me paint you the picture: The hostess opens the door for you, greeting you with a nice, warm smile. As you are seated, you look around at this beautifully decorated restaurant with a stylish mix of trendy, hipster, classy, and green. The waitress then promptly welcomes you. Friendly, mannered, and trained, she kindly offers detailed suggestions from the menu. What a start, and I haven't even mentioned the food!While the waitress's recommendations sounded like good sweet combinations (Yelp seems to agree), I was in the mood for a savory dish, and frankly, I had been eyeing the brussel sprouts as soon as I sat down. We let our taste buds take over as we examined the menu, and as a result, we settled on: ROASTED BRUSSEL SPROUT STARTER- a sweet and sour tang with a oddly familiar taste. Just a ting of chili, not spicy per se but something to add a flavorful kick. BRUSSEL SPROUT AND WILD MUSHROOM PIZZA- Exactly satisfied my savory craving. Just smelling it, I felt the suspense of a memorable meal. Crust was just the right crunchiness, too. Cheese so wonderfully stringy, thus I will say this pizza definitely doesn't feel healthy. SEARED TUNA SALAD- Odd, but quite pleasing complements of flavors. From the description, this sounded good. Avocado, yes. Seared tuna, yes. Grapefruit, yes. Watermelon radish, yes..? Just all, yes! And when we tried it, they really do work well together. Well-made salad, not just a healthy choice.

If you have no taste, standards, or common sense, this is your place.We were there on a Friday and ordered lamb shanks, which they misspelled as \\"lamp shanks\\" on their website.  They didn't have any, so we ordered a P10 lamb dish, a gyro plate, and a Greek salad.After long time, the idiot cook, who I think was also the owner or manager, informed the girl working the front that there was no lamb.  She responded by offering another dish that also contained the lamb they had none of.  The guy in the kitchen very rudely informed her of her mistake and she rattled off a bunch of alternatives.I had already paid and left a good tip in the jar, so I told her to just substitute a reasonable equivalent.  That substitution turned out to be chicken.  And it was dry and just plain sucked.  That's what happens when you trust the ethically challenged to make a decision - chicken in place of lamb.  No reasonable person of good character would attempt such a stunt.After stepping into their filthy restroom, the inclination to eat any of their food seemed highly questionable.  It was in deplorable condition with NO TOWELS.  The dining room was also in dirty, funky condition.As we quickly ate the salad so we could get the hell out of that nasty place, I felt something wrap around my tongue.  Yep, a long hair in the unimpressive Greek salad.  I held it up for the girl behind the counter to see.  She seemed embarrassed.  The jerk with the spatula responded with his apparently typical rudeness.  We left, leaving the entire uneaten nasty chicken entree on the table.  Overnight we both had upset stomachs.  Yuck.  Just yuck.The pita bread was so dry and hard that at first I thought it was a batch of arrowheads wrapped in foil that an anthropology professor had left on the table.  The rice dolmades that were a pleasant surprise in the salad turned out to be the worst canned junk I've ever had, and I've had some bad ones.  The rice filling was oddly hard and grainy with a rancid oil taste.  *SHUDDER*I find that little things are indicative of how big things are handled.  If you leave your bathroom and dining room in such poor condition and are too much of a colossal idiotic, apathetic dunce to spell \\"lamb\\" properly on a website for a Middle Eastern restaurant (see photo), one might not be surprised to learn you perform poorly with much more important food service issues.Austin has too much good food for one to waste their time and dignity on this crap.

He has a dairy allergy and they were very accommodating for him, offering suggestions and they brought out the Chef to confirm what was ok and not ok for him.  We wouldn't have gone here without hearing the recommendations from other neighbors, but we're glad we did.  The decor inside is nicer than the outside suggests.

The menu is well edited, very affordable, and promising.  You'll find soft corn tortilla tacos al pastor, fresh cilantro, and mango salsa.  There's Jarritos in the cooler and a bright, inviting dining room.

Exciting, right?  Perhaps too exciting - because for all that Mexica's potential, they just can't seem to nail the execution.  From my perspective, it's clear that Mexica's quality is tanking precisely because of how popular it is.  For example, today I waited in a line out the door with 4 people in front of me for 20 minutes - and then another 15 minutes for my to-go order.  After settling down at my desk to eat, I discovered that my food was only kind of close to what I had ordered.  Honestly, that's not always a problem for me - I can roll with the punches and have been pleasantly surprised by food that I didn't even know I wanted.  But it wasn't even good.  The corn tortillas were brittle dry, the meat was tough and apparently paying an upcharge to get shrimp in your taco means you get two shrimp.  Two.  I don't begrudge a restaurant a bad day, but experiences like today are increasing becoming the status quo at Mexica.  I've been eating lunch downtown for about four years now, and I'm pretty sure I remember some excellent meals at Mexica.

Potpourri like, yes, but absolutely wonderful.In short: yummy food, decent portions, don't expect much in the way of speedy service.

Being vegetarian, I don't think I got the full experience, as the majority of options were not meat-free, including (sadly) the deviled eggs, which included bacon. But there's still plenty to eat for veggie-lovers, including (but not limited to): migas, roasted new potatoes, green chile grits, hash brown casserole, broccoli & cheese casserole and pasta salad. There weren't any waffles, as I'd been promised when I agreed to go to Moonshine - apparently they serve waffles, pancakes OR french toast and we showed up on pancake day. I've heard stories about the long wait times, but we showed up Saturday during ACL, and as busy as it was, we only had to wait half an hour or so - and like I said, that was during ACL..

Hubby had been wanting to try it. We got there when they first opened. As with all sweet tomatoes when you walk in, you are confronted with the salad bar first. Its no different when you go to breakfast. The \\"salad\\" bar is set up are ready to go. Yum. Now, this is where problems start. When paying the cashier was having trouble running my husbands card because the system was slow. She tried twice before the manager said the system would have to be restarted again. Of course the manager said because he had to restart the system the card was not charged. Of course it was charged not once, not twice but all three times. The manager walked over the third receipt and said he would make sure it got fixed. Took over a week and a half but it finally was. Both the waitress removing our plates and the manager mentioned to please go have someone make us a special omelet which sounded great but both times I went up there after waiting over 5 minutes each time no one came out to make any special omelets. I did watch a few different employees come out of the back to make themselves a plate though. Including the manager himself who went behind the counter to the omelet station and make himself one. Some of the scrambled eggs look like they have been setting there a while. The muffins were good and fresh. The hash browns were also good but could have been hotter. The salad bar even though I thought was weird to be having so early in the morning turned out to be great and tasty. The bathrooms were clean and I expected them to be since we did open the place. I would like to give it another try but maybe just not the first thing in the morning."},{"name":"Los Cabos Mexican Restaurant","address":"2252 E Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4","text":"This is best Mexican restaurant I have been to since moving here from Chicago!

The waiter says I'll move you but since you're a party of 2 you may have to sit with another party - no problem.   Then he decides that if a large party comes in he'll have to move us back.   Are you kidding me?   This place is a filthy little tourist trap that is living on the over-hype from social media.   Go down the street to Giacomo's - it will be crowded, you will feel rushed but you will get a good meal for a good price and be treated like a customer should be treated.

I'm not normally a huge fan of sandwiches, but Sam LaGrassa's sure as hell knows how to make a good one.The bread was fresh, crispy, and grilled. The pastrami had a fantastic smoke-ring on it with huge flavor. The cheese was melting outside of the bread. The sandwich was really just delicious, plain and simple. Add the coleslaw and sweet chipotle mustard sauce, and you have a sandwich so good it may make your pupils dilate.Now, the chowder. I had chowder at a couple places while in Boston (Doyle's Cafe being the other), and I thought Sam LaGrassa's fell a bit short.

It was not busy but we had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated even thought there were empty tables.  It took a while before our waitress came to take our orders.  The girls ordered chicken tenders and fries and I had the Mexican salad.   When we received our food, I was very disappointed in the presentation of the salad. The grill chicken was tasty but the salad was limp (edges of lettuce were brown) and the diced onions were frozen and stuck together in big clumps.  It looked like the kind of salad that you would buy pre-packaged but at least those tasted fresher. The girls asked for refills on the fries with more than one waitstaff and the answer was the same \\" it being made in the kitchen and its coming\\".  If they offer \\"bottomless\\" fries, would you think that the kitchen is constantly making it  since its not a special custom order.  They ended up waiting 20 minutes and were finished with the chicken by then.   When I asked how did they like their dish since mine was a bust.  The response was \\"it was ok but its the kind of chicken that makes you feel yucky afterwards\\".  Now, this is coming from girls who loves to eat out at restaurants all the time.I would not waste my $ at this Red Robin.

I honestly think this was our best experience yet. Despite the crush of people at KRS for NYE, we were seated almost immediately. We had a roomy banquet under the monstrous portrait of Kevin Rathbun, which was right next to a huge cluster of candles. It felt cozy and warm...something I can't always say about our previous visits. Overall the food was great, but the apps were probably the weakest part of the meal. Nova loved her Caesar salad, but Heather said her lobster fritters didn't compare to Chops (though she did say they were good). I liked the flavors in my butternut squash soup, but it was more of a puree. I really missed the velvety texture I've enjoyed in other versions. When it came to the beef, we were all quite pleased. Both Nova and I ordered the 10 oz. ribeye with bleu cheese butter. Each was cooked to order, had a nice char and an awesome melt-in-your-mouth flavor. Heather was also happy with her petite filet as well. My only knock was that my ribeye had much more fat and muscle tissue than Nova's. I expect some of that with a ribeye, but in my mind it wasn't the greatest cut.As I mentioned previously, the sides are typically great here. The only disappointment was the greasy and super-puffy onion rings. Of all the sides we ordered for the table, it was the only plate with anything left on it. You can't go wrong though with the mac and cheese tart or the creamed corn with jalape√±os. The cheese grits and fries are also good. Though we probably shouldn't have, we opted for dessert at the end of the meal. Nova and Heather split a wonderful apple cobber while I got a delicious brownie sundae with chocolate and caramel sauces, as well as toffee bits and housemade Chantilly cream.Despite the few dishes that were merely good, this turned out to be an amazing meal. At $195 for the three of us, it obviously wasn't the kind we have everyday, but it was a great way to end a largely miserable year.

Lindey's is still number one for lobster bisque, but this one comes in at a very close second.The decor is exceptional. Be sure to take in the site while you enjoy your meal. Painted murals and a decorative ceiling remain from the bank lobby. The restaurant is in what was once a bank lobby built in the 1920s. Columbus Landmarks Foundation featured the building and old bank president's office (that overlooks the bank lobby) on City Hop in 2011. This bank was the site of many bank robberies because of the easy access to busy 3rd Street. Robbers would jump out of the car, rob the bank and jump back in the car and take off. While restoring the lobby for Mitchell's, workers found bullet holes in the ceiling. How cool is that?Great bar and private tables. Staff are excellent and very attentive. Wine prices, however, are outrageously high! More than triple the retail price! It's an insult to people that know wine, but unfortunately is common among most restaurants. If it was not for the outrageous wine prices, I would have given four stars.

WOW. The flavors were so beautiful and balanced. I really did not like the Yam Samun Phrai (\\"Thai Herbal Salad\\"). I'm not sure what it was in there that I did not like, but I thought it smelled terrible. It was an overall very impressive spread. A few things that detracted from the experience: being squished in to a table with other parties crammed uncomfortably on either side, the pricey menu and very overpriced drinks, and the extreme saltiness of the mango sticky rice. It was hard to tell if it was over salted or if the purpose of all the salt on the mangos was meant to be cut by the rice and coconut milk. Hmmmm.

This place is an amazing value; if you know a better Chinese restaurant for the money PLEASE TELL ME WHAT IT IS.  Their roast duck is better than the Peking duck at most good Chinese restaurants, and for $8.95!  In fact if you want a fine dining experience (without linen and crystal obviously), this is the only inexpensive way to do it in Austin.

There are basically two parts to the restaurant, the bar area and the upstairs dining room, each with their own charm.  This restaurant, unlike some others, actually reads notes posted in OpenTable.com reservations.  When I put in that the dinner would be for our 2 year anniversary, they actually brought a card to the table for us.  A very nice touch.The bar is a pretty laid-back atmosphere with a handful of tables and its own menu.  Of course you can still order from the upstairs menu as well.  The bar features a good cocktail list with some unique drinks and the service is impeccable.  The upstairs dining room is pretty classic white tablecloth class.  It also features a fireplace and I believe a private dining room.  We usually start with the barbajuans, which are kind of like croquettes.  Make sure you have the goat cheese and honey ones, which are fantastic.  Don't miss out on the fried artichokes as well.  That said, my personal favorite is the spicy lamb tartare, which comes with a cute little raw quail egg yolk in its shell perched atop a bed of sea salt and comes with toast points.  I've never had anything like it.  For the main course, the beef daube has a brisket-y texture to it in that it is will fall apart with tenderness.  Served in a great sauce it is delicious.  Bottom line, if you are looking for a romantic dinner, or just want to impress someone, go to Bistro Du Midi.  If you're looking for a place to meet friends and have a little upscale good food in a more relaxed environment, check out the bar.Bon app!"},{"name":"Pho Hong","address":"2521 Rutland Dr, Ste 400","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This is going to be one of those tough ones to review.  There's not much backstory here, I wanted to try a new pho place and this was pretty close to me with a decent reputation.  I walked in, picked a seat, and ordered the #20 pho (Rare Eye-Round Steak, Fatty Brisket, and Soft Tendon).  Pho should be fast and this place, although fairly empty, delivered.  I only had to wait two minutes before I got my bowl.  Not enough time to even get bored.The first thing I notice was that the broth is unusually dark.  It rang some alarms that it might be overly salty, but it was actually pretty nice.  The noodles were good too.  It's $6.90 for this small bowl of pho and although it's cheaper than pho at other places, it does feel like there's less stuff.  The meat was fine, but for some reason didn't have that quality taste I was expecting.  The tendon was also a bit tougher; definitely didn't have the gelatinous texture.Service was only okay.  Didn't get any smiles, it was all business.  After the meal I kinda sat around for 5-10 minutes waiting for the check.  You apparently need to go up to the register to pay.  I wish there was a more obvious way to know that.Overall, the meal wasn't bad at all, just not memorable in any good way.

We opted for the regular spicy level and it was perfect. I think i could have handled a little more spicy but this is was nice. Not too spicy, just enough to give it the kick! the chicken wings were juicy, with cripy skin. it was coated in this caramelized sweet sauce. You can definitely taste the fish sauce but wasn't overpowering. The fried garlic that is coated on the wings were delicious too! I love fried garlic. you get 7 pieces for $14+. i do think it's expensive however it's not just wings, it comes as a WHOLE wing with the little drumstick too. So if you think about it, it's actually 7 wings and 7 little drums, so in a way it's not that bad of a price. When I go back to portland, i'm definitely visiting Pok Pok again. Not only do i want to eat the wings again, i'd like to try other dishes.

Coffee is always piping hot, and all the espresso drinks I've had were delicious (Disclaimer: I don't like Starbucks-style super sugary coffee drinks.)Only negatives here are it gets crowded with laptop campers, and thus the wireless starts getting shaky as more people get on it.

Ok, maybe not.Typically, I am not a big fan of sandwiches-- I am more of a wrap or burrito kind of girl. But I have to give props to Sam LaGrassa's! Their pastrami and corned beef sandwich combo is AMAZING. It was love at first bite! There are so many components to this sandwich that make it not just any ordinary sandwich. First, the meat to bread ratio is 3:1. Second, the sweet and sour coleslaw balances the heaviness and saltiness of the pastrami and corned beef. Third, uh...swiss cheese! What happens when all of those ingredients come together? Well, it magically becomes the perfect sandwich! Then why not give them that extra star, if it is that good? Although the sandwich is really delicious, the bread gets soggy because of the coleslaw. And soggy bread is disgusting; it gets too messy to eat. They can easily solve that problem by slathering a fatty layer (i.e. mayonnaise or butter) on the bread and toasting it to form a hydrophobic layer on the bread to protect it from soaking up the liquid from the cole slaw dressing (Nerd talk). In addition, I have a problem with their opening hours... They only open for lunch! What's up with that? Sometimes I crave it as a late night snack, but I can't get my sandwich!

Since we were a fairly large party, I won't list everything that we ordered since that would be substantial, but they do have a large menu with many options for vegetarians.  Some of the few things that we didn't enjoy was the tempura asparagus.  The asparagus was too thick and large and therefore fibrous and the tempura batter was not light as it should be but caked on.

The pastries are pretty good, and the meals taste nice, but the breakfast portions are small for the price (seriously they serve around 4-6 \\"library fries\\" with your order), and the coffee refills can be pretty hard to come by. I keep coming back because I have been \\"just sure\\" I was in on an off day, but I guess their off day is a regular day.So about those \\"library fries.\\" Library fries are just regular old breakfast potatoes, guys, so just give me a nice big scoop please. I have never been to a place that serves such a small side of breakfast potatoes. I like my carbs! Also, I am pretty sure that was not a three egg scramble I got today. It was super small, and I make scrambles all the time. Unless they used robin's eggs, that was only about 2 eggs in there. I didn't leave hungry, but I left feeling a little ripped off for the cost of the meal, and this isn't the first time I have felt that way. So yeah, this isn't a bad place, but it is not the total culinary freak out I have heard it was, and I am not interested in waiting in line for this food.

The ham was the only one I liked. The bread usually tastes a bit stale, the turkey is always filled with the skin, fatty parts. The grilled chicken garden salad is my current selection because hey a free lunch is a free lunch so I can't complain to my bosses, but half the lettuce is the bitter yellowish head parts that I thought were generally thrown out and not added into a salad and charge you 10 bucks for. The chicken is relatively good and well peppered. Could be a tad less dry, but hey can't win them all. The tomatoes and olives are 80% of the times squishy and rotten.

Service was slow last time, probably because every table was full (and many of them were using the ScoutMob discount). I like getting an abundance of fresh veggies with every meal. I could eat pounds of daikon and be perfectly happy!The major issue we had was that we felt the restaurant tried to hit us with a hidden charge at the end of the meal. My date ordered the \\"banh hoi\\", the flat rice dish where you essentially build your own rolls (\\"fajita-style\\", if you will), something I'd gotten previously and enjoyed without any trouble. Although the menu description makes it sound like the noodles are included (the ones used to roll up your mix-ins), they are technically considered an a la carte side and you pay an extra $2 on top of the $11.25 base price for the dish. The assistant manager said the server is supposed to explain it to the customer, and some people order it without the noodles. But our server failed to and we got a surprise on our bill. It wasn't about the finances as much as the principle: the menu nor the server explained that clearly, and we felt like it was very deceitful on their part. We twisted their arms to get it taken off, and wanted to speak with the manager or owner because we were disappointed and felt like it was a hidden cost. Conveniently, both of those people were gone at the time we tried to close the check and we didn't' want to wait around for them to hopefully show up.Although the food was good, I'm not driving out of my way to come out here again, even with a ScoutMob. I highly suggest that management change the menu description to make that clearer, make sure the servers CLEARLY communicate that to the customer(s), or just raise the price to include that item (even though I think $11.25 should be enough to cover some noodles and hot water)."},{"name":"Slappy Cakes","address":"4246 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Went for breakfast on a Sunday morning, not knowing what to expect.

We were immediately seated on the outdoor patio (3 tables) and glanced across the street to see The Times, which was packed with diners.

So we ate dinner elsewhere, set on spending our Lobby Bar Groupon on cocktails ($10-$12): \\n- Raspberry Lime Rickey: menu said it would be served with a shot of raspberry puree. It wasn't, which is unfortunate because the drink was watered down (too much ice)\\n- Seasonal Shot: pineapple infused tequila, no mixers. The shot was pleasant: for once I could drink tequila without gagging.\\n-Moscow Mule with the tequila: tasted mostly of ginger beer, but I was assured that there was plenty of tequila in it. I'd go a little lighter on the ginger beer (and ice) then.Brendan's Drinks\\n- Cucumber Martini: also tasted watered down, but it's cucumber so whatever. Gin was definitely present.\\n- Gin Martini w/ olive: not too shabby\\n- Manhattan: heavy on the Maker's Mark. So far, nothing has beat the manhattans at Deep Ellum, Allston.If we didn't have a Groupon, we wouldn't have tried the place at all. Now having been there, I'm not convinced I'd consider it again.

They did a good job of fitting us all in (though, obviously, we had made reservations beforehand) and though we couldn't all fit at one table they seated us at adjacent tables so we felt like a group.The atmosphere was clean and understated. The room was full of diners but we had no trouble hearing ourselves speak.Service was fast and polite. Some of us had some special dietary needs or preferences, they all seemed to have been accommodated. A few people had to leave early for a meeting, so they helpfully expedited their orders so they could eat and leave.I noticed that they serve breakfast all day, which is great for those of us who consider omelettes to be, properly speaking, a lunch food. But I just went with a panini sandwich, and it was pretty good. The bread had the right amount of toasty crunch but the crust wasn't so hard you feel like you need gum surgery after, which is a common complaint I have about sub par panini.The only thing about my meal that I would say wasn't great were the truffle [oil] fries. They were decent fries and had the right crispiness, but the truffle flavor wasn't particularly strong, and if you didn't know they were \\"truffle\\" beforehand you might have missed it.

Overall, I enjoyed the sandwich - excellent bread, and the zucchini added a nice texture! I did not care for the green beans inside the sandwich - they kept falling out and just didn't add much to it. The sandwich also came with fries and a salad, so for the $13.50 price was definitely a reasonable amount of food. I also ordered a chai latte, which was delicious! Nice and foamy and smooth, and just the perfect amount of spicy and sweet.My friend got the black bean & quinoa burger, which came with green tomato relish, goat cheese, and shredded lettuce, and was served on brioche.

A special dinner out for me veers more into Applebee's territory than anything else. Which is a damn shame, since Portland has such a hot and thriving food scene.I pushed myself out of hermit-dom a few days ago and went to SE Portland (Southeast! I crossed the bridge! *gasp*) to try the famous fish sauce wings that everyone and their mom keeps raving about.The wait on a late Friday afternoon took about 20 minutes. I asked for outdoor seating for two, and a table eventually emptied that I knew for sure would be ours. However, it lay completely empty for awhile (READ: a lot longer than need be). We could've been seated much sooner but the waiters seemed to have forgotten about that table. Of course, it was only once we got our table that I noticed there was a take-out window AND bar seating where you could sit and eat your take-out. Blast! I could've saved on tip money and gone that angle had I paid more attention instead of sulking about that whole forgotten table incident.We only ordered the wings, and (surprise, surprise) loved them. Tender meat with crisp skin glazed in amazing sauce pecked with just the right amount of chili flakes. The water they served with it (and I'm stealing this observation from one of the aforementioned people I'd encountered who told me I just HAD to go to Pok Pok) tastes like \\"the water you rinse your rice with before cooking it.\\" I didn't understand what that could possibly mean until I tried the water here.We had only four wings before we felt just full enough. I wanted to box the rest, so I kept looking and looking for our waiter but she never showed. She took so long that we got hungry again and finished the last two wings.Something's a bit off with the service here, but don't let that deter you from the succulence that is those wings. Do one better and avoid them entirely by getting them to-go at the window."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Love this place!

I've eaten lot's of it in Tokyo, Kyoto, S.F., NYC, Portland, and Hong Kong. Additionally, one sister-in-law is both Japanese and an excellent homestyle cooking chef. I'm happy to report that Kukai is the real deal. Pros: toothsome and tasty Ramen bowls, and well prepared appetizers; reasonable prices; quick and efficient service (from water to serving to clearing); clean (the restaurant opened recently); laid back atmosphere; has table service and a kitchen counter for quick dine-and-dash meals. I've eaten lunch here solo and with friends 4 times and always left satisfied. Their Tonkotsu, Shio, and Shoyu Ramen broths are all rich and flavorful (the Spicy is my favorite, and my Veg brother loved his Yuzu Shio option), and the bowls come filled with tasty, high quality ingredients. Note that unlike most hipster and Vietnamese Ramen bars (like the excellent Boxer Ramen in Portland, and Pho Ba and Samurai in Seattle), Kukai doesn't serve the heaps of bean sprouts and cilantro Pho eaters will expect. Japanese Ramen is more subtle and nuanced, and doesn't require add-ins. What you order is what you get in the bowl. Their Spinach Goma-Ae is some of the best I've eaten. Chicken Karaage is crisp and hot. And the Warm Cabbage is a delightful appetizer.   \\n    \\nCons: The place has been packed since it opened (okay maybe that's really a 'pro' since it shows how much the local Japanese / Asian / and Portland community in general like Kukai?). Singles and parties of 2-3 can expect a short wait with counter service (5-15 minutes). But larger parties wanting tables can wait an hour or more to be seated. Note that some reviewers have complained about the wait times. Get over yourselves. The restaurant is nearly always packed to the gills, servers and chefs work their tails off non-stop from open to close, and the food is really good. This ain't a 500 seat Cheesecake Factory that can instantly accommodate your every seating whim, but I've watched the Manager and her staff try their best. So how about giving them a break? Kukai has become one of my favorite restaurants in Beaverton and Portland, and my family  and friends agree.

It's certainly upscale and offers a very nice view over the Commons if you're lucky enough to have a table by the windows. The crowd here has also been around for a while, mainly 50 plus on the night we were here.Judging by the food alone, I probably could have given a 4 star. Let me start with that first.SEARED FOIE GRAS: The foie was perfectly cooked and paired really nicely with the creamy sweet potato and the tart cranberry gastrique. The pain au lait was also excellent and super buttery. But my issue here is that for the $23 they charge, the portion was not very big, especially compared to the 2 large pieces of pain given. How was I suppose to divide the foie among those?YELLOWFIN TUNA TARTARE: Interesting presentation with the tartare in a circle with avocado puree and shortbread crumbs in the middle. Nice mixture of flavors and textures here.DUCK BREAST: The duck meat was nicely rendered and quite tender. While I didn't care for the charred skinny little carrots or fennel that much, no major complaints here. I enjoyed the blood orange reduction that brightened the usual fattier duck.SIRLOIN STEAK: Pretty average piece of meat here. We asked for rare, came out medium rare. The vidalia beignet was interesting but probably not superior to regular old potato sides.Ok now the service is really where we had most of the issues.\\n- First, we came (this was a while ago) during restaurant week. I looked online and it restaurant week website said they offered the menu on Saturday's. To be sure, I even called the restaurant ahead of time and asked and the girl that picked up the phone said yes. But alas, when we come for our meal on Saturday evening, no DineOut Boston menu...\\n- Our waiter was slow and frankly somewhat incompetent. A guest ordered whiskey, neat. He came back few minutes later asking whether he wanted it on the rocks. Taking food orders was also not the best. \\n- Very little flexibility in the menu and kitchen. Not everyone wanted to do the tasting menu but 1 guest asked if they could do a dish from that menu as an a la carte appetizer. No go. No 9 Park, for example and a much better place IMO, lets you pick and choose from any part of the menu.\\n- Service was just also slow, the meal took quite a while and sometimes difficult to track down people.So overall, while most of the food was pleasant, I thought was fairly expensive for the portion size.

Their food is great!As a customer who makes a request which has been fulfilled before (for example - un-breaded boneless wings) is told that it CANNOT be done and I may be confused is an absolute insult to my intelligence. I ordered un-breaded boneless wings a few days ago and was given my order without no hassel and was very pleased that I could get it the way I intended to order... and they were amazing!! So to my shock and disgust today I called again to order those yummy wings again was told that there was no way I could have order un-breaded wings before and may have been confused with the wings with the bones, perplexed with the response, I simply told the man on the line that I ordered them previously without a hassle and they were absolutely boneless because I do not eat food off the bone so there was no confusion at all, so the 1st attempt was he made an attempt to see if it can be done and then placed me on hold & the few minutes he had me on hold must have completely forgot about me that he answered the line like I was a new caller - Long story short he was adamant that they cannot un-bread the boneless wings and that they can try to un-bread them as much as possible. \\nYEAH NOT SO MUCH! They came completely breaded and did not take into consideration in to my request.

For $15.50 for 6 wings, I expected plump wings, but some wings were a lot smaller than the rest. Although very flavorful, it was also extremely salty - probably due to all the fish sauce they put on it, but it got me drinking water all night. The saltiness of the wings were really overwhelming, and I feel like I've experienced a better balance of flavor in fish sauce wings elsewhere. The menu is quite extensive and just a huge page of words. At least it's extremely descriptive, so take your time and review what you'd like to eat!

The atmosphere is really cool. I like how the restaurant is made up of somewhat disjoint seating areas each with a different feel. This setup kind of fits with the cuisine of thai street food.  We waited outside for a bit, but they had heaters and we were able to have a beer while we waited so it was no big deal. If waiting for a table at a good restaurant upsets you than this isn't your thing. Go with a relaxed mood and you'll have a great time. We sat inside where it has a kind of dark bar atmosphere. We tried a few dishes: the chicken wings, an herb salad, the boar collar and noodles cooked in a clay pot with pork belly and prawns. We loved the food overall. The wings are great and really addicting. The boar collar was spicy, but the flavors were spot on.  The noodles with pork belly and prawns were my favorite, an amazing combination of flavors. I wish we could have tried everything on the menu. The menu offers some dishes that are a tiny different. This is a restaurant that is well-suited to \\"foodies\\" that get excited about eating boar collar rather than turned off by it. If you want to try something different with different flavors this is a great place. Some others described pok pok as fusion that was different from most other thai places. I have to disagree with this. I don't think this is fusion. Keep in mind that there isn't a single type of authentic or close to authentic thai food. If anything I think the food here is more authentic than most thai places offering curry with a choice of meat type. I'd love to go back here, especially with a semi large group to try several dishes."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing food and service.

They have the best Everything Bagel I have ever tasted.  The problem is, their service is ABSOLUTELY terrible.  They always screw up your order, and it's not just me that thinks this.  When Spinelli's comes up in random conversation with people, the first thing out of their mouth is how they always screw it up.  And they screw up even the simplest of orders (A toasted bagel with cream cheese should qualify as a seemingly harmless order to process).  On multiple occasions I have gone out to grab a few bagels with cream cheese for my friends and come home to find that they forgot the cream cheese.  The thing that blows my mind is how frequently they screw up your order.  Now, you are probably reading this saying to yourself  \\"there is no way they screw up orders this often\\".  But you would be mistaken.  Of the last 9 times I have been they have, unofficially of course, screwed up the order 7-8 times.  Just this morning I went in to get a few bagels for the people I work with and a tub of CC.  There was one other person in the store behind me in line who ordered one bagel with cream cheese.  I watched as they put my bagels in the bag and came to the counter and yelled \\"Eric!!!\\"  Eric took the bag with a befuddled look and said \\"I don't think i ordered this many items\\".  Of course I quickly corrected him.And it is not just the order mix ups.  Its the lack of products they have to sell.  When your main attraction is bagels, you should have more than 3 or 4 varieties available at 8:30 am.  They consistently run out of many types of bagels and it seems they don't care.  A few weeks ago I went in to get a couple Everythings (Definitely their most popular bagel judging by the size of the bin used to house them) and they said they were out.  At 9am.  On Saturday.  When I asked if they had any more cooking they looked at me kind of odd and said no.  Don't get me wrong.  The people are usually friendly and the Everything bagels are amazing.  But the management, or lack thereof, is atrocious.  I honestly do not know how they opened a new spot in downtown because the vic village spot has so many flaws.  But I guess the highest compliment you can give a restaurant is coming back time and time again because you love the product so much, even though more than half the time you don't get what you want."},{"name":"Life Alive","address":"765 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"This place truly is an exceptional find.

One of the sashimi dishes (tuna and mango) had great flavor while the other was average (king salmon).

I came via some recommendations and glowing Yelp reviews; I love seafood and I love fresh pasta, and I'd almost rather just go to a seafood place and have grilled, fresh seafood, or go to an Italian restaurant for some delicious homemade pasta. This was both seafood and pasta together, but didn't really do it for me.This is nestled amongst all the other restaurants in North End on Hanover St. and the place is tiny - there are probably enough seats for 20, and you'll likely end up eating right next to someone else. Come with a group of 2, and a maximum of 4. Any larger, and you'll never get seated. Be prepared to wait in a line outside. At 8 pm, there were only 2 or 4 people in line outside, and when I came back at 9 pm, there was nobody waiting in line.The fried calamari ($11.75) was good: tender, the breading was great, and we got a side of marinara sauce ($1) to dip it in. I would get this again.For the pasta dishes, these are quite generous. You can probably get away with doing an appetizer and then one pasta dish (the full portion) for 2 people. It's basically served the pan that it's cooked in. You can also get an appetizer sized portion of some of the pastas.Shrimp, scallops & broccoli with white wine sauce & pasta ($25) - I liked this better than the squid ink pasta. They were out of scallops so they substituted it with clams, which were great. But for $25, why were there only 3 pieces of shrimp? The noodles were also fine, but nothing to write home about.Squid Ink Pasta with Aglio Olio ($24) - After everyone's raves about this dish, I expected to love this more than I did. For being homemade noodles, they didn't really taste al dente and/or homemade. The noodles didn't have a ton of flavor to me, and there was a lot of chopped up pieces of garlic and squid, but the dish was a bit oily. I know the sauce was garlic-oil with pieces of squid all mixed in, but it lacked seafood taste to me, and was overpowered by the garlic & oil. I've had better squid ink pasta elsewhere.Overall, not a super expensive meal - the bill came out to $65 for 2 people (excluding tax). It was filling, since the pasta portions were generous, but I'm not sure I'd return here again. I'd go elsewhere if I want pasta, and I'd go elsewhere if I want seafood. Also, it's cash only, so come prepared!"},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great service and outstanding food!

As far as food, I had the 1/2 chicken, the 1/2 duck, and bbq pork. The chicken and duck were cooked perfectly, although I could have used a little more sauce personally. The bbq pork was delicious, and the skin was very crispy with a great sauce on the side.

It's all buffet-only (no ordering from the menu), which was perfectly decent and tasty but it was a little pricey (we had mimosas so I'm not sure the actual cost...with 1 pomegranate mimosa it was $24) and I don't eat a huge amount at once, so it's less of a deal for me.They open at 9 on Sunday, and by 9:30 they had a waiting list. Small conundrum: they can't serve mimosas til 10 on Sunday because of TX alcohol laws (which is weird because I know plenty of Dallas places that do...? Dallas is just shadier? Who knows.), so decide which is more important to you--no waiting or mimosas.Really cute place for sitting out back outside, great gardens.

I prefer it with beef, which is always nice and tender. The chicken was good too, but the meat is still on the bone making it a little harder when sharing with friends.For drinks, the tamarind vinegar drink is my favorite nonalcoholic beverage. So refreshing! The mango alexander is a delicious cocktail that I like to order either at the table or while waiting at the Whiskey Soda Lounge across the street if I'm waiting for a table.

I love all the beer they have on tap but I usually go to Red House when I want to have a brew- not because it is higher quality but because the ambiance is cozier.

There were way too many conflicting flavors in the dish and though it was only described as \\"macaroni\\", I was looking for a satisfying cheese flavor that I never found. I would definitely not order this dish again, but I would visit the restaurant again because the other dishes I sampled from my friends piqued my tastebuds and interest. A couple of other things I enjoyed: the table popcorn and the bread basket. Something (other than the macaroni) that I did not enjoy was the lack of parking.

After being seated in a small booth table which was very spacious and the tables are spaced in a way that enables you to not have to whisper or muffle your convo, I was greeted by my waiter, Max.   Now let me tell you one thing that can truly make or break an experience, and that is the level of customer service by all the staff and more so your waiter.  Although the food was delicious and a bit out of my comfort zone, Max gave recommendations for wine pairings and his favorite menu items that were spot on to what I was seeking.  He knew the menu in total and was the PERFECT balance of giving his input versus being completely non existent.  He is the number one reason for me writing this review.   I just give praise to the delicacies that I was served but the true star of my first dining experience with Soto, was Max.   If every wait staff exercised the same exemplary tactics he issued on a daily basis, the food simply could be subpar and the customer would still leave as a raving fan.   Max, thank you for being an example, I'm sure you have many happy customers in your future! I'll be back to try more, truly on the basis and hopes that Max will serve myself and my guests.

So after trying to clarify what was in the drink, he said they were out of the main liquor so they replaced it with something else. Which they never told us. But he was able to magically come back to the table with that very liquor to add to the drink that was already made incorrectly. He wasn't able and unwilling to tell me what was in the drink he brought to the table so I asked that it please be made correctly with the ingredients listed on the menu. The manager brought the correct fishbowl back and admitted to the mistake. Mike D (the waiter) never came back to our table one time. I had to get up and get the manager after he checked the tables around ours 7 times. After that she said she would take care of our table but did a very poor job.

It is so large that they color code rooms to assist you in locating what you are looking for, they really have to or everyone would just be wandering around. It is really cool that they shelf new and used books together, instead of having a separate used section. This way you can choose to purchase the cheaper used book or pick up the new one right beside it. I was super impressed with their birding and nature sections in general, they were both very extensive. I was hoping for more material on sea turtles, but I know that there isn't much to begin with, but still a little disappointed in that area. They also have a pretty awesome board game section in the Sci-Fi area that was pretty fun to explore.We ended up buying a couple things, because you really have to.

I had just landed, was starving, and did a search on Yelp for \\"Austin's Top Restaurants\\" in the car leaving the airport. The reviews were interesting, and I love comfort food; so figured we'd give it a try. We arrived around 10 minutes to 8pm (rush time for dinner), and saw a hostess taking names for the wait list which I wasn't ecstatic about. I can be a \\"hangry\\" girl at times and when I'm hungry, I'm ready to eat NOW lol...) I thought \\"hey, it's Friday Night... So it's bound to happen. We were told the wait was going to be around one to one and a half hours, and instead of driving around we decided to stay and just grab drink at the bar while we waited. My initial impression on the ambience was nice. There's Dark cherry wood colored paneling, low-lighting, and a \\"home-ish\\" vibe (which I really liked.) The place is much larger than it appears at first, as there are multiple bars and different areas. We walked to the first bar which is right in front of the main entrance, but it was a bit cramped and crowded so we walked to one of the back areas; there was a cute little fire-pit area outside on the way to the other bar, and a nice crowd of people waiting for tables. This bar was even more crowded, (but not overtly so) and we waited patiently for about 10 minutes for one of the two bartenders to at least acknowledge us. After two people (who walked up after we did) walked up to the side of the bar, and were served before us I decided to do the same instead of getting agitated. The drink menu has a nice list of bourbons, and a few interesting specialty drinks but nothing overwhelmingly impressive. As soon as we walked in I smelled spicy jalape√±o in the air, and sure enough on the menu there was jalape√±o tequila! :-) I LOVE spicy and savory drinks, so I just went for a jalape√±o margarita. It was very yummy, the bartender mixed it well, and it wasn't unreasonably priced (final price was $10 and some change.) Moving on, we went to wait outside near the fire, and also noticed a room further to the back with rocking chairs and a fireplace (and I'm a southern girl so I loved this simple touch.) To our dismay the area was roped off with a \\"reserved for private party\\" sign.. So our hopes were dashed regarding a comfortable place to sit during our hour wait. Eventually a spot opened up near the fire pit, and we made short and sweet conversation with some of the other patiently waiting guests. \\nI and my bf made a trip or 2 to the front to check-in with the hostesses and, Almost exactly an hour and a half later we were finally seated. All I'm thinking at this point, is \\"God, please let this be worth it!\\"  \\nOnce we were seated we were greeted by our server fairly quickly, where we ordered another drink, and a quick starter salad.  She returned with a tub of popcorn which was pretty cute, and we snacked on that until the salad came.  In the end I ended up ordering the Cowboy Flat Iron steak w/ red beans and rice, and my bf ordered the meatloaf.  Both were yummy, but I was SO surprised at how juicy and flavorful the meatloaf was!  I almost wanted to send my steak back so I could have it as well!

Good fried chicken is a hard thing to directly compare, as there are different legitimate ways to do it, but one thing is common to all of them - fresher is better. I had the half fried chicken dinner. I don't think I've ever had fresher chicken outside of a friend or relative's kitchen. I'm not just talking about fresh out of the fryer, which it was. I mean the herbs in the batter were probably still plants last week. Hints of rosemary and thyme? Definitely some pepper, but not what I would call \\"spicy\\". The batter was applied thoroughly, but with restraint, so that it didn't overpower the meat. The meat was juicy, but it did not leak, and was perfectly cooked. It tasted like it was injection-brined.\\nI had sides, and they were very good, but honestly, as good as the chicken was, they didn't have to be. Go. Eat.

The other items that sounded very good on the menu like their bread pudding, the green chile grits, and the pigs in a blanket were less than stellar.

Maybe they filled up after we left, but we didn't see it?The ambiance here is really nice. I've stared longingly at that lovely fire pit out front on many a day. It was cold and rainy, so we were inside. Nonetheless, I really like the inside. Feels very upscale. They also have these super cool walls made of stacked wood that my friend really liked. We were, however, seated at a very weird both. It was long and narrow--3 of us were seated on one long side and then one on each end. It was not at all conducive to conversation. Beware the weird booth if you want to talk!I had the caesar salad, trout, and buttermilk dessert thing. They were all tasty! I was especially impressed by the dessert given that it's a steak house. Other members of the party also had the shrimp appetizer, the chocolate torte dessert and the lamb. That's right, no steak. Shame on us. All received outstanding reviews. The real standout, however, was the dessert. The service was good until the very end. Their credit card machine broke down, and it took them 45 minutes to figure out a solution (writing down the numbers and e-mailing us receipts the next time). There were no apologies for this or offers to comp dessert next time. I generally expect more out of such a fancy restaurant. Would I go again? Probably not. There are other upscale restaurants that I definitely prefer. Maybe it's because it's a steakhouse (my problem) or maybe because the food was good, but not blow my mind great? Hard to say.

The pancakes were good, I also ordered a mocha that was brewed from stumptown beans, it was good, but a little too much with the chocolate chip pancake and the mixture of different syrups that I pored over them.My friends order took a bit longer, excluding my chicken fried bacon. but when it eventually came my friend was happy with his meal and actually, for a big guy, could not eat all of it, big portions here. My chicken fried bacon sounds more epic then it really was. It was like eatting a coconut pron, but bacon, a sweet batter, and even though it's about 4 dollars for two pieces of bacon , it was well enough, the bacon was thick but the batter did not have any flavor and just made it more filling, maybe they should fry it a bit longer. But I would try it again, but not too many, it's not worth the heart attack over. The decor is cool, with pop art of pancakes and of the waiters.

Stopped by after a visit to Universal Studios. While in the salad bar line, a woman behind us was coughing horribly and then handed the ladles and began serving herself.  I immediately began to imagine how many people throughout the day had done the same thing and almost lost my appetite, but was so hungry, I tried to block it out of my mind.We then paid for our meals and were hit with $52 tab for a family of 4 (2 adults, 2 teens). This did not include any beverages.  In hindsight and after experiencing the food availability at this location, it was an extremely overpriced meal. We could have eaten at a decent steakhouse for that amount.  Food selection at the hot bar was very scarce.  Then, when I began eating my Broccoli Madness Salad, there were hard granules in my food which did not belong there.  Then it seemed as if the same exact thing was in my bacon bits that I used for my baked potato.  The spaghetti Alfredo tasted dried out and very bland.Lastly, when we were getting ready to leave, I placed $3 on the table for the bus boys who had intermittently took away our plates.  My wife speaks fluent Spanish and overheard them complaining in Spanish about our tip on the table before we had even gotten up from our seats.  They did not get us any water or serve us our food, so I'm not sure how much they were expecting to receive from simply clearing away our plates and trays.Bottom line it was not a pleasant experience and we will never go back to Sweet Tomatoes again, either at this location or any other."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Only had their famous chicken wings, for someone who likes salty food... the wings are way too salty.

The prices are a little high, but the more people you go with, you're bound to drive down the prices by splitting.The thai-tea was really good, they have their own manufacturer, I believe. Their Viet-coffee was pretty good too, but you don't get much of it.Jasmine & sticky rice are not included with the items and are sold separately as a side. The side isn't too big, and average about $3 each. One side = one bowl of rice.The fish sauce wings are the best! The flavor is just on-point and the little kick of spice is amazing. Recommended.We also got this claypot, jumbo-shrimp, noodle dish and it was good. The proteins were lacking, and for almost $18, I kinda wanted a little more for what I was paying. It does come with a side of green cilantro hot sauce to dip the proteins in, and I used it for everything else as well. Really great flavor.The papaya salad was good, but not spicy enough. Should've splurged for the spicier version, but who knew? Now you do. The portion was pretty small for $9. Also got a minced pork \\"salad\\" which others liked, but I personally didn't care for. I did, however, like the chicken satay with a little piece of pork belly on the end. The bread they gave with it was really good too. Overall, I think this place is pretty solid and the taste is really good. It's not the best Thai food I've ever had, but it's pretty darn good. The only downfalls I would say are the sides being $3. If i'm paying nearly $15-20 for each main dish, I would assume that they could give a free bowl of rice per entree. Rice is pretty cheap. I understand charging for sticky rice. If they could also drive down their prices, it would be nice. The portions are not too big and having the ability to try more things without breaking the bank would make this place a 5-star!"},{"name":"An Tain","address":"31 India St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Fun bar for a night out in that area.

Unlike some other places that only offer a few options based on the day, you have a wide range of different broth, noodle, meat, topping options to make your dream bowl a reality. Sides like the pork belly bun are delicious as well, but here the main attraction is the ramen. Chicken based broth is perfect for a lighter but still satisfying meal and the classic tonkotsu is a solid bowl. Broth is rich but not too salty and was one of the few I've had that I could actually finish. Noodles are chewy and the toppings were standard but tasty. Overall, no surprises or special additions with the bowls. Just plain delicious.Another interesting experience was the sake flight. A broad range of sharp, milky, and even cedar tastes were represented and while I never drink sake on its own, paired with the ramen it brought out some new flavors I haven't noticed before!

We had the calamari appetizer, good if maybe just a touch too greasy. My wife had the buffalo meatloaf which was even better than it sounded. I'm used to meatloaf being a heavy meal but the giant slab of meatloaf that came drenched in an excellent dark brown mushroom gravy was surprisingly light. I had the salmon, which was fairly standard as salmon goes but the horseradish crust was actual shredded horseradish rather than some kind of horseradish sauce. Again, it wasn't what I was expecting and surprisingly good. We had the fudge stout brownie for dessert. It was warm enough to shed wisps of steam next to the scoop of ice cream atop it and plenty big enough for the both of us to share.The first ten minutes of my visit wasn't anything to write home about, but the food and the service during the rest of dinner was well worth the modest menu prices.

My twin and I split an order of fried calamari and an order of Spinach Artichoke dip (they call it fondue, but it's really dip), and the portion of calamari was HUGE, and the dip was the perfect consistency with a layer of cheese melted on top to seal in the deliciousness.  I got to try some of her mint julep, and, wow, it was one of the best ones I've had, again, perfect strength, yet still a good mix of flavors with the mint and the bourbon.

Server came back to inform us that it would be out shortly.  Another 20 min passes when he comes back to say there was an error in the kitchen and that it was NOW being fired up.  One line of an insincere and all too casual, \\"I'm so sorry\\".  No offer of discount, can we get you something on the house, we'll take that off your bill.\\nMind you, I've been to this restaurant several times already in the past 6 months and this was the 3rd incidence of such \\"kitchen error\\" happening.  I left the table, while still waiting for the food to arrive and asked to speak with a manager.  Two staff members who look to be about 21 yrs. old fumbled around, one profusely apologizing but really coming across as sincere and another started calling someone.  Apparently, there's no manager on site and not even a stand-in mgr to oversee the shift.  WHAT?!?!?!  \\nThis place is run by young adults who hold the job because they need the $ but don't really care about the reputation of the restaurant or the long term damages of such an awful experience by one party that leads to bad reviews. I had to wait another 10 minutes standing at the reception area to speak to someone but no one was around to hear me out.  This alone speaks volume - there's no one there to address any issues a customer might have.  The kid who looked like he just graduated high school came back to tell me he spoke with someone and handed over a $20 gift card.  We used it this night, knowing I will never come back.  While I enjoy their food tremendously, the unreliable, inconsistent, and unprofessional service that accompanies this establishment will make me heed warnings to all my friends/family.

I was in the mood for a sandwich and some soup and saw that this place had daily lunch specials for under $7, one of which was a half sandwich and soup.  I sat down at the bar in the back after seeing that they had a couple of good local beers on tap and thought it might be a good place to grab a bite to eat before going to my gate.  My mistake!  The server (a girl named Kristi) was so incompetent, I realized why there were only 2 other diners here while the other places were busy.First, it took the server several minutes to notice me even though there was barely anyone else there (if you don't feel like working, don't come in to work or find another job that you enjoy).  Ordering my beer was okay but when I tried to order the sandwich/soup combo I was told that they didn't have any soup that day.  Strange but okay.  So after a while I decided to just order a slice of pizza.  No problem you say----especially since the pizza is already prepared and in full view at the front of the restaurant.  Well, several minutes pass by, with several servers walking by me but still no pizza (and no sign of my server).  As I'm almost finished my beer, my server walks by me, starts to walk away and then realizes that I had ordered a slice of pizza but had never put in the order!

Later that night, we looked at my husband's photo of the receipt (yes, he does this. Sometimes it's annoying but it was a good idea in this case).  Turns out the waiter showed us the receipt from another table, not ours! Ours *was* $55.This is a 'cash only' establishment so you don't get a paper receipt.

We got two bottles to share between the seven of us: a Portuguese and a Cotes du Rhone, both of which were pretty good and cost around $25 (which seems ridiculously cheap to me).The food could be called new American, and wasn't pretty good though not very impressive. We ordered the fried calamari (yummy) and the cheese fries (I did not try these) as appetizers, after which I got the seared ahi tuna for my entre.

After a few bites, I was not impressed. The wings were way too salty. As a Vietnamese person whose culture uses fish sauce to flavor most food, I can confidently say that not everything using fish sauce has to be super salty. The wings were overpowered with flavor and not in a good way. I think we had to get our water refilled 3 times over the course of a 45 minute lunch because of the saltiness. The khao soi curry noodles were also mediocre. It is described as mild, but the dish was underwhelming. Given how many herbs and spices go into Southeast Asian food, you'd think the curry would be more exciting but this was fairly plain.

Ahh it was not what I was expecting. A gourmet take on a cupcake I guess. The cake was good, moist from sitting under all the frosting, then the frosting wasn't bad, more like a dense chocolate mouse piped up the sides of the wrapper and over the top. Very rich.

On a Saturday afternoon, it gets old fast if you are dining in. After about 10 minutes I found myself mumbling under my breath \\"Oh shut up!\\".  They only had one register open, on a Saturday afternoon mind you, with a line practically to the door.  It took a long time to get our food and I was blown away by how long some people were waiting just to get to the register.  Actually I'm thinking there may have only been one register in the place (someone correct me if I'm wrong on that one).  \\nIt does have a Coke Freestyle machine, which we had heard so much about.  It was pretty cool but proved to be yet ANOTHER bottleneck in the restaurant.  They only had one Coke Freestyle machine and that is where everyone gets their drink.  So the line from the regsiter is running a couple of different ways through Firehouse Subs and then you have another line of people waiting to get their drink.  These are probably not issues on a slower day - not good though at a busy time.  OH!  Almost forgot, if you have more than four people in your party, I would recommend finding another place to eat as there are only tables for four.  \\nI had the Beef Brisket and thought it was good.

Ike's Vietnamese fish sauce wings: (4/5)\\nIt was very flavorful and definitely something you don't see anywhere else but it was a bit on the saltier side so I would recommend getting either a salad or rice on the side to counter it. The chicken itself was very crispy and juicy. The pickled vegetables on the side was a good addition to add freshness to the dish. Khao Phot Ping: (4/5)\\nIt was a grilled corn dish on their specials menu with coconut cream and lime. It was good overall but I wish there was better charing on all sides of the corn and that the coconut cream had more body. Yam Makheua Thet: (4/5)\\nThis was a tomato salad on their specials menu with fish sauce and Hmong chilies. The tomatoes were very fresh and sweet and the chili gave it a good hit of spiciness. I would definitely recommend getting this to share. Overall, this was a really good place to try in Portland but the service was a bit slow, although pleasant. They did forget to bring out our complimentary peanuts and took awhile to place our order, but I would recommend checking this place out."},{"name":"Korea House Restaurant","address":"1155 W State Rd 434","city":"Longwood","stars":"4.5","text":"Best Korean in the Orlando area, hands down.Korea house has been a staple in my dining out selection since I moved to Florida 15 years ago.  I moved here from Hawaii and Korean food was a large part of my childhood.  It's nice to find a place that serves up authentic and DELICIOUS Korean food. My favorites are the beef bulgogi, chapche, and the stir fried kimchi with pork and tofu.  All of the side dishes are great.  Another fun thing to do for a date is to sit at one of the 4 tables with a built-in grill and have the servers bring out raw meat for you to cook yourself.  Its like fondue, but actually good.  Note: Cheese fondue is delicious.  Boiled meat at melting pot is not worth $40.Anyway, if you like Korean food, or if you've never had it and are in the mood to have your mind blown, give this place a shot."},{"name":"Rudy's \\"Country Store\\" and Bar-B-Q","address":"11570 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I am originally from Austin, and every time I go back, one of the first three things I do is go to Rudy's and stuff my face with brisket, ribs, sausage,  and potato salad, and usually a whole loaf of bread a half a bottle of sauce between me and my friend.

Dinners, celebrations, brunches and lunches have all been had here. The food has always been excellent. I am fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to sample almost all items on the dinner menu. Nothing disappoints. Island Creek treats us as frequent patrons should be treated and it is freaking awesome. I want to give this restaurant an immediate five star rating but I've had mixed service. I don't want to delve deeply into the subject but it must be mentioned. Only on a few occasions I've experienced a few hiccups. The food is stellar and the cocktails are wild, delicious and crafty. If you are an oyster aficionado you need to leave your home right now and make moves over to Island Creek. I don't stray too far from what I love. You can't go wrong with the Faroe island tartare or a crispy oyster slider to start. I usually move into a seasonal salad after oysters and an appetizer. Now for the cr√®me of the cr√®me the entr√©es, do you go for something from the land or the sea? The scallops are boss. Dear Mrs. Bennett if you are out there somewhere reading this please let it be known you have a cult devoted to the worship of your seafood casserole! The steak is also a chunk of burning love. If you do go with some sides, get an order of the crimini shrooms or the brussels with bacon. I could break down the food into tastes and smells and so on but I wouldn't be doing the food any justice. The menu does change monthly but the casserole will never go away. I don't have the words to describe the pleasure Island Creek brings to my belly. Sorry for sounding like a nut bag, but this place will do that to you.  I recommend if you are going in on the weekend to call for a reservation. They tend to fill up quick. If you are not in the mood for an all-out sit down meal, the bar looks more the adequate for an enjoyable evening and as mentioned above they do mix some fantastic drinks.  Before I forget, the place is beautiful...there are oyster shells lining the back wall! Get there."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Perfection.  That is Powell's in one word.

Our reservations were accepted with friendly smiles, coats were checked, and our buns were in the barstools! (Note, the bar does reserve its seats, so be aware its not all seat-yourself) \\nThe cocktail list intriguing and distinguished. Island Creek has set the bar high for the classic cocktail comeback. Our beverages were handcrafted with care, and went down nicely, just like the dozen oysters were ordered. Crisp, cold, and shucked right in front of us.\\nOur other snacks included fried oyster sliders ( A MUST!!!) fluke crudo (delicious!) and sea bass ceviche with blood orange (perfectly done). We finished the meal with the whole cripsy fried black bass, over pearl pasta with kalamatas, artichokes, and piquillo peppers. This dish was amazing! The food was not only prepared perfectly, but the atmosphere in which everything was delivered was phenomenal. Even as we watched the entire bar and restaurant become filled with guests, the whole staff moved about smoothly and professionally. \\nIsland Creek is a definite must-try for any food lover, especially if you love fresh seafood.

The waitress we had was very affable and knowledgable about the food. The only thing that I found a bit weird is that staff seemed pretty stressed out, even though the restaurant was not yet full on a weeknight, and certain staffers walking around with headsets on seemed a bit much for an establishment of this size and laidback-ness (I mean you are serving chicken at picnic tables in a hut, not trying to catch Jason Bourne).

Unfortunately for us, take-out reduced the quality of some of our foods as only the wings survived the journey to our place. The other goods though flavorly yummy  were tainted with sogginess.Lessons learned from this tale of woe include: make a reservation or come couple hours before closing, make a reservation or be patient and anticipate the long sit-down wait and if you don't make a reservation, keep in mind only the wings can handle take-out.

While visiting Orlando, my best friend took me here because I had studied abroad in Spain and couldn't stop talking about tapas when I came home.  She had been considering hosting her wedding reception here and wanted to show me a fun night out.Well, as a 2-month student who dined her way through southern cities in Spain (and that's all the expertise I claim)  this place brought together several elements of Spanish dining into a fun and festive tapas restaurant, and brought it up a notch.  There were the dark wood furnishings and bright Moorish tiles of fine establishments, and the cured meats hanging from the ceiling of the casual pub/bars, along with the staple small-plate and restaurant favorites of sprawling street cafes and corner tapas bars.  Together with a well-crafted pitcher of sangria (in a hand-crafted and colorful ceramic pitcher), this made my night for my one night out with an old friend.I loved that they had turned simple dishes into gourmet small plates, like the tomato-garlic bread.  I had eaten as just garlic clove and tomato cut and smeared onto a baguette, but this was a tomato-herb puree topping a garlic-oil puree on a crostini.I loved the Spanish menu (took me back!): the wild mushrooms in a sherry cream sauce over goat cheese crostini, the chicken with garlic and oil (way more exciting than it sounds),  and the patatas bravas.If I had to briefly describe the food here, it would be:  rich, authentic, and gourmet.Get down here for a fun European experience!"},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"My mom heard about this place on a Food Network show so when we went to Portland for a visit we had to go!

They were juicy and sticky and crispy and sweet and spicy all at the same time. Quite possibly the best wings I've ever eaten. We got the spicy ones and they weren't burn-your-mouth hot, they were just right.Because I know I was overwhelmed by the menu, this is what we ordered:\\nKaeng Hung Leh (pork belly/shoulder curry stew): Comfort food heaven. My favorite dish of the night.\\nKhanom Jiin Sao Naam (cold noodles with mango, pineapple, coconut milk): Perfect complement to the hearty stew, and one of the best Thai noodle dishes I've ever tasted.\\nHoi Thawt (crepe with egg and mussels): Probably the least exciting dish of the three...still delicious, but just short of orgasmic.We shared everything between three people and it was more than enough food. With two (also great) drinks, the total came to under $80. Pretty affordable for a place that is practically a landmark in Portland.It seems like a lot of people think they're \\"above\\" Pok Pok.

The waitress was very attentive and allowed us to take our time looking through the menu. The menu was formatted really weirdly and kind of confusing. My friends and I ordered a variety of oysters. They have a really large selection which is great. I tried the Island creek, warrens cove, malabar, crowed pasture, sippican. My favorite was the malabar oysters. Then I got the smoked salmon pate to share with my boyfriend. The portions were rather small and the smoked salmon was nothing special. The bread was a bit to oily for my liking. My other friends also tried a variety of oysters and seemed to like it. One of my friends ordered the Halibut Caviche but was disappointed, the halibut tasted weird and he wasn't a fan of the overly vinegar-y taste. Overall, the prices were on the expensive side but the oysters were definitely worth it since they seemed very fresh and there was such a large variety.

Java Monkey is another one of those combo coffee/beer/wine establishments that I like, many of which count late hours and a wide, quality drink selections as two major virtues over a traditional coffee shop.  Here at Java Monkey they seem to take the wine and beer side of business seriously enough, offering tasting events and impressive selection of beers on tap (maybe they grabbed a \\"consultant\\" over from Brick Store a block away).  The coffee itself--fair trade or not--is decent, not superlative.  This place has a unique patio which I thought is better than most.  It's structured to be almost a little courtyard outside the wine bar, has an intimate community feel and no view of big ugly parking lot (a problem with many Atlanta patios).  There is a small stage for performances and good sized no-table seating for audience.  Performance seems frequent and well attended.  It might be a little annoying if you want quiet, but in my experience volume is muted considerably when you are inside.  Overall atmosphere...more bohemian than a lot of the other famous coffee shops out there, both the customers and the ambiance.  I guess like a shabby Cafe Intermezzo.  It could be very charming or too hippie for you, depending on what you like.  Props for the presence of a big events board for the community.  Haven't tried the food yet.

A little disappointing thing about this place is though there are quite some dessert items, none of them stand out in particular.
