After going to the Ohio State game we were driving around in an Uber trying to find something different. BW's was not our first, second, third, or forth choice, they were the only one we could walk in and get a seat immediately.\\n\\nI am going to give this visit a strong three and I say that as someone that has given most locations a one or a two so I was happy with my food and the service. I go back to the Weck days on campus in the late 80's when I became addicted, loved them more than my mom in the 90's, had no issues and saw them as a girlfriend in the 00's, and has come to see them this decade as visiting my ex. I just have a hard time giving them a four or a five and will explain why.\\n\\nA positive and a negative, as stated we were able to get seated right away and that never use to be the case at BW's. One reason why may be that while the pictures on the wall have been rotated out to reflect the last two decades of Ohio Sports team accomplishments and stars, very little has changed at this location since they moved in. I say that as a long time customer of their first location in the Bethel Centre complex, they use to be where the Halftime Tavern is. I lived in Olentangy Commons and that part of Columbus for years. I made at least 600 trips here from the 90's to 2010, maybe five since. While this location is great for nostalgia, the lack of change was certainly noticed and may be one reason why we were able to get a seat right away.\\n\\nOur waitress was A plus; friendly, attentive, and always hustling. We got drinks fast, refills when needed (she was keeping tabs while waiting on others), and our table cleared fast when we finished a couple of orders. The food was fresh and the wait was not long. If someone reads this, please, please, please bring back the sriracha bbq sauce that your sauce labs did. That was my pay back for taking away my Weck and you changing your name and then you took the sriracha away and didn't give me back my Weck.\\n\\nI do think BW's has priced itself out of the value they use to have. I get paying more when it is a new place, busy, better food, more choices, and drinks; but when you are just maintaing the status quo and upping the ante I have a hard time with how much I use to love you. This location has made millions and millions over the years, give it the TLC and attention it deserves and it will give back to you twice over. \\n\\nI had a good experience this trip and will come back to this location again.

I could've passed on the mussels and calamari and sweet potato (which could've been better with a spicy or cinnamon-y dip, not just sour cream). I decided to take the plunge and have dessert, and I'm so grateful for the decision.  I had strawberries and blueberries on a mini shortcake biscuit with what I assume to be fresh whipped cream, and then took a sliver of flourless chocolate cake just to try it.  AMEN for just trying.

Maybe an old bitter family dispute is the reason why she will live and die by herself, a simple feud over a broken family heirloom. Perhaps she fled home for a forbidden star-crossed lover, choosing 20th century romance over family ties which ended when a ship called Titantic sank. This lavender lady might be the final surviving heiress of a Scottish lordship, to end forever when her chest sighs for the last time.

You are allowed to choose one appetizer as well as two entrees from fifteen different entree options all for $20.  I allowed Gster to select the appetizer, he chose the fried cheese.  For the entrees we both chose the chicken fajitas.  The fried cheese was nothing to rave about, most likely frozen and reheated.  The fajitas were decent and came out sizzling hot as always.  Gster had \\"portion control\\" problems with his fajitas (he didn't evenly distribute the amount of fajita fillings to his three tortillas).  I didn't experience similiar problems.  We also ate dessert.  We shared Dub's all time favorite, chocolate molten lava cake topped with vanilla ice cream.  It was stellar.  \\n\\nGster and I will most likely be back.  With Chili's you typically know what to expect.

As I had mentioned earlier I allowed Gster to pick the appetizer.  He chose the fried cheese. When the fried cheese came out he made a puzzled look on his face.

Any time you give me spinach, garlic, and feta, I'll probably end up doing panda cartwheels.\\n\\nOccasionally, Herb will have a vegan sauce using tofu and nutritional yeast, among other ingredients.

The market itself is mobility friendly for people who have canes, walkers, etc.\\n\\nThe food is not cheap, but, what we had was great. The half schweinsaxe (pork knuckle) was a decent value at $12. The jagerschnitzel was $17. Spaetzle with mushroom gravy was $10 for a small size. The gluhwein was delicious and I enjoyed being able to walk around with it. Was it worth $8.50? On that cold and drizzly day it was. At these prices, you could dine at Vancouver Alpen Club from real plates, be served your food and stay much warmer. We appreciated the heated tent where you could sit down to eat, though. \\n\\nI bought a couple of Christmas decorations. Many offered there are expensive, but, I buy a new decoration or two every year, so, don't mind splurging a bit.

The place seems more geared towards selling coffee beans and merchandise than being a true coffeeshop.  But that's okay with me, it is clean and doesn't fall into the trap of trying to be more than a place people can go to get a cup of coffee and relax for a while.  The space is big as everyone mentions, and has some cool seating.  They seem to waste a lot of area with the merchandise.  The couches up front go at a premium during peak hours.  The seating in the back has big tables or counters in front of windows that you share with everyone else -- which can lead to meeting new people.  There are a few tables outside.  \\n\\nThe coffee is the best in town.  I don't drink lattes very often, and cannot comment on those.  But cup for cup, the regular coffee stacks up with any I've had anywhere.  If you are interested in buying beans (and you should be) and want to try them out, you can ask them to brew you a single cup in the high-tech Clover coffee maker for a couple of bucks.

This past Saturday, I finally got to indulge for my husband's birthday. Let's break this down:\\n\\nReservation:\\nThe reservation process was simple and convenient, and the website can take reservations up to a month in advance. My husband and I do not eat pork, so I made sure to both note this AND email, just in case.\\n\\nArrival:\\nUpon arrival, the hostesses were lovely and warm, and greeted my husband with a \\"Happy Birthday!\\" He loved this. They showed us to our table, and this is where I had my first issue. I had made reservations for the tasting menu at the Chef's Table, but they seated us in regular dining. I informed them of the mistake, however there were no more spots at the Chef's Table. That was disappointing, I know I reserved it correctly. But I overlooked it, as my husband loved the corner table. They had our menu (no pork, hurrah!) printed for us, with his saying \\"Happy Birthday!\\" at the top. That was lovely. Then we were served a glass of champagne each - not sure if this is normal, as I saw quite a few folks with champagne as well, but I'd like to think we were just special.\\n\\nFood:\\nWe had the tasting menu, and opted for matching drink menu. The food was out of this world. Unbelievable. They may have converted a lifelong mushroom hater. The variance between each course, the flavors, everything was amazing. That ribeye though. WOW. And the drink pairings were absolutely spot on, ranging from white wine to red wine to beer!\\n\\nHowever...nothing is ever truly perfect. I realized this when I found a HAIR IN MY SHRIMP COURSE. A short, presumably male hair. I quickly sent it back and received an apology, but for a restaurant like this, with prices the way they are, that is absolutely unacceptable. I only wish I had taken a picture.\\n\\nService:\\nThe service was outstanding - I wish I remembered my waitresses name. She made each course an experience, explaining everything as we went and detailing every matching drink. She also brought us an extra plate to taste, being my husband's birthday and all. She truly made the night more special.\\n\\nSummary:\\nIn summary, if you can stomach the prices, the food at Barley Swine is out of this world. Just made sure you double confirm your seating location so you aren't burned upon arrival. Also, watch out for hair in your food. Shame, one star docked for each. Luckily, my husband had a wonderful time, regardless."},{"name":"The Cowfish - Atlanta","address":"4400 Ashford Dunwoody Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Amazing. Super fun time.

One of us got the Sabich, which of course only ever comes as a sandwich, but since they have various options here (laffa, bowl, or sandwich), the woman had to redo the order when it was clarified that we did indeed want it as a traditional sandwich. So if a customer just says \\"Sabich\\", then why doesn't the cashier ask \\"laffa, sandwich, or bowl?\\" They just presume that you want the bowl because it's the most expensive? Customer service, please. We also got the salatim bowl.\\n\\nThe sabich was great--nice pita, lots of textures and flavors. Kudos. The salatim bowl, while a really generous portion with a ton of veggies in it, was a bit bland. Most of the items were just hanging out in some vinegar before finding their way to the plate, and the dressings for the salatim themselves lacked vim.

I think you could easily substitute the chips out for a variety of other sides for an additional charge. Just typing this makes my mouth water for another one of those delicious burgers. \\n\\nSo, I have posted a photo before of an amazing burger I had at a food truck trailer parked at the Hops n Grain Brewery on the East side.

They have good burgers here, with good buns. The chili con queso fries are probably the best single item on their menu imo. Great fries with awesome queso dip. \\n\\nThe burger I like to try and compare at every burger joint is simple; bacon cheeseburger. The one at Hopdoddy is okay... probably the worst burger on their menu. It was cooked well, good buns ect. The flavors were just lacking. But most people who come here probably aren't boring and get a basic bacon cheeseburger. Since they are known for their uniquely crafted burgers anyways.\\n\\nLlano poblano is by far the best burger I've had from Hopdoddy. Perfect combination of flavors and the poblano pepper is a great compliment to the juicy patty. Not overpowering at all. The pepperjack, smokey bacon and chipotle mayo are great at giving this burger endless amounts of flavor. Its exceptional no doubt.\\n\\nThe primetime, greek and the goodnight are all decent burgers as well. But nothing spectacular. Nothing I would order again. The best combination would be to order a llano poblano with a side of queso fries. \\n\\nBut why no 4 stars for that combination here? Its overpriced. If you order what equates to a combo at a regular burger joint, it will easily run you $20+ if you tip. Thats absurd for a burger, fries and fountain drink. You can pay half that and get a better burger at Soco Burgers down the street. Or at Dan's 10 minutes away. Look, I get it. Soco location and \\"fresher\\" ingredients = higher cost for the consumer.  \\n\\nAt the end of the day, you are still  paying $20+ for a meal at a burger joint.

We did not know they offer omagase or chef selection of courses...so we picked off the board to start, stuffed squid with sausages, the light sauce is so clean and balance, mopped it all up with the bread they serve with olive oil. Very good grade of oil n our first course was not a disappointment. We split the ravioli stuffed with ricotta, sage n shredded veal. The buttery brown sauce is also light and tasty. The pasta is fresh n not too doughy. For the main, I had the seared haddock n veal sweetbread. I love sweetbread n find that it was a little overcooked as sweetbread suppose to be soft. But the whole presentation of the haddock, sweetbread,  peas with a bright green pea sauce n olive oil is above average in taste. Oh the fingerling potatoes are crispy on the edges n tender inside. My husband had the flat iron steak with arugula salad n shave parmagiana. This dish is not hard to cook and the steak was well charred n well seasoned. For dessert, I was craving for very good gelato so our server told us about Bella gelateria n was indeed one of the best gelato outside Italy.

When you name your business the Crepvine you'd never expect to find out that you cant have the typical breakfast crepes. Yes crepes can be lunch and desert, but breakfast is the creme of the crop.

The amount of creme was to much, it was super thick and felt like it was 80% fo the filling of the crepe (which means a lot of heavy cream). There was only one small row of banana's and one row of strawberries. Also chocolate tossed on top was way to much and seemed overly excessive just to make it look pretty. Why not make a design instead of spreading 5 ounces of chocolate all over the crepe. \\n\\nThe inside of your restaurant is Green; That color tends to follow healthy contentious people and restaurants so if you plan to keep it green then you really should have your employee's ask the customer's how much chocolate they want and give us options to have lower calorie chocolate and cream choices. They didnt even ask us if wanted to have chocolate instead they tossed on top and created the design. I would have had at least 1/4 of the chocolate that was tossed on it. This place needs to follow subway's design and ask the customers what we want on it otherwise you will loose repeat healthy contentious customers. \\n\\nAs for my wife and I.

The second time I was there was with my son's soccer team. I didn't choose it but of course attended. It took us approximately 3 and 1 half hours to order and eat. Last night I went there because I had previously been given gift certificates from Wildside, which was the name of the previous business. Keeping in mind the manager told me that the gift certificates I had been given from wildside was without question to be honored there. I had his name written on a partially used gift certificate. I went to use the other one and the owner came out and said that we aren't wildside and they would not honor the gift certificate that was bought there and the manager told me they of course would honor it  The manager seemed to have more business skills than the owner does. I have a 50:00 gift certificate they refused to honor. The bottom line is BAD SERVICE, BAD MANAGEMENT/ OWNERSHIP AND VERY MEDIOCRE FOOD FOR THE MONEY.

We come to Austin every year and this place will definitely be a regular place we eat at!!!"},{"name":"Bukhara Indian Bistro","address":"3698 Washington St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"3.5","text":"After my two visits to Bukhara in a span of just a couple of days, I was left lingering with one word that could best summarize my experience there: inconsistent. The weird part about this is that this establishment is part of an Indian-inspired dining group, which also owns other finer restaurants like Diva and Mela. Yet somehow, I felt like this place was below the standards, which seem to be applied to the other establishments they own.\\n\\nWhile I can't argue that Bukhara has become a neighborhood staple in Jamaica Plain, since it's been there for a while now, and faces little to no competition in that area of Boston, it somehow seems to sunk into a groove and it almost seems like they've given up on offering a great experience to the customers. Based on the other pictures that are on their Yelp page, I can safely determine that they've tried to renovate and revamp the place a bit, sprucing it up with lighter tones of color making for a warmer experience. On the walls, a few tapestries hang over the customers heads, but the d√©cor doesn't exactly scream Indian restaurant; yet it doesn't have an unpleasant vibe to it. It's not all that noteworthy. \\n\\nHaving been to Diva a few times, I noticed that their menu is near identical. Same drinks, same everything, including their dinner for two deals which offer a significant amount of food (soup, apps, entr√©es, desserts and tea/coffee) for under $45. While my dining companion and I got that deal on our second visit there, on my first visit to Bukhara I settled for a classic and yet hard-to-get-right Murg Tikka Masala (Chicken Tikka Masala). This very popular Punjab dish has become a staple of Indian restaurants - It features a combination of exquisite spices including ginger, cumin, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, paprika and garam masala. The sauce is almost made with a tomato base and there is also a dash of cream that softens the edge that it would have and also prevents the spices from burning during the cooking process. In this case, the chicken was very lean, cut to the perfect and moist. The latter is the most challenging aspect when cooking this dish, which is often served too dry. I was impressed.\\n\\nBut then I took a bite of one of their Naans (Indian bread cooked in a clay oven called a tandoor) and was immediately disappointed. It was way too doughy. Like seriously way too doughy. The flavor was decent but it was a bit too charred and because of its thickness, didn't cook evenly at all. Our appetizers on both visits were decent, but again, far from great. Basically average if you ask me. Some were significantly better than others such as their Mulligatawny soup which I thought was great. It was citrusy, it was light, it was served hot and it was delicious.  Their samosas on the other hand were rather bland, a feat that I found depressing considering that they are supposed to pack of punch when it comes to spices. I also found their Tandoori chicken and Seekh Kebab to be dry. They were well seasoned but came out really dry. In a \\"I need two glasses of water, stat!\\" kind of dry. Not so good. The rice, which came with the entr√©es, was decent and the portions weren't humble either. And my pistachio shake that I ordered along with my meal was both unusual and refreshing. A pleasant surprise.\\n\\nAnother dish that I thought missed the mark, the one that I had last night, as my entr√©e was their Butter Chicken. I've had better butter chicken from Trader Joe's frozen food section and was very disappointed by it. I couldn't taste any cardamom in there and I felt like they put too many peppercorns. It was completely off balance and although the chicken was moist, it just didn't taste right. Maybe they forgot some spices? \\n\\nI think that the worse part of it was the service. No one greeted us at the door, and then the staff was completely disorganized. The place wasn't even all that busy but somehow the staff was completely off the mark when it came to taking our orders, clearing our table and giving us our check at the end of the meal. And this was on both nights. They didn't clean our plates before bringing the next dishes and the tables are small. It made for an awkward, tetris-like moment as we tried to get the stuff onto the table. And do not that there were two waiters taking care of us when this happened. We also were done eating and had to wait twenty-five minutes before they finally acknowledged us and proceeded to get our bill. \\n\\nOverall while the place is decent, with a lot of hit-or-miss, affordable dishes - I was left expecting more from the chef and more from the staff but unfortunately they left me frustrated instead. On the upside they do a few things, which I appreciated as a customer: when you order your entr√©e they ask you what level of heat you want on it. I went for mild and it was a bit too soft and went for hot which was perfect on my second visit. The bathroom downstairs could have been cleaner but street parking was easy to find."},{"name":"Joe's American Bar & Grill","address":"985 Providence Hwy","city":"Dedham","stars":"3","text":"I recently went to Joes's while visiting a friend out of state.

No complaints there what-so-ever. \\n\\nThe only reason for the star loss is the pricing of things. Now, we didn't go here because we thought it would be cheap.

My bf's jaw dropped at the 200 bill after tipping.\\n\\nAgain, the food is great. But probably tell your servers to mention that the seafood specials (more specifically the Seafood Trio) are all priced individually and not as a plate. If i had known it would be $40 for A lobster tail, $14 for two scallops, and $14 for three shrimp...I would have gone after one of the other seafood plates instead. I will say, that the Seafood Trio was AMAZING, I was practically melting in my seat with all the flavors. \\n\\nAs well, a thanks to the people who reviewed that the front entrance was sort of a trap in concerns that you can't find it.

With that said, everyone loved the Salsa's (Roja and Verde).  It was a total of $15 for the large guac and both salsa's.\\n\\nOur group ordered a variety of taco's.  The Baja fish is fried (need to ask this to know) and everything comes out on one plate.   Really need to order on separate tickets to have them served to you individually.   If not, it's a free for all for a group size to figure out your order when it's actually served. Taco size = small.  How many you should order all depends on you and your appetite.

And she wound up pissed off and disappointed and I was super underwhelmed. \\n\\nOur server, Grant, was annoyingly aggressive when it came to trying to get us to order entrees - even when we'd already put in orders for drinks and appetizers that had yet to arrive.  He was snide and condescending when we asked any questions about the menu.  Which didn't make any sense - if you're rushing me to order - and not giving me time to peruse your sizeable menu - then don't get mad when I have questions.  He also brought me the wrong drink.  Honestly -  Grant just seemed like he was 'over us' from the moment we walked in.  I later joked that I felt like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman, \\"I got money to spend in here!\\"  (Dated reference, I know . . . )\\n\\nMy chicken nachos were AWFUL.  The chicken was literally several chunks / blobs of chicken unseasoned chicken breast in random spots on the plate.  Unseasoned as in not brined, no salt, no pepper, no chili powder or spices or seasoning whatsoever - bright white industrial looking chicken.  Add to that the lack of even distribution of ingredients.  One half of the nachos seemed to have a super duper thick layer of refried beans while the other half had no beans at all.  There were sections that had massive amounts of cilantro (which I'm not a fan of) - while other sections had none.  And I know I'm in the minority - but I don't like guacamole - so I usually just avoid or 'eat around' it when there's a scoop of it on an entr√©e I've ordered - but with these nachos - a couple of times - I bit into  chip only to discover that there was guacamole in my bite.  ARGH!  \\n\\nThe nachos were so awful I decided to forego ordering the entr√©e I was considering (Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich). \\n\\nWe opted to talk to a manager - after paying - to avoid the 'oh - she's complaining to get a freebie' - and he was very pleasant, apologetic and kind.

That nets them 2 stars versus 0.  \\n\\nSadly, ultimately - I think Grant 'sized us up' when we walked in the door and assumed that we were going to be a high maintenance, low-tipping table - then treated us accordingly.  I've lived in Cobb for nearly 20 years at this point - so I guess I should be sorta used to it - but MAN! It's irritating when I encounter the 'Vinings attitude' - it's so old fashioned and dated.  You cannot judge a book by its cover.  We left here and walked 'across the way' to Antico and got a little more of the same attitude / treatment.

We were sat in the main restaurant area along with maybe 5 other tables. Our waitress was an older kind of heavier woman, do not have her. She had a table of 6 (already done with their entree), a 4, a 2(with only drinks) and us a new 2. We sat for over 10 minutes and finally my boyfriend had to get the manager. \\n\\nMind my boyfriend and I both work in the service industry downtown and can recognize a busy night/server. We would have be very content if she would have least stopped by and said ill be right with you and maybe offered at least water and chips. This waitress, on the other hand, was slow, gossiping to other co-workers and just drifting through the restaurant doing nothing. \\n\\nSo we got the manager and asked for water and maybe a less busy server. we were then sat in Ben's section, he was ok. He told us he is super tired and could care less about the tables he gets and the service they receive since he \\"had already made his money for the night\\". As a downtown worker, I can make $500 in one night and still want to give great service. We watched the staff the remainder of the night and the manger never checked back in or at least comp something. We then heard our former server talking about a table she had just been given and said, \\"I don't want them, they have been sitting for like 5 minutes, and I don't want them.\\" Wow, so that's they way they run business, if you don't want to serve people then get out of the business. I then later found out that the reason it took 15 for a drink was because the party of 200 had so many it broke. I understand machines fail, but really staff let your guests know so they don't just think you forgot about them. Like I said, we weren't in a hurry. It frankly is a pain to not have working equipment, but as a server getting annoyed to the point where your guests can notice is not a desired dining experience.

The menu is geared toward fancier 'date night' food, but I did get to taste a large plate of fries (enough to share among 3 people) for a really reasonable price.  The fries were good, served with a smoky homemade-ish tomato-based dip.  Decor lacked warmth, but I expect that will improve over time.  Maybe a few tasteful Music posters from local shows would help.  My group asked for a pitcher, and they did not have any.  That needs to change.  Overall....a nice, dim hideout for a date, or waiting for a show at the Doug.  Not cheap, and a little chilly inside, but good, local beer.

That meant  the employees had to describe every item they offered to the customers.  I mean literally every sauce, side, etc was explained. Maybe that's why it took so long? It was ridiculous. When I finally made it through to the end of the line, I  saw there were menus that described their dishes....I seriously wanted to scream.

Things worth noting are their amazing Naan. It is tender with just the right amount of spices, and never dry and chewy like in some of the other places that I have. For appetizers, the samosas are also quite excellent..soft and tender on the inside with just enough crisp. \\n\\nThe key to an excellent main course is to specify EXACTLY how much spice you want. For the Chicken Khadai, I would not ask for a mild taste as it is a creamy base, so unless you add some salt yourself, it might be on the bland side. Regardless, the meat is always cooked the right amount. Chicken Masala (a go-to) is also amazing.\\n\\nFinally for desert, for someone who has never tried a Mango Lassi...please. GET ONE. They are delicious before, during, or after your meal. \\n\\nI will continue going to this place and enjoying their amazing service and delicious meals.

The cashier was really friendly. I had the latte with almond milk. As well, I decided to try the matcha cronut and the cereal milk donut. I was excited because these are two flavours I really like. However, I was a bit disappointed with them. The matcha cronut tasted a bit too oily for me and was reminiscent of a Chinese donut with its oiliness. There was matcha on top, but I felt like it could use more matcha flavour. The cereal milk donut was a good donut, but if I hadn't known what kind it was, I wouldn't say it was cereal milk. There was cereal sprinkled on top, but I was expecting the filling to taste like cereal milk. It just tasted like a regular donut.

The cashier welcomed me to the shop and asked what I wanted to order. There were only around 10 options (menu rotates daily), but I was completely overwhelmed as they all looked delicious. There is a sample of each donut displayed up front, so one can see what a donut looks like. Once you place your order, a pastry chef or 'donut decorator,' makes your donuts. There is clear glass between the waiting area and where the donut decorator is standing, so one can easily watch their donuts being made (yes, allow a few minutes for your order)\\n\\nThe actual donut is pre-made (fresh daily); however, the glaze and toppings are prepared once a donut has been ordered. The ingredients are organic, local and sustainable. We all know a donut is by no means healthy, but it is nice knowing the eggs are from a local farm as well as the other items one will soon digest.\\n\\nI ordered the glazed donut and the Dulce de Leche & Almonds donut and they did not disappoint. The donuts are light-weight and thick, about an inch and a half in height. The breading is brioche like (looks and feels like a sponge), or similar consistency to a loaf of fresh bread.  The breading is fluffy and light, and the glaze on top adds an extra sweetness to the donut. \\n\\nI like the fact that these are not your everyday, typical donut, but they are very, very yummy and will fill you up. While I could eat 2 - 3 donuts at Coco, I felt full after eating a half of both of my donuts (aka, 1 donut in all). If you are looking for a good traditional donut, this is not the place.

Good, solid German food and this is coming from a guy who has spent a lot of time in Germany and other schnitzel eating countries. I have never had or seen Pickle Soup before, in Germany or elsewhere, but they have it here (Cup - $3). It is bright green, looking like radioactive waste, but with a creamy, mild dill flavor that is quite pleasing to the pallet.\\n\\nThey have three german biers on draught, a Pilsner (piss, like Bud, but made in Germany), a Hefeweizen (wheat), and a Schwarz (literally \\"black\\" or dark beer - all 1/2 liter - $5.50). Those are general, descriptive terms for a class of beer, but when I asked specifically what the schwarz beer was, I was simply given the definition. Rather than push the issue, I simply asked the server to bring me one of whatever it was. It was quite good with a rich, caramelly flavor and hints of coffee, whatever it was.\\n\\n\\nMy wife wanted the Rahmschnitzel ($17.50) of course because she always picks the dish on the menu that I want, but I swayed her toward the J√§gerschnitzel ($18) instead. When I try a new German place, I like to sample the staples - schnitzel, wurst, goulash, sp√§tzle, red cabbage, sauerkraut - in order to get a feel for their knoweledge of German cuisine. I ordered the rahmschnitzel, mostly because this was the only place I had seen rahmschnizel on the menu outside of Germany and it happens to be my favorite.\\n\\nThe j√§gerschnitzel was delicious, but the sauce tasted more like a Burgundy than a sauce made with white wine as is normally the case. It was very good despite the French, vice German, flavor with sliced, fresh mushrooms. The rahm sauce was rich and creamy, also with sliced shrooms, but with a reddish/orange tinge, probably a touch of paprika which we also found on the fresh, warm bread rolls (made with white flour - not traditional pumpernickel) that came before and during dinner. Both dinners came with carrots, which I immediately gave to my wife (I love raw carrots, but detest cooked ones), spinach, and sp√§tzle (which I sub'd fried potatoes for). Red cabbage is a more traditional side, but a little red cabbage goes a long way, so this was a nice diversion. \\n\\nThe pork cutlets used for the schnitzel did not seem to be have been dusted in flour prior to searing in the traditional way, but were bountiful, probably 6-8 ounces. My single complaint being the, how do I say it politely (?), \\"durable\\" texture of the pork cutlets. It was not what I would call \\"tough\\", \\"chewy\\" or \\"gristly\\", but it was slightly difficult to cut, even with a knife and definitely not with a fork. Most schnitzels I have had are tender as a whore's heart and could easily be cut with a fork. I am not sure of the cause, possibilities include frozen product, microwaving, having been pre-cooked and stored, none of which are good options, but the issue may need to be addressed. You should not have any difficulty either cutting or chewing your schnitzel. \\n\\nCombatCritic Gives Otto and Anitas' European Restaurant 8 Bombs Out Of 10 ...

What I love about this place is that they have sushi here that doesn't suck, and it's way better than what you'd expect given the price. It's at least as good as the stuff you would buy from HEB, and that's like $9 for a SINGLE ROLL. ALL YOU CAN EAT BABY! So yeah, sushi is a big selling point here. But what's also awesome is that beyond the typical Chinese fare like General Tso's Chicken, lo mein, and what not that you usually see at a buffet, they have Korean BBQ and yellow curry chicken and more! Super excited to see all of this stuff. Attempt to exercise enough self control to fit some ice cream inside you after cause they have one of those soft serve machines too!\\n\\nService was alright here, nothing worth mentioning. I do wish the seating was nicer though, and the lighting (was uneven).

They were rude and dismissive, telling us that we had to get our meals to go because they were closing in 20 minutes. Never been to a restaurant where they try to send you away like that. I was going to get the squash ravioli, and I asked if there was nuts in it (I have an allergy) because, you know, just in case. Apparently there were, and then the cashier asked the kitchen about the other ravioli and apparently they ALL had nuts in them. When does ravioli ever have nuts in it? That is a disaster waiting to happen for anyone with a nut allergy. But I haven't gotten to the worst of it yet. We decided instead to order salads, I got a caprese and my mom got a Cobb salad. They really weren't great, just passable. Later that night though, both of us were throwing up and felt horrible. Pretty sure we got food poisoning from there, it lasted for days and we had fevers too, could barely even drink water. I'm not joking, this actually happened.

You will stand at the door until you wait for someone to come over to ask if you've made reservations.  The restaurant is so small, it can't even fit a host stand. I believe the max capacity would be 32 people, so it's definitely a tiny place.  Seated at the table, I was somewhat squished in because well, obviously, the tables are so close together you don't get much leg room.  It kind of reminded me of Fenway Park.  I would not recommend going here with more than 4 people, since it would seem impossible.  You also must make reservations, otherwise you may be waiting outside for a real long time.  The next problem is that they only serve wine.  \\n\\nFor appetizers we got the arancini and panzerotti.  They give you 2 arancini that are a little bigger than the size of a golf ball.  They were good, but not the best I've ever had.  The panzerotti is a fried potato stuffed cheese thing that is quite good, however it's small in size.  \\n\\nFor entrees I got a special which was scallops over pappardelle pasta in a pesto sauce with walnuts.  This dish was fantastic and I'd definitely recommend it if they offer it.  My friends got the Gnocchi di Spinaci al Rag√∫ di Maiale and the Orecchiette con Gamberi e Rabe. My friend that got the spinach gnocchi said she really liked it and would get it again.  My other friend didn't seem too impressed with the orecchiette. \\n\\nOverall, since I loved my dish, I would definitely come back here again to try other appetizers and entrees.  It just may encourage me to lose a few pounds, so I can squeeze into my seat. LOL ;)   Most places in the North End are tiny, but boy do they maximize space!  For comfort they should consider removing 1 table, but then again they would be losing a lot of cash that way.  The music was great and the look of the place was nice.  The brick walls are filled with eclectic pictures of famous people.

I like that, regardless the experience. So this time he had three different ideas, one of them being Schmidt's Sausage Haus in German Village. When he first mentioned the name I was thinking, \\"Dad, I don't think I want to go to one of your bars...\\" HA! =D \\n\\nAnyway, so we go to check it out. It's kind of at what seems to be a dead end in the road, but not really, and there is one parking lot attached, and another behind the restaurant, plus there is street parking around the building. Lots of parking might lead you to think it's a big restaurant. It's not, though they've crammed as many tables as possible into the place, and there's almost no place to stand for those waiting 20-30 minutes for a table. The majority of the people waiting were outside. I was wondering what they do in the winter... And the waiting area is also where they have their display cases and cash register for people to buy mustard, cheeses, pies, and whatnot to take home. Extremely inconvenient. Luckily I was smart enough to ask for a menu while we waited, with our backs pinned to the wall as people squeezed through back and forth... \\n\\nThere was a bar with 8 stools, but we weren't offered to sit there while we waited, and being that my dad isn't the type to drink before eating, I didn't ask. Just surprised we weren't offered. Especially since beer seems kind of important at such an establishment. \\n\\nPerusing the menu wasn't very exciting. It was like going to the zoo during the winter when none of the animals are out. I guess I expected more from international fare, as I've had interesting foods during Oktoberfest at the company I work for, which is German-owned. \\n\\nI ended up deciding on the Reuben, which a slab of their Bahama Mama sausage is on, which was okay but nothing special like one might think such a specially named sausage might be, and my dad got some chicken dish. I had a side of green beans, which seemed to be made of plastic. My dad had the green beans as well and complained about them to me, which was a sigh of relief because I would never complain to him, but I'll surely agree if I have the chance! =) I don't think he liked the chicken either, because he didn't finish it - and my dad is not the type of guy who doesn't finish anything! =) The meal was so disappointing we didn't even bother with dessert. \\n\\nSo basically, my overall view of this pace, is it's a cheap, low-rent, family diner version of a German restaurant. I would be embarrassed to take any of my colleagues from Munich here. I would be embarrassed to take anyone here. Actually I might do it for a laugh. I think if I picked up a blind date and knew from the giddy-up it wasn't happening, I would take her here. But if you're on a budget and aren't looking for anything special, and don't mind small spaces, by all means, stop in. You will get that for which you pay. The bill for us barely broke $20. They did have a couple women in dirndls, although they weren't exciting either. They must be doing something right though, because they stay packed.

We ordered drinks from the bar prior to sitting down at our table and it took forever, the young man behind the bar my told wife rather caustically that he had to chill a martini glass, I'm sorry but how long does this really take and as its my wife's only drink it appears it take 3 times longer at this restaurant than any other restaurant in Lake Mary, what made it worse was she ordered a second at the table and it actually tasted like someone put vodka in cherry kook-aid, it was so nasty sweet. The appetizer (Spicy Lobster) and Caesar Salad s were good, my wife ordered the filet and I ordered the petite rib eye, both steaks were cooked to perfection but but my wife found a nerve going through the middle and mine was considerable fatty. For $40 steaks, I would hope you would get better quality cuts of meat. As for the service, being Mothers day we granted them some latitude, but our entire evening was 3 hrs, by this time we had no patience to sit for dessert, we simply took them home with us. I hate to say this, but with a Shula's 347 and Fish Bones in the vicinity, they seriously need to reevaluate their entire process from service to food, as many casual diners are going to be heading elsewhere."},{"name":"Tavern in the Square","address":"1815 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"This might be my new favorite place to eat in Porter Square.

I'm a very impatient person when it comes to food.\\n\\nWe were seated in the back room, which was kind of loud because there were a few bigger parties seated back there, but there were also a bunch of TVs, which made it ok.

However, Tavern more than made up for that with the other beers on their list - they have a very nice selection. \\n\\nTavern also has a decent food selection, and their food was awesome!

The pizzas were very very good.  Great crust, first rate ingredients and one of the few places that finally puts ENOUGH CHEESE on.  (My biggest gripe in Austin is not nearly enough cheese on most pizzas) Better than most in town and on a par with the only two or three really good pies we have. Prices were fair, again the smallest pies were larger than one person could eat, but heck, cold pizza in the fridge is always a welcome snack.  The only thing that kept me from giving a full five stars was the utter lack of any atmosphere, tiny tables and uncomfortable chairs, and giving us paper plates to eat the pizza off of.  Clearly they want to emphasize delivery or take out. Which is a shame because the pies are worthy of sit down meals.

I don't think the \\"family style\\" serving is necessary with their menu.\\n\\nOur waiter was friendly, helpful and present whenever we had questions or needed refills. \\n\\nParking is a little wonky at this location -- while there is valet, when I arrived a little before six, there was only one valet working and he was having cars pull up on the sidewalk to get them out of the street because he couldn't park them fast enough. I have only been to this location one time so I can't speak as to whether this is typical, but it was a bit disconcerting to start my visit.

It started with 6 Island Creek Oysters with Yuzu ice, which was interesting. It's like a citrusy slushy topping for the the oysters. Then came the smashed potatoes, which were probably our favorite. Good flavor and had a nice kick. After that was the fried salmon rolls, that was okay. Last course was the Sweet Green Curry with clams and hake, and that was just disappointing. The clams were sandy to the point where a lot of it had settled to the bottom of the bowl of soup, which means we couldn't really eat all of it. The hake was good, but I thought the broth could've used more flavor. Overall the food was okay, but the portions were pretty small for what you're paying for.\\n\\nI did like my drink, though! It was the Pineapple Express- pineapple infused vokda with basil. It was light and refreshing. We also added on Michelle's Affogato for dessert at the end. The only thing I could've done without in that glass was the caramelized espresso or brittle or whatever it was. It was so hard and stuck to our teeth so much that it was just annoying.

Yes, I know it's just food, but barbecue is a whole different level of food, and Terry Black's is a whole 'nother level, simply heavenly.\\n\\nTHE WAIT: In typical historical Texas barbecue restaurant format they have cafeteria style service with red trays w/ butcher paper to serve it on, no plates. The line of 100+ on a chilly Wednesday evening before we served ourselves the first side order was about a 40 minutes long. During that wait time you get to enjoy the smells and sites of the barbecue that just wets your appetite like nobody's business. Everyone that works there was so nice so happy & so kind. True Texas hospitality.\\n\\nTHE BBQ MEAL...\\n\\nMEATS: Beef Rib, Brisket & Pork Rib.\\nWe had a single 1.5 lb beef rib that was simply the most mouthwatering fatty delicious beef we have ever eaten!

The macaroni pasta was the size of your elbow! Creamy cheesy perfectly done. Cream corn was made with heavy cream incredibly rich. The coleslaw with some of the best I've ever had. The big pursue this very rich in super flavorful as well.\\n\\nBEVERAGES: Lone Star & Big Red\\nWe enjoyed a Lonestar beer and a Big Red soda with our meal. That Big Red soda was something else... only 38g of sugar (yikes!), but we enjoyed every gram of it. We looked at the Big Red ingredients and we didn't see anything that gives it it's sweet tasty flavor like strawberry or cherry so if anybody out there knows what the flavor is in a Big Red let us know, ' cause it was something else!\\n\\nDESSERT: Banana Pudding \\nDelicious filled with whip cream & flavor however we would've liked a little bit more banana slices in there other than that super delicious.\\n\\nLEFTOVERS: Thankfully there was lots of leftovers that they gladly wrapped individually for us in butcher paper & aluminum foil to take home to our rig.

There is only one Latin American restaurant...Orinoco. The specialty here is Venezuelan cuisine. It's located in Brookline Village right on Harvard Street, easily accessable to the Green D line and close to several public parking lots. \\nThe menu varies from the traditional arepas and empanadas, to larger plates of grilled meats \\"Churrasco\\" style and a few fish and poultry dishes. For starters, my wife and I shared Datiles, bacon wrapped around dates stuffed with almonds ($6) delicious little mouthfuls of joy. Then we tried two empanadas, the Mechada (shredded seasoned beef) and Verde (wild mushroom). Each order comes with two empanadas and a generous portion of salad ($8). The salad comes dressed with a light vinaigrette and queso blanco.  The pastry was light and flaky and the stuffing was moist and flavorful. For the mains, we had the Mahi Mahi ($19) and Pabellon Criollo ($13.50). The mahi mahi was served with a tomato escabeche and a small portion of spicy rabo encendido. Personally, I liked the rabo garnish best. I wish they served an entree portion of that alone. The Pabellon turns out was the same shredded beef that was in the empanada. It was a little sweet for my taste. I was hoping it would be more savory, like the rabo. However, it was served with generous sides of fried plantains, rice and black beans, that helped to offset the overly sweet beef. \\nThe bar features several types of mojitos and caiparinhas, but that night we decided to share a carafe of red sangria ($20), which was light and refreshing, with a blend of different fruit juices, though I felt a little light on the ethanol content. Cocktails are a bit pricey at $8-9 each. \\nOverall, Orinoco is a great option for authentic Latin flavors in Brookline. One big downside, the dining room is small and they don't take reservations, so get there early or be prepared to wait."},{"name":"Jekyll Island Seafood","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"The place was promising and the food on the tables actually looked OK.

We like the huge private booths for a large group.  They are padded and quiet so that you can actually hear each other speaking. They will not seat you if you do not have your whole party together, so make sure you all get there on your specified time. There is a nice outside seating area, too.

The Caesar salad was delicious. There were slightly sweet pinenuts on top of a delicious bed of romaine with savory dressing and shredded cheese. The basic broth that comes with no extra charge for fun doing was perfectly seasoned. I enjoyed a great variety of vegetables including broccoli, asparagus, mushrooms along with fake meatballs, tofu triangles and pot stickers. There was a large enough quality to fill you up. The star of the evening with the sausage. The blue cheese was especially delicious. I also enjoyed eating the artichokes cold dipped in spicy cocktail sauce.

A pair of foodie friends on yet another culinary adventure. The destination: Myers+Chang. \\n\\nThe decor was fun and innovative (for Boston) with old tea canisters recycled into chopstick/cutlery holders and used Chinese-language newspapers as placemats. There was a kitschy feel whilst still being modern and trendy. The lighting could have been slightly better though; it was quite dark and, although I appreciate mood lighting, it could have been one notch brighter. \\n\\nThe service was very attentive and our waiter was friendly, cute, and did not have to recite the specials from a list; he knew them from memory and was enthusiastic when describing them. A particularly impressive M+C practice that I feel many restaurants could follow (especially on busy weekend nights) is the idea of putting water carafes on the table; they were there for us when we wanted a refill and the waiter kept them replenished when he saw them get low. For people (like myself) who drink a lot of fluids when eating this was a grand service; nothing is worse then dying of thirst and having to wait for someone to bring you water. M+C gets an A+ for this. \\n\\nThis was a first time experience for both me and my friend but I researched ahead and found that half of the dining room is left open for walk-ins so we did not make a reservation. We ended up being sat at the bar which is not a great first impression when I could see open tables however it turned out being fun after the meal started (otherwise we may have not had our cute and friendly waiter whose name escapes me LOL). Also, chef/owner Joanne Chang was visible and obviously engaged in her business (a great sign). \\n\\nNow for the food. Portions could have been bigger. Dim sum portions with higher than dim sum prices (this is \\"SoWa\\", so it can be expected). Also, some things came in 3s (tacos and fritters) or 5s (dumplings) which is hard to split between two food-crazed people. However, the quality and taste made up for this and whilst I had my favourites there was nothing I did not like. \\n\\n*braised pork belly buns ($9): delicious combo of meat and fat with a sweet hoisin and perfectly pickled carrot slice... [A] \\n*sweet potato fritters ($9): fried to perfection without being greasy. The bits of Chinese sausage lent a nice texture to balance the soft potato center. Sriracha aioli was good but did not have much heat to it... [A-] \\n*green papaya slaw ($6): very fresh ingredients and nice heat. This was one of the \\"too-small\\" portions though... [A-] \\n*chinese sesame cucumbers ($4): I'm not a huge cuke fan however this was the surprise of the evening. The sesame added such a wonderful flavour to them that I could have eaten the whole bowl. I want the preparation instructions for this! Madame Chang, you got me to eat my veggies! hehe... [A] \\n*mama chang's pork and chive dumplings ($11): these were tasty and seemed to be handmade however they would be better priced (in my opinion) at $8... [B] \\n*asian-braised short rib soft tacos ($13): this was my favourite dish of the evening. The meat was tender and wonderfully flavoured. The taco shells held together nicely and had a good chewiness to them. There was a nice sweet/spice balance going on and the sour from the \\"add it yourself\\" lime on the side rounded off the whole dish. This is one of those items on a menu that I would go to again and again when returning to a restaurant. Don't pass these up!...

Also, the waitress was slow and inattentive. If the burgers were awesome; those two things wouldn't have bothered me.

They have 1 table inside and 3 picnic tables outside to enjoy some sun.\\n\\nMy main gripe about the food was how the texture and flavour of the food was just very off. The taco plate comes with 2 tacos, refried beans, and spanish rice. I asked for some authentic corn tortillas but they served them to me in flour tortillas. The spanish rice is probably the worst rice I've ever had. Either it had been left out for a bit or microwaved, the texture was terribly off and definitely not fresh. It was also unbelievably bland, almost white rice level of bland with some random tomatoes and veggies thrown in. The beans had the consistency of baby food (really really watery).\\n\\nThe only saving grace of the meal was the meat. It was actually pretty decent! Carne Guisada was pretty juicy and flavorful. The beef fajitas were decent and not too tough.

Yak and Yeti makes a grand entrance with their menu display and the ambiance.  Right before the food arrived at the table, I felt this place had already struck gold.  After a few bites of a couple of their signature dishes, I felt they might have overstated their welcome.\\n\\nI ordered the Coconut Shrimp Tacos and sampled some of the Lo Mein dishes with chicken while my friend tried the Korean Fried Chicken and Waffle.  The flower tortilla on the shrimp tacos was your basic wrap from a bag, the lettuce was your basic lettuce from a bag, and the meat, well, the meat itself was pretty good but the entire dish itself was lacking.  It's like enjoying the third and final act of movie but feeling disappointed through the first and second.  Therefore it results with a \\"meh\\" feeling.  The Lo Mein, now the Lo Mein was very salty.  Yes there was flavor but you can tell there was more than necessary saltiness to it.  My friend concluded that the chicken and waffles were pretty good but nothing \\"Korean\\" about them?\\n\\nOverall, the food was salty where the main piece of the meal was a subtle highlight while the rest of dish drags along the way.

The parking lot is cramped; so if you find street parking.. take it!\\n\\nNATURAL VANILLA BEAN MILKSHAKE\\nThis milkshake is really good. It's very creamy and tastes like a vanilla bean ice cream. It's pretty simple in flavor, but is heavy.\\n\\nRASPBERRY AND WHITE CHOCOLATE MILKSHAKE\\nThis is one crazy heavy milkshake. I can never finish one by myself. It fills me up and I could skip a meal. That's how heavy this is. The raspberry is sweet, but it's the milk chocolate that gives it another layer of sweetness. It's like a sugar overload, which isn't too bad if you're craving for something sweet, but be careful. One sip of this is enough to give you diabetes for 5 years.\\n\\nCONTINENTAL CLUB- turkey, provolone, apple-smoked bacon, avocado, seared poblanos, pico de gallo, and chipotle mayo\\nThe turkey was a bit dry and didn't have as much flavor as I would've liked. Other than that, this was the typical turkey burger that I enjoy. The bacon is really crispy, which contrasts the turkey patty and the avocado adds some creaminess.\\n\\nAHI TUNA BURGER- sushi-grade tuna, sprouts, teriyaki, honey wasabi, nori chips, pickled ginger, and mayo\\nThis is my favorite burger to order when I come to Hopdoddy. It's like eating a big ole piece of sushi. The tuna is so fresh and light. It's cooked perfectly with a slight sear and the crispy nori chips add a nice crunchy consistency. The teriyaki is sweet and the honey wasabi reminds me of dipping tuna into soy sauce and wasabi. So good!\\n\\nPARMESAN TRUFFLE FRIES- with truffle aioli\\nI really like the truffle fries here. They don't skimp on the truffle aioli either. It's so good! The truffle flavor is very dominant and in your face, but in a good way. It's not your typical plain fries.\\n\\nI like the other location more, but this one is still good. There's always a line during peak hours; so try to get there a little earlier or after.

I thought it was odd to have an upfront cost to get in, considering it's an open market and standing in line for 20 minutes to pay slows things down tremendously. With the fee to get in, you are given a card to fill out which allows you admittance throughout the entire holiday season the market is open. If you work in the area or plan on visiting frequently, you have unlimited access after that first visit. \\n\\nInside, there are booths galore all bundled in a very small space centering around the tree and MainStage where there are carol singers or live acts. Anything and everything that you'd think was at a christkindlmarket is there. Savory foods, sausage/brats/currywurst, sweets and chocolates, GF and vegan sweets, ornaments, soaps, hats, beer and gluhwein which comes in a keepsake mug with the year listed on it. Perfect for a family outing, there's even a carousel toward the back.\\n\\nOf all the things offered, we nibbled on a potato skewer, chocolates and mulled wine. I'm still kicking myself for not tasting the currywurst as it looked delicious. \\n\\nThis really is the season for checking out holiday markets such as this. If the space was larger it might be a bit more cozy, but overall it's something to experience at least once."},{"name":"Stumptown Dumplings","address":"1477 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Mixed review on this place.

Took about 30 minutes.  The couple working the truck seemed a little confused and overwhelmed.  It took way too long to serve up this kind of food.  We got veggie curry and pork Bao.  Family liked them a lot.  They were a little doughy in my opinion.  The dumplings: we tasted all of them.  Daughter really liked flavor, but I thought exterior was a little thick, slimy and chewy.

I'm Vietnamese living in Seattle and I've yet to find any place  in the Greater Seattle area that has better Banh Mi. So whenever we visit relatives in Portland, we always bring back at least 2 dozens of assorted varieties to eat during the week.\\n\\nReasons why this place is best:\\n- Most important: they bake their own baguettes. I can't find these anywhere else. Fluffy but not dry, with a light crunch on the crust, with a wisp of buttery fragrant, these are sexy slender babies. You can also buy just the baguettes (5 per bags) from here, take them home and make your own Banh Mi if you prefer. We do that. I can't find a replacement for their baguettes from any other bakeries in the region, If you know of some place in the greater Seattle area that makes as good baguettes, please please let me know.\\n- each banh mi individually comes in its own paper pouch, very clean and convenient to contain the crumbs or anything that might fall out. I have yet to find a 2nd Vietnamese sandwich place that does this. A considerate touch.\\n- cheap, consider the 2 points above\\n- their Banh Mi are not huge or piled up like some would prefer, but that's the whole point: these are meant to be for the road, and I also loath the American way of heaping things into a sandwich to the point where things keep falling or oozzing out with each bite. Very messy don't you think?\\n\\nBonus: they make great pork pate chaud. These are small but again are more flavorful and cheaper than other Vietnamese deli's that offer similar fare.\\n\\nUpdated: if you agree with me that an authentic Banh Mi must have these 3 essential ingredients: pate, traditional mayonnaise (vegetable oil and egg yolk), and soy sauce, then this place doesn't have it, or any other place for that matter.\\n\\nUpdated: bumped it down 1 star, as I now have tasted better banh mi at Best Baguette, which also bake their own baguette."},{"name":"Coast Restaurant","address":"1054 Alberni Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"So this review is solely about happy hour.

When time to order, I asked if I could get a kabob plate and swap out the rice for something or just get the kabob since I was not going to eat the rice. The second waiter just said we can give it to you without rice but you still have to pay price of dish (??). That's not worth 17.99. Very annoyed that none of the appetizers/small plates had meat, which is why I asked.\\n\\nNonetheless I decided to order the lentil/barley soup and a Shiraz salad. The salad was fine. He brand out the soup when my boyfriend got his plate and it was disgusting. It smelled and tasted burned and I couldn't taste any lentils. I told him I didn't like it and he took it back. He asked if he could get me anything else. Again, I said id really love a small plate with some meat or a kabob and he repeated how id have to pay full price of a plate. I said forget it then, I don't want anything else. \\n\\nThat's the point where you try and accommodate your party or ask your manager what he/she can do. This guy just walked off. Ten minutes later he had the nerve to ask me how the food was. What food?\\nThe joojeh kabob my boyfriend got was good but after taking out bones from each piece there was barely any meat. They had a whole, roasted tomato on his plate but it was green and unripe, therefore completely unappetizing when roasted. \\n\\nReally unsure who was the manager that night.

We had never been here before and I have to say, we had the BEST meal of our entire trip, and this includes visits to the Cape, home to Worcester and Westborough, and going out to multiple seafood restaurants (when I'm home, I consume as much seafood as possible since I can't get it in Texas).\\n\\nThe four of us had (collectively): steamers, clam chowder, 3 kinds of oysters, the house salad I believe, the Sea Level Burger, and a hot lobster roll. The steamers were served with herbed, garlicky, warmed cooking liquid for rinsing, which was a great touch and the only occasion of the four times I ordered steamers on this trip that the rinsing liquid was more than just cooking liquid. The clam chowder was delicious and flavorful, and not just simply cream, which was the plight of other chowders we had throughout the week. I didn't have the salad but it looked great and came topped with crunchy sweet potatoes. The oysters were fresh and came with horseradish, cocktail sauce, and a fresh mango salsa. \\n\\nOur main courses, the Sea Level burger and the hot lobster roll, were amazing!!! The Sea Level burger was huge, juicy, perfectly cooked, and came with fried clams on it that was a surprisingly delicious combination. The hot lobster roll had large, fresh, perfectly cooked pieces of lobster that were tossed in just the right amount of butter. It made the lobster roll I had in P-town just a few days later pale in comparison, and I found myself longing for the Sea Level lobster roll! \\n\\nAll in all, this was a great, memorable meal that represented all that I love about Massachusetts seafood. The view provided a great seascape to set the tone for the rest of our trip. Thanks Sea Level...until next time!"},{"name":"Schmidt's Sausage Haus","address":"240 E Kossuth St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"The chocolate peanut butter cream puff was o-m-g.

The variety of dishes at the lunch buffet were decent, about 9 or 10 different things to try.  The flavor was ok, but not very spicy, definitely spiced down for the non-Indian clientele.  They did replenish their buffet trays frequently so that was good.  And they also give you a choice of complementary naan (garlic, plain) or you can have both which is nice.  However my biggest gripe is the temperature they kept the food at.  Alot of the food was warm and not hot temperature-wise and we were there at peak lunch hour too so it's not like the food was old.  Also the masala chai tea needed more spices in it, a bit watered down.  In short, it's OK indian food but given that Kebab Factory is 10 minutes from my work, I have better choices closer to me and for lunch Kebab's is cheaper.

The evening ended on a sour enough note that, really, Bryce Gilmore could have danced the Charleston on a flagpole and I still would have been pretty bummed.  I do feel that, in constructing an honest review, I would be remiss if I did not cover (at least in part) the events of that night, but I will keep it very brief before moving on to better waters - the reason that I did not write a review that night was that the whole experience just seemed so very atypical.\\n\\nWe started with the wait, which was pleasant enough.  It was long, but we were expecting it, the weather was nice out, and the hostess provided us with wine. When we were seated, we misunderstood about the concept of small plates.  It is worth noting that this was entirely our fault, though I also felt it could have perhaps been explained a bit better, as none of us had been here before.  The concept here is not exactly tapas with the bite-sized morsels, but everybody still shares.  It's an intimate sort of thing, and you should be prepared to all eat from the same plate.  This initial confusion was compounded by the fact that one of our four person party was a vegetarian.  We had each ordered three of the dishes, and when hers (all meatless, so typically thought of as starters) came first, she didn't want to eat before everybody else, and we didn't want to eat off of her plate when she could not share ours.\\n\\nThis is all pretty understandable, if unfortunate, and there's little the restaurant could have done save maybe a bit better explanation for first-timers.  From there, things kind of spiraled downward.  Staff and customers alike got frustrated (and one customer got really drunk on the wine refills), food got rushed, and the net result was a fairly expensive, quite bad time.  I sort of wanted to crawl under a rock.\\n\\nAnd yet, all around us, people were having fantastic times.  Several trusted friends spoke very highly of Barley Swine.  Clearly, I thought, this was not typical.  And I resolved to eventually make it back.\\n\\nGlad I did! Of several excellent dishes we partook in, there were a few stand-outs that really did knock our socks off:\\n\\nFar and away our favorite of these was a rabbit terrine with liver and bacon mousse.  The terrine was perfectly salted, speckled with pistachios, and was amazingly savory. The mousse complimented it well, being thin and silky enough that it was really more of a sauce.  Easily the best dish we had.  Everybody that comes here needs to try it.  Even my mother, who turns her nose at both rabbit AND liver, completely  lit up when she tasted this.\\n\\nAnother excellent dish was the pork cheek with poached egg and potatoes.  The soft egg yolk made a decadent sauce for the fatty (in a good way -- that's where the flavor is!) pork.  This was very reminiscent to me of Korean dishes with the soft egg and meat, but in a more domestic \\"meat and potatoes\\" vein, and with some definite Spanish influence in the seasoning.  Very well done.\\n\\nThe quail and the lamb were also excellent, as were the other dishes we had.\\n\\nThe hazelnut brownie dessert was absolutely incredible, as well. I wanted to lick the plate.  I really did.  The panna cotta however, while tasty, was a bit more gelatinous and less creamy  than I am accustomed to.  Small concern; it was still delicious.\\n\\nService was all very good, as well --  unhurried and leisurely, while remaining attentive.  I did notice that there was a new speech given as guests were seated about vegetarian accommodations and customer requests for individual (as opposed to shared) service.  I was quite glad to hear this, if a bit self-conscious about it.  It means they really *do* want to do right, and they take note of and learn from unfortunate situations that arise.  I just wish that I had not been \\"that asshole\\".\\n\\nAnyway.  Long story a little bit less long: I had a great time with great food, and I completely see now why all my friends said I had to try this place.

The set-up of the restaurant is pretty unique and surprisingly efficient. The line was long (which is a good sign of great food!) but it definitely moved quickly, and we passed by the bar along the way, so you can order drinks while waiting in line. Then by the time we ordered and sat down, it was only about 10 minutes tops til our burgers came out! I ordered the Goodnight Burger (the one with BBQ sauce) and the pumpkin milkshake which is seasonal. I HIGHLY recommend getting the whole wheat bun. It has a lot of seeds on it, it's absolutely DELICIOUS (I was even eating bits of it separately from the burger so it wouldn't be overpowered by the strong flavor). The buns are all are super fresh because they're constantly being made throughout the day, and to me that was one of my favorite parts of this restaurant. We also got the fries with the green chili queso... also so fresh and yummy! Everything was made from really high quality ingredients, and combined with the fun environment, it was just the perfect experience!

We ordered theThe ribs which Was dry , tough and rubbery. The sides Collards greens, red beans and rice and Candied yams.  The Collards greens tasted like Can greens ( mama nem makes can greens) The red beans and rice caused my wife's neck to jerk in an unhealthy manner, she was disgusted by the fact that they charge for undelicious food. In fact She alluded to the fact that Orlando must have different taste buds then everyone else in the country. However I must acknowledge that the customer service was excellent.

Been here quite a few times to satisfy my husbands craving and we walk out still a bit hungry due to not being able to finish the food because of the quality. Maybe our taste buds are stuck up but I definitely think that P Terry's is a great substitute because it's always hot and fast & cheaper. Besides, if you're eating a burger, are you really that focused on how much better the beef is? And if so, would you rather eat it if it tastes dry, over cooked and plain?

Unfortunately, these burgers are just a bit higher price than I would hope. Paying $20 for a burger and fries is a bit excessive, especially when you add in the cost of a drink or alcoholic beverage. The atmosphere at Hopdoddy is very modern. This attracts huge lines out the door during busy times. Sometimes it can take over twenty minutes to be seated. This is not a knock against Hopdoddy for being so popular. However, I believe there is a better way to seat people. It can be quite annoying to stand outside, especially during the hot summer and cold winter. The drink choices are quite exceptional. The bar offers plenty of local craft beers as well as your traditional light beer. I tried a local craft beer that was exceptional. The milkshakes here are amazing, which in my opinion , is a must for a great burger place. I got the chocolate, while my girlfriend got the caramel. The caramel was amazing but had a little too much sea salt. The chocolate shake was good as well.

I was really impressed by the food, but I did dock 1 star for the service. \\n\\nFirst, it is on the westside, but in an area where parking can be tricky. I love that they valet-only so I don't have to mess with that.\\n\\nThe decor/feel of the place is chill and the vibe is very inviting. \\n\\nThe food is served \\"family\\" style. This is fine, but our server collected the cards (you order like sushi cards) when she took our orders, so you need to remember what each person got. This can only become problematic since the tacos definitely are 2-3 bites MAX, and each person is trying to keep track of 3-4 tacos each. Maybe it's my attention span, but that could get tricky. I was most impressed by their duck and falafel tacos. Also of note, the price points were on par with the serving sizes.\\n\\nI also had their wedge salad which was a bit spicy but really good. Not a typical wedge & I appreciated that. The guac was also a little spicy, which I enjoyed. Note on the guac tho: It came out with 5 large chips only. As in, they looked like deep-friend 4\\" taco shells. We were all pretty confused by this since it came out before our server explained that they served things \\"family style.\\" \\n\\nLike I said, I docked a star for service because we hit a few bumps. First, my friend's wine didn't come out with the rest of the cocktails (including other glasses of wine). No explanation was given as to why there was a delay. A simple \\"oh, it's not cold yet\\" or something would have done the trick, but we were left with silence. The wine did eventually show up. Next, my friends' veracruz fish tacos (highly recommended by our server) didn't come out with the rest of the food. In fact, we had all finished our food AND cocktails before they made it to the table! Again, no explanation (other than \\"they shouldn't take this long\\") was given as to why they were so delayed. Our server did bring a spicy cucumber salad out with the veracruz tacos. Both were tasty. \\nLastly, our server was definitely cute & bubbly, but not the sharpest. I realize they've only been open for a few weeks at this point, but knowing which types of alcohol are in the signature cocktails without having to run back-and-forth to the bar is basic.  \\n\\nIt's a relaxed, chill place and I was really impressed.

I will say the food and drink was delicious but the service I experienced was outright racist, differential, and poor. I was a party of 4 with 2 black diners, who had a reservation at 9 pm. We waited about 10 minutes for the seating which was fine. Once we sat, we waited another 20 minutes to be asked our drink orders. Once we put in our drinks, which was 1 glass of wine, 1 sangria and 1 mixed drink, we waited another 20 minutes for these and the ones that took the longest were the wine drinks (so not being held up at the busy bar). In this time, multiple plates that were not ours were brought over to us. Finally, 40 minutes after our intended reservation, did we order food. We then again received 2 orders of food that were not intended for us. On the 2nd round of drinks, we waited for our orders for over 20 minutes and tried repeatedly to get the attention of our 2 (yes 2) waiters. Finally, we got our 2nd round of drinks.\\n\\nA bartender was going around the entire restaurant with this carafe of wine (?) and pouring it into diners mouths. He literally stopped at EVERY table but ours. We were the ONLY visibly people of color in the restaurant. At first I thought he was only doing this to people beginning their meal but saw him do this to people settling the check. PS, we also waited to settle the check for 20 minutes. All the while waitstaff are just hanging around.\\n\\nI am from this city, and know Boston is one of the most racist places, but I was disappointed to be reminded by this yet again.

Coast is one of those places that I usually find annoying, they are trendy, over priced and full of pretentious people, food, and staff. But dropping in after the suited lunch crowd and bitchanista evening crowd is a good tip  here. Also the lunch menu is a wonderful value, as is buck-a-shuck. So I ordered 2 dozen oysters and the shucker was nice enough to use some gems that are not usually on the  cheapo selection. This was a such a nice offer and for me this simple act goes a long way in my book. The oysters were fresh and delicious, as you would expect in a higher end fish house. Coast is also a ocean wise establishment. \\n   The staff was wonderful, and chatty at the bar which makes solo dining less solo. I also discovered what may be my new food fetish, Lobster Poutine!!!

I had their Classic Mussels which was in a broth of Chardonnay. My fries as always I request as well-done. I loved this dish. The mussels were small and sweet.

So glad I did! I was never a big fan of BBQ brisket because the ones I had (ahem... in the LA area) were just okay. Some were too dry for my taste. Well, my view has changed. I love how they ask you what cut you wanted and they sliced the brisket right there in front of you! So I asked the lady what she would recommend and she suggested the middle section of the brisket which was her favorite part. Where there's a nice balance of lean meat with fat. After taking a bite of the brisket, all I can say is...WOW. I've never had brisket so tender that it melted in my mouth until trying the brisket here. The ribs were just as tender and delicious! Anyway, I'm a BBQ brisket fan now, thanks to Terry Black's Barbeque!"},{"name":"Wingnuts","address":"2088 Briarcliff Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"I've ordered from here before.

It represents not only great American food, but also a slice of history. This restaurant served the likes of the Kennedys to Abe Lincoln. The cigar stained walls and ornate carved wood bar are really special. It is a true gentleman's club and the history in the place drips from the walls. But more importantly the service and food are spectacular. Let's start with the service.\\n\\nThe service is impeccable. It may be a bit more overbearing than you are used to. You are greeted professionally. You are seated with the women sitting first of course. Then menus are distributed, women first as well. All inquiries about more food or drink are done at appropriate times and are never too frequent. The waiter was very friendly and chatted it up with us about the history and his experiences. Very cool.\\n\\nThe food is also spectacular. I ordered the diver scallops as a starter. They were delicious. For my main, the pork chops. Also extremely tasty. Pork chops that are cooked medium? Oh yeah. I hate well done pork chops. These were cooked perfectly. My side was the gnocchi. They couldn't have been more pillow like; some of the best gnocchi I've ever had. Some of the other dishes my party had were the lamb, lobster savannah, duck, and filet. All tasted top notch. For some of the other sides, our party had asparagus with hollandaise sauce and mashed potatoes. Both were great. For dessert we had the macaroons, bete noir, and baked alaska. Again, all delicious.\\n\\nEverything was so great, well presented, and tasted wonderful. However, if I do have to have a criticism, it would be this. Locke-Ober is very white. There wasn't one minority in there. I do have to keep in mind however that this place only started to serve women in 1972. Prior to that, it was men only. So it isn't surprising that there aren't a lot of different clientele at the Locke-Ober. Second, the place seams a bit too aristocratic and stuffy. But again, that comes with the territory and the history of the place.\\n\\nI encourage everyone to try this place once. Deal with the somewhat stuffy atmosphere to try the food. It is delicious. But, you better have a fat wallet. This place isn't the cheapest restaurant in Boston."},{"name":"Les Faux Bourgeois","address":"663 E 15th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Overly salty food is not okay.

I've never had a bad experience with sandwiches here, and although the place is small and right on the street, I'm always able to find parking and get a table pretty easily. They're constantly rotating out new sandwiches (although not always appealing ones), and you can create your own, so you'll pretty much never run out of options. They just recently started selling OH! Chips as well (Robin C. pointed that out to me)!\\n\\nIt's hard to really pinpoint a go-to sandwich for me. I'm in love with their Italian sub, because the bread, meat, dressing, and spices they put on it are perfect. You can get a half or a whole, but if you get the half, I think you'll be disappointed you didn't order more. Last week I went with the Spice of Life, and the scallion cream cheese combined with roast beef, turkey, and corned beef was fantastic.\\n\\nMy buddy's a huge fan of the Club, which I think is decent, but in the end, is still just a club. The garlic-herb mayo does set it apart just a bit. Other favorites of mine are the Cuban and The Curse of  '49, which has some killer braunschwager on it.\\n\\nThey also offer salads as well as pre-made pasta and veggie salads at the counter. The desserts are pretty tasty as well, but by the time I'm done with the sandwiches, I usually don't have any room for more. \\n\\nBrown Bag's become a staple in German Village, and Columbus as a whole really, so if you still haven't had a chance to get down there, I highly recommend it."},{"name":"The COOP: A Southern Affair","address":"610 W Morse Blvd","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3.5","text":"I know a lot of people love and rave about this place! Yes, it's very Southern - with your green beans, Mac and cheese, creamy corn etc... It's a lot like the 4 Rivers BBQ restaurant concept (which I wasn't expecting) in the sense that you stand in line and order your food. I honestly thought this place would be more of a sit down restaurant where we would be served. It's definitely more casual than I thought. The food is definitely good and fresh! The cheese on my salad, I could tell was freshly grated, and not some processed dried out cheese from a bag. Also the balsamic vinaigrette, I could see the little pieces of finely chopped garlic, and olive oil. This made me happy as I know it's made from scratch. The staff was very helpful and accommodating, especially since I don't really eat meat as much anymore, and obviously this place is known for their chicken, but I was there for a birthday occasion, so it was nice to see them willing to make sure I'd have a great experience.

It is a delicious combination of pureed spinach and lamb that is so tender it melts in your mouth. I was skeptical about the seafood red curry, but at first bite I immediately regretted my judgment that the combination couldn't work. The seafood (mussels, shrimp, squid and fish) was prepared just perfect, not chewy at all. My favorite dish of the night had to be the coconut curry with lamb. Hello explosion of flavors in my mouth! This dish is a multiplex of spices and kick. The hint of coconut milk reminds me of Thai curry but definitely not as creamy. I dipped my naan in the curry and I was in India folks. It's just that good. \\n\\nEntrees range from $11 - 20 and the portion sizes are adequate to share family style.

I believe you get a good value for your money ($13.99) although I agree with Addy C: the mandatory 20% gratuity for our large party was a bit much.

That was great and actually helpful in settling the bored kids.  Finally the food came out, minus two kid meals that were not ready.  One was done wrong in the kitchen, and without hesitation or any complaining on our part, a manager came over and apologized and comped both of them!  That is exceptional service.  The quality of food was better than previous visits.  I ordered the southwest grilled chicken salad.  It was HUGE!

I love the different toppings that are featured with the fry selection.

She was curious to try pork face for the first time, and insisted that all of her friends in Chi-O were raving about this place.  The dining experience can best be described as \\"Christmas-like\\", in that customers are forced to eat together at large group tables and quietly suppress their hatred and anger towards each other.  We were seated next to a married-looking couple who told us they were looking to be open-minded and try something new, though apparently still closed-minded enough to be offended by \\"inappropriate staring\\".  \\n\\nUpon receiving our first course, a duck-foam-popcorn thing that looked to be constructed by an impulsive toddler, I began to lose faith that anything coming out of that kitchen was going to be appetizing, filling, or worth the sum paid for it.  My fears were confirmed when the highly anticipated pork face amounted to tiny cubes of meat surrounded by some post-modern smattering of apple columns and potato salad spheres.  We were so disappointed and left hungry by the quality of this meal, that neither my date nor I could enjoy Snow White And The Huntsman when we got home.  \\n\\nI dislike Barley Swine, not because their food is inherently bad, but because of their participation in the trenchant reductionism that is plaguing modern restaurants.  If you tell me on the menu that I get to eat something's face, I better goddamn well be able to tell that it is a face when I am eating it.  I like for my food to resemble food, not something that should be pinned to the breast of a Victorian-era French Noble.  Growing up poor, I had the opportunity to eat obscure cuts of meat, to come to love the subtle tastes that made lengua, tripe, pork face, and venison respectively unique and wonderful.  What Barley Swine seems to be doing is dumbing this experience down for tourists, putting training wheels on what should be naturally adventurous cuisine.\\n\\nTo be fair, when it comes to the apparently popular and lucrative practice of presenting young professionals with little more than light palatable Instagram fodder, Barley Swine creates the finest product of all similar restaurants in the area.  It is a great place to take vacuous West-Coast transplants longing to dip their toe into southern Homestyle cuisine without forcing them out of their comfort zone.

He warned me about the line that can wrap around outside of the building, but we got there around 1PM on Saturday and there was no line at all.  I likely wouldn't have been thrilled about waiting in the heat if there had been, but it looks like the trick is to go there for a late lunch.  \\n\\nBetween the two of us we got the meatloaf entree with okra and mac n' cheese (his) and an order of chicken and waffles with a side of collard greens (mine).  Everything was pretty darned tasty and fully what I'd define as comfort food.  The chicken was really juicy, the collard greens were spot on, and that meatloaf ... wow.  Wrapped in bacon and smothered in gravy, drizzled in a sweet/savory (BBQ?) sauce ... really fantastic.  \\n\\nI'm almost ashamed to admit this, but this was my maiden voyage into the wonderful world of chicken and waffles, and they were pretty great.  The waffles were light and fluffy and had good flavor.  My only wish was for more than the light drizzle of maple syrup that came with the dish.  I should have asked for more, because otherwise it was delicious.\\n\\nI wasn't expecting fine dining, so I wasn't let down.  The COOP is a good excuse for some serious southern comfort food. The place is adorable, and not a single chair matches another.  The service was what I'd expect for a place like this. I'll definitely return (post lunch rush)."},{"name":"La Quercia","address":"3689 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I was really looking forward to trying out this restaurant due to the great things I've heard. However I wonder if it has gone downhill over the last few years. There is a 6 course \\"family style\\" option available for $60 a person and an 11 course available as well. Our reservation was for 7:45 and overall we were there for 2 hours. \\n\\nMy first issue was with the slowness of the courses. Perhaps people who come here like to sit and chat between courses but I would prefer not to be starving while waiting for food. It took 2 hours for all 6 courses to come out. This is roughly 20 minutes between courses!! I would NOT suggest to come here hungry as the portion sizes are very small. \\n\\nThe charcuterie plate was nothing special. The meats were fairly bland and I could've done without the hard mini breadsticks. \\n\\nThe second course was a cheese souffl√©. The cheese in this was so pungent and strong it was difficult to enjoy. Maybe those who like strong cheeses would enjoy this course. It did, however, have a pleasant smooth texture.\\n\\nNext up were the scallops which were slightly rubbery. I have had much better scallops. They were also very small, and the flavour was not enough to compensate. \\n\\nAfter that came two pasta dishes. The first was spaghettini and was very dry, bland and reminded me of wonton egg noodles. The texture was rough, which I've never experienced with pasta before. It was pretty much tasteless. The second pasta dish was much better, stuffed with veal. This was good but nothing spectacular.\\n\\nThe main course was a lamb loin with potato and vegetables. It smelled very aromatic and the potato was good. The vegetables were quite bitter and the lamb very gamey. I prefer as little gaminess as possible and I'm not a huge fan of lamb. Please don't be shy and let the waiter know your food preferences before eating!\\n\\nDessert was standard - a slice of chocolate cake and an apple strudel. The cake was good but the apples in the strudel were mush, like baby food. We didn't finish. \\n\\nOverall I felt like the dishes here were too complex in flavour. Everything was either too pungent, too sour, too bitter or had too much going on. The service was standard for this price point so nothing to complain about there. I definitely think my money would be better spent elsewhere."},{"name":"Phoebe's Diner","address":"533 W Oltorf St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"What a dream, the Migas and 04 was so tasty.

I saw a woman clearing plates and I asked her about it and several minutes later, after we had already eaten our first plates, someone came and brought us water. Still no naan. \\n\\nWe got up to go back to the buffet and again there were no plates. We waited for a solid ten minutes with a small crowd of people until plates were brought out and got our food. When we got back to our table everything was cleared, including our waters. I saw a woman in the corner stacking plates and I told her about it and a few minutes later she gave us water. A few minutes after that we finally got naan halfway into our second round of buffet. \\n\\nThe food was good. The price was reasonable. But I had to hunt down table-cleaners to get water only to have that water taken away when I went back to the buffet.

A lot of pizza is over rated. That's kind of what I expected when I visited Santarpios Pizza in East Boston, but I am happy to report the great ratings are correct...this pizza is not just good but I would say great and arguably the best in Boston.  Starting with the mile walk from the subway through a rather rough neighborhood this is what you expect from an old Boston establishment. The place is dark and dicey. The staff is politely rude and the local customers give you that almost but not really welcoming stare. The experience is priceless. When Simone and I arrived we were greeted by an older gentlemen that was working the grill and were asked simply if we wanted grill or Pizza.  I politely told him both and he told me to stand there and wait to be seated, a few seconds later another waiter came and pointed to me a seat and asked if I needed menus.  Legend has it this is how the staff knows if your a local or a tourist, and if you are a tourist you can expect to be heckled and treated like one. So I Lied and told them no menu was need. From the grill, I wanted the one sausage skewer, one lamb skewer, and from the kitchen, a pepperoni and mushroom pie ( I had researched the menu before my trip).  The waiter said okay and went to place our order.  Before long I noticed that every time our waiter walked by he would be talking to himself saying \\"hey,hey,hey\\". I have no idea why he did this but it was definitely amusing if not a little troubling. Our Sausage and Lamb appetizers came out pretty quickly and were accompanied with wedges of Crusty Bread and Banana Peppers. They both were cooked perfectly medium and were smokey and well flavored naturally from the 20 something year old grill.  The Bread soaked up the juices and the peppers added some spice.  The sausage was homemade and was Simone's favorite. I preferred the lamb. Not wanting to be rude we finished it all except a few chunks of bread which the waiter pointed out, so of course I finished those off before I was his next victim. The \\"hey hey hey\\" pizza came out right behind the finished plates of skewered meats. It was Boston thin crust at its best, hand tossed with crunchy almost burnt edges and a charred, cornmeal dusted bottom.  It was easily fold-able but not soggy. The well  aged oven added to the flavor of the spicy pepperoni and fresh mushrooms topped with perfectly melted stringy cheese.  The sauce tasted like ripe tomatoes with a hint of basil and was slightly sweet. It was a classic taste of what pizza should be.  I could not let any of this pizza go to waste and we finished every last bite.  \\"Hey Hey Hey\\" this was great great great pizza with that great great great Boston spirit.

I'm a firm believer that everyone deserves a second (or in this case, third) chance to account for any unusual circumstances which are bound to happen in the service industry. Unfortunately, BJ's used up the last of its three chances today when a friend and I tried it out for lunch. \\n\\nWe arrived around 2:30 or 3:00 to a mostly empty restaurant and a very friendly greeting from the hostess and were sat immediately. We were greeted semi-promptly by our server who took our drink order and returned with  water (until my beer arrived) and a soda for my friend. He then asked me what I had ordered to drink because he forgot. Eh, it happens...no big deal. Five minutes go by with no beer. A few more go by before our server walks by the table and says \\"What happened to your beer? They told me it went out!\\" I jokingly say \\"Where did it go?\\" and proceed to speculate as to why my beer has now taken nearly ten minutes to find our table during lunch, when service should be much quicker than any other time of day. He left the table, went to the bar, returned to our table and told me that they were changing the keg at the moment. I attempted to order a different beer, in hopes that I would actually get it, but our server said that the beer I had initially ordered would be up when he returned to the bar. Finally, after at least ten minutes of waiting, I was sipping on a nice, cold, delicious beer. It was then that I decided that I would not be ordering another and that it would be best for me to make this one last throughout the duration of the meal.\\n\\nAfter the beer situation was sorted out, we went unacknowledged for a few minutes more before our order was taken. My friend tried to order a lunch item, which is only available Monday through Friday. Ok, fine, we didn't see the fine print at the top of the lunch menu...our mistake, but that doesn't change the fact that only offering a special lunch menu Monday - Friday is just plain silly.

Food quality is consistently okay here and both my friend and I were satisfied with what we ordered.

It was just OK. I felt like the food did not match up to my expectations. It's overpriced for what you get tbh. The flavors are interesting but not well-executed. Like the sauces are good but the meats itself felt like they were cooked by amateurs - you know when the meats still have that...unappetizing smell/taste when the blood isn't taken out thoroughly. Like when you microwave an unseasoned meat, you get that awful smell/taste in them. I'm really sensitive to those smell/taste and it was disappointing to taste that in their dishes. I know I'm being really particular as my sister has no problem with it. So this review is only good for those peeps with sensitive palate. \\nWe got:\\nPork buns - the bao and the pickled radish were really good BUT the PORK WAS TOUGH to chew with that smell/taste I just described and I ended up taking the meat out. \\nNasi Goreng - It's fried rice with that grilled fire scent and shrimp&pineapple&egg. The shrimp didn't have any flavor though. I liked it overall but $17 seems a bit much. \\nFried Chicken and Ginger Waffle - The skin and the waffle was good. I like more toasted waffle with soft inner bread, but this waffle was just soft overall. The skin was crispy with some flavoring in the skin. However, the meat was meh. I smothered the meat in the spicy sauce (which was delish) to erase the meat smell. \\n\\nAll in all, I probably would not go back. I just wasn't impressed. I guess this is more of 3.5 star sort of place. It's better than lk Applebee's for sure. If the price were cheaper, I may have been more impressed.

A few things could use a little refinement.\\n\\nThe Painted Pin is an upscale bowling alley which has food, a bar, 2 bocce ball courts, 2 skee ball courts, and 2 arcade style basketball courts.  It's clear that this place used to be an old warehouse, but it's also clear that the owners transformed it into a really fun hangout spot.  On a Friday night, there was a live band which played a mix of recent and old music.  I liked how all of the games that weren't bowling were free.  You could shoot hoops until you were tired and no quarters were required for the skee ball machines.\\n\\nFor food, I ordered three tacos and a plate of the loaded fries.  One taco had steak, another had fried chicken, and the third had fish.  The fried chicken taco was the best of the three.  All of them had a lot of flavor.  My only criticism on the tacos was that the fish taco tasted a little fishy.  Loaded fries were cooked well - not \\"overloaded\\" with cheese and bacon as most places do it, but there was enough to be satisfied.\\n\\nI noticed that service was a little disorganized.   Everyone was polite though.  I assume that because this place is relatively new, that the efficiency of the service will improve with time.  The biggest nuisance was the waiting area by the bowling lanes.  The tables are too wide, so it's very difficult to walk from your seat to the bowling lane without disturbing those who are seated.  Be prepared to stand for most of the time if you want a good bowling experience.  Also, some people sign up for the bocce ball courts and some don't, which can lead to disagreements on who has the courts.

I could have eaten both entrees and been in heaven. You could not go wrong with anything on the menu.\\n\\nDessert was also a home run with a Chocolate bread pudding with banana ice cream (decadent) and a dried cherry and almond tart with vanilla bean ice cream (not for me because of the almonds).

And husband and I definitely enjoyed ourselves, mostly thanks to our bartender extraordinaire, Jason Bright, who slung Ginger Margaritas (not gingery enough), dry ice-topped Cucumber Martinis (oh, the novelty!), and SweetWater Pale Ales all evening.  Our meals were good, too: a Southern Burger of chicken-fried beef, pimiento cheese, bread and butter pickles and sweet tea and lemon sauce; a Tuna Tartare burger topped by a mango \\"sphere\\", \\"compressed veg\\", pine nuts, avocado, sesame \\"crispies\\", wasabi mayo and a raw egg yolk (which, liability-wise, reeeeeally needs to be mentioned on the menu -- it's not); and two sides of coffee-BBQ dusted sweet potato tots with blue cheese \\"foam\\" and fried okra with Sriracha aioli.

One day, I decided to save $20 on delivery from Door Dash by ordering ahead and then picking up.

After paying, I watched the line get longer and longer, and before I knew it, the last person that came in had walked in, had their food made at the counter, paid, and walked out and I was still standing there. Needless to say, it's good food but I don't think waiting in line for 20 mins to pay, and then another 45 just to get my order that I called in while walk-ins were already gone is worth it.

I was gone for almost 2 hours. Unfortunately, like many, I don't have that kind of time during a work day to watch people behind me get their food first. Also like other reviews, the staff are nice but incredibly unfocused and the guys making the walk-in orders would randomly wander off. Inefficiency during lunch on a work day is a deal breaker.

Especially the chawanmushi, which was so salty that even after splitting the tiny custard amongst 4 people (about 1-2 spoonfuls per person) it seemed like I had maxed out on my sodium limit. The delicate texture was spot-on, which I think is the hardest part about making it, so I was sad that the failing of the dish seemed to just be an over-dousing of concentrated soy sauce. We ordered 2 different buns, which for $5 each made me wishing the Fugu food truck was nearby so I could snag some of their tastier buns, which are $6 for two. All that being said, I did enjoy the veggie dishes we ordered - the bok choy and eggplant - as well as the Mama Chang dumplings.  \\n\\nThe waiter recommended we order 2-3 dishes per person.

One other reviewer described this as the Indian Olive Garden, and that's basically accurate.  I've been here multiple times and am always underwhelmed; the food is overdone, fairly bland, and non-threatening.\\n\\nI shy away from the idea of \\"authentic\\" Indian food because there are so many diverse cuisines from region to region across India, and moreover you can't just use jalapenos instead of Indian green chilis and expect it to taste the same.  But some restaurants do better than others; Clay Pit is not one of them.\\n\\nI'm primarily talking about North Indian/Mughlai/Punjabi food, because that's what I know after years living there and that's 95% of what gets served in Indian restaurants in America (along with the ubiquitous Goan Vindaloo and the occasional dosa, pao bhaji, or Bengali prawns).  This is a pet peeve to begin with, but the main problem is that the secret to this kind of food is that the spices are all cooked carefully at different heats for different times.  You can't just dump them in at the beginning or at the end or it won't taste right.  So beware any restaurant--such as Clay Pit--that offers food \\"spiced to order.\\"  They make the food bland then dump in some extra chili powder at the end, which doesn't even help cover up that obvious bitterness of burnt turmeric.  Another problem is that keeping the food heated at a lunch buffet (if that's what you choose) makes all the flavors soak together and the texture deteriorate on some dishes.  Also in many dishes they rely too much on rich cream and sugar without balancing the flavor; just because it's a dish wish \\"malai\\" (cream) in the name, doesn't mean that's all a person should taste.\\n\\nThe bar has a few creative drink options that are worth trying if you end up there, but not worth their own visit."},{"name":"Verde Cocina","address":"524 NW 14th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This is a great spot for someone with any allergy restrictions, vegan/vegetarian, etc. I had the carne asada and it was cooked perfectly and very filling.

What a wonderful night with my family!

I didn't think the food was so ridiculously overpriced that I would shy away from buying anything. A German bratwurst on bun was $8.00; yummy baked stuffed apples were just under $6.00; caramel popcorn (my mother's favourite) was $7.00 for a large bag. \\n**Our secret: we share! That way we had a taste of everything instead of feasting on just one thing! \\n\\nThe atmosphere was joyous and the people were friendly. My parents who were not convinced they'd have fun here, probably had the most fun. We didn't buy any of the crafts as they were mostly Christmas ornaments. Considering we never have a tree in the house, it is pointless to buy ornaments. But we did enjoy looking at them! \\n\\nThere's a stall selling fruit soaps made to look like the real fruit with parts of the real fruit attached. $3.50 for the small ones; $5.50 (?) for the larger ones.

This was honestly one of the best that I've had.  The salmon was fresh and flavorful, and the potatoes were well seasoned and savory as well.  I enjoyed the pancakes as well, but among the three of us, we weren't even able to finish the pancakes, since they have such generous portions!  \\n\\nThe decor of this diner is very old-school diner-feel, with throwback lunch boxes lining the walls and various other decorations.

After seeing the sign I realized it was the same restaurant I saw on this website as one of the top 10 in Austin. As a huge fan of Indian food I knew I eventually had to head over there. Thankfully I did.\\n\\nFOOD: 9\\nI was pleased that the food wasn't a carbon copy of standard Indian Fare. Unfortunatly it is pretty Americanized, which I was fine with but could be an issue for those conserned about authenticity. The chicken tikka masala didn't have much sauce, which was kind of disappointing considering the sauce was good. Again I did appreciate it being unique though. The tandoori chicken was pretty solid, but it was a little disappointing portion wise. I also had some free cheese naan (that story is in the service section) and that was pretty good too. As much as I harden various aspects the food was really good in general. The rest of the menu looked pretty interesting, I would encourage anyone to explore it more than I did.\\n\\nSERVICE: 9.75\\nThe staff was very friendly and happy to accommodate you as needed. The wait was kind of long but we did come in at a bad time. The servers were pretty attentive and worked very smoothly. The food came out at a good time especially considering the colossal amount of other customers there. Our server missed forgot to bring 2 orders of tandoori chicken, but in apology they swapped our half eaten rice for a new one, tikka masala sauce, cheese naan, and of course our second order of tandoori chicken, all for free. That definitely made my day.  The wait times are the only thing that keeps this from being a 10/10, but considering the circumstances the wait was nothing to complain much about.\\n\\nVENUE: 9\\nThe outside was made up of some simple but interesting white brick. There was some outdoor seating, but it was awkwardly stretched in a thin path near the sidewalk. There was a ton of indoor seating but it was still full (during peak time on Friday at least). The seating area was split into two rooms, both unfurnished other then a painting or two on the wall. There was a decent sized bar that looked pretty well run. The wait area was pretty large and comfortable. The restaurant was pretty clean. It's a neat little place.\\n\\nPRICE/PORTION: 8.75\\nThe food wasn't particularly expensive, but like any good Indian restaurant I can't say it was cheap. The portion size was slightly disappointing, but nothing earth shattering. Not a ton to complain about here but the above should be noted.\\n\\nOVERALL: 9.2\\nFood was great but not extremely authentic. The menu was expansive, interesting, and unique. The servers and staff were outstanding, not over friendly or anything like that either. The wait times were a little bit long but understandable. The venue was interesting and clean. The price/portion wasn't a bargain but still worth it. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone interested in some good Indian food in Austin.\\n\\ntl;dr - Great food and service but not the most authentic"},{"name":"Leaky Roof","address":"1538 SW Jefferson St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I came here once a long long time ago.

The caf√© was bustling and full of locals, and the atmosphere was pure relaxation. Hip, happening and upscale, walking into Medina Caf√© feels like you're walking into a European caf√© with style.\\n\\nAnd the food...The food is unbelievable and unlike any brunch I have ever had. The menu is inspired by French cuisine, but borrows a little from Italian, making for superb flavor combinations, and ultra unique dishes. My wife and I had the --both plates blew us away. \\n \\nMy wife had the Saumon Fum√©--an eggs Benedict-like brunch meal, with a wonderful smoked salmon dill-spiced cheese spread on toast, and topped with arugula and an egg. The arugula was incredibly tasty because it had a beautiful crunch and peppery taste, and lacked the bitterness that some arugula can have. But the best part is the clean, fresh and bold flavor of the salmon-dill cheese spread.\\n\\nI had the Fricasse, which is beautifully presented in a cast-iron skillet that helps keep the dish warm while you devour it (yes, you WILL devour it). Along the bottom of the dish you'll find the wonderfully spiced and sweet roast meat that gives this dish its deep and heavy persona. The meat is topped with arugula that wilts with the heat of the skillet, but makes for better mixing with the meat and slightly lends the flavors of arugula to the meat itself. On top of the arugula you'll find cheese and two eggs, firmly making the dish fabulously brunchy. Best is how the roast meat melts in your mouth and pairs with the peppery arugula.\\n\\nAn added bonus is the coffee. Not only do they brew with beans from one of the best roasters in Vancouver (49th Parallel), but they also REALLY know how to pull a shot of espresso, which is often not the case in restaurants. I had a macchiato that was among the best I had while in Vancouver.\\n\\nA note: next door to Medina Caf√© is Chambar, a stylish and trendy restaurant with a lounge that looks amazing. We didn't get a chance to experience it, but we spoke to someone associated with the restaurant, who also works for Medina Caf√©. He helps to run both restaurants, so judging from the quality of Medina Caf√©, I can only imagine how amazing Chambar must be... \\n\\nWhen we left Medina Caf√©, I nearly got teary eyed because I don't know when I will ever come back to enjoy it--it is that good."},{"name":"Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken","address":"117 San Jacinto Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I'm so glad we took this spontaneous drive to Austin to try Gus's!  I heard about the lines out the door and how amazing in flavor this chicken was so we decided to just go for it!  We parked in a parking garage down the street and hit the place up.  There wasnt a bad line at all and we only waited out the door for about 5 minutes. There's two poke stops near by so we took advantage of those.  (Nerd alert, don't hate) When we got in they took our name down and we only waited for about 10 more minutes. We got sat and the fun began.  We ordered the fried pickles to start.  These aren't your average fried pickles.  These are yummy fried pickles Spears that pair so well with the ranch they give you.  The batter is to die for on these things. You can scope out all the beautiful dill weed pieces in it.  My niece ordered the strips which came with two sides.  And my husband shared a half chicken, which came with a thigh, a breast, a leg and a wing with two sides.  We doubled up on Mac and added a side of fries for my son to snack on..... and an extra two pieces of strips to try as well. We don't play when we wanna try new places.  Some of the best chicken hands down I've ever tasted in my life. It's super spicy, but as a Mexican/Thai girl I can't complain about that. The meals come with bread which is kind of unnecessary with all the other goodies you get with it.  The MAC AND CHEESE IS THE BOMBBBBB. So so good you literally cannot miss out on the Mac.

It was a little nippy, but it was dry - can't complain! I went with the Groupon again this year. \\n\\nThe big difference this year was a particularly nasty one: NO EXPRESS GROUPON LANE! The organizers should know that we greatly resent that. When your patrons take the time to plan ahead and pre-purchase tickets, you want to reward and appreciate them with a minimum of an express lane. In the end, we had to get in line with spontaneous visitors who hadn't even planned to come. We made time for this and planned ahead, so it's fair to expect that we should be able to skip the lines. \\n\\nOtherwise, the market was as lovely as usual. I enjoyed browsing the unique stalls; although I have never once had the patience to get in line for the special ornaments tent/store. \\n\\nWe rode the carousel like champs. It was nice to know that something as beautiful as an old fashioned carousel can still be found in operation. \\n\\nI was almost too excited for the Applehaus. Every year, I look forward to those baked apples. My usual flavour is not on the menu anymore. It seems they have further limited the selection.

I was sharing it with my dear friend, who preferred to try the Caramel Crunch.  We enjoyed it together nonetheless. \\n\\nFYI: The souvenir mugs from the Groupon cannot be returned.

I would give them 4 or 5 stars if it weren't for my most recent experience at this location: I was halfway through my sofritas burrito when I felt something in between my teeth which I thought was a hair. When I pulled it out of my mouth I found that it was a piece of metal. It was stiff and curly and looked like a piece of a stainless steel cleaning sponge. I'm so glad that I felt it between my teeth and didn't swallow it; it could have caused some serious problems had I swallowed it. I called the location and a manager asked me to bring the piece of metal back to them with my receipt, she said they needed to give the metal to their safety department or similar title. I get the concept but after finding a piece of a metal cleaning sponge in my mouth while trying to eat my burrito, I really didn't feel like digging up my receipt and jumping in my car to bring Chipotle my alarming mouth-score. There happened to be snow and ice on the roads on this day which further discouraged me from running an errand on their behalf. I told the manager I had photos I could send her and she agreed to give me her number so I could text photos of the metal and my receipt, which I did. I appreciate the prompt response and offer to give me a free meal, and the apology, however I was put off by how all of that was disclaimed with \\"we can't identify that item from our store.\\" I get that they probably have to say that in order to mitigate liability, but even if they couldn't identify the piece of metal from their store (I'll bet they have a few stainless steel scrubbing sponges in their kitchen), and it got into the food before they received it, it's still absolutely their responsibility and pretty obnoxious to say they can't identify it and ask me to provide my receipt and bring them the metal. I get they have a process they have to follow but finding metal in my mouth was such a disturbing experience and adding to that the burden of proof, just for the outcome of a free meal (which might contain metal again, who knows?) just did not feel right. What if the metal had been in my kids' food and they had swallowed it? A free meal and not taking direct responsibility just doesn't feel right. I feel I should note that the staff here are very nice and the host even gave us a free chocolate milk on this day. Sadly I don't think we will be going to Chipotle anymore. Finding a piece of metal sponge in my mouth is just a deal breaker for me.

I went to the host desk, and put our name in, then headed to the bar. We immediately received a text with a link that showed your position in line to be seated. I thought that was a very useful feature. \\n\\nWhile at the bar, there was a waiter coming around taking orders of the people standing around the bar. I LOVED this concept! It's such a pain to have to reach over people sitting at the bar, and even worse for the people being reached over. Having a waiter take drink orders and bring them out resolved this issue.\\n\\nWe were seated after ab 40 minutes, and our waitress was prompt and friendly. Since it was our first time dining at bartaco, she explained the ordering process and gave more detail about a couple dishes.  We ordered some chips and salsa, then several minutes later we out our order card up filled with a mix of sides, tacos, a tamale and ceviche.  The cucumber salad was simple, but tasty, but the corn was a let down. I also enjoyed the ceviche - it was pretty good. The meat in the tamale was too fatty, and the of the four tacos, nothing was memorable. \\n\\nOverall, I love the vibe of bartaco and the service and service concepts were great, but the food was just ok.

It's an outstanding place to just chill out and have fun at any time or day of the week.  It's a big place with plenty of space, so you won't be bumping into people or scrambling to find a table.  They also have a bar with over 100 beers on tap, and provide food from the legendary Sunset Grill next door.  Most of the food is decent; the pizzas are supposedly top-notch, but I've never tried them. \\n\\nSetting itself apart from most pool halls is the clean look and the fun college atmosphere as opposed to the dark and seedy halls frequented by old timers and pool sharks.  An awesome place for a first date.  Think about it: just take a girl that hasn't really played before to a pool hall.  Get behind her, and move her body around, making sure her stance and her grip on the stick is right.  In case you haven't noticed, that means some free touching around!\\n\\nBesides the atmosphere, this place has a fun vibe for someone looking to catch a game (they have TVs), or even seasoned veterans wanting to hone their skills.  The jukebox there has a good selection of songs if you want to get some \\"pump up jam\\" going!  The bar selection is unbeatable as well.\\n\\nAnd finally, the prices are just right.  If I'm not mistaken, it's possible to get a pitcher of beer and a large pizza for $20, which isn't bad at all.  The game play prices vary, depending on when you come in (day is cheap, night is somewhat up there).  \\n\\nPark your car on either Comm. Ave or Harvard Street and get in on the fun!  You can also risk parking it in the Blanchards parking lot, and pray that it doesn't get towed.

Gotta go try it!\\n\\nSo I surprised my boyfriend with this new place we've never been to. We're always up for trying new things. As I drove down to Congress, I was kinda anxious because I hate trying to find parking down there. Lucky for us, when we arrived @ Hopdoddy, there was a HUGE sign for a parking garage. Oh hallelujah. My prayers have been answered. If only all DT restaurants had complimentary parking garages. \\n\\nMy boyfriend was still confused as to where we were going. When we got inside, I spilled the beans and said that they had a peking duck burger special this week. Sadly, when I looked up @ the specials board, there was no peking duck... So I asked the cashier (very nice lady btw!) and she said noo they ran out. \\n\\nRight as we were about to opt for a plan B, this nice man came up and told the cashier that they had 3 more peking duck burger patties left. OH YAY. Hallelujah times two! It was our lucky night. So my honey ordered the peking duck burger and I got the Llano Poblano. Along w/ our burgers we got the chili cheese fries (Velveeta cheese w/ their special made chili).\\n\\nThe feel of the restaurant was nice and chill. My boyfriend really liked it. I also enjoyed it. I loved the green chairs and dim lighting. Very modern and cute. It was a little confusing at first because we didn't know whether to sit down then order or not but we realized that we order, get our drinks and condiments and they put a number down at a table for us. I really like that concept!\\n\\nAbout 10 minutes after we were waiting, our food came out. It looked SOOOO yummy! I was sick that day so my sense of smell and taste were kinda off (very sad!). Luckily, the food was packed with flavor and I could taste my food. The peking duck burger was moist and juicy and the Hoison barbeque sauce was delicious. Along with the slaw, that burger was a party in my mouth. I would eat it again. My Llano poblano was pretty fantastic too. The burger was plump and juicy and the poblano pepper added a nice touch to my burger. The fries were amazing. I'm kinda picky about my fries. I don't like them too soggy or limp. These fries were perfectly CRUNCHY. The chili cheese dip sauce was yummy, but I love the fries with the chipotle ketchup.\\n\\nMy boyfriend really liked Hopdoddy...

I heard it got popular in New York and then they opened a location in the bougiest (is that even a word) part of town in Buckhead, Atlanta (the neighborhood, not the city Buckhead, GA).  Just on that alone, it never really appealed to me.  \\n\\nThen, I learned that there was a Shake Shack that opened at Perimeter Mall.  I heard they had great burgers and shakes.  So, my mom, she doesn't eat anything too exciting.  When I go out, I ask her if she wants anything, it's usually a response along the lines of \\"go to Cook Out, and get a single burger with tomato and ketchup, with a chocolate shake\\".  I remember one of my birthdays she tried to order that at Flip Burger and the look they gave her.  Oh well, shouldn't be too hard to mess up, right?\\n\\nSo, I took her to Macy's at Perimeter last night (she wanted some boots they didn't have at North Point).  I hadn't eaten dinner yet, so a light bulb went off- lets go to Shake Shack!  So, I went through the food court and didn't see it.  So, I used the Yelp app to look at pics and realized it was one of the store fronts (I had no idea if Shake Shack was fast food or not.  I literally just knew it was from New York, and was popular).\\n\\nSo low and behold, we went up the escalator (and ran into a K9!) and outside.  Right next to Urban Outfitter (which takes up the corner) stood Shake Shack, and there wasn't a line!  I grabbed each of us a menu, and went for it.\\n\\nI noticed, it was slightly pricey, but in the end, it was worth it.  They also have a menu on the wall with some pictures.  I decided to get a chili cheese dog, bacon cheese fries, and a double smoke shack, with water (they have free water on tap and bottles for sale, FYI- so I got both).  Mom got a single shack burger and a peppermint chocolate shake.  It was about $35 for all of it.  We got a buzzer, and sat down.\\n\\nThe place looked modern, with a lot of wood.  The benches (which were made of reclaimed wood in NY) were actually comfortable surprisingly.  They had 3-4 TVs as well.  Shortly after, the buzzer rang, and I got the food.  \\n\\nI went for the fries first.  I tell you what, after eating the disappointing fries from Charley's from a few days ago, I didn't think I would like fries again.  But, these were crunchy, seasoned, and the creamy cheese sauce went along perfectly.  My stomach grumbles as I type this.\\n\\nThen, I went for the chili dog.  Something about their bread- but it is so squishy (in a good way for me).  The chili has like brisket in it, and did not taste like Hormel.  That was a decent chili dog too.\\n\\nAnd then, I had the burger.  It was topped with like peppers, bacon, cheese, and Shack Sauce.  When I bit into it, the bun felt like I was biting into a Wisconsin Buttery from Steak n Shake (one of my all time favorites).  The flavors just kept hitting me from all sides.  The patties reminded me of Freddies, which I enjoyed as I lived out in CO.  \\n\\nMy mom really liked her burger and shake (thank God, she IS picky!)!  So, that was a double score.  Unfortunately, I kept waking up throughout the night, barely getting any sleep.  I shit you not, I couldn't get Shake Shack off my mind!  In fact, I kind of want some right meow, but I know traffic is about to start.  This place needs to become 24/7, I would single handedly keep this place in business- I enjoyed it that much!  I can't wait to go back and actually try some shakes- every one I saw looked awesome!

The restaurant was probably about half full, and we were seated immediately at a round table in a cozy corner. \\n\\nThey have many vegetarian options on the menu, but I feel like those options aren't as flavorful as some of their beef dishes. I was sticking to vegetarian options that night and ordered the Tsel Phaley and the vegetarian momos. \\n\\nThe Tsel Phaley was very interesting. It was basically vegetables and noodles rolled into a spongey-wrap (could almost equate it to an uthappam for anyone familiar with South Indian cuisine). I liked it, but it was pretty oily. This dish is definitely on the smaller side, more of an appetizer.\\n\\nThe vegetarian momos were pretty bland. Luckily, they had given us a few sauces and pickled vegetables which we were able to use to add a little more flavor. Would avoid getting these again. \\n\\nOther folks got the Sha Phaley (bread stuffed with beef), beef momos, and eggplant, which were all acceptable.\\n\\nWe also ordered one Tibetan tea, since some people had never tried it before.

I enjoyed every sip and even ordered a refill despite the fact that i normally do not drink coffee close to 3pm.\\n\\n     As for my little brothers, they picked a cake from the glass known as \\"mayonnaise cake\\".

Coming from a stand near the carousel, this vendor serves spherical pieces of dough covered with icing sugar, butter, syrup and options of banana and chocolate. Similar to Taiwanese bubble waffle and soft crepes, these poffies tasted amazing in both the traditional and banana chocolate variations. I liked them enough to visit twice!\\n\\nMaple Taffy was also very interesting. The man working this vendor takes local maple syrup, lines it on a bed of ice, and beats it into a solid shape before serving it to you. The result is a cold dessert that doesn't stick to your teeth and tastes like Canadian greatness.\\n\\nAnother tradition is the Gluhwein/Apple Cider stand at the market. The traditional apple cider came in a nice collectible mug and came out piping hot which was great for a cold night. It warmed me right through my stomach and I loved being able to add the mug to my collection.\\n\\nI had high hopes for the schnitzel and currywurst which are German favourites.

Think finger-licking kind of good -- you're in a restaurant setting though, so try to hold back. I luckily had a corner seat so I had zero reservations about doing that. The Trio de Empanadas choices are pulled meat, cheese, and black bean. The meat one was incredibly tender and the cheese one tasted like a glorified mozzarella stick. Maybe I would actually watch football if my friends served queso blanco empanadas from Orinoco instead.\\n\\nFor an entree, we shared the Parrilla Caraque√±a (grill plate).

We also got a sauce with it that gave it a really spicy kick so if you like spicy food, ask for the dragon house sauce! The grilled duck kebabs are simply two skewers with alternating apple and duck pieces. But the duck pieces were the most tender and it was a lovely surprise. The flavor was also great - the perfect char. I don't know what is in the wok-charred udon but it smelled amazing and was so flavorful that I took the remaining sauce to go.

It's creative stuff in a casual atmosphere, which as far as I know, still defines what Austin is all about. Right offhand, I can think of a half-dozen restaurants around town where I've dropped more money for half as much fun: What's the point of that? I get that we all go out to eat for different reasons. \\n\\nThe magic of Barley Swine is wondering how they come with different stuff, and what they'll be coming up with next. I'm first to confess that when staff is explaining a plate to me, I hear what they're saying, but nothing really sinks in - I'm pretty much wondering what this particular foam will taste like. Incidentally, the staff here has as much ink and piercings as I've seen in other Austin establishments, but the difference is Barley staff truly enjoy what they're doing, and they're very, very good at it. That means everything. \\n\\nAnd finally, be aware of \\"The Barley Phenomena\\": If there are two of you sitting at the bar - where two of you should be sitting - you'll get a plate and just go at it. That's expected. When there's three or more of you at a table, there's always a moment of hesitation or two before anyone starts in on a plate, sharing might seem awkward, no one wants to be the greedy one, and no one wants to take the last bite of a dish. Hey, that's expected too. Trust me, by the time plates six and seven roll around, your table will be going at it in full force, and every plate will be scraped clean with personal mini-spatulas.

We saw folks walk out they were so frustrated.\\n\\nThat complaint aside, we honest to god love this place. The workers are all so sweet and friendly and the food is healthy and delicious. This time we got halves of the South of the Border and the Alapoopoolala with a mango dessert. We got the former spicy, which it was, and soooooo good: filling, full of greens, and fun. The latter wasn't as exciting, but still great. The mango thing was yummy but nothing special. Portions and prices are completely fair. \\n\\nOnce again we were the only white folks around, but never felt out of place. People in line were so sweet to our daughter and we had fun listening to the music and hanging out. Tassili's is a gem--we were so happy to see them get mentioned in that NYT article on African-American vegetarianism. We will definitely be back the next time that we're in town."},{"name":"Ikenohana","address":"14308 SW Allen Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"I was kind of looking forward to dining here due to the mostly positive Yelp reviews. Came here with a friend on Monday and unfortunately did not have the same experience.

Speaking of babies, there were about 3 or 4 crying babies in such a small restaurant, didn't know this was a family hot spot... \\nAnyway, noticing that not all of them could fit at the table, the waitress came over to OUR table and told us we had to get up and move so they could add the table to the \\"reserved\\" one to make it bigger. This is the SECOND time they asked us to move.... Food took forever to arrive since they are very understaffed and the yakisoba was not dissimilar to the packages you can buy at Albertson's.\\n\\nThe dining experience started out on a very poor note and never recovered, unfortunately cannot say I will be revisiting this spot again.\\n\\n I do not discourage anyone from trying it though, perhaps their experience will be more positive!"},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I'd say I'm a donut connoisseur given I've had them all my life and have tasted the best of them from my pop's store growing up.

I thought the chocolate ganache was okay but not any better than regular chocolate.  I was blown away by the flavors of the blueberry basil.  I'd never had that combo before but those 2 flavors made for a delightful experience in my mouth.  I was also able to try the buttermilk old fashioned that my friend ordered and that was by far the best donut I've ever had.

The trio of empanadas was yummy as was the fried plantains and their homemade cheese sandwich, like a healthier yummier grilled cheese. I wanted their roasted butternut squash soup but they were out. \\n\\nA little upsetting was watching the drama that was going on. The hostess was reprimanded by the bartender (manager?) for not paying attention to customers that came in (the customers proceeded to walk right out). The other waitstaff seemed to have some issues as well with the bartender that night. One of them said to his coworker \\"See? She doesn't give a s***.\\" I think it may be that the wait staff thinks they're cool and trying to give off a cool vibe.

Went on a Wednesday night, got there a little after 7pm, the line was just barely wrapping around the corner of the restaurant, but from the time we waited outside to the time we sat down after ordering our food, it was 8pm, so not too bad. Waiting in line at hoppdody's reminded me of waiting in line at a theme park. There are 3 different lines you must go through. The line outside, and two separate lines inside. Chances are the third line has the longest waiting time, because you can't place your order until the busboy/gal comes to give you your assigned table(ps ask f there is a booth available when they come to give you a table). The system makes sense, this way you don't have a bunch of people with placed orders hanging around waiting for a table to clear up.\\n\\nonto the food. My eating companion and I shared the baby kale salad, which was delicious, and the green chili queso with fries. The fries by themselves were nothing amazing, but slathered with queso and dipped in their chipotle ketchup, they were pretty darn good. I got the llano poblano burger and a caramel and sea salt shake. Both were delicious, although the shake was so sweet, but with the savory flavors of the fries and burger it was ok. The other person I was with got the burger special, a salmon miso burger which they enjoyed very much. We were both left very satisfied, but so so full.\\n\\nIs hopdoddy's completely overrated? yes, but the food is pretty good, certainly worth checking out at least once. if you come here on a weekday, before 7pm or not that long after, you won't have to wait too long"},{"name":"Buffet Palace","address":"4608 West Gate Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I seem to remember the food being better - got there right at 11 and the food was kind of bland. very big selection of choices, but overall somewhat of a letdown."},{"name":"Santarpio's Pizza","address":"111 Chelsea St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The reason I am giving one star to this \\"famous\\" place is because the quality of the product is simply not there anymore.

Fried jalape√±os, bacon, guacamole, grilled onions and a spicy mayo with nice flat top grilled burger and a good bun. This is right up my alley. I'd have like it to have been a bit spicier but the burger, as a whole, was so tasty. The guys in the kitchen were churning it out despite the fans that were barely doing anything.

Negative posts aren't my deal and, usually if my experience is sub-par, I just go elsewhere next time around and move on with my life. Dragging down the public ratings of an establishment over one experience seems douche-y to me and I actually think this place could do better. It's not irreparably tarnished in my eyes and I was interested in helping, not Yelping, so I intended to email the management, not write this review. But, since they don't offer an email on their site (or much else), here I am. I can see from reading other reviews of SWK that the management does seem to genuinely pay attention and care about the sentiment posted here, so guys I hope this illuminates some things (most of which are easy fixes). \\nHubby and I came in last Saturday, smack in the middle of the dinner hour, to find the place virtually empty. After walking by this place (and somehow resisting the insanely alluring aroma of smoked meats, treats, and siren's call of a robust whiskey collection) for at least a year, I finally convinced him that we NEEDED to come here. Okay, I didn't have to try that hard to woo him into walking in. \\"Whiskey\\" and \\"meat\\". I said those words and he grunted approval. That was, alas, the beginning and the end of agreeableness on this dinner date.  \\nDespite the tumbleweeds and echos, our hostess answered our request for a more intimate booth along the wall instead of a tiny table in the middle of the bar area, with an incredulous eye-roll and dramatic sigh more fitting (though still rude as hell) for a bustling, hustling, dinner rush server trying to keep up with it all. We, virtually the only patrons and likely the only people she'd seen since she last refreshed her Instagram feed in the corner, were apparently out of line and entirely too demanding. Little Miss Laconic, after snatching up the menus from the original tiny table, stalked over to the other side of the bar, threw down the menus on the table we had the gall to ask for, and stomped off. \\nWe had a chuckle of the childishness of the whole scene (we have toddlers, we are accustomed to such displays) and were ready to wash it away with whiskey. But first. Appetizers! A glance at the small plates section was all it took to decide that, in a place that promises a mind-blowing menagerie of house-made, house-smoked, and handcrafted eats, that the pork rinds would do nicely while we poured over the whiskey menu. Surely, these tasty little chicharrones would be fresh, warm, and obviously from the same kitchen (and perhaps same pigs) that this place was trying to convince us it laboriously and lovingly prepared each menu item. Nope. Who even knows if this dried out, bland bucket of \\"pork\\" dust was ever in the kitchen. My guess is that it lived a sad, dark life encased in a Costco-sized bag in the storage room next to the paper products. That is when we started to suspect that, while the whiskey menu was impressive (despite the fact that our server, sweet but completely clueless and inattentive, knew absolutely nothing about any of the whiskey listed), the food menu might be lacking. And it was. There is, for the record, nothing wrong with pork rinds from a bag. I enjoy them frequently and find they pair well with cheap beer, camping, car trips. You know, they are what they are. Nothing special. And the fact that these tried and true, typical snacks were how we began our meal set the tone for what was to follow. Nothing was awful. But nothing was special. A rare steak was a rare steak. No nice sear marks or crust to show any amount of aging or even a knowledge of meat grilling was applied. The smoked trout was as described. Nothing more and nothing less. Sides were lackluster and didn't even try to impress. Collard greens were sauteed at some point with no discernible spices and it was only a week ago but I don't remember what the other sides were. They were the culinary equivalent of a shoulder shrug and a 'meh'. After all this meh-ness, I was determined to find something on the menu that would at least redeem me and change the disappointed look on my dining companion's face that even whiskey wasn't washing away. I ordered the cornbread. It was cute in its little cast iron pan and the accompanying butter was palatable (maybe even made in the actual kitchen) enough that we silently fought over how best to spread it over the remnants of our other sides that were too sad to mention. \\nI know I said that negative reviews aren't my thing and I think they are douche-y. And here I am, with a tome of terribleness about SWK. Why? The service. I can forgive food that is boring. Especially if I have good booze, I can forgive damn near anything.

The highlight of this dish were the sweet peppers which had a refreshing, crisp aftertaste. \\n\\nThe night cap was a satisfying churros con chocolata, piping warm churros dipped into a pool of melted chocolate. It's a favorite in Madrid and hard to find in Atlanta!\\n\\nService\\n\\nAs everyone else has already mentioned - it's excellent. No complaints. \\n\\nBottom Line: Bartaco is a fantastic new addition to the burgeoning Westside seen with a great atmosphere, delicious food, and A+ service.

I was very impressed with the service and food. We were seated at a long table in a beautiful private room. One of the doors to the room was by the kitchen, and we were allowed to close it enough to shut off the kitchen noise. Our  waitress was excellent. She was friendly and efficient and kept our large group's orders and bills straight, while making it look easy. She was a nice young lady with pretty blonde hair braided in the back. The rest of the wait staff also gave us great service, filling our water glasses and clearing our plates in a timely manner. The food was delicious. I had vegetable samosas, naan, and Bengan Bartha, an eggplant dish that had just the right amount of spices. Our waitress even took pictures of our group for us at the end of the meal. I want to go back soon and have that same dish again, too!  The evening was quite enjoyable, and if you are planning a party for a large group, I recommend Clay Pit."},{"name":"Buffet Palace","address":"4608 West Gate Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"The best Chinese buffet in Austin.

On my way to the bathroom (I like this mural :)), I overheard a server tell his table that Otto had previously worked as the head chef at the Benson for a number of years, and that he and his wife make absolutely EVERYTHING in the restaurant.  Otto works the grill, Anita makes the desserts, and they make the sauces daily, in the time between lunch and dinner.  All things I like to hear!\\nI had the Jaegerschnitzel, which is a pork schnitzel with a mushroom sauce, vegetables, and spaetzle.  I was skeptical about the title (Jaeger and I do not get along after past betrayals, and I'm immediately suspicious of anything with it in the title), but this was quite good: tender, and mushroomy to perfection.  However, the veggies and spaetzle were just okay--I've had better spaetzle at the other german restaurants in town.  I was too full for dessert, but next time I'll plan my meal a bit better, as they looked fantastic :).  Somebody else on here raved about the coconut cake, so that's first on my list to try! \\nEverybody else in the party (I think we were about 18-23, give or take) really enjoyed their food, as well.  The fact that everybody's food came out in a reasonable amount of time indicates that this is a well-run kitchen!  If you're a vegetarian, this might not be the place for you, as, while there are veggie options (salads, etc), probably the meat dishes are where it's at. \\nThe entire restaurant is covered in bavarian-inspired murals and quaint vintage decorations.  It's a little shabby and dark, but not in a bad way--more like it was well-loved than neglected.  When I went to Otto & Anita's, it was with a big, random group of ex-patriot South Africans for their monthly We-live-in-a-foreign-country-so-let's-get-together get-together.  They're a laid back group, and always fun.  However, it's hard to find a good venue to regularly host their laid-back-ness, and Otto & Anita's was very accommodating with their banquet room this month.  Bonus points for that, and I have to commend our server: she was really great--the whole group was coming and going and needed separate checks (really, a server's worst nightmare), but she handled it gracefully, professionally, and with a smile on her face.  You, you deserve a server's medal!

We shared our experience with a friend who used to live in the area who confirmed that this is one of the best places in the neighborhood.  Unlike some restaurants in this district, they take reservations which is most desirable given the small size of the place.  The restaurant is very cozy and reminds me of being in Italy.  The food was outstanding, both in quality and presentation.  We particularly enjoyed the bruschetta and the pan seared scallops over black fettuccine.  The service was also very good.

Figuring this was the sign of a quality taco stand, I decided to drop in this afternoon. I knew things didn't look good when I attempted to order. I asked for a pescado entortillado taco, a pollo asado taco with a side of salsa, and a small horchata. The cashier got hung up on my request for salsa. Our exchange was straight out of Idiocracy:\\n\\nMe: Can I have a side of salsa please?\\nCashier: What?\\nMe: A side of salsa?\\nCashier: For what?\\nMe: To put on the taco...\\nCashier: Uh...yeah, ok...\\n\\nThe pollo asado taco was excellent by itself. The chicken was seared perfectly and there was a decent amount of it stuffed into the flour tortilla. But then I added the salsa and it went south. I expected the dark salsa to have a smoky flavor, but it had no flavor. The closest I can compare it to is Mrs. Renfro's: nice color, but runny without flavor.\\n\\nWhen I was a kid there was a Mexican lady in the neighborhood who would make horchata from scratch every weekend. She would serve it out of one of those big glass beehive-looking things you can occasionally find in Mexican restaurants. Ahh, cinnamonny rice milk goodness. My nostalgia was shattered with the first sip of El Chilito's horchata. It was very watery, with only the slightest hint of cinnamon. Their horchata tasted like they picked up a mix from Fiesta and added too much water to it.\\n\\nBut the deal breaker was the pescado entortillado taco. I bit into it and the first thing I tasted was breading - and grease. As I took more bites and my disappointment deepened, it occurred to me that I may as well have been eating a Mrs. Paul's fish stick wrapped in a tortilla. Then I looked down to see the jalapeno alioli sauce streaming from the taco onto the concrete. Alioli is not supposed to be thick, but it shouldn't be runny either.\\n\\nAs I watched my fish taco pee in my hand, I thought of a comparison a friend had made between El Chilito and Taco Deli. He said that their prices are comparable for what you get. I'll give him that. He also said that both establishments' tacos make great laxatives, since he could count on a bowel explosion within thirty minutes of having consumed one.\\n\\nI've managed to make it through the day without an assruption, but the disappointment of El Chilito lingers. I would give the place one and a half stars for a decent chicken taco if I could. Two stars seem generous."},{"name":"Model Caf√©","address":"7 N Beacon St","city":"Allston","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is ridiculous.  Cheap as hell in every regard.

Donuts are one of those things where, when enough time has passes, I always manage to convince myself that maybe I am actually a fan and just haven't tried the right donut. Then I get one and remember: yep, still too sweet. \\n\\nWith that huge caveat in mind, here's my review of Blue Star. With the recommendation of a worker, I got the passion fruit donut with cocoa nibs. I liked how fruity it tasted, but also found the glaze to be too sweet, even when eaten with coffee.\\n\\nI've tried the PB&J before and, being a huge fan of all things peanut butter, I enjoyed it. I did end up scraping out excess marionberry jam filling in an attempt to make it less sweet. (I know, sacrilegious!) I liked the donut but wished I could've shared with someone; I could feel my blood sugar levels crashing by the end of it as I came down from a sugar high. :)\\n\\nAt $3-$4 for most donuts, Blue Star is definitely more expensive, but if you want a high quality donut made with eclectic ingredients, this is it.

And the fried pickles were winners as well.  So much so that we ordered a second serving.\\n\\n*Sigh* But the rest of it.  Meh.  I ordered the skirt steak...that was unfortunate.  I ordered it medium, but it arrived on the far side of medium well.

Not so much on this occasion.  I may have taken 2 or 3 bites before I made the executive decision to end my suffering and just stop eating it.  The risotto that it was served with was only palatable once I added some (okay, A LOT) of salt.\\n\\nOverall, not a great experience.  I like the concept, but the execution could be better.

We got there somewhat late on a weeknight, and a bartender told us to head to the back to order. Once we got to the back, those people told us to sit at a table for waiter service. We went back to the front and picked a table, but no one seemed to notice we were there for maybe 10 minutes. Then the waiter asked if we'd ordered at the back, and it was all just very confusing. It got sorted out eventually, but I could see that being a problem if we'd come at a busier time. \\n\\nI got the tuna burger and the bf got the classic. The classic was pretty good, and it was appropriately named.  The tuna burger was another story, though. I kind of assumed it was going to be a tuna steak that was seared but still quite rare, as it said \\"sushi-grade tuna.\\" The waiter confirmed that it was served rare, which was the whole reason I got it. It was actually ground tuna, and it was not very rare at all. The outside had no sear on it, but was cooked through enough that it was kinda chewy. The amount of tuna used in that patty was just way too big for the size of the bun. It was also very runny...not in the good, juicy kind of way. The nori chips on top and the wasabi \\"mustard\\" were both delicious, though. \\n\\nThey seem like they are aiming to be local and seasonal and environmentally conscious and so on, and yet they served me water in a plastic cup, even though I was a dine-in customer. I thought that was pretty wasteful, and I wish I'd had the option of a reusable glass. \\n\\nThe bf got the milkshake, also served in plastic (though he did order after dinner, so maybe they assumed he'd take it to go). He got chocolate, and it was not very good, sadly. Whatever chocolate they used had a very high acid content and it ended up tasting like vinegar.  It was also $6. \\n\\nThe buildout of the restaurant was pretty nice, all dark metal and low lighting. Quite different from Cissi's, anyway. They only have high tables, though, which is not very ADA-friendly (sometimes I think about these things).\\n\\nI assume that they will improve as they age, but only time will tell."},{"name":"El Chilito","address":"2225 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Never had a bad experience at this place!\\n\\nAnd you can buy jars of the delicious salsa to take home!\\n\\nNot the best breakfast tacos in town, but they're up there. \\n\\nFor lunch, I like the burritos.

But I digress.  \\n\\nWhile I was never a huge fan of Cin Cin (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/cincin-ristorante-bar-vancouver-3#hrid:koHxzGzqybbmaHZHYg9bqw) as a restaurant for a full meal, I used to enjoy popping in and sitting at the bar to have dessert when Thierry Busset was the pastry chef there.  He had a good pedigree, having been the pastry chef at two three Michelin starred restaurants in London, but didn't have the restaurant put off any of that star chef mentality or attitude.  He just quietly delivered consistently excellent desserts which made it a lovely spot to stop in for dessert after dinner elsewhere.  When he left, I stopped going in as the dessert program suffered.  \\n\\nOne of my old favourites from back in the good old days at Cin Cin was his chocolate tart.  Well, Thierry Busset is back.  And so is his delicious chocolate tart - hooray!  \\n\\nHis new spot, named simply Thierry, does put off a bit more marketing hype than before including the obligatory quote from Gordon Ramsay saying he is, \\"one of the finest pastry chefs in the world.\\"  I call BS on the marketing, but damn his chocolate tart is good.\\n\\nThe new space is a casual one focused on pastry, chocolate, and coffee.  You order at the counter and if it is something more complex they give you a number and bring it to your table.  \\n\\nThe chocolate tart caught my eye, as it was my old favourite, and I just had to get a slice.  This is a decadent slice of chocolate goodness.  Don't let the size fool you, with the richness it is more than adequate as a portion.  It is priced on the high side at a bit over $7 for a slice, but makes for a nice treat - and a much better value than the two tacos for $10 at a food truck not too far away (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/tacofino-vancouver#hrid:Uu9E7xE3Rl7LvnwJpPW2Kg).

Yet, it was oddly poetic that the restaurant to surpass it was owned by the same person.\\n\\nPunjab Palace has the same incredible food as India Quality, but it surpasses it in the ambiance and delivery options.  Much of the menu is actually identical - I ordered my usual go-to items (chana masala and baingan bhartha) and was pleasantly surprised to have it be the same recipe.  The only item that I was devastated to not see on the menu was the broccoli naan that I usually order at IQ - yes, I know, it might not be an authentic Indian item, but I love it all the same.  PLEASE bring it to PP!!!\\n\\nAnother amazing aspect of Punjab Palace was the the facility AND restrooms were immaculately clean (IQ is a bit more dodgy).  For the holidays, PP was lit with adorable snowflakes and holiday decorations.  It made it feel warm and inviting.  The ambiance is also slightly less formal than IQ - there is a tv playing Indian music videos and you don't need to be as nervous about minding your manners.  The slightly more casual atmosphere allows you to feel more relaxed.  The service is also fantastic - all of the waitstaff is extremely attentive.  \\n\\nDon't forget that the delivery option is a huge advantage for PP.

If you come here, you will probably enjoy what you get. So why the somewhat mixed rating? Simply because I wasn't altogether impressed. Considering the amount of positive reviews this place has, I expected a lot more. Blue Star Donuts probably wouldn't even make it in my \\"Top 5 donut shops\\" list, and it definitely doesn't hold a candle to Voodoo Doughnuts.\\n\\nMy biggest gripe with Blue Star is the lack of variety. Before I went in, I looked up some photos of their donuts online to get a good idea of what I wanted to order. When I went in, I was dismayed to find that all of the flavors I was interested in weren't available on that particular day. I went right around 7:30 A.M., so it's not that they were sold out, it's that they have a limited amount of flavors they make per day and they change their flavors on a daily basis. I've never been a fan of the \\"revolving door\\" format restaurants occasionally use because there are never any guarantees that what you want will actually be there. The simple act of going to a donut shop turns into a crapshoot where there's a possibility you will walk out with a dozen of your favorite donuts, or there's a possibility you'll hate everything you see and walk out empty-handed.\\n\\nAs for the choice of flavors, most of them seem to be fruit-related (blueberry, lemon, etc.) It's a nice contrast to Voodoo Doughnuts (whose modus operandi is \\"stack as many sweets as humanly possible onto a donut\\"), and I can see why some would prefer the more back-to-basics approach, but it personally wasn't my cup of tea. The first time I visited, there were no donuts with chocolate on them. Perhaps it's because I'm a gluttonous slob, but chocolate is an absolute must for me and to not even have the option seems criminal. Fortunately, there was a donut with chocolate on it the second time I went, but there was only one to choose from (compare that to the many different varieties of choclatey donuts found at Voodoo and you can see why I was disappointed.)\\n\\nThe positive for this place is that there aren't any outrageously long lines (or at least there weren't any when I went) and it's a fairly sizable building where you can actually sit down and eat it there if you feel inclined. If you're ever in the area, it's a nice place where you can stop by for a snack, eat, and leave within 15 minutes (unlike Voodoo where you have to wait 50 minutes before you can even get in.) However, the lack of certainty is too big of a deciding factor for me. This place occasionally has some great flavors, and I would love to try the Valrhona Chocolate Crunch, but what's the point of going if I know it probably won't even be there?"},{"name":"Frontier Public House","address":"4909 NE Hazel Dell Ave","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Everything on the menu looked great.

Closer to the date of our reservation, we heard from the manager that we would be charged a fixed price for our meals, which would include a selection of appetizers shared family-style but not including any extras we ordered, like drinks or dessert, and not including taxes and gratuity.  Fine, we thought.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, we found \\"our\\" menu charmingly printed for us (kind of like when you go to a wedding).  We each chose our dishes, had our apps. delivered, and began enjoying ourselves.  \\n\\nThen things got sticky.  The manager came to tell us that because we had changed our original party size (we had fewer people than our original reservation), we would each be required to pay more than the original amount, as that amount was calculated based on a larger party size.

The medium-well burger was charcoaled and my tomato salad (while it was a very pretty presentation) was a bit bland. \\n\\nWhile there's definitely potential to the menu, it seemed like Pier Six wasn't exactly sure who they wanted to be.. will they be a upscale seafood restaurant, or more of a tavern?

The \\"barbacoa\\" is not traditional by any means, it's more like shredded brisket and the carnitas are usually overly salty.  (This goes for all Chipotles, not just this location.)

We ordered the garlic naan, lamb korma, and chana paneer masala all of which were very good and reasonably priced (~$14 per entree). The lamb was very tender in a creamy sauce, and the paneer was quite good to the point where I wish there had been a little more in the dish. I think they had forgotten about our naan because it didn't come out with all of the other dishes and we had to ask for it again halfway through our meal, but I'm glad we did because it was piping hot and fresh.

There was no winning with these extroverted people, so I ended up Orinoco.\\nWell, I really had no regrets afterwards. I was actually HAPPY and GRATEFUL to them that we went out. There were very few people in the restaurant because of the snow, so we felt like we had the whole place to ourselves.\\nPros: fun ambience and decor; GREAT food (I especially recommend the seared tuna, arepas, and empanadas)\\nCon: the sangria tasted REALLY good, but it really doesn't feel like an alcoholic beverage. So, if you're looking to get buzzed... or tipsy... or drunk, the sangria won't do it for you.

The ambiance and service were good. The crowd was old. (It felt a little like a party at a retirement center.) The soup stood out, nothing was bad, though I do not understand why they use so much butter on green vegtables and potatoes.

It's a shame, because the food is excellent!  I don't understand why so many reviewers compare this to the restaurants in Chinatown, because it's apples and oranges.  I doubt that you would find Asian-influenced tacos or chicken and waffles in Chinatown.  M+C is pan Asian fusion, inspired by a variety of Asian cuisines, but adding a modern twist.  It's what P.F. Chang's should have been.  Although the food at Myers and Chang isn't traditional, it's not the watered-down Americanized Chinese food that you find at restaurants outside of Chinatown.\\n\\nThe staff is great - always pleasant, usually fun, and a bit silly (in a good way).  But don't let the silliness fool you, customer service is very important here.  They're attentive, and I like that they remember me, even if I haven't been in for a few weeks.

For some reason, it took the waitress ten minutes to bring out our beverages, and after she did, she left without taking our meal orders to chat-up some patrons at another table.\\n\\nWhen our server finally returned, we all placed our orders -- 5 burgers cooked medium-rare, and 1 sliced steak.  Simple.  The students were excited, as I had already hyped up the tantalizing taste of these filet mignon burgers to them, having visited Ring Side several times in the past.\\n\\nIt took awhile, but our food finally arrived, and we each cut into our burgers, only to discover that every single medium-rare had been cooked to medium to medium-well!  How is that acceptable in a steakhouse? Being shy college students, none of them wanted to complain, so I was the only person who requested my burger be sent back.  I actually had to wait another five to ten minutes before I could inform our waitress, since she again, was chatting away at another table.\\n\\nI did appreciate the quick response to my request of receiving a burger cooked the way I had ordered, and the waitress came by to check on me, shortly after the kitchen delivered my new burger (even though checking on your customers in a timely manner is what I consider a standard service expectation).\\n\\nThe burgers themselves were delicious.  A half-pound of juicy, tender beef, placed between buttered and toasted sweet buns, and topped with Bibb lettuce, a hearty slice of tomato, sliced red onions, and sweet and crunchy pickles.  This paired with crunchy, homemade kettle chips (and my Fireman's Four) made the Happy Hour deal all the more satisfying.\\n\\nAt the end, our waitress came, dropped off the check, and then hurriedly came back to pick up the signed copy and left, without even saying thanks or come again!

However, last night I experienced some really bad service.  My friend and I came in a little before six in the evening.  We were going to the 7:00 Thorns game and I was obviously dressed to attend the game, so it was fairly obvious that I would need to be out of there at a certain time.  I knew beforehand that the place would be crowded, but I had told my friend about the place and she wanted to try it out.  It was crowded, but there were only a couple people ahead of us, so we decided to wait.  About ten minutes in, a table cleared up and the people ahead of us were seated.  Then another table cleared up.  And another.  And another.  We stood there as a total of six tables were vacated and no one said a word or made an attempt to clear the tables and seat us.  Granted, there was one person behind the bar and one person in the front, but two things really annoyed me.  First, the person in the front didn't ever acknowledge the fact that we were waiting and staring at all these empty tables.  Second, what she was doing during that time was specifically catering to the big table in the middle, obviously full of regulars.  And when I say catering, I mean doing things like making their drinks (isn't that what the bartender is for?) and clearing the empty plates from their table (Hey! There are six empty tables that need clearing - I think they can hang out with their empty plates for a while!)  Then I watched her walk behind the bar and put on lip gloss, come back out and clear more empty plates from the big table.  After at least 15 minutes of standing in front of empty tables with not even a word from her, we finally just walked out, as did several people who were in line behind us.  I hope those people at the big table are really good customers, because if that kind of service is happening all the time, I imagine those are the only customers that will continue to go there.

It's a nice place to watch soccer games that are only aired on Telemundo or Univision.\\n\\nThe food here is mostly OK, but what do you expect, everything is super cheap and huge portions. The tamales are huge with lots of meat and really dense masa. The masa just doesn't have that nice lightness that good tamales have. Surprisingly though, the tamales do have that smoky corn flavor from the corn leaves they're wrapped in. My least favorite item on the menu is the chilaquiles, which is always greasy. This dish is bound to be somewhat greasy because the tortilla chips are deep fried before they're cooked in salsa, but not this greasy. They must not let the oil drain very well right after frying. I also would not order the chile relleno, which contains really oily ground beef, topped with melted processed cheese. On the other hand, their fajitas are pretty decent, with fresh bell peppers and sharp onions. The beef is tender and well seasoned with a good amount of cumin and red pepper. The flan is small but very creamy and egg-y (although some of my friends don't like that it tastes so much like egg). The chips are fresh and the salsa is always very good. They keep replenishing these items while you wait for your meal, which is dangerous if you're really hungry and impatient.\\n\\nThe service is always great, no matter how busy it gets (and it's always very busy for dinner on the weekends). The restaurant accommodates to large parties and has outdoor seating. The waiters are attentive, funny, and they remember your face.

A couple buddy's and I went here last night at around 8 o'clock. We pull up and there is no place to park. That's understandable considering the fact that this place is located just east of downtown. We walk in and it takes 5 minutes before one of the waitresses even recognizes our presents. She asks for our order and was nice. However, it was her first day on the job and was constantly confused which is acceptable. We place our order but the cash register was not working. So we had to explain our order about 4 times so that she could type it in and then have it deleted again. This is one of those times where it's best just to write it on a piece of paper and hand it to the cook. Meanwhile, we are sitting down waiting for our to-go order and 30 minutes have passed. Did I mention she asked for a tip on a to-go order that lasted as long as it did??? What doesn't make any since is that the chicken tenders and sides are already pre made and all that had to be done was put it in a to go tray. It was as if the cooks were playing a game of \\"who goosed the moose\\" in the kitchen. So after a long 30 min without any kind of drink, we were given our food. This is what threw me over, was that the manager said that since we got our food to-go we had to leave.

The restaurant has been around for many years, and she wanted to see how the food was now. Parking is quite packed in the front, but you'll easily find free parking in the neighbourhoods.\\n\\nThe interior is quite big and on a Friday night, the place was only half filled. Decor is a bit dated and there's the whole wedding decor going on.\\n\\nMy mom chose the restaurant mostly because they had the set menu feature going on for $98 for the whole table. The serving is supposed to be for 4-6 people, so since we had 5 people, it was perfect. The menu started off with their Daily Soup, which was watercress and pork soup. Not my favourite since I'm not a fan of watercress, but the soup came in a ceramic jar and the soup had been double-boiled.\\n\\nThe set menu allowed you to choose between either lobster or Peking Duck cooked in two ways. We opted for the latter and the first course was the typical Peking Duck Wraps. The duck itself was crispy and had a good ratio of fat and meat. However, the wraps were a huge disappointment. They were covered in flour, and I had to dust it off before I ate since I felt like I was just eating raw flour. The shrimp chips were also quite soggy.\\n\\nThe second Peking Duck dish was the meat stir-fried with vegetables. I enjoyed the meat, but I thought the dish was rather bland.\\n\\nYou then get to choose three dishes from their menu. The first item my mom chose was the Braised Chinese Mushroom with Vegetables. Quite average, and nothing mind blowing. Again, we noticed that the flavours at this restaurant is more bland. Not necessarily a bad thing, since it's probably more healthy, but taste-wise it wasn't as appealing.\\n\\nThe second was my favourite Braised Egg Tofu. It came with snap peas and mushrooms. The tofu was silky smooth inside, but again, I've had better elsewhere.\\n\\nLastly, we got the Salt and Peppery Fried Pork Chop, which was the tastiest by far because of the garlic chips and chili peppers. And of course, because fried food is always tasty! The pork chops were fried crispy and there was a good amount of meat on each piece.\\n\\nDinner finishes off with Taro Sago Dessert, but we found white bits in it, which we think might've been milk powder that wasn't dissolved properly. Kind of gross in my opinion...\\n\\nOverall, I thought Golden Swan was below average. Price is good, but the execution of the dishes just isn't there. I feel like most of the diners who come here are just longtime regulars.\\n\\nPros:\\n- Prices are reasonable\\n- Large portions\\n\\nCons:\\n- Food is average to below average\\n- Sloppy presentation"},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place is pretty scene-y.

I had the turkey burger (pretty good) and the sweet potato tots (still thinking about these, weeks later).\\n\\nThe food was better than I expected; I figured it would be overhyped. Prices were reasonable.

Entrees with no ketchup or tobasco. When we asked for the third thing (which we never should have needed to ask for), he made a comment that we were running him ragged.

I guess we went at an off time (5:45pm on a Sunday) because there was no wait.   \\n\\nWe shared an order or the Jamaica jerk chicken wings and they were amazing. The portion was large and the (mostly) drumsticks were enormously plump but not at all fatty. They seriously tasted like they were cooked outside on a grill in someone's back yard. They came with a nice fruity dipping sauce, but I actually found it unnecessary.  \\n \\nMy Nicoise salad was one of the best I've had in a long time. Maybe even the best in Boston? The tuna was seared and rare inside just how I like it. The eggs were boiled perfectly so the yolk didn't crumble the second I touched it. The green beans had the right amount of crunch. They even skip the potatoes here (which I think are unnecessary in a salad). The spicy wasabi aioli they added was a nice touch and the olives were pitted - you'd be surprised how many places don't do this. There was maybe a little too much dressing but that's my only (very minor) complaint.\\n\\nThe man loved his meat loaf sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy. It was traditional comfort food (in sandwich form) for Sunday dinner. I guess some would say that maybe $12 is a lot of money for a sandwich - but it's not really.

There they had some tortillas next to scrambled eggs with onions, potatoes and herbs for seasoning mixed in. Cheese diced onions and crumbled bacon bits as well to construct a breakfast burrito, Next door some home fries, biscuits and sausage gravy. \\nDown the line where you usually find their sweet baked goods were some muffins, a Mexican breakfast bake (which was pretty damn tasty actually) and some cheese focacia. \\nAt the end where you find the pasta, they had a Mediterranean breakfast selection as well as regular scrambled eggs. \\nLastly, there was a made to order omelet station.\\nNo bacon or sausage links, no toast or hash browns.

You'll find a number of pre-packaged items as well as fresh treats behind the counter.  It's everything an urban bake shop should be.  You'll find downtown workers in the early morning grabbing breakfast, and tons to young people, tourists, and regulars on weekends.  In other words, expect it to be busy because it's good.  1 Star.\\n\\nService - When it's crowded, it gets hectic.  They have a number of staff members taking orders, but there really isn't a system.  What we figured out (finally), is you put in an order, and then they place your items by the register.  If you want more items, someone else might help you, but will still put your stuff by the register.  When you check out, you recall what you ordered and they ring you up.  Not super-efficient, and can be confusing when very busy.   1/2 Star.\\n\\nFood - You'll find in house chocolates, macaroons, nougat, cakes, pies, coffee, tea...in other words, you'll find some amazing items here.  Chocolate cakes, tarts, tiramisu, pies, all delicately crafted.  Or favorites were the dark chocolates, fruit tart, and tiramisu.  The one major complaint here is they can only make so much.  Meaning late night visits will limit you to what's left from the day.  The restock throughout the day, but your favorite item may not be available on the next visit.

At this location I've been told things I've never heard of like I can't have extra rice and that it's $1.40 for extra cheese when they only gave me a few shreds to begin with. Every time I ask for double meat they just put a few more cubes on. I ask for DOUBLE for a reason, not just to get a little bit more and then get charged for double. I've contacted Chipotle about these issues and they wrote back and basically told me that this is a special location because some customers try to take advantage of extra items in their burritos so they have to be stingy with all customers. This is a terrible business tactic. Chipotle has a few bad customers so they treat their loyal customers who have been coming in for years like they are trying to take advantage of them.\\n\\nAlso, they can't handle high volume. They don't seem to care that the line is long or try to work faster or add an additional worker to the line to speed up the process. It takes much longer than other Chipotles. I've tried ordering on the app to avoid the long wait times but they are even more stingy with the ingredients when you're not there while they're making it and have done things like not given me extra chicken even though I requested it and paid for it. Also, I have ordered it a couple hours in advance but indicated my pickup time. Even though I arrived a little early my burrito was cold. Room temperature.\\n\\nWhen I complained to Chipotle a second time they did give me a coupon for a free item, but that's not what I want. I want them to treat me like I've always been treated at every other Chipotle.\\n\\nI'm a little embarrassed to say that I still eat here. All the time. It makes me angry every time I walk in and know what I'm going to have to deal with, but I'm addicted to the food. This location is so close to my apartment so I go here instead of driving an additional 20 minutes round trip to go to the one by Emory (which is a much better Chipotle).\\n\\nI also have to say that there are a few great employees who always recognize me and make me feel like a welcomed, valued customer.

Once our new waiter brought our order, we explained that it was the queso compuesto, which was more expensive and more than what we ordered. He stated that it was fine (which we took as a compensation to the long wait time). Also, my friend requested 1 or 2 olives for her drink, which the waiter forgot. Once he was reminded about it, he brought a cup full of olives (another compensation for the wait). When the bill came, we were charged almost $10 for the queso and $1.75 for the olives. After explaining the issue to the waiter and politely requesting that the bill be adjusted to reflect what we ordered, he got the manager. The manager refused to adjust the bill also, saying that the 1st waitress wasn't there to acknowledge her mistake when placing the order. By the way, we hadn't eaten the extras that came with the queso and they were obviously not eaten on the table). When I said I'd pay for what I ordered only, the manager got APD officers that were already outside for a previous issue. The officer agreed with me, but said the manager wasn't willing to cooperate, therefore if we didn't pay we'd be charged with theft of service.

We ordered lemonade so you wouldn't think it would take that long but that is neither here nor there. \\n\\nWhen she comes back to our table with the drinks, we place our orders.

She then realizes that we have no drinks left, we had even drunk the ice that had melted into water. Brings back two drinks and then scurries away.

Tell her no, I can't eat this now, I won't eat it later. \\"Was there something wrong with it?\\" Told her that I had ordered mid-rare and this is quite obviously well done, then prove it by picking up the burger and tapping it against the plate, making the clinking sound of WAY overcooked meat.  \\"Oh\\" and walks away. Never apologized, never asked if I wanted something else. Nothing. No response other than \\"oh\\". She returns with the check and said that they took the burger off the bill and then walks away again.  \\n\\nI am a grown up. I understand that sometimes, things happen.

Sometimes, Mercury is in retrograde and a ninja just killed your pa and you have to work four jobs to support your grieving mother and you get to those jobs walking barefoot, in the snow, uphill both ways.  Ignoring a table and not following up on them is unacceptable. Maybe management needs a more hands on approach. Maybe this entire restaurant needs a sternly worded Come to Jesus talk.

Once when I called to order, I switched my usual meal up a little, ordering a different type of fried rice, and a few minutes later they called me back just to verify the order-taker didn't make a mistake, because someone there realized that my order was slightly off from usual.\\n\\nThe other thing to mention about the ordering process, that separates it from most ethnic restaurants, is that there are no communication problems. The orders are always placed easily, and I don't have to repeat my address a bunch of times.\\n\\nFinally to the food. Everything I and my friends have tried has been excellent, but I would like to call attention to the dumplings. They are outstanding. The only restaurant that makes better dumplings is Yangtze River (in Littleton and Lexington). Fortune Corner's are very very close to being as good, which puts them way above the bland dumplings at every other restaurant."},{"name":"Sinha Brazilian Steak House","address":"13586 Village Park Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Good food but later in the day the meat is a little over cooked.

I tried 2 whites and 2 reds.  The wines were terrible.  I kept my mouth shut, but my friends commented on how bad the wines were.  After waiting at the bar for over an hour, we learned the hostess lost our reservation.  I am not sure how you lose a reservation, but she did.  We finally were seated 20 minutes later.  The hostess \\"comped\\" us an appetizer which was tasty.  My wife had a homemade pasta dish which was good.  I had a flat steak which tasted like propane.  Not good and it was cold to boot.

The menu was limited to 5 items as there were a lot of people at the hotel for the conference and I guess they were afraid of a rush. It was noon, and I was literally the only person in the entire place. I ordered a basil pesto pizza. Even though I was the only patron and they were using a limited menu, it took 30 min to get there and was swimming in grease. I considered walking out, but I was hungry at this point. I wish I hadn't eaten it. I feel super nauseous right now from all the oil, and I'm praying I don't vomit on the plane. The food is pretentious, greasy, and not cooked well.

I was dying to try this place given the fact that I love 4Rivers. My fianc√© and his friends were ways saying great things about the food. So when I was finally close to Winter Park it was a no brainer! \\n\\nMy overall experience was good. It's just like 4Rivers when it comes to ordering your food at the counter and taking a seat at any table. You might have to share a table with strangers but we live in Florida and socializing isn't a problem. I ordered the shrimp and cheese grits. It was really good. The grits are fresh. The shrimp is made with andouille sausage which adds southern flavor! The sauce the shrimp and sausage are cooked with add a great taste to the cheese grits. I would've liked a little less sauce but overall it was still very good. The server also gave a good amount of shrimp and sausage. Two more complaints, I have about this dish is that it's kind of expensive and they give you a whole lot of grits. After a while you want to taste something other than grits, so I would suggest you ask for less grits and have them give you a different fixin'. It was delish nonetheless. \\n\\nI would go there again if I was in the area, but some of their fixins need some tweaking. This is a southern food affair and I would expect the Mac n cheese, and collard greens to be awesome. They were just ok. Those are southern food staples. My fianc√© goes to the coop almost once a week with his friends and orders the catfish with grits. They undercooked the catfish twice, which he explains never has happened. Since he was over the undercooked fish he decided to get the meatloaf and that was really good. It's the biggest portion I'd ever seen! \\n\\nI would recommend trying this place for something different. If your a southern food connoisseur than I don't think you'll be too impressed.

At first we went to the location on Horatio but after that one closed we've settled on the Longwood restaurant as the next best. It has the same dim lighting and intimate feel that we loved about the one on Horatio (the DP location just isn't as awesome at all). \\n\\nSo, ambiance is awesome. The only seats that won't be as private are the ones by the bar... because they're by the bar. The bar itself is pretty small but the bartenders are great and really friendly. It's nice to grab a drink if you are early for your reservation.\\n\\nFor dinner you get a choice of fondue courses. The great thing about the Longwood location is that they have some great deals. Specials on weeknights, etc. I love it when they do a dinner for two special, but they' weren't doing that on my last visit. \\n\\nThere are 4 courses here: cheese fondue, salad, fondue entree, and chocolate fondue dessert. \\n\\nFor the cheeses you pick the cheese of your choice (they are all good, but pick your favorite cheese and you'll be happy, my favorites are cheddar and alpine). The cheese is served with bread, raw veggies and apple slices for dipping. It's awesome. \\n\\nMy favorite salad is the California salad with Gorgonzola and raspberry vinaigrette. My husband's long-time favorite was the mushroom salad, and while it's no longer on the menu they'll still make it for you if you ask. \\n\\nThe entree course is actually the one that I could most do without. I mean, this isn't a healthy meal, so why mess around. I have no problems ordering cheese, salad, and dessert. It's not bad, and it's actually pretty good, I just like to make sure to save room for dessert. For your entree you get a choice of cooking styles, bullion or oil for cooking. You get a selection of raw meats and veggies which you then cook in the pot. Be sure to use a timer on your phone so you don't lose track. The veggies can all be thrown in at once to cook. \\n\\nFinally, we've made it to the chocolate! It's all awesome, trust me. We had the smores last time, and it was super tasty.

The spicy eggplant is excellent. The spanish tortilla is very good, although I never saw it served with sour cream in Spain, the way it is done here. The patatas bravas, another classic, were also very good, but were doused in endless mayonnaise, not at all the way it is done in Spain. The sauteed octopus was excellent. The sheep's cheese with pistachios is also terrific. Kale salad was very good but way too salty.\\n\\nService wasn't great.

Interestingly, although there was water on and below the table, there was very little water in our glasses, which sat empty much of the dinner and I had to ask twice for them to be refilled.\\n\\nWould go back for the food to try other things, since it was very good, but would hope for better service"},{"name":"Leaky Roof","address":"1538 SW Jefferson St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Returned here after a decade.

The patio was packed and we wanted an outdoor table, luckily one had just opened up and there wasn't a wait!  We were sat quickly and our waitress was friendly & attentive. \\n\\nI ordered the Hot & Cold Chicken Salad which was outstanding! Flavorful but plainly grilled chicken over arugula & carrot salad topped with a creamy asian vinaigrette. All on top of a small bed of sticky rice. It was a very light meal, made filling by the rice. I loved it! I also thought it was a really great value at ~$14 considering the quality and flavor of the ingredients.\\n\\nPeople next to us had onion rings and hot wings which both looked delicious - I will go back to try both if I have time while I'm in town. My husband ordered a panini-ish sandwich with pulled pork, cheese, pesto and a salad with sundried tomatoes. It was yummy.\\n\\nWhen we left around 5:30 there was a huge line, so I'm glad we got there when we did!\\n\\nWe went back last night hoping to have drinks on the patio but there was a 30-45 minute wait so we sat at the bar instead. We stuck to their specialty cocktails, which were really good but not outstanding.\\n\\nThe only reason I can't give The Parish five stars is because of our experience at the bar. After our orders were filled, nobody ever checked back with us (and it wasn't busy at all, there were fewer than 10 people at the bar), although the bartenders & manager stood chatting with one another. We would have had more drinks but nobody asked. When we decided to leave, we had to get up and walk down the bar to get attention so someone would bring our check, then another wait to close it out."},{"name":"Tavern in the Square","address":"1815 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"We paid our visit to the Tavern in the Square after hearing some good press about it on the Phantom Gourmet, and hearing from a couple of friends that it was worth checking out.\\n\\nI have to agree with Jim B. that it is a bit pricey for medicore food.  \\n\\nWe had the Big Dig Fries (with cheese, sour cream, scallions and bacon bits) to start.   I wasn't overly impressed.  The cheese and bacon were quite sparse, and they were overloaded with sour cream.  I also didn't find their waffle fries to be very tasty on their own.\\n\\nFor entrees, I had the Buffalo Chicken Salad and Kris had the Smokehouse Burger with Onion Straws.  I did find the buffalo salad to be tasty and well seasoned, but again sparse on chicken.  They gave me 3 mini tenders for a huge bowl full of veggies.  Kris said that while the burger was good, it too lacked seasoning and the onion straws were a bit dry.\\n\\nTo give the place its props, I thought the atmosphere and decor were really cute.  They have done a nice job with the space they have, as it is partially connected to the Porter Square Shopping center housing Pier One.  There is a bar area in front with high tables and a dining area in back.  \\n\\nI really wanted to be able to give this place at least 3 stars, but the service of our waitress was the nail in the coffin for me.  While she had a nice personality, we were less than impressed.  After servicing our table a few times, including taking our orders, she then proceeded to come introduce herself to us and stand there as if we were a brand new table she was just starting with.   The worst part was that she didn't fully realize it until we just sat there staring at her.  The rest of the meal went smoothly (although a bit slow, especially given that they weren't that busy).  However, at the end of the meal when she brought us the check, she had put the entire meal of the table next to us on our bill as well.  It was quickly corrected, but given her earlier guffaw, I was less than impressed.\\n\\nIn short, Porter has some much better options for your dining dollar.  If you are looking for good quality pub fare, give Christopher's on the opposite side of Mass Ave your business!  Or, if you are in the Somerville area, check out Olde Magoun's in Magoun Square."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Definitely one of the best burger spots in Austin. The line is definitely daunting when you look how far you have to go, but I would say that if the line is to the door, you have about 15 min before you order. While you are in line, the service is extremely efficient. They will start looking for a table for you inside or out, you can obviously start figuring out what you want, and by the time you are up to the register, you have already placed your order, so it's a quick pay and go. \\n\\nThe burger was spot on. I had the El Diablo. If you like heat, it's a great choice, but by no means is it out of control hot. If you are ordering anything but regular fries (all the other fries just come in large) I would recommend not getting them by yourself as it is a HUGE portion of fries and with the burger and fries, it's a lot of food. I ordered the Parmesan truffle fries and they were very good (out of all the food, the fries were my least favorite, but it was all amazing)\\n\\nFor review purpose I also had a shake, as in my opinion, the fries, burger, and shake are what make a great burger joint if they are all good.

And I appreciated the way the 20 pieces of chicken I ordered were packed in a nice solid aluminum tray. Well done!\\n\\nThe only reason I'm not giving Gus's 5 stars is because of the side items.

It is set-up as a bar where you can order whatever items you want to go into your dish. However, where the menu fails big time is letting customers know that they will be PAYING for each item that they put on their dish. So get ready to pay around $15+ for your chicken shawarma.
