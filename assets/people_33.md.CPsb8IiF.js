All other donuts have been ruined for me.\\nI think it depends on your taste in donuts, but what I particularly like about these (as another reviewer complained about a \\"greasy aftertaste\\") is the fried-oil flavor that you get when you're getting a really good home-made donut that is fried in oil. While some may see that as a negative - if you're used to a Dunkin-Donuts type chain donut that tries to cover up that flavor, you may not like this quality in a donut - this is actually a sign of a quality donut.\\nAside from that, the donuts are somehow both cake-y and yeasty. There are examples of both - a yeasty honey-dip or frosted donut but a cake-y home cut - but even the \\"yeasty\\" donuts have a bit of a cake-y fullness to them).\\nThe flavors are all excellent, very rich but not overwhelming and all maintaining that tiny wisp of a fried-oil flavor. \\nCan not say enough good things about these donuts."},{"name":"Marcelino's","address":"901 Tillery St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Ate a quick lunch here after reading the great reviews.

I just love their garlic-buttered fried rice. It's my ultimate guilty pleasure. That fried rice is the cream of the crop. But when I heard from a friend that Nakato rules, I had to try it out.\\n\\nIn some aspects, Nakato reigns. I love the energy of the place. It's very vibrant and bright. People are more friendly and your table mates instantly become your long-time-no-see friends. Their portion per price is reasonable. With a Hibachi dinner entr√©e, you get way more food than you do from Benihana. Most of all, Nakato offers great food quality. I ordered the filet mignon and it was heavenly. It wasn't overcooked or dry, as it is usually done in Benihana. However, I felt that the side items were not as delicious as Benihana's. The appetizer salad had too much dressing (which was way too salty). The appetizer onion soup failed to capture the deep onion essence. The tasteless noodles served no other point that to fill you up. Worst of all, fried rice didn't have the garlic-kick I longed for.  \\n\\nSo I ended up enjoying my filet mignon, but none of my sides. If you are an entr√©e-lover, then I would highly recommend Nakato over Benihana. But if you are more of a side dish nibbler like me, then you would find yourself happier at Benihana. But overall, I left the place pretty happy, thanks to the entertaining chef and my wonderful table mates. The ambiance was incredible. There was nobody complaining about their undercooked scallop, and better yet, nobody talking on their phone as they chowed down their dinner. Everybody was there to enjoy each other's company, which I deeply appreciated.\\n\\nIn my perfect world, Benihana and Nakato will join forces to created the flawless dish: Entr√©e by Nakato and side dishes by Benihana. But that would be too good to be true.

It had a good amount of lime juice and fish sauce which made the taste not too salty. \\n*Spicy Beef Salad - My friend loved this. The beef wasn't super spicy, so if you like spicy, you might have to add more spice to it. The beef was chewy and tasty.\\n*Kabooom Maki - this was really good. It is served in the panang sauce underneath. Once the dish came out, she moved all the sushi outside of the dish so it doesn't get extremely soaked into the sauce and handed each one to us. Add the seaweed salad in the middle and pair it together. It is delicious - the sauce dipped in it was really good.

I was thinking, how can brownie be that good... let's give this a try. The ice cream paired with the warm melted brownie which had a nice crisp at the top of the brownie was just so good. The chocolate wasn't overpowering because of the ice cream ... I'd go back just to get this dessert haha. \\n\\nCustomer service was great, they were attentive even though we were one of a few groups there around that time (but hey, I've received little attention before even if we were the only group in there....) so I had to mention that.  They have so many options on this menu, I'd come back and try more... and order the brownie again of course haha .... :)"},{"name":"McMenamins Crystal Hotel","address":"303 SW 12th Ave.","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Amazing hotel, great staff.

We ordered the grilled calamari as  an app which I would give 3.5 to 4 stars. I ordered the seafood soup and my husband the Lime Leaf Duck plate and one side of rice and one side of udon noodles.Mine was flavorless and the udon noodles overcooked. My husband's plate had extra garnishes such as TWO THICK, BLACK, PIECES OF HAIR inside the batter of the fried duck. We called the waitress immediately and showed her the hair. I also gave back my overcooked udon noodles.She took the plate and was Unapologetic about the issue. No one from management came to apologize about the situation. The extra garnishes costed $18 for that plate only.\\n\\n\\nAnyways all complaints aside, all I can think and wonder is what type of shampoo/conditioner the cook uses to have such nice, thick and long black hair...\\n\\nOnly recommend if you like extra protein filaments on your order."},{"name":"The Lower Depths","address":"476 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Lower Depths is CASH ONLY!!! \\n\\nThis is my first visit since they switched from a hot dog place to a taco place. Let me start off by saying that dropping the number of tater tot with topping options was a huge loss and is part of the reason for the lost star. This place has an excellent beer list (decent number of taps and tons of bottles). We ordered the shrimp tacos, the chicken tacos, and the corn. The corn toppings (sauce plus cotilla cheese) were decent, but it was a bit over cooked. The tacos were tasty. The shrimp taco was a little sweet for me, but otherwise great, and the chicken taco had excellent flavor, but the meat was rather dry. The tortillas were dry and slightly crunchy at the edges. I loved the spicy refried bean side, but the rice was half over cooked and half weirdly crunchy with soggy over cooked peas/Lima beans/corn throughout. \\n\\nAll in all, still ok if you want a specific side of tots (they only have taco style tots now) and a beer, but maybe do tacos at one of the other amazing options in Boston."},{"name":"Canal Wigwam","address":"4 S High St","city":"Canal Winchester","stars":"4","text":"Great breakfast spot in the heart of Old Canal.

I try to eat in Downtown Disney on every trip at least twice.  Good times to do this are usually on the day we arrive (Downtown is a great way to kick off the trip), and usually as part of our night plans after a day in Animal Kingdom... though that will be harder as the park extends it's nighttime offerings in the future.  \\n\\nRaglan Road is currently 1 Sit Down Meal Credit as part of the Disney Dining Plan.\\n\\nThe Magical (Pros):\\n\\nAtmosphere.  It's a pub you can take your kids into without feeling like bad parents.  SCORE!  The inside of this place is awesome.  It's big (much better than squeezing into Rose & Crown in Epcot for a Pint).  Something about it just feels familiar, and to me that has all the makings of a good pub.  In the evening they have Irish Step Dancers, and a Live Band that plays Irish Music (unlike the Irish Pub in Universal I experienced that was playing Margaritaville and C'mon Eileen... oh the nightmares!) The entertainment usually kicks off around 7pm so plan accordingly! \\n\\nThe food.  I love Pub Food, and Raglan Road nails the best of what we would consider Irish Pub Fare.  The soda bread with Guinness and Olive Oil Glaze Dip is so good we always bring a bottle home.  Appetizers are super filling so choose wisely... the scallops rock! The food... I haven't had a bad dish, but my personal favorite is the Bangers and Mash (Sausage and Mashed Potato).  Oh, and dessert... Bread and Butter Pudding... don't ask questions just get it.  Epic! \\n\\nBeer.  I love Irish Beer.  Kilkenny is a personal favorite of mine, and I wish it was available more places.  At Raglan Road it's on tap, and I usually have one outside while I wait, and another inside during dinner.  It's a Cream Ale, and just makes me smile. If you're a Whiskey lover your heart will also delight.  The Whiskey selection here is huge.\\n\\nThe Wicked (Cons):\\n\\nI wish the entertainment went on earlier.  I don't mind making later reservations, but we have gone without the entertainment, and it just isn't the same.  I would like to see this extended earlier... maybe like a Happy Hour Entertainment start time. \\n\\nI wish the staff were all from Ireland.  I know, I know this isn't Epcot, but that is the ONE leg Rose & Crown over in Epcot has up on this place.  When an American waiter takes my order just a little of the magic dies.  \\n\\nIn the End: \\n\\nThis a is a great choice whether you are on the Dining Plan, or paying out of Pocket.  If you're paying out of pocket it is extremely affordable.  If you're on the Disney Dining Plan it doesn't matter, but don't be fooled and order the most expensive dishes... At Raglan Road the most simple dishes are the best!  \\n\\nThis is a great place to kick off your trip, or start an evening out in Downtown Disney (or should I say Disney Springs).  I would also recommend this over Rose & Crown Pub in Epcot.  It's bigger, the food is better, and the bar is better... just tell your waiter/waitress to talk in an Irish Accent and pretend along with you! :)"},{"name":"Tapatio Mexican Restaurants","address":"18615 SW Farmington Rd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"I always get great service from this restaurant.

Everything met the highest standards of excellence, from the service to the food.  We started with the International sushi roll, which was fresh, tasty and nicely presented.  For the entree, my husband had grilled swordfish with a light, tangy chimichurri sauce, accompanied by gold potatoes and saut√©ed spinach.  It was all fresh-tasting and perfectly cooked.  \\n\\nI had the Signature burger and fries.  The juicy burger was cooked just the way I like it, lightly seared on the edges and a little pink in the middle.  It was topped with cheese, bacon and a Korean-style slaw, and it was absolutely delicious.  The candied bacon balanced the spiciness of the slaw, and the flavors melded beautifully.  The hand-cut fries were also perfect, crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  I'm not kidding!  Everything was perfect! \\n\\nOur waitress was prompt and helpful.  The manager himself cleared our plates.  The atmosphere was casually elegant yet cozy and unpretentious.  My only complaint is that my seat was so cushy, I almost sank below the table.

I definitely recommend making reservations because the place was packed and there was a line waiting just to be seated in the outdoor bar section.

There's a line to check in and a line to be seated but it's not quite clear which is which and no one is paying enough attention to correct it. \\n\\nRegardless of where you're seated this restaurant is a great time! It's noisy but fun. There's a live Irish band that plays throughout the night along with clog dancers. When the band takes a break the dancers will walk around the restaurant encouraging kids to dance with them around the tables. So this place is great for groups and families!\\n\\nOur server was funny and very quick about everything. I had only wished he'd have slowed down a little. He'd come to the table take our beer order and then immediately leave before we could ask for anything else. And it continued that way where he'd drop something off but immediately go to the next table without giving you a chance to speak. But everything came out correct and quickly. They start you off with a basket of soda bread, which was really fresh and had a hint of sweetness. My friend and I both ordered the puff pastry of the day which was chicken and mushroom for our entree. Wow!!! This was delicious and really hot! I'm glad we had a side order of Parmesan fries to munch on while it cooled down a little. The dish is paired with a side salad which I didn't love. There wasn't any dressing on it and the lettuce was a little on the brown side. But you don't even need the salad because the puff pastry is really filling! It had big chunks of chicken and mushrooms in a light cream sauce. I can't see myself ordering anything but this next time. Best of all my drink and food came to only $30.00!

Not sure what this place used to be, but the dining room in the back is higher than the front bar, with one or two steps of elevation in between.  Vintage suitcases on the wall playfully evoke the name of the bar.\\n\\nThe beer menu is extensive. I would love to make another trip to Atlanta just to explore it. In addition to a well-crafted selection of local, national and international beers, the list of vintage bottled beers was comparable to any wine cellar. There's a warning that if you order a vintage bottle and don't like it, you're still on the hook for the bill.  I was tempted to adventure, but found plenty of choices on the \\"regular\\" menu to keep me entertained.\\n\\nThere's also a solid menu of snacks, appetizers and meals.  I started with the salt and vinegar popcorn, which was savory but not nearly as light as it sounds.  I had to stop eating munching to save room for dinner.

I had the Breakfast Tacos, its really different and delicious! Im not one who likes mixing sweet with salty, but the combination is really unique and yummy, its like a thin soft cinnamon pancake as the taco, with scrambled eggs and cheese inside, and crispy bacon bits.

Maybe you need to study or get some work done?  Mozart's has all the convenient power outlets, tables, coffee drinks and snacks to get your projects across the finish line.\\n\\nOh... and during the holiday season they put on a light show which has become a piece of Austin culture.  You have to see it for yourself. Get there an hour early (5 for the \\"6:00 show\\" and stay through until at least 7:20 because the shows are different).

It's amazing how many places use prosciutto that is cut way too thick. The bread that came with the board was rustic and a great base. We prefer the jalape√±o jelly and fig jam, which were both a great accent, but I was blown away by the stone ground mustard that's included. We also ordered the peperonata pizza. The pizza was good, but I was disappointed that the sausage wasn't really what I would consider to be spicy. They do have a good craft beer selection for you to wash down the salty goodness.

Even though I have not lived in the area since 2010, I still make sure to stop when traveling through because the coffee is always perfect and the food is so good. I've been fortunate enough to stop 3 times this month even though I live in Seattle. \\n\\nFirst, the coffee is always perfect. The beans are from Stumptown, and the baristas receive training so they can guarantee customer satisfaction. When they pull shots, they aren't messing around or being negligent in the process. The temperature is always perfect no matter what kind of milk or milk alternative you order. I was impressed to see that they have two machines at their new location, so they can quickly serve customers their coffee at the drive through window and inside the cafe.\\n\\nSecond, the food is amazing. It's not just the flavor that's great, it's the freshness of ingredients and the careful attention put into making sure it's prepared correctly. They have a small menu of salad, granola, and sandwiches. There are gluten free and vegan options. I have never had chia seed pudding prepared correctly anywhere else. Not only that, but the red cabbage that was in my salad seemed slightly marinated in a vinaigrette, and the sweet potato pieces were cooked just right. My grandmother had a breakfast sandwich, and she was really impressed with the freshness of the eggs and bread. When I ordered the chia seed pudding, they asked to verify if I wanted honey on top to make sure if I was vegan or had allergies. They are so considerate of customer dietary restrictions and needs. The owners take extra strides to ensure they are providing you with super tasty meal that is also healthy.\\n\\nThird, I rarely come across better customer service. Everyone working there quickly remembers your name and your drink if you become a regular. They greet you warmly and give compliments, even on my Bunnicula t-shirt one day. Their smiles can be contagious. It's the kind of place you want to keep going back to if not for the amazing coffee, food, and plentiful seating options with big windows and succulent plants galore, but just the welcoming feeling you get as a patron.\\n\\nSo, if you like a good cup of coffee and perhaps you are feeling a little hungry for breakfast or lunch, I strongly encourage you to make this a place to check out. If you drive or ride your bike there, I recommend going via N Blandford Drive since the tree canopy is gorgeous along that road. Maybe take your coffee to Vancouver's Waterfront Renaissance Trail along the Columbia River. Maybe after one visit, you will even find yourself getting excited when driving towards Vancouver because the best coffee shop on Earth is located there."},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Meat and cheese board = happiness\\nOf the items I got everything was very tasty!

This is the first restaurant that charges a $3 upcharge if an adult orders of the kids menu yet the portion size remains the same. I could understand if the portion size was more, but to charge $3 for nothing is wrong.

The sausage is for sure the best we have ever tasted, and the unique flavors of the coleslaw, potato salad, and especially the BBQ sauce were a real treat.  It was an absolute monsoon outside the day we went, and even though it was a weekday, at lunch, with terrible weather, there was a pretty decent amount of people there.\\nOur waiter was awesome, very friendly and on point.  We ordered the brisket, turkey, and sausage with the 3 classic sides and some bread.  The only thing we weren't too crazy about was the brisket, which was on the chewy side and just didn't seem up to the same standard as everything else, but it was still good, just not great.\\nWe would come back just for the sausage, I'm not even joking.  It was like a revelation of meaty, smoky goodness to bite into that sausage.  I am literally salivating writing this just thinking about it!  The turkey was also pretty amazing, it was sooooo moist and delicious.  I purchased a bottle of the BBQ sauce to take home, I liked it so much!

Absolutely not worth it, unless you are a tourist and want to enjoy a crowded, noisy hill country bbq joint. But this isn't about the ambiance because honestly that's all they have going for it now. Thing is, these days you can get MUCH better bbq with a lot less wait and for cheaper at a lot of other fine BBQ establishments. \\n\\nLet's start with what makes this place a one star pothole. The food, mediocre bbq. People croon over the taste...hello.. I can only imagine these people have only beef raman to compare this bbq to. The sausage is a small step above Pepperidge farms kielbasa at HEB, the brisket pales in comparison to competitors (and no I'm not referring to 'sounds like Hranklins'), and the ribs are meh... The only saving grace is the turkey. It's tender, and the m-word, and seasoned just right, so good, probably the best thing there..oh wait..right..what turkey, they haven't had it in years. \\n\\nEveryone raves about the family style, all you can eat. I wonder if they actually pay attention to the subsequent plates of meat? the brisket is the scraps not fit to serve in any restaurant, the ribs are the tiny, scrappy funky leftovers that are a struggle to get meat off, and thankfully sausage is sausage, but I bet if they had some sad links, they'd choose to toss em on there also. They often deliver and charge for things not ordered. Time and time again I order a sandwich, and they bring out a plate, and charge for it. I didn't order the sides, how can you get that wrong. They also keep bringing out and charging for jalapenos, I specifically said no thank you. This last time they dumped them out on the table, picked them up and took them away yet still charged me. Lets also talk about screw ups. I often order cobbler, specifically say no to the a-la-mode, yet it still comes out with icecream on top, are these people retarded? And I mean that is an automotive timing sense where the spark isn't quite lined up with the rest of the fuel and pressure, if you know what I mean. Just this last, and it will be the last time, I ordered a triple chop sammich and my friend ordered a brisket sammich plate. They placed a plate with a single sammich in front of me and called it the triple chop, and handed her a sammich plate with sides and called it a brisket sammich plate. Since my party had been waiting over an hour..I didn't bother to put on my reading glasses to inspect it under a microscope, I dove in. half way through my friend looks at me funny and asks when they started adding onions to a straight-meat sammich, i said never, Just then we realize they put the wrong sammich on the wrong plate. Do I really have to fking check my order on a 15$ sammich?? McD gets it right ever time...\\n\\nLet's also talk about consistency, not there. I often order the triple chop, it's suppose to be a trifecta of meaty goodness, and usually it is. However, twice now, I've gotten something that resembles a small pile of raccoon scat on bread. For years I have never been able to finish one, close but never quite the entire thing. My weight and appetite fluctuate a little (Mecury in retrograde or something), but never to the point that I encounter often getting a portion so pathetic that I not only finish the sammich but feel as if I could eat an entire second one of similar wimpy-ness.\\n\\nNext up..they have no sense of regulating common decency. If you insist on going, here's how to be a big asshat like the rest of the people there... go to the to-go kiosk and order your meal, you'll get it in less than 10 minutes, then just walk to the waiting area, that's already standing room only for people waiting for an actual seat, and sit down and start eating. Or better yet, hop the wall and occupy a table in the outside dining area, taking away a place that someone's been waiting 1-2 hours for ..the staff doesn't give a raccoon's ass.\\n\\nFinally, value..not there. The price is inline with the upper echelon, but they just aren't. If you're looking for good central-texas bbq yer better off taking the drive to Luling or Lockhart.. but I understand, it's not in the scenic hill country, so you'll go anyway because your subconscious is operating in a condescending sort of bigoted way that this place -must- be better than some place in the Blackland prairie, and that's what they survive on."},{"name":"Tiki Rock","address":"2 Broad St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I went here 12/8/19 for a brunch called Brunch So Hard.

Once my food arribed here, which had flowers all over it (not sure if the flowers were edible).\\n\\nMoving on, I start to eat it, mid way through, I noticed that they had blueberries berries on the plate( they were on a decorated leaf by my steak. The blueberries were hidden on the bottom of strawberries, which I'm not too allergic too) But I'm highly allergic to blueberries. I keep an EpiPen on me at all time. \\n\\nNow, while I was eating, I started to itch a bit but I assumed it was the scarf I had on, which was around my neck.\\n\\nI waved to my waitress and ask if she could ask the chef, if the blueberries touched my food. The waitress did and I saw that the chef was upset because I asked.\\n\\nAt that point, I was over it and started to look for my Benadryl. The manager comes over and ask who has a food allergy. Then process to state \\"You need to inform your waitress of you allergy and that they cross  contaminated their food all the time\\",  he continued to say \\"this is a Tiki restaurant and if I ever came before, I stated no and then he started becoming condescending. \\n\\nNow, I was thinking, I had this allergy all my life and I would never order something that could have blueberries in it. Now Steak and Eggs from a basic restaurant, shouldn't have berries. Its STEAK AND EGGS!\\n\\nThe manager continued and made me feel so guilty for having an allergy. Then I stopped him because I couldn't be belittled anymore and said I will pay this bill (which I never said I wouldn't, even though I am having a reaction) and I wasnt trying to complain. He continued to demean us while my tongue started to swell. Then walked around to talk to the event coordinator about something.\\n\\nI had to find my waitress, so I could get my bill. I paid, left and took the necessary steps, so I wouldn't go into shock. However, after I left, my friends stated the manager (young gentlemen) came back again and explained about cross contamination. Also \\"he was sad to see me go\\". This isn't great customer service, to a paying customer. \\n\\nI wasn't asked if I was okay, if I needed water or if they should call 911. My lips were swelling and no remorse. So please, do not go here, if you want to have an allergic reaction and be blamed for the reaction or not even offered help. \\n\\nMoral of the story:\\nDon't go there, go somewhere else.

It's an entity. It's a legend. It is, literally, a cuisine set apart from other American standards. I'm a Seattle-born girl living in NYC, and I thought I'd tasted BBQ at some of the best NYC joints - Fette Sau, Blue Smoke, etc. But a family trip to Austin last week - and to Salt Lick - showed me what I'd been missing.\\n\\nWe had heard that Salt Lick was the place to go for authentic local BBQ, and that the wait could get crazy long. It was a Saturday night AND a football weekend*, so I was worried that the wait would be unmanageable. But Salt Lick is BYOB, so we stopped at a gas station about 5 miles down the road and picked up some Shiner.\\n\\nPulling into the parking lot was definitely daunting, as the place is so big that there are literally signs directing you which way to go: for take-out, over there; winery, over here; restaurant, that way..etc. etc. (FYI: if you have people under 21, I would avoid the winery - apparently they check ID, as opposed to the general picnic waiting area, where people BYOB and it's very easy for people of all ages to enjoy a beer). \\n\\nBut don't be deterred! This place literally looked like the parking lot at a county fair, and the hostess told us it was a 45 minute wait...and it was closer to 30 minutes! Besides, I would have been fine waiting for twice as long, because:\\n\\n1) The picnic area is expansive and lovely, with big trees, picnic tables, popcorn and lemonade stands, and a little country music stage with live country music.\\n2) It was a beautiful evening, and the ambiance described in 1) made me feel like I was at a place where locals and tourists alike go to have a good time and enjoy some Texas BBQ.\\n3) The food made it MORE than worth it (see next paragraph).\\n\\nOur waiter led us inside one of two BBQ houses (each has its own pit!) and we got a table in the corner, with benches along both sides. The room was packed and you could just SENSE how happy everyone was to be chowing down on brisket, ribs, pork, etc.\\n\\nMEAT\\n-Pork ribs: unbelievable, juicy, flavorful, and SO meaty. There was so much meat on the bone!\\n-Turkey: I have never had BBQ turkey before, and let me tell you - I'm a convert. TRY IT.\\n-Brisket: complemented perfectly by the BBQ sauces they provide for you (2 sauces; one is spicier and one is milder)\\n-Sausage: probably my least favorite, but my brother adored it\\n\\nSIDES\\nThe waiter emphasized to us that \\"20 minutes ago, your coleslaw was a cabbage.\\" I thought that was a perfect way to describe how fresh the sides were. I am firmly in the No Mayo Camp** when it comes to coleslaw and potato salad, and this coleslaw was perfect - slightly tangy and a crisp accompaniment to all of the meats. The potato salad managed to be creamy and yet also light (and with no mayo!). The baked beans were classic. The pickles and onions and white bread were provided as soon as we asked, and the waiter even brought some spicy jalapenos, which reduced my normally spice-tolerant brother and father to silence and watery eyes for a good few minutes,\\n\\nAs stuffed as we all were, we managed to choke down some absolutely horrific (read: unbelievably delicious) blackberry-peach cobbler. Mouth is currently watering thinking about it...\\n\\nI can't recommend Salt Lick BBQ enough. It's definitely one of the best meals, and best dining experiences I've ever had.\\n\\n---\\n*Apparently football is like, A REALLY BIG DEAL in Texas.

I decided to give this ole' faithful a try, once again, and they really exceeded my expectations.\\n\\nFirst of all, whatever you do, make a reservation! This place gets super duper packed and it beats waiting. We were seated pretty quickly with a decent view of the stage - but always a dang column in the way. Our server, Louie, was on top of it and really just a super nice guy and funnyyyyy. I would actually ask for him as a server if we went again. He really made a great first impression on our party. \\n\\nEveryone seemed to be pretty happy with their orders. I was actually shocked to find a veggie friendly burger on the menu. They sneak it in among the menu items so I could see how it could easily be passed up! Anyways The Big Q is a great option when you want to stick to a meat/fish free meal and not feel left out and stuck eating side dishes. So Kudos to RR for not excluding folks!  Obviously it's not a burger so the consistency will be different as it's made of red quinoa and white beans. I opted for chips (fries) as my side but I believe you can substitute.    They also bring a basket of complimentary bread with this fabulous glaze for dipping. Forgot what it was called but it was very good.     My friend ordered the Fish & Chips and I marveled at how much FISH was in her meal. I won't name names but another seafood type restaurant on property that is very upscale has more batter than fish for their fish and chips.... so you definitely get your money's worth of fish here! \\n\\nThe atmosphere is lively and loud.

It looked fairly quiet on the outside but walk in and you'll find a fairly packed spot with seemingly happy customers enjoying their meals. We didn't know what to expect but what we did know is that we were famished! Their menu is small but has just enough options to help you make a choice with ease. We ordered the roasted eggplant, TSP meatballs, and a small serve of the Carbonara and the Orecchiette each. The roasted eggplant had a zesty and tangy taste thanks to the spices of Zaatar and the pumpkin seeds added a bit of crunch, which complemented the soft and succulent texture of the roasted eggplant. The meatballs were such a delight too, which was enjoyed both with and without the toasted bread. The meatballs were tender enough to melt in your mouth and the gravy added with its signature marinara flavour. I loved the Orecchiette, which had bits of mushrooms and maybe some peppers(?) - it was really filling and the shelled pasta packed quite a bit of the flavour and stuffing. Going for the small serve was a great idea as I just made it to the end without feeling bloated! The carbonara was a bit on the peppery side (maybe just a bit too much pepper), but it was still a dish that I'd recommend for someone who's looking for a carbonara dish that isn't bland (as may typically be the case) and still possesses a level of subtle creaminess. As we didn't have a US government issued ID, we weren't able to have drinks, so I'd recommend taking a photo of your passport (especially if you don't want to carry it around) so that you can access the bar.

We ordered a second round of cocktails and I tried the turmeric based Hyderabad tonic while my wife tried the the mani mule. We got another small plate--the chicken malai this time. Taste buds were delighted by this comination of the turmeric cocktail and the spicy yet flavorful chicken Malai each bite was succulent, soft and mouth-melting!!\\nWe were so immersed in the sensations of the palate and ambience that we stopped looking at the time. We decided we were full and only ordered one large plate to share--we asked our server for a recommendation and she recommended the butter chicken without even blinking her eyes. She claimed that this was her favorite dish and once I took the first bite, I understood why...it was so beautifully presented in a copper pot with garnish and a striking golden yellow hued color.

We had a reservation, and when we entered the restaurant, we had to wait a couple minutes but were then shown to our table. The restaurant itself is BEAUTIFUL. We were told that the wallpaper and many items were actually from India, making them extremely unique. Right when you enter, there's a mural on the wall of an Indian woman and its just VIBEZ.

My personal favorites were the Paneer Chili Roll and the Jackfruit Kofta, but everything was done extremely well.

Waitress promptly left the table and went over to a console where she spent a few minutes talking to another waitress before putting in our order. It was clear that they were talking about us, as they pointed several times in our direction. We never received our drinks order and had to ask a bus boy for waters. Once desserts were brought to table, we did not see our waitress again and I had to literally walk across the room to get our check after she ignored my attempts to get her attention through our seating. \\n\\n-Waitress was also wearing a very short, very tight black lace dress that seemed wildly out of place. \\n\\n-One of our group left behind a sweater.

Slightly on the salty side though."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Of course, everyone has been talking about this place.  This was my first time here...finally..and it was well worth the visit.\\n\\nKind of randomly placed in the middle of GA Tech-ville, this small-appearing building opens up into a second Naples.  I can't comment if this is how a pizza parlor in Italy really looks, but they sure go a long way to make you think so.  \\n\\nAmbiance: when you enter the front door, you order at the counter.  There is a large menu on the wall above the cashier.  A little deceiving - the prices are in Euros with the \\"Atlanta price\\" in dollars to the right.  We thought we were ordering a pizza for like $14, but when the cashier told us $21, we quickly realized where we went wrong.  After paying, we moved through the crowd to the backroom.  It's a large room with about 8 family-style picnic tables.  You grab a seat wherever you can find one.  In the back, you can watch the Italians make the pizza from scratch.  There are three fireplace ovens for baking the pies.  Italian music is blasting in the background with chatter from couples and families throughout the room.  Pictures of Italy and Italian food adorn the walls.\\n\\nFood: In short, great!  We were hoping we could order a slice or two, but the pizzas only come in one size - large.  There were about 8 slices.  We ordered the Pomodorini which had bufala cheese, cherry tomatoes, garlic and fresh basil.  The pizza came out on a large baking sheet.  It was cooked perfectly - not too oily, good temperature, and just messy enough without spilling sauce on your shirt.  A nice touch is that at the back counter where they make the pizza, there are little dishes where you can grab some freshly grated parmesean cheese, red pepper, freshly minced garlic and marinated red hot peppers (the same ones used on the Diavola pizza).  There were boxes available for your leftovers.  I haven't tried their calzones, but they sounded good.  Also didn't try their various types of cannolis, but they looked mouth-watering as well.    \\n\\nDrinks: when you order at the front, there were a couple of refrigerators with bottled beverages: small coke products (maybe 8oz bottles instead of 12oz), sparkling water, etc.  If you want tap water, they give you a small plastic cup and direct you to the sink.  No ice.  No straws.  Get up if you want refills and get it yourself.  I think this could be improved.  A simple fountain drink would be more customer-friendly.  I think you can bring your own wine bottle too.\\n\\nParking: a little tough because the restaurant is so busy.  There are a couple of lots though and there was a nice guy directing cars into open spots.  He found us a spot in seconds right across the street.  It looked like there was some street parking further up the block too.  \\n\\nOverall, I think this place was great!  Having an Italian grandmother who makes pizza from scratch and being from New York, I can't say it was the best I have ever had, but it is pretty darn authentic for the South.  I would definitely go back.  With regard to the food, I would give this place a 5, but I dock a star because this place is unnecessarily  pricey, especially for lunch.  If you don't know, pizza is extremely cheap to make.  I appreciate the atmosphere the owners aim to create, but I think there are ways to make it more customer-friendly - pizza by the slice, seating rather than find an open spot at the table on our own, fountain drinks.  Still, I would definitely recommend you try this hidden Italian gem and prepare yourself for a unique culinary experience."},{"name":"Sweet Chili Thai Cuisine","address":"470 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Arlington","stars":"3.5","text":"We stopped into Sweet Chili for lunch after a Penzey Spice shopping spree.

Made reservations via Open Table no issue for a Friday at 7:30pm.  We ordered an appetizer and drinks and then we waited.  We waited for our drinks, we waited for the appetizer, we waited for our server to come back and get our order.  Finally, before our drinks (two of their restaurant week drinks and two beers) arrived our server came and took our order for our meals.  Three of us got the restaurant week offers.  Two the $35 which was a Cesar salad and beef tartar and then your choice of ribs or burger.  One got the burger the other the ribs.  One got the $50 meal which was some fish starter, ribs and then his choice mussels or a half chicken.  He got the chicken.  Then one person just ordered the burger. Then the wait started again.  From the time we ordered to the time our first course coming to the table was 45 minutes.  45 minutes for a Cesar salad.  You have to be kidding me.  Our server even came over and said that he was sorry that we were victims of the s&*t show happening in the kitchen.  WHAT?  OK not sure I needed to know that and again it is a Cesar salad.  Isn't it already made you just have to put it on a plate?  Finally, our first courses came.  I mean it is a Cesar salad nothing too special.  I wish I had some pepper.  None on the table to speak of and good luck getting anyone to come and give us some.  Second course came more quickly.  I was NOT a fan of the beef tar tar.  Not sure why but didn't do it for me.  Three bites into our second course three of the four third course came.  WOW.  This really is a s*&t show.  As I stated one in our group got the ribs as his second course and there were three ribs on the plate, which is a proper portion.  The two burgers came out and the half chicken but no third course ribs.  I had the table start their third courses while I tried to wave down our waiter.  I said I was missing my third course the ribs.  He walked over to the end of the kitchen and grabbed a plate of ribs.  Now it looked like my friend's second course of three ribs.  I ate it but really think I got the second course of the $50 meal vs the third course of the $35 meal.  Ribs had good flavor and were not dried out.  The people with the burgers said they were good and enjoyed them.  The chicken was boring but fine.  Then we sat in front of two courses of plates forever.  Finally, our waiter asked if we wanted to see the desert menu.  We all looked at each other wondering how long that would take but said sure.  Well we are slow learners that took 15 minutes to get the menu of which we decided to just get a port and some coffee.  Again we were not in a hurry as we were enjoying each other's company but this was becoming painful.  Having to ask for water refills, and the check shouldn't need to be done.  Our waiter did give us 20% off which made the night a tad less painful.  Food I give a 3.5 to a 4.  Maybe I ordered wrong.  Service a 2 as the night went on the waiter got more and more distant. Drinks 3 stars if not a beer drinker.  Kettle One and Titos is the only two vodkas, wine selection ok not great and a tad expensive for what they are serving. On the positive side free and plentiful parking.

I understand that most of what happens at restaurants is not the sole responsibility of one person and that the attitude and actions of other patrons can often effect your own experience.

No drinks, no \\"hey, be with you in a few\\". I can wait. I can even understand there are probably good reasons why one group might order before another. But to not be greeted, smiled at, acknowledged while two groups of 5 people each get attended to before you, with the restaurant filling up more and more with each passing minute, I couldn't stand that.

They come with two little appetizer pieces on the plate, and if you get a tofu curry they give you those little guys vegetarian instead of meat, which is very kind. They offer all the curries vegetarian as well. This last time I tried vegetarian drunken noodles. It was also delicious! It came with really tasty tofu and a ton of vegetables.

We made a reservation almost two weeks in advance (not sure if this was necessary). It is necessary for the whole table to do the same number of course (i.e. 4 vs 6 courses total). They were very accommodating with dietary restrictions, and have a complimentary coat check. Atmosphere was nice - dimly lit room w/ dark furnishings... if you care about that sort of thing.\\n\\nHere is what we ended up having -- in my non-chefy words:\\namuse-bouche: single oyster w/ a blackberry vinagrette (but I think he said vignette? - which I could not taste, but some of my friends could) and salmon roe. Pretty good.\\n1st course: scallop sashimi with winter orange and some nutty stuff (not... a big fan of nutty overtones w/ sashimi...)\\n2nd course: medley of seafood, single grilled shrimp, 2 mussels, halibut. very lightly seasoned but came on top of a sauce. pretty good. at this point, very hungry for something more filling.\\n3rd course - a spoonful of rice (yay carbs?) mixed with mint and other things that made me seem like the rice mixture you find inside Greek wraps, and homemade lamb sausage. honestly I hated this dish, worst sausage I've ever had. it was very one-toned and tasted like bad chorizo.\\n4th course - sweetbread & a cut of sirloin with a java bean 'hummus' and turnip puree. pretty good, never had sweetbread before.\\namuse-buche: citrus-y cream with a crumble on top. delicious!\\ndessert: flourless brownie w/ a blackberry (?) sorbet & caramel + orange marmalade on the side. Notttttt sure what was going on with the caramel & marmalade, but loved the sorbet and flourless brownie.\\n\\nSo really what we had was 5 courses (unless I am forgetting something, which is totally possible because that was really late time to eat dinner and now I am tired the morning after) and 2 amuse-buche. \\n\\nThe waiters were very attentive and filled our glasses with water often, but there was one guy who was unable to avoid spilling after the fill. It was actually kind of amazing to spill that consistently, especially if you frequently are filling glasses. I felt comfortable but reasonably cramped at the table.\\n\\nOverall I enjoyed this meal but it was nothing stellar, and I am glad I came on an occasion where I paid 30% of the tab. I'm not sure I would be excited to come back here again, though I will say it is one of the better fine dining places I have been to.

Persian BUFFET in the heart of Texas.\\n\\nWest Anderson Lane. One of the great strip mall cappalaries through which the life blood of our fair city flows. \\n\\nTucked beneath MoPac and it's constant construction, next to some sort of structure called a \\"Gym One\\" (apparently a place where people pay money to sweat), you find Alborz. \\n\\nThe exterior screams \\"unremarkable.\\" Inside, however, from 11:30 AM to 4 PM, a pretty awesome Persian feast in a relaxed environment awaits. 10.79 buys you all the water you can drink and a selection of over a dozen Iranian specialities. \\n\\nIranian food falls under the more subtle, savory end of the middle eastern flavor spectrum. Those in search of spice will likely have to settle for bottled hot sauce or the pico de gallo that sticks out on the buffet table like a sore thumb held back in international customs. \\n\\nIt's also important to understand that Persian cuisine is very, very heavily rice based. The carb-fearing, fad-diet following and those otherwise averse to good taste need not apply. \\n\\nI'll tell you this much: I'm not a rice guy. I'm half-Asian, and I've had it all, from calrose to jasmine to Uncle Ben's. In general, I consider it filler I could either A) make a better version at home or B) substitute for a much-more difficult to reproduce bread. \\n\\nThat said, Alborz has at least five different rice options on their buffet. They're all quite good. The lima bean, lentil and sour cherry rices are especially unique and flavorful. \\n\\nThe other area where Persian food tends to slay is texture. The toned-down spice levels give you room to appreciate other elements of the cuisine. Stand outs in this category include their \\"crispy rice\\", their crunchy sabzi salad and the straight-awesome fried potato slivers on their lentil-beef stew. \\n\\nProtein options are pretty damn impressive in general. Roasted chicken is mild, but flavorful. The lamb shanks in a fatty, rich stew pair beautifully with whatever rice you pick. \\n\\nChicken/rice casseroles shaped into crispy-on-the-outside, soft-poultry-on-the-inside spheres are filled with flavor, texturally sound and one of the most unique items you'll find on a buffet anywhere. \\n\\nAll of this pales in comparison to their stand-out, superstar dish, however; an electric green chicken soup full of meat, chickpeas and slow-cooked vegetable flavor. Honestly one of the best chicken soups I've had in years and worth ordering off their regular menu should you come outside of the buffet zone.\\n\\nNoon bread is decent and pairs well with a very mild, creamy hummus. \\n\\nDesserts include fresh watermelon, a excellent carrot spice cake (fluffy + light texture, but full of flavor) and Persian rice pudding, your enjoyment of which will depend heavily on your feelings towards rosewater (it was a bit strong for me, and I'm a rice pudding junkie).\\n\\nThere's much rice, meat, flavor and merriment to be had at Alborz. If you haven't gotten around to it yet, you owe it a try. If you live anywhere close by, be prepared to make it part of your regular rotation."},{"name":"Antico Forno","address":"93 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"We were a party of 8 on a busy Saturday night.

I should disclose that I love Thai food! I love eating Thai food I love cooking Thai food and I love the smell of Thai food. Once I heard Saigon Kitchen was gone and a new Thai restaurant was in its place I was sooo unbelievably excited.\\n\\nThe interior of the restaurant is still kind of sparse but they just opened so I wont knock them for that. The name Thai Curry kind of makes me feel like they specialize in curries but I did notice they had Nam Tok on the menu and honestly its one of my favorite foods so I had to try their version!\\n\\nI love Thai salads in general especially Nam Tok .. There is just something about the blending of Fish Sauce and lime Juice that produces a flavor that makes my taste buds dance. The problem here is that when I had this version of Nam Tok the happy danced never happened, Most likely because I couldn't taste any Fish Sauce .. the lime juice flavor was pretty strong but that's about all I got. The other concerning thing is that meat in the Nam Tok tasted like it had been refrigerated and then reheated. The strong left over meat flavor really was not acceptable. \\n\\nSo.. my first experience was bad .. but I decided to give them some more chances. My friend went in and ordered a Yellow Curry.. he ate it but didn't seem to be too pleased at all. The comment he made was that it tasted slightly better than a T.V. dinner. Now at this point I'm starting to think maybe it wasn't just me.. perhaps these guys are doing something that would make Gordon Ramsey scream like a banshee and reheating the meat. \\n\\nAnother friend at work decided to try them, he  ordered a Yellow Chicken Curry.. when he got back and took it out of the bag the grease had settled and floated to the top of the container. It was soooo greasy, I understand this is a somewhat greasy dish but a chicken curry should for no reason ever have this much grease floating on top of it. I uploaded a photo of the greasy curry for anyone who doesn't believe me or doubts just how much  grease was on this curry. Anyway back to the story, my friend ate a few bites of his curry tried the chicken and looked sorta pale. He then looked over at me said that the chicken tasted like it was several days old. He did not react very well at all and freaked out and did not eat the food and insisted that it must be bad. \\n\\nThis place is walking distance from my job, I really didn't want to give up hope that it could be an acceptable place to eat lunch. I'm not looking for perfect Thai or even the best in town, just a quick bite to eat that is walking distance away. So I decided to give them another try and gr and order the most Americanized of Thai foods ..Pad Thai. \\n\\nI always get the combination Pad Thai (pork & shrimp) any time I order Pad Thai. I called in my order and it was waiting when I arrived to pick it up 15 minutes just like they said it would be. The employees were nice and I was in and had my food and was on my way back to work in no time. The flavor of the Pad Thai itself wasn't that bad. The problem was that the shrimp was so horrible over cooked they were falling apart. The pork once again tasted like it was 2-3 days old. The pork in my Pad Thai was so over cooked and very hard to chew. It has that taste of re-heated left overs and just ruined the whole dish. I dont think the dish itself would have been so bad if the meat and shrimp hadn't been old and overcooked.\\n\\nI give out 1 star reviews about as frequently as I give out five star reviews. In my world nothing is ever completely perfect or completely without merit. I'm making an exception for this place because I honestly do believe they are serving old reheated meat products in their dishes. I hope they realize how dangerous this is as someone is bound to eventually get sick. Dont eat here its not worth the chance until they address this very serious problem."},{"name":"Chambar","address":"568 Beatty Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Came here for brunch and loved my dishes and the bites I had of other dishes.

She really showed her passion for working at/owning a creperie in how conscientious she was in looking after customers orders and clearing plates, restocking napkins and refilling the water cooler, and so forth. Her hubby was making the crepes! He was also very friendly, and when we left he thanked us for coming and encouraged us to return. If I lived around there I would go back often, but I was visiting.\\n\\nThe savory crepe I ordered was filling, hot, a good portion size, and with ingredients evenly distributed so that the first bite was as satisfying as the last. The hinges of the crepes were intact and the surface evenly cooked. The banana mango smoothie was more banana than mango but still very satisfying, cold, and a good thick consistency. \\n\\nThe smoothie was around $6 and the crepe $7, so you can decide whether those prices seem reasonable.

Oh no, that would be too much like you care about customer service and the actual REVIEWS of your PAYING CUSTOMERS to consistently improve customer quality!!! Lastly, yes the water advisory was implemented but they also gave several methods to have clean water! FOR EXAMPLE boiling water (not putting the boiling water onto your hands douchebag) and the utilization of water bottles for clean water!!!

However I'm sure you don't know much of anything other than demeaning people who doesn't give your establishment rave reviews!!

I told her the pepper turkey with provolone cheese and all the trimmings. She proceeded to immediately put on gloves and ask me my bread preference.. ma'am please wash your hands!! Putting on gloves does not make you clean enough to handle food after cleaning tables in the lobby (yuck)!!!\\n\\nFinally to the making of my sandwich. Again I ordered the pepper turkey, cheese, mayo, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles (they come diced oddly enough), olives, salt, pepper, oil, vinegar and oregano (Whhheeeww hahaha) on marble rye. I also got a side of that infamous butternut squash soup. She wasn't the friendliest but within 5 minutes I was out so I didn't make a fuss!! Once home I opened my sandwich wrapping to notice a mountain of mess. The sandwich had completely fallen apart! I was shocked! Though I have ordered this sandwich at plenty of other delis (baldinos, Publix, alons) never have I seen such mess!! It nearly turned me off!! My sandwich was slathered in mayo and drenched in oil!! A Complete disaster!! I eventually ate half of it with a knife and fork and finished my soup. I threw the other half away, there was no salvaging it! I tried to give this place another try but for $12 dollars, subpar customer service, a 25 minute commute... yea ITS A EASY PASS FOR ME!!! I say if you want a GREAT sandwich just go to Baldinos!

The staff were quick to greet, seat, serve, and get you out the door!! Don't get me wrong. The service was great. We had a local named Deana who was fantastic. She was social, friendly, made great recommendations and never made us feel hurried. We just saw the rest of the tables being served soooo fast!! Do NOT order your dinner when you order your appetizer! They will arrive within seconds of each other. Didn't happen to us because we held off on ordering but it happened all around us. \\n\\nWe ordered the Burrata- a cream filled fresh mozzarella ball with fresh chopped tomatoes, basil, EOO, and balsamic.

It would be hard pressed to say which was better but both were fantastic! Trust me. We've eaten all over the North End. This was excellent!\\n\\nAnd..... can we talk about the prices?!

After all the hype, I was really looking forward to finally getting over to Row 34. I am a seafood/lobster roll enthusiast, so I was super excited to try their buttered lobster roll. In the end, it was good, but not great.\\n\\nLet's start at the beginning: They allow reservations for 1/4 of the restaurant and walk-ins get the other 3/4. I was a little worried about walking in without a rez on a Saturday at lunchtime, but I was led to a table right away. The waiter, while being nice and attentive, was at bit bad a pouring things. Water - all over the table. NBD - he cleaned it up. Wine? The table got a better pour than I did - as did the glasses of 4 ladies drinking wine near me. Mama don't like bad wine pours. Whatever - I didn't say anything.\\n\\nAs for the food - the complimentary bread and butter was pretty darn good! Yay for salted, creamy butter.\\n\\nWe started with some oysters. No complaints there! I made sure to ask for the briniest ones. They were plump, well-shucked and delicious. And in true seafood house glory, they explained which oysters were which when they were presented. I hate it when places just plop down the plate and you have to guess at the oyster varieties. \\n\\nThe lobster roll was a bit small for the price tag, but I expected it for being right in the city. It came with a side of coleslaw (meh) and potato chips (hot damn! the chips were homemade and tastayyyy). The lobster meat itself was pretty good and fresh, but I've had better. The roll was very disappointing. It was too hard and robust (get your mind outta the gutter) and took away from the lobster meat. My friend and I both had one bite of our lobster rolls with the actual roll and then picked up our forks to eat the meat out. What happened to soft, buttery rolls? If Row 34 fixes their bun problem, they'll be a 4-star joint."},{"name":"Maria's Pastry Shop","address":"46 Cross St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Tried their Boston Cream Pie and it was fresh and not too sweet.

But apparently, they made it work because finally, the drink had arrived. Drink was strong but it wasn't anything I'd rave over. Then, we ordered some food that took at least another hour to come out. I ordered the fried calamari and it was ok, nothing special. After reading  the reviews about the food and failing inspection I'm lucky to be alive (definitely won't eat here again). After about 3 hours, the waitress asked if we wanted a hookah.

In wanting to speak to a manager, sadly the male host IS the onsite manager. I still requested for him to come see me. He never came and made no effort to speak with me.  \\n\\nUltimately the dinner was fine, food was good, but for an immediate customer experience, I clearly didn't fit this manager's bill to deserve respect or care during a simple check-in process.

Tostones ,rice and meat from Milanesa had no flavor at all and no salt.(They didn't give us silverware ,menu or spices like pepper & salt as usual in other places)   \\nWe had to seat ourselves, move the tables and chairs so our group could eat together.

That was it! They took wrong orders & took long to bring food to the other half of the group. Some dishes had good taste but others like Tostones or Milanesa had no flavor. Great space they have but for what if they don't have good costumer service??  None of the waiters are Cubans and the waiters have no knowledge of the menu or food.

We both decided to come here to Yelp to check out the reviews and were naturally horrified, as there are so many bad ones here.  We ended up risking it anyway.  Since then we've ordered five more times.  Everything has been excellent -- way above average Chinese takeout quality.  What's the deal?\\n\\nFirst of all, we didn't order any meat.  This is one of the few cheap Chinese restaurants that deliver via Foodler that actually has a decent vegetarian menu to choose from.  We've tried several tofu and fake-meat dishes.  I've tried the General Gau's veggie-chicken (last night's order actually had me doing a double take:  the way they cooked the fake meat this time was just too good and I had to cut a piece in half and examine it to make sure it was not chicken)  and the Kung Pao - which has the most delicious combo of peanut sauce, peanuts, and again - heaping helpings of veggies.\\n\\nMy husband prefers the straight-up tofu dishes and they have been nothing but delicious -- again, generous portions of tofu and lightly steamed vegetables, sauces are excellent.  General Gau's Tofu is outstanding, too ... and at $8, it just can't be beat for late nights after 10 hour work shifts.\\n\\nI haven't tried the meat here, so I can't comment on it.  I can comment on the crab rangoon, which you get a ridiculously large serving of and it is crazy, crazy good.  And the \\"Crystal\\" shrimp are like shrimp shumai but even better.  The first time we ordered, we also got the lotus paste and red bean buns.  They didn't have enough left so they called us to let us know and gave us two extra free custard buns to make up for it.\\n\\nThey deliver super quick to the center of Harvard Square (20-30 minutes every time) and have friendly delivery people. I don't know what these other Yelpers are talking about -- and I hope that if you, like me a few weeks ago, are checking this site out to see whether they're worth ordering from, you'll disregard the negativity here and give them a chance."},{"name":"B Cafe","address":"405 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"4","text":"5 stars solely for the Thai Tea Slush.

It's location in front of a derelict strip mall in a very undesirable part of Casselberry does not add to the appeal. The dining room is small and reminds me of an old cafeteria. For a while we were the only ones under 70 in the place and we thought, \\"Uh Oh\\". \\n\\nBut our server, although not personable, very effecient enough. I liked the beer we ordered, Zywiee and Warka, but preferred the amber Warka over the Zywiee. We started with potato pancakes ($5.99 for three) and a single cheese blintze ($4.99). The potato pancakes, although pricey for their small size, were good- cripsy and with a nice onion flavor. I'd pass on the blintze next time. \\n\\nFor entree I ordered the periogies ($8.99 for six) and got half made with cheese and mushrooms and the other with sauerkraut. When they arrived they looked nothing like the picture and were drowning in an oil. I had to fish them out and dried them off to eat them! The kraut ones were the better of the two. My hubby's mashed potatoes were horribly dry, his kraut unremarkable but his kielbasa was good. We even tried the lemon cake for dessert, again just ok. \\n\\n**One thing that stood out was the marvelous Challah bread.

Both times were spectacular. Quality of product was exceptional, preparation and presentation were excellent, service and knowledge were also excellent. Maybe what I love the most is the presentation, with all the beautiful little dishes and cups, everything in its place and for its purpose. Watching the owners prepare the food right in front of you is the real fun, like educational and beautiful dinner theater. Watching them sear a whole duck, and place shellfish just so on tiny plates, and grate horseradish root right on the plate--that is really enjoyable. \\n\\nThe food is rich and beautiful, and dinner is an extensive (and expensive) proposition; we sat down at 7:30 and didn't leave until 10:30  on a week night. You eat what they prepare (with accommodations for allergies and some preferences stated ahead), and there is no discussion of a menu or money. (Note that lunch is different, and cheaper, but there are plenty of lunch reviews, so I'll focus on dinner).\\n\\nI'll describe the eight + courses, but the photos are what you really want to look at.\\n\\nFirst course came in a black lacquer bento box with clam with sturgeon, Chef's Creek oyster with citrus and wasabi, Steamboat oyster with lobster, eggplant in dashi with group, a cup of mushrooms (shitake, trumpet, chanterell) in dashi. That was course one of 8.\\n\\nSecond came a soup with lobster tofu and lobster egg, shrimp coated in rice cracker, and mushrooms.\\n\\nThen third the sashimi course: spanish mackerel, cobia, arctic char with trout roe...beautiful.\\n\\nThen two different foie gras dishes. First, foie gras custard with West Coast uni, wasabi, oma dashi jelly, and slices of Burgundy truffles. Followed by seared foi gras slices over ground pine nuts (like a thin peanut butter) with figs.\\n\\nCourse six was the duck, which had been seared and stuffed with herbs. Seven little fire pots with tiny grills were assembled in front of us and topped with arugula from the front garden, slices of duck, mushrooms, and topped with a little Japanese pepper.\\n\\nBy course seven it was hard to keep eating, but we powered through. A bowl of grains--farrow, shortgrain rice, and wild rice--topped with a poached Lake Meadow egg, crispy brocolini, crispy duck skin, and mixed with confit duck and baby shitake, A small bowl of vegetable dashi was served on the side.\\n\\nTwo desserts followed, a tiny dorayaki (pancake filled with red bean cream) for one savory bite. Then frozen persimmon with cream and tiny bits of frozen meringue.\\n\\nAnd if that wasn't enough, Jen gave us each a tiny box filled with petit four to take home. \\n\\nIn sum, this was really more than a meal. It was an aesthetic experience. \\n\\nOf course, East End Market is a business incubator, and Kappo is incubating. They have seven seats and no phone, and it's intentionally not easy to get a reservation (which is apparently making some people angry). I hear they are taking reservations for several months out now. That's fine, as it's giving them time to learn (not about food, which they are clearly experts on, but about kitchen costs and prep time and so on). Also, this food isn't going to be for everyone--it's rich, much of it is raw, the textures are often creamy. And Mark, Lo, and Jen are working very hard to give each of the seven people each dish, assembled carefully by hand. This wouldn't work a a high volume concept, and they certainly can't stop to answer the phone while they are assembling your sashimi. So if you think it's for you, send them an email and they will get back to you. It will be worth the wait."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Had lunch here with the wife and we ordered sausage, brisket and pork ribs with some sweet tea. Sausage is home made and very good, the brisket literally melted in our mouths, the ribs were ok, they had a lot of fat and the sweet tea was tasty. The 2 sauces that they have at the table are not your ordinary bbq sauces but man were they good! The sides they give you which are coleslaw, potato salad and beans weren't that good. The coleslaw was different than your regular coleslaw. It had oil and vinegar instead of mayo, the potato salad was a brown orange color and I couldn't tell why it was that color, but they weren't bad. The beans weren't sweet or spicy but they were like pinto beans but weren't so good. \\n\\nService was very fast and attentive. We'll definitely go back when we are craving bbq even though we live a hour away. The open pit is a thing of beauty as well!"},{"name":"King Bao","address":"710 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"I was so excited to finally try this out after convincing my mom to be adventurous and try something new. I knew that I loved baos and I couldn't wait to try a restaurant just for baos! I got the three bao combo with Glen Rhee, Mr. Potato Head, and the Hogzilla. They were all very good, but I definitely had a favorite: the glen Rhee. \\nMany people have been talking about pork belly  and I had never had it so I decided to give it a try. The flavor was almost sweet and very good but I just didn't like the texture as much as a pulled pork. I'm the person that trims meat down a lot though, so you definitely need to give it a try if you have never had it before. \\nThe only problem my mom and I had with the restaurant is the lack of seating(which I know the restaurant can't help) and the air conditioner. Right when we walked in we noticed that it was very hot. I'm not sure if it was because it was an open kitchen or because their AC was broken, but it was not pleasant in the hot Florida heat. \\nOverall, I hope I can return and try some new baos!"},{"name":"Ocean Wave By Harry And Sons","address":"820 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Without a doubt, as sure as I can be, the best sushi I've had in all of Atlanta.

My co-workers were very happy with the choice, and we were able to sample a lot of the lunch menu.\\n\\nCHARCUTERIE\\nThe charcuterie boards for lunch are unfortunately preset, and you cannot customize them. There were perfectly crispy baguette slices that came on the boards, and you can ask your waiter for more bread if you have a large party.\\nSalty Pig Board (+): Definitely the better board to order. The baguette perfectly complemented the pork shoulder and smoked pork pieces. The Stracciatella cheese was flavorful and a really big hit with our table.\\nCured Board: I did not enjoy the jar of meat that came with the board. There was a layer of cold fat coating the top of it. \\n\\nSALAD\\nBaby Kale Salad: The salad was overpowered by the large pear pieces and dressing. \\nEscarole Salad (+): This was the better option of the two. There were salami pieces, hard boiled egg, and cheese chunks that gave the salad a variety of flavors and textures. Definitely choose this salad as a starter!\\n\\nPIZZA\\nPeperonata (+) This was the best pizza of the three that we had tried. The sausage was rich, flavorful, and salty, perfectly mixing with the chunks of goat cheese that were cooked in each slice. \\nMargherita: A classic pizza to accomodate those who felt like they were eating too much meat. Nothing special to report here, besides the fact that the pizzas were cooked very well - crispy on the crust without being dry, and moist with structure towards the center of the pie.\\nThe Salty Pig: I was kind of disappointed with this pizza, since it was called \\"Salty Pig pizza\\" and seems like this would be the pizza that they're known for. There was various cuts of meat that basically tasted like cold cuts that were warmed with arugula sprinkled on top of it. Although there were mustard and pale ale caramel incorporated into the pizza, I really couldn't taste it.\\n\\nBEER\\nGet the coffee beer!

I've visited this location several times over several years. I identified this location as my place to decompress before going home. Before leaving I usually purchase a  lunch the following day. This particular day after 8:30 PM, I walked in and stood at the 'wait to be seated sign'. I was the first and only person in line. I stood there for 25 minutes. The waitress would look at me periodically and continued to provide customer service to existing/seated customers. She walked to the cash register several times to process payments for others. The cash register was located near the 'wait to be seated' sign. No acknowledgement. No head nod. No 'I will be with you in a moment'. No 'Take a seat and I'll be with you'. I was extremely DISAPPOINTED. The waitress would look at me and I would smile back. Nothing said to me. She was not that busy. She could have easy seated me or told me to seat myself. A concerned Lady (a table of four / all over age 50) took notice to me and invited me to seat with her family. I politely said 'thank you' and told her I was patient. The waitress heard the conversation. Still no acknowledgement. The concerned Lady got up and walked over to me again and told me to take a seat. I seated myself. The waitress came  over and took my order. She was so lackluster and depressing.  Still no apology and/or fake excuse for such treatment. I gave her my order and I looked at her like 'what is her problem'. I went the entire day without eating and too tired to address the situation. I just wanted a peaceful moment to relax. She didn't feel a need to periodically check whether or not I need something during my meal. I sat there thinking .. good thing I can see the cook preparing my food and placing it thru the window, otherwise I would not have trusted her to retrieve my food from the back. After I finished eating, I asked for my receipt and the waitress informed that the meal was free. I thought the waitress handled the bill, considering the poor customer service. Something told me to ask her why. The waitress informed me the concerned Lady paid for my meal. That was extremely nice of the concerned Lady. I wanted to thank her. I looked around, but the table of four already left the restaurant .There were several waitresses working the floor, however they looked at me, but no walked over to me to provide a seat. I assumed the other waitresses could not seat me, because they had to comply with the customer seating rotation policy, whereby customers are assigned to waitresses/servers upon entering the restaurant. I guess this particular day/night I was assigned to a section covered by a waitress who didn't have any more TIME or ENERGY to properly serve me nor APOLOGIZE for ignoring me.  I always leave a tip. This time I didn't want to leave a tip. However, to make myself feel good AND combat the negative energy received by the waitress, I left an undeserving $2 tip. She actually thanked me for the tip.

Finding a good Peruvian place in Orlando is hard compared to how it is growing up in Miami. The lunch specials here Monday through Saturday are amazing. For about $9 you can get a appetizer and a main plate with a soda from the select lunch menu (which comes with choices to select for each). Papa la huacaina is solid choice to get if you are not familiar with the dishes. It's is a creamy cheese sauce over baked slices of potatoes, romaine lettuce and a sliced boiled egg on the side. The sauce is thick and refreshing especially when you add a piece of romaine lettuce to your fork. Mmm! The lomo saltado and the tallar√≠n verde is my recommendation to get for the main lunch plate. Lomo saltado if you don't know is long pieces if cut steak saut√©ed with purple onions and tomatoes and platted with French fries and rice and topped with cilantro. My second favorite is the tallar√≠n verde which is spinach pesto sauce on the pasta and comes with grilled chicken.

I called in hopes of putting my name on a waiting list only to be told I only could once I arrived. I arrived about 8:30 pm on this particular night, but to my delight , they seated me relatively quickly and easily. \\nThe atmosphere gives off your typical Hibachi style restaurant with teppanyaki grills surround bu seats filled with mixed parties ranging in sizes. We were seated on the end of a half full table and our drink orders and food choices were taken while waiting on our cook to arrive. We were stalled with onion soup and an appetizer salad while we waited which was pretty tasty , but a mere tease to what we really came for. The chef arrived about 15 means later with his assortment of meats and ingredients and begins to get to work on everyone's order. I decided upon the hibachi steak and chicken entree with an upgrade of fried rice for roughy $3.50 extra which I found a pointless tax , but oh so worth the sacrifice. My final spread was prepared after about 15 mins of cooking from our chef which consisted of garlic noodles , two appetizer shrimp pieces ,a  zucchini vegetable medley , fried rice , grilled chicken , and my steak piece cooked medium well. Everything was cooked extremely well and adequately seasoned. Portion sizes are pretty generous here , so come hungry and ready to feast but that all comes with a hefty $$$ price range . I definitely enjoyed my experience and would easily come here over a competitor like Benihana. Nakato is easily one the best hibachi establishments in metro Atlanta."},{"name":"Barcelona Inman Park","address":"240 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"HALF OFF WINE BOTTLES !

Obviously we're willing to go get one at Costco (not claiming these are excellent dogs, but I think they're good) when we want a quick, cheap fix, but the hot dogs at MADdogs have a special place in your hot dog repertoire. It's actually pretty difficult to find a good hot dog at a restaurant, because generally it's not one of the main items that they offer. Usually it's just an afterthought when put on a menu. At least, in my experience. I feel like maybe the west coast doesn't appreciate them as much as the east coast- specifically NY, where they have a lot of good hot dogs.\\nAnyway, back to MADdogs. I really enjoy this place for their unique offerings and abundance of options. I've tried the mac and cheese dog and the chili dog, as well as the chili tots and the nacho tots. They have a really good lunch deal. \\nThe mac and cheese dog is great. I mean, can you go wrong with that combination? I doubt it. Unless you specifically try to fail. The chili dog was great too, the chili on top was top notch. I far prefer this chili dog over Pink's in Los Angeles, just saying. Both of these hot dogs (mac and cheese, chili) are messy to eat, so be warned! The different tater tot sides I've tried have also been so good! It's a lot of food and we generally don't finish our meal. To us, the price is completely worth it.

The butter was quite smooth and artisanal, but 8 bucks for bread seemed a bit excessive.  It was however the highlight.\\n\\nNext up was the swordfish lardo.  I see many people like this, but we all felt it was quite 'fishy.'   While I realize it is fish, the flavor was a bit strong and salty.  Maybe it meant to be that way to go with the beers, but we were not fans.\\n\\nWe then tried snacks for the table.  Just to be clear, this was more snacks for one.  Small portions for sure.  I did think the beans were nicely charred.  The broccoli arancini was good stuff.  But the rest of the plate was so-so.\\n\\nAfter trying the appetizers, we decided to move on elsewhere for dinner.

He was quick to greet us and provided drinks immediately. He recommended a dish not on the menu called Dirty Bird- 2 waffle sliders with chicken, medium egg, pepper gravy. We asked if it was big enough to share and he said yes... but we did get a side of grits. I was worried after We ordered the meal would be too heavy and a gut bomb but it was the opposite. The waffle was light and fluffy, the egg perfectly cooked with yolk yumminess, the chicken - wow, just wow - it was incredibly juicy and perfectly seasoned, the gravy was not heavy or thick it was smooth and delish! The gravy had the right amount of black pepper to taste everything all together. Demetrice also said I brought the syrup for a reason - oh my - just add a dot of syrup and you are in flavor town! The grits were creamy and no extra butter was necessary. Demetrice asked if we liked our meal and I told him I would lick the plate clean if it was not rude. This place is reasonably priced for the amount of food you receive. The portions are more than enough for two people. The environment was clean and a hoppin joint. Parking - well we parked a few blocks away but honestly this place is worth the walk! I look forward to our next food adventure here and hoping to see Demetrice again.

What he needs to understand is that customers don't come back because the cupcakes and his attitude are terrible. \\n\\nSome friends were in town on another occasion and we were in the Brookhaven plaza, so they wanted to try them.  I told them that it wasn't too good, but I like to give new businesses a chance (which is why I'm just writing this review).  Exact same thing!

The French toast was decadence personified, sweet, crunchy french toast with the perfect amount of syrup and crumble to send flavor bursting thru your tastebuds. The dirty bird chicken and waffles was a great balance of savory and sweet and was jam packed with flavor! We cannot say enough good things about this restaurant and will definitely be back. The washrooms are located in the back of the restaurant and have multiple stalls for men and women. The restaurant is wheel chair accessible, but if you do not park directly in front, I'm unsure as to where additional parking might be located. My pictures do not do it justice but we will definitely be back!

I wanted the ginger and spicy sauces that came with the Hainanese dish. We also ordered the duck confit frybread which was definitely new to me.

I remember barely making our dinner reservation, then having to go back to the office afterwards, because the federal habeas corpus petition of the death row inmate whose case my boss had been appointed to was due the following day.  Despite my crazy mindset that evening, the food, atmosphere, and impeccable service at Basil's did me right, and offered an oasis of indulgence in an otherwise utterly stressful day.\\n\\nI think my fond memories of what was once here make it more difficult to swallow this rather contrived incarnation of this space.  From the Screaming Goat name (please tell me what a screaming goat has to do with tacos and hamburgers - and no, they do not serve cabrito here) to the gratuitously-suggestive saying painted in the bathroom (\\"It's not the size that matters\\" - what?), I just didn't get it.  The very young-seeming patrons in front of us in line didn't help, either (\\"Oh. Mah. Gawd.

I'm accustomed to fish tacos being served with an aioli; this one came with just fish, iceberg lettuce, tomato, cilantro, and a lime, on my choice of corn, wheat, or flour tortilla.  I chose the wheat, and it tasted a bit stale; surprising, since the guy working the counter told me that all the tortillas were purchased from someplace that made them the night before.  My request for salsa was met with a tinge of annoyance, then I was presented with a plastic cup of their \\"hot\\" green salsa, which was anything but hot.  \\n\\nI did have a great time here, but it had everything to do with the juicy stories told by my day's co-conspirator for spontaneous fun and really nothing at all to do with the size - or lack thereof - of any screaming goats."},{"name":"Little Big Burger","address":"3810 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"We walked over to Little Big Burger for dinner.

($38). The Parmigiano were nutty nuggets to complement the mild saltiness of the prosciutto. This ham was the best I have tasted...even better than what we had in Rome 4 years ago. I didn't care for the shallots, my daughter liked the variety of olives and the accompanying crostini was buttery crisp to lay the meat and cheese. \\n\\nThere is no kids meal, so my daughter had the Margherita pizza. Nice, cracker crisp crust with fresh basil and not overpowered with fresh mozzarella.

It really wasn't a tomato sauce that Americans expect, but nicely glazed the shells with a flavoring I can't place. It was saltier than the prosciutto we started with. My husband got the dinner portion which he couldn't finish. I don't think it was a huge portion, so I suspect he was a bit disappointed in his choice. \\n\\nI had the lunch portion of the bucatini and clams. The clams were small and succulent over the pasta. Delicious with bits of crunch from the bacon. Not salty bacon. It reminded me of the Filipino dish pancit Palabok but much lighter sauce and less salty.  I would get this again. \\n\\nThe place had great music in the background. You can watch them prepare your board and pizza by the bar. There is outdoor seating.

I didn't understand why she couldn't come to the table prior to let us know what was going on and to let us know that she would be with us in a couple minutes instead of waiting a whole 30 minutes. In the end I think she refused to take us because we had to wait a little more for a server to finally get our drinks and put our food in. And yet again i witnessed her serve all her other tables brought them cups and gave them great service besides us and I'm thinking it's because she thought she wasn't going to get tipped because we were black and majority of the people at the table was teenagers.

I've lived on and off in Atlanta for 5+ years, been told I needed to come here, read I needed to come here, heck even the \\"Stuff You Should Know Guys\\" mentioned Antico Pizza in a Podcast.  But I just hadn't made it over there til just now.\\n\\nGood choice.  Antico was just as it had been described: a small pizza outpost off a side street near Georgia Tech, packed to the gills with people on an average Thursday night, with some of the most efficient waitstaff and pizza makers ever seen, and more plastic cups of booze than you've seen since your last frat party (no Solo cups though, thankfully).  \\n\\nWe were a group of three last night: me, my boyfriend and one of our good friends.  We managed snag a spot in the tiny parking lot a little before 7:30 and went in prepared for \\"an experience.\\"  And what an experience it was!!  \\n\\nBased on my readings and my boyfriend's preferences, we ordered two pizzas to split between the three of us: the Diavola (spicy meatballs, cheese and red pepper) and the San Gennaro (sweet roasted red pepper, paper thin salsiccia ham, cheese and carmelized onions).  They were both whisked out to us just minutes after we'd secured the end of one of the large communal picnic tables in the noisy back room where the pizzas were being made and baked.  And they were magnificent!\\n\\nOur friend had the good forethought to bring actual wine glasses to accompany our meal, so wine at the ready we all three dug in the eager anticipation now at an end.  \\n\\nWhat fantastic pizza!  The more I think about it, the more I'm impressed.  Not only was everything delicious but those were also some of the most unique pizzas I've ever had toppings-wise.  I know the toppings are all pretty traditional Italian toppings, but they were done to such a level of perfection that it seemed brand new again.  The meatballs were obviously homemade, the sweet red peppers were fresh and spicy, the salsiccia was very salty, cheese was uniquely flavorful and the pizzas were thin, crispy and had just the right amount of char on the bottom that managed to work its way under my fingernails.  Perfection to a level I've rarely experienced elsewhere.\\n\\nWe ended up staying till closing time that evening chatting, people watching and enjoying our wine.  Antico Pizza is definitely a place you like to linger despite the crowd, din, heat from the pizza ovens and general noise.  It's fun, it's unique, it's not to be done on a regular basis (or else I'd need sweat pants).\\n\\nThis is definitely a treat, and if you're a pizza fan - especially of the really traditional, Italian-style, Antico Pizza's sure to please."},{"name":"McGrath's Fish House","address":"12501 SE Second Cir","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"The worst experience I ever had.

This is the truth, sorry if you were duped, like I was. What they do offer is what the rest of the world already calls \\"Stew\\". Albeit liquified, it is simply stew, aka Dinty Moore/ Soylent Green, but liquified and with less meat. The other truth here is that it's not really \\"cheap\\". A Costco hotdog with bottomless fountain soda for $1.50 is cheap and delicious. $7.50 with zero add-on's nor drink and the ubiquitous tip jar for cafeteria style dining leaves you at $7.50-12+ depending on sides, drink and your level of shame for gratuity. I paid $10.50 for stew with spinach side, soda and tip. My guilt to tip was high that day.\\nThis all for a stew that doesn't necessarily suck but really doesn't offer more than a peasant food consisting of simple flavored, simple textured goop. Also note that the sides are served cold. Yes, I paid a dollar for someone to put cold cooked spinach on my plate of liquified peasant stew and rice, yippee! That really makes it so much more appalling (auto-correct's word choice over my spelling of a sarcastic word choice, a not so sarcastic word but more appropriate). Don't make the same mistake by falling for the hype. If you're in the area and hungry go to Boxer, Bunchbox, or Luc Lac and eat happily anywhere else. I'm not a hater, and I'm happy to see that other people are enjoying this establishment's food, good for you! I think the decor is quaint, Japaneesy, and pleasantly peasanty.

But now it's just a stone's throw from an upscale neighborhood down the road. Although it is no longer that fabled and secluded BBQ joint hidden in the quintessential Texas hill country ...surrounded by Bluebonnets and cacti alike, it's still reminiscent of the olden days. Thanks to it's weathered and rustic good looks, it takes you back in time. You imagine this place way out here all by its lonesome years ago. A place where Austinites and tourists alike traveled (without the aid of GPS) to get some of the area's finest slow-smoked BBQ. \\n\\nAside from amazing BBQ at this destination, I think the distance and little travel adventure was definitely part of its allure. Being far from civilization made it feel special. Gave it character. My first visit to SLBBQ +/- 20 years ago required us to use an actual map. Austin was smaller then so it seemed to take that much longer to reach Driftwood from Austin's then southern outskirts. Today, it's grown as they've made additions and expanded to accommodate more people. But anyway some things certainly haven't changed.

The French toast was cooked nicely. I would've liked a couple more peaches because they were cooked well & I'm greedy. Our son had the pork sausage, scrambled eggs, grits and a biscuit. That was good too. Our server was attentive and very nice and the manager stop by our table to say hello and check on us. He did this to several tables. I would suggest using Yelp to get on their waitlist. When we got on their waitlist it was 31 parties ahead of us, when we got to the restaurant there were only 8. We waited about 20 minutes in the car waiting on us to get closer to the list.

I laughed to myself at the few ppl politely requesting their orders - this is a NY style spot & as a native NYer I promise you we don't consider yelling or not saying \\"please\\" or \\"thanks\\" as impolite. Anyhoo I ordered the Reuben with turkey & an Atlanta dog. The Reuben was tasty though for the price I thought it could've been larger. The turkey was fresh & tasty & the kraut had a nice bite that went well with the sammy. But let's get into that dog though! Disclosure: I don't generally eat hot dogs but for me, part of the fun of eating out is occasionally trying things not part of my usual diet. The Atlanta dog is a hulking monster drowned in cheese, chili & coleslaw & resting in a hoagie roll. That joint was YUGE! Flavor wise there was a lot going on & I don't recommend eating this in mixed company as it's delectably messy. I probably needed a bib while eating but I was in the privacy of my home watching Netflix so it was all good! Anyhoo, good spot for authentic sandwiches.

The weather ALMOST turned us off to going this weekend, but then we saw the positive in it being a \\"slow\\" day, which really it kind of was because the longest we waited in a line was about an hour? Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts, but of course.\\n\\nPARKING is $17, but $25 for Preferred Parking, which is WAY closer and you don't even have to walk far. For an extra $7, we just did it, because why not? After being at parks ALL day why would you want to walk even MORE just to get to your car? It's worth it especially if you come a little before the park opens so you can just park right next to the escalators in the front.\\n\\nMoving on, I'm not sure why this park has fewer stars than Islands of Adventure because this park was WAY more fun, but that may be because Wizarding World of Harry Potter has been in Island's of Adventure longer. The rides here were more interesting to my husband and I! We rode pretty much everything and even watched Beetlejuice's Graveyard Mash Up and Disaster! (which was SUPER funny, mad street cred to Donnie and the \\"actors\\" that were chosen!!!). Out of all the rides, I think our favorite was Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts  (actually enjoyed it more than the other Harry Potter ride at IoA) and Revenge of the Mummy. But don't get us wrong, Men in Black, Transformers, and Despicable Me were super fun too! Did NOT like The Simpson's ride, something about that ride makes me SO nauseous every single time.\\n\\nTIP: BUY THE DINING PLAN, IT IS SOOOOO FREAKING WORTH IT (https://www.universalorlando.com/Restaurants/Dining-Plan.aspx). My husband got the $26 dining plan with unlimited drinks in a souvenir cup all day and I just got the $20 one since I'm not much of a soda drinker. We brought snacks in the park too, so that helped up from buying too much crazy snacks. Each dining plan came with 1 Quick Service Meal, 1 Snack, and 1 Drink (again he had the souvenir cup with unlimited refills and I had a regular drink). Almost all the places to eat in both parks are Quick Service Meal areas. We ended up eating at The Leaky Cauldron in Diagon Alley where the meals were from $10-$20 and our dining plans covered any one we chose (although Butter Beer counts as a snack, which was fine). Again, BUY IT, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.\\n\\nIn regards to the souvenir cups with free refills, you get a \\"Freestyle Souvenir\\" cup with a chip built-in to the bottom of the cup. When you go to a machine to refill it, you set it on the machine and refill your drink and a message will come onto the screen for how many hours you have left to use it (they give you something like 16hrs to use the cup at the park). We refilled it at least 3 times pretty much paying off the whole cup. This dining plan saved us a TON of money.\\n\\nLast, but not least, MARDI GRA AT UNIVERSAL. Parada starts a couple hours before the park closes, like 645-7pm I believe, and it's so much fun. SO MANY BEADS EVERYWHERE. Music and the energy was completely amazing. Right after the parade was the Heart concert (not entirely sure who they are sad to say, but they had a humongous crowd). We took a peek then decided to leave shortly after.\\n\\nOH YEAH, AND FREE WIFI.\\n\\n-------\\n\\nExtra Tips:\\n\\nIF YOU GO WHEN IT'S RAINING: Either buy an umbrella or a poncho before you go in if you don't feel like getting wet (if not, they have them for sale in the park). My husband and I sucked it up (but his poor shoes got soaked). Luckily I wore boots and I had a jacket, but the material absorbed the rain. The rain showers were so on an off and we were always entering a ride or a store so we would dry off and then get rained on again.\\n\\nWARNING: A lot of the rides require you put your bag in a locker so it doesn't fall out during the ride. Don't worry, it's FREE while you ride and gives you a certain amount of time for it to be free (which really does cover you being in line and until after you're done with the ride). \\n\\nSMOKERS: You can smoke out at CityWalk anywhere, but when you're in the parks, there are Smoking Areas. They are EVERYWHERE though, so don't fret.\\n\\nIf you run out of cigarettes, the Men in Black Store at Universal AND The Port of Entry Christmas Shoppe at Islands of Adventure SELL cigarettes, they are just hidden behind the counter. WARNING, you will be paying $10."},{"name":"Mozart's Coffee Roasters","address":"3825 Lake Austin Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The location on the waterfront and the building structure with its outdoor patios is excellent plus!

My boyfriend and I came here every week when we started dating, and now we split our time between here and the Somerville location since I live with him North of town instead of in Brighton. It's so much more of a trek, but I swear this one's better. Not to mention that our favorite server works at this one way more often (I promise we'll be visiting soon, girl).\\n\\nMy whole life I was a spicy miso freak. When I discovered real Japanese ramen I was picking up a new package of miso to cook with like every week. But Totto has shown me the light-- and it tastes like chicken. \\n\\nTotto's specialty is its paitan broth, a slightly thick and intensely flavorful accompaniment to the fatty, tender char siu pork. The spicy is my go to bowl, and while I do need another scoop of rayu for it to be just the right shade of red, it's an experience either way. There are plenty of options to customize your ramen, from char siu chicken to avocado to spicy bamboo shoots. I get mine extra rayu, wakame, and a boiled egg. I have also had several chances to have the Mega, capital m on purpose. The huge portion of ramen boasts several different preparations of pork (all delicious in their own right) and the garlic does make things even more interesting. I like my Mega spicy as well, but it's hard to get enough rayu to flavor my ramen without drawing looks (or paying three more dollars).\\n\\nI did have to at least try the spicy miso here, and it was good. I like the rayu here a lot, and I feel like miso is hard to screw up, but if I wanted miso ramen I wouldn't come here for it.\\n\\nIf you've never had paitan ramen before, this is the place to try it!"},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow!

It is my go-to sushi place when I want to get good, reasonably priced (cheap even) sushi. It's the type of restaurant where you order and pay at the counter and you can dine in or take out your food. They do bring your food to your table if you choose to dine in but you'd be the one to toss our your trash/bring back the plates, but it's not actual service like a regular restaurant where you'd get your water refilled and such, which is totally fine because this is supposed to be a casual quick bite. \\n\\nI have so many favorites/go-to orders here; some include the chirashi bowl (only $14 for a variety of fish on top of rice), their bento boxes are worth it (usually I'd go for the unagi deluxe bento which comes with unagi on top of rice with a side of sushi and shumai), and thai tea slush. Their combos are worth it as well; you get three sushi rolls and a drink for 18-21$, and you can switch out rolls if you prefer. I'm not sure whether or not they'd charge you differently, but these combos can be shared between two people so it's still pretty cheap. Rolls that I'd recommend would be the the fiesta maki, seared salmon maki, and the atlantic maki. Definitely try the crab rangoon and sweet potato fries. \\n\\nThey also have a lot of vegetarian options as well; I have a friend who would always consider going here when he wants lunch. They're usually pretty busy at peak times (after school for the high schoolers near by and around dinner time), so I'd call first to order if you're taking the food out if you don't want to wait in there for too long.

I thought drinks should have a standard when you're offering some drink specials at $3 but oh well.\\n\\nI snagged some of my friend's Lobster Pasta. It had a great taste but it only had one claw in the entree and the rest just looked like mac and cheese but with lobster sauce in the mix.

So, let's get started with the not so great (because nothing is very bad there), which is some aspects of the brunch and the steak. On one of my visits, I tried out the brunch with 3 other companions where we had an assortment of waffles, paella and the bon matin. I thoroughly enjoyed the paella although I can't say it is close to real spanish paella, but the flavors were good. The waffles were a bit of a disappointment since they were just okay but definitely not memorable - same with the bon matin. On another visit we had the La Pi√®ce de Boeuf which was just okay. Maybe I'm spoiled with Alberta beef, but this dish was a little sub-par for me. The flavors were there but the meat was a bit chewy and not as tender as I was hoping. Besides these small things which aren't truly bad, I've had a fantastic experience at Chambar. My favorite dish and something I get everytime is the Moules Frites Congolaise. Again, maybe it's because I'm from Alberta but the mussels each time have been so fresh and so big. I have come back here day after day just for this dish. \\n\\nIt is a pretty busy place so unless you have reservations or go during non-peak hours you won't get a seat in the dining room.

From Southern breakfasts to down home BBQ and sweets, Atlanta is ripe with culinary goodness.\\n\\nOn my last morning before heading home, my family and I decided to take a quick dip into Atlanta's much hyped Atlanta Breakfast Company.\\n\\nBelieve the hype my friends. I came wanting to sample some of Georgia's best Fried Chicken Biscuits and Gravy.  And what I wanted--I got. This ain't yo Mamma's fried chicken folks! \\n\\nI was thrilled that my food looked just as good and even better than the photographs. This chicken was tender, juicy, flavorful, not overpowering yet perfectly complimented by black pepper gravy and nicely cooked biscuits. I think I can say winner winner, chicken dinner.\\n\\nMy daughter and husband both ordered the chicken and waffles and both were extremely satisfied. My son ordered the regular French toast and my hubby and I shared a side order of the melt in your mouth Peach Cobbler French Toast, which was outstanding. Loved the touch of the Georgia Peaches sitting right on top.\\n\\nThe dining room is beautifully and casually outfitted and the ambience is perfect for family and friends. There will be a line when you drive up but don't despair! Check in on the waitlist feature on Yelp while you are still in your hotel room. You will cut down on your hour wait time considerably and be able to arrive just in time for your table to be ready. Park in the garage across the street.\\n\\nI will end by saying that my most favorite part of the Atlanta Breakfast Company is the atmosphere. These wonderful people are some of the happiest people around. From the adorable hostess shimmying in between seating people to the lively and chatty waitress and even extending to the courteous clean up staff, the energy here was electric--both alive and exciting.

Nothing out of this world in my opinion.\\nWhile I understand it is a new operation, it is unacceptable to put customers to wait that long.

Then In an frustrated tone she said, 'I have solved your problem' and looked like she was ready to walk away. I said wasting food isn't a good solution. I told her that there are many places  to go for dinner in the city and this had been an unpleasant experience.

Growing up with In-N-Out, Fuddruckers, Fatburger, Hamburger Hamlet and others, I took quality for granted and perhaps mistook abundance of choice with a true variety of options. I can't count how many times I have found myself somewhere in our great nation unable to acquire a good example of perhaps the most American food served. In would could be described as the hamburger world's equivalent to the third-world coffee revolution, a slew of new franchises and local celebrity restaurants have come about in the last decade or so. This is mostly restricted to metropolitan centers though, save for that random Five Guys one finds in the middle of Ohio. They focus on quality and flavor more explicitly, and take pride in the provenance of sourced ingredients. Although good for the world of tasty hamburgers, this can lead to homogenization and palate fatigue, I'd guess.\\n\\nBack to Little Big... Visiting was convenient so I came on a quiet afternoon and ordered your standard cheddar-burger, fries, and a coke. It was the best burger I've had in months and I immediately found a new favorite. The brioche bun is wonderful in flavor and texture, perfecting capping the burger and its accouterment. The package really is little but big, filling and substantive whilst remaining easy to hold and bite, and visually appealing. This reminded me a bit of Umami Burger, mostly because both businesses/chains produce their own ketchup (both a bit spicy as well). I love this aspect of both, I should mention. It also reminded me of Fatburger, that is, the burger itself, as well as the accompanying relish. The \\"fry sauce\\" is a nice addition (In-N-Out killer?) though added relish would add to its texture favorably in my opinion. The house-made catsup is delicious. The fries are thin and crunchy, on the crispier side, and salty/truffle-ish in flavor. I wish they had a \\"fat fry\\" option ala Fatburger, where someone can order fluffy under-done potato fries. Little Big's fries lose their potato-essence in some respect. I've tried the cheddar, goat, and swiss, and loved them all. The drink selection is great. All-in-all, it is a small menu, but for this lovely local chain to scale and sustain relatively low prices and high-quality, I applaud them. \\n\\nHighly-recommended!"},{"name":"Paulo's Bbq","address":"17683 B SW Farmington Rd","city":"Aloha","stars":"3.5","text":"Overpriced and bland, to quickly sum it up. \\n\\nThe prices are way too high for what you are getting.

The sauce (I got the red, mild) is ok but I think I should have gone for medium because it added nothing to the sandwich in terms of flavor or spice. And the mac and cheese didn't seem to contain cheese, just mac in a roux, really.\\n\\nI came in for lunch at 1:00 on a Wednesday and there was no one - literally, not a single other customer - in the place. The plates were all north of $10 if I remember right (and if I don't, I apologize but I'm sure not far off), which is a bit steep for bbq lunch in the burbs. Dinner, maybe.

It's because they're 100% juice.  You can get something straightforward like orange juice or red apple juice or a combination like pineapple, apple and ginger.  My all-time favorite is tangerine.  I've even branched out to vegetable juices.  While green juice is not visually appealing to me, I love Yoga 1, which includes kale and spinach among other things.  Smoothies are equally good.  \\n\\nArden Zinn promotes her juices and smoothies as part of a healthy lifestyle and even has juice cleanses and other programs she's developed.  The only problem is that pure juice has lots of sugar in it and one 15oz. bottle of orange juice has 48 carbs.\\nPeople I know who have tried juice cleanses struggle with weight gain.

Located in Buckhead, I missed my turn into the restaurant at first as I didn't see the sign for the restaurant until the last minute.  However was I was able to turn around I was immediately greeted by valet (it's complimentary to diners).  I don't believe they have self-parking, but I could be wrong- I just didn't see any.\\n\\nThe restaurant is a hibachi style however they also have regular chairs and tables if you prefer that over the hot grill and hibachi show.  Due to me the guest count being large we had to wait for everyone to arrive before we were seated. Once everyone finally came we were ushered to a private hibachi room where we had to remove our shoes before we could enter.  Once inside and settle everyone places their orders and show began.\\n\\nSince I'm vegan I did not order from the hibachi menu.  However I did have the miso soup and sushi.  I really enjoyed the miso soup here.  It was hot, flavorful, and best of all no tofu-like some restaurants like to include.  For the sushi rolls, I ordered an avocado roll which was really good as well as the Kaiware roll (spicy radish sprouts)- I just say I won't be ordering that one again. Along with a sweet peach cocktail--wish I could take a pitcher of this to-go home with me...lol\\n\\nThough I didn't get the hibachi meal everyone at my travel who did enjoyed their foods.  Once thing I notice about this restaurant that have notice about other hibachi restaurant is that they provide you noodles and rice with your order.  Where as most places only provide rice.

They are painfully cute and sweet and definitely contribute positively to the overall dining experience. You can tell they love what they do and take pride in their restaurant (Bangkok opened in 1977, claiming to be \\"the first Thai restaurant in Atlanta\\"). Everyone there was regulars and didn't ask for a menu before ordering. The ladies told us that if you order the same dish several times or make any interesting changes to one of the menu choices, they'll name it after you (\\"David's Special Tilapia\\" was on the chalkboard the day I went). The fried ice cream seems to be a popular dish.\\n\\nThe view is priceless. The huge windows provide a view of the busy Monroe and Piedmont intersection and a local homeless hangout. I lost my appetite a tad as I watched a homeless dude with burn scars eat out of a trashcan, licking his fingers after. I also kept myself entertained by ogling at least 20 glistening, sweaty, gay man bodies running on the sidewalk. The restaurant is small and very old, but I thought it was clean and nicer than others have thought, and I definitely didn't notice a smell.\\n\\nI had the shrimp salad, and my mom ordered the \\"Shrimp Ashore\\". My salad was crisp, refreshing, and flavorful, and the shrimp were perfectly cooked. If you ask for it very hot like I do, they'll do it - you'll go through at least a few glasses of water, but don't despair - they'll refill it before you begin to suffer. My mom has been eating Thai for decades, and she rarely ever cleans her plate. She spoke highly of her dish at Bangkok and ate every bite.\\n\\nIf you want to dress up and go to the \\"it\\" place of the moment, don't go here.

For our main course, we ordered the pescado de coco and camarones al ajillo. The fish was full of flavor of coconut. Very rich and creamy. As for the shrimps, they were good size and delightful.

I must say first impressions were not good- starting with the ridiculous parking. This was 5:30pm on a Friday; the place was dead but 6 out of their 8 parking spots had cones in front of them. The valet stand was empty. We drove around the block looking for parking but found nothing. We went back to the still empty valet stand and I hopped out and told the hostess that we'd like to eat here but we can't park our car. Could I just move a cone and park there? Very annoying. Eventually the valet showed up and took our car. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself was less than impressive. It was small and dark- but without that cozy, intimate feel. The dark colors made the low ceiling feel even lower and the building had an uneven feel like it had been added on to over the years. But from here on things were wonderful. Thanks to our awesome server, Brett, who offered suggestions that hit the mark. He was efficient, friendly and accommodating. The onions rings were amazing- super crunchy with a nice seasoning. They went perfectly with my Banana Bread Beer (Brett recommended) which sounded strange but the banana was well suited for the hoppiness of the beer. I also tried the sweet potato fries but would not get them again.\\n\\nFor main I ordered the Chicken and Waffles ($12.95) which was sinfully rich and put me back about 2 weeks worth of exercise. The two rather smallish pieces of fried chicken were smothered in a rich, delicious gravy set next to waffle pieces. We were so full by the end there was no way we could sample any of the desserts in the front counter. We did get their signature stick of cotton candy with our check. Nice touch. \\n\\nWe noticed that they have two eating challenges. The first is The Widow Maker which is a huge hotdog (as long as a cafeteria tray, diagonally) topped with all types of nonsense.

The line was 2 hours long which we didn't seem to mind, it goes by quick. If you plan it right it's shorter, we planned it wrong apparently. Once inside it's super small. Seats 30 to 35 so the line is understandable. The service is great and fast. You feel like your eating in someone's home. The menu is mostly seafood. There are a few chicken, pasta and steak dishes but 90% is seafood. I was expecting to be blown away but to be honest i wasn't. It wasn't bad at all, it was good food but i think the 2 hour wait sets you up for disappointment when it's not the best meal you've ever eaten. The garlic bread was your average affair  same goes for table bread. The fried calamari, while good, didn't taste much better or worse than most I've had.  The shrimp and scallops scampi as well, not better or worse than most I've had. The dishes are fairly priced compared to the area and it's cash only. Not a bad deal. Its good food, just not \\"blow you away, worth a 2 hour wait\\" good. Plus you sort of feel pressured to eat quick and leave. Not by the staff at all, simply because you know it's s small place and 70 people are outside waiting (staring at you). Its like using the one bathroom at a party or night club. You simply won't take youre time. It's just psychological. Id recommend it if the line isn't long. You'll have a decent meal.

They have two types of noodles to choose from, one is straight and white (wheat noodles?) and the other is the tradition yellow chewier counterpart. I got mine with the wheat noodles and found it a little weird since its not the traditional ramen noodles, though I also order a extra order of noodles only where I specified the egg noodles and it definitely tastes better in my opinion.

I've gotta say Atlanta Georgia you've done it again, that was by far the best water I've tasted, and trust me I've had a glass or two.

There is live music in waiting area. Can waiting get any better than this? I think not. \\n\\nWe went on Thursday in middle of the day, and it took us only 20 mins to get the table. May be we just got lucky, not complaining at all. \\n\\nNow the food, I got the sausages, ribs and brisket with coleslaw and potato salad. \\n\\nTheir options for sides are limited, for me usually the sides I like for bbq are mac n cheese and fries but as they dont have those I just went with it and I actually loved them.\\n\\nColeslaw\\nI am not even a big fan of coleslaw but theirs not being creamy I loved it.\\n\\nPotato Salad\\nWas again amazing, with some onions in there, it was definitely one of the best potato salad I had.\\n\\nSausages\\nGreat, nicely smoked, loved them just not as much as the next thing. \\n\\nPork Ribs\\nYou know the ribs are amazing when they fall right off the bone and you can eat them easily with fork and knife creating no mess whatsoever. But whats the fun in that? Pick up that rib and eat it like a civilized human being. \\n\\nBrisket\\nThey ask you how you want your brisket, go with burned, their is no other way you would want this. Now even though I always love ribs the most, I cant deny the fact that this brisket was the best I ever had in my life and I would definitely fly back to Austin just for this. It was perfectly burned on the outside and so soft and juice. It just melted in my mouth. \\n\\nIf you want a suggestion of what to get, I would say just get brisket and you wont be missing anything, if you are big fan of ribs, may be get the brisket and ribs.

I suggest everyone in your group order something different, then sample a slice of each. \\n     You will receive a order number. Be sure to remember it as someone will be calling it out in the crowd shortly. There is seating just around the corner from the registers, but the true fun is through the next doorway. That is where the ovens and the dough room are. You just grab a seat where you can, no stranger's here. The pie(s) will be so quick you may just be sitting down when they call your order. \\nThis crust; thin and crunchy and slightly charred (that's how it's supposed to be).

Fantastic food, fantastic drinks and a great staff!\\n\\nThe Porter is one of the last great stops in Little Five Points, in my opinion.  It's unpretentious and easy-going, almost like a dive bar, but with so much more to offer.  I love the shotgun-style setting; it's intimate and has a rustic inner-city feel.  They have one of the greatest beer lists in the city, by far.  As much as I'd like to get into their whiskey and cocktail selection, I just can't seem to get enough of their beer list.\\n\\nAs for their food, it's absolutely fantastic.  The menu items change fairly regularly, but I haven't had anything here I haven't loved. A cheese and charcuterie board with amazing head cheese, a duck confit patty melt, an Asian fusion rice bowl...this is gastropub fare at its finest!

If you're a steak lover you're not going to be disappointed with it.  The dessert offerings were also very good - you can opt to go with the \\"Chef's Dessert Flight\\" which apparently varies based on when you get it, but when I ordered it we got 4 different desserts to try out; a nice variety and each of them were excellent.  The wine selection and pricing is not bad either.  \\n\\nService was also on point - we had a movie to get to and let the server know and she made sure we got everything more than fast enough to make the show (which is particularly impressive, given that we had a horrible experience with that sort of thing at a well-known downtown Orlando establishment the week before).\\n\\nAs for the setting, this is where this place may really shine.  The moment you walk in here you're basically transported to a legit Irish Pub.  They also have a stage at the front of the dining area (and one smaller one in the middle) where they periodically put on shows and dances.

The filling was well seasoned and tasted great with the properly cooked grape leaves. \\n\\nJoojeh Kabob: 4 out of 5. The chicken was well marinated and juicy, and the meat was tender. However, the rice was lacking flavor and we wished it was seasoned a bit more to compliment the chicken.

But the journey to finding great ramen in Boston was a long time coming.  Many Bostonians used to have no choice but to go to NYC for Ippudo or Totto.  Now, you can now save your bus fare or gas money because Totto Ramen of Boston is pretty much the same as the one in NY!\\n\\nExcited but unsure of what to expect, I stayed away the first two weeks while everyone in Boston rushed to Totto.  When I finally made it to Totto shortly after 5 PM, the wait time was only about 25 minutes.  To me, that is amazing and breezy.  The look and feel is typical of a ramen spot.  A large area is dedicated to the kitchen where patrons can overlook the chefs prepare the ramen.  The menu is relatively easy to navigate.  There is a small variety of ramen to choose from, then you can add your toppings as you please.\\n\\nTip:  Just get the mega ramen if it's your first time here.\\n\\nTotto Ramen uses chicken broth and that's how they made their name.  Mega Ramen is their top menu item.  The portion is generous here.  Especially after all my add-on toppings (and I tried to restrain myself from over adding), my bowl was monstrous.  Their broth was thick and rich but not salty at all!  Personally, I am pretty sensitive to sodium.  Even after adding my spicy bamboo shoots and rayu spice, the broth remained in tact with flavor.  The pork belly was just the right amount of fat and tenderness.  The ramen had an excellent bite to it and was definitely cooked!!  Maybe I lucked out because I have no problem with the food.  I guess my only complaint is while the egg was cooked to al dente, I would've preferred a runny egg yolk with my ramen.  That's a personal preference and I'm sure it could've been done if I asked.  So it's not a big deal.\\n\\nI ordered the Char Siu Bun (pork belly) to share and it comes in two pieces.  It was delicious and the sauce was lemon-y/sour, which I love.  However, I have always loved the type of pork belly that just melts in your mouth.  Not to say Totto Ramen's pork belly isn't well done, but it didn't give me the foodgasm I was hoping for.  The ramen is superb and honestly the pork belly is decent!  To anyone who still have doubts over the authenticity of this joint.. One of the chefs did travel from NY to help out so while it's not a perfect clone, I don't taste a big difference.  Maybe except I don't have to wait two hours for the same ramen.

We asked for the check one time during our visit and took 12 minutes for it come around and another 5 at least for her to come pick it up.

And, if I'm being honest, I need to tell you that we hadn't even planned on dining here. Our morning started with a 5 mile run in the cold and rain, and following a defrost and clean-up back at the hotel, we decided a hearty brunch was just the thing.\\n\\nWe did our research before leaving the hotel, and headed out to a highly-rated restaurant close-by. The wait was almost 2 hours. We couldn't back out of that place fast enough. Another quick Yelp search, and we were headed in the opposite direction, towards another highly-rated restaurant. They had a line out the door and down the street, and it was pouring rain by that point.\\n\\nFrustrated, hungry, and unwilling to randomly try another spot when the chances of another interminable wait were high, we decided to duck into Chambar (which was three doors down from spot number 2) to see what their wait was like.\\n\\nThough they had a good crowd near the hostess stand, she told us that we could get a table in 15 minutes. Sold!\\n\\nOur table was a low-tabled affair, with me on a cushy couch, and him on a backless, short stool. It didn't matter, though, because it was comfortable, and we were about to get our grub on.\\n\\nFirst things first, we ordered a couple of lattes. They were delicious, and expertly prepared. They were just the thing to warm you up from the inside out. \\n\\nFor brunch, I went with the short rib fricasee, which came with eggs, julienned apples, cheese, onions and potatoes. It sounded like it'd be a hot mess of a plate, but everything blended really well together. The different flavors and textures - which could have clashed - ended up being delicious on the palate. The short ribs were perfectly cooked - tender and flavorful. The eggs and potatoes added a nice heartiness to the cheese and apple. It was quite delicious, and I'm not ashamed to admit I ate the whole dang thing.\\n\\nMy husband, meanwhile, ordered the paella, which came with an egg, orzo, chorizo, salsa and cilantro. He couldn't tell me while he was eating it (too busy making yummy noises and chowing down), but later he did say it was an excellent dish.\\n\\nOur waitress was so super sweet and friendly, and never made us wait for refills on water or to clear out plates. \\n\\nIt was an accidental find, but one that we enjoyed immensely.

My daughter (who eats everything) said she didn't like her burger so I tried it and literally had to spit it out.  It was undercooked and really bland and mushy.

I was ecstatic as it was a beautiful day and since I hadn't eaten lunch yet, I would double up and get lunch and ice cream at the same time. After picking up ice cream at another stand, I didn't want to hold up the group and wanted to pick the closest and fastest option that seemed available. I saw Megumi and it immediately reminded me of the food court places. I remembered how quick they are, so in the interest of time, I quickly walked up to the register.\\n\\nFirst off, this is one of the stands at Faneuil Hall inside Quincy Market. It's on one end of the strip and not tucked away somewhere in middle. It looks very much like one of those places at the food court in malls where you can just get some rice and stirfy-style chicken teriyaki. Let me tell you that this place is REALLY not the same. This place is honestly not good.\\n\\nInstead of getting steamed white rice, I opted to pay an extra $0.50 to get noodles instead which they heat up on the flat grill as well and pour a tiny bit of teriyaki sauce on it. They also offer vegetables, which I got. First off, it took a while to get to me. At normal places, by the time you've paid, your box is usually done and filled to the brim with chicken. Here? Nope. I stood and waited about five minutes for it, which doesn't seem like a long time, but is, at the same time, unexpected for the little stand such as this.\\n\\nA small pile of chicken was ultimately thrown on and I doused my whole dish with some hot sauce before closing the lid and bagging it myself. I left with my coworkers and we made our way back to work. As soon as I got back to work and was able to calmly open up my box of food, I did so, fork in hand. I'm a big fan of mixing, so I carefully did a good mix of everything. All of the vegetables, noodles, and chicken were now tangled with one another and hot sauce enveloped the whole mess. I took a bite. BLECH! The chicken was super salty, the noodles and vegetables had no flavor whatsoever, and there was almost no heat to the hot sauce. I disappointingly closed the box and left it there to be forgotten and focused on work instead.\\n\\nAbout a few hours later, I got hungry again and the remembered the box sitting next to me. Granted, I didn't REALLY feel like eating it, but I remembered the $8 I spent and I didn't want to throw away all that food after spending the money for it, so I decided I'd try to put down as much as I could. I re-mixed everything again and took a bite and surprisingly enough, it tastes much better cold!\\n\\nNow, I'm not someone who normally likes to eat cold food. Pizza, Chinese food, chicken wings, almost all things that are made hot should be eaten hot, I think. It was a shock to me that I enjoyed the food better without the warmth on it and I ate a lot more than I thought I would. That's what made me decide to give this place a second star.\\n\\nIf I was all out of options and HAD to come here, I would probably do it again, but I see very little reason why any of that would ever happen. Though I was able to eat some of the food and issued this place a second star, I probably won't ever return again."},{"name":"Sweetish Hill Bakery","address":"1120 W 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"the sit down bakery is closed but you can still enjoy their goods if you show up Saturday mornings between 8am and 12pm.

Now, I don't know if you know this but Vino Tecca is where Barcelona wine bar gets all of their wine. Barcelona owns Vino Teca. I think it's important tontion because a lot of the wine is the same as what you'll find on Barcelonas wine list. Last time I went to Barcelona at Inman, I went across the street to Vinoteca and bought an entire case of wine and just walked in to Barcelona with it for our dinner party. \\n*1st bottle is free to open but after that there is a $15 uncorking fee*\\n*Monday nights they do half off bottles of wine*\\n\\n\\nThen there's the food.

Enough with the intro.\\n\\nThe first appetizer was shrimp, grapefruit, and herbs on an edible betel leaf.  The flavor was bright and refreshing.  My absolute and only favorite.  The next courses, the second and third were bland and oddly chewy as if a marshmallow had been hidden inside.  The ink soup was decent, the smoked mussels salad was interesting.\\n\\nThe Lon plaa khem was bright and enjoyable as you wrapped your own portions in a small lettuce leaf - good!  Quite frankly the curry with goat was  bland and unappetizing- the tumeric rice was awful.  I kept hoping the wait staff would clear the table quickly.  A majority of the menu was too salty and way way to fish sauce oriented.\\n\\nPerhaps we have missed some of the more interesting and bright monthly menu presentations.

The service was outstanding and the food was pretty good.  My reason for the 2-star rating is based mainly on the entree that I ordered.  \\n\\nI ate lunch here with my colleagues.  Most of the group went with the fixed lunch menu (app, entree, dessert for $20-great deal), but I decided to go with a lunch entree instead: The Lobster Ravioli.  In most restaurants where I've ordered this dish, it is a large portion, and their are actual chunks of lobster in the ravioli.  At Strega, they serve you 4 pieces of ravioli.  That's right, FOUR, for $16.  The \\"lobster\\" filling is really minced up lobster, not actual nice chunks of lobster like other restaurants.  I observed other entrees at my table that were much larger and cheaper than this dish.  For example, the panini sandwiches were huge, and the veal Parmesan was also a big portion.  I have had better lobster ravioli at much cheaper restaurants.  Thankfully, my colleagues shared some of their meals with me because every other meal at this restaurant appears to be a normal, adult sized portion.  \\n\\nAnd the the desserts came out...  The options for the desserts were tiramisu or a chocolate chip cannoli.  I am not joking when I say that the tiramisu portion was larger than my lunch portion.\\n\\nBased on today's experience, I don't see how the Italian food at this restaurant is worth the prices that they charge.  Obviously, you are paying for the waterfront location, because I've had comparable (and better) Italian food at many other restaurants that charge a lot less.  So, if you go here for lunch, I recommend the fixed lunch menu option.  It is the best value, at $20, when other portions cost just about the same.  The service was excellent, as was the atmosphere, but the food just did not impress me like I was hoping that it would."},{"name":"Tiki Rock","address":"2 Broad St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Ok........so I'm a huge fan of Crudo, so when I heard the owners opened up Tiki Rock, I wanted to check it out. \\n\\nI went here last night for my sister's birthday dinner, and didn't stay long at all.

At first, I was off-put by the fish sauce, as I hadn't expected the fishiness (My wife ordered it, and I was clueless about what it was. It certainly surprised me!). Then I saw the pickled vegetables supplied with the meal, and I vaguely remembered the waiter pointing them out to us. Eaten TOGETHER with the wings really changed the whole taste. The sweetened vinegary picked vegetables added the missing link that really ti d everything together! Wow! What a brilliant experience this had now became! Excellent!\\n\\nThe Khao Soi Nueua was familiar, but different. It is a traditional coconut curry noodle soup - but this one was different; less sweet than the traditional Chang Mai specialty, and really good! Beware that the root vegetables have a different rubbery texture which may catch people unawares.\\n\\nMy favorite dish of the meal is the Kaeng Hang Leh - a Northern Thai sweet pork belly and pork shoulder dish.

Highly, highly recommend this one. It was so unique and tasty. Not overly sweet at all. \\n\\nWe decided to split one entree because we wanted to save room for dessert. Keeping on with our chocolate theme, we choose the gnocchi in a mole sauce. This is definitely not for everyone.

The turkey was dry and a bit flavorful. The coleslaw wasn't what I was expecting, but some may like it. Overall, I wasn't impressed with the food.\\n\\nHowever, the BBQ sauce is the best I have ever tasted. A true smoke-head will tell you that good brisket doesn't need sauce.

This was our third time there together and we were hoping for better service as the last times we waited (seated at a table) for around 30 minutes just to get a drink and it wasn't busy. It was around 2 pm it was not busy, the hostess were all joking around before they had noticed us standing there waiting to be seated. Finally we get seated and we glanced at the menu, as we knew what we wanted already...10 min pass and no drink yet. We noticed a group of individuals get seated and immediately a server went up to this group of 6 to get their drinks... and yet another group got seated near us... and got served drinks....25 mins pass and I started to feel embarrassed because me and my boyfriend were the only Hispanics in the room without drinks... or even served...I got up and went to talk to a woman who is always there I believe she's a server and I told her we hadn't been served and if we don't get served we are leaving... obviously I was upset because not only did those other parties get drinks but they got food too! Finally a waiter comes and takes care of us, I wish I could remember his name but he was a tall blonde gentleman and he got us our drinks and food so quickly and even gave us peach cobbler a la mode on the house and didn't charge us for our drinks.

My expectations were high because of course I read the wonderful reviews and wanted to try a different breakfast spot in the city...I was terribly disappointed.  \\n\\nLet's start off with the limited parking.  Its location is on a busy street with a lot of hustle and bustle so if you want to enjoy this spot you need to be staying in a nearby hotel or live in the vicinity so you can walk.  Otherwise, I suggest taking an Uber or Lyft.  \\n\\nAs for the food, well, let's just say I'm a much better cook.  I ordered the Salmon Cakes and grits.  The salmon cakes tasted like they were cooked with Shake and Bake.  They were really crispy on the outside and dry on the inside.  The only saving grace for this dish was the aioli sauce because that added some flavor.  The grits were gritty but some people like their grits that way.  I, however, like my grits creamy so a little cream cheese, heavy whipping cream, or even sour cream would make them creamier.  My cousin ordered the Chicken and Waffles and the waffles had a very chewy, tough texture to them like they had been sitting under a lamp for some time and the chicken was a basic tender with no flavor/seasoning.  A waffle shouldn't need an over saturated amount of syrup in order to add flavor or to be able to cut through it.IJS \\n\\nThere are some great restaurants that offer more flavorful breakfast/brunch options in Atlanta like Cafe 458, the original Highland Bakery, 5 Church, Thumbs Up, Buttermilk, Sun in My Belly, Joy Cafe, and old faithful the Flying Biscuit, just to name a few.

So many hotels, such a wide experience in service, cleanliness and maintenance.  For a little hotel that is part of a local and fairly well respected chain, the Crystal stood out above all the others.  This hotel, as we've experienced in the past, is clean.  Clean.  Well maintained.  Very well thought out, throughout.  It's a newish tourist hotel in an old SRO hotel building that has been meticulously restored outside and imaginatively remodeled inside.  \\n\\nWhen I was on the toilet at the Pacific Executive in Seattle (between stays here) all the flaws of the idea behind that corporate effort at a boutique hotel practically jumped out at me:  White paint on fake wood and tile;  dirt in the lower corners, flat bright gallery white paint going black wherever humans made contact.  Shower doors that didn't work properly;  a bizarre entry made almost impossible for wheelchairs.\\n\\nNot here.\\n\\nTrue, bathrooms are not ensuite, but as almost all of our stays have been on the third floor---at both ends and in the middle---we found showers/toilets either next to or across the hall from our room; several per floor, so you don't have to go traipsing about looking for one.\\n\\nThere is no tv. There is a clock radio with charging ports.  No mini-fridge (you're surrounded by bars and restaurants).  There is no coffee machine.  There is a quart sized canning jar with a gift certificate to have it filled with company beer down in the bar---free.  Two of the three rooms we've had on this floor had a table and chairs, one had only a chair.  Lots of pillows. Thick terry robes for each occupant.  Like the towels, the robes could use fabric softener or better industrial detergent to make them less scratchy.\\n\\nLocation: On 12th at Burnside.  It should be noisier, but when we got home I realized that both the trash guys and the sirens here in San Francisco's Tenderloin are far FAR louder than in Portland.  I would not consider this hotel noisy, but it's not suburban quiet, either.  Right across from Whole Foods---and the Pearl District.  A half block from Powells books.  Jakes Crawfish, across Stark St, makes an Irish coffee to rival the Buena Vista (although the cream is too cold).  If you're going to a concert at the Crystal ballroom, it's a block away.  The Peculularium is a twenty minute walk (and thus, so is NW Portland).  Downtown Portland is a ten minute walk (Pioneer Sq) and there you have MAX into and out of the airport, to Milwaukee, Beaverton and Hillsboro.  There are also Portland Streetcars even closer.  Union Station/Amtrak and the bus station there is about a 20 minute walk, as is the Chinese Garden (not to be confused with the Japanese version in Washington Park).  There are homeless people, particularly on the eastern edge of the Pearl, in the park, but not as out there as in Seattle (or San Francisco).\\n\\nWe also took a Lyft to St. Johns, across the iconic, eponymous bridge, which seems like a small town a world away.\\n\\nSo I heartily recommend the Crystal Hotel."},{"name":"Pambiche","address":"2811 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This place changed my life.

About an hour before the due time I received a text reminding me about the reservation and asking for a call if there was a cancellation.  Yet when we arrived at the restaurant the hostess said we did not have a reservation. We were seated in an area where additional tables were added as friends joined our party. \\n\\nWe ended up sharing menus as additional ones were not brought for those joining the group and we helped ourselves to a nearby pile of rolled silverware.  The hostess didn't seem to be doing anything so this is inexcusable.  Our server was obviously inexperienced. I noticed he did not have a procedure for taking orders in sequence so he would know which diner ordered what.  Right from the beginning he could not keep beverage orders straight and the confusion continued to not knowing who ordered what food and who should receive which check.\\n\\nI felt sorry for our server as he did his best to take care of our party and kept a good attitude in spite of being under extreme stress.   Although it was slow in the restaurant no one came to help him with anything, no manager, no hostess, no server.  All of our food came out very slowly and at different times with some people waiting to be served while others finished their meal.  The friend sitting next to me received her beans and rice but never did receive her tacos.  After she inquired about them she received the tacos about 20 minutes later so she took them home.  Several people received chicken or cheese when they ordered beef and one friend received a burrito with some kind of spinach filling which she had not ordered and neither had anyone else at the table.  I really wanted a refill on my empty glass of iced tea but didn't ask because I didn't want to slow down the waiter from serving food to those who were still waiting.  Since it was \\"Taco Tuesday\\" and a number of people ordered the tacos you would think the food could have come out of the kitchen faster.\\n\\nThe food was not bad.  I ordered the chimichanga and the menu clearly described it as fried, which is the traditional preparation, but it was not fried.  So basically it was a burrito.  \\n\\nWhen the checks came they were so screwed up that it wasn't just a question of trading checks.  We had checks for food that no one at the table ordered.  When I left three friends were trying to sort that out with the hostess and server.  Although I think the service could have been a bit better if we had not been a large party, I can tell you none of us will be going to Chaparral again.  The only reason I'm giving them two stars for this review is because the server really did his best in spite of his obvious lack of experience and he maintained a good attitude under pressure."},{"name":"Nantucket Shrimp Shack","address":"7675 West Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4.5","text":"We are from Kentucky, this place was great!

It was 11 at night, I was doing architecture projects (i rarely sleep at all when i'm doing arch projects) and haven't eaten since the day before so i gave it a shot. I called Nan Ling's hotline and being an international student i don't have any idea about chinese restaurants customer service policy of screaming to potential patrons. \\n\\nYup! As what u guys probably known already, the woman who answered my call was f*cked up, she speaks alien and i asked her to repeat several times, she was pissed, so she begin to scream like i'm listening to some shezuan death metal. Because of hunger, despite the animalistic behavior i kept on ordering some 'thing' called Four Happiness... The shrimp and scallop was very fresh 3 years ago, the sauce has the exquisite singular taste of MSG, the beef was genuine rubber. \\n\\nI should've bought some canned food next time.

She continue to ask questions on why I was disabled or in need of this dog, and I was very quick to remind her that that type of questioning is illegal. Still not happy, she then asked very aggressively if I was going to sue her. Her coworker who was helping her had even told her to drop the issue and stop, which seem to only make her more upset. She continued to be confrontational in front of her coworkers and other customers and asked for MY name, in which I was forced to just ignore her until my payment was processed. No other staff member asked her to stop or did anything to mediate the situation, but I did talk to the manager and she was polite about everything. I am very concerned that this place clearly does not train their employees on protocol for service animals/disabilities, not to mention they seem to be a little too angry to be at work.

We were on a hunt for spicy food and this came up in the Yelp results.\\n\\nOverall, the quality of their food seems to be good. However, I was a bit disappointed in the lack of flavour. We ordered the Kung Pao Chicken ($14 or $15), Chicken fried rice ($9.50) and Lamb with Cumin ($16). The Kung Pao Chicken was very odd - it tasted more like sweet and sour Chicken or Ketchup chicken, but the chicken bits used in there were very tender and juicy. It was not spicy at all.\\n\\nThe Lamb with Cumin is a dish with deep fried bits of Lamb on top of a bed of Cilantro. While we enjoyed this dish, we didn't see anything particularly special or outstanding about it. It's also priced a a bit high at $16 (in my opinion). This had a kick to it, but I wouldn't call it spicy. \\n\\nThe fried rice here is a fail. It looked exactly like a \\"house fried rice\\" you'd see at any chinese cafe. The peas and carrots were ones you'd find in a frozen bag and the chicken was hardly there. The rice itself was not very \\"fried rice\\"-like; it was more like a jumble of white rice and some frozen veggies. It needed that \\"wok breath\\" or something crispy to liven it up.\\n\\nOverall, we spent $42 after tax (and before tip) with some leftovers.  Given that I thought we had ordered 2 of their best dishes (the KP Chicken and Cumin Lamb), I'm a bit disappointed. I was expecting flavour explosions and did not get it. Price-wise, it's also more expensive than ordering the same dishes at a similar restaurant in the area. \\n\\nTheir decor is also a bit to stiff for my taste - they have these chinese decor tables with a tall underlay and if you're a tall person like my husband, your thighs will crunch up against it so you HAVE to stretch out your legs while sitting. Just overall uncomfortable decor.\\n\\nThe service was ok. Nothing bad or good about it. I was a bit bothered that the staff did not do anything about this mother and her kid who were touching the clean dishes and teapot for about a half hour straight. I'm sorry, your kid may be cute, but he just put his hand in his mouth and then grabbed the teapot spout. \\n\\nYeah, I guess I won't be returning any time soon.

They do not have plates, only paper towels and plastic forks and knives if you find you need any. They have cups of water that you can get from the sink, it's BYOB, and they have a little bar of toppings like garlic, olive oil, peppers, and a spicy sauce. The kinky reason I am rating 4 stars instead of 5 is that the cashiers are kind of mean. The menu is in Italian so I ask a good handful of questions about the food~ they just seems uninterested and tired of answering people's questions.

The patio and bar is open seating though and we were lucky enough to grab a table in the patio area after about 35 minutes or so. They have a great menu and their house bread is absolutely delicious. I mean I don't even like soda bread but their guinness and sugar dipping sauce took the bread to the next level. \\n\\nWe ordered the Kiss Before Shrimp (Pan seared local Florida coast shrimp in a garlic and chili lemon butter sauce with sliced baguette) for appetizers, and their Shepherd's Pie, Fish and Chips, and a side order of Onion Rings for our entrees. We absolutely loved our shrimp appetizer. It was genuinely spicy and actually came with a pretty generous amount of shrimp. We ran out of baguette though and ended up sopping up the rest of the sauce with the soda bread. The Fish and Chips while tasty and cooked perfectly was small in portion size. We were only given one piece of fish! For the price we were expecting at least two pieces. Still, it was tasty. The Shepherd's Pie on the other hand fell a little short for us. While it had good flavor, it came across as dry even with the sauce on the bottom. It needed more moisture in the meat for sure. I probably wouldn't order this again. I would definitely order their onion rings again though! Huge and so good with their dipping sauce! Easily one of the best onion rings I've tasted to date. \\n\\nOverall, this was a great way to kick off our honeymoon and we enjoyed our meal here. It was a lot of fun just sitting on the patio and soaking up the live music and the vibe of this pub. It is slightly expensive but the quality of the food makes up for it.

It was more like sour cream and was even speckled with something that looked like parsley.  Their sweets were way too sweet and I did not take more than one small bite out of the petit fours because of this.

He also had a passion fruit smoothie (Also know as \\"maracuy√°\\", $4.25), which he enjoyed. \\n\\nI had the pork chops with rice and beans and fried plantains ($13.00). Our food was deliciously exquisite!  The plantains were crispy, a tad sweet and perfectly cut and fried. The pork chops were perfectly seasoned and the rice and beans complimented, perfectly, the pork chops.  We were both full and decided to take leftovers, since we wanted to try their guava cheesecake ($5.50). Server suggested we would have some of their Lavazza coffee and, us being coffee snobs, were convinced.  Guava cheesecake was sweet, but not too sweet and it paired well with out coffees. I had a cappuccino ($4.50) and Juan had an espresso ($3.50). All, in all, food was delicious, ambiance was welcoming and service was perfect.  Prices are a bit up there (specially the drinks and desserts), but worth the splurge for special occasions.

The Breakfast Tacos were really good and unique since the tortillas are French toast battered but extremely messy. The Crispy Chicken biscuits has forever ruined Chick-fil-A biscuit.

The decor is really nice with big leather booths and lots of dark wood. Started at the bar while I waited for the remainder of my group. The bar stools weren't able to be pulled very close to the bar... for someone my height this is important...due to a large bar for taller patrons to put their feet on. The summer breeze was ok. Old fashioned with mid-shelf whiskey was more expensive than I've paid at other places in the area for the exact same thing. \\nWhen my group arrived we were sat right away and we started with a round of drinks and some dumplings. Flavor was good but too spicy for me. The rest of the table loved them. Once we were ready to order dinner, our waitress was busy chatting with a friend of hers for over 10 minutes. We were finally able to flag her down to order but it did take a while. Our food came out and it was about a 50/50 on the food. I was very happy with the wagyu hot dogs. Those who weren't happy with theirs ordered some variation of steak. My friend ordered the steak and cheese off the specials menu....he was extremely unhappy about what he was delivered. The bread was soggy by the time it came out, the steak was unseasoned and was very overcooked. We urged him to send the food back but he didn't. Another friend ordered the steak tips with awesome sauce. The steak was supposed to be medium rare but came out closer to medium well. The awesome sauce tasted like a weird combination of steak sauce and cocktail sauce mused together. \\nOverall we weren't very impressed with the food or the service as a whole.

The diluted, ginger flavored water masquerading as tea did little to wash down the deep fryer grease, but I did enjoy the instant noodles, and contemplated asking the owner from which grocery store I could buy them.\\n\\nThe momo platter arrived shortly after, complete with forks that were sticky to the touch. Fully aware that I'd no concept of what they SHOULD taste like, I still settled on the impression that they were bretheren of the previously noted frozen food products, and noted that any flavor whatsoever was masked by very strong sauces.\\n\\nHaving no experience with cuisine from this part of the world, the only glimmer of taste authenticity I gathered was from the other patrons, who all appeared to be of Indian/Nepali descent, that slowly filtered into the restaurant as the evening progressed and seemingly ordered ONLY momos. Perhaps that really was how momos taste?\\n\\nMay I suggest that should you choose to start your Nepali food adventure here, go only for what appeared, to me at least, the star of the show - the momos - and give everything else a pass.

It's right next to a winery, so they are beautiful cottage buildings and greens everywhere. They have live music, popcorn and lemonade to snack on while you're waiting (although you have to pay for it), and lots of picnic tables to relax at in the shade. We came on a Saturday afternoon, so the wait was quite long (it ended up being about an hour and 20 minutes). \\n\\nOnce we were finally seated, it took a while for the waiter to take our orders. We each ended up getting the Family style which is basically AYCE bbq for $25. As for the bbq, it was honestly just average. Lots of the ribs and brisket given to us were the burnt ends, so it was really chewy. My favorite was actually the sausage instead of the brisket. In my opinion, both the ribs and brisket was dried compared to the other places. One thing I did enjoy about the family style were the sides! Both the potato salad and cole slaw exceeded my expectations. We ordered a peach cobbler with ice cream to share for dessert. The peach was fantastic and a great way to finish off such a heavy meal. However, I only wished there was more crust. \\n\\nOverall, fantastic place to take friends here from out of town. Salt Lick gives a fantastic southern experience along with great service.

Our waitress was great. Super nice and accommodating. I ordered steak and lobster tail and a martini. I don't drink martinis often, they are a huge treat for me so when I do I call my gin. They did not give me the Gin I asked for and it was the worst Martini I've ever had. When I got my plate my steak was ice cold and I couldn't even cut it. I told the waitress and she did bring me another lobster tail. So fine, but by then I had lost all of the enthusiasm I had for dinner. She had asked me if I wanted another steak and since my husband's steak was also very tough I said no thank you. He also had ordered the snow crab and was given Dungeness instead.

I was that lonely man unaccompanied in a French restaurant, a prime source of comedy open for improvisation by the likes of Robin Williams and John Ritter.  I imagined the waiting staff were sympathetic, wondering who stood me up.  They knew that the reservation was for two and can only wonder what kind of an ass would not show for a dinner at Chambar, one of the best reviewed restaurants in Vancouver.  In truth, I had no companion; I only asked for two in case I did.  I admit most of my friends down here wouldn't appreciate first-rate French cuisine, asking for ketchup to top their sherry-braised rabbit cannelloni.  \\n\\nI also never felt more like a pariah for not ordering wine.  If my sister or mother were here, they'd polish off a quart of Canalicchio di Sopra '06 which would double the bill but cut their chances for cardiovascular disease by half.  It's called the French Paradox--why that fluky country manages to down wine by the barrel, eat meat like they're extras in an Italian splatterpunk film, and still live longer on average than anyone in North America.  I'm sure it has something to do with stress.  I'm sure.  I'm practically a teetotaler (one who abstains from all alcohol), like I'm choking on a Eucharist at a Christian Scientist convention--you could measure the irony with a dipstick.  I closed up the four-page wine menu and opted away from my predilection for water in favor of a cola.  Non-diet.  No ice.  Wild man.  The coke includes free re-fills, which you may think is typical but isn't.  \\n\\nImmediately upon browsing the dinner menu, I locked on a specific appetizer like a grey owl on an unsuspecting squirrel, the foie de canard--spiced foie gras terrine, port reduction, Kriek granita & truffled brioche French toast.  To those loyal readers out there (Mom), you'll remember that last time I enjoyed foie gras with brioche was in Gordon Ramsay's Savoy Grill.  I'll give credit for Chambar's presentation--they easily topped Savoy in the panache of their plate, though Savoy's brioche was offered in a miniature bread pan which could best Elmo in face-contorting adorability.  Savoy does edge out in flavor--their foie gras was creamier--but Chambar sent it home with the inclusion of the Kriek granita pallet cleanser.  Kriek is a brand of Belgium beer made from fermented cherries.  When I mentioned my foie gras history with the waiter, he commented on the coincidence given their head chef had worked at the Savoy Grill before coming to Canada.  This was repeated with the maitre d, leading me to suspect that the kitchen was following my progress.  When weighing such tempting starters as lime & chili rubbed beef striploin and grilled asparagus with white spring salmon & saffron mayonnaise, who would order the goose liver p√¢t√©?  This patron must have taste?  \\n\\nOr I'm simply arrogant.  Probably the latter.\\n\\nI followed this astounding starter with the canard et ch√®vre--spiced rubbed duck breast, Okanagan herb goat cheese, roasted hazelnuts, ricotta gnocchi, and sauce bigarade.  Barring the bite off my mom's plate at the Savoy Grill, I've only enjoyed duck three times, all in the last two months and all in high-end bistros.  I'm starting to think that duck could be my baseline in fine cuisine.  I'll certainly never try it at home, as it would surely never measure up.  This plate goes down as the best of the bunch, which reveals an ocean's-worth given I've never had bad duck.

I have a wheat allergy so instead of sending back this salad I picked half of the lettuce out because crumbs were everywhere. The waitress did not bring our food another server did nor did she come around to ask if my food was correct or if I needed more to drink. The floors were disgusting having old food and trash under the tables. The last straw was the server finally returned with my check and took the gift-card I was using to pay.

The free valet at this restaurant was expedient and friendly, which made parking hassle free on a busy Saturday night. Barcelona just might represent the most popular restaurant on this already bustling stretch of North Highland, as groups large and small tightly packed the large dining room and patrons waiting spilled out onto the streets en masse. We fortunately made a reservation and our host seated us promptly; I highly recommend you do the same for weekend dining. \\n\\nBarcelona loses some marks for a rough start at the beginning of our meal. Nobody greeted us or filled our water glasses for the first 20 minutes of service. Eventually, someone other than our waiter filled our water and took our drink orders. We opted for reds from the restaurant's deep by the glass list and our wines (a buttery smooth tempranillo from Madrid and a dry, crisp syrah from Chile) fortunately arrived in a timely manner.  Now approaching 30 minutes into service, we still had not met our actual waiter! Eventually, our waiter showed up well after we placed our food order with other staff. She immediately proceeded to spill olive oil on the table and into my fiance's water glass. \\n\\nNo apologies were made for that gaffe, which was mildly infuriating, but fortunately service ran much more smoothly after that large initial hiccup and the food tasted quite good. Fresh bread from the oven was brought to the table and the crackly crust and fluffy crumb made for pleasant grazing throughout our meal. We opted for two tapas, the redfish and duck hearts, and a single portion of the shellfish paella. Note that the paella here takes at least 45 minutes to prepare, so don't order this dish unless your dining companions are stimulating. \\n\\nThe kitchen sent out our tapas relatively quickly and both tasted unique and delicious. The tender redfish with a bright herbaceous salsa verde made for a fresh but rich bite. I immensely enjoyed the meaty duck hearts smartly paired with a zesty chimmichuri and cooling Greek yogurt. Despite being an organ meat, the hearts did not taste too bloody or irony (think very, very mild liver). Our single portion of paella definitely brought enough food for two to share. Unlike many other paellas in the city, this one boasted a crackly rim of caramelized rice which added tons of flavor. The rice itself was saucy and intensely seasoned. This paella outclassed all the other ones we have had in the city and, at $25, was a relative steal. For two glasses of wine, paella, and two tapas, our bill was $70 which, given the quality and quantity of food, was quite fair. \\n\\nAdmittedly, I felt a little pessimistic at the beginning of our meal given my fiance's initial lackluster meal here and some annoying service issues, but the fare at this busy Inman Park restaurant was craveable and very reasonably priced. I would try to avoid this place on the weekends if possible, but otherwise Barcelona is definitely worth a visit for its unique menu of Spanish-inspired treats and arguably the city's best paella."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The best pizza around.

If you are a pizza snob, then look no further, Antico is crazy good. The restaurant itself is crazy.... well just plain crazy. As one of our family members described Antico, this is not just dinner, this is an experience. I honestly do not think they meant it to be a real compliment but if you know what you are in for and you are prepared Antico can be a real good time. If you are not into crazy, then just order your pizza to go. You walk in and place your order from a line, then you find a spot at a community table and wait for your number to be called for them to bring your pizza to you. The place is loud, real loud and super busy on a Saturday evening, but well worth the chaos. I wish I would have known you could bring your own bottles of wine or beers because so many people had bottles and were sharing in the little plastic cups stacked up at every table. The only drinks you could order included bottled coke products, a pretty good selection of wines, and Peroni was the only beer. So we went with a coke zero and 5 Peronis for our group. We sat in the back room so we could watch the pizzas being made and we were entertained and impressed. They have it down to a science. The dough is spun and pressed out by experts, then stacked with cheese, a little sauce swirl, then the toppings before being slid onto a waiting pizza paddle then into the wood fired ovens and viola, a few quick minutes later you have your pizza. We ordered the margarita plus artichokes, and the San Gerraro. Both were amazing and as we watched them make the pizzas we decided a calzone and Diavola was definitely on the order list for next time. We almost ordered more because our family could not believe how good it was although the two pizzas completely stuffed the five of us. Our dad, who prefers fine dining or at least a place that provides plates and silverware, was a little horrified that the pizza is brought out on sheet pans, placed on your community table, then you tear off paper towels to use as a plate or just eat right from the sheet tray with your hands. However, one bite of this amazing pizza and the \\"ambiance\\", or lack thereof,was all forgiven.

I was excited to visit Escobar with my girls because I had never been. Went there last night and would like to give my honest opinion and be straight forward as possible. 1. The staff was really nice. No complaints there. 2. The menus were super worn and raggedy. It's time to toss them and print out a new set . I was surprised of it's appearance because 2 chains and Snoop own the restaurant and there is a level of expectation there. 3. Had a margarita, and that was pretty good. My girls didn't complain about their drinks so kudos to the bartender that made our drinks. 4. Im a hookah lover. And let me tell you...that $32 was not worth it- At all!!!! I wouldnt pay 10 bucks for that hookah. I didnt receive not a slither of a buzz. I thought if i kept smoking it would soon hit. Never happened. I was just swallowing unnecessary  smoke. I hate it when I get a sorry hookah...and the plastic hose was chipped..5. It took nearly an hour for us to receive our food although there wasnt a crowd..and let me tell you all...the ig photos were deceiving. This was the major part i was looking foward to. My calamari was 1 minute shy of being burnt. I wished I took a picture. It didnt taste all that great either. Had waaay better. The only reason I didnt return it was because it took so long for us to get it. My girl purchased hot wings and those were super mediocre. It was bland with a cayenne spice /flavor to it if that makes sense. We figured that at least the wings were going to be good  hence the fact that we're in Atlanta and there is a wing joint on practically every other street corner where there is a gas station..but nope. They just barely did the job..like i mentioned before, staff was decent, the waitress was nice, but I will not be back."},{"name":"Escobar Restaurant and Tapas","address":"327 Peters St SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"I was NOT pleased with my visit to Escobar. I went on Sunday night around 9. The tables and menus were dirty. The tables are glass and whatever product they use leaves hella water stains on the table. The seating along side the wall is too high compared to how low the tables are and chairs on the opposite side of the table were mismatched. For that reason I didn't want to order food. You would have to hover over the table to eat. No thanks. I also opted out on ordering drinks because the cocktails didn't sound appealing to me. The bar for me was the main attraction. I loved the lights and the color paint surrounding. The waitress took a long time to visit us and when my friends ordered drinks and food that wait was long as well. One of my friends ordered a fishbowl, which they ran out of bowls so they gave him two slender glasses filled with ice and claimed that the two drinks added up to the amount he would've gotten in a fishbowl. That was complete bullshit. The ambiance was really off, I hated the seating, the music was good but too loud. Literally all of us were bored including the birthday girl.

These are good but spicy.  \\n\\nCrispy Cabbage: This cabbage was so sweet! Almost caramelized. The best parts (of course) are the little char bits. \\n\\nHanger steak: Five very delicious, yet short lived pieces of medium rare hanger steak. I find that hanger steak can be kind of tough, but this was not at all difficult to eat. The truffle aioli is a little garlicky but adds to the flavors of the steak very well. Aside from the aioli, I think the steak speaks for itself. \\n\\nBroccoli Casserole: I LOVE BROCCOLI and usually HATE casseroles. But this was delicious!! I'm not sure what type of cheese they used, but it was so creamy. The broccoli was also very crunchy/fresh, not cooked to death like most casseroles are. \\n\\nAlbondigas: Meatballs. \\n\\nPatatas Bravas: Another potato dish. I do wish the skins were a little more crunchy, and the overall dish was a little less oily. But anything with potato is automatically a-OK in my book. \\n\\nHam & Cheese croquettes: I LOVE croquettes. For those who don't know, croquettes are basically a mixture of mashed potatoes and whatever else you want fried. Fried potato balls. They are everything I want in a fried fish: crispy on the outside and soft, pillowy insides.\\n\\nFinally .. the complimentary dessert board. They must only do this for special occasions, but it is a massive cutting board with the chocolate hazelnut cake (best cake... Ever), flan, bread pudding, and crepe. We also ordered the panna cotta. \\n\\nThis is the best panna cotta I've ever eaten. It is a little more runny\\" and less \\"pudding-like\\" then your usual panna cotta but it is so creamy. They top it off with black cherries that really highlight the tartness of the dish. The hazelnut cake was probably the table winner. It was kind of like a molten lava cake, but with more of a thicker, fudgey middle than hot fudge. \\n\\n I would say the prices are fair. With everything we ordered, our bill was less than $200. That's less than $25/person before tax (for our 7). Granted, we got the dessert platter for free, but even a couple desserts around the table won't put you past $40/person. Overall, I was extremely pleased with our attentive servers and delicious food. \\n\\nTLDR; On a budget? Get the hanger steak and panna cotta for dessert"},{"name":"Village Wines & Bistro","address":"10 S High St","city":"Canal Winchester","stars":"3.5","text":"I had the beer battered cod sandwich with fries.

The potato salad and coleslaw are different from any I've ever had, and both delicious. But the real star is the meat, which is so juicy, smoky, and tender. The brisket and pulled pork were both by far the best I've ever had. I really liked the spicy original sauce with both cuts of meat. One of our table also got the baby back ribs (available on Sundays), which were absolutely incredible- can't recommend these enough for anyone going on a Sunday- and we tried the sausage too, which was just as good.

It is about the yummiest pizza I've ever had, the taste is particular to Antico, and though there are a lot of imitators, none quite approximates Antico's pizza. I have been to Naples three times and eaten pizza throughout Italy and the U.S. I do dig the NY slice, Chicago deep dish and such, but nothing quite measures up to Antico, certainly not the disappointing famous places in Naples. The concept of Neapolitan pizza is very few high-quality ingredients with not many toppings, cooked quickly to perfection. That's close to what Antico does, they do spit the pizzas out quickly and the dough is impeccable, but I have never tasted anything quite like it in Naples. The Margherita has a garlicky sauce, which adds a little kick to it, making it the best Margherita Pizza I have had anywhere, no contest. Every pizza I have had here has been doughy perfection; I would also particularly recommend the Pomodorini with fresh Cherry Vesuvian tomatoes, which explode with flavor, and the Verdura, which comes with broccoli rabe, a topping I haven't had elsewhere, and which works much better than the odd local greens they dump on your pizza in Naples. The not very comfortable, packed and noisy atmosphere and communal arrangement of tables at Antico hasn't changed much from when they opened several years ago. I'd rather not eat there. It's true that you lose a little something taking the pizza to go and eating it later when it's cooled down. But Antico pizza even tastes fantastic the next morning cold. I did boycott the place for a few years when the owner was convicted of screwing over his employees. But he paid a huge fine, over $300,000, and I'll assume that the workers there are now fairly compensated."},{"name":"Flour Bakery + Caf√©","address":"12 Farnsworth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I read about this bakery prior to my visit to Boston.

The original restaurant is out on the east side, with its sister restaurant Whiskey Soda Lounge down the street from it. There's also a sort of fast food-style Pok Pok out that way as well. The wait at the original is by far the worst, it's been a little while since I've paid a visit, but when we used to go it'd be an hour-plus wait for a table. Whiskey Soda Lounge is another great option, but it's much more dressed down than Pok Pok (the environment is like a fairly-classy bar), and the same can be said to an even great degree about the fast food Pok Pok. For that reason, I tend to recommend Pok Pok NW for those who want the nice, sit down restaurant experience without the wait of the original restaurant.\\n\\nAside from the wings, they offer a number of great vegetable dishes.

Anyone can cook an egg. Anyone can make an omelet. Well, ok, maybe not anyone. But as far as simple and cheap food basics go, these are usually pretty high on the list. So I don't judge breakfast places on their eggs. Perhaps unfairly, I don't even judge them on their pancakes or breakfast meats. \\n\\nFor me, what makes a breakfast place stand out is their potatoes. Home fries and hash browns are harder to master, both in terms of seasoning and cooking time. OB's only offers home fries. Ideally, these should be browned and crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside, and well-seasoned without being overseasoned. OB's uses red-skinned potatoes, which were maybe considered \\"gourmet\\" or \\"fancy\\" back in 1993, but in terms of putting in effort, that's where they stopped. Their potatoes are cut into large, bland, soft, mushy chunks. Not much brown crispiness to speak of. They're not undercooked, which is about the best I can say for them. \\n\\nAlso, given the cheapness and ease of making breakfast food, this place is overpriced, in my opinion. The servers are friendly and fast, but what does it matter when the food is so mediocre? Also, they're cash only, which is inconvenient.\\n\\nI'll never understand why this place is so popular, but I have friends who come here pretty much every weekend, so I'll be back, growing saltier with each visit. I wish I could give some of that salt to the chefs. Maybe it would improve the potatoes."},{"name":"Trident Booksellers & Caf√©","address":"338 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I don't live in Boston anymore, and when I did, Trident didn't exist.

My last two visits I ordered the following:\\n\\n-Margherita ($20) \\n-San Gennaro ($22) \\n-Cannoli ($4) \\n\\nThe San Gennaro is hands down my favorite pizza from Antico. I love the mixture of onions, sausage and mozzarella. So gooood. I usually eat around two slices max at other pizza place but oh man..I definitely eat way more than 2 slices. Highly highly recommend. I also see on the board that the San Gennaro is an award wining pizza from Antico...and I can see why. \\n\\nThe Margherita is a classic pizza. You can add sausage, pepperoni, mushroom and other toppings for an additional charge if you like. I usually like to add the pepperoni. Great flavor. \\n\\nThe Cannoli, which is new I think since I haven't seen this before was really good as well. You get to choose from coconut, chocolate chips, and two other flavor I believe.

You can get away with sharing a sandwich along with your own side and drink if you don't have a huge appetite.\\n\\nI had the Cuban, and the spicy mustard and relish were an interesting twist. Instead of the normal yellow mustard, they opted for the spicy version. I honestly didn't like it as it was really potent. And for the relish, that was a twist from the usual pickles. This change wasn't as bad. Though the sandwich was not super pressed like the typical Cuban sandwich, it didn't take anything away. It's nearly impossible as this thing was stuffed with a lot of meat. Ooh. And the Cuban here comes with ciabatta bread so you can't (almost) choose your own bread.\\n\\nThe hub's hot & blue was also superb for it being a cold sandwich. The roast beef and bbq chicken was so good on the wheat bread he chose. The pepper jack and blue cheeses were divine. I particularly like how the lettuce was finely chopped. There's just something about the chopped lettuce and meats falling from your sandwich that makes it more delicious.\\n\\nThe ingredients here were fresh and made to your specific liking (they also have a build your own creation section). As stated on their Website, this deli does whip up a mean sandwich not typical of a boring thing when you think of deli: \\"Reuben's Deli is not just an ordinary sandwich shop; it's home to the extraordinary sandwich!

Now if we were at a retirement home where some residents can not have salt or spices I would understand. The Chicken Fried Steak had no flavor, neither did the breading. The gravy was if you boil water with flour and then you get a tasteless paste to bind books. I know this because my mom bound antique books and as I kid I knew what that tasted like. Hey, it was cooking on the stove, had to try it. The only difference was, this 'gravy' had pepper, the book paste did not. Not sure if something went terribly wrong in the kitchen or if this was their recipe. I do not think it was delivered by Sysco because they offer much better products. \\n\\nMy husband was asked about his breakfast so he shrugged his shoulders, said it was ok. After clearing the table, our server came back with our bill and said that the coffee was taken off the bill since my husband did not care for his breakfast.\\n\\nRather would pay full price for a good meal.\\n\\nI do not think we will be back."},{"name":"Barcelona Inman Park","address":"240 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I finally got to visit Barcelona and I was highly satisfied with their food and service, and my girlfriends and I left the place happy and full. Barcelona is more classy and chic than Eclipse di Luna, which is another tapas place of my choice. The street parking can get tight during dinner, so don't waste your time and energy and just head over to complimentary valet. We had three servers taking care of our table throughout the night, who were all so fabulous. They took their time to share useful tips to keep in mind and give expert recommendations every time I stopped them and asked. \\n\\nA chain of delicious tapas of the night started with Patatas Bravas, which my extreme hunger appreciated how quickly it came out. Despite how much we ordered, there wasn't any moment where we felt overwhelmed by the amount of food we had on our table. They did a good job of bringing out one tapas at a time, so we could all savor one dish completely before proceeding to the next. My favorite of all was Hanger Steak, which was excellently seared and juicy, and left all of us wanting more. Luckily for us, the server put in an extra order of Hanger Steak by accident, so we got to enjoy the second one on the house. As I was told to order paella dishes early on since it takes more time to prepare, I ordered Paella Matiscos and looked forward to it for the next 45 minutes. Sadly, I was a little disappointed with this one, it being way too salty for my taste (as well as for everyone else on our table). It was such a minor bummer though, considering how tasty the other dishes were. \\n\\nAs I said, the servers as well as the manager were super friendly, polite and professional. My girls and I could focus on our time together without any interruption to ask for more water or whatever it is that we needed. I also liked that they had one more extra bathroom just for ladies, which is definitely a smart action. \\n\\nI am happy that with Barcelona, my list of girls-night-out spots got longer, and can't wait to come back for more Malbec + tapas nights!"},{"name":"Rocco's Tacos & Tequila Bar","address":"7468 W Sand Lake Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"So this place is ok.  Some people really love it which is not why I come here but I know a couple people who do so I come to share time at their favorite place.  The margaritas are good, I'll give them that and the food is ok but nothing much else to say.

If I checked in every time I came to T1 Bento, I'd probably be the duke here.  There have been so many times when I've finished my shopping at H-Mart and realized, \\"this can wait, I'm going to T1 Bento instead.\\"    The menu includes bento trays, noodle dishes, and soups.  Most dishes are in the $7-10 range.\\n\\nHighlights:  I've tried several of T1 Bento's noodle dishes and about half of their Bento trays - my favorite dish out of all of them is the Basil Ho Fun (stir fried chicken with flat rice noodles).  If you're a fan of beef ho fun (which is also on the menu), you'll like the Basil Ho Fun.  The dish is a marriage of basil chicken and stir fried ho fun.  The basil gives a distinct flavor to the dish - it's delicious and what I order about half the time. All of the bento trays are served with a side of rice, a vegetable spring roll, Chinese vegetables, and a serving of pineapple.  There are fried items in the bento trays, but overall the dishes are not super oily.  This may make the trays a little blander than you are accustomed to, but I am personally a huge fan of them.   My favorite bento tray on the menu is the salt and pepper calamari tray.\\n\\nCritiques: You won't find any Chinese banquet dishes here, but you will be very satisfied if you're just looking for cheap, delicious, stir fry dishes.\\n\\nOverall: If I choose to eat at the Doraville H-Mart, I'm at T1 Bento.  The excellent basil ho fun and the relatively healthy bento trays are why I'm a regular customer here."},{"name":"Wingstop","address":"12014 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"This was my favorite wing place until now.

Forget calamari, this thing was tender like chicken. Usually the phrase \\"it tastes like chicken\\" is a bad thing, but in this case, it was good. Order it.\\n- Great for groups if you call in advance. They also don't bother you too much. In my case, this was for a birthday, and they were very accommodating by bringing out the cake we brought and stored in their fridge. They also brought out plates.\\n-Sea bass was soft and buttery. I can't remember how the waiter blindsided me into ordering fish, but I'm glad he did. I'm pretty hesitant to order any kind of fish because it tends to get overcooked or lacks flavor. \\n- Had a bite of osso bucco too and that was delicious. In fact, I'd pick the osso bucco over the sea bass. \\n\\nThe bad:\\n- Waiter was friendly and there was a slight communication problem with his English. He was also very persistent in helping us order that we didn't really know what we were ordering. As mentioned in one of my points above, I really wanted a pasta but he told me to get the fish and said there were would be pasta on the table. Um, yea, we never got any pasta unless we ordered it after our entrees were half finished. There's no telling how much that spaghetti with pomodoro sauce cost. \\n- The worst point was that we had already covered the bill and were still hanging out there. One of the waiters offered us some limoncello and then our waiter showed up with the bill for 9 limoncellos. Kinda shady... We ended up not paying for it as they said it was \\"on the house\\" but still, not very nice of them to offer AFTER the bill was closed. \\n\\nOverall, they serve food well and it's a bit on the expensive side for me.

I'm sorry I had to cheat on you all the other nights, but I felt like I had to at least consider some of the other places. You were well-worth the walk from South Station across the bridge on a cold day. When my friends and I arrived 15 minutes early for a 5:00 reservation and still feeling full from lunch, you had no problem letting us move our reservation to 6:00 so we could drink a brew at the City Tap House.  \\n\\nAt 6:00, you gave us the best waitress ever: Emma. (That is not hyperbole either.) So was so attentive, personable, and knowledgeable; she knew her wines, her oysters, her entire menu. If I owned a restaurant, I would have stolen her from you. If she had other tables to wait on (which she did!), she never let on to it--we felt you had dedicated her to our table alone.\\n\\nMy friends tried your raw oysters and clams and loved them all--except the cherrystone which isn't your fault. I went with Emma's recommendation: the Tuna Crudo. I didn't even know what it was, but she didn't go wrong on her wine recommendation, so I followed her lead. She hit the mark on this one too. Oh my gosh! It was amazing! \\n\\nBeing a Detroiter, I was a lobster roll virgin. You were my first, Row 34. It was chunky, and warm, and buttery, on soft roll. I didn't want to share it with my friends, but I had to let them try it. I'm not sure if everyone in Boston serves a great lobster roll (it is Boston after all), but I'll always remember my first one with you and how delicious it was.\\n\\nMy friends got the Monkfish and the Bluefish. I recall liking the Monkfish, but we all loved the Bluefish. (Again, we shared.) I didn't even know there was something called a \\"bluefish\\". You sent it out beautifully seared and seasoned and seeming like a filet mignon--moist inside and thick like steak--but still flaky. Mmmmmm.  \\n\\nFor sides, we shared the brussel sprouts and the cornbread. Both were plenty big enough for 3 and very enjoyable. (The ONLY negative was that the butter was too firm and never really got a chance to melt into the warm bread.)\\n\\nLater that night, I laid in bed with my hands resting on my full stomach and thought of you fondly. Although there are hundreds of miles between us now, I'll always love you Row 34,  and I will never forget you or our dinner in Boston."},{"name":"Sweet Chili Thai Cuisine","address":"470 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Arlington","stars":"3.5","text":"Order oriental beef instead chicken and basil with beef was burn after we (me&my friend ) had meal we felt sick waitress looks so grumpy and rude most horrible service never had, I   will never recommend to anyone that restaurant please avoid that Thai restaurant good for your health and money"},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"First time trying this place.

We went with the tuna crudo, salmon poke, brussels sprouts, fried calamari, scallop ceviche and some oysters topped w caviar because...why not add the caviar! \\n\\nAs always the tuna was a total stand out and the scallop ceviche was a surprise second, plantain chips...I never knew I was such a fan! The pieces of apple in the ceviche are super refreshing and crisp, I ended up dipping calamari in the left over ceviche juice because it was too good to let it go!! My friend loved the brussels sprouts and was still raving about them the next morning. \\n\\nThe calamari was seasoned well but compared to everything else, it was just....fine.

Based on their online pictures and the description that they had their menus we decided to give it a shot. The restaurant itself is a little dated inside at this location I could probably use an update, but the service was excellent. Our server, Julia, was quick to recommend different dishes after finding out it was our first time there. The food did not quite match the pictures that were on the internet but that's to be expected since they're usually professionally done.  TooJay's describes itself as Jewish comfort food and I would say that it definitely lived up to that description. It was all stuff that you would expect to receive at a visit to grandma or an aunt or an uncle that really like to cook. I had the reuben and the wife had the turkey cranberry griller. I also ordered a couple of things to take with me. I had the Tuscan Chicken sandwich as well as a shepherd's pie to go. To top it off I had the pumpkin spice cake and the wife had the banana dream cake. All of the food was good although I thought the shepherd's pie could have used a little more seasoning. The turkey griller was just okay as well. probably my favorite thing of the night was the Tuscan Chicken sandwich. A little messy and hard to eat as it's lit a part each time you took a bite, but it tasted great. Based on what we thought versus what we saw on the internet I've decided to give A review of three. Which is average. Neither good nor bad, but the service was excellent.\\n\\nMy rating system consists of a 3-star being exactly what you expected and neither good nor bad.

FOOD AT ITS FINEST!!! This is seriously the best tasting dish I've had in a VERY LONG time!!! I wasn't aware that food can taste this good!! The pork tongue was so tender and so flavorful and SO DELICIOUS!! All the textures, sauces, flavors just came together and exploded in my mouth! I highly recommend this dish!! \\n\\nI've also tried some of their empanadas, croquetas, and mango/pineapple smoothie. I've never been a big fan of fried things so the empanadas and croquetas weren't my favorite. The mango/pineapple smoothie tasted so fresh and thick. It really tasted like blended mango and pineapple with a little bit of ice. Really tasty! \\n\\nThe desserts are very aesthetically pleasing to the eyes and equally pleasing to the taste buds. I haven't tried a dessert that I didn't like here yet. Just pick any dessert at random, you won't be disappointed! \\n\\nThe ox tail was also a very notable and delicious dish. The meat is really flavorful and tender, falling off the bone!! But my favorite dish is still lengua en salsa!!\\n\\nService: \\nSuper friendly and nice! All the waiters are fast, efficient, and attentive. Although the restaurant is really busy, they don't ever make you feel like they forgot about you or don't have time to serve you. \\n\\nAmbiance: \\nIt's super small, fast pace, and noisy restaurant. There's always a huge line outside and inside it's a mad rush to get everyone seated and served. They make this small space very cozy and welcoming. The decor is colorful and very Cuban-esque. Makes the walls look very busy but vibrant. \\n\\nPrice: \\nThe dishes are reasonably priced for the quality and quantity of the food you are getting. There are a few things that are priced a little more, like the ox tail, but given how much work is put into making these dishes, I think its still pretty reasonable. \\n\\nOverall: \\nI love this place! It's quickly becoming one of my top places to eat at in Portland! It's definitely worth a try, don't let the long line outside deter you from trying some really good food!

This is where we overheard that a New Seasons Market was going to open in a couple of years somewhere over near NW Raleigh Street.  It was not going to even be all that near where we lived, but still in our neighborhood.  We were so pleased to hear this good news because the nearest one of their stores to us at the time was over in the Beaverton-Hillsdale area.  \\n\\nFast forward two-and-one-half years to yesterday.  I knew that this New Seasons was having its grand opening, but was too busy I thought to go over and observe the fun.  However, my boss had been able to get hold of a Zipcar and \\"forced\\" me to go with her to the opening.  When someone offers me a free ride some place, so I'm pretty ready to go with the fun flow.  We made it over in seven minutes (this at 4 p.m.), split up, and made a sweep through the store.\\n\\nMy first impression was simply how good everything smelled as I walked through the bower of flowers at the front entrance, which is a feature at many of the stores.  I grabbed a cart and veered off to the right where all the cheese and wine and pre-prepared food was located.  Very nice indeed and well organized.  I grabbed some cheese samples on my way through and had a consultation with some nice marketing folks from Bridgeport.  They looked at what I had in my basket and gave me some recommendations about what cider to get to go with my groceries.  Right behind them was/is a bar for anybody to sit down, get something to drink, and wait out the grocery trip.  When I was there, it was all taken up, and I suspect will continue to be the most popular feature in the store.\\n\\nThe store has a great community atmosphere and feeling of friendliness.  I ran into a couple of residents I had worked with at another building and hadn't seen in some time (their infant son is now three; I gave him a baby gift), and I saw a lot of people run into each other much the same way.  The architecture of the store fits in so perfectly with this neighborhood and is quite attractive.\\n\\nI had to move pretty quickly at this time so we wouldn't return the Zipcar late.  I did pick up crackers, white cheddar, tzatziki, and hummus for dinner, watermelon chunks for dessert, and that good cider for dinner (all delicious).  The clerks are pretty thrilled with the new store and especially like the feature of the front part of the store being able to act like a regular garage door to open the front to cool breezes in the morning.  My clerk mentioned loving the higher ceilings here.  The parking area had pretty good flow and what seemed like enough parking, although it was crazy busy at the time we came.  \\n\\nI look forward to coming back to this new New Seasons and taking the time to really inspect everything instead of being a speed racer.  I'm glad the store is here and urge you to return to visit as well."},{"name":"Flour Bakery + Caf√©","address":"12 Farnsworth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Joanne Cheng, you are a queen.\\n\\nFlour Bakery + Cafe has been on my Boston radar ever since I saw their elusive Sticky Bun on Unique Sweets. I mean aside from the fact that they're consistently ranked the best bakery on multiple publications and all. Needless to say, I couldn't leave Boston without going here. My friend and I visited their Waterfront location which is beautiful. It was quiet weekend morning so we didn't have a wait and we could eat outside while basking in the sun. Perfect, right?\\n\\nHow does one decide what to get here? Toughest decision of my day by far. But obviously that sticky bun was on my mind. And I got it. First of all, I love how it's on their breakfast menu. Something that sweet in the morning is a sure-fire way to start your day off right. The staff was more than friendly and made sure that bun was safely delivered to my plate. \\n\\nWithout a doubt, this is the best sticky bun I've ever had (and probably ever will have). Even the mechanics are thought out. The dough is light, fluffy but manages to hold that thick, gooey pecan filling. And they top it off with toasted pecans which adds the crunch factor you didn't know you ever needed. It just all makes sense. I should have seriously considered buying a tray full and shipped them back to NY.\\n\\nAside from that, even their coffee is great.

Now, I admit, I'm of Spanish decent and grew up eating Spanish food in Miami and Spain. So, for that reason, I am predisposed to love a good Spanish restaurant. On the other hand, this makes it incredibly difficult for me to find a restaurant I love which meets my expectations. Barcelona does it, and in spades.\\n\\nWine: Starting with what I love most about Spanish food lol. They have an enormous wine list with some great wines by the glass as well as a plethora of excellent Spanish wines by the bottle. They even have a variety of Vega Sicilia wines.  They also have mixed drinks and a full bar so you won't leave thirsty.\\n\\nAtmosphere: Very comfortable, casual and upscale all at the same time. This is the kind of place you can go to in Jeans and a nice top or get decked out dressed to the nines and still feel comfortable going to. The bar and patio feel more casual than the tables inside but the relaxed feel permeates the whole restaurant. \\n\\nService: The waiters here have always been seriously friendly. They have a system where you get served by two people which at first seemed a bit odd but has really worked out well as we've been back again and again.\\n\\nFood: Ok, here's why I love them... The food tastes like it did in Spain and dishes which we didn't have in Spain had flavors which would be familiar enough to any Spaniard to be called Spanish.  There is no higher praise I can give them. Here's what we've had:\\n\\nPaella De Mariscos: Awesome, best Paella outside of Spain, even better than a couple we had in Spain (I'm looking at you restaurante balcon de europa in Nerja!) Seafood is perfectly cooked and the rice had the nice crispy bits at the bottom. That said, the portion on this is HUGE. It says for two people but I'm not kidding, it would easily feed 4 as an entree. \\n\\nMorcilla: You can ask for the morcilla as an app and I recommend that you do. It has a fantastic texture and flavor that any lover of a good blood sausage would greatly enjoy. It's so rich and creamy it almost approaches a French boudin noir in texture but with all the flavor of the traditional morcilla. \\n\\nMorcilla and Fried eggs: This was/is on their brunch menu and was amazing. The perfect breakfast. I could eat it every day. If Don Quixote had eaten this instead of his Duelos y quebrantos he would have won the fight against the windmills, I'm just saying.\\n\\nCrispy Pig Ears: Remove any notion you have about pig ears being dog food, that's silly and stupid. These little babies are the potato chips of the gods. Thinly sliced, tender pig ears deep fried and sprinkled with a lightly pickled onion garnish. Like dying and going to pig heaven.\\n\\nPulpo: I love pulpo when it's done right and I hate it when it's not. Seriously, I go from rapturous pleasure to heaving. This is of the rapturous variety. \\n\\nWarm Potato Tortilla: Like mom made it, except with an awesome sauce accompanying it and they serve it hot not room temp as I'm used to. \\n\\nGazpacho: This was an odd version of gazpacho, more like a tomato sauce than a soup. Delicious, but not what I or anyone else really would expect.\\n\\nMushrooms and Herbed Goat Cheese: Heaven in a little plate. I love veggies and mushrooms in particular are a fave. These are so good that the goat cheese really isn't even necessary. What makes this dish really is the wine sauce they cook the mushrooms in, so good.\\n\\nGrilled Lamb Chops: This was good but not the best lamb chops I've ever had. A bit tougher than I would have preferred. Flavors were dead on though.\\n\\nChurros: These were real churros, none of your boxed crap here. Extruded into oil, fried on site, served with thick chocolate churro awesomeness. One odd thing was that the chocolate was spicy. I am a churro purist, this was not appreciated. Hubby on the other hand loved it. So I'm really just being a snob here.\\n\\nNote: Their menu rotates quite a bit and it's possible that when you go, none of these things will be on the menu. What I will say in way of advice for those looking to make ordering decisions. Look for things which are more in the traditional vein. They really seem to do these dishes well. That said, you really can't go wrong, I haven't had a single thing here I wish I hadn't, even the gazpacho, which was a bit odd, was tasty. So order with abandon and if at all possible, sit outside. Last time we were there we saw a police run down a perp on foot and arrest him not a block away.

As you can see in the picture, there isn't much texture to it and doesn't look fried. It was more lumpy and wet with a doughy exterior. We barely ate it at the restaurant because it lacked any crunch and was just hard to eat. The dough moved around as you cut it and it just needed some texture to contrast the mushy insides. We took it home and stuck it in the toaster oven the next day for lunch. This helped immensely as it crisped up and got the crunch it needed to be enjoyable.

BUT, i can vouch for its quality and taste.\\n\\nThe internet was particularly slow in the restaurant so my boyfriend and I weren't able to rely on Yelp for pictures/reviews so we somewhat blindly ordered. We decided on the Ajiaco solely because its description mentioned that many consider this to be the national dish of Cuba and being adventurous, we wanted something that represented Cubano food well. This dish did not disappoint at all. It's thick and delicious and defines what comfort food means to me. The corn fritters are slightly sweet which is a good balance with the stew. \\n\\nWe also got a side of the Ma√≠z con Pollo Empanada. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! The crust is so flaky and the filling is absolute perfection. \\n\\nI will definitely be back and next time i'm saving room for dessert and a couple more empanadas!!"},{"name":"Whole Heart Provisions","address":"487 Cambridge St","city":"Allston","stars":"4.5","text":"Whole Heart was my life last summer. Whole Heart offers kind of a vegetarian Chipotle feel with a variety of creatively curated vegetables to add onto a base. I came here at least once a week to get my beloved Cassie bowl. It has Japanese eggplant, chickpeas, pickled cauliflower, green beans, basil, currants, and crispy chickpeas...what could be better? It was perfect to eat in the summer. I would go for long bike rides and get Whole Heart, pretty much never changing my order. Always with half brown rice & quinoa pilaf and half arugula.\\n\\nAs time went on, I stopped going as it wasn't close to work, but when a friend was visiting from out of town I decided we should go back and try it! I ordered the Cassie bowl with half brown rice & quinoa pilaf and half arugula as usual, and my friend got the Seoul bowl with half brown rice & quinoa pilaf and half arugula. It took quite a long time for our food to come despite the place not being that crowded, but ok, maybe my quinoa was cooking. About 13 minutes later we got our food, and my bowl felt warm so I definitely knew something had been cooking. \\n\\nWhen I went to eat it, it tasted bitter, kind of vinegary? Hard to describe. I figured maybe my taste buds had changed and I just wasn't as into the flavors anymore. When I got halfway through I realized my bowl was wrong and they'd filled the whole thing with the marinated kale. As someone who's not the biggest fan of kale, that made sense why it was so bad. The marinade just tasted awful and had seeped into the rest of the bowl so I ended up not finishing it. My friend said his bowl was good, so I was happy with that at least.\\n\\nOverall, my biggest recommendation is don't get the kale and check your order for things they got wrong. I loved Whole Heart but that bowl just did not taste good. I've had the falafel which is good albeit dry, and the Brussels sprouts are good but very greasy. With other vegetarian options nearby, I probably won't be back to Whole Heart in awhile unless I confirm that that it has the base I want."},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I think the only pros for me about this restaurant was being able to eat outdoors on a sunny day, and the clean bathroom.\\n\\nI came for lunch and had high expectations since I love charcuterie and cheese. What I don't like is restaurants passing off appetizers at entree prices. I ordered \\"The Cured,\\" which was $17 and includes a meat/cheese platter. All I can say is that the plate was pretty, but the actual food on it wasn't great. There were a few thin slices of parmesan cheese, a small mix of salad, a smear of dijon mustard, three thick hard slices of bread, and some salty salami (I guess they were serious about calling it \\"The Salty Pig,\\" but the overabundance of salt drowned out the taste of the meat). I think I definitely could have spent $17 on a much better meal. It was fun to pick at my food though."},{"name":"Trident Booksellers & Caf√©","address":"338 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The Trident has been one of my favorite places for 25 years!
