I got there about 5 minutes after the doors opened, and the line was still out the door and down the block...but I now know why people wait for these donuts.\\n\\nI have to say that for a place with all this hype, parking is an issue if you get there during their rush hours. I didn't park near the tracks because I just washed my car.  Luckily, I found some street parking.   After driving 30 minutes to get there, I ended up waiting in line about another 30 minutes.  Once I finally got into the store itself, I saw that the decor is simple, yet effective. which was cool.  Simple menu, with the name, type and price of each donut.  My complaint is that I really wanted a jelly-filled donut and I saw that there were none in the glass case.  Feelings immediately hurt.  I decided to pick a few at random, just to get a good sample size (who am I kidding, I got 5 cuz I drove 30 minutes! haha)\\n\\nBacon & Salted Caramel - The bacon stood out as the flavor to beat.

I know they state that its best to eat them all the same day...I couldn't make it. This one for me was the best of them all.  I threw it in the microwave for 30 seconds and it came back to life.  The bits of apple was amazing.  Not too much frosting to create an overkill effect.\\n\\nPeach Sly - Ughhh this was soo good! Couldn't put it down.

At the time of writing this review, there are two locations in metro Atlanta: this one in Sandy Springs and another in Decatur. This location opened in November 2014. Seven Hens advertises itself as \\"Atlanta's Only Schnitzel Eatery.\\" Sure, there are several restaurants in Atlanta that offer schnitzel on their menus, but I believe Seven Hens is the only restaurant that specializes in schnitzel specifically.\\n\\nI was first introduced to Seven Hens' Sandy Springs location through a Yelp Elite Event in March 2015 (http://www.yelp.com/biz/elite-event-oh-schnitzel-at-seven-hens-sandy-springs-sandy-springs). Owner Michael Gurevich invited us into his kitchen and walked us through the schnitzel making process. I left impressed and a fan, pleasantly surprised by Michael's fast-casual schnitzel concept and the taste of the schnitzel itself. I've subsequently returned as a regular customer.\\n\\nSeven Hens is located in the same shopping center as Publix at the corner of Roswell Rd and Abernathy Rd. The restaurant has a stand in line and order/pay upfront ordering system. All foods are made-to-order and drinks (fountain drinks, tea), plastic silverware, and napkins are self-serve from a station in the back. The kitchen is open so you can see your schnitzel get pounded, breaded, fried, seasoned, and sliced. Orders can be picked up at the window or brought to your table. The place is simple and clean with an open layout, casual atmosphere, and a TV too.\\n\\nThe restaurant uses regional, cage-free, all-natural chicken for its schnitzel. What makes Seven Hens unique is they serve schnitzel in different styles such as American (Cajun BBQ), Mexican (Chipotle Cilantro), Chinese (Ginger Teriyaki), French (Olive Dijon), German (Sauerkraut Dill), Indian (Curry Cucumber), and Italian (Sun-Dried Tomato Pesto). The schnitzel can be served as a sandwich/wrap, in a salad, or sliced on a traditional platter with a side. Prices run about $7.50 to $9.00 each with sides a few dollars extra. You can also customize your own schnitzel starting around six bucks.\\n\\nI've tried the schnitzel here in all three formats (wrap, salad, platter) and I like the platter the best. I just enjoy putting nothing but a crispy, crunchy, and seasoned piece of schnitzel in my mouth. It's quite enjoyable and reminds me of Japanese tonkatsu (which is a very similar fried cutlet, but made with pork instead of chicken).\\n\\nI've tried most of the flavors. If I had to rank them, the list would probably look something like this:\\n\\n1. Sauerkraut Dill (German) - sauerkraut & onions, beer reduction, lemon dill-caper sauce\\n2. Curry Cucumber (Indian) - cucumber salad, curried yogurt dressing, garam masala seasoning\\n3. Chipotle Cilantro (Mexican) - chipotle aioli, cilantro mojo, picante seasoning\\n4. Olive Dijon (French) - Dijon mustard, tangy olive tapenade aioli, Herbs de Provence\\n5. Sun-Dried Tomato Pesto (Italian) - basil pesto, sweet sun-dried tomato aioli, Italian seasoning\\n\\nI like sauerkraut and onions so it's only natural I would gravitate towards the Sauerkraut Dill schnitzel. It comes with lots of delightfully sour sauerkraut with the refreshing dill sauce in a tiny cup on the side. The yogurt dressing for the Curry Cucumber schnitzel is served the same way. I actually like the Curry Cucumber schnitzel on its own without any dressing. It must be the flavorful and aromatic garam masala spice mix.\\n\\nThe Chipotle Cilantro is pretty tasty too thanks to the savory chipotle aioli and mojo. The Olive Dijon and Sun-Dried Tomato Pesto aren't bad, but also aren't my favorites. I tried the Sun-Dried Tomato Pesto in salad form which may have affected my opinion of it. I do like how the herbs infuse an additional layer of flavor into the Olive Dijon schnitzel.\\n\\nSides I've tried include:\\n\\n* Yukon Gold French Fries\\n* Sweet Potato Fries\\n* Crisp Cucumber Salad\\n* Hummus with Veggies & House Chips\\n\\nI can't say I like one side over another. They're all okay to me. I might actually give an edge to the regular French Fries over the Sweet Potato Fries. The Sweet Potato Fries are pretty sweet. The Cucumber Salad is tangy and a bit watery, but that's not totally unexpected. The hummus is good. The chips that come with the hummus are thin and crispy, but greasy too.\\n\\nService is excellent. Michael is friendly and hospitable and one of his managers (not sure of his name) always seems to be on top of his game. \\"All hands on deck!\\"\\n\\nIf you like schnitzel, Seven Hens is definitely worth checking out."},{"name":"Redbones BBQ","address":"55 Chester St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"The food is decent at best, the service is fine.

I got the wrong swordfish dish and they brought out a whole chicken with bones after a boneless \\"chunk\\" chicken was ordered.   A drink was added to our bill that no one ordered.  It took 1/2 an hour to eat, and 1 hour to sort through the bill.

The tortilla helped to cut through the rich fat of the bone marrow.  One entr√©e was the duck breast which was rather bland and too tough to cut.  It came with firm, very tart apple slices over mashed potatoes. The dish was served in a crock, so the potatoes were a little fried.  The other entr√©e was the hanger steak, which was cooked OK.

It was kind of tricky and easier to do with two hands.  I think they should off just used a wide plate so you can dip the whole rice paper in one shot.

He lives a block away and figured it would be easy for him to host a cocktail hour at his apartment and then walk over. They said no immediately. He asked if they even wanted to run some numbers, give him a minimum cost or a price per head. At some point, it would have been profitable for American Craft to host his entire family. Regardless, they said no without even computing a price.

I used to try everything from escargot to sweetbreads. And in that time I found that I liked oysters. To me they were tasty little sea candy.  I thought there only two kinds of oysters Bluepoints and Wellfleets. \\n\\nThen one day I walked into Neptune and my whole world was changed forever. My sea candy had variety!\\n\\nI mean come on, a dozen different types of oysters...and the selection rotates! I'm drooling right now, just so you know.\\n\\nEnough about the oysters (you must have the Island Creek and Kumamoto if you go...that's not a suggestion, that's an order).\\n\\nSo, let's talk about this place in general. It's tucked away on Salem Street in the North End and you'd probably walk past it unless you happen to randomly see a woman shucking oysters in the window. When you walk in it has a French Bistro style going on. There are marble tables (always uneven, but that's what makes this place awesome) and a marble bar and a mainly white interior. So, it feels really clean walking in. \\n\\nThe raw bar menu and specials and wines are all written on mirrors around the place.  There's usually a little Sinatra or Jazz playing at the right volume in the background. And it's cramped or as I like to call it - cozy. I never feel claustrophobic there, but I can imagine some people in this great, big world would.\\n\\nThe staff is phenomenal! I don't want to name names, but each has their own fantastic style that makes this place rock and you really see that they love working there. They also have their own fish names which you can find out by looking on your tab.\\n\\nNeptune probably has one of the top 10 wine lists in this city. The reason why I say this is that you can find an unfiltered Slovenian Ribolla (the wine is freaking orange!) or a high end Albarino or an absolutely delicious, yet inexpensive Vinho Verde. The list is tight, but can satisfy 99% of the tastes that walk in there.\\n\\nLet's move on to food, shall we? Let's start with the clam chowder. Best in the world. Yeah, I just said that. BEST. IN. THE. WORLD. Also, wait for it, they cook it to order. It hasn't been sitting in a vat all day. They cook it personally for you with all fresh ingredients...and some love...with a dash of awesome.\\n\\nThe lobster roll. Oh, god, the lobster roll. The lobster, one of the ugliest creatures to crawl the seas, but it is one of the tastiest creatures to crawl into my belly (okay, that sounded weird, but I'm keeping it). Get the one doused in butter! And then the fries. Fries are one of those foods that baffle me. When they're good they are f'n good. When they're bad, you'll still eat them and they never taste good as leftovers. Anyway, Neptune's fries are ridiculously good - a perfect compliment to the lobster roll. \\n\\nOther notable items are the Maine Lobster \\"Clambake.\\" You get a whole lobster, various shellfish, corn on the cob (which is fantastic), and different things at different times of the year. \\n\\nAlso, the Fritto Misto! Octopus and Squid living to together in perfect harmony!\\n\\nSo go there. Eat. Make a small offering to the god Neptune. Leave happy.\\n\\nPS...There are no reservations. The place is small and there's usually a line. It's so worth the wait, but go for lunch, early, and you can enjoy it all at your pace."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Pretty amazing.\\n2-5:30pm is happy hour at the bar and outside.

When I arrived around noon on a Saturday, the wait was already about 2hours. You can't call ahead for reservations or get food for take out here. Since I was starving, I decided to come back the next day. The wait was a little bit shorter (1.5hrs). It is a very small restaurant, but it's close to the Sowa market so you can wander around there while you wait. Seats at the bar made it quick to order. I started with the clam chowder which was delicious. Large pieces of clam and potato, but not too thick and creamy that it filled me up. I definitely still had room for the lobster roll. I decided to go with the butter lobster roll (comes with salad or fries) instead of mayo and I wasn't disappointed. There was so much lobster it would fall onto my plate when I bit into it! I savored every bite because they definitely don't skimp on the main ingredient!

I'm always a big fan of diner-type breakfast places, and though this doesn't quite strike me as a \\"diner\\" per-say, their food is well above average and on the cusp of excruciatingly delicious. I had their Stalla Bleu burger, which seemed like a good choice. I saw that tots came with and immediately went with the familiar. Garlic Aioli? Don't mind if I do. Coffee, too, please. The waitress (Maddy) was a genuine smile, and wonderful conversation, as well as helpful. The happy hour list looked swell, but I was starving and not in the mood for a drink (Rain check, though. I heard there are MIMOSAS. They found my weak spot.) but as soon as I ordered my food, the lovely Maddy had it there for me, hot and perfect. Unfortunately, breakfast (what I was REALLY craving) stopped serving at 3pm, but I was content and satisfied with a dinner menu. \\n\\nIn the brief minutes I had to wait for my food, I looked around. First thing I noticed: the lighting in here is perfect. Hand-clipped snowflakes and holographic stars hanging from the ceiling. Big open room, not too hot, not too cold, huge Christmas tree for the holidays, and barely a soul in the place.\\n\\nThe food: The half pound of meat on my burger was perfect. The bleu cheese was well worth the money, and trust me, if you only kinda like bleu cheese, get the jam burger, because this burger was LOADED with high-quality, no BS, bleu cheese. The bacon was yummy, just chewy enough and not crispy-weird. The burger was moist, the lettuce was fresh. I don't normally like onions on my burger, and I ate these with GUSTO. The tater-tots were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the perfect bar food made even more perfect. Paired with garlic aioli and everything is beautiful; Nothing hurts.\\n\\nAs we were finishing our food, a band was setting up. A lovely violin player and a stand-up bass, some guitars and whatnot, I was really and truly surprised this place wasn't packed. It's the Thursday night before Christmas, and it's happy hour. where is everyone? Breakfast, I was told, is a lot more crowded, but honestly, who doesn't love breakfast? This is the perfect dinner date spot, too, guys.\\n\\nI'm just pleased with this whole place. I'm sad that they are considering taking away the dinner menu (maybe dinner hours, too?) and honestly, if you care about good food, proper, friendly service, timely waitstaff and a cozy place to listen to old-timey music?

They'd be a nice addition to any sandwich or a starter. \\n\\nSmores creme br√ªl√©e- I wasn't too thrilled with the amount of flavor and I realized that the crisp top of creme br√ªl√©e is my favorite part after I ordered this (this one didn't have crisp top, but marshmallow instead).

It was not crowded at all, but it still took a while for someone to come and seat us. I don't know if it was because I was with four teens, or what, but it just didn't feel like they wanted us there. We finally sat in a booth. It took a while for the waiter to show up, and when he finally did he did not seem very happy at all, he didn't smile at us and didn't seem like he liked us. We all ordered coffee, and he said they were out of coffee. This was at about noon or so. One of us said \\"are you kidding, you're out of coffee at a caf√©!?\\" He just said yes and snipped off - as if we were insane for wanting coffee. He had zero sense of humor, or personality. It seemed like we were annoying him. He was very hipster. We also asked if we could still get breakfast and he said no. Whatever, you can have whatever policies and rules you want, but his attitude was so nasty that it made me feel like he wanted me to go a way. It just seemed like nobody wanted us there. I don't think it's too much to ask that a waiter or waitress at a restaurant at least be a little bit friendly. So we actually got up and walked out, which I never do. The kids I was with were horrified and embarrassed, but they also wanted to leave so we could go somewhere more fun and friendly and get some coffee.

The first strike against this restaurant is that they failed to post their Valentine's Day menu on their website. We made a few calls and couldn't get a straight answer and it was too late to cancel without them charging our card. Just as I feared, if we had known what they were serving we never would have chosen Bondir. The space was nice and intimate and the service was friendly and fast. The food, however left a lot to be desired. \\n\\nThe first course was sashimi, something that I would never order if given the choice (refer back to my comment about not posting the menu ahead of time. This will be the theme of the night). \\n\\nThey then gave us bread they made in-house and butter. I hate to say it, but after the 4th course, this was the culinary highlight of the night. \\n\\nThe second course was Dashi which some kind of soup with a poached egg in the middle, surrounded by what looked and tasted like cooked seaweed. It was lukewarm which is weird for a soup. I didn't like it at all. Again, I never would have eaten that normally. So that's 2 courses that I barely touched. Not a good start. \\n\\nThe third course was duck which I love, unfortunately it was very undercooked. I prefer meat to be cooked medium-well. Actually, something I noticed about all their dishes was that they were undercooked or raw, lukewarm and mushy. No bueno. \\n\\nThe next course was Amazake, a fermented rice pudding with blue cheese on top. This was actually really good. I was pleasantly surprised. By far the best dish of the night. \\n\\nThe deserts were apple sorbet with bee pollen as well as Tea and Honey with custard. The custard was, can you guess? Mushy and lukewarm. They were both good but nothing to write home about. After all that, the bill came out to $215. Ouch. All things considered we would have been better off grabbing burgers or a pizza somewhere.

As a holiday gift, my partner and I decided to treat ourselves to dinner here a couple of nights before Christmas.  Yes, the views from the 30th floor are tremendous: go for happy hour, have a drink or two, then move onward. \\nUpon our arrival, the atmosphere was crazy, as there was an insanely loud group of people in the bar, screeching Christmas carols at the top of their lungs along with the piano player.  Fortunately, this was a bit more muffled in the dining area.  Though we had made reservations for two a couple of weeks prior, we were seated at a humongous booth.  We had to sit side by side to be able to talk and feel romantic.  Otherwise, we would have been shouting at each other. \\nWe ordered cocktails, which were good.  Then we had a shared wedge salad to start off with.  The dressing was very, very sweet and the candied bacon was very, very sweet.  It was all way too sweet.  Frankly, the dive bar up the street from us serves a much tastier wedge salad at a much more reasonable price.  \\nFor dinner, I had a special, the crab stuffed halibut.  It was described as being cooked with cream cheese and several spices, it tasted just ok, like decent fish, but nothing special.  No wow factor.  \\nI tasted my partner's Wagyu steak, which is sort of like Kobe beef, it was excellent, very melt in your mouth and delicious.  His accompanying green beans and fries were good, but very, very salty. \\nFor dessert, we had the chocolate bourbon cake layered with praline mousse.  It sounded so divine, but tasted so average.  It seriously looked very pre-fab, as if they had just rolled it off a Sysco food service truck.  It was garnished with a piece of chocolate that was much tastier than the cake.  There was a scoop of vanilla Haagen-Dasz on the side with a praline type thing underneath it.  This was delicious, but when Haagen-Dasz is outshining your cake, there's a problem....\\nService was middling.  Our server was very nice and unobtrusive, but my partner felt she brought out the courses too quickly and felt rushed. Also, no one checked on us to see how our dinner was after our food was brought out.  My partner wasn't finished with his cocktail and she took it away. \\nMake no mistake, the views are breathtaking here and our food was decent, but at these prices, the food should be amazing, and it simply wasn't.  We've had much better dinners at Cassidy's, also in downtown Portland, and it's much less expensive there.  And if you want to experience truly great high end dining, The Bay House in Lincoln City can't be beat. \\nThe next time we have a special occasion dinner, we'll be dining elsewhere."},{"name":"Scratch","address":"223 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"What an awesome quaint and modern spot.

It was 5:50pm on a Thursday night. Seriously?\\nWhen we were leaving, we noticed other tables were still getting served fish cake. If you only wanted to give out one order of hag particular side dish, you should just say it.\\nVery poor customer service.\\n\\nAbout be food: The beef and pork was seasoned well but for the price, the portions were so small compared to other nearby Korean bbq places. Not worth a $45 dinner. I would go somewhere else if you were looking to be full. \\n\\nI wouldn't go again and I would recommend it to friends.

No celery, no mayo, just delicious lobster on a roll.  Pricey but worth it.  The  cioppino gets a mixed review - loaded with mussels, clams, shrimp and a hunk of white fish they got the seafood part of the dish perfect.

Then we had dinner salads- just your basic greens, cucumbers and croutons.  The ranch dressing was tasty, but the salad was sitting in a puddle of water and the croutons were a little chewy.  \\nFor entrees, I had the prosciutto carbonara.  It had green peppers, red onions, and mealy tomatoes mixed in with a bland alfredo-like sauce and served with penne (supposed to be \\"egg noodles\\" according to the menu).  It was NOT like any carbonara I've ever had...  I ate less than half (with hubby helping) and did not take home leftovers.  My husband had the \\"special of the night\\"- spicy chicken calzone.  It had good heat, but not necessarily a lot of flavor.  I think it had the same bland alfredo sauce on/in it.  There were also sun-dried tomatoes that were still pretty jerky-like in their texture- bleh!  There were also a few random black olive slices.  The crust was decent, although hubby thought it was a little doughy.  We did not take our chances on dessert.  It amazes me that any restaurant within a 30-minute drive of food mecca, Portland, can survive serving below-average food.  But, you don't even have to go that far.

The \\"ee-ve-ee\\" was great, as were off menu cocktails like the last word. \\n\\nFor food, we started with the crudo tasting and were impressed by the preparation and freshness. A great journey with citrus, then spice, the salt, then bitter. It was amazing. The lamb chops were excellent (although seemed overpriced comparitively even though they were great), the meatballs were tasty (and reasonably priced). Then we had the lobster pasta dish and the sausage and fennel pasta dishes. Wow. Both featured plenty of meat/lobster, the pasta was perfectly cooked, and the flavor so good we wanted to lick the dishes afterward. \\n\\nThere are plenty of meals that we've finished and said, \\"that was really good\\", sometimes we say \\"that was great\\". Its not often that we say, \\"this was exceptional\\". If you're in venice beach, CA, you can say that at Gjelina. If you're in copehagen, you can say that after some fish and chips and grilled lobster at Hummer. Chicago? Maybe girl and the goat. In Boston, Bar Mezzana is your best shot at being wowed. \\n\\nWell done."},{"name":"Burger King","address":"14025 Town Loop Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"1.5","text":"How on earth is this location still open?

I would suggest that they cook the baked garlic appetizer just a little bit longer; cloves were still a bit hard. The wine list was adequate with some nice choices. Serving sizes are large and could easily be spllit for the smaller appetites. The service was prompt and friendly. Our biggest complaint was not really about the restaurant but about the patrons. Lots of kids and lots of parents not controlling their kids. It was loud!! One mom was on her cell phone trying to juggle a crying baby. I feel sympathy for both the mom and the restaurant staff, but please, if you are going to have a sign that says \\"no cell phone use\\" in the restaurant, have the guts to enforce it.

The beef was cooked well and was flavorful. The broth wasn't too salty and tasted delicious.

Multiple citations of having the best lobster roll in town (which they better have, at $25 a roll), so I had to give it a whirl.\\n\\nVery crowded, so get here early, and then expect to go wander the streets of Boston or hang out at a bar somewhere to wait for them to call you when your seat is ready.  (Excellent choice by the way, instead of forcing people to wait around outside the restaurant).\\n\\nSat down and ordered up a slew of oysters to try, two lobsters rolls (one hot, one cold), Neptune's on Piggback, and Clam Chowder.  Here's the word:\\n\\nClam Chowder:  Excellent flavor, very fresh tasting ingredients from the clams to the potatoes and herbs.  A bit watery for my tastes (probably because I grew up on thick creamy Campbells like 95% of the US population), but even with the wateriness, there was no lacking in flavor.  \\n\\nNeptune's on Piggyback - Oh lordy, this was good... perfectly fried oysters on well made pork with golden raisins and pistachio aioli.  This is some fine dining... my only regrets are that I had to share this with my friend, and that there wasn't more when we licked the plate clean.\\n\\nOysters and clams:  We ordered up a selection of Katama Bay, Bees River, Kumomoto, Kusshi, Little Necks, and Cherrystones.  All were excellent, fresh and delicious... stand outs were the Kumomoto (large and good flavor), as well as the Katama Bays.  \\n\\nLobster Rolls:  The main course... we dove into the cold (mayo based) and hot (garlic oil based) and compared the two.  Maybe it was the slightly chilled rainy day, but I preferred the hot with the warm garlic oil softening the nicely toasted bread.  Both were excellent, the lobsters were cooked perfectly tender, and very enjoyable.  $25 worth?  I'm not fully convinced... you'll have to decide that for yourself... but definitely the best lobster roll I've had to date.\\n\\nVerdict:  If you've got time in Boston and don't 'mind a little wait, definitely worth checking out for the raw bar, the Neptune on Piggyback, and potentially the lobster roll.  I would love to go back for raw bar and Neptune on Piggyback alone, and still undecided about the lobster roll.

There is hardly any sight of cilantro in the pico, and the 'hot salsa' was made with far too many dried chilies that were over toasted (burnt), and was barely hot. Thankfully I had my own bottle of Cholula hot sauce to help this all go down. The chips are interesting and certainly the best thing I had - a weird blend of flour that essentially comes out as a light and fluffy flour chip. Overall it's just sooo \\"meh\\".

My wife and I decided to try this restaurant for the first time last night before we headed down town to see Wicked at the Bob Carr theater.    We arrived on time for our reservation and were seated in the solarium, which was very nice.  We had allowed about 1 hour & 15 minutes between our arrival time and when we would need to leave for the show.  Since there were only 5 other tables occupied in the restaurant that should have been plenty of time.  \\n\\nOur waitress eventually took our drink order and at the same time we also ordered the lobster dip appetizer.  After about 10 minutes our drinks arrived and she said she'd be back to take our dinner order.  Another 10 minutes pass and she finally takes our meal order which included a salad and entree.  After 30 minutes of receiving nothing, not even our bread, I was concerned that we would never be able to finish our appetizer, salads and entree on time.  After a few unsuccesful attempts to get her attention I walked out to find our waitress.  I explained our time constraints and asked if she could cancel our appetizer.  A few minutes after returning to our table the waitress appeared and stated \\"You know what, If you'd like to just leave you can...forget about your one glass of wine.  You can just go\\".  I explained that we were ok we just wanted to cancel the appetizer.  She said ok and walked away shaking her head.  A few minutes later the appetizer appeared at our table and she proceeded to state \\"I'm confused, did you want me to put in your order or were you leaving.\\" Finally frustrated I asked \\"Do you want us to leave?  It sounds like you do.\\"  She replied \\"No, I would like it if you stayed but you're making me feel like I did something wrong here and I didn't\\"  Again I explained I only canceled the appetizer because of our time constraints and she stated \\"Well that's why I said you could leave, because you know your meal might take 10 minutes to cook\\"  \\n\\nSince I knew I wouldn't have time to go to another restaurant and still make the show I stayed when I normally would have ran.  What followed was a rush of salad and entree arriving practically all at once.  The $12 lobster dip was tasty but extremely overpriced.  My wife's $29 Crab Cakes were outstanding and definitely of the quality I would expect from a high end restaurant and that price range.  My Catch of the day was a severe disappointment.  $25 for a piece of overcooked mahi with no seasoning, 1/2 cup of rice and 1 piece of broccoli."},{"name":"La Grotta Ristorante Italiano","address":"2637 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I was given a Groupon by  relative, so my wife and I decided to check them out. I have 16+ years in the Restaurant/Hospitality industry and my wife is a chef and does sales for a large corporate catering company here in Atlanta. So our review is based off of 30 years of restaurant/hospitality experience and expertise. \\n\\nI will lay out the positives first. The food and its flavors where spectacular and I LOVE the flexible menu. Allowing me to change things around and the fact that they'll make things that aren't on the menu, that is a HUGE plus in the service department. I fight with the chef at the restaurant I work at about even minor changes or requests. So i appreciate the willingness to please when dinning at other places. Its great service. The liver pate  served with the bread service is AMAZING, I wanted more. Another bonus with this place was the service from our waiter. Richard was great and the timing of our courses was perfect. Really couldn't have been better from that aspect. The wine list was super extensive and I love that they have great Italian wines and fantastic American wines as well. The Valets when we arrived were AWESOMEly friendly and had a happy smile and demeanor. Jimi was great and treated us well and made us feel welcome.\\n\\nNow for the things I did not like. First and for most the plate sizes were extraordinarily  small, unfilling and worst of all lacked value. I paid $28 for a Veal Piccata with 2 small cutlets of veal, a smidgen of what tasted like instant mashed potatoes, 6-7 green beans and half a petite zucchini. Even with an appetizer of beef carpaccio, an arugula salad with a few small golden beats, 2 baskets of bread, a tiramisu AND a single espresso, I left there still very hungry. My wife had the Gnocchi's which were mushy and had no bite to them. She also had a glass of wine that was fantastic. Our bill was $95 plus I left a $25 gratuity. \\nWe left there very unimpressed with the quantity of food for the price. Little to no value in that respect. The food was mostly good, except the mushy Gnocchi and mashed potatoes that tasted like instant potatoes. My wife is a chef and that was her opinion too. They did not taste fresh. All in all the Piccata was amazing just wish there was more of it.  The salad was small, as was the carpaccio. The tiramisu was a very small piece. \\n\\nThe atmosphere was VERY pretentious. The manager didn't stop by our table although he walked around the dinning room several times.  The location is absolutely horrid. When entering the condo building that the La Grotta is in, we were under the impression it was a retirement home. It smelled like my grand mothers house in her later years. Finding the entrance was maze like. I almost felt like a mouse trying to find the cheese. When we finally found the host stand the hostess was less then inviting although extraordinarily attractive. Our intial greet was blah but mostly friendly. The dinning room itself was nice but when you look closely, you could see it was in disrepair. The clothe on the ceiling was falling down in certain spots. We wanted to sit on the patio but were told there was a private party out there and we could sit out there for at least 30 minutes. So we opted for inside. Our reservation was met immediately and we were seated immediately. \\n\\nSo the final verdict is.... Great tasting food, but to pay $120 after gratuity and still be pretty darn hungry is deplorable. We will not go back for the lack of value itself. The prices are kind of steep especially considering the portion sizes. The server was the saving grace as was the flavors, but not enough for us to want to come back or tell our friends about it."},{"name":"Mikado Sushi","address":"13586 Village Park Dr, Ste 306","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"My wife's sashimi lunch special looked amazing, but my rolls were just average.

Yatai is a bit hard to find if you're not  a campus regular, accessible either through the Hole in the Wall dive bar or from the alley around back.

I sent my order back because it was just not what I ordered.  20 min. later, my food had still not arrived.  In fact it never arrived.

Fortunately, there's a lot to do in the area so don't be too swayed by the wait!\\n\\nThe restaurant is small, which definitely accounts for the wait. Sitting at the bar, or even the tables, is basically elbow to elbow. It definitely gives you space to meet your neighbors; we sat next to regulars and they truly loved this restaurant, and it added to the positive vibes.  \\n\\nEverything I've had here is absolutely wonderful and delicious. \\n+OYSTERS: They have quite the variety with wonderful descriptions, such as popcorn, brown butter, and fruity. Since we're from the West Coast, we stayed away from those and had the Wellfleet, Island Creek, Katama Bay, and Beausoleil. Our favorites were definitely the Island Creek and Wellfleets!\\n+CRAB CLAW: While on the expensive side, they were deliciously sweet and plump. It was my first time having them and glad it was here.\\n+WELLFLEET CLAM CHOWDER: The soup is incredibly flavorful with the taste of clams. It's creamy even though not it's not a thick soup. There's also large chunks of clams and potatoes. One of my favorite clam chowders! (I definitely prefer the thin cream of it.)\\n+NEPTUNE JOHNNYCAKE: Unexpectedly delicious! The cake itself is soft and buttery, with crispy edges. Be sure to spread out the bluefish though, which is salty and fishy. If you enjoy fishy flavors, I 100% recommend this.\\n+LOBSTER ROLL: A chunky and hearty lobster roll; there is so much lobster! I ended up getting too full and eating only the lobster and the bread looked almost hollowed out. \\n+NORTH END CIOPPINO: I haven't had many but this is probably the best I've had. The broth is incredibly flavorful with a hint of spiciness. I've had cioppino in which the seafood is overcooked but that isn't so here. The salmon was so soft and melt in my mouth, while the mussels were perfectly cooked. \\n+FRIED IPSWICH CLAMS: The clams are so soft with a fantastically crispy exterior. It comes with what tastes like a homemade tartar sauce.\\n\\nAll in all, the food here is outstanding, and it's what I hope for in Boston seafood. Everything I've gotten here is delicious!

They have a system when the hostess puts the notecard on the table that any server should immediately greet the table and take the drink order. Then, the notecard is taken away when the actual server takes the food order. My first impression here was not so great. Service is very professional and polite, but unfortunately, speed of service needs some work. We came for lunch on Saturday around 1 PM and there were maybe 3 other tables, but the servers just seemed to be standing around. It took a while for us to be greeted and for our orders for our entrees to be taken. We asked for the sourdough bread and it took a while. Everything just took too long, to the point that we were looking around for someone, anyone, to notice that we needed assistance. \\n\\nFood prices are pretty reasonable, especially considering the impressive portion sizes. We ordered 3 entrees for 4 people and we took plenty of food home with us. Taste is comparable to the other J Alexander's restaurants that I have been to.

Finally told her about my meal that never came out. She disappeared for another 10 minutes. Everybody done. And lastly, mac and cheese described and promised with no bread crumbs on top. They were everywhere. The child this was for is special needs and very picky with food. \\n\\nThe only thing the manager did was take off my meal (duh, it never arrived) & Mac and cheese.

This is a very good place, with an approachable menu, crisp flavors, and a helpful staff.  \\n\\nWe got two appetizers, both on the recommendation of other Yelpers.  The duck grape leaves were outstanding -- the duck was well-cooked, and the spices were subtle and complementary.  The lamb spring rolls were also good, but nothing extraordinary.  \\n\\nI had a pork grape leaves bun, and I loved it.  The proportion of noodle to protein was perfect, and the noodles were sized properly (no crazy dangling pasta embarrassment here).  My friend got a rice dish with chicken, which looked simple but good, and he said it was tasty.  The free dessert at the end was a perfect end to the meal.\\n\\nIf you're new to the Buford Highway Corridor, this would be a great introduction to the culinary delights that await you there.  The restaurant is clean and simply decorated, and the staff are helpful and attentive.  If you can't find something that sounds good on this menu, then you may just want to avoid Asian cuisine entirely.  \\n\\nCan't wait to go back and try the mango salad everyone raves about!"},{"name":"Mandarin Buffet","address":"1100 Revere Beach Pkwy","city":"Chelsea","stars":"3","text":"This restaurant is great, inexpensive food, plenty of options and every time you go there is variety!

If you don't like dives, I would not recommend this place at all. \\n\\nThe menu is huge, the food is never great, but always satisfying. The variety is amazing - you can get typical American bar food (hamburgers, salads, greasy appetizers), Mexican (quesadillas, burritos, huevos rancheros), Greek (gyros, greek salad), French, Italian...do I need to keep going? I've had a smattering of items on the menu, my two go twos are the Dube Deluxe Burger (burger with blue cheese and bacon, I get it with guac on the side, delicious) and the club sandwich. If you want to make it a platter, you can add 2 sides for $3 - sounds expensive, but worth it. But really, try anything try everything - especially try the Dube Nuggets with Berries Inferno sauce - it's freaking delicious! (and not actually spicy). \\n\\nOn top of all the food choices, there's a full bar lots of beer choices, and great happy hour prices. One thing I will say is that so far the Dube has one of the best Bloody Mary's that's I've managed to find in Columbus. Perfectly spicy (for me at least) just the right amount of tomato, and if you ask, they will give you extra olives. \\n\\nLastly, I can't write a review without mentioning the cool ceiling tiles.

The gumbo was really good but the other two items were okay at best.  My sister had the Chicken & Waffle Po-Boy off the specials menu.  It really wasn't a \\"Po-Boy\\" but it was delicious.

However the menu says eggs, plural.

The place has seats for 16 max, with 4 tables total. Seems a lot like a carrry-out joint more than a dine-in, but of course you have 2 options. We went in, no other customers were there. There was an older guy, who turned out to the the kitchen assistant. Told us he doesn't know where the chef went, so we can order first, and the chef will be back from his errands to make the food. Uhh, okay...We ordered, and 10 minutes later, the chef showed and began cooking. Everything is order-to-cook. We were there for a good hour waiting for our carry-out order to be completed. There are only 2 staff in the whole place. The decor is lacking, but over all, it's not dirty. Jamaican music playing in the background, have a good dance while you wait. The front glass counter features bagged chips & sodas.\\n\\nWe ordered the following (see pictures):\\n1) JFC (Jamaican friend chicken), fried plantains & fried rice\\n2) Jerk chicken, sides curried potatoes & steamed cabbage\\n3) Peppered steak, sides curried potatoes & tropical vegi salad\\n4) Brn/Stew chicken (brown stew), sides okra & potato salad\\n\\n1) Fried chicken pieces...HUGE! I didn't notice any major difference compared to  American fried chicken, except it's not crunchy. There was a bit of orange sauce (sweet & sour) under the chicken, and I'm not quite sure what to make of it. I don't care much for sweet & sour food. The plantains were good, but nothing special. Fried rice was interesting, cannot describe the taste, but it's more like steamed rice mix with very little bits of carrots mixed with some brown season. Not overwhelming, but interesting flavor. It's moist, not \\"fried\\" as we are familiar with \\"fried rice\\".\\n\\n2) Jerk chicken, it's BBQ chicken, TONS of smokey flavor. I didn't like so much, but the hubby thought it was alright. Curried potatoes, awesome! I love anything with curry flavor. =) The best side out of all the sides we had chosen. Steamed cabbage was just that, steamed. Nothing special there.\\n\\n3) Pepper steak, I expected a massive chunk, but only got like 15 thin slices of beef, cooked in a sweet & sour brown sauce. =/ Again with the sweet & sour seasoning. =( The tropical salad is simply iceberg lettuce & slices of bell peppers, No dressing. Curried potatoes, I loved.\\n\\n4) Brown stew chicken, few chicken pieces cooked in...yet again, sweet & sour sauce w/bell peppers. The okra & steamed cabbage side was okay, not as much okra (like 3 pieces) as cabbage. The potato salad was okay. This one was warm. Interesting. It all same in a square take-out box, which spilled stew all over the plastic bag. =( Maybe should get soup containers. Maybe?\\n\\nOverall, the place isn't a looker, but there are lots of food here to try. I'm glad for a Jamaican restaurant being in the Columbus ethnic scene! The best thing I enjoyed from all the dishes above was the curried potato. Everything else didn't wow me, sorry. =( The older guy up front is funny, though, loves to dance. =D I have to give props to the chef, who seems to put a lot of effort into making his food, though, from the way he takes his time to the plating of the food."},{"name":"Portland City Grill","address":"111 SW 5th Ave, Fl 30","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"All day happy hour on Sundays is the best!

The menu is VERY limited and truthfully they need to change it up to have a couple of simple menu selections for the business traveler that does not want \\"fancy\\" food or has tried everything and just wants a home cooked meal or a \\"big salad\\".  When they first opened the chef was amazing - the dishes were works of art and the food was truly Canadian/American. \\n\\nNow almost 5 years later not so much. Pretty much airport hotel food trying to be \\"Master Chef\\". And if it is something I'm seeking that's great but at a hotel by the airport - not so much. But that is totally my opinion and I know others will not agree. \\n\\nHowever I've had the spaghetti boulanaise (a while back) and it was outstanding. Lately I'm pretty much low carb so the menu options are extremely limited to the Wall burger, which is great....but frankly everything else on the menu is loaded with carbs and the ones that aren't are too expensive for a hotel restaurant. \\n\\nThe bar is always packed and it's just too loud to eat your meal especially tonight. The bar/restaurant echos because it's so small and there is nothing to absorb all the noise/sound and when drunks are too loud at 6pm - yelling, whooping and acting like jackasses and the staff can't do anything because they are well frankly - too nice well.....it's kind of rude ! Just saying (not just once but every time I've been here for dinner). \\n\\nThere is NO consistency to their food. One night you could order the Cesar salad and there is lots (too much parmesan) and a couple peices of bacon and the next night so much dressing and nothing else. Very disappointing - to add to the disappointment the dressing is from a jar - seriously they hire a chef that can't make a caesar salad dressing - where's the justice !! The bacon is weird, they say its \\"cured\\" but it tastes \\"old\\" and who ever did the prep must have a huge mouth cause the prices of lettuce were huge and having to cut every peice of lettuce so it fits in the form and in your mouth is odd for a salad. \\n\\nBreakfast is always good here - lots of selections and it's just an awesome breakfast or brunch menu and of course the staff are great - always helpful and very attentive - morning, noon and night !\\n\\nSo I have mixed feelings for the place.....servers 4 stars.....chef...sorry to say 2 stars (at night) 3 star (day) and WESTIN listen up and make some changes cause you earned -2 stars for letting this place slide so much  !!

I was able to experience the large size, but the quality was average in my opinion.\\n\\nTo start with, I came at 5:30 on a Friday not expecting it to be super busy- bad idea, they already had a wait of over an hour and the entire first come, first serve bar was full. I waited almost 30 minutes before finally snagging the first bar seat to open up and immediately ordered the Jaegar burger. After around 30 more minutes waiting for the food to come out, I was finally greeted with a massive burger. The jaeger is open-faced and topped with grilled onions, mushrooms, and vidalia sour cream with side of fries. The 3/4 pound patty was juicy and high quality, but nothing about the burger stood out at all. The sour cream was mediocre, and the grilled onions and mushrooms didn't add much flavor. I should have ordered cheese on the burger but didn't think of adding any unfortunately. I would rate the burger between 3 and 4 stars, but it was nothing out of this world or life changing like a few buddies of mine have stated. \\n\\nThe worst part of my experience with Thurman's was the service.

The rich smell of BBQ sauce, the crowded dining area, and the excited and loud laughter make Redbones a great place for a family or friends night out. The waitstaff is credibly friendly and the music is always eclectic and fun. You definitely get your money's worth in terms of portions. In terms of taste, however, the food is decent (e.g. not bad for a BBQ place in New England). My major complaint is the meat is too dry! Not juicy enough, not fall-off-the-bones enough, and not enough sauce!

Then they made it over into a Malaysain restaurant and upped all the prices; we avoided it. But we were delighted to see it has switched back to a Chinese menu. I just read some of the very negative reviews below, so I thought I'd weigh in with a fairly positive one, reflecting our experience. We ordered half a duck, chinese brocolli w oyster sauce, veg fried rice, shrimp kung pao, and salt and pepper squid (off the menu but we requested it). The food was good. Not amazing but well within Chinatown standards. Shrimp was the best, with plenty shrimp and good flavor. The squid was pretty good -- slightly overcooked and chewy but tasty. The duck was average. The  broccoli was fine.  But most of all, the portions were very good, making it what I call good value. The service was quick, too. ON a Saturday night, when every other restaurant had a long wait, this place was able to get us right in (it was half-full). So, to summarize, if your other favorites are full, this is a fine port in a storm. We will likely go back.

The music they play is also very Caribbean, the Fania all-star music of Oscar De Leon and Celia Cruz and other greats will fill your ears as you wait for your food. My husband had the Mofongo con Pernil with the garlic wine sauce and this was spectacular as well. If you are still wanting some dessert after dinner I highly recommend the quesillo or cheese flan.

Others in town try to do South American food, but anyone would be a fool to go there. Their food is mediocre and not priced as reasonably as Chagos. As well, just in case you were wondering the husband is Chagos that is his nick name. He is Puerto Rican and his wife is Venezuelan.

I've eaten at other fine restaurants and steak houses where the bartenders are just as good or sometimes better than the waiters at serving me.  On this occasion, I ordered a salad and an entree, along with a beer (btw, their beer selection is very average and they need more craft beers). \\n\\nAfter a little while, I was wondering what was taking my salad so long to arrive.  And then here comes my entree!  I told the server who brought it out to me (who was not the bartender) that I ordered a salad and wanted it first.  So he took it away.  My salad arrived a couple minutes later.  About half way through my salad...surprise! Here comes my entree a second time.  I told the server I wanted to finish my salad first and asked him to take it away.  Finally, after my salad, my entree arrives the third time and I finally eat it.  \\n\\nI asked the bartender if the servers had any concept of the importance of \\"timing\\"  when various parts of a meal should be served.  He said that when the kitchen finishes a dish, they instruct the servers to take it out.  Not a very professional observation on his part.  I think it's obvious the bartender just keyed in my order soon after taking it from me and that was it....he thought his part of the order taking was all done.  \\n\\nIt's not the kitchen's fault or even the servers who are running the dishes out to the floor.  This bartender might make a great drink but he really sucks at serving a meal.  Someone needs to train Joey D's bartenders how to put in an order so the different parts of the meal arrive in order and on time.\\n\\nI have no idea if I was served the same dish three times or they cooked up a separate one each time.

The biscuits were hefty but unremarkable, hardly flaky or \\"biscuity\\", and the sausage gravy was terrible. If there even was sausage it was  too finely ground to be detected, but their primary sin was that the gravy is SWEET. We have never tasted sweet sausage gravy. Maybe the founders  were raised in a family with a high incidence of diabetes and didn't know any better, but honey \\"sweet gravy\\" is just not right. \\n\\nAnd speaking of honey, where are the honey bears?

Last week was the tempura chicken and fish basket with fries -  five star for the food but the portion was a bit small so...4 again.\\n\\nOne of my favorite items on the menu is the tortilla soup.  Granted, no two restaurants have the same tortilla soup recipe but this one's outstanding.  I especially like chunks of avocado in the soup.

I had been there before and this was her first time there. We both ordered a bacon cheeseburger, but she ordered hers plain and dry. I won't go into details as to why, but she had to take back her burger twice. The nice lady behind the counter (I'm thinking she was one of the owners) didn't roll her eyes or sigh audibly - she apologized profusely, fixed the order properly and even refunded our money and gave us a free milkshake. Overkill?  Maybe, but when was the last time a restaurant did more than they needed to to make a situation right - and without being asked? \\n\\nAs for the burger itself - well, once it was corrected, she devoured that bad boy. The buns are toasted and delicious - not nearly as good as the fresh baked buns at Burger Tex, but they're still great. The meat is cooked just right and the fries are some of the best I've ever had.

It was included when our drinks finally arrived but after she placed her order, it was almost 8p by the time get drink arrived! Another in our party asked for a Merlot and was brought a white wine, which we had to send back. When our appetizer was brought to the table, the runner didn't bother to bus the used dishes. It wasn't until we spoke to the manager that the service drastically improved. I can understand if there were numerous large parties, which there were this evening, but regardless the service was absolutely abysmal. I don't blame the server; I'm sure the the kitchen or bar was backed up, but it would have been nice to have been informed about the delay. Fortunately, we were enjoying each other's company so the delays weren't interminable. Food was okay - what you would expect from a chain.

It is consistently delicious\\n2. Very strong drinks\\n3. Best value in town.\\n\\nI grew up in California, where the Mexican restaurants come in all shapes and sizes.

The decor is... outdated. Lots of brown.\\n\\nWHO CARES?!\\n\\nThis place is simply amazing. Margaritas are strong and most are tasty. Go with the Premium if you want to forget a long day, the House if you just want something simple, or Boulder's Best if you want to treat yourself. One of my favorites is the White Lightening for a change.\\n\\nI usually get a Chimichanga, the beef is my favorite but the chicken is great as well. It comes loaded with sour cream, guacamole, cheese, and a choice of rice and beans or salad. The enchilada is another house specialty, highly recommended. Get the Efrain if you dare (mystery burrito with a 10/10 heat rating.)\\n\\nThe real key to the whole affair is the chili verde. It depends what day you go, but don't be suprised by the heat! This stuff can be hot! They must slow cook this stuff for hours, because the pork pieces are even hotter then the actual chili. \\n\\nLook around, and you will see many diners doing the same thing.

He asked me if there was a place in Columbus where he could just get a really good medium rare steak without going to a steak house. Not being overly familiar with Barcelona's menu since I hadn't been there in a couple years, I suggested going here. He noticed there wasn't anything on the menu that struck his fancy, so he asked the server if they could give him a medium rare steak with no frills. Without any hesitation the server assured him they could. After only about half a bottle of wine later, a perfect, no-frills medium rare steak (and side dish) were placed before him. Upon biting into the steak my friend was giddy with pleasure because, according to him, it was one of the best, purest-tasting steaks he's ever had. (Take into consideration he's dined at some of New York's best restaurants.)  I must admit my scallops were easily the best I've had in Columbus.\\n\\nFriend #2, who hails from San Francisco, wanted the sweet and spicy compote of baby lima beans, bacon, cream, mushrooms, dates and chile flakes that originally comes with the scallops since I had told him about my experience with them, however, he has an allergy to scallops, so he asked if he could replace the scallops with another fish. The server was highly knowledgeable as far as what would compliment the spicy sweetness of the compote and made a match for my friend that he wound up loving. To be honest, I was a bit afraid to have him order a seafood dish since he's constantly saying how San Francisco has amazing seafood. Needless to say, we were both extremely happy with our dishes.\\n\\nThe restaurant seems to be very accommodating whenever you ask for something they might not have on the menu. Not only has the chef been accommodating, but the servers have been as well. On my last two visits we received a complimentary amuse bouche, both of which surprisingly complimented our meals very nicely.\\n\\nAnother thing I'm very pleased with is that while the restaurant could be considered slightly upscale, the patio and interior are very relaxing, and not pretentious in any way.

Typically we steer clear of fried rolls, but there were 3 other reviews talking about how good the Wild Cat was so we felt like we had to try it.  Tasty!  Very lightly breaded and fried and the flavors were great.  Service was friendly and quick.  There were even 2 guests that come in every day to eat!  Best part is that they deliver within a 4 mile radius, so lucky for us if we want to get our sushi fix we don't even have to leave the house.

Granted, if you find yourself, on a weekend in the middle of a craving for bbq, just remember that you will have to wait a while.  A good thing to do is also try to snag one of the high tables downstairs by the bar but its pretty much a free for all.  \\n\\nA great appetizer to start out with is probably the corn fritters.  Deep fried corn bread with chunks of corn, soaked in honey, how can you go wrong?  When ordering, be sure to ask for the homemade whipped cream. This is one of the top things they have here.  The apps in general are good, but go for the fritters. Once you have them, its pretty much a sure bet you'll get them again and again each time you come back.\\n\\nAs far as the meats and ribs go, go for the ribs. With many different styles, whether it be Texas, Memphis or St. Louis, they will come in all shapes and sizes. Each will be accompanied with different sweet, savory and spicy sauces.  Each rib style is always going to be different in flavor , in consistency and in effort.  The bigger the rib, the more delicious work you have cut out for yourself. Falling right off the bone, this is some pretty darn good meat.  If you're not in the mood for ribs, there are plent of other options including bbq chicken, jerk pork, brisket, sausages and everything in between.  The great thing is that you have the option of picking 2 or 3 types of meats with some sides.  There are plenty of different combos that Red Bones offers.  Whether you do meat and sides, meat, just sides or just apps, everything is pretty good and pretty reasonbly priced for a bbq joint.  The staff is also really helpful and makes sure you get the best deal.  \\n\\nRed Bones offers plenty of sides, from slaw, to garlic mash, mac and cheese, collard greens and plenty more. The great thing of course, is that complimentary cornbread is comes before your meal, giving you the option of eating now, or have something to sopp up the lingering sauces. Its those kind of choices that are easy and truly reflect a really laid back bbq place.  That, or they just have a lot good cornbread to be had.  Any of the sides are great. Top recommendation? Mac and cheese. Warm and a staple in comfort food, it goes well with all the meat combos.\\n\\nAgain, Red Bones prides itself as a major hot spot in Davis Square that promises plenty of meat and plenty of options. Feeling overwhelmed is natural at a place like this, and thats exactly how it should be. There should be no shortage of good, satisfying food."},{"name":"Tibby's New Orleans Kitchen","address":"2203 Aloma Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"Service was a little slow, but it could be my mistake coming on Fat Tuesday, not a quick place for lunch today but it was super busy.

I've heard and read many reviews of Italian Kitchen from Yelp and wanted to try this place for a long time. However, to my surprise, this place did not go beyond my expectations. \\n\\nI wanted to make sure that there were still spots so I made reservations yesterday. When we arrived, we were directed to the second floor, not by the window but by a corner with a mirror. My bf and I sat on the inside by the mirror and found that it was not comfortable at all. It was uncomfortable and not very spacious. I actually felt claustrophobic so we decided to sit on the other side of the table and that didn't make a difference. Why? They were weaved chairs and weren't even comfortable either. Minus 1 star here.\\n\\nWhen my couple friends arrived, we chatted for a bit and finally got to ordering. We split the honey mussels (fennel sausage, lemon, pinot grigio) which were mediocre. The time between our honey mussels to our main meals was too long - it was about 45 minutes long. Minus one star here. I had the  Lobster Tagliatelle which consist of the fresh atlantic lobster, sweet peas and tomato mascarpone sauce while the bf had the Spaghetti with Spicy Kobe Meatballs. When my dish came, it looked very presentable. I'm a big fan of lobster and it was quite tasty. However, the Tagliatelle wasn't al dente. I understand that Tagliatelle has a rough texture but it felt like the pasta wasn't even cooked properly enough to have the sauce mix in with the pasta (if you know what I mean). When the food came, the pasta itself wasn't even hot. So it was eating cold and hard pasta...a turn off for me. Minus one star here. I was slowing eating or more so playing with my food. Without hesitation, my bf quickly told me to trade with his dish :) The spaghetti tasted so much better - soft and hot. Although I'm not a big fan of meatballs, they were pretty good since they had a bit of spice in them.

I've had chimichurri many times and it's usually a vibrant green flavor bomb.  Whatever they put on mine was the color of Kermit the Frog and tasted more like pickles than any chimichurri I've had.

When it was younger, Redbones had amazing food, reasonable prices, great beer selection and an ambiance that made you want to keep coming back with groups as frequent as possible.  \\n\\nNow with Redbones, the beer selection is still fresh and youthful.  The ambiance, much of the same, has aged liked fine wine but the menu is in need of a major overhaul.\\n\\nI use to come to Redbones with large groups 2-3 times/month and we'd load up on delicious ribs, sandwiches and beer.  These days we get together maybe 2 times a year at Redbones and just order a couple of mediocre sandwiches and a beer or two.  The restaurant needs to find its food identity again.  \\n\\nRecently I was told by a waitress that the food sales had gone down and Redbones had been working on improving their menu.  This conversation came up when I told the waitress that my brisket sandwich was the best I had in years and so I was curious if they changed their recipes.  After learning that they were changing their recipes, I had hope again that Redbones would return to glory.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I went back with a friend 2 weeks later telling him that the food had improved but instead the meal hit a new low.  The menu prices had now increased for the sandwich plates from $9.99-$12.99 and some of my favorite sides were no longer on the menu.  My brisket sandwich was dry and fatty, leaving me wondering if the amazing brisket sandwich I had a few weeks earlier was a figment of my imagination.  \\n\\nRedbones is creeping into the price range of fine dining.  I use to love going to Redbones for the beef ribs but now with the prices well over $20 and smaller portions these last few years, I just don't enjoy the ribs experience anymore.  It takes well over $30 to fill up on the Texas ribs and sides.  Redbones is missing the mark with myself and a lot of its previously loyal frequent customers.  We never came to Redbones for large group \\"hangout\\" meals at fine dinning prices. What we use to love about Redbones was the reasonable prices, great food, beer and company.  It's as if Redbones gained so much popularity that they stopped caring about their loyal frequent customers because they could charge and serve whatever they want to the long lines of people.\\n\\n@Redbones- As a former frequent customer,  if you ever want to bring me in for suggestions, taste tests, etc. I'd love to help you get your magic back."},{"name":"Blue Danube","address":"2439 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Truly defines the dive bar genre.

There are some novel food interpretations but the primary focus here seems to be wine and socialization. We were probably the only people not having some sort of alcoholic libation. But that was OK. The food was good but not overly impressive. I had the Turkey Train which had too much turkey on it but was flavorful if a bit greasy from the buttered toast. It was generally good though I had to eat it with a knife and fork so I didn't get the full experience of blending the flavors. Started dinner with the JamJar. Tasty but too costly for the amount provided. My wife had the Pastami. Who serves Pastrami on grilled bread? The meat was tender and not fatty at all but come on...Rye Bread only, Please! The cost of the meal was a bit on the high side for basicaly sandwiches but that is what you pay at Gastropubs (I think most Gastropubs are pretentious). The service was very good as it was attentive but not intrusive.  Final verdict - OK but not good enough for a return visit."},{"name":"Haroo Korean Homestyle Cuisine","address":"8580 Alexandra Road, Suite 2000","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"This is probably the best Korean restaurant I Greater Vancouver. \\nWhen the first time I went there, I found the place was super sweet.

And I can go all night in this bitch-ass review. The bouncer is a gentleman. He escorted me out after a bit of an over-reaction. People are ultra-ultra-ultra-isensitive. I guess it is the times we live in. The 90's were more loose, the 00's with Bush/Obama raged. I left without incidence. Places that play danceable music and there is no dancing are of concern, anxiety for masses or no-skills. I hold my own on the dance floor, I beast mode it on any floor in the bar arena. The beats were nice, and if nobody is dancing the DJ needs to adjust and steer up the intensity, like NAS Illmatic, Wu-tang 36-Chambers, Public Enemy, EPMD, Roxbury's own Gangstarr, Jay-Z, A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, Souls of Mischief, Fugees, Rhianna for the ladies. This isn't some second rate review. On Broadway I just invited to fight 5-punk-bitches from Teterboro NJ.

At no point did he come around our table to check up.

When my boyfriend brought it to the manager's attention, he did nothing.  Well, almost nothing.  Before the next question was announced, he noted again that cell phones were not allowed.\\n\\nTrivia at Hooters can be fun.  But it's not fun when cheating occurs and the staff turns the other cheek.

Before getting there, all I had to go on in terms of options was the menu placed fairly high and mostly out of view until I got closer to the counter. Well, that was a waste of time anyway. You order whatever they have ready and you won't know that until you get close.\\n\\nAfter the helpful gentleman behind the counter waved off my first two choices (one off the aforementioned menu, one based on the signs under the counter), I selected noodles with 'spicy' thai chicken and eggplant. During this interaction, he also pointed to a sign that said something about the lunch special. Not sure how that was relevant, it not being lunchtime.\\n\\nNext stop was paying. Another helpful but younger gentleman asked me what I ordered so he could ring me up. Rather than guess what he wanted me to say - noodles with meat & vegetable?, specifically what meat and vegetable? - I just pointed to the box he had in front of him and said 'whatever's in there'. He opened it and rang it up pronto. Why not do that in the first place?  The scene was a bit hectic (Dragon*Con) after all.\\n\\nSo, my impression is that they could use a little organization behind the counter. But no big deal, even if I really didn't get what I wanted.\\n\\nThe food: terrible. Chicken was tasteless, not a hint of spiciness and riddled with bad cuts. The eggplant was somehow even more tasteless than the chicken and cooked to the point of being almost a fluid. The noodles were also bland. Only liberal amounts of soy and sriracha made the whole meal palatable. I actually considered dumping it and getting something from another vendor, but I was on a schedule.\\n\\nMaybe I ordered the wrong items.\\n\\nI'd actually give this place another try, ordering something different.

It had a decent decor, very Texas-esque, and had nice comfy booths along one wall. There are also regular tables in the rest of the dining room.

Hub's only complaint was that there was too much bun for someone like himself, who is diabetic. All in all, an extremely filling affair!! The CC fries were so good that the ones without somewhat paled in comparison after being tasted, but I'm sure the fries are quite good even when not resting in a sea of yummy chili and cheese. ;) The chicken strips the kids had were some of the best I've had ever, from ANYWHERE!!!

I eat at Tibby's at least twice a month, sometimes more and I every time I leave even more impressed with the place then I was before.  The portions are HUGE...and the prices are definitely NOT huge which makes this place a great bargain. The fried pickles are seriously amazing, definitely my favorite appetizer.  The breading on them is not too thick and not crumbly (like a bread crumb texture), and the sauce they serve with it for dipping is a slightly spicy Cajun dip that compliments the pickles perfectly.  The Shrimp & Grits is by far the best dish on the menu...Shrimp in a red wine gravy sauce, laying on a pillow of their Andouille and Cheddar Grits.  If you like shrimp you must try this dish...it is so good and just like everything else, the portion is huge!  \\nAnother great bargain is their Po'boy sandwiches!  Get the side and half deal, half of a po'boy and one of their amazing sides, I recommend the Andouille & Cheddar Grits, they taste amazing. The half of po'boy is still a huge sandwich, I always end up taking half of it home! \\nThe ambiance is very loud, colorful and what I imagine New Orleans is like! Also, they have a great little room in the back for private parties, special dinners, etc.  We used it for my sisters bachelorette party dinner, we had about 20 guests, lots of food and drink (everyone on a separate check) and their staff handled it beautifully.  \\nOther reviews caution of their busy times, and they are right, Friday and Saturday nights (and anytime the Saints play) can be a very busy time, but I've never had to wait too long for a table (even at prime time on Friday and Saturday nights) because they move tables through quickly and efficiently.

With experience at Disneyland, Disney Cruise Line, and many trips to Disney World, bad meals have been very few and far between. We sacrificed two meals off our Disney deluxe dining plan to eat at Narcoosee's with a reservation at 9:20 to see the fireworks at the Magic Kingdom (supposedly a selling point of the restaurant's location). When we entered the restaurant, we were greeted by a cockroach on the floor. Nice.\\n\\nBut it's Florida and I'm willing to let it slide. We were seated ten minutes after our reservation time at a table that was far too close to the other two near us. The ambiance in the restaurant was nonexistent. I guess it was supposed to be boathouse themed but it resembled a cavernous, dark gazebo with a tackily lit bar that was far too close to the dining area (and it's patrons were decidedly obnoxious). We also had no view of the fireworks over the Seven Seas Lagoon (again, something I was willing to let slide as the restaurant was crowded. They told us to watch the fireworks from the deck of the restaurant, overlooking the water). \\n\\nIt seemed like a combination of inconveniences led up to ordering. I ordered the cheese platter as an appetizer, and the lobster as an entree. My mother ordered the mussels as an app, and the filet for dinner, and my father ordered the lobster bisque and surf and turf.\\n\\nThe appetizers were fine for the most part. The lobster bisque was the same that Disney serves at nearly all of their restaurants, and was quite good. My cheese plate was fine (then again, how much can you mess up a few cubes of cheese and accompaniments?) and my mother's mussels were generally good although there were a few that seemed to be past their prime (which is never good when it comes to shellfish).\\n\\nThe main courses came out at precisely the moment the fireworks started, which meant that we had the option of either letting our food get cold to watch the fireworks from the dock, or missing the fireworks (again, one of the selling points of the restaurant, and the reason we booked such a late dinner) and eating.\\n\\nI opted to watch the fireworks for a few minutes (until they were ruined by the drunken bar patrons from the same restaurant) and when I went inside to eat my lukewarm lobster I was frankly disgusted. Now it is understandable that the prices at Disney are generally quite inflated but for $70, I could have gone to Legal Sea Foods in Tyson's Corner, VA and had an absolutely wonderful lobster dinner, with money to spare. Instead I got a 2 pound monster that was tough and absolutely tasteless. I'm pretty sure I could have ordered a better lobster at Joe's Crab Shack...My father's lobster was undercooked and wouldn't come out of the shell (again, tasteless) and my parents' steaks were some industrial grade cut of meat that masqueraded as steak. I ate the claw meat from the lobster, and decided to call it a night without even bothering with dessert.\\n\\nI normally love Disney food and it's honestly quite hard for them to do wrong by me, but for the price, this place was absolutely god-awful and unacceptable. For the price it cost in the 2 meals from the dining plan, I could have gone to a number of far better restaurants without having to worry about the ridiculous tip at the end of our meal as well."},{"name":"Joey D's Oak Room","address":"1015 Crown Pointe Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Went with a large group for early dinner.

The atmosphere's great, and it's solid for take-out, but there's a phone order language barrier. Definitely worth a try if you're not looking for the cheapest sushi you can get.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLike the other reviewers, I was sad to see Ginga go. I live a block away, and they all knew me when I walked in the door. I'd watch them make my sushi, conversing with them about whatever we had in common - Boston sports, the restaurant business, raw fish, whatever.\\n\\nSo I was pretty surprised when, seemingly overnight, Ginga was gone and in its place stood U-Sushi (or Sushi U... I wasn't sure). Turns out, the owners decided to move back to their native Vietnam. So it took a few weeks, but I decided to give the new place a try.\\n\\nThe first thing you should know is that sushi in Brookline isn't cheap. To get any reasonable amount of food (some might say, \\"don't order sushi!\\"), you've got to spend 10-20% more than comparable food in the suburbs. \\n\\nThat said, U-Sushi is probably a bit pricier than the standards of Coolidge Corner (Fugakyu notwithstanding); I consider $6.50 for a spicy salmon roll to be overpriced, unless you're at Oiishi or Fugakyu or one of the other high-end places. Their lunch specials - like those of Ginga before - are a much better bargain, and are highly recommended. So for overall price, I give them 2*.\\n\\nThe atmosphere was lovely - much better seating, much nicer lighting, and just a better overall vibe. Dine-in gets a 5*. The new owners are very, very nice, and chatting with me the entire time I was waiting for my order - definitely did a great job winning me over. That said, as previous reviewers have mentioned, they're Chinese, and Cantonese is their first language - so expect a language barrier over the phone, and be patient. Once their online ordering system is in place - and I do hope that's soon, for their sake - you should consider using it rather than calling. Carry-out got a 5* experience (they offered me water or tea; I appreciated that fact, even though he brought me the one I didn't ask for), but I could imagine that delivery would be tougher because of the language issue. Call that a presumed 3* experience.\\n\\nNow, the food... that's a different story. The fish was very fresh and tasty - I love the buttery flavor that a good piece of salmon or white tuna sashimi has. The spicy salmon roll was kind of sloppy, and didn't have as much crunch to it as I remember, which was disappointing. I'm told that the sweet potato tempura roll was quite good, and the avocado was definitely delicious and ripe. 4* for the food, although if I'm being totally forthcoming, it's a low 4* because spicy salmon maki is my favorite - and theirs doesn't rank high on my list.\\n\\nIncidentally, the chefs are the same guys that were working at Ginga - no change there. The menu has changed a bit (mostly it got more expensive), but most of the items remain the same.\\n\\nSo add it all up, and we have 2*, 5*, 5*, 3*, 4* - that's 19 of a possibly 25 points, meaning they're a pretty solid 4*. I will return - but because price is something of which I'm cognizant, I may not return as often as I did before the changeover."},{"name":"Flying Saucer Pizza Company","address":"118 Washington St","city":"Salem","stars":"4","text":"Update #2 - After my delivery issues, I was contacted by both the business owner and the manager and my next delivery was comped and accurate.

The scallops were perfectly executed with an amazing punch of flavor & smooth textures: Scituate scallops with spelt flour spaetzle, caraway carrots & a sage froth.\\n\\nOur chicken was outstandingly original & memorable (as I'm salivating writing this): Smoked tea braised red broiler chicken with spaghetti squash & apples, roasted with guinea hog lardo, and an eggplant fritter.\\n\\nAt this point we were satiated, we figured we would just glance at the dessert menu & not order.

OK, the beautiful, friendly young waitress made it better, but seriously, this was a great experience.  The place is easy to miss coming from the north, being tucked in a tight little strip on a hill.  All signage is in English.  We were quickly greeted and shown to our clean, marble-topped table (semi-booth).  The interior is cozy, gently lit, attractive and relatively new, with panelling, laminated floor, and a few Asian prints on the wall.  Cloth napkins, real utensils and long oval app plates marked our places.  A very soothing atmosphere overall.  Our menus came to us turned to the first page, which features enticing media reviews.  Strangely (for Buford Highway), I saw no Asians eating the food.  \\n\\nI really have to say a few words about the staff because they were such a nice part of the experience.  We had two attractive young people serving us.  Their English was perfect, their friendliness was genuine and infectious without being intrusive, they were completely knowledgeable and helpful with the food choices, and they were attentive.  I honestly can't remember having a more enjoyable service, ever.\\n\\nDinner started with goi salad.  Pick your fruit and protein, or get the mixed fruit and pick your protein.  We had mango and grilled salmon.  Veggies were matchstick size, making chopsticks easier to use.  Salmon was in little bits, but a good amount to flavor without overwhelming.  The sweet and peppery fish sauce and crushed peanuts on top sealed the deal.  These salads are on the CL 100 Things to Eat Before You Die, and I can see why:  I could eat this stuff all day long.  And I'm not even a salmon lover. (or even a salad lover)\\n\\nFor appetizer, we split the duck in grapeleaves.  The grapeleaves had just enough bitterness to make it not invisible.  The duck meatballs were hearty and had a little more robust version of the fish sauce on it.  If you have a few extra bucks to drop, they definitely deserve a try.\\n\\nFor entrees, we split the pork bun (rice vermicelli and matchstick vegetables, with fish sauce) and the beef with fragrant rice (with assorted crispy vegetables and fish sauce).  The pork bun was a huge portion, but light.  The grilled and marinated meat had plenty of flavor and the dish was reminiscent of mu shu pork without all the oil and heaviness.  The beef had a deep, smoky richness from the marinade and grill.  It was slightly chewy, but in a way that made me feel well fed because it made it seem more substantial.\\n\\nWe were surprised by a complimentary desert of small, yummy mocha cakes.  Although it was little and light in an airy, marshmallow kind of way, the flavor was really present and I was able to slow down and savor a portion that I could otherwise eat in a single bite.  \\n\\nGetting food this good, service this good, prices this good (sometimes bordering on ridiculous) and an atmosphere this good, I could not give this place less than five stars.

When you go to a place like Vics and order brisket, expect the cut of meat to be whatever is next in line unless you specify a \\"moist\\" (fatty) or \\"dry\\" (lean) cut of meat. I see a lot of reviewers complaining about their cut of meat and not specifying which cut they ordered.\\n\\nWith that said, in the world of BBQ there are sauce people and there are meat people. Meat people prefer that their dishes be seasoned and edible prior to the sauce going on. I myself am a meat person. Vic's BBQ is a prime example of a BBQ restaurant that caters to meat people. They know how to cook their meat before any sauce even touches it. They have over 13 awards for pork ribs on the wall and deserve them. If you come here and don't get the pork ribs or pork steak on your first go around you are missing out. Better yet, get their two meat plate and try the ribs and chicken combined. \\n\\nTheir sausage is good but tends to be a bit on the greasy side. You definitely want to try their Sliced Brisket Sandwich on a bun (it typically comes on white bread unless you request a bun) instead of a sausage sandwich for an amazingly quick lunch. Their breakfast tacos are also excellent so if you are up early stop on by for a taco. \\n\\nThey also have tea because everyone knows it is actually AGAINST THE LAW in Texas to eat BBQ without sweet tea *hehe*.

The vermicelli noodles was thick, not the thin ones at Le's, which meant they were doughier and takes up less flavor.

Then for an entree I shared the Poulet \\"Coq au Vin\\" which was delicious as well and the sides served with it were very well rounded and delicious - the green beans and carrots were a very nice touch. They have amazing cappuccinos - tons of foam and cinnamon and brown sugar sprinkled on top. Then for dessert we of course had to have the chocolate souffl√©. The chocolate souffl√© was positively delicious (it was demolished as soon as I set my camera down) - and the homemade whipped cream served on top should be sold by the jar. Overall we had a wonderful experience here, from the quiet atmosphere to the perfect service and amazing food."},{"name":"Kekes Breakfast Cafe","address":"1005 Spring Villas Point","city":"Winter Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"Another visit to Kekes with our family from out of town.

While we arrived 30 minutes before our reservation time and checked in, but still had to wait an additional 30 minutes past our scheduled time to finally sit down. Our waitress was very nice and took our orders fairly quickly after we sat down. The drinks were mediocre at best. It was clear they had been sitting on the bar for a while and was extremely watered down.  Our appetizer salad was OK, but nothing spectacular. We also had to ask for napkins since they never gave us any at all. Then there was the wait for the main course... we drank the two bottles of wine we ordered when we got in, and the water, and waited some more (over an hour wait after the appetizer).  Now waterless and wineless, the New Year arrived, and a minute later the entire dining room we were sitting in all of a sudden started getting served. After the long wait and considering the prices, I expected a great meal. But I was sorely disappointed. My ciopino was ice cold and quite honestly, not very flavorful. At this point I was so tired of waiting that I had lost my appetite and did not feel like waiting even more for them to fix me another dish. Plus, I could see the kitchen was already closed and all they would do would be to microwave the same dish and serve me overcooked seafood. I just returned my meal and told them not to even bother bringing anything else. At this point the manager came out to apologize, which I appreciated and we FINALLY got the napkins we asked for almost 2 hours ealier. The rest of the dishes around the table looked just like you would expect from an amusement park restaurant. Totally ordinary and overpriced. The best tasting (if you overlook the fact that it was also extremely cold) and best looking dish were the scallops. However, they are definitely not worth the price.  \\n\\nOverall, our experience was terrible. The table ate the cold dinner dinner without anything to drink or napkins. While the manager ended up waiving the entire check in the hopes we would give them an other chance, based on how negative our experience was, I doubt I ever will.  You only have one chance to make a good first impression and unfortunately, this was a really awful one."},{"name":"Luke's Lobster Back Bay","address":"75 Exeter Street","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Luke's lobster has great lobster rolls with good size and reasonable price (considering its location in the heart of back bay).

So yeah, it was SO good that I came back for dinner that night. However, by the time we came I wasn't overly hungry, so I opted to go for one of their salads. Well, the salad was also simply delicious, I don't remember the name of it, but I do remember that it had a nice mix of lettuce, diced cukes and tomatoes, roasted corn, edamame, deliciously roasted chicken, maple glazed bacon house made honey mustard, shaved gouda cheese and it may (or may not) have had onions.

Well, not completely.  \\n\\nWe chose Portland City Grill to celebrate our first anniversary (early on a Sunday for dinner; no happy hour).  Since we were pretty early (just before five), we had no problem getting a window seat.  Our friendly, enthusiastic waiter was there almost immediately to introduce the menu and wine list and welcome us.  My husband picked out a bottle of wine for us to start, and he returned from the cellar with it and another bottle that hadn't been placed on the list yet.  Similar to what we'd picked, but was one of his personal favorites, if we wanted to try it.  We took the gamble and it paid off- a bright and light Pinot just perfect for summer's curtain call!  \\n\\nWe ordered the Dungeoness Crab Cakes and Kung Pao Calamari as appetizers.  Both were excellent, but the Kung Pao Calamari was definitely the most surprising and creative of the two.  A subtly spicy, vibrant sauce lightly tossed with crisp (not dry) calamari and veggies.  My husband didn't care for the crab cakes because they weren't crispy, fried and cakey enough (like a little patty).  I liked the softer version myself, I thought it was more complimentary to the crab.  But hey, if you're a krabby patty fan, you might be disappointed here.\\n\\nI had the Hunan Rack of Lamb for my entree, which was good but a little heavy on the hoisin-style sauce.  It was very good and well-cooked, but I was hoping for something not quite so heavy on the Asian in Pan-Asian.  Luckily, I was able to snag some bites of my husband's aged Oscar-Style Steak, which was like a gift from some divine bovine goddess watching over us.  Steak was like butter, the sauce was just bright enough to cut it... perfection.\\n\\nAs we were both about to roll out of the place in wheelbarrows, our waiter brought us a complimentary Asian Pear and Fuji Apple Bread Pudding with Caramel Bourbon Sauce for our anniversary, with a little birthday candle glowing at the top.  Dear Media.  Stop coming to Portland to glorify Voodoo Donuts and Come Eat This Now!  I was way too full to move, but it was too good to miss.  The sauce, the fruit, the warm and cool contrasts.  Heaven!!\\n\\nOur waiter was by frequently to make sure we were happy, and really made us feel special.  He was funny, helpful and genuine, and made this fine dining experience we only pay for on special occasions truly worth it.

It was fun to compare the taste and texture and kind of experiment with what I liked and didn't like. \\n\\nClam chowder - I personally prefer clam chowder that is more thick and creamy but the way they prepare it here is more on the watery side.

I liked that they didn't over fry the clams. It came with housemade cole slaw which was very different from what I've had in the past. It was really refreshing. \\n\\nLobster roll - I mean it was good but honestly it did not blow me away....It had a lot of meat and it was definitely enough to share with two people but I honestly expected a lot more....maybe it was just hyped up too much or something but it really wasn't that amazing.\\n \\nNorth End Cioppino - I thought this dish was good but again it wasn't amazing like so many have claimed....I mean the broth was flavorful and seafood all tasted very fresh and delicious but I've definitely had better similar type of dish in the past......\\n\\nMy overall feeling at the end of the night was that this place was good.

Just wish it wasn't so small - usually Korean banchan come free, and this reminded me of a tastier version of a banchan side dish. The kimchi tasted mostly authentic and the octopus was tender and bite size, like any usual banchan. \\nTuna Tataki - your standard tuna tataki, but the rub on the tuna was addicting. As usual, it just left me wanting more. \\nBelgian Style Frites - there wasn't much to them, but I just couldn't stop. \\n\\nI wasn't too interested in the cocktail list - they need a more balanced variety for those averse to bourbons and whiskeys (like me). \\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed the dishes I ordered at The Sound Table. It's definitely a little pricey for what it is, but I can't deny that what I ate was tasty!

At Everybody's I just order the Organic Mixed Field Greens and Roma Tomato Salad!  It is SOOOO tasty and perfect!  I get the Everybody's Herb dressing and mix it up before pouring it on the salad.  They have some great chicken that you can get added on as well.  They do NOT do croutons.\\n\\nTip: If you think the salad is going to be TOO big for you then take out some and put it on the plate and add the dressing there.  You don't want to have dressing on the whole thing and try and take it with you!  \\n\\nWhen I don't get a salad I get the individual sized Everybody's pizza.

I know it sounds silly but this added bit of ambiance brought something interesting to the experience.  The food was good but nothing mind blowing - which is why the price tag hurt so much.  Luckily the volume of food helped defray the cost slightly.  I had delicious tandoori salmon, my hubby had spicy chicken vindaloo and we split a saag paneer.  The naan was soft and tasty  (though not complementary with dinner as it apparently is with lunch) however a big bowl of basamati rice did come with the meal.  The mango lassis were par for course.   We had no issues with our groupon (we brought a hard copy) and unlike other reviewers, our service was fantastic, attentive and fast.   Still for the above listed food (no alcohol, appetizers or dessert) the pricetag ($46 *after* you subtracted the $40 groupon!!!) made that a one time trip for us.   One last weird item of note - the bathrooms.  The stall doors are one way mirrors so when you take a seat, it feels like anyone who walks in front of the door will have a nicely framed image of you doing your business.  And according to my hubby,  the men's room sinks were full of ice and smelled like urine which are two things you don't want to encounter in the bathroom.

The chicken fried Trout was another knockout, it was so crispy and while it seemed like a lot of herbs and garnish, it ended up being perfect for each bite. They serve it with sweet butter lettuce so you can make lettuce bites out of it. The dessert was easily the most unique I have ever tried, a concoction of madeleine cake, corn ice cream?! and blueberries with basil.

This was the most comical excuse of a milkshake I've ever received. I literally thought we were all being \\"PUNKED\\" on some reality TV show and was waiting for some guy to jump out of the closet half naked with a contract and waiver for us ready to sign so we can be on newest show \\"THINK YOUR FOOD SUCKS, JUST WAIT!\\" lol\\n\\nTo get back to the story, the manager didn't call me back. When I called back, I asked the gentlemen why the manager didn't call me back and he said it's because the milk was \\"low fat\\". I said \\"There was no ice cream, toppings or substance in this\\". He said \\" Yes, low fat.\\" I asked to speak to the manager and he tried saying the same thing and said something about water in the shakes and I asked for a refund at that point. He said No. I said bring me 4 milkshakes that we paid $7 for after tax and tip, he said \\"No, I'll bring you 2.\\" I said \\"No, 4\\" and he said \\"No\\" and I settled at 2. \\n\\nThey came and none had toppings or flavor and were milk and some frozen milk on top. No ice cream, no low fat yogurt, no toppings, literally watered down milk with some frozen milk on top.\\n\\nI don't know how this place is still in business with this lack of care going into their products and absolutely horrible customer service.\\n\\nDON'T EVER ORDER FROM HERE - TRY ANY OTHER OPTION TO SAVE YOURSELF!

The charbroiled oysters took forever to come out but the restaurant compensated by friend by giving her a free bread pudding dessert at the end which was delicious! \\n\\nService was pretty slow when we went. And not to be nitpicky, but at the end of dinner our server gave us a single check for the entire group.\\n\\nConsidering how it was a birthday dinner with 8 people, I would have assumed he would ask first how everyone was going to pay and/or split all the checks automatically. We ended up telling him to split all the checks which was additional time wasted. \\n\\nOh btw, if you use the women's restroom, they have a mouthwash dispenser in the center. Soap dispensers are on the sides. I made the mistake of pumping out a mouthwash cup but another lady kept pumping out mouthwash because we didn't pay attention.

Yes. \\n\\nWas it good? not bad, but nothing amazing. \\n\\nWas it worth the long wait time and service we received? NO.\\n\\nThis is my second time, but my BF's first time here. \\n\\nMy first visit last year, my friend and I were lucky and were told it would be a 45 minute wait but they ended up calling us within 15 minutes. We sat at the bar and were waited on by the bar waitresses. Honestly, the warm lobster roll was just ok. And the service from the bar waitresses wasnt great. They seemed like they didn't have to tend to anyone cause this place is so popular and they gave the bare minimum. They looked mean and made me uncomfortable and not want to ask them for anything. We luckily were seated next to an older couple and chatted with them which made our lunch more pleasant. But overall it was just meh.\\n\\nNow this week. I went with my bf as we are in town and we had already gone to B&G oysters for raw bar and lobster rolls earlier in the week. I thought, let's just give it a try. We put our name on the list for dinner and went to Crudo across the street for drinks and apps, and walked around the north end till kill time for our over 2 HOUR WAIT. We get back and our waitress was very friendly and nice. We order a big raw bar order (9 oysters 6 clams and 4 crab claws), chowder and for entrees, the scallops and cioppino with lobster. The waitress specially asks us if we wanted our entrees AFTER the rawbar, we said \\"yes pls!\\", as we didn't want or entrees to get cold or have to rush through our raw bar order. \\n\\nLiterally minutes after receiving our raw bar, our entrees come being served by the bar waitress. I told her \\"sorry, we weren't supposed to get it until after our raw bar, the waitress specially asked us.\\" Her response WITH attitude, \\"well either you want them here at your table or they will just go back into the kitchen to sit, the kitchen is closed and they aren't going to remake it for you.\\" So I felt like I had no choice but to accept it....our original waitress came by after the b*tchy bar waitress told her. She was very apologetic and very nice. She offered to take my BF's wine off our bill, but we told her it was ok. However my bf no longer wanted his scallops because majority of the raw bar order was his and he would need some time to get through it...but I kept my cioppino with lobster. \\n\\nBy the time my bf finished the raw bar, I couldn't eat any more of my cioppino. It did taste very fresh but the broth was underwhelming. If we kept the scallops, they would definitely have been very cold by the time he got to them. \\n\\nWhen we got our bill, the waitress of course didn't charge us for the scallops we sent back but she still took the glass of wine off. That was nice of her.\\n\\nHowever, that bar waitress needs to lighten up a little bit especially when people like us will drop about $150-200 easily for a good meal. Pretty sure she is the same bar waitress when I was there in August 2016. \\n\\nHonestly, if you want good lobster rolls and raw bar with no wait, and less attitude, go to B&G oyster."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Really really good!

We haven't been back in a year because we had horrible service several times last fall.  So today we decided to try it again, hoping that the kinks have been worked out.  Well guess what, they aren't.  Let's start\\n1 - We are a party of two.  there are only four tables being used in this restaurant when we get there. so there is plenty of empty space.  Great.  What does the hostess do. she puts us a a small two top right beside a group of six.  the whole time we are there they are talking over each other and we can't hear ourselves.  I have gladly taken a small two top when a restaurant is full and that is what you do.  It's a busy time and you make smart choices when seating guests.  This was not busy the other three tables were all parties of two at a four tops and spread out through the restaurant.  Not sure why we were different.\\n2 - Our waitress comes over and asks us if we want anything to drink.  We both order coffee. She then tells us that they have ice coffee available if we would prefer that instead.  My husband said yes make mine and ice coffee.  What do we get two hot coffees.  It was her suggestion and she still didn't get it right.  She brought him over an ice coffee after I said something, but the milk container that was brought over is small and could only provide milk for two coffees now we have to wait for her to come back and ask for more milk. Also she never  brought us spoons to stir our coffee with until we asked and got soup spoons.\\n3 - We order our meals.  My husband selected the country breakfast off of the menu.  Eggs, Sausage and biscuits with Gravy, per the description on the menu.  Our Waitress asks him what kind of toast he wants with that?  He was a bit confused and pointed out that the description mentions biscuits why would he get toast.  She looks confused and replied \\"we don't use biscuits here we use toast, at least today, but I will double check\\"  Yes makes not move to go find out, instead looks at me for my order. So then I look at my husband and question whether he would still want the same breakfast with gravy without the biscuits.  and he said no probably not so I looked at her and asked her to go find out.  Sure enough she comes back and states \\"they're telling me that yes we have biscuits\\".  Clearly she doesn't know the menu.  I then ask for Ham and cheese Scramble, again straight from the menu.  Nothing is customized and she asked me how I want my eggs.  I said scrambled that is how they are supposed to be based on your menu.  after she walks away she then comes back (not right away) to reconfirm what i wanted for a potato. \\n4 - we are sitting trying to relax and the noise behind is is horrible. the restaurant starts to get a bit busier (two more tables by the window now have guests, no where near us, we were banished to the back near the group of six ladies) a gentleman comes over and sits at the bar, clearly a regular as waitstaff goes over to greet him.  This would be fine if they weren't screaming across the restaurant from behind us to ask him questions.  Walk over to him and quietly talk to him.  Other general observations is that there were too many staff / serves on hand, they were just standing around and talking. At one point i noticed that there were four people talking to the two that are normally at the hostess stand.  so six people standing in the doorway talking.\\n5 - the food comes out (very quickly, which could be a positive).  the food is horrible.  the sausage and biscuits have absolutely no flavor.  My ham and cheese scramble consists of scrambled eggs with ham mixed in and then two slices of cheese propped on top, un-melted cheese.  The toast that came with my breakfast was stale and dry.  Just an overall horrible meal experience.  Mind you my husband right after we had ordered our food asked me if I wanted to cancel it and leave, i said no thinking that the food would salvage the experience and at least we would have a good meal.  I was wrong.\\n6 - can it get any worse?  well my husband got to a point where he was ready to leave and I told him to go out and i would pay the bill and meet him outside.  as he is getting up and making his way to the front three young gentleman come in that the bartender knows and she races around the bar to greet them practically knocking over another customer (the un-professionalism is what bothers me the most).  then she is talking to the patron that i mentioned earlier at the bar and he is telling her a story and she tells him to stop and screams out for Jania throughout the restaurant because she wants her to hear this story.  this happened several times before I left.  Jania never came over so it very well could be happening still.  \\n\\nOverall I will never go back.  the experience was un-professional the food was horrible. Not worth my money and time. I can cut a server a break when they are new but really she wasn't paying attention and forgetting things left and right."},{"name":"The Beignet Connection","address":"349 Decatur St SE, Bldg 1, Ste C","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Great food, (Pan Perdu is a must have) friendly staff.

Good burger, but my time is too valuable (to me) to spend hours waiting for a decent burger."},{"name":"Yakitori Jinbei","address":"2421 Cobb Pkwy SE","city":"Smyrna","stars":"4","text":"After a rocky introduction years ago (see my previous reviews below), Yakitori Jinbei is now holding steady at 4 stars for me.  Perhaps it's because Chef Kondo, formerly of Sushi-Huku and Hayakawa, works here now.  Thanks to Jang C's UYE and the 13 generous Yelpers last night (http://www.yelp.com/events/smyrna-cobb-county-dinner-at-yakitori-jinbei-part-2), I got to try several new things on the menu (new to me).  This makes my 4th review/update for Yakitori Jinbei all the more worthwhile.\\n\\nItems I sampled last night include:\\n\\nSpecials:\\nSimmered beef tripe with vegetables\\nSauteed clam with butter\\n\\nYakitori (Japanese skewered meat):\\nFresh young chicken\\nMeatballs\\nChicken wings\\nChicken with negima (Japanese jalapeno)\\n\\nSushi:\\nKondo-san box (special)\\n\\nIkura (salmon roe) over minced daikon radish\\nOkonomiyaki - Japanese pancake\\n\\nThe simmered beef tripe (stomach) with vegetables is a special that can be purchased in small (~$5) or large size (~$13).  The tripe was served in a stew with veggies such as cabbage, carrots, daikon, and potatoes, topped with Korean kimchi.  As is the nature with most tripe dishes, the stew had a unique aroma to it which some people may find unpleasant if they're not accustomed to it.  The broth had a grainy texture.  The tripe itself was excellent - soft and tender with good flavor.\\n\\nThe sauteed clam with butter (~$8) was another great dish.  The clams were served de-shelled on a bed of lettuce.  The clam meat was appropriately buttered and seasoned and sauteed with sliced onion.  Fresh and delicious.\\n\\nDespite all my visits here, usually to order ramen, I never tried Jinbei's yakitori until last night.  You can get the yakitori salted or with sauce.  Jang recommends with sauce, so that's what I went with.  All of the yakitori was good, from the fresh young chicken to the chicken wings.  My favorite is the meatball yakitori.\\n\\nNegima is akin to Japanese jalapeno, but not as spicy.  It's grilled on the skewer, just like the meat.  I Googled \\"negima\\" to verify its spelling, but only came across Japanese anime school girls in the process.  That would be like a Japanese person Googling \\"red hot chili peppers\\" and only getting search results of the band.\\n\\nThe Kondo-san box is, as the name implies, a Chef Kondo original creation.  This is box-style sushi in that it's pressed in \\"box\\" form and not rolled.  The Kondo-san box contains a variety of fish, shrimp, crispy tempura batter, and a bit of green tobiko.  If you like sushi rolls, definitely give it a try.\\n\\nThe ikura was terrific.  Kevin C. ordered his in nigiri form, where pinches of wasabi were placed on top.  This method is a polemic against how most nigiri is prepared in the U.S. (no wasabi at all).  It goes to show how authentic to Japan Yakitori Jinbei can be.\\n\\nFinally, the okonomikayki is like Japan's version of the pancake/omelette.  One order is pretty filling for one, so this dish can be easily shared.  The pancake is filled with egg, onion, and a variety of other ingredients, topped with mayonnaise and a sweet brown sauce, scallion, and minced red pepper.  It's good, though I found some bites to be extremely salty.  Actually, a lot of the foods at Yakitori Jinbei are on the salty side, so you will be sipping on a lot of water while you're here.\\n\\nService was great and despite our large group, the orders came out in a reasonable amount of time.  Our main server was pro-active in separating our checks, so there was no confusion with payment at the end.  One of our servers wasn't even supposed to be working last night, but helped out anyway because there were so many people."},{"name":"Redbones BBQ","address":"55 Chester St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"My friends and I are well-acquainted with this place - we funneled thousands of dollars to 'bones over our four years as undergrads.  And yet I can't give our go-to night out a better rating.  I'll try to keep the Chronicle of Redbones brief.\\n\\nFirst, the service is atrocious ~25% of the time.  It depends on the server/bartender and the night of course, but we've been speechless at the level of rudeness and confusion on the part of the waitstaff.  On our very first trip, the server grabbed my plate of ribs to pack up as I was eating it - I literally had a rib in my hands.  Another time we got yelled at for sitting down, after another server had told us to take any seat.  But the management was apologetic the one time I complained, and the incidents give us something to laugh about later (/to write about on yelp).  Most nights went smoothly in any case.\\n\\nThe food situation is slightly better.  The corn fritters are epic, but the meat not so much.  Blue Ribbon (Arlington) has much better ribs IMO.  Avoid the babyback rib special: a $10 half-rack is too good to be true, and I'm pretty sure they're just yesterday's bones.  The nachos are so-so and could be bigger - we always went to Sunset Bar in Allston in for severe nacho cravings.  Still, the menu has a great selection and wide range of prices, even for dinner.\\n\\nWhy even 3 stars?  Bones redeems itself by being the best beer bar in Davis.  The upstairs and downstairs bars are roomy and clean most nights, it's not full of bros, the selection is great, and the prices are low.  Compare to Sligo, Foundry, JTree, Orleans...none has all this except Bones.  I got St. Bernardus 12 on tap here, and at the very least they had a unique brew every time we went.  At $2.62, PBR is only 37 cents more than in Sligo.\\n\\nSo my love/hate relationship with bones drags on, but I keep going back for a good time.  We even went for my last night out before moving away from Boston...where the waitress proceeded to give annoyed glances when we weren't all ordering entrees.  That's 'bones I guess."},{"name":"Gaslight Lynnfield","address":"1100 Market St","city":"Lynnfield","stars":"3.5","text":"Had a gift card to this place and was looking forward to trying it out at their recently opened Lynnfield location.

Her scallops were delicious served with a pest mashed potato and mushrooms with a nice sauce. but my short rib fell a little flat. It was a small cut with the bone in, served on a bed of plain white rice with a side of spicy bok Choy. The beef was dry and the rice bland, and there was no sauce or gravy.  The bok choy was the best thing on the plate.  Desert was good. I had the chocolate cake which was a little dry, but the ganache filling & ice cream helped.

I despise going into Portland because I do not like traffic.  However, he loves many of the restaurants there.  I'm not into \\"pretty food\\" so much...he is.  So this was truly a gift of the heart :)\\n\\nOur appetizers were steak tartar and marrow and olives.  Of the three, we preferred the olives best, but hubby did like the marrow.  He mentioned the sauce should be on the side, not on the marrow.  The tartar was not impressive--it was covered in too much mousse or whatever...to taste the meat.  This lead me to believe that the meat was probably not so great, so it was being hidden purposefully.  \\n\\nThen came the salads, after quite a long wait...hubby had the salad previously mentioned with the egg and sausage.  The sausage was so bad that I had to go to the restroom and rid myself of it.  Even hubby said not kind things about it.  The egg was interesting...and was actually a highlight of the meal.  The dressing on his was great.  Mine was greens and well, greens.  A bare sprinkling of cheese, not even enough to taste, and if there was dressing, it wasn't much and the greens were bitter.\\n\\nOur dinner choices were the duck and the striploin.  I asked for rare and indicated \\"very rare, cold in the center.\\"  It was medium.  Fortunately, though, they made up for this by serving the duck rare, which was not how it was to be served.  The meat had good flavor, would have been better rare, however.  The potato side dish is nothing special, but the onions in it were good.\\n\\nNow, the true shining moment of the meal--the desserts.   I had the pot de creme, and hubby had the French 75 (lemon cake).  I am going to have that French 75 in my mind every time I have a dessert.  It was wonderful.  The best thing on the menu, we both agreed.\\n\\nThe place is not TERRIBLE, but the service was slow, (three hours to finish) and the food not so amazing as to demand the prices that they get.

For small dinners, when I'm not terribly hungry, I usually get an appetizer and salad. The salads are not very typical, and they use more fillers than expected. I think most people expect a monster salad with lots of leaves and only small portions of beans or something. Expect the opposite at this place - it's not a bad thing. The pizzas are my favorite. The eggplant parm was unexpectedly amazing. They layered fried and oven baked eggplant together. It's not like a chain restaurant where they load it up with lots of sauce, so it's even better. \\n\\nDrinks: I've been on a Prosecco kick lately, so Skinny Bellinis have been my go-to.

But that wasn't even the worst part. I left an accurate and very detailed review on FB. Three days later, the Paddlefish FB page reached out to me to say they were sorry to hear of my bad experience, and asked me to email them my address. I promptly emailed the address given, with my address. One month later the general manager, Jimmy, emailed me back. A month later. How is that good customer service; that you ask someone to email you, and then take weeks to get back to them?  I was told they would be sending me a gift card, and they would like for me to give them a chance again. I figured why not. Maybe, just maybe, it was a bad day. Maybe they were still working their kinks out. Three months later, no gift card. It seems the reply on the FB was to save face in a public forum, and the clear lack of urgency in the GM's reply, and no follow up - was just hot air. But despite this, I went back last night with friends who wanted to go while we were at Disney Springs.

Seriously- much  anticipated. For four out of our five, the Lincoln Burger was none other than the epitome of burger craftsmanship. We talked about it days leading up and the whole walk to our local South Boston hotspot. We discussed the weight of it in your hand, the satisfying umami of Lincolns proprietary patty saturating even the loneliest of taste buds. Suffice it to say, we were experienced and dedicated Lincoln patrons looking forward to our old culinary faithful.\\n\\nOnce we were seated, our waitress seemed to drag a bjt. Odd, we thought, it doesn't usually take 10 minutes to get drinks. Finally she came over and took our orders (we were all having Cokes), and disappeared once again. Our menus were closed at this point (like I said, we knew what was up, and wanted that burger). After another 5 minutes our sodas were provided and our orders taken. Five burgers. It seemed as if this may have been a slam dunk for our waitress in the way that the Seahawks thought a one yard pass at the goal line might have been. She didn't return until the food was delivered, cringed when we asked her to refill our drinks, and then didn't return while we were eating for any follow up.\\n\\nNow for the main event. We finally had our delectable meat parties center stage and showtime was imminent. I raised the cow sambo to my mouth and sunk my teeth into- bread. What the hell happened? We looked at each other like we were all the dude Dick Cheney shot in the face. surprised to say the least, it was clear that they had either put forth a meager effort into the table that ordered all burgers and no alcohol, or they had made am executive decision to decrease the weight of their burgers.

Unlike many places though, the food here is as good during the day as it is \\"late night\\". It is, however, a prime spot for late night food and that is typically when it is most crowded.\\n\\nMy favorite is their \\"Especial\\" which is 5 small Al Pastor Tacos (with feta, chopped avocado, and chunks of pineapple) for $5 or $6.  Seriously, they chop the fresh avocado and pineapple as they make your order. One plate is all you need to be quite full and it blows the New York Times-hyped Guero's tacos up the street out of the sky.  It is the single best taco I've had in Austin and that includes the exotics at Torchy's (although a few of those are pretty decent).\\n\\nRun, don't walk, and try this place now.

Our waters were refilled only once during the hour we were there and it took about 30 minutes to get our food. We weren't in a rush...so it didn't hurt our afternoon.

However, in terms of atmosphere, I simply can't go so far as many of the other reviewers who have described this place as \\"upscale\\". Yes, it's definitely a marked upgrade from the plethora of dilapidated pho shacks nearby, but unsuspecting first time diners shouldn't come here expecting to dine in the lap of luxury - linen napkins and a health inspection score above 80 shouldn't be the determining factors for considering a place upscale.\\n\\nFood: Co'm sets itself apart from its competitors by serving an assortment of rice dishes and wraps in addition to the standard pho and banh mi dishes that you'll find elsewhere. During my recent lunchtime visit, I opted for the \\"shaking chicken lemongrass\\", which was essentially stir fried lemongrass-flavored chicken served over a bed of rice. The dish was  flavorful, sizably portioned, and cleanly presented. I dined with a party of seven other individuals, all of whom seemed pleased with their dishes as well.  \\n\\nService: Attentive, accommodating, and quick. There was a several minute delay in delivering two of the dishes, but it was the peak lunch hour and we had a party of eight, so I suppose this was to be expected.  \\n\\nAtmosphere: The interior of Co'm is not very expansive - there are approximately a dozen booths and tables. The walls are lined almost exclusively with a series of portraits featuring the same stoic looking Asian females in various positions - one can only presume that the owner is a fan of the ladies. No outside seating is available. \\n\\nCost: Inexpensive for the quality and quantity of the food. Appetizers are mostly $3-$6, while entrees are $7-$15. All major credit cards are accepted.\\n\\nOther: Co'm is located in the same plaza as Lee's Bakery, at the intersection of Clairmont Road and Buford Highway. Hours of operation are Monday-Saturday, 11AM-10PM, and Sunday, 11AM-9PM.

The sandwich was so big I couldn't even open my mouth wide enough to bite it! I had to eat it in sections by starting with the meat that I dipped in spicy yellow mustard that they were kind enough to provide in the bag! It was so big I could only eat a 1/3 of it and took the rest home! It was fresh and hot! Included was a plastic bagged pickle, chips and a cookie! Even the chips were on point!

We actually tried to come here a couple weeks ago, but it was a friday night and the wait was 45 min, so we ended up going elsewhere. Needless to say, this only has made me want to go to La Casita more. Tonight, it was really low key and quiet, and there was a good amount of patrons enjoying an early Sunday dinner before the week starts up again. \\n\\nThe service was excellent - very prompt and attentive and not at all overbearing. I always get all gooshy inside because the boy speaks Spanish to the waiters (and I speak not one word - well, okay, I know the word \\"mamacita\\" - of Spanish) and finds the most delicious things for this French girl to eat. NOM. \\n\\nTonight, I had a chicken burrito and the boy had this amazing plate of grilled shrimp, steak, and chorizo - both of which we shared with each other. The burrito was probably the best I've had in Columbus; it was enormous, and I couldn't finish it all, but it was extremely well flavored and the chicken was juicy, and it came with a side of sour cream, guacamole, lettuce, onions, and tomato. The shrimp/steak/chorizo plate (sorry, I don't remember the name!) was excellent, and came with rice and refried beans, and was also too much to finish. We also ordered a side of grilled cactus (the Spanish word for which escapes me), which was very good - I'd never tried this before, and on it's own, I found it too salty, but mixed in with my burrito it was excellent. \\n\\nWhat I really liked about La Casita is that not only is it completely unpretentious, but it is not a hole in the wall, either. I agree with the reviewer that said it's family friendly, but not in the \\"tons of screaming kids\\" type of way - it's just comfortable, casual, and most of all, comforting.

Let's sum up the night:\\n\\nEven WITH reservations, we waited an extra 45 minutes. We had a \\"larger\\" group, about 8 of us, and it was Friday, so that could be why we waited, what felt like forever.\\n\\nThe decor is great. Fun and colorful New Orleans art stuff all over!\\n\\nThe drinks were good. About $6 for the mix drink specials menu, good amount of choices. I chose to just order a Magic Hat beer, which cost about the same, but served in an obnoxiously large chalice that I will bet you contains ZERO extra ounces of suds.  I think it is to trick you into thinking that you are getting more beer than normal. But it just lead to an impromptu work out for my arm to drink. If we didn't wait outside so long I wouldn't have minded carrying an extra 15 pounds around, but since I had no table to set it down on, this sucked. On a plus, the bloody mary was pretty tasty.\\n\\nThe apps we had were good, nothing stellar. Tasty onion rings, fried pickles standard and tasty also.  I read so many reviews about the po' boy's that I should follow suit.  I realize some people like fried seafood. Some don't. Some like a taste of the sea. And some like the taste of grease and oil with no fresh flavors.  I'm only SLIGHTLY hating on people  that like everything fried.  I do not. I LOVE OYSTERS. One of my favorite weird foods of the world. I got the oyster po boy. Bread was fresh as others say, but besides that,.....lets just say I'll never eat a po boy again. It was so bland, fried tasting, and NO ADDI TONAL SAUCE to add flavor!  Only Mayo!  boooooo hiisssssss.  Another person in our party said the cajun shrimp pasta was super salty.  GF got the muffeletta, really was kinda weak.\\n\\nBUT, my friends, there is a reason for you to check out Tibby's! Aside from the fun atmosphere, and decent drinks, there is one entree that was amazing.

My food was good, but I did not swoon dead away from food ecstasy. Pine State Biscuits is exactly as advertised. It is plain, hearty fare. That kind of food definitely has its place, but I am a little mystified as to why Portlanders have elevated PSB to legendary status.\\n\\nIt was my first time there. On overhearing the people behind us in line talking, I took a recommendation for \\"The Reggie\\". The Reggie comes with fried chicken, cheese and bacon on a biscuit, with gravy. The gentleman recommending it said he usually takes away the cheese and adds fried green tomatoes. I think he has the right idea. The problem with the Reggie is it's a sandwich with five different elements in it that all come from similar flavor and texture profiles. Everything is soft, fatty, gooey and salty. I found I was longing for a bright flavor and/ or crisp texture to break up the monotony of sensations. The fried tomatoes would have offered that, and the loss of the cheese would go completely unnoticed. I very much enjoyed the side of stewed apples, which were, I think, the perfect texture and level of sweetness.\\n\\nMy companion had the \\"Wedgie\\" sandwich, which had fried chicken, fried green tomatoes and a wedge of iceberg lettuce. That sandwich offered a broader range of flavors and textures in the one sandwich, and she enjoyed it.  \\n\\nAll in all, PSB was just fine for breakfast. I will order something different the next time I go. My food was fine, just missed the mark for what I was hoping for. It is good quality food, hearty, and no fuss. I don't think it deserves all the hype, but for the price and the quality is a solid option."},{"name":"Luke's Lobster Back Bay","address":"75 Exeter Street","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I tried the crab roll!

I asked Jason if we could order our meals and also get our To go order that would be using a groupon to pay for for. He told us that was fine , he would just have to separate the checks. At that point we ordered sausage hash browns and pancakes , the hulk, French toast, and a veggie omelette all for dine in. When I placed my carry out order I ordered shrimp and grits with extra shrimp so I could get the most value out of my groupon. We received our dine in food and it was great. When Jason bought our the shrimp and grits I noticed only a few pieces of shrimp in the bowl which was disappointing , after ordering \\"extra shrimp\\" I tasted the Dish and honestly I didn't like it at all. When Jason came to pick up some plates he asked if I needed a bag I told him no I didn't really care for the dish. He then suggested I take it home that maybe someone else would eat it I again declined. ( now normally this is where a restaurant may ask you if you wanted to try something else in place of the dish but I understand every restaurant is not the same and with this one being fairly small they may not offer that type of customer service) Jason then bought me one check . Which showed he must have forgotten about the extra shrimp because it wasn't on there. I asked why he bought one check instead of splitting it like he said he would he informed me that he just wanted me to see the full thing. ( this was after we had been done eating for a while and were really full and ready to go) I told him that was fine and gave him my phone (with groupon) and my credit card. When he bought my items back he had 4 credit card receipts. One for 45.77 and one for $.25 . I asked Jason why he charged my credit card for an extra quarter. He looked annoyed and said that he couldn't process the groupon for less than it was worth so he had to charge me for \\"condiment\\" items I never ordered or received in order to use the whole $15 groupon. I asked Jason why he didn't just give me the extra shrimp that would have made up for the difference he said I didn't even eat it so He didn't want to charge me for something I didn't even eat, I explained to Jason that as a customer I would much rather pay for something I actually relieved than pay for something he made up. He then got a little loud and told me , I cnt break even on a groupon and he had done all he could do. One of the workers in the front called him over once she seen him getting agitated and loud. I don't know what was said I filled out the tip portion for $7 but when he was so rude I changed it to $2, and I left. Monday morning I sent a message on the super chefs website in regards to this issue, on Tuesday morning I got an alert from chase tht a charge had gone through on my card for $48.77 instead of $47.77 which is what I signed for which means someone at superchefs changed my tip amount. I contacted the owner and he said he didn't believe his server would do that and the server told him he suggested I keep my groupon (which also never happened) the owner was not helpful and all and seemed to not take it seriously.

The Texas style ribs were spot on!  I lived in texas for 3 years and learned what real BBQ is, and if it's cooked with anything but smoke and takes less then 8 hours, it's not real BBQ.

Not too overwhelming though just a few tables he just ran around making it look as if the restaurant was on a wait.  We both order a water and a coke...took 20 minutes to get our drinks and we did even place our food orders.  When he finally realizes we haven't received our beverages yet he brings them over and we place our order.\\n\\nWe order the nachos and two bowls of chowder.  Simple, fast and easy...or so I thought.  The nachos come out in a timely manner and you will never guess what happens.  This server comes running through the dining room with the nachos in his hands as if the plates were on fire and he had to dip his fingers in a bucket of ice.  He runs to the table and LITERALLY i am not kidding LITERALLY throws the nachos at the end of table leaving his nasty, finger napkins he was using to carry the plate and ran off.  Let me repeat this, he was using napkins to be able to hold the nacho plate since it was hot, he THREW THE PLATE OF NACHOS ONTO THE TABLE AND LEFT HIS NASTY FINGER CONTRACEPTIVES ON THE PLATE!  The worst part, I touched the plate and moved it into the center of the table without any finger condoms.  The plate was warm at best.  We then begin the nacho dissection only to be disappointed.  The nachos I remember from about 6 months ago were on a huge plate loaded with cheese and toppings.  These nachos were greasy, salty chips topped with no cheese and 3 cold toppings.  These seriously had 0 cheese on them, I order nachos specifically for the cheese!  We don't want these so we push them to the side of the table and the serve just runs back and forth ignoring the fact that we aren't touching the nachos.  When he finally comes with the chowders that's when we tell him about the nachos and he kindly takes them off of the bill.  We dive into our luke warm, tinny canned chowder that you can barely call a bowl it was more like a large plate with a 1/2 inch of depth.  Waste of money.  He drops the bill off and the total is $19.  2 cokes and 2 chowders comes to $19.  I wouldn't mind spending that money if I left full.  It was seriously as if I went there gave this guy money and nothing else, needless to say I will not be coming back to this place because I don't go to lunch to leave hungry.

It is so far one of the best Indian food resturants I have tried in Austin. It is so close to the campus too and so whenever I visit and end up staying at a near by apartment, i can walk here. Sometimes it is hard to find parking but usually I will Togo the food so you juet have to turn your blinkers on and pull in to the side and go grab the food. The price is however pretty high here and so that's why I am giving it a 4 because the quantity of food they give is fairly small for the price compared to other places I have been too. Also some places that I have been too allows rice subsitution for nann but here they don't allow that. My favourite here is probably the chicken tikki marsala but my friend got this lamb curry which was also pretty good. My other friend got this lamb shiskabob dish and that was okay to me. The resturant is pretty small and so there's a chance u might not be able to get seats if its busy. There is an outside seating which would be nice to sit at in nice weather.

Our server was on the ball with our drinks and never rushed us, even though there was a steady flow of customers coming through the door. I hadn't seen my friend in a long time and we unknowingly chatted away long after we had finished eating. While other places would probably ignore us in hopes that we'd get the hint and leave, the staff here still came by to replenish our water! Thank you for being so nice guys!   \\n\\nI had the Chicken Apple Fig sandwich (also recommended by my server), it was really good. An interesting combination of flavors that I enjoyed. Usually I don't like chibatta buns, because they can get big (and spongey) and there ends up being more bread than meat. But this one was mid thick, which was nice.

While I was there I noticed there had specials on a certain day, so I went back with my wife,  since the price was more reasonable.  Before we ordered, I asked the waiter if the meat was the same grade of they normally serve.  They said it was but the special was a slightly different weight.  IE: 7 vs 8 oz.  I was a bit disappointed as it was not as good as when I went the first day.  I also noticed that this cut seem to have more meat than what I had on the first day even though it's supposedly less weight.

The prices are more than reasonable. I've had the Tom Kha Soup, Pumpkin Curry Special, Pineapple Fried Rice, Pad Thai, and several other items.

My son lives nearby and I said \\"hi\\" one day to the owner. Two weeks later we were at the strip mall again and I wanted to see the menu, it seemed so..... varied. Pizza, lasagna, subs, Punjabi, wings, fish and chips. The area actually looks empty and at first we thought it was closed. But it wasn't. Once we were inside that huge menu covering so many different kinds of food just mesmerized me. The people that run the place are just downright hospitable, it was obviously a very family run place. I'm a cheap old man with enough Scottish blood that I don't usually buy anything on impulse, but this was different. I truly wanted to try this place out and the chicken wings looked like as good a place to start so we ordered 20 of them. Then I was perusing the menu when I saw Rasmalai, my favorite Punjabi dessert which I haven't had in several years. It said (2) $6.19. I said to the guy: \\"are they made with gold flakes?\\" He was trying to assure me they were good and I said: \\"good they may be, but 2 for $6.19?\\" He assured me that it was a misprint it was really 6 (probably they originally meant two individual orders - two large deserts enough for both of us). I couldn't help myself, I ordered the Rasmalai. \\n\\nAnyway, the wings were just excellent but the damn Rasmalai was the best I've ever had. We plan to head back and try some of the other items. The restaurant itself looks so \\"empty\\" because this is the kind of food you want to eat at home, relaxed with your feet up. Next we are going to try the butter chicken, pizza and work our way through. I can only speak for the wings and Rasmalai so far, but the wings: one of the best values for wings in the Vancouver area, the Rasmalai: I've has Rasmalai in BC, Alberta, London and India, this was the best....."},{"name":"Coffee Cat Corner","address":"959 E Johnstown Rd","city":"Gahanna","stars":"3.5","text":"Every time I am in Gahanna for work, I will try to stop by this coffee shop.

For some reason, with the name Revolution, I expected to see a place out of a Victor Hugo novel. It wasn't that. It was better. Clean, spacious with huge ceilings, and quirky.

Impressive for a place that's a newcomer.  \\n\\nThe doughnuts are beautifully presented. They look more attractive and succulent than your average doughnut (I'm talking to you, Dunkin' Donuts). That's how you get lured into buying, say, four when you were initially planning to order only one. (Clearly this didn't happen to me.) Service is quick and straight-forward. \\n\\nI love me some yeast. These are ridiculously tasty. In case you've never bitten into a (soft) pillow, that's what it's like here. Except more delicious. And edible. The doughnuts seem to collapse with each bite. But it's not all air; it's not the lightest doughnuts I've eaten. I first tried the vanilla bean. Seemingly simple, but when it's fresh, yeasty, and warm, it's incredibly tasty. The same with the raspberry donut. The icing is addictive. I dare you to eat just one. Or four. \\n\\nI can already see the rivalry between Sublime and Revolution beginning. There will be allegiances. There will be heated rhetoric. There will be finger-pointing and eye-gouging.

The place was packed, but because we were only a party of two they were able to squeeze us in after only waiting about ten minutes.  I loved the atmosphere, it is pretty old school with tiled walls and a tin ceiling.  It was incredibly loud and cramped inside, but I really didn't mind.  We ordered a bottle of Prosecco, and the Tritan plateau, which the waitress said was perfect for two people.  It consisted of 6 oysters, 3 little necks, 3 cherry stones, 6 mussels, 3 jumbo shrimp, and crab cocktail and lobster cocktail.  IT WAS SO GOOD.  I don't think I have ever have had seafood that was so fresh.  We inhaled the whole thing, and then ordered 1/2 dozen kumamoto oysters.  It was one of the best meals I have had in a long time.
