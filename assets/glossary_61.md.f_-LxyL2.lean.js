The beans' preparation was simple; the fried okra was wonderful. They were with whole or cut in half along the length and were quite possibly the best fried okra I have ever had. The chicken was tender moist and had perfectly flaky skin.

There are only a few TVs, so Club 185 is not really a good sports bar to watch the game. They have an eclectic throwback vibe, including a random \\"old school\\" telephone booth, jukebox and photobooth. \\n\\nThe service was pretty average. We pretty much seated ourselves and pulled an extra table together. Club 185 has half-priced drafts for happy hour, which runs between 4 to 7 pm Monday through Friday. Drinks and food are reasonably priced, which is probably Club 185's big draw. It's location and proximity to the Children's Hospital also make it a good after-work spot for many.\\n\\nFor a bar, the food was pretty good. They offer a variety of sandwiches. I got the Cuban Sandwich which was pretty tasty. My friend enjoyed her N.Y. Reuben. Also their fried appetizers were excellent.

They make sweet potato TOTS (tater tots beat out fries, hands down, and so sweet potato tater tots are basically a dream come true). Oh, and they thankfully do not allow kittens to run around in the place. (Cat hair burgers anyone?!). \\n\\nNonetheless, the place misses that spark. That \\"wow\\" factor. No matter how hard they might be trying to be something else, they are still a hotel bar/restaurant and it FEELS like you are in a hotel bar/restaurant. \\n\\nHowever, amazing food, drink and service could potentially overcome this. So let's discuss.\\n\\nThe service was very friendly, unlike what other reviewers have written. My husband and I were waiting for a friend who was running late, so our waiter brought us some delicious toasted almonds...yay! It seems like they don't automatically bring them out, so ask for them, okay?! We were not offered bread until after we ordered our food. We passed since we knew it would be just a tish until the food arrived. Thanks ArtBar for reducing my carb intake! \\n\\nWe were with a friend who is insanely particular about his food and wine. Like annoyingly so. I forgot to do my wine research prior to picking a restaurant. Turns out they have a very very small bottle list for wines. If you are looking for a vast list of wines, this is not your place. Our friend was none too pleased by the bottle offering. However, I am not a wine snob and found both their Malbec and their Red Zinfandel quite tasty. We ended up ordering a bottle of the Red Zin and I was very pleased! In fact, I am I on the hunt for that wine (Earthquake Red Zin...let me know if you know where I can find a bottle). Their beer offerings are limited, especially if you are into craft beers. Smuttynose IPA might be the best localish beer offered. I know they are known more for their cocktails, so perhaps you should give those a shot when you go there.\\n\\nThe food. It was good. My hubby got the monkfish and I got the scallops. Our friend got the lobster rolls with sweet potato tater tots. Those tater tots were absolutely dream worthy, in case you didn't pick up on that in the beginning of this review. I would go back just for the tots*\\n\\n*On Tuesdays, you can get those sweet potato tots for 1/2 price. GO!\\n\\nI can't really say that our food was mind-blowing, but it definitely was good. The monkfish was in an overly buttery broth, but was cooked well. However, the potatoes in the monkfish dish were not so good. Undercooked and under-seasoned (in my opinion, of course!). My scallops were tasty. I am a scallop fanatic! The only way to screw up a scallop is to overcook it, and they did not do such a crime:) The plating of the dishes were lovely and were what you would find in a high end restaurant. Our buddy didn't complain or rave about the lobster rolls (Oh, I forgot to mention that you get TWO lobster rolls with your order). They looked DELISH. \\n\\nOkay, so what I probably could have written at the beginning of this review, but did not because I wanted you to read the whole thing (hehe), was that we will not return here for a meal indoors.

I asked for a 1/2 lb of moist brisket, 1/2 lb of turkey, and a 1/2 lb of sausage (three links). There was enough seating inside for about 40 so I grabbed a chair and proceeded to chow.\\n\\nThe brisket, wow... it was super tender and juicy. The meat was easily one of the best I have ever tasted. As for the sausage, the casing had a great snap to it when you bit into a link. There was a hint of heat to the forcemeat, but it wasn't too spicy. I loved how the carver dipped the turkey slices into a vat of au jus before placing it on the butcher paper. That really helped add moisture to what already was good quality peppered turkey.\\n\\nI was so fortunate to be able to mark Franklin BBQ off my list of foodie places to visit.

It looks gross. It is is a grayish color to start, not brown, not red, not pink -- gray.   It tastes gross.  Despite being placed in a broth it still tastes dry.  Its too processed, and its way overcooked.  I like  beef pho with rare beef.  What you get here is EXTREMELY well done meat that is once again cooked even more once placed into a hot boiling \\"cup\\" of soup. \\n\\n(2) The togo containers they serve the food in are not adequate. They are also small and do not allow room for the toppings (not enough bean sprouts, etc.). \\n\\n(3) They charge way too much -- around $9 for what would probably be considered an extra small serving of pho at any Vietnamese restaurant in the city.  It could be SLIGHTLY bigger.  If you pay that much for pho it should taste better AND be bigger.  They should allow you to have all the toppings you want in another container to accommodate their high prices.  \\n\\nThe pho place inside the North Market down the street is better.

We ordered an appetizer and all three of us ordered the lunch special.  Jackson brought out our drinks and salads and appetizer.  That was it.  He didn't come back for over 30 minutes. We never received our pizza, or even any status update as to why it was taking so long.  We asked the host out front to please check on our server, and he did, but it never occurred to him to let us know what he discovered.  After waiting an hour, we ultimately got up and left.  My friend called the manager regarding this, and after stating that the service was not normally like that, he apologized and asked us to please give them another try and kindly sent us a $30 gift card. \\n\\nMy co-workers and I gave Gino's the benefit of the doubt and went once again Tuesday, June 21, 2016.

After she visited the table next to us three times without acknowledging us, we finally had to ask Tatiana to please serve us.  She gave us excuse after excuse as to why we had not been acknowledged or served today (it was busy - there were maybe 10 people total in the room; she was the only server - there was a bartender serving another person drinks; she didn't know that we'd had bad service before; it wasn't her fault).  Clearly it was too busy for her to handle.  Once again, we got up and left.\\n\\nThis occurred at lunchtime in downtown Austin, Texas and you only had ONE server??

The vegetarian options are all good, though since the Empanadas have gone down hill I usually go with the Fried Eggplant.

They have umbrellas over each table and fans to keep patrons cool.  In the summer time the fans also mist.  The cafe IS located on a corner next to a stop light, so expect the noise level to be a bit above average with passer-bys driving (loud music, exhaust, etc.), but it shouldn't be a ridiculous amount of noise considering it is in a smaller neighborhood.\\n\\nService is great - the employees who work there are always in a good mood, often chit chatting with you as you order and servicing with a smile.

This is not a place for a \\"light\\" meal. We started with some appetizers for tasting - I really enjoyed the Spicy Edamame - great kick of flavor. I also really liked the Gyoza, particularly the size of them and the flavor of the dipping sauce. I ordered the Mi-So-Not Ramen (without the ajitama egg) as I really like Miso soup.

I was really surprised when I read all the poor reviews.  I visited this location for the first time last night and enjoyed it very much.\\n\\nI will say up front the one beef I have with this place is the portion size.  As another reviewer said, the dishes are what you would expect for a lunch portion, but at dinnertime prices.  That said, the prices were also a bit on the high side, and coupled with the small portions equals \\"meh\\" on the value scale.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the food and service were excellent.  Our server was very attentive, friendly, and kept our drinks filled.  These are my minimum requirements for great service, which is often hard to come by these days.  But our server passed with flying colors.\\n\\nFood was excellent.  I liked the light crispy breadsticks and even moreso the herby foccacia with chili oil.  A nice start.  My husband had the Bucatini all' Amatriciana, which he said had just a little heat and was cooked perfectly al dente.  He enjoyed the dish very much, and only wished there had been more on his plate.  I had the Cavatappi Affumicati.  What really stood out was the smoked mozzarella, which added a nice level of flavor to the dish.  Mine was also cooked al dente and tasted great.\\n\\nOverall, it's a balance between good food and service vs. smaller portions and higher prices, which seems to be the case at most Papa Razzi's.  I would visit this location again as it is convenient for me, but I wouldn't rank it as a place to visit often."},{"name":"Saffron","address":"3616 Far W Blvd, Ste 113","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Location: Unassuming location in a strip center.

The manager came by after we asked and made up some story about the sushi bar and burgers coming up in two areas and so it took a while to arrange them together.  Nothing genuine about it.

It was an amazing evening of great bars and great food. Yes, I was back in Portland, Oregon for a business meeting with colleagues from Portland and Seattle discussing the latest in technological wonder, chaos theory and Murphy's Law when we found ourselves in an ok bar just down the street from the office. Well, we barely got our drinks ordered when we realized we were at the wrong place for good drinks and good eats considering we are just a few miles away from culinary nirvana. Do I have your attention? Well, I'm talking about the Screen Door Restaurant on E Burnside St. which has incredible Southern cuisine, and they are the real deal! Everything on their menu is amazing. But before I talk about the food, let me give you some insight on how to get into this place with front row seating, which is extremely important because there is a line that starts at their front door sometimes thirty minutes or more before they open.  You will want to get there a little bit early for a couple of reasons; waiting in line is a bad thing, however, waiting in line for their cuisine is completely worth it. But when the weather is bad and (we are talking about Portland after all) I have a few tips on when to jump in line for great seating from a far. If you're heading out with a group of friends or business colleagues there is my favorite Mexican restaurant and bar for twenty-one years of age or older called the Matador which has great food and great drinks (another Yelp! waiting to happen). They are kitty-corner from the Screen Door Restaurant with windows that line the wall facing E Burnside St that give you a great view of the line as it builds then bends around the corner, which it is at this point when you want to settle up your tab with the Matador and skedaddle across the street before the line gets too far beyond the bend. Hopefully, you will find this tip helpful! Now let's talk about the food. I have had the brisket, collard greens, pimento cheese, which are game changers in their own right, but their fried chicken, mash potatoes and gravy, nirvana. You get two chicken breasts that have been deboned but still have the skin on and fried golden brown to perfection with this crispy, crunchy goodness that somehow keeps the chicken moist and tender. Wow! It is so good you will for the rest of your life think of the Screen Door Restaurant when you think chicken.

This restaurant is kind of nuts.  It has a wacky old world carnival theme which certainly makes it unique.  Think of fairground foods (corndogs, hot dogs, burgers, pickles, fries, tater tots, poutine), but dressed up and made with higher quality ingredients.  They've also got a soda fountain where colorful sodas are made in-house.\\n\\nWalking into the restaurant, you can tell a lot of thought and effort has been put into the place.  The circus-like interior is borderline sensory overload and it's awesome.  The back wall has glass displays filled with assorted toys, many still in the box.  There are TVs, a bar, a leg lamp, a giant rotating corndog, Colonel Sanders memorabilia, and a framed Willy Wonka Golden Ticket (fitting).  My favorite feature: the elementary school style seats in red, yellow, and blue.  Despite the kitschy decor, the space feels new and clean.\\n\\nPallookaville isn't very big and on weekends, it can get packed.  This is a kid-friendly environment, so you may see more kids here than at the typical restaurant.  The atmosphere can get loud, but not uncomfortably so.\\n\\nCorndogs are the specialty.  They, along with the hot dogs, come in different meat options: all-beef franks, Polish kielbasa, and Italian sausage.  Many of the ingredients are sourced locally.  For example, one of the meat suppliers is Patak Meat Products in Cobb County.  The restaurant's cooking oil is non-GMO.  The corndogs are fried in funnel cake batter.  For you vegetarians, there's a vegetarian corndog made out of pickle.  Most menu items are less than $10 each.\\n\\nI've had a handful of items.  Here's a breakdown:\\n\\nCorndogs:\\nCorndogula - 100% beef frank\\nFryinstein Monster - beef frank, Polish kielbasa, Italian sausage, all-in-one\\n\\nHot dog:\\nFootlong special - 1/2 lb footlong, griddled onions, peppers, garlic, Swiss, on French bread\\n\\nSides:\\nMac and cheese - made with three cheeses, topped with Cheez-Its\\nTater tots\\nGarbaged fries - cheesed, onioned, peppered, and poutined\\n\\nBeverages:\\nGreen River soda\\nKiwi soda\\nSour cherry with Maker's Mark\\nHot spiced cider with whiskey - mulled, warm, spiced with orange, lemon, allspice, cinnamon, star anise, and cloves\\nMexican chocolate milkshake\\n\\nThe corndog is a must.  It's not going to blow you away, but it's something you've got to try when you come here.  I can't say I've eaten a lot of corndogs in my life, especially outside a school cafeteria, so it's no surprise that Pallookaville's corndogs are among the best I've tried.  The batter is thick and the meat is hearty.\\n\\nYou can choose from three different types of batter: regular cornbread, pepper, and cheese.  You can also double-dip for extra batter.  I think the single dip is more than enough batter.  I've tried the regular \\"golden\\" cornbread batter and the pepper-infused batter.  I say stick with the original.  I was told by a server that the pepper batter is infused with several different spices, including jalapenos and Sriracha sauce.  It's not spicy at all.\\n\\nThe standard Corndogula should be enough to satisfy anyone's corndog cravings, but if you want to sample all of Pallookaville's sausages, order the Fryinstein Monster where you get all three meats on one stick.  It's a corndog on steroids.  Of the sausages, I like the classic beef frank the best.  It has the most appetizing flavor and smoothest chew/consistency, though the kielbasa and Italian sausage are savory too.  In the end, it's personal preference.\\n\\nThe footlong special is no ordinary footlong hot dog.  It is a mammoth beast and one of the bigger hot dogs I've seen in person.  The beef frank has a nice \\"snap\\" to it and the griddled onions and garlic are a nice touch.  It tastes different than a hot dog you'd typically get at a hot dog joint mainly because of the coarser meat and the bun, which is a baguette.\\n\\nThe three-cheese mac and cheese is nice and greasy.  It's only made more excessive with the salty Cheez-Its thrown on top.  The tater tots are \\"standard,\\" which equates to good because it's hard to screw up tots.  The Garbaged fries is essentially poutine, another greasy dish.  The fries are served smothered in sliced jalapeno, big cheese curds, and a light brown gravy.  It's not my favorite side (I prefer the others), but it's great for sharing.\\n\\nTry one of the sodas.  They use real cane sugar.  The sodas come in bright, vivid colors.  If you can't decide on a flavor, get the classic Green River soda.  Green River is a Midwestern soda from the early 20th century.  To me, it tastes like a sweeter, tastier version of Sprite.  The shakes are rich and delicious.\\n\\nService is good.\\n\\nPlenty of free parking is available in lots behind the restaurant.\\n\\nIn the end, Pallookaville is fun and quirky.  The food isn't something you'd want to eat often, but it's nice to \\"be a kid\\" and indulge every once in a while!"},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I'm okay with lines for good Ramen and this ramen is worth the wait.

Luckily it met all my expectations.\\n\\nI came here at 11am on a Saturday and there was already a throng of people.  The wait was about an hour -- but since I'm used to waiting in SF-- it didn't bother me that much.  My friends had already warned me to come early if I didn't want to wait, but I don't really feel like eating brunch at 9am.  The waiters/waitresses worked pretty fast to turn over the tables, so it really was just a lot of people coming -- not the lack of efficiency.\\n\\nAs for the food -- it tasted great!  The only issue was that my boyfriend and I kept underestimating the portion sizes in Portland.  We shared an order of lemon ricotta fritters as our appetizer and then EACH ordered our own fried chicken and waffle. The lemon ricotta fritters were great.  It reminded me of a doughnut coated with sugar and you could taste hints of the lemon and ricotta.  It was fresh and hot when we got it, so the inside was soft and melty -- so good!  It was airy, so it didn't have that heavy feeling a doughnut sometimes give you.  \\n\\nAs for the fried chicken and waffles -- it wasn't the best I had, but was pretty damn good.  Sometimes with fried chicken, the chicken itself isn't well flavored because it's just battered and fried and the restaurant doesn't do anything with the meat itself, but at the Screen Door, you could taste flavor in the meat.  Also, the meat was cooked so that it was moist on the inside -- which takes skills.  \\n\\nThe reason I didn't give this place five stars is because I like my fried chicken in drumstick and thigh form and here they give you in the form of flat pieces of meat (chicken breast?)  Also, I've had better fried chicken skin.  \\n\\nOther than that one thing -- everything was awesome!\\n\\nOne more tip though - for two people -- split one entree and appetizer(s) and/or a salad.

But sadly , this is Indian food only visually. Flavor wise, this has more in common with mid western tastes. This is the kind of place you take other people who want to try Indian food, but don't actually want to try Indian food or don't want anything 'spicy'. This place is so far below unspicy that It would enter negatives on any given scale. The food simply did not have any flavor. And for some people, that will be fine. I can imagine some of my less adventurous friends being a fan of this place even. Now there were actually some spicy dishes, to be fair, but they too lacked any real kind of flavor other than the spicyness itself. Indian food is all about flavor. I definitely wouldn't come back, but still wish them the best of luck for those who this place would appeal to and make no mistake, there is definitely a place for this kind of food, but expect this more in the norther mid west, not in Austin. \\n\\nOverheard while there \\"what's that tortilla like stuff you guys have\\" \\"nan?\\" \\"Yea that was really good\\" I'm betting these people loved that place. Just adventurous to be trying something new, but ultimately very safe.

It's rare for a coffee shop to accommodate all those things in the same space, but they do it so well. Baby changing table in the spacious bathrooms. Lots of seating, bright and airy.

Objectively, Franklins has the best BBQ in Texas in line with the Texas Monthly #1 BBQ rating in Texas (and by default, in the world).  And for that I will rate it 5 stars.  Will I ever eat here again?  Hell no (sort of...)\\n\\nI arrived here at 10am on a hot sunny Saturday morning.  I was about 3 people ahead of the cutoff point.  The girl last in line held a sign \\"End of Line\\".  I was told ETA was 1:30pm.  I didn't sit down to eat until 2:00pm.  My position in line was located down the street beyond the parking lot.  Fortunately I came prepared.  I brought 2 lawnchairs for my daughter and I.  She brought a DVD player, 5 DVDs, a Nintendo DS.  Got a giant umbrella to shield against the hot sun beaming down on the line.  Brought drinks.  And best of all, brought some brisket and ribs from Snow's BBQ (Lexington) that we got an hour before to snack on.  At 10am, people around me thought I was a moron.  By around 1:30, they thought I was a genius.  Nevertheless, the good folks at Franklins brought free sausage for us poor souls for which we were eternally grateful.  They sell ice cold drinks while waiting, highly encouraged to buy!  Eventually when you get closer, you start celebrating certain milestones like the giant fan, the spritzers, the door!  We were near the door and the dreaded \\"Sorry!  Sold out!\\" sign was put up, but we were reassured that we were guaranteed brisket (except beef ribs...sold out).  The line is an experience in itself.  You befriend everyone next in line talking about BBQ, hunger, sunburn, or Spongebob.  You shoot hoops with the trash can.  The lucky ones eating on the balcony were tossing brisket leftovers for us poor dogs to catch with our mouth.  One guy missed and despite the missed 'cue landing on the pavement of the parking lot, he picked up the morsel and ate it anyway.  Take pics with some of the goths in line who happily obliged while marvelling at how anyone can wear all black with a black leather jacket when it's 95deg.  Some guy in line brought his drum kit.  Damn, I should've brought my guitar.  \\n\\nOne of the problems with a long line, you feel kinda stupid if you only ordered a sandwich or half-pound brisket.  After such a wait, I ordered 3-lbs of whatever each thing they had left.  First, the sausage.  Crisp snap casing, smoky flavor, subtly spicy, absolutely divine.  The ribs, a little too heavy on the rub, but super tender and literally did fall off the bone.  Real talk.  Brisket, awesome flavors.  It was like a work of art.  Almost didn't want to eat it, just stare at it and enjoy smelling the wondrous smoky aroma.  Perfect bark, smoke ring, etc...  Super tender like eating warm butter.  Speaking of which, I found the brisket to be incredibly oily and greasy.  I love my brisket moist but this one was too much.  I happily devoured first few bites but after awhile, I felt like hitting a wall due to its oiliness.  Brought all the BBQ home and still had some leftovers from Snow's, so did a head-to-head comparo for dinner.  The ribs at Snow's was the winner as there was more flavor within the meat whereas with Franklins, the flavor was more dependent upon the rub than the meat.  Sausages were a tie for me.  Franklin's had the better brisket, but it was easier to eat more Snow's than Franklin's because it wasn't as oily.  \\n\\nIf I had to score it, Franklin gets a 99.  Snow's score would be a 98.5.  I have a hard time justifying standing in line for 4 long hours to eat BBQ that's marginally better than its second-best competitor that I waited 10 minutes in line for that same morning.  Chances that I will sit down and eat here again are slim.  But I do plan to swing by here again and getting it to go next time."},{"name":"Aman Palace","address":"63 Union Sq","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"As much as I wish I could say otherwise, the food here was really subpar.

I ordered eggs as a scramble, & asked an addition of saut√©ed onion and pepper with American cheese. I was told flat out they did not have American cheese.

My parents ordered the same meal (a saut√©ed pepper, onion & cheddar cheese scramble.) 15-20 minutes later our sever came back & notified us that Sonsie does not add in onion/pepper to a scramble-- that despite having those items in house, they were portioned out only for the prime rib hash.

The food doesn't push any limits - this is pretty standard home-y food with an occasional twist (burgers with bacon bits and mushroom in it? intriguing).  However, the menu does span quite a few cuisines, from Mexican (enchiladas, burritos, and a few other classics) to as-American-as-it-gets sandwiches/burgers, to Italian (daily ravioli special?!).  It's hard to decide what to get!\\n\\nI've had the enchiladas, portobello pasta, and Chuck's veggie burger.  All of them tasted great but not excellent.

Chuck's veggie burger is supposedly the best of Boston.  While I haven't had any other veggie burgers since moving to Boston, I remain unconvinced that none of the other veggie burgers out there are better.

My second visit here was due to a friend's request for somewhere with a quiet atmosphere, and I knew she would like this. My favourite features, decor/ambience wise, are the \\"waterfall wall\\" separating what was once the front dining room/parlour from the entrance, and the large wraparound patio which allows you to eat outside when the weather is nice. Again, you don't often get that with sushi joints.\\n\\nThe sushi itself is also excellent.

I can't say those things.  An hour and a half wait?  I can get to Lockhart and be elbow deep in meat juices and carnivore glee in an hour and a half!  \\n\\nHere's the reality.  I could get to Lockhart and back, and be very thankful, no doubt.  But I would be missing out.  Today, for lunch, because I won a bet, we took an extra long lunch break (leaving the office at 9:45am) to brave the line.  It was a unanimous decision, this was undoubtedly the best brisket, the best pork rib and the best sausage any of us had ever eaten.  It knocked our socks off.  We couldn't look each other in the eye as we ate.  We just kept our eyes down, focused on slabs of amazing meat and making strange, gargled, gutteral sounds of pleasure.\\n\\nHere's how good it was... as I mentioned above, the sausage was outstanding... and we were PISSED we had it.  Why?  Because we found out from the table beside us that the pulled pork, which we didn't try, was their personal favorite.  We kept thinking back to when Aaron Franklin was standing over the cutting board, why didn't we order a pound of the pulled pork??!!  And now there was a line around the block, and we couldn't just \\"go order a bit more\\".  Ugh.\\n\\nNothing we tried needed sauce.  All of it was more than capable of standing on its own.  But there were these 3 bottles staring at us as we tasted the meat.  So of course we opened them, just a dab, you know out of courtesy.  Holy moly... espresso BBQ sauce, really?  WHO DOES THIS??  Aaron Franklin does, clearly... insanely good.  I am not sure if it was a blessing or a curse, because when I got back to the office, I smelled coffee in the little kitchen near my cube and my instinct wasn't to think about Starbucks, it was that stinkin' delicious BBQ sauce!  \\n\\nFranklin BBQ is 100% worth the hype, worth the wait, worth the drive.

I really did think about ordering a second one so I didnt have to share with my date. Then the ribs came... like how even? I asked for extra sauce because I love a good wet rib, but holy shit it didnt need a drop it was so perfect as it was.

The atmosphere was very clean and trendy. Space was very bright and it's actually quite big inside. Our server was very nice and her and the bartender would regularly come check up on us and refill our waters. The head sushi chef Ming was very welcoming and offered us a complimentary dish. I wasn't quite sure what it was but it was something like a salmon tartare. Miso soup came with our meals but I didn't quite enjoy it because it had a sour flavor to it. They definitely added some sort of seasoning into it. I could do without the miso soup next time. For appetizer, my friend and I ordered the salmon wonton chips and the sweet chili chicken wings. We both loved the salmon wonton chips from Fuji 1546 and decided to try it here. The price was the same as before but portion size was definitely decreased by half, but this was as expected. Quality is still the same! The wings had a good balance of sweet and spicy. They are worth a try. I got the sashimi lunch special and it was served in a nice bowl with ice underneath. Very presentable. Sashimi quality was fresh and delicious. Overall I would definitely return to try their other items. One thing I was surprised in was their drink menu didn't have any cocktails.

I read about Franklin Barbecue in the Art of Eating and, in spite of knowing that I would stand in line, as I never have before for any place, for 2.5 hours (which ended up happening), the article still made such a daunting investigation irresistible.  I've never written a review of a place visited once, until now.  \\n\\nOver the years, I hadn't had brisket that seemed worthy of the passion so often encountered.  But I've never sought it out either, as such, am admittedly unqualified to comment or judge.  The AofE article made me appreciate the art and science of Central Texas Barbecue and sold me on why there is so much passion for it.\\n\\nI ordered lean brisket and pork ribs.  The bark on the brisket was extraordinary and delicious.  It's haunting me now...  The ribs were good but the brisket was simply amazing.   It was moist and flavorful.  Magnificent.  But I'd probably get Turkey next time instead of the ribs, or just the brisket.  That's just me...\\n\\nAs a lark, and against my better judgment as I was already eating too much on the trip, I also ordered a pulled pork sandwich.  It ruined me because I can't fathom any ever tasting better.  I was almost more blown away by the sandwich because I just haven't had enough brisket to compare there's.  The symphony of flavors and textures that makes a 2 hour wait in the future seem worthwhile (every once in a while, anyway).  \\n\\nIf you're going to Franklin's and it's going to be  your only trip for a while, just suck it up and get both.  Having a bottle of Fernet Banca in the car to help deal with after effects is advisable (and was sorely missing in my case).\\n\\nI get why they sellout every single day and don't have enough food to do dinner and will be back on the next trip."},{"name":"Dead Lizard Brewing Company","address":"4507 SW 36th St, Ste C","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Good beer and a nice place to just hang out.

I raved about the soup/salad/breadsticks combo I remembered liking a lot in my youth, when I thought Olive Garden was FAHNCY. \\n\\nWe had to go into the city to run an errand, and drove back past DOT to stop at this Olive Garden, which was completely empty on a Sunday lunch time. Yikes. It reminded me of the huge and perpetually empty Star Market near my old apartment, that no one knew how they stayed open because it was literally like shopping for groceries in a post-apocalyptic world. \\n\\nSo our waiter was nice enough, took our drink orders, helped me out when I fumbled with the tableside game console and accidentally purchased an app?? I don't even know. Because we were flush with cash (GC) we ordered an appetizer, the cheese fontina with bread crisps. It was gross looking first of all, but more importantly, it was covered with a thick layer of oil, and the crisps were stale and everything was completely flavorless except of course for the flavor of cheese oil. On to the entrees...\\n\\nI ordered my old fave... the soup, salad and breadsticks bottomless well that made OG famous. The Zuppa Toscana was watery and overly spicy. The bread sticks look more factory made, like the dough was pumped out of a nozzle. No flavor, no garlicky coating on top. The salad was great, so I gladly ate a whole lot of it. \\n\\nMy day was saved by tiramisu, which I enjoyed very much. \\n\\nA note on customer service... though our waiter was nice, I asked him three times for a refill of water. I was eating a spicy soup and could have really used it. For a while, I was getting by on crunching the ice in my glass, until he took that away, but never brought back a refill. Each time I reminded him I needed water, he acted like it was the first time I asked. I saw him go directly behind the bar, hopeful he was refilling my glass, but never came back with my drink. \\n\\nThe staff also doesn't communicate very well. We either got no plates or double plates for the dessert and appetizer, no cutlery, clearly no water.

It's was semi busy but bar was empty. However, it was obviously dirty with past guests old dish ware and crumbs ect. We sat down. A couple minutes later we were greeted by Angel. I don't want to make this long winded. There were several things that I was disappointed in. The multiple requests for complementary bread, wrong steak was ordered and than admitted on her behalf (wanted NY cut, got Filet $$? or bc she didn't write our order down?), steak was undercooked. Now, mind you, there were two bartenders. One making orders for restaurant guests at tables and I believe Angel was for Guests at and around Bar. So I get it, they were busy. But there was no hustle or urgency. And my most upset moment was Angel purposely rang in the wrong beer for my boyfriend. He ordered Yungling (4 of them), she rang up (5) Sam Adams. It's my fault that she took my card bc I left it on bar top for extended amount of time to get her attention, she grabbed card and ran it.  I didn't see automated check until after it was ran. Point is, Sam adams is .50 cents more expensive than Yungling (confirmed by other bartender). I had 5 Miller Lites; rang up 4. Attached is receipt. I believe she purposely rang up a more expensive draft for gratuity purposes. It was just sketchy all around. We won't be back. It's unfortunate.

No suprises there.\\n\\nLocation- Very nice, but the streets are very narrow and traffic can get pretty heavy. It's clean and plenty of people walking up and down the streets. It's sorta like walking down a dead end street filled with small places to eat.\\n\\nThe look- Nothing amazing, just white sheets and wine glasses. You think they would have put more effort into making the place look nicer. I wouldn't walk in there with regular clothing. It's okay to wear a cute little spring dress and heels like I did.\\n\\nThe bar- the bar is not that large, so you will have to wait on your drinks if you come by 7 pm. The drinks were  good. I don't have a certain drink that I like, but the ones that I did have were pretty decent. \\n\\nThe waiter- He was nice, BUT HE TRIED TO STEAL $20 FROM ONE OF MY FRIENDS.

You would think that with all the rave reviews it's recieved  that the food would be top notch southern style food with a twist. I ordered a salad, and lets just say it looked and tasted like it came out of a expired bag. They had these fried hush puppy looking things on the side that I tasted, and it was GROSS!  It was all mushy and I still don't know what I was eating.$8.00 for a crappy salad! really! I ordered their Burnt Mac and Cheese and it was okay, but I've had way better for $5.00. the fried chicken with a few collards and mash was okay, nothing amazing or anything to scream about. \\n\\n\\nOverall- By the end of the night my bill was $30 plus his $5.00 tip and I was really trying to figure out WHAT IN THE HELL WAS SO SPECIAL ABOUT THIS PLACE.

Sweet potato & lobster soup was clean and amazingly balanced. The indian-inspired sole was the highlight of my meal. Left me wishing I got that as an entree instead. Quail breast was nice- stuffing it with cornbread and collards was ingenious- just, obviously, a bit small; great purees/sauces with it. The short rib was nothing awe-inspiring, but cooked perfectly and very tasty. And whatever chocolate crisp/crinkle (Mike said it was something from the Rhone valley) they stuck on the chocolate pie was to die for.\\n\\nYes, it is expensive, but it's hard to find that quality of food and service, and Aria is well worth it."},{"name":"Courtyard Portland Downtown - Convention Center","address":"435 NE Wasco St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We booked this hotel on priceline. I am going to say at 59 bucks a night. That seems to be a good rate to me by any standard. The place could us a bit of a face lift, but, that is so common. The location is nice. Very central to about everything you want to see in the city. It's located next to the convention center , so I am am sure that is their major business.\\n Now the place is just fine, but I have to say here and now that I have NEVER stayed anywhere in my life where the staff was more on top of the game. \\n They dumped the airport shuttle. It was replaced with a 5 mile limit area range shuttle. They know all the places in town and can take you there.    Restaurant , areas downtown, you name it, they drive you there. Need a lift to another location from where they dropped you last? They pick you up and take you there, just call the driver on the cell. If you tip a five or ten they know you are the boss and at your service. \\n I am going to have to say This is the best thing I have ever had from any hotel anywhere! Cab fare would be the same, yet you have your own guy to take you around. How kewl is that? Park you car in the garage and let them drive! \\n Downtown, Uptown, Ne Se Nw  Sw , you got it. Ask them about XZY place to eat, they know. Surf the yelp, say hey take me, bang, you are at the front door. The driver calls you to see if you about ready for pick-up after a while. It's like nothing I have ever seen in my life. \\n In short, the staff is 100% on top of their game. Book it off priceline and you are going to be happy. \\n Drawback is that the breakfast is not free and is not much for like ten bucks. No big, the driver knows where to go!

Nice owner and the food is more consistent. \\n\\nOne word - Go There Today. (OK, maybe that was more than one word...)\\n\\nI just had an amazing breakfast at Order Up Cafe. There was no line, no crowd, a friendly waitress and great food. They are located in a crummy strip center on the West side of SR 436 just north of Red Bug Lake Rd. The sign is hard to see from 436 but it's worth the trouble. (From the south, cross over Red Bug Lake Rd and get in the left lane. Go through the traffic light just north of Red Bug and you will see a left turn lane without a light that turns into a strip center. Turn left in that lane and Order Up will be in the strip center on your left.)\\n\\nAnyone who has read my breakfast reviews knows that breakfast - at least for me - is all about the bacon. Dare I say that Order Up had the best bacon I've had in Orlando? I dare, I dare... I'm telling you it was thick, cooked crispy and very tasty. And the home fries are simply the best I've had anywhere. (Not sure what happened with the previous reviewer who didn't like them, but mine were incredible.) I ordered my home fries well done (which the waitress called \\"crispy\\") and they were cooked to perfection. Great seasoning and the flavor was excellent. \\n\\nThen there was the biscuit and sausage gravy that I had to try since it was my first visit. Both were home made with excellent flavor. Be advised that they \\"paint\\" some butter on the top of their biscuits before they are served, so if you want a plain biscuit just ask them to hold the butter and bring it on the side. That didn't bother me at all but it might bother others, so FYI.\\n\\nOther than the bacon, biscuit, gravy and home fries, I had an omelet. In all honesty, it's hard to get a bad omelet so I don't use that as a way to judge a restaurant. For what it's worth, my omelet was very good but nothing I haven't had before. \\n\\nI couldn't eat all the food and the price was $8.50 which I would classify as more than reasonable, especially when compared to the other breakfast restaurants I have frequented in Orlando. Order Up Cafe is a great choice for an excellent, home-style breakfast. The restaurant was spotless when I was there. Yes, it's decorated from the 80's, the booths are covered in Naugahyde and are not fluffy (as one reviewer complained about), some of the forks are a little bent, there is nothing fancy about the strip center or the decor and the people working there are just plain folks. To some those are turn-offs. To me, those are pluses and great reasons to call Order Up my new breakfast home. \\n\\nI have been looking for a place reasonably close to home since souring on Keke's a few months ago.

The show was great and everyone from my 10 month old son, to my 13 year old niece had such a great time.  The kids even got to go on stage, so my nephews were in heaven!  The place was packed, and everything was pretty much flawless.  The actors were great and the staff serving our food and drinks worked their butts off!  We went to the 8pm show, and I would for sure recommend this to any family looking for a fun night out!  TIP: since this was with a Livingsocial voucher, just be sure to read all the fine print.  You have to call and confirm your reservation, don't just show up.  And be prepared to pay for parking and tax and tip (of course) when you get there.

The ambiance is great- and there are places to eat inside, out on the patio or in the open seating area in the entrance to the Ecotrust building.\\n\\nTheir pizza is just right- deliciously flavorful, yet not too overwhelming.     Not too thick, yet not too thin.  Most chain pizza places will leave you feeling sick after one or two slices because of all of the grease and oil they use.

He didn't apologize or give us a discount or anything. This still bothers me. The second time, it was served to me, which is fine as I'm not allergic and I noticed before I ate, and this manager did take it off the bill - but it was my birthday so that was a bummer to watch everyone eat while I waited for my correct meal.\\n2) If you go during not busy days, the food and service can be subpar.

I think these cats are too busy now and things have taken a nose dive.  My biggest beef is the delivery.  It takes over an hour now (due to business -not their fault, per se) but most unfortunately, they have jumped on the current trend of places just saying \\"screw it\\" when delivering -they make you go out to their car or \\"neutral area\\" to fetch your food.  Here's a sociological commentary: this is akin to when gas-station attendants used to come to the driver-side window for service and now they don't bother and just go to the passenger side and have the customer to the reaching. Another example is waiters now give the customer the doggie-bag container to do a DIY.  Anyway, Dim Sum no longer comes to the department where I work.  They just call and say \\"delivery here\\" and they never say where in the building they are (even when asked) so I have to spend my half-hour lunch running around the building looking for them.

With Groupon in hand and the company of two other empty stomachs, my friends and I ordered the Pitboss Sampler and went to town.\\n\\nThe Spare Ribs were delicious with much tenderness and a great dry rub providing soft spicy notes that settled in gradually and became evident towards the end of each bite.  A close second, the Baby Back Ribs had nice smokey flavor though were slightly drier.\\n\\nI was pleased to see that the Pulled Pork was well-executed and held its own to that of Redbones - tender and juicy, 'nuff said.  I liked the Chopped Brisket as well, but they were admittedly just solid and probably the least impressive of the meats.  The surprise winner was actually the Southern Fried Wings!  The batter was truly exceptional in that it excelled on all fronts - a sensationally delicate and crispy texture chock full of savory flavor, it needed no enhancement whatsoever.  It gave way to unbelievably juicy meat within that made each mouthful an awesome one.  I can't forget the Spicy Honey Wings which were also very tasty and made me seriously consider a return visit soon for the Monday unlimited wings special.  What COULD be forgotten, however, were the Hot Links - dry and tough to swallow.  From the selection of BBQ sauces, we enjoyed the Pitboss and SoulFire the most as they provided a nice balance of sweetness and spice.  Spice lovers will undoubtedly enjoy the mustard-based Fiery sauce and as for the Sweet...meh.\\n\\nAs for the plethora of sides, I enjoyed Mac & Cheese and Collard Greens the most.

Plus they started really getting into making more custom cakes and expanding the amount of sweets that are made on a daily basis.\\n\\nThey now serve a variety of breads, cake slices, cookies, flans, tres leches, chocolate pastries, enclairs, and pasteles. The absolute best thing to try from here is the pastel de guayaba con queso which is a light crunchy puff that is sugar glazed with insides filled with guava and sweet cheese. The sugar cookies with sprinkles are always a winner, and the cake slice that I previously ordered has a questionable texture. I wasn't sure if the cake should of been refrigerated since the ends were hard and the bottom was really wet. It could also be that spanish cakes are very moist and leaving them around for a day or two can cause that effect.

If you don't like deep fried avocado, I'm not sure what is wrong with you, but there is a version without.   Portions are large enough to fit the $5-6 dollar price tag.   I tried the pulled pork special on my most recent visit and it was fantastic - really tasty and juicy.

Bill comes, everyone throws in money.  I didn't look to close as to how much cash was there (~$40-50) and gave the waitress the cash and my debit card to cover the rest of a $75 bill. She asked if we wanted the gratuity on the card or out of the cash (it had not been added to the bill at this point).  I took out $16 of the cash and told her to just take care of the bill with the card and cash and we would give her the tip in cash.  She came back with $63 charged to my card and no breakdown of tip and actual bill.  I didn't want to cause a fuss in front of the people I was with, but the math works out to a $25 tip on a $75 bill. And I didn't give her the extra $ I had set aside. My bad on not being more careful doing the math before handing over my card.

This was funny to me because we were the only patrons that weren't sitting at the bar in the whole restaurant. Our table was right next to the register, and the door from the kitchen, and was generally boxed in and uncomfortable feeling. I should have asked to be reseated but I didn't. Wa wa wa. Moving on. We were starving when we arrived and started with the grilled bread and fennel butter. Delicious. I am a sucker for fresh bread and any type of flavored butter and this didn't disappoint. The best part about it was nibbling on it with the other dishes throughout the meal! Next we had the kale salad- the dressing was delicious but unfortunately had not been tossed throughly and was therefore clumped into large chunks throughout the salad. I love the Unami flavor from anchovies and the breading was perfect on these bad boys. The flavor was just a little too concentrated for my taste, I ended up cutting them into little pieces so I could eat it with my salad. Next we had the Pieroghies, which I could have definitely skipped and not missed. Completely and utterly meh. Next and finishing our meal we had the mussels. I love mussels and I thought the mustard cream sauce was an inventive way to shy away from the usual white wine/shallot/garlic/butter broth. It definitely worked. It came with some crusty bread to sop up the sauce and I used our grilled bread to the same effect and it was delicious! To drink we had a few draft beers and a few Moscow Mules- they have the real copper mugs, which I love! Overall it was a delicious, yet very rich, meal with well made dishes and drinks. Our server was also very nice- she brought our dishes in an order that made sense- ending with the most rich and flavorful. My biggest issue was the table we were given but that is an easy remedy.

The main course arrived with trimmings of: turnips and apples, green beans, sweet potatoes, turnip greens, and creamy grits with caramelized onions.  We really enjoyed the grits and green bean dishes, but felt that the turnips and sweet potato side dishes were okay (not great).  The desserts we ordered, chocolate cake and lemon icebox pie came last.  The cake was nothing to write home about as it tasted like a Duncan Hines mix with little to no icing flavor added.  The lemon icebox pie had more graham cracker crust and whip cream than lemon filling so it was decent but could have been better with less graham cracker crust and more lemon filling.

The decorations were very relaxing and not in your face so it was awesome for an early morning brunch. The environment was loud, and the music was just loud enough for a light background buzz. \\n\\nAs for the food, my girlfriend and I ordered the hushpuppies for an appetizer and the Po Boy and 2 piece chicken and waffles to share. As a first timer who's never had hushpuppies, I was pleasantly surprised at the flavors that hinted a spice of cinnamon with the sweetness of brown sugar and a crunch outside with a soft and light inside. The po boy was made with a very tasty bun and the sausage inside was flavorful. The fried onions added the crunch to make it all come together nicely. The chicken and waffles...where do I start? The chicken was breaded enough to get the crispy skin of the chicken to compliment the tender, juicy insides, and the waffle was just heaven! \\n\\nOverall, I would recommended Screen Door to anyone who's coming to Portland regardless of their palette because I think they have something on the menu for just about everyone. \\n\\nI will definitely come back again, and am looking forward to trying out more dishes from their menu!"},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"So this review is of my 20+ years of going to the Border Cafe.

The first time I went they had the thick cut fries, but each time afterwards they had the tiny ones.  I prefer the thick cut.\\n\\nThe best part about this place I think is that they're open until 2AM EVERYDAY and they serve beer.  They also have quite a bit of outdoor seating when it's nice out.  \\n\\nEverything on the menu is reasonably priced and they have pool tables inside.  Kind of a cool concept for a restaurant.

I described to her what we were trying to do, and she suggested they just drop off their delicious meats and we do the slicing and serving ourselves. A genius, that woman is!\\n\\nThe night of the party was awesome. They dropped off the meats and let us use the catering containers to keep the food warm. We got brisket, pulled pork and sausage, plus plenty of bread, pickles, onions, potato salad, beans and cole slaw for everyone. Don't forget about the sauce! Containers of every flavor! They even let us borrow their cutting board, knife and instructions on how to correctly cut the briskett. Everyone came up to us and let us know how awesome the food was.

His words perfectly matched my thought, one that was equally overwhelmed as I attempted to make a hungry decision. You can't help not be while perusing the lunch menu at ArtBar, a fine little nook part of the Royal Sonesta Hotel in Cambridge, Mass.\\n\\nAn intimate ambience combined with the restaurant's alluring menu make this place a worthy trip. The American cuisine is a collection of seasonal dishes featuring lots of ingredients native to New England. On this particular cold, cloudy day, I only wished there would have been warm sunshine welcoming me to the restaurant's patio, where one can sit and dine by the adjacent Charles River. But, the weather was far from inviting a outside seat. So, naturally, I did what anyone would have: ordered piping hot soup. Brought forth was a small bowl of Butternut Squash bisque, each spoonful invading my palate with a silky smooth perfectly blended flavor. It was absolutely delicious, and a solid start to part one.\\n\\nOn to part two, a grilled chicken sandwich. Alright, I gotta be straight. Grilled chicken seems boring, like watching baseball or staring at a white wall at the doctor's office. This particular grilled chicken sandwich, however, was out of the ordinary. There must have been a secret something in the dish well beyond it's vibrant and delicious appearance.  A top tangled watercress rested a perfectly sliced vine-ripe tomato that cushioned what looked like the juiciest, most tender well-seasoned piece of poultry.\\n\\nAnd it got even better. Plastered between two slices of toasted seven-grain bread was a creamy complement: Vermont goat cheese. It was the kind of sandwich you'd daydream about. The ingredients were perfectly balanced and hearty. Served with an oversized pickle and a house salad with drinkable balsamic dressing, I'd absolutely return to ArtBar just for this lunch delight."},{"name":"Fat Matt's Rib Shack","address":"1811 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"There are few parking spots, but many people are leaving at most times so you'll be sure to find a spot in a relatively short amount of time.  They have a live jazz band playing music inside, which is very unique and definitely adds to the southern feel, but thats the only downside which gave this place 4 stars instead of 5.  The music was simply TOO loud for such a small indoor place.  Also, the band blocks the entrance to the bathroom, therefore you must sacrifice your earbuds to wash your hands or use the restroom.\\n\\nThe decor is very nice, plenty of photos, artifacts hanging on the walls, giving off a homely southern feel.  The painted brick wall at the entrance with the name of the restaurant, is very nice, and the menu is nice and big for everyone to see.  The customer service here is VERY friendly and great.  The price is average for ribs.  There is relatively limited seating inside and outside.  Around 24 people can sit outside on the patio and about the same number can sit inside.  \\n\\nThe ribs are delicious! I split a full slab with my friend and they fall off the bone relatively easily, have the authentic smoky flavor, the sauce provided has a tangy explosion of flavor to it.  The sweet tea is decent, and the potato salad is above par, being nice and creamy and smooth with proportionally sized potato chunks.  I didn't get to try the pie but i heard it was delicious from other people eating there.  \\n\\nAlso considering its location right IN downtown atlanta, definitely come here at least once to try out some quality ribs and be sure to come prepared to get down and dirty!"},{"name":"Jake's Famous Crawfish","address":"401 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Expectations are often very difficult to meet, even when tempered by hunger's lingering insistance.

I enjoyed my Guinness in contentment until we were called to our table.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is nothing if not classy - elegant, sophisticated trappings take you back to a time where you can imagine the streets outside to be of cobblestone, traipsed upon by horses and carriages and the \\"newfangled\\" Model T automobile.  Rich oak fixtures, an attentive and courteous staff...the majority of my high score can be attributed to these very important characteristics.\\n\\nThe food itself varied in quality from amazing (the calamari and crab bisque were of particular note) to decent.  My dinner itself, the thresher shark, was tasty enough...grilled well and covered in a cilantro butter that was quite nice, but definitely small - I have had a shark steak before, and it was of considerable size, at least when compared to what was offered to me.  While light and fluffy, the mashed potatoes were a bit bland, although I am assured that there was some measure of garlic in them.\\n\\nIn all, with the delicate, flavorful crisp of the calamari (and mouth-watering horseradish marmalade!) and a savory, meaty cup of crab bisque as a starter, I think I was simply ruined for the main course.  I could have honestly made a meal of the appetizers and been content, given more of the same.  \\n\\nThat is not to say that I had a bad experience with Jake's - on the contrary...I enjoyed it very much, and will certainly return.  The only thing I plan to do differently, however, is to order something of perhaps more substance for a main dish - maybe then I will be content to offer the perfect score that Jake's so nearly came close to achieving."},{"name":"Boom Beer","address":"15175 101 Avenue","city":"Surrey","stars":"4.5","text":"Legit fried chicken.

But when they appear they were surprisingly pleasant and friendly.  The servers brought out glasses of cold water to distribute to people in line, and kept apologizing for the wait.  Once we sat down at the bar, the owner, working behind the counter again apologized to us for the wait and thanked us for coming repeatedly.

How about a slightly less salty soup and salt shakers on the tables?  I always finish the entire bowl, not wanting to waste a drop of the precious broth. I understand the broth need the salt to bring out its flavor, but I really prefer it be tone down a bit.  It's having me worried about my health and hydration.  I usually end up drinking tons of water afterward and still wake up feeling thirsty the next day.  I point this out NOT to discourage anyone from trying their ramen.

We arrived right as they opened on a random Tuesday and we were immediately seated in the prized half booth by the bar with the view of the entire restaurant. SCORE!\\n\\nInitially, I was going to order the Philly cheese steak considering Tom E. raved about it and my friend was going to get the Sublime burger but we were told they hadn't received their donut order yet. Bummer! Oh well, an excuse to come back again!\\n\\nAfter being talked in to it, I ordered the french dip and he ordered the Philly. \\"Am I going to be wearing the au jus dipping sauce?\\" I asked the waitress, pointing at my chest. \\"You'll wear it with pride!\\" she said with a smile. Note: girls with big chests understand my dilemma. Food ALWAYS ends up on your chest regardless of what you eat! I smelled like au jus for the rest of the day and was so giddy from my delicious sandwich I was tempted to let other people smell my chest...if I didn't fear getting arrested.\\n\\nWhen I took my first bite I had to close my eyes so I could focus. The au jus was perfect and set it over the top with an amazing onion and pepper taste that clung to the shaved beef slices. The bread soaked up the sauce perfectly-as did my boobs! There wasn't really a big difference between this sandwich and the regular Philly only that didn't come with sauce but come on, don't deny the sauce! Even typing this review I am day dreaming about it!\\n\\nI LOVE the atmosphere of this place! 60's music was playing in the background and how can you not sing along with that? You could tell the staff really wanted to be there and enjoyed it-which is so rare! The bar staff knew almost everyone that sat down for lunch by name, which was impressive and was really telling about this place. \\n\\nIt is amazing, in this economy, how customer service has fallen and portions are cut-not the case with Cypress.

Now, let me tell you, we came here twice within the week. The 1 star is a reflection of the service we got on saturday night. Had we only been here on Thursday, they would have gotten 5 stars. Thursday we had excellent service. We were quoted a 30 minute wait but got sat within 20 minutes. Our server Cesar was amazing. He helped us with the menu since we had never been there, kept our drinks full, checked in to make sure we were alright, and when we realized we had to leave in a hurry, he got us our desserts To-go. As a server myself, I'm not ashamed to admit Cesar is a better server than I am. He had the best attitude and if it wasn't a 20 hour drive, I would go eat in his section all the time. Now, we went back on Saturday for the last day of our vacation and the experience was completely different. We waited about the same time for a table. We had a different server named Derek who was simply awful. He was short with us, and ignored us after he took our order. My boyfriend's drink was empty about 5 minutes before the food arrived,¬† and was not refilled until about 6 minutes into the meal (so it was empty for 11 minutes ). The server finally brought the refill and basically sprinted away from us, barely catching my boyfriend trying to tell him he needed ketchup, which he grabbed from the nearby table and handed to him before sprinting off again. At this point, my sweet tea was empty, and remained empty for the duration of the time there. He never acknowledged or offered a refill and insisted on paying us out before our dessert even came out. If he was super busy, I'd understand. But he had plenty of time to chat it up with the host stand and the family sat across the way, who's waters were refilled before they were even halfway gone. The food itself was pretty good, I had the same bento box meal both times. All I can say is if you can, request to sit with Cesar.

I don't know much about beignets, what constitutes a good one, etc. These are deep fried crisps of what looks like bread, but tastes much better. But the way they are cut, it's as if they were baked first and then cut and deep fried, but I am not certain. They have a slight coconut flavour from the dried and sweetened coconut on top. I love them exactly as they are. Today, 28/JAN/16, they are good/fine/not old oil, but I can see how old fry oil could be a potential for disaster for this particular food.

But most of that is because of the music. I have never and will never come here for the food alone, and I wish wish wish they could improve the outside venue, just a little bit. That's all it would take to take it from okay to awesome.\\n\\nI've eaten here twice, both times because we arrived for a show WAY too early and didn't feel like giving up our parking space, and pay again for parking, to go somewhere else. Their BBQ is pretty blah. It's not terrible, but it's not something I would pay for. It's alright for someone grilling in their back yard, but that's about it. Nothing special about the sauce or the meat. Not juicy but not dry, not falling off the bone but not chewy- just okay. Same for the sides- blah. I could make the same at home, and have. Like I said, nothing special or memorable. And at these prices, I expect to really enjoy my meal rather than feel like this is BBQ night at home. I would also like to get a bit more food as long as I'm paying this much and crammed in here with so many other people. \\n\\nAs far as the venue goes, obviously the music is great. They book a lot of great shows, a lot of varied performers, and the sound system is really good. I've seen the Toadies there twice, Cake, Rufus Wainwright, Nickel Creek's last show in Austin (so sad), and a couple of others I can't remember at the moment. I wish they could do something about the dirt/gravel thing they have going on. I can't see a show here and be comfortable in anything other than cushy sneakers. Sandals with a 1 inch heel? Nope. I can't get footing and am constantly having to dig the heel into the dirt to feel at all stable. Plus, if anyone spills a beer your feet are covered in mud and there's nothing you can do about it. And the amount of gravel in the dirt is just enough that wearing cheapy flats means the rocks are poking the crap out of your feet all night. I'm not saying you have to pave the whole thing, and I'm not saying you have to put in astro turf or grass, but out of all the available options, this seems like the worst possible option.\\n\\nAlso, port-a-potties. UGH. UGH x a million. Even Emo's has real bathrooms (albeit gross, small ones in various states of disrepair). I'd rather wait in line for 10 minutes and use a real toilet and have running water to wash my hands in, with lighting so I can actually see enough to wipe (sorry) and maybe even a tiny, dirty mirror to check my makeup, than use a port-a-potty with no real running water, no light, and no way to wash my hands (but thanks for the hand sanitizer, I guess). It's bad enough I can barely see if someone peed on the rim of the seat or if there's no TP, but I also can't check for bugs, or if I latched the door properly. Sigh. So I try to make sure I use the one upstairs before we head out back, or just don't drink anything all day beforehand.\\n\\nParking is obnoxious, of course, but it's the same problem with every single venue down town.\\n\\nI wish these iconic down town places weren't so popular that they stopped giving a crap. It makes me sad that they take their success for granted because they feel like they'll never go out of business. That may be true, but I still want to enjoy my meal and my concert experience.

Leave the house by 10:05AM, get in line by 10:30AM, stuff my face by 11:15AM. \\n\\nWe actually arrived about 10:40 and managed to get a good parking spot and about 20th in line. Not bad.\\n\\nOnce the gates opened, we waited about 20 minutes until getting to the register to order.\\n\\nThe Lowdown:\\n\\nPulled Pork - definitely moist and succulent, no doubt about it...however it was a bit on the salty side. \\n\\nBeef Brisket - OK so almost opted for the \\"fatty\\", but went for the \\"lean\\". Even then the brisket was pretty fatty. The actual parts of meat that we did get were good, but the ratio of fat to meat was a little disappointing. I had a pool of grease marinating at the bottom of my 3 part paper plate.\\n\\nBeans - These tasted funky to me. I'm not sure if it was an off day, but the beans kind of tasted like they were over-smoky, or burnt (although they didn't look it). Something was just not right with these beans. Funk, burnt, too charry tasting? 1 bite, 2 bite, 3 and 4 bites of pondering what was awry and I was done trying to guess\\n\\nColeslaw - Decent, but nothing to jump up and down over. A little vinegary, but not much taste going on.\\n\\nPotato Salad - Forgettable. Tasteless seemed to be the theme here. Detected a hint of mustard, but again nothing exciting. I normally go to town on BBQ sides,  but this was a sad day for the \\"clean plate\\" club\\n\\nThe Sauces - 3 kinds. The espresso was thick and interesting. The regular was in between in consistency and a bit vinegary. The 3rd once which seemed to be the thinnest in consistency was my favorite. It was the most vinegary and seemed to cut the greasiness of the BBQ most. All in all I've had better BBQ sauces, but there definitely were not bad.\\n\\nSo why the 3 stars and not 2 or below? Overall the bbq was still moist and decent, just not top notch or something I would crave or take the time to pre-plan as I did the 1st go around. I still think Salt Lick reins supreme and I know many may disagree. So my advice is this, if you haven't tried it, check it out at least once. You may like it, you may not. To each his own in the world of Austin's BBQ quest for carnivorous heaven.\\n\\nBottom line, If I drove by this place and saw a massive line, I probably wouldn't bother stopping.

I tried the brisket, sausage and chicken - all pretty good but wouldn't say it was the best BBQ i've had. Overall, my 4 star rating is really due to the whole experience in itself.

Duck, burgers, yellowtail, risotto, aoli, burrito, taco, Thai (Thai fries? Wtf) the chef is obviously demented. The menu being so odd, and varied made it seemingly impossible to order.\\n\\n3- we ended up getting poppers and risotto for apps. Salmon in a jalape√±o popper? We thought we'd try it out of curiosity and it was FOUL and the risotto tasted like what I imagine cat food would taste like. \\n\\n4- burgers arrive. We were splitting burgers. This had to be by far the greasiest thing I have ever touched. Each of us got up to wash out hands several times throughout the meal and couldn't even finish half of the burger without being nauseated. \\n\\n5- in my defense, we would have gotten salads, but they all sounded dull and not worth going out for.

You might think that I am cool too, so I fit in, but ahhhh, maybe not THAT cool.   Anyway, it is kind of a yuppie hang out, IMO, and this is where the cool people are in case you are wondering.  So that was fine...\\n\\nNow, as far as business planning:  I recommend that if you are going to start a business plan or sketch something out, you need to bring your own cocktail napkin.  You see the cocktail napkins at this place are white cloth and that won't do.   I didn't have a cocktail napkin, and we had to use a piece of real paper.  This was a little disappointing not to start out with a cocktail napkin, but OK, that is fine.   \\n\\nThe service was rather prompt as much as I paid attention to it.  It seemed like someone was always asking me if I wanted anything.  \\n\\nOne problem is no food till after 5 PM on Sundays, though that wasn't a big deal.\\n\\nWe decided to just order a beer and then get some food after 5.  The beer selection was large enough, but the beer menu itself is not very informative, not at all. There is nothing on the menu besides a price and a name.  Names like Zombie Dust or Mornin' Sun.  Who knows the name of every craft beer and whether you will like it?  Personally, I would like to see the IBU (Bitterness units) and an estimation of the color of the beer and at a minimum the name of the style, but the menu has none of this, just the names of the beer.  So you will have to rely on the wait staff to figure out what you want, because 29 out of the 30 beers are probably something you have never heard of.   Again, this was OK.  It's fine.\\n\\nAfter 5 PM we asked for menus and ordered some appetizers from the happy hour menu.  Again, same problem with the happy hour food menu.  It just has the name of the dish with no description of what you are getting, so if you want to know what beer cheese fondue is, you have to ask the waitress/waiter.  Btw, it is three kinds of cheese that is melted (like queso, though I was told much better than queso) in a small dish served with a pretzel bread and green apple slices.  My friend ordered \\"sliders\\", yes that is plural, and some fries.  I ordered the beer cheese fondue.  Just a note, when the \\"sliders\\" arrive it is actually just one slider.  I am not really complaining because again this was ok and I wasn't really paying attention to anything but our conversation, but it is kind of funny to call it sliders as if there are multiple sliders.  What if we had wanted to share the sliders?\\n\\nAs it approached 7, we wrapped it up, split the tab and headed home.  We each had one beer, I had the fondue which was OK, but I was still hungry and then ordered a \\"sliders\\" for myself.  My friend had a sliders and fries.  The ticket came to $32, which seemed reasonable and on the upper end for happy hour on a Sunday, but it was fine. \\n\\nThe food was OK, the beer was OK, both were hard to understand what you were getting, and the people were a lot cooler than me.   So all in all, it was fine.  I could easily give this place 4 stars if I was on a date or maybe trying to be cooler than I am, but since I was wanting to talk with a friend and make plans, everything was just OK for that situation so, I will go with a 3."},{"name":"Stubb's Bar-B-Q","address":"801 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Texas barbecue is a whole different level of quality.

Nothing was dry at all, and even without the sauce, everything tasted great.  The sauce added even more depth to all of it, and their sauce was super well balanced - not too sweet or tangy.

So when Lonesome Dove opened in Austin, my husband and I decided it would move to the top of our must-try list.\\n\\nFor opening weekend, they had things down pretty smooth. We walked in and were seated at our reserved table right away. The ambiance here is like trendy western. The restaurant was also the perfect size to feel a little more intimate. \\n\\nWe started with the Elk Fettine- which was incredible. All of the fettines sounded a little off on the menu, but you must try one, they are really good. Next we had the kangaroo carpaccio nachos which were good, but probably not worth it for the price, we literally got a tiny plate with 2 nachos on it. We shared the wedge salad, which was excellent as well- with jalapenos, bacon, and a southwestern dressing. For the main course, we shared the rabbit tenderloin with the shepherds pie. The tenderloin was one tiny piece and not really substantial enough. The shepherds pie was really good and perfect for sharing. By this point we were full and therefore did not try any desserts although the dessert menu did sound tempting. \\n\\nOverall, Lonesome Dove was good, the only reason I am removing a star is for the portion/price ratio on some items.

I went to visit tonight to check out the food and vibe and it's WAY smaller than the website makes it seem, so definitely won't work for my group, but it is a cute quaint little spot good for a date.  My friend and I were seated next to the fireplace and I thought if she was a he he'd be gettin some tonight but I digress...\\n\\nOur server was very nice, and about half way through our meal the manager stopped by as well.  I mentioned to him my needs and he stated he'd be happy to show me the rest of the place and chat about group events when we were finished which he did.  Service wise I'm very happy with SCK.\\n\\nMeal wise, I'm undecided.  I have been salivating over the shrimp scallops and grits so that is what I ordered.  My friend ordered the fried chicken.  She said it was good, but then she said it was bland which makes no sense at all, but what I can say is that it looked a bit dark to me.  I personally think fried chicken should be golden brown, so it didn't look to appealing to me.  My dish...meh...I wouldn't order it again.  It was one of those things where it was more than I could eat but not enough especially for 19 bucks ya know?  On a bed of \\"creamy\\" (read pasty and bland) grits came 3 shrimp and 2 scallops.  WAY OVERPRICED.  I never salt my food, but I had to salt the grits and still ended up picking out the meat (which was sufficiently tasty) and eating only a few bites of the grits that were covered in gravy and salt.  So for 20 bucks I ate 3 shrimp 2 scallops and a small biscuit.  In fairness, I could have built it up in my head so much that nothing would have satisfied me.  I will say the biscuit was pretty friggin melt in your mouth and ya can't be mad at that.  Even though I'm kind of intrigued by some of their other menu items, I won't be breaking my neck to return to SCK, not because it's bad, but because they actually have a kind of limited menu and none of the items scream \\"come back and eat me, I'll change your life!\\"  Also cause I have a ton of other places to try and nothing about SCK screamed regular spot to me.  Also, I didn't care for having to pay to park and there is some dilapidated structure next door that really needs to be taken care of.

The croutons, which I actually considered leaving off because I'm trying to lose weight, ended up being the best part. It was your typical caesar salad with chopped romaine, and shredded parm cheese on top, but the croutons were almost like a cheesy grit crouton! Absolutely amazing!! Another MUST TRY when visiting the resaurant.\\n\\nEntrees: As I meal, I wanted to try another appetizer so I had the mussels n the lemon curry broth and asparagus as my side. My husband had the chateu steak with puree potatoes, and field peas. The mussles were very good, the broth was absolutely delicious. I was a bit dissapointed with the asparagus, they were a bit dried out and a little too \\"smoky\\" for my taste, and they desperately needed a bernaise or hollandaise sauce to kind of balance that out. The chateu steak was also good, my husband loved it. It was cooked just right, though I was disappointed there was no sauce paring with it. I did not get to try the puree potatoes nor the field peas because my husband ate them too fast, but Im sure they were very good considering they were gone before the entire steak was consumed.\\n\\nDessert: We did not look at the menu, but simply asked for the most chocolate thing they had. They brought out what looked like a flourless, it was extremely dense, chocolate torte with a coconut sauce on the plate. It was extremely good, and a great way to finish off our bottle of wine. I would definitely recommend this dessert. We did not have room for coffee.\\n\\nOur server Rod was very nice and efficient. This is coming from someone who works in the fine dining industry. He hit all the steps of service, and never let our wine glasses nor water glasses become empty. He was also very knowledgeable. We ate early and brought our 6 mo. old son and 2 year old daughter, and both were catered to as if they expect children every day, which of course they don't because it is a white table cloth type restaurant where most people don't bring their kids. Every server interacted with both children, making us the parents feel very much at home, and not like an annoyance because we did not get a sitter. \\n\\nI would recommend South City Kitched-Midtown to anyone, and I would definitely go back!"},{"name":"Olive Garden Italian Restaurant","address":"11B Allstate Rd","city":"Dorchester","stars":"2","text":"I get why this restaurant has such a low rating.

Great selection of burgers from the simply sublime to the ridiculously decadent. Something was lost in translation though,  as I wasnt thrilled by the overall flavor of the burger (Jalapeno cheeseburger). I believe that they claim that each burger is 6oz, but that seemed a stretch. Also, be sure to ask for lettuce, tomato etc. because on the specialty burgers, it is assumed you don't want the accoutrements unless specifically mentioned.\\n\\nAmazing milkshakes - I know it sounds stupid, but it was literally like drinking really good ice cream. \\n\\nSuper friendly staff, genuinely happy to be there. A sick digital juke box.  A pool table.  A full bar. The manager/ proprietor is this awesome mix of Paul Bunyan and a 50's biker - and was stoked on everyone coming and going and made sure that the entirety of the clientele felt legitimately welcomed.\\n\\nParking.

As a result we went to dinner here the other night and thoroughly enjoyed our meal. We love to try new foods and this was a great adventure. This Caribbean cuisine from the Island of Trinidad was similar in some respects to more familiar Indian curries yet eaten in a fashion similar to the stews of Ethiopia. In this case you use the Bussup Shot Roti bread to scoop up your curries (no utensils except your fingers are necessary). This bread is a cross between a flour tortilla and Indian Naan and is flavorful and filling. In the case of the Bussup Shot it is cooked with oil or butter and worked over a bit (literally beaten up) so that it comes out flaky and a little crispy. \\n\\nAlternately, you can have your curry served with the Dhalpurie Roti. This roti is covered in a layer of seasoned, ground chickpeas and then folded around the meat and curried potatoes in a wrap like formation. We tried the boneless chicken curry Dhalpourie style and the Beef curry with the Bussup Shot Roti. Both were excellent. Don't be afraid of the curry here either if you have an aversion to spicy hot food; they will adjust the heat to your taste.  \\n\\nSince it was our first visit, the owner took her time explaining the various dishes and their preparation to us. By the time we placed our order we had a good understanding and felt confident with our choices. And when the food arrived we were rewarded with some wonderfully satisfying food.\\n\\nThis is a small restaurant in strip mall near the Goodwill store in Apopka. It's the type of place you could easily overlook or dismiss if you didn't know better. But inside the restaurant is clean and inviting, the owner is friendly and helpful. There are a few tables to dine in but they also do take out. Prices are very reasonable ranging from $6.50 - $12.00 for entrees and $1.50-$2.00 for sides. \\n\\nAt Kalla's you have a chance to experience the island of Trinidad, it's food and it's people. Discover a cuisine you might never have tried before. Now I know the next time I'm on a cruise ship that makes a stop in Trinidad, I'll be heading for a roti shop.

My husband and I went last night for the first time. We ordered meatloaf and fried chicken family style. I was surprised that this was available for just two guests, but it didn't seem to be a problem. It was a lot of food, but not insurmountable if you eat lightly the rest of the day. \\n\\nI loved the atmosphere. It really felt like we were eating at someone's grandmother's house in the country. You're close enough to other restaurant patrons that you can chat if you want but not so close that you feel like you're at the same table. Also, our waiter was really friendly and knowledgeable. I'd give him a shout out, but I don't know how to spell his name. \\n\\nOur family style meal started with two appetizers. First, we received two small deviled ham sandwiches. When I read the menu, I was skeptical of them, but they were delicious. The sandwich tasted like a hybrid of a patty melt and a grilled cheese. This sounds like something you would order at a greasy spoon, but the quality of the sandwich matched the environment. Next, we were brought a kale salad. My husband hates kale, but he really enjoyed this salad because it had a manageable texture, and the kale wasn't overpowering like it can be sometimes. \\n\\nA few minutes after we finished our salad, the waiter brought out our entrees and all five of our sides. Since we ordered family style, we didn't get to choose our sides, but the sides chosen were supposed to complement our entrees. The star of the meal was my meatloaf. It was tender but still meaty, and the barbecue sauce on top was delicious. My husband liked the fried chicken, but he was very jealous of my meat loaf. The fried chicken was really good, but I would give it four out of five stars. It was seasoned and cooked perfectly, but we've had great fried chicken at a bunch of places. \\n\\nAs far as the sides go, we really enjoyed all of them. My husband's favorite side was the red peas and rice. They were delicious and had great texture. I loved the collard greens. They were a tad on the salty side but very well cooked. Honestly, I don't usually like restaurant collard greens. It's just a food that home cooks seem to do better, but these were the best restaurant collards I've had in a long time. We also really liked the mac and cheese. It's a creamy cheese sauce that likely uses white cheddar and some milder cheeses. The potato chips on top were an interesting (in a good way) and unique addition. Fingally, we were given roasted cauliflower and duck fat fingerling potatoes. I thought both of them were really successful and tasty. \\n\\nFor dessert, we had the lemon icebox pie and the gingerbread cake. My husband LOVED his cake. The texture was springy and moist, the ginger was present but not overpowering, and the ice cream complemented the cake so well. I had the lemon icebox pie and loved it. If you've had lemon meringue pie made with sweetened condensed milk, this icebox pie is a close relative. It used whipped cream instead of meringue and a little bit of lemon zest was sprinkled on top. \\n\\nOverall, we loved our meal, and the food seemed authentically Southern. I have had similar foods many times in the past, but what sets Revival above my past experiences is the execution of the food. Every single thing was delicious. I'm sure there was plenty of butter and fat, but nothing tasted too greasy. All of the food tasted like an idealized version of Sunday dinner in the South.\\n\\nMy only regret was forgetting to take pictures, but I think stopping to do that would have lessened the enjoyment of our meal a little bit.\\n\\nMy last note is about the cornbread. I've seen a lot of people rave about it, but I feel like calling it cornbread is a little bit of a misnomer. It's the byproduct of an illicit relationship between a buttermilk biscuit and cornbread. With that said, it was very tasty."},{"name":"Chez Jose Mexican Cafe","address":"8502 SW Terwilliger Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"A friend and I were out and about near here, thought about lunch, and we both remembered we hadn't been here in a long while.

We always end up here when we go out because it's a guaranteed good time. The video games take me back to elementary school and the vibe of the bar takes me back to the way bars use to feel in Austin in the late 90s. I'm dating myself yes but who cares, it's Super fun, people of all ages, and the best part is everyone starts inner-mingling cause it's just an innocently safe and nostalgic environment for people looking to have a good time. This is just a feel good place that also happens to have decent bar food and fantastic, knowledgeable bartenders and mixologists. To me the folks behind this bar take it to the next level to make it a solid 5 star bar option in Austin. Even if it's busy you can get a drink because they're fast and just always on point...and they smile here too! No standing around ignored to finally have a surly hipster judge my middle aged colors light selection. Gotta love that around this town! One last thing I have to mention is I lost a substantial diamond ring here (pretty sure it happened playing Street Fighter cause I was in a pretty long intense battle where my hands where flying to produce those secret moves I still remember from 1992) and when I called the bar the next day I had to leave a message. I left it not thinking anyone would get back to me but two people have already followed up. No they didn't find it, but they looked and took the time to tell me and also shared in my frustration of the loss cause losing something like that is obviously a real buzz kill. Again, I cant stress enough how wonderful the staff is here.

Though we did wise up after getting the sampler platter... so we got more of just the three biggest and best choices: the shrimp, the BBQ roll, and the empanada (I think?) that had the pepperjack cheese in it. If I'd just gotten several of those at $.50 each, I would definitely have been a happy camper!\\n\\nThe kicker for me - several of us paid with our cards, and included our tips in the amount charged directly to our cards and then wrote zero in the tip box.

I heard some real horror stories of Asian cuisine businesses cutting corners to save money, when I used to work for Chinese restaurant myself: egg drop soup that is months old, chicken that is left out overnight, and the notorious kittens in the freezer, etc. So I read the reviews before trying Eastland, and was hoping to find a confident new favorite. \\n\\nI ordered from their Chinese menu, knowing enough to try their cooked foods first before I trust their raw sushi. I ordered take-out. Conflict #1: the hostess did not give me my change back. But it was only about $0.09, so I figured I would let it slide. She offered me a water while I wait, and brought back a glass of lightly iced water with a lemon sitting on the bottom of the glass. Conflict #2: For hygienic reasons, an establishment should never drop the slice of lemon into the glass of water. Not a big deal, purely mentioning it. My food was brought to me quickly. I live in the apartments behind there and brought my food home within a couple minutes. Here is the real reason  I'm writing this review. The first box I opened were my crab puffs. Conflict #3: The sweet and sour sauce stunk and tasted of mildew. Get this - I work at a local farm. I know the smell of mildew VERY well. I passed it to my hubby. He could smell it too. I wondered perhaps we were being over-sensitive and tried to eat it with our crab puffs anyway. No. Not good. Moldy mildewy dusty old taste. How gross is that?! How old can something with so much sugar get to smell/taste like that? It ruined the whole meal. Everything I ate from that point on felt uncomfortable. I couldn't help but imagine what other corners they were cutting if they allow their main condiment to mold. \\n\\nAnd at last Conflict #4: I drove back with the container of sweet and sour. Yeah, I know. I did it for sweet and sour sauce. How ridiculous am I? But it was literally only a 2 minute trip and it would be worth trading out for a new one for the rest of my crab puffs. When I arrived, I explained my experience with the sauce. What do they do? The all dip their fingers in it, look at me like I am some kind of idiot and tell me \\"That's just how it tastes.\\" Seriously? I worked at a chinese resteraunt! This ain't my first rodeo! I was so frustrated. No apology. No offering to switch it out for a fresh one. Absolutely no customer service whatsoever. Whatever. I told them I didn't even want my money back, I was just trying to help them. I walked out. Oh by the way. Conflict #5: I never got a receipt either. \\n\\nNext time, I'm trying Tangs across the street. I'll make sure I leave an honest review. Be weary of Eastland.

After some chips and salsa, an entree and one of their giant margaritas, I am usually feeling rather whale-like, and slipping into a food coma before I even leave place.\\n\\nNotorious for having lines out the door and ridiculous wait times.

I also like the ambiance here - it's a pretty small, dimly lit place consisting of booths, high top + bar seating.  They have a cute patio area that looks like it would be really nice for warmer nights.\\n\\nFor an appetizer, we started with the buttermilk fried chicken wings.  My boyfriend and I agree that they're probably the best wings we've ever had.  The batter melts in your mouth + the chicken falls off the bone - they were the highlight of the meal; HIGHLY recommend!  The fresh greens salad was also delicious, as was the bread + butter.  For an entree, my boyfriend ordered the steak frites + I ordered the beef burger of the month.  I didn't try my boyfriend's plate but the burger was good - you can't go wrong with a good burger.  And for dessert, we had the double chocolate bread pudding - very good.  From start to finish, everything was just so enjoyable.  Their menu is very diverse + has options available for all tastes - I really appreciated it.\\n\\nService was good - everyone we interacted with was pleasant.  I never felt like we were being rushed by our server and we really got to enjoy every course!

There is not quantitative way to do it, but this is my opinion based on my experience.

This place is overpriced and overrated.\\n\\nIssue 1: drinks. Yes, we folded and ordered one of the flashy goblet drinks. My friend and I decided to split the \\"ocean blue\\" drink. The menu photo shows multiple gummy sharks floating around inside. When ours was served to us it had 1. Not a huge deal but kind of weird that the photo showed at least 6. We were both convinced that there was no alcohol in it. It was also $30 which I expected but definitely not worth the price at all. \\n\\nIssue 2: the menu. The server gave us time to review the menu then started taking our order. A member of my party attempted to order a flat bread and at that point the server thought it would be helpful to inform us that they were out of all flatbreads, crepes  and \\"anything with a star next to it.\\" This essentially knocked out half of the already limited menu. I ordered a burger which was lackluster at best. My sisters husband ordered a burger as well and the waiter came back 5 minutes later to tell him they were out of the cheese he requested. Awesome. This place clearly has an issue with their inventory. \\n\\nIssue 3: service time. My fianc√© received his beer in 5 minutes, I received my drink in about 10 minutes and the other member of my party didn't get hers until another 5 minutes after that. I don't feel that it's good etiquette to serve a round of drinks in 3 different time increments but maybe that's just me. The food also took a very long time to come out.\\n\\nIssue 4: food quality.

Made my reservation on that \\"other\\" site, showed up on time, and um... well... didn't expect a bungalow. Ok, maybe not a bungalow, but the seedy hotel looking thing next door (it's upscale offices and evidently quite safe) made me think twice about my decision to be ITP after the sun went down. Fortunately, my fears were put to rest, and I may be seen lurking around ITP more often... \\n\\nEnough about my idiotic superstitions about ITP - on to Aria. This place is 5 stars in almost everything. They lose one for the aggressive pimping of the bar. It was almost disney-like. \\"You WILL have a drink won't you? No, come on, have a drink. Here - have a seat, then have a drink.\\" \\"Your table will be ready in a few minutes\\" \\"Here - what would you like to drink?\\" ARGH. Enough. I don't want a drink just yet ok? please? pretty please with - dare I say it - DRINKS on top?\\n\\nAnyway - that was the end of what was really just a minor annoyance. In fact, I made way too much of it. I'm sure they wanted to provide a great experience. Once we made our way out of the REALLY dark bar into the blindingly white dining room, we discovered that our table was ready for us all along. Which, really makes me wonder what the deal with the drink was... \\n\\nAnyway, we started with the Lobster Cocktail. It was off the hook great. Better than good. Not really enough superlatives to describe how unexpectedly fantastic this was. I'm pretty sure my date really liked it too. If you go to Aria, get a drink for God's sake - and order the Lobster Cocktail. You won't be sorry (unless you have an allergy to shellfish. The lobster cocktail won't do much for you if you do).\\n\\nI ordered the scallops with mushroom risotto, and she ordered the Halibut (I think it was halibut). Both dishes were fantastic. I can't ever remember better food at a restaurant.\\n\\n\\"We\\" finished it with the warm chocolate cheesecake. I say we only because I was somewhat tricked into getting it under the auspices that she would help me eat it. I definitely don't need it - but got it. And she split it with me, so it's all good. And by split it with me, I mean she watched me devour it as if I hadn't seen food in months. The cheesecake was ridiculous - it was that good. She didn't know what she missed.\\n\\nAnyway - the light in the dining room. Hmm - how to best describe it? I'll just call it art and leave it at that. It's phallic, but also looks a bit like a jellyfish. Art. I'll leave it at art.\\n\\nMy final thought on the experience: The service was exactly what you would expect from fine dining. It's outstanding.\\n\\nI can't recommend this place enough. I really enjoyed dinner tonight. 2/3 of my enjoyment was the person I was with, but the food is fantastic! It's inventive (to steal Annie R's words), the menu is very diverse, and it is just really really really good food. \\n\\nI think we'll be back. It's very high on my list.

Everything in the salad worked really well together and I enjoyed every bite mixed together with the egg yolk the mushrooms and the smokey saltiness from the salmon chunks.   So worth ordering.  The fried chicken had an amazing skin that was crunchy, flavorful, and had a little bit of a spicy kick to make it special.  The chicken was juicy and tender and cooked perfectly inside.  I could only finish half of it, but I saved it along with the chicken tenders my kids couldn't finish and saved it for a little snackiepoo for later.  Everything she suggested was phenomenal.

I must have missed the memo, but apparently if you work at the Statehouse you have to love this place. For so many of my co-workers, this is the place to be. I no longer work at the Statehouse, so now I hear nothing about Plank's. But when I did, I heard about it all the time.\\n\\nI'm still confused to this day why people love that place so much. To me, there's nothing at all special about it. Maybe it was the gossip that went on here, though, because when I'd come to work the whole Statehouse was abuzz about what happened at Plank's the night before. Everyone, from interns to politicians went here, and when they mix outside of the office, drama undoubtedly happened. But I never got into that whole scene. When I was done with work for the day, I was done, I didn't want all that crap taking up my personal life as well. But for all these people who their jobs are their lives, and that's most of the people who work at the Statehouse, this is their place to unwind after work and create the next day's water cooler conversation topics.\\n\\nAnyway, the only times I have been to Plank's, were, naturally, for work parties. I usually avoided these, but I did attend a few here and there. For the ones that I went to, someone would rent out the entire \\"banquet?\\" room area. The big room with tables. Whatever it's called there. Then they'd bring out pizza and we'd have a keg or two of beer. Alright. Free beer and pizza, can't go wrong there. Or can you?\\n\\nI hated parking here. Very rarely was I able to get a spot in the back in their parking lot. The last time I was there I found a spot in front on High St. I guess it wasn't so bad, but I usually have to drive around a bit before I find anything. The entrance is weird. You go around to the back, then go through this door. Right there is the door to the bathroom (so to get to the restrooms you're almost walking out the front door) and then you walk into the main area with the bar and some seating. You walk around the bar in a \\"U\\" shape, and go through this other door and down a step or two into the area where our little parties always were. This place smells downright funky. Musty, like old wet shoes or something. Very unappetizing. Outside and in it looks like a cute little German drinking hole. It's not much to look at, and I've never seen it busy besides our big private parties.\\n\\nPeople always rave about the pizza here. I don't see it. Maybe I think it tastes weird because of the odd stench invading my nostrils, but I also think the pizza is really lifeless. Bland and boring. The crust is thin and chewy, cardboard-y. The sauce is kind of sweet, but not all that zesty. The good news is that there is a lot of cheese on the pizzas, but it's mostly burnt. And this is some really, really greasy pizza. Like you have grease running down your hand when you pick it up. Make sure you have plenty of napkins. We'd have other pizza options, like pepperoni and mushroom. Those were good, but again, nothing really great about them. The pizza is good drunk food for those who are hungry and just don't care.\\n\\nThere is a pretty decent back patio, but I've never sat out here because it's a dead zone every single time I've been here. The room is nice enough if you can get past the smell. There are plenty of tables and chairs and TVs line the walls. It's not all that bad, but I would never choose to go here if there weren't free beer. The kegs at our parties were self-serve, so no bartenders helping us out, which was fine. So I can't really speak to the service. But at least the bathrooms have been clean and stocked up. \\n\\nIt's definitely not the worst place, but I don't see what's special, either. I do know that once the beer runs out I'm outta there because there aren't any drink specials going on and it could easily get expensive. Plus, it was always a good guideline to give yourself to prevent getting drunk and sloppy in front of the people you work with on a daily basis. I never wanted to be the topic of the next-day office gossip."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Best soul food restaurant in Portland.

This is their signature meat for a reason. The meat is soft as butter, super juicy, literally melts in your mouth, and has a flavorful peppery seasoned crust on the outside. I would have been perfectly happy if the Brisket was the only thing I ate after the four-hour wait but the Ribs were also some of the best I have ever had. The Ribs were tender, fell off the bone, and full of flavor. The Sausage was also really good and filled with flavorful spices. We also had some Pulled Pork which was decent but mostly untouched since we filled up on all the other meats. We also had a side of Potato Salad that added a nice carb and creamy break to all the meat and an appetizing Pecan Pie, which added a nice sweetness and crunch to end our very filling meal.

Normally we go here for late-nite, but today I had a chance to try out the dinner option.  Ninkazu is the sister restaurant of Tomokazu (whoda guessed?), and therefore a certain style can be expected if you've been there.\\n\\nDinner is $28 after tax + tip.  The variety is very competitive.  The main items that stuck out here were the raw oyster and, as well as grilled chicken wings (they also have the BBQ variety) both of which you find in the competition).\\n\\nThe service is a bit slower than the competition, but everything we ordered showed up.\\n\\nThe efficiency rating here is 50%.  By that I mean that if you put 10 orders of an item on your sheet, they bring you 5.  I am not sure why ayce places do this, but it forces you to order more than you really plan on eating \\n\\nJello is served in large chunks, just like at Tomokazu.  The tempura shrimp had a bit too much batter, but fortunately that can be picked off.\\n\\nMy biggest gripe is parking.  The lot is WAY too small for the strip mall where this is located.  I had to park in 20min zone and periodically look out the window to make sure a tow truck didn't show up.  So did my friend, and the guy who parked next to me (he and his buddies were also eating at Ninkazu).  The other option is to park at Aberdeen Centre across the street, then cross your fingers that you don't get towed.\\n\\nAs for the good.. well, you can pick one of ayce Hot Pot or ayce Sashimi option with your dinner (but not both).  So you can mix it up here.  Also, the view from the 2nd floor is not bad at all.\\n\\nOverall not a bad place, but the parking is a real showstopper for me.

My bad y'all.  Soooooo, I finally ate here for the first time today for bunch.  Their acclaimed Sunday gospel brunch.  My friend and I made it a little late for our 1PM reservation but while waiting on my dining partner the line outside for the 1PM seating was all waiting outside.  I had always heard mixed reviews about their BBQ and after living here for five years I realize how divisive BBQ can be.  Well, first off, the buffet is OUTSIDE on the patio.  To me that's pretty damn weird.  It's damn near 100 degrees outside and they have a line of chaffing dishes outside on one table and a carving station on another table.  The spread is pretty good but that late in the day they weren't really replenishing things as quickly.  The food wasn't that bad though.  They had 'migas' but it seemed more like scrambled eggs with cheese.  The biscuits seemed like the crappy frozen heat and serve and well, damn near everything seemed prefabricated.  That said, I DO realize this is a BBQ joint.  Their brisket was super lean and super tender but we didn't have any sauce on our table.  You may ask yourself \\"why didn't you ask your server?\\"  The answer to that would be \\"because we only saw our server like 4 times\\".  Once to get our drink order, one to drop off our drink order, once to refill our drinks and once to drop off our checks.

Since I had major gum surgery just five days prior to the event, I unfortunately could not eat any of Wright's heralded sandwiches. Instead, I had to settle on their soups of the day. I ordered both: gazpacho and cream of yellow squash. The two soups rang up to $7.49 after tax.\\n\\nThe gazpacho was cold and citrusy. It was nice and chunky and contained a variety of raw vegetables including celery and cucumber. I should've known better than to order this soup because my mouth was still a war zone with healing wounds/surgical sites and sutures galore. The cold temperature of the soup caused a lot of pain to my super sensitive teeth and the acidity from the tomato base caused my gums to burn like hell. After 2-3 gingerly slurps and suffering through the ensuing pain, I gave my bowl to Angela M who subsequently seemed to enjoy it.\\n\\nThe cream of yellow squash was much better for my mouth. I let it cool down to slightly warmer than ambient temp. It was delicious -- slightly sweet, creamy, smooth, and satisfying. It hit the spot. It was a pretty simple soup. There were kernels of corn in it too.\\n\\nMy friends ordered a variety of sandwiches and they looked great. Big and filling. I was envious. Wright's has over 20 different varieties that include sammies like the Cuban, fried green tomato BLT, muffuletta, pimento, Reuben, and shrimp po' boy. Each sandwich costs about $8-10.\\n\\nWright's also sells salads, dips, spreads, and various desserts like cakes, cookies, and cupcakes.

WRONG! It was way overpriced. For the amount of money you pay you hope the food is at least decent. It was pretty awful. Don't even upgrade to the lobster or steak if you go b/c it will be the lowest grade frozen crap they can find. Our waiter made sure to let us know up front we were only getting 1 pitcher of soda for the 2 of us and we only got 2 of those for the whole night. With how much ice they put in those things and how salty the food was, it wasn't very much soda. The show was pretty lame of course. It was comical at first and people participated, but then it just got boring and we lost interest. It really was a looong show. Way too long. If they cut it by a 1/2 hour it probably wouldn't have been as horrific. Towards the end, our waiter sticks a tip tray down and tells us that its not mandatory, but it's recommended.....blah blah and they give you the recommended tip scale as a reminder on the tray. Well, we felt since our dinner wasn't done yet and the show was still going it wasn't appropriate to place our tip down just yet. The waiter comes back to us and says \\"are you done with this yet?\\" referring to our tip tray! How rude. He pretty much was done with us and never came back to offer us anything since we didn't immediately give him his tip.  I'm sure he didn't mind since then he could slack off in the back of the theatre. That pretty much turned us off completely from this dumpy place. Go to medieval times or Sleuths if you're looking for a dinner theatre for adults. If you have little kids that aren't going to care what's going on, like shiny swords, shitty food, and you don't mind spending a fortune--you probably won't mind going to this place."},{"name":"21st Century Pizza","address":"1221 SW Jefferson St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I don't know what's going on with all the raving reviews here.

It reminds me a lot of Dominoes in that it doesn't have a crispy exterior, just doughy and chewy all the way through. The sauce was okay, it had a little spice to it, which I liked.

There was plenty of cheese but on most of the slices the cheese and sauce covered the entire pizza, leaving no crust. \\n\\nMy major complaint is that it's cooked in a rotary over, not in a pizza oven. It really messes with the texture of dough. I feel like for the same quality I could've gone to Safeway across the street and bought a buy and bake pizza. \\n\\nI give them two stars.

Very disappointing.  The pork ribs, which for me are the benchmark of barbecue, were dry and lacked flavor, and the sauce was unremarkable. The brisket was the best meat we had here - at least more flavorful and tender than the ribs or pulled pork. The sides were also not memorable, except for the Frito pie, which was pretty authentic for a place outside Texas hill country.  We also liked the jalapeno poppers. \\n\\nFox Bros bills itself as Texas barbecue, which tends to be more about beef than pork - so if pork is your thing, I definitely wouldn't recommend it.

Once again, hype is great for business.\\n\\nThe Bad\\nI have tried to go here twice. The first time I got there around 11. Everyone running the Cap 10K must have been craving barbecue this particular Saturday. The line went to the back end of their parking lot already so I had to give up. Didn't feel like waiting an hour to realize I wasn't gonna get any brisket. The second time my friend arrived early since he was in Downtown. He was there around 11:30 and was not too far from the door so we waited it out. Still took us a long time to order and we were getting hungry as we waited. Watching the guys in the back slice up brisket was borderline waterboarding. \\n\\nThe Food\\nWe wanted to make sure we tried every meat on the menu so here's how it went. The sausage wasn't anything that made me go insane. Spicy with good texture. The pulled pork was a bit dry and needed a good amount of one of their sauces. The brisket was good. Cut thick, juicy and tender. Melt in your mouth kind of work. The ribs in my mind were the best part of this meal. The ribs were a little too soft and fell off the bone as I picked it up so it became something like a knife and fork operation. The seasonings along with the careful smoke leave the outside of the slab with a great crust. The turkey was moist and had a crust similar to the brisket.\\n\\nWe also ordered the potato salad and the cole slaw. The potato salad was good. Not too much mayo or mustard. The amount of egg in the salad held everything together nicely. The cole slaw was the better side though. Don't recall it enough to describe it well but I did like that more.\\n\\nFranklin leaves various barbecue sauces on the table. The expresso has the very distinct expresso flavor that you taste once you bite in. The more liquidy sauce was by far my favorite flavor but I didn't like how runny it was. The last sauce was a sweet barbecue sauce. That bottle was more than half gone when we left the table, stupid gluttons.\\n\\nThe service here was beyond friendly. The butcher gave us extra meat and the cashier was very courteous. The cost wasn't outrageous. When an employee told us that they no longer let you BYOB, they let us finish our beers and didn't say it in a derogatory way either.\\n\\nI want to try the Tipsy Texan next time.

I already told my friend that buffet is not my thing and I may order off the menu instead. \\n\\nI took a quick peek at the buffet tables after we got seated. Man, it was unappealing. Why is there Chinese food in a Japanese steak house? (Besides the point that this is opened by Chinese) Lo Mein, Chicken Wings, Chix on the stick, Shu Mai, etc. Some sushi of course. I didn't take the bait. My friends that stuck with it said it wasn't that great. They had to run up many times because they don't keep the buffet filled generously. When I was taking a peek, it was as if it was scraps here and there. Totally not appealing. Bamboo has much better selection on the Chinese and Sushi according to my friends.\\n\\nI asked for the menu. What you know, there is no lunch menu. I'm stuck with Shabu or Sushi. I went the Shabu route. A5, sirloin set meal for $12. I gave my order and then the server asked what kind of soup base. I told him the basic one. When that came out, I didn't think much of it besides that one half was cloudy and the other half was clear. After tasting it, it turns out half was miso soup and the other half was wonton soup broth. Am I retarded or are they? After my meal was served, I asked for sesame sauce for my beef, the server goes, \\"let me to ask, I don't know what you sesame sauce you are talking about.\\" Thank gawd someone in the restaurant knows since the sauce that came out was correct.\\n\\nThe veggie plate with the meal consists of: Nappa, Spinach, Watercrest, Taro, Daikon, Shitake, Carrot, Corn. Not the best selection, but doable. It comes with a choice of rice or udon. I picked udon but it's not the type of udon I like so I didn't try it. I prefer the Japanese udon and not the Chinese udon. \\n\\nAs for the beef, I ordered sirlion; but I'm pretty sure what I got was short rib.

That was really nice; there are a lot of places you go to and they'll seat you at the worst table, even if the place is empty. \\n\\nOk. Here is where things take a turn. We were left with our menus for at least 15-20 minutes, without even a drink order. Luckily, we were engaged in conversation, so we didn't walk out. Finally, our waitress returned and asked for our drink order and took our food order too. She came back with our drinks pretty quickly and the appetizers came shortly after. Oh, by the way, the wine list was pretty decent. \\n\\nFor appetizers, we had the lahmejoune and hommous. I read from the yelp reviews that the hommous was so good that it could be eaten with just a spoon. I completely disagree. Hommous--not so good. The lahmejoune was decent.

The food was better going in than coming out.\\n\\nFor starters, we got the Onion Bhajee, which was fried onion patties with dipping sauce.  These were decently flavored but a little too greasy for my taste.  It was battered about right with some good sauces.\\n\\nWe then got some Garlic Naan bread which was very good.  Nice and soft and the right amount of seasoning - perfect for dipping into the main dish sauce.\\n\\nFor a main I had the Chicken Tikka Masala.  This was also very well flavored and had a mild sauce with chicken and rice.  The chicken was good quality but not great.  My biggest detractor was the lack of veggies with the meal as it was pretty much chicken, sauce and rice.\\n\\nLastly, this place lost a star because I spent just about the entire next day in the bathroom.

I'm so much of a garlic lover that I double it in recipes that call for it. That when I'm cooking with garlic, I nibble at itty bitty raw slices. That I don't even shy away from garlic breath. Not joking. So if there's not just garlic but \\"more and more garlic\\" on the pizza, then I'm so there.\\n\\nI'm not just a garlic lover but apparently a dork. It took me three tries to actually find the place. Found the parking lot and the convenience store just fine, but I didn't realize you were supposed to enter *through* the convenience store to get there. You can't see it through the store windows because it's tucked sneakily into an invisible corner. No one ever worked so hard to be a best-kept secret!\\n\\nAnd so I had a couple of silly moments where I was wandering around the more vacant corners of the building, which was, at the time, surrounded by construction equipment. Turned out they were closed while under construction anyway.\\n\\nWhen I finally found it, I was charmed. Just an adorable little alcove full of pizza smells and warmth. The oven kept the tiny room a perfect temperature for that chilly, windy night. And the people were just so friendly and attentive, I almost felt like I was a guest in their dining room. The counter seating is ideal for solo diners of both the sociable and the not-so-much varieties, and the two tables can probably make couples feel like they're in a private corner when they're only an arm's width off. I liked the mirror on the back wall that lets you see inside the oven if you're sitting at the counter.\\n\\nI got my Barcelona to go, though, and boy was it tasty. No disappointment in the garlic area whatsoever. The sauce was divine and the crust hit the spot. The only problem was that there was not enough \\"there\\" there. It was a $10 pizza that came nowhere near to filling me up. Not even close. I imagine that the cheese pizzas are more filling, but the cheeseless Barcelona really needs something more to build it up. While I wouldn't say no to still more garlic, I suspect perhaps some kind of dense veggie would be better -- portobello, maybe? Dunno. The pizza crafters at Bono could probably come up with something.\\n\\nI will go back if I end up with a pizza lover to take out who doesn't know about Bono yet. It's totally the kind of place that you show off to people so they can say, \\"Wow! How did you ever find this place?!\\" Being hard to find isn't enough; it wouldn't be that kind of place if it weren't good. But sadly, it's not a great value for us cheese-free folks."},{"name":"Masa","address":"439 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"After reading all the great reviews here, I had to try this place...so we went there afterwork for their happy hour menu at the bar, I mean...how bad can $1 tapas be?\\n\\nNote: Do NOT sit at the bar area. \\n\\nMaybe that was our major mistake, we should've had a real dinner at the dining area because the service was really, REALLY bad at the bar tables (even tho there were a couple of designated waiters there).

In fact, the good experience and good people we were surrounded by played a small role in our decision to move to the area.\\n\\nThe reason for the 4-star review instead of a 5-star review is two-fold. Firstly, the price is what you'd expect for a Fenway-area meal-- slightly overpriced for the portion size. While the food is spectacular, I don't expect to become a weekly regular mostly due to the prices. Secondly, the service was only mediocre, especially considering this place had just opened. I read an article that mentioned that the owner hasn't had much experience as a server, and so my recommendation would be to focus energy in this area. Having been a waitress, I understand it's a tough job, but the restaurant could benefit from some top-down management in this area, as other reviews have also noted.

The deals were a little unbelievable... I was at Valero pumping gas, and a high school kid walks up to me and hands me a $4 six inch sandwich with chips and a drink coupon. So I drove over (only several paces over, but I'm lazy), and saw huge signs for other foot-long subs for $4, $5, etc. \\n\\nFood: I got a 6 inch tempura shrimp sub on white bread, chips, drink for $FOUR BUCKS! I'm not sure how they can do it, but if they keep up these prices, they'll be whooping Subway and Quizno's asses for sure (or, you know, the opposite). The sandwich itself was damn yummy. The combination of crunchy fried shrimp on soft, thick toasted bread with veggies (lettuce and  carrots for me) and a hit of chipotle mayo (for a little spicyness) worked out perfectly! Everything tasted fresh, and the carrots had a hint of sweetness (pickled carrots, I think. Sounds weird, but it works well for some reason). \\n\\nService: It looks like a family-run restaurant. It was a little difficult to understand the owners' accents, but they had a couple of employees to translate and smiled the entire time which says a lot in my opinion. \\n\\nCleanliness: Clean.

My two daughters and two granddaughters had planned a wonderful Mother's Day Tea for me on Saturday, May 12. We had a reservation and everyone got all dressed up anticipating a fun-filled tea time! When we entered this tiny little room, we were disappointed to see that all 3 tables were taken, even though we had a reservation. Two very young, unprofessional boys (approximately 14-18 years) pushed two tables together in the back along a wall and we were seated in hard metal chairs. Some time passed and a tablecloth of some sort was pushed on the table. We weren't given any water, napkins or silverware but after 15-20 minutes we were handed a tea menu to decide on two teas. Another 15 minutes went by and we were asked for our tea preferences and a 3-tiered tray was brought to the table with 3 blueberry scones cut in half and 3 cheddar cheese biscuits along with some strawberry jam and something resembling lemon curd (but not quite). We asked about our tea and the youngest boy brought out glass irish coffee mugs for our tea and the tea was poured from a french press designed to brew coffee and was then taken back to the kitchen. We were never given any cream or sugar for our tea. After sitting for about 50 minutes with nothing to eat except the 3 inferior scones and biscuits, I got up and spoke to the oldest boy about being displeased with the service and the food. He had his mother come out to speak to me and I told her that we were extremely disappointed in the haphazard, very unprofessional service and had expected a traditional tea experience with china cups, tea pots, lots of delicious little finger sandwiches and other savories along with delicate desserts. She quickly replaced the glass coffee mugs with white ceramic cups (maybe melamine?) and a pathetic plate of minute (maybe 8 little squares per sandwich) little chicken salad sandwiches (complete with crust!), and equally minute cucumber cream cheese sandwiches. The \\"dessert\\" plate was 2 mini vanilla cupcakes and 2 mini chocolate cupcakes, half-frozen from Publix, and 2 little \\"shortbread\\" cookies as we were told that's all they had! The entire experience was inexcusable and so, so disappointing! A complete rip-off! I'd just like to warn others that my daughters were charged the full price for the tea even though the owner was fully aware our experience was less than delightful! My 5-year old granddaughter was served two teeny, tiny little flattened pb&j triangles (probably 6 or so per sandwich!) and we were charged for her as well!

What really irks me was the service.  It took forever for food cart people to come to my direction and when they were near me they were diagonally away and couldn't see me.  The waiter didn't even refill my water or take some of the food baskets when I was finished with it.  I'd rather go back to China Pearl for Dim Sum instead of He Lo Moon."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Is it EVEN possible?

One thing to note is that on weekdays not many varieties of dishes are presented, so it might be useful to complement the dimsum with a noodle dish or rice. Another thing: once in a while they throw in an experiemental item: this time it was bits of taro, celery, and cilantro inside a sticky rice flour wrapper.\\n\\nDinner was fine as well. Be sure to order off the Chinese only menu as that menu is the only one that has the group dinners (2-person, 3-person, etc.). Ours came with a seafood and vegetable dish, a fried rice, a seafood soup with crab and fish stomach, and a ginger/scallion stir-fried lobster.

It's quite trendy, I love the music they play, and the exposed brick is nice. I believe they took over the area Lily Mae was in. They offer complimentary infused water, two types, which is awesome. First time I was there, I remember one was a pineapple ginger. Second time around it was grapefruit, or cucumber mint. The food is also affordable and decent, which is why I decided to get the gift card.\\n\\nAlthough it is not table service, after you order, you can choose your seats and then they will bring your order on a tray to you when it's ready. I thought this was nice since we decided to sit upstairs! They even provide forks (for the fries).\\n\\nI've read mixed reviews about the portions. Personally, eating one bao and sharing a small kimchi fries is enough for me, lunch or dinner. It's a lot of filling carbs, after all. Not to mention with a Yelp check in, you can get free bao beignets, which will fill you up further.\\n\\nYVR ($7): seared albacore tuna, avocado, wasabi mayo, baby pea shoots, bacon bits, and more. This was very good. Although messy, it had a good balance of slightly seared tuna, veggies, and sauce. The flavours were good.\\n\\nBao chicka bao bao ($6): fried chicken, garlic, cilantro, pickled carrots. Preferred the YVR. It's fried chicken in a bun, essentially.\\n\\nNote that I found the bao itself to be room temperature / cold. My only complaint is that they should freshly steam these before filling and serving them.\\n\\nKimchi fries ($5 for small): crispy seasoned fries, crispy pork belly, bean sprouts, kimchi, and sauces. The small is actually a very good portion. I could probably have this by itself as a meal. The vegetarian option is to have mushrooms instead of the pork belly. The crispy pork belly was a bit dry. The fries were not soggy despite the loads of sauce and kimchi on top. Highly recommend.\\n\\nBao beignets ($4 or free with Yelp check-in): basically their bao pieces cut up and deep fried, then rolled in sugar and coconut. It's an interesting dessert, but due to sweetness I got sick of eating them after a few. It could be a filler for the end of the meal if you need it.\\n\\nI think this is a great place to try at least once. My friends went on a food crawl and visited 4 places in Gastown - this one being the first - and they both agreed that this was their favourite. The complimentary infused water is a nice touch.

Wow!  (but that was bc there were only 2 of us).

Maybe it was just bc they were so slammed packed on a Sat. night.  We will definitely give this place another shot on a NON-weekend night, with hopes that the food will be just as tasty, but HOT next time (as it should be).\\n\\nOH, for those of you debating between getting the pulled pork or brisket, as we we were unsure, highly suggest getting the Combo platter which entails 1/2 pork & 1/2 beef brisket (with 2 sides).

I typically just order a cheese pizza, no additional toppings. I feel like a good pizza place should have a cheese pie that stands on it's own. I actually enjoyed the sauce, but I also asked for additional sauce on the side which I never received. The crust was less than desirable, too chewy, and burnt on the bottom which ruined the first few bites, but got better towards the crust. The cheese used was very cheap, almost rubbery in consistency, so much so that one bite is liable to pull the rest of the cheese off of the slice with it. All in all, most places lack a good sauce, this place had great sauce but skimps on everything else. It has potential to be a good pie, but the love is just not there and you can tell, from the lack of attention to detail, to the cheap ingredients that are used. I hope this review helps future customers to make an informed decision, and also helps the business to realize that it's not all just about the bottom line, but it's about caring enough about your food to stand behind it and know \\"this is the best you're going to find,\\" I can confidently say, at this time \\"Mi Pizza\\" is far from the best you're going to find out there.

You know it's sweet when you get your glass you see that the bottom half of your glass is cloudy. Then after you eat a few ribs you see the cloud settled on the bottom and you realize that it was a cloud of sugar. Man it's sweet, but it is so good. Remember how I said my friend had his wedding rehearsal dinner catered?  My friend and I took the leftovers with the sweet tea (2 and a half gallons leftover) back to our hotel room and chugged the tea. yeah you could say we were on a sugar rush for a while.

No decorations or charm to speak of, and the place was chilly, but clean. \\n\\nThe good: huge portions. YUGE. Both of our lunch combos came heaped with our entrees and sides of pork fried rice, and I got two more meals out of the leftovers. Lots of bang for your buck here. The entrees were hot and freshly made, and the food came out quickly. My mom's kung pao shrimp had lots of shrimp (heads- and tails-off) and both our entrees had a good amount of veggies beyond the requisite celery and carrots. \\n\\nThe bad: the soup that came with our lunches was lukewarm, and the rice was barely room temperature. Obviously no one expects soup or fried rice made to order, but would keeping it hot be too much to ask? Both of our entrees were labeled as spicy but neither had a hint of heat to them. In fact, both were very sweet. I asked for chili oil, but even after liberally dousing my Szechuan chicken in it I could barely detect any spice. All too clear that this place caters to the basest of American palates with sugary-sweet flavors even in dishes touted as hot. The lunch menu is very meat-heavy - my mom, who's a pescatarian, had the choice of sweet & sour shrimp or kung pao tofu or shrimp. That's all. \\n\\nService was very abrupt and nearly non-existent. I don't think we saw the server/owner smile once during the entirety of our meal, and she barely uttered a \\"thanks\\" as we paid and handed her a tip before leaving. \\n\\nThis place is fine if you're in the area and looking for a quick, filling, and cheap meal.

I've been here quite a few times and service has always been casual but never bad...until tonight.\\n\\nWe walk in, party of three, the restaurant is maybe 1/3-1/2 full.  We're seated, check out the menus decide what we want and then wait for one of the waitresses to take our order.  And wait.  And wait.  Finally the bartender, yes, the bartender, comes over and checks with us to see if he can get us any drinks.  Instead we give him our order because we're hungry.  I forgot to ask for some Johnny Cakes so we figure we'll just ask one of the waitresses when they walk by.  But the two waitresses working the front of the restaurant/patio (collectively, maybe 3-5 tables) systematically ignore us.  It was almost an art form how they managed to swoop their gaze over and away from us just for that one second as they passed by our table.  When the bartender eventually returned to set our table I ask for some Johnny Cakes which come over not a full minute later (Yay, food!).  Then I notice that he's also serving another couple at an adjacent table to ours, and that there is another waitress taking care of 3-4 tables in the back of the restaurant by herself which I previously hadn't noticed.  \\n\\nEventually I noticed one of our entrees was sitting in the pass as the chef hit the bell for service.  Over the next 5 minutes all three of the waitresses saw the food sitting there and did nothing.  Eventually the bartender grabbed it and brought it over as well as the wings for the other person in our party.  So fried chicken and wings are on the table but not my wrap....okay....  About another 2 minutes later I notice my wrap put up on the pass and am watching to see if any of the wait staff/bartender will notice it.  The waitresses again see it but don't do anything.  The highlight of my meal was the 5-10 second moment I had with the chef at the pass who saw that I was watching and waiting for that wrap and hit the bell for service again.  I motioned to ask if I should just come up and get it and he motioned an apologetic no and yelled to the bartender that the wrap was up.  The bartender finishes putting a bunch of clean glasses away and then picks up my wrap and drops it off.  Not once did I get an apology for the wait or (lack of) service.  Not once did anyone come and check on us during the length of our meal.  \\n\\nNow I want to be perfectly clear: the food was lovely and I wanted to go over and thank the kitchen staff, especially that one chef at the pass bar, but the rest of the service was atrocious.   And I don't mean to get down on the bartender for his lack-lustre service but it wasn't good and what made it worse was that it shouldn't have been his job to take care of us.  One waitress was running around taking care of the tables on the patio and doing jobs like spooning butter into ramekins.  While the other waitress in the front of the restaurant seemed to be taking care of one table on the patio and waiting practically hand and foot on the table of three guys right beside us.  \\n\\nI might go back to The Reef, but not likely to this location.

My conclusion is that the food is only as good as people say IF you haven't had really excellent barbecue anywhere else.  In other words, Fox Bros. may be the best BBQ in Atlanta proper, but it ain't the best BBQ within reasonable driving distance (which, for the record, I think is about an hour).  I've definitely had better.\\n\\nThe fried pickles were great--I had actually never had them before.  Crunchy, sour, and totally addictive.  Boyfriend's brisket was bland and not very warm, as were the tots and fried okra on the side.  I had a bit more luck--the chicken was really good, with a great smoky flavor and surprising moistness.  The pulled pork was respectable, though I would have liked a little finer pull.  I didn't put BBQ sauce on anything, since the smoke flavor was so prevalent--but speaking of the BBQ sauce, it was way too watery for my liking.  It did have a nice smoky chile flavor, though.  The mac 'n cheese was nothing special, thought it was hot, which I appreciated.  The potato salad had potential, but it didn't have any zip or tang or anything--so it fell into the bland category with most of the side dishes.\\n\\nAn app, a one-meat platter, and a two-meat platter, plus a pitcher of 420, and we were out almost $60 bucks (with tip).

For that, I give Hei La Moon a 4-star, not because I don't know better, but because there ain't much choices in Boston.\\n\\nI like how the restaurant is spacious, the dining rooms are clean and the decor is extremely traditional Chinese--kinda lame but also cute. I always order shrimp dumplings, chicken feet, tripe, and the noodle thingy w/ shrimp inside ( I don't know how to call those in English). Sometime I also get congee, sweet tofu soup, some fried taro shrimp cake stuff,  shu mai and sticky rice chicken in lotus leaf.\\n\\nNothing comes close to what one'd expect in China, Taiwan or HK, but here in Boston/Mass, there's only two other places (windsor, and the huge weird place in Saugus) that I think match up to Hei La Moon."},{"name":"Berkshire Farms Market","address":"1 Harborside Dr","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"I am always happy to see healthier food options in airports and Berkshire Farms Market seems to do a good job at focusing on fruits, veggies, and local products.

We arrived and were happy to see it looked like  a bbq place, not a strip mall.  \\nWe walked in the door and saw the large and simple menu on the wall.  I placed and order for a 1/2 rack of ribs, bbq beans and collard greens.  The other guys all ordered the chopped pork sandwich with various sides. \\nMy ribs showed up and they looked great, not soaked in sauce, just brushed a bit at the end of the smoking.  \\nIt was love at first bite.  The meat was cooked perfectly, not falling off the bone but close, still firm and meaty but not over done.  Nothing dry about this bbq, smoky, succulent and delicious.  Right about the time the food showed up the band on the tiny stage playing some blues.  I drum machine, guitar and saxophone.  The music shuffled on and was a perfect accompaniment to the food.  The beans were a bit too sweet for but good.  The collard greens were spot on perfect!  Absolutely perfect, a bite, some spice, texture, everything was perfect.  Now I'll explain why  personally didn't give Fatt Matt 5 stars, the dipping sauce.  I am in small minority of people that doesn't love the taste of vinegar and the dipping sauce had a lot.  It was totally unnecessary to dunk the ribs in sauce but they offer it and I didn't like it.  Most people will probably like the sauce just fine but for me it was too tart and didn't compliment the smoked meat or the crispy bits that had caramelized on the edges of the meat.  \\n\\nThe ambiance is great in the room with picnic tables, cold beer, sweet tea and  live music.

The chicken was hard and chewy, the shrimp in the dynamite roll was so thin that it was laughable. The batter was as if it was shrimp that was fried a second time after not getting served the first. The Spicy Salmon, which used to be my favorite dish from this restaurant, has been terrible each time I've ordered it (more than just the last three times). It's as if it's being filled with the scrap left over salmon which they dare not serve as regular sashimi.\\n\\nMy disappointment of how the quality of food from this restaurant has just been growing over the last year.

Everything was difficult to eat because the sauce overpowered the bread, the bread was too soggy to enjoy, and everything was prepared in the most unappealing way.  Ribs were over sauced, fatty, and was in broken pieces.  Chicken was cold, skin was rubbery and the meat was too tuff. For $20, I purchased a slice of pie, the investment for what I was craving was wasted.  I wonder if I would have chosen to dine in, would I have received the same order...im sure I would not have.

We just paid $140 for two bites of sausage, two bites of hash brown, two bites of hush-puppy, a bowl of chili, a bowl of farrow soup, a serving of pulled pork and a decent rabbit dish. What a rip off.  As soon as we sat down, I realized we were being treated like we were at a used car dealership. Our waiter insisted we needed to order a fettine, a first course, a second course, and a main. She then plopped down a wine list and menu and walked away. Five minutes later, she asked if I was done looking at the 6 page long wine list and ready for her to start \\"going over the menu with us.\\" We obliged and she began her 5 minute long canned speech describing the various wild game dishes, etc. Everything sounded wonderful so we ordered the lobster hush puppies and the rattlesnake/rabbit sausage. Five minutes later, she came back with no food and asked if we were ready to order our second course. Sure...So I ordered a bowl of \\"Texas Red\\", AKA Chili, and my wife ordered the Farro \\"congee.\\" Five minutes after that, still with no food, she asked if we were ready to order out mains. Sure...so I ordered the pork crepinette and my wife ordered the rabbit three ways. Immediately after that, we got our first course. Literally 4 bites averaging $5 per bite. Again, this was one bite of mediocre sausage staked to a crappy hash-brown that cost $5. Our second course was delicious but way too big. Our waitress brought out the best bowl of chili I've ever had. It was amazing, but it was H-U-G-E. It was a meal sized bowl of chili. My wife's bowl of congee was also good, but still H-U-G-E. After we finished, we were stuffed. Absolutely tired of eating. Then came the mains. Mine, an over salted pulled pork patty served over a bed of bland lentils. My wife's, a delicious assortment of rabbit. Mine was mediocre. I've made better pulled pork in a crock pot. However, we ate three bites and asked for to-go boxes. When we were walking out, angered about the huge waste of money, we heard another patron complain to the wait staff that the bowl of chili was too large. The whole meal was disproportional, plain, over-salted, and way over priced.

The last time I went to appetito was is 1994, when I lived nearby. I enjoyed this neighborhood spot frequently and it was a special treat.  Going back years later it is a much different place than how I remembered. We arrived after calling in advance to reserve a spot For 4 people (they don't take reservations) but promised that it would be no problem to seat us. We waited 5 minutes to talk to the waitress to get seated. It was clear they were understaffed. Long story short we ended up waiting 50 minutes in hope that the food would be great. After they had told us it would be a only a few minutes, we were seated and waited 30 minutes for appetizers which were tasteless and unimpressive. The calamari was the worst I've ever had. After another unacceptably long wait we got our entrees which were not very good at all. We had 4 godawful pastas. Which were just disgusting. The reason why we even put up this is because we were celebrating a birthday and didn't want to leave and uproot.  The waitress was nice and I felt bad that she had to work in this crazy place.

Their 1/2 chicken is awesome. The Frito pie is awesome. Their sides are awesome. Their burnt ends are a bit chewy at times (nearing the level of a right of passage to get them properly masticated), but the flavor is solid.\\n\\nFood out of the way, the experience of waiting so long to eat really takes away from it. I've only had the fortitude to wait around for a table a few times. Every other time I just grab take out. It's generally stressful going to the location because there's not enough parking (and there never will be at that location - their only one). I don't mind waiting around a few times a year at really good places for up to an hour or so, but the wait here is usually longer, and you'll be waiting in the elements with no covering.\\n\\nMy advice to Fox Bros. ... if you're business is doing so well, just open up a new location. People aren't going there because it's so busy. It's a good problem to have for a business, but you're leaving money on the table in my opinion. More people want the food than your current location can accommodate. And if somehow you're not in it for the money, then surely you can appeal to turning away people who love your food because you cannot accommodate them in a timely fashion.\\n\\nPlease consider opening up another location to let people enjoy all that you have to offer.

I tried this place after getting a recommendation from a coworker (I'm on a business trip here in Atlanta).  She had said if i wanted good southern style cooking, come here.  I came here initially for dinner the first night and the next day for brunch as well.  Sat at the bar both times since I was dining on my own.  \\n\\nFor dinner, I started with the She Crab soup, sweet tea, and their complimentary bread.  Got a really poor ladle of soup with no garnish.  I saw other people getting a full cup whereas I got about half to three quarters.  This didn't sit well with me, but I'm not one to complain at restaurants prior to getting my food.  Flavor was solid though - sort of like a chowder - heavy use of cream, some small chunks of crab.  Not bad, wish i had more though.  The cornbread muffins were very nice.  Warm and had a great taste and consistency.  The biscuit was of the non-flaky type.  Little dense, ok flavor. Did taste fresh though. Sitting at the bar, I noticed that they replenished the supply when needed, so I appreciate that those things don't just sit there all night. The sweet tea was very good.  Good tea flavor, sweet, perfect.\\n\\nThen my shrimp and grits came - a good amount of shrimp which i appreciate.  Tender, flavorful, very nice.  Grits were creamy and not too watery. Definitely on the wetter side versus thick, so it depends on what you like.  Easily enough eaten with a fork (didn't fall right through).  Not too much sausage if you like that - i was fine with the amount.  Overall, real solid.  Oh, and it came out hot and fresh which i like - nothing lukewarm here.  Sitting at the bar, you can also see that they food doesn't just linger under the heat lamps.  \\n\\nSo, i was satisfied with the entree, but the weak portion of the soup bugged me.\\n\\nI came back the following lunch to try out their supposedly great chicken and waffles.  Started with some tea - i asked for black, and for some reason the bartender gave me earl grey.  Whatevers - i like them all.  For the entree, they give you 2 square waffles cut into triangles, so you get 4 pieces total.  Some syrup, and then the chicken - which was one leg and i think a breast.  The skin was nice and crispy, the meat was fairly tender - not as much as I had preferred, but overall was pretty good.  The waffles were WEAK.  Barely warm, not very crispy.  It's weird since it wasn't busy and i didn't see anything sitting around long.  Kind of a disappointment overall - it's been a long time, but I believed that Roscoe's in LA was better, not to mention larger, and cheaper.  \\n\\nOverall the place is pretty good.

Screen Door's fried chicken and waffles is not to be missed. The true star of the dish was the beautifully browned, perfectly seasoned, extra crispy battered ginormous chicken breast. Breast meat dries out easily, but Screen Door has honed their recipe and cook time to yield the most delicious and moist fried chicken I've ever had. The accompanying sweet potato waffle had crispy edges and chewy center, but the sweet potato base was strange and different for me, but decent overall.\\n\\nAnother popular item from Screen Door is their praline bacon. Perfectly caramelized, sweet and sticky with a candied pecan topping, these bacon strips were finger-licking good and a nice balance of nutty, sweet, and savory.\\n\\nThe other two items we shared were the shrimp and grits (rich, cheesy, and flavorful) and the squash and mushroom frittata (huge portion, very fluffy eggs).\\n\\nWe, a group of three, waited less than 15 minutes for a table when we arrived about 30 minutes after opening on a Monday morning (Presidents' Day). But once we left the restaurant, the line was out the door and the wait was probably 1+ hr. Service was friendly, but the food took a good 15-20 minutes to arrive after we ordered. It's difficult for me to say any restaurant is worth the wait, mainly because I'm an impatient person.

I loved every dish we ordered. We ordered 5 dishes to share family style (there were 5 of us). I arrived at the restaurant from a 3-mile run from my AirBnB. I ran up the street to see a line forming around the corner. It was 9:00 am on a Saturday, so they were just opening. From the outside, it looked relatively small, but it's bigger than you may think. In addition, they have an EXTREMELY nice patio that is surrounded by these clear plastic walls and contains heat lamps. Once I got into the restaurant, if your group is ready, they will seat you, otherwise you will have to put your name on the waitlist. As I waited for my group to arrive, we were finally able to get seated and took the last table for first seating! (to my relief) Despite the fall cold, we were able to feel nice and warm while getting some rays on the patio. \\nWe ordered:\\n-praline bacon: Trade-offs- the bacon isn't crispy, but is instead delicious with a mixture of sweet and salty!\\n-fried chicken and waffle: The waffle really isn't very special, but the chicken is a 5/5 in my books! I'm glad we spent the extra few dollars to get two pieces instead of one. Just think of it as paying for fried chicken that came with a free waffle :D\\n-Biscuit and Gravy: This one you can probably skip on. It's pretty basic. \\nNext two are names forgotten:\\n-Some sort of veggie... quiche-like think. it was some sort of egg-veggie souffle with a veggie salad on top. The salad was zesty and delicious. It came with a cheese gratin dish and toast. The salad topping was so good  to me, but if you aren't much of a veggie lover, you may not like it. \\n-Veggie hash??? It was a veggie-potato mixture with eggs and toast. The most amazing part was the sauce the main dish was in... It was made of some sort of squash. It was phenomenal. \\nI think if you love breakfast, you will definitely find something to your liking. I ordered myself a breakfast mule which is basically a moscow mule with orange juice!

It may have been the waitresses fault. The potato was dry and only came with sour cream and butter. I asked prior to ordering it if it was like the table next to us(they had loaded potatoes), so that disappointed me as well. The collard greens tasted good if you like them spicy. I had a bite of my father's cornbread and it was moist & delicious. I also had a taste of the sweet potato casserole & I wish I would have ordered that instead of my potato. It was sweet and had crunchy brown sugar at the bottom. My mother told me the ribs were chewy and over-cooked with burnt edges. I'd say they need to work on their BBQ, but have some good sides. The cold chicken really made my meal un enjoyable. I had to reheat it at home. My partner told me the beef po-boy was no good. My father enjoyed his poke bowl. None of us liked the soggy bland garlic bread. I don't think we will return. The Honeysuckle next door looked popular. I'm going to try there next.

I should probably thank TB, in fact, for saving me from a killer hangover the next day. Thank you, TB.\\n\\nKidding aside, I've been back a couple times for trivia (which is a fun, affordable time), and had slightly less greasy affairs.

We had six people and waited about an hour and 15 minutes which everyone was completely fine with. Everyone's food was great. I loved my mac and cheese but the cat fish was not good. I love cat fish and this tasted very bad not even edible. The reason I am rating so slow is the service leaves something to be desired. Our server was not friendly nor did she smile. She quickly took our order only checking in once we were almost all finished with our food. After waiting 20 plus minutes for checks I asked the bus boy if he could grab her only to find out there was an auto 20 % gratuity added. I would of been fine with that if we were notified before hand, but no one said anything. I feel like they provided very poor service knowing that they would get an automatic tip.

I had read about Franklin BBQ online, seen it featured on No Reservations with Anthony Bourdain, and read all the Yelp and Tripadvisor reviews. I knew to expect a long line. And with me visiting on a holiday weekend after Franklin BBQ had been on vacation for a week, I knew I had to get there early. We arrived at about 8:45am on a Saturday morning armed with a cooler with water and beer, 2 chairs, sunblock, books, and breakfast tacos. The line was already almost out of the parking lot. We were lucky enough to get in line next to a humungous pick up truck, which provided a few hours of shade. As I sat there, I thought, I must be crazy to be lining up for BBQ in Texas....there are enough BBQ places in the city where you shouldn't have to wait for hours right? But I sat there, along with hundreds of other people, waiting to partake in what was promised as the best BBQ in Texas. \\n\\nSurprisingly, the hours went quickly, and once we reached the area of shade provided by the new awning installed at the restaurant, which also had misters that provided a nice cooling effect, the wait was downright pleasant. We also got to chat with the people in front of us and behind us, and soon enough, we found ourselves standing in front of Aaron Franklin himself.\\n\\nHe was open and friendly, thanking us for waiting in line for so long. We ordered brisket, pork ribs and a little bit of turkey, along with sides of beans and cole slaw. I was hoping for the bourbon banana pie, but they were out and I settled for the pecan pie. We sat down and began to enjoy what we had waited so long for. MEAT CANDY! Seriously, the brisket is so good and juicy and soft and other words that I can't think of that also mean delicious. The pork ribs (which they ran out of after we got some) were nice and peppery and fell off the bone. We ate slowly and savored the bites. Everyone working at the restaurant was friendly and seemed very nice...maybe its because I'm from LA. No one is ever that nice to you.\\n\\nSo yeah. Best BBQ I've ever had. We had gone to the Salt Lick the night before and Franklin BBQ was definitely better.  Would I wait in line for 5 hours again? I don't know....it was so damn good though."},{"name":"Little Woodrow's Southpark Meadows Bar & Grill","address":"9500 S I H 35, Ste 100","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I have never felt more insulted at ANY other bar in my life.\\n\\nI've been to this bar 5-10 times now the past couple months, and every time I'm hopeful that there will be better service and every time i am overwhelmed with disappointment.

I get WAY better service from bars on 6th street during peek hours on Friday and Saturday nights (most of those places being 1/2 as small as Woodrow's, 5x more crowded, and having much less staff). \\n\\nWhen I go to a bar I'm not expecting staff to jump for joy that I'm there, give their undivided attention to me.

The wings were enormous, I think I've had drumsticks smaller than the drumettes, and they were beautifully smoked. My wife hasn't quit talking about them all day.
