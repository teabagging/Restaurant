We knew about the outlandish waits during any normal meal time, which is the reason it took us almost a year to take the plunge. Nothing was going to stop us last Sunday, though. We were determined. Well, at least 2/6 of our party was determined.\\n\\nWe showed up at 12:30, which was our first mistake. The hostesses were all a bit short-tempered, but I would be too if my workspace was overrun with dozens of hungry patrons asking me \\"how long now?!\\" every two seconds. We received our expected \\"wait time quote\\" of at least an hour, and helped ourselves to the sublime Relax The Back next door (coolest chairs and nicest owner ever! Do your body a favor and stop in there if you have some time to kill).\\n\\nAt the 50-minute mark, 4/6 of our party decided to opt out, leaving just Jessie and me. We finally got seated a few minutes after 1:30, and the service was pretty standard. No complaints. Our coffee and water cups were never empty, and the food came pretty quickly. They also served a variety of bagel chips with delicious cream cheese as a free appetizer. A friendly bus boy even gave us a free sample during our wait! Definitely a perk.\\n\\nThe food was okay. Not bad at all, but definitely nothing remotely worth waiting over an hour for. Jessie had the Roughrider Omelette (corned beef hash, onions and Vermont Cheddar), and I had my usual make-your-own omelette with onions, broccoli, spinach, mushrooms and American cheese (at $0.95 a piece, even for the onions). I know, I didn't try any of their Jewish delicacies. Shame on me. But after waiting so long, I was cranky and ordered the food I was craving. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't amazing. Kinda like this review = pretty average, mediocre, gargantuan, and kinda boring.\\n\\nIn all fairness, we probably would've gotten sat in 45 minutes had it just been Jessie and me from the get-go, but even that is still an unwarranted wait time. I don't really understand the hype. I can pay just as much for a tastier omelette at Trident on Newbury. And what really pissed me off while we were waiting was the many tables I spotted that went uncleared for like 15 minutes. I know it's busy but 15 minutes? There's no excuse for that. Judging by the attitude I picked up from the hostesses and owner who happened to be there, it's almost as if they pride themselves on how long people are willing to wait for their \\"famous\\" (average) food.\\n\\nWhen we left around 3:15, the place was completely empty, which I hear is commonplace.

A great Korean chicken place on Buford Hwy!!\\n\\nNext to Mozart Bakery and across the street from So Kong Dong, this place doesn't stand out much.  In fact, the location probably is why the last two Korean restaurants in that location have moved on.  And except for different wall colors and the TVs, the interior is pretty much the same. It still looks dated compared to other restaurants like ThankU Chicken.  But their chicken is soo much better.  Easily the best in Atlanta, it's so lightly crispy on the outside and so juicy on the inside. \\n\\nWe got their family combo which consists of the following:\\n\\n1. Chicken of your choice: we got half spicy and half sweet and spicy\\n\\nLike I said, so lightly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, and the sauces were spot on.  Not too sweet and not too spicy.  I preferred the spicy but others liked the sweet and spicy just as much.  It was full of flavor to compliment the perfectly fried chicken.\\n\\n2. Kimchi bulgogi quesadilla\\n\\nThis was surprisingly really good.  I was expecting a flabby tortilla full of very greasy fried kimchi.  Instead, the tortilla was decently crispy and it was fully of yummy bulgogi and oozing with cheese.  It was very light on the kimchi.  It also came with fries.  It was the same style as the sesame fries at Hankook Taqueria on Collier Rd, but without the sesame flavor.  It might not be everyone's favorite, but I particularly liked it.\\n\\n3. Stone bowl Bibimbap of your chioce: we got spicy pork\\n\\nThe bibimbap was solid.  The spicy pork tasted like it was grilled prior so it had a nice smoky flavor.  Apart from that, it was just solid.  Wouldn't be the first place I think of for bibimbap, but I also wouldn't mind it as part of the combo or if I happen to be there with friends.\\n\\n4. Dduk Bbok Ki of your choice: we got vegetable\\n\\nThis was also very solid.  Very delicious and a good compliment to the other stuff that we got, but I can't say it's head and shoulders better than other places.  It had nice flavor and not too spicy or sweet.\\n\\n5. 4 skewers of oden (fish cake)\\n\\nHard to mess this up.  We enjoyed it.  The dipping sauce had a little bit of Korean mustard in it to give it a ever so slight kick.  I thought it was a nice touch.\\n\\nAll of this food was for $49.99.  The menu says it's enough for 3-4 people, but really it can easily feed 5 (or 4 very hungry people who can eat a ton). \\n\\nOther foods were very solid, but the chicken is clearly the star at this place.

Usually when you get a veggie side, it's usually flavorless, not at urban hibachi. I love the texture of the veggies, still has a bite, not soggy at all, and the scallops were great. What ties it all together is the white sauce they put on the side, it's truly amazing. You could put that sauce on a flip flop and it would taste good! (guy fieri joke) there's nothing I appreciate more than consistently good food from a restaurant. If it was good three years ago, regardless of management, hires and resignations, it should be good three years later. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and will be back."},{"name":"Thai Basil","address":"1215 Thurlow St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"My boyfriend and I went to the new Thai Basil that just opened in Kitsilano on the corner of Cornwall and Yew.

If you DO love it, then this will probably taste good to you but will unlikely change your life for the better. The line appears to be long no matter the time of day, but it moves pretty quickly (faster when you're outside because once you enter there are six different lines, which you'd think would be efficient and probably is but not as much as you'd hope). If you have some time to kill and just really need this cannoli, then give it a shot. \\nThey are cash only, which meant we were limited in the number of cannoli we could purchase, and that was a good thing. I'll admit right now, we are not lovers of cannoli, but we thought perhaps this would change our minds (it did not). We ordered:\\nOne ricotta (gotta try the authentic one along with the designer flavors)\\nOne chocolate cream\\nOne Oreo\\n\\nThe ricotta was far and away the best of the bunch. It was sweetened just enough and had that perfect texture. Because of the sheer size of this cannoli (seriously huge), the shell is also pretty monstrous, which means the majority of what you will taste is fried dough. This is why I don't care for cannoli in the first place. \\nThe chocolate cream was the worst. Imagine taking instant chocolate pudding and mixing it with water instead of milk. Inedible, and we couldn't take more than one bit each. \\nThe Oreo was good, but again there was the whole cannoli/taco salad shell situation that threw off the balance. \\nThe cost came to $11, which we found very reasonable (I don't know the individual breakdown). \\n\\nIs this bad cannoli?

Having said that, we didn't wait too, too long for our food and everyone seems like they are trying their best. Still there was certainly not the normal amount of attention you would expect at a well-established restaurant, and at times the atmosphere felt a little overwhelming.

We weren't sure exactly what kind of dishes we were craving (you can order curries, rice dishes, noodles, spicy mixed vegetables, all sorts of things!) so we kindly asked the staff for some direction. She suggested we try the most popular dishes; the fried gobi balls (in spicy, vinegary sauce), tofu lettuce wraps (crunchy, savory, salty on fresh lettuce), and the spicy manchurian chow-mein. We enjoyed each entree, and it was a good value for all (around $30-$40 total), but to be truthful I am not 100% sure we would be back because nothing was mind-blowingly, 'I NEED TO TELL THE WHOLE WORLD' delicious.

The food here doesn't leave as greasy of a feel in your mouth as other places, but not to worry, it's still grease and fat and oil.\\n\\nI liked my appetizer and side a lot more than I liked my meat. I highly recommend the fried green tomatoes, as well as the brussel sprouts. \\n\\nI can tell the brisket is more \\"refined\\" than other BBQ joints -- and don't get me wrong, it's moist and tender and delicious-- but I still prefer Salt Lick's brisket.  The sausage is good, but for me did not stand out compared to the sausage I've tried at other joints (though it did stand out in price).\\n\\nAmbience: nice dim lighting, also a back patio.  Great for groups or for a date.\\n\\nService: very quick and friendly, as expected from a restaurant that charges what it does.\\n\\nRecommendation:\\n3.5 stars, but leaning towards 3 stars because I don't know if I like the idea of fancy BBQ.  The food is good and well executed, but it's a bit pricey, and personally I'd rather pay a little less for BBQ and not have the fancy trappings.  I think if you're visiting Austin or entertaining out of town guests, Salt Lick BBQ (though it's a bit of a drive) is a better experience in terms of taste and environment."},{"name":"Vinotopia Restaurant & Winebar at Cinetopia Mill Plain","address":"11700 SE 7th St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"I felt like I was in coach.\\n\\nThe four of us visited this place during a slow Saturday evening.  We arrived 1.5 hours before our show and decided to eat in the restaurant.  The place was empty. The waiter was friendly and promptly greeted us.   Our orders were taken and food started coming in about 20 - 30 minutes.  The problem was they forgot my order.  Having traveled the US and visited a variety of restaurants over the years, I am used to the occasional issue. I patiently waited while others at my table were eating to see if the waiter would figure it out.  After ten minutes I had to inform him my meal was missing.    I don't usually complain but when food is priced high, I expect orders and service to be spot on.   It's very simple expectation.   In addition, when you are essentially the first order of the night you shouldn't be forgotten.  Once the waiter realized the mistake he did take action to get the issue resolved.   BTW, the waiter is not the one serving.  There seems to be a disconnect between waiter and the servers.\\n\\nThe food was okay but nothing to write home about.   My Daughter's chicken strips were heavy on the salt. My club sandwich was fairly good.\\n\\nMy problem got somewhat more irritating when the bill came. It was incorrect. I explained to the waiter my order and referenced the description as written in the menu.  He took care of the issue once he understood the error.\\n\\nCinetopia seems to be a progressive theater in the Portland/metro area by offering the latest in digital and sound technology. Perhaps the restaurant part should also consider investing in technology (e.g. using an electronic tablet for ordering) so that things are not missed.  I think customers would appreciate things not being missed, especially at the prices being asked by the establishment."},{"name":"Topgolf","address":"9295 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Very cool place to check out.

I was a bit intimidated by the crowd, but I was told the line moves fairly quickly so I stuck it out with what only took about 5 minutes. I scoped out the menu, along with all the treats displayed. Everything looked divine! I decided to go with one of their most popular items, the cannoli. They had so many varieties it was so hard to choose from. And I had to make sure I didn't go overboard, because it is cash only. Well I think I did only because I could barely finish half of one, and I bought 4; the amaretto, hazelnut, pecan caramel, and pistachio. The 2 I enjoyed the most was the hazelnut and amaretto. At $4 a pop, these were the biggest cannoli I've seen.\\nThe staff there was quick and courteous...so don't forget to tip."},{"name":"Renaissance Orlando Airport Hotel","address":"5445 Forbes Pl","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Eight of us had lunch here today for two birthday gals.

This is my summer preference , I seem to run hot so pho in the summer is not my thing but the rest of the family loves the pho anytime of the year.\\nJust a note, we are all about food and service and while there is nothing wrong with the ambience it is more of a family style atmosphere, with an old CRT tv playing random shows sometimes Asian sometimes not and the curtains remind us of an Indian restaurant for some reason, so maybe the the best place for a romantic first date, but definetly a great place to eat!

I had the pork soup with chicharron (fatty pieces of pork, avocado and lime.

My friend had the vegetable fajitas with a good amount of fried veggies, spicy salsa and guacamole.

It's a little hole-in-the wall with a single table outside (which was just added) and a couple 2-chair tables inside--big orders and big parties should take out--and it's easy to miss or mistake for a dive. That would be a mistake. They serve great Thai and Vietnamese-influenced fusion, with authentic but perhaps enhanced and creative flavors, but a unique and well-realized personality.\\n\\nSo a confident and enthusiastic 5 stars! I have my reasons.\\n\\n1. Great food. This was hands down the best pad-thai I've had in years, if not in my life. To be fair, the owner did warn me that it would be, but I have to give her credit for living up to her word. My second visit was a simpler but explosively tasty ginger chicken rice plate of which I ate every last bit. Very flavorful in all the right ways, obviously extremely fresh and cooked perfectly.\\n\\n2. Great friendly service from someone who very clearly cares about the food, health and freshness, the customers, and the overall quality of the experience. This makes a huge difference. I've only been there a few times and I already feel like this place is a little island of home in a sea of, well, Chelsea.\\n\\n3. Excellent, simple menu with great variety. I had a great discussion with the owner about how well designed it is, because every item is named perfectly and needs no description, and it's large enough to have plenty of options, while being small enough not to be overwhelming. Excellent focus and design.\\n\\n4. Boba teas and smoothies made fresh with real fruit. Yum. I'd go just for these, honestly.\\n\\n\\"Best Restaurant in Chelsea\\" isn't a terribly competitive title, but I'm pretty confident on it for this place. It's one of those restaurants where it's clear that everything is done right because the care and attention is there. A real diamond in the rough (almost literally!).

Coming from an Italian household and Chicago I'll be the first to admit that I'm a snob when it comes to Italian food and my preference is for Italian comfort food, you know the staples. \\n\\nVespaio offers a large assortment of antipastas, I think the selection changes daily. The restaurant is cute and cozy, it has an interesting layout, all of the walls are curved and uniquely shaped. However, the acoustics are terrible, it was very loud in the place and hard to carry on a conversation. \\n\\nService was very attentive, but not what I would consider friendly. Our server wasn't rude by any means he was just all business. We started with the calamari, which per the menu comes with a spicy arrabbiata dipping sauce. The calamari itself was quite good, but not the best I've ever had. The sauce I found spiceless. We also were given a bread basket, being a carb-fiend this is one of my favorite parts of the meal. I think there was an assortment of bread in the basket with some crispy Italian bread in it, but the rest of my party ate it before I could get any. The bread I did get was very tasty, just not what I was expecting, it was soft and chewy. I was disappointed that we didn't get any olive oil and Parmesan to dip the bread in, instead we got this white bean mousse. Our table found the mousse bland, in need of garlic or something else. \\n\\nFor dinner I got the Mandilla de Saea and my friends the Margherita pizza and the Spaghetti alla Carbonara. My meal was ok, not fabulous; I found the pesto to be a little too heavy on the olive oil. It didn't look like a lot of food, but it was deceptively filling. For a simple, meatless dish I found it was pricey at $17. My friend who got the pizza was getting over the flu and didn't have much of an appetite. As a result he ate only a fraction of his pizza, but I don't think it was the pizza's fault. Based on appearance the pizza looked quite good and was nice sized. I was also mesmerized by the guy hand-tossing the dough. Again at $16, I felt this was pricey for a meatless dish - the more complex pizzas are only a dollar or two more. My other friend really enjoyed her spaghetti, her only comment was that the dish was quite rich and after a while got overwhelming. Given the ingredients, etc. I felt her meal was fairly priced at $22. \\n\\nBottom line: I give this place 3.5 stars.

It was too salty and a little bit sour but not in a pleasant way.  The potatoes on the side were tasty but greasy.

The food is mediocre at best compared to other places in the area, but the kicker here, as everyone says, is the service.\\n\\nMy entire family came in to meet me for a holiday dinner this past winter (11 people total), so of course we made a reservation.  Upon arrival, we were told that we would be seated shortly, as a table downstairs was \\"just finishing up.\\"  We crammed into the short hallway at the door and waited.\\n\\nEvery 15 minutes or so, the host would come by to let us know that the table was \\"really dragging in finishing their food\\" and that they were trying to hurry them along.  This went on for about 45 minutes.  Why even make a reservation?\\n\\nFinally, after an hour of waiting, I ventured downstairs myself to see this party.  They were just being served their food.\\n\\nThe host continued to chat up and hit on the other guests that had entered and were waiting next to us, offering them all glasses of wine while they waited, while we were offered no such thing.  I have to stress here that we were not rude or overbearing in any way; I seemed to be the only one in my family angered by the long delay.\\n\\nJust before we were seated, I realized why \\"reservations\\" here are useless.  The phone at the host station rang, and the host, while hitting on a party of three girls waiting to be seated, encouraged them to go ahead and answer the phone while he walked away.  They did, and from what I could hear of the one-way conversation, it seemed to be someone making a reservation.  If they only knew they were speaking to a random patron in line.  No wonder the reservations don't get held!\\n\\nWhen we finally sat at the plastic college-beer-pong tables they unfolded for us in the basement (sans any semblance of tablecloth or table setting), the specials were screamed to us.  I don't even remember what I ordered; could have been the Chicken Saltimbocca.  But the meal was average at best and did nothing to bring back the restaurant's reputation from the horrible service we received.\\n\\nOverall waiting time to sit down after making a reservation was 1 hour, 15 minutes.  Skip this place. Go to Riccardo's Ristorante on North St. instead.  I actually called them while we were waiting to see if they could accommodate a party of 11 on short notice since I was so fed up; they told me to come on over and they would fit us upstairs no problem.  It's also off the beaten path, never a wait to sit, excellent food.  Any dish with a red sauce, ask them to substitute in the fra diavolo sauce (if you like spicy sauces).  It is undoubtedly the best I've ever tasted.  Great food, accommodating servers...the complete antithesis of Massimino's.  But, you could literally choose any other restaurant in the North End and have a better experience than at Massimino's - Riccardo's just happens to be a personal favorite.\\n\\nI will never return to Massimino's and sincerely hope this review helps you do the same."},{"name":"Pip's Original Doughnuts & Chai","address":"4759 NE Fremont St, Ste C","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"There mini doughnuts are pretty good.

I ordered the skate wing, which I later discovered is related to the shark. The fish came out covered in panko bread crumbs. I wanted to taste the fish itself, not the fried matter all over it - very disappointing, but it was nevertheless tender and expertly prepared. The rest of the dish made up for it.  The puttanesca sauce was delightful, with the perfect amount of salty olive and caper balanced out by the nutty complex red sauce, accented by perfectly cooked - and not fried - calamari. I noticed this item is no longer on the menu, so perhaps they have phased it out. The service was seamless with the waiter and others working in concert fairly well while the waiter juggled a large table of overly frugal elderly people.

All the social media buzz got me really excited about this place, but I felt kinda let down. Everything tasted good, but did not meet expectations of all the buzz.\\n\\nMy wife and I had the sweetbread and spicy baguette sticks to start. The sweetbread was battered, deep fried, and served with lemon dressing (basically just lemon juice). It tasted fine, but nothing special flavor-wise and a tiny portion for the price. It was missing the decadence that I crave with sweetbread. We thought the baguette sticks, liver mousse served on warm mini baguettes, were the best dish of the evening. The mousse was nicely seasoned, had a bit of a spicy kick and a pleasant creamy texture.\\n\\nFor our mains, we had the duck rotisserie and gigot. The duck was nicely presented in a cast iron skillet. I found the duck to be a little tough. I worked really hard to get every bit of meat off the bone because it was just a tiny leg and thigh with no other accompaniments except a small bowl of fries between the two of us. The gigot was not much better portion-wise. It was just a smallish piece of meat with braising liquid and disintegrated diced carrots. The cut of meat did not have enough fat so was not suited for slow braising, it just tasted dry instead of tender. The braising liquid was yummy. We both felt the mains were incomplete because of the lack of sides. Thank goodness there was unlimited bread to fill us up.\\n\\nWe didn't have dessert.

It said that they were so good that there is always a line!  It made my list of places to visit & they were right, there was a line.  However, the line moves fairly quickly which meant the only problem I was left with was which one of the mouth-watering items should I order.  My daughter went to Boston over spring break this year and raved about the cannolis.  Having never had one, we tried one in Cincinnati and she said they weren't even close.  Mike's seemed to have about 2 dozen, so the person waiting on me suggested Pistachio and it was fantastic.  Who knew that ricotta cheese could be made to be that tasty? There was such a nice juxtaposition between the cool, creamy filling and the flaky, crisp shell.  While enjoying it with a cup of coffee, I admired the pressed tin ceiling, too.  Be prepared for a huge cannoli,which is a challenge to finish, but I managed :).  Only for the sake of writing this article, of course. \\n\\nI later took my husband there and we picked up several items to bring to his sister's who we were going to see over the week-end.

Keep an eye out for the newest attraction in town. Topgolf is basically a two-story tee overlooking a wide fairway/green with several targets. Each target is worth a certain amount of points, and the general objective is to hit your golf ball into these targets. There's apparently different games you can play, but we opted for the simple game of aiming and hopefully scoring, since we're all below mediocre golf players. There's three different time groups throughout the day which are priced differently, with the evenings being the most expensive (50$ for an hour of playing). It's a maximum of 6 people per bay, and $5 for a lifetime membership per person. This just means that you pay $5 the first time you go per person, and then pay for the hour of playing as a group. It's a little pricey, but it's different and fun and not your usual mini-golf or putting course. There's different clubs- from drivers to wedges and hybrids, with color coded numbers and yardage to help you choose your weapon. I say weapon, because you should be attempting to destroy the green with your skills. Granted, you might end up missing the golf ball in general or hitting the net right in front of you- but we had a great time. This is a great place to hang out with friends, and I feel it would be fun for people with different levels of golf skills. I can imagine a decent golfer having a grand old time showing off sending golf balls flying into the distance while everyone else skirts them off like we're sweeping them into the course. In all seriousness, I would definitely come back- especially once I have some practice so I can look more like Phil Mickelson and less like like my abuela during Sunday cleaning."},{"name":"Pip's Original Doughnuts & Chai","address":"4759 NE Fremont St, Ste C","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Made to order mini donuts!

I had delusions that parking in Kits would be a) cheaper and b) easier than skytraining it to Gastown.  I also haven't gotten over a $70 parking ticket I received from being 4 minutes and 13 seconds overdue parking on West Cordova the last time we attempted to go to Hapa Umi (turned out they were closed; we walked by the waterfront instead).  It is SOOOO unfair.  If I had chanced upon the evil meter man, I would have asked him, \\"have you never been late in your life??! (*&#Q@!\\".  Sadly, I did not get that opportunity because he's always like the headless horseman disappearing into the night.  So...that's the story of how we got to Hapa Kits.\\n\\nThis one has chic dark interiors that made it super intimate and cozy for date nights...or a secret rendezvous where you role play meeting a \\"stranger\\" in a bar.  The table adjacent to ours had an obviously newly-dating couple who needed to get a room, as well as manners  lessons in the art of public discourse.  For instance, the man should not have told the woman in public that \\"she's more special than his ex could ever be because his ex was a raving bitch and that he can see himself loving her more than he's ever loved anyone else he's ever dated\\".  You don't trash previous employers, why would you trash somebody who's shared your bed?  Emily Post would not approve.\\n\\nAs well, it's a family-oriented enough place where Kits yuppies introduce their children to Japanese culinary adventures in a safe and non-threatening environment (T&T comes to mind when I think of threatening environments).  I felt a strange sense of pride (being non-Japanese) to see the 5-year old kid at the table beside us eagerly digging into agedashi tofu.  I was also internally applauding the parents for raising a cultured child.  One of the best reasons I can think of to raise kids in Vancouver.  \\n\\nAnyhoo, food was passable but mediocre for the price they were charging.  I've had tastier and cheaper at other izakayas.  We had the duck pomegranate which didn't disappoint my tastebuds but bh's yaki udon was a never-order-again item.  Our server seemed to be the one person attending to 7 different tables and though she did a good job of consistently apologizing to us at every turn, having to wait 15 minutes to get our drink orders started was not the most charming situation during a Canucks game.  Also, how about hire more servers on a busy Friday night/Canucks game night so the lovely one we had doesn't have to keep apologizing? Other than this, I'd probably return to Hapa Kits for the ambience alone.  After all, Japanese tapas, sake and a walk on Kits beach after is always a pretty good date night."},{"name":"Kona Grill","address":"11410 Century Oaks Ter","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I really love the food and atmosphere here.

There are countless times I've ordered from this local place... and I'm all about supporting this particular establishment--for quality pie's, reliability, and just knowing that it's fresh.\\n\\nHowever, my wife & I had the most unexpected incident tonight when I decided to call \\"old reliable.\\" First off, I called in an order--control center. To find an hour later that the South Lamar store never received my order, nor did they have any record of my call to date. I was placed on hold to hear another voice interrogate me--in disbelief--that I had even placed an order to begin with. Unless I'm going crazy or maybe I had a dream that I called AUSTIN'S PIZZA and woke up realizing that my pizza never arrived.\\n\\n I digress...it had almost been two hours and still no pizza. Scratching my head wondering what went wrong, my wife and I were starving. Finally, after nibbling on crackers for the past 2 hours the delivery person made it to my door step. I tipped her because it definitely wasn't her mistake and I'm no ass. \\n\\nThe biggest disappointment, even after waiting in anticipation, was that first bite. Soggy crust (specified well done), undercooked, tasteless sauce, and my wife wanted to gag. I couldn't believe what happened tonight. Has this acclaimed staple of Austin been falling under the waste line, settling for the status quo... or was the staff just making a point about customer service. They made it for FREE. Absolutely, without question, the worst pie we have ever had from the South Lamar location.

The idea of having a tasty sushi place bicycle distance from my house was extremely enticing.  Unfortunately Yume disappointed in a big way.  The good news though is that I don't think this restaurant will last for very long given the extremely high real estate fees for businesses in the Triangle.\\n\\nHere was was wrong with Yume:\\n1. When attempting to purchase a bottle of German Riesling (that they had on the menu), we were told that they didn't have any and thus had to switch to the Sancerre.  It wasn't bad, but if you're going to sell wine by the bottle, how hard is it to have a case or two in your restaurant at all times?  One of my friends also got a glass of wine that had clearly been opened over 48 hours ago.  This is simply not acceptable for a restaurant.\\n\\n2. The sashimi fusion appetizer was made worse by the seasoning and sauce that was added to it.  After trying the hamachi in nigiri form, it was clear that they had actually failed at enhancing the flavor of the fish.\\n\\n3. Service.  Our waiter comes out a few minutes after delivering the food and asks if everything is okay.  I respond that it's fine.  He says \\"Really?\\" as if he's surprised that we're not gagging on our food.  The sushi chef also seemed a little confused when we asked him what he would be eating today.  Almost as if he wouldn't eat the food they serve.  This is not a good sign.\\n\\nOverall, the food was mediocre (possibly rather old), the wine was medicore and the service was poor.  This would all be fine and good if it were about 1/2-1/4 the cost.  You pay the same here as you do at Musashino and you don't get anything remotely close to what one would expect.  Maybe I'll give it another shot in 12 months if they're still around, hopefully my experience was the result of them working out the kinks from their opening."},{"name":"Cafe Intermezzo","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy, Councourse B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"A welcoming cafe with European flair.

FINALLY, a place nearby where I can grab a delicious sushi lunch!  Huge thanks to Stephanie S. and Tara M., whose reviews led me to this pot of sushi gold at the end of the rainbow.\\n\\nThere are a wide variety of very reasonably priced lunch specials here.  They offer a selection of bento boxes in the $9-$14 range, and a great selection of sushi combos - you can get five pieces of nigiri with your choice of one of eleven (!!) different rolls for $14.95 or less...and you get miso soup AND salad with it!  I noticed there is a similar combo on their dinner menu with eight pieces of nigiri and your choice of one of eight rolls for $23, which I thought was also very fairly priced.  The menu also offers quite a few other interesting options - udon, yakisoba, tempura, chirashi, salads topped with sashimi that would be terrific for low-carbers, and, of course, the mandatory teriyaki. There are even a few Korean items on the menu, including galbi (Korean beef ribs), bi bim bap and bulgogi.\\n\\nI tried the lunch sushi special with the firecracker roll, which is a mix of scallops and cucumber, topped with spicy tuna, jalapenos, masago, and house mustard sauce.  The firecracker roll was HUGE - eight large pieces - and delightfully spicy - so much so that I had to break it up with pieces of nigiri (and I like really spicy food).  The slabs of nigiri were cut very generously, and I so appreciated that they did not give me a hard time about doing a substitution when I requested raw fish in lieu of shrimp nigiri.  \\n\\nThere were a few minor things that prevented this from being a perfect food experience.  I thought the miso was a little watery and not flavorful enough, and felt the same way about the salad dressing.  Also, the spicy tuna that topped the firecracker roll was of the chopped variety, which always feels a little chintzy to me, as if the tuna wasn't fresh enough to serve whole.  However, I didn't detect any lack of freshness at all in any of the fish I ate, including the nigiri, so I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt on this.  It's not, say, Musashino, but it certainly holds its own amongst the field of choices here in landlocked Austin, which earns it five stars given its better-than-average pricing, the generous portions, and the relative dearth of Asian food in this part of town.\\n\\nQuite possibly in part due to the fact that there weren't many diners when I was there, service was extremely attentive.  I'm pretty sure no less than six people thanked us as we got up to leave the restaurant.  The decor is surprisingly elegant considering its strip center location.\\n\\nIf you haven't yet checked out Yanagi, it's definitely worth a visit.

We ended up spending more time in the room than we expected to, but I'll get to that in a sec.\\n\\nThe hotel was offering a decent deal on Expedia and the location is great. It's located just next to the Congress Ave bridge (where the bats fly out of) and it's equidistant between downtown and South Congress. If you're going to watch the bats fly out from under the bridge in the summer (highly recommend), you can walk there.\\n\\nWe spent the next couple of days exploring all the local attractions. We took a night swim in the pool (open until 9 or 10) with the stunning Austin skyline all lit up. Everything was great . . . until Hurricane Harvey hit. The hotel was great about keeping us informed and making us feel safe. It was pouring outside and most places were closed, so we ended up spending most of our last day in our room. At least our tv and wifi worked! \\n\\nWhile the hotel is centrally located, you'll probably still have to Uber or taxi downtown or further down S Congress, since it's a bit of a walk.

This Ginza's portions and taste went downhill.  A tiiiiiiny portion of sushi cost me a lot more than I care to admit, but I was feeling vulnerable and easily coerced into sushi deliciousness. So, I ventured out in my high heels and it ended meh-ly.  I love the Brookline Ginza, although I have not been there in a year.  Perhaps that went downhill as well.  bottom line for this -- the portions are small, not fantastic, not great, just good.  Would you care to pay what I paid for good?

Each time a different experience.  The first time I went with my fiance, both of his brothers and his older brother's wife.   We decided to get food before our movie.  The restaurant was so packed we opted to sit at the bar. The bartender was very nice and knowledgeable.  \\n\\nMy fiance and I shared the fried mac and cheese balls and a chicken caesar salad.   Both were excellent.  His brothers and sister-in-law shared a nacho.  Also great.  Turns out we hadn't planned on how long the food would take to make before the movie and we ran out of time to eat before our show.  \\n\\nThe owner was there and since we decided to just skip the movie for the night and come back later he gave us vouchers to use for another day in the living room theater.  Which was very nice since we weren't even complaining about it.  \\n\\nThe second time my fiance and I visited we sat outside in a nice little faux-tropical forest.  We had our own little private are and it was very quaint.  I ordered the fried mac & cheese balls again since they were so good the last time and exactly what I was craving.  My fiance ordered a burger.  The waitress came back and informed me they were all out of the fried mac & cheese.  I was seriously disappointed.  Kind of sad to say I got so upset over food but still.  I ordered something else and when she came back again from the kitchen she said she'd found out turns out they had some left.  So I got them.  They were fabulous.  \\n\\nThe third time we visited was Valentine's day.  We wanted food before we saw our movie yet again.  Again, we wanted the fried mac and cheese balls.  Don't ask why I'm so hung up on them- I'm still not even sure myself.  \\n\\nWe had to sit at the bar since all the tables in the restaurant were reserved for Valentine's couples.  (About half the tables were full the entire time we were there: About an hour.  Several couples were sitting at the bar like we were.)    \\n\\nThe bartender informed us they no longer serve the fried mac and cheese since they're so hard to make with a good turn-over rate.  Then he explained to us later that they're easy to make since they're basically just mac and cheese rolled in Panko and fried.  Which baffled us.  Are they easy or hard to make?  So about that- I'm sad and upset I can't get great fried mac & cheese anymore.  The few other places I've found it, it's never made quite right.  \\n\\nHowever, every time we've been there the owner has been present,  walking around making sure things are going smoothly.

Yet, despite ordering quickly our food and drinks took over forty minutes to arrive. My flatbread pizza was cold, and it was apparent that it had been sitting for some time. It also wasn't very good, it was on a very thin, flaky crust reminding me more of a cracker than a crust and the only thing fell apart upon the first bite with the cheese all coming off in one piece and the sauce plopping off the side. \\n\\nI would recommend the desserts and if you have a chocolate tooth go for that, but I would skip on the food."},{"name":"Buckeye Pho","address":"761 Bethel Rd, Ste E195","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Since my last review, I have found a decrease in the quality of the pho - not as much flavor.

Since UT campus had turned crime scene, the show was moved to Lamberts. We arrived and, while I figured the UT ID thing was out the door, I wasn't expecting the $15 cover to be $20. It hadn't been mentioned, and I'm not sure who was to blame for that. \\n\\nAs a music venue, this upstairs is classy. Leather booths, a disco ball floating light bubbles across the walls, black and white paisley wallpaper behind the shiny bar. The sound was surprisingly good. The Maker's Manhattan my boyfriend had is the only sip of Manhattan I've ever thought tasted good. The bartenders upstairs made amazing drinks with great service.\\n\\nHowever...there is no where to sit to enjoy the music and when you're standing, you're in the way of waitresses, busers, patrons going to the bathroom...no way is this a $20 venue! Honestly, if my boyfriend hadn't been such a huge fan of Kat, I wouldn't have stayed, but her voice did sooth EVERYTHING. \\n\\nWhen we spotted people leaving a booth, we split it with another couple. After sitting there 15 minutes or so, someone came over and told us that the booth was reserved at 9 and we'd have to vacate at that time. Seemed odd that you can make RSVPs in the bar! We were about to order food, but didn't want to stand and eat, so we just continued enjoying our beverages for the 30 minutes til the reservation came. In the 45 minutes we sat there, no one bussed the dirty plates and half eaten food off the table until right before the other couple was headed up there. Just to remind us we were unwelcome guests, no doubt. Rude.\\n\\nI don't know that I'd come back , but I do appreciate them squeezing us Kat fans in at a moment's notice.

And Eric is the kind of business owner who makes me furious there's no sixth.\\n\\nThis guy swims in passion about his food, his shop and his somewhat maniacal focus on customer satisfaction. God forbid you announce it's your first time there - he'll want you to eat everything and insist you do so on his dime. Mad respect to a biz owner who bites their thumb at the bottom line to win a customer for life.\\n\\nAnd he does, because he cares so f#$%ing much about everything he does. He's paranoid when bowing to high demand from loyal patrons who barrage him with catering requests. \\"I know that first sandwich won't be as good as the 30th,\\" he says wistfully. \\"I just can't say no, though.\\" Not for lack of a conversational demeanor, mind you. Eric will talk to you about anything and everything, as if you've been friends for years (you probably will be by the end of your meal). This also warrants fair warning: don't go if you're in a hurry. Time flies.\\n\\nSo yeah, back to the food. Eat it. The onion rings? Pepper, flaky, light and impossible to avoid finishing, so bring a friend. The sauce? It's a stoner's combo of BBQ, mayo, mustard seed, honey, spices and I believe I saw a splash of pickle juice. Couldn't tell you the secret recipe if I tried though, and I bet Eric couldn't either - he just keeps mixing until he knows it's ready. Trust me; I watched. And the bread won't meet your toasted and crusty expectations, but it works.\\n\\nThere will be boxes of chips strewn about. There will be rails devoid of soda in the cooler. There will be a hoodie slung over the napkin dispenser. The only receipts are handwritten.

But now that Opening Day is here, I can safely say that this place has given me life!\\n\\nFish- This is the sort of Southern-fried fish I've been searching for ever since I moved to Austin. Thoroughly breaded, but still very meaty, each bite is an explosion of spices. Does not fall into the blandness trap that a lot of fried fish gets stuck in. I wonder if they'll let me buy by the pound, next time.\\n\\nChicken- You can't go to a joint that advertises \\"CHICKEN AND WAFFLE\\" to the world without ordering a full plate of their signature wings. Boy, did they come prepared. Each piece of chicken is a fried wing and leg combo. Like the fish, it's breaded and spiced well, although it lacks the heavenly flavor profile of the fried fish. Still, if you're a fan of the dark meat, you've come to the right place.\\n\\nWaffles- Rich and hearty, this waffle will be the anchor to your ship of brunchtastic flavor. Not necessarily crispy, but full of buttermilk goodness, it paired well with the savory fried entrees.\\n\\nMac and Cheese- Also decided to try a side. The mac and cheese, while tasty, just didn't have the complex spice profile that the rest of the savory foods had.

I definitely plan on coming back for the full order in the future. The Crab Cake sandwich was a perfect proportion and I couldn't stop once I got started, the fries were also a perfect texture, nice and crunchy on the outside. I love them crispy!

Wait, why wasn't red velvet one of them?  There were cakes in every direction you looked, big delicious cakes.....rows and rows of cakes.   This is surely too much for me to handle, I kept thinking.

OK, seriously...why isn't this woman helping me decide what to get???\\n\\nOK, I finally decided on my own and got a slice of the marionberry poppyseed cake because I have never tried anything like it before.  I felt like I was in Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory, what the heck is a marionberry anyway?  It was four layers of poppyseed cake with marionberry preserves and a cream cheese frosting.  Could that sound any more fabulous?  \\n\\nPaul had a rough time deciding.  He was really craving something vanilla but they actually didn't have too many vanilla options.  Both the baker and the woman behind the counter were actually kind of rude to him, asking him stuff like \\"what, don't you like fruit?\\"  and \\"what do you mean you don't like cheesecake?\\"  (That is the reason for the four stars instead of five btw...they were rude to Paul, never a good thing in my book!)\\n\\nAnyway, Paul finally decided on the Irish Oatmeal cake, which is a oatmeal spice cake with a cream cheese, almond, coconut, and brown sugar frosting.  WOW.\\n\\n$10.50 later we were happily at home eating the cake.  Funny part is, we switched them.  I fell in LOVE with the Irish Oatmeal cake.  It was delicious.  It was so moist and tasted so good.

We went for a short stop to pick up some last minute gifts and got so caught up in the buzz of entertainment and sights to see, it turned into 4 hours.\\n\\nDisney has added two high-tech parking structures which make it a breeze to find a spot to park.  The garages feature a live sign giving an accurate number of how many spaces are available and on which level of the structure.  Most impressive is the security!  There are cameras everywhere, along with guards and helpful cast members to direct guests to the elevators and escalators which lead to Disney Springs.  \\n\\nThe addition of these structures was genius!  I hated being a parking spot 'hawk' driving in circles to find a place to park in the old Disney Village lot.  Disney thought well ahead on this one and they deserve kudos for having the foresight to see that expansion of the venue would lead to a demand for parking space.  Well done, Disney!\\n\\nAside from all the shopping one could hope for, there are also entertainers throughout the venue; singing, dancing, tricksters and more.  There also some high-end shops on site; Kate Spade is my favorite.\\n\\nThe lunch/dinner options are incredible.  Raglan Road Irish Pub is always fun and lively; guests from all over the world visit and it's uncanny the people we have met that either we know from years ago, or people we meet that know someone who is related somehow to family or friends we have in common.  Gives a whole new meaning to 'It's a Small World.'\\n\\nSplistville bowling is a blast!  It's clean, fun and just adds something different for those on vacation.  As locals, we like Splitsville because it is nicer than any other bowling alley in town. It's not overly pricey, but it not cheap either.  Overall, for the price and fun, well worth the money.\\n\\nHouse of Blues is always one to count on for good food and live entertainment.  At this location, the service is held to a higher standard, possibly due to Disney guidelines.  One way or another, a great, relaxing time.\\n\\nDisney Springs Character Flight is a tethered hot air balloon that goes into the air pretty high.  Though I have seen it often, I have to admit there's just something about hot air balloon rides that scares me.  One day I will brave up and try it.\\n\\nThe amazing Christmas Store located almost all the way at the northwest end of the venue is the best!  It's Christmas/holiday time 365 days a year.  It's a must for me as I collect ornaments from each year.  They will personalize them if you wish for a little extra special touch.\\n\\nCharacters do make their way around The Springs, so there are plenty of photo ops.\\n\\nProbably best of all at Disney Springs is that it is FREE!  That's right.....NO CHARGE TO ENTER!  You can peruse and meander all day if you want and be entertained without spending a dime.   For me, it's impossible to not buy something I just have to have; see a movie I just have to see; bowl a game I just have to bowl.  Endless possibilities!  So, if you are planning your dream Disney vacation, please remember to add Disney Springs to your plans.

I travel for a living and eat out more often than I cook.\\n\\nI ate at this Waterloo recently and was utterly offended. All we wanted was to let our kids play and have some food.

I went with 2 friends; each of us ordered an old fashioned.  The waitress told us that because it takes a while for the bartenders to muddle it, they would offer us baby beers while we waited.  So we sipped our 4 oz of Bud Light and expected an amazing old fashioned.  When we got them we were disappointed to find them only pretty good.  The glasses were also packed with so much ice that we had probably 3 oz of actual drink each.  When we got the bill we were horrified to see that not only were we charged $4 for each shitty beer that was made to sound complimentary, but our pretty good 3 oz of old fashioned were $16 each.  Maybe for the best old fashioned in the world that would be acceptable, but these were far from that.\\nWe complained to the manager who gave us this self-important and pretentious rant about how amazing the drinks were (well, we're the ones who drank them) and how a good old fashioned is like a fine risotto and somehow that made it cool to charge us $20 for a shot.

After arriving at HF we were debating whether to go back to Old Thousand since it was very loud, lots of people and quite the \\"scene\\". However, when we were text that our table was ready less than 30 minutes later we decided to give it a try. And boy are we glad we did! First off he place is fricken adorable- perfect amount of schmaltz and modern art (biggie/ panda poster with chains is awesome). The music was fun and after some people cleared out the volume of the place was much more manageable. The food was mostly fantastic with a few missteps (they have only been open a month, completely understandable kinks). The cumin beef noodles were rather boring as well as the crispy wontons. The kung pao cauliflower was fantastic but the highlight of our meal was the Mapo eggplant. I would go back just for that dish alone. We sampled two of the three dessert (egg custard tart and sesame balls) both came out warm from the kitchen. At the end of our meal our waiter, Joe, brought out the third dessert for us to try on him. This was also wonderful- a fried dough rolled in 5spice seasoning with a cream on the side for dipping. Although we would go back for the food alone; Joe made our entire evening special from his recommendations on the food to his sweet midwestern charm - we adored him.

I had to get the waitress, Cibonet (beautiful girl, with an unusual and equally beautiful name, pronounced as though it is French), to explain the menu to me.  She was very helpful and guided me through it quickly.  Most important, she had some good recommendations and wasn't shy about it.

The Yelp listing shows two dollar signs, but I would give Parma three dollar signs.  If you really want to experience the place, you will have to drop some coin.  On the other hand, you could just eat an appetizer and probably get your fill.  That would be cheap and probably pretty good too.  Cibonet also recommended the pizza, and that would be an economical option, as would a simple entre.  Just to be clear, I had an entre, a side, and a Scotch, and it cost me $35 before tip.

It is located in CityWalk right outside of the parks. It was a surprise that we were planning and the staff there were so helpful, friendly, and patient. Upon arrival they have a huge confectionary area and a gift shop nearby. The bar is on the upper level. The only reason why I am taking a star off is because I didn't really find the bar staff as welcoming or friendly as the people downstairs. I ordered a vodka with cranberry and it honestly wasn't that great. It seemed like there was very little Tito's in it and the person with me who tried it agreed. The splash of lime I added from the wedge garnish made it better, but wasn't all that great. Nonetheless, I drank it. When we actually ate, our sever Freddy was awesome! He helped accommodate our vegetarian preferences and we were able to get Black Bean Veggie Birgers which taste delicious. He also was very outgoing and friendly. He stopped by several times and didn't rush us at all despite us taking awhile to order. I had my black bean burger with Teriyaki sauce and truffle fries which were very yummy. The milkshakes were huge! They have a window where you can watch them prepare the desserts. It's quite a process! I applaud them. They even provided my cousin and I with a souvenir cup to put our milkshakes in cause we didn't finish them. DEF get a milkshake when you go. They put a generous amount of toppings. I stuck with a simple plain chocolate milkshake despite me having a huge sweet tooth and it didn't disappoint."},{"name":"Lamberts Downtown Barbecue","address":"401 W 2nd St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Worst banana pudding ever.

The trail that leads to the boats is right next to the main entrance to Downtown Disney. \\n\\nDowntown Disney was great! They've come a long way with the construction and it's barely noticeable. I wasn't near the parking lot though, so it could be a different story for those who parked. I've heard nothing but great things about the changes in store for Downtown Disney. Apparently, they are more than doubling the amount of stores etc. It should be very cool once it is finished.\\n\\nAt Downtown Disney we ate at the Rainforest Cafe. I wrote a review on that earlier so I'll sum things up by saying the food was good and the atmosphere very cool. A must see even if it's just once. I'd stay away from Planet Hollywood as the food is just that bad. \\n\\nDowntown Disney has very many cool stores that includes a Lego store, candy store, Disney art store, and many other various restaurants and Disney merchandise stores.

You just cannot go wrong with $50 of wine tasting and a lovely cheese platter all for only $35. When you see this deal, jump on it for a nice date night! \\nThere is a wine dispensing room off to the side of the dining room with white wines on one side and red wines on the other all ranging from the sweetest through the dry. There were even a couple bottles of sake. You get a money card loaded with $50 which you slide into the card slot above the wine of your choice and then dispense an ounce of wine into your glass. The amount is deducted from your card and the prices range anywhere from about $1.60-$7.98 per ounce. Insert, dispense, drink, repeat. Take various wines back to your table to enjoy with a cheese platter that also includes meat, crackers, and nuts. \\nI wasn't very impressed with the chicken pesto pasta that I ordered from the menu. It lacked flavor and seasoning, even with the pesto. Something simple such as more parmesan cheese and garlic would have improved the dish greatly. \\nThe restaurant is a nice, warm atmosphere with an attentive greeter and servers. There is a fireplace with seating around it to relax with a drink while waiting for your movie at cinetopia. A nice thing about dining here is how the staff asks if you are seeing a movie, and if so, at what time. They will make sure you will not be late to your show. \\nI would definitely recommend Vinotopia for wine lovers. Their wine menu is so large that it's more of a wine bible!

He was goaded by some totally off-the-rails waster into drinking way too much the day before at a house-show in Olympia, and he spent the entire day curled up in my friend's Subaru. So, I yanked him out and said \\"We're going for a walk\\", and he said \\"I can't...I can't...\\" But I knew this vacation would be completely wasted if we didn't get him up n' Adam, breathing the outdoor air, and sopping up that alcohol with some food.

Normally I'd rate a completely uneventful burrito as a one-star disgrace, but uneventful was indeed a virtue on this PDX burrito adventure.

First, I will say the decor there is wonderful but that alone does not make a restaurant good. For a restaurant to be considered good, it should have delicious food that will keep customers coming back. Unfortunately, after my experience I most likely will never go back. \\nMy partner and I initially planned to order many things off the menu, including desserts we saw upon entering the building. We ordered the brussel sprouts appetizer and I could barely finish one piece. They were so salty and that's pretty much all I could taste. Salt. Since we were really hungry when we arrived, my partner ate a few more of them but also agreed that the appetizer tasted bad. \\nWhen it was time to order entrees, I wasn't sure what to get. I will say that the waitress was very kind to us and when asked what was her favorite on the menu, she recited verbatim the items listed on the menu pages. I should've taken it as a sign when she didn't answer my question. I should have left after the disappointing appetizer but I stayed and ordered one of the chicken entrees. My partner chose a fish dish. When the entrees arrived they didn't look appealing at all. It definitely was not what I expected for those  prices. My chicken was dry and it had some type of gravy that didn't taste like gravy... I could only eat a few bites. I tried my partner's entree and all I tasted was butter. It was utterly gross. I am in disbelief at how these items made it on the menu. My partner stated it was inedible before sending the entree back and the waitress kindly apologized. \\nWe decided to go against our original plan and forego the desserts. We were going to get milkshakes but after receiving the terrible food, we just wanted to get out of there and find something better ASAP. \\nWe have never had a worse dining experience than this place. 1 Star for the decor and the nice waitress.

Some people may like it, but if you just want to drink a plain Coke or whatnot, you can not get a plain tasting coke, they all have a hint of a fruity flavor....but than they do have very good sweet tea. \\n       So, with me having a positive experience on my first visit, I will definitely be taking a trip back to DoubleDaves, since there is a few more things on there menu that I would love to try and I will be sure to recommend others there."},{"name":"Lamberts Downtown Barbecue","address":"401 W 2nd St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I think I've figured out the secret to a good happy hour here:\\nGo upstairs and belly up to the bar.

They have many attendants and you will be in and out in a matter of minutes. The trick is getting a table.They now have other locations open in Harvard square and somerville, but the Hanover location is the original. You want this experience. Deep in the heart of little Italy, there is nothing like sipping hot, foamy coffee with any of the Italian delicacies. \\n\\nMy favorites here are the hazelnut, amaretto, pistachio, and chocolate hazelnut cannoli. The rum cakes are amazing too. The cannoli are stuffed with their house cream and infused with many flavors. Once they are done they are topped with ornamental chips and pieces that let you know what is inside. Take a few pastries home too! They will be handed to you in the signature blue and white box with baby blue and white baker's twine bow. This is all in itself a true boston experience.

Dunno - I guess sometimes it happens, or I simply start with Barflymag and fly by the seat of my pants. \\n\\nI do remember - that what made me choose this place were the happy hour cocktail options - and they did not disappoint! There's a bunch of cool sounding cocktails - the orange crush was simply delish! I asked for it to be a bit less sweet than usual and the large cocktail was perfect. I also tried a \\"home by sunrise\\" - also quite tasty. Martini drinks were mostly $4 at HH. \\n\\nThe vibe here is casual. I found the staff to be attentive, although sometimes no one was behind the bar which is confusing at first glance. You would hardly even know it was a gay or gay friendly place. But just a fun neighborhood dive with lots of regulars, I'm sure. One loud, obviously gay man was discussing a performance of some sort with his friends (something more portland-weird than gay) and that would have been my only clue. The place filled up quick with folks from the hood, all seeming perfectly chill.\\n\\nThe back room - is for dancing? She asks...

Chocolate chip covered in chocolate was a sugar bomb, with the Italian creme versions being sweet but not overpowering.

Just a half is more than enough.\\n\\nI'm not sure cannoli is going to bump out any other desserts from the top of my roster, but these were excellent pastries and the trip to Mike's is an experience worth the effort.

It's a small monthly meeting/get together and so since I arrived super early I went on the hunt for a new meeting place.

I walked in and asked if they would be able to accommodate 8 people at 7p (two called in sick within the half hour I was wandering) and the skinny girl in the white coat opened her mouth and spit out rude.

So if you go hungry and looking for good, you will probably be disappointed but if you looking for a nice place to relax, have drinks and enjoy the sunset this is the place to go. The downside is that the waiting time, to get a table during dinner time is longggg and during the weekend is even longerrrrr I'm talking about 1-2 hrs waiting  so don't go around that time if you are hungry lol or maybe eat something small before you head out lol \\nDuring lunch time is not bad at all, you get a table within minutes. But the view is definitely better during dinner time because of the sunsets  \\nAnyhow, I truly enjoyed every time I've been there and I'll  continue going every time I'll be in Austin  oh I almost forgot to mention that they have a gift shop and they have all kind of cool things"},{"name":"Laughing Bean Coffee Company","address":"2695 Hastings Street E","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Came in out of the rain..\\n\\nThis is a very nice neighborhood coffee place.\\n\\nFree Wifi and nicely layout.\\n\\nThe chai latte was very tasty but I am not sure why they throw in so much cinnamon on top.

There's so much work that goes into it (and money), that many shops usually skimp on the soup. Menya gives you an entire bowl full. However, there's just not enough taste (umami, stock, whatever you want to call it) in the soup.  I wanted to taste more bone flavor and it just wasn't there.  Instead, my goodness, the soup was SO SALTY!!! Menya please, you got a good thing going there.

The rest of the seating area is open tables along with a patio space for outdoor dining when the weather is nice.  \\nMy spaghetti came with 4 or 5 large meatballs so it's easy to get the dish to share or otherwise be prepared to have leftovers for a meal the following day.  The other entree we ordered was a pappardelle with porcini cream sauce and gorgonzola on baked polenta.  This dish was more a single serving, very delicious, and very rich.  Despite the rich cream sauce, the flavor of the porcini mushrooms was still present which was a nice.  Since most of the pasta dishes don't contain many veggies I ordered a side of the asparagus which is served wrapped in prosciutto with a drizzling of olive oil and grated cheese.  The asparagus was fresh and flavorful.\\nThe menu contains a variety of pasta dishes (some pastas being made in-house), polenta, lasagna, and seafood entrees.  If those don't interest you, you can also order veal, chicken, trout, or steak dishes.   In addition a variety of mozzarella cheeses are available with various small sides of vegetables, olives, and cured meats (several house-made).\\n\\nHappy hour consists of great prices on some of the cured meats & cheeses and several of the small plates.  House wine is $4.  If you're not keen on whatever the house selection is, their wine menu gives a small, but good quality selection of other wines by the glass.  Parma is also open for lunch and offers many of their entrees at a cheaper price as well as several sandwiches made with their meats.  \\n\\nDinner prices range from $11-$25.

I ordered the General Gao's chicken rice meal with fried rice and my order was ready in 25 minutes, a quick turnaround for a Friday night.  The portion was moderate, enough to fill you up for a meal but not enough for leftovers.  In terms of the flavor, both the chicken and rice were overwhelming in terms of flavor and sauce.  I understand Chinese American food is supposed to be greasy, but the extra oil and sauce made the food hard to finish.\\n\\nThe pricing is the biggest gripe I have with this restaurant.  Exchanging white rice for fried rice is an extra $2.25 and add on appetizers to my rice dish were at minimum 3 dollars (many were $4.50).  This puts a one person meal with fried rice and an eggroll at 15 to 16 dollars.  When the food isn't spectacular, many turn to value as a reason to go to a restaurant.

Granted I came on 12/22, but it isn't like people were filling Christmas orders; the majority were just getting something small!  It looks interesting inside with a silver tin ceiling and small chandeliers in the center for decor,  with much more basic surroundings otherwise.  About 10-12 counter people who know their stuff control things as best they can, as a wall-to-wall mob of locals and tourists shove forward to place an order.  That's right, lines are for suckers.  Getting a counter person's attention can be a bit aggravating, but just activate your inner Italian and you're good to go.  This is all worth the wait thankfully, as Mike's has been in business since 1946 and does a great job with Italian pastries and cookies.\\n\\nOriginally we were going to just grab some cannoli, but then I was shocked to find that they had colored Italian macaroons as well.  My favorite bakery back in Brooklyn is WELL known for its cherry macaroon cookie, and I had to try Mike's version.  Therefore, we grabbed a few of the green and red varieties, and threw in a few rainbow cookies as well.  The macaroons were good, but Mike's had only used food coloring which was a little disappointing.  The plain cannolo was excellent, and the chocolate didn't last long either/  The rainbow cookies were great but a notch below the best places I've found; they were a little heavy on the jam and chocolate in particular.  Still, with a blob of tourists mobbing the inside, I was shocked to see Mike's be as good as it was.  Unlike Ferrara's and Veneiro's in NYC, Boston's prominent Italian bakeries measure up!

Verdict? \\n\\nMike's offers a stellar cannoli, with different shell treatments: chocolate dipped, \\"Florentine\\", and plain.   Several different fillings: sweet ricotta, chocolate cream and yellow cream.  You can take the cannoli all the way and have the creamy ends sprinkled with tiny chocolate chips or green nuts-- and don't forget the powdered sugar!  I was intrigued and salivating at the crispy, sugary-syrup-dipped looking Florentine style cannoli, so I bought one.  It was a surprise in that it was some kind of (pea)nutty shell, crunchy and sweet.  Very good.  Very, very sweet.  A pleasant departure from the norm.\\n\\nOn a regular cannoli with a plain shell and sweet ricotta, tiny chocolate chips dotting the ends: my feelings about Mike's were that the ricotta filling is super sweet.  Although definitely up to the challenge to satisfy a sweet tooth without the need of chocolate or powdered sugar, I still prefer a slightly less sweet ricotta filling.  Next, the cannoli shell has almost an overly fried taste to it, not unpleasant but a very developed deep fryer taste.  The ricotta filling is pleasantly creamier than Modern's.  Additionally, Mike's receives major points for the sensory experience upon walking in: you will be surrounded with sweet treats of all colors of the chocolate rainbow and cookies and confections galore.  Remember Charlie's Chocolate Mountain?  Mike's is a land of joy and joyness.  It's a magical land of hope and wonder.  \\n\\nAlas, I heart more the Modern cannoli with it's slightly less sweet ricotta, it's cleaner tasting cannoli shell, the slight grainy-ness of the ricotta, and the fact that the cannoli are filled in the kitchen when you order them and not set up in a case when you come in.

This restaurant has been a favorite of mine since it opened in 2010. The fries, the sauce, the veggie options.... I LOVED (past tense) it all.

The changes are unfortunate. I assume they're trying to cut costs and, as a result, the quality has really suffered. \\n    The most notable change is with the sauces. Some of them are truly disgusting. The sauces used to be one of their strongest selling points, at least in my opinion.  The garlicky caesar dressing and the sherry vinaigrette were my favorite. Today I learned they no longer offer either. They actually don't offer any kind of vinaigrette anymore at all, which I find extremely odd. Instead they offer a really mayonaisey cesar dressing and a watery, tasteless barbecue sauce. Worst of all was the \\"horseradish\\" dressing. Tasted something akin to grass mixed with hot sauce.

She rarely cleaned up the bowls of shells and plates that were OBVIOUSLY ready to be picked up. I asked for a water refill twice and only received a refill once. Before we were able to have dessert, she had the checks ready to go for us, so that we would be able to make a quick departure. I get it. The parking lot was full, the restaurant was full, tables were flipping quickly. Not only did I notice the RUSHED treatment Yasmin provided, but the others in my party noticed as well. As soon as she gave us our checks to sign, she disappeared as quickly as she RUSHED us through dinner. I've come here plenty of times, but I'll be sure, not to be waited on by her ever again!

It doesn't claim to be a restaurant, its just a low key, low maintenance pub,with great beer.  For those of you claiming its no good because you can't bring kids, how can you rate a place badly because of something like that.  Some places are made for kids, some for adults.  Some of us who don't have kids don't want to hang out with yours.  And some of us who have kids like to have a place to go where we can take a break.  That would be like  reviewing a vegan restaurant badly for not serving meat.  Not exactly fair, since that's what it is.  Don't trash a place because it doesn't cater to you, its not just about you.  Like you said there are plenty of good places like laurelwood and HUB that allow kids, but there are good places that don't allow them too, and both are needed and serve a purpose.  Some places don't have tvs, i like to watch sports, does that mean there are a terrible place?  Maybe don't take it so personally and actually enjoy this place or whatever place it is for what it is.  If you don't like the beer, the atmosphere, the service, the food, then so be it, and say that.  Otherwise, no one wants to hear you don't like that you can't bring your kids, and i'm sure the people there don't want to babysit your kids while you have a beer."},{"name":"Huong Vietnamese Restaurant","address":"1270 Morse Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I just moved into Columbus and being Vietnamese, one of the first things I did was look on yelp for the best Vietnamese restaurant in Columbus. I went to Huong with my mom and was very happy with the authenticity and variety of the food.  I ordered the goi du du (papaya salad w/ beef jerky), bun thit heo nuong cha gio (rice noodles with grilled marinated pork and fried spring roll), and cafe sua da (Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk over ice).  My mom ordered the bun bo Hue (spicy beef and pork noodle soup originating from the central Hue region of Vietnam) and  che ba mau (3 colors dessert).  The papaya salad was pretty good and the beef jerky was delicious, although I would prefer the nuoc mam (special fish sauce) to be less sweet and more tangy (perhaps if more lime was added).  The noodle with grilled pork and egg roll dish had very flavorful meat and a wonderful amount of fresh veggies at the bottom of the bowl ready to be mixed in with the rest.\\n\\nI returned for a second visit with some friends to try the banh xeo (vietnamese crepe), banh mi thit (vietnamese sandwich), and pho (\\"flagship\\" beef noodle soup).  Banh xeo is a rare menu item to find in a vietnamese restaurant and Huong makes it extremely well, with ample amounts of pork, shrimp, and beansprouts cooked into the crepe along with lots of lettuce for wrapping the pieces of crepe up for dipping in the nuoc mam (yes that's how you are supposed to eat it!).  The banh mi thit is enormous and has tons of flavorful marinated pork with shredded pickled daikon/carrot and cilantro in a fresh baguette, and is probably the best bang-for-your buck on the menu.  The pho is very good, with a flavorful broth, well cooked noodles, a decent amount of thin sliced beef, and plenty of fresh basil, bean sprouts, and lime supplied on the side for you to add to your soup as you like (A wedge of lime is very important to squeeze into pho for full flavor).  The one downside to the pho menu compared to other pho restaurants is that the customization is lacking, as other pho restaurants have much more options for customizing your pho (such as different types of beef).\\n\\nOverall, I give Huong a 5/5 because of the great variety of authentic vietnamese dishes that are done very well, and I was very impressed by the menu and the general quality of food.  The service is very quick and efficient as well.  The main downsides are the lack of customization of the pho, and the nuoc mam sauce being a little too sweet compared to what I would prefer (of course my mom's nuoc mam will always be the standard that all vietnamese restaurants have to live up to!)."},{"name":"Carbonara Trattoria","address":"5499 Chamblee Dunwoody Rd","city":"Dunwoody","stars":"4","text":"Great lunch location in the heart of Dunwoody Village.

Same crew, with a few new ones, but a totally different concept this time. Boi, it's been a few weeks that I've craving for some Korean fried chicken becasue of all the Korean dramas I've been watching, lol! \\nBut tadaaaa! As if this place can read minds and opened for me to satisfy my Korean fried chicken thoughts :))))\\nTried them yesterday with the kids for some late lunch. Our teen, who said she's not hungry (ate lunch in school) and was only looking for a dessert. No dessert in the menu. I said, just try the chicken at least. So, I ordered the half and half chicken: regular fried and soy-garlic. Asked for the sweet and spicy sauce and ranch on the side; kimchi bulgogi quesadilla, which by the way, is on a Friday promo sale for $2.!!!!; and 20-pieces chicken wings, half plain and half hot.\\nWe really appreciate the staff for letting us have the sale quesadilla, for being lenient on us, because the promo was only until 2 pm, and we got there a minute prior but it's already around 2:05pm when they took our order. :))) 1 extra brownie point for it! They have a Friday special these month of December, from 11:30am to 2 pm so don't forget to come by then!\\nThe fried chicken are different cuts of the chicken, dark or white meat. You can pick from some options: regular fried, soy garlic, Sweet and spicy or spicy. They said the spicy sauce is just like the sweet and spicy, but made spicier. I didn't get to taste it because even tho I asked for it on the side, they forgot to give it to me and I forgot to follow up because I got too busy eating the chicken while they're hot! Hahahaha. The regular fried chicken tasted somewhat similar to, if you're familiar with the popular Filipino chain, Jollibee, fried chicken. It's crispy, moist and tasty!\\nThe soy garlic, at first I was afraid to try because I thought, I don't want to waste my other half of order if this didn't taste well...and of course, I was surprised it tasted yummy and addicting too! That huge potato wedge that came with it tasted like sweet potato because of the sweet, soy-garlic flavor it's seasoned with. The sweet and spicy sauce and ranch on the side, did well to compliment the regular wings and regular fried chicken we got.\\nThe quesadilla, a little crispy on the outside, cheesy on the inside is good too. Mildly spiced due to the kimchi, but it tasted just like a regular meat quesadilla we get from any Mexican restaurant. Also, good!\\nThe regular chicken wings....a little disappointing because they are just so-so. They are on a little bland side, and on the border for being dry and hard. It's good to dip on the sauces tho. The hot wings on the other hand, at least, are almost the same as the other hot wings you get anywhere. The spice is a buffalo wing flavor, not so spicy, and not sweet.\\nOne more thing I didn't like, unfortunately, were the parts of chicken we got. We got the ribs part, mostly, so we really didn't get much meat for our $19.99 and that made me a little sad, because I was really looking forward to enjoy a lot of juicy meat! \\nIf you take them home, like we did with our leftovers, they get tougher even with a little 3 minute-325 degree oven heat because, like I said, we got mostly bones due to the ribcage part of the chicken.\\nBut overall, we still love the texture and taste of what we've had so far and I already recommended this to my friends, and I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to taste Korean fried chicken, that tasted close to the Filipino fried chicken recipes, if you're interested. \\nWe're coming back, and I hope, I really do, that I don't get the ribs part anymore because I really want to enjoy some juicy meat. This will be one of my favorite place addition, in Buford highway.\\nKeep up the great taste and crunchiness Hello Chicken!"},{"name":"Lima Criolla","address":"6406 N Interstate 35 Frontage Rd, Ste 1550","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Portions vary in size.

The quality of the broth was decent, though they didn't have the variety of soup bases that they do overseas (tomato soup broth is my favourite). Moreover, the lamb and beef meat were sliced quite thinly, which was good. However, one of the problems was that they kept messing up our order or not bringing us certain items that we had ordered. I think we had to ask for the veggies we ordered three times before it finally came, and even then, they didn't bring the correct ones. \\n\\nAs for the inside of the restaurant, I found it to be on the dirty side.

And this is a restaurant that is learning to fly and missing. Where do we begin? \\n\\nThe layout of the restaurant is very strange. As you enter, there is a small flight of stairs and a hostess stand at the top. So it's a bit like going to meet the wizard of Oz as you come in. And if they ever get really busy (not from return visitors I'm sure) there is nowhere to wait for a table. The chairs are very trendy looking and also extremely uncomfortable and didn't match the tables very well. The staff was also dressed trendy and uncomfortable in their duties. We were seated and given ice water in steaming hot glasses from the dishwasher. To the surprise of at least three staffers (who must have skipped out on science class) this results in cracked glasses and water everywhere. \\n\\nThe menus are extremely...  ambitious. It's as if a professional chef came up with some great ideas. Then ran it through a foreign translator. Then outsourced the creation of the food to an advertising agency. Just about everyone in our group was trying to use their phone to figure out what all the various toppings and \\"spreads\\" were made of. Three of the four of us ordered toasted cheese sandwiches to keep it simple. But it comes with some strange jam on it. Nobody wanted jam on their toasted cheese. The waitress talked my wife into it. She said it was sweet and insisted we woukd like it. That was a lie. \\n\\nI ordered French toast. Again, for simplicity. But that too was a mistake. We all wondered what sort of toasted cheese sandwich would cost $12 and not come with any sides. It turns out, a very small sandwich with cheeses not suitable for a sandwich at all. And if you like fetted clover and onions, you're going to love that sweet jam. \\n\\nAs we got our food (it took a long time) I witnessed a couple leaving behind two empty boxes. The server brought them some take out boxes for their unfinished food and they just sort of \\"hoofed it\\". Yikes. He looked for a tip, and given the sigh and paper crumble I am thinking it was less than desirable. \\n\\nMy French toast came out late. Not sure why. Its the quickest thing to make. It looked good.  And at first I thought it was filled with yellow custard. But then I realized that my toast was served rare. And that jello material inside was uncooked eggs. Pan seared French toast? \\n\\nSomeone came out of the kitchen as we picked over our food and tried to give away some brussel sprouts. They were actually for another table that had also received inedible food and this was their best last hope to eat something stable. My wife had ordered a side of sprouts and they were \\"not bad\\"!  But they also cost $5 to $ 7 extra. Want fries with your $14 burger? Add $5.\\n\\nThe restroom seemed clean,  which is always good. But as others have noted this place has horrible lighting, so it was hard to tell. Why is the bathroom candle lit? And what was in that hand soap? It left my hands oddly dry and smelled like old gym socks. \\n\\nAnd then there is the beer. If you are still interested, the beer is also pretty miserable. The beer menu is as badly assembled as the food menu. It reads sort of like how a snooty waiter might explain cheeses to you. At the end of the day you want an IPA, porter, or something else. What you get here is a whole mess of sour and hazy beer. We ordered the darkest stuff they had (sounded and looked like a stout) but it was obviously either a ruined batch...  or someone just really likes sour beer. Classify your beer folks!! \\n\\nAll in all, it was a miserable experience. If there is any hope for this place to make it, they need to hire someone with experience managing a restaurant and maybe also a brew master who knows how to NOT make a sour beer. I am beginning to think that the sour taste is an unintended result of the brewers fermentation practices. \\n\\nWe came for the ale trail stamp, and we got it. But we are hoping that by next year this place has been turned over to something else. \\n\\nIf you still insist on coming here, drink your water straight from the carafe (avoid a hot glass and skip the beer), order the brussel sprouts (only edible thing on the menu), and if you use the restroom bring your own soap. \\n\\nParking is available right around the corner for $5 if you can park in a four foot space and get the machine to print you a receipt. \\n\\nGod speed!"},{"name":"Rookies Cantina","address":"140 South Highway 17-92","city":"Longwood","stars":"4.5","text":"I haven't been before but had heard good things.\\nWhile I didn't care for my choice my husband and our friends devoured theirs!\\nThe service was spot on, the drinks generous and food reasonable and fresh.\\nMy personal choice was the quesadilla and tostado.....let's just say they are generous with the cilantro...I myself can only take it in small doses.

The fat was well rendered, moist throughout, with a great tasting bark. I dug into the ribs which delivered a burst of flavors.

But I want to focus my review on perhaps one of the most popular Italian desserts of all: the cannoli.\\n\\nI appreciate how Modern has chosen to keep the cannoli simple and not destroy such a classic dessert with too many flavors (Mike's has expanded their cannoli menu to include some unusual sounding flavors, while I do enjoy some of them, sometimes it is nice to keep it simple).  My recommendation would be to order a plain shell cannoli with ricotta cheese.  Don't add powdered sugar - it makes the cannoli get soggy faster.  The consistency of the filling is creamier than Mike's.  Additionally - and correct me if I am wrong - I believe they fill the cannolis fresh on the spot.\\n\\nBe prepared to pay with cash, as Modern does not accept credit cards (I believe they used to with a $10 minimum).\\n\\nWhile I don't have any plans to shun Mike's for good, I will continue to make Modern a regular stop during all my trips to the North End."},{"name":"Broadway Ristorante & Pizzeria","address":"995 N State Rd 434","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"3","text":"Normally I wouldn't write a review of a place that I order pizza from but recently I had a really great experience so I had to share.

I also tried an eggplant dish which was just okay- I wish that you could request different pasta sauce because their tomato sauce is very chunky and actually detracts from the dish.

I loved the food and the prices were really fair.  I got the Flaming Saganaki and my bf got Feta and Kalamata Olives, both served with pita bread, to start.  The Flaming Saganaki was something I've never experienced before.  It's deep fried cheese set ablaze at your table with lemon juice.  While it was awesome, I wouldn't get it as an appetizer again, but it would be good for a late night snack after drinking (read: rich and greasy).  For our entrees I got the Deluxe Gyro with Greek Salad and my bf got the Pork Souvlaki with Greek Salad.  The bf said his Souvlaki was a tad over done.  I loved my Gyro though.

By the time we tried Amnesia, we already visited 8 breweries and 1 bar.  In my opinion, I would have to say this is the bottom of my list.

I guess this explains why they are planning to close this location and re-open at another area.  \\n\\nThat leaves me with #2 reason, and that is the service.  The guy behind the counter defines the word \\"unfriendly\\".  A customer was actually talking to him about the relocation and if he was planning on relocating with the brewery.

I noticed that the ketchup is organic (but it is at Sunnystreet too...at least the one in W-ville)...and some of the items on the menu seemed to be all natural or organic. But even tofu can be synthetic so if the one thing that makes them different (and so much more expensive than say, a Qdoba), why not have a mission statement on the menu that says \\"passionate about serving organic food\\" or something of the like. It was great to try but the food (if not organic) is completely overpriced. Even if it's just organic on certain dishes, TELL US in the menu.

The kettle chips were good. \\n\\nNext, ice cream. The experience was fun - these are the most over the top milkshakes you've ever seen.

We had migas with avocado, the special Belgian waffle with strawberries, the biscuits and gravy (OMG, OMG), the portabella scramble, the lemon-poppyseed pancakes (also OMG), and the Italian scramble, and several $2/4-strip sides of yummy bacon along with the French-press special of the day, hot chocolates, and sodas. \\n\\nThe only downside to being so popular and busy is how loud it was -- but they could have fixed that -- the music was too loud.

Apparently, Czar bar would rather serve no one than us because we were not ordering drinks fast enough for them.  Poor marketing - since we at least made the half-empty bar look slightly fuller. \\n\\nAs for the drinks, while they were very good, I agree with others on here that they were overpriced.

Why was everything so expensive? I swore that I checked the menu online and it said that hardly anything was over $20. Was the menu outdated? Did Yelp have incorrect information? \\n\\nNo, I'm just dumb and walked into the wrong restaurant. You see, Enoteca Vespaio is on the left side and Vespaio is on the right side. This issue could have easily been resolved if I had looked at the menu that was posted outside of Vespaio, but I did not because I thought I had already read it. Whoops. \\n\\nI started stressing out because I never eat at \\"fancy\\" restaurants. I don't remember the last time I paid more than $20 for a single entree, which means that it has never actually happened. (I'm not even kidding. Not once in my 24 years of life have I paid more than $20 for a single dish.) I apologize profusely to my family because I swore I checked the menu online and I price checked everything. My Mom thought maybe I had seen the lunch menu on accident, but I knew I didn't see anything saying lunch only. My Mom tells me that it's okay and that it's my birthday, so we'll just enjoy it. After all, we never eat at places like this, so it will be a treat for everyone. Okay, I'll try to calm down, but anxiety is already running on high.  \\n\\nBread will be brought to your table with herb butter on the side. That butter is the stuff of which dreams are made.

The mussels were so good, as were the tomatoes. I did not eat any of the bread that came with the dish, but my parents said it was very good. \\n\\nI went with the Spaghetti alla Carbonara and it was very tasty. The portion was decently sized and there was more than enough food. The sauce was good, the egg was nicely done, and the pancetta was delicious. My family ordered the Toscana pizza, the Spaghetti Pomodoro E Melanzane, and another dish with angel hair pasta and scallops. Everyone enjoyed their dishes and said they were quite good. \\n\\nAfter dinner, my family ordered coffees and the tiramis√π. I didn't try the tiramis√π, but the espresso-mascarpone sorbetto on the side was wonderful. \\n\\nOverall, even though I have no experience with fine dining, the food was fantastic and seemed to be worth the price to me. The service was prompt without being overbearing. The only complaint I have is that the restaurant gets crowded and loud very quickly.

Out of those 50 times there were maybe 4 times the food was not up to my expectations.  (I always order from the menu and have never had buffet.)  They have always always offered to do whatever is needed to make our table happy.\\n\\nThey are a 'family' based restaurant and I have come to know them all by name and enjoy this type of friendly relationship.  But I would not return (with any amount of friendliness) if the food wasn't amazing.  They have consistently had some of the best Naan in the area and their Masala Chai is actually spiced (and where else can you get choice of dairy/soy/ decaf with free refills).  I am a huge Chai critic and make it from scratch at home.....their Chai is the best I have had around here and I have tried most all the other places.\\n\\nThey make our dishes any way we like.  The Saag without dairy? No problem and in fact they will ask if we want coconut milk or something else added instead.  They are willing to think creatively to make sure it tastes good with our preferences.  The curry always flavorful and tons of veggies. (we are veggie so don't know about their meats).\\nThe food ALWAYS tastes fresh and I find they strike a perfect pitch with flavor/spice.Any time I want Indian food and I think of all the options.....nothing in the area even comes close to Tibet's.  \\n\\nYes, there are many times the service is 'slow' and the food comes out in a goofy order.  And I can see where that would piss many people off and in fact would bother me if I didn't love the food, people and general vibe of this place.\\nWhen they are slow and not 'on the ball', I simply get up and walk over to the counter or speak directly to the chef cooking at the window.  They never get upset or have attitude.\\nSlow they may be at times but you won't meet a kinder group of people working in a restaurant.  You will never ever deal with attitude or apathy here.  \\n\\nI realize people have written reviews that are not anywhere close to my experience and that makes me sad because this place and the people are great.  But no place bats 100% and everyone has different needs, perspectives and taste buds."},{"name":"Yanagi","address":"4404 W William Cannon Dr, Ste B","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Very cool place out of a poor strip center location, and good food at reasonable prices.

She was so kind and talkative, had a playful demeanor as we chatted about what to order, and was really helpful in catering to my request about subbing fruit for the toast or potatoes that was going to come with my meal. I was pretty hungry but she assured me that the scramble would be quite filling so instead of ordering the full french toast, she suggest I get a half order for half the cost (which turned out to be a great idea as my meal was incredibly filling and 2 pieces of the french toast was plenty!)\\n\\nMy meal was so delicious, delicious doesn't do the food justice. I'm in love with the various scrambles and omelettes from Stepping Stone Cafe, but after having the one here, this is my new favorite go to place for a scramble! The eggs were soft and airy and cooked perfectly. The pieces of ham and the fresh tomatoes mixed with garlic was heaven. All that with the addition of provolone cheese that was folded into the scramble with more sprinkled on top was simply divine. Seriously one of the most flavorful and best tasting scrambles I have had.\\n\\nAnd then there was the Crunchy French Toast. Oh. My. God. This was my first time trying a version of french toast that was coated in corn flakes then grilled and french toast will never be the same now. The outside was perfectly crunchy and crisp. The inside was soft and sweet. Spreading some butter on top, letting it melt, then adding syrup before eating is definitely the way to go. I cannot give enough praise to the deliciousness of the crunchy french toast created here! It's something you just have to experience for yourself!\\n\\nThe best tasting scramble I've ever had and the best tasting french toast I've ever had, coupled with the nicest and happiest waiter I've ever seen earns this bistro top marks all around.

Enough venting - let's get to the FACTS:\\n\\nShowed-up yesterday with guests of ours who have travelled some 2000+ miles to experience true-Texas hospitality and flavor.  Although the Oasis isn't exactly true-Texas flavor, we \\"thought\\" we knew it as true-Texas hospitality.  Haha!  BAH to that.  The place was almost entirely deserted at the 3:30pm arrival time.  We did the self-tour with our guests who were awed by the views and smells of the food being served to the sparsely-crowded place.  Being that this is a \\"tourist-trap\\" with over-rated, under-valued, and over-priced food, I suggested we get some \\"chips-n-salsa\\" and just take in the views for a short while before heading out for a more suitable dinner.\\n\\nWe made our way back down to the front desk - and this is where we meet Mr. Scrawny-I-think-I'm-important-because-I-wear-a-walkie-talkie-and-my-tag-says-Manager.

We heard your \\"hood\\"-lingo quite easily - so tone it down next time.\\n\\nWe explained that we wanted our (from VERY-far-away-out-of-town) guests to have a short, continued experience at the Oasis by grabbing a table for some Chips-n-Salsa.  Well, Mr. Scrawny went in to some \\"hood\\"-lingo-laced rant about how he had a \\"7-hour\\" wait, they were really, really busy, and couldn't allow us a table for just \\"Chips-n-salsa and waters\\".  SCREEEEEECH!  Wait just a cockin'-pickin' minute!  Who the @#$%#$%@ said anything about waters?  For all Mr. Scrawny knew, (which is actually true), our guests are quite the experienced wine drinkers and had fully planned on indulging in some local, Texas wines while munching down on some chips-n-salsa.  FURTHERMORE, had the chips-n-salsa been a BIG hit, the menu (and surrounding smells) could have encouraged scrapping our evening's dinner plans for the Oasis; our party of 6 \\"could've\\" made it a far more \\"worthy\\" opportunity for the Oasis.  \\n\\nBut no...Mr. Scrawny needed to repeat several times how he could not provide us with a table in his \\"BUSY\\", \\"7-hour-wait\\" joint for just \\"chips-n-salsa-n-waters\\", and that we could hang out in the lounge areas.\\n\\nWell, Mr. Scrawny...you and the rest of the folks there (whom I'm guessing are mostly college students hoping to earn a few bucks while struggling through school)...

I derive that something must be off in the kitchen and I move myself to a better viewing angle, I see the one man working over the flat-top in a very *casual style. A few corn tortillas lazily warming on a corner of the griddle. An single red pepper being slowly sliced on the cutting board. As I take note of the full rail of tickets, I check my watch and observe the passing of a full five minutes to assemble an order of tacos. They get wrapped and bagged and the number called is a full 26 orders away from mine.  I stop and rationalize the situation, maybe the equipment is broken? Perhaps the produce order hadn't arrived that day? but all of my observations indicated a perfectly functional and well stocked cart kitchen. A few more minutes and a burrito is called from the window, I notice sequentially I have another 25 tickets between the number in my hand and the order in the window. I shake my head and realize that it would take far less time to finish my 15 minute ride home and cook something than it would to wait here, so I approach the window and politely ask for a refund. The woman working the window turns and asks the cook about it in a very annoyed and hurried manner.  The cook responds in a huff, finds my ticket, wraps the burrito in 30 seconds flat and jabs it into my hand. I slowly turn around and see 20 hungry impatient eyes staring me down. I wearily stumble down the steps and a young lady bounds up to me. \\"what's your number?\\" she inquires. I look into my hands and see the ticket stub with a 76 poking from the edge of my grip.  She looks down at her hand holding the number 52. Her lip curls in anger as she huffs away in to the shadow. \\nI slowly mounted my bike and pedaled away, unable to eat a burrito with the heavy feeling feeling of injustice.

They had a BBQ grill outside which wasn't cooking on a Monday night.\\n\\nAs soon as we sat down, the bartender approached us and asked what we wanted. I tried starting some brief conversation, to warm up and find out what the best options for the beer were. His response was terse, short, and barely informative. My buddy asked what style of beer the winter seasonal was and bartender's response was \\"it has no style. all of our beers are unique\\" as he abruptly walked away. I had no idea why this guy was being a dick. When he got back we just ordered the sampler and all of the seasonals. It was 8.50 plus 1.50 for each of the extra four -- much more expensive than hopworks (10 + 2 from cask for 8 or so).\\n\\nThe beer itself was not to my tastes. I couldn't tell if it was odd pairing of the three base ingredients (hops, yeast, malt) or if they got fancy with secondary additives. I tasted off flavors in their beer, although I'm guessing it probably wasn't from uncleanliness or brewing methods, but their brewing style. I prefer that the real flavors of the beer are accentuated, which these beers do not do.\\n\\nOne of their IPAs was good, the rest were subpar. We pounded and left. Trust me, if you want quality beer for a much better price and a good food menu go to HUB.

I liked the fact that the pub was divided into a restaurant side and a pub side. That way I don't have to feel embarrassed when I get obliterated and there are people around me just trying to enjoy their food. Another important positive factor was the waitress diligently refilling my beer. i don't like my glass to go dry and she definitely earned her tip. One unfortunate note was the potato wedges. My buddy ordered them and got seven wedges for almost $8. I could buy two sacks of potatoes for that price. The slightly redeeming factor for the price is that my friend is a vegan and they thoughtfully didn't serve them with bacon. He was happy....until he paid. Another person i was with ordered the four cheese pizza. You receive a decent sized pizza. Three of us ate it. It wasn't bad, although the thin crust could have been crunchier and I could have done without the the huge blob of pesto in the centre (I'm sure some of you are pesto lovers and may appreciate this, but not me). The beer is good. Its all local and its all good! The black and tan isn't quite my taste but I actually didn't mind it. I tried all of their beers and I enjoyed them all, mind you after about four it was hard to decipher bad beer since I was getting quite the nice buzz on.

A very thick sauce and plenty of it. It is rich and creamy. Perhaps the only complaint about it would be that it can be a bit sweet. Ask for it to be spicy and it will perfect. (Asking for it to be spicy only gives a medium heat. Ask for very spicy if you want to feel a burn.)\\n\\nLamb Korma - The lamb is usually very tender. The sauce is thick, as usual for this restaurant. It has a few raisins and nuts in it as well which go perfect with the spices used.\\n\\nThe owner usually serves and he is extremely nice.

When I go to get barbecue, what I'm really there for is the meat.  The chicken was fine; it tasted like good grilled chicken.  The brisket that I had was pretty fatty, and not really to my liking.  The meat overall was decent, but not great.  I would say that relative to Rudy's, to me, it was about on par.  The food was expensive and the portions were small.

Below the whipped cream was a warm flavorless milkshake that I made the waitress aware of. She took it away and brought me a new shake which was colder and a little more flavorful.

But, I must say I did not feel it was deserving of the hype. I am not saying it was bad. My food was quite flavorful and overall good.\\nBut, I was not blown away by any stretch. \\nTwo main complaints:\\nThey seem to serve the food in the \\"whenever it comes out\\" style. This works for people who are sharing, but I am a vegetarian and my husband a carnivore and we don't share food. So, three of the small plates I ordered came out one after the other. Then we waited 20 minutes and all of his came in a row. Awkward.....we had to have dinner at different times.\\nSecond: I did not think the vegetarian selection was good. No vegetarian main dish plates on the menu. And no tofu to be found on the menu anywhere. Typically a vegetarian can be in good shape with Chinese food, but they just do not seem to cater to special diets. \\nOne other small complaint is that we ordered the Smashed Cucumber. I took one bite and it was soooooo spicey that I almost started crying. I LOVE spicey food and generally can handle a lot, but this was extreme. However, no where on the menu does it imply in anyway that it is \\"hot\\" and the server did not mention it either. If something is this much of an extreme.....I just think they should give people a bit of a heads up. \\nLast thing is that dinner for 2 people was $125.

If you are going to go there, get it.  Ours was tender, juicy, and full of flavor.  I don't think it's the best chicken in PDX, but it's solid and very respectable. Probably 4-start worthy.\\n\\nUnfortunately, we found the rest of the dishes far less impressive:\\n- The full chicken comes with a huge bundle of french fries, which 2 times in a row have been really soft and soggy with grease.  Our group of 6+ people couldn't/didn't want to finish them.  Though I'm not a chef, I was guessing their fry oil temp was too low which didn't give them any crisp.  Something as basic and fundamental as making a decent fry shouldn't be a problem!\\n- The Jalea Mixta (kind of a seafood/veggie mix) had that overly-strong seafood smell/flavor...the kind where the stuff smelled it it wasn't super fresh.  Not to mention that I'm pretty sure the veggies (consisting of corn, peas, and cubed carrots) were from a frozen bag. \\n- Finally, I found the infamous \\"Inca Kola\\" to be, perhaps, the sweetest drink I have ever tasted in my life!  The beset way I can describe it is that it's like bubble gum flavored higg fructose corn syrup mixed in equal parts with Mountain Dew; bleh!  It's way too sweet to be paired with any dinner item, in my opinion.  Admittedly this is directly the fault of El Inka since they don't make it, but beyond trying a couple sips for the novelty of trying a historically Peruvian soda that's been around for ~80 years, I really don't see why they carry it.\\n\\nSo yeah, consider trying El Inka to support this unique mom and pop restaurant, and if you go the roasted chicken is by far the best dish to get and highly recommended, but don't blame me if anything else you try is kind of disappointing."},{"name":"Thai Orchid Restaurant","address":"1004 Washington St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"My favorite thai food.
