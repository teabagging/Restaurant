Impeccable service, phenomenol presentation, an amazing layer of flavors in each dish and an overall great experience. Both the chef and owner were exceptionally attentive to us and our needs. The time and effort they gave us really made us feel welcome. And the food was insanely incredible this time. Each dish was so different and unique. No dish was similar to the other and trust me they have plenty of dishes to try!  I've never seen anything like it.

So the style is you can order a few plates and then get more plates from their dim sum cart. Our dim sum waiter was terrible, he didn't tell us the price of our dishes. We also don't eat pork so we told them at the beginning of our meal and then the dim sum waiter passed us several times. He didn't even bother to explain why he was passing us. It was a good 20 minutes where we were without food. It wasn't until we asked the main waiter that our dim sum waiter didn't come by was when they told us that most of the dim sum dishes had pork in it. So we just sat around eating veggie dishes with no meat dishes in sight. That's just ridiculous and poor service. They offered that we could order their $70 steak but that's not what we came for. I didn't enjoy our experience at all and would never come back here again. With a ton of farm to table restaurants in Austin I wouldn't recommend this place.

RuSan's the answer!\\n\\nIf you are looking for decent sushi and cheap eats in the form of Americanized - Japanese cuisine, RuSans is your answer. There are several eateries located In the Atlanta area and my personal favorite is in Tower Place retail section in Buckhead. This establishment has been there for approximately 10 years and is answer for cheap Japanese cuisine and an affordable price. It's on top floor closer to the Copeland's restaurant. Once you walk inside, it has a little bit of a diner flair to it, you'll also notice some long sushi bars around the restaurant. You are greeted by some loud chants. On your immediate right is a bar area for beer, wine and sake. They have a decent selection of sake with some of my favorites being the Matsumi brand. If you arrive on a weekend evening, brace yourself for a crowd and a little bit of a wait. If possible, sit at the sushi bar where you get the better experience.\\n\\n\\nRu Nagato the owner is usually at this location at I always try to get a seat near him at the sushi bar. I rarely order off the menu and let him make something for me out if his own creation. The menu is quite extensive with both traditional and non-traditional Japanese dishes. I would recommend ordering ala-carte from the menu, but they also have some yummy sushi platters. The Protein and Super Protein Bomb are pretty good and they come with gobs of different items. One of my guilt pleasures is a hand-roll called power-temaki - it's sea urchin (uni) and quail egg wrapped in a seaweed wrap. It will practically drive you through the roof. Of course you have to have an acquired taste for it.\\n\\n\\nThe minuses are on a busy night, service may suffer and the quality can be sometimes compromised on certain items. But, you will definitely get your money's worth and have a great time as well.\\nMake sure you grab a few shots of sake! \\n\\nThe quality, delivery and execution can be questionable at times and the service suffers on the packed weekends. The menu can be a bit overwhelming as there are many items to choose from. I would suggest eliminating many of the items to streamline the menu.\\n\\nWarning: This is not authentic Japanese dining.

Not much there is to complain.\\n\\nThis lovely little restaurant is as cheese-themed as it gets.  As you walk in, you're blasted by the yellow walls and decor.  On the right side, you'll see a big periodic table of different cheeses with their country of origins and pronunciations.  I learned a lot while I waited for the food, and the table made for some fun conversation fodder.  Who would have thought that American cheese came from America??\\n\\nI ordered the braised brisket grilled cheese with the truffle fries.  In addition, I was also able to taste the \\"As Gouda As It Gets.\\"  Both were outstanding.  The brisket was tender and the BBQ sauce was light (and also on the side too so you can choose to dip).  Along with the fontina cheese, the sandwich felt just right.  Meat and cheese blended in so well and the sauce on the side just added that extra \\"wetness\\" if I wanted. Fries were outstanding; that truffle oil was great.  Never had butter and oil felt so good on the hands.  \\n\\nAs Gouda As It Gets was the \\"lighter\\" version of the two, but I enjoyed it just as much.  The chicken went very well with the gouda, spinach and peppers.  Combine it with the dipped tomato soup!  Towards the end, I think the spinach sogged the sandwich a bit, so you should definitely eat this and not stop!  Or be a slow eater.... However, this sandwich contrasted nicely with the braised brisket.  If I could have, I probably would have ordered both of these for myself.  They were just that great.  \\n\\nHighly recommend this place for your grilled cheese needs.  The folks here also offer your basic grilled cheese needs too, if you do not want anything fancy and want to stick to your childhood memories.

The restaurant was located in the middle of a suburb in a mansion style house which might look good on the outside but when you walk in, it's a series of small dining rooms where patrons dine with privacy if you fancy that. Otherwise I personally don't prefer that at all as that defeats the purpose of eating out to enjoy the lively atmosphere. We were in the big room with three other occupied tables that night and I must say the energy was quite low from the other tables. So the whole setup just wasn't as good as it could have been.\\n\\nAnyways, on the the food which was pretty good overall. We ordered a number of dishes including fish, spicy beef, chicken, veggies, just too many to name as we had 12+ people in the table. The only negative thing that occurred that night was a spider that crawl into the middle of our table from the ceiling that freaked some of the girls out. The other negative that just came to my mind was the poor service which was unexpected especially with this type of place as the waiter didn't even pour the soup into our bowls at the beginning of the meal and also didn't really come back to check on us in terms of refilling the water since we are eating spicy food. \\n\\nSo I wouldn't beg to come back here since it's pretty far from Boston but the food was pretty good, so if my friends insist on coming here then I would obliged.

Anderson Lane","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I hate to give a poor review because I want badly to support ethical and organic fast food options.  However, I was disappointed on many levels by my experience with Elevation Burger and want to be honest in hopes that they will listen and change.  Here are my main complaints:\\n\\n(1) Misleading \\"Green\\" Advertising:  The word \\"ORGANIC\\" is all over this place - the advertising, the website, the storefront.  But from what I can gather from further investigation, the only things that are actually organic are the meat and some of the ingredients in the veggie burgers.  I find advertisements with \\"ORGANIC\\" in huge letters, followed by small print specifying that they are only talking about the beef (this was an ad on the Anderson Lane storefront) to be deceitful.  I wonder how many customers leave thinking they ate an organic lunch when in reality they did not.  I would like to know about the dairy products and produce especially.  Are they treated with pesticides?  GMOs?  Bovine growth hormone?  These things are just as bad if not worse than non-organic beef.  If Elevation Burger wants to advertise itself as sustainable, green, organic or healthy, it should either put its money where its mouth is in all ingredients on its menu, or be very, very clear that only the beef is 100% organic.  I will stick to Terra Burger when I am looking for a truly organic meal for this reason - they also use organic dairy and produce. \\n\\n(2) Problematic Online Ordering:  I ordered online from work and 20 minutes later came to pick up.  They had not even started my order and the place was not busy.  They claimed that I had not specified a time, which I had.  I asked if I could have my mango Honest teas while waiting but it turned out that they did not carry any Honest tea (which I had already paid for).  Nonetheless, the manager was very apologetic, refunded the teas, and had the order ready within a few minutes.  Problems don't end there...\\n\\n(3) Poorly Constructed Food, Incorrect Orders:  I don't know if it was due to the rush from my order not having been ready by the time I arrived, but when I got home the food looked like it had been thrown together by monkeys.  More disappointing, the burgers themselves were not dressed as ordered.  My cheeseburger had no cheese, my veggie burger had no cheese (although I clearly had a receipt saying I had paid for cheese on both), and my husbands vegan burgers did not have any of the condiments I had requested.\\n\\nAll this said, I am giving two stars rather than one because the burgers, despite the frustration and wait, were not all bad.  The veggie burger was a bit dry (I had to add mayo and ketchup at home to make it edible) but my husbands vegan burgers were very flavorful.  The fries were greasy and not crisp enough for my liking, but tasty.  I can't say they were bad because I ate all of mine on the drive home!\\n\\nSadly, the food just wasn't good enough OR organic enough to overcome the problems I had and make me want to go back.

I got a buffalo chicken pita, with nice chunks of chicken, a just spicy enough sauce, plenty of veggies and what I presume to be a wheat pita.

The appropriate server came to our table to introduce herself and confirm our orders, and our first course was brought out. The fried olives. Fantastic, perfect blast of flavor in every bite. The main course did take awhile, but we were forewarned, and well taken care of in between. The moment a drink was emptied we had a server come to check on us - didn't matter if it was a glass of water or our cocktails. The waitstaff was never pushy in asking if we needed anything, and were nothing but smiles the entire evening. Our food was amazing as well (the spaghetti was rich and lucious, the lemon Panna cotta absolutely heavenly). I have honestly never been so impressed by service AND food together.

When the total rang up it was $17.50 all in all. To reference, EVERYTHING in there was over a 3rd more expensive than advertised online, something that someone on a quick business lunch won't have time to reconsider. A little insulted at how expensive it was for what looked like Americanized, fast-casual Mediterranean food, I gave the benefit of the doubt and assumed the \\"extra\\" meat and salad would be well worth it. \\n\\nSalad apparently is an open term, there's a condiments bar that has \\"salad\\"-like choices. The \\"extra part is just a bigger plate given to you, but if you buy anything you're allowed to grab as many salad bowls as you want, so this \\"extra\\" salad is really a gimmick. Then came the food, everyone before me had their sandwich prepared by an employee, I was handed empty pitas and a small plate of meat and told \\"there you go\\". When I say small plate of meat, think of the average Gyro you get and the amount of meat in that. THAT is what they consider \\"extra\\" meat there. The fries were just frozen Ore-Ida fries that had been deep friend, nothing special, frankly pretty awful. \\n\\nFor the price I paid I expected a decently sized Mediterranean salad and at least double meat, what I got was an average portioned meal and average Mediterranean fast food. The chicken was good, but not memorable, for $17.50 I could have had a great meal at Roxx (how has AMAZING food) or any other sit-down restaurant with functioning A/C and friendly, competent customer service. This place is a joke and is clearly only afloat because of revolving door, regular clientele, not new business. The guy running the register acted like the owner, and if that's the case, he needs some serious interpersonal skills because he seems to critically judge every patron's every actions with smug disgust. There are SO MANY better options around town for this style of Med, Fresh 4 U, Mediterranean Grill, Cafe Agora, the list goes on, so by all means try there first before succumbing to deceptive pricing, rude and lazy service, disappointing portions to price ratio, and average Mediterranean food. \\n\\nSteer clear!"},{"name":"Zesto","address":"2469 Piedmont Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Basic fast food Eatery...

Wasping away flies during a meal is not fun. We ordered calamari for starters since we like to try this dish at all our new spots. It was horrible- very chewy, the batter fell off the calamari and they were soaked in too much olive oil. We took three bites and that is it. We ordered filet mignon for dinner and asked that it would be medium rare. It came out more like rare with a very cold center.

Actually, every eater beware.\\n\\nI came here around 1am one night with a friend and had my hopes burned alive by Felipe. I ordered their regular grilled chicken burrito and my friend ordered the steak taco. OK....\\n\\n1) I unravel the aluminum and absolute FIRST THING I see is a hair strand on top of the burrito, sitting there, staring at me, going, \\"SURPRISE!!!\\" Great. So I think, no biggie, it's late, we're starving, I just want to eat, I don't want to wait even longer for another after probably explaining genuinely that I did not put that hair there, so I picked it out, because I figure it's just touching the outside. Next.\\n\\n2) I take a bite, and I'm just sad. I get nothing but a mouthful of flour, and no filling-no rice, no chicken, no lettuce, salsa, sour cream, beans, etc...\\n\\n3) Eventually when I did get to the essential part of the burrito, the chicken tasted BAD. (An idea: Imagine going to Stop&Shop's salad bar and looking at their chicken, yeah, the mechanically separated, too chewy, too soft chicken; that was my kinda chicken). Grilled chicken burrito?, bullsh*t. McDonalds has better chicken.\\n\\nI'll be brief about my friend's steak taco. Why are there two taco wraps for each one (four all together)? I don't know, but I could have put my beans from my burrito into his extra taco wraps and made him another taco. All that was in his taco was some meat slivers and beans that looked like runaways because there were so few of em. DISAPPOINTING.\\n\\nI've never wanted to throw away food before, and this was a first for me. Felipe was disappointing, not to mention the people working behind the counter seemed so unmotivated to work and miserable to be working there. But I'll be nice and consider that maybe they had a really long day, it was an hour before closing, and a few stragglers were making their way into the restaurant, ruining their hopes of closing on time and having to do less cleaning. The one sauce I tried, which was a burnt orange color, was wayyyy too greasy. But I did like the diced onion-cilantro mix, that was at least fresh.\\n\\nThe only thing I like about this place is that it was clean, it closes late (2am), it's convenient to get to (Harvard Sq), they're fast, they have Jarritos (go for the orange flavored soda!), and they're connected to \\"the mall\\", so in case you're not satisfied, there are some other places you can escape to that will treat you better for your dollar, with a free smile included that won't make you feel like sh*t when ordering or make you feel stupid when asking a question."},{"name":"Lure","address":"1106 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Exquisite ceviche and if you love fish and sea food as I do you will be in paradise!

I haven't had a better version and I made sure to eat the entire thing over anything else. However, the brisket was tender and juicy, with a thick line of fat. The pork ribs were meaty and something you can sink your teeth into. The house sauce complemented it perfectly. Surprisingly, I was a fan of their potato salad - even though there was a heavy hand with the dill. Mac and cheese was deliciously creamy and the collard greens had that sour, bitter kick. We also got the chocolate cake for dessert but it was just alright. \\n\\nThis may be my favorite BBQ place in Boston (not counting BT's since it's an hour away).

I know they're shared with the place next door, but for real... there's no excuse for a gross bathroom. The doors to the stall were all bent and barely closed. There was toilet paper and paper towels all over the floor. I appeal to all women out there! Why can't you make sure the toilet paper gets into the toilet????

I prefer to sit at the bar but it was full, half with people just watching the game and not eating and later I come to find out that the other half is eating wings for $2.50 because they are T-mobile subscribers. After 15 minutes, a bar stool opened up so I grabbed it, hoping that it would lead to better service yet I've typed this review to this point without one word being spoken to me. I'm hopeful that I can review their drink and food quality but that is beginning to look slim. It is 10:00pm and I'm at a local hotel without a car, most of the other restaurants in this area are closing soon and I don't like to be that guy walking in just before closing. If there was an Applebee's directly outside I would be there in a second and I can assure you I depise Applebee's. On any other day in any other place I would have walked out by now.\\n\\nService finally comes....I order a drink and some wings, basic small hot traditional with bleu cheese and celery, this is likely the most common wing order on the planet. At this point it's more about the principal than the efficiency so after 15 mins I decide to stick it out until 30 mins go by, maybe I'm impatient, maybe they forgot but I hate to be the customer nagging just before their food is up. The 30 min mark hits so I tell them that I still have not received my wings and like magic, piping hot wings come out in less than a minute. For those of you who don't understand how BW3 works, they cook all the wings plain and then toss them in the sauce of your choice so they could put out every order in under 5 minutes if they wanted to. 30 minutes is an eternity at BW3.\\n\\nLastly, this is purely management's fault. Actually saw the manager, he poked his head out of the kitchen once or twice, I don't think he ever made it past the walkway between the kitchen and bar area though. If the GM walked in then he would have fired him on the spot. BW3 is my favorite chain however this was the worst service I've ever experienced at a BW3 and ironically it might be one of the nicest BW3s that I've ever been to. Very upscale and new look, just not managed properly. \\n\\nAs an aside BW3 = Buffalo Wing Wilds & Weck. Everyone always wonders what the 3rd is so there you have it.

They brought beef, Refried beans and Taco was MIA.  No big deal I'll snack on the chips and drink my beer. Most Mexican places get the food out fairly quick and place wasn't real busy.  My husband finished his food and I was still waiting. \\n\\nI got my food finally, this time with a hard taco (not what I ordered) with scary looking black beans. Didn't say anything about the taco no big deal..... BUT Then I took one bite of my burrito and found a bone in it.   At this point I was done. Chips and salsa was my meal. The only good thing is they compt both meals. \\n\\nSome other issues - Their salsa is not very consistent, 1st time it was so hot my husband could barely eat it and he loves hot things.  2nd time salsa was much better food was good (Monday night combo) 3rd time food okay/ salsa again way to hot and this last time..... what a mess.   \\n\\nDon't think we will be going back which upsets me due to the location and combo night deal.

It's nicer than a Chinese takeout restaurant - not a place which has a takeout counter and two tables, but not necessarily a restaurant you would hold a Chinese banquet in.  Canton Cook II, not to be confused with Canton Cooks, is located on the corner of Roswell and Abernathy next to the Savvy Cellars liquor store.  Another familiar landmark in the plaza is the Nori Nori sushi buffet.\\n\\nHighlights: My friends and I ordered 4 dishes - the pepper steak, the chicken chow mein, the Peking pork chop, and the potstickers.  The dishes are more expensive than your standard takeout restaurant - $10-16 on average - but the portions justify the price.  Everyone in my group brought enough food home for a small leftovers lunch.  An order of steamed potstickers has 6 dumplings - the outside was soft and there was a decent amount of filling.  My favorite dish of the four was the Peking pork chop.  Excellent sauce, tasty breading, and plenty of meat.  An order will have both boneless and bone-in pieces.  Most of the meat was tender - there were a few chewy pieces, but most of it was good.  The chicken chow mein was decent.\\n\\nCritiques: It took a while for the servers to come back to take our order after giving us menus.  Service was smooth, though, after that.  My friend custom ordered the pepper steak without onions.  This understandably changes the flavor profile of the dish, but I thought that there was something missing besides onions.  \\n\\nOverall: Canton Cook II is definitely an Americanized Chinese restaurant - the plate settings come with forks by default and you'll get fortune cookies along with sliced oranges.  I'd say other Chinese restaurants in Atlanta will have more \\"authentic\\" cuisine, but I would come back here again for some takeout.  Especially for the pork chops - so good."},{"name":"Savona Coffee House","address":"1898 SE Columbia River Dr","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Great coffee!

I understand they are a small business, but the service is just poor beyond measure.  Yes, I have talked to the owner, Shadrach, but the message is not getting through.\\n\\nTo begin with, their hours are very convenient for them, but not so much for me.  I honestly can't name anywhere else with such short hours.  They are the very stereotype of \\"Banker's Hours.\\"  My last experience there was the worst, and the one which has made me decide to give up on this place.  The restaurant was very dirty.  My girlfriend cleaned our table.  I don't mean wiped off crumbs.  She bussed the dishes, got a dish rag from Shadrach, and wiped the table with the horrible, stinking rag he gave her.  We then filled our own water glasses.  A bit later, food is brought out to us which is not ours.  We carried it back up to Shadrach, and explained this was not ours.  He looked at his orders, and asked us to take it to another table.  No thanks was given, he basically treated us as though we were his employees.  Not rude, but there was no sense of embarrassment or shame.  I should add that he was the only person there on a Saturday morning.  Peak hours, and he's the only one there?  What?\\n\\nEventually our food came out, and yes, the food is good, but after seeing the filth of the restaurant, and not being treated well, we rather begrudgingly ate it, and were very eager to leave.\\n\\nI really wished the best for Full English.  They need to hire some people that know how to work, and show up for work on time.  Clean the place up, and use some soap.  Treat your customers like you are glad they are there, and give them a delightful service to justify a high cost.  As it is now, it is filthy, understaffed, and disorganized.  The various people I have seen working there appear to be a friend of the owner's that have no professional waiting experience, as they have no idea what is even on the menu.\\n\\nThe best thing I have experienced there is a fill-in cook named Cecily.

I was celebrating my graduation from college and came in with 4 other people so it wasn't a huge party. We sat, the waitress came over and took our drink order and we ordered an appetizer. Didn't come back for 30 minutes. When the drinks finally came it was THEN she told us that they did not have the appetizer we ordered. So we ordered another one. 30 minutes passes by.....no appetizer and we haven't even ordered dinner yet. Then a manager named Brady came over and asked if we got salad or soups. We informed him that we haven't even ordered yet and have been there for an hour. He then tells us that the waitress we have has only been working by herself for 30 minutes. He then offered to bring us his favorite appetizer and he did but it was 2 meatballs for 4 people. Then we FINALLY get to order dinner and at this point we were ready to leave, but we gave them a benefit of the doubt. After ordering, about 15 minutes later she comes over and says....\\"I need to verify your order, I can't read my handwriting\\". I busted out laughing at this point because I think I'm getting punked. Me and my boyfriend ordered the EXACT same thing and when I told her this she says \\"Ooohhhhh that's why I wrote 2 next to it\\". So I suppose she puts in our order and Brady immediately comes back to tell us that there were no mashed potatoes and that it would take 20 minutes to \\"cook from scratch\\". My sister explained to Brady everything that had happened up to this point and his response was to agree with everything and say that there are some things broken in the kitchen......wait......what???!! We said that's fine because we have been waiting for so long anyway and were so hungry. So jokingly I say to my sister....\\"Wouldn't it be funny if our order came it wrong\\"...........and by God did it!!! That was it. I have been a server at multiple restaurants and I myself NEVER send food back, but this time it was so wrong that I couldn't stand it. Finally at the end of this ordeal the \\"proprietor\\" of the business as he called himself came to the table and noone communicated with him the issues.

Following the yelps of others we started with a 1/2 pitcher of Sangria. Very tasty but I remember the entire meal -- so I am guessing it's light on the al-ca-ma-hol. Hubby started w/ the grilled brie app. while I devoured my gazpcho w/ fresh Maine crab. So good! The soup had a nice heat and the crab was the sweetest that I have had in a long time. We also loved the white bean/ red pepper/ garlic dip that came with the crusty bread. So much so we actually had them bag up the leftovers.  DH's main course was the Prime Rib with mashed potatoes and roasted veggies. Although he got a platter sized hunk of beautiuflly marbled meat -- it was well and not medium rare as ordered. Being as it was *my* day -- he didn't tell me until we were having coffee in Wellesley. I do wish that they had given him more than two slices of carrot and 3 sticks of asparagus for a veggie though to counter the beouf.  The potatoes were excellent and I believe mashed with horseradish that day. I chose linguine with a melange of seafood done in a saffron oil. Beautiful and plentiful seafood and the pasta was delicious. The sauce was a lil oily for me -- tasty but heavy. I have a delicate pouch so I know when something I eat is going to just be visiting or staying the night. Dessert was a tough decision but I chose the flourless chocolate torte. DH chose something w/ a fabulous cookie crust -- I traded after first bites.

Great Soups. Great selection of cheeses and baguettes from Easy Tiger. Certain dishes are excellent.\\n\\nHere are my issues:\\n\\n- The staff doesn't seem very well organized. There were about 6 people in front of me in line today and nobody was taking orders. We all just waited for 10 minutes before the staff members behind the cheese counter stopped talking and decided to commence operating as a restaurant. \\n\\n- Prices. Yes quality food costs money and I don't think they are WAY off the mark. I think the average sandwich costing $11.00-$12.00 with no side is pushing it however. Would be nice to see things closer to $9.00-10.00\\n\\n- The drink situation; we live in Texas. It's hot, people are thirsty. However if the initial ice they give you runs out, well too bad. You have to go hunt down a free staff member and beg for more ice. The warm ice tea also comes from a dispenser that you have to turn both on and OFF. This is a little annoyance but I am always worried I won't get it all the way off in time and ice tea will shoot everywhere. Also there are no lemons, you have to ask a staff member for those as well.\\n\\n- The parking lot in the back looks like Cthulhu made a visit. For your tire's sake park somewhere else.\\n\\n- The beignets are kind of meh, which is a shame because not many places serve them in Austin.\\n\\nI'm sorry if this comes across as overly critical and I like certain things about it, but I feel like the experience could use some polishing.

But Pret actually continually preps their options throughout the day, so what you're eating has likely been made just hours before with fresh, real, and often local ingredients (which is more than you can say about a lot of other sandwich/salad/soup shops). Also, the pre-prepped design means you don't have to spend your entire lunch break waiting in line to have your order made; you can just grab and go, which during a busy day can make all the difference.\\n\\nOn a recent visit, the Moroccan Lentil soup I got was completely loaded with lentils: this isn't you're typical broth with a few lentils scattered in, it was a really hearty and tasty meal, and satisfied my hunger for $5. Prices are pretty much in line with other similar shops, although Pret's options are on the smaller side (Euro-sized, not American-sized) so plan accordingly.\\n\\nPret certainly won't knock your socks off, but for a quick, healthyish, freshish lunch, I think it's a solid pick. I do wish they offered some of the cool UK flavors though (I could slather sweet chili sauce on anything, and love the combo of cheddar and spring onion)."},{"name":"Shabu & Mein","address":"148 1st St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Charging an additional $1 to get extra spice in the Tomkatsu ramen ... how can they justify that?\\nOtherwise the ramen was just good."},{"name":"Josie's Pizza & Wings","address":"1225 S Hiawassee Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We came because this place is within walking distance for us.

We got two flavors which was 50cent charge but that's ok. We got butter garlic Parmesan for my boyfriend and I wanted a spicier flavor. My boyfriend doesn't even like wings and he really liked theirs. I told her I wanted not the hottest but a decently hot flavor. She told me if it wasn't hot enough they'd bring me out a hotter side sauce. Both were good! The only reason I'd knock off more like half a star is even the new side she brought out wasn't that spicy. I had asked for the hottest one they have which is called Suicide but I guess they were out so they brought the next hottest down. So next time I'm definitely trying suicide! \\n\\nWe also got a pepperoni pizza which came out fast and was really good!

I had the short ribs and there just wasn't much flavor in them. I also had the pear cake and it was less than impressive in taste and appearance for what it cost. The servers need to know where to take the food, the person who brought ours wasn't sure she had the right table and didn't bring a pasta spoon for the pasta dish. I am also concerned with how loud it will be in there when it is full, since it was built as a movie theater to convey sound; don't expect it to be quiet.

That being said, this is the worst example of the chain ever. I frequent Orlando multiple times a year, and when I am there I always go to SnS. Unfortunately this particular location is usually closest to where I stay. I went once last April when they just had their grand reopening after a remodel. It was ok, but service was bad. I attributed this to being the first day open. \\n\\nJump forward 6 months and I find myself in the area so I venture forward. The restaurant wasn't very busy, but it was active. I was promptly seated by a guy that looked like Timmy from \\"Rules of Engagement.\\" Since I was by myself he asked if I wanted to be in the back away from the crowds which was perfect for me. I sat down and he asked for my drink order, but I gave him my full order as I knew what I wanted. He took my order, and went off on his merry way. I waited a bit and my drink finally arrived. Usually my drink comes back within a minute or two, this was more like 5 minutes. My food took much longer to come out as well. When it did finally come out my burger was pretty much burnt to a crisp and extremely dry. The fries thankfully were perfect. I went to salt my fries, but no salt on the table. Waiter asked me if I needed anything - I asked for silverware (there was none when I was seated) and extra napkins. I got the silverware, but no extra napkins. I ate half the burger and called it quits. I quietly waited for my waiter so I could get a shake to go. The waiter never came back and after about 10 minutes of waiting I flagged down another waitress and asked her if my waiter was coming back. She apologized and asked what I needed. I said I wanted a to go shake and my check. She said no problem and asked someone to make a shake. Another 10 minutes passed and nothing. My waiter finally came back and asked if I needed anything else. I said my check and a to go shake. I told him I asked the other woman for a shake, and he looked but had to have a fresh one made. Another 10 minutes passes and I finally got my shake and check. The shake was maybe 3/4s full. Pretty disappointing, but it was still a great shake. \\n\\nWent to the counter to pay and had to wait for the manager to ring me out. He was doing 10 things at once, and none of them well it seemed. I dont think I will ever visit this location again. I understand they get the crowds of tourists, but thats no excuses. Hire ENOUGH competent staff, and utilize proper forecasting and service shouldn't be an issue. I am sure they aren't hurting for business.\\n\\nUpdate - I notified SnS customer service regarding the issues I faced. They were kind enough to promptly send me a letter and a $10 gift card (which essentially covered my meal). I hope they do relay the comments I made, and I hope they work at making this location better because for many folks this is probably their only taste of SnS they get."},{"name":"Off the Tracks Espresso Bar and Bistro","address":"1363 Railspur Alley","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Good place to pickup coffee and a quick avocado toast!

Though \\" farm-to-table \\" was touted by our server, I failed to experience any flavor uniqueness or freshness. Instead the dishes seemed overly homogenized resulting in a loss of food integrity.  A carrot should not only scream \\" carrot\\" but should also be identified in the dish.  The kitchen's job is to find a way of enhancing this said carrot by using it in interesting ways.

When I asked to substitute miso broth in one of the ramens that came with chashu, the hostess said no.\\n\\nAlso, half of the ramen options come with chicken broth instead of pork bone. This really turned me off because they're charging $13-$14 for ramen that doesn't have that delicious, simmered for hours pork bone broth. I have a friend who's allergic to pork, so I get having chicken broth options, but the considerably less labor intensive chicken broth doesn't justify such an expensive price.\\n\\nI ended up getting the tonkatsu shio since it at least had pork bone broth and chashu. The broth was flavorful, but way too fatty. Some people like the extra fat poured on, but it's not for me. The noodles were good, although I prefer curly noodles. There's only one piece of chashu, and although it comes in a cool bowl shape, there's just something off about the flavor.\\n\\nOverall, it wasn't worth $13, but I guess you pay for the location.

The oysters were small and didn't fill up the sandwich.   I would have been much happier with smaller bread so I got oysters in every bite.   The oysters themselves were poorly cooked.   The breading was not crisp, simply soggy.  The flavor was off also.  The oysters were clearly frozen before cooking.   The gumbo was average at best.  It had all the regular components in it, but tasted very under seasoned.  It improved much with the addition of some hot sauce.   It was called seafood gumbo and there was about 7 or 8 shrimp in it and a tiny crab leg cluster.  Unfortunately the shrimp were overcooked somewhat and rubbery.

Despite the rain it was still pretty busy in the restaurant.  Their staff for the night was 2 waitresses on the floor, 2 Sushi Chefs behind the counter and 2 people in the kitchen. (I think one was a bus boy and the other was in charge for the hot food) I personally thought that they were way understaffed because the restaurant was full and some people were sitting at the table waiting for the waiter to come take their order. (but it is Wednesday) They did bring water right as you sat down so I assume so guests thought it was tolerable to wait a few minutes.   I think one of the waitress is the owner's wife and the sushi chef behind the counter is the Owner.  Both were Japanese.\\n\\nI sat behind the counter and just had their Sushi.  The Specials seem similar to any other Japanese Restaurant in the area.  A couple of Specialty Sushi (ie Spanish Mackeral, Fatty Tuna, etc) and Rolls (ie Mexican Roll, Mackeral Box Sushi, etc) and some small side dishes.  Their Sushi is decent.  Nothing to really rave about but it does it's job.  I think the only fish served frozen was the regular tuna and shrimp that day. The rice is always a little bit on the softer side than I would normally like it.\\n\\nOne thing that really bothered me was the Sushi Chef/Owner.  He wasn't yelling but he was being verbally abusive to the staff in Japanese.  \\"Get this\\", \\"Go there\\", \\"We're out of this so deal with it\\", \\"Do this now\\", etc.  It may be because he's acting like an old school sushi chef in Japan where it's part of their training to be strict or an \\"A@# Hole\\" to their staff but I really didn't appreciate hearing that kind of tone while I was eating.  Since he was speaking in Japanese most of the patrons probably didn't hear or care about what he says.  But for someone who understands the language his wording was really harsh.  Good thing for the wait staff and assistant sushi chef for keeping a positive attitude.  Yes.  This also happened on my past 2 visits here as well.\\n\\nAlso, it was about 7PM and they ran out of Sushi Rice.  The Assistant Sushi Chef had to go make more in the back.  I assume because it was a Wednesday night and they weren't expecting it to be a busy night they ran out.  As the assistant waiter went to the back he was trying his best to keep up with the Sushi Chef's demands and the customers orders.  \\n\\nAll in all the food is good, the wait staff trys their best to serve the customers on a timely manner, but I think they still have ways to go before being an absolute must stop for me.  I prefer Aki's since it's a little more simple there and the staff seems to be more attentive."},{"name":"Nar Mediterranean Grill","address":"3402 Technological Ave, Ste 112","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Love this place!

All breakfast platters come with authentic Mexican / Spanish rice, Mexican grated / crumbled cheese-topped refried beans, and great, piping hot tortillas. As others have stated in their reviews, the batter-fried, cheese-filled chile relleno taco is not to be missed either.\\n\\nI would say that everything on the menu is fantastic; however, my only caveat to making such a claim is that my friend once ordered a torta (mexican style meat sandwich sort of like a sub) at the Windy Hill location and described it as disappointing.

The broth was not rich enough and lacked the depth of flavor you'd expect from all the well liked ny ramen joints. The noodles were ok but I tend not to like the thin straight cut types since they don't stay al dente for long. The meat that came with the ramen and the pork belly that was extra were not particularly noteworthy. I had a bite and didn't care for another. What was really nice was they brought the ramen out in two separate bowls since we were sharing, without us even asking.

When they recently moved into a larger space down the street from their original spot, I was not too excited.  But I thought I would give it a try.  I never go to a new restaurant the first two weeks after it opens so that the staff can figure out their groove.  It's been 3 weeks since they opened their doors, and this place has still not, and may never, find their groove. \\n\\nI went for lunch with a friend on a weekday afternoon.  We had read the online reviews since the new location had opened and they were not stellar.  But we decided to try it for ourselves. \\n The place was a little less than half filled and we had the option of where we wanted to sit.  We selected the lounge.  In hind-site it might have been more interesting to sit in the larger room, but no big deal.  \\n\\nA few minutes after we were seated a gentleman came over and asked if a waitress had come over to us yet.  She hadn't, but it wasn't an inordinate amount of time.  Not yet anyway. \\n \\nThe waitress brought over a basket of bread.  It looked and smelled fresh enough, but it was not appealing enough for either of us to dig in.  If you like Piantadosi bread I guess you would enjoy it.  Our waitress (don't remember her name) was ready to take our order.  My friend ordered a garden salad and an eggplant parm sandwich.    I asked our waitress how large the gnocchi appetizer was and she assured me that it was an appetizer portion and I would probably want to order something additional with it.  So I ordered a tomato salad as well. \\n\\nMy friend's salad arrived in a relatively prompt manner.  It looked slightly overdressed and had a large clump of onions on top. Luckily my friend loves lots of onions.  The onions looked like they had marinated in the house dressing for a very long time.  After a couple of minutes I told my friend to go ahead and start eating her salad although she wanted to wait until mine arrived,  After all, it was just a salad, it's not like it was going to get cold.  \\n\\nAbout 4 or five minutes later our waitress stopped by our table and asked how everything was.  When I pointed out that I had not gotten my salad she apologized and said she thought I wanted my salad served with my gnocchi. What???   Okay - she was sweet but not too bright.  \\n\\nMy tomato salad arrived within a couple of minutes and yikes!  It was a bowl of quartered plum tomatoes and onions swimming in salad dressing.  I mean, the tomatoes were literally swimming in dressing.  I was tempted to pour the dressing off and believe me it would have been half a glass of dressing.  I tried one tomato quarter and it was BLAND!  Okay - maybe it's my fault.  I should have known better than to order a plum tomato salad in mid-April.  Tomatoes are not in season and this bowl of drowning, unripened and totally bland tomatoes were proof.  \\n\\nMy friend and I just laughed about it. We both ate about half our salads and passed the time chatting.  We started to wonder where our main courses had disappeared to.  How long does it take to make an eggplant arm sandwich and a bowl of gnocchi.  By the way, the restaurant boasts that their gnocchi is made in-house.  What were they doing?  Hand rolling the gnocchi to order?  I think not.  \\n\\nIt was now more than 30 minutes since we placed our order and our food finally arrived.  The \\"appetizer\\" portion of gnocchi was huge!  It was enough to easily feed two people - maybe three.  The eggplant parm was steaming hot and looked mushy,  It was served in a very ordinary sub roll.  Again, thank you Piantadosi bread.  \\n\\nThe gnocchi was ok.  Not the worst I ever had.  The menu described it as  saut√©ed with onions, garlic, bell pepper bits, tossed in brown butter & Romano cheese.  I could see the onions and bell pepper bits, but where was the delicious sheen of brown butter?  I took a bite and realized that it was very bland.  My friend told me that her eggplant parm was okay - but nothing spectacular.  \\n\\nOur waitress checked in on us and we were fine.  Neither of us could finish our lunch.  The waitress admitted that my appetizer was a big portion and she claimed that all the appetizers were generously sized.  But wait!   When I went to order didn't she tell me that the portion size would not be enough to fill me and I should order something else?  Come on!  \\n\\nOne nice touch - or sort of nice touch - was when the manager came over and asked how we enjoyed ourselves.  I always like it when the manager visits the tables and inquires about our meals. Here's the problem, the manager had a creepy vibe about him.  My friend thought that he was stoned.  I'm not so sure.  But he was a little off-putting.\\n \\nSo, would I ever go back?  I'm not sure I see a point to it.  It was not the worst food I had ever eaten, and I would even say that it was even better than when I had gone to their old location, but there are many better choices in the general area to dine."},{"name":"Stephanie's On Newbury","address":"190 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Fantastic!

They were quite attentive, which was nice. \\n\\nOnce seated at our table, I ordered the brisket and pulled pork, with a rib \\"onesie\\" (must try all the bbq staples!) The brisket was ridiculously tender. My one criticism would be that there was definitely not enough of it for the price. The pulled pork was tender and what you would expect. The rib was amazing. By far the best rib I have had in Boston yet. It really fell off the bone. Next time I go back, I will be ordering more of those. The sauce they offered was a very good blend sweet and mesquite, like a good KC style one, in my opinion. As a sides, the mac and cheese and broccoli casserole were very tasty. The bbq beans weren't my favorites; I prefer them on the sweeter side, but they were decent. The bucket of biscuits that our neighbors had looked delicious and I want to try them next visit also.\\n\\nAlso, as a side note, you can see Tiffany Faison cooking in the open kitchen (at least on a weekend night), which, as a Top Chef fan, is kinda fun."},{"name":"Sweet Cheeks Q","address":"1381 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Went with a group of four here for dinner & drinks after several recommendations.

Even though Sophie and Meow don't necessarily get along, I found everyone there to be most accomidating.\\n\\nI had the Black and Blue burger because I'm a sucker for bleu cheese (gorganzola as it's listed).  The dish was plated artfully like someone in the kitchen actually cared what they were doing!  The cracked pepper sauce was slightly sweet, dark and rich and the bread was soft and flavorful, the greens were mixed and the combination was very palatable.  Much better than I expected.  I ordered the caesar side salad and it was fresh and crunchy, not the freshest grated parmesan but the light sprinkling of pepper helped it come alive.\\n\\nSophie was offered a bowl of water by the busgirl and I'm quite the sucker for someone who makes a fuss over my dog.

I didn't like the shrimp too much.\\n\\nGyu Tataki - 3/5 - Don't really like raw beef, and the fact I knew it was raw made me not want to give it that many points. The flavor profile was good because of the saltiness with the acid. Nice lime fresh flavors.\\n\\nI came right when it opened and got a table. I heard it can be really packed.

They were so sweet we could hardly finish them). Unfortunately, it was just really wretched. The teas were fairly average. \\n\\nInterestingly, though, it's hard to really hate SalonTea, because the service quite good. We were waited on by two younger girls who were pleasant, professional, accommodating and attentive. Bad food and bad service seem to go hand and hand, and truly bad eateries can learn a lesson from SalonTea - if you're peddling such awful food, best to have it served by great waitresses who really seem to care about doing a good job. \\n\\nIt's still $35 dollars I can't get back (and that's with a coupon - full price would've been dangerously close to the fantastic Urban Tea Merchant, and the difference in quality between UTM and SalonTea is massive), but it could've been worse.

The white bass & prawn veracruz was good, and the chicken thigh enchiladas was excellent. The sauce was similar to a good mole...but with a lighter cream. The portions were large and filling, while our server was friendly (if a bit absent-minded).

Large window, white walls, lots of wood, feels both rustic and modern. Servers are youthful and fun. \\n\\nThe food here was on the money. We had ordered a half dozen roasted oysters with anchovy lemon butter, which were fresh and really good. Pork belly wraps with North Carolina slaw, cane syrup, and dijon mustard were fun to eat (you had to wrap them yourselves with leaves) and that pork belly was TENDER. \\n\\nGeneral rule for me: If duck is on a menu and I am reading that menu, I will order the duck. Duck was on this menu. A whole roasted duck breast for two with grilled radicchio, medjool date chutney, caper berries, and vin cotto. The portion was definitely huge. I chuckled when I first saw it. The duck was cooked to perfection. Seasoned well, cooked medium, juicy, and bursting with flavor. The grilled radicchio was good, but didn't work for me as a side pairing for this dish. I don't know if it was the right contrast. But the chutney and berries were. \\n\\nMy dessert featured Cynthia's amazing lemon cookies with blueberry whipped cream. I always furrow an eyebrow when a dish has a term like \\"amazing\\" in its name. But this dish is appropriately named. These are incredibly simple. Light, sweet, and a good way to counteract the duck sweats. \\n\\nWatershed on Peachtree seems to one-up its old location in many ways. Maybe Chef Truex needed the new location to complete Watershed's transformation. Watershed is as good as I can remember, perhaps better. That being said, there's one thing I still need to do, one true and final test ...

Also, we LOVE the sauted garlic broccoli, which is on the appetizer part of the menu but is also a great side dish. It is so delicious, with a slight kick of spice.  Order 2 of them, because even though the portions are large, you'll want more! \\n\\nI like that this place is BYOB.

Perhaps it is because it is at Bridgeport Village which I tend to avoid like the plague due to it being famous for raping the average human with its inflated pricing for everything.  The service was horribly slow and generic - as in our waiter seemed to behave like a robot - and not in a good way.  There were very few people in the restaurant since we went around 2pm so at a slower time.

They really do not offer many different types of rolls but the ones they do have are most excellent....I think the volcano was my personal favorite...  The restaurant itself is rather lovely though the bathroom use was an experience...you feel a touch, well, exposed.  First of all - WHY oh WHY is there a new trend to mirroring half the bathroom.  I can appreciate checking yourself in a full length to ensure you don't walk out of the bathroom covered in something but do I need to watch myself pee?  I mean really??  And the door seemed almost see through with gaps around its glass - so I am stuck trying to decide if I want to stare at myself pee or watch to see if someone might come along and watch me pee from outside...and then I need to exit the giant pee staging area to the restaurant portion to wash my hands??

My fianc√© and I booked the chef's counter to celebrate our anniversary, where we enjoyed front row seats to a truly symphonic production of seamless culinary execution. The artistry that unfolded before our eyes, course by course, demonstrated a meticulously passionate approach by each and every hand in the kitchen. \\n\\nWe popped a bottle of bubbly Bouvet Brut Rose and awoke our taste buds with offerings from the dim sum cart: canary melon with lime, chili powder and Serrano peppers, and cold shrimp in a pool of jalape√±o-kicked watermelon Agua Fresca with chili and basil. Our order of grilled squash and zucchini salad with onion petals and a silky garlic pur√©e followed suit, alongside a summary interpretation of tomato bruschetta. A springy bowl of tomato water-soaked durum with basil, grape tomatoes and a dollop of house-whipped sour cream segued our taste buds to enjoy another dim sum delicacy, simple oil-brushed butternut squash baked beneath a luxuriously melty blanket of Gruyere. \\n\\nA juicy bone-in pork chop the size of a baseball mitt landed next, complemented by a slab of thinly sliced, herbalicious pan-seared potatoes and a garlic sauce garnished with delicate yellow flower petals. \\n\\nThen, a bowl full of soul, the piece de resistance, the only reason to get out of bed in the morning: Emmer & Rye's signature Cacio e Pepe. Its hand-slung simplicity and melt-in-your-mouth comfort factor assures that everything will be alright. There is still good in this chaotic, angry bitch of a world. There is still love.\\n\\nAlong the way, we had selected a bottle of Donkey & Goat Stone Crusher 2014 Roussanne to conduct the flavor train, and it may have become our new favorite wine of all time. If there were a venn diagram of sour farmhouse ale and wine, this bad boy would land somewhere in the middle. It blurs the line and bends the rules, in the most pleasant possible way.\\n\\nWe took note of the roti station across the kitchen, where flexy discs of flatbread dough were being stretched and fluffed with care before meeting the griddle with a sizzle. There was no avoiding an order of roti to sop up our two desserts: Toasted grain ice cream with brioche pudding, candied pecan, cookie crumble and orange marmalade, and lemongrass panna cotta with honeycomb, pecan granola and an appropriate bookend of canary melon.\\n\\nWhile every moment of our meal was deftly orchestrated, every bite more exciting than the last, the absolute finest was the moment Anna, our waitress, discreetly slid an envelope across the counter, advising we read it at our convenience. Enclosed were more than a dozen hand-written notes from the staff, congratulating us on our anniversary. This act of kindness showed real character and inevitably sealed the deal for us. We plan to be unabashedly devoted frequent flyers in Emmer & Rye's friendly skies.\\n\\nEmmer & Rye specializes in showcasing the integrity and authenticity of their locally sourced ingredients. They mill their own grains for pastas. They grind their own powders for spices. They confound the palate with flavors that are somehow familiar, yet foreign. Kevin Fink [chef/owner] allowed us a generous amount of conversation (despite the busy evening), as he described his soulful mission of utilizing every possible local resource to help Austin feed itself. Emmer & Rye is not only focused on the farm-to-table quality of the plate, but how the plate impacts the community.\\n\\nReview written by Lauren Mann, my fianc√©\\n\\nArticle by Bon Appetit Magazine: http://austin.eater.com/2016/8/2/12351402/emmer-rye-bon-appetit-best-new-restaurants"},{"name":"Lombard's Seafood Grille","address":"6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"If I could give 1/2 star, I would for poor value for $$$$$.

The dining area is actually much smaller than it appears with a corner space on the Disney Boardwalk.\\n\\nStarters- a 5-6 spread and pita starter was ok, but not out of the ordinary.  The fried calamari that was raved about by others was also pretty ordinary.  The spoon cheese dip on bread was a very small portion, and the cheese was not melted enough.  The bread was stone cold and tasteless, the namesake dipping olive oils were also quite ordinary.\\n\\nI ordered the trio entree: Greek lasagna which was more like baked ziti with a thick layer of Greek cheese topping pasta and ground meat, stewed chicken and tomato with orzo that was tender but the pasta was a bit overcooked, and the lamb slider that was very overcooked despite my insistence upon ordering that I wanted the lamb very rare.

They seemed positive and definitely put maximum effort into their craft.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is great as well. Nestled away in a historic section of Grandview, you are in a spot where modern meets the early 20th century. The space is cozy without being suffocating, the decor is...well...appropriate. The free Wi-Fi is strong. And your fellow patrons are usually pretty friendly, relaxed, fairly intelligent individuals.\\n\\nThere are only a couple of downsides to Stauf's. First, going back to Starbucks is a pretty big let-down now. Second, I'm now on a quest to find more places like this...more like, nearly obsessed with finding what are, to me, hidden gems. And Stauf's is definitely a gem tucked away in Grandview.\\n\\nI would say this is a great spot for any kind of date (short of engagement) or just an evening out with a friend or two.

I quickly alerted my wonderful friend (Sara E.) that we'd be heading there immediately after the Yelp event at the theater.\\n\\nNursing quite the hangover from the night before, it only seemed reasonable that I should start drinking again the next day by 11 AM...pure logic right? After downing a few Narragansetts -- courtesy of Yelp (yay!) -- we headed over to CBC ready to get our food and drink on. I was definitely lured in by the menu touting the use of local ingredients. I try to be an avid supporter of local businesses, and what's a better way than to eat some locally grown food and drink some locally brewed beer?!\\n\\nThe place was fairly empty by the time we got there and we picked two seats right in front of the taps. Travis, the bartender, was really great. He was happy to answer all of our annoying questions, was attentive and not at all overbearing, and was ingeniously manning the radio with some old Weezer and Dashboard Confessional. After sampling just about all the beers (some of the little glasses the samples were served in were ADORABLE), I went with a 9 oz pour of the Regatta Golden. This beer was delicious and tasted great along with my BBQ burger. This burger was bomb. Cooked perfectly, topped with bacon and cheddar cheese and served with some crispy artery-clogging fries. I finished just about every bite.\\n\\nFor \\"dessert\\" I ordered the Project Venus Seasonal. I'm a sucker for supporting female ventures, so as soon as I heard this was the product of possibly the first all female brewer collaboration, I knew I was getting myself a glass. This beer was wonderfully sweet and with a pretty high ABV, I was feeling pretttty tipsy. I also made sure to try the experimental sake/beer hybrid before we left. It was really unique and tasted great but I can't imagine having more than a few sips of it!\\n\\nOverall it was a really great lunch and I'm so happy I got to try this place out.

However, both of those have gone down in quality in the past year. I have been visiting this place with my family for at least 6 years, if not more. We always chose Edamame for special occasions and get togethers. I just recently moved back to Columbus and was so excited to eat their buckeye roll again. I have gone every Tuesday for the past 3 weeks now and I am slowly disliking this place more and more with each visit. The first visit, I ordered miso soup and a buckeye roll. I received my roll, which was falling apart , and never received the soup. I asked the girl who rang us up about it and she said \\"Oh we had to make more.\\" No worries, totally understandable but I believe in the spirit of good customer service, she probably should have let us know. I finally got my soup and dismissed the mistake. The second time I go, the following week, the same exact thing happens. Spoke with a different cashier girl and she acts as though she forgot and gets our soup. Okay?? No apology, nothing. I kept my opinion to myself. I returned today in hopes that it may be better. I asked for my soup right after paying and before sitting down to ensure that I could eat it before the end of my meal. I also ordered Edamame and a few other things. Most things came out, although my buckeye roll was falling get apart again, I didn't care. It's still a good sushi roll. After 25 minutes, I asked the same girl who forgot my soup last time, if my Edamame was coming out. She acts as though she forgot again and said she would bring it out. I was on my lunch break and at that point had to go back to work so I just asked for a refund. I then asked to speak to a manager about this reoccurring problem. When he came out and I explained my frustration, he acted as though he did not care and went to the register to get my money. I explained to him that it has happened repeatedly, every Tuesday for 3 weeks and he seemed as though he did not care at all, still. I asked if they had gotten new management because it had never been that bad years ago and he tells me he is the owner and started up the place! I was floored. First of all, I have never, not even once, seen him there. Also, I couldn't believe he was being so laxidasical and careless that a long time customer was having their food forgotten so many times. I love going to Edamame but I don't advise anyone to go unless they want to have 3/4 of their meal. Especially on their lunch break when there's a time limit. Maybe they need new staff or even a new owner but something has to change there. I don't believe expecting all of the things you have ordered is an unreasonable request. I also don't understand how two of the simplest items on the menu were forgotten multiple times. But again, they did not care that I wasn't satisfied so maybe that is just the attitude they choose to convey towards customers. Either way, they made me feel as though they could care less about my experience."},{"name":"Hale Pele","address":"2733 NE Broadway","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"My fianc√© and I went into this place completely blind.

For example Bobby Flay's Americain and Mario Batali's Babbo. But Cat Cora finally manages to convert her celebrity into something worthy.\\n\\nRight out of the gate you can tell you are in for a treat with the stuffed grape leaves and grilled shrimp to the creamy hummus and fresh pita. Even the Greek olive oil, with it's peppery finish. All of the above are all great. But the true stars came next...\\n\\nAll three entrees were phenomenal. The shortribs with a glass of Russian River Pinot Noir. The Branzino with the chili oil- such a great blend of Mediterranean and Thai influences. And the pork- which I didn't actually try, but my mother wolfed it down amidst a symphony of \\"oohs\\" and \\"mmms.\\"\\n\\nBut could Cat stick the landing? Would dessert live up to its predecessors? Indeed. The chocolate \\"lava\\" cake was incredible. Skip the raspberry ice cream is comes with though. It cheapens the dish, which is plenty good all by itself. The other dessert, the baklava, was also good, but very non-traditional. Done more like a spring roll (again, mixing Asian influences). This one, however, is just okay by itself, so I do recommend having it with the cinnamon ice cream to get it over the hump of just \\"eh.\\"\\n\\nSo, after such a glowing review I'm sure you are wondering why only 4 stars and not 5- and that is because the rest of the experience was lack luster.

Not much really, so I will sum it up with a few things that I felt would be good to know prior to coming here:\\n\\n-No reservations on weekends which is fine. We met at 7pm to encounter a 2 hour wait. They will call you when its ready, so you can venture down the street for a few beers. 2 hours is fine with me when beer is available and you aren't stuck drinking at the restaurant you are waiting for a seat at. \\n\\n-Cool vibe. Laid back and casual. It was a little loud on a Friday night, but where isn't?\\n\\n-Hush puppies were a little salty for my taste. Plus I am more partial to Carolina style puppies that are lighter and smaller. There were a little dense and bulbous. If they weren't so salty, they would have been better. Fried Green Tomatoes were good, and the dipping sauce was as well.\\n\\n-Brisket was moist which can be tough sometimes, and the ribs were right where they need to be. Good pullback and great flavor. \\n\\n-Sauce was not needed on any of the meats which is a good sign for bbq. Sauce should be an addition if desired, not a necessity to moisten the meats. \\n\\nAll in all, I would be back here for sure. Their bbq is as good as it gets in this city, without the attitude you get at Blue Ribbon (which seems to be the measuring stick in this city...not sure of why though).

Watershed was highly recommended by all visitor publications from the Dinning and Where magazine etc. and earn at least a 4 stars in Yelp.  I finally decided this is the nite to go after planning for the past 3 weeks.  Skeptical if I am going to get the fry chicken but I don't really care...  Upon arrival, I started to shoot a few photograph (no flash) around the entrance, the bar, the match box container, probably after 3, 4 pictures then suddenly a hostress came from behind and said I must leave.  She said this establishment does not allow picture taken.  At this point I should have left but I really wanted to try their food, so I put up with her b-word attitude and ask her to seat me so I can stay and eat.    I asked my waitress if there was such policy and she said she will ask the manager, she came back and apologize.  I said no, nothing  to do with her.  She said there was no such policy and I am free to take pictures as wish.   Anyhow, that was just a fuck up experience from the get go into a dinner of a pretty high-end establishment.   Order my Pinot Noir $11/glass (quite more affordable than Bones from last nite  ) and I decided to go for the bake oyster and jambalaya instead of the fry chicken.   They do have the fry chicken tonite and it's $14 for a  1/2 chicken.  Based upon my Southern kitchen experience, I figure I am going to pass the fry chicken and instead went for the jambalaya.  The bake oyster was pretty fantastic, it's not rocketfella, it's anchovy butter but it has only a hint of anchovy and saltyness, no fishy, quite tasty.  4.5 out of 5 pts.  The Jambalaya was nothing like the tradition, it has a modern twist.   There were no rice, it has some crayfish etoufe in the bottom layer with shrimps, fry oysters, hussy puppies and sausage.  The scallop was a bit salty then the rest, probably seasoned and grilled separately before merge back to the bowl and it has quite a bit of grit in it.   Sand in scallop is not uncommon, it's hard to get rid of when it's inside but still on a higher end establishment, they usually able to do a better job cleaning it out.  I gave it a 4 out of 5 pts again, quite tasty but not anywhere close to New Orleans best.   The chocolate cake in a jar was nice, more than marketing, the individual serve portion was the right size and not overly sweet.  I almost never eat desert but had to try this base on what I read.  It's also a 4 out of 5 stars.    Food was good, my waitress was  fantastic, just the entry experience being so fuck up & ruin the evening, so my rate is 2 stars.    It will be a long while before I come back to Atlanta & will hit Aria before I consider here again.   - Cheers !"},{"name":"Burgerville","address":"10903 NE 4th Plain Blvd","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"I remember when Burgerville used to put the calories on the receipts.

Every single person in the room had white hair, were dining in pairs, and not speaking to one another so it was very quiet despite being fairly full and made me feel like I needed to whisper to everyone at the table. \\n\\nMy sister and her sig other joined us and ordered drinks. We eventually ordered and it looked like there was no complimentary bread in the future when my boyfriend asked and was pointed toward the garlic bread in the appetizers. Weirdly, a basket of rolls and butter did make their way out later, and they were decent - soft and warm.\\n\\nI didn't necessarily have high expectations of this place, but my Pasta Primavera was not nearly as bland and tasteless as I find at similar restaurants. That being said, I ordered a side of their really good, sweet pomodoro sauce to give it more flavor (I said LESS bland than normal).

Last we went for one of the specials. It was a mixture of meats served in a tomatoe sauce with white beans - also really good!\\n\\nFor once we had room for dessert and decided to splurge.  Went for the cookie ice cream filled crepe.  It was good but nothing special.  I was picturing it to be warm on the outside with the iceream in the middle.  It more or less tasted like they just took it out of the freezer though - a bit dissappointing. \\n\\nTasca is a fantastic tapas restaurant with a really intimate and authentic atmosphere.

We've been able to enjoy: suckling pig, duck, chicken, pork, beef and various fish. \\n\\nWhen you go, they'll ask you to fill out a survey and subscribe to their newsletter. Just do it. They have so many good deals that you only learn about through the newsletter. This includes sangria specials!

We told him of our plight, and he goes, \\"Yeah, I fired that kid, come to our place, and we're gonna take care of you\\".

In an italian restaurant you expect a decent sized serving but personally I hate to get a Cheesecake Factory sized helping that overwhelms me. The serving sizes here are great for me. Enough to fill me here and some great leftovers to take home. Italian leftovers are the best. The food was well done and simple. I loved the cheese, meat, and pepper plate I had for a starter. Also, they mix a good drink here. The service didn't stand out in my mind which is actually a very positive thing. It means the waitress took orders correctly and promptly and delivered in a timely manner. If wait staff manages to get the job done without you noticing it means they did so without interrupting your conversation. \\n\\nThere are a few negatives about this place but I honestly think they are due to the fact that they have only recently opened and are still working out the kinks. The wait was outrageous. They need to get a feel for their busy times and schedule their reservations accordingly. And they need to get on perfecting politely turning over a table. When a group is holding up a table for 6 for half an hour after they've finished and already paid it's about time to say something. Also, the bread here is pretty boring and tasteless and the capers are kind of huge. \\n\\nAll in all this place serves up simple, comfort italian fare in a boisterous, fun environment.

The ambience was nice and the service was exceptional. Unfortunately,  the food was merely adequate. My wife had linguine with white clam sauce. The clams were tender and plentiful but the sauce was, well, bland. I had an old staple, eggplant parmigiano. It was like no eggplant parmigiano I have ever had. There was a stack of lightly breaded eggplant doused with red sauce on a bed of spaghetti. The presentation was similar to lasagne. There was no cheese and the sauce made the breading soggy. It was edible but far from good. We also had a calimari appetizer which we enjoyed  (although the price was well outside the norm for a similar appetizer elsewhere). I received a take home order of mushroom ravioli as part of my dinner order. I found it to be a tasty lunch the following day. My wife also ordered a Whiskey Sour with dinner, something she almost never does. She was disappointed in the drink, especially when the bill arrived and she saw it was $9.00. I had a diet coke which was just shy of $3.\\n\\nAll in all, it was an average dining experience at an above average price for dinner. We probably won't be back. If we want Italian from a chain,  we will probably go with Carrabba's. It's a known quantity that we like and has proven consistent for us over time.\\n\\nIf you want to give Maggiano's a try, you might want to go for lunch when I assume you can sample the food at lower cost."},{"name":"Old Chicago Pizza & Taproom","address":"100 Superior Plaza Way, Ste 100","city":"Superior","stars":"2.5","text":"Out running errands and stopped in for dinner and drinks.

I found their tapas to be more mexican inspired than traditional Spanish. This is very evident in the black bean crab cakes served with salsa.

To simply categorize them:\\n\\na) You're looking to buy furniture.\\n\\nb) You're looking at their displays because they're fun to play house in.\\n\\nc) You hunger for the cheap food in their cafeteria (yes, I am referring to those Swedish meatballs).\\n\\nd) You're going to take advantage of their $0.75 hotdogs (they raised it from $0.50 recently) and/or frozen yoghurt deals.\\n\\ne) All of the above.\\n\\nNow, in regards to the furniture, it's not the best quality but Ikea does offer cheap and stylish ways to improve the decor and ambience of your home. From modern to retro, they have it all. The displays provide visitors with innovative ideas on how to improve their kitchen or bedroom.

At peak hours you might have difficulty finding a place to sit and there might be left over food and trays everywhere but don't be vexed. This is only a cafeteria after all, not a fancy dining establishment.\\n\\nLast but not least, upon exiting the store, your nose will catch the luscious scent of hotdogs. Even after eating in the cafeteria when you think you're done eating, you're not. Ikea has strategically placed a food stop with even cheaper food and you've fallen for it (I always seem to).\\n\\nYou must try their frozen yoghurt at the very least.

The don katsu tei my wife ordered was equally salty with the breading thick and not crispy at all.  Musashino is one of the oldest tokyo-style sushi restaurants in Austin, the head chef having trained the likes of Tyson Cole of Uchi and Uchiko, and I still think their sushi is very good, but I won't be coming here for lunch until there's some improvement.

Big enough portion for the two of us to be satisfied.\\n\\nThe crab cake tasted good at the time, but having dined at Oceanaire the following night, the bar has been raised HIGH.

We arrived without a reservation and the host did a fantastic job keeping us informed and seating us in a prompt fashion. While we waited, we had a few drinks from the great beer selection and then sat down to eat. I have been to Sweet Cheeks before and find their BBQ to be some of the best in Boston. This experience was not much different in terms of food.\\nAfter my meal I visited the bathroom and while there, I noticed two cock roaches. The first, was stuck to some duct tape which held a Texas license plate to the wall. It was in plain sight and had been there for quite some time (since it was dead). The second was very much alive and also stuck to some duct tape. I mentioned this to the waiter as he brought our bill, but was quite repulsed and didn't want to take any of the food home with me. \\nSince then, I have made an effort to contact Sweet Cheeks via email to express my concern, but after two weeks have heard no response. Given that, I felt it important that people should be aware of the conditions at this establishment."},{"name":"Sweet Cheeks Q","address":"1381 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Tiffani Faison was on \\"Top Chef.\\"  There is so much hype about her new restaurant.  She did well in Top Chef-and I don't doubt that her accolades on the show were well deserved.  I also saw a youtube video with her.  I have read at least 2 articles where she was mentioned.  \\n\\nGiven Boston's limited choices on Southern-style BBQ-I was really excited to try the restaurant.  I think the concept is great, and Ms. Faison's reputation precedes her.  \\n\\nHowever, the value of the meal that I received is questionable.  I honestly think it costs about $3-$4.00 to make my meal given the portions & what was included.  Yet the tray costs $24.00 before tax and tip.  \\n\\nIf you get full, I think it's from side dishes and condiments/filler food.  Each tray comes with a hot & cold side dish, 2 pieces of white bread, and pickles/onions.  That's what I think fills you up-not the actual meat.  The portion of meat is simply too small for the tray I received.  \\n\\nI have been to Texas.  Portions in Texas are huge.  So I felt like I was paying for a lot of overhead, a huge staff, and the hype around a celebrity chef.  I am not trying to put Ms. Faison down-I don't doubt her culinary talent, or her hard work.  \\n\\nBut the portions did not justify the price.\\n\\nThe mac and cheese was very good.  It's well seasoned and comes in a mug. I love mac and cheese-so that was a highlight.  However, mac and cheese (especially at the size of a mug) doesn't cost much.  The small portion of pickles & onions also costs very little.  \\n\\nThen there's the bread.  You get generous portions of rolls/bread in many restaurants for free.  For the price of the tray-I was expecting more.  You get two pieces of white bread-bread that looks like it came straight out of a Wonder Bread package.  It's not corn bread.  It just looked like someone pulled out 2 slices of white wonder bread and then put it on the tray.  \\n\\n I liked the brisket.  But there's too little meat.  The sauces are good-but I don't want to pay $24.00 before tax and tip for side dishes and filler food, with small portions of meat.  \\n\\nI don't mind the utensils.  I am not a fan of communal tables-but I understand that the restaurant is aiming for a down home feel.  The decor is fine.  There were a lot of waitstaff when we went.  I think it's a great concept, but the value of the food is poor.  \\n\\nIf I didn't know a celebrity chef headed this restaurant-this is something I could make myself very easily.  And I am not a good cook.\\n\\nBut it's simply too expensive for the portion of meat you're getting.  It's not a good deal. Disappointed. The atmosphere is fun, loud, and Ms. Faison is a star chef for the right reasons.  \\n\\nBut I don't think the prices are fair, and the portions are ludicrous.  Oh and don't give me 2 slices of Wonderbread-put some effort.  For these prices, give me something really fantastic or go down home comfort food with large portions.  This meal failed on both counts."},{"name":"Diesel Cafe","address":"257 Elm St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Diesel is by far my favorite coffee shop.

However there was something on the burger that I didn't care for and that was the arugula...

The truffled popcorn was pretty good, but I mean you can't really go wrong with popcorn and truffle oil.  The cheese and charcuterie plate had 3 cheeses and 3 meats.  They were out of one of the cheeses I ordered so we got a replacement one.  This is your basic meat and cheese.  The brussels sprouts were highly recommended, but I wasn't a big fan.  They come with apples wedged between them.  I really like roasted brussles sprouts so these just seemed undercooked to me.  They were cooked perfectly fine.  Just not my preparation preference for them.\\n\\nFor my meal, I got to sample the wild mushroom tartine and the grilled cheese. The tartine was tasty, but not exactly what I was expecting when I ordered a tartine.  It was more of a flatbread/pizza like item instead of a tartine. It tasted ok.  The grilled cheese, on the other hand, was fantastic.  It was the best thing I ate the entire evening.  It's served with a side of tomato compote and date jam.  The date jam was delicious.  The tomato compote needed to be served in a bigger container - or at least a container with a wider opening. You couldn't dip the bread into the small vessel.

But if artery hardening joy and massive, rum-heavy drinks are what you seek? Welcome to heaven.\\n\\nCazuela's, in a small storefront just north of campus, has a huge menu, catering to American palates with slightly Mexicanized versions of burgers and chicken parmigiana but, trust me, just go for the Mexican-American classics. The spicy-sweet tamales here are delicious, the chicken enchiladas are rich and homey, tacos bring options of flour or corn tortillas, and the quesadillas-- yes, those I teased a moment ago-- are huge and filled with flavorful sauteed vegetables and mild Mexican cheese.\\n\\nFor me, the shining star is the nachos supremos. A half order runs around $4.95 and it's definitely the best dining deal around the campus area. Heaped with beans, queso, lettuce, tomato, ground beef, and chicken, it's rich and hugely filling. Top it with Cazuela's excellent salty, slightly smoky, spicy chorizo-- definitely worth it for the extra dollar. Oh, and the drinks.\\n\\nCazuela's owners often have great discounts available to students; just check their website for coupons before heading over.

Like I mentioned, Fridays steak day had three different steaks available for $9.50 - $10.95.  On Tuesdays, they have a super amazing special where a meal and voucher for a movie is only $14.95!\\n\\nKemily ordered the steak and prawns ($10.95) -- two beef tenderloin medallions with garlic prawns served on roasted potatoes, grilled tomatoes and seasonal veggies.  The prawns were alright, but to me they were very insignificant.  They didn't have much flavour to them but they weren't terrible either.  Ironically, she went to Black + Blue, which was pretty much next door, earlier that week.  But looking at this presentation, we were really impressed.  It was well-presented and practically amazing compared to the other cheap steak places I've been to.\\n\\nMy peppercorn steak ($10.95) was pretty similar and also had two medallions, but instead of prawns, it came with peppercorn sauce.  The sauce was not bad and I preferred it over the prawns.  Compared to Kingspark's cheapo steak (I'm trying to provide an example that I've posted on), this was the clear winner.  This one was juicier, probably because it was much thicker as well.  Still, it's not the best steak in the world, but pretty darn good for $11.  The only disappointment I had was that the first medallion was a little bit overcooked for me (kind of medium rather than med-rare), but the second one (above) was just right (even though it sat longer).  \\n\\n Besides for the steak, the roasted potatoes were also really good and the skins were crisp.  The tomatoes actually looked good and I tried to eat half, but I hate raw-ish tomatoes by themselves so I gave up.  \\n\\nAlthough the steak is not the best in the world, for $11, it's a really good deal, especially in downtown (yeah, it's a \\"cafeteria\\" but whatever).

The filet medallions were tasty as well. I recommend the filet medallion and ribs combo for some meat variety.\\n\\nBut if you're craving something from the sea, I recommend the shrimp and salmon piccata. Although the shrimp had a very small hint of fishiness, the portion size was very substantial. The salmon was moist and cooked nicely. The wild rice was a smart pairing, and spritzing a bit of fresh lemon juice pulled this whole dish together. \\n\\nOverall, portions are huge and substantial, and definitely fit the price tag.

For example, the food in the display case is often-- I might even say regularly-- moldy. They don't serve customers from the display case, but if they're that careless about what customers CAN see, what's going on that we don't see? Surfaces are often sticky and dusty, the drink machine sometimes looks like it hasn't been cleaned in a while...\\n\\nThere are a handful of really amazing employees here, so that's something-- but given that the food is in something of a downward spiral, I'm not only done being a regular at Goldberg's, but done being a customer, period."},{"name":"Bari Food Cart","address":"5205 SE Foster Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"I had read plenty of good things on Yelp about the Bari Food Cart so I was really eager to go and try their much-acclaimed Panzerotti.

I actually think their duck confit is better than Bistro Niko's which I previously thought was the best.  My husband had the foie gras.  He said it was amazing.  The only issue was that it said market price next to the foie gras.  We assumed it would be like $15 considering the other appetizers were the same or less.  It was $25.  Our bad for assuming.  We now know to always ask in advance what \\"market price\\" means even if it makes us look cheap and tacky.\\n\\nThe only complaint is that the tables are really close together.  Also, we were seated next to a large group where one of the women had one of those loud, high-pitched laughs similar to Wicked Witch of the West.

For the past several years, she and I have been trying to enjoy as much quality food as possible on a college student's budget. We would typically go to The Med during happy hour which is great; however, after about a dozen happy hour visits to the Med, the food on the happy hour menu began to become a bit \\"vanilla.\\"\\n \\nDuring the summer of 2011, I began to frequent Centro every Friday during happy hour with a number of older co-workers. They would go there for the quality 1921 coin-style margaritas while I would enjoy the more affordable, house coin-style margarita (which rocks!).\\n\\nAs I began to frequent Centro more and more during the fall of 2011, I quickly came to the realization that Centro is without doubt the best restaurant on the west-end of pearl! Furthermore, because Centro is run by the Big Red F Restaurant Group, it is consistently good.\\n\\nIn terms of what to order off the happy hour menu - To begin, you cannot go wrong with any of the three salsas. That being said, the apricot and habanero salsa is by far one of the tastiest foods I have ever enjoyed. It pairs the sweet taste of apricots with the fire of habanero to form one heck of a tasty salsa. You also cannot go wrong with the manchego-chimichurri verde fries, which features a skillet full of fries with manchego cheese and beyond tasty chimichurri bits. The seared greens and the pork green chili nachos are each really good; however, they're not perfect dishes like the habanero/apricot salsa and the manchego-chimichurri fries. (Not on the happy hour menu - if you're looking for a great soup, try the Sopa Azteca - beyond delicious, super filling, and beautifully presented)\\n\\nTaco wise - both the Pork and the Shrimp are great. The jalapeno cilantro aioli on the scrimp taco is super good, while the Pork taco is just all-around fantastic.\\n\\nDrink Wise - the Top Rope Mexican beer is brewed solely for Centro, which makes it both special and very enjoyable. Both the rum and coke and the house margarita are really good; however, the $5 gold coin-style house margarita is the real draw. Tasty yet strong - exactly what a college student wants in their high-end margarita.\\n\\nIn conclusion, as a lifelong resident of Boulder and avid foodie, I declare Centro Latin Kitchen and Refreshments Palace to be the best happy hour restaurant in town!!"},{"name":"Blue Moon Pizza","address":"5610 Glenridge Dr, Ste 110","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"Finally writing after the 3rd visit.

So I will start out saying that I have never heard from friends or family about having an experience like this. \\n\\nWe went on a Friday night which is not the best time to try a hole in the wall, we understood it would be busy. We were greeted, cool-ly, by the staff and she said they were busy but agreed to take our number and said nothing else about it. They did not take a name. \\n\\nWe saw her greet Japanese that came in behind us with enthusiasm. We have lived in Japan and were very excited to have tonkotsu for the first time after moving back to Oregon.\\n\\nWe were hoping to celebrate my father-in-law's retirement here, so we were with my elder in-laws on a cool night. \\n\\nSo we walked around the shopping center for about an hour, no problem we had a feeling it would be worth the wait. I stopped in to check with the staff after about an hour to see if I had given her the correct number, it was correct. At this point it appeared my number was next on the list. Eventually we were there for over an hour and a half, no call. A group of Japanese students told me they were waiting about an hour as we waited together and the Japanese students puffed cigs. (This too, was reminiscent of time in Japan)\\n\\nThe group of students disappeared, and I assumed perhaps it was because there was another table, but the group of Japanese students had been seated while there was no space for us. I talked to one member of the staff who mentioned that the same woman I had checked in with TWICE about the number and our place on the list (for about 1hr45 minutes wait) and then proceeded to wait another 10 minutes for this woman to come over to check the list ofr the THIRD time.\\n\\nOur phone number was crossed off!

The place is almost always occupied with students and people hanging out; it may be difficult or impossible to find seating at some points in the evening.  Wireless is fee-based, similar pricing to 1369 and same provider (if I remember correctly).  For the night owls, Diesel is open extremely late compared to other shops.\\n\\nThe mixed coffee drinks I've tried have always been pretty good, usually accompanied by some pretty cool latte art.  They're a tad small for the price, but that's not stopping me from ordering.\\n\\nIn terms of studying, the booths and tables in the back section are better.

The host greeted us and for about 5 minutes fumbled with the menus - cocktail and food before he acknowledged us again and seated us. I knew at that point that we were in trouble. Our waiter took the order and drinks came. My daughter got the wrong wine and was told that the house would buy her that glass. Our food came - it took at least 45 minutes to get the mains - and mine was cold. Our waiter was nowhere to be seen but a waitress took my plate away and told me she would take care of it. I asked for spinach and beans as a side dish. The plate came back - all beans no spinach and totally overcooked. The chicken saltimbocca was dried out completely. Suddenly the waiter appeared with my daughter's original choice of wine! She still had half a glass of the 'wrong' wine! He said \\"Oh here is the glass of wine you had wanted to have with your meal\\". She sent it back. It was the only attentive thing he had done in the course of the meal! Manipulative way to add another $10.00 to the bill. Meal over, we were not asked if we wanted dessert. I ordered coffee. It took about 20 minutes to get that cup! I was never offered a refill. By that point, disgusted, we asked for our check - because our waiter was missing again, my daughter had to get up to attract someone's attention! The waiter then brought the check and told me \\"coffee is on us\\" as if he had given me this huge gift. I almost laughed in his face. First time I ever gave a pathetic tip to any waiter!

She comped the steak...and I gave her a very generous tip - considering she did not cook the meal - and she never even said thank you.  The famous bean salad appetizer was served with saltines in packets....really??...no more assortment of nice crackers.  The popovers were ice cold - almost frozen inside.  The shrimp tasted like iodine - not fresh at all!  The house wine was horrible.  My mom's steak was grey and cooked too long.  Needless to say - I will NOT be going back any time soon.  I know they have a loyal following but I will not be one of them.  Too many other great places to eat - especially in the Saugus area!"},{"name":"Elevation Burger","address":"2525 W.

The regular fries are an obscene portion. They are enough for about 4 people, or 2 starving people. You can get them \\"Five Guys Fries\\" (lightly salted) or \\"Cajun\\" (with spicy seasoning salt). I opted for the cajun and they were good. Not spectacular- good. Crispy, oily, and salty. What fries are generally supposed to be, but with an added kick of spice. The burger was good. Meat was decent quality- standard 80/20 mix looked like.. Their toppings are free, which is great, in my opinion. You can get everything from sauteed mushrooms to relish to your standard mayo-ketchup-mustard. I got grilled onions, ketchup, mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato. My burger was nice and juicy and they were generous with all the topping. My order came out super fast, too. I didn't even get a chance to get any peanuts, which I didn't need anyway.

I was ordering for two people, so I ordered The Da Vinci (a chicken sandwich) and a Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad. I know I was clear about adding chicken to the ceasar salad, so I'm not sure why I ended up with a Da Vinci with a side caesar salad (no chicken). I had no idea that sandwiches come with a side choice, so it never occurred to me that I could end up with a side salad. The person who took my order, at the very least, should have asked me to clarify when I indicated I wanted chicken with my caesar salad.\\n\\nOn top of it all, the Da Vinci was in the same container as the salad, so the sandwich bun was drenched/soggy with caesar sauce, and the greens for the sandwich got mixed up with the salad greens. \\n\\nSo now we're stuck with a soggy sandwich and a small salad for dinner.

No kidding the shopping center this is located in is called that.  I didn't think it possible. Fresh Chinese food. REAL Pot Stickers like Mama san used to make. Home made. Not Frozen Fried. Great Crab Puff's also fresh. Who am I kidding it is all fresh. I really dig this place. They kept the buffet fresh and not sloppy in any buffet way. Friendly courteous staff. The General Tso's was not Spicy enough off the buffet for me but I can understand. Not everyone has my fire proof taste buds. The Red Chili Oil was right next to it and gave it the kick I wanted. Never the less it was great tasting and not too sweet. Did I mention FRESH again? That is all I ran into. Fresh food. Not coagulated pieces of chicken stuck to the bottom of a caked on pan as in some places. The ambience was nice enough that I would have a First Date here. Afterwards I did not feel awkwardly full or yucky as you do from some buffets. Please go and try the buffet and next time I plan to order straight from the menu now that I know what I am in for.

We get there in 10 minutes and snatch a booth for 4 right as it opens up.\\n\\nTHE WAIT: None at 11am on a Sunday! (See above.)\\n\\nTHE SERVICE: They're busy but efficient; our group of 4 was in and out in under an hour. We ordered and got our food out quickly. A little lagging with filling waters sometimes (but there were like 3 servers and 1 busboy for at least 15 tables). They were a little slow to bring the check, and I had to ask a couple times for a takeout box. \\n\\nTHE COST: $40 minus tip for four brunch dishes. So cheap!\\n\\nMUST-HAVES: Their sandwiches, their omelets!! \\n\\nOVERALL: The food is a solid 4 stars, if not better. But they get bumped up for the awesome value and being a well-kept secret, i.e. no wait for Sunday brunch!\\n\\n* The 35 (bacon eggs cheese veggie Breakfast Sandwich) - 4 stars\\nThe 35: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/brookline-lunch-cambridge?select=EVb7vqIif5zDfnV7NSsbTw#MWNlgw584hWCXQ3s69ulJw\\nHomefries: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/brookline-lunch-cambridge?select=EVb7vqIif5zDfnV7NSsbTw#MLApWwjm4hM4qH8rOV3Wxg\\nVery tasty and hearty, despite not having too much meat! A perfect ratio of bread to filling, perfect amounts of eggs/cheese/veggie, and it stayed together well under the evenly toasted whole wheat bread. I just wished the bacon were a bit more crispy (I had to open up my sandwich to make sure it was there). The homefries (for ALL dishes): a big whopping side. Potatoes on the soft side, but retains a nicely crisped outer layer. The veggies are mixed in at good ratios, but they're a tad old and soft.\\n\\n* Ultimate Omelet - 4 stars\\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/brookline-lunch-cambridge?select=EVb7vqIif5zDfnV7NSsbTw#EVb7vqIif5zDfnV7NSsbTw\\nTried a bite: good stuff. The chicken is a little on the hard side and was a pretty big chunk, but overall its a good meaty dish and the eggs were cooked soft. The homefries, as always, great.\\n\\n* Banana French Toast - 3 stars\\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/brookline-lunch-cambridge?select=EVb7vqIif5zDfnV7NSsbTw#BGrF6XvDW5Pw2VAYqgGOQQ\\nSolid, but not amazing. Will satisfy your sweet tooth, but don't go out of your way to get this - I've definitely had softer, more moist french toast. Plus it's about the same cost for less food (no homefries!) though you do get eggs + ham on the side. \\n\\n* Salmon Benedict - 3.5 stars\\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/brookline-lunch-cambridge?select=EVb7vqIif5zDfnV7NSsbTw#kPQ9V3FgnaJ6LDBORhNWZw\\nWould have been 4 stars but there was very, very little salmon.

I was at Piedmont Hospital and had not been to Watershed since they were housed in Decatur.  I was trying to enter the restaurant from Peachtree Road and this building was definitely built/renovated since 1990 so the ADA code requires accessible entry which cannot be blocked by physical objects.  They close for lunch at 3 p.m.  I am in a 3 wheel scooter and spent about 30 minutes trying to figure out how to get in the building.  I finally had to go to the back and come in like a delivery person via a poorly lit garage.    The one accessible portal in the front was blocked by a large concrete planter by the restaurant and even if the planter had not been there, the tables arranged out front by Watershed did not have adequate mandated accessible clearance between each table so even if they had not blocked the accessible entrance, you could not get to the double doors which were truly the only easily accessible entry in the front of the building.   By the time I found my way in, it was 2:45 p.m.  No one was at the hostess stand.  When the hostess finally came up front, I stated that I was there for lunch.  Her lips pursed in a little moue of disapproval and she told me to pick a table.  She then came up to me and asked if I needed a menu.  Yes, I did.  She brought back the menu and told me that the kitchen closed in 17 minutes and she would be back momentarily with a waitress.  By this time, my slow burn was really igniting into a raging inferno.  Obviously, this place is owned and run by a bunch of TABs.  What is a TAB?  TABs are those who are Temporarily Able Bodied -- because trust me, you also will eventually have need of a crutch, a cane, a scooter or have children in a stroller or be less than sure footed at least once in your lifetime -- in each instance, you will need an accessible entrance.  Those who own and manage this restaurant had deliberately gone against the ADA Act and willfully blocked the building's accessible entrance at the front of the building.  Well, my hard-earned money walks with me and I will not spend money at an establishment that makes me wander around the building and then come in through a poorly lit garage without accessible walkways so I was having to scoot through aisles meant for automobiles; I could have easily been slammed into by a car.

Prepare to park a block away if you don't get one of their extremely limited number of parking spots.  Even then I decided to park on the street, as the inconsiderate in their SUVs parked in spots designated for compacts.\\n\\nMy first huge problem with this place is that it's counter service.  This place is not inexpensive, and food like this should be ordered at the table, not a counter.  (And as another poster mentioned, don't ask me for a tip when all you did was stand there and take my order, which you're being paid to do.)  This setup is bad.  Really bad.  You enter and don't know where to go at first.  It seems as if you would be seated, but you finally determine you need to order at the counter.  This causes problems with the seating, as I saw some people enter and immediately take tables while their friends stood in line, meaning those of us who correctly stood in line to order first had to wait longer for tables.\\n\\nOne big reason I can't stand counter service is because you have to make a decision quickly.  When you have table service you can take your time and look over the menu, especially when you're at a new place.  But I decided on a cup of the gazpacho and meatballs with spaghetti (not spaghetti and meatballs).  These veal meatballs turned out to be perfect for what I wanted that day.  Just the right portion, and the taste was absolutely spot on.  If it weren't for the fact that we were constantly shooing away flies it could have been just a bit better.  The gazpacho was amazingly fresh.  My friend had the shaved lamb sandwich.  I got a taste of that, which was very good.\\n\\nAs some have mentioned, the prices here are slightly skewed.  Maybe it's because of the high-rent area.  But the place is obviously meant for those who can afford to live in the area.  That said, however, it seemed more like a place where people came to be seen, not necessarily to enjoy a well-prepared and fresh meal.  Indeed, the two girls next to us were decked out in their Saturday tennis-at-the-club attire and left half of their meal on the table!  The busboy couldn't even tell that they had left, there was so much food leftover.  I hate to see something like that, so I asked if he could take the meat off the sandwich that was left so I could give it to my dog.  He obliged.\\n\\nAs much as one is paying for the food, I was a bit put off when the guy taking our order said they had already run out of glasses, so he was going to have to give us plastic cups.  Seemed odd, but oh well.  Not having enough tableware for your patrons seems a bit cheap.  I did have to get more ice, but had to stand at the counter for a while.  Since this is counter service, no one comes around to check on you.\\n\\nThey do have a \\"grocery\\" section along the wall, selling way-too-expensive staples.  The cheese selection was very good, and I saw some varieties that I haven't found elsewhere.\\n\\nIn the end we spent $42 on a small lunch.  That kind of business model is not going to survive very long.\\n\\nI just never felt completely comfortable in this place.  It's not somewhere that you should make the effort to drive to if you aren't already close by.  But I think it's definitely worth trying.  I will, however, leave the one-upsmanship to those SUV drivers who like to prove they can park in a compact space without caring."},{"name":"Steak ‚Äôn Shake","address":"12163 S Apopka-vinland Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"2","text":"Claims they are open 24/7 but takes 45 minutes to take a drive though order.

No.  Ever since this place became \\"Brodie's\\" it's taken a turn for the worse.  I hope that going here for music and drinks continues to draw people in, but the last two times I stopped in for dinner, it was a nightmare.  A month or so ago, I purchased a Groupon to try out the new Brodie's.  I downloaded it and hubby and I went to eat there.  The food was mediocre, and I can't even remember what we had, but it was not horrible enough warrant a change in my Yelp review.  HowEVER, the manager would not honor the Groupon.  Now, we're a little tiny bit cranky because the food was not so great, but on top of that the guy doesn't accept the Groupon.  His story was that Groupon never \\"came in\\" to show him how to redeem them.  Well, Mr. Manager, you write down the voucher number and contact Groupon on your own time to resolve it.  It's not my problem.  But my husband and I decided to let it go, and that stuck us with going to Brodie's again to redeem this Groupon on another visit.  Well, I like to give a place a second chance anyway, especially a place in my beloved Salem, so last night I went in with my 13 year old son and his friend.  This trip I do remember well.  I ordered the veggie burger, and Yelpers, I wish I'd taken a picture.  BUT I could take a picture of the inside of my garbage disposal and you'd get the idea.  I have never seen such a sorry excuse for a veggie burger in my life!  I could not eat it.  It looked like a pile of refuse, and it tasted disgusting!  Parked next to that mess were cold onion rings. My son's hamburger was all \\"tattered\\" around the edges, if you can picture that (this review REALLY needs accompanying gross/hilarious photos, but I'm sure you can use your imagination) and was generally ugly and undercooked.  My son's friend's fries did not come out until a few minutes after everyone was served.  Odd.  But they put a few \\"token\\" fries on his plate, and the waitress explained that the rest of them were coming soon.  What the heck was that all about?  So, we get some samples from the bottom of the fry-o-lator to tide us over until the real fries come out?  This is one of those crazy times when I don't know whether to laugh or run away screaming.  So, I spoke with the waitress about the scary excuse of a veggie burger and she was very nice about it.  OK, here comes the bill.  Yay for the fact that they actually honored my Groupon.  BOO for the fact that the veggie debacle was still on the bill.  Well, you're going to think I'm a pushover, but if they'd taken it off it would have been an act of goodwill, and frankly, I don't want any goodwill from Brodie's.  They SHOULD have taken that thing off my bill considering I hardly touched it and very politely and even compassionately whispered to the waitress about it.  (the boys ate the cold onion rings, so I could hardly take an issue with that part of my plate)  I should not have had to ask.  Ah, well, Brodie's never again.

Although Tasca is techniquily Brighton, its on the dreadful stretch of the B-Line that lacks the charm and sophistication of the rest of the area.\\n\\nFor me, that's what makes Tasca a hidden gem.

Don't we all have reviews like that? Well, we should have. \\n\\nThere's nothing I dislike about this place, all the entrees range from $6.50 - 8.50, and the menu is the best of an Asian hit parade - stir-frys, Pho, vermicelli bowls, etc. All things considered, it's cheap, filling, and does the job. My thing is this: If I'm in the mood for a General Tso's, it's just as easy for me to go straight to Shu-Shu's, but if you insist on coming here, I won't go nuts and start spitting on you either. I feel the same way about their Pho Ga or Char-grilled Pork Vermicelli bowl - if you want them here instead of Pho Saigon or Hai Ky, yeah okay, I'll come along. Incidentally, the char-grilled stuff at Food Shui is a tad saucier than I prefer, but that's not a deal breaker for me.\\n\\nOh you have to love a place with a Yelp sticker on the door, where you can save a couple of bucks during lunch, and where they'll throw in a drink if you dine in from 4-7pm. You order at the counter, they bring you your food, and everything is served in plastic and Styrofoam. I recall describing Food Shui once as the Asian strip mall equivalent to G'Raj Mahal. \\n\\nOne more thing: They do move at the speed of light here. And I love the sound of sizzling woks ten-seconds after placing an order. If you just happen to be on your way to Ryan's across the street or the Original Pancake House next door, and all of a sudden that little inner-Asian in you starts being fussy, Food Shui will definitely soothe that savage beast."},{"name":"Gigi's Cafe","address":"6320 SW Capitol Hwy","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"First time here.

A Charcuterie plate, an arugula salad with some shaved parmesan and an heirloom tomato Neapolitan (a fancy caprese salad.)   The first two salads were pretty mediocre but the heirloom tomato salad really took it to the next level.  It might have been that aged balsamic that added the extra zing.  Then we got a bunch of different pizzas.  I had high hopes for the steak and gorgonzola pizza and was disappointed when the pizza came out with slices of roast beef instead of steak.  The steak and gorgonzola pizza also had a ton of arugula on it.  Personally I don't think green stuff belongs on a meat pizza.  Maybe you agree, maybe you don't but this is my review.  There was another pie that I loved.  It had roasted tomatoes and super flavorful caramelized onions. It was the best pizza of the night.  The sausage pizza was kind of a let down.

It's also my favorite date spot, and I have a feeling that even if you were with someone who turned out to be super boring you would leave after dinner thinking the date wasn't so bad simply because the dining experience would be clouding your judgment. On further analysis later that night you might realize the good vibes were largely due to the perfectly warm and inviting interior ambiance, the fun things to look at, the great food to eat, excellent libations, and haiku's to read and write. On the other hand, Haiku can make a good date even better. Sharing a great meal with an individual or group of friends is one of the best bonding experiences around, making Haiku an idyllic choice for really any occasion.\\n\\nThe menu is a mix of Asian fusion foods and delicious sushi, arguably the best in the city. Generally speaking, Haiku takes typical items, like a California roll, and personalizes it, adding Ohio-friendly items like cream cheese (try the shrimp tempura or the harvest roll) or pecans (check out the Buckeye crunch) to make even the most demur of sushi eaters new converts or to keep things interesting for sushi veterans. \\n\\nOn my most recent visit, I stopped in for the Restaurant Week special: a price-fixed three-course meal going for $25 per diner, and featuring a selection of house favorites. For the first course my dinner partner got the chicken lettuce wrap, which is probably a good-sized lunch portion for one. Picture this: a large plate loaded with minced chicken and rice noodles cooked in white onions, scallions, soy, ginger, all on top of a handful of mixed greens. Now, load it onto the whole leaves of romaine served on the side, wrap it up, and you've got yourself a damn tasty chicken lettuce wrap that is also super healthy. The place is just as super chic looking inside as it was from the sidewalk, so we didn't want to be too sloppy, but this seemed to be straight up finger food that was pretty fun to eat.\\n\\nI had the mixed green veggie egg roll salad, which was deliciously fried, served with sweet and sour sauce. We didn't have any forks on our table, just the chop sticks, so the salad was nearly impossible to eat. This is probably the only strike I can come up with against the whole place. Our server, Sandi, had so much to tell us about the specials and at first seemed to just want to sell us a huge schpeel, but she was probably one of the best servers I've had in the Short North. She paced our courses just right and always had good charisma.\\n\\nThis was just the first course, and we were already filling up. Next came the sushi. I tried the harvest roll (acorn squash, avocado, cream cheese), which had a surprising spicy kick to it and a good balance of textures. My friend had the white kamikazi (spicy tuna with cucumber), and speaking as a person who isn't much of a fish fan, I loved it. The tuna was fresh and the cucumber helped balance the spice. \\n\\nNeedless to say, by the time Sandi brought the third course, i.e. the main entr√©e, to us, we were stuffed. I managed to twirl a few pah thai noodles around my sticks, just enough to say it was great and that I am looking forward to the leftovers. My dinner partner's Haiku chicken was probably a better idea for ending out the already full meal. \\n\\nOutside of Restaurant Week, we probably would have just ordered the edamame and two sushi rolls and very contentedly called it a dinner. We also would have probably spent a similar amount of money and had substantially less leftovers. That said, keep an eye out for future Restaurant Week specials at Haiku, or just go there and enjoy it with family, colleagues, dates or friends. You won't be disappointed."},{"name":"Stephanie's On Newbury","address":"190 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I've been to Stephanie's many times.  I would say my other experiences there have been 2.5 to 3 stars.  Today, not so much.  I had not been there in a while and was surprised to be able to be seated right away for brunch.  My sister and I ordered their Frittered French Toast which I've had several times before.  My husband ordered the crab benedict and my brother in law ordered pancakes. I also ordered a side of home fries, well done, please. The waiter was very personable, very funny.  My sister and brother in law's capuccino was subpar.  My coffee came in a heavily stained cup.  Owning a cafe I *know* you can actually wash the coffee off the mugs.  Really, you can.  The French Toast looked as if it was just thrown on the plate, no garnish, no attempt to make it look pretty.  Same goes for the pancakes.  I picked up the alleged home fries to put some on my plate but on closer look they seemed really strange to me.  I tell the others \\"I think there's bacon in here\\".  We ask the waiter about it and he says \\"there's corned beef\\".  I thought it unusual to have corned beef on home fries until I looked at my husband's plate which included home fries.  They had actually brought us corned beef hash.  I'm a vegetarian so not much I could do with that.  We kept trying to get our waiter's attention but no dice.  Meanwhile, my brother in law tells us he can't eat his pancakes as they are undercooked.  Very.  French Toast was very good, though.  Very, very, very greasy, which I find to be a desirable trait so if you don't like oil dripping from your bread this is not the dish for you but to me it was just what the Dr ordered.  My sister claimed she liked it but ate very little.  My husband was happy with his dish.  When the waiter finally came by we told him we had ordered potatoes and not hashed but by this time we were done eating and did not want anything else and asked him to take it off the check.  He then noticed that my bro-in-law had not eaten his pancakes and asked if there was something wrong with them and then said he would take that off the check as well which was nice since we were not even going to ask.\\nSadly, I don't think I'll be back to Stephanie's.  It had a semi-good run but I think it might be over."},{"name":"Library Square","address":"300 W Georgia St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"I have heard nothing but great things about this place and was stoked to check out their themed Friday night dance party. My boyfriend said that last night we'd go to the Library around 9p for the 90's night for his friend's birthday party. We put on the appropriate hideous 90's attire and we made a dash before it could get too busy. When we arrived we saw there were two lines, one was probably for the more upscale $$$ to buy their way in/guest list and the other public waiting line. We opted for the second since we obviously didn't look like we could even buy our way in (ripped jeans, short ugly skirt, flannel cinched around waists, converses, and ugly knee-high socks.) \\n\\nWe were very proud of our attire but quickly noticed how the waif-like young 20-something girls around us were in short black \\"You know what I have to offer\\" miniskirts, smoking their cigarettes while trying to hide their virgin lungs from the hacking cough, and spraying themselves with apple scented perfume to mask their smoke. Perhaps they are more the \\"scene but not smelled\\" type (yes, I meant \\"scene.\\") The men were all bathed in their Axe man spray with care with hopes of young \\"bitches\\" would soon be out of their underwear. Now, I'm sure they are all nice people but on a Friday night people want to be observed and have somewhat of a requirement to get shitfaced and get their poke on.\\n\\nWe waited for one full hour and the line went from roughly 50 people ahead of us to about 35 or so. The young beautifuls were walking up to the bouncers hugging them and slipping cash in their hands with a glint of hope the velvety rope would be lifted just for them.\\n\\nThe 10:30p hour came and my boyfriend and I decided to ditch and head out. We wished our fellow club hopping hopefuls \\"good luck\\" and we marched on and had a good time at a corner bar where we didn't feel judged by our apparel and we weren't held in a line like livestock. \\n\\nI do wish we had gotten inside to dance to the fun 90's music with our friends for the birthday party but because the bar owners think (?) that they have a hot spot and need bouncers to regulate and make it look like a hot spot because of all the people waiting in a long mooing line...we weren't able to partake in the fun times.\\n\\nI have never rated anything on yelp without going in and experiencing what the place has to offer but I honestly felt like I needed to get this out to my fellow yelpers.

I was not a huge fan of the food, which was okay, but not great and seemed a little pricy for what it was (I have eaten at many restaurants featuring local organics that have wait staff and still aren't so pricy).  I also was disappointed in the cashier not knowing enough about the menu to answer a very basic question which resulted in my husband being unable to eat most of what he ordered.\\n\\nI had a tomato salad, which was extraordinarily overpriced given that it was about four or five sliced heirloom organic tomatoes, a hunk of grilled bread, and a LOT of dressing.  Good, but not worth over $20! \\n\\nI also didn't like the snooty cashier whose response to a question we had about the menu resulted in us ordering two dishes that my husband couldn't eat.  He can't eat seeds; the beans and rice came with a jalapeno salsa with guess what? Seeds!  And the dressing that was \\"like it says, just lettuce and cabbage and dressing\\" had nuts in it.  Nice.  They both tasted okay (it really is hard to screw up rice and beans and salad), but it sucked that we both couldn't enjoy it.  I really wanted to like it, but it just wasn't good enough.\\n\\nMy biggest problem honestly is that if  the person responsible for knowing the menu, didn't know it well enough to not send a customer to the hospital or make them seriously ill.

He loves burgers  and he was curious about this place.\\n\\nIt was tiny and not very impressive inside. But I thought \\"who cares? I'm here for the food!\\" You order at the counter and they bring the food to you. The one thing that sucks about this is that they have a 'bar' and you can order beer from draft. However, they don't keep a tab open or anything, so everytime we wanted another beer, we had to go the register to pay for each one individually.\\n\\nThe options on the menu were pretty limited. It's a build your own burger type of situation. They had 4 options of 'signature burgers' but they were pretty unimpressive (ex. swiss mushroom burger, morning burger with egg and bacon). My husband ordered the swiss mushroom burger with tater tots. I built my own burger with an egg and avocado in it (no sides). We each ordered a beer. We decided to sit at the bar.\\n\\nThere were two women sharing the responsibilites of taking orders at the counter and bringing out food to the table. However, after we ordered, one of them went on a break. The other girl remained behind the counter snacking on stuff in the kitchen. Before our food came out, my husband had finished his beer. I went back to the counter to order a second beer. I stood there for almost 5 minutes before someone came to take my order. The girl that was snacking in the kitchen pretty much just stared at me and didn't say anything like \\"I'll be right there with you\\" or \\"one moment please\\".\\n\\nMy husband got his second drink and immediately afterwards we got our food. However, my husband didn't get his tater tots. He told her he was missing them. She said \\"they'll be right out\\". She brought out the food for the other two orders after us (they all had orders of fries and received their fries). After my husband was halfway through his burger, I asked her about the tater tots again. She said \\"they're almost ready\\". My husband finished his whole burger and I finished mine as well. Still no tater tots. I'm already done with my beer at this point. She avoids our table out of embarrassment that the tater tots aren't ready yet. So she never asked us how our meal was or if we needed more drinks, nothing. After 5 more minutes after being done eating, tater tots arrive. She cleans up our plates. \\n\\nI don't mind if something is late and can't be prepared on time if we're told that ahead of time. Just say something like \\"I apologize, there's a delay with the tater tots, can I get you fries insead?\\" Or offer something like \\"here's a drink on the house for the delay\\".

All in all, a great start.\\n\\nI ordered the Homefield burger, which has a lot of things going on. Lots of flavor, but be warned, it's a big burger. My son had the Monte Cristo and was over the moon about it. The key to a good Monte Cristo is the French Toast, which in this case was light and airy. Too often they are too dense, and that wasn't the case here. Finally my wife had the Birdy Club Sandwich, which will put most average club sandwiches to shame. Great fresh ingredients, but what made the sandwich special was the bread. It's a jalapeno Cornbread yeast bread. Fantastic texture, wonderful flavor, just perfect.\\n\\nWe ended the evening by sharing an order of homemade sopapillas. Great texture and flavor. But what made the dish was the homemade whipped cream. I challenge Yelpers to find a better whipped cream anywhere. The whipped cream also accented my son's brownie a la mode, which was blissfully warm and chocolatey.\\n\\nTwo final notes....\\n\\n1) Everything at this place is homemade and fresh. From the tortillas to the breads, it's all homemade and it shows.\\n\\n2) Others had complained about the service, we had no problems whatsoever. In fact, we saw outstanding service from Jessica and Maria. The place was jammed and it was only the two of them, yet they did not  let the service suffer. In fact it was the opposite. They both hustled like crazy, and we wanted for nothing, as the drinks got refilled, the extra napkins showed up, all without us asking. Just superb service under very difficult circumstances.\\n\\nAnyway, if my son enrolls at PSU, we will definitely be coming back."},{"name":"Shabu & Mein","address":"148 1st St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Great food, service and atmosphere! \\n\\nI grew up in Japan and authentic Japanese Ramen is very hard to find in Boston - I'm so glad I came across Shabu & Mein!

It went downhill from there...\\n\\nWe were greeted by our server was informed she was only on until 5 but in the mean time would get us comfortable. Perfect! We ordered the classic two waters while we looked over the menu. The water took time to get to us ( 10 minutes ). We also asked to have water refilled 3 times... And they kept forgetting. We then were asked about drinks and we ordered a Bellini. We waited 15 minutes before reminding them. Again, not received. When the waitress came back to see if we wanted food... We noted that the bellinis still haven't come. She said they would be up right away... But we received our APPIE first. We reminded AGAIN. 3 is the magic number I guess? We had then waited about 30+ minutes for our bellinis. With my fish tacos ( which were mediocre ) I asked for yam fries to be served with my fish tacos. They were forgotten about and had to remind them TWICE before I received. I had by then already ate half of my tacos. \\n\\nThe yam fries were removed from the bill but what about the drinks?

I was a bit disappointed by the tacos. The meat was great--the seasoning was on point and each type of meat was very flavorful. But, each taco is wrapped in tin foil, even if you dine-in. So, the tin foil causes the tortillas to get soggy, which is not cool. I would have wished that the tacos were not wrapped in tin foil but rather placed on a plate. In addition, there were no sides for the tacos. Even at taco trucks, you will find onions, carrots, green onions, peppers all on the side for you to enjoy with your taco. This place does not do that at all! Rather, you get a small amount of chopped onions and cilantro in your taco. They do give you a salsa verde, but it's just not the same. \\n\\nHorchata was great.

The space itself is lovely with a great patio. The inside is a little cramped (waiters and hostesses kept bumping us) but the outside would be really nice on a warmer night. When we arrived I ordered the Pink Vespa cocktail which took about 20 minutes to come. When it did I found it to just taste like vodka which was a little disappointing since it was supposed to have a rose taste. Next we ordered the artichoke hearts to start. When they came out we were surprised that they used marinated jarred artichokes rather than fresh. They sorta tasted like mozzarella sticks from a bar and we weren't really impressed. For our dinner we decided to try the gnocchi & a margarita pizza. I had heart that Winfo is trying for a Verace Pizza Napoletana certification for their pizzas so I was sure it would be delicious. Unfortunately it was one of the worst pizzas I've ever had. Seriously! It wasn't cooked enough and the toppings were bland. The crust wasn't special. You'd be better off going to Rounders down the street! I was seriously disappointed, especially since the pizza was $13 (and very small). We didn't finish the pizza and neither did the nearby tables. The gnocchi was good but nothing remarkable. At the end of dinner we also waited 20 minutes for our bill and then another 20 minutes for them to pick it up. I realize some of this is new business wrinkles so I'll go back and see if they can iron them out. The pizza is unforgivable. If they don't make it better they will never get a VPN certification!

The hosts and servers were very disorganized and indifferent.  It took almost 30 minutes just to place my order.  The appetizer, roasted green chiles filled with a nicely spiced peanut-based puree, was excellent.  I had a purportedly South Indian version of Tandoori chicken which was not bad, but pretty pedestrian.  The final bill for what I got, bread, appetizer, soup and chicken was kind of high.  My take is that this place for dinner is good if you know what they do well, which is definitely not everything listed on their menu, and the servers are not helpful in guiding you.

Always have had good beer, decent to good food. Never have had a problem with a bad server. Until last night. I went for their special collaboration event (female brewers from CBC/Stone/Victory). The ONLY thing good about that event was the beer. I sat at the bar, and it was not terribly busy when I arrived with a friend. We ordered drinks, then food. Now her food came out quickly, but when she tried it she said it was nearly flavorless. I however, had to wait and wait for my order. The bartender seemed to be doing everything she could to avoid looking at us or noticing our concern and attempts to get her attention. Finally, after at least 7 or 8 minutes had passed, we both managed to get her attention. She said it was a kitchen mistake. I think she was covering up though for her own mistake, which I hate. The check had our party size as 1, and listed my friend's app selection as simply an appetizer no mention that it was a meal and to be fired with my entree. When I finally got my burger, it was poorly made. Supposedly it had BBQ sauce (hence the name BBQ burger), but if it did it was invisible and tasteless. The cheese was not melted at all. And the fries were stone cold. I told the bartender who asked if I wanted new ones. Um, yeah? At this point I'd like some sort of offer to compensate for the hassle! But no. She did say she was sorry a few times at least, but it really didn't make up for how slow and poor the service was. Now, I know people who say serving beer is just as had as making cocktails. But go watch someone like Peter Cipriani handle a busy bar. Sorry, busy is not an excuse. \\nI have always liked CBC, but wow was this miserable. I might try to go again and not sit at the bar. Or maybe I'd just go for a quick beer rather than food.

I have heard about that drink but hadn't seen it until now. They also have some good cider which makes me happy because I'm not much of a beer person.  If you check-in you can get a free port with a dessert order, we used the promo the first time we went,\\n\\nFood:  It's a Scottish restaurant so expect Scottish food, that being said - it's meat heavy and not a lot of vegetarian options. There are a few things like salad, stuffed peppers, and bridies.  For vegans it's much more limited - there is only one option and it's not even a real entree. They have a vegetarian platter where you pick 3 veggie sides for your dish. Part of me thinks this idea is lazy and they should offer a hardy vegan meal and part of me thinks it's cool because you can vary it if you come often.   I think without the variety having one limited dish would get very boring over time if you came here often; but this is JP - lots of vegans live here so maybe it's time to change it up/offer more.  Typically I get the braised kale, minty mushy peas, and the hand-cut chips (aka steak fries).  Every time the server assures me it's all vegan but I have to say each time I am very skeptical.  The kale is very flavorful, almost too flavorful to be vegan and I do worry there is some butter or broth cooked with it.  I would suggest talking to the chef just to confirm it's safe to eat.  The fries and mushy peas are good too.\\n\\nThey also give you some Scottish bread and butter snack while you are waiting, I don't care for it - too dense for me.

The combo appears to be a popular menu choice which comes with Sarku chicken (a sweet teriyaki flavor), a vegetable blend, and a choice of steamed rice or fried rice. The staff are true entrepreneurs and can at times be viewed as extra eager in soliciting customers within the food court and zipping customers through the register as quickly as possible but there's nothing wrong with having minimal wait, right!

I always get a chicken rice bowl which comes with cilantro rice, black beans, blackened chicken, lettuce, pico and some sort of cilantro sauce that tastes great. They stick two cheese quesadillas on the side. The Margarita chicken is also very flavorful. I gave 4 stars over 3 stars because of the delicious and fresh tasting margaritas. That is probably the biggest stand out to me in this place and alone would be worth coming back for. Their margarita specials on Tuesdays  are hard to beat!\\n\\nCons - Service has been inconsistent and a lot of that probably has to do with having larger parties. We've encountered many problems with at least one or more people getting wrong orders, missing food, or messed up bills even with having two servers supporting our table. Many of the servers seemed inexperienced and some haven't been the friendliest. I also find the portions smaller but plates more expensive for almost the same exact dish at their sister restaurant.

The meatballs were actually rubbery in texture and the sauce was an acid pasty mess. Pasta was not al dente and was way over cooked making this dish close to inedible for these Italian palettes  from NY!\\n\\nThe second dish was the open faced turkey plate with a side of mash potatoes and stuffing. The turkey was fresh and good but it was served on white bread that was not toasted which turned soggy with overload of gravy on top. The mash was a good consistency and taste but the stuffing was overly sweet with the addition of too many raisins!\\n\\nMoving on, the last dish was my Taco salad which was good, but would have really rocked if they served it in a deep fried taco shell instead of a grilled tortilla which laid limp underneath all the ingredients. Also I would have  appreciated less corn and more chili! \\n\\nWe decided to just see what desserts we had a choice of before we realized how full we were.

However, I was kind of confused at how they said they had sushi, but the menu did not say anything about it. Turns out, they had a separate sushi menu that they forgot to hand out. Yeah, service is a bit of a gray spot.\\n\\nMy biggest problem was their selection. There were some interesting dishes, but I wish they had a more authentic array of dishes, and a more diverse one as well. They included foods such as noodles, sushi, and even some americanized foods such as chicken tenders. However, I walked in expecting an authentic Japanese experience but it ended up feeling just like a regular steakhouse.\\n\\nI ordered chicken curry with rice, and it tasted fine but nothing extrordinary. Kind of expensive for what it was though, and I kind of wish that the curry was already on the rice, but that I had to do manually. The taste was very sweet but the dish was not very dynamic. Good presentation though.\\n\\nOverall, the decorations are very welcoming and there really is nothing to complain about.\\n\\nMy final consensus: If you are looking for an authentic experience, I would not reccomend eating at this place.

It's located off of Far West, so you don't have to deal with the increasing headache of fighting downtown traffic and parking.\\nThe ambiance and decor is by far my favorite in Austin. It has an old, Japanese inspired interior that is beautiful and cozy, so enjoyable and pleasing to the eye you will want your dinner to last for hours. Perfect for a nice date night. \\nThe food is just incredible, very traditional (or more so than most other sushi joints). The have a very large assortment of sushi and sashimi. They offer nigiri dressed in all sorts of ways, like the samarai salmon, with thai peppers, or hamachi with jalapeno. You can't find that at most places in Austin. They have every type of sushi for a true sushi fanatic, from Ankimo to Uni, Aji and Baby Yellowtail. Everything is incredibly fresh and delicious. Rolls include traditional style to their house specialty's. Another wondeful feature they have is black rice infused with squid ink, definitely worth trying. It has a different flavor than regular sushi rice, and they pair it well in their rolls. My favorite roll with this rice is the Black Widow, with soft shell crab and habenero masago. If you want something from the kitchen try the lobster tempura, it is legit! It is basically a whole lobster tail cut up and tempura fried, so succulent with the perfect amount of tempura coating. For dessert, I always get mochi because they are one of the few places in town that has good mochi, I am almost positive they get it from Bubbies (I think that's the name) in Hawaii. Most places just have the cheap, freezer-burned mochi not worth ordering. I could go on and on and on about how amazing their food/sushi is, but you should try it for yourself!

We shared dishes, and generally found portions to be generous for a decent price point. We ordered deep fried squid and the fried fishcake, Kagoshima style, as appetizers. To follow, we had set lunches and bowls of ramen. \\n\\nThe deep fried squid was very nicely done. It was crisp and tender, without being greasy. Mayo and siracha sauce was drizzled over the dish with a light hand. It was TASTY! \\n\\nThe deep fried fish cake, kagoshima style was a disappointment. This tasted like a fish cake that had simply been sliced up and thrown onto a plate, then doused in a citrus sauce. \\n\\nYuu's set lunches are very good value for the money. With an entree, you get a drink of your choice (a BIG drink) and a starter. We decided on the set with tonkatsu ramen. These noodles were well done, however the stock was lacking depth in it's flavour. The appetizer that came with this set was a potato croquette. The sauce had been added with a heavy hand, but it was a decent croquette. \\n\\nNext up, we had the spicy tomato seafood ramen. To be completely frank, this didn't turn my crank. The broth was very tomatoey, though it had faint undertones of pumpkin. Although these undertones were not overwhelming, if you aren't a fan, you most likely will not like this dish. The cooks were extremely generous with the seafood in this dish, with whole scallops, mussels and prawns. All in all, this dish may not be the ideal bowl of ramen for an individual who isn't very adventurous, or a traditionalist ramen enthusiast. \\n\\nAnother dish that may not be a good choice for a traditionalist is the black pepper garlic beef ramen. Right off the bat, the smell of garlic smacked me in the face! This dish was EXTREMELY garlicky, to the point of being overwhelming. The beef in this dish was beautifully done, bursting with flavour and tender. The amount of meat was very generous. I feel that this dish would be an acquired taste; something you either love or hate. \\n\\nFinally, the highlight of our meal, the chicken teriyaki rice bowl. Sometimes there is beauty in simplicity! This dish was absolutely stunning in the way that it was cooked and in it's presentation. The chicken was layered onto rice with just the right amount of sauce; enough that it was covering the rice and chicken, but not so much that the dish was drowning in it. The chicken was juicy, tender and flavourful, with the lovely crisp skin. If you are ever at Yuu, I highly recommend that you choose this dish! \\n\\nOverall, we enjoyed our visit to Yuu, and we will probably be back.

It was really heavy - and yummy, but I was looking for something light.  Weird to name it a salad.\\n- Other food I've had has been... bad.  My latest bean/quinoa/kale bowl tasted like liquid smoke.  Seriously, I don't know if they burned out the water in their steamer, or if it was purposeful, but it was gross. \\n- The only juice I've ordered here was meh - the apple, ginger, lemon - which tasted like apple with celery and maybe a tiny hint of ginger.

It has been difficult to find an authentic tasting sprtiz, negroni, bellini, etc.  This place pulls it off with many incredible drinks made with Campari, Aperol, and many other ingredients that aren't typically found in the states (even at Italian places).  These drinks are hugely popular in Italy, so I was amazed that it's so hard to find here.  This place serves incredible, authentic drinks; even grappa!!!  \\n\\nThe food is also incredibly delicious and and made with authentic ingredients.  I highly recommend the charcuterie board!!  It's the best I've had in town.  The panini's are excellent, especially for the price (around $4).  You can eat very cheaply, but the drinks are a bit more expensive.  They're worth it though if you appreciate quality and aren't just looking to get sloshed for nothing (that's what dive bars are for).  If you like real Italian drinks and incredible food, you'll love this place.  Don't come here expecting pasta and pizza, there are a lot of other places in Portland for that.  Great Italian sandwiches, small plates, incredible drinks, and wine list.  Very attentive and friendly service.  The ambiance is very nice and I really enjoyed the massive television showing Italian movies which only added to the authentic feel of the place.  Perfect for the European at heart!"},{"name":"Island Fin Poke Company","address":"1450 Tuskawilla Rd","city":"Winter Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"Disappointed.

We wanted to try the beer that they brewed at the brewery. I had seen the little area where they grow hops while walking around the neighborhood and thought that was pretty cool. I got the cherry IPA and it was fine. My husband didn't particularly like his lager. \\n\\nI'm never much of a fan of a huge beer selection. These places with a million rotating draft beers and the TV screens listing the beers always seem to be more expensive. Here, beers were $5.50 to $7.00, even during happy hour. Whereas it seems that the going price around town is $4 to $5 for a happy hour draft. I'd prefer to have 10 good beers to choose from at good prices than 55 more expensive choices which may be good or may not be.\\n\\nI got the $3 chips and salsa. The chips seemed to be just from a bag. They didn't seem very fresh. My husband got the happy hour pasta. That was the definite highlight of our trip to Green Dragon. The pasta was very good. \\n\\nAs a final note, I wasn't much of a fan of the decor. I love relaxed atmospheres and kitsch decorations but the dissembled manikin creeped me out.

Really surprised to find such authentic flavors in Orlando since had a pretty bad sushi experience years before. We ordered pork katsu kare (deep fried pork cutlet breaded in panko served with Japanese style curry and rice), grilled ginger pork salad, and one piece each of sake (salmon) and tamago (egg) nigiri. \\n\\nPork katsu kare (curry): 4/5\\nPork katsu was crispy and not soaking with grease. Curry was thick and tasty. Rice was on point! Each granule was distinct from other granules, yet sticky enough to stay together, with just the right amount of chew. So delicious! My only complaint is that the pork meat itself was a bit dry, and they didn't provide the red pickles (fukujinzuke) that always accompanies katsu kare. Nevertheless, very delicious. Comes with a side of salad that was very good as well.\\n\\nGrilled Ginger pork salad: 4/5\\nGinger pork was seasoned well and tasty. It wasn't too too dry for the cut of pork used (super thin), but I would probably prefer a little corn starch on the outside to trap some moisture in, but that's just me being a naggy backseat chef again.\\n\\nSalad was fresh (comes with iceberg, carrots, and tomatoes). I would have preferred some cucumbers and MORE greens, but everything was tasty. The salad came with a goma (sesame) dressing and a soy garlic based dressing. Definite preferred the goma dressing more, although I think my favorite was the ginger dressing that comes with the side salad\\n\\nTamago nirgiri: 4/5\\nTamago was flavorful and sweet. The portion was generous and the egg was soft and moist. Yum! Again the rice was on point. \\n\\nSake nigiri: 2.5/5\\nThis was probably the most disappointing item in our order. Salmon itself was fishy, not a sign of freshness. I was glad we didn't order any other fish to try.\\n\\nOverall a great find. The waiters and sushi chefs all dressed in traditional kimonos, which definitely added to the dining experience. Staff were all Japanese as well, major brownie points. Would definitely recommend to anyone in the area looking for good authentic Japanese food!"},{"name":"JazzTastings","address":"164 Lake Ave","city":"Maitland","stars":"4","text":"I consider myself a good reviewer of the grand majority of places I've visited, and I've traveled all across North America and savored the many cuisines. Thus saying, I am a great lover of food and even more importantly; I love having dinner parties. Jazz Tastings was a place I wanted to try in Central Florida since earlier this year, so when a Yelp deal came along, Bry and I jumped at the opportunity to go and we wore our dancing shoes. \\n\\nThree things really stood out to me. First, I'd placed a reservation on Yelp for their only seating at 8pm- even though we left out early, around 6pmish- we decided we would savor Maitland. At 6:30 pm we arrived at Jazz Tastings and it was empty except for two tables by the bar area- if you were to trip over the doorway you'd fall onto someone's table. Perhaps an expansion is in the works, thus saying, no dancing at Jazz Tastings.\\n\\nSecondly, we booked a reservation through Yelp which is a reputable site and a user friendly site- I love that we can share our adventures with each other. The bartender states, \\"We never book reservations through Yelp- we don't book through Yelp\\" while he's looking for our names on a list at the bar. When I show him the e-mail confirmation and the site, he says, \\"let me make a phone call\\". After this call he tells me that they don't book through Yelp and by the time I booked the confirmation, they were filled by 2 pm. \\n\\nMeanwhile the Manager who was polishing the glasses never apologized and kept doing what she was doing. We were notified by the bartender that we could sit at the bar. Bry wanted to order the Kobe Beef Sliders and the Steak Bruschetta- I liked the chips that came with the sliders and Bry liked the sliders, which he said to the manager and she said nothing.\\nWe both agreed that the Bruschetta wasn't anything to brag about- the cut of meat was tender and juicy, as it was a filet but overwhelmingly fell short because of the balsamic, very sweet and abundant.\\n\\nLastly, we love wine and we have some popular favorites. Their wine list is very extensive yet did not include 3 major players but the bartender was more than happy to give us a tasting of some of their populars, which I really liked yet I read on the menu that Wednesday and Thursdays were happy hour which again wasn't honored at all. At the bottom of the menu it states that to dine, you MUST spend $15 per person per table. \\n\\nJazz Tastings fell very short and I felt as though the business was only about the business financial portion of running an establishment. Loaded tables, over priced TAPAS and not honoring their own happy hour. After 2 Tapas, 2 drinks and no jazz we decided it was time to go. They did honor the Yelp deal, surprisingly they were happy to take our money. Overall not a place I'd return to nor recommend and I'm a big lover of jazz, I honestly wanted to enjoy the experience."},{"name":"China Palace","address":"6605 Airport Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This is the first time I've ordered Chinese delivery and not been disappointed.

A 'platter' of food is definitely share-able, especially if you're indulging in the biscuits or any other appetizer. Although leftovers are good too, so maybe on second thought, invest in your own platter. They have a small draft beer list, however it is usually very good. It has two or three crafts beers and often a local beer or two. As for the biscuits, the menu reads that they come in a basket of four, but you can actually order them individually. However, my bf and I did not know this and ordered the basket of four last time we went and took the other two home for breakfast the next day, so it turned on not only to not be a mistake, but really a wonderful idea.

Gorgeous interior full of reclaimed wood and the neighborhood vibe that can't be beat. Only reason I give it 4 stars is because the espresso drinks are made with Hairbender which is extraordinarily acidic and always makes me sick, and therefore I'm relegated to the drip coffee.  I'd love to be able to have an espresso and hope they consider alternating their offerings so those who want a cappuccino or a mocha can have a less acidic option!  Other than that, it's terrific.

It's confusing that you get waited on, but have to pick up your own water. I felt like an idiot walking across the restaurant getting my water because no one told me.
