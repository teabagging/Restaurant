I hired National Carpet Care to clean my carpet since I was moving. The tech, Sam, showed up with a machine that I could have rented from Publix. He charged by credit card before the service was provided and repeatedly told me that he cannot guarantee stain removal. He took an hour to clean 2 rooms, a stair case, and hallway. The carpet looked exactly as it did before he started. Dark stains were not a shade lighter. The tech kept emphasizing that urine does not come off of carpet and it was not possible to remove the stains. I was not pleased because I knew at that point that I would not get my security deposit back. However, I signed for the service because I was moving out and did not have the time to argue and  make a fuss. The next day I returned to the apartment with a $7 Oxy product from Target. I got on my hands and knees and scrubbed the stains for 2 hours. The stains were 80% lighter at this point. This is when I realized that this tech did not do his job.I paid extra for \\"corrective\\" treatment, yet the stains were untouched and the carpet was not visibly cleaner. The tech was also supposed to instruct us to turn on the AC and fans to properly ventilate the carpets. He did not. Now the place smells musky and we may be facing water damage. I called the office the next day and complained about the service, exlpaining what I was able to accomplish on my own. Cindy was not sympathetic and kept repeating to me that stain removal is not guaranteed. Finally, once I threatened to dispute the charge with my credit card, she said she would send another tech over the next day. This tech arrived at the location and called me to say that he couldn't do anything because the power and water had been turned off (I am now being told by reputable carpet cleaners that they should have been able to plan and work around this). He said he could not re-clean the carpets but suggested I pay for an odor treatment. I asked if I could get this service for free since he was unable to assist me with the carpet cleaning. He said he could not because I turned down this service the first time. He went on to say that they are a business and could not give me a service for free. I don't see how I was getting anything for free. At that point, I was a disgruntled customer, but the technician did not care. I asked him to have the office, AKA Cindy call me back. She did not. I called her and Asked her why she did not call me. She said it was because the tech told me everything I needed to know and there was nothing more to tell me. She told me she could not do anything for me and said if I wanted to, I could call the manager the next day. I am now hiring another carpet cleaning company to do the job this company should have provided in the first place. I am not only dissatisfied with the quality of work, but even more dissatisfied with the customer service. I don't know how these techs, office workers, and managers are able to sleep at night knowing they are hurting people. The company I hired to clean up the mess said that this is the 4th job this year they have been hired to perform because National Carpet Care did more harm than help. I will make it my job to blast this company for what they have done. They will not get my money because I am disputing the charge."},{"name":"Lupo","address":"869 Hamilton Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"Great food, a little pricey for the portion sizes.

The fish was pale, tasteless, and the rice I think was the standard cooked rice they use on their teriyaki.  The rolls were haphazard, each one off-center and some opening on their own.

And the drink selection is not the same at these three different points of sale. Many of the beers were tapped out at the main ordering line, so I had to wait in a second line anyway to order drinks. The main menu was hard to read until you got to the cash register, so it took extra-long to order. There were some laminated hand-held menus at the front of the line, but were hard to locate, even when asking the cashier. If long lines are common here - a handy stash of menus near the door should be a no-brainer! As well as some signage indicating where you can order from, or what the system is.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the food came out pretty quickly considering how busy it was, and was a pretty good meal for the price. The fries were crispy and delicious, and the large serving is HUGE (and perfect for sharing with a table). Some seating configuration seems odd and too snug (considering the servers walk all over the restaurant to find the party for each meal). We were constantly bumping into each other just while seated at the bar, let alone getting up from our seats and hitting neighbors behind us.

The kitchen was backed up so every table had to wait at least an hour to receive their food. Some tables couldn't even wait and just left. It was ridiculous. All I ordered was eggs, homefries and sausage. It shouldn't take an hour to fry these things up. By the time I received my food I was starving. All I got from the staff was a cheery apology from the waitress. The manager didn't even bother to personally apologize to anyone. That speaks volumes to their standard of professionalism.

They were generally dry and difficult to eat. I thought that was a glaring weakness. \\n\\nThe sides were generally good. The stuffing had some \\"nasty\\" bits like gibbet and liver, but it wasn't too obtrusive and tasted good. The collard greens were smokey and flavorful: probably my favorite of the sides. The mac n' cheese was in abundance but could have used more flavor. \\n\\nOne drawback that was frustrating was the unannounced closings of the restaurant. My success rate in securing dinner here was less than 50%. You had to call ahead to see if they were open or not.

The hostess led us back into an open patio area and parked us by the fence with a number and said someone would come take our drink order. We waited for about 45 minutes and were seated at a table before anyone came to take our drink order.\\n\\nBut it's okay, our waitress took our orders. I got a Mr. Shaw, comprised of green tea liqueur, rye whiskey, honey, and lemon. I thought it would taste like a John Daly, but it was stronger and less sweet.\\n\\nWe asked for our food to come whenever it was ready, because we ordered a lot of food and we don't care much about order. But every single dish came out at the same time. Impressive. Here's what we got:\\n\\nTriple fried duck fat fries, with a 110 minute egg and cold b√©arnaise ($7). There was a lot of hype about these fries, and god were they were delicious. The egg was perfect and added so much to these otherwise greasy fries. They were best when hot. Don't let them cool and congeal; they aren't as good afterwards. They are really, really good when hot.\\n\\nTruffled deviled eggs, with bacon bits and chives ($6). HANDS DOWN the best deviled eggs I've ever had IN MY LIFE. So truffley and delicious. 4 come on a plate, but I could have eaten just deviled eggs for my meal and been so, so delighted with my life. The best item we had for dinner.\\n\\nCrispy brussels sprout leaves, with golden raisins and Pecorino ($6). These were very, very good as well. A little oily, but very tasty. We cleared the plate in under two minutes. That's how good they were.\\n\\nPork tenderloin medallions, with spaetzle, bacon lards, pearl onions, spinach, mushrooms, pickles, and mustard jus ($19). This was probably my least favorite part of the meal. Not because it was bad, but because it wasn't spectacular like everything else. The pork wasn't super flavorful, and it just felt like a simple pot roast or stew that I could probably make myself. Tasty, but not spectacular like every other dish. \\n\\nPork butt, which I can't find on the menu, which makes me super sad ($?). This was the second best thing that we ate. It fell apart the second that we touched it with the fork, and it was so packed with flavor and delicious and wonderful that it should be on the menu full time.

I was hesitant to try it because my daughter had been there their first week and was charged for a drink that her waitress had accidentally spilled all over her. But, I figured service issues would iron out. The drinks were good as well as the appetizers, but everyone was underwhelmed by their entrees and one person had to send their burger back twice for not being properly cooked. But, as the management handled it diligently and even comped the meal I thought I would try their brunch. After being seated for more than 10 minutes without acknowledgment from the waitstaff, another couple sat down at the table next to mine finally bringing the waitress over. After finally being given water and having our order taken (after the other couple) we waited more than half an hour for two orders of eggs benedict and at no point did anyone stop by the table to check in. In this time another table got sick of waiting for their food and left and another table waiting for their surprise birthday cake, which they waited for at least 15 minutes for, had to speak to the management before it finally arrived. I spoke to management and was initially blown off. When I was ready to leave the food came, just in time for the people seated next to us to be finished with their meals. Both of our eggs were overcooked and might as well have been hard boiled, and they also came with very little hollandaise. The salads were not dressed, nor was salad or condiments supplied. The homefries were okay, but slightly over salted. I had to send mine back as it was inedible. The manager came over to the table to apologize and comp the meal, but ultimately spent more time defending the restaurant than acknowledging the problems (even after we pointed out it wasn't just our table and this wasn't our first bad experience).

A nod to a yelp review of one star -- I must admit that I was disappointed in watching the two cooks turn out the food while seated at the bar by the boiling pasta water steam. Use of their cell phones during a lull, use of tongs to move food and pans alike, use of hands to add cheese after touching their face or phone -- perhaps not the most appetizing thing to see. One would expect an open-view kitchen to be a bit more conscientious of more hygienic practices. If the presentation of food is important, then should not the presentation of the cook also key? \\n\\nBut the food here is the reason for the four stars. Get the very large $12 baby eggplant appetizer as a meal - it tickles the tastebuds and promptly silences hunger. All around an oven baked plate having a good balance between veg, deep-fried coating, sauce, & cheese. NICE.  The $18 entre Gnocchi al Forno that followed, however, couldn't compare. The size would feed four, true. And after it cooled to eating temperatures, it wasn't bad. It just wasn't excellent. A bit heavy on the garlic and cheese, the sauce a bit raw, and the gnocchi seemed weighty instead of light and pillowy. The $8 house salad served in a Panera-like big bowl is tasty.

And I have no issues with the whole Mongolian BBQ concept-- one of my favorite places to go when I was skipping school back East was an authentic Mongolian BBQ joint. This place blows. It's like the owners of Fresh Choice got together with some Asians and spawned something about as attractive as a bearded lady with flippers.\\n\\nDo-It-Yourself: F\\nBasically, you pile as much raw meat and vegetables into your bowl as possible to get as much bang for your $10.00 buck. It's like a stupid self-gratifying ritual for the otherwise I-suck-at-lifers. The raw bar was sloppy, with different vegetables intermingling and a very sad display of shriveled fried tofu. The meat is sliced frozen, which is normal for Mongolian, but this place let the meat sit in a sad puddle of water that begged mosquitos to land upon it. And then came the noodle bar. Along with the traditional bean thread noodles (Thank God) there was a collection of ziti, fat egg noodles, and linguini. Immediately the words DOES NOT COMPUTE flashed across my eyes. Clearly this was an eating establishment for carbohydrate addicts, and those in search of an authentic Asian dining experience need not apply. I was almost too dizzy with repulsion to continue, but I made my way to the sauce bar. Here I had to stop and read the instructions for about thirty different sauce combinations. It was more stressful than taking the SATs. And for some odd reason, the sauce bar also contained a vat of imitation crab and sliced sausages.

Meat isn't cheap, lamb is what? about $6/lb, not to mention, labor, spices, dairy, veggies, overhead etc, do you want them to give you the \\"ok\\" food for free? Even \\"crap\\" food has a cost.\\n\\nLocation, it's close to 75 on Windy Hill, and easy to get to, plenty of parking and never crowded (both are signs to turn around and go somewhere else, in my book).

Halal Meat and Alcohol just don't mix, at least not in my world, so I would prefer to have my shrimp alfredo at olive garden and not sit by the bar, then come here and eat their less than average food (although the prices are really REALLY cheap) to sit and stare at alcohol being served near by.\\n\\nHowever, if you don't care about the alcohol, and you're not used to Desi food, if you're just trying something new, or if you aren't Desi, or you're not really familiar with Indian/Pakistani food, this is a great place to start. If you're searching all around Atlanta for a good Desi restaurant (honestly, you might need to search outside Georgia for that, search further north, or further west toward Dallas,TX) this place is just \\"ok\\", and because it's cheap, it make \\"ok\\" food a little better. Otherwise, this might not be appropriate, but I really like the food at Karachi Grill (the owner of Lahore Grill is the brother of the owner of Karachi Grill) in Gwinnett County on Jimmy Carter Blvd. Don't go there for environment, they just have some really decent grilled meats, great hamburgers, sandwiches, and tandoori.

Absolutely on par with the hype; the biscuit-style dumplings and velvety light gravy are the definition of nostalgia in a bite. \\n\\nThe cocktail program here is consistently on point. Adding pear to a Moscow Mule, for instance, doesn't come across as frivolous. Every drink is made like the bartender would want to have one. Seems so simple, but surprisingly rare in this town. \\n\\nAmbiance is among the best in town. No other restaurant embraces the unspoken Austin attitude of \\"blue jeans welcome\\" so effortlessly. \\n\\nI've seen some relatively weak stuff come out of the kitchen. As a professional cook, I could tell that there were lax chef/expos in the past that have let some old cilantro purees and salty fried business slide. On my recent and last few visits though, there haven't been egregious issues. \\n\\nFood points for my recent visit:\\n\\n-Broccoli with potato pur√©e: nicely charred broccoli, potato pur√©e wasn't over whipped so had an awesome melty texture. Could have used more snap but the potato chips were a nice textural touch. \\n-Cauliflower gratin was solid, all the veg cooked thoroughly without getting too sulphur-y. Don't know why balsamic was the vinegar of choice, didn't have the zing of some other possibilities and added a weird sweetness angle as a sauce. Salty with the parm/whatever hard cheese it was so the overall effect was good though. \\n-Grilled cheese and fries. Damn. I had it once from the old pastry chef and it was awful. Dry brioche shouldn't be a thing, but I had it here a few years ago. Now that they have my fave Austin bread/sweets man on board it's off the hook. Major points for the near pound of sharp cheddar they melted on this one for sure. \\n-Pea salad was on the lower end. Felt healthy as there was little to no fat on the peas that comprised most of the dish. The egg we got was nearly underdone, so trying to mix in the yolk to dress came with that unsettling watery egg white. Not a deal breaker, but if I were doing it at home I'd have opted for some softer cheese crumble to get a little extra creaminess in there. \\n\\nDessert Dessert Dessert. Get both of the options every time. This guy doesn't mess around. Every dish is so balanced in texture and tart/sweet that it could be a main course. He should be the buzzy pastry chef about town, but probably all the better that he just cranks em out regardless. \\n\\nI've had the charcuterie before, hits and misses but you've gotta give props to a place that's willing to take whole pigs and do their damnedest. Probably closer to an \\"authentic\\" charcuterie experience in that regard; every time they just try to make it better, but it'll never be exactly the same twice. \\n\\nThanks again Contigo.

I figured that with its cheapest gyro on the block, Small Pharaoh's would be a good bet. I didn't count on it being so good, though!\\n\\nRather than dry, chewy strips of meat like at some gyro joints, the chunks of lamb in my gyro were tender and juicy. Plentiful, too. It's certified as halal and listed as kosher, though from what a friend who keeps kosher tells me, the white sauce is a good indicator that while the meat may be sourced from a kosher butcher, the cart is not kosher, itself. It doesn't bother me either way, I think it's delicious. I was also impressed with how fresh the lettuce and tomato tasted. Rarely do I find that either add much to a sandwich, but here, both complimented it nicely. The cook put two sauces on my gyro, one spicy and one creamy. I found myself wishing for more of both, as they were both nice. Not that I want it to be soggy, but I know that it could've absorbed more easily and been even better. The bread was a little bland, which was a bit of a bummer. Nicely grilled pita can really tie a gyro together, and given how good the filling was, I know that with just a slight improvement in bread, Small Pharaoh's gyro could be truly amazing. Still, though, it's not bad bread, and between it and the expertly-wrapped foil, it held together very well, despite being so packed with tasty ingredients.\\n\\nAll of this was had for $5. There are other places in Portland that charge $6 to $8 for a smaller gyro of lower quality. Keep this in mind when you're looking for cheap eats downtown.\\n\\nI like how Small Pharaoh's provides plenty of seating space on its counter, too. Not every foodcart does this, and especially when the city doesn't seem intent on maintaining the cleanliness of its nearby benches, having a nice place to sit down is a godsend. Small Pharaoh's keeps their chairs and counter immaculately clean, making the cart all the more inviting. They didn't have napkins when I was there, though, so try to eat neatly.\\n\\nApparently, Small Pharaoh's is a 24/7 joint. That's rare for anywhere in Portland, let alone a foodcart. I think that a gyro from here would be truly incredible post-bar food. Downtown revelers, take note.\\n\\nSmall Pharaoh's makes a good product for cheap, and serves it in large quantities.

These culminating factors make for an easy decision, our inaugural visit to Corner Caf√©.\\n\\nAs our mangy threesome entered the establishment we gave a friendly WUD UP? to the patrons at the bar. At this point one of the 3, seemingly deep in conversation, returned to the business side of the slab. It was the bartender \\"Ray\\", a good ole chap, immediately inquired what we fancied to drink. \\"Bud bottles\\" we unwittingly replied, not realizing they obviously had cheaper cans. Beers were delivered frosty, with a smile. Ray went back to conversing with the homely couple at the bar and we were left to sip suds while watching my degenerate friend loose a measly $25 dollars on the Packers/Saints NFL opener. The excitement of my pal's misery quickly stirred up my appetite so I beckoned Ray back over to describe the specials. \\"Well\\" he says, \\"I can cook you some chicken fingers or motzi sticks...\\". Although he was willing, I declined and he gave me the menu, a takeout slip from Dino's! This was perfect so I wasted no time dialing in a large steak bomb. \\n\\nBy the time I was through half of the monstrous submarine we were ready to call it a night. Ray had fulfilled our needs as a friendly bartender, lifting the spirits of 3 pathetic lads, when, what's this? Two Hot Babes*!!!... Walking in the door.

Unless you're afraid of spicy hot food, then get it on the side, but at least try it.\\n\\nIn an effort to be honest I will say that the Shyamosa (a honkin' huge pair of samosas) is a little on the bland side.  I would love if they would provide a little more flavor, or maybe a variety of dipping sauces to accompany in order to make them a little more satisfying as an entree.  They're a formidable side dish, so maybe if they offered an entree version that added some sauces and a choice of protein to go with/over it, like an Indian Samosa Chaat... Shyamosa Deluxe maybe?

But for the price, it's a steal. The taste doesn't seem different either. I loved their naan. \\n\\nOf course, like all Indian food, the food feels greasy and heavy. Even though it's a buffet, I don't think I can get more than 1 plate of food. I can try, but it won't be pretty. \\n\\nIn their non-buffet room, they have some pool tables. Their pool hall looks interesting because there are no chairs. Instead, they have raised platforms for people to sit on... perhaps Indian style. Anyway, that rooms makes it look like they throw some mean Indian parties during the weekends. \\n\\nI think it's not a bad place for lunch Indian buffet if you're in the area."},{"name":"The Rose","address":"111 SW Ash St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Had a Gatsby themed birthday party at The Rose on 5/11 and was extremely impressed!

Better than Snows of Lexington, Texas. However, this beautiful bovine fell short of the almighty Franklins. I would not place La Barbecue in the same category at Franklins. As Franklins is truly a divine gift from God. But let's get away from political aspect of the BBQ and let's get the facts of strictly La Barbecue. \\n\\nThe brisket had a nice bark. The brisket was also kissed just with the oh so perfect amount of smoke. Like most barbecue places, they let you decide if you would rather have the point or the flat. Something I typically do not talk about is sausage, however in this case I'll make the exception. The sausage is made in house and is not too dry and not too greasy and had a nice little kick to it. Once you swallow the sausage a nice little flame of heat comes with it. The little spice is subtle enough to not be overpowering but strong enough to know its there. They also offer homemade spicy dill pickles. A fellow barbecue guro I met at the La Barbecue let me try some of the pickles. They were rather good and for only $2 extra I would have bought them if I had known how well they were prepared. The sides are nothing to go for. \\n\\nNext, is the setting. If you are a fan of nice elegant seating and air condition, then this may not be the place for you. It is out of a food truck so don't expect any elegance out of La Barbecue, although the name may portray otherwise. \\n\\nOverall, the experience was pretty good. We arrived at 10:20 and received out food by 11:40. Not a bad wait at all for one of the best places in Texas. I would return for the Brisket and Sausage. I rate the entire experience as a 8.5/10. Pretty awesome defiantly worth a trip. The brisket was elegantly designed and beautifully mastered.

There were a very long line when we got there at noon so we got in line and someone told us that they offer free beer from a keg so why not drink. After waiting for 20min, they stop the line people at the end for lining up. Dam only 1 1/2 hr before they were going sell whatever they have- I was super impress!!!we had fun in line meeting new people and drinking with them. When we almost got up to the widow they were all sold out from the beef ribs, pork ribs so we got super disappointed so we the brisket sandwich,sausage link, beans and 4 piece of white bread and of course we drink more free beers. First bite of the brisket and it was freaky amazing!! Super moist, juicy, tender and enough fat to meat combination. U can see the smoke rings on the meats. The link was super tasty and have a shape bite to it. I have to say this was the best BBQ that I had in my entire life and nothing even came close to it. I haven't try Franklin or salt link yet but I can't deny how delicious it was and people who I met during the line say the se thing. The standard for BBQ just got raise to the NEXT level!!!

The only reason I gave this place one star is because there isn't an option for no stars, and some of the food was decent but i couldn't get this \\"bad taste\\" out of my mouth... Shall I elaborate? \\n\\nOur reservation was for 8:00 on saturday night and we showed up a little early and pretty much got seated right away.. we looked over the menu and waited for our waiter to come by and take our drink orders.. we waited.. and waited.. and waited.. to the point that we discussed just walking out.. The only reason we stayed is because we had a groupon and it was going to expire.. We noticed that there seemed to be only one server, one \\"bus boy/server in training\\" (who's tasks included bringing tables bread, of which we had none, lighting candles, and clearing dishes as though he was in an \\"all time slow ass\\" competition), and the owner, who was busy being toolish and doing bad bottle tricks behind the bar..  \\n\\nAfter we we're there about 20min without anyone so much as acknowledging our presence, I flagged down the \\"bus boy\\" guy and asked to to grab our waiter so we could at least get a drink order in.  He looked as though if he had a tail, it would have been deep between his legs.. poor lil' guy.. \\n\\nThen the waiter came by and acted as though we had just walked in, even though it felt like i had already carved my very own butt print in the damn booth, i asked if they were short staffed and he said that they were and since the groupon was expiring soon, they we're really busy..\\n\\nRiiiiight.... so the why the F*ck is tweedle dee (bus boy/server in training) and tweedle DUMBEST (owner) not chipping in on the load? HELLO? It did seem like a lot for one server, but give me a break. I felt like telling the owner who was \\"busy\\" lighting candles, to put down the damn matches unless he planed on lighting a fire under his own ass.. \\n\\nSo, since we had all had AMPLE time to look over the menu at that point, I put my whole order in, A split of Veuve with our salad, and a glass of pinot with the rack of lamb. Then he took my boyfriends drink order and skipped right to our friend who ordered a cocktail and an app. When she asked what kind of vodka they had, he grunted and said that he was in a hurry and it would be easier if she just knew what she wanted. I almost laughed, it was so rude. Then my boyfriend had to catch him to put in his entree order before he ran off..  \\n\\nThe waiter came back to inform me that they were out of veuve and they only had one split left, (which was $35, as opposed to $9 for the veuve). \\"Fine\\" I said, and he poured it and left. (we still had no bread at this point). A good 10 more min went by and our dining companion's cocktail hadn't arrived, though the bread and our salad had (the waiter said he would put a rush on our food). So, again, I flagged down the \\"bus boy\\" and asked him to check on our friends drink order. He said he would, and about 10 min later we saw the drink, a complicated cocktail of vodka, soda, and lemon, sitting up on the bar. It had been there for quite a while, and our friend was frustrated to the point that she considered just getting it herself, when someone finally brought it to her.\\n\\nIt was also around this time that I noticed we weren't the only pissed off patrons, and a new couple had just been seated at a table in the sun room/patio area. I felt bad for them...\\n\\nBy this time my boyfriend and I had finished our spinach salad which was mediocre at best. The \\"walnuts\\" described on the menu looked as though they were the crumbles from the bottom of a bag, and the overly garnished plate seem quite unnecessary during a time when order volume was far exceeding the kitchens abilities to pump food out.. \\n\\nwhen I finished my champagne, the dog boy brought out my glass of pinot, which i thought meant the rest of our food would arrive soon, since I ordered the red with my lamb. Duh. About 30 min passed when I saw the owner come out of the kitchen with a couple plates (one of which was a rack of lamb), and head in our direction. I almost shouted \\"hallelujah!\\" when he breezed right by our table and serve the couple who had been seated around the time when we were finising our salad 30 min earlier.. WTF?! I stopped him on the way back into the kitchen (apparently at some point between being a douche bag and lighting candles he figured out that maybe he should lend a hand), and asked him why our food was taking so long when he had just served a table that had been seated LONG after we had. \\"You're next\\" was all he had to say. No \\"i'm sorry for the delay\\", or \\"please forgive me for running a embarrassingly inefficient restaurant\\", or \\"you'll have to excuse me, it's been a long day for dumb asses everywhere\\"..    \\n\\nWhen our food came, over 90min later, it was ok. The lamb was good, but the potatoes were vinegary, and the grilled zucchini was lack lustre/not seasoned.

Your food is served on a large plate, artfully arranged on a large piece of sourdough flatbread called injera. You're also given additional pieces of injera which you use to scoop up the food for hand to mouth consumption. My coworker and I ordered the combination platter with spicy chicken and veggies (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j9eXDcNsxaz9I3_rGyDv_w?select=POZ2umANF_FugUgvJQ06YQ). The first thing I noticed was the rolls of injera lining the plate. That was a nice touch considering all the ripping you have to do before each bite. I've been to a place where you're given pancake-style injera, and it takes forever to rip an adequately sized square. If you ask for more injera, they'll give you a heaping basket of more injera rolls. Win!!! The chicken was absolutely mouthwateringly tender, but you only receive one microscopic drumstick per person. They also serve a whole hard-boiled egg, collard greens, chickpeas, beets, and other veggies, each with a very distinct taste. \\n\\nService: If you've never had Ethiopian, a server will come out and demonstrate proper scooping technique. Other than that, our service was fair. \\n\\nAtmosphere: There are several irritating aspects to this place. First off, the music is super loud and the CD player seems to skip frequently. Secondly, the bright track lighting aims straight at certain tables, blinding customers. We saw a group switch tables because of this. Despite the annoyances, the interior is pretty fun with paintings for sale on the brightly colored walls.

I waited about a week after the first opening, because I did not want to wait in that ridiculously long line. Once I did go the line was still long, but the efficiency that they had was unbelievable-- I was super impressed.

Just bring some board games and maybe even sneak in some of your own beer because the wait will kill you. DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU ARE HUNGRY.\\n\\nTypical experience here: Slow and understaffed service. Make sure I have a book to read or cards to play with. Order food and beer as soon as I sit down because they won't come check on you later. It's typical for them to forget some of your food so go wild and order a lot! Expect a beer 15 minutes later and pizza 45-60 later.\\n\\nLast Monday's experience: I came in with my boyfriend around 7. There were empty seats which there usually are so we sat down. After about 20 minutes our server came over and asked us if we knew what we wanted. This is without ever having brought us a menu. Luckily we come prepared and order our pizza and beer immediately without needing to look at a menu. After about 30 minutes I got up and asked the server for our beers. She ignored me, twice. The guy making the pizza brought us our beer after 45 minutes as we were getting up to leave. (someone like him needs to serve here!) Pizza came an hour and a half after we ordered it. Delicious, yes? Usually worth the wait? Yes. Worth the wait this time? Ha! No way.\\n\\nSo here's my complaint. The restaurant clearly doesn't care about their employees. Relying on only 2 people to cook and serve an entire restaurant is insane. The adorable bearded guy making the pizza is at least savvy and tries to make amends with customers between throwing things in the oven. The younger girl however, she's relatively new, needs to work elsewhere. She's very kind but can barely even make eye contact with you while you are ordering. The first time we thought she was just really baked, but this last time she just seemed too shy. To work in a restaurant you have to have exceptional people skills, fast feet, and know how to prioritize. A couple came in while we were there and sat at the bar. They left 30 minutes later because she hadn't even given them a menu. Another couple outside had to come in twice to get served by her. I know it was busy (meaning mostly full) but serving comes before going through receipts at the counter and rearranging wine in the back. Honestly, we felt so bad for her that she was in over her head that we were still going to leave her a 20% tip. That was before we had to get up and ask her to run our card, twice.

The atmosphere was a bit different, not what first comes to mind when I think ''Thai Restaraunt'' but it was suiting for its environment, nonetheless.  ''Cafe-ish & simple''. I would agree it would make a better ''lunch'' place, than dinner, though.\\n\\n   During our visit there, my husband and I received courteous service and a attentive waitress.  She was very nice and honest about explaining things on the menu and other pricing and culinary matters. \\n\\n   The ''Tom Yum'' bowl was graciously portioned and filling, went very nice with the green tea there and I'd have to say that $25 fed us both rather well! And that's impressive as far as this kind of dish can go!  I was very impressed with my dragon roll and savored every bite of the unagi roll!\\n\\n  I'd say it's worth the extra drive and I hope to be able to bring a friend to check this place out soon!

This is available for take out too which you don't see often.\\n\\nThe food is good for the price. Two items that stood out for me, both good and bad:\\n\\n1) I really like their spicy tuna rolls here - the spicy sauce (basically sriracha mixed with a smidge of mayo) is drizzled over the top of the roll. Inside the roll has the crispy tempura bits incorporated with the tuna which give it that nice crunch. \\n\\n2) Wasn't a huge fan of their Alaska roll though. I was expecting something similar to those big roll sushi places - a piece of salmon on top of a California roll with the Japanese salad dressing drizzled on top. If that's what you want, head on over to Sushi Garden down the street.\\n\\nThe service is definitely lacking here. Tables seem to get a half assed wipe with a barely moist towel.

The last time I went, a good friend took me here and paid for dinner, which I think made the meal taste even better. haha.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is just what you would expect from the outside, run down and in need of some work but I think that is what makes this place work. You walk in, they seat you and then you order what you want. The food is full of flavor because its made just like a regular burger without attention to any health concerns. \\n\\nI got the chilli cheese fries and burger and so I got a whole plate full of fries with lots of melted cheese and chilli piled on and that is what a plate of good food should look like. Its steam coming off the plate and you can't wait to dive in. \\n\\nThe burger was the kind of burger with flavor dripping from it, knowing what I'm really referring to, the grease and flavor. Again not for the health hearted people but for those just looking for classic American food knowing that you will get that full feeling in the end.\\n\\nThe menu is full of classic items, burgers, sodas, hot dogs, fried dishes and such. Its just a classic college dive for those late night munchies or just to hangout with friends and grab a burger. \\n\\nAs with any place like this, you don't go for the amazing customer service which they do try for but this place is more about the food, not for those who are offended easily.\\n\\nSo if your around  and with a friend who's up for paying and want to try something new and different then stop on by, enjoy, and fill up an artery or two!"},{"name":"la Barbecue","address":"2027 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great brisket perfectly smoked, it melts in your mouth.

The service has always been friendly.  I've been with small parties and with a large birthday group, and the service was attentive no matter the size. Dishes to try: deviled eggs, ahi poke bowl and the street tacos. If you have a sweet tooth like I do, the s'mores brownie will hit the spot, and it's big enough to share!  I like that they offer mini desserts too.\\n\\nTHE SO-SO: It's dark in the bar. No windows, basement-type kind of dark.  In my opinion, it's pricey and not a great value. Pass on the mac and cheese (sounded amazing, but ended up having too many flavors competing for your taste buds), and the sweet potato fries (the fries are good, the dipping sauce is good, but the flavors try to overpower each other when served together). \\n\\nTHE IRRITATING: Normally when you go out, it's a better deal to get a larger beer instead of several pints, right?  Not here. Their half yard is 32oz, or the equivalent of two pints.  The half yard will cost you more (the exact amount more depends on which beer you get) than two pints.  I get that the half yard glass is cool, but it's just that - a glass.  You don't get to keep it!  While it may not be a huge deal to you, that annoys me. \\n\\nTIP: If you're perusing the beer menu and looking to try a cider, know that when it says \\"Ciders - Seasonals\\", it doesn't mean you're looking at the seasonal ciders list.  It should read \\"Ciders & Seasonals\\".  One in our party was surprised to find his pour wasn't a seasonal cider, but a seasonal beer.  The staff took it back cheerfully, but bummer to waste a perfectly good (yet ambiguously titled) adult beverage! \\n\\nBecause it's a chain, I understand that a lot of this can't be controlled by the Portland team, but it's important to know before you go.  All in all - Yard House is A-OK.  Good food, yet not the best bang for your buck."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"We were not impressed by the food taste for the most part.\\n\\n-The duck fat fries and crispy Brussel sprouts were good. \\n\\n-The salmon rilette lacked flavor.

Unless you haven't eaten in days, you WILL go home with leftovers.  Good news is that they reheat very well.  \\n\\nThey refer to themselves as \\"family style\\" but that isn't 100% true - if you order chicken parmigiana you will get a huge piece of chicken and a heaping serving of pasta, not just a big platter of chicken parm.  It is still enough to share between two people or plan on having it for lunch or dinner the next day. \\n\\nThe prices are reasonable for the size of the servings in the North End, and I've heard that lunch is an even better deal.  \\n\\nThe wine list isn't big, but covers the basics, though you have to go digging for something reasonably priced.  \\n\\nBesides being plentiful, the food is delicious, if perhaps a bit predictable.  Plenty of garlic, cream and cheese in all the right places.  Breaded chicken and eggplant is crispy around the edges and smothered in fresh tomato sauce and plenty of mozzarella cheese.  Thick, freshly made fettuccine noodles are coated with thick and creamy Alfredo sauce that is made with more cream per plate than is your fridge at any given time.   Order something primavera style and be prepared for a small garden's worth of big chunky vegetables. \\n\\nA special nod to the restaurant for accommodating a group of nine - we called at 4:00 p.m. and managed to get reservations for 6:30 that night.  Be aware that they won't sit your group unless everyone is with you though.  \\n\\nI would consider La Famiglia Giorgio's a great introduction to traditional North End cuisine - not cutting edge, and not old-school regional Italian, but big servings of familiar, comfortable food."},{"name":"Clay's Sports Cafe","address":"6518 Roswell Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I had meaning to get here FOREVER..

They served them on the big round silver platter that you usually see a large piece of pizza or a pizza pie on. Super hot (temperature), juicy, fresh wings, for sure. The taste of the first bite was excellent, but as I ate, I realized there was a little bit too much lemon on 'em for me. I couldn't finish all in one sitting. I took 4 of them home and reheated in the oven, and it was back to a good balance of lemon-pepper.\\n\\nThe place is as big as my 1-bedroom apartment and very.. green? and kinda dark ..but there are a ton of TVs - many more than are proportionate to its size as a bar. :) That's a good thing, I think!

Neither one of us had dinner plans so we decided to check it out as we are always looking for new places. \\nI can't remember what time it was but I'd say it was around 6pm or so as we made it in time for the end of happy hour. We did not have to wait for a table but it was busy. There was also musical entertainment which I wasn't a huge fan as it made it hard to hear at times but not a deal breaker. \\nAfter being seated we were quickly brought water, salsa, and chips. Somebody should have warned me about the salsa! I had a big scoop of it on my chip and all the hot spices that came with!! Holy mouth burn but I kinda liked it. Spice is good every now and then. I learned my lesson though and each subsequent scoop was lighter. \\nAs I mentioned we made it in time for happy hour. I was unsure of what that meant as the happy hour prices are not on the menu. However, I think it was $3 for the 12 oz margarita and $5 for the next size which I think is 16oz. The margarita for that price was pretty darn good! The regular margarita flavor was a bit sweeter than at other places but I like sweet so it was great for me. I had two of them and was left feeling pretty nice. \\nAs for the food, I normally get flautas when I eat at a Tex-Mex place. They are like my latest obsession. However, everything I read about this place told me to get the tacos. Who am I to not listen to the people! So I had the village tacos with beef! I was very excited about it especially the fried tortilla. I mean everything is better when fried. Our food arrived very quickly. I couldn't wait to dig in. I will say that they tend to go a bit overboard with the lettuce and diced tomatoes on top but easy to scoop off to the side.  I must say these tacos were love at first bit!!! Greasy, well seasoned, fried goodness!!!! They are also very filling. I got a little carried away and ordered 3 but only ate one (they made for a great lunch the next day). The food is pretty inexpensive which is also great. \\nOverall I can't wait to go back to this place and take some new people. Good food, good drinks, and great prices.

We were bringing our daughter for a birthday lunch as this is where she picked to go. We had a coupon for free birthday buffet. It took 6 minutes and several calls over the loud speaker before a manager came up to the register to put in the code. No apology for making us wait, no acknowledgment at all. The food was better than I thought it was going to be. Not great by any means but not bad. The prime rib was cooked perfectly! The horseradish was weak for my taste. The au jus was tasty. The steak once the employee cooking it listened when I kept saying medium rare it also was perfect. The regular salad bar looked fresh to me. I can only say my hubby thought some items tasted like they were leftover over and not fresh. The bathroom at least the ladies was downright disgusting! None of the doors on the three stalls locked. The stalls were in need of cleaning for sure. The floors were wet and the the wet floor sign out right in the middle of the floor.

And now that I have, it's safe to say that I anticipate plenty of repeat visits in the near, and frequent future.\\n\\nIt's located not far off of Cobb Parkway, which in any other location, I'd be inclined to use the phrase \\"conveniently\\" to describe it, but given the fact that Cobb Parkway is often times a traffic nightmare, slated to get worse throughout the coming years, interpret however you will to how much you think it's worth to get some baller tacos.  Anyway, I don't even know what the shopping center is called anymore, but it's the one across the street from Best Buy on Cobb.  Going north, you pass Weather Channel, but if you've hit the Big Chicken, you've gone way too far.  Regardless, being a part of a shopping center, there's plenty of places to park.\\n\\nThe establishment itself is not large, and there's a high probability that you will not get a table at peak times.  I went on a Sunday evening, and was flabbergasted at the line that was still stretched to the back of the business, and if not for the luck of coming across some people leaving, probably wouldn't have been able to get a table to sit at.  But if you put weight in the idea that lots of people must equate quality, then you probably won't be wrong.\\n\\nAlthough a lot of thing looked very tempting, like tortas and burritos, I came for tacos, so tacos is what I ended up getting.  And at like $1.23 or something per taco, it's very easy to end up ordering like seven tacos and gorging yourself.  But since I'm \\"trying\\" to be slightly more health conscious, I ended up getting \\"just\\" four.  One steak, chicken, marinated pork and chorizo.\\n\\nThe tacos are literally meat on tortillas, so if you were expecting tacos stuffed to the gills with fluff like you'd get at Moe's or even Taco Bell, you're coming to the wrong place.  There a little fixins bar near the pickup area, where you can add stuff like onions and cilantro, and salsas that are all somehow spicy, but that's really about it.\\n\\nThey're also not huge, but at barely a buck and a quarter, that shouldn't really have been the expectations.  Personally, I could probably kill each one in three bites.  But regardless, the quality should not be questioned, because they were some of the best tacos I've had in ages.  Mostly on account of the fact that they tasted like _real_ tacos, and not the kind you can get at any chain joint.  Double tortillas that taste so freshly different than your run of the mill joint, and stuffed to the gills with meat.\\n\\nThere's no BS with the flavors too, because it's just straight up meat on tortillas, and the rest is up to your preference.  I typically dabbed salsas onto each bite, because I wanted to mix and match flavors and heat, but none of the tacos really needed them if I didn't have to have them.  Ultimately, I think the chorizo was the best, but that's not to say I wouldn't destroy seven of any single one of them either.\\n\\nAnyway, my overall impression of the place is pretty glowing, and I can't wait for the next time to go there.  The biggest struggle will be trying to figure out if I want to dive into their ridiculous looking plate of nachos, or if I cave in and get a torta, which I still haven't been able to find a truly good one in Atlanta.  But the place is conveniently located (in my opinion), costs absurdly low, for a very decent quality flavor.\\n\\nI will undoubtedly be back in the future."},{"name":"Taj Mahal","address":"1075 E South Boulder Rd, Ste 145","city":"Louisville","stars":"4.5","text":"I love this place!

We started with a cheese plate, which offered a nice selection of 5 cheese that we chose.  They have a good variety, and the portions of cheese are pretty generous.  We were instructed on which order we should approach the cheeses in, and they were great to snack on as we sampled wines.\\n\\nWe tried a couple of whites and reds to go with our food.  Prices for the half glass pours were pretty reasonable, and it's nice to have the option of smaller pours.  The carpaccio was dressed lightly and tasted very fresh.  My favorite was the chocolate pasta with a hint of orange zest and mushrooms.  It was rich and buttery with the beefy flavor of the mushrooms, and the cocoa was very subtle, though present.  The pasta tasted fresh and was cooked al dente.  It's a dish that could stand up to a light red wine or go with a drier white, depending on your preference.  The rest of the food was ok, not too memorable, but then again, we went with a focus on wine.\\n\\nWe decided to skip dessert for the night, as the cheese plate kept us munching throughout the meal.

I thought okay, honest people, we'll let those who came first go order first.

And we kindly said that people were in line first and to allow those to get ahead... she pretty much gave us an attitude with a no. So those who truly there first had to wait in line that the two hipster girls started. SO what' was the point of us getting there early?! I wish the staff would have speak up and said \\"oh btw these people were here first, they get to go first\\" like no one stood up! so we ended up being pushed back to the end of the line because by then other people started waited in line. Lesson learn.. for those sitting there.. just have someone stand in line because some people are rude and have no etiquette \\n\\nokay onto the food...\\n\\nreg link and chipotle link: both have good flavors, both are spicy but the chipotle has a stronger smokey taste and was much more spicy than the classic. I am not a fan of these sausages even though they have good flavor. i just don't like how crumbly the texture is. The casing was crunchy good, but the sausage meat itself, once you bite it, it just crumbles off into your mouth, i personally don't like that.\\n\\nturkey: ordered because might as well try it.

The dry rub they used didn't overpower the meat. it was VERY good. Though expensive but i think it was worth it. \\n\\nbrisket: super soft, even the part where it's most \\"dry\\" is still moist and soft. so you can imagine just how moist and tender the most tender part is.

I can't give it more than 3 stars because it is my review, not my husbands and he should get his own Yelp account. I didn't even know that Smokehouse 21 existed if not for a desperate, hunger driven Yelp search for BBQ on the west side of town. The reason it had to be BBQ is that is the only food that will get my husband to go out at the last minute on a Friday night after working a long week....and I had nothing to cook at home. We drove over and found parking pretty quickly. The place itself is quite cozy and very small. I liked the simple, warm decor, interesting butcher inspired, framed water color prints adorning the walls. There was also a taxidermified (I just made that word up) Boars Head on one wall that seemed to be getting positive attention. There is a mouth watering, smoky aroma that greets you when you walk in the door. We sat at a four top by the door which had a nice view of the whole restaurant for me to people watch will we waited a very long time for food. We ordered 3 pulled pork platters which come with two sides per. Between us, we had the baked beans, mac & cheese and corn on the cob. We also ordered 3 corn muffins which are not included in the meal. The cornbread came out first and they were served muffin style with a side of \\"maple butter syrup\\". The bacon studded muffins were yummy dipped in the syrup and we decided to put them aside and save them for our dessert. It would be a nice touch if they could warm the muffins before serving, as they were quite cold. A long while later, we received our meals. The pulled park was warm, not anywhere near hot. It was pretty standard Pulled Pork, portion size was just average.The \\"Corn with Tarragon Butter\\"  was pretty bad, two cold halves  with a hard cold lump of butter sitting on top. I couldn't smear the butter if I had wanted to. The corn also tasted off. I did not eat  anymore after the first bite. I also overheard the next table sending theirs back. Small tangent: if no one is eating the corn and/or sending it back, please notice this and rectify the problem. Thank you. The Brown Sugar and Molasses Baked Beans were not that interesting and not at all sweet like they sounded, rather a bit salty. They were also lava-like in temperature and difficult to eat until almost last. We all loved the Mac & Cheese with Bacon & Cornbread  Crumbs. It was thick, creamy, cheesy and satisfying. So overall, I think you could say I liked 75% of my meal. If it were cheap BBQ, I wouldn't care so much, but it is quite spendy for what we got. They need to pay better attention to the quality of the sides going out as well as serving food at the correct temperature. I am sure I will be back, and if I have a better experience then I will revise my review.

I had the caponata for openers, quickly followed by a cold appetizer of delicious marinated roasted beets with avocado, pickled egg, goat cheese and pistachios. When and where I find squid ink dishes on the menu, I go for it. In this case, I enjoyed a plate of squid ink rigatoni w rock shrimp, young squid, octopus, mussels, san marzano tomatoes, & Calabrian chili. Molto bene! Magnifico!

I'm sorry, but if you are asking $16 dollars for a cheeseburger, I better get that burger cooked the way I wish... My salad was a ceasar salad with brussel sprout. No complaints there. Now, the grits were unlike any grits I have ever eaten. I'm assuming that they use a stone ground grit as opposed to the fine ground grits we are use to seeing. But the flavor was reminiscent of green chille salsa with a few grits running around in it. It was like soup! Not very appetizing, really. \\n\\nTo sum up our experience, it wasn't horrible. But, we'll probably not come back. It was so underwhelming and lackluster.

I recall a hundred years ago when I was a server, every so often you had a table where things just went oddly, where the timing was off.  Maybe we were that table for her.  She was nice enough, not terrible, but not good.  We were missing things like plates and silverware when our dessert came.

We will let you know when we need that, mmmmkay??  No one likes to feel they are being kicked out of a place, especially when it's only 7 pm.  She made us feel rushed.  Speaking of the check - she brought the wrong one over, charged my friend's card for yet another table's check (the void slip she produced did not match the original wrong check) and then finally brought the \\"right\\" check.  So, there were 3 checks involved in this scenario - not sure how that happens.  Anyhow, 5 days later now, my friend's card still shows the two charges still - no void yet.  So she has to call them to deal with that.  About the food:  instead of bread they serve blue barbecue potato chips with some type of buttermilk onion dip - kind of like a fancy french onion dip.  An interesting touch.  I'd go back, because the flat iron steak with herb goat cheese butter was delicious, and so were the donuts (the only dessert they have available).

At least they're not one of those AYCE sushi places that tries to pack their nigiri with as much rice that would compress into a little oval shaped ball as physically possible.  In regards to taste/quality of the sushi, I'm not sure if any of the 4-5 star reviews that this place got were by people who even had taste buds. I think supermarket sushi would've tasted better than this because every piece of fish here barely had any taste at all.  When I have sushi I tend to use as little soy sauce as possible to really taste the fish.  I will have to suggest against that method here.  Soak those things in the soy sauce - wasabi paste consistency mixtures that people love.

Not the best meat in the world but decent for hanger steak.  The fries were just ok with nothing special about them.  The best part of the meal was the dessert as the warm toffee cake was one of the best desserts I have ever had.  It was warm and gooey with just the right amount of sweetness and I swapped the blood orange sorbet for the usual vanilla gelato which added a nice balance of flavors.  Highly recommended!

Dinner service was alright, but I'm wondering if lunch or happy hour has a little more character.  Friendly service and pretty good food.\\n\\nStarted off with the lemonegi (lemon & green onion) calamari, which sounded delightful but came off as just OK.  I would have liked it better if the batter was less thick and more crispy; it was a little chewy.  I also would have liked a stronger lemon/onion flavor, although the spicy dipping sauce it came with was pretty tasty.  Presentation was elegant, but you don't get much in terms of volume.\\n\\nMiso soup was your standard miso.  Not too salty, and not too watery, (which are pretty much the only things you can do wrong to a miso).  Came free with dinner service, which helped to round out the meal and give a little more value for the price.\\n\\nShared the Ume Teishoku (18 pieces of nigiri + 3 rolls; you don't get to decide which) with 2 others, and we were struggling by the end.  Probably could have fed a 4th person comfortably.  It came in an awesome boat!  I mean, I've seen plenty of sushi boats before, but this one was pretty beautiful.  Fish was fresh and tasty, and you even got a little tako & cucumber salad and a couple of pieces of egg sushi on there, too.  The rolls weren't that exciting, pretty much your standard rolls that come with nigiri sets: basically california rolls with a bit of something more interesting on top.\\n\\nThey're still honoring their Grand Opening discount of 15% if you check in on Yelp or Facebook, so we got out of there with some pretty good bang for our bucks."},{"name":"Gladys Knight's Signature Chicken & Waffles","address":"529 Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Delicious!

I'm not an avid yelper but this experience was bad enough that I had to share this one.\\n\\nWe entered as a party of 3 at 7 and was told 45 minutes. Fine, for a busy restaurant at 7 which is pretty new.  We grabbed some drinks at the bar and one of the owners even came by and greeted us, very nice and welcoming, grabbed some glasses, and sent service our way after seeing we were near the back of the bar waiting line.  After about an hour, and our second round,  we checked back in and were told another 20 minutes. Fine, 20 minutes is fine when you've waited 45. 2 hours rolls around and we check back in only to be told it'll be another 45 minutes, which is strange considering we saw larger parties roll in and get seated before us shortly after they came in.  In the end, after close to 2 and a half hours, we gave our notice and just walked out since it seems pretty ridiculous.  The thing is, we didn't complain, we didn't make a peep, we just waited.  I mean, if you told us two hours from the beginning, that would have been fine... we would have given it a shot since the atmosphere and people seemed cool. But to tell us, it'll be just a little bit on several occasions only to tell us it'll be another hour after already waiting 2, is just a slap in the face. Not even the real exclusive restaurants in town do that.\\n\\n I saw one of the owners on the way out and mentioned to him directly that it was a pretty bad experience and explained what happened and the best answer i got with a smile was \\"people have waited here longer since its a new restaurant. some have waited a couple of hours, been told it's another hour, and still waited\\".  Great, well you should have told us from the beginning vs. telling us 45! Just a classic response/solid attitude from the owner of a new restaurant...  \\n\\nYou don't have to take my advice, but you can get some decent beers, some decent scotch, great food, and real service,  at plenty of other places around town that won't jerk you around."},{"name":"TILT","address":"1355 NW Everett St, Ste 120","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"One of my favorite new places to go is Tilt in the Pearl District.

Dubbed as \\"Handcrafted Food & Drink Built for the American Workforce\\" this burger bar is a blue collar inspired restaurant and bar with scratch recipe biscuits, gourmet burgers and old fashioned pies.  They have amazing local brewed beer choices and specialize in classic cocktail recipes.\\n\\nI've had quite a few items on the menu but my favorite by far is the Freebird.  It's a fried chicken sandwich so good you won't believe it.  Topped with a slaw that has a jalapeno kick to it, the southern fried chicken is tender juicy and has a crunchy batter fried to perfection.  They use a bacon honey mustard that is a great compliment to all the other flavors going on with the sandwich. \\n\\nFind a dish you like, and then try it \\"Tilted Down\\" as a platter with a fried egg and smothered with their pork and bacon gravy.

We were greeted by a very useless hostess who told us to seat ourselves all while never leaving her seat at the bar. We then ordered our food. My friend ordered the Migas with a side of bacon. Her food came out with no side of bacon but rather some undercooked bacon chopped into her food. The waitress fully knowing the order was wrong still brought it out. The food was lackluster in itself. The migas lacked flavor and I had to drown mine in salsa just for them to taste good. While dining we couldn't help but overhear your staff complain about their \\"terrible\\" jobs. The hostess and another waitress were complaining about their wages and having to tip out the bus boy. This sort of thing is not professional in the least. After our meal we sat the entire rest of our time their with our used dishes sitting there. They were never cleared from our table. But my biggest problem comes from our checking out. I had an expired groupon and was going to use it. I already had it pulled up on my phone ready to show the waitress. We then handed her phone and she held onto it for like 30 seconds pushing buttons. She then informs us I had already used it. I told her I had used some in the past but the one I had pulled up was not redeemed yet. In short we didn't get to use it but your waitress still marked it redeemed????

Breakfast IS the most important meal of the day, is it not? Luckily, having read other reviews, I knew I would have to get there early and that there would be a line, so I somehow managed to get my hungover a$$ out of bed and to the Red Wagon (or rather the RAD Wagon) by 9:45 am. Sure, that may not be early by many folks' standard, but considering a) I had stumbled home from the Keefer Bar the night before sometime in the wee hours of the morning, and b) it was my birthday, I was filled with a feeling of accomplishment.\\n\\nBut I digress...\\n\\nWhen my husband and I arrived, the place was already packed, and there was a smallish lineup of about 10 other people outside waiting for a table. Thankfully, it was a sunny morning so the wait was actually quite pleasant, but I can imagine that during Vancouver's 10-month rainy season, a stint outside would be less so. We put our names on the list once the hostess came outside, and I was impressed that she offered coffee to everyone waiting for a table. What's even cooler is that the coffee was served to us in proper china cups, as though we were already at our table. Nice touch, Rad Wagon!\\n\\nWhen we were seated a short 20 minutes later, my husband and I perused the menu and decided that we'd share two items since everything looked so great. He ordered the famed pulled pork pancakes, and I, after seeing their daily special written on the chalkboard outside, opted for that -a fried oyster benedict, served atop cornbread with a chipotle hollandaise sauce. It was to DIE for. Totally worth the walk from Commercial Drive.\\n\\nNeedless to say, I would eat there again in a heartbeat. If I could give any advice that hasn't been touched on in other reviews, it would be to go for the daily specials -the chef is a fine comfort food genius, and you won't be disappointed.

The place is relatively small and was quite busy when I visited during lunch time this Tuesday; fortunately, I was a single diner, so I was able to get a seat right away at the bar (the place did clear out a bit over the next hour). I had their Pulled Pork Pancakes and Breakfast Banh Mi (with Pork Belly). Both of the dishes were fantastic. Although I didn't find the portions to be particularly large, the food was quite rich and filling: I ended up taking most of my Banh Mi home for later. The service was casual and the staff can be stretched thin at times, but they are friendly. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit, and I'd highly recommend visiting this place.\\n\\nPulled Pork Pancakes ($15):\\n4/5\\nThis consisted of three pancakes sandwiching pulled pork, and is served with a large piece of butter and Jack Daniels flavoured maple syrup. I really liked the texture of the pancakes, which were light and fluffy, with a slightly chewy texture. I did find there to be a slight bit of aftertaste however, whcih I think might be from baking soda. There was quite a generous amount of pulled pork present, which was tender and juicy, albeit a tad bland. I really enjoyed the syrup, which had a really nice fragrance from the liquor. Even though the portion didn't look that big - I've been spoiled by places like Jethro's and The Elbow Room Cafe - they are actually quite filling; I'm a big eater and I was actually quite full from eating the dish.\\n\\nBreakfast Banh Mi, with Pork Belly ($12):\\n4.5/5\\nThis consisted of a baguette filled with two eggs, pickled vegetables, jalapeno, and your choice of pork belly, pulled pork, or tofu (I went with pork belly), and was served with a small side of homefries. The baugette had a great crispy exterior while being soft and chewy on the inside. It was extremely flavourful, with a nice tang from the pickled vegetables and a great heat from the jalapeno. The pork belly was quite tender and juicy and the eggs added great richness, although the runny yolks did make the sandwich a bit messy to eat. I loved the homefries/hashbrowns, which were among some of the best that I've had (I've generally not had much luck with hashbrowns): they were crispy and fried with bacon and green onions, which provided great flavour. Unfortunately, I was quite full from the pulled pork pancakes, so I was only able to take a few bites of this dish before packing the rest for later.\\n\\nSummary:\\nFood: 4.5/5\\nPrice: 4/5\\nService: 3.5/5\\nOverall: 4.5/5\\nRecommendations: Pulled Pork Pancakes, Breakfast Banh Mi"},{"name":"Tom, Dick & Hank","address":"191 Ralph David Abernathy Blvd SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Food was excellent service was great and the rooftop view was the cherry on top!

Tico has long been my favorite \\"Latin American\\" restaurant, so I was eager to try Chef Schlow's new Mexican joint.\\n\\nWe were served chips and salsa for free right as we were seated.  They serve two kinds of salsa there, a chunky one and a smooth one that is made of blended peppers.  We mixed the two together for the right amount of spiciness and flavor.  We also ordered a side of guacamole, which tasted freshly made and very good.  The chips could be better.. they tasted like they came out of a bag, and were not the thin white corn tortilla chips that true Mexican restaurants utilize, but they were edible.\\n\\nMy husband and I ordered 4 orders of Street Tacos - the Tongue & Cheek, the Fish, the Spicy Shrimp and the Lean Beef.  Each order had 2 tacos in each.  The beef was definitely the best, followed closely by the Spicy Shrimp, then Tongue & Cheek with the fish tacos in last place.\\n\\nThe tacos were above average for Boston, but would have benefited from a little shredded cabbage (for crunch) and maybe a little bit of shredded cotija for creaminess.\\n\\nThe Hot N Skinny margarita was fantastic.. it is much like the one that they serve at Tico, only a little bit sweeter.  My husband ordered the Blood Orange margarita and he enjoyed it, but thought it would have been better with fresh (or at least recently) squeezed blood orange juice, instead of the syrup that they used.\\n\\nThe service was very good.

She always comes by afterwards to see how everyone liked their food. \\n\\nThe customer service is what every restaurant, heck every place of business should strive for. This is a family operation, mom, dad, young adult kids, all working side by side with customers needs as their number one concern. They always greet you warmly when you arrive, check on you several times during the visit and keep the place clean and welcoming. \\n\\nI always worry about giving such a glowing review because I would hate to arrive one day and not be able to find a table because I shared the place with too many people, however these wonderful people deserve to have a packed place and others deserve the opportunity to enjoy this establishment."},{"name":"Twelve Hours","address":"559 Washington St","city":"Brighton","stars":"4.5","text":"ËøôÂÆ∂ËØÑËÆ∫ÁúüÁöÑÂæàÈ´òÔºåÊâÄ‰ª•ËøáÊù•ËØïËØïÁúãÊòØ‰∏çÊòØÁúüÈÇ£‰πàÂ•ΩÂêÉÔºÅÊàë‰ª¨ÁÇπ‰∫Ü‰∏âÊñáÈ±ºÊ≤ôÊãâ„ÄÇÂèâÁÉßËÜúÈ•º„ÄÇÁÇíÊ≤≥Á≤â„ÄÇÂë≥ÈÅì‰∏ÄÁ∫ßÊ£í„ÄÇËÄÅÊùø‰∫∫ÈùûÂ∏∏ÁöÑÂ•Ω„ÄÇÊúçÂä°Âëò‰πüÈùûÂ∏∏Á§ºË≤å„ÄÇ‰∫îÈ¢óÊòüÁúü‰∏çËøá‰ªΩ„ÄÇÈáåÈù¢Ê≥∞È§ê‰πüÈùûÂ∏∏ÈÄÇÂêàÂîê‰∫∫Âè£Âë≥„ÄÇÁúüÂøÉÂñúÊ¨¢ÔºÅÂº∫ÁÉàÊé®‰ªãÔøΩ?2017-05-02 04:12:14"},{"name":"Ceili's Modern Irish Pub","address":"7311 Westminster Highway","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"Wednesday wing night 39 cents each.

It was about 41 degrees outside and when we walked in, it was about 45 degrees.  The guy at the register told us to order up front with him and then they'd take the food to us. There were no waitresses or someone's mom so I have no idea what everone is talking about.  We first tried to order their fried mac and cheese balls.  They said they don't make those anymore....that was a good start.  So, we skipped the appetizer and ordered a Patti Labelle and a James Brown burger with 2 orders of fries and 2 drinks.  I think our total was around 25 dollars.  Not that cheap.  After ordering the guy told us to go to the back where there's a heater and it's warmer.  We walk back to the \\"insulated\\" patio and sat down on freezing chairs and could not stop shivering.  It was back to about 41 degrees in there.  I have no clue what this guy was talking about being warm.  He was wearing a big leather jacket himself, so he knew it was cold.  We came back inside the main area and told him it's not any warmer out there and wanted our food to go.  He didn't comment.  The guy there was very friendly though and talkative, asked us if we needed anything during our wait.  The food took awhile to make, so make sure you have time.  That didn't bother us since it was obviously all freshly made, just wish it was warmer.  We brought our food back to the hotel.  My burger was ok.  I asked for it to be done medium rare and it was welldone.  My husband said his was okay as well.  His being on Texas toast and having a bunch of sauce, the burger was messy and the bread was soggy and falling apart.  The fries were pretty salty and soggy.  Nothing to write home about.  Basically I have no desire to go back there and I'm sure there are plenty of other better burger places in Austin.  I would advise anyone that decides to go there, do NOT go in the winter.

I mean we  really want to read about the food, right?  I'll give you both. \\n\\nThe Good: the atmosphere is nice.  I enjoyed the dim lighting and the cool and comfortable couches in the lounge area.  \\n\\nI loved my Ocean Roll.  Even though it was small (with more rice than fish like the other Yelpers wrote), it was fresh and flavorful.  The spicy yellow tail was really complimented by the cucumber, salmon, tuna and avocado.  Yum!  Unfortunately, you only get a quarter of a thimbleful of  ginger but that was easily rectified by hunting down my server.  \\n\\nThe Grilled Salmon salad was also good.  It wasn't as great as the roll but it had fresh Romaine lettuce, broccoli, mushrooms and bell peppers.  The salmon had a good crunchy texture, almost blackened.  It was a pretty presentation but the small salad was missing something sweet.  I think a ginger honey dressing or an orange glaze on the salmon would have made it divine. The crab rangoon was also good.  It too was small but tasty.  \\n\\nThe Bad: The Veggie Spring rolls were forgettable.  They lacked flavor even with the sweet sauce.  The Pan Fried Goyza (fried pork dumplings) tasted even worse.  The filling wasn't good and I shudder reminiscing about the sauce.  Also, the restroom was not odor free.    \\n\\nThe Ugly: I frequently use a Scoutmob when it's my first time in a restaurant.  But I've never had a server add their 18% tip before deducting the discount.  Normally, if your meal is $30, $15 is deducted for the Scoutmob which nets $15 plus tax.  An 18% gratuity is then added (around $3) and I usually over-tip.  My server took the $30 meal and gave himself a $7 tip!  Then he took the 50% discount off which made my meal $22.50.  Not cool!  Especially considering I had to get up and find him when I needed ginger and my check.  I felt bamboozled and I wanted to drop-kick someone.  But then I remembered my 'Yelp' power of the pen. \\n\\nOverall, the Ocean Roll and Crab Rangoon were good if you like tiny food.  But the small portions do not justify the high prices or the inflated tip if you use a Scoutmob.

No BBQ, but Donn's BBQ is nearby and they're pretty good.  Although I don't think anything is worth dealing with the traffic where 969 is only one lane.   \\n\\nI went with the deal for 2 large single topping pizzas.  There was a slight billing issue where another topping was added to the receipt, and the guy behind the counter didn't seem able to fix it quickly so we just agreed to pick another topping that I liked and he'd add it to one of the pizzas.  I probably could've gotten a little more out of that to test their customer service but ehh... it was only a little over a buck.\\n\\nAnother 1/2 star for the way they cut the pizzas, I might be a little anal, but seriously it's not hard to slice a pizza into 8 even slices.   It's easy, 2 cuts perpendicular to each other with the only hard part as gauging the middle of the pizza then 1 cut bisecting the pizza in between 2 of those cuts, and another bisecting the middle from the other side. \\n\\nThe pizza had a thick crust, it was cooked well, not burned or under-done.   The cheese and sauce were well proportioned, the toppings were spread out well on one pizza but the pepperoni had a distinct lack of ... well.. pepperoni.   This is good pizza, not amazing nor great, but for being so far out of the way from literally everything in Austin and civilization (can't wait to move out of here!), they'll definitely get some repeat business.

I can never find the spot for tipping when using their website, when I've ordered from them before I usually would tip them cash. However, this time I honestly completely forgot to do this, probably because I've waited well over an hour and was so hungry. I did look at the receipt and  figured possibly the 2 dollar delivery surcharge could cover this time. Literally 30 min after getting my food I got a call from an angry woman asking \\"Well are you going to tip the driver?!\\" \\"The driver wants to know where his tip is\\" I felt very awkward and put on the spot and asked if there was a way to do it with the card and apologized and told her to put a few dollars on there.

Typically we hold our celebratory dinners at the Keg as we enjoy good food and steak and lobster is my wife's favourite. They always step up to the plate for us every year. An acquaintance recommended us to try the fantastic steaks at the Hy's Restaurant instead as apparently they were known to serve phenomenal steaks. As Informed by recommendation and some good reviews, I convinced my wife to consider trying and as it was in fact a very special birthday and Hy's Restaurant was considered a special place. \\nWe made a reservation with a request that it's my wife's 50th birthday and I was hoping it would be a spectacular experience.\\nWe arrive at the Hy's and were treated with immaculate service. The ambiance was extraordinary. We ordered a bottle of sparkling wine to commemorate the occasion. We ordered your famous cheese bread and Caesar Salad which were both rather delicious. We were eagerly anticipating the New York striploin as it's recommended to be more flavourful and tender. It's very unfortunate to say that we were quite disappointed. In this aspect, we definitely compared your steaks to the Keg's. My wife had cut off approximately 1/3 of her 10 oz steak which was all fat. And just so you know, we don't eat steak fat. We like it lean. My cut was quite fatty but not nearly as much as hers. We checked with our waiter and he informs us that it was like that with that kind of steak. Really? Last I remembered, we ordered steak not fat. Overall, they were so-so steaks with a baked potato. There was Nothing spectacular. We have yet to encounter a similar experience with the same sort of steaks at the Keg. \\nAfter the meal, we were offered the dessert menu. I went up to the hostess to enquire if our waiter was aware of it being a birthday dinner, as I had informed in our reservation. She informs me that the waiter was aware. So when asked what we would Ike, I ordered the cheesecake, which was her favourite. The cake tasted pretty ordinary. I wanted to point out that the dessert was not complimentary, being a birthday, as I found out when I paid for our meal. I guess exceptions are not done for special occasions at the Hy's. \\nUnfortunately, that would have been different at the Keg, as they have always been accommodating to special occasions such as birthdays. \\nThere you have it, this was our first impression and experience. I would have wanted our review to have been more of a positive and uplifting one especially to those who were in similar situation when deciding where to go to celebrate a special occasion.  As you can tell, I have put in some effort in elaborating our visit to your restaurant considering that it's a high end establishment, charge for their meat and get paid for it. Its after all not a fast food restaurant. \\nIt's only fair to let the next person decide, based on a first timers experience, how it is like. \\nWe are totally prepared to pay top dollar for really good food and service however sadly, Our meal experience at the Hy's was not worth the expense and the quality of the steaks were much to be desired. \\nThey pretty much decided for us where we should have our anniversary dinner."},{"name":"Gitto's Pizza","address":"120 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"had med cheese pizza pie, it was so cheesy i could not make the lines where the cuts were!  it was good for me, had it along with garlic knot that was in the center of pie that was a tad salty and buffalo wings which you can't go wrong the sauce was really good.

However, recently this restaurant has taken a turn for the worse. My boyfriend and I have experienced some of the worst service here. For example:\\n\\nHe ordered a bacon cheeseburger and the waitress asked him THREE TIMES if he wanted the big burger or the 3 mini bugers that are half-off during happy hour. and All three times, he told her he did NOT want the 3 tiny burgers. And OF COURSE when we got out food he had the three tiny burgers which taste like little squares of grease. When I said something to her about it, she said she was confused (regardless of askign THREE TIMES and getting the same answer) and would get him a new, bigger burger. He told her not to bother, since we were in a hurry since he had to go to work soon. When the bill came, we got a nice surprise... we were being charged for both the mini burgers AND the one bigger one. And after all that, you'd think they'd comp his untouched meal. But no dice.\\n\\nUnfortunately we tried to venture to this particular Applebees once again, and had service about the same. We ordered our appetizers and waited a while before ordering our actual food because we wanted them to be separate. Almost 20 mins after we ordered our apps, we asked the waitress if we were getting them soon, and she said they'd be out soon, btu there were big groups who came in right before us. So we waited, and finally the manager came by and dropped off our food, but of course, he had our meals and there was no sign of the appetizers. So, I asked him to keep the food warm because had ordered a WHILE before ordering or meals and wanted our apps first obviously. He obliged, and after that the only 2 times we saw our waitress was when she got us refills and gave us the check. And not once did she (nor her manager for that matter) apologize for the mix up.\\n\\n\\nIn conclusion, I think this Applebees has a lot of work ahead of itself to return to its \\"former glory.\\" I may sound a bit picky, but is it really too much to ask for attentive, caring workers?!

We started with the Grilled Gulf Shrimp, Pork Belly, and the Grilled Dates. While the shrimp and pork belly were very tasty, the Grilled Dates blew our mind! It was stuffed with mascarpone and prosciutto and the flavors worked so well together! I was almost inclined to order a few more of those for dessert! \\n\\nAfter the bites, we knew that whatever we chose next would be great, but it was tough to decide what to get next! We shared the Thai Salad which was perfectly dressed with the peanut dressing and fresh veggies - I am a huge fan of cilantro and there was plenty of cilantro flavor to satisfy my craving. We also shared the Flank Steak with fresh chimichurri - this was also fantastic! My favorite dish of the night though was the Duck Ravioli, I wanted to try something new and it was the perfect entree to round out the meal. The duck, basil, ricotta and Asiago flavors complimented each other so well. I would definitely recommend this dish to anyone who has the chance to try it! \\n\\nThe portions were perfect to share so that we could each have a little bit of everything we ordered. The favorite cocktail was the Bee Sting! The whiskey, ginger and honey on the rocks made for the perfect summer evening cocktail. \\n\\nThe atmosphere was very relaxed and soothing on the outdoor patio. As the sun went down they put on an old movie (no sound played as to not interfere with conversations) to enjoy. Service was great!

There was plenty of sauce and they were pan fried, not deep fried, which is a bonus. I found them to be bland, and Mr. J who loves gyoza, did not finish the order, which is a silent sign to me that he did not enjoy them very much. (6/10)\\n\\nSalmon Sashimi was the classic farmed salmon, very fresh but very fatty. (7/10)\\n\\nEdamame... can anyone really give a bad review of this food? they were totally decent and one of the only dishes we ordered that we finished. (10/10)\\n\\nSpicy Tuna Rolls... before I continue I should say that I consider myself to be a spicy tuna roll connoisseur. It is my go-to sushi food. I order them everywhere and know which places make the rolls in the way that I like and which places to avoid. I would put this place on the avoid list. Why you ask? because the spicy sauce they use is a mayonnaise mix squirted on top of a tuna roll. Mayo is not something I like to see in my sushi... ever. I'm aware that I live in canada and thus can have no expectations of authenticity, but to me seeing mayo on my sushi reminds me of that cringe worthy moment in Pretty Woman when Julia Roberts put ketchup on her prime rip steak. No. Just no. The fish was fresh, the rice was firm, but I couldn't get past the mayo. (4/10)\\n\\nBeef Sashimi - This was ify for me. We didnt finish this dish mostly because in with the raw beef soaked in vinnegar there were many pieces of what might have been spinach or some other leafy vegetable. The issue I had with that combination was that the dish appeared to be pre-made and because of that the spinach was wilted and soggy and gross. Once I picked out all of the soggy green (at least 50% of the total volume of the dish) the beef was still yummy and perfectly edible. (5/10)\\n\\nOverall I would probably order from this place again, knowing what I know now the order will be vastly different from my first round, and i won't be including spicy tuna rolls, so this place will be reserved for when I can't physically pick up my order myself.

A young lady greeted us at the door... the place was PACKED.... she let us know it would be a little bit for a table to open up, and she kept checking in with us from time to time to keep us up to the moment on how long it would be (it was maybe about 10 min).   We were seated, took a look at the menus for a bit, and a server came over and introduced herself, and gave us a little run down on things.  She was very cheery, and helpful.   After a bit of a decision process, we both went for Big Max burgers (and I added cheddar cheese and fried onions to mine).  These are accompanied by a side order of fries (cooked in beef fat!  Who the heck does this anymore... so 70's!), and a milkshake each...  vanilla for her, and strawberry for me.   The server informed us that the shakes are handmade at the order time (not coming from a softserve type machine) and it may take a bit of a wait.   No problem for us...\\nThe wait she implied sounded like they would be out shortly after the burgers... but they were out fairly quickly.  And DAMN they were good... up there with some of the best shakes I've had in restaurants, and some of the ones I've made myself (yes... I make my own shakes, and no... I don't use store bought ice cream... I make my own!).  I would go back here JUST for the shakes....\\n\\nThe burgers arrived with the fries... and they looked good...  the buns looked fresh and great actually (I posted a picture on Facebook, and one person made just that comment....).   The burger had a sheen to it... usually indicating a bit of a greasiness... and it was a little.   The fiance commented that hers was a little bit too salty, and mine was a little peppery (I really like pepper, so that wasn't a bad thing for me).   The fries tasted ok...  better because of the beef fat frying... no, I wouldn't say so.\\n\\nThe server checked in a few times asking about the meal, and if we needed anything else...  you know.. I don't think I've ever had this good a service experience in a burger joint...  I usually don't expect a lot, just a good burger, and a clean table (in that order)... but she was really quite good.  So maybe she's just a really good server, and the people that didn't get good service got a bad one, or maybe they had a talking to about the comments... but our server was GREAT!\\n\\nSo...  the bill came to around $40 after tip for the 2 burgers, fries, and 2 shakes... a little steep for an OK burger, OK fries, and a GREAT shake...  maybe the kind of place to go to every so often, but not regularly (damn... I had high hopes for a regular kind of place for me).\\n\\nNow the bad... I'm not sure what part of the greasy hit towards the end... but after I got home, I just lied on the couch with my stomach churning and rolling... I didn't feel nauseous or anything... the food tasted good, and was pretty good...  but the amount of grease, or maybe my body's lack of beef fried fries for the last 20-30 years had affected me.  I maybe have gone to a 4 (wishing more for a 3 1/2 in the rating system), but after this 'after effect', I have to go with 3, and will probably go VERY rarely to Max's.\\n\\nIn summary...  if you can handle the grease, stomach the prices, or have a craving for the great milkshakes...  Max's is a pretty good place to go.   For me, I think I'll head back to Vera's, or maybe try 5 Guys instead of Max's next time I have a burger craving."},{"name":"H√§agen-Dazs","address":"1148 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Greatest sandwich shop in Boulder.

As a disclaimer, I have NO qualms about going to Minado / Yamato, etc and eating AYCE sushi, because it's a sushi buffet and not O Ya therefore, you get what you pay for.\\n\\nI went on a Saturday night with the bf and we had very low expectations going in; yet, this did not prepare us for the next hour of failure one after another. We were seated within 10 minutes of arriving, and given two glasses of water. While we perused the menu and marked off items we wanted to order, the bf noticed little unidentified floating green bits floating in his water...possibly tea leaves or wasabi.  I peered into my glass and sure enough, when I stirred the cup using the straw I found gross yellow bits floating in my mine - definitely NOT tea leaves or wasabi. We flagged the waitress down and showed her, and she apologized and brought over two new glasses of water. Boyfriend's second glass of water was okay, but mine still had debris in it. SO gross - I gave up on the water for the rest of the meal. How do you mess up water??? Ugh just CLEAN the cups - it's not that hard. If there's food floating in my cup, I don't even want to know what's in my food. \\n\\nThe cooked food arrived shortly after the water debacle and it was by no means fresh. Another yelper likened Su su Sushi quality to that of sushi found at a supermarket counter, and that's probably the most accurate description (granted I've never had supermarket sushi...but it seems fairly similar). The scallop katsu was clearly frozen before so the texture was hopelessly soggy and the scallops were no larger than a nickel. The beef skewer was the strangest thing ever, as it literally had a sliver of meat on it. No joke. Imagine a pocky stick with meat instead of frosting, and that would be the extent of the meat on the skewer. Due to the lack of meat on the stick, it was burnt upon arrival. The grilled beef was ok, but it was covered in sauce as the meat itself didn't seem to have any marinade so the sauce was overcompensating for that. The asparagus and salmon was this odd combination of chopped up asparagus with a thin piece of salmon wrapped on it, which lacked in flavor. Miso and beef sukiyaki soups used the same base and were both equally as bad. There was an abundance of scallions in both soups and the flavor was pretty similar in both soups. The salmon belly we ordered was a semi-soggy mess, and I would've liked to see more of a sear on it to make it crispier. Shrimp tempura was ok. The only redeeming part of the \\"cooked\\" foods was the seaweed salad, but considering it's straight from a box that's probably why. \\n\\nMoving on to the sushi - the sashimi portions were tiny at no longer than one inch of fish and a tiny rice ball underneath. Absolutely miniature. We wouldn't mind the small portions if the quality was there, but in addition to the small size, the fish wasn't fresh and it was sliced extremely thin, and I felt like Susu was just trying to cut corners and save $$. We didn't bother to order any additional food, because quite honestly there was nothing on the menu that was appealing at that point. Susu Sushi was an utter fail and I'm sure that eating greasy fast food next door at Mcdonald's would've been the better choice. \\n\\nTL; DR - I have no clue how this place has 4 star reviews.

The sambal aioli accompanying the green beans is genius, I love Indonesian oily chile sauce, but married into a rich eggy mayonnaise and it transforms into a sauce I want on everything, please!  The trotter croquet was more tamale than croquet, which it identifies itself as, but the two textures together took away from the gentleness of a croquet and the flavor did not make up for it.  The sugar snap pea salad is raw, which I probably should have guessed, though the flavor is very over powering against anything on the plate, be sure you love raw snap peas!  The golden beets dish was nice, and played well together (especially the coffee!) when I could get a good bite, the ricotta to beet ratio was way off.  I would not recommend either of the small plates I tried for the price. \\n\\nThe rabbit and dumplings dish was tasty; tender rabbit, crusty soft dumplings, firmly cooked veggies, and a luxurious sauce that wasn't overly rich on flavor.

I am done paying for shoddy service and food that is completely hit-or-miss, with a decidedly pronounced slant towards \\"miss\\". As a Tucker homeowner, I would love nothing more than to see this place succeed and become a landmark in the community. Instead, I am looking forward to the next restaurant to assume the space currently occupied by the Local No. 7. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself is really nicely executed. Its always clean, and the decor is what you'd expect in what is billed as a gastropub that's a cut-above the norm. Parking is plentiful and easy to access, and the restaurant is nestled in a great location along Tuckers budding downtown main street. Before (or after) your meal, make sure to walk around a bit and wander in some of the other stores. There's a lot of \\"good\\" going on downtown.\\n\\nWalk in, and be seated. Then prepare to wait for 5-10 minutes until a waitress decides you're worthy of her attention. Last night, there were 6 people at the bar, and another 6 at tables. There were three servers working the restaurant. We waited 10 minutes to even be acknowledged. Once the menus were provided, our drink orders from their extensive beer list were taken, and then we sat for another 10 minutes until our beer was returned. So that's 20 minutes from the time we walked in before we even got our drinks. In a restaurant that was mostly empty. \\n\\nOn the upshot, we were entertained by the colorful clientele seated at the bar. No eavesdropping necessary since they spoke loud enough to hear them over the train that passes by 50' from the porch. These folks may have been refugees from the recently torched Tucker dive-bar that burned to the ground a few months ago, but suffice to say, their vocabulary wasn't exactly extensive. Whenever they found themselves lacking for an adjective, inserting \\"F*&King\\", \\"Sh*tty\\", or both seemed to fit whatever tale they were spinning - and management did nothing to quell the river of loud profanity. Out of the 5 times I've been here, 4 of them consisted largely of the same experience with salty, decidedly NOT KID FRIENDLY language. \\n\\nManagement - allowing this sort drunken debauchery doesn't do your establishment any favors. I'd expect this sort of thing after 8 or 9 on a weekend night, but at 6pm on a Sunday? \\"Image sells\\" folks. You're only going to be as acceptable to families as your clientele. Clean it up or you're doomed. \\n\\n\\"Ok, Dan, but what about the food?\\" you ask. I've had the French dip, the reuben, the patty melt, a burger, and the ribs. With the exception of the ribs, everything else was typical 'bar food', which means \\"marginal at best\\". If you're looking for gastropub level food, go elsewhere. This place has nothing on other places like Twains or the Marlay in Decatur. \\n\\nThe ribs were a mixed bag. I ordered a half-rack on one of the nights they made them. Half of them were as dry and chewy as beef jerky, and the other half were actually quite good. Shame they can't cook a meal correctly that they only serve once a week...\\n\\nMidway through gnawing on my ribs, my water ran out and my beer was half gone. I'd have loved another one of each, but my waitress found something better to do because I never actually saw her again. By the end of the meal, both cups were dry and I had to flag down the bartender to even be noticed. \\n\\n\\"More beer?\\" she asked? \\n\\n\\"No, we're done here. Check please\\" I replied.

I loved how you can order single pieces of appetizers so that you don't get full on them. The sashimi was decent quality and the rolls were fine, but any tempura that came out was very soggy which made some of the rolls harder to eat. \\n\\nYou do have to pay extra for certain sashimi such as squid, if you choose to order it.

We have always enjoyed The Fours Quincy location and it's great to have the Norwell location up and running. Anyway, it has been a terrible summer for outdoor dining because the weather has not cooperated until recently. So, we decided to try The Fours for dining outside on this one particularly nice weather evening. It was late in the afternoon / early evening and we half expected a long wait for a table. The parking lot is HUGE and there were a number of cars. At first glance we did notice a collection of people waiting outside for tables and we figured our timing was not right. We stepped inside this cavernous restaurant that can accommodate huge numbers of people. We then asked for the wait time on an outside table and we were told we could get a table right away. It was a great surprise. Apparently, the groups waiting outside were waiting for an inside table. So, first impressions were deceiving.\\nThe food was terrific and the prices were reasonable. We had the calamari appetizer and it was nicely prepared with some chunks of hot peppers mixed into the platter. We opted for a chopped salad and sandwiches... a couple of glasses of chilled white wine and cold beers... it was a good take for the price. I thoroughly enjoyed the ice cold Sam Adams drafts while sitting outside... a nice way to close out a busy Saturday. The service was excellent as well.\\nI am knocking off a star for the minor irritation of the smoking area. It seems there is a waiting area outside for those waiting for tables. This area is a nice spot but it's at the end of the outside dining area. The smoke manages to waft into the dining area and it can be somewhat annoying.

You do get to hear other people's conversations in your proximity, which can be interesting! \\n\\nOnto the food. We started out with the guacamole, which was delicious and a good portion for about $10. It was the right balance of lime, avocado, and tomato and was accompanied by homemade chips. The chips were fantastic- warm, crisp, and thick! They also bring out complimentary bread and three dipping sauces. One is a spicy chili oil sauce (my favorite), citrus infused butter, and escabeche. All had great flavor but the chili oil definitely stood out. The entrees were where I thought it was a bit pricy. They offer three mole sauces and you can choose between steak, shrimp, chicken, or veggies. There is no price differentiation between the options so you pay $30 whether you get a fancy steak or some squash and carrots. My friend doesn't like spice so we ordered the lightest mole sauce- amarillo de oaxaca. It isn't like the traditional mole, which is heavy on the cocoa and chile and is much more liquidy. I caught more hints of tomato than any other taste. It comes with a small scoop of rice and vegetable medley. We also split the chile relleno with black beans and oaxaca cheese. I preferred this dish as the poblano added some spice, the beans and cheese a creaminess, and the rice completed the dish with substance. Still, a bit spendy at $25. \\n\\nOverall, the food was good but I expected something with more gusto for what I paid.

Perhaps they are uninterested in customers sitting around with laptops for hours (I do not know whether this is the rationale), but some will find this situation to be an inconvenience.\\n\\nAnother possible strike against them is their seeming to underplay that they are an all-vegan and all-gluten-free bakery.  In fact, they say that their pastries \\"just happen to be\\" vegan and gluten-free.

The restaurant was very crowded but I was lucky to find a seat in the bar just as a couple was leaving.  They do not take reservations so getting a table if you are in a hurry may be problematic.  On the other hand, I would not have found a table if reservations were necessary, I think.\\n\\nMy server came up almost right away and brought me a pre-concert menu and drinks menu.  The pre-concert menu had about six appetizers and six entrees.  I thought that the variety would please most people.  Appetizers included calamari, spring rolls with a spicy Thai dipping sauce and clam chowder as well as three others I don't recall.  Entrees included a four cheese pizza and a lobster roll w/sweet potato fries, some sort of salad and a few things I don't recall.\\n\\nI ordered the Lobster roll and thought is was very good.  For some reason it came w/regular french fries instead of sweet potato fries, though.  I noticed that everybody had regular fries, though, so I don't think it was an error on my order. I didn't particularly notice that the tarragon added anything to my lobster roll -- I couldn't taste it.  It also had slices of bread & butter pickles which I don't like but did not ask to be removed.\\n\\nThe wine menu had about 4 roses, 3 sparkling wines and 6 or 7 each of red and white wines.  Each selection had reasonably priced choices and a good variety of wines.  I would have liked to see a few more exotic choices but the place does not advertise itself as a wine bar so was not disappointed with what they had to offer.\\n\\nI asked my server (Stejpan) what he recommended and he recommended a nice Sauvignon blanc that is probably what I would have chosen, anyway.  I was glad to see that he did not just recommend the most expensive wine available.\\n\\nThe pre-concert menu did not list desserts but Stejpan easily recited my choices from memory.  I had the dessert trio -- NY cheesecake w/strawberry sauce, chocolate mousse, and creme brulee.  All three were about 6 bites each.  The dessert also came with two little cookies, as well.  It was too much for one person (though I was tempted).\\n\\nThe prices were quite reasonable.   At $23 the lobster roll was the most expensive item on the menu but that price is the norm for this type of restaurant and not much more expensive than other places I've been  The wines ranged from $7-$11 a glass and the dessert trio was $9 which I thought was very reasonable.  I didn't order an appetizer but I think most of them were $6 to $11.\\n\\nAs another reviewer mentioned, an 18% gratuity was added to my tab.  The level of service rated that amount (at least) so I didn't mind.  However, I wish they would have given the option to select a higher amount.  I usually tip 20% for excellent service but won't bother doing the math to add 2% to the total.\\n\\nMy server, Stejpan, was attentive but did not hover.  He was also very good about directing the support staff to my table when they came out with the food, when necessary.  My service may have been better since I was seated quite close to the bar and the computer.  Stejpan seemed very efficient so I suspect that his other tables were well tended, also.\\n\\nOver all I would recommend this restaurant.  I'd probably have a back-up plan in mind if you need to eat but be someplace else on time.  I thought that I was rather lucky finding a table so quickly on a busy Friday night.  I would definitely make this a destination spot, though.  \\n\\nThe restaurant has terrace dining and inside dining.

However, my first time here left me a bit confused.  We were greeted quickly, and seated promptly in the back (as the place seems to be divided into 3 sections: front, patio, and back), but then it got awkward.... After our food was quickly brought out, our server completely ignored us.  Not once did JOHN ask how our food was, and he didn't have to worry about filling our cups as he left a pitcher of water on our table, so we were essentially ignored the entire time.  But, it didn't make sense because the other tables around us were waited on hand and foot!  Like seriously, he HOVERED around them, with his back continuously turned to us.  We didn't know what was going on, it's not that we didn't order enough food or drinks...so after scarfing down the food, we HAILED him down to pay and escape our uncomfortable dining experience. \\n\\nOut of all the tacos (pork belly, milk braised carnitas, and catfish) I enjoyed the pork belly the most.  The pork belly was fatty and the meat was tender but other than that, it was still just pork belly in a tortilla with a fried egg, nothing exceptional.  To be honest, I prefer the tacos from a legit Mexican cart.\\n\\nTruffled Deviled Eggs, provided a generous portion of truffle oiled egg, and I liked the slight crunch you got from the sprinkle of bacon, I just wish they gave you more! \\n\\nChicken Liver Mousse-my favorite part of this was actually the sweet/pickled red onions, simply delicious to cut the saltyness from the mousse and complemented the yummyness of the crostini, the mousse itself was as expected, organy.\\n\\nRosemary Fried Chicken-OH man, when this arrived at our table, I was salivating!  When it arrives, you are greeted by 3 blobs of deliciousness, one being the Texas sized biscuit and two pieces of fried chicken. However, never judge a book by it's cover; the biscuit tasted a bit dry and I couldn't taste the sweet potato...and the fried chicken was fried so much that the outside batter kept falling off the chicken, which also ended up being overcooked.  The honey rosemary sauce on the bottom made up for the dryness and flavorless chicken, but still I guess I expected more.\\n\\nBrussel Sprouts were well fried, but didn't have much in the flavor profile development, and the Eggplant Fries kinda reminded me of a deconstructed eggplant Parmesan, covered with way too much salt.\\n\\nOverall, the food was ok,but if you are not Caucasian, I would avoid Server John."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I just don't understand how you could ever ask for a better meal!

It was an odd-ish experience, kinda like Candid Camera with a sprinkling of Twighlight Zone thrown in. But wait! This is not a bad review! The food was good! Here comes the Twighlight Zone part......The food was TYPHOON! Remember Typhoon?? Theeey're baaaaack! Ok, so here's the deal, we walked in and a guy walks up with menus to seat us and He and I both looked at each other in recognition at the same time....it was the bartender from Typhoon in Beaverton....I enjoyed going there for Happy Hour on may occasions.... I said \\"Hi! and \\"good to see you!\\" and then my friend and I were seated. While we looked at the menu, I noticed another \\"Typhoon\\" employee walk by with a tray. This was starting to feel weird. I told my friend that I felt like I was on Candid Camera. We placed our orders, she got Chicken Pad Thai and I ordered a Green Curry (medium spicy) with Pork. While waiting, I got the opportunity to ask some questions. It turns out that the head chef and some others from typhoon have opened this place. Many of the former employees also work there as well. Ok, enough prying for me. I was starting to feel nosy and rude. I am pleased to say that the food was very good. The  Green Curry sauce was creamy and on the thicker side, which I like. A nice surprise was a large chunk of fresh coconut that  was included in the meat and veggie mixture. It took me a few moments to actually figure out what it was. My friends Pad Thai looked really good, but I did not get a taste. She seemed to enjoy it. The restaurant is very large consisting of two sides, one for dining and the other for bar/dining. It is very clean and kind of sparse with wood laminate floors, colorful art prints on the walls and dark wood tables and chairs that (dare I say) I think were recycled from Typhoon or another restaurant. They were quite scuffed and the chair opposite me looked as if someone had tried to scratch their initials into the surface.

The Northcross Mall isn't hip or glamorous, and it sits in a row of mediocre neighbors next to McAllister's Deli and Saladworks, Sonic and Panda Express.

The food itself was decent, at best, but not worth even half of what they charged.  This place is outrageously expensive for what you get.  I will not be patronizing this place again, ever, nor do I recommend anyone else waste their time.

Ristorante Damiano's is by far my girlfriend and I favorite restaurant. We had dinner there last Saturday evening, though a high top with friends is always fun fighting over tapas.  Call it date night if you will. Anyways. As you walk in the Restaurant it's fun and vibrant, servers bustling around with bottles of wine and specials to recite. I even noticed the owner himself is on the floor greeting, serving, recommending food and cooking of course!!! That is always nice to see, a restaurant with passion. What I love about this place is DUH the food, service and ambiance. I love to go there and just order like crazy. It's Tapas so you have to have at least three, plus there exciting. In one seating you can explore many different tastes which the best part of the experience. If you don't love to share you should begin to here, cause that's were the fun is at Damiano's. Everyone can taste a littlesomething!!! We began with a Carpaccio style beet salad served with arugula, goat cheese, and toasted Pinoli nuts!!! We also shared a few succulent sea Scallops to start it off. After that we decided to split the Spaghettini alla Puttanesca (spicy tomato sauce, capers, anchovy, olives, basil. (I wish I ordered that on my own). Then we finished the night off with a a Filet Mignon in a tangy balsamic vinaigrette and also the Sea Bass wrapped in pancetta over fingerling potatoes!

My recommendation is to order rolls with raw fish such as the Rainbow Roll or any of the nigiri/sashimi.  Getting cooked rolls or dishes that have lots of sauce doesn't do justice to the quality of meat that's served.

Thus, it comes as no surprise that the global Indian restaurant market is also heavily dynastic -- recall the infamous Berkeley Indian restaurant magnate, Deepak Agarwal (a.k.a. Deepak Shakur). During our visit to India Pavilion (IP), in the heart of Central Square in Cambridge, we learned of Deepak's Cambridge counterpart, Mohan Singh, whose territory extends north-south across the heart of the city with ownership of IP, PD, and Froyogi.  IP, the flagship restaurant of the Singh dynasty, opened its doors over 30 years ago, during the dark ages of Central Square.  In fact, the restaurant still displays a prominent sign \\"NO DRUGS\\" -- perhaps a relic from that crime-ridden epoch.  \\n\\nDespite the geographic separation of the Shakur and Singh Dynasties, their bicoastal establishments feature the most critical yet useless element of restaurant d√©cor: the ornate wooden screen hawked by Restaurant Depot. And, like all empire builders, Singh and Shakur understand the importance of diversification: whereas Shakur owned taxi businesses and sought to corner the East Bay spice trade, Singh markets his own brand of Garam Masala, on prominent display at IP in neatly arranged glass jars with mis-oriented labels. Unlike the crude interior of PD, however, IP's interior was immaculate, with comfortable chairs, well arranged tables, a pleasing color scheme, and balanced lighting, attributes befitting the stature of the great Singh dynasty.\\n\\nNotably, IP's kitchen faced the dining area, separated by a transparent window. This allowed us to observe the preparation of our food in real time, and we were pleased by what we saw. The meal began with peshawari nan ($5), which was fresh, tasty, but a tad undercooked. The poori ($4) was plasmatic on arrival, but rapidly deflated, leaving behind less impressive and more doughy morsels upon cooling. The goat curry ($14) was tender and the navrattan korma ($10) was very flavorful with excellent cookitude. Surprisingly, we learned that the aloo gobi, while offered, was an off-menu item. Its omission, though sacreligious, was a good choice, as the dish lacked appropriate potato cookitude and was bland despite our requests for extreme spice levels. The mango lassi ($4) was excellent, with a viscous texture and an essence of kewra, the extract from the flower of a screwpine plant.\\n\\nDespite a few critical missteps, IP is a solid four samosa restaurant with a with a high-end three rupee price tag.  However, despite IP's apparent preeminence, the Singh dynasty, too, will someday fall.  Will it succumb to Mongol invaders, or the slow eastward march of the Shakur empire?  Time will tell, and history will be written by the victors, so experience this jewel before its inevitable plunder!"},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Went with a couple of girlfriends and we loved our app, dinners and dessert.

I much prefer to lift up organizations that I think are awesome. This morning, though, I was so appalled at the service that I have to share this story. While I realize that not many people go to eat by themselves, it seems to me that the problem with the way they handled my complaint is indicative of a larger, customer service issue.\\n\\nHaving lived in Randolph for quite some time, I had heard great things about this local breakfast joint. Every time I drove past, there was always a line out the door, so that seemed like a good sign. I kept looking for the right opportunity to drop in and try their breakfast, a meal that I often eat alone. \\n\\nThis morning, I finally had the opportunity to try it, and there wasn't a line when I walked up to the door, so I was feeling optimistic. Before I could even open the door, though, an older woman asked me how many. \\"One, please, it's just me.\\" \\"Just a second, hon\\" and she closed the door. There was no one behind me in line, and I saw a couple of two-tops available through the window, so I wasn't surprised a few seconds later when she opened the door again and pointed out a table towards the back. \\n\\nThe table was set up next to the cash register...like, right next to it...like it was there as an extra table for menus and such. I sat down. I could have rung in my own order from my seat. I could understand shoving a single eater at a table like that if it was super busy, but there was no one behind me in line, and I could see three open two-top tables. So, I asked the waitress if I could move, and she looked at me with a confused stare \\"Did she seat you here?\\" she asked and I nodded and she bustled off to ask the hostess. When she returned, she told me that no, they couldn't move me to a different seat because \\"there's only one of you.\\" I kinda knew there was only me, I didn't think that meant I would have to sit in the crappiest table, when there were perfectly good two-tops available. \\n\\nI should have gone with my instincts and just left then, but as I said, I had heard such wonderful things. I ordered some tea and the New England Breakfast. When it arrived, I noticed that there were no condiments at my table....no salt, pepper, jam, sugar...funny, you'd think that even at a table where there was \\"only one,\\" a person might like to have those items as well. \\n\\nI will say that my waitress was lovely, and very attentive. She knew it was a bad situation, but again mentioned that I received that table because there was \\"only one\\" of me.\\n\\nBy the way, I know that they do take-out. A woman came up and tried to order from me while I was sitting there.\\n\\nEven the older group of ladies at the table next to me mentioned that I was really crammed in next to the cash register. I told to them that I thought perhaps they wanted me to work the cash register while I ate. They thought that was hilarious, but I wasn't really joking.\\n\\nAs I left, I thought I would mention it to the woman doing the seating, and I asked if I could speak with her. She didn't move from her post at the door, so I told her right there that I didn't think that table was an appropriate place to seat someone, especially when there were perfectly good tables available when I came in the door. She told me that \\"There was only one of you, and I got you in right away, so that's why I had to seat you there\\" I said to her that there were other tables available, and that wasn't really a very good experience at that table, and that I didn't know if I'd want to return. At that point she changed, and practically shoved me out the door. \\"Well, I'm sorry you feel that way, have a good day\\" and that was the only apology I received.\\n\\nI left feeling shaken. Even though there was \\"only one\\" of me, didn't I also deserve good service? Didn't I deserve a table with sugar and jam and salt and pepper? \\n\\nBesides all of that, doesn't it seem to be a bad idea to seat a person right next to where you keep your money, with the cash register swiping card right there in plain sight? Someone's purse was on the second shelf, I think I dropped some of my egg on it...I mean, sorry about that...\\n\\nAnd, finally, in the service industry, if someone is not satisfied with your company, shouldn't you at least want to make it right? Make it better? So that person doesn't go home and tell all of their friends what a crappy place you have?\\n\\nI don't think I'll go again.

So I was eager to check out the brand new Hollywood Casino in Columbus.  Unfortunately, I wasn't as excited after the visit.\\n\\nPros: I won $50 twice on a $1 slot machine.\\n\\nCons: \\n- No hotel.  Not sure if they plan on adding one.\\n\\n- I am used to being able to walk up to the bars on a casino floor and get a bottle of water.  However, when I went to the bar here they looked at me for a second like I had lobsters crawling out of my ears.  Then she said I'd have to get something like that from one of the waitresses walking around.  Very odd.  After it started getting later and busier, they opened up some small beer stations on the casino floor.  While I found that 1 of these did stock bottles of water, the other one did not.\\n\\n- Getting a rewards card was odd.  They didn't have an obvious location to do so.  Instead it was off the casino floor down a hallway in an event center room using a temporary set up.  The signs made it a little easier to find, but still it was odd and confusing seeing as most people kept trying to go in through the exit door (they eventually had to dedicate an employee to assist people with this).  Hopefully this process/location will be changed once they are opened longer.\\n\\n- When I first arrived it was early afternoon on a Saturday (around 1 or 2 pm).  Being a Saturday, I didn't expect to find a $5 roulette table (though it would've been nice), but being so early on a Saturday I did expect at least find a $10 table.  Nope.  They had multiple $25 tables but only a single $15 minimum table, which as you can imagine was obviously completely full and had a line.  I'm not sure if they are just trying to capitalize on being new, but I found it a bit ridiculous not to have a $10 table so early in the day, or at least open up another $15 table to meet demand.\\n\\n- As a follow up to the roulette table, I went in search of an electronic roulette game.  In many casinos today, they will have a nice fancy roulette game that uses an actual spinning wheel and ball surrounded by touchscreens for players to sit at.  Being a brand new casino, that's what I expected.  Nope.  They had the old school single electronic roulette game which is basically like sitting at a slot machine.  And there were only 3 or 4 of them at that.\\n\\nBottom line: While I would say I'd like to go back and try the restaurants/buffet, with Hollywood in Indiana being closer and the Cincinnati casino opening soon, I really don't have a desire to make the trip back up there just for the casino.  Maybe if I'm ever in the area I'll stop by to visit that $1 slot machine again ;)"},{"name":"Gitto's Pizza","address":"120 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Says they deliver Til 5am.

We both had heard of her for a while, but never find ourselves in the area to pay her a visit. \\n\\nWe arrive to the cleanest take out joint I've seen in a long while. The bar off to the left had all kinds of hot sauce and hot peppers under where the letter from Yelp, their Wedding picture, various newspaper reviews clippings, and a personally sent pic of the White House dog hung with the envelope and all. \\n\\nSo we peruse the menu and decided on what we were ordering. By then someone else had stepped in front of us at the counter, which was fine with us, but Mrs. Jones asked US if we were ready. Amazing to think that our order was taken first because we were there first! Fancy that. \\n\\nWe went with 4 different plates, the Turkey wing, Fried chicken wings, BBQ chicken wings, and half of a BBQ chicken with various sides. She even we so far as to ask us how much gravy and what kind we wanted as opposed to do you want some or not. \\n\\nMrs. Jones did not disappoint. The way my 4yo was raving about the fried chicken, made me question my cooking skills, especially since he's the picky one in the family. The turkey wing was super smokey, and the BBQ was sweet an savory. The potato salad is very southern (is that mustard I taste?), yams are to die for, and the corn bread is very dense and did not break into a million little grains when I bit into it. \\n\\nAs for Mr. & Mrs. Jones, they are some great people. They have that Southern Hospitality working for them and serve everything up with a smile. I'll be back soon.

But for how life changing this meal is, I'd go back and proudly proclaim my order at the top of my lungs even if it was called \\"Wowie Zowie Crazy Fun-Time Alfredo\\". \\n\\nLet me start with the foundation of the dish, and work upward from there. The pasta. Oh, the pasta. You could just taste that it was fresh. You could just. TASTE IT. It was on the thick side, but so proportionately appropriate to the dish that every bite was endowed with just the right amount of chewy fresh pasta goodness. \\n\\nOnto the next layer. The meat. There was chicken. There was some kind of sausage. And together it was some kind of beautiful. They both had flavor and distinct texture and added just that extra oomph to the experience, and there was enough of both that you could have meat in every bite. That is deluxe.  \\n\\nBut the star of the show my friends, was the sauce. Now, I love a good alfredo. But in my world, anything I love can be made better by being spicy. I had happened upon my dream food and I didn't even know it. Spicy alfredo has happened to me. And I'm a better person because of it. The sauce was a pale red color that immediately drew me in with it's promising aroma of cream sauce and spice. The first bite, my entire face went slack. It was basically a mini stroke. My bf looked up at me with a crease of worry between his eyebrows and asked if it was ok. I finished chewing and moaned so loudly the people at the table next to us looked over worriedly. But I didn't care, because I was swept off my feet, and nothing was going to stop me from expressing my joy. Every bite was spicy and creamy, with just the right texture from the pasta and the meats, and I had eyes only for you, Crazy Alfredo. You so crazy.\\n\\nMy bf got the Gnocchi and from expertly flavored marinara to the soft fluffiness of each gnocchi, he loved every bite of it. I managed to sneak in a few bites as well between my Crazy Alfredo ecstasy and totally agree that it was the best gnocchi I've ever had. And I've been to Italy, folks. \\n\\nYou need to eat here.

Started out with a delicious salmon croquette from the kitchen before our first course, which was basically fish and chips without the chips. Really well battered and fried halibut that somehow was not greasy. Next came the elk carpaccio. Probably my least favorite of the courses - good concept but the meat was too lean and leathery to be as tender as a good carpaccio is. The third course was an *amazing* heirloom tomato soup. I don't know how they did it, but I want the recipe. My main was seared scallops with sweet potato ravioli while my date had the beef wellington. We're talking an entire 6-8oz steak wrapped in puff pastry. Enormous. Finally, a pumpkin pot-du-creme and apple tartin to round out the meal. Reall tasty all around. My only complaint, if I had one, is that the portions are too big. Hard to believe, but true. When I return.

Roxy was also the reason why the experience here went well, a very deserving 4-stars to say the least - - I'm definitely a fan. \\n\\nThe pizza quality isn't as good as I remember, however, it's still respectable compared to other pizza establishments.  You can't go wrong with their Crazy Bread - always a hit with extra garlic butter and cheese (to coat your arteries).

They also crank out the large 1 topping round version for $5.99 here.  \\n\\nOn this visit with a friend we were craving a piece of history and stopped in on a whim one late Friday night to put in an order for the new Square Deal.  Roxy greeted us - she was very professional and courteous.  There were several patrons waiting for their order, we figured it would take 20-30 min, but Roxy said 10-15 min which sounded better.  Wouldn't you know she was right.  15 min later our pizza was out hot and fresh along w/ the breadsticks.  I opened it up to take a looksie - - very nice, and it tasted just like the good 'ol days.  \\n\\nRoxy makes it happen here, she was a jack of all trades, dealing w/ impatient customers, packaging pies up asap and working w/ her crew in the back on prioritizing orders.  She knew her stuff and was flawless, she said she's been w/ LC for over 8 years so that made sense.

Sometimes walking through the small streets of the North End you feel bombarded by \\"Best Pizza Here!\\", or \\"Best Chicken Parm Here!\\", or \\"Best Cannolis Here!\\". You are forced to judge a book by its cover since it is so hard to find legitimacy behind all the claims. Fortunately, the many Yelpers before me gave LFG great legitimacy and allowed me to walk into one of the best meals I've ever had. \\n\\nI was himming and hawing about what I wanted to get. To be honest there was about a dozen things I wouldn't have minded trying, but I finally decided on the frutti di mare with the fra diavolo sauce. I was 110% happy with my decision. Do yourself a favor and look at some of the pictures of this monstrous meal and I guarantee you'll be drooling like a bloodhound sitting across the table from a fresh steak. The pasta was cooked perfectly (I don't claim to be a pasta aficionado), as was the seafood (not chewy at all), and the fra diavolo sauce was the perfect spicy tomato sauce to go along with these fruits of the sea. Suggestion, either wear a dark colored shirt or tuck a napkin into your shirt and go mafia boss style unless you want to be wearing that red sauce (or maybe I'm just an amateur). \\n\\nLFG is a place that you take your friends and family who are visiting to for a real (delicious) taste of Boston and a real taste of the North End."},{"name":"TenOak","address":"409 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"A great bar in the warehouse district of Austin.

Let me get to the star of the night...\\n\\nWe got half onion rings and half fries. These were the best onion rings I've ever had! Not overly breaded and the onions used were nice and thick - they didn't slip out when you took a bite, yay! Also, their ranch is amazing! Some of the best I've ever had. And of course, the fries are yummy as well - nice and crispy :)\\n\\nFor beer they had a Breakside Pilsner on HH, which was great!

We sat, and 10 to 15 minutes later she had 14 top seated.  She took drink orders of 14 tops even before any of our drinks were served.  She also added 18% gratuity, which I felt she didn't deserved.  Everything she did took forever.  But i simply wanted to get out of the restaurant.  \\n\\nFood preparation was very poor.  Their hot wings are something in past.  Wings were dried.

Of all things we ordered, the black eyed peas tasted the best. I also enjoyed the crunchy crusty part of the no-nonsense macaroni and cheese. It was not the gourmet \\"macaroni and bechamel sauce with 5 blends of cheese\\". I think it just contained the bright orange cheddar cheese. \\n\\nThe rest was unfortunately barely passable.The meager catfish were completely encrusted with thick cornmeal batter that I felt like what I was eating deep-fried cornmeal sticks with some catfish skin. The green tomatoes were sliced so thinly that, again, it was mostly the batter part that you'd be eating. I usually love candied yams, but their yams were like sugar lumps. They were extremely sweet and should be consumed as a dessert item.\\n\\nWe still ordered a slice of sweet potato cheesecake. I didn't care for the texture (too mushy), but I liked the flavour and crunch from pecan bits. The quality of whipped cream was rather disheartening.

If you aren't very familiar with asian cuisine, don't expect to recognize much on the menu. If you don't like to experiment, then this might not be for you.

The barista made the americano exactly how i requested with lots of extra ice and extra room (many places get that wrong). She was very nice and make a damn good drink. The man who made my biscuit and took my order (I am assuming he is the owner) made it to perfection and it is out of this world. It is like a gyro on a breakfast biscuit. I always enjoy savory breakfast options more than sweet and really appreciate when a coffee shop has a quick and delicious savory option. I've also tried thier scones which are always super fresh and fantastic.  The other day when i went it was only the owner there and his customer service was fantastic. He actually came out from behind the counter and held the door open for me when i left. You can tell they really care about the quality of their product and the happiness of their customers. The attention to detail and easy going environment makes for a wonderful morning experience. I was a barista for years and today i was watching the Barista make a latte for another customer. Her foam was perfect and latte art was gorgeous. I personally am not one for lattes but i could tell that she made some of the best that the coffee world has to offer. \\n\\nBasically this place is amazing and i would go there everyday if i could.

It's as though the employees are perpetually new. I've been there a half-dozen times or so over the last few years, and I usually know more about the menu than they do. But, this is easily overlooked.\\n\\nI like this style of service: ordering at the counter, you get a number, get your drink, and the servers bring the food out to your table. Perfect when you don't want to spend a lot of time (or cash) at a full-service restaurant, but you get more comforts than a fast-food joint. \\n\\nThe menu changes often with seasonal selections. There's something here for everyone. Choose from the Asian, Mediterranean, or American menus, or mix n' match! \\n\\nOne of my favorite things on the menu is the Potstickers, listed separately under \\"Sides\\" instead of in one of the ethnic headers. \\n\\nIt's also a great place to go if you're trying to eat healthier. The salads are unique enough where you don't just think \\"I would have made this at home\\" (though you certainly could) but they are fast and inexpensive. \\n\\nAnother thing about this location: I really like this particular plaza for some reason. For awhile there was a Papa Murphy's and a Qdoba, which are other Colorado-based chains. There is a decent nail place, a men's spa, and a drive-thru Timmy Ho's.

There are two sides available, and as much as I tell myself to try the mac-and-cheese, I always go with the baked beans with french fries. And an order of garlic bread.\\nBeing on Semoran Boulevard near the airport and hotels, this place is always busy at dinner time. The dining room area has tables for two to a table large enough for families. Not including Uncle Waldo and Aunt Emma. There are televisions throughout the dining room, and either ESPN, CNN, or a sports game is on. Since the dining room is busy, I always go to the lounge.\\nAs you enter Sonny's, there is a host/hostess station to your left, and benches to the right for those waiting for a table. In between this area is a entrance to the lounge. It is a full liquor bar with beer available on draft. Try a Sonny's red lager when you get a chance. But if you just have to have that sweet tea or soda, that is available as well. There is also several televisions throughout the lounge area, and the entrance to outside seating is across the bar on the building's south side.\\nOne problem I do have in regards to sitting at the bar is the servers. I always get good service, and my food comes out in a timely manner. But whenever I am seated at the bar, the person working the bar never introduces his/herself. I am not told about any specials from the bar or kitchen. And after ordering, they proceed to walk around the bar, either cleaning glasses or checking stock. Never a \\"how are you doing\\"? And only a few times have I had them ask if I would like more of this or anything else. Even when getting the AYCE special, you usually have to get their attention to order more.  On one visit long ago, a bartender took my plate and utensils and proceeded to put it in the dishpan without even asking me if I would like any more chicken. On my visit yesterday, there were two bartenders available, and neither one introduced himself. One of them talked with a regular customer a few seats down about \\"wanting to go home\\". I will admit, the other bartender asked me if I would like more ribs. That was nice.\\nIf you are dining by yourself, like I always am, it's nice to have someone at least say \\"hello\\" or \\"how was your day\\".

And for some reason, if you are a single male wanting a seat in the dining room, they always put you in the section with a waiter. Why is that?\\nAll in all, the food is always good.

It was a pleasure for this spud lover to see that it came with a side of their homefries, so of course I accepted his considerate offer of ketchup.\\n\\nTheir ketchup was no Heinz.  It was less processed (not as smooth), but the allegiance of my taste buds are to that of the 57 Varieties.

Before deciding on coming here we had another place in mind, the regular place Black and Blue. I did my research, i looked online, i asked around...then i started to worry. The feedback i got back from my friends were not very good. I even had one friend saying that her meal was over 300$ and it was only comparable to the keg or worse. Don't get me wrong I love the keg, but this is top dollar steak so i expect a top dollar meal! We started with the calamari, tenderloin carpaccio, and black & blue ahi tuna. We enjoyed all 3, however there are two items i can compare to Black & blue. At Black & Blue the carpaccio and calamari is a better deal (cheaper), more flavourful, not as plain as you would get here (they have capers on their carpaccio!!! Also its all in the seasoning). At Black & blue The plump calamari fills the plate here it just fills a bowl, here the carpaccio breaks when you try to pull it off the place because its way too thin and doesn't have enough substance to be able to eat a full piece at a time. It drives me crazy! I'm not sure if would come back for appies. I think i would just go for the kill and order the steak. I'm not sure if my friends visited on an off day (which would bother me, because the restaurants i always frequent are the ones that are consistent...consistency in service and food quality are very important to me) but the porterhouse was AMAZING. It was the best piece of meat that ive had in a long time! And i frequently eat steak. The short loin was juicy, succulent, tender, the tenderloin was melt in your mouth tender and juicy. IT was so good i cannot NOT write a review about it. I am excited to be able to come here again and praying that it will be just as delicious the next time. The one thing that really bothered me about this place is that we arrived at 15:00 planning on doing dinner as well as happy hour, unfortunately unlike other places for happy hour you can ONLY order off the happy hour menu and not anything else. We had to go back and walk around the mall for another 2 hours before we could eat and we were already hungry. I wish they would have specified that online. Happy hour isn't worth it if its so restricted and the only thing we wanted on that menu was the black and blue tuna. We ended up just paying the full price during dinner. I would come back again, but not during happy hour because i love eat too much."},{"name":"Thai Bloom","address":"3800 SW Cedar Hills Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"Went to Thai Bloom today with friends for lunch and it was delish!!

Sadly we were mistaken. It took 2 1/2 hours before we were able to order our food. This was mostly due to the fact they seemed to have people order for entire companies in line (one person walked away with 6 bags full of brisket). I really think a limit / per person should be put on the order. This would allow to not only speed the line, but also ensure more people got to try the food.\\n\\nAs for the food, it did meet my expectations. The brisket had a nice smoke ring and the burnt ends (on request) weren't overly cooked (hard to accomplish). The ribs were good, and had a nice peppercorn rub. The slaw is not worth buying. \\n\\nOverall I'm glad I tried here, but I won't be coming back as I can't justify the overly inflated lines which could easily be remediated by proper time management skills."},{"name":"Oyatsupan Bakers","address":"16025 SW Regatta Ln","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4.5","text":"Nice Space to have a snack and tea.

While the service, drinks, and d√©cor(downstairs) received top marks, there was the other end of the spectrum when it came to some of the meals and the ambiance provided in the upstairs dining room. One diner stated that  \\"If you're going to put a southern staple on your menu in Boston, then you better bring your A game.  Unfortunately, the pimento cheese was sort of bland and lacking. \\" . The scotch eggs got mixed reviews from bland as can be to interesting and tasty. There also was no dessert menu to the chagrin of someone who was holding out for a sweet treat.  \\"I feel like this place is two different restaurants in one. Downstairs was awesome! Lively scene, gorgeous mahogany bar, delicious and innovative cocktails. It had a dimly lit warm, cozy vibe. Upstairs not so much\\"  from another. The thing that was agreed upon by all was that the service was solid and worth heading back to for a check up on the potent potables that make up the namesake.\\n\\nINDIVIDUAL DINER REVIEWS\\n\\nThe Scotch Eggs were interesting made with chorizo. It was a bit overpowering but still tasty. I like the egg hard boiled but enjoyed the runny soft boiled yolk. The burger was cooked perfectly though the Pimento Cheese was lost in the fray. Sadly, the fries were a bit sparse. Cocktails were spot on. Service was too! The d√©cor downstairs was exactly what I thought with a name like Hops n Scotch; a great, cozy pub feel to it. Upstairs seemed to be an afterthought and nothing to write home about. I'll be heading back to sit at this bar for sure. \\n--\\n I had the Fall Old Fashioned, and it was delicious; I could have had 3 of them and called it a meal.  The Fall Salad was hearty but could have been tossed a little better; there was a giant pile of spinach underneath the rest of the fixings.  The steak was cooked perfectly, however the saut√©ed vegetables were on the oily side, and lacking flavor.  The decor was meh.  I'd go back to check out the scotch and ale lists.\\n--\\nFood was adequate but not stellar.  If you're going to put a southern staple on your menu in Boston, then you better bring your A game.  Unfortunately, the pimento cheese was sort of bland and lacking.  It had all the spiciness you'd expect from a New England establishment...  I thought the liquor selection was top notch, so I'd go back for drinks.  I echo the sentiment of others that the downstairs had a really nice vibe, but upstairs was an afterthought.  Service was solid.\\n--\\nThe food was surprisingly good (my expectations were low for pub food).  Although, come to think of it, even though I was initially impressed by the quantity of salad and berries on my plate as well as the presentation, the freshness was something to be desired; they were kind of wilty and limp (s'thing none of us like...)  I did enjoy the salmon, quite fresh and grilled nicely, and the cocktail was quite tasty- nice interesting choices for them. Didn't really expect much from d√©cor.\\n--\\nI feel like this place is two different restaurants in one. Downstairs was awesome! Lively scene, gorgeous mahogany bar, delicious an innovative cocktails. It had a dimly lit warm, cozy vibe. Upstairs not so much (light on the decor and much brighter). I enjoyed my scotch eggs -- runny on the inside and obscenely crunchy on the outside. My burger was cooked well and I love that it came on a buttery brioche bun though the pimiento cheese I ordered on top of it was lost. Service was great. My water glass was constantly filled and everything came out hot and at the same time. Would definitely come back for drinks and apps. Oh and maybe a dessert (since it IS published on their website tsk tsk).\\n--\\nI only had the mac n cheese con chorizo, to base my food rating on.  It was ok, very middle of the road.  I enjoyed the space very much, I could hear the entire conversation at the table even though the place was full.  I didn't really notice any decor, although it did have the standard TV playing ESPN, not sure if they were going for sports bar, or not.  Definitely worth going back for an in depth look into the scotch part of their name (alcohol, not eggs).  Also, dessert menu? \\n--\\nOverall it was boring. Boring d√©cor, boring rather bland food.  The scotch eggs were runny (which I prefer over the hard boiled version) but the \\"house-made chorizo\\" they were encased in was bland as can be (for really REALLY tasty scotch eggs, head to The Gallows), my drink was also weak and tasteless, and the mushroom and Swiss burger with added bacon was a big pile of indistinctness, along with poorly executed fries. The only redeeming feature was a competent friendly waiter, and excellent company. I'd say this is more a \\"drinking and apps\\" place than a restaurant.

What a shame, because I have been missing out!\\n     My husband and I went to here during Yelp Restaurant week for dinner (can't beat 30% off). It also ended up being during Happy Hour. I made a reservation a couple days ahead of time. When we walked in, we were taken to our table- a nice, cozy booth. There was a sign with my name on it on the table, which I thought was a nice touch and made us feel welcome. Our server came over right away with waters. She gave us a chance to look over the menu then came back for our drink orders.\\n     They have a happy hour menu (goes til 6:30) which includes drinks (beer, wine, sake) as well as a good variety of food items. My husband ordered a beer- only $3. For appetizers, I ordered a seaweed salad. We also got the volcano roll and king kong roll. The seaweed salad was a small portion but it was only $3. It was good but didn't blow me away. The sushi was delicious. The volcano roll of course is a little messy with the toppings, but soooo good. The king kong roll was also very tasty. Everything tasted very fresh.\\n     For the main course, I ordered the spicy seafood ramen. I was feeling a little under the weather so I figured some spicy soup would hit the spot. My husband ordered the tacos off the HH menu. They have korean or General tso's. He chose Korean BBQ. We figured the tacos would be small but my ramen would be big, so we could share.  We were wrong!! The tacos plate came with 3 tacos which were stuffed. My husband did not leave hungry (and I didn't have to share too much of my ramen). He really liked his meal. My spicy ramen was amazing. It was a generous portion with tons of seafood- big juicy shrimp, scallops, squid, and an egg... as well as lots of noodles. It was also pretty spicy. I had enough left over for dinner the following night... and I felt so much better after eating my soup.\\n     We were too full for dessert. But we both enjoyed our meals.

We saw no one AGAIN until someone ELSE (we're on staff member #3 now...) brought us our appetizers an additional 25 minutes later (if you're doing the math, we'd been there almost an hour by this time).  We finished our food and drinks, and the first waitress came by to say, \\"Do you want to order anything else, or do you want the check?\\" ...what service.  Then, THEY INCLUDED AN 18% GRATUITY FOR TWO PEOPLE!  It turns out, there was a disclaimer on the menu, so they covered themselves, but now I know it's because their service was deplorable.

Both bartenders saw us, took orders and food to tables around us, but neither came up. Finally my sister just stood up and walked over to the female bartender and asked is we had a server. The words out of her mouth next...\\"Oh, I didn't see you guys there\\"...I was like mentally to myself-You looked right at me and I smiled at you twice, so really I don't see how you missed my big 6 foot ass standing there and then sitting there. I don't disappear easily. So that was their first strike.\\n\\nBeer: Decent selection of bottled beer, nothing crazy, but for the area they have a good distributor and who ever is in charge of picking the selection, clearly enjoys beer. What they have on draught is pretty much the basics, with maybe two that would be considered craft or small batch brewing. Overall I am impressed and pleased. The rest is just all standard and their shots are kitschy and fun, but more mixer than anything. I'm there for the beer....and tots.\\n\\nFood: I LOVE TATER TOTS! So any where that I can get them, I do. The portions are decent for the price point, I have seen in other reviews were they mentioned a shortage, so it must have been adjusted.\\n\\nWe ordered the following:\\n\\nAppetizer: Tot Stack\\nTater tots smothered in Brunswick stew, cheese and purple onions. The tots get mushy after a few minutes because of the stew, the raw purple onions just don't need to be on their at all. They don't compliment the dish at all and are too \\"spicy\\" in their raw form and just over power everything..strike 2. The Stew is pretty good.\\n\\nMeals:\\nChili Cheese Dog Basket with Sweet Potato Fries\\n(2) Build your own burgers one with a side of tots(mine) and with a side of onion rings(bros).\\n\\nThe Burgers are fresh, unless they manage to bring in a special high quality frozen meat patty. My guess is they just use a press to make sure all the patties are uniform and at the 1/2 pound ration. The seasoning they use is on the salty side, but really doesn't make the patty taste bad. We enjoyed the burgers and I would order any of the burgers again and enjoy it. Our server forgot my bacon and my brothers sauce...strike 3.\\n\\nMy sister enjoyed her hotdogs and they looked really good from across the table. Once again the raw purple onion was just to strong of an onion selection for her dish and she ended up picking them off. She enjoyed her cole slaw which is the mayo/sugar variety; personally is the only slaw I think should be allowed. Her side of sweet potato fries were nicely seasoned and good quality.\\n\\nOnion rings were a shock, I wasn't expecting a hand battered and fried version to come out. They weren't the thick cut and not the shoe string version either, but a nice middle ground. It was more onion then batter, which I like and the two I was able to snipe from my bother's plate were seasoned well and tasted great.\\n\\nI am sure we will end up back here again since my family seems to enjoy the place, and really considering its location its a nice change of pace. Hopefully my second go around will be better and I will update to 4 stars."},{"name":"Thai Bloom","address":"3800 SW Cedar Hills Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"I am not a big fan of Thai food, but this place is amazing.

Upon arrival we entered into some sort of high school grab A$$ game between the host, server and a delivery guy. All young gentlemen. The delivery driver was getting an order to go, the server then needed money exchanged from his sever bank and all the while the host just seemed overwhelmed with the \\"OMG?\\" attitude. YES we are still standing their waiting to be seated. Over two minutes, this seems like not so long, but the restaurant only had two other tables of people. We were finally seated and waited forever for the same server to come to the table and drop off the menu's. 10 MINUTES later he finally came to take our drink order and we ordered the food as well. Meanwhile the busser had a handful of tableware and was literally dropping them onto the table as he was setting it, echoing thru the whole restaurant. The decor of the dining room was pleasant, upscale and inviting, with Frank Sinatra and other \\"Big Band\\" music playing over the speakers {interesting} considering the venue. The food arrived quickly and plate presentation was wonderful. I ordered the \\"Drunken Halibut\\" which I have never had before, BUT I really had to look at the Halibut to tell if indeed it WAS halibut and not Chicken. It was VERY dry and had the consistency of Chicken, DRY CHICKEN! Although the flavors were very pleasing to the palate, I would only hope that it was a fluke that the halibut was so dry. My friends \\"Drunken Noodle\\" looked and tasted fabulous and again the plate presentation was top notch. So? would I go back?

I am always game to try an upstart food vendor, and was pretty excited that Peached was going to be near my work today. Three tacos later and...sigh. I so wanted the food to be better than it actually was.\\n\\nThe Bahn Mi taco was by far the best of the bunch, with a nice dialogue between the fatty pork, the pickled veg, and the spicy mayo. The spice came through without overpowering the meat; every bite was balanced.  I definitely would order this again.\\n \\nThe other two tacos were underwhelming. The catfish in my Crunchy Catfish taco was off. It was muddy, but also too fishy. Now I know that catfish taste can vary depending on the source and the prep, but this fish was just not good. I *love* fried catfish so it was a major disappointment. The crunchy coating had great texture that contrasted well with the blob of greens in the middle of the taco (spread those out mayhaps?), but it could not save the fish.  The Southern Squash taco was a bland veggie mess, especially in comparison to the other choices. I wished for some kind of bite to offset the sweetness.\\n\\n\\nThe portion sizes also disappointed, even though I'd been warned to expect tiny bites in reviews here and elsewhere. I'm sure every one of you reading this has your own favorite, um, authentic taco truck that can fill you up for $5-6. Unfortunately, I can't eat barbacoa or al pastor all the time (as delicious as they are and as much as I'd want to). Variety is good...but tacos are also tacos and they should be filling. I expected more food in each taco. (Seriously, there were three lady-hand knuckle-sized pieces of catfish in the taco. That's it.) I did like the fact that they double-wrapped the corn tortillas, but places like Izzoz and Torchy's are a better value for your $ in terms of the amount of food you get. I can't afford to buy lunch out every day of the week, so when I do, I don't want to be hungry three hours after eating *three* tacos. But I was. And that's just not right.\\n\\nEric, the owner, was pleasant and efficient. Hopefully the portions/sourcing/etc. is still being worked out; after all, this place has only been open a couple of weeks."},{"name":"Hops N Scotch","address":"1306 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"I still have to try to food at this place, but I've been there I think four times now for drinks, and I like it. Great, great beer selection with some very nice go-to options plus a rotating crop of other stuff. The food that I've seen other people around me eat does look really good if that tells you anything. The bar area is comfortable with a nice decor, but it fills up pretty easily. They seem to have a ton of seating upstairs, so I wonder why they don't just make the whole first floor a bar and then the second floor for people eating dinner. \\n\\nAnyway, just picking nit here. Friendly staff, service is pretty good, prices are a tiny bit high but appropriate for the vibe they're going for I guess. Definitely would go back. Good spot for a first or second date definitely.

The soft, warm Greek pita managed to hold most of the filling in place. Overall, a success!\\n\\nI would have liked to see just a bit more tomato and onions here for a more colorful presentation and a more refreshing bite. But I really liked the large lamb portions...that should be the star here anyway! I did not see hot sauce condiments at Aybla; adding hot sauce would enhance this dish tenfold for me.\\n\\nThe service was a bit slow...it took me a few minutes to get their attention.

We ordered four pizzas for a birthday celebration to-go. Upon opening the boxes up, we realized it was not our order or the order was wrong (none of the pizzas were 100% correct). When we called back, the manager was very friendly, apologized and said they would re-make our pizzas and give us a refund, so they took down the orders again. We drove back with the wrong pizzas, dropped off the wrong pizzas and picked up the new ones. Given, one of the employees went through the pizzas there, but I was just the one picking them up so it looked good to me (not going to examine all the pizzas at the restaurant...). Upon getting back home, two of the pizzas were wrong again, note that one of them had an extra topping which isn't a big deal, but the other had BEETS instead of GROUND BEEF. We called back and when the manager got on the phone, he was very aggressive saying the second pizzas were 'pretty much' the same ones we just returned. That's fine, beets sounds like beef, but then gave us a extremely hard time actually giving us the refund (yet to be seen...will be looking at the statement every day until it happens). Inevitably, the manager said he would in fact give us the full refund, but this experience was just simply not worth it.

So we decided on La Barbecue. It was pretty easy to find parking as it is right by residential streets. La Barbeque is a food truck with picnic tables and umbrellas set up outside. By the time we got there around 11, there was already a line but it wasn't too bad...until it started raining! We almost left to go elsewhere but luckily we decided to just suck it up and stay in line. Also someone was nice enough to lend us her umbrella to use. People in Austin are so nice!! We were probably in line for an hour and a half before we were able to order. There is also free beer you can get while you are waiting in line or sitting down to eat. How awesome is that!! Anyways we got 2 beef ribs, 1/2 lb brisket, and a side of potato salad to share between us 3 girls. \\n\\nOMG...the portions were huge especially the beef ribs!! We probably would have been good with ordering just 1 rib. The meat from the beef ribs was literally fall off the bone. It was soooo good and tender with a excellent bbq flavor to it. The brisket was also really tender and just so juicy!! I drizzled some of the sweet bbq sauce they had on the table over my meat and that just really hit the spot! Yummmm!! The potato salad was really refreshing and helped balance out the saltiness of the meats. We had so many leftovers after, which we just packed back for our late night munchies for after hitting up 6th street. Loll...anyways my friends and I highly recommend this place!! It is definetely a must try and we also got to meet a lot of nice people here! =)"},{"name":"Arugula","address":"2785 Iris Ave","city":"Boulder","stars":"3.5","text":"So after moving to Boulder from NYC in April my wife and I have finally found our go-to \\"neighborhood\\" restaurant and it is Arugula.

We got there right at 5 and snagged a table under the patio; I'm glad we swooped in like early birds because it was a warm, sunny, humid afternoon and the place filled up FAST. We all enjoyed cocktails which were carried out wonderfully. Then we started the free fall of ordering just about everything on the menu. Since it changes so frequently there is probably little sense in describing everything in detail but it was all well executed and most importantly, delicious! \\n\\nI think, from what I've read, one of the mainstays might be the crispy green beans? They were surely good... a little too easy to eat! But our favorite appetizer was definitely the pickles. Surprisingly they were not pickled cucumbers like I was expecting but other pickled vegetables - cauliflower, daikon, tomatoes. Really tart little bites of spring in Texas. We also had the special, a pork dish that was gigantic, and myriad vegetables served up beautifully. I think there were some mussels thrown in there somewhere along the way... and the white bean dip. We cleared many a plate!   \\n\\nAdditionally, and this may seem silly, parking is so delightfully hassle free it makes me giddy.\\n\\nThe table set by Contigo is very congenial.

I had the salmon BLT on bun with a side salad and my boyfriend had the smoked wings and tots. Both were delicious. I have no complaints about the food. The wings were crispy and meaty and cooked well through. Some people don't like larger meaty wings so that may be an issue depending upon preference. The service was good. The gentleman was friendly, attentive without being obnoxious, and gave me a good recommendation of the salmon BLT. We went for lunch and it wasn't crowded or noisy.

If you ever go there, NEVER try that drink...unless you want to see what crap tastes like.\\n\\nIf you don't already know (I'm sure you do), this is a sushi buffet restaurant. They give you a check-list paper with all the sushi and food and you tell them the quantity you want (like Yomato). It's pretty straight forward, and we ordered a bunch of food. WARNING: Do not order more than you can eat, because they WILL charge you. \\n\\nOverall, the sushi was fresh and each piece was similar in size (it matters because I know alot of places that have inexperienced sushi chefs and each piece is of different shape and sizes). The best one was the Snow Mountain sushi, you MUST try it if you go there.The kitchen food (appetizers) was also very delicious. They give big portions, even if its seaweed salad, fried rice, or noodles.\\n\\nSo why is it only 3 stars? Originally, I was going to give it 4 stars, but, a couple of my friends ordered drinks and one of them found a bug in it! Yes, a dead freaking bug. We told them and they changed it out which is a plus. Another thing that kind of bothered me, was that one of the servers gave us an attitude when we requested for spicy mayo...and even throughout our stay, she seems like she hated her job.

I was walking around Boston's Chinatown looking for a good food deal.  Since I'm able to read Chinese, I saw a sign in Chinese that said twin lobsters for $15.95.  I went in and saw that the dining room was nice and roomy and that most of the patrons were Asian.  The dining room was three-quarters full on a Tuesday night. \\n\\nI ordered the twin lobster, clams with black bean sauce, and the yang chow fried rice.  Here's the scoop:  The twin lobsters were definitely satisfying, however, I noticed that one lobster was significantly larger than the other.  Since the first lobster had a decent amount of meat, I really didn't mind.  I had it prepared with ginger and scallion. Compared with the other Boston restaurant I tried with a twin lobster special (Vinh Son), it was done much better, due to the nice glaze on each  lobster piece.  The clams were a nice size, about the size of your thumb.  The black bean sauce was more brothy, but it didn't detract from the flavor.  As for the yang chow fried rice,  the rice was good quality, however the bits of char siu they had put into the rice were a bit large.  Besides, yang chow fried rice normally uses ham, not roast pork.  Despite this shortcoming, the rice was still good due to the good quality rice (I think it was extra long grain). \\n\\nSo there you have it, another good experience in a Chinese restaurant in Boston!"},{"name":"The Red Wagon","address":"2128 East Hastings Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"We were actually looking for a different restaurant on Hastings, but we couldn't find it so we stopped here instead.

Well, we were having dinner down the street, so I just yelped for a dessert place nearby, and voila - Dizin FruttiBerri!\\n\\nThe shop was staffed by a cheerful welcoming fellow who offered me sample cups - ah, he knew the way to my heart!  So I sampled all 7 flavors they had that day: Rose Water and Zafran Traditional Persian Ice Cream, Vanilla, Chocolate, Mango, Taro, Pomegranate, Coconut.  I found a few to be rather icy, so the day's winners in my book were the Rose Water and Zafran, Vanilla, and Taro.  Admittedly, this was a bit of a shocker to me, since I had been convinced last year that perhaps Rose Water was just not one of my things.  Perhaps it is only the case when the use of the flavor is too heavy handed... good to know!\\n\\nTopping included 5 types of fruit, and a variety of candies, cereals, and nuts.  I opted out since I tend to match my creamy goodness with toppings, and these didn't quite do it for me.  But still I came out with 7.2 oz in my cup for 49 cents per ounce.\\n\\nBut as we sat enjoying our frozen treats in one of a handful of seats, a (returning) couple came in and got their cup filled halfway special from the back room, so curious me, I chatted with them and took a peek, and saw an interesting pink concoction generously studded with thin white strands.  It was Faloodeh, and those worms?  Rice noodles.  I tried the pink version (sour cherry) and found it a nice sherbetlike treat and so good with the other froyo flavors in my cup.  But I noticed it in white (plain, aka lime), rosewater, well, in a variety of colors and flavors in the freezer, packed and ready to go.  The shopkeeper assured me that his Faloodeh is gluten free and dairy free.\\n\\nThey are open till 9pm most nights, and have a single unisex bathroom - great for handwashing for when you need more than the gel sanitizer that they have readily available.

Good start!\\n\\nSo I order the small cheeseburger and the smallest size of fries they have.  I see there is a nice choice of condiments and toppings to put on the burger.  I went simple and just got lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise.  Total (without a drink, mind you) came out to $7.45.\\n\\nI have a seat and wait for my number to be called.  And when it was, I went to the pick up area, where a guy was ready to hand me the bag.  Then, another guy stopped him because, apparently, they didn't put the fries in.  Good catch, dude!  I'd hate to leave without the 'famous fries'.  The sad thing is that the guy just dumped the contents of his little metal pan into my bag.  Literally dumped it in!  It was just a pile of loose fries in the bag.....which made the bag immediately greasy...yuck!  Thanks, guys.\\n\\nOh well, moving on!  I grabbed a few napkins and headed outside to a table.  So I take a seat and dig through a mass of molten lava fries attempting to unearth the burger. \\n\\nOoops!  They didn't wrap the burger up in the foil.  There was a mangled piece of foil partially wrapping the burger, so when I made a grab for it, in the mound of fries, it just fell apart.  So now I have a bun with nothing in it and a mayo slobbered cheeseburger patty slopped on top of the fries.  Gross!\\n\\nGood thing I grabbed extra napkins!  After re-assembling the burger, I gotta say that the meatr itself had a really nice taste to it.  It was very good!  The bun was \\"eh\\".  The tomatoes were nice and fresh...not the soggy old things some places give you.  But overall, it was a bit pricey for the size.\\n\\nOnto the fries!  I didn't like them at all.

I'm no stranger to the salad from Chipotle and is always served a generous portion from the original Downtown location, but I felt ripped off from what I was given this time round.\\n\\nThe way Chipotle works is like going down a fast-paced factory line of cafeteria workers. I know that I should be offered pinto or black beans in my salad, but the staff went from putting my lettuce in, straight to the proteins. I assumed that she was going to ask about the beans after but the next staff member was already scrambling to finish my order as soon as the previous one served my protein. I didn't want to hold up the line so I went along with it and decided to opt for an extra side of guacamole ($2.20 extra) to compensate my bean-less salad which ended up to be a bad idea. I don't really know what I was expecting since they already skimped out on my Sofritas, but I was honestly pretty mad about the weak scoop of guacamole that I received.\\n\\nThe food itself was not as good as I remembered it to be. Most components were bland from the lettuce, Sofritas, corn, salsa, cheese, and guacamole that I was served. I honestly couldn't taste anything but the mild salsa. My friend was also disappointed with his steak burrito as everything tasted old, chewy, and stale in his opinion. He added that the staff was unwilling to serve more of the favoured toppings despite the skimpy portions. \\n\\nOn another note, some staff members seemed to be uneducated about the basic ingredients served when one of them were about to restock the black beans, or as she worded, \\"whatever it is\\".

I arrived shortly after; the hostess, after seeing me find my fianc√©, wished us both a very happy anniversary and gave us the option of finishing our drinks at the bar or moving to our table.

And on top of the later hours, addictive pies and pastries, other food options, and an adorable space, they ALSO serve cocktails.  Seriously?  I can go there for happy hour, too?  This is insane.

I haven't really found this dish anywhere else in Austin but its humble korean soup dish that is quite soothing to the soul on a cold day.

I made the decision to try Sweet Auburn BBQ a few months ago b/c I was so drawn to the smell of smoking meat at Street Food Thursdays. And maybe psychologically drawn b/c it had the 2nd longest line at the time so I assumed the food must be really good.\\n\\nI got the $8 plate which included a choice of meat, side, and Texas Toast - I decided on the beef brisket (ok) and the jicama & Asian pear slaw (good). Texas Toast was more like Texas bread - thick but not toasted, and plain w/ no garlic butter at all :( I tried my friend's salad w/ BBQ chicken - pretty good but honestly, nothing special. \\n\\nIf you're looking for a more authentic street food experience, I'd recommend checking out the other trucks. But certainly if you love BBQ, go right ahead."},{"name":"The Local Grind","address":"734 SE Powell Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This is a wonderful cart downtown, and the brick & mortar location on Powell was exactly what I was hoping for!  \\nGlad that we can get this at any time now!"},{"name":"HunnyMilk","address":"40 NE 28th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Very creative menu.

Mom had the fish curry and she was pleased as well.\\n\\nBottom line is that it was really good and we'll be returning tomorrow for another meal before I head back home!"},{"name":"Contigo","address":"2027 Anchor Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"What a fantastic restaurant! Such a great atmosphere and the food was amazing. My husband and I have been twice and have tried just about everything on the menu. The El Pepino is so light and refreshing... my new favorite drink. If you like olives, you have to order the olive appetizer. I never knew how fresh olives could taste. Grilled cheese was great just wish it had some jalepeno or fig jam to go with it. Or maybe even carmelized onions. Everything else we tried was delicious. Don't forget to order dessert. You have to try the salted caramel ice cream. Cookies are also great. Great service, fantastic food and perfect atmosphere. This will be added to our list of favorites."},{"name":"Chez Dodo","address":"427 SW Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Food wasn't very flavorful. We ordered the pan fried noodles with chicken curry. Unfortunately there wasn't any hint of anything curry. I had to add salt and chili oil to it at home to make it edible. The samosas were huge but also on the bland side. Would definitely say overrated. The only thing notable was the portion size. But this at doesn't make up for lack of flavor."},{"name":"Petunia's Pies & Pastries","address":"610 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We LOVE Petunia's! With allergies to gluten, dairy and eggs, it can be quite the challenge to find decent baked goods. In comes Petunia's to blow all others out of the water. We have been enjoying Petunia's baked goods for years, and will continue to support their business. The amazing thing about their wares is that they are so decadent, we can't tell they are GF/Vegan! Their cake portions are enormous and definitely sharable. We are quite fond of the buster bars, whoopies, and stuffed cookies. They also have DONUTS on the weekend! The atmosphere is cute, comfortable, and clean. It is casual enough to sit and read or do a crossword, but we also see other patrons having business lunches. They are LGBTQIA friendly and safe."},{"name":"Carol's Place","address":"3421 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Everyone clear the pool, we got a dive here!\\n\\nIf Cheers was a breakfast/lunch spot, I think this would be it. They pretty much treat everyone like a regular and regulars like kings and queens. Customer service is good here, sure they may forget to bring you your chili but they will comp it and offer a sincere apology.\\n\\nIf this place was in a beauty pageant it would not even be considered for honorable mention. It does have a touch of the homey feel but It is pretty rundown.....not in the dirty sense to the point where I would fear for my health eating here though.\\n\\nThe food is good but won't be winning any awards anytime soon. The burger was decent and the meatloaf was just okay."},{"name":"Community Smith","address":"866 W Peachtree St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Came here for brunch. I think you can do valet along with the hotel guests, but this seemed like more of a hassle so I just parked on the street. After seeing a picture of their chicken biscuit I knew that's what I would order, but it was the only thing from the online menu that I didn't see on the menu when we got there. Bummer. I ended up just getting two eggs any style which comes with potatoes, a meat, and toast. This seemed like the most filling choice for $15. A bowl of just grits is one of the main offerings and it'll run you $9... The service was fine and the coffee was good. The eggs have some seasoning in them which I really enjoyed. Everything else was average. They were not crowded at all for an early Saturday afternoon. Overall, nothing really stood out that I would need to come back for."},{"name":"Carmelina's","address":"307 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"This is the best Italian meal I have ever had!   I can't say enough. . We started with the baby eggplant and I would have been happy with just that. .. But then the\\n entrees!   My whole family had pasta dishes.  All were made with homemade pasta.   Our favorite was the crazy Alfredo.   The fusilli pasta with tuna was delicious.  The service was prompt and friendly.   I would recommend this restaurant highly."},{"name":"la Barbecue","address":"2027 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great quality of food but the price is a little bit high.

We sat out side under a nice pop up he has set up in front of the cart with clean tables and chairs set up,while we were waiting we we able to have a nice conversation with a few of Chez Dodo loyals.

LOVE the selection, which is a little different each time you visit. Absolutely worth the trip! And I haven't even made a dent in all the baked goods they have, let alone all the lunch items. Place was packed both times with lots of people sitting in to have coffee, pastries, lunch or all of the above. Great location downtown. \\n\\nFirst time I went there, I had what I think was called a \\"monster\\" cupcake, which had a cookie dough filling and a phenomenal brown sugar frosting, almost tasted caramelized. It was THE BEST cupcake I have ever had. I went back a second time a couple weeks later to get it again but they didn't have them that day. I will keep coming back until I can experience that cupcake again. It made my week and I couldn't stop talking about it. It was so good I ate it all before I could give my husband a bite. Yeah, next time I'll get one for each of us, because I'm not sharing. :-P\\n\\nSecond visit, I selected a thin mint brownie (AMAZING, gooey thin mint icing and soft dark chocolate cakey texture), a PB \\"buster bar\\" and birthday cake cupcake for my husband and I had a cookie sandwich that had the same cookie dough filling as the cupcake. The buster bar was UNREAL, just so gooey and rich. It held up the best out of all of them, likely because of the high quality, amazing peanut butter. The cookie sandwich was TO DIE FOR, it was suggested by one of the ladies behind the counter when I asked about the monster cupcake. My husband liked the birthday cupcake, perfect sweeteness. Just all so delicious and SO fresh! \\n\\nNOTE: It is a vegan place that does a lot of gluten free stuff too, so expect majority, if not all, of the desserts to be a bit crumbly and fall apart when you eat them. This is NORMAL for vegetarian/vegan/gluten free desserts. If you don't like that, go to a normal bakery. Don't rip on the texture/hold up of the baked goods when that's just what comes with the territory."},{"name":"Dolce Italian","address":"3035 Peachtree Rd NE, Ste A201","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"My bf thoroughly enjoys this establishment and I suppose I (secretly) do too.
