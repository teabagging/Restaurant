Probably both. They had some good bottle selections as well, including some 22oz bombers.\\n\\nI tried a couple of mozzarella sticks that my friend ordered and they were very good.

We of course had burgers which were clearly cooked from fresh, not frozen ingredients. The patties were juicy, huge, well seasoned and perfectly grilled. The butter lettuce and the soft bun were a nice addition. Friends ordered the sliders and they were apparently just as good in mini form. The accompaniments included a fresh green salad, lightly dressed, and fries. We also tried the onion rings which were tasty and perfectly cooked.

I need gluten-free options, and, when at home in Seattle, I have a pretty easy time of scoping out a menu for the fare I can eat. Upon looking at Miller's offerings, it became clear that nearly everything contained gluten. \\n\\nI've found there's a service \\"sweet spot.\\" If the server asks me what I want too soon, I feel rushed, if the server doesn't appear for a while after I have made up my mind, I feel a little neglected. Our server was friendly, but after giving us the too-early request, he followed up by not returning to our table in a timely fashion. Not a big deal, but a bit of a bummer when you're really wanting to like a place. I asked him about gluten-free options and was a little disappointed, though not surprised, in what I could order. I wound up getting a burger without the bun and ordered a baked potato.\\n\\nThe food took a while, which wasn't a problem, as we weren't in a rush. When it did arrive, you might imagine my annoyance when I saw a big, bready bun delivered with the burger. Luckily, my gluten sensitivity isn't as bad as what some people experience, so I just discarded the bun. Another person may have had to ask the plate to be taken away and the entree re-ordered and prepared. \\n\\nThe potato was really, really good - hot (but not too hot), cooked thoroughly, with butter & sour cream on the side. The burger was fine. Drinks were fine. Prices were as expected. The five-star baked potato just can't counter the Burger Bun Snafu and the missing Service Sweet Spot."},{"name":"Downtown CREDO","address":"550 E Rollins St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Cool, clean interior, donation based pricing, and great coffee.... \\n\\nWhat more could one want? \\n\\nOur very own, Ms. Andi P, invited Jacksonville and Tampa to Orlando for a co-working day, and this was our little office for the day.

Jalapeno Fries and Black Bean Nachos started out our eating.  Both were simple, but good.  \\n\\nOnto the burger which was $10.  It is a monster of a burger.  Hand formed, NW Beef patty, applewood smoked bacon, melting cheese, butter lettuce, house-brined pickles, vine-ripened tomato and a pile of herb tossed fries (or you can choose a salad or cup of soup).  I asked for it medium rare and this is where they lose a star.  It was not medium rare.  Wasn't quite well done as it was still juicy, but closer to well done than even to medium.  I was disappointed there.  I'm sure they make enough burgers here that they should know what a medium rare looks like at this point.  At least they left the aioli off as I asked for it to not be included.  Might have been an off night for the cook.  I do not fault them that for my first trip here in a long time, but if I go back and order another and it comes out overcooked, I will send it back.  I like some moo out of my meat.\\n\\nI don't think it is the best burger in Portland.  Just my humble opinion.  There is a lot going on with all of the flavors, but a good burger nonetheless.

The food is good but there are days they just miss the mark. The process of getting into the restaurant is very disorganized and they need to re-engineer this entire process. It is so unfortunate to experience Black owned businesses that have a real opportunity that are just not business astute to take their businesses to the next level. I am a national business consultant and the one thing we know after consulting for businesses over thirty years is if you do not treat you customers like Queens and Kings they will eventually find another place to patronize and stop coming to your establishment. I do not care if your fried chicken is made with \\"buttermilk golden flakes\\" they will eventually stop coming. Busy Bee's food is very good but inconsistent. The counter and kitchen staff are very accommodating but your business is always judged by who answers the telephone and the first person they are greeted by. In both of these situations Busy Bee fails miserably. Being unkind, inconsiderate, country snobbish and downright a__holes are not going to promote your business for growth. If a customer is being disrespectful and ignorant then refuse service to them. I also noticed that the management of this place does not respond to negative comments so what does this tell your customer??? YOU DON'T CARE!

That's the problem, INCONSISTENCY. I am willing to put up with the things I don't like if I know I'm going to get that fabulous breakfast, the one I know that The Tin Shed is capable of giving me. But I never know. I might get it or I might get a really mediocre (at best) breakfast. It always seems a gamble to me. In fact, I'm actually amazed the The Tin Shed thrives as it does, considering how inconsistent they are. I guess it's because when they are on, they are really, really on.

After reading all the reviews, I wanted to try this Shanghainese restaurant which is right across Dinesty. I love Dinesty but I've already been there many times, so it's time to try something different. We arrived around 8 pm without any reservations and the waitress asked if we wanted to share a big table with another party, we agreed since it'll cut our wait time considerably. \\n\\nWe ordered the XLB as it would be criminal to omit while eating in a Shanghai restaurant. The quality of the XLB will basically tell you the quality of the restaurant. It was pretty good, lots of juice inside and very flavorful. But, I found the skin to be a little thick especially on the top node. I like the fact they used a very thin radish as a base for the xlb to sit on while steaming. This prevents the xlb from ripping when you pry it off the steaming tray. Awesome idea instead of just using paper. I also noticed they used white vinegar instead of the traditional black variety for dipping the xlb.  There was hardly any shredded ginger in the vinegar which was also a mystery to me. A good combination of vinegar and ginger are essential to bringing out the full flavour of the xlb. Come on guys, you got to put more ginger in the vinegar. Other dishes ordered: fried ribs(bit dried and lack flavour) and beef with vegetables which was very tender. \\n\\nThe highlight of the night was the pan fried Shanghai dumplings. It was just marvellous; golden brown crunchy bottom with a lot of juice inside. When I bit into the dumpling, the juice actually squirted out like water from a hose. I liked the dumpling much more then the XLB. \\n\\nMany reviews had complaints about the service but it's not really different then any other Asian restaurants. They are very busy, so don't be shy about flagging someone down with a little assertiveness. The most important part of a restaurant to me is the quality of the food and the service is just a minor part of the dining experience. I just need them to bring the food quickly to me, ASAP!

However, the children's hot dog was stone cold. So I asked for another one. They took it away and returned a few minutes later with the original one reheated. I said that I assumed they would cook a fresh one to which we were told it was policy to just reheat. Bearing in mind my child had already tried the hotdog it was then placed with other people's meals and reheated. I complained again and asked for a fresh. The manager came out and clearly did not care just stood there with a bad attitude and basically said oh well it is what it is. \\nWe asked for the bill and were charged for 2 hotdogs so had to get them back out again. \\nOver 2 hours for cold food and rude staff and no apology.

I've been telling everyone who asks where to eat that they should NOT GO HERE.  What a waste of money.\\n\\nFirst of all, this was a birthday brunch for a friend on a Sunday morning.  The place was desserted.  There wasn't a single table filled with a body anywhere around us (hello, red flag) and we were seated right next to the hostess podium- crappy seating and frankly, I didn't appreciate that, for the entire horrible experience, we were looking at the screensaver on the hostess computer, which, ironically, bore some slogan about good service.\\n\\nOur party was large- probably about 12 people or so.  There was one waiter who was, quite frankly, completely incompetent.  I arrived a bit late and ordered a drink (sangria).  Half an hour later, the waiter came back and asked what I had ordered.  This really set the tone for the rest of the meal.  I am allergic to a number of things and the waiter did not write down what I was saying.  I had to make sure to check my meal when it eventually did show up.   It was really clear to me that he wasn't listening.  \\n\\nWe waited about an hour and a half for our food. That's right, people.  That's an episode and a half of Top Chef.  At one point, the BIRTHDAY GIRL was up talking to people trying to figure out what the heck was going on, particularly as the restaurant was empty and everyone had simply ordered brunch dishes.  When the food did arrive, not surprisingly (by this point), my dish was missing a key ingredient and one person's meal hadn't come AT ALL.  His meal didn't come until a half hour after everyone else's!  And yes, again, the birthday girl and others spoke to the manager.   As for my own meal, I had to ask the waiter if it contained an ingredient I'm allergic to and he had to GO BACK AND ASK!  As I suspected, he didn't even note this to the kitchen when he put my order in!  When I asked for the key ingredient to be delivered to me (very nicely), the waiter was rather rude, but said he would bring it.  He didn't, of course.  **cue sarcasm** Surprised?  At this point, we just wanted to get out.  \\n\\nThe solution to this horrible experience on the part of the manager was to give us complimentary beignets and fruit with honey.  This is the only reason why I am giving two stars.  They were decent.  That, and the hostess was really lovely and clearly really embarrassed at the service and experience we were so obviously having.  She did apologize (seeing as to how we were literally next to her the entire brunch).\\n\\nSo, the meal was over and we asked for the check.  I think the entire party was just relieved at this point because there was a lot of back and forth with the waiter and the manager.  We just wanted to get the hell out of there.  Two people paid with cards, the rest with cash.  The people who paid with cards gave them to the waiter with a piece of paper on which they had written their name, card type and the amount to be charged.  Idiot proof, right??\\n\\nMy friend went to sign her card and obviously, they had to screw up the very last thing.   Instead of $30, they had charged her $300.  Ain't that a kick in the head?  \\n\\nI paid 30 bucks for a sub-par drink and a salad missing ingredients. The birthday girl spent much of her brunch talking to the manager/waiter about problems.  We ALL felt bad at how crappy an experience she was having.   Do yourself a favor and save yourself from a similar fate.

When the second rack of ribs arrived they were also cold but the French fries were hot. The waitress apologized and sent over the manager who apologized profusely. When the third rack arrived they were finally hot on the edges but only lukewarm in the middle. What bothered me the most was a full rack of baby back ribs in this place is about half the size of every other BBQ restaurant you will go to. Both my parents got a half rack of baby back ribs and they were about the size of a deck of playing cards it was almost funny how small they were. It looks like they cut a full rack into four pieces and then claim its a half a rack. The ribs did taste good but I won't bother going back for the money there are so many other BBQ restaurants that are way better and when you order a rack of of ribs you should not walk away hungry. My wife had a sampler platter with sausage on it that was very good but the brisket was dry and flavorless. When we were leaving the manager apologized again and said they would try to do better. I do hope the place makes it I'm huge fan of BBQ and there is really nothing else in that area however I think they'll be closed in a year if they keep doing what they're doing.

It is located in a small strip mall so the few tables that they have outside on what they call the patio do not seem like a very pleasant place to sit.  The decor inside is trendy but makes for a very crowded dining area which is also very loud.  Our server was very helpful in making a wine selection and choosing an appetizer.  I tried a glass of prosecco ($10) which was very good and the popped corn ($4) which was fun to snack on .  It was seasoned with olive oil and feta cheese but did not have as strong a taste as smell.  Some of the people I was with ordered pizzas and pasta which they seemed to enjoy enough but no one raved about the food.\\n\\nOverall the experience at The Wine Bistro was pleasant enough but the prices seemed a bit high for a casual evening.  The average pour was around $12 and the options were somewhat limited.

The shrimp was tender and perfectly cooked, the risotto was creamy, cheesy and flavorful with asparagus that was just the right level of crisp-tender.

Asked to be seated on the covered porch, which we were.  I wasn't able to hide my disappointment  of the location of our table.  Which was right at the door leading out of the dining room area.  We stopped so short coming out of the door to the table we were running into one another.  The hostess mumbled an apology for table location, but alternatives were not offered.  My husband spent the meal being bumped by the door every time it opened.   The  spacing between the tables was ridiculous.  For the price point, attention to table placement and customer comfort should be a priority.  The menu was fine, but again, at this price point, unimaginative.   Two at our table had Prime Rib, one parmesan crusted chicken and one tomato basil chicken.  The most glaring was lack of seasoning on any of the food.  My steamed vegetables had no seasoning whatsoever, the tomato basil chicken looked sad. The guys said their Prime Rib tasted more like pot roast and the au jus was watered down to point of no flavor.  Our Servers were great!  And we made sure our tip did not reflect our disappointment in the ambience or the food.  When  paying $200 for dinner for 4--no appetizers and only 1 drink apiece, the experience should be satisfying and memorable.  This failed miserably.  The worst part was this was supposed to be a special dinner for a special occasion.  I cannot see any reason to recommend to friends or to go back again.  This is easily the worst experience in a perceived upscale restaurant we have experienced in our 9+ years of dining in Central Ohio.

Every other restaurant on Hawthorne that I had visited in the past is much cleaner so I don't get it with this one.   I used to work in the restaurant industry in high school and the first thing I was taught was to always keep the bathroom's clean because it is indicative of how clean the kitchen is to customers.  The food was just so so. I got a basic breakfast of eggs, bacon, toast, and coffee. I got scrambled eggs and it looked and tasted like those round egg patties you get from McDonald's but all mashed up to be scrambled.  The toast was actually toasted correctly so kudos to them for not screwing that one up.  The coffee tasted old and burnt. \\n\\nMy recommendation is to go to a Denny's or Shari's.

I prefer a bit thinker slice of eggplant with a bit more ricotta but either way it was fine. Then we got the gnocchi. Which was really strange. It was also extremely salty. There was squash, peas and tomato sauce on the gnocchi and it was topped with breadcrumbs and cheese. Weird combination of flavors but they were overpowered by the salt. We also got the Distrutto, which was better. It was like the food was from two different restaurants. The cream sauce here was light enough and the sun-dried tomatoes and kalamata olives complimented each other. I would have liked a bit less salt here as well but it was not nearly as salty as the gnocchi. So all done, we get our check. Its 49 dollars. I have to spend the extra dollar. Fine, add a cannoli.

My aunt is a vegetarian and picked Dillon's because of a particular salad they had up on their menu in front of the restaurant.  When we were seated it was apparently brunch instead of their regular menu and the salad she wanted was not on the menu.  She asked our server if she could order the salad and she told us that they only served what was on the brunch menu until after 3pm.  It was about 2:30pm.  It's a little unbelieveable that an item they have on the menu can't be made 30 mins earlier especially since it was a simple salad.  \\nAs we were finishing our meal a new table of hockey fans sat down at the table next to us and were told by the hostess that the kitchen was closed for the next 30 mins.  I guess this was to switch from the brunch menu to the regular menu.  I've worked in the restaurant business previously for many years and this baffles me.  Why would you have to close the kitchen down to change your menu?  \\nCut to dinner when we decide just to go back and try our luck again at Dillon's.  Bad idea.  We sit outside under the heaters, which were nice.  The weather was awesome for January.  Our server was extremely inattentive, though.

There's a delicious pastry case and a big bookshelf at the back, and even more tables with even more studious workers in the back room. Everyone is very willing to share the large tables, which makes for a friendly communal study vibe, and \\n\\nWHIRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR BANG BANG WHIRRRRRRRRRR BANG \\n\\neverything in the pastry case is well worth a taste.

I've had excellent chai and thick Mexican hot chocolate, but \\n\\nBANG WHIRRRRRRRRR WHIRRRRRRRR BANG \\n\\nmy one complaint - a large enough complaint that it knocked this otherwise lovely study/workspace with additional Bonus Cake and Caffeine down to three stars, is the level of noise from the barista making the drinks. It actually made me jump several times. When you've worked this hard to create a nice studying environment, with the classical music and the big tables and the classy Tiffany-style lamps, why would you not pay a little bit of attention to how jarring it is to have someone periodically banging away at the barista station? \\n\\nBANG \\n\\nI'm not saying I don't understand what the noise is all about. Espresso machines are noisy. I don't expect them to be able to eliminate that noise. But could we somehow mitigate it? I can't think of any other coffeeshop I have ever been in where the noise was SO loud and SO shockingly sudden, and I think it has to do with the design of the bar - there's nothing blocking the sound waves, not a countertop or a barrier of any kind. \\n\\nPlease fix that, Palio. Even a wood box that covers each side of the espresso machine would help. And I want to love you so much.

Despite never staying at the Taj previously, my request for a room overlooking the Boston Public Garden on a high floor (above the tree line and away from the street noise of potentially rowdy revelers) was granted and confirmed at check in.  \\n\\nThe staff was very attentive at check in, at the bar, in the restaurant, and even with room service.  While that is something that was expected at the Ritz Carlton (the former name of the Taj prior to 2007), it is nice to see that the luxury experience was not forgotten, and not diluted.  \\n\\nThe rooms were spacious and clean with all the amenities you should need for business travel or a weekend away (including free wifi).  The bed was comfortable with the high thread count linens providing a soft feel.  The towels were also fresh and fluffy which is a sure sign of a hotel keeping up with the little things that do matter.  My only complaint on the room was the tiny size of the full bathroom which didn't have much counter space for my other half; and the room door which rattled even when the neighbors opened and closed their door.  Heating and air conditioning worked well with in room controls that were easy to regulate from frigid nights to warmer days when the heat from lower floor rise within the building.  \\n\\nThe food was excellent and fitting of a hotel of this caliber.  The tuna tartar was freshly made to order while enjoying a cocktail after check in.  The cafe was also enjoyable with traditional and Indian inspired entrees.  The room service menu is actually larger than the restaurant and includes a children's section as well as breakfast, mid-day/evening, and all day menu sections.  We enjoyed breakfast both days in room with fluffy omelettes, 2 eggs scrambled with requested crispy bacon, fresh juices, tea and coffee, and even fluffy pancakes one morning.  The three cakes absorbed all of the pure maple syrup, and we only with they provided more than the tiny individual sized bottle.  For dinner, the penne with grilled chicken in a tomato basil sauce was very good; note that the sauce was on the sweet side.  The salmon was well proportioned and cooked to order and equally delicious.  The desserts were also very good and filling with portion sizes larger than many other restaurants of this quality.  \\n\\nOverall, we were very impressed with the Taj Boston as it became more than just a place to sleep and shower due to the frigid Boston temperatures which caused many of the outdoor First Night festivities to be cancelled."},{"name":"Patty Chen's Dumpling Room","address":"907 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"I recently returned to the dumpling room.

It had always been a nice atmosphere to dine and drink at with delicious somewhat up-scale food at relatively reasonable prices that were just high enough to keep the riffraff and drunk college kids out while not seeming too snobby. Well, they have totally dumbed down the menu and have gotten rid of all the formal dinner entrees. No more fish dishes, pastas, lamb, steak frites; nothing! Oh, and no more veggie burger. How do you not have a veggie burger?! Now the menu consist of a bunch of lower-priced pub food (I'm sure it's still good though) designed to bring in completely different demographic (college kids and inbound SOX fans). I understand that they are trying to improve business by changing things up and catering  to a broader demographic, but I'm afraid they risk driving away the core patrons that have helped define the atmosphere and ambience of the Tavern.  \\n\\nAs far as the new renovation goes, they just painted everything black and threw a bunch of junk up on the walls, added a row of booths in the dining area that completely close off accessibility and flow in the rear of the dining room, added some chunky fireplace mantel thing behind the bar that doesn't even match, hung up some florescent beer sings in the window and replaced the 1930's sconces on the pendant lamps over the bar with green billiard-esque ones.

After my first visit, it quickly became my regular place for work, friends, and just alone time. The building, food, staff, and environmental accountability contribute to their 5 star status. Rather than spending your time drinking poor quality coffee and eating re-heated food, come down to Bloc 11 and enjoy what is definitely to be an enlightening experience. \\n\\nEnvironment: This Cafe has a \\"hipster\\" steam punk feel, with all the perks of greenery and natural light. Bloc 11 used to be an old Bank, and in restoration has managed to keep some defining features. Firstly, the exposed brick and piping give it a comfortable relaxed feel. They were able to keep and utilize the giant safe doors from the bank, which add a whole other unique element. Large glass windows and hanging plants balance the industrial feel. There is ample seating inside, with many nooks where you can enjoy privacy to drink your coffee and read a good book. There is also seating outside which is absolutely lovely on a warm day. They have great music playing always, and offer multiple events like open mic, and movie nights! They also support some local businesses by selling some coffee related products towards the front of their store.\\n\\nFood: The food and drink here is to die for. There are multiple sandwich, salad, pastry, coffee, and tea options. They have a soup menu that changes everyday, and everything they sell is made fresh right in front of you.(If you get avocado on your salad, you can watch them cut the avocado.) Their coffee is made to perfection, and they provide many flavoring options. The food is made from mainly local and organic ingredients and can be a bit pricey, but you are paying for quality. Their \\"Terrace\\" sandwich is the most delicious sandwich I have ever eaten, and I have literally traveled miles for it.\\n\\nStaff: There is nothing better than being able to come in and order your favorite coffee from someone who is authentic and willing to have a conversation with you. Rather than being forced to wear the same green aprons, the staff at bloc 11 are clearly encouraged to express their individual styles and personalities. It's nice to feel like you know them a little bit, and they're not \\"just\\" those people who make your coffee. The staff have always been nothing but helpful and are willing to serve.\\n\\nEnvironmental Responsibility: One of the more unique things about Bloc 11 is their environmental responsibility. Unlike many other coffee shops, they do not have trash barrels. At first I thought this was strange and I went on to their website for further information. The staff of Bloc 11 sift through everything that is disposed within their cafe and sort out that which can be both recycled and composted. On average they throw 1 bag of garbage out every 2 days. It's nice to see people practice what they preach. Rather than just promoting an idea, they are stepping into action.\\n\\nThanks for reading!"},{"name":"The Ravenous Pig","address":"565 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"We have waited awhile to come visit this place.

In fact, there were a mere handful - some of the pioneers of Portland's food scene:  Higgins, Wildwood, Paley's Place...and Castagna.  In the past five or ten years, Portland has exploded with restaurants with young chefs opening to critical and popular acclaim.  Throughout this growth of things new and hip and trendy, Castagna remains.\\n\\nLocated at the west end of the Hawthorne District, adjacent to the leafy, residential Ladd's Addition neighborhood, Castagna is still fresh and innovative after all of these years...and, I would argue, even better than before.\\n\\nOn Friday evening, after attending a downtown opening, a friend wanted to take me out for a birthday dinner.  We figured that we would eat nearby, but since many of the restaurants did not accept reservations and were packed, we somehow ended up at Castagna.  The restaurant was fairly empty for a Friday (although the adjacent Cafe Castagna was hopping).\\n\\nWe did not realize that the only offerings were a Chef's Tasting Menu for $95.00 and a standard prix-fixe for $55.00.  We considered going elsewhere for some small plates and we spoke to the server about not expecting a prix-fixe menu.  At some restaurants, that would have been the end of that.  The server would have said, \\"Yep, sorry,\\" and we would have gone elsewhere.  Instead, she replied, \\"We're not busy tonight...The chef is willing to put something special together for you, if you don't want to do the prix-fixe.\\"\\n\\nIn the end, we decided to be open and stay.  The atmosphere in the restaurant is so quiet and calming - perfect for actually having a conversation with your dinner companion instead of shouting above the noises of the kitchen and diners' forks and knives scraping against plates.  And, we decided to go with the prix-fixe.  We were not only NOT disappointed, we were blown away by every single course.  From the many \\"snacks\\" that were ceremoniously presented, one after another, to the asparagus with roasted sorrel and tarragon, to the grilled halibut to the frozen hazelnut and chocolate dessert, everything was phenomenal.

Ah, yep we do thats why we made a reservation... By her saying that, she's acknowledging Dillon's was anticipating a busy day, duh... If you're an establishment pretty much in Marathon central, would you not be putting your best foot forward? You should be acting as an ambassador to the city, at least I think so. Judging by the Hostess, Dillon's didn't care much about impressing anyone. She was wearing what can only be described as short pajama shorts, minus the name across her butt and a semi dirty tshirt, yep, that's putting your best foot forward. Then she gave away our table even though she knew we were all present for our reservation.\\n\\nWe eventually get seated in the back bar area, whatever we were still feeling lucky to have a table at this point. The waitress was nice, maybe her name was Alexa? Then we get a piece of paper with the menu, thinking it was the specials menu we ask Alexa who informs us, nope, thats the only menu. Hmmm, it had maybe 6 breakfast items only. Mind you we chose Dillon's because my husband wanted lunch, not breakfast...  There was no mention of a limited breakfast only menu when I made the reservation or when we checked in, not cool at all. We would not have bothered to come here. Oh wait, they're serving lunch starting at 3, yep that makes sense...\\n\\nAt this point we all order . My husband ordered the only sandwich on the menu, maybe a BLT with Avocado---side note: he ended up sick from it.  Two of us ordered the chicken & biscuit sliders, sounds good right? WRONG! They were literally 2 dry biscuits with a one chicken breast split over the two biscuits and they were DRY, pretty much bone dry. Hmmm, where is this gravy that you speak of? We ask Alexa for some gravy as we point to the plates. She comes back with two little bowls of the gravy. Ah ok, if you have the gravy in the back why are you so stingy with it? It was not even good gravy, it was clumpy and gray.\\n\\nLong story short, we get it, its Marathon weekend and the Sox are playing, but you should not compromise all of your business beliefs because you know you're going to get slammed. Quite the contrary, you should put your best foot forward and maybe people would return to your establishment rather than write crappy reviews about you.

One, they put cilantro in with the shrimp, which I'm not use to, and there was lots of it! As for the rice noodles, which is the most important part was not what I expected. They are suppose to be thin, soft, and I guess kind of slippery, but theirs was thick and dry and kind of grainy, a total disappointment. (It kind of made me think of day old rice noodles) The turnip cakes were really mushy too, so I didn't like that either. The bbq pork steam bun was good though.\\n\\nThis place is cute and its a different take on serving dim sum. It makes it easy for non experienced dim sum-ers.

The place was crowded when we arrived around 8:30 pm on a Tuesday night, so the atmosphere was lively and a bit noisy. For a variety of reasons, none of us could drink alcohol that night, which was disappointing, because the wine and cocktail lists were interesting. Tiny sob. The guys were especially ravenous, so we ordered and ordered and ordered: paella, seafood, veggies, meats -- we ordered so much that it's now all a blur. For me, the vegetable paella was the standout. A few dishes were flat-out disliked, mainly because the seasoning seemed off, and almost everything was on the too-salty side. Our waiter, who started out perfectly, seemed to fall apart toward the end, possibly because we kept ordering. I started to worry that his eyes were going to roll up into his head and that he would pass out at the foot of the table. We asked him to wrap up the uneaten food, and he asked us to remind him to bring it to us before we left. We reminded him, but he forgot, anyway. Back to the food, though: the guys were so hungry that we even went for dessert. The male cohort loved theirs -- the housemade chocolate ice cream was the most memorable dish of the evening, and the fruit pastry came in a close second. As usual, there was only one other gluten-free dessert choice for me, a creme brulee type thingie, which was okay, but it would've been nice to have had a wider choice. One gets tired of custard, pudding, and ice cream. A gluten-free pastry or cake wouldn't hurt most restaurants, but nobody seems to want to try. To summarize: food wasn't great, service was spotty.

Now, for the same $4.00+ price, you get only one large mug of tea. This when I went with my boyfriend and we asked for a pot of tea, there were plainly two of us wanting to drink it, and they gave us a single mug of tea. We had to go ask for an explanation, which was lame, by the way; they said people complained of bitterness after steeping the tea too long at their table.

The hush puppies were yummy and the Mac and cheese was tasty, but we were less than satisfied with our main courses.

Somehow I still hadn't ventured out to this restaurant. \\n\\nWitnessing Chef Petrakis add another victory to his sleeve at Battle of the Parks (my write up) put The Pig on my radar. Coupled with running for the best burger in Orlando, it was time to pay this Gastropub a visit. Coincidently, my fellow foodie was craving burgers. Looks like the Food Gods had spoken; Ravenous Pig was the unanimous choice to indulge our gourmand hearts.\\n\\nWe walked into sophisticated yet simple interiors of walls mounted with large bronze mirrors, dim lighting, and my favorite tin ceiling. Hmm! Chic was the verdict.\\n\\nTo appease our hungry souls, we ordered the house made pretzels and biscuits to douse our draught pints. Soft pretzel lightly salted accompanied with whole grain mustard and Taleggio cheese fondue. I personally enjoyed the fondue the best. The Gruyere Biscuit was fresh, buttery, and smoky to taste, satisfying to say the very least. \\n\\nFor our main course we ordered the House made pasta and pub burger. \\n\\nHouse made fresh pasta, lightly dressed with Maine crab, tomatoes and brocolini; fair to say this was one of the better pasta's coming out of Orlando Kitchens. I was duly impressed. \\n\\nThe Pub Burger - thinly cut truffle fries, crispy, and exuding the seductive aroma of truffles. Do I need to eat the burger? My burger was cooked perfectly as I ordered, medium, with pink interiors, nicely done. Caramelized onions topped with melted cheddar, all in all a decent burger. \\n\\nPersonally I have a soft spot for restaurants owned by chefs. Having the courage and conviction to open your personal eatery where one can showcase their passion for food and ambiance deserves much credit. And The Ravenous Pig is a fine example of a successful endeavor for the Petrakis Family. \\n\\nHigh profile restaurants such as The Ravenous Pig carry a certain standard of dining and bring higher expectations to the table. Where The Ravenous Pig delivers in food, it lacks in customer service. I was particularly disappointed with our waiter; he was not only inattentive, but seemed too side tracked to cater to even our simple needs. \\n\\nAfter dining here, I can very much relate to the critics and fellow foodies rave reviews about The Ravenous Pig.

The place has a pretty nice atmosphere, and good sized crowd; in fact, its oddly packed on the weekends with a long wait, at least on Slaughter.  The decor is pretty nice, overall.  The service is average at best... seems like something random always happens; like the waiter will forget to bring my drink order, and when he walks by 10 minutes later, I remind him, with specifics of what I ordered, and when he returns its something completely different. \\n\\nBut all that aside, its the food that matters most.  And it just doesn't have the pzazz or kick that I look for.  It is Tex Mex, and Tex Mex has its own style, but even Chuy's seems to have a more flavorful, balanced Tex Mex (same with Iron Cactus or Z Tejas). I believe Maudi's uses quality ingredients, but they are just using them wrong (at least with the dishes that I've had... Enchiladas for one) making the dishes just a little off target and oddly flavored.    \\n\\nHaving said that, I've heard they have good breakfast burritos; and lets face it, those are pretty hard to mess up; especially because I'm not expecting anything as good as Taco Deli for example (Austin's gold standard of all things Taco).

I wasn't interested in getting the usual fast food so I hopped on trusty Yelp to see what was around. As I searched I came across this place and saw for the most part pretty good reviews. That's not what attracted me to it though. As I approached the restaurant the smell captured me and I knew immediately I had to try it. It was about early lunch so there were a couple people inside and a few sprinkled on the patio area. You walk in and order and pay first. Me and my boyfriend both decided to order the two meats. He picked the ribs and brisket and I ordered the sausage and pulled chicken. We were a little shocked for the price of about 14 dollars that it didn't come with sides. We decided to get 2 sides to split between the two of us and got the collard greens and Mac and cheese. My taste buds wanted the peach cobbler but pregnancy brain is a real thing and I totally forgot about it. Our total with a drink to share came up to be about 35.00 which was kind of steep for lunch. I went to grab our drink and pick a table and then our food was called. It was plenty of food which was great for me and my appetite for two. We immediately dive in and the brisket was to die for. It was so buttery soft and flavorful. I've never had brisket cooked to perfection like that. The pulled chicken was great as well. Seasoned really well and not dry at all. I'm usually not a fan of ribs but the ribs were falling off the bone they were so tender. The selection of bbq sauces was amazing as well. The spicy sauce was my favorite. Just the right amount of kick. The Mac and cheese was the only thing that didn't just wow me but it was still tasty nonetheless. While we were eating a young lady stopped by the table to offer to refill our drink for us. It was a great meal.

I should fess up and admit that I just recently became a fan of sweet potato fries (and I still don't eat sweet potatoes themselves, unless fried), and I generally stick to the thinner ones (i.e. less sweet potato, more fried area).

The charcuterie is not my thing as I found it either too bland (terrine)  or too pungent (salami) for my taste. However, my friends enjoyed it. Dessert was a perfectly tart sweet lemon tart, chocolate mousse cake and a fig tart with an almond paste crust.

We moved on to heartier fare and chose the bravas as well as the macarron. Holy crap! That was amazing, the bravas were crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside and so hot yet so good that you didn't want to wait for them to cool down. The macarron, a Spanish mac and cheese basically, made with penne, sausage and covered in cheese was equally amazing, with the cheese stretching itself to its limits in gooey deliciousness.\\n\\nWe also somehow ended up with a free portion of calamari from our server. I didn't ask questions, I just ate it and it was worth every bite - it didn't have that overcooked dough consistency to it and the whole thing was pretty much one bite of dough and calamari.\\n\\nWell, and the choriburger was heaven on a bun.

We were walking by and the place looked full of people and generally very promising. \\n\\nSo we walked in and the host said to us in a snotty tone, \\"Hi can I get you something?\\" which immediately I thought was an odd way for a host to welcome someone to their restaurant. It seemed like he was implying that we were out of place. \\"Uh, yes. A table for two please.\\" So then the host started checking the reservations and after a couple minutes came out from behind his desk to just sort of stare at the dining room (which really isn't big at all and can be seen almost in its entirety from where we were standing) and finally decided to seat us. So snotty.\\n\\nBut the place is really eclectic and has neat decor and great atmosphere. And the menu looked really promising! Lots of items sounded really great! So I ordered the Chicken Fried Petite something or other that came with poblano mashers and green beans and some kind of salad ($22 maybe?). They don't have what I ordered listed on their online menu or I'd be able to write how they worded it. It sounded great. My bf ordered the mixed grill which came with 2 sugar-cured quails, bbq shortribs, and 2 big pieces of sausage as well as poblano mashers and veggies ($32 we find out later). We also ordered a Brush Fire drink which I can honestly say was GREAT! Really interesting flavor, a little heat, a boldness that I found smooth and addictive! It was great. In fact it was the ONLY good thing that we ordered that night.\\nOur meals came out and let me tell you, boy were we disappointed, First my plate. Where to start? The chicken fried \\"petite\\" something or other was just a bunch of little unseasoned battered deep fried beef CHUNKS. I'm sure they probably came from a petite filet but my impression was that they were the scraps cut off the tenderloin. They took an otherwise good piece of meat and chopped it up and fried the crap out of it. And UNSEASONED to boot! Perhaps it was my mistake. Maybe I just ordered really badly. But still, at $22 I guess I wasn't expecting unseasoned tough chunks of meat.  That must be why they put \\"petite\\" in quotes. Not only that, but the potatoes were not seasoned at all either. In fact, NOTHING ON THE PLATE was seasoned. Oh well, I added some salt and ate the damn things anyway. And to add insult to injury, they screwed up the green beans. Green beans are super easy to cook right, but that was just their problem: THEY WEREN'T EVEN COOKED. Raw unseasoned green beans. What the hell is that? I hate to complain, but that was just crap. So after waiting for ages (I was starting to think the mediocre server we had wasn't going to come back until the end of the meal), I told her about the raw green beans and could I please get some that are cooked. So she brought me a plate of some more which was nice. Unfortunately they were only a little less raw than the last batch (and believe me, I don't like mushy beans. I know what well cooked veggies should taste like! I'm a cook!) and again totally unseasoned. SIGH edit: oh btw the \\"salad\\" was some shredded up iceberg lettuce and a few tasteless chopped up tomatoes thrown on top. Iceberg! \\nMy bf's dish was also pitifully unseasoned and once again, nearly completely RAW veggies. The quail was decent. I don't know what sugar-curing them does to them. They didn't taste sweet or unlike any other quail I've ever had, but perhaps they aren't suppose to. At least they were cooked. The short ribs were tender but needed salt. And the sausage was sausage, you can't really mess that up (although I used to think the same about sauteed veggies). For $32, man what a waste. \\nSo decor and drink aside, I would liken Ranch 616 to an overpriced diner.In fact even the plating was just a big messy pile on our plates like a diner, with a sprig of rosemary protruding out of our potatoes as a nonedible garnish. \\nWith mediocre to not so hot service, we were so baffled by the crappiness of the food that we even told the host on our way out, which I don't think I've ever done in any restaurant I've ever been to. I think we also told him something along the lines of, \\"we were served green beans that came out of the refrigerator.\\" To which he relied (with a smirk on his face the whole time), \\"Oh were they cold?\\" \\"No, the weren't COOKED.\\" \\n\\nMaybe their oysters are great, and the drink was great, but everything else we had was bad. We left feeling like we'd been swindled."},{"name":"Let's Roll Custom Sushi Bar","address":"1184 Denman Street, Suite 104","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"It's hard to stand out in a japanese restaurant market like that of Vancouver.

Also many of the people in the party felt that their drinks were watered down. We mentioned it to our server Michelle but she seemed highly defensive and insisted she saw all the drinks poured herself.

I went with the 10-course tasting menu, which was actually 9 courses, but who's counting?\\n\\nFirst course: cherry smoked steelhead, blood orange, endive, dried chiles.\\nThis one was a great way to start it off, and by far the saltiest of all the courses, though not TOO salty. It consisted of a couple thin strips of steelhead trout, with endive laid out in spears on top. (The presentation of ALL the courses was gorgeous, with interesting plates and such). It was very, very savory, and even with the dried chiles, was not spicy at all. Just delicious.\\n\\nSecond course: Celery root textures, dungeness crab, meyer lemon\\nThis dish was WHITE WHITE WHITE, snowy white with white whiteness. The meyer lemon was completely undetectable, and it was served with a sort of crab foam on top with a frozen crab foam as well. While the celery root was gorgeous and added a ton to the presentation, it wasn't particularly tasty and looked rather disturbingly like bits of a crab shell, so at first I was hesistant to even bite into it. I got over that, though. Not my favorite of the dishes: other than the very interesting foam, it didn't actually taste much like crab. More like the aioli it was served with.\\n\\nThird course: Giant roasted beet, black truffle, cider, chervil, beef tongue\\nThis was disappointing: the beet was actually the most flavorful aspect of this, but unfortunately, I don't like beets too much. I found it tolerable. The beef tongue was served under a half-ravioli shell and it just struck me as rather odd. Weirdly tasteless.\\n\\nAmuse Bouche: Rye roll with house-churned butter and rendered boar fat:This was delicious and very likely horrifyingly awful for me. \\n\\nFourth course: Sole, royale of prawn, geranium and leeks\\nAnother disappointing course: the sole was tasteless, and the rest was good, but nothing special.\\n\\nFifth course: Smoked coppa in garlic and yeast, savoy cabbage and cider\\nThis was fantastic. The \\"coppa\\" is capicola, and quite delicious all by itself, but whatever they cooked the cabbage in it made it amazing. I don't actually like cooked cabbage much, but I changed my mind after this'n.\\n\\nSixth course: Ribeye, elements of beef, turnips and wild onions\\nAnother amazing course. The ribeye was oddly tough for a rare cook (probably about 2 ounces, btw), but the turnips, which I don't generally like, soaked in the flavors of the ribeye and the accompanying wild onions to be delicious. The ribeye itself was supremely flavorful, and the odd chewiness forced me to savor it a bit.\\n\\nSeventh Course: Chamomile custard, petals, pollen and tea sorbet\\nI'm still not sure about any of the ingredients of this, but it was all delicious. Oddly, it didn't taste of chamomile. At all. Just sweet. Also, I think it wasn't tea sorbet -- he mentioned it was an apple sorbet, so they may have changed it around some.\\n\\nEighth course: Variations of grapefruit, rose geranium\\nThis was a \\"grapefruit foam\\" along with a \\"grapefruit custard\\" and some other grapefruit stylings. It was newly added just that night, and I thought it was EXCELLENT. Hope it didn't interact with any of my meds?\\n\\nNinth course: Warm chocolate, pecan dacquoise, citrus\\nThis is the one I took a picture of, and I think they got rid of the pecan dacquoise in favor of satsuma oranges and a mandarin sorbet, instead.

Only 1 bartender was working the bar, but he didn't acknowledge me at all when I sat down; another person told him to give me a menu when she noticed me sitting there staring at  him.  To be fair, he was working the bar and all the tables, so he was slammed with drinks.  However, as a diner, this isn't my problem; they should have had two people behind the bar.  \\n\\nI ordered the top shelf margarita and a bowl of cheese dip.  This top shelf margarita tasted more like a styrofoam cup ice-melted Gatorade.  It's the worst margarita I've had in years.  I drink margaritas all the time; so I know what I'm getting...or not getting in this case.  A guy next to me said he always gets the frozen margaritas and that says a lot when your slushie machine pours a better drink than your bartender.

I disagree with several remarks in recent interviews. I have had most of these dishes and find the complaints inaccurate. The chicken livers are not dry or over cooked, the red sauces are not bland, the side salads have been crisp and fresh. Personally, I avoid alfredo sauce, \\"American\\" or otherwise, because I find it too thick and gooey, a little bland and too fattening. This is at ANY Italian restaurant I have visited. Sorry, Olive Garden sauces are so over cooked they adhere to the plate. Calamari here is not terrific but adequate and as good as I have had in pricier places. The Florentine is certainly not overpriced or expensive. Now if you want to talk about Moretti's, including their new create your own pasta dish location on 5th Avenue... let's talk WAY overpriced. I will NEVER return to it and rarely frequent their Arlington site. I suggest the reviewers who take issue with the neighborhood to stay in suburbs in Arlington, Dublin or wherever and visit places that are pretentious and more concerned with their decor and neighborhood than welcoming long-time diners. (See Moretti's again) I will only agree that the carpeting and rest rooms need help. The restrooms are tiny with no room for expansion or remodeling and the carpet is worn. What do you want from a place over 50 years old? There once was a place called the Jai Lai on Olentangy which you could call \\"dated\\" \\"pass√©\\" and \\"d√©class√©\\" with a tired menu but it was a classic and loved by those who didn't expect a nouveau ritzy joint.

So we ordered and are told we can only use one of the $5 coupons I was given.  Nothing on the menu is $5 or less so told to pay cash or leave.

I ate here about a year ago when my band was on tour, and it was fine.  Not the most amazing breakfast, but good honest food at a reasonable price.  \\nOur most recent trip was a 4 top for breakfast.  There was a good wait (20 minutes) which was fine, as we could socialize and drink coffee (however, it wasn't complimentary, and there were no mugs, and they were out of some of the milks so I had to go to different stations to get everything).  I was really excited by how many people were there, that my breakfast would slay.  Boy would I be disappointed.  After being seated (having already pretty much decided what to have due to the wait) we had to sit for 20 minutes before getting our order in to a disingenuous server.  Since water is self-serve there was no reason for anyone to come check in with us.  As a matter of fact, the mother and baby that got seated next to us 5 minutes after we sat, got their order in before us.  \\nFinally, I ordered the Monte Python (clever Monte Cristo). After waiting 15 minutes, I started to realize that Tin Shed might be self service, or I would walk back there to find a stereo playing a CD called \\"The Sounds of Cooking\\" next to an array of 15 microwaves and a dumpster full of empty cardboard frozen breakfast packages with the contents removed.  \\n25 minutes after ordering our food, our waitress brought our breakfast and asked if there was anything else we needed, to which my friend replied \\"No, we'll be done eating this in about 2 minutes.\\" Probably detecting our indirect disdain with the wait (we were fucking starving) she said \\"Don't rush, take your time.  That's what I tell my husband all the time.\\"   Lame.  A simple \\"I'm sorry you guys had to wait so long, the kitchen is slammed\\" or something would have been some saving grace.  A few minutes later she dropped our check with the standard \\"Thank You : )\\" scrawled on the bottom.  We paid as quickly as possible (no tip, due to no service) and left, hopefully never to return.  The food was \\"meh\\", my bacon side was cold, and the quality poor for the price.  Denny's would have destroyed this place and served us in less than an hour.\\nMy conclusion: The Tin Shed provides crappy service to create a line that projects the illusion of a busy/popular restaurant and that by making customers wait an ungodly amount of time for food, you become blinded by how lackluster it is due to starvation, and think it is good because your breakfast is named after a cartoon character.

The Chicken stock and thinner ramen noodles served during lunch, the gyoza and other items like the soupless ramens.  Over the years, I've seen them expand and introduce new flavours and styles that helped to bring ramen to the forefront of one Japans most popular cuisines.  Better put, It's one of the most popular things that has come from Japan since the introduction of Sushi and the instant ramen.   Today, I have had almost all my ramen dreams come true.  Too bad I no longer live in the neighbourhood, but for years, I've been saying, that we need to have a ramen shop in Steveston.\\n\\nWell my Yelpie friends, it has finally happened.  Gmen opened it doors with a soft opening today July 28th.  Things are still new, but the staff, well, as soon as I walked by, they remembered me.  Masa's Momma.  The food is the same but there's more.  One of my favourite ramen gals has come back to her Gmen roots and I'm happy about that.  She told me that they now have a larger  option of vegetarian or healthier options and since I don't eat ramen as much as I would like, I can now have options.  A ton of them besides just gyoza.  As most of you may already know, I'm not supposed to eat too much carbs, or much of anything these days, but yeah. I'm glad I came and was able to say hi.\\n\\nSo how was the food?  Wouldn't you like to know!!  It's still a soft opening, although the staff are well experienced, the location is new.  So give them some time to work things out.\\nSo to at least get this page started, I'll leave it up to the rest of you Yelpers to write some amazing reviews.  I'm counting on you!\\n\\nFor me, I can't wait to come back and bring the kids and family.  Cause when it comes to Ramen families, Gmen was kinda like my home.  (back in the day, I'd eat at the original location almost 7 days a week, twice a day often.)\\n\\nSo I welcome Gmen to my neighbourhood where Japanese Canadians have settled their roots here for generations.

When I'm feeling sophisticated, or want to nurse my coffee for 3 hours, I go to the Block, and will stay on that kick for awhile.\\n\\nThe women in the shop are really welcoming and a great start to the morning. Also, at 7:45 am, there aren't too many people in there- but they all seem to be completely conscious. More than I can say for myself. \\n\\nI love the layout, the new floors I like (I used to work in a coffee shop and wood floors scratch and don't hold up as well in the long run as the slate they put in), and I LOVE their egg and cheese bagel sandwiches. A bit expensive for egg and cheese on a bagel, but they use organic eggs, a great sharp cheese, and fresh bagels. So yummy I don't mind paying a bit extra as a good breakfast treat to myself. \\n\\n So rock on, Block 11. Rock on. \\n\\n(I think I'm going in now for a coffee!)"},{"name":"Cathay Pacific Restaurant","address":"111 Hancock St","city":"North Quincy","stars":"3","text":"great for a late-night chinese run. good and greasy."},{"name":"El Patron Mexican Restaurant & Cantina","address":"12167 S Apopka Vineland Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This place was next to the hotel we were staying at and after a long day at universal studios wanted something quick to eat.

The host advised that it would be an hour. We left and came back 15 mins later and were informed that our table had been given away. It's not unreasonable, totally understandable as we weren't present when called. When  we were there after now having waited an hour, we were then told that they could only seat 6 people and 2 people at separate tables nowhere near one another and that it was company policy as 7 people was the most they could seat at one table max so our party of 8 was separated to a party of 6 and 2. Not too pleased with having to tell our friends \\"you can't sit with us\\". \\n\\nWe stayed and decided to eat in our separate tables anyhow as we had already waited and our guests from London really wanted dumplings. We ordered 2 XLBs, shrimp and pork shaomai, beef noodle soup with tendon and the smoked duck.  \\n\\n\\nI'm not usually one to complain about food but this may have been the most mediocre tasting dinner I've ever had. When I order something that's called the \\"best Xiao Long Bao\\" I expect it to blow me out of the water. There needs to be a sense of fear that the wrapper might break as I'm lifting it up from the wooden steamer and there needs to be a concern that I may suffer from first degree burns when I put the dumpling in my mouth. This was not the case however as the dumplings were cold and not a single one was dropped or prematurely exploded. Very disappointing for something that's supposed to be the \\"best\\". Shrimp and Pork Shaomai were decent, nothing to write home about. Smoked duck was dry and the best part was the buns. \\n\\n\\nOverall was thoroughly disappointed and if they didn't serve any beer the restaurant would've easily been given a 0/5.

It was for \\"lunch only\\" so we detoured from our errands to check it out. From the outside, it almost looks like it's closed because it's so dark, but when you open the door it looks like a modern lounge more than it does a restaurant - but definitely in a good way. The sushi bar is along the right wall, and the long booth seating is along the left wall. Normally I hate sitting in this type of booth seating because I feel like we are on top of the people next to us. But not here. The tables are spaced out enough that you still feel like you are at your own table. Not sure how it would be if it were crowded though. They also have a couch/table set up in the middle. This gives it the lounge look. Doesn't seem conducive to sitting and having a full meal, but would probably be cool if you had a larger party and were just having drinks and snacking.\\n\\nI read some of the other reviews while waiting on our food, so I was expecting to have \\"okay\\" rolls. We ordered the garlic edamame to start. OMG! Best edamame in town. Then, I ordered the Katana roll and Honeymoon roll, while my hubs ordered the Dynamite Himachi roll and the Arizona roll.\\n\\nWe had all four come out on the same plate and they were gorgeous. honeymoon roll melted in my mouth - which I did not expect. So yummy. The Katana roll was huge. it had so many flavors. The only problem with it was that the pieces were not cut evenly and one of them was a bit too big and had to be deconstructed a tad. But overall, I was impressed.  After comparing our experience to the other reviewers, I got to thinking that the more expensive the roll, the better. The Kitana roll was $13 and probably the best one of the four we ordered (in my opinion).\\n\\nI want to go back and try one of the lunch box specials because for $9 you can get three rolls (I forget which ones) and your choice of soup or salad.

From their diverse cocktail selection to the unique take on sushi rolls they exhibit, we have loved every moment we've spent there so far. \\n\\nTo start, if Taemin is there you MUST ask for him. He's one of the best servers I've encountered in years and having served myself for nearly 10 years, its tough to get that opinion from me. He knows his stuff and always has the best recommendations. We have a blast during our meal when he's with us and I couldn't ask for a better experience because of that. \\n\\nEvery time we go, we get the Bang Bang Shrimp. Its delectable. Light breading, they get the slight tempura-fry right every time, and that sauce is perfect. So many places try to replicate this dish and so far, The One+ has gotten it the most correct. \\n\\nYou have to include some sashimi and/or nigiri in your experience. Their specials are interesting and worth the money for prime, fresh seafood. I love tuna and it always breaks my heart when we come too late and they're out, but why wouldn't they be? Tuna is the best. We had sea squirt once that I was hesitant to try, but after a little prodding from my friends and Taemin, I was glad I caved and gave it a go. Their specials are always on point.\\n\\nWe continue to go back again and again to have their specialty rolls at least once. The Formosa, Sex and the City, and Chanel Replica are among our favorites. I love how adventurous they are with their roll combinations.\\n\\nOverall, their food is complimented well by their drink menu, and whether you're feeling like a good beer, nice glass of wine, or even a variation on a mule, you'll be happy.  They have lots of seasonal cocktails that use fresh fruits and house-made mixers. \\n\\nTo end our meals, the green tea creme brulee is our staple. Whether we're too full to move or not, we always make sure to finish with this delightful dessert. The sticky toffee dessert is awesome as well, however if we're in a position to choose, it'll always be the creme brulee. \\n\\nThanks a million to The One+ for always being epic.

Even worse, they were overpriced at $22/pitcher that poured four glasses.\\n\\nOn the plus side, their guacamole is very good, the chicken chimichangas were decent, made with white meat, and the churros weren't bad.

He told me he didn't know how to run cards and he needed to call his manager, so he grabbed his phone and called her up, only to have her appear from the back. I understand being a new employee in the food service business, I've been there, so I feel like the manager should have been in the front of house to help out a new employee. \\n\\nThe Old School wrap is said to be vegan apple smoked sausage with bbq ranch dressing - I didn't really get any of those flavors.

But maybe I'm just more of an Italian cuisine lover than Spanish.  We had the garlic shrimp and the oxtail, the cheese board and then we both got paella.  I found pretty much everything to be a little too salty.  The garlic shrimp was the best.  We only had wine to drink, so I can't comment on the cocktails.  The prices were high.  The tables were very close together and it is quite loud.  It is much more of a place to go get some tapas and a drink with a friend.  Definitely not date night material.  Another reason I would not recommend it for date night - our waitress barely attended to us at all.  I think she poured our wine for us once, otherwise we had to do it ourselves.  Normally, I would not complain about that, but when I spend $200 on dinner, I expect some better service.  The prices are too high for what you get.  Maybe it's just a sign of how Austin is changing, but spending that amount on dinner and a bottle of wine for 2 people for an okay meal just seems outrageous to me.  There are plenty of other places you could get a good, if not a better meal for much less.  I guess you're paying for the ambience and the fact that it is currently one of the hip places to go.

It was almost inedible, I stopped after 5 bites (and this comes from a person who ALWAYS finishes her meal, even if it's not amazing). We started with the Mixed Ceviche. It was disgusting. Everything on the plate looked like it had been sitting there since the morning, frozen scallops, frozen fish of some sort, frozen shrimp, all shriveled on top of a bed of wilted lettuce, and the nastiest mussel I've ever set my eyes on. We also got the Corn Tamales, which wasn't terrible, but not out of this world either. \\n\\nThen the main courses. I got the special of Mofango, which came with a side of shrimp and peppers and onions. I've never had Mofango before (it's mashed up plantain in a mound shape, fried, with crunches on the top, sounds yummy!!), but it looked like it was going to be good. I tried to take a bite, and I almost couldn't get my fork into it, it was so tough and over fried. Once I finally managed to take a bite, it tasted like nothing. They ruined the plantains. It was so greasy, that a puddle of fat formed around the mound of food. The peppers and onions had about 4 heaping scoops of garlic on them, which normally isn't a big deal to me because I love garlic, but it was the gross canned garlic, and it tasted canned. \\n\\nMy boyfriend had the cuban. Figuring that this is the thing most people order when they come here, I was not impressed. It wasn't disgusting, but it also wasn't very good. Kind of tasteless.

And I just don't find Ramen Tatsuya to be all the hype that it is.\\n\\nAt Kanji ramen, I got the number 1, the Kanji special. The broth is a pork bone based broth, and it was creamy and oh so yummy.  The Chasu was delicious. The noodles weren't over cooked and had the perfect bite. Everything about my bowl was so good. All in all I just wanted more noodles to go with the rest of my broth. In addition, I also had a spoon of my boyfriend's veggie ramen, and that broth was EVEN BETTER than mine.\\n\\nThis place is new, but it's going in the right direction. The walk in and ordering at the counter makes the experience quick, but their quality in service doesn't lack whatsoever. The man who brought our bowls was so friendly, and made small conversation with us. And then the lady who took our order later came to ask how our ramen was. Everyone here was so genuine, I mean how often do you see employees again to check up on you AFTER you've ordered at the front? The wall art when you first walk in gives the restaurant loads of character, and though the place is small, finding a place to sit is no problem, whether it be table or at the counter.\\n\\nIf you want to venture out and broaden your ramen horizon, add Kanji to the list. You won't regret it!"},{"name":"Ranch 616","address":"616 Nueces St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I'll say one thing: the drinks were good.\\n\\nSo was the service.\\n\\nThe food on the other hand, very much not.\\n\\nI had the tenderloin and wifey had the duck.

I have been at UBC since 2013 and don't live on campus, so sometimes I have to bend my dietary rules and eat fast food, and it normally is subway (if not at agora, sprouts etc.). Nearly every time I've gone there I have gotten the regular amount of vegetables and when I request extra,  I get extra without an issue. Only time I had an issue is when they cooked my veggie patty so it was burned on the outside and frozen on the inside (which isn't good, but mistakes happen).\\n\\nI do agree, during peak hours they do rush you and have several sandwiches on the go. They have always ask you which one is yours before wrapping it up and sending you on your way if they aren't certain it's correct. In reality, most people would be complaining if the opposite were true considering the long line - ups.  I think people are perceiving them as \\"rushing\\" us or being rude and inconsiderate, when in rarity I believe they're trying to be efficient and respectful of students tight schedules.\\n\\nThere are two particular women who can come across rude and don't listen well, but they will always fix their wrongs (not their attitude though), not just pass along your sandwich and ignore you as I have read. The rest of them are so nice and actually try to get to know you when it isn't so busy! Those always the rotten apples of the bunch. I've also noticed they just hired a bunch of students who are doing a great job.\\n\\nThat said, management of Pacific Spirit food court needs to monitor their staff better (maybe those 2 rude ladies are the ones causing all of this hatred toward Subway) because there are so many rude staff generally in that food court. Also their hours of operation online  are so incorrect and misleading.\\n\\nSo 3/5 when considering the context/environment, the fact there are GREAT workers, and that you're always bound to have a rude one or two...

The avocado gelato on its own is somewhat tasteless, but put it on the taco and some kind of magical transformation happens.  They also have some appetizers that aren't on the menu, like pretzels and spicy cheese dip, so be sure to ask.  And the beer selection is decent for Disney, and the wine flights are inexpensive.  I'll be sure to go back at night and then walk to the top of the hotel for a view of the Disney fireworks."},{"name":"El Patron Mexican Restaurant & Cantina","address":"12167 S Apopka Vineland Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Enjoy visiting El Patron when in Disney!"},{"name":"Tin Shed Garden Cafe","address":"1438 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"If you're not here right when they open on the weekends, you're guaranteed at least a 20 minute wait. We were lucky that our friend got there before us, around 9:15am on a Saturday, and we waited 20-30 minutes for a table. The wooden border surrounding the planter boxes at least provide some places to sit while you wait, and you can help yourself to a cup of coffee at that point also (but they'll charge you $2.75/cup). We were sat outside in the patio area, which was nice since it was still cool in the morning. We ordered:\\n\\n-Good Dog (Pork Sausage, Jalape√±o, Bell Pepper, Onion & Egg Scramble, w/Cheddar, Salsa Fresca, Chipotle Aioli, Over Potato Cakes, $10.50 + Buttermilk Biscuit $1.50, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=JzUH2-60p6DGfULqNV614A&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yum- this was super flavorful, and a huge portion. I loved the sausage and egg scramble, and the potato cakes were delicious. Definitely make sure you add the biscuit, and spread the marionberry jam from the jar on the table on it. Highly recommended!\\n-Everything Naughty (Potato Cake w/Sour Cream, Green Onion, Scrambled Eggs, Buttermilk Biscuit Covered w/Bacon Gravy, Apple Wood Smoked Bacon, $13.50, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=QrerRvZP_8qhLYvYAtHKKQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): The potato cake was really good, but the gravy was just ok since I like my gravy more creamy. Although I enjoyed this dish, I think I liked the Good Dog more.\\n-a la carte: House Baked Sweet Potato Cinnamon French Toast, Served w/Pure Maple Syrup (One Slice/$3, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=qONrSIy2LInU5WkccLxsBg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Solid, but not amazing. The french toast was very dense- I'm glad we tried this once, but I probably wouldn't order this again. One slice was more than enough.\\n-Coffee ($2.75): Solid coffee, but a bit pricey since you have to basically serve yourself.\\n\\nOur server was good, and attentive but not overbearing. My only complaint about dining at Tin Shed is the long wait for both our table and our food- I think it took around 20 minutes for our food to arrive, which explains why the wait is so long. Overall, I enjoyed my meal here, but  would only come super early to avoid the wait unless I had a lot of extra time to spare.

I got the chicken wrap with a side of sweet potato fries.  The wrap was good, probably the best thing that I have ever had to eat here, and I loved the sweet potato fries. They were delicious!  I've previously ordered the nachos which were underwhelming so I'd say avoid those unless they have changed their recipe. \\n\\nOur server was a little slow and he often forgot things that he was supposed to bring to us.

Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed. \\n\\nFirst off, the space is rather bare.  It's big and bright, but somehow seems unfinished. This was actually off-putting in the dining room.  We chose to grab a high-top in the bar.  Right away we were stumped as to where to put our coats.  It was raining out, and there were no chair backs (just stools) or even hooks under the tables.  That just annoyed me; what was I supposed to do with my wet rain coat?\\n\\nThis next point might have more to do with it being the first week of service.  The service was just plain slow.  The waitress offered menus, and then took more than 5 minutes to bring them.  We waited probably 20 minutes for our appetizer, then another 20 minutes for our meals.  So, we had been there close to an hour before our entrees finally made it to the table.  Maybe they'll get this ironed out with more experience.\\n\\nNow let me review the actual food. We started with a couple of oysters and the thai style chicken on a stick.  My husband really enjoyed his oysters.  The chicken was quite good.  It was seasoned and cooked well, and came with a yummy peanut sauce.  My only complaint was that the stick was completely embedded inside the chicken strip, so I couldn't use it as a handle, nor could I use a fork & knife to get around it. It was just awkward.\\n\\nFor our entree, my husband had the lobster club sandwich, which he enjoyed very much.  He had trouble trying swap out the accompanying fries or coleslaw  for a side salad, but I think that was another detail to be ironed out with experience.  I ordered the grilled salmon which had a few side options.  I chose the mushroom & veggie risotto.  The salmon left much to be desired.  There was absolutely no seasoning; they just slapped a piece of fish on the grill.  They did manage to cook it well; it just needed something more.  I really enjoyed the risotto side; unfortunately I got the impression this was not a regular menu item.  \\n\\nAll in all, I would describe Carroll's as just boring.  It's nice to have a neighborhood bar that I can walk to, and I might find myself there again for a beer and a baseball game; but I doubt I'll head back for the food."},{"name":"Milano Pizza & Pasta","address":"60 Washington St","city":"Brighton","stars":"3","text":"Very tasty.

As stressful as planning one of those is, I have to say that Bridgid and Rodney made it a wonderful and easy experience. Since the bride is a lasagna lover to say the least, the shower had to be at an Italian restaurant and I wanted it to be outside. After looking at every Italian place in the area and having them not be flexible to my needs (some restaurants dont do buffets?? $4,000 to use a patio? ?are you kidding?) -- I was running past Porcinis (Never eaten there before) and decided to go in and check out the patio. I was greeted by Bridgid who promptly showed me the GORGEOUS patio that gave me goosebumps and reminded me of my al fresco dining when in Italy two years ago. She and Rodney sat with me that following Friday night and we put together a menu together that was what I wanted and pretty damn close to my budget ---impossible to do anywhere else. Rodney even made a special lasagna for my friend that is not on the menu--- it was absolutely outstanding. They opened the restaurant for us on a Saturday afternoon (they usually open at 5PM) . Although we ended up moving the party inside due to the heat, it was still amazing. We had the whole place to ourselves, set up how we wanted. The Shrimp Cocktail was so good, and everyone was saying how huge and delicious it was, the bruchetta was gone in a second. The Caesar Salad was a big hit as well.  The main dishes of lasagna, gnocchi, and the special pasta/vegetable dish got so many raves. The champagne drinks that were purchased had a huge strawberry with them.  She was so nice, so accomodating, and put up with all of my phone calls to her about every little detail. Not ONCE did we feel rushed out of there at all that afternoon, nor was I rushed to pay . Without me asking, they packed up the leftovers for us to take home. They had the place cleaned up in a flash (feather boa feathers and all).

Instead of being gooey, the cheese had an unappealing, curd-like texture, which you can kind of see in others' photos.  \\n\\nSimilarly, the tomato sauce and crust didn't add anything.  Eating this pizza was a bizarre sensory experience, because although my eyes and nose were telling me \\"Pizza, yum!\\", my mouth was just... static. Maybe toppings usually mask the disappointing texture and flavor?\\n\\nI still give Mama Gina's 2 stars because it's relatively cheap (at around $11 for a large cheese pizza) and not outright offensive.  I'll have to try Beacon Street Pizza (formerly Dial-a-Pizza)'s equally priced product for a decisive verdict on cheap, bad Somerville pizza."},{"name":"Mama Gina's Pizzeria","address":"19 Union Sq","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"I placed online order with them twice.\\n\\n- It was late 30 and 45 minutes, I guess that's the thing with this restaurant, they are always late.\\n\\n- The pizza ingredients are good and tastes ok.

Yes, this place is kind of dodgy looking from the outside and the food quality may be a bit questionable considering the quantity they're bringing out, but I've never had any problems after eating here so I guess unless you're a huge germaphobe or really picky with your ingredients this place isn't an issue. Actually, if I had to rate the interior, I would actually say that it is quite clean. \\n\\nThe place is two stories with plenty of seating, but if you want to come on a Friday or Saturday, there can be a considerable wait (20ish minutes) if you come during a peak time. \\n\\nBasically what happens when you come in is the waitress seats you, asks you what kind of broth you want, and hands you a sheet with a little pencil so you can tick off what you want. Note, they take the paper away, but you can always ask for another menu (we do this every time and we've never had any bad attitude from any of the staff). It is important to note that while the spicy broth is pretty spicy, it's not going to compare to the stuff you get in China. \\n\\nAll in all it's a great experience, especially if you have a big group that wants to sit, chat, and eat for a two hour period of time."},{"name":"The Busy Bee Cafe","address":"810 Martin Luther King Jr Dr SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Busy bees is a good soul food spot, comparable to Mary macs but Mary macs i would give 5 stars because they have good food with good service.

If there is any reason at all to venture to the suburbs, this is it. Arepazo is the sister to the popular downtown destination, El Arepazo. The menu is essentially the same, but this place is open for dinner and sells spirits and wine (unlike El Arepazo downtown).\\n\\nMy biggest complaint with Mexican or Latin American food here in the US of A is that everything is drowned in cheese. Now, I am a huge fan of my dairy friends. But when your burrito is drowning in it, you miss out on all the other flavors going on. Or maybe drowning something in cheese is a way to disguise the lack of flavor in a dish? Either way, it bothers me. Arepazo doesn't do that. You still get some dairy love, but not too much. Each flavor on the dish sings a harmonious tune. The ingredients are high quality and fresh and the food is impeccably prepared. You must try the cilantro sauce. It's a big hit and one of the reasons why I know God loves us. Their food is made of dreams and unicorns. \\n\\nThe only reason I am giving this place 4 stars is because my waiter had clearly not tried the food. I asked her about two dishes on the menu and she admitted that she had not tried them. What? Blasphemy! The only dish she could recommend was the empanadas - and that was because it was the only dish she had eaten at the restaurant.

I was really excited to try it.\\n\\nSadly, my experience was not good.\\n\\nThe server was nice, but very inattentive. I think they were a bit busier than they had anticipated, but it didn't seem like it was enough customers to warrant the lack of service. But surprisingly, this isn't why I gave it two stars. (I would only do a low star count for service if I had more than one experience or if it was truly horrible because everyone's allowed a bad day in my book).\\n\\nThe lack of stars is for the film and chunks of particles in the dirty cups of water (which they did replace), and for the luke-warm and burned Orange Cappuccino. It was also mostly milk, burned milk, with less coffee than I would expect in a cappuccino. The minimal amount of orange rind was overpowered by a random sprinkling of what I think was a chunky rock-style sugar; something I could have made at home, and I'm not a barista. It was definitely less than stellar.\\n\\nI've heard wonderful things about the desserts they offer but it wasn't the right time to try one. I even received a great review about a raspberry dessert from a party that was waiting for the place to open. Which reminds me, they open at 7pm but the door was locked until well after 7, which I'm sure was an accident as the open sign was on.\\n\\nI wouldn't say I hate this place, but even if the service had been great, and the cappuccino was delicious, the vibe didn't grab me as anything amazing or special like other people had described (especially for Portland). Old house in Portland turned into a cafe? Dime a dozen. But, I still haven't tried the desserts, and they could be heavenly for all I know.

We were disappointed as the guest count grew and we realized everyone would not fit into the restaurant, and then magically they opened a private room next door.  It was a sign! We immediately began to inquire about the private room for our June 2013 wedding date.\\n         This is where our excitement ended.  We were treated very rudely by the staff during our first conversation about the room, as if they didn't take us seriously about wanting it - to the point that they would not offer a contract or write us down on the calender.  They told us to come back closer to the date.  Months passed and save the dates were sent out, so I decided to inquire again about the private space.  Emails, phone calls, visits, and to no avail.  One time I even called and heard the manager (Deb) in the background say she \\"was in a meeting, couldn't talk\\".  I told the host the reason for my calls, my phone number, and to please have her return my call the next day.  She assured me that she would, and I have still yet to hear back.  \\n         It's absolutely appalling to me that a restaurant owner would not want to speak with someone interested in spending $1,000's of dollars in one evening.  We were also interested in ordering cases of wine for the wedding and as take home gifts for our guests.  Their loss.\\n        After looking at several other private rooms in the area (Hyde Park, Columbus Fish Market & J. Liu) we've settled on The Worthington Inn for our guests - and I would suggest you do the same if you're looking for a welcoming rehearsal/wedding dinner."},{"name":"Papa Murphy's","address":"2200 Winter Springs Boulevard, Suite 111","city":"Oviedo","stars":"4.5","text":"Very friendly staff and very clean environment.

Every pasta dish is finely crafted (with lots of TLC), flavourful and tasty, and incredibly delicious. \\n\\nConcept. Owner/Cook Mike Jeffs has created a brilliant concept, tying both Nook and Tavola together. Both offer small menus with the typical Italian comforts (crostinis, antipasto, burrata, pizza and pasta), but you can expect everything to be simply delicious, and the pastas - amazing. There is a daily special feature menu scratched up on the chalkboard, which is what I usually end up ordering from. I had the best duck confit pasta (actually, the best pasta I've ever had). It was melt in your mouth amazing with such strong, yet simple flavours and I just couldn't get enough. Mark H. and I had nothing but great stuff to say about this place after our first experience. \\n\\nService. The service is fantastic, and the staff knows whats going on: kitchen crew crafts the dishes to perfection, every time; bartenders know their wines incredibly well; and servers understand the concept inside/out and are highly attentive. And from my experience, they're all fun and friendly. \\n\\nWho should go? \\nIf you're in the mood for pasta and willing to trek it downtown, go. It's ideal for small groups of 2-4 who are willing to wait for 20-30 mins during prime time. And if you're not, hit up Tavola just around the corner - same food/same concept, but not nearly as busy. The crowd is often a gregarious bunch of thirty and forty somethings and West Enders.\\n\\nFor me personally, pasta/pizza is never a first choice for dinner. I like izakayas, west coast menus and the late-night drinks scene better, but Nook is a definite \\"yes\\" for me every time. \\n\\nWhat's more:\\n- Burratta - highly recommend\\n- Party of 2 is ideal, 4 can be done\\n- Expect a lineup every Wed-Sat, 7pm+\\n- Looks are highly deceiving from the outside ... it's much better than it appears\\n- Similar to: Tavola (same chef/food, but Tavola is more group/family-oriented), La Quercia (small/delicious food, but La Quercia has a moderately higher price point)"},{"name":"Alamo Roast Beef & Seafood","address":"21 Salem St","city":"Medford","stars":"4","text":"The Alamo is a solid local sub shop, with cheap prices, quick service, and a varied menu.

I know how hard it is when it's busy. Came here about a month ago with 3 other friends after the movies. We all just wanted a couple cocktails and some lemonyaki wings. We sat on the Patio. Server comes by after about 10 minutes. I'm cool with that because I knew they were busy. I could tell the server was new because he was very shy and timid and I could hardly here him while he was talking. To make a long story short we ordered drinks and he forgot to put in 2 of our drinks. The first round took about 20 minutes and then another 25 minutes for the drinks he FORGOT to put in. So we ordered 2 drinks each next go round because we figured that would just cut down on time. Those drinks NEVER came out. We all ordered wings. My 2 friends ordered 2 Caesar salads to come out first. So we sitting around talking and realized it's been like 45 minutes and NO SALADS!! NO DRINKS!! Finally we track our server down and ask about our food. Asking about the salads at least. They come out 5 minutes later. Lukewarm Salads. Croutons soggy as fuck. So the salads were sitting in the window all this time old as hell. We sent them back. Asked about wings and he said the kitchen burned the wings and had to remake ALL OF THEM only after we asked about them. 20 more minutes go by no food. So this is an hour and a half for NO WINGS!!!!! So we told the server to forget it and give us our check for the ONE round of drinks we got sitting there for 2 hours. We asked for a manager. We waved her down and she would NOT STOP at our table. I was in SHOCK. I never had service this awful. The server brings our checks with ATTITUDE and slams them on the table. I literally thought I was being PUNKED!!! He's lucky I'm in the industry because I still left him 15%. My friends wanted to leave him 0 but I talked them into leaving him something. I know how it is to be busy. If he would've been honest and communicated with us about what was going on we would have understood but we got attitude and a HORRIBLE MANAGER who truly didn't give a DAMN.

Despite the more-than-common foodie snobbery found in Portland, I do not carry the same disdain for this Tequila-bar-cum-Restaurant as a lot of my fellow citizens of Portland.  \\n\\nI have been here twice.  Once for lunch, and once for happy hour.  \\n\\nLunch: Despite being busy at lunchtime, service was fantastic, which is a surprise in Portland.  Coming from CA, I am not overly hopeful for Mexican food in OR as I've had more than few bad experiences.  Tex-mex is not my favorite, but tends to be better here than straight Mexican food.  Under the suggestion by our server, both my coworker and I ordered steak; mine in enchiladas, his in the nachos.  Their steak is FANTASTIC.  The cut is fatty enough to be juicy w/o so much as to taste cheap.  It's seasoned just right.  The enchiladas were passable - not my favorite.  The food was definitely Tex-Mex - but its as-advertised, so I can't complain. My coworker swears by the nachos, and he's the biggest foodie I know. \\n\\nHappy Hour: Bravo!  The happy hour, like many of Portland's more \\"upscale\\" venues, applies to food only - but what food it is.  Steak tacos are $5, and the steak was just as good as my first visit. Nachos were excellent at $4.  All six of us raved about the food.  The service was just as good as it was the first time - very attentive w/o being pushy or in the way.  The drinks can run expensive, but what do you expect when they have a tequila selection equal to most scotch or whiskey bars.  Their three page menu includes $500 bottles of the world's best tequila.  I had a Corzo Reposado on the rocks which was excellent with a small squeeze of lime.  My Dos Equis were large and on-draft, and my top shelf margarita was as-expected.  \\n\\nLet's be honest - this is a tequila-bar with other stuff (much like saki bars that serve food too), so don't come here expecting anything other than what they advertise themselves as.  The food is Tex-mex pub food, and like all pub food can be hit or miss. If you eat red meat, try the steak.  Don't come here looking for a quirky hipster bar or a niche foodie hideout - there's a reason this place isn't on the east side.

The grand finale of sorts being the Tsar Bomba. ( -)  is the nickname for the AN602 hydrogen bomb -- the largest, most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated, and currently the most powerful explosive device ever created by humanity.\\nDeveloped by the Soviet Union and dubbed \\"The City-Killer\\"[citation needed], the bomb was originally designed to have a yield of about 100 megatons of TNT (420 PJ); however, the bomb yield was reduced by half in order to limit the amount of nuclear fallout that would result. Only one bomb of this type was built and tested on October 30, 1961, in the Novaya Zemlya archipelago.[1]\\n\\nOuch!\\n\\nThe Tsar Bomba is the single most physically powerful device ever utilized by man. Its size and weight excluded a successful delivery in case of a real war.[9] By contrast, the largest weapon ever produced by the United States, the now-decommissioned B41, had a predicted maximum yield of 25 Mt, and the largest nuclear device ever tested by the US (Castle Bravo) yielded 15 Mt (this was due to a runaway reaction; the design yield was approximately 5 Mt).\\n\\nThus certain bombs were designed to destroy an entire large city even if dropped five to ten kilometres from its centre. This objective meant that yield and effectiveness were positively correlated, at least up to a point. However, the advent of ICBMs accurate to 500 metres or better made such a design philosophy obsolete. Subsequent nuclear weapon design in the 1960s and 1970s focused primarily on increased accuracy, miniaturization, and safety. The standard practice for many years has been to employ multiple smaller warheads (MIRVs) to \\"carpet\\" an area. This is believed to result in greater ground damage.\\n\\nI feel much the same way about Casa Garcia's, unless you get drinks. As for GE, she is halfway to Seattle by now.

Their frozen house margaritas definitely have a kick to them - it is hard to find a strong house marg in these parts. I have become a big fan of their Skinny Margarita - it is refreshingly light and packs a punch. Salsa is fresh, and I usually eat an entire bowl on my own. My recommendation for food would be the chicken fajitas - they are fresh and come with all the good stuff. The portions are huge - Mom and I usually split fajitas for one and can't finish it all.

I picked Sage in Buckhead because I've been wanting to try it out and this is the newest location. Also, he was paying, so why not try on someone else's dime, right? LOL!\\n\\nImmediately, it looks to have valet only options for parking, but I'd rather someone else find me a park any day, especially in Atlanta. From my understanding it was complimentary, but accepts tips. The valet  guys were really friendly. I did not ask if there was a self-park option.\\n\\nOf note, I made a reservation thru Open Table for 7:15, so that is an option. We walked in and the ambiance is just amazing. It can definitely be a great date night spot, or a chill start to a girls night out. It's dark, but has enough lighting that you won't need to break out your iPhone flashlight. I walked up to the hostess stand, and for some reason the young lady seemed a distracted. My friend noted that someone famous was leaving out as we were walking in, so maybe that's what it was. She sat us at our booth and let us know that the server would be right with us.\\n\\nAnd, boy was she. I mean there was no lag time. She took our drink orders and gave us time to review the menu. Both me and my friend were torn between two-different dishes. When she came back with our drinks she offered suggestions. I went with the Sage Seafood Broil (Charbroiled Filet of Flounder, Jumbo Shrimp, Diver Scallop, Mascarpone Risotto, Seasonal Veggies and Chardonnay Caper Beurre Blanc). My friend ordered the Swordfish and Crab Cake, which also came with risotto and broccolini. \\n\\nAs we waited for our dishes, bread and oil was brought to the table. My friend made the statement, \\"I thought that was a track playing, I didn't realize the music was live.\\" And sure enough, it was--there was a guy there playing guitar and singing, but the volume was perfect. Don't you hate going to restaurant with a live band and you can't even talk to your company because it's so loud. I was really impressed that the mgmt. staff were cognizant of that. My friend said the bread and oil was ok; I tried the bread, but I'm not a fan of oil like that, so I passed.\\n\\nOur food arrives. My meal looked decent enough, but didn't really have a substantial \\"char\\" to it as the title suggested. Matter of fact, it barely looked pan-seared. I tried the flounder first, and it was a tad too salty (no char), then I tried a shrimp (no char), and it had no flavor at all. The beurre was there, but didn't add any additional flavor or wow factor. I tried the risotto, and let me tell you, it was bomb.com. I LOVED it. I could've just had risotto and brocollini and be satisfied. Haha! I then tasted the scallop (no char), and it was a bit soft. I like my scallops seared just a little bit longer. My friend seemed to enjoy his meal--he ate all of it. LOL. I tasted his crab cake and it was decent. He did make that comment that he would have been fine with just crab cake and the risotto (it's that good), but overall he enjoyed his full meal. He also ordered the French Sweet Tea. He didn't like it, but he also doesn't like Hennessy or Grand Marnier, which are the 1st two ingredients. Hey, don't ask me about that logic, I'm just as confused as you. :-) I was happy to see Sweet Riesling on the menu and ordered a glass.\\n\\nOverall, I will return to try some other dishes because I absolutely loved the ambience and I want to love the food as well. The service was great--our server was very attentive. Actually, all of the staff were. My friend asked where the restrooms were from a server that was just walking by, and instead of giving him directions she said, \\"I'll show you,\\" and escorted him. Several stopped by to take empty plates. It was a good experience.

We'd set our group to meet up around 715, and three of the five of us were early.  After I arrived (approximately 7pm) the hostess came over and asked if we'd like anything to drink, we asked for water and said there'd be a couple more joining us shortly.  ten minutes later we were told they were going to have to move us because they just got a call about a party of 18 coming for dinner.  We were surprised they would accommodate such a big last minute request but as we'd not ordered anything yet we had no problem agreeing to move tables.  45 minutes later (so by this time it was now almost 8pm) we're finally displaced after one of our two missing companions arrived to another part of the restaurant.  Ten minutes later we finally get to order drinks and appetizers, our last guest arrived, and we ordered our food.\\n\\nThe saganaki - and I LOVE saganaki - was too-large a portion so the outside was overcooked, and they no longer set it ablaze as they supposedly used to which does actually affect the flavour.  Shortly after, we received a greek salad with a very oily flavourless dressing and very little cheese, and then our main courses arrived.  I had the lamb shoulder because I also love the way greeks do lamb.  Now I do not know who works in the kitchen but they did not trim the meat.  At all.  Zero trimming done!  I have never had meat that was a 1:1 ratio meat to fat before.  It was bordering on disgusting despite how perfectly the meat itself was cooked.   you couldn't taste any seasoning for all the fat.  The potatoes were good, the carrots were overcooked, and I could not even eat the rice - in my first bite I had what looked like a roasted clove of garlic (which would have been delightful) and ended up instead with a mouthful of mushroom which I cannot eat.  I felt sick the entire meal.\\n\\nThe martini i had was delicious, and inspired me to pick up some pineapple juice on the way home so as to replicate it (as I already have blue curacao and melon liqueur), but the bougatsa I had for dessert tasted of nothing but cinnamon, icing sugar and pastry.  The custard which supposedly was infused with orange flavour was more just texture and temperatures but no taste.  All in all - I think the only place I've been to that was worse was Stephano's on Davie street.  Every other greek restaurant I've been to was better than that!

Compared to a bunch of crazy ass yanqis, I was Wikipedia. In other words, I was the dreaded (sigh) \\"foodie douchebag.\\"\\n \\nSome context first. The previous week I'd eaten at Casa Vieja. I'd borught my own pocket Colombian, Vanessa T. and we'd made quick work of a couple plates of bandeja. Throughout the meal, V and I talked about Colombian food, current events, and, yes, you other Yelpers. Deal with it. Still, the meal was a good primer on Colombian food from \\"She Who Knows.\\"\\n \\nSo it was that 20 aged hipsters descended on La Casona, hipsters who are trying to spend more time in actual restaurants and less time in bars, as if we're trying to reboot our livers with hearty ethnic food. The wife and I were the first to arrive (at 5:30pm). Dinner was at 6. A smattering of Colombians were scattered through the room. I'm pretty sure I was told, \\"Pick any seat,\\" but my Klingon is actually better than my espanol. It wasn't until my wife stepped up with her Southern drawl and informed the host that, \\"We'll need seats for at 14 people at 6 o'clock\\" that a look I can only describe as confusion mixed with fear spread on the man's formerly smiling face. And thus a short conversation followed:\\n\\n\\"¬øCu√°ntos?\\"\\n\\n\\"Huh?\\"\\n\\n\\"¬øqu√©?\\"\\n\\n\\"Huh?\\"\\n\\n¬øqu√©?\\"\\n\\n\\"Um, could you....repeat?\\"\\n\\n\\"Uh...uh....how......meeny?\\"\\n\\nWe answered with a flash of 10 fingers followed by four more. The man huddled briefly with another behind the counter.\\n\\n\\"¬øA que hora?\\"\\n\\n\\"Honey, I think he asked when.\\" Another flash of six fingers. The look of fear diminished, replaced by a raised eyebrow. He waved us over to a group of tables that were hastily arranged to accommodate the group.\\n\\nThe wife and I were seated and waited for a bit. Having eaten at untold ethnic mom and pop's restaurants, I knew what was happening; they were marshalling forces, finding the ones who can communicate with these schmucks they just seated in the corner.  An adorable server with a fairly good grasp of English appeared. She took our drink orders (no Colombian beer that day, only...Corona, Heinekien and Bud Light?). Others in our group showed. Our adorable server was then supplemented with another one who had flawless English. By 6pm, a total of 20 of us gathered. The staff added another table without missing a beat.\\n\\nWhat occurred afterwards was an act of gluttony that will be referred to in the future only in myth and song. Holy Sweet Flying Spaghetti Monster, I, just myself, ordered a carne (a beef BBQ) arepa and an arepa paisa (topped with chorizo, beans, avocado, and chicharron.) Spanish-to-Southern translation was asked and provided:\\n\\n\\"What's that?\\"\\n\\n\\"An arepa. It's basically a cornmeal pancake. Think of a johnny cake.\\"\\n\\n\\"What's that?\\"\\n\\n\\"Chicharron. Rednecks might refer to it as 'pork cracklin's.\\" (The rednecks amongst us cheered.)\\n\\n\\"Mondongo?\\"\\n\\n\\"Chitlin soup.\\"\\n\\n\\"What's a bandeja?\\"\\n\\n\\"Basically everything. On one plate. Um, I'm ordering the mini.\\"\\n\\nFood was delivered promptly and inhaled. My tablemates ordered a steak that was as big as one's head. Seriously. No, it wasn't a dry-aged filet, but my friends enjoyed their steak and had enough to take home later. My mini-bandeja (\\"mini\\" in name only) was definitely tastier than Casa Vieja's; the chicharron not nearly as chewy and the meat tasted more of beef than, say, hot dog. I heard raves of the different types of soups at the far end of our group, but wasn't able to try any. Finally, additional credit to the server for informing my wife that the plantains weren't as ripe as they should be, so steer away from them that day.\\n\\nIn all, they handled the 20 of us easily.

The food we chose to get was an app, crab cake, and for entrees lobster mac and cheese and the salmon risotto(corn and leeks). The crab cake, for $17...was pricey but it was delicious. The lobster mac and cheese was VERY good. Flavor packed just enough cheesiness and creaminess. It wasn't too overbearing. The risotto was also amazing. It was gluten free and just very flavorful.

I'm not a red borscht expert by any means, yet I felt that Lacomka's red borscht was delicious especially for an establishment that is a large restaurant- who would've thought they could make such big quantities while still keeping quality and price great. Now I've had red borscht from a different region in Russia and I must say I do like the borscht; for my own taste- with bigger pieces of meat and more flavorful. Next time I go, I'll probably taste around the menu as this establishment is highly popular so it's only a matter of time before I find an absolute favorite.\\n\\nBry's mother had the beef blinchiki which she always picks up from here as snacks for visitors into her home. The beef blinchikis are great and absolutely delicious!

I think, as much as what I just typed is true, it's also just as true that I hate driving and 88 Tofu's location near the Perimeter makes it almost as convenient to me as if I were actually to drive to Korea itself.  Lame, I know, but it now practically takes an act of God to move me out of my personal perimeter, a boundary that hardly extends north of Ponce.  I tend to never venture Outside the Personal Perimeter. I ain't down with OPP; yeah, you know me.\\n\\nBut I happen to find myself in just that situation later Friday night.  And,  yes, it happened to be late (11pm) but not so late that the bars will have belched out their drunken masses.  So I took the opportunity to go to 88 Tofu House with my friend.\\n\\nFor the record, I've heard this place is a zoo after hours. I, being the reformed drunkard that I am, realizes that \\"after hours\\" means \\"after 3am,\\", so at 11, 88 Tofu was a tomb.  It was me, my friend, a couple in the corner and the TV showing Korean soap operas.  I didn't mind the quiet, since that was the mood I was in.  I ordered the Combination seafood/beef Tofu Bowl #1.  Yes, I went surf and turf.  My friend ordered some Korean beef plate.  The food appeared lightning quick, my bowl filled with molten lava.  I quickly broke my egg into it, but it poached so quickly, I wasn't able to incorporate the yolk too much into the soup.  I ladled the soup (complete with tofu, scallops, shrimp, mussels, clam and beef) onto my rice and munched away.\\n\\nIt was okay.  I think had it actually been cold rather than Atlanta in June, it would've been perfect.  Instead it was just okay.  But no real complaints though.  My friend's beef plate?  I've had better to be honest.   He found the pickled bock choy side to be the most appetizing part of the meal (which our server noticed and continued to supply more of.)  However, my friend did finish his whole meal even after he said he wasn't that hungry.  So maybe it wasn't SO bad.\\n\\nI dunno.  Maybe we went there in the wrong frame of mind, kind of like reviewing The Waffle House sober and before the bar crowd hits.

I am lucky to be able to travel to China on a yearly basis and one of the foods I love are soup dumplings.  As I was doing research on Vancouver I was thrilled to see that there were several places that served them.  Thanks to some helpful Yelpers (and the fact it was around the corner from our hotel - not going to lie) we decided on Dinesty.\\n\\nWe had spent the earlier party of the day in Stanley Park and we knew we wanted to go out to dinner, so we stopped just for the soup dumplings and not for an entire meal.  At around 3pm it was full, but not pack so we had no wait for a table.\\n\\nThe menu is MUCH better than it looked on line.  Online it just looked like there were pork dumplings - but we were super pumped (or at least I was!) to find that they had others available.  We chowed down on the pork, crab, and shrimp with scallop.  While they were not as good as Din Tai Fung I was NOT disappointed in Dinesty's versions.  The crab was by far our favorites and next time I will probabl;y double down on those and not bother with the shrimp and scallop.  And it's not like the shrimp and scallop were bad, it's just that the crab was that much better.\\n\\nService is very efficient.  Food comes out as it's ready and it marked off the ticket that is left on your table.  Once everything is marked off, you're done.

I knew it was the hospital, but that can mean many things. The McRae Ave Parking Garage is your friend here, and they validate parking! All the love and respect for that. Find your way out heading toward the train tracks, then cross the tracks near the construction at Rollins St. You've found your new home.\\n\\nLike other reviewers have said, the location has a city feel, much more industrial. I don't know if I have a preference for location since the College Park is so cozy, but I love the sleek design and 2 story windows. Growing up in the DC area, trains were always around, so having the tracks nearby is something I like. (Hi, Sunrail!) There are two stories and many, many outlets. Not as much seating as the CP location, but there's plenty to go around.\\n\\nSame coffee, pastries, and teas. Credo coffee is some of my favorite for the quality and sourcing as they use organic, Fair Trade Guatemalan beans and are paying the farmers living wages. Still a donation-based model, which I really admire and respect. I put this in my review of the Credo, but I think it bears repeating, the gift economy model of Downtown Credo is really quite special. There's something about being a part of something bigger than yourself and, at some level, receiving rather than just paying. I've never felt shamed or judged for what I pay, which is unique.\\n\\nThe baristas are friendly, knowledgeable, and overally just interesting people. If you get a chance to chat with the people working, I recommend taking it.\\n\\nCongratulations to Ben and the Credo community!\\n\\nAlso, succulents. Happy succulents to boot.

It's a good burger, but a bit on the heavy side even with a single patty thanks to the sauces. The empanadas and fried yellow potatoes with sausages are also good to try and share.

We stopped by one evening and had an inside both. Next to us was a big counter with lots and lots of family board games; things like Pictionary, Uno, Connect Four, Checkers. I mean real board games. This gave me the impression that they encourage guests to come in and hang out for a while. We have noticed that the parking lot always seems to be crowded.\\n\\nThere was a bustling crowd on the patio out front and lots of activity inside. The food wasn't bad, it wasn't good and the meal wasn't memorable. In place of a bread service they have a jar of what seems to be home made pickles. Yes I said, pickles. That part was memorable and the pickles were delicious.\\n\\nWhat I do remember about the meal is that the menu seemed to be limited with the standard greasy bar choices. The pickles were so good that we asked to buy a jar. The server explained that they no longer sell the pickles because it causes them to run out.\\n\\nBecause of the pickles we may try Vanbarry's another time. If we do we will update our review.\\n\\nI really appreciate that the owner/management at Vanberry's invited us to give them another try after my first review. It shows leadership that is dedicated to taking care of the customer.\\n\\nJust this week we got around to trying Vanberry's for a second time. The service was excellent. I don't recall our server's name, [I'm sorry], but I  enjoyed how engaged she was and some of her funny interchange.\\n\\nSadly, the food has not gotten better; in fact it is worse than I remember. Even the pickles were mushy rather than crisp and fresh tasting.\\n\\nWe sat on the front patio and enjoyed the live music.\\n\\nVanberry's is a very active and busy place. I think it may be more for the atmosphere and the bar rather than the food. Lots of people were enjoying the fun, relaxing buzz in the air. It may sound strange but it is almost like a family-style bar. There are lots of families with kids and although adults are drinking grown-up beverages they are doing it as grown-up adults. It is a fun atmosphere as opposed to a rowdy scene or a pick-up type bar.\\n\\nI was goinh to take a star from Vanberry's for the food, but I will stay at 3-stars because of the atmosphere and the fun of the live music. I am not much of a drinker, I am a foodie, so Vanberry's will not be in my restaurant rotation."},{"name":"Boca Bar","address":"11 Pine St","city":"Waltham","stars":"2.5","text":"I found out about Boca from Groupon and figuring that my wife and I love Latin American cuisine and have been to other authentic places like Tango and La Case De Pedro so we figured we would give this place a shot.  The Moody Street area of Waltham is a hotspot for ethnic cuisine so it had to be good right?  Wrong.\\n\\nAlong with our daughter we came by last Saturday. The place was much smaller than I expected and I didn't mind the bamboo d√©cor.  We were sat immediately and given chips and salsa but it all went downhill from there.  Like with other reviews I have read there was only one waitress who was also working the bar and the entire floor.  It took her 15 minutes just to take our drink order (2 glasses of wine, water and milk).  I wanted to put our entire food order in but she took off so fast.  Then it took another 10 minutes to finally get our wine but not water of milk for our very patient daughter.  Finally we got everything and she was about to walk away again and I almost had to beg to put in out dinner order.  We ordered a Chicken empanada, fish cerviche appetizer, Tilapia, Casado and Arroz con Pollo.   I actually wanted to add another appetizer but wasn't confident that they could pull it off.  Then another 25 minutes go by and we get our entr√©e delivered before our appetizers!  The female server seemed to be a manager so she was very apologetic and blamed it on their computers.  Could it have been because the waitress didn't write down our order?  I told her we have been sitting her for almost an hour and our 3 year old hasn't even been fed.  No restaurant should ever let a child go this long without being served.  So they took our entrees. Comped one of the apps and a round of drinks and got us our appetizers.  The Cerviche was a joke.  A few chunks of fish in salsa.  The empanada was too doughy and tasteless inside.  The meat on the Casado was not seasoned properly which is unheard of in Latin American cuisine.  My Tilapia was ok but nothing special.  \\n\\nI am giving Boca 1 star because of horrible food and service.  I see that all the good ratings are from the kickballers who come on Thursday.   Maybe you guys are too drunk to notice how bad the food is or have no idea what Latin America food should taste like.  Burritos and tacos are gringo food.

In no time, we were greeted by the hostess who confirmed there was two in our party. She let us know there was a 30-45 minute wait for a table or we could try and find seating in the bar area. After a brief discussion between us, we decided we'd like to wait. At that point the hostess told us they do not have a waiting list and by the time we sat down the kitchen would \\"basically be closed\\" so we should just try and find a seat at the bar. \\n\\nWe would have appreciated if she let us know that when we walked in and not given us the option of sitting at all. There was a hour and a half until the kitchen closed, so if we sat in 30-45 minutes, the kitchen would most definitely have been open.  We left after being treated so short and ate at Prato right down the road.  I am still interested in eating there even though my first experience was less than enjoyable.

Simple deco, chatty french servers, great coffee and dessert to cap off the night. Overall I am satisfied and will return. Two page dinner menu is quite simple, appies on the front and mains are listed on the other side. Nothing pretentious on the menu, there are salmon, lincod, steak, mussels, duck breasts etc and you can add side such as fries for $6-7. For an appy, I shared leek tart with my dinner date. Arguably this place is new and there are many curious diners. Since the restaurant doesn't take any reservation, during the peak times food will come very slow...slowwwwww. The tart has very buttery, flaky base (wonder how much butter is in this..) and a small heap of leak and potato? mixture topped with a bit of greens and mini potato chips. It was savory alright but didn't blow me away with flavors for $12 price tag. The mains also took awhile to come. Crusted lingcod was alright, fairly small portion. Other than half of grilled endives and two small pcs of crusted ling cod, there wasn't much else. The duck breast on the other hand had three relatively large pcs of duck breasts and also half of grilled endives and half of grilled potato. I didn't know that duck break was this tough? I was trying to keep pace with my friend who had ling cod but regardless it took me much longer to finish my dish. The flavors are well balanced and I really liked the simply grilled endive more so than the duck breasts. As I was told the desserts and coffee here are fantastic, we shared praline creme (not sure of the exact French name) and latte each. The dessert was good and the praline cream tasted exactly like the fillings of ferre rocher if you need a comparison. Latte was done well though I am unsure where they get their beans from. Service is quite attentive and given there are at most 3 servers and a bartender on Friday nights they do a great job with smiles on their face.

However, I am sad to report that it was a very disappointing experience all together to deal with them both as a customer and as an event planner. \\nI contacted the manager a month before the party to make sure that the details of the menu and number of guests and quoted price were arranged ahead of time.\\nWell, then the manager was gone for nearly 2 weeks and I didn't hear back from her on the final price or some corrections I needed on the contract she emailed me. So I fixed the typos MYSELF and arranged for a meeting with the restaurant owner. \\nAfter meeting with the owner and requesting he send me a corrected copy of the final menu/contract  (have to make sure they get this right this time), he proceeds to charge my card twice for the deposit amount which spiraled my bank account into the negative. Luckily banks can arrange to intervene on your part!\\nSo after this headache and embarrassing situation, my stomach is in knots the day before my dinner. \\nSo the day of the graduation,  my family arrives from both corners of Texas to the dinner, tired and hungry and if you were in downtown Austin on May 21st, at 12am, you would know what I mean. \\nI sit down and take a look at the menu, and once again, the menu is wrong!\\nThen the steaks come.

Attentive service, friendly people, excellent food, and the decor and environment were enjoyable as well. \\n\\nThe Place -\\nArtist Point is located in the serene environment of Disney's WIlderness Lodge Resort. When I first arrived at the Lodge I was immediately taken away to a \\"Cabin In The Woods\\" type of a feel and it was a great place to escape to. The Lodge itself is like a gigantic log cabin with the decor inside and outside to match. Artist Point is located on the main floor just passed the breathtaking main lobby. The restaurant itself feels very open with high ceilings and plenty of windows for you to look out and enjoy \\"nature\\". There's plenty of booths and tables spread throughout the entire restaurant, but don't be fooled, those tables tend to fill up rather quickly and, sometimes, even only done so through reservations. I REALLY enjoyed the \\"natural\\" atmosphere Artist Point created. It truly is a great place to visit and see.\\n\\nThe Service -\\nIf you have seen my previous reviews of all the other places I visited in the Orlando area, you'll notice that I was in town for a Conference & Expo; Artist Point, was one of the places I visited towards the last part of my trip. Again, I made reservations for a party of 1 in case when I got there, there was no seat at the bar. I arrived fairly early and was immediately greeted by a beautiful hostess, who's name I forgot, but remembered she was from New Zealand; VERY friendly face and kindly let me know that they were able to seat me right away, which is always a plus....under promise, over deliver...that seems to be the motto I enjoy seeing carried throughout all the restaurants I visit. She directed me up to another hostess table where I was greeted by another friendly face who led me to my table. Upon sitting down, I was immediately greeted by my waiter for the evening and received nothing but great service from the waiter. A lot of people tend to want to have a complete experience from start to finish and Artist Point delivered on all aspects regarding service. Great job!\\n\\nThe Food -\\nAgain, after attending a bunch of workshops and meetings throughout the day, I worked up quite an appetite during this particular evening. After reading reviews on Yelp in addition to taking a look at the sample menu online, there were quite a few dishes I wanted to try. For my appetizer I went with the Confit Natural Bacon, which was served with a Sunny Side Up Quail Egg, a chow mein garnish, and a blood orange glaze (See Picture). During my stay at Disneyworld and the various restaurants I've had the honor to visit, the appetizers at ALL these places NEVER disappointed and are just as much of a star/feature as the main dish. With that being said, the Confit Natural Bacon was absolutely DELICIOUS!! Now, when people think \\"bacon\\", they think of the bacon they're used to getting at the supermarket in the package. While technically the Confit Bacon that Artist Point serves is the same, the slice itself is much thicker and is regarded as a slice of pork belly, AND cooked in a different manner. The bacon was VERY tender and seems to have been slow-cooked enough for me to be able to cut pieces of the thick slice of pork belly with my fork. The quail egg added a nice touch to it and made for a great flavor profile; however, the orange glaze (sweet and decadent) and the perfect execution of cooking the pork belly is REALLY what made this dish stand out. I HIGHLY recommend this dish to anyone if it's still on the menu! For my main course, I decided to go with the Crispy Buttermilk-Dipped Airline Chicken, which came with an herb spatzle, roasted brussels sprouts, bacon jam (yes, bacon jam), and a garlic tomato broth (See Picture). I love a chicken dish just as much as the next person, and I must say this has got to be one of the best gourmet chicken dishes I've ever had. The chicken was perfectly cooked, moist and flavorful, and the crisp of the skin the chef leaves on made for a great texture contrast. The accompanying accouterments, like the herb spatzle and the garlic tomato broth, tied everything together and made for a really enjoyable main course. For dessert, I went with the Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee, which came with two chocolate-hazlenut Biscotti. It wasn't the best creme brulee I've ever had, but it certainly made for a great way to end the meal and the biscotti was a great touch, both in contrast and in flavor.\\n\\nOverall -\\nAll in all, I'm very satisfied with both the service and food I received at Artist Point. The menu is very focused; however, the food offerings are excellent and, I'm assuming, you can't go wrong with any dish you choose. Swing by the peaceful lodge that is Disney Wilderness and give Artist Point a try...you won't be disappointed!

We've only been twice so far but predictions indicate we'll go many more times.\\n\\nIf you're familiar with Opa on S. Lamar, this is like the North Austin sister restaurant but family-owned and operated. You walk in, order at the counter, and find a table.\\n\\nMy second trip was a few weeks ago and would venture to say I may have enjoyed it even more than the first. This trip I had the lamb plate: sliced lamb, dolmas, salad, tzatziki, pita. Let me tell you - there is nothing like this homemade pita. It's super soft and has a slight buttery flavor. Between that and the made fresh daily tzatziki, I'm more than good. This tzatziki is different than any other I've had before - almost a peppery, spicy hint to it - and I love it.\\n\\nRight after we ordered, she gave us some chicken lemon rice soup (of course homemade) to try. As it was quite chilly outside, it was nice and had really unique flavors, as though you could taste each of the main ingredients. They also bring you these Greek beignets drizzled with honey for dessert.\\n\\nThis time I had some leftovers to take home, which still tasted delicious after warming them up and writing a Yelp review."},{"name":"The Ravenous Pig","address":"565 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"Went in for lunch - had issues getting a reservation over the phone - they put us on hold and never came back.

They presented their truffle fries in a beer pint glass. This served to have all of the fries at the top of the glass be cold by the time it came to the table, and all of the fries in the glass itself soggy and lukewarm. Those in the glass are hard to get at, btw, which forces you to dump them out onto your plate anyway, so why the hell bother with presenting the fries in a silly glass? Attempt at a \\"cool\\" way to present them, but ends up being a major fail.\\n\\nMy folks ordered the cheese burger which came with blue cheese... which essentially overpowered the entire burger. again, little meat to bun ratio on this one as well. Their fries didn't come in a silly glass, but did come extra salted which made them rather inedible.\\n\\nMy wife was seduced by the egg on top of her farmer salad, she seemed to enjoy it, but I had a few bites and was basically underwhelmed. \\n\\nHad high expectations given the great reviews here on yelp but really it's decent but not that great.

She comes back like 2 minutes later (the only time she showed any sense of urgency was when she was getting paid...grrrrrrr) with a twenty in her hand and says, \\"So, your change from the cash was $19 something. What did you want me to do?\\" Uh.......maybe bring us $19 something in change? It was like she expected us to tell her to keep it.

Tables are approximately 12 inches apart, so it's a little cozy, but hey. Our server was very friendly but when asked her favorite choices, she demurred and offered up the \\"most popular\\" dishes.\\n\\nWait a second. No. I want to know what YOU like, because I expect that you've eaten everything and that you have an opinion. I may not agree with your opinion, but I at least want to hear what you think is amazing, and what is worthy of a pass. \\n\\nWe went with one of the \\"popular\\" choices, the Gambas Ajillo, and the prawns were very good - meaty and delicious. We also had Fabada (a.k.a. the best bean soup I've ever, EVER had), and the Mar I Muntanya (meatballs). The Fabada was delicious - rich, smoky, silky... I'd murder for that recipe. The meatballs were good - moist and tender, but not as seasoned as I would have liked. We also had the Seared Iberico Tenderloin, which was perfectly cooked and very tender - delicious. \\n\\nWe finished with a paella - by that point, honestly, we didn't need it, but we soldiered on. Our server had described the Paella Barlata as sort of an \\"everything pizza\\" but on this particular chilly, rainy spring night, I was craving something more homey and solid, so we selected the Arros Cacadora - and it was exactly right for us. Earthy mushrooms, savory bits of rabbit and chicken with a salty tang of pancetta - so delectable. \\n\\nWhen it came to wine, our server was much more willing to offer options and opinions, which we appreciated. She offered up choices that paired wonderfully with our selections but also met our differing preferences. \\n\\nOverall, I like Barlata - good food, lovely choices from both the menu and the wine list. It's a bit crowded and loud, but that seems very Spanish to me.

Their counter is the closest thing to the Garden of Eden on EARTH as far as I'm concerned.  And when it comes to cakes, well, I'm not entirely certain if there's anything on the planet that they can't put on a cake. For example, for our friend's son's birthday they managed to actually make a beautiful cake shaped like a Magellan penguin (don't ask- he used to have a thing for Magellan penguins in particular).  Everything we've purchased here has been top-notch, far from run-of-the-mill, delicious and if I was less honest I'd claim their delicious treats as my own creations any day of the week.\\n\\nHowever, the vacuous staff and unbearable lines (in part attributable to the staff) are inexcusable.  They have hired exceedingly young people from the local high school and they are ill-equipped to handle the demands of such a busy bakery. In addition, I've been unimpressed to discover that the pricing for custom cake design tends to be quite arbitrary. I understand that a cake shaped like a penguin will cost $65 and I won't complain. But when a cake shaped like a square jeep (same kid, new obsession) is quoted at $95, I'm floored and am inclined to whine. When I brought up this inconsistency, the price was adjusted.  The lesson to be gleaned from this is to nail them down on price early on or risk being woefully surprised when the bill comes (if you can manage to brave the line to actually pay it). \\n\\nIf only the staff were as sweet as the treats that they serve here then maybe I'd actually do more than order specialty cakes.

My oldest son has progressed through most of the classrooms (now in their preschool) and has had one great experience after the next in each new environment he encounters. Each teacher is kind, caring, nurturing and experienced and has the best interest of my children at heart. The student/teacher ratio is excellent- my children seem to know their teachers well and talk about them at home like they are family. The other teachers in the school know them by name too- it is a true family environment from the moment you step in the door. \\n\\nThe facility director, Nikiya Rose sets the tone of this educational, but loving environment and she does a great job fostering a play-based learning environment that really focuses on the individual child. Both of my kids have their fair share of medical issues and they have needed special attention and this is never overlooked. I feel totally confident that they could handle any emergency and I can rest easy going to work everyday knowing they are safe. \\n\\n\\nThis is a daycare that doesn't just babysit. They are actually teaching the children in their care everything from life skills to their abcs and I am astounded what they come home with everyday. My three year old came home one day counting to 10 in Spanish and he is learning to write and spell his name, say and read his abcs and not to mention they helped potty train him as well.  He has learned important emotional and behavioral concepts, more so than we could strive to teach him on our own. They set cognitive, developmental and behavioral milestones for each child to reach and monitor their progress in the form of progress reports and evaluations. Most importantly, the teachers seem to generally care about my kids and it is evident in their behavior every day.\\n\\nI have had the opportunity to keep my kids at home with a nanny, but there is no way that they would get this expert care and education in a home environment.

Don't make that mistake! If you're feeding the family you might want to get takeout, because there's not much seating in the restaurant. It's great for a couple of folks who want a great burger, and although I didn't sample more of the \\"ethnic\\" food on the menu, I'm sure it's every bit as tasty as the burgers.

Try one out for yourself.\\n\\nUPDATE:\\n\\nI had to update - and downgrade - my review of Dillons because of 2 recent visits.  They've revamped their menu, and the food is still pretty good.\\n\\nThe reason for the update is due to the incredibly poor service at this place. The hostesses almost always never seem to know what is really going on, or what tables are available.  Asking them questions usually results in 5 seconds of blank stares before you rephrase your question. \\n\\nWhat's worse, is the waitresses really seem to hate their jobs.  One in particular, who served us the past 2 times, didn't seem to even want our table. We sat for a good 15 minutes before anyone acknowledged us, and that was AFTER we went to the hostess to tell her that nobody had waited on us.  Then, when the hostess went to notify our waitress that we had been waiting, she was arguing with the hostess and other waitresses that we weren't in her section.  Do you want my effing tip or not?!\\n\\nWhich leads me to our visit prior to the one mentioned above... We walked in, asked for a table to grab a drink - not eating - which the hostess was well aware of.  She sat us down, and when the waitress came over (by the way, this is the SAME waitress) she wouldn't allow us to stay at her table because it was for people who were going to order food. Every other table in the room was empty, so I asked if she'd mind if we stayed here and if anyone needed our table, we could move. I'd tip her and she'd make money either way. She kicked us out anyway. WTF?!  Apparently this girl loves working for the thrill waitressing, not the money.  \\n\\nNeedless to say, I'll have second thoughts about eating here again.

I think that two stars is fair for both the accomodations and the events services.  I really like to like people and by extension places.   I tend to give the benefit of the doubt more than I should; but two is the best I can do in fairness to all of you.  All in all, our event went very well.  We absolutely hopped on the great rate so overall value was very good.  Two stars is defined as \\"I've experienced better\\", and I  absolutely have.  My rating should not be seen as overly negative, simply objective. Here are some details if interested:\\n  \\nAs several have already mentioned, this hotel site has seen grander days.  Despite my youthful appearance and general immaturity I remember this hotel when it was a Ritz; and it lived up to the name.  There probably has not been a major renovation since.  I did not see any of the 'grime' etc. mentioned by others.  I would describe the rooms as tired, but still clean.\\n\\nThe service is again, OK.  You can tell they are trying to keep some of the iconic tradions of finer hotels; choice of newspaper, nightly shoe shine service, turn-down, good robes, etc.  Giving benefit of the doubt, we'll call this charm.  Like an aged uncle with good stories from his travels abroad.\\n\\nMost importantly, I did not hear any complaints from our client- guests.  And that is a good segue to an events point of view.  I was the meeting stakeholder but not the direct planner.  Folks on my team said the hotel was easy to work with and their eagerness was evident in the price they gave us.  $179 per night in downtown Boston, in the summer, is a great price anywhere.  The food and beverage minimums were reasonable and we knew we would easily meet them.  \\n\\nWe held our first night reception on the 17th floor.  I highly suggest it.  Your out of town clients will get a thrill from the view and you will send brillant pointing out all of the sites.  It is oddly shaped up there but livable.  Breakfasts and lunches were fine.  Typical fare of too much carbs and not enough interesting options.  Perhaps we could have chosen the menu better.  Bottom line, no complaints from customers.\\n\\nThe grand ballroom is again, elegantly-tired, this time like your great aunt that has retired from her wordly adventures but still gets dressed everyday.  I did like the possibilities of the mezzanine though we did not have any need for it.  The design of the room would have made any more than our 75 nearly impossible.  As it was, those of from the host company had to sit in chairs in the back partially blocked by pillars.  Audio visual was fine although we always bring our own IT folks to be sure.  \\n\\nThe main issue to be aware of is your need for break out rooms.  It was very awkaward in that to get from the main room to the break outs our guests had to walk down a flight of stairs and get into an elevator up to the third floor.  This was a little much for some of our guests.

When I saw the 10-course menu at Yokohama Restaurant on Groupon, I was definitely expecting something way more than simply a plate of food, four pieces of sushi, two miso soups and a dessert per person. Let me define this \\"a plate of food\\" (the following is the portion each person receives) - three shrimps, a tiny piece of steak, two tiny pieces of cod, a lot of cheap vegetables (mushrooms, zucchini, bean sprout, and onions), and fried rice with egg. I was not even full after eating this, and I eat little. This is definitely NOT worth $59. I am pretty certain that if I go to any other authentic Japanese restaurant (this one is opened by Chinese people), I can be stuffed by the time I go out. Let us not forget that there is still tax and tips on top of the $59. Although the teppanyaki cook showed us tricks such as lighting the onions on fire and flipping the utensils from time to time, it is definitely not worth it. Even the owner asked us if we were full by the time we paid the bill. She said,\\"if you guys want more, I can bring the menu.\\" What a joke. I will definitely not return, and I warn others to not go to this restaurant either. The reason that Groupon exists is to promote the restaurant. However, it is clear that the owners are trying to rip their Groupon customers off since they cannot earn much money (the location is not ideal, and food is overpriced). By ripping people off on Groupon, they have basically lost a lot of their customers.

I just had a horribly salty taste for the rest of the night and the wateryness was just not nice.\\n\\nMaybe I had bad luck, but that was my experience.

They're like what Red Lobster tries to do, but so much better.\\n\\nWhen you look at the menu, realize that though the dish names are simple and sound like homestyle cooking, what you actually get is something that is truly inventive and original.\\n\\nI ordered the Clam Chowder turned mashed potatoes. Who thinks of something like that? Instead of soup, it was mostly potatoes, with all of the stuff that goes in clam chowder. I LOVE mashed potatoes, so this was a perfect fit for me. Add in clams on the half-shell and seared sea scallops on top, and this dish made me die a little.\\n\\nMy wife ordered the Shrimp and Grits. It was more like cheesy, soupy Polenta and giant Prawns, with a spicy Tobasco sauce and little bits of bacon. The combination was a flavor explosion that was a little bit overwhelming with the number of sensations. I finished my plate and what she didn't eat, it was so good.\\n\\nFinally, when we didn't order dessert, the waiter brought out two spoons on a platter. The spoons were heavy with big dollops of dark chocolate ganache. It was absolutely perfect chocolate, too. That's how you impress a guest.

The only complaint was that the spicy tuna roll was a bit inconsistent from piece to piece in terms of spicyness. \\n\\nAlso I had a beer that was 8 dollars and I thought that was a bit ridiculous. \\n\\nOtherwise, this place is clearly dedicated to serving fresh seafood and we'll definitely stop by again if we're in the Millenia area."},{"name":"Bunk","address":"211 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Pulled pork that is all! \\noh and charming inside something familiar like from your past."},{"name":"50 Plates","address":"333 NW 13th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I went to 50 Plates last summer when I visited Portland.

Yummy."},{"name":"The Ravenous Pig","address":"565 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"The Ravenous Pig is a small chef owned restaurant located in Winter Park, Orlando. Parking can be really tight on the curbs/streets, however they do offer free Valet parking (It's nice to tip though.) \\n\\nThe exterior of the restaurant is very old-fashion styled, the building is made out of bricks and the glass windows were beautifully clean and elegant. The interior was just as lovely as the outside, adorned with exquisite lighting and decors, furnished with modest dining tables and chairs..the atmosphere of The Ravenous Pig was perfect. \\n\\nOne tip if you plan on dining here, please make a reservation! My fellow friend reserved a table for 5 people, so our party was pretty much taken care of as far as seating goes. However, this place is always busy, even on a Monday night! If you don't make a reservation, you're looking at a high probability of waiting at least 30 mins before seating. The hostess was very nice and quick. \\n\\nIf you're read through previous reviews, you have already been informed that the menu at RP chances weekly, and they strive to use fresh local ingredients that are in season. When I first sat down, I was looking at the menu and flipped to the back side thinking there was more platters to be offer! Silly me, it was just the wine menu. Speaking of wine, RP offers an abundance of wine/cocktail selections; all being priced by the glass. \\n\\nAfter looking over the menu for about 5 minutes, my boyfriend suggested to order a salad and a main entree to share. I will tell you yelps audience this, if you have ANY questions about ANY dish at all, do not be afraid to ask your server! Our server was Brett and he was so very helpful in all aspects. To get back to what I was saying.. I'm not much of a land-meat eater, so I opted for one of the fish highlighters of the week. As for the salad we went with Brett's recommendation. My boyfriend's friend was working as a chef, so he brought out a few starters for us as well, thank you man! :) \\n\\nHere is a break down of our dishes: \\n\\nStarters:\\n~ Crispy Pork Belly: Pretty small serving size if you're used to korea/japanese pork belly dishes haha. The outside of the pork was really crispy, not too salty. The subtle flavour of the succulent pork wasn't overpowered by the fava hummus at all. It was a pretty complex dish, I wasn't sure how to navigate through the pickled radish and the hazelnuts... Overall I liked the texture and flavour of the pork. But nothing beats korean crispy pork belly.\\n~The Tacos: Kind of reminded me of sweet coconut shrimp (again, going back to my asian roots.) The shrimp was slightly chewy with a bit of bit to it. The outside coating was glazed with a somewhat sweet sauce it seemed like it, which mellowed down the pungent cabbage slaw. It's on a white corn tortilla, and I know not a lot of people arent fond of corn tortillas unless they are fried, which these weren't. So, you might want to ask for a possible substitute. All in all, this was a pretty nice starter.(:\\n\\nSalad:\\n~ Zuckermann's Farm Asparagus: This is NOT a typical salad dish you would think you're getting. It's like 7 stalks of Asparagus wrapped in prosciutto with an almond side complimentary with some sort of sauce. When it came out, boyfriend and I kind of looked puzzled haha. We weren't quite sure how to eat this..ended up breaking apart the prosciutto and cutting the asparagus into bite size pieces. I think this dish was missing some fresh mozzarella..mmm. Anyways, the prosciutto was THINLY SLICED which is a YES in a my book. It was very salty, and complimented the sweet crisp asparagus perfectly. The almonds were delicious. I love me some good nuts.(:! The verdict? It was really fresh and vibrant, with lots of flavour, I don't think I could have ate the whole thing by myself though. The prosciutto to asparagus ratio was kind of off. Too much prosciutto. \\n\\nMain Dish: \\n~Grilled Canaveral Cobia: To put this aside and out of the way, I LOVE fish. My grandmother is the fish queen, and whenever I eat out, I pretty much find myself looking at fish. Having said that, RP's Cobia was pretty tasty. Maybe the shock of portion size haven't cease to gone down yet. For 27 dollars, the fish size was.. hold on hold on...let me pull out my asian math skills! Two 4X 2X1 fillets. Yes, that seems about right. On the side was a lentil salad, which please be careful when you eat...they get stuck on your teeth. The greens were fresh, as expected, but the fish..hm. It was a very simple grilled white fish, light and tender- yet still maintained a beautiful flake to it. \\nDessert: \\n~Peach,Chocolate,Coconut-Lime Sorbet: VERY DELICIOUS. All the flavours were clean,cut and fresh. \\n~Strawberry Rhubarb Crisp: It was pretty good..\\n\\nAll in all, RP is a GREAT place to dine out on a special date night or occasion. I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a casual dining location, because of the pricing and serving size..\\n\\nTHANK YOU FOR JOINING ME THROUGH THIS LONG..VERY LONG REVIEW.

Tito's is the current well vodka, a nice touch.\\n\\nI had some concerns about the food, based on previous reviews and my gluten allergy. Am I crazy for thinking a sandwich place would have GF options? Turns out, no, I am not. All the heroes are offered \\"skeletor style\\" - no bread - and while not all the sandwich fillings are GF, there are plenty of tasty options. Just stay away from anything fried or panko-crusted. Since I'm a sucker for a good tuna salad, I decided on the Natasha Fatale, made with house cured tuna, Swiss cheese, cucumber, sliced tomato and arugula. I added a side of avocado and finished every single bite. Tuna salad bliss! Next time, I'm going to try the El Guapo, recommended by Jimmy, who also informed us they recently changed their bread vendor, much to the delight of my two dining companions. They thoroughly enjoyed the Bugsy Siegel and the Montgomery Burns, with the latter taking the prize for best hero of the day. \\n\\nNot in the mood for a hero sandwich?

I love a salad with fruit--this one had apples and strawberries with a vinaigrette dressing.  The wedding soup was good--brothy with some loose meaty meatballs.  I'm not a fan of wedding soup, but this is some of the best I've tried.  The chicken parmesan came with two big flattened chicken breasts and a serving of spaghetti and marinara.  All very good.  My aglio olio was awesome--pasta with olive oil, roasted garlic, and olives.  I appreciated that they used good olives--sometimes places will use olives with an off taste.\\n\\nWe ended the dinner by splitting the gelato bomba--spumoni flavored gelato coated in a chocolate shell.

There were probably about 8 of us at our table and the bar was packed that night, so the slow service was understandable.  However, the slow service, lack of attention we got from our server and her crappy attitude all mixed together really, really sucked. It was a Saturday night and they only had one bartender and one waitress working the whole place.... really!?  Poor management!  We literally had to grab our waitress every time we wanted anything because she never came to check on our table, I realize she was busy but it was a little ridiculous that we had to pull her aside to get anything.  When we ordered something as simple as a shot, it still took about 10 minutes, maybe more to get to our table.  However, this is all somewhat tolerable considering the management obviously sucks and totally under staffed for the night, that wasn't her fault.  What isn't ok is the comment our waitress made to the last one of our friends that was waiting inside to pay by credit card.  The rest of our table had paid by cash and was waiting outside... the bartender had come by our table to collect our money.  The waitress said to our friend \\"Really, you guys only left me a 13% tip, that's f*cked up\\".  The bartender correcter her and told her that he had the rest of our money and that we actually tipped her better.  But here's the thing... let's say we did in fact leave her a measly 13% tip, she definitely didn't earn that 13% with her crappy attitude and horrible service, so for her to complain that the 13% wasn't enough is beyond ridiculous.  It is SO beyond tacky to say that to a customer! I too work in the service industry and try to tip well and it was SO hard for me to justify tipping her well when her attitude and the service was so bad.  But I did anyways because I figured maybe it was an off day for her and the bar was extremely busy.  If we didn't have plans to catch the rocky horror picture show across the street immediately after I would have gone in and had this conversation with her personally.  As for the food and drinks... they were ok, nothing special. The adorable decor is pretty much this place's only saving grace in my opinion.  Management should consider staffing better on busier nights and maybe hiring people who aren't rude and ungrateful towards customers.  I would have given zero stars if that were an option, and that's saying something because I very rarely can't find anything nice to say.  Oh wait...

As great as the tater tots were (who doesn't love tater tots covered in cheese and marinara sauce, with fried chicken chunks?), half of it was COLD. I don't even understand.

I got the salmon and she had the halibut.  \\n\\nThe salmon was well prepared and cooked perfectly - I guess I was more in disbelief that someone would charge $50 for a small piece of salmon.  My wife did not fare as well.  When most think of halibut from the northwest they think of thick flakey and fluffy fish.  Her fillet was no more than 1/4 inch thick and it had a hard crust on it.  It absolutely ruined the fish.\\n\\nOverall my meal was good - but not worth the price.  My wifes was a zero.  I feel like we were lured in only to be disappointed with a tourist trap of a restaurant.

My father tried to order Camerones Rellenos (bacon wrapped shrimp), but they were out -- at 6:30 -- and since there are shrimp elsewhere on the menu how are you out, no bacon?  My wife's order came out incorrect and took about 10 minutes to replace.  Meanwhile, my Jalapeno Maize Chicken which had been recommended by the waitress may or may not have been cooked (I only ate the thin side of the chicken breast). Why couldn't I tell if it was cooked, that brings us to the atmosphere.  \\n\\nIt's dark.  It was so dark inside that our neighboring table was trying to read their menu's by candlelight.

There's always the option of doing just regular iced tea if sweets and boba aren't your thing. They also have these great pork and leek mini dumplings and mochi ice cream.  \\n\\nI didn't give it a perfect score due to the slightly cold, tight atmosphere than tends to get irritating when there's even just a few other people if they're being loud. Sticking around on a busy night is almost impossible. I'm really into beverage places being more open and having soft chairs and couches. The place is rather small though so something like that would be pretty unrealistic and these issues can't really be helped.

Of the four breakfast items I've tried, only the Belly Pleaser actually stuck out as being profoundly tasty--so much so that I managed to replicate it weeks later with some coconut milk, honey, cinnamon, and Jasmine rice I'd cooked the night before and needed to use up.  The burgers are tasty, but hardly enough to distinguish themselves from other, cheaper options in town.\\n\\nReally, it's the portion sizes that get me, though--ENTIRELY too small for the price and the wait.

It might not be the best I've had but I always other this dish probably because it brings back memories of childhood when I frequently ate this.\\n\\nAnother fav here are their chow mein dishes.

The tables seemed clean and service looked good. At the counter, the woman was nice, but was not looking at me when I spoke to her. Maybe she's not a good listener, who knows. Anyway, she put in our order. We waited outside as to hear the live music from across the street until the pizza was ready. \\n\\nAt home, we felt the pizza was pretty good. It was not too hard, too soft or too greasy. The flavor was nice, but I did think the sauce was slightly rich. We'd get the pizza again. The toppings were of good quality.\\n\\nThis week, I took our daughter for a dinner as my wife had a girls night out thing. There is no podium or check in anywhere, so I felt uncomfortable trying to find a place to sit. After we sat down, it seemed as if tables are not assigned as I saw a few servers pointing and seemed to be discussing who was going to have us. It wasn't a negative discussion, just odd. Everyone was friendly and our server was johnny on the spot with everything. \\n\\nWe ordered a cheese-bread appetizer, a kids penne and adult penne alfredo. I wish our server would have mentioned how much bread came with the pasta, because I would not have ordered the app. The cheese bread was good, but pricey. It had the right amount of cheese, but could have used a touch more garlic. \\n\\nThe pasta meals had a very nice alfredo sauce. It was on the thick side, but not overly buttery. I enjoyed it. The one thing I was not sure about was how long it was baked (or under a heat lamp). A few pieces of the penne were dried because of it, but overall the dish was pretty good. The garlic bread was rather large, and full of garlic. The bread was excellent, but after the appetizer, I had my fill of carbs. Also, you can order the alfredo with chicken and broccoli, which is very nice. I did think the dish was overpriced though. It was rather small compared with other establishments, but the taste was good. \\n\\nThe kids meal was $4 and included a drink. They do not have milk though. I thought it odd, especially for a place that deals mainly in acidic sauces. Anyway, the dish was the right size and the price was good. It was the same penne I had, so I know they didn't skimp on the quality becuse many places do for kids. \\n\\nOverall, the Flippers seems average with potential to be good. Like other reviewers have stated, it needs to work out it's kinks. We'll try it again soon enough.

We didn't tell the waitstaff we were the owners neighbors but they figured it out when we paid the bill and included the handwritten card he'd given us.\\n\\nWe ordered the fried cactus for an appetizer. For our entrees, my husband ordered the Cowboy steak and I ordered the chicken fried Venison. For dessert we had the chocolate tower which is a brownie topped with chocolate mousse and then covered in ganache. Our dinner was really very good and we'd like very much to go back.  I agree with Julie,  my parents would love this place and when they come back in town that is most likely the very first place we'll take them.\\n\\nThe fried cactus appetizer is like a cross between fried okra and tempura asparagus. It comes with a Shiner Bock queso and a Tequila ranch dipping sauce. The breading also has Shiner Bock in it and it's amazing. I had some of that breading on my venison which was easily one of the best things I've ever eaten. It came with a poblano chile white gravy that also covered the mashed potatoes. Kris' steak was huge and cooked perfectly - the crust on the outside of it was to die for. I also really enjoyed the Cesar Salad that came with the dinner, it was simple and nicely mixed.\\n\\nWe really shouldn't have ordered the dessert as we were already stuffed but couldn't pass it up. It has a slight mocha flavor to it and the mousse is so deliciously light. I don't think I could ever go back to Mesa Ranch and NOT order this dessert.\\n\\nThe decor was, as you could imagine, Southwestern/Ranch style but it's tasteful and not gaudy.

The line for check-in seemed to take a long time, but when we got to the front, a very courteous employee checked my husband in and told us they would move our bags up to the room once it was ready. My husband and I added my name to the room reservation and left with the understanding that they would call us when the room was ready. \\n\\nThey called us, and I came back on my own to freshen up. Again, I waited in a pretty slow line to get my keys. Once I was at the front, a different check-in person told me my husband hadn't added anybody else on the room so my husband would need to be present to check me in. I told the clerk we definitely had added my name. He checked again to see my name was (of course) on the paperwork. He asked me if I needed someone to take my bags up to the room, and I told him that was already taken care of because the first clerk we spoke to had said they would be moved up once the room was ready. He gave me a disbelieving look and told me, \\"That sounds very strange. We don't do that. Do you know who you spoke to? That sounds very strange.\\"  He asked me to move aside and wait for someone to help me because he was sure the hotel did not take luggage tags and move luggage to rooms in advance. The whole time I felt like he thought I was making up the previous check-in interaction. Eventually, the staff in charge of the luggage storage area told me my luggage was not there and I should go up to my guest room and check to see if it was there.  Of course it was. So that whole interaction was unnecessary and took way longer than it needed to.

The tuna was seared and cooked perfectly, but was no better than some other great tuna tartares we've had in the past. The filet, however, was heads and shoulders above.

Definitely not a dine and run to a movie kinda place, go to Oyster to relax, enjoy a bottle of wine with expertly prepared food and forget about time.\\n\\nThe only reason I'm knocking a star off is for the logistics of the restaurant, it was not wheelchair or stroller friendly, washrooms are in the lobby all the way downstairs, and we got tucked into the building's structural crevice.

So why let us order something that you did not have?  Why not come out and tell us this before the food appears.  We also ordered Shrimp with fries and cole slaw and received shrimp with broccoli.  I ordered a side of fruit and received a whole apple (not cut up by the way).\\nThe servers were coming to our table with food for other people asking if we ordered this and that.  They did not know what tables their food was going to and the restaurant was not that crowded.  Overall the service was slow.  One person at the table received their food and the rest of us had to wait a good while for our food to come out.  I was highly disappointed and will probably not go there again.

Not the reception where you gather afterwards and eat cake and laugh, but the actual wedding part.  The reason why is that this is an old house built in 1902, and they have a sweeping staircase.  And though I've never actually dreamed about my wedding before in the last 30 seconds I've decided that it would be really neat to walk down an old wooden staircase with a flow-y dress and veil into the awe-inspired crowd of well wishers waiting below in the crowded, hot entry.  And ghosts.  Let's not forget the ghosts.\\n\\nBecause if you look into Portland lore and tradition, you will discover that this house is haunted.  The benefit being you can have more spirits at your wedding without having to pay more money.  It's just a good deal all around.  For those also interested in making a grand appearance on the staircase just note that there is half of a large puppet hanging from the ceiling over the stairs (see my photo) with a sign attached to its legs saying, \\"Everyone enjoy engaging in eating, entertainment, escape, enlightenment, euphony.  Elsewise, exit!\\"  Haha, alliterations are the best!  This also ensures any \\"not-fun\\" wedding guests will have to immediately leave making things so much more discreet with less hassle.  \\n\\nRimsky-Korsakoffee offers so much more for a wedding destination.  No need to bring a blank journal for guests to sign, as they have blank journals strewn in random spots throughout the house that people have signed over the years and left business cards in.  You can just mix your wedding comments with the rest, and be a part of history that will last long after (a pending divorce) or death.  The words will out-live your vows between the walls of this old house.  Pretty magical stuff.\\n\\nThe other cool thing is that since this was named after a Russian composer they typically play live classical music here like the violin.  Again, everything you need to make your wedding complete already right here as guests can dance a baroque dance if they feel so inclined and you will have a ready made instrument for your staircase entrance if you 'go classic' and play \\"Canon in D\\" or maybe reach a little further 'out there' and have the violinist play the Game Of Thrones theme:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP9OKGY7d-E\\n\\nJust be aware that there is only one bathroom upstairs and it is unisex and aquatic themed with weird paintings on the wall and a bathtub with a colorfully painted dummy with his arms outstretched, leaning up to say hello.  This might make some wedding guests uncomfortable, along with the fact that the house is rigged to make some of the furniture move, rotate and vibrate.  To distract guests from such feelings I suggest playing games, like learning how to spell AND say the name of \\"Rimsky-Korsakoffee\\" as fast as you can in 10 seconds or less.  The nice part about this is that children can participate too, and your wedding becomes educational as well as fun.  You can further this into a discussion of the Russian composer himself if you want to take it to another level.\\n\\nIf you choose to have your reception here after the ceremony the nice part is that the #1 thing Rimsky-Korsakoffee house does is serve cake and coffee.  Bam.  Another built in system that is a turn-key solution for your wedding needs.\\n\\nThe neighborhood around the house is a bit sketchy with confused homeless people milling about, as this was the old industrial part of Portland.  But nothing beats power in numbers, so as a final send off I suggest all the guests grab hands in a united front, and start cheering and screaming loudly in joy as everybody runs as a group down the porch steps and into their adjoining vehicles to ensure the utmost safety.  The only brave soul you will have to leave alone is the photographer as this has got to get captured on video.  And since Rimsky-Korsakoffee does no advertising whatsoever be sure to upload on You Tube and help spread the word for future blushing brides and grinning grooms to find."},{"name":"Dillon's","address":"955 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"We went here on new years day with a couple of friends who were in town.

We decided to sit and eat in the cafe - it has a unique business style with the cafe in the store, and a blurb on the menu that they don't accept tips because the waiters are paid a living wage, which is respectable and similar to what is found in Europe. The staff members were kind and friendly, and knowledgeable about German country and food. We ordered three sausages, standard frankfurter, polish kielbasa, and a Hungarian one. For our sides we had spatzle and a pretzel. The frankfurters and bread were delicious - the spatzle was good for a few bites but the amount of salt was overwhelming. The kielbasa was inedible - nothing like I have ever tasted before in Poland - it was very gritty textured and greasy yet very dry on the inside. We couldn't eat our other sausage either for much of the same reason but I don't claim to know anything about the authenticity of the Hungarian sausage. As for the store, it was definitely a mixture of products from many European countries and not a strictly German store. I have been to just about every Polish store in Boston, connecticut, and brooklyn, and they carried many products I'd find there, but typically for 4x the price (polish mustard at polish store = $1, but $4 here, and same with the exact rye bread I buy at the Polish store for $1.29 was $3.99; chocolate bars that are .99 at any polish store were 3.50). We bought some more of the frankfurters to bring home from the deli and those were much more reasonable.

I finally made my way in last weekend to take my mother and sister out for a nice dinner. We arrived right on time for our reservation and the hostess was warm and welcoming. We were led over to the table by a bubbly and friendly woman. At first I was thinking \\"gee I hate it when restaurants seat me at a table in the wide open\\" but the decor and ambiance was very cozy and we settled in just fine. The lighting was warm and put us in the mood! \\n\\nWe ordered some wine even though I really wanted to try the cocktails. Good wine choices but a few dollars over priced per glass for these particular choices. I've had the exact glass of wine at several restaurants for several dollars less. Oh well, just a few dollars! \\n\\nSince we couldn't decide on what to order we thought it would be fun to just get a lot of appetizers so we could try everything. Chiara also had a few of their entrees available in a small appetizer size dish which worked perfectly. \\n\\nWe had the little neck clams, pumpkin gnocchi, caprese salad, semolina calamari, eggplant & goat cheese hummus and the grilled shrimp salad. My favorite by far was the grilled shrimp salad and the clams. Everything was quite good but nothing wowed me. It was all just Ok/pretty good. None of the items left me craving them, which is generally what I look for. I was expecting a more exciting menu I suppose. This food just seemed a bit bland. \\n\\nWe, of course, had to get dessert. We tried the chef's special which was some sort of chocolate bread pudding. I actually disliked it but I ate it anyways cause a dessert is a dessert! It seemed like maybe there were dates or figs or something and it just didn't work for me with the rest of the dessert...\\n\\nWith dessert I ordered a whiskey. They didn't have a great selection (in my opinion) and nothing older than 12 years so I got the tried and true Macallan 12 with 2 cubes.

This just completely baffled me. If they let it sit for so long that the cubes melted I would expect they fix their mistake instead of just letting the customer deal with it. \\n\\nAll in all, I will probably return to test the waters again and test the cocktails!

This particular location was apparently the closest one that my parents like - there's another one that's closer but my parents assured me that that location was not good.  So it was off to this location on Kirkman that we went.  \\n\\nMy parents, sister, and I each had our dishes made of various combinations of bacon, sausage, eggs, waffles, and French toast - your typical Denny's fare.  It was all good and greasy like you might expect it.  The service was friendly and the restaurant was ok in terms of cleanliness.  At the end of the meal, my sister and I shared a Bacon Maple Sundae.  What is that, you ask?  That would be vanilla ice cream in maple syrup, with pieces of crispy bacon dipped in the ice cream.  Yes, that's right.  Ice cream + maple syrup + bacon.  Well it sounds delicious, but actually it just tasted kind of weird.  The bacon didn't really go with the vanilla ice cream and maple syrup.  And my stomach was acting up in the car later.  Or maybe that was just my sister's driving.  \\n\\nBut Radford T., you may ask yourself, could you not have made a Bacon Maple Sundae at home?  And was Denny's REALLY the first restaurant you wanted to visit when you arrived in Orlando?  Yes, and yes.  \\n\\nYou see, Denny's and I go way back.  My opinions of it was of pure disdain in the mid-90s following the infamous racial attack outside one of its restaurants in Syracuse (http://asianweek.com/082297/morenews.html).  But then a few years later I ended up living in Orlando, the land of a thousand Denny's, where the only restaurants still open during the very early morning hours were, well, Denny's.  The 24/7 operating hours of Denny's was crucial to me during my club rat days, when I spent many drunken nights grinding up against random hoochies, and being dissed by even more random hoochies, only to find comfort at the end of the night in the bosoms of Denny's bacon lathered in grease, sausages composed approximately of half sodium, and pancakes swimming in syrup.  So to me, eating at Denny's in Orlando after years of seperation was like an embrace from an old mistress from a past long gone."},{"name":"McDonald's","address":"2875 SE Powell Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"2","text":"How you feel about Mickey D's aside, there's good McDonalds franchises and there's bad McDonalds franchises.\\n\\nThis is one of the latter."},{"name":"Mama Gina's Pizzeria","address":"19 Union Sq","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"This was my goto pizza place when I first moved to Cambridge.

Don't come if you're in a hurry.  Plan to spend 2 hours at dinner, and you'll be fine.\\n\\nOn to the food!  I'm happy to report serving sizes have improved.  Well, for the salads anyway.  I had the seasonal Harvest Apple salad, and gotta say.. it was one of the best salads I've ever had.   Yeah.  Bitter greens, roasted apples, hazelnuts, pomegranate seeds and chunk of blue cheese.  Ohmahgawd... so good.\\n\\nThe burger I had avoided because the truffle fries were way too truffley for me.  I had to do it this time though, and after one bite, I'd been converted.  The Ravenous Pig has the best burger in town.  Yes... yes it does.    ...For now anyway!\\n\\nSo bottom line, when every element of my meal can qualify as 'one of the best ever...' the place is a 5 star joint."},{"name":"One Under","address":"476 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"A Christmas gift for DH and me, we brought a few friends along for the ride and spent more money indoor golfing than we do outdoor golfing. Honestly, I am tempted to drop the rating down to three just based on value alone. \\n\\nIt's pretty tough to justify 50 bucks an hour (which works out to basically 50 bucks per person playing golf) to hit a ball at a screen. It's so loud at night you can barely have a conversation and golf, and once you factor in some eats and drinks, it easily becomes a one-to-two hundred dollar night. To play golf.

I don't think of them as a chain, even though they obviously are.  Lunches under $10 without a drink purchase, are becoming harder and harder to find.  Luckily, Blaze is still there with their unlimited toppings option for me to get my fix at a fairly good price point.  \\n\\nWe went on opening night, right before they closed, for the free pizza day.  I figured it was a mad house at dinner time.  The wait was about 20 minutes and they ended up closing the doors a few minutes after we arrived, phew.  I like how the line has demarcation points and winds around to the counter.  The one in Fenway does not have this and it really needs to be added.  \\n\\nThe array of toppings are the draw here, although I was a bit grossed out with the amount of cross-contamination I witnessed as the workers quickly threw down one and picked up another.  Basil floating in the ovalini cheese, veggies strewn about in the wrong trays.  I hope they can clean up their act when the crowds aren't as nuts.  I ended up piling on about eight different things and did not order a drink, although the aqua frescas here are the BOMB.  \\n\\nI can't fully fault them for rushing pizzas through on opening day but it was definitely undercooked and needed another 30-60 seconds to get the dough finalized.  I ate half at home but ended up cooking the leftovers more through the next day on my pizza stone at a high temp.  \\n\\nPlease be careful with cooking and the toppings ending up together, with the amount of allergies and whatever else is out there that people can't have for a variety of reasons.

I really do.\\n\\nThey are one of the only coffee places in Salem that a) stay open past 8pm or b) don't have bands or open mics or what-not at night, so you can actually meet a friend for coffee.  The atmosphere is fun/retro/80's and they recently really improved the seating setup up-front by moving the product shelves to a more appropriate area.  They do have soy milk and vegan options, so that is a plus.\\n\\nAll that being said, I have always felt like I was intruding or something when I walk in there.  The staff (owners?) are usually sitting out at a table in the cafe and stare at you as you walk in and constantly glance at you during your visit.  I always feel like they want me to leave.\\n\\nI only ever get coffee or lattes, and they are decent enough but not great.  Some of the staff don't quite look skilled in any of the steamed drink procedures, so maybe they just need more education/practice to get drinks right.  The way they cash people out there is really messed up... you order but they don't take your payment then unless you sort of offer it.  Then they bring your order to you, but again... they don't really tell you that.  So, you just sort of stand there awkwardly in a weird game of server-customer chicken to see who will break first to ask or tell what is happening.  \\n\\nI can imagine that they get more than a few accidental walk-outs with this weird payment system, since once I have visited with a friend and bussed my dishes to the dirty dish area, I could EASILY see myself forgetting to pay.\\n\\nAgain, I will continue going to Coven because it's never a bad experience there - just awkward - and the other options in Salem for nighttime coffee are either closed by 8pm or have music... but I hope they continue to work on streamlining their service because it has a lot of potential."},{"name":"Tavern In The Square","address":"120 Beverly St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"This location is close to my home and job.

Pleasant ambience.  \\n\\nThe \\"everything else\\":  My husband took me here for my birthday, so we were hoping for a special dinner, based on some very good reviews.  My first inkling of impending doom was when I looked at the prices ---  $14 to $18 for appetizer-type offerings, and around $30 for entrees.  Pricey, but I supposed it was do-able if my socks were going to be knocked off.  From the appetizer-y portion of the menu we ordered dishes with crab, with scallops; with matsutake mushrooms, and with spaghetti squash.  My husband ordered a beef entr√©e.   We were also served some bread-like objects (rock-hard and grease-soaked \\"rolls\\" - the first of many \\"WTF?\\" moments of the meal)\\n\\nNow I need to make clear: I am not a big eater.  I often get a salad and an appetizer, or a salad and just have a few bites of my entr√©e (and take the rest home for lunch the next day).  When our food arrived, my eyes grew wide and my jaw dropped.  Not in a good way.  There was approximately 1 tablespoon of crab salad on my husband's plate and a few tiny leaves of herbs.  My \\"scallop\\" dish consisted of 2 paper-thin ribbons of carrot and yellow squash, 2 paper-thin slices of daikon and beet, and a few little nubbles of not-very-fresh-tasting scallops.  Bleccch.  The mushroom dish was about one-third of a seared mushroom stem, with a few raw mushroom slices on top, surrounded by a \\"beef gel\\" that tasted like the Campbell's Beef Consomme from my childhood.  Bleccch again.  The spaghetti squash dish had perhaps two tablespoons of squash topped with uni (which was actually very fresh) and some oversalted broth.  The flavors did nothing at all for each other - the whole was definitely NOT greater than the sum of its parts.  *sigh*  The beef entr√©e was small but had good flavor.  Not nearly enough aioli to enjoy with the meat.\\n\\nI do not recall ever walking out of a restaurant still hungry, but this was a first.  I actually stopped to get a bite to eat on the way home.

Makes sense: you can end up with a pretty gross slice now and again, but in the moment, it's sustenance, and sometimes that's all you need. I'm a big believer in this idea when it comes to take-out, as I thought the same idea could be extrapolated to all sorts of different cuisines (especially those of the variety that take fewer than fifteen minutes to prepare). \\n\\nI thought I knew bad takeout in recognizing that Americanized Chinese food is not the most authentic thing in the world, it's gloppy, it's a lot of fried things, and on the scale of food in general, it's somewhere near the bottom in terms of overall goodness -- but again, it's sustenance, and sometimes that's all you need.\\n\\nCanton Eatery has shattered everything I wanted to believe about takeout. It's past the accepted level of \\"bad\\" that comes with ordering off a flyer left in your mailbox. It's past the level of \\"bad\\" that you can be okay with because it's two in the morning and you're in your airport hotel and it's the only place that will deliver. Know the \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\" idea behind something being \\"so bad, it's good\\"? That idea is completely dead to me.\\n\\nWhat's unfortunate is that this badness really just comes down to one issue. Okay. Think Americanized Chinese food. Explain it to me in ten words or less. Ready? Go. Did you say something like \\"fried breaded nuggets of protein coated in a thick sauce\\"? Good. You get a fortune cookie. When properly executed, this combination might not be authentic or highbrow, but getting it right means striking a surprisingly careful balance: a too-thin sauce, falling-off breading or tough meat can throw everything into a tailspin. \\n\\nBut the worst possible way for that to go wrong? Frying in old oil. (Since I can't bold or italicize it, here it is again, for emphasis: Frying in old oil.) It's impossible to save food that has been done this injustice -- off flavors in broken-down oil can't be covered up, no matter how high the concentration of various glutamates in your food is. It's simple, really: when your sesame chicken tastes more like fish than anything else, and that fishiness has completely permeated the sauce, and the whole thing tastes and smells like one big fishy mess, that's not \\"so bad, it's good\\" -- that's \\"so bad, it makes you fully aware of how bad it is, and how bad you are, and how bad all the bad things you've ever done are, and you've got parking tickets to pay, and you never call your grandparents any more; in summation, you are a bad, bad person\\". \\n\\nCome on. Ordering shamelessly unhealthy takeout is about escapism: an impulsive dismissal of better options for a moment of sweet, conveninent hedonism.

The car was parked, and luckily on their sandwich board they have the menu there for all to see. After going through the menu with our eyes we decided to step into this place and try a plate.\\n\\nThis place is lively, from the loud noise of the music playing, to the loud people and the servers that are dressed in jeans and a 'Chewies' t-shirt, this place is relaxed and has a fun atmosphere to it. When we go on date nights we usually like to sit where the action is, and on this night we sat at the bar, not the drinking bar, but the area right in front of the kitchen to see how these guys cook up the food that is about to go down our throats. It's always interesting seeing what your paying for, especially seeing it made from scratch to the creation that sits in front of your face. We were just in for a snack and we ordered the 'BBQ Shrimp & Grits'. \\n\\nWatching our chef throw things in the cast iron skillet was a treat in itself, and our anticipating taste buds couldn't wait to eat the dish we were seeing created in front of us. We had this thing delivered to us right off the fire, and it was piping hot. The grits were a perfect texture, smooth, but with a little graininess, and mixed with the rosemary BBQ sauce, was just comfort food on this dark cold day. The shrimp they used was peeled right to the tail, and each small piece was plump and juicy. The meal may look small, but it was not for us, grits can be pretty filling, and you may be fooled by the look of this. I liked how engaged the staff was to things like describing the meal, asking how our food was, and just being down to earth. This is not fine dining, this is fun dining Southern style.\\n\\nIf I had more of a stomach the fried chicken is on my radar of foods to order. I will be back with my partner, as I know there were other things on the menu to her liking.

I always scratched my head why some parents bring children to upscale restaurants when clearly they Should be taking their children to Denny's or some other 'family' restaurant! Let me speak English clearly. You don't take children to upper scale restaurants. The last thing people want to do is to go to a very nice place and listen to annoying children being loud!!!! Or worse a baby crying! OMG that one really takes the cake. Some people just have no class. Let's get off the subject of the ignorant nay sayers or neg bags. \\n\\nThe fact is this is an obvious restaurant geared for a more upscale customer (not families, children or dogs!) thank God. Our kind of place. The first compliment I want to make is the ambience is fantastic, from the decor to the very large windows that open to the street side on both sides of the building. The staff was very friendly and down to earth. Prices were inexpensive, I think they should raise their prices! This would even further help keep a more high end clientele. In viewing the menu I knew the food was going to be good just based on how they were putting their goods together. 95% of all Mexican restaurants make generic Mexican food! Yes, that food is good as well but, once in awhile you will come across a rare find. I've been all over the world and the only upscale Mexican restaurant I have found is Javier's in Newport Beach, and Irvine CA and they have valet service as well. The food was good. I like how they allow you to have on sone items various options with a variety of flavors and spices. The Queso was just ok it's more of a bean dip with some cheese. They need to reverse it have less bean dip and a lot more Queso. With the Street Taco's they should allow you to pick what meat you want inside. Here they give you 5 taco's 1 type of meat per taco. We found we preferred 2 of the 5. Chips and salsa were good. Salsa could be a bit more spicy. But the way they make it will allow more people to enjoy it. I would recommend having 2 salsa's and let the customer get what they want. I like spicy, my wife doesn't.  The best plate I had was the Spicy Mexican Shrimp with habanero sauce and a Jalape√±o Corn Bread. This plate was amazing. At the end of the day I told my wife, \\"Why would we go to any other Mexican place when we can come here for the ambience\\"? Most people take pics of the food. I never understood that. To me it's all about the atmosphere. But, then my wife and I like the nicer places wherever we go. Not everybody does not can appreciate them either. \\n\\nWe just moved to The Pearl and have not been to another Mexican in Portland prior to The Matador. No need for us to look any further!\\n\\nOh, and we'd like to thank Carah our server.

The Cuban was delicious- full of stuff and very flavorful: roast pork, Swiss cheese, ham, special marinade sauce and we got everything on it- lettuce, onions, tomatoes, pickles, mayo and mustard.

When the soup dumplings came, they were literally portioned for ants... we also got the most popular dumplings and there was hardly any filling in them compared to other similar places. Also, it was not cheap. We do not recommend this place, save your time and your money and eat elsewhere."},{"name":"Rail Stop Restaurant & Bar","address":"96 Guest St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We came here for lunch for restaurant week.  \\nDecor: Beautiful,  polished, comfortable. \\nService: Very good,  prompt, friendly \\nBeverages: We had craft beers. The selection was small, but decent. With the closing of Sunset in Allston there's an opportunity to cater to the beer snobs of Brighton/Allston. Expand your taps!\\nFood: Started with the clam chowder. It was delicious, but more like a bacon, potato chowder. I'm glad I got it, but if you're looking for briny clam chowder, you'll be disappointed.  This yummy stew was very bacon forward. I followed with the burger.  It came with amazing fries. I always order well done fries and this chef was one of the few that got it right. Delicious! I could have skipped dessert. It was a very plain sponge cake with no sauce or frosting. I hope it's not on the regular menu.

From the moment I stepped off the Mears shuttle, I was greeted by a gentleman (who worked for the Hyatt) who was extremely friendly and sweet. Checking in was a bit of a wait, but again, the staff (I believe Annah) was very helpful and accommodating. They Hyatt places a $70 hold per day on your credit card. I did not like this at all, so instead Annah stated that I could just pay the resort fees up front ($22 a night) and anything additional (offered by the hotel) I would just pay upfront. Now, for the few hiccups that I experienced, the room wasn't the most clean. I mean, don't get me wrong, it wasn't trifling dirty, but there were noticeable spots that were dusty, mirrors and windows with fingers prints and water marks. The following night when I got back to my room, the house keeper who tended to my room did an amazing job. Tables and mirrors that were dusty and finger printed, were now spotless and clean. Just a complete 180 from the previous night. The housekeeper was so good in fact that the $4-5 that I forgot on the night stand was noticeably missing when I got back. I mean, I don't mind lol but I don't know if the policy is whenever their is loose money left on the table that it's meant as a tip? But other than that, I truly enjoyed my time at the Hyatt.

Stayed in the older tower the room was nice. A few things could use improvement. Mainly the carpet seems like it gets wet a lot so in areas it is pretty crispy. Most everything was fine and staff were more than accommodating. Upon check in the first room we got had a soaked hallway. Like the bath had overflowed. They didn't hesitate to move us and upgrade us. However , a BIG convention came in a few days later and at that point I think we would have been hard pressed to have been moved or upgraded.

I will say that the portions are a little smaller than they used to be, but I get it...I bet they threw away a lot of food before, so it makes sense, I'm not knockin' them for that.  \\n\\nMy friend Carlos' feedback on the Lomo Saltado is that he felt it weird that the French fries were thrown in the gravy.  I have to agree, I like to decide which goop to dip my fries in.  \\n\\nThe only negative thing I would say about El Buzo is that they might need a more extensive wine list.  The only white wines by the glass are 2 Chardonnays...I'd like to see a better list with Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio options.  That would make my Peruvian dining experience complete!  \\n\\nAll in all, I'm giving El Buzo 5 stars because I have always had a favorable dining experience here, and I always look forward to my next trip back!

It has a strong  garlic flavour and not your every day fixin's. It's topped with baby arugula, which provides a nice buttery freshness and dried fennel that adds a crisp saltiness to each bite. I got the set of three sliders because it's rare to see veggie sliders on a menu and really who can resist those cute little guys?! The patty is crispy on the outside and I like how it isn't just a big indecipherable mush. You can actually see bits of the ingredients like the edamame beans, portabellini mushrooms and tofu. The soft brioche bun is dressed with a really creamy and fresh tasting cilantro aioli. I feel the burger is missing a tart or acidic flavour though, which maybe tomato could provide.  The taste is a little flat since it's dominated by just the strong garlic and salty flavours.  The patty also has goat cheese, so unfortunately it's not vegan. \\n\\nThis burger comes with fries. No complaints there. What makes the fries really great are their selection of  aioli dips like truffle, miso, chipotle and cilantro  (an extra $2).  I must point out that there is also a deep fried ice cream on the menu (yes DEEP FRIED), if you're looking to go all out. \\n\\nThis place is located right on Granville Street in late night party central. We went in the daytime on a weekday for lunch and it was pretty busy with the working crowd.  It's not big, but has a very spacious feel with high ceilings and white and metal d√©cor.  I can see how it would get pretty busy in the evening and late night with lots of activity at the bar, which dominates most of the restaurant.\\n\\nThe service was a bit slow, but not terribly so. Our server apologized several times about the wait and warned us before we ordered in case we were in a rush.  Overall it's pretty casual, at lunchtime at least. We seated ourselves when we arrived.\\n\\nThere are not many other vegetarian options on the menu other than the salads.  But, for a place that has the following Mark Twain Quote on their website \\"Sacred Cows Make the Best Hamburger\\", I'm surprised they have a veggie burger at all! (Poor cows!!!) So, all things considered, it's a pretty creative and unique take on the veggie burger.

For these shrimp and crab cakes, that was not the case. The side of greens and the remoulade sauce where great compliments, but they made sure it did not steal the show. The shrimp and crab cakes also weren't packed with filler. You can actually taste it. \\n\\nMy entr√©e that I ordered was the scallops. While I had this as my main, I tried two other entrees including the Beef Tenderloin and the Pork Tenderloin. I can't even say I liked one better than the other because they are all amazing, and artfully plated as well. That made for an enjoyable eating experience. \\n\\nOut of the three, ironically so, I really liked the pork tenderloin the most. I kept saying that I didn't like pork tenderloin, and here I am with having had that as a favorite.  I thought I would like the mashed sweet potato that came with it, but I actually liked the pea puree on my scallops better. That one I was quite unsure about.  On to the Beef tenderloin, the beef tenderloin was perfectly tender. I also loved the selection of carrots. Carrots, really? Yes, they had several different types of carrots, white, orange, and purple. Which I have never had the other two varieties.\\n\\nI really liked the scallops with the pea puree together. I never knew that would be a combination but it worked out very well. I did think the scallops were a bit salty for me, but never the less still very appetizing.\\n\\nAll three of these entrees are definitely not going to steer you wrong, and will definitely be enjoyable.\\n\\nFor our dessert we had the sampling of fruit desserts including a key lime pie, a strawberry mouse, and another fruit dessert. All were a wonderful touch of sweetness that made our dinner at the Wave perfect.\\n\\nThanks to our wonderful server as well. He was quite helpful as well as a bit entertaining. He shared with us of how all of the ingredients they use come from local places and farms. \\nDefinitely a plus!  \\n\\nIf you are looking for a great place in Disney World, consider The Wave.

A very long history and the first coffee house in this town according to Wikipedia.\\n\\nThe house  stands since 1902, the business since 1980. Quirky, odd, spooky, mysterious and haunted are words that have consistently been used to describe it. Articles have been written about it. Destinations planned. Tables move on their own. Coffee has been drunk and cake and sundaes have been devoured. The bathroom even has a following. \\n\\nRimsky-Korsakoffe is a Portland tradition named after a Russian composer. It is a place that helps keep Portland weird. Just because it has quirks, doesn't mean it's bad. This place has been in business for a long time. It means the desserts and the coffee are top notch and you need to find yourself here at some point during your trek to Portland.\\n\\nIt has a relaxed feel with a live acoustic guitar player strumming away at classical tunes. The man has been playing here for 30 years. College students and the young at heart have been coming here for decades and the house still stands. Laughter and small talk. Readers, writers, composers, card players do their own thing. Nothing is rushed, nor is the service on a Friday night. Packed house, two people working.  It was a bit hard to pin someone down.\\n\\nThe specials for the night were a chocolate layer cake, a cobbler and carrot cake. The desserts on the menu are well known and the banana split is something to yearn for. My housemate got carrot cake and coffee and I went with the chocolate layer cake over the chocolate pot de creme or brownie sundae. Any of the three would have been worth it.\\n\\nThe red lighting adds an eeriness to the atmosphere and the food has a different cast to it. But the layer cake is simply amazing. I wasn't a fan of the carrot cake because of added pineapple to it. I'd never seen that before. \\n\\nOverall we had a great experience at Rimsky-Korsakoffe (my housemate has been coming here for 23 years, and me, the newbie). I will most definitely return. How I used to walk past this place when I lived in Buckman amazes me. You'd never know a coffee house existed with so much history. Oh and do check out the bathroom, and bring cash.

Awesome beer selection and nachos, good Friday night band. There was a five dollar cover charge for the live music but was well worth it. Bartenders and wait staff are awesome."},{"name":"Bluhouse Market & Cafe","address":"4342 Gallant Avenue","city":"North Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Would you like hepatitis with that???\\n\\nThey don't wash their hands!!! After handling money they will prepare food. \\n\\nMoney (especially bank notes) are the dirtiest filthiest things to handle. HIV, AIDS, Clostridium Diffcle (and other things that come from human feces) are on money; and can become easily contracted. \\n\\nOk... I was in Deep Cove, and \\"Honeybun\\" was too busy . So... I tried the Bluhouse cafe. \\nI ordered just a regular coffee, and found out the Americano was not much more. After looking over the treats; they were overpriced and undersized $4 +.\\n\\nAfter ordering my coffee, giving the clerk my money, and getting my coffee... I seen the same girl who took my cash (and another customers) immediately start preparing food with her hands. She didn't first wash, but made the food, pawed her grubby hands all over a crepe, and then served it to someone!\\n\\nSorry for grossing you out but... At least 95% of the population does not wash after having a Bowell movement a.k.a \\"taking a dump\\". And then in restaurants they handle your food; YUM!\\n\\nThe servers were friendly and nice enough, but WHAT THE F**K!! It doesn't  take a genius to figure out to wash your hands before making food. Obviously they're not Einsteins or they wouldn't be working in a crappy service job.\\n\\nMy overall review and advice is: Stick to the beverages only! Otherwise you risk getting violently ill or dying, then call FOODSAFE BC, and the Board of health if you see them not washing their hands when preparing food.\\nThen instead, go down the street to honeybun. At least everybody knows it's not healthy there and the donuts will give you a corinary."},{"name":"Sushi Katana","address":"4192 Conroy Rd, Ste 103","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is awesome!

It has a fun, funky vibe and the peppercorn crusted steak was extremely tender - all four of us at our table savored every bite of our orders.
