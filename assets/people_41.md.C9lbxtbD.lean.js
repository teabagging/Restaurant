I am a HUGE FAN. It's a mostly air/roof top bar. It is adjacent to the ALOFT front desk on the 2nd floor. There were huge big screen televisions, great variety of seating and games (A Jenga stack was on most table tops). I sat down for a few minutes and was greeted by a young woman named Tressa (WHO IS THE BOMB.COM). She patiently checked on me, made sure I had everything I needed. I was saving the corner spot for 8 additional friends and didn't want to start without them.  She checked on me frequently throughout my half hour wait. She recommended drinks and explained the various chips and dips (there is a pretty good variety).  I was even more impressed with her positive attitude, it was hot and starting to get pretty busy.  She provided an above and beyond customer service experience, EVEN as our party grew. (Some service staff become frustrated when there are multiple tickets and people.) She was extremely personable, checked on us frequently and continued to provided excellent drink recommendations to adjust to our style preferences.  While the ingredients were listed on the menu, she took the time to let a few people know how the change would impact what you were used to , e.g. someone in another post complained about the Sangria (it's actually good, but NOT a Sangria and that was explained in advance).  \\nHIGHLY recommend asking for  TRESSA!!!! \\nRegarding  the incident the week before, there was NO evidence that this establishment is biased, racist, or unwelcoming in any way. The DJ played a fantastic variety of music and did so seamlessly; like any good DJ set they ended the night matching the tone and vibe of the house music (we hardly noticed they packed up and left). This is SUPER important in a town where people LOVE to bar hop. For us, that's was a HUGE PLUS because we could keep the night and the party going without having to take a ride share someplace else. \\nSide note - There is LITTLE, if any ROOM to dance so don't think you're going to break out the dancing shoes, it's strictly for socializing, drinking,  vibing, listening to live music/dj sets and chilling.\\nCaroline's downstairs  - AMAZING FOOD.

The whipped lardo didn't taste like anything and I was wondering if I was missing the point. Beef poke was refreshing but it had weak flavor. The smoked diver scallops were actual mouth orgasms. The over-saltiness of the roe perfectly matched the mellow flavor of the potatoes and creme fraiche with the smokiness of the scallop in the background. Braised lamb neck was also excellent. The lamb neck had delicious gamy umami flavor and it balanced well with the mild ricotta dumplings.

Where nothing really went together.  Well, this is Houlihan's.  The decor didn't match the food.  The waitress didn't match the wine list.  The outside of the restaurant didn't match the inside.  It just didn't match.\\n\\nOn the outside, this Houlihan's looks like it might have been a Mexican restaurant a week ago, even with the big flashing sign advertising the $5.99 breakfast special.  When you walk in, the decor looks remarkably upscale...certainly for a place with a $5.99 breakfast.\\n\\nWhen we were seated, we were struck by the wine list.  Anchored by the $900 bottle of Opus One and the $1,900 bottle of Lafite-Rothschild, we thought that it was a bit much next to have with quesadillas or spinach dip.  So the waitress asked, \\"do you all want happy hour?\\"  Not knowing what that meant, she explained that it was 2-for-1 drinks, including their \\"micro-brew\\" Houli-Red.  Not only do they have a $1,900 bottle of wine, they also have a brewmaster in the back?!  This is too good to be true.\\n\\nNow... all 4 of us ordered the Houli-Red.  Doing simple math, we figured that this would mean that 2 of us drink for free.  But our waitress apparently multiplied instead of divided, and she brought out 8 ice cold glasses of Houli-Red, which were nice and warm by the time we finished them at the end of our meal.  This \\"micro brew\\" tasted a bit like Killian's that had been sitting in a keg for a few months.  Apparently, the brewmaster had taken some time off.  (I knew we should have gone for the 2-for-1 Lafite-Rothschild.)\\n\\nFinally, time for the main course.  I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Salad, which was surprisingly good.  We also had a couple burgers at the table that were decent.\\n\\nLast was time for dessert.  I was really in the mood for ice cream but was intrigued by the fondue pot.  The waitress explained the fondue pot, but it seemed exceedingly complicated, and I was not sure I had the technical ability and dexterity to eat it.  Plus, it goes much better with a bottle of Lafite-Rothschild than a warm glass of Houli-Red.\\n\\nSo I asked about the Snickers ice cream dessert.  The waitress replied, \\"No, I don't really like it.  It's usually freezer burnt.\\"  At this point, I felt like rolling the dice, so I went for it.  That's the kind of guy I am.  Should have listened.  It was about the size of one small scoop of ice cream and tasted like freezer burnt ice cream.  Serves me right.\\n\\nSo anyway, I hate to give a 1 star to a place where I actually had a good entree.

Most of the dishes are over $20. Seriously, you can go to a really nice, sit down restaurant, with creative cuisine and get dishes in the same price range. There is nothing to warrant this tag.

When I first entered the establishment, I noticed very \\"simple\\" d√©cor: metal picnic benched tables, restroom style paper towels, plastic forks and knives and red checkerboard plastic table clothes adorned the room. After sitting awhile and as the lunch crowd came rushing in, I realized just how effective this set-up was. The benches \\"encouraged\\" the clientele to sit and socialize with others whether they knew them or not, they were also spaced and aligned in such a way as to maximize customer flow (order, dining and exiting). \\n\\nThe menu was pretty simple. If you are one of those people that like complicated and extensive menus, run away from this place as fast as you can. They serve CHICKEN here along with some limited sides; drink selection consists of water and unsweet/sweet tea, that's it. Oh!!! by the way, the tea and water are ALWAYS free.\\n\\nI ordered the Dark Meat Meal \\"Hot\\" and had some unsweet tea, Note - They do not have any artificial sweeteners available, you need to bring your own. Now the menu states that the Hot is \\"The real deal, as advertised\\". I must have missed that advertisement because the \\"Hot\\" is \\"smoken\\". It is not for the faint of taste buds, this stuff had me sweating and latterly drinking some of the \\"cool Ranch dressing\\". The chicken is fall off the bones tender and full of juicy flavor. The Mac and Cheese is some of the best I have ever had and the cole slaw is a vinegar based style which is very refreshing to eat. \\n\\nThe employees take pride in their work and the provide very good customer service. This is a Veteran friendly establishment and one of the few businesses that provide potential employees a \\"second chance\\" and has programs for current employees to regain a foothold on life. By all standards, Hot Chicken Takeover will take over the small dine in chicken restaurant scene. \\n\\nOh, much thanks to Linda (HR) for providing some company background, it was very helpful."},{"name":"Pip's Original Doughnuts & Chai","address":"4759 NE Fremont St, Ste C","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"DONUTS ARE AMAZING THE LINE IS A SIGN OF SOMETHING.

I recommend getting there right when they open so that everything on the buffet line is still fresh.

The ribs were fantastic and plentiful, in fact they were outstanding--I would go back just for the ribs.  It tasted as if they were steamed in beer, smoked, and cooked to the perfect tenderness and then topped with a great BBQ sauce.  I had onion rings as one of my sides...they were okay, Hoggy's still has the best onion rings.  I can't remember my other side so it must not have been amazing.  However, the ribs were great and there are more sides to try next time.  Service was outstanding and prices are perfect if not cheap.\\n\\nWe also had the chicken quesadilla as an appetizer, it was half off during happy hour and probably the best quesadilla I've had...it was big and good enough to be an entree rather than an appetizer.\\n\\nThe second time I went I had a ribeye...we came in about 30 minutes before the kitchen closed.  We ordered fried pickles as an appetizer.  All of our food including the appetizer came out at the same time which wasn't cool.  The servers were busy closing the restaurant even though the bar was staying open so they let our drinks run dry multiple times.  I think the food was cooked too fast this time and my ribeye was more like a new york strip than a ribeye.  I don't think I'd get the ribeye again, but the fried pickles were the chip size which were perfect...they would have only been better if they were served before our food.  The server also rang up my kids drink which was included with her meal separately then she wasn't sure she could get it fixed.  After talking to a manager we found out that kids eat free on Monday's so we were charged when we shouldn't have been.  \\n\\nI am a fan of this place and I would go back just for the ribs and quesadilla.

This place is not getting only one star because of the food, let me tell you. It has good food.

He said \\"yeah two pineapple noodles, okay it will be ready in 20 minutes.\\" I said great and 25 minutes later my boyfriend had come back home with our meals. Everything was on time, the only problem was that they had given us two curry noodles, not two pineapple noodles. So I decided to call back and I told him \\"hi I just ordered from you and I ordered two pineapple noodles and . . . \\" and that's about as far as I got. This is what cut me off on the other end, \\"NO YOU DIDN'T! You ordered two curry noodle, I know because I say two curry noodle and you said yes and you didn't order the pineapple noodle! Maybe you use me, maybe you don't like the meals and want other ones! I know what you order!\\" And I had to interrupt this screaming guy and remind him that I'm the customer and that he wants my business and yet he is talking to me that way? I was so, so shocked. I had never been treated so rudely by people working at a restaurant. I was so polite to him too. I know what it's like to work in the service industry, because I work in it right now! And customer service is so important.  I was appalled. I finally just said \\"can you please just make us two pineapple noodles please\\" and he said he would, and he asked if we could bring back the other meals upon our return, seriously, so he could inspect it to see if we had eaten it, maybe just to prove that we had in fact used him.\\n\\nGod I wanted to like this place, I was so excited.

I also bought a half moon cookie and it had the same dry yellow cake as well as a package of butter rolls which use to be really good but those were also different and not as good as before.

Seeing the empty tables and hearing the hostesses say that they wanted to wait to seat their customers to give the cooks a break. HELLO?! You're going to leave your GUESTS seated OUTSIDE and make them wait, without asking them if they wanted something to drink?

It was a nice, faint reminder of what you'd get in NOLA, but that's it. A nice reminder. And at $4 for 8 beignets, underwhelming. The marmalade was just TOO sweet too. It definitely overpowered the beignets.\\n- Biscuits and gravy. I've become somewhat of a biscuit and gravy connoisseur. I appreciate that their biscuits are home-made, which is nice. However, the gravy was just thick and bland, not the sausage-embedded gravy that should accompany a biscuit. This probably ranks outside the top three that I've ever had.\\n- Homemade sausage. This was probably one of the redeeming things about this place. I really liked their homemade sausage! It was moist and had the faintest kick, but was a little sweet too. Confused?

I asked how much it cost, the desk clerk told me around $4 a day. that was fine, so we checked in. I asked for a top floor river view, they said it would cost a little extra. I asked how much the rate was, the clerk said $119 plus $45 for the top floor & $55 more for a river view. Are you kidding this is Ausitn not London! We settled on a parking lot view @ $119, they put us 4 floors down from the top floor. When we got to the room i tried to take a shower, but they had no hot water. I called the front desk & told them, they said they would send someone to fix it right away. An hour later the guy arrived, he told me the water runs from the top of the building down, so the top floors get the hot water then the rest of the rooms get what's left. I waited 30 mins. the water was room temp so i took a quick shower. We went out to a few bars, when we got back i couldn't find my roon card. We waited at the front desk for over 15 mins. till a clerk wondered from the hotel restaurant area to give me a key card.

The chicken was cooked perfectly and the breading was light (a tad greasy) and flavorful.  The warm level spice was probably closer to hot than warm, but it was delicious.

This was everything but. It really comes down to service. If you have an un-attentive waiter and a manager who also is not customer service oriented, it can mean the difference between a terrific dinner or a disappointing and frustrating one. Unfortunately we experienced the latter. To make a long story short, we told Matt our waiter that it was our first evening in Austin and our first time to Lamberts,  We ended up asking two gentlemen sitting next to us what they found to be their favorites on the menu since we did not receive any explanations or input on the menu from Matt, who was busy waiting on and serving a large table seated next to us. Only after placing our order, two new guests were then seated where the gentleman had been next to us. Their waiter explained the cocktail menu, suggested appetizers and then the dinner menu. He placed the condiments at their table and explained what was in each bottle and recommended their use. None of which was ever shared with us. Any of this information would have been very helpful in making our drink and entree selections. \\nI sat with my dinner plate in front of me for over 15 minutes after finishing what I could eat before anyone asked if they could remove my plate. After paying our almost $100 dinner bill we made an effort to explain to a manager our disappointment with how our dinner went. All he did was say that he was sorry and asked what he could do to make us happier. At this point, it was more frustrating to have to suggest to the manager what he could do. I would have liked if he had offered a reduction on our bill or offered to make a dessert or an after dinner drink to enjoy. Instead he just expected us to come up with something after already being frustrated beyond our limits. Out of many meals out during the 5 days here in Austin this was by far the only unpleasant and disappointing. It was also the priciest of all of our delicious meals and experiences here in Austin. BOOOOOOOOOO\\nUPDATE:\\nIt looks as if our bill was adjusted to make up for the not so pleasant evening we experienced on Wednesday August 10 and the disappointment that we experienced.

When my Mom order we a glass of wine (which we had to ask for twice) it came in a water glass after we had to remind our waitress of our drink orders. After taking away our meal nobody came back so we actually had to walk up to bar to get our bill and then nobody came to get it. Finally somebody came  to take it. The food tasted good but given the overall experience I will not be going back.

I will definitely start going there more often!  I think they get busy later in the night- so if you can make it an earlyish dinner you're sure to get right in.\\nUPDATE: Went back two more times since then and loved it just as much each time.

Fabulous atmosphere, great service and food that makes you want to come back the next day.  Superica covered all the bases tonight.  This is our second trip into this establishment and I have to give them a perfect 10 in all areas this round.  First, the restaurant is very trendy plus it fits well with the local vibe. Next, Sam and Jason have put together an amazing service team.  They not only took care of my family and our specific needs but I was watching to see how service was for other tables.  The place seems to have made a 180 change since the last time we were here when it comes to service.  I did not see a single table having issues.  The service team was well trained and supportive of their team members.  Perfect coverage on the floor for the number of guest.  Last, the food was amazing.  The guacamole is just standard but fresh.  The queso was different in a good way.  We really enjoyed the flavor and the texture was perfect.  Now, what makes this restaurant standout.  The fajitas are some of the best in town, if not the southeast.  First, you can tell they start with the freshest meats and ingredients.  We tried all three: chicken, steak and carnitas.

To give highlights of each dish: the lox and bagel had a fantastic spread that had a great kick, the cornbread was interesting but a pass, the chicken sandwich was very yummy with a Thai style backing similar to a banh mi, the egg in the hole dish (forgot the name) was the stalwart for me in both presentation and taste as it combined miso banana bread with egg.  Throw in a super tasty coffee martini and an interesting though super sour grapefruit drink and brunch was a success.

I was lucky, I go the last rabbit of the day.\\n\\nI had been looking forward to this sandwich since I saw it on tv.  Fresh rabbit grilled up right in front of you, topped with kemchi, a bbq soy kind of sauce, and tater tots.  I was so in love with the first bite!  The rabbit was not gamey and the sauce made it smoky.  It was a really good combination with the kemchi.  \\n\\nThe texture of the sandwich was great.  The bread is cooked a little on the griddle so it softens up the french loaf a bit, but it wasn't too greasy either.  The sandwich is served with a side of crisps and a pickle.  For $12, it felt like it was going to be too pricey, but where else can I get rabbit on south lamar?  \\n\\nGreat food, from another great trailer.  Atmosphere is cool if you like south austin.  it's right next to the Gibson bar, and across the street from Alamo Drafthouse and High Ball.

The brisket was moist and had a nice flavor to it. The pork ribs were a little slim, but I enjoyed the coriander seasoning and that made it different than most BBQ places. Also, the pork was not stringy and was great with sauce poured all over it. \\n\\nThe Fried green tomatoes arrived topped with lump crab meat and were really good. \\n\\nThe deviled eggs were decent, and you will need two orders if you have a group of 6.\\n\\nThe roasted green chili queso is addictive. You will want to pour it on your entree, yes even on your french toast.\\n\\nI had the hanger steak Benedict thinking it would be steak cut to fit over the English muffins. In actuality, Lambert's drapes an entire hanger steak over the muffins and let's you have at it. I struggled a little but eventually ate it all. \\n\\nThe one dish I would hesitate on were the boar ribs.

There was a slight drip coming from a pipe above us. Didn't drip on us really and we just pointed it out because we weren't in the mood for pipe explosion action. He took care of it and brought us a shot of something yummy. Felt very much taken care of and that's what I like. \\n\\nAlso, i like that the screens don't take over the space.

Initially, service was fine. Larger party which typically drives down my expectation from a service perspective. Party of 9 and they actually had two servers assigned to the table.

There were a couple of mistakes with side orders, however, one person ordered a steak medium--arrived well done. It was sent back but arrived again well done. Very disappointing that one person was left to eat alone as everyone else was finished. They apologized and took this along with the apps off the bill. Service could have been better-second round of drinks had to be ordered a second time because the server forgot and of course, garnish was left off again.

I do like the batter for the fried chicken though. Maybe a bit more salt or marinate those chicken a bit longer? \\n\\nAMBIENCE 3.5/5\\nThere was really none. The interior of the store kind of dull/gloomy. The place would definitely liven up with more brighter colors. I don't hate it, it just alright but maybe I am expecting a bit too much? Maybe it was suffice for a place like Hello Chicken but I definitely feel there is room for improvement. \\n\\nSERVICE 4/5\\nBoth the staffs were polite. I almost wanted to give a 5 stars until at the end of the meal, we asked for two small boxes for the remaining chicken pieces  but was given one medium one. I didn't see how one should mix the original fried chicken with no coating with other pieces which had sauces on them. Moreover, was my hot tea not refillable? :( \\n\\nI would definitely come back for the Soy Garlic Fried Chicken and perhaps try their Hello Bowl. \\n\\nWill come back and give this place another update after I try the Hello Bowl.

First off, there were no suites at all available because the hotel was under renovation, which was annoying, but would have been nice if they had at least warned me when I booked instead of telling me they'd see what they could do. \\n\\nThe elevators are a mess, with three banks that all go to overlapping floors. Seriously? Do you really need to continuously confuse your guests? I guess the answer is yes!\\n\\nThe phone in our room didn't work. Awesome. I had some girlfriends over for the beginning of a bachelorette party, so I didn't want them fixing the phone while we were all in there. The concierge sent up electricians anyway, despite my requests not to have them sent up. Thanks for listening. \\n\\nThere was no ice machine on our floor (really? on an elite floor, no ice machine?) and when I called down to room service for an extra ice bucket (from the hallway phone no less), I got passed back and forth between housekeeping and room service for a good ten minutes before I was told they would only bring me an empty ice bucket (thanks) and I could not have a knife or any other sharp object but I could go to the restaurant on the first floor for a plastic knife. Have you ever tried to cut a lime with a plastic knife? Don't bother unless you really want some lime-ade.\\n\\nRoom service was quick and decent, although beware the hot wings! they are amazingly spicy. The jumbo shrimp cocktail is awesome though. One star extra just for that, no joke. It almost compensates for the fact that the concierge lounge for elite guests is closed on Saturdays!

Instead of using slow-cooked pulled pork, they use glazed pork belly.  It's salty, sweet, crispy, and fatty.   They roll them into thick tortillas and give you three when two would be plenty.  I've also sampled the fried shrimp tacos, which are reminiscent of Pure Taqueria's though slightly better.  The chicken mole enchiladas are incredible.

We were lucky enough to find two empty seats at the bar on a Friday night. The restaurant was packed with families enjoying the evening. The vibe was fun and lively. Our bartender was super nice and welcoming. We asked her and some other bar goers what they recommended. We had a chocolate old fashioned and some sort of vanilla and chocolate martini, which tasted good at first sip but I can't say I enjoyed it for much longer than that. We also ordered a cookie/brownie sundae, which was highly recommended by the bartender over the bread pudding so we took her word for it... So disappointing when the cookies and brownies came out cold. You would think the brownies and cookies would be warm but they were frigid. They also didn't taste fresh.

Unfortunately, we were pressed for time during our visit and limited ourselves to early lunch on a Sunday morning. This was one of the few open, and when we saw that it had decent reviews, we decided to check it out. \\n\\nI'm definitely glad we did! When you think of ethnic food truck cuisine, the last word you'd associate with it would be 'authentic'. But Masala proved me wrong. \\n\\nMasala has authentic and delicious Indian cuisine, and service with a personal touch. For a food truck on Rainey Street (super, duper busy no matter what day or time), you'd think they'd be more worried about efficiency. But the chef (he was completely by himself) took his time. That isn't to say that it took a long time, it just means that he takes the time to make it to perfection, and even brings it out to you. \\n\\nI ordered the Chicken Curry with Garlic Naan Bread. Simply delicious. The red curry has a bit of a kick to it. There didn't seem to be an option to ask for a milder curry sauce, but then again, I didn't ask. The rice was freshly steamed and flavorful. THE BREAD - the bread was awesome. Loved the garlic addition. I absolutely recommend that above all else, but it blended really nicely with the red curry and basmati rice. It was a meal that provided a nice blend of flavors. \\n\\nThe location isn't ideal for a mid-day bite to each. It sits under the shade of trees, which would normally be wonderful, save for the fact that a ton of birds thought it was a wonderful spot to chill as well. I was crazy paranoid about being pooped on, or worse - having my food pooped on. I'm happy to say that didn't happen, but it was still nerve wracking. \\n\\nBut the food speaks for itself, and boy does it speak loudly. I love Indian food, and I loved the fact that I was able to get some from a simple food truck instead of having to go to a sit-down restaurant.

I don't know why people wouldn't want to do the habanero. \\nDirty Wu: Nutella was squiggled over this. Sea salt brought out the sweetness.\\nCandied bacon and maple: Another sweet and salty one. Bacon was caramelized in tiny soft chunks (more like pork belly jam than bacon in terms of consistency). So good =).\\nRaw honey and sea salt: Nice honey but I wasn't sure if I liked it\\nNutella and sea salt: Same thing as the dirty wu but more boring (dollop of nutella in the middle)\\nCinnamon sugar: Probably the most unremarkable of them all\\n\\nEach donut was small and perfectly fried with a crunchy exterior.

I've been there on several occasions, and have been impressed each time.  I have to admit, I have my favorites and don't often stray.  I've also never been there for Sunday brunch and so will base this review on dinner only. \\n\\nThere are two sections to Luke's menu.  His regular menu and the specials. His regulars are top notch. I recommend \\"The Rabbit\\" and the \\"Tuna Fingers.\\"  The Rabbit is a messy sandwich with a delicious sauce and some slaw underneath. It comes with some basic chips, but the sandwich alone should fill you up.  The Tuna Fingers are delicious and come covered in an Asian sauce with a little zing. His specials are always interesting, but are hit or miss. Luke comes up with some creative stuff.  Some of it is awesome and some of it is good.  I'll tell you what, though, Luke always loves the feedback.  It isn't uncommon for Luke to wander up during your meal - or to deliver your food - and ask you how your evening is going.  He loves feedback. \\n\\nFor some fun, ask him about his experience on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives! \\n\\nAs I've said previously, I've never been there for Sunday brunch, but I've heard mixed reviews. \\n\\nI highly recommend grabbing a sandwich at Luke's grabbing a drink at Gibson's, and settling in for a nice evening meal.  Maybe I'll see you there?"},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Let me preface by saying I do not like custardy/creamy desserts nor do I like desserts that have a crunchy type pastry.\\n\\nWith that being said, I knew that Mike's Pastry would not blow me away but it could very well be a 4 or 5 star to those who LOVE cannoli's or these types of desserts.\\n\\nTRANSPORTATION: It's located in North End so kind of far from the T again, but pretty walkable if you're near Quincy Market or Beacon Hill.  You'll see the large MIKE'S PASTRY sign in yellow and a long line.\\n\\nWAIT: The line looks long but it goes by quickly.  Once you get inside the store there are multiple lines that lead to different people who can help you so don't get stuck thinking it's one big line.  They want you to move to the left and get in a shorter line.\\n\\nATMOSPHERE: It's a basic busy bakery with their goods displayed and then a few tables to sit at.  Surprisingly there were plenty of tables even though there were tons of people.  I think a lot of people get it to go or don't want to bother fighting for a seat.   They have giant spools of string coming from the ceiling to help tie up the boxes.\\n\\nFOOD: Everyone says the best one is the chocolate chip cannoli so we got that one and the chocolate ricotta because I heard the ricotta ones taste better.  \\n\\nCHOCOLATE CHIP CANNOLI - This one was pretty good because their chocolate chips are legit chocolate, seemed like semi-sweet to me so they added a perfect taste to the cannoli.  The inside is cream and the pastry part reminded me of a fried wonton where it was crispy and flaky and easily breaks when you bite into it.  They are pretty big and definitely enough for one person.  For someone like me who doesn't like creamy stuff it was a little too much towards the end.\\n\\nCHOCOLATE RICOTTA - the only difference was that the cream was brown, indicating chocolate but the texture was pretty much the same as the chocolate chip cannoli.  It wasn't maybe a TAD less sweet but nothing majorly different.\\n\\nAlso, check what they have at the counter because they had different flavors than the ones that were pictured.  Know what you want when you get to the front because they want to get your order quickly.  I am not positive if it is cash only but I remember paying cash and feeling like if I paid card it would take too long.\\n\\nOverall, everyone who comes to Boston tries this so why not?"},{"name":"Fusion Bistro","address":"180 Everett Ave","city":"Chelsea","stars":"4","text":"Bland and wholly unimpressive.

I actually had only planned on having a quick drink with my date when she and I walked in, but the bartender never returned my credit card even though I asked him to close out my tab when I placed my first drink order. After the bartender left with my card and it was clear he wasn't coming back I figured \\"no big deal, hey mind as well stick around and give this place a shot\\", and then proceeded to be made to feel unwelcome for the rest of the 30-45 minutes I was there, for two reasons:\\n\\n1) Little Donkey has a waiting list for the seats at the bar. What that means is, if seats at the bar have been empty for 5-10 minutes, and you walk up to them and try to sit down, a bartender will then come over to you and grill you about whether your name is on the list. Very unpleasant and unwelcoming. I don't know of any other bar in Central Square that has this policy. Side note: I actually was on the list, and right after the first bartender tried to tell my date and I to back off from the seats (we hadn't even sat down in them yet)  another bartender who had taken down my name previously, walked over and invited us to have a seat.\\n\\n2) I was cut off for the first time in my life here, by a bartender I had not spoken to the entire night. He claimed I had stumbled when I left my seat, not sure where that was coming from, I do know that when I was just trying to get back to my seat after having used the restroom, I had to weave my way through 5-6 bros who had formed a tightly encircled perimeter around my seat at the bar (you know the scenario). No spilled drinks, no complaints from any other patrons, hadn't even spoken to this bartender beyond a simple drink order. \\nAnd even if the bartender had been justified he was incredibly rude about it. He could have said something like \\"hey sorry to do this I'm just trying to be on the safe side\\" but all he said when my date ordered two drinks for us was \\"he has had enough and I can't serve him anymore\\" Then silence. No offer to bring us water or suggestion to order food or coffee or anything like that. Again this is after I had not spoken with this bartender at all previously and had been patient with the other bartenders  (didn't even bring up any of the initial mistakes I mentioned above). And I hadn't even  talked to anyone in the bar other than my date who I was there with - so there is no way I was making anyone around me uncomfortable in any way.  Our water glasses were also empty for a long time, right before all this - if this bartender was so busy watching me trying to build a case for why I was too intoxicated, I don't understand why he didn't fill up my water glass once? My date and I honestly thought the bartender was joking. Very strange. \\n\\nThis place is very expensive, and I'm sure the chefs put a lot of work into making good food, but Little Donkey needs a lot of work in terms of how bartenders treat customers when they walk in the door."},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"Oasis reminds me of a Fudpucker or something similar on the Panana City or Destin beach which I found odd.

I did a lot of research on this site and Yelp, and finally decided on China Pearl. It ended up being an excellent choice.\\n\\nIn terms of dim sum, people tend to comment on certain aspects, so I'll write my review using these as a guide:\\n\\nSeating/Waitress Attention: We walked in and saw that it was moderately crowded. As soon as we walked up, we were warmly greeted by the hostess, and then escorted to our seats. Tea and menus were brought to us immediately. I'd say the time from our arrival at the restaurant to being ensconced in our seat was 90 seconds.\\n\\nFood cart number and variety: The first cart came about 1-2 minutes after we sat down. From that point on, they came at a steady clip. There was only one time when there was a lull where I had to wave a cart down. There was a great variety of dim sums, and we only started seeing repeats at the very end of our meal.\\n\\nFood cart lady language/disposition: They were nice, not pushy at all. Yea, their English wasn't the greatest, but we did OK. I hate seafood, and we successfully avoided getting anything fishy.\\n\\nQuality of the food: With the exception of the meatballs (big yuk), everything else was really good. It was fun noshing on little dishes of things that were new to us, yet had a good Chinese food flavor.\\n\\nCleanliness of restaurant: Very clean. Bathrooms were well kept up with plenty of soap and water (this was a complaint of a lot of people in Yelp reviews).\\n\\nCost: It came to $18/pp. Not cheap, but worth the quality of the food and the experience.\\n\\nFor those visiting Boston, I highly recommend doing dim sum one early afternoon of your stay. Walk through the streets of Chinatown, past the mouthwatering bakeries, stores selling beautiful Chinese lanterns, and boisterous groups playing chess on stone tables.

Great move, Superica!\\n\\nUpdate:\\n\\nWe have dined in the restaurant and ordered through Postmates recently. The food has been perfect each time. I still believe that the 20% added to Postmates orders is the hyperbole of to-go tip add-ons, but I'm glad to see the food standards that we were accustomed to returning. \\n\\nOriginal review: \\n\\nI had Postmates pick up my to go order and the restaurant added a huge surcharge! Why is the restaurant charging me more money because I sent someone else to pick up the food? They don't charge the huge surcharge to people who pick up the food themselves! Why does the restaurant think it ok to charge such a surcharge when their employees aren't doing any extra work? Why does Superica need more money because Postmates picked up the food instead of me? This unethical money-grabbing in my opinion. \\n\\nThis is one of my favorite restaurants. They used to have 5 stars. However, their standards have slowly fallen each week. From rude employees to inconsistent food, this restaurant needs some attention from the owner. We eat here once or twice a week and tonight we had the worst experiences so far. We got our order to go tonight. The enchiladas were plated cold (how does that even happen?). The mole and cheese enchiladas have cheese on top. Every single time I've ever ordered these, except for tonight, the cheese is melted gooey. Tonight the cheese hadn't melted at all. I thought that was odd until I bit into the enchilada. Stone cold. Seriously? How does that happen? Were these in a refrigerator or something? \\n\\nWe ordered 4 entrees. We got one thing of rice and beans for 4 entrees. We also got one bag of chips. One bag? Really? \\n\\nOn top of all of that, I am truly tired of the staff's bad attitude. They treat customers like they're in the way or a hindrance to whatever they'd rather be doing instead. We walked in the restaurant tonight and the hostess didn't even greet us. She just starred off into space... \\n\\nWas there no manager on duty tonight? \\n\\nI love Superica.

Donuts made from bean paste, immersed in a fragrant red spicy sauce, almost more like a soup, with potatoes, carrots, and celery. This is an appetizer.\\n- the CHICKEN BHARTHA (baingan bhartha with chicken) -- chicken and eggplant in a sweeter, more vinegary sauce, but still with the rich, fragrant masala spices.\\n\\nI can see what folks mean about all the sauces tasting the same -- chicken curry, chicken tikka masala, and chicken mushroom did seem to share a very similar base. However, the ones above are different. The basics (including the tikka masala and vindaloo dishes) are solid here, but you'll be happier if you branch out a bit and try the things highlighted above, plus the masala dosa.\\n\\nI also tried the dal punjabi (figuring this would be an authentic Punjabi dish) and had a hard time telling it apart from the dal makhani I've had at other Indian places. It was fine, but nothing special; I'd skip it unless this is your favorite dish.\\n\\nOne thing I tried that I wasn't thrilled with was the chatt. It wasn't bad, just probably a matter of taste. I got the paneer chatt so it was potatoes and cheese cubes submerged in yogurt sauce with tomatoes, chives, diced peppers, spices, and red onions, served cold. An odd combo, to me, so it's hard to say if this was good or bad execution of it. The ingredients tasted fresh, anyway.\\n\\nI love how when I get take-out, they somehow get it hot enough that it is *still* almost too hot to eat, by the time I walk to Union Square, take the bus, and walk to my house, arriving home nearly 45 minutes later. Is this legal?\\n\\nThe upstairs seating area is worth checking out. Sit downstairs for pumping Hindi pop and views of kitchen hijinks; upstairs for a quieter experience with birds' eye views of the street below. There's even a highchair.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the bathroom is kiiiiiind of just a step up from what you would find in India. At least it has soap, hot water, and a flush toilet. It seems clean but is hard to tell because it's so dilapidated (stained grout etc.)\\n\\nAnother small complaint: there is NOWHERE to stand while you wait for your order, without being in the way of the people standing in line, the people coming back from the bathroom, or the people trying to get a drink out of the cooler -- and if you do manage to find a spot, it's likely that you're whopping a fellow diner in the head with your shoulder bag, since to get out of the way you need to stand among the tables. Small matter, though, since service is quick and in warm weather you can wait outside.\\n\\nThe staff are very nice. Yes, they work in a compact area, and there is a lot going on, so it's hard to keep things immaculate, but I wouldn't say that it's dirty -- just messy, which is different (lots of pots and pans everywhere, as they try to make roughly 2 dozen dishes at one time).

Nothing worse than 5 day old raw fish being placed in front of you crawling with unseen bacteria ready to leap into your intestinal system.\\n\\nMy partner had been talking about Sushi Garden for almost a year and I finally made the pilgrimage to Burnaby, which to me is somewhat like traveling to another country. I feel like a gawking tourist as I drive down, being a through and through Vancouver city girl, even worse, originally from West Vancouver, which is night and day to Burnaby. OK, so you get the point, it's rather fascinating to me, everything is in mammoth proportions compared to the city, have you seen the Walmart?\\n\\nBack to fish. I made it out and the line was out the door. I don't want to complain because the more people the less chance of dying. \\n\\nContrary to other reviewers, though I caveat that based on person, day and time service can vary, ours was very fast and efficient. I blinked and our sushi arrived. \\n\\n-Alaska roll, perfect, large amount of avocado surrounded by a light wrapping of salmon. No complaints, would have again and again, maybe even today (yes, still in Burnaby!)\\n\\n-Partner is a fan of spicy tuna, me not too much but if you are, he says its terrific. Massive portion of sweet spicy chunks of tuna, enough for a meal in itself if you aren't a small voracious Asian female.\\n\\n-Prawn tempura, which I judge with a hairy eyeball, was surprisingly one of the best I have had in the 100s of sushi restaurants i have been too. Light crisp coating, not the heavy drudgy stuff, bite into a crisp prawn. I went to a tempura restaurant once in Tokyo (and all they serve is tempura everything and you smell like a deep fryer when you leave) and this was comparable. I must tell you my stomach was in revolt by the end of that night in Tokyo, one can only ingest so much oil. Needless to say, this tempura meets some high standards.\\n\\n-Sashimi, i lie my sashimi true Japanese style which means thin delicate slices unlike Western chunks carved out of the side of a fish. I will grade this on Western standards, it was awesome, huge chunks of fish (hurl), fresh and cold. Y'all will love it, me I had to slice one piece into 5 pieces to eat it.\\n\\nThis is not a place for ambiance, it is a sushi restaurant on Lougheed. However, it is tastefully done, comfortable seating and large enough tables. High ceilings so it feels much larger than it is. A bit like Grand Central station in the busy hours as you need to walk all the way in past all the tables to get a host, and then at the end of the meal you need to do same to pay, walk all the way to the end and stand in a line to pay that is, versus table service.\\n\\nIf Sushi Garden is reading this, I do think they need more than one cashier and table service would, I think, make it much quicker. Also, they need a dedicated person to manage their take out, half the time the waitresses are so busy packing take out they forget about the patrons standing front and center. This is not from my personal experience but from sitting and watching the annoyance on people's faces.\\n\\nParking. DO NOT park in the Staples parking lots, don't doubt, you WILL be towed, they're like the frickn tow Nazis out there.

All of the dining areas are great, but JS would have liked to have checked out the bright front room instead of being squished into the high traffic bar area.  The Migas was very tasty, but JS is a sucker for corn tortillas.  The very nice and laid back waitress' suggestion to add avocado was tasty, but she didn't mention that it was an extra that incurred a cost.  Usually noting such things is a standard of service a place packed with out-of-towners should observe.

Bad mistake! When we arrived at the restaurant, we were brought to a table and told our server would be coming in few minutes. More than 15 minutes later, our server finally came to our table. 15 minutes of no service and no water at a supposedly fine-dining restaurant? We were starving so we didn't want to risk waiting for another 15 minutes before we could order. I ordered the seafood linguine, and my partner ordered the 7 oz sirloin steak done medium well. Again, it took forever for our dishes to arrive. My seafood linguine actually didn't look too bad. It had generous amount of seafood in the dish. However, it is very bland. The only flavour from the dish I could really taste was the fresh cracked pepper. The white wine cream sauce lacked seasoning. I felt like I was eating a pasta dish cooked in plain cream with no seasoning whatsoever. My partner's steak was even worse. He asked for medium well, and from the look of it, we could already tell it's way over cooked. I mean, it's supposed to be 7 oz, but it was cooked to death that it looked more like 4 oz steak. There's not even a slight hint of pink in the steak. It was very dry and rubbery. The server offered to take the steak back and bring him a new one. It's another 30 minutes of waiting for his 2nd steak. Well, guess what? Even the 2nd steak wasn't made medium well either. It was better than the first one, at least it's not way beyond well done. It was still dry and rubbery though. Our server was very rude when my partner informed her about the over-cooked steak (again). She told us she couldn't tell as it's too dark in the dinning room. She said she'd come back to take a closer look at the steak in few minutes which she never did. Overall, our experience at Prestons was just very very bad.

Eventually, my family of four was seated at an eight person table in a cavernous event hall! It was like huddling in a dark corner of an unused warehouse. There was poor lighting and we couldn't face each other. We asked to be seated at a four person table, and they moved us to a high bar table...with impossibly low chairs.

There was still plenty of food items on the buffet. I had two lobsters, one was medium and the second was quite large. My son ate two as well. Our lobsters all appeared to have just been steamed as they were very juicy. They did have the claws on them. My son loved his and might have eaten more but I said he could only have two. The other items I ate were the Mahi Mahi, which was decent but by the time I arrived had set out in the warming tray to long. A lot of the cold shrimp which were great. The snow crab legs, there were claws at first but later just leg sections. The snow crab were quite good as well. The pasta with white sauce and scallops was pretty good too if you want something other than the lobster. The fried shrimp was decent as well if you like fried seafood they had all of those items, but I didn't want to fill up on that. Surprisingly they also had sausage in tomato sauce with peppers and onions which was also pretty good. Plenty of raw clams, oysters etc. Good smoked salmon both cold and hot. Seafood salad was good as was a crab and cheese bake. They had other items like rolls prime rib, mashed potatoes, and soup but I decided to focus on the lobster and crab and try some other items. Overall a great value if you like seafood and in particular lobsters and or crab. Not going to be somewhere to go if you are not hungry. I also liked most all the deserts, they are smaller but at that point that is all you will be able to eat.

The first time, for lunch, my co-workers and I had called ahead to place our order, just in case they were busy, and when we arrived, there was already a table on the enclosed patio waiting for us, complete with filled water glasses. When I called to place my breakfast delivery order for my second time, the woman who took my order was so incredibly nice and patient. So many times when you call in a delivery order elsewhere, you can tell that the person is in a hurry to get you off the phone. Not this time. What a breath of fresh air.\\n\\nThe food is great. I've only eaten breakfast so far (they serve it all day, so you better believe I ordered breakfast for lunch!) and have no complaints. The Country Benny is a take on Eggs Benedict, but with a biscuit replacing the English muffin, sausage patty for the Canadian bacon and white gravy for the Hollandaise. The white gravy could use a little bit more sausage in it, which is why I'm just calling it white gravy, but the sausage patty with the Benny helped. The large pancake combo (2 pancakes) is MORE THAN ENOUGH to fill you up since the pancakes are such a good size and super fluffy. I upgraded my pancakes to blueberry and they were amazing. The bacon is the right combo of crispy and chewy and the sausage links have that satisfying snap with just a little bit of char to add more flavor.\\n\\nI haven't had any of their lunch offerings yet, but one of my co-workers ordered the grilled cheese and it was ON POINT.

When we walked in I notice something, under the canopy there were heaters and since tonight was a tad chilly I figured it was a nice touch, comfortable enough that you won't freeze waiting for the valet. \\nIn the front there was a fountain with blue lights on the background wall, looked nice enough that my wife got a picture and we took a selfie too and I'm not the selfie type of guy so you know whose idea it was. \\nWhen you enter you've got a descent size entrance waiting area with wine bottles displayed, I thought it looked sophisticated, towards the right of the hostess was a separate lounge/bar area where a live band was playing which could be heard through out the restaurant. I remember because I told Yuki that the song playing would be a great theme music to walk to while I pretended it was my theme music and walked to the beat while pointing randomly and winking. \\nAnyway we were promptly seated and we were seated near the window middle isle. Strangely we didn't get any bread till after we were almost done with our meal, well I was already done Yuki was still working on hers. So I frowned and said that's a little late, weird as it was it seemed like they ran out of bread because all the tables were given bread after us. I naturally still ate the bread, it gave me something to do while I waited on Yuki.  I really liked the flat bread they offered, I wouldn't say it was as good as Canoe but it made the cut. \\nWe didn't order appetizers but we did go for the red Sangria and it was good but surprisingly sweeter then I expected. Yuki ordered her favorite meal every time it's on any menu, Jumbo Lump Crab Cake. I steered away from my common pick (seafood) and went for the lightest meat option: Steak Frites. Though I was also eyeing the lobster but couldn't bring myself to order it thinking it would be tiny because I definitely wasn't going to pay for two tails. \\nBoth our meals were great (yes I ate some of Yuki's food) too, hey I can't say no when she's feeding me.

Our room is in the back building, not the main one.  There are 2 elevators, one is out of service.   When we arrived, there was a dirty room service tray outside our door.   Several hours later it was still there.  We called and they said they only have one person who picks them up.  (I wondered if rodents would find the tray first)\\n\\nThey advertise wifi, but no signal in our room.  I called the front desk and they asked if I was using an iPhone or iPad, I answered yes.   They then tried to explain that iPhones and iPads have very tiny antennas so they won't be able to pick up the wifi signal in some places.   Huh?   Apple is the problem, not the hotel?\\n\\nThe room is clean, but dated.  Old tv, not HD.  Bathroom small but functional.

We also noticed that on sunny days, the fish meat would be sitting in the sun for who knows how long, which may have an affect on the quality of the fish meat. The guy that rolls the sushi did awesome on presentation and the little details he puts into his dishes is really nice, which shows he enjoys doing what he does.\\n\\nWe also ordered Pad Thai!

Stock (2. floor) eines Geb√§udes in der Burrard Street, einer der Hauptstrassen in Downtown. Die K√ºche ist eine Mischung aus japanisch und koreanisch. Ich war gespannt.\\nWir hatten einen Tisch f√ºr 3 Personen bestellt und erreichten das Restaurant mit ein paar Minuten Versp√§tung. Im Vorraum des Restaurants warteten schon mehrere Personen auf B√§nken, dass sie zu ihren Tischen geleitet werden. Wir gingen zu dem Empfangstisch und ein netter Herr erkl√§rte uns, dass es noch einen Moment dauert. Wir warteten also ein paar Minuten und wurden dann an einen Vierertisch gebracht. Der Gro√üteil des Restaurants bestandt aus Pl√§tzen mit B√§nken bzw. St√ºhlen an Tischen mit integrierten Gasgrills. Ausserdem gab es eine Sushibar mit Sitzgelegenheiten und ein gro√üe Ecke mit mehreren traditonellen japanischen Tischen, wo man zum Essen auf dem Boden sitzt. Die Inneneinrichtung war ein Mix aus typisch japanischen/koreanischen Holz-\\nWandverkleidungen, ein paar Pflanzen und gr√ºnen, roten, gelben, was wei√ü ich f√ºr Neon-R√∂hren unter den Decken. Ich muss gestehen, dass Restaurant erweckte bei mir nicht unbedingt den Eindruck, dass es sich hier um ein gutes Restaurant handeln soll. Aber egal, der Laden ist voll und das muss ja einen Grund haben. Wir wurden an einen Vierertisch mit Grill platziert. Die Kellnerin brachte uns gleich die Karten, auf denen man praktischerweise gleich ankreuzen konnte was und wie viel man haben m√∂chte. Bei einigen Gerichten lie√üen wir uns beraten und wir bekammen gute Ausk√ºnfte. Also bestellten wir erstmal: verschieden Suhi, Meeresfr√ºchte, Tintenfisch, Scweinefleisch, Rinderfilet, √ºberbackene Muscheln Kurze Zeit sp√§ter kam der erste Teil des Essens, der Grill wurde angemacht und los gings. Das Rindfleisch war Hauchd√ºnn geschnitten und leicht mariniert, schnell auf den Grill damit. Ein bi√üchen Sushi probieren, einiges hat mir geschmeckt anderes nicht, bin nicht so der Sushi-Fan Mit K√§se √ºberbackene Austern, lecker. Das Schweinefleisch war in Ordnung. Das Rindfleisch oh, my god! Verdammt hat das gut geschmeckt!! Extrem Zart, extrem lecker. In der Zwischenzeit wurde der Tisch immer voller. Ein Teller kam weg, daf√ºr standen kurze Zeit sp√§ter 2 neue da. Irgendwann war unser Tisch so voll, dass man nicht mal mehr die Tischplatte sah. Was hatten wir blo√ü alles bestellt? Insgesamt betrachtet war das Essen ganz gut. Einiges war nicht so mein Ding (roher Tintenfisch) anderes war schlicht und einfach umwerfend (das Rindfleisch).

The steak was small and not very hot.  I am guessing a 6oz ribeye. The 5 shrimp were butterflied and deep fried and the star of the meal. The house salad was good, not your typical side salad as it had a couple black olives and a small pepper in it along with a scallion on top.  The bread is served with a scoop of butter sitting in honey. I was told the bread is not bad but not great either.  I ordered the seasonal vegetables and honestly I wish restaurants would put some thought into their veggies, hard steamed carrots, cauliflower and broccoli.  They weren't very hot and lacked flavor. A little seasoning would have been great.  Had to drown them in butter, salt and pepper to eat them, but since they were lukewarm, the cold butter wouldn't melt.

We get the mild, but it's really not mild at all.\\n2. Spicy Spinach Artichoke Dip - served with baked pita, this is not your average spinach and artichoke dip. The \\"spicy\\" comes from the diced tomatoes that they put on top, which have some type of spicy added to them. Love, love, love this app (sometimes, I get it for my main dish because I'm not a good sharer).\\n3. Beer list - the ever-changing tap selection is hard to beat. We love good beer, and this is the best place in the area - aside from Redbones maybe - to see and try new ones. The menus include a helpful sheet with descriptions, but the staff is also very knowledgeable. \\n4. Breakfast BLT - I am not a brunch person, but I really do love this dish. The avocado is a great addition, and I'd highly recommend ordering a spicy bloody Mary with it.\\n5. Curly fries - Many of the dishes comes with fries, and DEFINITELY get the curly fries as opposed to regular. Amazing.\\n6. Parking - Not many Mass. Ave. restaurants have their own parking place.

However, there is something about the Fort Collins BCB that the Boulder chain just doesn't have. \\n\\nPerhaps it's the fact that it's a chain. If you have every been to the original you know that it's not just about the burrito, it's also about the crowded, dirty, slightly cynical atmosphere. I went nearly every Tuesday for Phat Tuesday's (potato burrito special), so I am not able to comment on any food item besides that. I go for a regular, white tortilla, cheese and onions, corn salsa, ranch, and guacamole. Five stars hands down. \\n\\nHowever, I was disappointed upon attending the Boulder branch. It's trying to be too...normal (?). The cheese isn't sliced, and it's that fake shredded garbage (they never put enough on--they are pretty stingy about other condiments as well!). The potatoes are over cooked, and they don't nearly drowned the burrito in enough ranch.

The food was extraordinary, but it couldn't overcome the bad taste the service left in my mouth.  \\n\\nAt 8:30 this past Saturday night, the restaurant was warmly lit, bustling, and casually sophisticated as the hostess led our party of four to a table in the center of the main dining room.  At a friend's recommendation I started off with a margarita and the crispy wild boar ribs; the margarita was perfectly balanced and the ribs were something of a revelation.  \\n\\nMy only frustration at this stage: without my realizing it, the waitress (a thin brunette in her mid-20s) took my drink before I had finished.  In my experience, this is a rare occurrence; when it does happen I prefer to give the server the benefit of the doubt.  (Yes, it is easy to ask \\"are you finished with that?\\" and yes, losing the last few sips of a tasty cocktail is annoying, but life goes on, right?)  And so I ordered another drink (the \\"Sparkling Last Word,\\" a terrific and subtle spin on a Prohibition classic) and moved on.  \\n\\n(It is worth noting that mid-meal I also asked whether Lamberts had Spaten Optimator on draft--I had seen it highlighted in a recent Yelp review--the waitress said she would check on it but never followed up.)\\n\\nAt the waitress' suggestion I had the shrimp and grits.  The shrimp were large, tender, and seasoned with a nice blend of saltiness and heat; the creamy grits had tender chunks of Canadian bacon mixed in; the lemon zing of the accompanying seared chicory salad was a well-chosen complement.  (Note: don't order this entree if you have a big appetite--almost half of the plate is the chicory salad.)  I also sampled some of my girlfriend's pulled pork and loved it.  The brussels sprouts side were the best I've had in a restaurant; the macaroni and cheese was delightfully smooth and sharp.  And they give you a few barbecue sauces in nifty glass containers to help make the meal even better.  \\n\\nToward the end of our meal I noticed that my second drink had also vanished, this time long before I had finished it.  I'm happy to give the benefit of the doubt once, but this was the second time and--trust me--there was quite a lot left in my glass.  We decided to call the waiter over and--gently and amicably--give her a chance to make amends.  \\n\\nNow, the correct response in this situation seems obvious to me: \\"I am so sorry; let me get you another drink right away\\" or at least \\"I am so sorry; would you like me to make another drink?\\"  If the patron doesn't want another drink, you can take it off the bill.  These are small, easy ways to turn a one-time customer into a longtime one.  \\n\\nInstead, I got a long explanation: she disputed the amount that was left in my glass, said that she had been watching me for fifteen minutes and apparently I hadn't touched it, etc.  Yes, she half-heartedly offered to bring me another drink, but it was clear she was annoyed with me and felt she was in the right.  I wasn't there for an argument and so--politely, I hope--I declined.  \\n\\nI think what happened is fairly obvious: we were an 8:30 reservation and she wanted to get out of there by the time the restaurant closed.  (More evidence for this theory: she plunked our bill down on the table just after serving us dessert.)  It is true that we were among the last to leave, but we certainly weren't lingering, and it was Lamberts that offered us the 8:30 start--we would have been happy to begin earlier.  \\n\\nMaybe our waitress was angling to go out with some friends for a Saturday-night cocktail.  \\n\\nIf so, I hope she got to finish all of her drink."},{"name":"Lamberts Downtown Barbecue","address":"401 W 2nd St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"If you are looking for a BBQ restaurant there are many better alternatives, we arrived and was told there would be a hour wait so we went to the bar area, there was 2 bartenders on duty and we waited almost 20 minutes to get a drink.\\n\\nWe got our table and as we had appetizers at the bar we just wanted to order entrees, some good old bbq, the menu was limited in choices of traditional bbq, we said we like brisket and server proceeded to tell us how bad it was????\\n\\nI felt the servers goal was to up sell and just do that food came quickly Form a food runner and could have been better.\\n\\nGreat ambiance pity the food and service didn't match.\\n\\nI will choose somewhere else next time"},{"name":"Cafe Pamplona","address":"12 Bow St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"This is a secret hole in the wall with incredible food.

As long as you do not expect cook to perfection(it's not really a 5-star, dress up place) but it's all you can eat lobster, I don't understand why some people don't see the trade off.  The lobsters are firm even the claws that means it's really fresh.  Normally I don't spend much time on the claws but it's really delicious.\\n\\nThey have raw clams(I think it's cherrystone), oyster, and some sushi.  The clams are good.\\n\\nThe have prime rib and london broil.  They are RARE which i love love love in a buffet place.  The marinate of the london broil is really good !  However, if you don't get it the first 10mins when it comes out, it'll become medium rare because of the heat lamp, and you might need to wait for an hour or so  before they bring out the new piece of meat.\\n\\nThe cooked clams has way too much sand even though it's really sweet.. of course I have to spit it out because there is no way I could have swallow it.  I hope they will soak the clams a bit more before cooking it...\\n\\nThe also have steam/broil salmon, white fish, shrimp, soup, and crab leg. They are all alright..\\n\\nYou can also order from your waitress baked potato, hush puppies, and lobster bisque.. the lobster bisque is good you should order it.\\n\\nOur waitress is very friendly and nice.  She also show us the fastest way to break a lobster (I thought I was an expert before she showed me!  lol)  100% good service.\\n\\nIf you like buffet, you'll love it here....

It was chic, dark and cozy. However, the food left a lot to be desired. I ordered 2 things: The pork belly baos (rice buns) and the Pad Thai with Bacon and scallops. The pork belly was good, but the sauce/relish it came with was really weird. I was expecting some kind of pickled/sour flavor to balance the savoriness of the PB, but it just tasted really oily and bland. It didn't add anything to the pork belly, which was actually quite good. The Pad Thai was a big disappointment. I understand this is an Asian Fusion restaurant, so I wasn't expecting anything too conventional, but it was a huge let down. First off, in addition to bacon, there were several bits of kelbasa. There were also boat loads of julienned carrots mixed in with the rice noodles, which texture-wise, was not very becoming of a Pad Thai. Way too much crunch! The flavor was also very one-note/monotonous. Basically, aside from the use of rice noodles, there was nothing in this dish that reminded me of Pad Thai.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that I tried some of my friends' dishes, including another noodle dish with clams, and brussel sprouts with bacon. Both were extremely salty, and this is coming from a guy who likes salt. I'm not surprised to see other reviews here making similar commentary.\\n\\nIn summary, this place was a let-down food wise.

There was no visible wait tonight and several spots in the lot.  All good signs.  We asked how long for a table for 2 and were told 20-25 minutes.  This was highly inaccurate, as it took an hour to get a table.  Not even close.  It was brutal because the place smelled SOOO good that we were blasted by awesome smells each time the door opened, yet we got no food.\\n\\nTo be fair, they did come out and offer us a spot at the bar about 30 minutes into the wait.  The bar is microscopic in size and was packed.  No thanks.  We decided to wait for a legit table.\\n\\nWe were hungry when we arrived.  We were STARVING by the time we got the table.  Reading the reviews here, we decided on garlic knots and two pizzas.  We knew that was too much, but then we could try two things and have some tomorrow.  Two people only need one pizza here if you order some knots.\\n\\nWe had a theme at our dinner.  Burn victim was that theme.\\n\\nThe knots lived up to everything here, except that two of the four knots were BURNED.  Not a little charred.  Not crispy.  Flat burned.  They covered the burns with delicious garlic/cheese/oil goodness.  Not a chance I wanted any of that action, but my wife is more open to it.. She ate around the worst of it.\\n\\nThe non-burned knots, the flavor, and the INSANELY GOOD red sauce were great.  The burned ones we'll call below average.\\n\\nThen we waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Tick-tock.  Tick-tock.  *tumbleweeds*\\n\\nAhhhh... the pizzas finally arrived.  It was quite a wait.  I didn't time it, so I won't say a guess, but it was the culinary version of a pregnant pause.  We expected something to happen, but it just hung there.  Nothing.  For a bit.  Quite a bit.\\n\\nMy pizza appeared fine.  My wife's was hit with a flamethrower.  Another burn victim.  Like not a little burned.  Look at the photo.  That's a bit excessive on the burn.\\n\\nWe seriously wonder if we got the rookie cook or something.  This place gets insanely good reviews and we got MEH.  The other thing was topping distribution.  It was almost drunken in appearance.  No consistency and it wasn't even.\\n\\nI had the Crimson Ghost and my wife had the 'Roni.\\n\\nSome of my pieces had a TON of honey and were VERY sweet.  Some had none that I could taste.  One slice was perfectly balanced and the flavors were great together.  It's a darn shame the entire pie wasn't like that piece.  It's supposed to have chilies, hot soppresata, fresh mozzarella, basil, and honey.  I didn't catch any chilies and the soppresata wasn't hot or spicy.  It was very mild, even on the piece without any honey taste.  The good piece was really good.  I'm curious if either of the two pieces I brought home are like that one.  Maybe I'll be lucky?  I just was a little deflated that there was ZERO oomph/heat to this pizza.  None.  It was tasty, but fell flat because I was expecting some punch and got a vague fanning hand gesture instead.\\n\\nMy wife's 'Roni was more evenly balanced, but she still did a little topping shifting.  Hers had garlic, oregano, pecorino, pepperoni, calabrian chilies.  Her pie had a tiny bit a heat.  Mostly, though, it was overly salty.  \\n\\nThis place is hot right now, but we had to have visited on rookie night or something?? Right??

We called and found out they don't take reservations so we drove over and parked in the universal lot. After parking and walking to the restaurant we were told our wait would be an hour. We tried to wander around the store to shop but it was very busy so we sat on the front steps outside. A little over and hour later we were seated upstairs near the railing. The servers are dressed to match the steampunk decor. There is a whole made up backstory about the restaurant and their quest for chocolate. We waited quite awhile before a server came to our table to greet us and take our food orders so we were already set to order. We started with a spinach dip app & a warm chocolate bread and ordered mushroom meatloaf, a bbq chicken flatbread, an Alfredo pasta and a burger for the entrees.  Our apps were out  relatively quickly. The bread was dry and nothing special. The dip was nice but a very small amount. As we waited for our meals the main character wandered around and greeted a few tables and posed for pictures. We stopped a few servers asking if someone could check on our meals because we waited so long. When they finally arrived our server was miffed that we had asked others and told us she couldn't control the kitchen. The food is decent but sadly wasn't even warm. For the amount we paid and the time we waited you would expect it to be delicious and piping hot. We went ahead and orders desserts. The kids ordered rice krispy shakes, and I ordered marshmallow. We went downstairs to watch them making desserts through the windows. They were a huge letdown as well. I'm not sure if the kitchen being downstairs or the ridiculously long line of dessert items prepped and served played a factor but by the time they were delivered to our table they were spilling down the sides and they were runny and not that thick icy cold milkshake we all love, but rather a plastic cup of runny milky nonsense. We paid and left. I don't know if this was an off day but it wasn't worth going back and I just don't get the hype. We love chocolate, we eat out all the time, and we sure do love shakes but this place didn't deliver in food or service the way it delivers on theming and decor."},{"name":"Cambridge Common","address":"1667 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"3 bevs.\\n1 baked tilapia on salad\\n1 turkey gobbler, sweet potato fries\\n1 cup chowder\\n1 baja turkey burger, curly fries\\n1 order fried pickles\\n$42.50 + 20% = $51/3 friends = $17\\n8 items = $17pp\\n(1+7) = 8\\n\\nBuddhists follow the Noble Eightfold Path.\\nNintendo revolutionizes gaming with its 8-bit NES.\\nOxygen has the atomic number 8.\\nThe 8th card in a Tarot deck is Strength.\\nThere are 8 planets in our solar system (F Pluto.

So when my fiance and I sat down and told our waiter David (who might be the best waiter we have ever been served by) that we wanted him to choose our wines and dining options for our, he was blown away and welcomed the challenge.  We had 4 courses: 6 Oysters with a nice Mignonette,  White Anchovy and Crab meat Crostini, Almond and Pepper spread and Creamy Ricotta, and Homemade Cavatelli with a farm egg, chive, mushroom, and kale.  We even opted for a goat milk pasta with a mint lamb ragu sauce and the frozen yogurt for dessert, because you know.... when in Rome.\\nWith each course minus the two that we chose, David gave us a wine pairing to complement the course and explained to us why he chose this wine.  He was very detailed and enthusiastic about his presentation, something most servers in a setting like this lack.  Most of the wines he suggested were excellent.  In fact, my favorite wine of the evening was a Piedmont wine that came out of a box.  Yes wine-o's, a box wined was probably the best glass option in the house and it really was delicious.  Suck it.\\n\\nSpoke is going to be a place where we will bring relatives and friends for a nice, chill night to chat over a good glass of box wine and enjoy great food.  The portions are small, yes.  But the quality of the food and especially the quality of the service certainly makes up for the price.

The line moves pretty quickly though, so no problem there. They have 18 varieties of cannolis. If you arent sure of which ones to get, as was the case for my friend and me, get them all. Seriously. The price can be hefty - it was $63.50. But you get a ton of very good-tasting cannolis. \\n\\nDon't worry, we didn't eat all the cannolis between the 2 of us. Though thatd make a great food challenge. We shared with others. But the cream was very rich but not overly sweet. Their flavors range from classics like chocolate and strawberry, to the more unusual, like tiramisu and postachio.

But I just felt like I had to have the Banh Mi sandwich and I am glad I did. The baguette was light and fresh and perfectly toasted.

If so, then you can die and go to heaven on your next visit to Orlando when you visit the Toothsome Chocolate Emporium & Savory Feast Kitchen at Universal Orlando Resort. Even your kids will break out their cameras to Instagram the delicious concoctions.\\n\\nToothsome Chocolate Emporium & Savory Feast Kitchen in Universal's CityWalk is a Steampunk-inspired restaurant with unique design and decor, characters in costume named Penelope and Jacques who visit you during your meal, and chocolate-inspired drinks and dishes. For example, dinner and its various dishes (appetizers, sides, main courses, and dessert) haven't even begun and you're already getting your sweet tooth fix with Chocolate Almond Bread with Salted Caramel Butter.\\n\\nIn terms of price, appetizers range from $7.50 to $14.95 and are perfect for sharing. Milkshakes are around $12.50. And dinner entrees range from $11.95 (sandwich) to $46.95 (steak) and have lots of options with varying price points in between.\\n\\nThe appetizer list is so extensive that you could order many options and share Tapas style without ever ordering an entree (especially perfect for lunch). Our favorite small plates¬†were¬†the Pork Belly Sliders and the Coffee and Chocolate Stout Chicken Wings. With caramelized onions, mustard aioli, arugula, chocolate dipped bacon, on a pretzel bun, the sliders were mouth watering. The Coffee and Chocolate Stout Chicken Wings were a perfect dish to pair them with. The wings were flash fried and had a chocolate stout glaze. And a not-to-miss appetizer that everyone raves about? The Philly Cheesesteak Rolls. Mmmm! \\n\\nIf you do not prefer chocolate, no need to worry. There are lots of traditional items on the menu that are chocolate free. Our main meal choices reflected those types of items (even though we are chocolate lovers). The Shrimp and Lump Crab Mac & Cheese, the Croque Monsieur, the Flatbread, and the Blue Plate Burger were all amazing.\\n\\nMy favorite milk shake? (I tried at least four.) The Bacon Brittle Milk Shake ($12.50) with Bacon Ice Cream, Bacon Brittle, Bacon Flavor, Chocolate Covered Bacon, Bacon Caramel. If you are just looking for a sugar rush, visit the Dessert Foundry and get a milkshake to go. What's not to love about that?\\n\\nThe only reason I am giving Toothsome 4 out of 5 stars is that the wait is usually long and the service is typically very slow.

On the other hand, the food was less than desirable. I had ordered a burger. Apparently on this day, they decided to use stale buns. You can toast the bun all you want. If the bun is stale, toasting is not going to help at all. This place does not ask you how you want your burger cooked. The burger was dry and thin. You could tell it was one of those cheap Sysco patties. I had a hard time getting the burger down because it was so dry. I had asked for honey mustard and was brought something that was made with brown mustard. Honey mustard does not need to be made with brown mustard. If I wanted brown mustard, I would have asked for it. Even my wife's swiss burger was not that much better. It was also dry and the buns were stale.\\n\\nOverall the service is fantastic. This place needs to start ordering beef patties from somewhere else and stop overcooking them. They can at least cook them to order. I will take my burger med rare.

They have a huge array of impressive restaurants,shopping stores and entertainment. \\n\\nMy favorite part about Disney Springs is the new Spring.  It looks crystal clear just like a real spring with cute lanterns floating around. All the new achectecture and restaurants look new and modern with elevated design features. The parking garages are new and very helping with traffic.\\n\\nSome of the best restaurants for dinner ranging from from affordable to cuisine is Trex, Rainforest Cafe, Stk, Blaze, The Boathhouse, DLuxe Burger, Planet Hollywood, Paddlefish, Morimoto, Ragland Road and so much more. They even have food trucks. For dessert they have Sprinkles, Erin Mckenna's bakery and Vivoli il Gilato plus more. \\n\\nFor entertainment they have so much new stuff including live entertainment on every corner, AMC Dine in theatre, House of Blues, Cirque Du Soleil, Disney Quest, and Splitsville. There's even two Starbucks! \\n\\nShopping is one of the newest additions with well known stores like Sephora, Anthropology, Coca Cola, Free People and so much more! \\n\\nOverall I highly suggest the new improved Disney Springs.

We checked in at 4:13 and received a text at 4:14 welcoming us and telling us to expect a 40 minute wait. NOTE: there were more than 20 empty tables during this time... Severely understaffed. We were finally seated at 5:30.\\n\\nWe viewed the dinner more as \\"paying for the experience\\", but disappointed in most everything else. Our server, and the two nearby servers, all shared an apparent lack in effective training.\\n\\nThe milkshakes were amazing, though $12+, the gift store/emporium was magical and a feast for the eyes.\\n\\nWe had 3 kids meals, 1 appetizer, 1 burger and 3 shakes.

I really enjoyed the yummy cauliflower. The first plate ordered was a large plate of nachos, but it was the last to arrive because the server had forgotten about it and asked if we still wanted it. Really? Another colleague's drink order came as a cocktail instead of a beer.\\n\\nAll that could be forgiven, but seeing a mouse scurry along the floor was quite an experience. When we told the server about it, he just shrugged it off and said \\"¬†I'll tell them about it.¬†\\" Wow!

She gave me an annoyed reply saying I should have told her from the beginning.  2.) She only alerted me to only 1, not 2, of the dishes which contained a significant amount of sunflower seeds.  Fortunately, I noticed it before eating.  \\n\\nAlthough I would give the food a good rating, I did not appreciate the way the waitress handled the situation.  She should either ask about allergies or simply make note of it once it is mentioned.  Even with the allergy mentioned, she was careless about alerting me to which dishes had the allergen.  This could have been a very serious issue but I chose not to make a big deal about it after pointing it out that night.  The waitress did not ever apologize.

I loved it.  My spouse and child did not think it was special.  Here is what you need to know.  \\n\\nWait time:  if you show up after 5:30 on a Friday or Saturday you will wait a long while.  This place is not huge and they are getting ton of positive press locally and regionally.   The parking lot was full when we arrived.  There is not room inside the restaurant to sit while waiting.  There is a bench or two outside but most likely you will be standing outside while waiting.  \\n\\nDecor:  Nobody goes here for decor or design.  Their decor has tacky ugly Christmas lights in June.  Most places with pizza this great have nice decor.  Bruno must spend their profits on something else. \\n\\nPrices:  On the high side but not outrageous.  12 inch cheese pie was $12 or $13.  Most pies are in the $13 to $17 range.   The six slice pie can feed two adults especially if you get a salad or starter.  An appetizer of garlic knots is $10.00 which is way to close in price to the cost of a pizza... but hey if you have patrons lined around the block raising prices is the most profitable and easiest way to shorten the line (or open another location). \\n\\nFood Quality:  The pizza crust was epic.  Beautiful char marks on the crust.  Classic Neopolitan technique, some char on the bottom but the bottom still bends and is not hard.  The sauce sings with freshness.  \\n\\nWe had a Margarita pie and a classic cheese with mushrooms on half of it.  My wife hates parmasean cheese.  Usually a Margarita pie is fresh mozzarella, red sauce, and basil.  The Margarita at Bruno comes topped with a ton of Parmasean. The menu lists the Margarita pie as having parmasean.  She did not read the fine print.  Oops.  Boy that is a lot of parmasean to scrape off.  Sorry honey. \\n\\nSalad had quite a bit of pepper.  I think Bruno should tone the pepper down.  I can always add black pepper.  Guess who hates pepper on her salad.  Sorry honey.  \\n\\nFried Cauliflower Appetizer.  Big portion. Not something I would expect in a pizza place.  The sauce and seasoning seem more like Indian food.  It was also on the spicy side.  Not kid or wife friendly.  Sorry honey. \\n\\nHuge selection of beer and a decent wine list.  They have espresso and cappuccino.  \\n\\nNoise level:  very loud and tables are close together. \\n\\nMusic:  David Bowie, The Clash, and many great tunes.  \\n\\nService:  Prompt, efficient, pleasant.  \\n\\nSuggestion:  Make the appetizers smaller and cheaper or offer an appetizer sampler with a small portion of three appetizers for fixed price.  \\n\\nFor pizza this great ... 5 stars even if the decor is two stars.

Great drinks. Long waits.\\n\\nThe Cheesecake Factory is a recent discovery for me, but one that I'm very pleased to have made. The first time I tried to go, I got turned off by the 45 minute wait to seat 1 and elected to leave. On subsequent visits, though, it was a pleasant experience. If you get there early (between 5-6) the wait isn't bad, even on a Friday night. On a weekend mealtime, though, waits are steadily long, so don't go if you're in a hurry. But if you get stuck waiting, you can always peruse the mall while you're killing time. Or use the time productively by reading the novel-length menu to start trying to decide what you want. An added pro: the bar is open seating, so start with a drink while you wait.\\n\\nAhh, yes - the drinks. The Cheesecake Factory has a section of four \\"Super Creamy\\" signature drinks - I have now tried them all, and can safely conclude that they're all fantastic! If you've got a hankering for girly drinks, definitely try one. Warning, though: in the Flying Gorilla and the Strawberry Creamsicle, you can't even taste the alcohol - generally resulting in sucking them down far too quickly and going back for more. I find those types of drinks particularly dangerous.\\n\\nThe menu is voluminous and very diverse. No matter what you're in the mood for, you should find something here to satisfy you. The food is very good quality and full of flavor. Do *not* expect to eat a full portion, though - either plan to split it with someone or take leftovers home. The serving sizes are easily two meals, especially if you elect an appetizer or dessert. And you will probably only be able to handle one or the other - if you're going to have an entree, be warned that appetizer + entree = no room for dessert. Likewise, entree + dessert = no room for appetizer. Eating here is definitely about picking and choosing.\\n\\nThe tab can get expensive - especially if you add drinks and appetizer/desert.

Actually, there were a number of places that oozed charm on scenic Main Street, it's too bad the city has a questionable rep.

This is no Andina in terms of atmosphere, price and authenticity (and that's a good thing.)  \\n\\nThe Aji de Gallina, chicken in a spiced-milk gravy, was scrumptious!  The rice was on the dry side, but this seems to be the norm for Peruvian.  Serve this heavenly dish with soft Japanese Calrose rice and the bliss factor goes up.  Another wonderful must-try is was a non-meat stew, I don't remember the name, it was very colorful.  The three sauces that accompany the meals-classic green Aji being one-should be bottled and sold.  Again, the versions Andina offers don't even come close.  By the way, I realize the two restaurants are completely different, but most people seem to reference Andina when it comes to Peruvian food.  We were also a fan of the fried fish with vinager sauce, a good deal for $9.50.\\n\\nThe only slight let down was the classical Alfajores.  Andina's version of these caramel cookies is probably the best in town; those from Las Primas in NE are also tasty.\\n\\nIt's a popular lunch spot and there's usually only one server.

My friend's salmon was undercooked, and she barely ate half, and we wondered if the kitchen mixed up the orders of well done vs. well cooked. \\n\\nThis was one of the worst restaurant meals that I have ever had and the absolute worst steak that I have eaten in my life.

Fine, please continue to hate, since the more folks that find out about Vespaio, the longer the wait list gets.  \\n\\nWe have basically have become part the Vespaio family over all these years since we have been coming before Yelp existed in Austin and have seen barkeeps, wait-staff and management come and go.  We have found our favorite menu items and also discovered new dishes along the way.  Suzie almost always gets the lasagna which is such a wonderful meal, there really isn't much more to say, apart from the left overs the next day seem to be almost better.  Other than that she will go with the Hanger Steak, which seems to be perfectly cooked every dang time.  Myself, I tend to bounce around the menu, however I usually grab the risotto of the day.  Always a winner.  I enjoy their cipollini and their pasta's as well.\\n\\nWe love the smell of the restaurant every time we enter their walls.  98% of the time we post up to the bar to eat, meet the neighbors to our left and right, converse with whomever may be behind the bar at the time and eat glorious food and imbibe on wine, prosecco and the ubiquitous coffee martini or as Vespaio coins them, the South Austin Speedball.  Often copied, but never replicated.  It is always the perfect ending to a wonderful meal and a must have.\\n\\nI would be remiss to not mention the service.  It would be somewhat unfair to single anyone in particular out since we know so many of the folks who tend the bar, I wouldn't want to offend anyone who may read the review.  I can just simply say, they all are personal, caring, professional and excellent at their craft.  We have been in when they are slammed at the bar and everyone of them will go about their job, making sure everyone is taken care of, answer any questions and maintain their cool without coping an attitude or even seem rushed.

This proved to be an excellent environment, however, since we were waiting on the fourth party-goer to arrive, and conversation was the order of the day.  The wooden ceiling is quite a ways up, which gives the restaurant an airy feel, but the brick walls and lack of sound damping prove to make for a quite noisy venue once the crowd rolls in.  Fortunately, our party and conversation was complete before noise got to be an issue, and, by then, we were appreciate the white noise cover while we gnoshed.\\n\\nThe Saturday morning we dined happened to be one of the first days Lambert's had rolled out their new brunch menu.  That could really have appealed to me, but, of course, I found out just after making a traditional scrambled egg breakfast.\\n\\nInstead, I ordered from the \\"flip side\\", where a limited offering of more traditional Lambert's fare can be found.  I came geared for barbecue, and was hoping to see what Lambert's had to offer in that regard.\\n\\nI wound up ordering the two meat plate, with brown sugar & coffee rubbed natural  brisket and homemade jalape√±o hot link.  For the sides, I chose the herbed waffle fries and jicama and carrot slaw.  The ladies all went with breakfast, I went with lunch.  What can I say?\\n\\nWhen the food was brought out, I was a bit taken aback.  The portion sizes were a bit less than expected; I think I had maybe five small slices of brisket, and, at best, half of a small link of sausage.  While the waffle fries were generous and flavorful, the jicama and carrot slaw was diminutive as well.  That small portion turned out to be a blessing, since I wasn't very fond of the slaw in the final analysis.\\n\\nMake no mistake, this is barbecue meant for city slickers--you know, so they can go back home to Toledo and tell everyone how they visited Austin and had real Texas barbecue.  It IS Texas barbecue, thankfully, and not the Georgia variant, but it lacked the smell and taste of a good Texas 'cue.  Kind of like a McFadden and Whitehead song, if you know your soul music--you're sure that it's barbecue, but you just can't place it.\\n\\nWhere Lambert's really shined this day was in the service of our waiter.  His courtesy, menu knowledge, and willingness to go above and beyond the usual level of service impressed us all.  He was patient with our delays, yet didn't rush our meal to turn the table as the restaurant reached capacity.  The thing that really won us over is that he was totally accommodating with the way we chose to deal with the check.\\n\\nIn the final analysis, the company I kept and the service our waiter provided definitely saved the day.

The one highlight was the mac and cheese of the day!\\n\\nWe went here for dinner. This place must have been very very good early on, as we saw a lot of 2005-2006 awards in the bathroom.  There was a very conspicuous absence of 2010+ awards though.... Hrmm....\\n\\nAnyway, as others have noted, the decor is really nice.  One thing I like about this place was I could get a same-day reservation on July 4th.  That was pretty nice. And the place was still quite crowded when we got there.  The host and server was very friendly.  We got complimentary biscuit and bread... it was about average. Didn't impress my wife much, even though she loves bread.\\n\\nMy wife ordered the beef brisket, and unfortunately it wasn't very good.  It was very dry, and dense.  Definitely the OPPOSITE of what you want a brisket to be. But the sauce was pretty good. The smashed potato was average, and the highlight for her was the garlic zucchini.\\n\\nI ordered the dinner sampler option, which is 2 half-sized portions of entrees for half price each + 1 dollar. I had the mac and cheese of the day, and it was REALLY REALLY good. I LOVE bowtie pasta, and it was cheesy and smoky from the bacon bits.  It is definitely not like Stouffer's mac and cheese at all!  (I LOVED the microwave mac and cheese as a kid! Especially the burnt crust)  It was straight up delicious. The other was chicken and dumplings.  The dumplings had more of a consistency of a biscuit, rather than like a pirogi, which is what I would normally expect. The chicken was very well cooked and tender... the sauce was a little on the watery side, but still good.\\n\\nI had also ordered a frozen screwdriver, but there was a mixup making the drink, so I didn't get it until the end of the meal.  I didn't really complain or ask for a discount, but the server gave one to me anyway; she took the drink off the receipt.  Which was super nice of her.  We compensated her with a little extra tip.\\n\\nOverall, the ambiance of the place was pretty nice, and a little upscale. The food was decent. I'm sure it was the bomb during it's heyday... but perhaps it's no longer?"},{"name":"Modern Pastry Shop","address":"257 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Can I just sit here forever? \\nThe cannolis are to die for (prefer them over Mike's).

I was told I could not have a cake until Sunday afternoon. I asked if they had any pre made cakes that I could have a birthday greeting placed on and I was told yes. I arrived before 8am on Sunday and found that they had NO birthday cakes available, only a plain cake with some sprinkles on it.

Undoubtedly, management fell short when it came to resolving several issues.  This property has great potential with their comfortable rooms and one of the nicest fitness gyms; however, due to the poor management over a plethora of issues that affected the quality of my stay, I will never stay here again.  The fact that I'm an Elite member is irrelevant - simply treat me like a human who pays to stay at a hotel for comfort and security.  My stay began with terribly slow internet (room 2904) and ultimately, work was completed incredibly slowly.  A page download would take up to one minute; I had flashbacks from the days of landline yore.  Then, the next morning, I was awakened by cleaning ladies that were so loud - slamming doors, talking and chatting at 9am (6am on the west coast, where I'm from).  Next, I  discovered I did not have hot water so I took a lukewarm shower. When I reported this, they sent up a couple engineers to resolve the matter right away.  The engineers mentioned that there were so many people showering at the same time but they looked into it and by that evening, the hot water was back - greatly appreciate that they hopped on that.  When you call \\"At Your Service\\", you are able to reach help 50% of the time.  When I had issues with the internet and the hot water, I could not even reach anyone over the phone to assist me for a good hour (I know, first world problems..but if you pay as much as you do for this kind of room, is it too much to ask?).  But the most disturbing experience occurred that evening, a Saturday night.  There was a party obviously going on in the next room.  It was packed with what sounded like 20 guests hosted by guest, Robert Luschenat.  By nearly 11pm, I was unable to rest prior to an early wake up call to work due to all the noise.  I called for assistance and spoke to front desk manager, Christy, who said security would be sent up to request them to quiet down.  It made the situation worse.  I could hear screaming in the halls, \\"Let them call!  I don't give a &*(%!!\\"  The music, voices, screams and laughs all got louder.  And worse yet, they slammed the heavy door endlessly as people were rotating in and out.  I called \\"At Your Service\\" again for assistance because the guests were continuing to get drunk and obnoxious.  When I could finally reach someone, Christy said they would send someone up again - which at this point, I knew would be ineffective since it was just angering them more.  Ultimately, these folks nabbed the \\"Do Not Disturb\\" sign off my door (pretty appropriate to do as that sign was meaningless at this point).  I had asked for a change of rooms and was told there were no rooms available.  I felt far from safe and comfortable, in addition to feeling tired and trying to prevent myself from getting stressed.  I somehow got through the night.  In the morning, when I was waiting in line at the reception - I could hear a female guest with a stroller telling the staff that there were drunk partiers around her room last night and they were knocking on her door at midnight, disturbing her and her baby.  Obviously, management failed to assist many of us.  When I got back this afternoon and saw the guests had left, this older woman was cleaning up what looked like a hurricane hit.  There were alcohol bottles everywhere, food on the floor, the desk...I helped out the cleaning lady by collecting the copious amounts of trash all over while she waited for more support. I feel like management did nothing about this and they also never personally see it.  No one came to my room to hear what it sounded like.  No one saw the mess that was made in the room.  Maybe one effective way to do this is to separate by floor the partiers from the families and the business travelers?  That could be the first question asked upon reserving a room - 'Oh, are you here for business?  Are you here to recreate in town?  etc. etc'.  I'm sure those ruckus-inducers had rooms spread out and it would have been much better to put them all next door to each other as to not bother everyone else who paid for a room to simply get rest and do business.  When I called and spoked to Katie, another front desk manager in the morning, she apologized and offered me a banana or a glass of wine.  All I really wanted was to be able to get one word in as she kept talking and interrupting me.  For those that communicate with her, you would understand this statement.  I think one of the most important traits of a manager is to simply....listen. I'm still in this cursed hotel and checking out with running shoes on. They have lost me as a patron and kept the party-harders.  They were able to fully accommodate them so in the future, these will shave off the type of customers that respect others and the property."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Aye cannoli!!

This hash contained juicy and tender pieces of fresh salmon with wholesome potato wedges, lightly roasted. The potatoes were chunks of starchy goodness. The sauce was seasoned with a rich creamy flavor. The eggs were good and the yolks were the perfect consistency. \\n\\nCrunchy French Toast - thick slices of challah bread, dipped in cornflakes and grilled golden brown. How friggin' genius is this dish?! Three breakfast items in one? Bread, eggs, and cereal. Who woulda thunk it? Such a creative yet, simple concoction. The challah bread was sensational. It was doughy, soft, and fluffy. The cornflakes embedded in the honey-sweet bread were crunchy and fun to eat. Although after a while, the cornflakes hardened and turned dry and chewy.

The options within these few city blocks continue to surprise me, after eating my way around here for 15 years. One thing that I always miss about Boston's Chinatown is that a certain level of authenticity and quality seem to be prerequisites for success. In any other shitty New England town, or even the Chinatowns of Manhattan and Montreal, for that matter, many of the \\"staple\\" restaurants seem to rest on their stale, gooey, uninspired laurels, from my experiences. Boston--hell no. There is a fierce, yet understated fight--I mean, this is eastern and southern Chinese cuisines we're talking about, not Sichuanese hot pot-- for the best dim sum and the best Xiao long bao. As of right now, China Pearl has become my front runner. \\nI can't, for the life of me, predict how and when all of the variables align for a stellar dim sum. It was Friday, barely noon. Every cart rolled by, every pork morsel fresh, every fried taro thing crispy. The things I call \\"kaya bao\\", egg/coconut custard in a steamed bun (but not the kaya bao that use pandan leaf in Malaysia/Singapore), were almost as good as the Nonya versions. The tofu skin stuffed with who-cares-unless-you-are-allergic-to-something stuff was really well executed; tightly wound bundles in a lightly thickened chicken broth. But what surprised me most: these black pepper pan fried dumplings, perfectly seasoned with black pepper, pork and scallions, in a crisp yet moist dumpling, and a ginger/vinegar dipping sauce on the side. Chinatown is oftentimes my own personal utopia. I've spent my life trying to understand it, how and why it survives as a culture both similar to its ancestral land and quite distinct. One shared characteristic: this kind of food is for families, working people , meant to eat together, and to be enjoy; and the standards are of the utmost importance. (When you go into a grocery store in China, watch: the old folks will be inspecting each and every morsel of food that goes into the basket, because compromised ingredients will not be tolerated). And eating this food must be affordable. The folks in Chinatown (unlike those in other, more storied ethnic enclaves) aren't going to subtly try to empty your bank account for subpar crap, or try to wow you with the newest gimmicky chef's foie gras baozi or beef tartar jiaozi, or some other nonsense. \\"Let's *elevate* cheap, simple, well balanced 'ethnic' food so we can *elevate* our income\\".

While prices are a bit higher than the average BBQ place, it's not that different ($14 vs. $10-12 for a two meat/two sides plate).  Either to justify the extra couple bucks or distinguish themselves from less refined BBQ, Lambert's employs the pretentious fine dining standby of \\"Mention spices and the natural/organic quality of the meat\\".  So they don't have 'Sliced Brisket' or 'Pork Ribs', they have \\"Brown Sugar & Coffee Rubbed Natural Brisket\\" and \\"Maple and Coriander Crusted Natural Pork Ribs\\".\\n\\nThe brisket was thicker and less tender than typical smoked brisket - e.g., you couldn't rip it apart with your hand very easily.  The brown sugar added some sweetness.  The pork ribs were a little sweeter and less meaty than I liked but were tasty.  Basically, the BBQ is a bit fancier but I prefer Rudy's or popular standbys like Salt Lick or Stubb's over it.  If you have a sweet tooth, you might like this better.\\n\\nThe sides, on the other hand, were fantastic.  The mac and cheese was oozing with a mix of molten cheeses.  One of the best I've ever had.

When it's warm out, you can eat at the park across the street, which is nice.\\n\\n - The actual taste and prep varies.  We learned that different guys are in charge of the cooking behind the counter on different days (we never figured out the rotation, tho), so the chicken curry, for example, that was out-of-this-world delicious one day can be ho-hum the next.

The shell is perfect with the perfect amount of give, and there is just the right amount of tasty chocolate.  Nothing about these cannolis is too sweet.  They're are also on the smaller side, and therefore perfect for that friend who claims she's \\"not a dessert person.\\"\\n\\nWe also tried the plain shell with chocolate custard, and I thought this was skippable.  The custard was good but not great, with a flavor and consistency akin to a reasonable chocolate pudding.\\n\\nMy one complaint about Modern is that the selection of cannolis is limited compared to Mike's.  Just adding the option of pistachio would add a lot more to the menu.  No matter.  I would gladly go back and order just the one thing - that paragon of chocolate-dipped cannolis."},{"name":"Ginza","address":"16 Hudson St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Typical Japanese restaurant owned by Chinese people.

There are other things you need to know. Like how they have a bajillion different kinds of FOR-REALLY REAL CHAI TEA. Like the kind you might drink in a country where chai tea is basically a national beverage. This is not the chai you'd get at your local Starbucks, or even your local hippie sip shop. This is the real deal. And it comes in a million flavors. OK, not a million. But like, five. Which is more than I can say for most regular coffee shops, let alone any donut shop pretty much anywhere.\\n\\nBut duh, you're probably here for the donuts, right? And there's probably a line out the door for those. But let me say this: Do not be deterred by the line. For one, it's probably not as long as it looks. The counter isn't set back very far once you get through the door, so the line gets \\"out the door\\" about four people in. Even if it is quite long - I really think (and as a dyed-in-the-wool queue hater, this is a big endorsement) that the wait is worth it. You will be getting served some piping-hot, just made (like LITERALLY MADE WHILE YOU WAIT - you can watch the dudes behind the counter make the donuts, for real) bomb donuts. Krispy Kreme ain't got nothin' on this place.\\n\\nAnd those dudes making the donuts? And the dudes taking your order? They are all the dudeliest dudes that ever did dude. And by that I mean - they are super-friendly and genuinely engaged in the process - they have fun behind that counter, and that enthusiasm for sweet, sweet confection perfection is contagious, and communicated throughout the clientele, making for a really fun atmosphere. No indifferent donut-slinging, no ironic eye-rolling, no punch-pulling or backtalk. Honestly, I have no idea how these dudes keep it together - they're slinging delicious donuts at lightning speed to people who've waited in the rain - all while keeping a smile on their faces and a joke at the ready. (And why do I keep saying \\"dudes\\"? Because on the day I visited, it was an all-male crew working the place - I'm sure there are ladies in Pip's employ as well, I just didn't see any that day).\\n\\nOn to the atmosphere! The inside is like a cozy freakin' log cabin. Which is good, because there's going to be a fair amount of milling around in the little lobby area while you wait for your donuts to be delivered, and watch the magical donut-making process happen. Or, you can go wait in the other room, lined with tables that seemed to be mostly filled with waiting patrons, rather than eating patrons. (What I'm trying to say here is, this doesn't really seem set up for a lingering, table-service, dine-in kind of place, but it's still got the cozy-feel of one - if you know what I mean).\\n\\nOnce you've got your donuts in your sticky little fingers (and if you've done it right, you ordered at least one of each flavor), good luck trying to hang onto them for more than 30 seconds. They're like the M&Ms of the donut world - they melt in your freakin' MOUTH. The toppings and flavors are perfect, too - seemingly featuring a heavy Nutella rotation (I'll fight anyone who doesn't like Nutella) - and added to your treat right after it's fried.\\n\\nThe only question you need ask yourself after a visit to Pip's is: How soon can I go back?"},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"The view and fajitas are amazing.

I went there using a Scoutmob and probably wouldn't have tried it without the discount.  That being said, while the food was good, it wasn't incredible so I'm not likely to go back without another coupon of sorts.  I had the veal marsala and my friend had the pasta with forte sauce.  The portion on the veal marsala was a reasonable meal sized but the pasta dish my friend got could have easily been 2 large meals.  The bread that they gave us with the pasta was not great.  So I rate the food 3 stars and the service 4 stars.  The inside atmosphere is a lot nicer than I expected from the outside look of the restaurant and while it does give off a feel for romantic or intimate at first, it's really more of a nice casual restaurant."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Let me start by saying that I'm not normally a dessert person...

The gentleman explained he is hard of hearing and couldn't hear his wife.   The manager dismissed it and said \\"I'm sorry, I will need you to move back\\".

Burger. We noticed Hero Sushi back before it opened officially, but we didn't get a chance to try it out until after it had been in business for about five weeks.\\n\\nBe warned - this is not a cheap place. The typical sushi order (2 pieces) was $5. A bowl of miso soup was $2. The house salad was $5(!). Granted, it was a larger salad than you get at, say, Benihana or equivalent places, but it's not like it was chock full of exotic ingredients like avocados or hearts of palm.\\n\\nI had the salmon teriyaki ($18), which came with a piece of salmon that I estimate was 6 or 7 ounces, a few greens, and a scoop of mashed sweet potatoes. The salmon was cooked properly (not too tough), and the mashed potatoes were delicious. But it was not a large portion of food. It didn't even come with rice, although the waitress brought us some upon request (and did not charge us for it).\\n\\nMy dad had the chicken teriyaki and found the chicken overcooked. The rest of the family ordered sushi pieces and rolls.\\n\\nThe food, therefore, ranged from pretty good (salmon, sushi) to not so good (chicken). The utility of the place was more toward the lower end of the range. By that, I mean, what utensils did we get....? Just chopsticks. Have you tried eating mashed potatoes with chopsticks? My mom-in-law says chopsticks are the perfect utensil, but no. They don't work well for mashed potatoes. You know what else they don't work well for? Big pieces of chicken with bone....\\n\\nI gather that this place is aiming for a certain clientele that is less price-sensitive than many. Even so, it feels like there's some nickel and diming going on - miso soup and house salad don't cost that much. For $18, you might reasonably expect soup and salad with the smallish entree.\\n\\nConsidering that we went on a Friday evening and there were a few empty tables, it might seem like there aren't enough price-insensitive customers around. If this restaurant were to lower its prices, or maybe provide more value for what it's charging, it might be worth returning to. If you're willing to head to the other side of Mountain Park, you might try Sho instead.

We have had multiple disappointing encounters, but after last night, I think we will be taking our business elsewhere for a very long time. \\n\\nGators currently allows you to make orders online, so we thought we would give it a try and pick up some food to eat at home. We live less than 10 minutes away, so we weren't too concerned about losing any quality of the food. We placed an order for 20 wings, a veggie quesadilla, 2 side salads, and a side of fries. When I went to pick up the order, I checked it through, knowing we have gotten home before and missed an item. The order was incorrect, despite specific notes made while ordering online. I asked for no mushrooms or onions in my veggie quesadilla, which there were, and one of our 10 piece wings to be split into two sauces, which they were not. The waitress handling the to-go orders was very kind and quick to fix the mistake. After about 20 minutes, she returned from the kitchen with 5 new correct wings and a new quesadilla. She also handed me two $5 coupons to use next time from the manager. The manager had discussed the situation with the waitress directly in front of me, but never acknowledged me or apologized for the mistake. \\n\\nOnce I returned home, EVERYTHING was cold and old, including the new food she had brought me. Even the salad tasted gross (how can you mess that up?), like the lettuce had been sitting out all day. More than half of the quesadilla didn't even have filling. We are not particular or picky people, typically when there is a mistake with an order, we let it slide. Unfortunately, though, after spending $45 on almost non-edible food, we certainly won't be taking out food from Gators ever again. It will also be quite a long time before we ever return, IF we choose to return. I truly hope a place I once loved does not continue to decline as it has and is.

The fennel and coriander rub on the ribs was delicious, but in my book, it was pretty standard for Texas.  The pulled pork was tender and smothered in sauce, and...also standard for Texas.  Each meat came with a small side of Apple Slaw and Bread & Butter Pickle Chips, respectively, which actually were more impressive to me than their complementing main attraction.  The mac n' cheese was rich n' creamy, as any good mac n' cheese should be; however, I was disappointed when the waitress confirmed my hunch that one of the \\"3 Cheeses\\" was indeed...Velveeta.

But if we just talk about the actual taste of the cannoli I'll begin with the espresso. The espresso did not taste like an espresso. AT ALL. It just had a light taste of chocolate. In terms of the actual cream, the cream was too frozen and thick. Tasted too buttery. The chocolate mousse cannoli tasted REALLY REALLY chocolaty. Now I don't mind it that much because I'm a chocolate fanatic/lover, but even I found it a little overwhelming in terms of the cream. The cream was also really thick, heavy, frozenish, and like refrigerated butter consistency. I originally thought the chocolate mousse flavor would taste like chocolate mousse but no. All I could taste really were the chocolate chips and more just chocolate. Didn't taste like a mousse. Also the wrapping cookie for the chocolate mousse flavor was stale. \\n\\nNow I'm not sure if I just picked bad flavors but I don't recommend the chocolate mousse whatsoever and not the espresso if you're actually looking for a slight coffee taste. The red velvet cheesecake was not that great either. It wasn't good but it wasn't horrible. Just really average. I found it to be WAY too sweet. And I LOVE sweets. I thought the red velvet cake on top with the icing was overbearing. The cheesecake was not dense enough with the cheese. It was more on the cream light side than cheesy dense and I swear there's way too much sugar that was dumped in. It's like you're literally just eating spoonfuls of sugar. Bleh. If you really want to try a cheesecake, I recommend maybe ordering the strawberry cheesecake instead..  The red velvet flavor isn't anywhere near mixed into the original cheesecake. It's just a thin slice of red velvet cake with icing put on top of the original cheesecake. MEH. Avoid. \\n\\nThe store itself didn't really look very clean either.

We had soup, some noodles, and some curry all of the dishes tasted the same, which was that they tasted like nothing (or in some cases very old nothing).

Big mistake. Even the view was disappointing as the lake water is very low due to drought conditions and the evening we were there the sky was very hazy so the sunset was \\"meh.\\" We're from Seattle where we have lakes, sun (sometimes!) and mountains so while this setting might be spectacular to some, it was just okay to us. Perhaps we are spoiled.\\n\\nThe Oasis is a bit of a drive from downtown Austin and really is quite a tourist trap. We were barely acknowledged by a gaggle of snotty sorority-like girls at the front desk who told us there was a 35 minute wait to sit outside but we could be seated immediately inside. There were literally 10 girls standing at the front desk doing nothing but giving us the stink eye, seeming to regale in the fact that us tourist \\"losers\\" could not sit outside. We did not come to sit inside but wanted to catch the sunset so we opted for a table inside the bar that had west-facing windows and we could meander outside to check out the view as we pleased. As we sat inside we watched numerous outside tables sit vacant the entire time we were there. Whiskey Tango Foxtrot?\\n\\nWe waited and waited for service in the bar and finally went to the bartender to ask if we could order.

So even after seeing that Petsi Pies was in Bon Appetit or Food and Wine or one of my silly foodie magazines, I wasn't convinced that I needed to go.\\nStupid me.\\nAbout six months ago, my mother came to visit, and she loves pie. So she went, and brought me two muffins for breakfast- the corn muffin filled with raspberry jam and a bran muffin. They were both very good, but the corn muffin may have actually changed my life. I am a cake girl, remember? And this was really good corn... cake? It's probably not fair to call this a muffin. It is really an un-iced cupcake. I'm sure it packs a caloric punch. And every wee calorie is worth it. \\nSo then I tried a couple of other things. They're ginger cookies (and I do love me a ginger cookie) are phenomenal. Huge, so prepare to share or be very full, and full of pieces of ginger, with plenty of spice. Perhaps a little less chewy. I've also had an almond brioche sort of bread, and it was also excellent.\\nI have also had their pie. And I even really liked their pie. The first was an apple-pear-cranberry pie in the fall, which was such a perfect fall pie. The second was the real game changer, though. If there was one kind of pie in the world that I REALLY disliked, it was pecan pie. Even for a southern/midwestern girl, it's always been really gross to me: too sweet, too vaguely mealy, and just sort of weird in texture and overwhelming in flavor. Petsi's pecan pie was definitely a game changer, no question. It was phenomenal. I had a quarter of a tiny little pie, and it's probably good I was sharing it with three others, or I would have eaten more. Like all of it. \\nI occasionally have to force myself to walk longer routes to avoid Petsi's. It is that good, and this lady has to fit in a wedding dress in six months. But if you haven't been, and you've heard all the hubub and you're in doubt, as I was, don't be. Just go. Have the pecan pie.

This definitely something you can share among 3-4 people. \\n\\nEmpire Eggs (14.95): potato pancakes topped off with two poached eggs with spinach, smoked salmon, and hollandaise. The hollandaise sauce was a bit sour (perhaps from the lemon juice), but nonetheless it was still tasty! Plenty of smoked salmon slices. The potato pancakes was something new (in my opinion, more preferable) compared to your traditional English muffin. These came with some more potatoes (diced) on the side. \\n\\nWe were mid-way through our food and our waitress still didn't provide us with our drinks :(.

Do not eat inside the park, especially if you are going to celebrate with a nice mean for a special occasion, like Valentine's Day.\\n\\nFirst, it is important to note that we selected this establishment for three reasons: (1) Shrimp and Grits, (2) we could take the monorail there easily from Magic Kingdom, and (3) we could order drinks from a full bar. Well the monorail ended up being down for maintenance until 7pm. Our dinner reservations were for 5pm. That put a wrench in our plans. Then while waiting for the boat to go over to the Grand Floridian Resort, the boats went down. We had to walk over and take a bus and ended up being about 20 minutes late for our reservations. I had to call the reservation line to make sure we would not make the bus trip only to find out we got charged for being a no-show. Since it was technically Disney's fault, they made an exception and allowed us to arrive 20 minutes late for our reservation. While (2) was complicated some, we were still excited for (1) and (3), and luckily, (1) and (3) lived up to the hype because the Shrimp and Grits were excellent and the White Russians were delicious. \\n\\nService was very good. Friendly, knowledgeable, and speedy. If anything, it was too fast, but that might have been because we were late and they wanted us to get in and out so more people could be seated. Nevertheless, we  ordered a 2nd drink and took our sweet time, but I am getting ahead of myself, so lets back track to the beginning of the meal.\\n\\nBesides good service, the establishment was beautiful. The Grand Floridian really is one of the more elegant looking resorts. I have never stayed at any of the resorts, but I have eaten at a few, and I was very very impressed with the decor and grand feeling I felt upon walking inside. \\n\\nWe rushed through the lobby, we were late, and over to the Grand Floridian Cafe. We were quickly seated and almost immediately greeted by our waitress. We said we needed some time to select drinks. We browsed through the extensive drink selection, but both decided that a regular old White Russian sounded better than the advertised cocktails. They did a fine job making the White Russian, strong enough to give you a buzz, but not so strong as yo gross you out. \\n\\nI ordered the Orecchiette Pasta with grilled chicken and asiago cream sauce. It was spectacular and they really loaded it up with chicken. My fiancee got the shrimp and grits. We both thoroughly cleaned our plates and left with a full and pleased feeling.\\n\\nSince it was Valentine's Day, we went for dessert, even though we normally skip dessert. We did the dessert sampler. The solid chocolate Mickey, OH WOW! SUGAR RUSH! The Boston Cream Pie and Lemon Cheesecake were our favorites out of the sampler. \\n\\nI highly recommend leaving the park and coming to a resort for dinner, especially if you do not have to bring kids along. It is a nice break from the craziness inside the park, there is just something a bit more relaxing inside the resort. Most important, you get better food and drinks, for a better price, compared to anything inside the actual parks.

I'd recalled a Puerto Rican friend of ours talking about it and how authentic it was.  That it \\"reminded her of Puerto Rico\\".  Upon walking in, I was greeted from the counter with enthusiasm.  I told the lady at the counter that it was my first time there and that I wanted to leave with their best sandwich.  The one that was unlike anything I could get at other chains, I think there might have been a small language barrier with my specific question so she had a man named Felipe come over to help.  He shook my hand and thanked me for coming in.  I asked him the same question and he suggested the \\"All Pro\\".  I told him that I was not a big fan of pastrami, and he told me that if I didn't like it, that he would give me something else.  When I asked about their French fries, he said that they were a thicker cut, but asked me if I had ever had a \\"corn stick\\".  I hadn't so he grabbed one for me.  It was like a long hush puppy made of rolled and fried corn meal.  It coupled with the \\"mayo ketchup\\" was VERY good.  We talked more while my food was being made.  I learned that he was the owner.  That his father was the creator of the restaurant chain in Puerto Rico and that they were slowly expanding to Florida and going from there.  I honestly cannot recall ever having such an experience in a counter based restaurant.  It was pretty incredible\\n  \\nNeedless to say, the All Pro was amazing, and my wife said her Ruben was one of the best she'd had in a long time.  A few weeks later, I went back with the last Groupon I had (3 - $7 vouchers) and was met with the same enthusiasm.  He even remembered me from before.  Again I'd ordered the All pro and my wife a Ruben, both with the corn sticks.  Felipe asked what I had gotten and told me that he wanted me to try their Cuban, which from the sound of it had been upgraded with made on premises roasted pork shoulder.  He even showed me a picture of them cooked in a roasting pan on his phone.  Again, he gave me the same offer.  That if I didn't like it, that he'd give me the All Pro.  As with the All Pro, I was far from disappointed as Felipe had promised.\\n\\nI'm all out of Groupons but I will absolutely stop by when I'm in the area again.

They have buffet by the pound and menu ordering as well. The restaurant was clean of course and roomy with table seating. The environment was comfortable and nicely decorated. The food was very fresh and hot. I had a couple of choices from the buffet: General Tso's chicken, beef with peppers, lo mein and fried rice. The food was very mild compared to what I'm used too. I was hoping for richer flavor and more spice.  Next time I'll order off the menu and ask for more spice.  The staff was friendly and seemed to me to be first or second generation immigrants from Asia. I'd say the cashier spoke excellent English. The wait was brief. About 10 people were in front of me and it took about 10 minutes to get my buffet selection and pay. The buffet was not super expensive. I think it's $6.99 a pound.

I patronize an establishment to get what I need and no amount of frilly curtains or stand up comedy will encourage me to return if my basic needs are not met.\\n\\nI started out ordering a large latte once or twice a week from KBC but soon discovered that it was close to $7 and I rarely finished it so I quickly cut back to a small. Another employee picks up our coffee order and while I was satisfied with the flavor I always thought it was a little expensive even for the small at over $4. I thought, okay, they specialize in coffee, what do I know, so I kept having my coffees. Today we decided to try out the lunch menu and placed the order by phone using the non-priced online menu. \\n\\nNever ... let me make that perfectly clear, NEVER will I ever order anything from this place again. I mean, who do they think they are catering to? Location--less than favorable neighborhood near a defunct mall, and in a strip mall no less, in a working class area. Now adding a community college into the mix and this place charges $15.00 for a dammed cold cut sandwich? \\n\\nNewsflash, they are not an upscale restaurant no matter what they think ... and they are surrounded by fifty places to buy a $6.00 - $7.00 sandwich every bit as good as what they are putting out. Advice from me is, get pricing on everything before you commit. Three people at my work ate lunch today to the tune of $45.00 - three sandwiches, with chips and salsa as sides, two cookies and one small coffee and a 16 oz bottled diet coke. Still in shock. By the way - it might not hurt to get some heat sleeves that actually stay on the coffee cups. What a pain to always have to tape it in place. \\n\\nUPDATE TO OWNER RESPONSE\\n\\nI appreciate your prompt and courteous response to my review. Maybe I've watched too many episodes of Bar Rescue and sometimes it seems that so many conflicts could easily be resolved with forethought about location and target markets.\\n\\nSince yesterday I have read repeated reviews about the prices at KBC but it never occurred to me to check them beforehand as I am in retail and understand about competition and the value of being consistent with other companies that provide similar products and services.\\n\\nNobody likes a nasty surprise, so when a customer complains about our pricing I can always respond with, we are competitive, you will not find a similar product cheaper anywhere else.\\n\\nIf you feel your product has a higher value, maybe pricing on the web site would prevent the kind of shock that we went through when we picked up our lunch. Do you sell any sandwich for under $9? if so that would be good information to have beforehand. I don't think any of us paid less than that and we all ordered different things. You cannot always rely on the customer to ask for pricing nor can you rely on remembering to warn them about an unexpected high price.\\n\\nIt's not necessary to treat us all to lunch, although the offer is appreciated. Your web site offers detailed information about your menu, if you could add pricing, that should resolve the issue for future customers. You guys are like right next to the blood bank, this is not a downtown bistro that caters to upper end customers. Offer some affordable lunches for the working class and college students that you are surrounded by.

Fast forward 20 minutes into waiting, my group of friends and I were not acknowledged in any way by the staff.

No water or menu was given while we waited and for the most part, all of us resorted to checking out Yelp to see what kind of food we wanted to order. Despite the numerous pictures posted on Yelp, it was rather difficult to find dinner specific food pictures and so.....we waited.\\n\\nWhen we finally got the attention of our server, all of us were pretty hungry. We gave our order and  miraculously, we also got water.

Not only does this offer you an opportunity to sample 2 dishes at the price of one dinner entree, but this does give you a great value since the food portion was big and filling. My girls and I all ordered: 1/2 Mac & Cheese of the day + 1/2 Meatloaf. Overall, food was very yummy. The mac & cheese was quite flavorful and the meatloaf w/ mashed potatoes was savory and filling. Surprisingly enough, the food came out very quick! So that was quite a delight in midst of our disappointment with the service. \\n\\nAs for pricing, it is slightly above average (ranging in the $10-15+ zone) but it was worth it for the quality of the food.\\n\\nOverall, this would have been a solid 4-5/5 rating for me in regards for the food and quality.

Now, hummus is fine food, but if I'm going out to an upscale gastropub in the Cambridge area, I'd expect that the folks in the kitchen could do better than hummus. I was surprised when hummus was the only thing offered to my wife and myself. Veganism isn't that weird anymore, and every other place in Arlington Center can keep up. I hope this changes. \\n\\nAlso, the music was beyond terrible. The rotation selection (Pandora?) went from Lynrd Skynrd to blaring Katie Perry in a matter of minutes. Now, this place is gorgeous, and the vibe lends itself to a lounge type feel, or a neighborhood pub.... not an 18+ dance club/monster truck rally mashup. \\n\\nMinor quibbles; no hooks on the inside of the bathroom stalls, and the paper towel dispenser/hand dryer is hung on the wrong side of the sink (causing a bit of a traffic jam in front of the stalls). \\n\\nSo, our first visit was a mixed experience. Still, this place is brand new and I'm sure little kinks take awhile to work out. Since it's within walking distance we'll give Common Ground another try, sometime in the future. I hope I can then write a 5 star update!"},{"name":"Hyatt Regency - Austin","address":"208 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Location and price per room was on point.

We called guest services and they had housekeeping come change the sheets. Housekeeping threw everything on the ground including the duvet and changed everything BUT the duvet which was on the ground and she threw it back on top for us to use.

We were relatively picky customers, and they made sure every last detail was addressed, prepped, and executed. On our wedding day, the reception was the least of our worries. We went into it with high confidence instilled by the quality of service offered by Stephanie and Elizabeth and ended the evening with big smiles on our faces (not only because we just got married).\\n\\nThe Foothills Ballroom on the top floor is a long rectangular room, and windows fill one entire side of the room for a spectacular view of downtown Austin's skyline and Town Lake, especially at sunset and at night. We chose to use the adjacent ballroom for our cocktail hour and for random stuff like party favors and guest book signing.\\n\\nThe catering menu is very extensive, and it was difficult but fun narrowing down our menu. The chef also helped us create a Chinese-German fusion hors d'oeuvre! The Hyatt made our beautiful cake and worked seamlessly with our florist to match the cake decorations to the table centerpieces. And even with a nice riesling for our white wine and a delicious sangria for our red, the price per person was reasonable compared with other venues. Many of our guests told us in the months following our wedding that the food was so delicious and filling, and we couldn't agree more. On that note, Stephanie and Elizabeth worked closely with us to schedule the evening and made sure that there was enough time for us to enjoy the food, too.\\n\\nOverall, we loved having our wedding at the Hyatt, and our guests seemed to have a very enjoyable experience as well."},{"name":"Austin's Pizza South Lamar","address":"1817 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"One star patrons. \\nTwo star pizza.\\nThree star location.\\nFour star prices.\\nFive star staff.\\nBut also...five star adventures.\\n\\nI will explain each of these in turn.\\n\\nAfter handling a wild bird (I will get to this later), I went to wash my hands. The ladies' was unlocked, but was occupied by the Olsen twins, one of whom was vomiting into the sink, the other applying eyeliner while quelling a cocaine-induced nosebleed. Okay, it wasn't really the Olsen twins, but the two girls were equally emaciated and rivaling the downtrodden former child stars in their boho bag-lady chic style, laden with chunky flea market jewelry, expensive scarves, and handbags large enough to hide an elephant gun in. Also, did I mention the vomit and the cocaine? Yeah. I ducked into the men's to get the bird flu off my fingers.\\n\\nOnce my manos were sufficiently scrubbed down, I partook in the plain cheese pizza I had ordered. It was blase (does that work? Can the pizza itself be blase, or do I have to be blase about it? My grasp on the English language diminishes...) and perhaps some toppings would have enlivened it somewhat, but as it was just pretty bad plain cheese pizza.\\n\\nWe had ordered plain cheese because of our limited funds, my friend and I, and we spiced it up as best we could with peppers and Parmesan...it sufficed. And it was pretty big and pretty cheap - only twelve dollars, if I recall.\\n\\nThe girl working behind the counter that day was sweet and absolutely beautiful, wearing a hand-embellished t-shirt and sporting some very pretty tattoos. She was approachable and very friendly. I had an instant little crush, a little crush that was further cemented by her compassionate and helpful response to my friend Jes and I having discovered a struggling fledgling sparrow flopping around unhappily in their sunken patio.\\n\\nWe secured a Mountain Dew box from the pretty counter girl, and I coaxed the little fellow inside, where he peeped and chirped a melancholy song while we devoured our late lunch. \\n\\n(Later, with the support of Austin's Pizza staffers, we would do the right thing, which is put the fledgling into the grass and wait for its parents to come and help him out with food gathering - sometimes older baby birds spend a few awkward days outside the nest before they master flight, and their parents still provide an assist: also contrary to popular belief, birds will not reject a babe that has been replaced in its nest, if the case is such that the bird has fallen out - our little guy already had feathers and was making some worthy attempts at aviation, but he just hadn't gotten the hang of adult life quite yet - sort of like those of us who occasionally had to ask our folks for rent money when we were in our early twenties).\\n\\nSo, in short: the staff rocks, and will help with anything. Watch out for the restrooms. Get toppings or be prepared for ultimate blandness. And keep an eye out for baby birds."},{"name":"Moshi Sushi Bar","address":"2152 E Main St","city":"Bexley","stars":"3.5","text":"Been here twice before and has been amazing every time I come.

But Yaletown Brewing Company just nailed it for me. They had a vegetarian black bean chili burger that was just so yum! Tomatoey, flavorful and pleasantly spicy, which almost reminded me of an Indian curry. I guess I was expecting tasteless bar food, but what I got instead was a real, flavorful, fulfilling meal. Aww yea! I also had their local stout which turned out to be pretty good.

My fianc√©e got the tonkatsu shoyu dipping noodles which he hasn't been able to find since we got back from our trip to japan and it was love at first sight. The broth was perfectly seasoned and again all the toppings were great.

Here's what I mean:\\n\\n*GUILT-FREE: I mean this in two ways. First, I try really hard to keep a healthy lifestyle and, accordingly, to eat nutritious foods in reasonable portions. At Musubi, I love that you can cater your portion size to your hunger. If you're starving - get a couple musubis! Add egg! And have some mac salad on the side! If you're only mildly hungry, a triangle musubi and kombucha is a perfect snack. Plus, the menu has healthy ingredients like eggplant, kelp, squid, and tuna. This is not a place you go, overindulge, and leave feeling like \\"oh, I really shouldn't have had that.\\"  After a Musubi meal, I feel full and satisfied with no regrets.\\n\\nSecond, it's guilt-free because Musubi seems to really emphasize organic and local food, including local beers and fish caught in the Pacific Northwest. So it feels good to know the food is not having a big impact on my carbon footprint.\\n\\n*FRIENDLY STAFF: the owners and workers all are super friendly and accommodating.\\n\\n*AFFORDABLE: Because of the local and organic ingredients the musubis are about $3.00 each so they are a little more expensive than musubis in Hawaii. But I usually get a tofu musubi, umami bomb, and mac salad and I get really full for about $9.00 which is a super affordable meal.\\n\\n*VEGETARIAN OPTIONS: there are lots of them!\\n\\n*CONVENIENT: The wrappers make the musubis super easy to pack if you need food on-the-go. I've gotten take-out for large groups several times and it's worked really well.  \\n\\nLastly, (and most importantly) the food is delicious!
