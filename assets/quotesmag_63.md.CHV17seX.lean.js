I'm giving this place 2 stars for a very good reason, they're food was not that great. the hot and sour soup was very bland and uninteresting, the Mongolian beef, chicken, and shrimp also lacked flavor, and the combination lo mein was, you guessed it, the same quality as everything else. The serving of fried rice i got with my dinner special tasted ok and the egg roll shared a similar taste of meh. \\nIdk if I just came here during a bad cook shift, or what, but I do not plan on going back and rolling the dice again. I also do not advise anyone else to try this place. \\nThe service was good, but also a little annoying. My girlfriend had to take a call at one point in the meal and I was on my phone as well during that time and one of the waitresses came up and asked if we wanted boxes. I said no, not yet and she asked if it was because we didn't like the food. That question made me feel really awkward because I surely didn't want to be too frank with her so early in the meal. \\nBack to the food: it was edible, not very Chinese and not very tasty. I'm an amateur cook and I'm sure I could have cooked the dishes better. \\nRecommendation: NO, I'll be honest, with all the different cuisine available in Austin, all the different Asian cuisine, and all the different Chinese cuisine, I do not recommend you visit China Palace.

Usually, when eating dimsum, the table should have more than 1 dish at a time.  However, since this restaurant was so ridiculously slow, most of the dishes came 1 at a time.   We ordered a minced pork and thousand yr old egg congee that was bland; the meat was super salty and there was tiny bits of the egg. The beef balls tasted like cardboard, egg custard tarts had heavy custard with stale crust.

The first time I went, our group arrived right as the Saturday night band was getting ready to play.  It was a hopping place at that point, so we started with drinks at the bar in the back.  After one round, we were finally seated and were enjoying the live jazz music.  (You wouldn't expect sushi and jazz, but it works!)  I think with the buzz from the alcohol, the fun, relaxed atmosphere, and the good sushi, the overall experience felt really incredible.  The second time I went was late in the afternoon on a Saturday.  We may have been the only ones in the restaurant and there was no music.  The sushi was good, once again, but that's it - just good.  We still enjoyed the atmosphere and the service was quick and friendly, but I just wasn't blown away like I thought I was the first time.  Also, the way they cut our rolls, the pieces were too thick.  So, I've had better sushi, but it's a fun place to come to - especially if you can make it here while the music is playing.\\n\\nMy favorite - California Roll: $5.50"},{"name":"Lure","address":"1106 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Went in for brunch today. Sat on their patio which is covered and absolutely perfect, I bet it's great at night. We were greeted by a manager at the door who sat us. Our server came quickly and went over some popular menu items. We started off with the yellowfin tuna poke. It came out with rice crackers. The tuna was nice and fresh and the poke sauce it was dressed in was really good. It was served with some rice crackers which were light and airy. I think I would have preferred a classic wonton chip, but the rice cracker was decent. We got the house made Hawaiian rolls to hold us while we decided on main courses. They came out immediately and the waitress said they had just been baked. There was 4 to an order served with a dish of butter. Maybe it's just me, but these seemed a little bit dry especially for just having been baked. There also wasn't nearly enough butter for the amount of bread. For brunch we did steak & eggs with marinated peppers and kale chimichurri sauce, my friend did the scallops with pancakes with pecans and nutmeg ricotta. They took a while to come out. The waitress had explained to me that due to the cut of steak it was going to be almost impossible to get a rare or medium rare cook on it. I told her as rare as possible. When it came up, upon my observation it was definitely a true medium. It was still nice and tender but lacked any extra seasoning. The chimichurri was a nice concept and although the kale brought a brightness to the sauce, I think it needed a little bit more of a kick, or spice which is what a lot of people look for in a chimichurri. The peppers didn't do much for the dish one way or the other. The eggs- over easy were cooked perfectly. My friend scallops were nice and tender, again not much seasoning on those. The quality of the actual scallop was amazing, it had that natural sweetness! The pancakes were easily the best thing on the table. They tasted like diabetes and cinnamon. Yassss! The ricotta was a nice touch as well as the pecans. My friend was not wanted to share with me. We were hoping to stay to do a punch bowl at 12:30 but we had finished food and also there was an abundance of flies on the patio! I think maybe brunch as a concept is a hit or miss here. But that wouldn't shy me away from stopping by for dinner. Service was decent- quick, knowledgable and to the point but also not anything to write home about.\\nI will be back again but not for brunch!

It's beef, it's bound to have gristle in it and I guess I can't be too critical of that, but the first bite I took was so full of fatty tissue I had to spit probably three quarters of it out.

We had a really cool and helpful waiter helping us (he works on Tuesday nights, give this man a raise) with  any questions on the menu, and he even gave us his valuable opinion. There is a wide selection of broths that you can choose from, but we picked the kimchi. Not a big deal, but it kind of annoyed me that certain broths cost extra while others didn't. Give it a rest man, it kind of seems like an excuse to fatten a bill if you ask me, but I digress...\\nThe menu selection was decent, but I have seen better. Compared to places like hot pot buffet (in Chinatown) and shabu zen (in Allston) this place has the smallest menu of the bunch. However, the quality of the meat/seafood/etc. was greater than hot pot buffets, so that's a plus. The dipping sauce wasn't very enjoyable to tell you the truth, seemed to lack a real taste that could enhance the meat. You had to douse whatever you were eating in the sauce. Finally, the ice cream comes with the buffet which was a pleasant surprise considering the fact that we didn't expect it. The bill ended up being $40 or so, a bit pricey due to the fact that other restaurants [like hot pot buffet] offer more for a cheaper price.

The duck leg tasted ok too.  \\n\\nThe dessert:  warm milk cake and apple cheesecake both deserve 4 stars.  Very fresh!\\n\\nOverall the restaurant is just ok because of the food.

We tried to go years ago to see music as part of the NW Music Festival, but they wouldn't let us in with our bike bags, so we never went back until last night.  We went last night to see Booker T Jones and Charlie Hunter, which was part of the Sould Out festival. \\n\\nThe time was wrong on the internet and the posters, so we ended up getting there two hours early, instead of the one hour we thought we'd need to score a table. They were aware of the misprint, a number of us were filling the tables on the side of the bar that was open, waiting. They didn't make an effort to accommodate any of us, even though the friend who I was with who'd arrived even earlier was told that we'd be able to just go into the adjacent room (which was cordoned off) via the inside instead of waiting in line.\\n\\nThere was a \\"helpful\\" employee who told us they'd have to clear the room at 6 pm, when the doors opened and kept giving us reminders but never told us that the line was stacking up outside while we waited inside. Luckily, my other friend thought of that and went outside to hold a spot.\\n\\nWhen we finally got inside, there were some tables left, but they were all reserved. Lame! So, this is my fault, for going out to a crowded bar with a possible fractured rib, but I really needed a seat where I wouldn't get jostled, and I did go early trying to ensure that.  In the end, we made our own space with leftover chairs in the corner that worked out fairly well.\\n\\nLots of things, besides their service, are broken, like the door hanging off the stall in the women's bathroom and the TV screen that showed an extremely poor image of the stage. The reserved tables were set up completely wrong being behind a big area in front of the stage for standing or dancing.\\n\\nOf course, the show started almost a half hour late and the room capacity appeared to be exceeded. They probably can argue that because they have the wall-separated bar next door to give them the extra capacity.\\n\\nI give this two stars because, although rather ineffectual, the staff is pretty friendly and the price for the show was right. It'll be a long time before I go back, and I'm sure no one at Dante's will really miss me."},{"name":"Tasca Restaurant","address":"1612 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"I've had great previous experiences at this restaurant, but my last visit was only middle of the road.  The first time I came it was for tapas and it was fantastic.  The second was for New Year's Eve; they had a special prix fixe menu and it was a nice way to start out the evening.  This time, my husband and I came here on a whim on a Saturday night.  We arrived around 8:00 PM and I was expecting a long wait (we've tried to dine here a couple other times before and the wait was so long we ended up next door at Bamboo Thai - which is a pretty good fallback).  Somehow we got lucky and were seated in about 10 minutes.  In that time we were able to get a quick drink at the 8-seat bar.  We were looking for a couple glasses of cava but they only had it by the bottle (in fact, they had no sparkling wine by the glass), so we ordered a couple glasses of Spanish white wine instead.\\n\\nI love tapas and usually there are so many delicious looking items on the menu I can barely choose and end up ordering way more than necessary.  This time, the menu didn't appeal to me and I had to struggle to find plates that I thought looked enticing.  Our first round of tapas consisted of fish tacos and chorizo in puff pastry.  The fish tacos were a single taco, which made sharing difficult.  The cod in the fish taco was light and crispy, but the garlic aioli was a bit overdone - between that and cutting a taco in half, it was kind of a sloppy mess.  The chorizo was advertised to come with a whole grain mustard, but this was missing when the plate was delivered to our table.  We had a bite but it was pretty bland so we tried to flag our waitress down while our food got cold.  When we finally got her attention she said that the mustard is inside the pastry, and \\"everyone asks that.\\"  So, needless to say we were not impressed.\\n\\nThe tortilla espanola was mostly potatoes and had an odd fishy taste - we barely touched it.  It came at the same time as the patatas bravas, which we devoured - always my favorite.  We also had the jamon and manchego (nothing special) and Mediterranean flatbread (just okay).  The meatballs came out last, which were in a thick peppercorn sauce - not my favorite.\\n\\nA few good points.  I love the ambiance of this place.  Its a bit tight, but its like being transported to Spain.  They have tons of Spanish wines and sangria.  I also think its priced right - most of the tapas are $5-6 each; I've been places where the small plates are in the $8-$12 range, and it adds up quickly.  With all that we ate we racked up only about $50 worth of food charges (not including wine).  So its a good deal and is a fun, romantic, \\"let's mix it up\\" kind of place.  As for the food quality, it started out awesome but has become a bit lackluster.

It's fine if you don't want to serve breakfast until a different time...but take the sign down that says otherwise!\\n\\nFurther, I have reported this location several times to SnS corporate for the above, but also for a practice of making you pull to the front of the building to wait for your drive through order.   This may not sound like a big deal, until you realize that there is no designated waiting location, so your choices are to either park in a through way of the parking lot (cutting half of it off) or find a spot somewhere in the lot.  I have tried both.  One time my car almost got hit.  The other way I watched the female attendant walk around a somewhat dark parking lot looking for my car (when I saw her I pulled out of my spot and up to her). This is far from an ideal situation for all involved.  \\n\\nThe food is OK. I've had tenders that tasted like the oil was a week old, but that was only once.  Standard steak and shake.

So there's a good start.\\nSecondly how can you not love that huge tree out front with Christmas lights adorning the winding branches. Love!\\nNext-ambiance inside: busy (duh), lively, attentive service at the bar for the most part. Def need more glasses, I heard them run out a few times before they could reset the table and seat people.\\nI am forgiving to kinks when a new restaurant opens--no biggie, let's talk about food.\\nWe let the waitress pick for us because we are adventurous (my gf and I who both love just about everything) She went super cheesy on us. Caroline was her name and she was cool and good! 4 Cheese pizza was just that, but did love the brick oven crust, not over cooked or too crispy but not too thick either-perfection!\\nI got the arugula salad, my friend the Gorgonzola. For me perhaps a little too overdressed, but did I eat every last bit-Yep!\\nWe also shared the pasta, cannot remember the name, but it was the one with a Gorgonzola cream sauce and sausage (super low calorie) that was sarcasm. Regardless, ambiance was cool, cozy and quaint, loved the decor, the intimate setting, high top tables and the tiling in the women's bathroom (those old school octagonal shaped tiles) my fav. (All in the details right?) everything tasted right and let's just say we didn't have a drop on our plate. Did I feel disgustingly full afterward?--yes.

Last night we had some sort of meringue with mushroom sauce inside, a fresh heirloom tomato salad, outstanding gazpacho, the best pheasant I've ever had, and an ice cream desert with nectarines and ground cherries; while none of this sounds amazing the way I describe it, we walked away full and happy.  We also had cocktails, which were good, but not necessarily as memorable as the food.  \\n\\nThe only other restaurant in Portland that compares to Racion is Roe, which is very good company to be in.

Since tofu was actually cheaper they didnt even charge me for the substitution, which I was willing to pay for. I got the half & half hot pot ( in my opinion, A MUST! but the spicy is far superior) with lamb and of course it came with various veggies, tofu, mushrooms, and noodles.

I was full half way in and could have easily stopped but I wasn't about to leave any meat or tofu behind.\\n\\nMy one issue was that they did seem a little disorganized with bringing out the right food, though it could have been because of my substitution requests. I had to ask for the veggies because they never came out, and one kind of mushroom and the bok choy was no where to be seen. Also, even though I asked for none of the stuff containing fish there were fish balls on the plate. I know what they look like so I avoided them but for someone with an allergy this could be problematic. Again chalking this up to me changing a bunch of stuff. \\n\\nI was expecting this place to sooth my craving but I never thought it would be as good as the other locations, but it was. The price was excellent and it was more than enough food. I did think it a bit weird when she asked if I wanted a to go container when all I had left was a few shreds of cabbage in the broths. Again, must be catering to us Americans."},{"name":"Musashino Sushi Dokoro","address":"2905 San Gabriel St, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Musashino may be the best sushi restaurant in Austin as well as one of the few true Japanese restaurants.

We had a very understanding conversation and he was extremly apologetic and may I add very professional . He immediately offered to make things right for ruining our anniversary date. Not only did he give me a refund he was able to convince me to come back and try them again (sending me a $200 gift card) \\n\\nTonight we decided to go back and we took family with us. Rick had asked me to let them know that I was his guest, however I decided not to do that and instead proceeded with my own reservation. \\n\\nWow! What a difference. The service was outstanding and the food was absolutely delicious!\\nEverything came out nice and hot, the steaks were cooked to perfection and dessert was impressive with a perfect cappuccino! Ahhhhh so happy! \\n\\nWe also had the pleasure of meeting Rick who deserves big props for knowing exactly how to make things right for a customer. Well done and very impressive. Thank you!\\n\\n\\n\\"Unapologetic Review\\" (below)\\n\\nLet me just say that I had the absolute worst experience last night at our anniversary dinner...\\n\\nNext: I don't think my a$$ had hit the chair yet before our HYPED UP waiter came rushing over to hand us menus. He literally lingered around the table while we reviewed the menu waiting for us to place an order. (Rushing rushing) We finally decide on some appetizers and all I kept hearing was his very poor up-selling. It was just a coincidence that all of his favorite items were the most expensive items on the menu. Mind you last night they were offering the regular menu and a Magical dining menu (which he never offered us) he convinces hub that the Porterhouse is the way to go and we continue to place our dinner order.\\n\\nNext: drinks and apps. I will say, the shrimp cocktail was very good and Hub enjoyed his tomato soup! The bread was yummy, however the server kept forgetting lemon in my Diet Coke which annoys me to no end.\\n\\nNext: dinner \\nMy steak is completely raw in the middle ( I ordered medium) Hub's steak is like a leather shoe sole completely burnt, dry and chewy. (He ordered well)\\nLobster mac n cheese is cold, mashed potatoes were cold. Of course everything has to go back, and the waiter seems annoyed so he sends the floor manager over. manager apologizes and starts jumping to get things rectified.. \\n\\nNext: my steak comes back first (same steak) they cooked it some more. I accepted it because I was starving. Lobster man n cheese comes back piping hot! 15 minutes later Hub's steak comes back out cooked properly and by then I was almost done eating. (Very upsetting that we could not enjoy this meal together) once the food came back out our HYPED UP waiter seemed to not care about refills or anything else for that matter.\\n\\nNext: Hub ate a little bit and decided to have the rest packed to go. ( his steak, mashed potatoes and my lobster mac n cheese) the waiter took the food and said he would box it.\\n\\nThe floor manager returned to our table to apologize again and to tell us that he would be taking Hub's steak off the bill and sending over desserts on the house. Of course Hub tried to refuse this offer, but I had no problem saying thank you and accepting it! I am in this business and when you screw up, you make it right!\\n\\nNext: dessert, Hub orders coffee and I order cappuccino. Desserts come out ( they were good, nothing to write home about ) coffee is good and my cappuccino is sitting on a coaster that for sure came out of the freezer. COLD CAPPUCCINO he brought me! Hub is now laughing uncontrollably and I am to the point where If i don't get out of there I'm going to go off on this manager. \\n\\nNext: Check comes out with the boxed food. We pay and go. At this point I am in total disgust. To make matters worse it was raining and the valet was one big disorganization. \\n\\nNext: home and I notice there were only two boxes packed which I found weird because we had 4 items to go.I open the first box and I could not believe what I saw! waiter had thrown Hub's steak in the box along with the mashed potatoes and lobster mac n cheese! (See photo)\\n\\nI have NEVER EVER been though an experience like this EVER! I am appalled! I have worked way to hard in my life catering to customers, going above and beyond, taking pride in our food and service.

She agreed. When we came back, she lied and said that she had texted me already, and so we had lost our table. I was confused at the time and thought that she must have heard the wrong phone number, so we waited to be seated at another table. \\n\\nLater, I realized that she had lied to me, because the restaurant texted me when we left, asking for my feedback! Clearly they had my phone number all along but when I came back, they lied and made us wait longer. Tip for the hostess: just tell me that my table is not yet ready. Don't tell us that you texted, when the truth is that you just forgot about us.\\n\\nNext, our waiter didn't write down our order correctly. We got the Tuna Pok√© appetizer and two orders of Portobello Quinoa, one without cheese. It came with cheese and so we had to wait some more for them to re-make the dish, but luckily our waiter caught the mistake. Sadly, the rest of us had finished most of our meals by the time the re-made dish was brought out. Another tip: give the customer a little something (like extra bread or a free drink maybe) to make up for the wait.\\n\\nOnce everything was settled and we were able to eat the food, we had a good time. the pok√© was good, but the quinoa dish was even better. It was oven roasted portobello mushrooms with quinoa and crispy fried onions."},{"name":"K-Bop","address":"2002 Guadalupe St, Ste B","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Stopped by for some warm dinner with the roomies on a weekend evening. It's a literal mom-and-pop shop and legit Korean with barely enough room for larger groups, but it feels homey.\\n\\nThe main reason I give it an average star rating is because of my being spoiled with Korean food in California. I went with the rice cake soup dduk buki which was a little too sweet for me, but I originally wanted the tofu jjigae (soup. Jjigae was sold out when we ordered, and dduk buki was not shabby. I think their rice cakes were made perfectly! I loved that part for sure. The taro milk tea with boba/pearls was just alright. I wouldn't come here for the boba, as the taro tasted powdered and still too sweet for me when I ordered 0% sweetness. HOWEVER, the noodles and rice cakes are cooked so yummily. I also think they were shortstaffed because we waited in line for 15-20 mins while the staff was trying to catch up with the orders and pumping out food/drinks. We thought this would be a faster option, but it ended up taking longer than expected. That's alright, we weren't in any rush :)\\n\\nParking is not fun around this area, so that was a big bummer already when we were driving around hangry. Luckily, we found street parking above two blocks down. We love how there are napkins and ice water at every table, but again...space is limited inside, so I would refrain from coming here in large parties.

Everybody loves a good comeback story. \\n\\nWe had Shabu & Mein for our rehearsal dinner. It was about a group of about 35 people. We opted to do the Hot Pot meals for our guests and it was fabulous. \\nWe were planning our wedding from out of town so we didn't get the chance to actually taste the food until a few days prior. I was a little worried because the manager Steve was a little slow to respond to my emails on occasion (although in fairness we planned this dinner in about 2-3 weeks so I was pretty anxious to get things going). \\n\\nWhen we did arrive in Boston, we went on a covert mission to see what the restaurant was like on a regular day without getting any special treatment because we would be dropping some cash for a large group. \\nOur waiter for lunch was a little abrupt and occasionally jarring--taking things out of our way before we were quite ready or interrupting the flow of conversation to ask us something--although it seemed more because the server was nervous rather than trying to be rude. \\n\\nThe food was great! I had ramen and it was quite filling and tasted pretty darn good. Their appetizers are also not to be missed. At this point, we asked to speak to Steve so we could talk about the rehearsal dinner details. \\n\\nI know my review so far doesn't seem like it merit 5 stars, but here is where Shabu & Mein really is worth their weight in gold: They were incredibly accommodating and the hot pot at their restaurant is fabulous. \\nMy husband and I decided we wanted our family and friends to be able to sample A5 Wagyu (the closest you can get to Kobe beef outside of Japan) with our meal. Steve offered us variable portioning options because that stuff ain't cheap. We also decided to do a consumption bar and Steve offered to change the portioning of their cocktails so we could afford to offer it to our guests as part of the drink options (along with beer and wine). And their cocktails were delicious. I've never been to another restaurant that was willing to adjust portioning to make it more convenient for you. That in and of itself deserves 5 stars. \\n\\nSo fast-forward to the night of the actual rehearsal dinner and we could not be more pleased. We had seafood, vegetables, chicken, and beef along with some appetizers. There was so much delicious food. Our guests were blown away. Hot pot is also a very interactive way to eat, so our family and friends that had never met each other were able to have a good time and actually have something to talk about other than the weather. The manager on staff that night was incredibly attentive, especially for the guests that we informed him had special eating requirements (e.g. vegetarian, halal, paleo). The servers were pleasant and helpful. The food was fresh (which is always a concern with hot pot) and delicious. Both broths we were served were delicious in their own right. I should also point our their decor is fresh and relaxing. \\n\\nI cannot emphasize enough what a great time we had eating delicious food at Shabu & Mein.

Everyone gave it raving reviews, so I was pumped and even MORE pumped to see that I could order on-line. So I did. I wanted a burrito and some chips. It came out to about $9 which is a little pricey but I figured I'd give it a shot. I paid on-line, or so I thought.\\n\\nI get there and the place is a mob scene but I had ordered ahead and the confirmation e-mail told me to go directly to the register, therefore bypassing the line of 30ish people. Very pleasing. I go to the register and the girl there tells me to go to the other corner, so I fought through the mob of hungry, anxious humans and a girl asked me my name, vanished for a while and about 10 minutes later came back asking for $9. I told her I already paid, even showed her the e-mail on my phone but she said something weird about it not going through.

The places feel the same along with the same type of burgers. There is no Longhorn Special at Dan's but there is a double cheeseburger. In addition Dan's benefits from getting various sizes of their burgers which other burger places do not. I do not mean adding another meat patty to the burger but the size of the patty and bread. I do enjoy their hickory burger and cheeseburger. You can get it all the way with the veggies and fixings or customize it. Unlike Top Notch there is no car hop or even a drive through. This is a old place still keeping the vibe as it has had without changing anything. In respect to restaurants changes are not welcomed because it should taste the same since it was first opened. You will have to wait for your food so don't expect fast food service. There are many other menu options than burgers such as chicken sandwiches and other dinners but the burgers are the reason to go. If your can enjoy a fried curly fries then go for it.

Afterwards was the lamb, which was quite fatty but rubbery, although the flavor itself was not necessarily horrible (it had a lot of cumin, which is to be expected from the title). Even though the pork soup dumplings were supposed to be an appetizer, they came LAST and they were very disappointing... the skin of the dumpling was too thick and there was almost no soup. The quality of food itself would not merit a one-star review, but alas, after eating here, my dad got sick (he thinks it was the lamb...).

We ordered pulled pork, brisket and burnt ends. We got mac and cheese and the house salad as a side. We also got an order of biscuits and hush puppies.\\n The biscuits and hush puppies came out first (after our drink order of course) the biscuits are HUGE and are filled with buttery goodness. The honey butter is a wonderful and addictive addition to the already mouthwatering biscuits.\\n Now for the hush puppies. I am a sucker for a good hush puppy, and there are down right dangerous. Crispy outside,warm and just sweet enough. Oh, but in walks the sweet dipping sauce to make it even better! Needless to say,those didn't last long either.\\n Our main trays came out,and were packed with life giving BBQ goodness. The pulled pork came out in a nice pile, slow cooked perfectly and is super tender.\\n The burnt ends were so juicy and tender. I was worried they'd be dried out, but I was pleasantly surprised. \\n Now onto my favorite thing ever, brisket. It was so tender and juicy and just fell apart with my fork. This was just as great as brisket I had at my wedding, that was smoked for 2 days just for our event. This brought me right back there.\\n The mac n cheese was so cheesy and has a really great cracker crumble on top, that mixed up so well with the nicely cooked noodles abd ooey gooey cheesey goodness \\n Only two things just left me going \\"meh\\". There were onions and pickles served on the tray,and I was sad to find out they had bread and butter pickles and not dill.\\n Also, the house salad was nothing that blew me away. It was just a basic salad with a ton of things in it to me. \\n But other than that, everyone was blown away by the amazing flavors that we got from this BBQ joint.

I went with a couple of friends and between the three of us we got 4 different kinds of tapas, just to try out.  The couscous one was a bit too sour for me, maybe they just put more of the sour sauce stuff( or whatever it was) in mine, but it had so much potential to taste delicious w/out it.  I also got the meatballs, which I wish were more tender.  The grilled brie, however, was AMAZING, it just melts in your mouth!! My friend had the \\"salmon ahumado\\" which was tasty as well.  They also give you bread with really delicous hummus. The sangrias were okay, but not the best ones I've ever had.  \\n\\nThe other downfall is that the restaurant was sooo busy when we came (Saturday night), and it's not very big (at all) so I felt a little claustrophobic waiting for our table amongst a crowd of hungry people. \\n\\nThey restaurant provides valet parking which is convenient since there's really no place to park on Comm Ave in Brighton.

We ordered the Tuna Poke, Steak and Yakuza burger. It was all exceptionally excellent! \\n\\nThe reason for 3 stars is that we spent 90 dollars and 90 minutes for the privilege of eating this excellent food. After waiting 20 minutes with no food we noticed the people next to us at the bar had several plates of their food even though they had come in about 10 minutes after we ordered. Meanwhile we were sitting there getting hungrier. After almost 30 minutes we finally got our first small plate of Tuna Poke! Excellent!  As we sat there still hungry waiting for our main food to arrive the people who came in later got more plates and started finishing them. I asked our server why others who came later got food first and she said it was because we ordered steak and burger and those take longer but it should be up soon. The steak came in about 45 minutes after the order and the burger finally arrived at almost an hour. The food was all really good! Unfortunately the experience of waiting a long time while our stomachs were growling and watching people on both sides of us that came later eating before us kind of tempered the experience. \\n\\nWe could have just had the bad luck of arriving when it was busy. It would have felt better if someone had at least warned us that these foods usually take longer before ordering or at least a simple 'sorry your food took so long' would have made it feel better.\\n\\nI also understand why people on this this thread are complaining about the 5% charge for employee benefits. It's great they want to give employees health insurance, I would do the same if I had a business.

(for now)\\n\\nI had high hopes for this joint as the newest entry from Fifth Group, the same company that brought us the stellar Ecco and Atlanta mainstay South City Kitchen. At Lure, some of it worked, and some didn't. Overall the restaurant still has some work to do to iron out the kinks.\\n\\nThe good:\\n\\n- The setting is stunning, IMHO. (Not all my co-diners agreed with that assessment.) With Asian-inspired touches, unique woods and nice lighting, the designers hit the right contemporary notes, in the zone of its urban location. You'd never, EVER recognize the previous, very sleepy Vickery's restaurant, which to some I guess is a good thing.\\n\\n- We love this joint being right dead-smack in the middle of the city. More of that, please. In the same spirit of Ecco, the company has transformed a dilapidated space into a stunning marker for foodies of many stripes.\\n\\n- My father had the pan-fried sole filets and I agree with him that it's some of the best I've ever tasted. This dish embodies the exceptionalism that this restaurant - the whole company, I'd say - aspires to in that it was so spot-on that it could single-handedly bring me back for another visit.\\n\\n- Kudos to the restaurant for its commitment to fresh, in-season food. They make a statement on their website that some of the dishes may not be available, which is a small disclaimer I appreciate.\\n\\nThe un-good:\\n\\n- The menu is a mess and is not an answer of the \\"Who am I?\\" question this place needs. I didn't want such a limited menu for sharing with this type of cuisine. I don't mind sharing plates overall, but give people more choices for what should be the real star of the show - fish. If you want to be an oyster house, great, do that. But if you want to be a serious fish house, this menu ain't it. I want to know what focus the chefs want on what particular dishes, and I want them to stand out in the entree well of the menu.\\n\\n- The herb lettuce salad, for $8, was a just a small mess of mint and other unintelligible ingredients. The serving needs to be bigger and the dish itself is a nice idea, but it stayed just that - poorly executed, and nothing for what we ordered. It was billed by our server as good for sharing, but it's not good for that at all. Like the restaurant, this is a germ of an idea that should be further developed.\\n\\n- The fried rhode island calamari & ipswich clams came to our table, oddly, as two different types of calamari. The breading was good, but the server told us that we had clams when we didn't. The house manager - an oddly frumpy guy wearing a stained, untucked shirt - came over and brought us a full plate of fried clams, which was a nice make-good. He was very pleasant. I don't eat any of that crap, but I did appreciate the flavor of the shallots, which brought a brightness to that dish that made me intrigued to nibble around the gross stuff that - in general, not just at this place - tastes to me like cooked eyeballs.\\n\\n- We were pushed on the restaurant's expensive \\"beverage program.\\" This was part of an overall big push to imbibe, which I understand is a cash cow, but still... Bacchanalia offers diners a setting-appropriate \\"beverage journal\\" (see my review) and I can only guess they were trying to go down that road. This is a pretentious idea and is not complemented by a first-class menu, which made the incessant requests by our server for another cocktail all the more irritating. Speaking of service...\\n\\n- Our server was not ready for Prime Time. I saw her kick the kitchen door open at one point. She had terrible table-side manners and just in general was more suited as a food runner than a main server. She would stay at our table for a brief second and she was off like a flash. Also, I sensed the same crazed, gang-land service I did at the ill-fated Craft Atlanta (see my review) that was a rather bizarre confluence of like six or seven different people - none of whom we connected with during our meal. Carissa A.'s point about coming in for lite bites and drinks is puzzling here, too, given the approach with the menu.\\n\\n- On a Monday evening, the music was blaring like it was the weekend. To their credit, they turned it down a lot - but I'm not really feeling the deep-house beat on that day of the week. \\n\\nI went into great detail here because this place has a lot of promise. But it felt a bit like we were still in a soft-open and not enjoying a fully formed concept. Overall: 2.5 stars. I make these suggestions so that the place can get better - and I'll update if and when I go back.

This place has a very American 1970's style Chinese restaurant on the 1st floor, and a very gritty dance floor on the 3rd floor. This place did not bring back any great memories of the Hong Kong nightlife in Lan Kwai Fong but I had a fun time with some friends despite the strange environment.\\n\\nA few friends and I went up the stairs, and into a dance floor. Fortunately, there is no cover charge. The music was really loud, when we left the dance floor, my ears felt like they lost some hearing. The bar was really small, it's just a window where you can order drinks. The bartender makes the drinks in a small room. There's very limited counter space if you want to put your drinks down and do some dancing or if you are really crazy, do strange stuff. \\n\\nI remember my friends and I got a couple of Scorpion Bowls, which is this pink colored, juicy alcoholic drink served in a large bowl filled with ice. They were cool and sort of refreshing, tasted a little like grapefruit juice, and they were not too strong. We also had some drink shots of Tequila, and one of my friends felt really funny after drinking all that. I also started to feel some intoxication as well. It also lead to food cravings as well. \\n\\nFor some strange reason, I actually found the food here really tasty. I guess after you drink a lot of alcohol, you actually find some of the most mediocre food to be tasty. The good thing is that the actual restaurant is open really late, and a lot of people from the dance floor actually eat the food. We got a couple of noodle dishes. We ordered Gon Chao Ngau Ho, which is usually known as the Fried Beef Chow Foon. We also decided to get the Mandarin Chow Mein, or Mandarin Fried Noodles, which are these fried noodles mixed with shrimp and vegetables. The Gon Chao Ngau Ho was good, but needed some more flavor. The Fried Noodles were actually tasty and the sauce made the fried noodles tastier. The noodles also came in fast. If I went here without any alcohol in my body, I think the food would have just been mediocre, and if I was originally from Toronto, New York, or San Francisco, I may have thought that the food would be below average. \\n\\nOverall, this is not a bad choice if you are looking for one of the strangest places in Harvard Square for some fun. It's also not a bad choice to get some decent, but really mediocre Chinese food. If someone asked me where they can get a Scorpion Bowl in Cambridge, I probably would direct them to this place."},{"name":"Circosta's","address":"2960 W State Rd 426","city":"Oviedo","stars":"4.5","text":"Great Family Italian place in Central, FL.

The spread they put out for evening was very impressive. We nibbled on different cheeses and crackers, sausage, a variety of bruschettas (one with olive tapenade, one with red peppers, etc.), two types of baked brie with berries or brown sugar and walnuts, smoked salmon flatbreads, mushroom flatbreads, shrimp grilled on sprigs of rosemary, and for dessert: slices of pound cake with berries and chocolates with bursts of alcohol in their centers.

But after waiting an additional 20 minutes, he comes up to me and I ask him what is going on. He says he was waiting for my other guests to arrive to bring the bottle.  I was so annoyed at that point. I just tell him to bring me my bottle, and they finally did. 30 minutes for a drink is just unacceptable. They weren't even busy!\\nAnother problem is the damn bathrooms. It's like a house of mirrors in there, it's an adventure to try and get out from there.  \\nBut what really ended up ruining the night was the DJ.  Music was absolutely terrible. Out of all the songs played I'd say about only 3 were good. He must also think he's Tiesto or someone important. I went up to him to request a song for my friends birthday and I call him, he looks at me then looks away, I call him again and ask him if he's ignoring me. He puts up his pointer finger to tell me to wait a min. Then some dude comes up to me and tells me no requests. Like really? Are you really that self-righteous that you couldn't pull away from your terrible dj-ing skills to tell me urself no requests?\\nNo wonder why it was so dead on a Saturday night.

We chose the spring mix salad and the tomato bisque. The salad was great and the bisque was more tart than creamy. We opted for the crab cakes and the filet for our mains. While the crab cakes and filet were good there was nothing spectacular about them. They were cooked right but again no amazing seasoning nor a great presentation. The true let downs were the sides that came with them. The vegetables were steamed, undercooked, and had no flavor. The mashed potatoes were dry, lukewarm, no sauces, and also lacked flavor. No one at our table of 4 finished them. As for dessert, we got the cheesecake and bread pudding. The cheesecake was whipped and had a nutty basil tasting crust. In terms of preference, I prefer a ny baked style so was extremely let down, but then again, no one at our table liked the cheesecake either. Avoid! The bread pudding was the highlight and had great flavor.

That said, I'll keep my comments to quality of food and drink.  We started with the Setas Ronan, a portabello mushroom-based dish with manchego and roasted red pepper-rubbed bread -- it basically turned out to be your run-of-the-mill, boring, balsamic-dressed salad.  We then ordered our main meals off the prix fixe restaurant week menu - I got a bowl of lobster bisque, a pasta dish, and bread pudding.  The bisque was creamy and rich in flavor, and the bread pudding was quite delicious (though both had obviously sat under a heating lamp for far too long).  The pasta dish (with mushrooms, manchego, mint and asparagus) was incredibly boring.  I honestly could have made much better at home with minimal effort (and I'm not a refined chef by any stretch).  My friend's tuna tartare app with sesame was tasty, but not at all Spanish-inspired.  His hake dish was fishy-tasting, yet bland.  The chocolate truffles he had for dessert, however, were delicious.  Another bonus: our sangria was yummy and a great value at $19(!!!) for a generous pitcher.\\n\\nOverall, the whole meal was a mixture of ups and downs.  I would come back here when they're a little less busy and try ordering tapas that are more adventurous and in keeping with the Spanish tradition.

A lot of them get it right, and a few of them get it wrong.  Then there are some that are just so-so, good for one thing but not the other.  That is the category Green Dragon falls into.\\n\\nFirst of all, let's be positive.  This is a great SE warehouse building that has a fantastic 50 plus beer tap list, and that is always awesome.  Plenty of rotating taps, and a well rounded variety with lots of IPA options. I had the chance to try some Imperial IPA's which were excellent.  At $5.50 for most pints, 10oz, etc. it adds up pretty quickly.  A little overpriced in that regard, but not dissimilar from other pubs of its kind in the area.  Service is also attentive and very warm overall.  We had a group of 8 and were well tended to.  For just a beer I wouldn't mind coming back here sometime.  For everything else, no way.\\n\\nThe menu is the real letdown here.  In a city like ours, and especially in SE your menu better have some good veggie options on it.  Very disappointing here.  Just a few salads and the ubiquitous veggie burger, which here is just a portobello mushroom sandwich.  They could easily have a black bean and rice bowls and grilled veggies and pico de gallo or something more substantial than salad for $9.  Regardless, the group was just okay with the food, and all but myself eat meat.  Nothing special was the consensus.  $12 for a burger with fries......not impressive.  I can get the same thing in the Pearl District for $9.  Also charging $6 for a small plate of fries is just plain silly.\\n\\nOther place it loses a star from me is the restrooms.  On a Wednesday evening when it isn't crowded, there's no excuse for having unclean facilities and paper all over the floor. The amount of grafitti on the walls and the maintenance that is way overdue is terrible.

I was excited to try the tacos, but alas, on Sundays, they only do the brunch menu, nary a taco to be seen.  It was pretty ordinary fare, there was plenty of it, but mostly, it's filler for what seems to be the main attraction, which to see and be seen downtown with all-you-can-drink in hand.  Plenty of TVs over the bar if football is your game.  Awkward service station in between half the dining room, the buffet, and the bathrooms.  If you want to avoid the dirty looks from servers, go around, not through.  There was a variety of foods on the buffet, enough to please most everyone you might bring.  The chafing dishes (in general) don't do much for food texture, but things are hot.  Best for me was the Cuban Sandwich (maybe was an eighth off a long roll) which had the requisite flavors (me personally, I like more of a schmear of yellow mustard), Truffle Oil Tater Tots (get it with the Garlic Aioli), Jalapeno Bacon (deep-fried tangles with caramelized jalapeno slices).  Chicken Wings were seasoned well, but fried hard and a touch dry after some time on the buffet line.  Cheesy Scrambled Eggs were solid, as in a mass, but you could doctor them up with fresh pico de gallo, sour cream, or additional shredded cheddar.  I was looking forward to the Yucca Fries (as the name plate indicated), but none were to be found.  Pretty much people picked around what they wanted out of the dish (such as all the shrimp in the pasta or all the flank steak out of the beans and rice and maduros dish).  It was advertised that there would be some sort of made-to-order station, and we were expecting omelets and such, but no, it was a coffee station.  Which is nice, I guess, but for brunch, I pretty much expect a bottomless cup of coffee brought to me no matter where, maybe I'm just an old person.   The French pressed coffee was delicious and thick and dark though.  For the bottomless mimosas, servers pour your champagne and then you go get your own assortment of juices to DIY.  Some people just drank straight up champagne.  I suppose if you're a heavy drinker or eater the $33 is worth the change, but I think they probably had plenty of margin on us.

My boyfriend took me there last night for my birthday dinner and it was everything I could have hoped for. Great ambiance, cool concept, and AMAZING food. \\n\\nWe started by splitting the wedge salad - definitely big enough for two to split. Fresh lettuce, bacon bits, and quite possibly the best blue cheese dressing I've had. We both ended up getting the beef tenderloin which is basically a 9 oz filet mignon. I had mine with the house rub and he had his with a blue cheese topping. The blue cheese topping is definitely large enough for 3-4 people to share, just FYI. Both options were great. Meat was tender, perfectly cooked, melt in your mouth. We got the baby smashed potatoes as a side which were also great. Sour cream and bacon in it, with a hint of mustard seeds? \\n\\nAll-in-all, a huge \\"bravo!\\" to Bogie's Place. Thank you for making my birthday dinner oh so wonderful.

(That's The Optimist). \\n\\nMy first visit was frustrating: we stopped in on a Thursday night, the entire patio was open save for one table and the inside was about 50% full. We were only a party of two, happy to sit at the bar, but the hostess told us it'd be a 45 minute wait. That drives me crazy. Also, the valet situation is bananas in that they have to drive around the block to deliver your car back to you and it leads to some serious back up: I can't imagine what a cluster it would be at peak times. \\n\\nSo a few Wednesdays later David K and I decided to pop in post-party and we were quickly seated in a lovely booth for two. It's really dark but the atmosphere is cozy: a nice break from the industrial chic look that's been so popular of late. Our server was friendly and quick: no concerns there as others have mentioned. \\n\\nThe cocktail list is well thought out and the only not-overpriced option on the menu, with specialty cocktails ringing in the $9-$11 range. Given my date for the evening and the gin base, I had to order the David's Girl and it was delicious and refreshing: perfect for a late summer evening. \\n\\nThe food was less impressive. We weren't especially famished, and given the prices, we stuck to just two small plates. Many of the small plate options were close to the $15 mark, which is a little over the top for me. Nearly twice the price of what you get at Ecco, and not nearly as filling or memorable. The waitress described both of our dishes as \\"life-changing,\\" and that they were not. The seared scallop crudo had a nice texture but the flavor was lacking, and the grouper fell in to the same category. Good food, but not great, and certainly not at this price. I wanted to try the octopus and pork lettuce wraps but at another $17 I just couldn't stomach it. \\n\\nEcco and The Optimist will keep my classy-night-at-the-bar business, but Lure could, um, lure me back (I can't help myself) if they edited their prices (or portion size) or if someone else was paying. Kind of a bummer as I've always viewed Fifth Group restaurants as being that perfect marriage between a fancy celebratory night out kind of place and a Tuesday night \\"just because\\" splurge.

Once, we waited 45 minutes, but we also arrived around 1 PM.  I called to make reservations and was even reminded to arrive on time.  We got to the restaurant just minutes before it opened and my friends joked about why we were the only ones there and one person wasn't even sure if he was in the right place because the lot was vacant.\\n\\nThe restaurant was clean and up to date.  There are some decorations along the walls but not too overwhelming.  The restaurant is divided into two rooms, one being the bar and buffet stations and the other being the dining room.\\n\\nWe were sat in the middle of the dining room and waited for the rest of our party to arrive.\\n\\nMost of us ordered a mango lassi drink made with mango juice and yogurt.  It was on the warmer side and I wished it would have been more cold and satisfying.  Luckily I stopped the server from adding grenadine, I wouldn't have liked it any sweeter than it already was.\\n\\nThe buffet started with the usual thin papdum flat breads and puri puffs.\\n\\nThere was a ceramic bowl filled with something I've never seen before, my friend thought it may be the same as the Gulab Jamun less the sweet syrup and not fried.\\n\\nThe raita and tamarind chutney was thinner than usual today and I wasn't too happy with it.\\n\\nI was really disappointed that chegodilu and idili appetizers were being offered today.  Where'e the vegetable pakoras aka deep fried spinach and onion rings???\\n\\nOnce I saw the buffet offerings, I felt a little guilty. This restaurant is popular with the local Indian families because of its authenticity and flavors.  Once we got to the buffet dishes, I was like...Oh boy.. there are no samosas, tandoori chicken, chicken tiki masala, what are they going to eat???!?  I came to the conclusion that the weekday buffets cater towards the corporate business parks nearby and the weekend buffets is different.\\n\\nWhat they did have was plenty regional dishes that caught my eye: fish curry, vegetable jalfrezi, stir fried bittermelon just to name a few.  For rice dishes, there were plain white basmatic rice, vegetable biryani and my favorite, goat biryani.  Of course, they had naan.\\n\\nAlthough the dishes were marked, it was inconvenient to look up, especially when I'm so excited to see food below.  My friend mistaken cheese curd and fish for chicken and felt bad that it went untouched on the plate.\\n\\nThere was a roasted/grilled chicken dish that was reminiscent of tandoori chicken sans the red food color. \\n\\nFor the Indo Chinese dish offering, there was Chili chicken, it was OK but I was really hoping for Gobi Manchurian.\\n\\n\\"Made to order\\" Dosas, (thin crepes with potato filling) was included with the buffet, we ordered one for everyone. For being the only table there, the dosas took forever! I usually start off my meal with dosas but I was enjoying if after my 1st plate.  \\n\\n\\nAfter 12 pm, other diners started coming in and the restaurant picked up.

Winter Wheat Mafalda, Short Rib Ragu, with Oyster Mushrooms & Kale and the Durum Spaghetti, 'Cacio e Pepe,' Challerhocker cheese. $18 & $16, kind of a steep price for a fairly small serving size-- its enough for just two fork fulls between two people. \\n\\nAs other reviews have mentioned the alcohol department is just plan highway robbery here.

Lure is all about seafood and they do it like none other. From it's wooden nautical d√©cor, Lure lets you know they're serious about seafood just coming in the building. Valet parking makes this Midtown restaurant worry-free and with validation it's just $4 to park.\\n\\nWe couldn't help but having a conversation on the d√©cor of the restaurant. The seating is very comfortable and the rich wood accents abound. This restaurant is a perfect example of upscale dining in a casual, comfortable setting. It's an open environment that is inviting and welcoming. Although we chose to be seated indoors, there is a large shaded outdoor seating area that would be awesome for an evening meal.\\n\\nOnce seated we were greeted by our server and he gave us the full treatment throughout the meal. One thing you will NOT feel at Lure is neglected! We soon had our drinks and were discussing the menu with our server who knew the answer to every question posed to him. Our table was seated right outside of the window to the kitchen and our readers know how much we like to see into the kitchen. Not only do we like to watch our food being prepared but we also like to view how the staff interacts with one another and view the teamwork that takes place.\\n\\nOne thing for readers to understand when fine dining in a restaurant such as Lure, is that you yield control over to the chef. This isn't a mid-grade restaurant - you're not choosing an entr√©e, adressing for your salad and two sides. You select a dish and it is accompanied by the selections chosen by the chef. If you want additional sides, they are also available. Usually they are large enough to share among the table. Another thing that our server pointed out, Lure chooses what to serve based on the availability of the seafood based on its peak season of flavor. As such, the menu changes based on the selections that are present as do the accompanying sides. All of this also takes into account the seasonal variations present within the menu as a whole. It's really an experience to be savored!\\n\\nI chose the Fried Louisiana Catfish while Melanie and Laurie selected the Seared Salmon. For some additional sides, we opted for the Confit Potatoes and the Vidalia Onion Hushpuppies. We began our meal with an appetizer and chose the Baked Crab Dip. Served with roasted tomatoes, chives and toast points it was still bubbling when it was delivered to our table.\\n\\nThe Baked Crab Dip was delicious! The chunks of crab were large and meaty and we really liked the roasted tomatoes with it that made it so seasonal. It was just a little watery and we would like to see this made with a cream sauce to help mask the water from the tomatoes.\\n\\nWhen our entr√©es arrived, I was stunned. The presentation was stunning, even Laurie made the comment it looked to good to eat. I couldn't wait to get my camera out to start snapping pictures. Okay, yes it looked phenomenal but you want to know how it tasted, right?\\n\\nThe Louisiana Fried Catfish was served on a bed of cucumber salad with the most finely sliced cucumbers I had ever seen. I mentioned this is Melanie and she said they were definitely done on a mandoline. Underneath this bed of cucumbers was hot sauce. On top of the fried catfish was cr√®me fraiche sprinkled with herb. At one point, I noticed the taste of mint in the herbs. This combination of flavors was dynamite and the hot sauce and cr√®me fraiche provided such a nice contrast while both combined to bring out the natural flavor of the fish.\\n\\nThe ladies were served Seared Salmon accompanied with a cauliflower puree and smoked mushrooms. The mushrooms had a strong smoky flavor that was at times almost overpowering for the ladies but I loved its boldness. I enjoyed their meatiness but Melanie thought they were a little chewy for her. Melanie loved the way the cauliflower puree acted as a sauce to make the entire meal come together.\\n\\nWhen dessert was offered we looked at one another in dismay. While we were full, everything had been so good we couldn't resist trying the dessert. The rest, as they say, is history.\\n\\nWe selected the Chocolate Mousse Cake and Homemade Ice Cream. This is a dessert you might regret until you taste it and then you'll know its worth it! The three of us shared the dessert and it was a delightful to end our meal.\\n\\nLure is the epitome of casual upscale dining. The food is out of this world and the service is exemplary. You cannot go wrong whether you are celebrating a special occasion, meeting friends after work or eating out with the family, Lure will show you a fantastic time.

This is a terrible place to spend your money or take anyone too. I stopped in because I was staying at the Double Tree next door. Nice easy walk over.

Imagine the regular order of fried veggies on the left side of the plate. In the middle covering both the vegetables and the meat in the middle. About, I would guess, 1/2 pound! Now for the steak and lobster....Imagine 4 quarters, maybe six, side by side. That is the size of the lobster. Now imagine 8 quarters side by side. That my friends is the steak. WHAT???? I thought the lobster was a small flat chicken breast. Seriously! The steak... quarter size...no joke! I said to the bartender, is this real? He said yes, the steak is small. I said how big is it supposed to be? He said oh, its 4 ounces. 4 OUNCES??? The lobster was probably 2!! Called the manager over, he brings menu and says you can order 8 ounce. I said that is not the menu I was given. He states that the bar gets a different menu and my meal is actually cheaper than the people that sit table side to watch. ARE YOU KIDDING???

I keep reading the praise given to this restaurant on the reviews given and I just shake my head and think (and know) that I could get way better Shanghainese food upstairs in the food court. This restaurant has been in this place for awhile, taking over from the old 'Pittsburgh' HK cafe spot, and popped up during the boom of Shanghainese restaurants opening left and right in the Lower Mainland and you would think by this time they would have figured it out and excelled at their craft, well think again.\\n\\nI have had both dinner, and now lunch at this place, and I can say that dinner was a tad better than the lunch was just had. Coming here in the morning, I was expecting what I consider 'comfort food' in my vocabulary, which would be this type of food. You may enjoy your pancakes and sausage links, or even dim sum, for me... Shanghainese morning food is the ultimate in terms of starting off a lazy day. Here's where the disappointment begins.... looking through the pretty pictured menu, I really had no real clue what to order on this day, and some things popped out.... deep fried glutinuous rice cake (Á≤¢È•≠ÔøΩ?, sticky rice roll (Á≤¢È•≠) and Shanghainese sticky rice wrap. All were glorious shown in the menu with colorful pictures of these three choices I picked, and when ordering each, having none was a shock.. so why put these things in big pictures in your big menu when I can't even order them, being shot down like that right in the morning.. first sitting, how do you run out of sticky rice, are you opening up a business, I can understand not having the deep fried glutinous rice cake and the Shanghainese sticky rice wrap, but not the sticky rice roll - this item is a staple of Shanghainese breakfast, practically like not having pancakes offered at a regular brunch/breakfast joint.... \\n\\nBeing already disappointed I continued to order for the family, hot sweet soy milk, and savoury soy milk, two orders of Chinese donut, pan fried rice cake, Shanghai wonton, XLB, Shanghai pan fried buns, and a mixed fried noodle dish. I can't say any were done quite well, the Chinese donut's were too doughy, the wontons were a little too big, the mixed noodles, and the pan fried rice cake were average (nothing special) and the savoury soy milk.. poor execution, throw in some cut up Chinese donuts, some dried little shrimp and that's about it... I don't get how hard this thing is to make, where's the chili oil, where's the pickled veggies, where's the one drop of vinegar to change this dish up? What a piss poor try to make a dish so easy, oh.... that's right, chili oil, when I asked for this, they did not have any??? How are you even a Chinese restaurant, no matter what type of Chinese cuisine you are... no chili oil, holy wow. The XLB, a good size, but not much in terms of the hot soup (go upstairs.. really.. even though the owners have changed, it is still better than here), and the pan fried Shanghainese buns.. this wasn't bad.. probably the best thing on the table.\\n\\nThis place is also weird on another aspect, the washrooms located in this place need a key? The washrooms are in your own area, why the hell do you need a key to go in? If you are wondering on my critical remarks, one side of my family is Shanghainese, and I have eaten this food for most of my life... below average, be warned, enjoy, have fun, and just know that the food court upstairs (two stalls) do better in this food than this restaurant!"},{"name":"Maekha Thai","address":"163 Squire Rd","city":"Revere","stars":"4","text":"Went there during the grand opening and went back the following two more times\\nThe service is great, the place is clean and pleasant.\\nThe food is really good Thai.

Yes.\\n\\nWe were here during happy hour, so prices were reduced, but I still think prices are a bit high for what you get.

Every single time I've eaten here, the staff are running around like crazy people, trying to keep up with the number of customers walking in the door.  I was at lunch the other day, and the poor server/bartender was the only one working.  I noticed that the owners did help out here and there, but as soon as they could, they were sitting down on their computers and tablets, leaving this gal to run the whole place by herself.  And I've seen this same scenario before, coming in mostly for lunch, watching this same person running herself ragged, trying to take care of everyone in the restaurant.  And it's not just her, I've seen them do this to other staff as well.  A single person simply cannot run a restaurant by themselves, in my opinion.  It looks to be extremely difficult, and completely unfair to the staff.  Service suffers, and it's not their fault.  The kitchen seems to have the same problem as well, with food taking up to 30 minutes to arrive at the table, with fries usually undercooked and soggy, and the rest of the food being underwhelming.  What is wrong with the management here?  Why isn't there more staff waiting on customers, or cooking in the kitchen?  I bet this place could be awesome, if they weren't understaffed all the time.  The drinks are usually really good, as is the food - when they have the proper amount of staff working.  Get it together guys!  This place could be 4-5 stars, with the right number of workers.

While we were waiting for our table, we ordered some drinks from the bar. I was annoyed that they had this delicious looking lemonade, but it was already premixed with vodka. Really? Your bartenders can't be bothered to mix vodka into the lemonade? Unfortunate for anyone who isn't drinking. I got a unsweetened ice tea with lemon (god help you if you screw up that, which fortunately they didn't, and luckily it came sans booze) and my husband ordered a sweet tea, which was good and not overly sweet, as some can be. \\n\\nAll while we were waiting, we saw big baskets of steaming biscuits going by ... Yum, they looked delicious. We were so excited to order them after being seated ... Only to find out they were out of them. Really? Strike #2 for me. \\n\\nSo we ordered the hush puppies. They were fried perfectly, meaning they were crispy and not at all greasy. The batter was slightly heavy, but nothing too bad. The maple sour cream that accompanied them was fantastic. I would have loved a small dish of maple syrup as well as the sour cream, but then again, I'm a traditional gal.\\n\\nI ordered the pulled chicken platter, and contrary to other reviews, it want dry at all. It tasted like plain, smoked chicken. I agree with some other reviewers that a dry rub would have been great (they say it is dry rubbed, but I couldn't taste any). The BBQ sauce was horrible though! The sweet sauce was not sweet, and I've had North Caroline sweet bbq sauce. The vinegar sauce was okay. But really, the chicken, while cooked nicely, was bland without sauces. The side of cheesy broccoli was the best part of meal. The carrot and raisin salad tasted like a bottle of vinegar had been just dumped on it and was nearly inedible. I also wish the menu had indicated that blue cheese was mixed in with this side, as I hate blue cheese, and because it usually isn't in this type of dish, didn't think to ask them to leave it off. The pickles that came on the side were amazing. \\n\\nMy husband ordered the pork belly and ribs. The ribs were good, but again, you couldn't taste the dry rub. They were moist and you could tell they were smoked nicely. I didn't taste the pork belly, but he said it was good. he said the coslaw was just okay. The bbq beans were good, but I personally prefer more beans and less pork. My husband thought they were great though, so it depends on your preference. \\n\\nThe check took forever to come, and then forever to be collected. The manager finally came over and rung our credit card through. However, our server was nice, knowledgable and kind. The background music was also super loud, so everyone was yelling over one another to have a conversation. Unnnessary at a bbq joint. \\n\\nOverall, not a bad meal, but I wouldn't go back. I definetly wouldn't wait again. I might get the biscuits and a few sides as take out one night, but that's about it."},{"name":"The Tavern at Camp Creek","address":"3560 Camp Creek Pkwy, Ste 110","city":"East Point","stars":"2","text":"Sorry It was kind of dark so I wasn't able to get a picture.

You feel like you can relax, put your feet-up, hang-out, talk, play on your computer for a couple hours. It's big and there's lots of room, and in the summer there's even more. Ahhhhh, Stauf's, how do I love thee, let me count the ways. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, Sunday. Sometimes Friday, too.\\n\\nI also want to mention the music. It's usually at just the right level, and you never know what you're going to hear. Could be some big band swing, some current indie rock, Miles Davis (usually the electric period) or Depeche Mode. It's almost always good, though.\\nUPDATE: They got Muzak. Now the music blows.\\n\\nSo why not 5 stars? Their baristas are good, nice, very competent, yes. Very friendly and fast, but they've not yet achieved the level of artists.

My service was full on attentive and a knowlegeable about both menu and bar items (including wine). Off to a great start. It's a weeknight, early one, and it's already a full house.\\n\\nI had resolved to not drink alcohol for a week two days earlier but it's not realistic to eat GOOD seafood without wine. Not for me.  I am glad I was forgiving with myself because the wine options are SOLID.  Punch bowl drinks that pack a no pun punch and offer a great value when you have multiple drinkers in your party. Beer and craft cocktails are notable in the lineup too.\\n\\n Pickled beet salad sports wonderful cubes of beets dressed with creamy vidalia onion and crunch crushed hazelnuts. Watercress and shaved fennel finish it off. Nice in this sweltering heat.  I had my heart set on fried clam bellies. they did not disappoint. Don't expect a basket of clams with a mystery sauce in the same boat. These are super tender sprawling clams that need only a squeeze of lemon.\\n\\nBarbecue Shrimp is full body shrimp, heads and all, in a crock with the baguette pre soaked for your eating pleasure. Worstershire goodness and all around richly satisfying. The smoked seafood platter is divine. Cold smoked salmon is exquisite. Trout pate spreads like smokey fishy creme fraiche and the hot smoked bluefish is rich. My friend said the pickled shreded beets made it feel like Passover.\\n\\nThe hushpuppies do come in a basket but ignore the ketchup with them.  Sweet, oniony and not a trace of grease. Almost dessert good! Do not miss them.\\n\\nI opted for almond ice cream with dark cherry and chocolate ice cream. Three scoops of refreshing goodness with just the right sweetness.

We assumed it was from the restaurant so we never bothered to look at them really. I also saw their \\"Yelp special\\" (mention you saw us on Yelp and you'll get $25 off dinner on Mon-Wed) so I knew we'd be covered for most of our dinner. \\n\\nAnyway, we got to Davide and we were the only ones there. I knew the location wasn't stellar and that they have a hard time getting traffic in so I wasn't expecting it to be busy but we literally ate in a completely empty restaurant. \\n\\nThe place is really cute - we just got back from Rome and it reminded us of restaurants we had just eaten at in Europe. They brought out warm bread that was heavy and melted in your mouth like butter. Side note: You could make a serious roast beef sandwich on that bread. \\n\\nFor apps we got: \\nFagottini ai Funghi di Bosco ( Puff pastry filled with wild mushrooms and Fontina cheese severed with saut√©ed mushrooms in a marsala thyme sauce) and Involtini di Melanzane (Rolled eggplant stuffed with goat cheese and ricotta in plum tomato sauce). \\n\\nThe mushroom pastry was really fantastic. It was light and flaky and the sauce they served it with was delicious. The thick pieces of mushrooms served on the plate were amazing as well. \\n\\nThe eggplant was just \\"Eh\\". It was generic. I really wanted to taste the goat cheese explosion. \\n\\nFor dinner we got the Fettucini alla Bolognesse and the Fusilli alla Boscaiola (Hand rolled fussily with mushroom and prosciutto in a parmigiano cream). They came in great sized portions. \\n\\nHe loved his Bolognesse but I think my Fusilli was better than his. The fusilli is made every morning by the owners mother and there's some definite love in that dish. The parmiagiano cream sauce is full fat and heavy and wonderful and the bits of prosciutto and thick mushrooms just made beautiful sense in the dish. We licked our plates clean and screamed of a belly ache. Their pasta dishes are exactly like the ones you get in Rome. \\n\\nWhen the bill came we tucked our credit card and gift certificates into the bill. The waitress (who was really nice all night) came back a few moments later and said we could only use one at a time. There is was.. right on the front in the fine print we never saw. We told her we hadn't seen it and that we were on our anniversary dinner just because of the gift certificates because we're on a budget and she apologized again. I then told her about the Yelp special and it was a Tuesday night so we asked to apply that promotion as well. She went to ask the manager again, but he wouldn't let us use the Yelp advertisement (even though neither had restrictions about using them together). \\n\\nShe said to come back and use the other $50 on our next meal. So, our bill ended up being $57 and $20 tip. Between the $25 in cabs to/from Back Bay and $77 on the bill, we just won't come back here use the other certificate to drop another $100 on a dinner. \\n\\nThe food was good though and I hope good things for this restaurant.

My girlfriend and I sipped on our drinks and I didn't even notice that we were waiting but moments until the food came back out, piping hot and fresh. The waitress made sure everything was prepared beautifully and we set about eating. My eggs florentine was unreal: a savory sauce, warm english muffins and of course, a runny center. After our delicious food, the waitress brought us a complimentary dessert! We were stunned and delighted by the browny sundae that she brought to the table. It was a lovely gesture. \\nThe entire experience was more than over the top. For a mom and pop place, the lighting is warm and inviting, the music was perfect and conveniently played ALL my favorite songs and the food could not have been more perfect.

It's a hidden sushi place with no signs AT ALL. HIDDEN.  It's in the restaurant called Chinatown Restaurant down stairs in the same building, we had to call to find it.  Hostesses told us there's no sign and they're found through word of mouth.  Sounded so legit!\\n\\nThe waitress was good, but she slacked on some things.  I had to wait awhile for an extra plate while everyone was done with the first appetizer.\\n\\n--Tuna Tataki Appetizer (5/5) So good we ordered TWO!  The tuna was seared nicely, it came in a martini glass with avocado with their hybrid sauce that was really good.\\n--Gyu Tataki (5/5) The meat was very tender, seared just the the tuna tataki and the vinaigrette wasn't too overpowering even when it was soaked.  Also served in a martini glass. \\n--Bakudan Mussel (2/5) I could make better mussels than this.  The mussels were chopped in 2-3 pieces with a bit of spicy mayo (needed more) topped with the bonito fish flakes.  I don't like things that taste too squidy or fishy, not something I expected in a mussel.\\n--Mutsu Kasuzuke (5/5) Since they didn't have Hamachi Kama, the cooked version we decided to give this a try.  Amazingly delicious, the fish was very soft and moist, the marination was on point.  Makes my mouth water!  I would come back here just for this.\\n--Sunomono (1/5) I thought this was the cucumber salad but it came with a bunch of the dark seaweed.  I was expecting more cucumbers, but I felt like this was okay.  \\n--Road Runner Roll (5/5) This was our favorite roll, at first the squid ink infused rice kind of threw us off, but the waitress said there wasn't a flavor to it so we decided to try it.  It's a nice creamy roll and it came with the delicious hybrid sauce they had.  We got the salmon inside instead of the soft shell crab and it was great.\\n--Chainsaw Roll (2/5) I saw this roll in pictures, but I didn't see it on the menu.  This is a raw roll, soaked in fish sauce, and it's rice-less.  The roll was really chewy,maybe it was the rice paper that was wrapped around it that made it chewy and really fishy (hence the fish sauce).  None of us really enjoyed this roll.\\n--Shima Zushi (1/5) Fishy as well, felt like the fish has been sitting in the sun, one and done.  Gave the other half away.\\n--Hamachi Kama (1/5) Really fishy, nothing to enjoy about it.  Came with the chilli pepper, SUPER SPICY.\\n--Champ's Sashimi (4/5) Only downfall was that I wish it was a bit colder, though the salmon still tasted pretty fresh.  This is just like a regular salmon sashimi, but this one came with a side of jalapeno soy sauce.\\n--Ankimo (1/5) Usually, I love foie gras and by that I mean the duck liver.  Never had I tried the foie gras of the sea.  The anikimo is harder than a regular foie gras, theres not really a taste to it, a creamyish pate and they topped it with this pink thing which made it un-edible to me.  Taste super super super fishy.\\n--Spicy Scallop (0/5) Fishy taste to the scallops, I took one bite.  One and done.  Too bad they ran out of the hotate, probably would have been a better selection.\\n--Botan Ebi (5/5) I always eat the fried head of the shrimp of whoever orders this.  It was so crispy and flaky, probably the best ever!  My friends also said the raw part was the best they had ever had.  I don't eat the raw part of this, but I believe them.\\n\\nI also wanted to try the Avocado Kama, but it sounded the same as the baked mussels besides the fact it came in an avocado.  Next time I will definitely try it though, probably way better without the fish flakes.\\n\\nAll of this was shared between the 5 of us, I was pretty full afterwards.  It wasn't a fun feeling to have to go drink afterwards though.  Though many things were not up to my standards, I would still come back for the few things that I did enjoy.   It was basically 60 buck per person which wasn't too bad, next time we will probably have to try the Uchiko an set reservations since they had a long wait."},{"name":"Musashino Sushi Dokoro","address":"2905 San Gabriel St, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This place is just really pretty to me.

Headed here on a Sat night for Canucks vs. Red Wings home game. Uhh, numbered 1 and 2 in the league (respectively of course) so this was a biggie to say the least! Had to ask the manager to switch the sound on as we watched the anthems in silence as well as the puck drop. I f-ing love watching/HEARING Mark Donnelly (big guy who sings at home games) belt out O'Canada so this was really enough to annoy me pretty substantially. \\n\\n2. Some football game was on on half the tv's. (i'm a hockey girl, maybe it was an important game- I wouldn't know) Can't have been pleasing for the folk watching football to have to listen to the Canucks game while watching football in silence. \\n\\n3. Manager switched the sound off during intermissions and started playing crappy no-name house music circa 2006. I'm pretty sure that the 3/4 of the bar actively watching the game was, like me, curious to hear what Ron had to say! \\n\\n4. The chicken wings which rang in at a whooping $11 were sinewy and over $1 a piece. ie: only 8-9 wings all told. \\n\\n5. Pool table was squished into too small a space requiring some poor girl to ask one or the other of our party sitting at the upstairs stools to move every time it was her turn. \\n\\nOk, so that's well over three reasons... overall, LS seems to be trying to please way too many divergent groups at once and is failing at impressing anyone in the process.\\n\\nAlso, honestly!

The \\nplace is always alive and vibrant, with the right amount of hustle and \\nbustle to keep things interesting. The restaurant describes itself as \\nAsian Pacific, with poetic food and art, and I think that describes it \\nvery well. I've always had a great dining experience at Haiku.\\n\\nThe inside of the building is split into two seating areas, with a drink \\nbar on one side and a sushi bar on the other side. The wooden tables are \\nnicely arranged and there are a few larger tables to sit bigger groups. \\nThe restaurant is decorated with various pieces of art hanging on the \\nwalls, most of which are for sale. Diners can also write their own haiku \\npoetry and hang it within the dining area, and read and share poetry \\nothers have written.\\n\\nThere is a large outdoor eating area for the warmer months, with a \\nwaterfall and stream running through the middle, creating a soothing, \\nromantic atmosphere. I have not eaten at the outdoor patio area yet, but \\nit looks like a great place to enjoy your meal.\\n\\nThe menu has a lengthy selection of entrees featuring a variety of large \\nand small plate selections, focusing on seafood, chicken, or beef. Check \\ntheir website for details, because there are just too many choices to \\nmention here. And of course they also are well known for their complete \\nselection of sushi, from appetizers to specialty rolls. I am not an \\nexpert on sushi, but I think the shrimp and tuna selections are \\nfantastic.\\n\\nThe service staff is attentive and knowledgeable and will gladly answer \\nall your questions about items on the menu. Ask for the lightly fried \\nSpicy Calamari appetizer, which is not on the menu, but has been a \\nfavorite for years. \\n\\nOverall, Haiku creates a very enjoyable and relaxing dining experience. \\nIt is the perfect place for a first date or the start of a romantic night \\nwith your significant other.\\n \\nSo if you are visiting the Short North area, come give Haiku a try, you're sure \\nto find something that you'll love here."},{"name":"Boston Pizza","address":"8100 Ackroyd Road, Suite 50","city":"Richmond","stars":"2","text":"Went for quick lunch here 03072016. \\nWalked in the place was empty. \\nOrdered a personal pizza with pep/ Italian sausage.

I've certainly had better, but I've definitely had worse.\\n\\nI'm surprised I haven't reviewed it until now, as I've been at least 3 or 4 times.  It's a good stand by.  Some of their dishes are phenomenal - my favorites include:  Patatas Bravas, Gambas al Ajillo (garlic shrimp), Solomillo (petit filet mignon), and Queso Frito (herbed goat cheese fritters).  The rest are kind of hit-or-miss, depending on your tastes.\\n\\nParking can be challenging (go to the residential area of the brighton/border line off of Corey and park on the Brookline side), and the service is generally fine (though they don't always tell you what they're dropping off at your table, which I like when I eat tapas).\\n\\nThe prices are moderate, but the general experience reflects it.

I literally spent about a quarter of our meal giggling at how perfectly Bogie's Place fit the bill.

The consistency of the curry was creamy and gravy-like, which is what I like (versus soupy), and there weren't any vegetables in the curry (I think there might have been tiny pieces of onion). The dish is pretty expensive ($17) compared to other places, but you get A LOT, and I ended up having leftovers even after splitting the dish with a friend. It's better quality and taste than other places anyway, so I'm fine paying the price. \\n\\nWe also tried the chashu (pork belly) appetizer, which was my friend's favorite part of the meal. The meat was so tender and so well-flavored, I kind of wish they would serve this with rice as a dish itself. (Or maybe they do and I just didn't see it on their super huge menu!) It was a bit pricey ($15) for the amount you get, but it's a nice restaurant and they can do that. \\n\\nThe third thing we ordered was unagi nigiri. The unagi here was one of the top-quality I've had, and I would have ordered more if I hadn't already ordered a crap-ton of other stuff already. I could probably just eat a whole plate of these and still want more. It wasn't super fatty or drenched in sauce to hide the low-quality of the meat, and it was cooked so it was just the right texture :)\\n\\nAlthough the restaurant was super loud, it's not too surprising considering how many people were in such a small space. And it's honestly no wonder there were so many people here -- it really is a great restaurant. The service was quick and very friendly, and the food was all really good :) I will DEFINITELY be returning here for more curry, and (if I'm feeling rich) to try more of their sushi menu!"},{"name":"Lure","address":"1106 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Not the fist time I ask for cup of soup and get a bowl.

We all shared the misto plate, the gnuddi fritti, and the calamari.  The gnuddi was awesome - they were perfect little purses of riccotta and spinach.  The calamari was also great and the misto plate had a variety of interesting meats and cheeses that were delicious.  I ordered the spare rib canneloni for my entree.  I loved it - I couldn't really taste the meat because it was all mixed together with the ricotta but I loved the earthy taste of the mushrooms and sauce mixed with the creamy cheese and thin, silky pasta.  For dessert I got the panna cotta and it was a great end to the meal.

Everything on the menu is great and the service is excellent"},{"name":"Matador Cantina","address":"925 Garrett St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Wow, where to start. My wife and I tried Matador at Glenwood Park for the first time. We decided to get outside of our usual comfort zone of local options and try out a new restaurant. Thinking that Mexican food is pretty benign and fail-safe we opted for the Matador based on a cursory menu review online. I'd be lying if I said that we haven't become skeptical of trying new places without personal reviews or recommendations.  We've had more than a few bad experiences in the old ATL.  I'll jump to the spoiler moment and say that we were pretty disappointed overall with our dining experience. Our fears of the unknown were not allayed. To be fair, this was mainly based on the quality of food and drink, not the service (which was fine throughout our visit).\\n\\nMy wife ordered a house Sangria which turned out to be an odd mix of I'm not sure what. We thought that it tasted kind of \\"off\\". I thought that it tasted like grape juice more than wine. She thought it was more like a grape juice and lemon-lime soda combo, something unlike any passable Sangria that we have had before.  The chips and salsa, which were promptly delivered, were good. The salsa was particularly tasty with a spicy kick. That is something unusual for cheap mexican fare places. That was a good standout.\\n\\nThe disappointment peaked when her food arrived. She order two tacos - one fish and one shrimp. She opened the shrimp one to see what could only be described as a few frozen popcorn shrimp from a bag laying on mix of cabbage. The fish taco was less sad to look at but could only be said to have the taste of grade school lunchroom fish sticks (that was my guess at least, based on my sample). Again this was very disappointing as we have had passable fish tacos pretty much everywhere else in Atlanta. How do you mess that up (on top of Sangra)? To their credit, the staff replaced the Sangria with another beverage and took it off of our bill. They also acknowledged the fact that we did not like it with an apology. I got a burrito and taco combo. It  was certainly OK, but not remarkable. My wife had some of the chicken burrito and thought it was fine at least.\\n\\nOverall we rate it as \\"disappointing\\" given all of the good, cheap mexican food options in Atlanta, even just SE Atlanta. It unfortunately takes up a place on the \\"won't hurry back soon\\" or \\"even ever\\" list. Life is just too short to spent time and precious money on mediocre food especially with all of the decent to good places hurting for business. Maybe they are just trying to hit their stride? Maybe they'll get better, although the clearly fresh-from-the- freezer taco fillings didn't make a good impression. Maybe we didn't order an unknown stand-out dish that saves the day?\\n\\nOverall - service was certainly OK, but food and drink were \\"not memorable\\" to \\"pretty unappetizing\\". I'd say to take a pass on this dining option right now and head north or east for more neighborhood options. I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because service was fine and salsa was creative."},{"name":"Canton Cooks","address":"5984 Roswell Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Yummy Cantonese food, just like Hong Kong...or L.A....or San Francisco!

We drank and nibbled on food, each glass of champagne was served glass by glass when other tables had bottles on the tables. After about an hour of everyone being their, the waiter had asked to sit outside. I asked if we could continue to drink champagne outside and eat, the Waiter said yes of course. I asked for a bottle since we were sitting outside and we wouldn't be serviced we would inside. After about 30 mins on the patio no one waiter in sight to be seen. I went back inside to get another drink and the bartender told me once we go outside the bottomless offer was over. Never was this told to my party, it's not listed any where on their website. I was very annoyed i spent 40 dollars for a bottomless mimosa that lasted maybe 2 hours, normally i would go to ember and it is truly bottomless from 10-3 and then again 3-6.

Maybe I just find the bad things petty to mention in the larger scheme of things. But this place really was great... really! I am usually pretty cheap with sushi... the concept of spending 3.25.. ok, maybe 4$ on a dinner out makes me squirm with delight (spicy tuna rolls at Yamato sushi). But I realized that I was really only enjoying one, somewhat limited set of goods on the sushi spectrum. So I went to Kadoya, took a big breath, and got 3 of their 8$/roll: Molten Lava, (smth special) (smth special 2). Ok I forgot what I got, I know, sorry, but it was interesting looking. I overdid it with the rainbow roll, and that was bland, not worth the price at all. But the molten lava with sesame sauce and black caviar on top was amazing.

Their specialty cocktail list is vast.  I found it interesting that the menu gives the historical origins of many of the cocktails, such as what bar in what city first invented it.  Even though it was busy, noisy and hectic, our servers were really friendly and took time to explain some of the more \\"complex\\" cocktails to us.  My friend and I each ordered a \\"Suffering Bastard\\" (and thanks to Hale Pele's informative menu, I know that it was invented at Shepheard's Hotel in Cairo in 1942).

The property is an odd looking and located green and white 3 or 4 story hotel which has both a good and bad location all at the same time! This 1970s vibe hotel is located right beside the main highway running north/south between Vancouver and the US border. The back side of the property is beside what appears to be a cornfield. It is also just across the highway from downtown Ladner and about 10 minutes from Tswassen Mills mall and BC Ferry terminal. This was perfect for us as we were there with my daughter's Fastball team for a tournament in Ladner. \\n\\nThe hotel is most definitely dated but seemed for the most part fairly clean, except for the long black slightly curly hair hanging off one of the extra rolls of toilet paper in the bathroom and the empty used tea bag outer envelopes left on the bathroom counter. Thankfully, we did not encounter any bed bugs and the beds were comfortable. Most importantly, there was a good size mini fridge and microwave in the room along with a coffee maker. There was a good sized window in our second floor room that opened for what we hoped was some fresh air. Unfortunately, as anyone who has visited or lived in Ladner can tell you, there is an ever present unrelenting stench of livestock feces from the many surrounding farms. Some say it's pig feces, while others say it's cow feces, while others say it's horse waste. I also sensed hints or notes of chicken, duck and goose excrement. Whatever the exact mix, the stench is intense and palpable. Indeed, we were nearly knocked over by what seemed like an overwhelming all powerful wall of ungodly fragrance of fresh cow pie on numerous occasions when walking out of doors. It can best be described as what one might expect the smell to be like if you had your head completely and deeply inserted into the rectum and bowels of a large cow, pig or horse. I digress. \\n\\nThe furnishings, fixtures, carpets in the hotel were old and tired, but functional. On a positive note, there is a nice large courtyard area with an outdoor pool, which unfortunately was undergoing repairs, with a number of tables and chairs which we used for our team and family dinner and cocktails. The hotel staff was most accommodating in this respect, which goes a long way when traveling with a team of youngsters and their parents. \\n\\nIn whimsical and quaint fashion, the hotel had 2 or 3 old push button pay phones in the lobby area, which seemed like a satirical tribute or ode to the buygone glory days of this once 3 star quasi-resort. Indeed the property evokes images of farmers and their families coming from the many surrounding farms dressed in their Sunday best perhaps for dinner or a wedding reception in the 1950s, to their local version of the Ritz! \\n\\nAlso of note is the ample free parking, which seemed to be relatively secure, probably a result of the property's odd slightly remote location. The staff were friendly, polite, courteous and accommodating. There was very little noise and the vibe was semi-rural chill. For a rate of just over $100 per night, one could do much worse. Breakfast was not included, but there is a restaurant attached to the hotel, which is said to be decent, though we did not try it. \\n\\nIf you're looking for relatively cheap digs with a comfortable bed located near Ladner, Tswassen and the ferry terminal, with easy access to the highway, this might be just the place for you!"},{"name":"Toasted","address":"1945 Aloma Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"Perfect for grilled cheese lovers.

But this place did not really do that. I think I fell in love with French cuisine here, but only for very special occasions. My favorites from here were the duck leg confit. The duck meat was tender and succulent. The wild mushroom raviolis will be heaven for any mushroom lovers like me. But the star of the night was really the escargots. I could not get enough of the duxelles garlic butter. I was using the ciabata bread and even asked for extra bread to sop up as much of that butter sauce as I can. They did a great job with that butter sauce and I did not taste anything weird with the escargot. \\n\\nI liked the terrine de lapin the least. I personally am not familiar with eating rabbit nor terrines, but the texture was very weird or haute for my immature palate for finer dining. The coq au vin was excellent, but still could not compare to the duck confit.\\n\\nWe were satisfied with both our desserts. We did particularly enjoy the contrasting temperature taste sense in the profiteroles with the warm chocolate on the ice cream.\\n\\nOur waitress gave impeccable service.

The veggie - was pretty salty for my taste but the wife seemed to like it a lot.  all in all - decent quantity for the price, could have been more, but taste was pretty authentic and pretty good surprisingly.

True to their name, they have a solid bourbon selection, and perhaps more importantly, only judge you a little when you order it in the morning on the Sabbath. \\n\\nIt's important to note that the dim sum service turns into a pastry-cart affair during brunch. This was a little disappointing, but ultimately it ends up saving your wallet. They are masters of presentation here and everything on the cart looked divine, so we ordered, well, everything. The almond crumb cake and lemon tartlets were standouts, though the crust on just about every pastry was flaky perfection.\\n\\nAs Erik mentioned in his review, the Trinidad Sour cocktail was shockingly good considering the primary ingredient was Angostura bitters.  For rapidly rising restaurant, the brunch cocktail menu was paltry, but at least they offered a bit more than the typical bloody mary\\\\mimosa combo.\\n\\nThe food? Well it was alright. I had the lamb while the wife had pork tamales. The lamb was competent but heavy handed with the salt. Also, despite the cabbage, texturally the entire thing was a bit mooshy.

I would think that she'd know that the $10 was in there to get change, and since we had waited a while to get the check, I had one more dollar in my pocket and left $5.50 for a tip (where I would have left more otherwise), instead of waiting for her to come back.\\n\\nAll and all, the meal was decent, price was fine, waitress was good.

I used yelp and found this place was close to me.\\n\\nAppa's sits off Buford Hwy, right near the Towers liquor store.  I actually drove past it bc the lot it sits in looks rundown and there were no cars in the lot (it was about 6ish).  Also, the building looked like a hole in the wall Mexican joint, so I thought the Appa's street sign was surely wrong.  Reluctantly, I turned around and realized I was in the right place.\\n\\nThey do have outdoor seating here.  Once you walk in, it's much nicer.  Very easy order system:  bowl, burrito or hand wrap.  You then pick your protein (tuna or salmon) and your spice.  They have other options, but forgive me, as I only came here for the burrito.  I noticed that alcohol was available but I was getting my order to go.\\n\\nThe ambiance of the place was relaxing, and it was certainly decorated Japanese style.  They had a few big tvs around the place.  I barely had time to snap some pictures before they called my to-go order.  Guess that's the beauty of being the only customer.  As I walked out, there were families starting to roll up heavily.\\n\\nSo, it's very basic on options here and that can be a good thing or bad thing depending on if you like a lot of options or not.  My burrito was cut in half and had spicy sauce, rice, salmon, lettuce and radish, plus that orange stuff that looks like fish eggs.  The salmon was fresh but the burrito fell apart pretty easily.  I wish I had the option to add cilantro and diced jalape√±os in it, plus add tuna too.  Also, a side of spicy mayo would have been nice.\\n\\nIt also came with a side of miso soup, which I really liked!  Plenty of tofu in it.  Cost was around $12.70, which wasn't too bad.

That's what adds the taste to tortilla soups and/or posole.  :)"},{"name":"Sweet Cheeks Q","address":"1381 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm not a Top Chef watcher so didn't have a clue about the Significance of this place until after we sat down to eat. However, I'd eaten well at Rocca's, where Tiffani had cooked previously, and was happy to give this a try.\\n\\nI love barbeque and have a soft spot for brisket. SC's is perfect: tender with sweet, slightly charred ends, melting fat, and good, smoky flavor. I had the mac and cheese and farm salad as the sides. The M&C was amazing--creamy goodness with not a hint of Velveeta, just a pure, tangy, cheddar goodness and what I believe was a Ritz cracker topping, God bless them. The farm salad got huge points for being interesting (brussels sprouts AND farro AND arugula!), but the aged cheese in it didn't work for me. Whatever. A plate of barbeque that also contains farro makes my heart sing. The standard accompaniments of great pickles, meh onions (slice them thicker and pickle them, too!), and Wonder bread round out the platter very well. I felt it was a relative bargain for $18.\\n\\nThe side of hush puppies was good--I don't love hush puppies to begin with, but these are a tasty, non-greasy, slightly cuminy example of the genre. I sort of wanted a tangier, less sweet sauce than the buttermilky (?) one it came with. I wished we'd tried the fried green tomatoes, instead. Also, although I was delighted to see a NC-style vinegar sauce on the table, I also kind of wanted a KC- or Kentucky-style sauce--something sweeter and smokier than the house barbeque sauce, maybe with a little celery salt. I know the sauce is where everyone gets super-fussy about BBQ and you can't make everyone happy with one sauce, so this is not a big deal to me.\\n\\nWe'd once had a special dessert at Rocca: a butterscotch budino that has since been cited with dreamy eyes as the Best Dessert Ever. So when we saw butterscotch pudding on the recipe, we almost peed our pants. Indeed, it is spectacular. It comes in a smaller Mason jar and is quantity enough for 3 nibblers, especially given its extreme! unctuousness! There's a thin slick of what I think is hard sauce and a sprinkle of salt on top--although the congealed-butter texture of the hard sauce wasn't my thing, it was an extremely minor ding in an otherwise really special dessert. Amazing flavor, amazing texture--very similar to that budino. Thanks so much for putting this on the menu, guys!\\n\\nBooze-wise, you can get a RIDICULOUS amount of a rather spicy Michelada here for 10 bucks. It's a 24-oz jar--enough for at least 2 to share. It's served on ice, so if the idea of a beer cocktail on ice sketches you out, be advised. I also tried the Houston AFB--basically, an Aviation--and it was damn delicious.\\n\\nMy only quibble was not a major one, but was enough to take off a star: the service is still in need of a little polish. We got there a little after 6:30 on a Sunday evening, and although the business was brisk, there were lots of empty seats. We were told there was a 45-minute wait for 3. I know it's all dependent on the server:table ratio, but it seemed a little strange. We also had to track down our own cocktail menus and ask for a server at one of the drink-but-no-dinner-service areas at the periphery of the restaurant. We ate at the bar, where the service was attentive, if occasionally a little amateur (I'd advise against interrupting conversations to introduce diners to the silverware jug and the barbeque sauce). It was all pretty forgivable given the general eagerness to keep us happy, as well as the visual appeal of the place (drinks served in Mason jars, repurposed wood furniture--you know, comfy-rustic-family-style chic) . It's also relatively new, and I suspect a lot of this will get worked out with time. \\n\\nAs an addendum, I'm not sure what was going on when A.B. reviewed this restaurant. However, one thing SC doesn't lack is a desire to make its diners happy--if you can't find a single goddamn thing you like about the place, you're probably doing it wrong."},{"name":"Five Guys","address":"3208 B Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"when you walk in, yes it is noisy, yes they yell out 'first timer' if you've never been there - thats part of the concept and culture.\\n\\ni had the little burger which is one patty.  it was plenty, keep in mind i eat a ton.  all the fixins are free so in addition to your standard lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, mayo mustard - you also get to pick from grilled onion, grilled mushrooms, A-1 sauce, hot sauce etc.  thats cool imho.\\n\\nthe burger itself is handformed never frozen -- great, no outrageous, special seasoning that i could of.  the bun is prepackaged, but i liked em.  they were soft but the density was jus right so they didn't get soggy - had a nice sweet, buttery quality to them.  i don't usually go out of my way to critique a bun, but they tasted like butterkrust white bread, yum.\\n\\nhad the cajun fries, i think i'll go with the regular.  the cajun seasoning was just tony chacherre's.  fuddrucker's cajun seasoning was what i was expecting.  these are more like homestyle fries with the skin that are thicker and slightly more floppy than your general fast food joint fries.\\n\\nall in all it was very tasty.  it was like something my dad would do in the backyard.  \\n\\nyou have to keep in mind though this place isn't looking to be socially conscious, or healthy by any means - so if you're comparing it to P.

I am from out of town and researched sushi places on Yelp before selecting one. I eat A LOT of quality sushi and know my stuff so I was looking for quality reviews vs. price. I landed on this place, loaded into a cab, and headed out solo. It was raining out but the outdoor area looked really nice. I headed inside and asked for a table by the sushi bar. My server was great. Proactive and offered up good suggestions. Didn't make me feel awkward for eating alone. I ordered some rolls, salmon handroll, and eel,\\nUni and toro. Toro was listed as market price but I decided to go for it. Started with the handroll which was just plain nasty. The chopped salmon looked more like tuna and had a very off flavor. The salmon was ok so I moved on to the toro. Holy freaking yuck!! I've had sweet fatty melt  in your mouth toro many times and this was plain CRAP. Color was gray, texture was chewy and flavor and smell was straight up something you would chum the ocean with. I passed on the second piece I ordered and politely told the server that it didn't taste quite right. When he brought my bill he said aloud that he removed the toro and the main sushi chef heard this. He yelled \\"what?? Toro is good!!\\". I said no disrespect but I did not like it. He then grabbed a hunk wrapped in paper and shoved it at me yelling that is WAS good. The place fell silent and people looked at me. I said again I did not mean any disrespect. He then cut a piece, put it on a plate and threw it towards my at table. I said no thank you and he just kept yelling. I told him I would be leaving soon and again no disrespect. \\nMany of the staff there came up as I left to apologize for him. Very strange and very unprofessional.

They really did do an excellent job with the renovations. The staff is very nice and friendly, and the valet is a bonus considering parking on west 6th can be a challenge. \\n\\nHere's what I didn't like: The service was incredibly slow. We waited 15 minutes once we got seated for our server to finally come. Yes, they're busy, but a few times, after finally getting our food,  I saw our waitress just standing there meanwhile our wine glasses had been empty for some time.  We ordered by the glass and wanted another drink. By the time she came around to ask if we wanted something else to drink we were done eating and ready for the bill. She may have stopped at our table twice the whole time, to either drop off or pick up a plate. Typically in restaurants like this one the server comes by every 5 to 10 minutes. I'm sure the other servers were much better, it could've just been ours. To be completely honest, she sucked. I think it may have been her first time as a server. \\n\\nThe food was not impressive. I feel like I could have got the same meal at Kerby Lane. My husband ordered the Italian meatloaf and it was hard and dry. I ordered the walnut crusted chicken and it was ok. Pretty bland. Let me put it this way, when you see the place you expect the same amount of effort put into the food as they put into the decor. \\n\\nI'll give this place another try, eventually, and hopefully in the meantime they can work out any kinks they need to- like better servers and food.

I was pretty pumped for a good BBQ meal since they're hard to come by in Boston and after my visit to Sweet Cheeks, I'm sad to report that I'm still looking.  My friend and I split the fried chicken tray, which was huge, but ultimately unimpressive.  I'm not sure what cuts of chicken were used, but the larger pieces had small pieces of bone throughout, forcing us to awkwardly spit these little fragments out into our napkins throughout our meal.  \\n\\nEven worse than the food, however, was the service.  I have never had a waitress so rude and unfriendly.  While I understand that customer service is a tough career and we were a big group, nothing our party did warranted her behavior or attitude.  Seriously, she treated us like we were the largest burden and worse group she had ever dealt with when all we did was order food and sit there to chat with our friend, who was moving back to Mexico the next day.  Not only that, but when I asked her if there was a way she or one of the staff could change the channel of the nearest TV from the golf channel to the NBA Western Conference Finals she curtly and coarsely asked me \\"TO?!\\" as if I was going to ask her to use her most recent paycheck to subscribe to HBO so I could marathon Game of Thrones or something.  Afterwards, I saw her walking around to all of her co-workers, pointing at me, blatantly rolling her eyes and complaining about my (what I thought was reasonable, but obviously not because college golf is so much more riveting than the NBA) request.  Oh, and once the meal was over she essentially chucked the bill onto the table, clapped her hands as if she was wiping herself of our business, and walked away without a word.  Yeah, so if you're looking to be served by someone who clearly hates you, you should give Sweet Cheeks a try.\\n\\nPerhaps the only saving grace of our time at Sweet Cheeks was the biscuits and honey butter.

As I said, we waited way too long to be seated even though there were so many empty tables in plain view and we were only 2 people (we could see at least 6 open tables of two) It was a Saturday night so there should be plenty of wait staff, but the hostess repeatedly left her station to bus tables! I asked if we would be seated soon and she said yes but she wanted to clear out some of the bigger parties in the waiting area first!!! (They arrived at least 15 min after we did and our table was clearly ready for us!!) Ok, so that was bad enough but things only got worse! The waiter never brought our water that we asked for twice, the drinks were terrible (all mixer), my husband's chicken clearly wasn't cooked enough, and they never entered the shrimp into the system, therefore, he never got the rest of his meal, nor did they offer to bring any.

The rest of the meals trickled out over \\nthe next 10-15 min. Red flag #5.\\n\\nThe food here was mediocre at best. The chicken cacciatori was tough \\nand almost inedible.

AFURI is a famed Japanese ramen restaurant at the foot of the Afuri mountain in Yokohama that specializes in Yuzu style (citrus) ramen. Portland is lucky to have not one but two locations of AFURI- the only locations outside of Japan. \\nAt first, citrus-flavored ramen did not sound too appealing, but I decided to give it a try because I'm not a huge fan of tonkotsu (the pork-based broth is usually too salty for me). For some reason that I don't quite remember (perhaps it was because we came to AFURI straight from Deschutes brewery), I decided to order the Yuzu Ratan, which is the spicy version of their famed Yuzu Shio. I rarely order spicy foods when I eat out because I have a low spice tolerance, but the Yuzu Ratan was perfect for my taste. \\nI LOVED this ramen! It was without a doubt the best ramen I've ever had (and I've been to Japan multiple times, though I haven't eaten at AFURI there). The spicy soy tare did not overpower the light citrusy taste of the broth, and the flavor reminded me of one of my favorite Japanese dishes, Dobin mushi. I tried the Yuzu Shio that my friend ordered, and it was also delicious. The citrus flavor is more pronounced without the spicy soy tare. I would recommend both options. I left AFURI with a full belly, a beaming smile, and no need to down a glass of water."},{"name":"Centro Mexican Kitchen","address":"950 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"A fantastic evening!

When I arrived to pick up the food there was no discount indicated on the bill. She told me no tax had been charged instead. I did not get a copy of the bill but did notice the prawn and cashew dish was $21.95. After I got home I checked the menu and this dish was actually listed at $16.95. As I said, no receipt was given to me so it was pretty hard to go back and prove the charge.

The food here was pretty salty, more saucy and the clientele was pretty much all non-Asian. We did find out they have a separate menu for Chinese customers so if you're looking for something authentic, ask for that -- it has English words too :) \\n\\nBut the Peking Duck, out of this world. I'd definitely come back for their duck.\\n\\nPEKING DUCK - $35.95\\nThe best dish of the evening. Menu mentioned 2 courses - we asked for the 1 course. 2 courses means 1st course is the duck w/ the pancake ingredients, 2nd course is stir-fried duck w/ veggies. With 1 course, you get the whole duck which is all chopped and sliced (the crispy skin - my most favorite part), chopped scallions and cucumbers, oyster sauce and pancakes to wrap all the deliciousness. Ask for their chili sauce - makes it even more delicious. Oyster sauce is very salty so don't put too much - I made that mistake for my 1st wrap. For our party of 6, I think we had enough for 2-3 wraps each. My friend thinks they have the best Peking Duck in Atlanta. \\n\\nPAN FRIED SPICY SALTED SHRIMP - $13.95\\nGood but not sure I'd get again. Remember to ask for no head, no shell. Also pan-fried w/ iceberg lettuce and jalapenos. Maybe I'd try the squid next time.\\n\\nEGGPLANT W/ SPICY GARLIC SAUCE - $11.95\\nThe eggplant was very mushy. The ground pork tasted good. But overall very oily dish.\\n\\nPEPPER STEAK - $12.95\\nI loved the pepper steak at the original Canton Cooks but this one was very salty, tasted Americanized, frankly boring w/ onions and green peppers. We didn't even finish. \\n\\nCHINESE BROCCOLI W/ OYSTER SAUCE - $9.95\\nThe oyster sauce made this dish too salty and all the stalks made it very hard to eat. We should've asked for scissors to cut the broccoli, haha. For green veggies I'd recommend the Snow Pea Tips instead. \\n\\nOverall average but if you love Peking Duck, definitely worth a visit.

The walk upstairs is beautiful, because the stairs are seemingly supported by wine bottle corks. You'll see what I mean. The whole place is just lit up so brilliantly. I am a fan of this atmosphere. \\n\\nWe get seated and decide what we want pretty quickly. We like delicious food and we like to share giant things, so we get the The Big Board (Chef's selection of six artisanal cheeses & five crafted meats / condiments). There were a plethora of meats and cheeses. Some of the standouts being the Serrano ham, the thinly sliced chorizo, the amazing cheese I can't remember the name of with the texture of brie but the taste of bleu, and the dab of tomato jam on the platter. All excellent. \\n\\nIt was a lot of fun trying out the hundreds of different combinations of meats and cheeses and condiments and bread, like it always is. This was charcuterie done right. The only complaint I had was the pitiful amount of baguette they served with the platter. I didn't want a whole loaf or anything, but I wanted enough to give a good amount of my combinations a vessel to travel on. The server told us this complaint happens all the time and he brought us some more at no charge. Hopefully he or she can do the same for you. \\n\\nFor dessert we had to get The Chocolate Experience (Pairing demonstration of three wines and three chocolates). The server said that he would tell George (THE George), and that he would probably want to come out and do the demonstration himself. And he did! He came and told us the magic of chocolate and wine and the pairing of the two. He was a nice guy. And the chocolate was good. Not amazing, but good.\\n\\nI feel like I thought dessert was only good because the whole idea was the pairing, which I did not partake in. My girlfriend and my friend had their fair share of wine, and they report that it was all very good and worth the price. Apparently Wine Bar George has super industry secrets to sealing their bottles after a pour. Maybe that's how they get away with their great wine prices, I don't know. \\n\\nI do know that this place was a lot of fun with a brilliant atmosphere and good food to share with friends and have a great evening out.

The restaurant is beautiful, modern and clean. Some of the biggest TV's I've ever seen in my life and not a bad view in the building. The restrooms were tidy and there are even outlets in the booths so you can charge your devices.\\n2 - Friendliness. Our hostess and our server were both very sweet and seemed to be happy. No negative interactions while we were there. Manager didn't make table rounds, but did tell us thanks for coming in on our way out.\\n\\nCONS:\\n1 - Timing. Like I mentioned, we went for a quick lunch and it took over an hour. I have always had quicker lunches at similar restaurants and this one caused me to be late for a meeting. \\n2 - Service. While our waitress was very sweet, she was also very forgetful (especially for being in the serving industry). Drink orders were mixed up and we had to go up and ask for silverware. My drink ran dry and I had to drink some of my coworkers beverages for a while before getting a refill. \\n3 - Food. We all had different wings and they were all overcooked. Brittle. The rub and sauces still tasted good, but as I said, the chicken was dry and hard to chew. They also serve everything on one plate at lunch. So our salads came on the same plate, basically mixed in with our saucy wings. Not only did this cause us to get unwanted sauces from our salads/wings touching, but the hot plate warmed the salad and it was very wilted.\\n\\nTLDR: Nice place, nice people. food and timeliness need some work.

My roommate had been previously for a bachelorette party and had a nice time.  She and another good friend took me out for birthday drinks on a Friday night.\\n\\nWe arrived on the early side, about 10, because we wanted to find a good place to sit if possible.  We lucked out and got a little side table, and a waitress took our orders.  I did like the drinks that I had, but there was quite a bit of time between rounds.  Also, not cheap, obviously.  I'm willing to pay a little more for a good quality cocktail, but $13 is pushing it for a club where you can't dance.  \\n\\nSince the crowd was sort of....odd...for a Friday night, we decided to move on to somewhere else, and the waitress brought us our bill.  My friends picked up the tab, since it was my birthday, and I didn't see the total.  Later in the evening, my roommate was thinking about it.  She came to the conclusion that we had definitely been over-charged.  She did not receive an itemized bill, so when we got home, she looked at their menu online.  She added up the drinks that we actually got, and she determined that we had been charged $18 extra.  She e-mailed the bar, and they sent her back an itemized bill.  It had 2 Svedka drinks that we most certainly did NOT order.  We would never go out of our way to order Svedka anything, lol!\\n\\nShe politely emailed the manager back, saying that we only had 6 drinks total, not 8, and asked if he could adjust the bill since she had paid with her credit card.  After a delay of a few days, he said they had to \\"research it\\" before they do anything.  Research what?!  Why would my roommate be going through all this trouble over 2 drinks?  We weren't asking him to knock $200 off the bill, just $18!  Several days passed, and he did not fix the problem or get back to my roommate.  Only after about three emails to the manager, letting him know that she will not make this easy on him until she received her refund, did she get the refund.  I believe it took about three weeks.  Three weeks for an $18 refund- that's just embarassing.\\n\\nNote to management of E.L.: The customer is always right.  I have written several letters and e-mails to both small and large companies regarding inadequate service.  I have always received an immediate apology, and usually free services or free products as a result.  Those companies know how to appease their customers, but you do not.  We did not even ask for anything for free; my roommate just didn't appreciate being overcharged/swindled.  Had you responded quickly with an apology and offered to immediately correct the \\"mistake,\\" we would probably be back someday.  (Mistake is in quotes, because I am not entirely convinced that it WAS a mistake.)

That is what I tasted when I took my first bite & I didn't like that, so I took them out.  If you really like spring rolls, they are worth a try at least.\\n\\nThe lavender milk tea - $3.50 - good. Seems like a funny combo with all this food, but we drank it up.\\n\\nThe only drawback about this place is the store front.  Its just in a run down little tiny strip next to a dry cleaners on one side & a cigar shop on the other. The store itself is decently clean but because I have a two year old son you notice the grim b/c he wants to touch everything. They have high chairs for kids but they aren't high enough for the tables so we ended up getting our food to go & went to the nearby underwood park.  Luckily I keep my picnic blanket in the trunk! It'd be fine for older kids, just a little hard with toddlers.\\n\\nInside the store they have stools & tall tables surrounding the place with plenty of sriracha bottles scattered around. They have a big screen tv on the wall.  No one else was there but one lady came in to get a take out order.  She was in/out in about a minute.  Our wait time was normal for them to cook fresh food for us.

I felt bad for the nice woman working there- she seemed apologetic and weary as I listened to her recite the phrase 'we're out of' again and again to the other customers.\\n\\nGot the namesake Full English breakfast.  It was a ridiculously small plate considering the $8 price tag but in the end that didn't matter because we couldn't eat half the food it was such a gross grease fest. The tiny sausage was burned on one side and had a few bits of hard, fatty grizzle in it.  The lone tomato was blackened and slimy.  The mushrooms tasted like they'd been marinated in Crisco and then slightly warmed.  The overly buttered toast was stale.  After a few minutes, a pool of oil began to settle in the middle of the plate. To be fair, the fried egg was fine.  So $8 buys you one decent fried egg.  \\n\\nAlso got a mushroom and egg bunty. It had all the same grease problems served up on a bland, super market-shelf wheat hamburger bun.

The first visit: The first time I went, I was with a very large group of people. Having held a couple of stressful service jobs myself, I completely understand that large groups in restaurants can be stressful for servers, and I am generally willing to give a good amount of leeway when it comes to service. However, this first time, I was actually shocked at how absent our server was and how little he seemed to check in with us to see how we were doing. This was particularly confusing and bizarre to me given the fact that the restaurant was almost entirely empty with the exception of our large group. Furthermore, and I see that other people have also posted this in their reviews, it seemed as though various items from the menu were either not available or only partially available. Some examples: the potatoes we received with our brunch were stale and cold, and those of us who ordered meals that came with some sort of salsa or hot sauce were told that these items were unavailable because it was a \\"crazy night\\" the previous night. When we insisted on having some sort of hot sauce, the server finally, reluctantly told us that he could \\"scrape off the bottom of the bottle\\" and bring us what little was left (which he did). We then proceeded to pass around a very small container with a very small amount of hot sauce for the whole table. It was odd, but what else could we do? Finally, when it came time to collect our bill, we had to really go out of the way to flag down our server (he had barely checked up on us at all throughout our meal -- it honestly felt like he had forgotten about us entirely). \\n\\nSo, the second time I went (today) with just one other person, I was hoping to have a better experience. On the whole, to be fair, it was a better experience, but I do have to say that the service we received was again bizarre and passive. Both servers who helped us left us hanging for long periods of time and seemed less than enthusiastic to be interacting with us. The food was just okay.

Tip: check Groupon for $25 of food for $13!\\n\\nAmbiance\\nConveniently located in Grandview with a parking garage right across the street. Inside you will find the place is huge with an upstairs and downstairs. Most evenings you'll find live music downstairs; opt for upstairs for a quieter meal. There are standard size wooden tables for a small party to have an intimate meal as well as larger ones. We sat upstairs for a quieter meal, and the music downstairs was still audible but not intrusive. There are large windows upstairs looking down in case you want to check out the entertainment. There's an elevator if you can't manage stairs. \\n\\nService\\nStaff are dressed in classic German attire and were pretty friendly. Our server was friendly and attentive and always checked up on us and brought drink refills. There was a roving photographer offering free photos for tips. \\n\\nFood\\nA wide selection of German food is available. German beers are plentiful along with German takes on various cocktails. We had the house salad with the house made cucumber dressing which tasted a bit like a light ranch. The salad was crisp and fresh. Then we had one schnitzel dish with no sauce and one with the mushroom sauce. Both were hot and tender and crispy, but the rich mushroom sauce definitely enhanced the flavor. German food is not known to be particularly spicy or seasoned, but the sauce was rich and delicious. For sides we tried the corn, fries, mixed vegetables, and potato dumpling. All were very good; the dumpling was the most unique German side and had a dense starchy goodness. For dessert - Apfel strudel \\"mit Eis\\" (with ice cream - +$1.50). This was absolutely delicious. Hot and fresh apples in a wonderful pastry wrapping with vanilla sauce. Classic German and delicious. With our $25 Groupon (see above) all this food plus two soft drinks came to about $32 with tip - a great deal!

This is one of our go-tos that we've been frequenting since about 2003, safe to say we're eaten here ~30 times before or something ridiculous like that... we've basically got the entire menu memorized and can tell immediately when something is new or has changed. Sad, or awesome? You decide...\\n\\nAnyways, usually everything is stellar. Aside from the fact that if you're on their mailing list you get ridiculous amounts of goodies from $5 pitchers of sangria, to a $10 gift certificate for no reason, to a special 3 course $16 \\"stimulus menu\\", to a free bottle of cava on your birthday... all of that alone would make you frequent this place, good food or not. But that's the best part, they do have good food, fantastic food in fact, that's really reasonably priced (perhaps *the* cheapest tapas place in the city) and usually really consistent. The interior is adorable/romantic/neat, and sometimes they have flamenco dancing or guitar. The sangria is killer, and many of my favorite dishes ever are from here (patatas bravas, gambas al ajillo, this special that has chicken and mushrooms in a red wine-mushroom sauce...). Honestly, when I was in Spain a month ago, I kept wishing I could find patatas bravas as good as Tasca's (I did not, sadly).\\n\\nThis visit, however, it took forrrrever for our dishes to start rolling out, and they trickled in in a random order... they didn't bring all the same orders out at the same time like they normally do, so for example two of us got our patatas bravas right away while the third person had to wait for theirs until the end. Also, the food quality was much poorer than we're used to... for the first time ever, the patatas bravas were actually spicy, like to the point where I could barely eat them (I'm sensitive to spicy things).

It comes with a generous helping of both cream cheese and salmon, and both the red onions and hard boiled egg provide a great touch. Overall, it's a very rich and savory sandwich that has great texture balance between crisp and creamy. Their broccoli and cheese soup blew me away because it was actually a soup, not a bowl of thick cheese. It was very light and tasty, something I didn't expect at all. My friends also ordered the mussels, corn and peach risotto, the fried oyster sandwich, and the crispy veal - all of which received high praise! \\n\\nEpicerie sells a variety of grocer items, some of which are rarities in Austin (i.e. NY's Blue Bottle Coffee), and the whole design of this place is perfect (this doesn't even need to be said). The staff are friendly and helpful as well. \\n\\nHowever, the prices on everything are $2-4 too high. I suppose this is attributed to higher quality ingredients, but I can't confirm this since I'm not sure where epicerie sources everything. I am pretty understanding when it comes to prices, but even their sandwiches are all $11+. In addition, some of the grocer items are ridiculously marked up (i.e. Jester King beers selling for $4-5 more than other places). I do think their coffee is pretty fairly priced though, and they do a Chemex pour over as the house coffee - that's a win in my book. \\n\\nI almost gave this place 3.5 stars, but the atmosphere and service really bumped things up.

That being said, Great Wall is definitely my favorite out of the big three in New Albany, which would be Lucky Yee, Asian Taste, and of course Great Wall.  Great Wall has jumped into my upper echelon with Joy Food and Asian Gourmet, and I will tell you why.\\n\\nFirst off, Great Wall is FAST....I'm talking Sonic the Hedgehog fast.  You call and put an order in?  You'll usually get the response \\"10 Minutes!\\"  This was the exact response that I heard today...I was hungry and had to be at work in about 35 minutes, so I called and ordered vegetable pad thai...\\"10 Minutes!\\"  I got there probably about 8 minutes after and my food was ready.\\n\\nSecond, and this obviously won't apply to everyone, but location.  I can drive to Great Wall and back from our apartment and only be gone for 15 minutes.\\n\\nThird is quality.  My wife and I have ordered numerous dishes from here, and everything has been great with no disappointments, though my favorites are orange shrimp and garlic chicken. Everything always seems piping hot and extremely fresh.  Our typical order is a PuPu platter, house lo mein, and then each of our choice entrees.  This leads into the fourth thing...quantity.  You get a ton of food!  And I can't mention quantity without that going hand in hand with value...the amount of food you get for what you pay is fantastic.  \\n\\nNow, the only knock I can toss at this place...they don't deliver.  If I lived further away this might be a bigger deal to me, but I can drive over and pick our food up in 5-10 minutes no problem so it's not that big of an issue.  \\n\\nI've actually been leaning more on Great Wall for Chinese since Joy Food no longer seems to deliver this far out...can't blame them really, it's over 5 miles.  Long story short, give Great Wall a try, and I'm guessing you'll come to the same conclusion that I did...there is no better Chinese in New Albany."},{"name":"The Haven","address":"2 Perkins St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"4.5","text":"Pretty great little Scottish pub.

I promptly ordered both the latte and oatmeal and plopped down on the completely ripped apart brown leather sofa in the back that has a really good view of the pool table and a table where I can put my latte down so I can get the bowl as close to my face as possible without dribbling cereal down my shirt.

I ended up trading half of my sandwich for half of my friend's tuna melt which I never do --I am not a food sharer. I was happy that everyone was allowed to easily substitute their sides, and the reactions to the meals were across the spectrum. Most people were happy with what they ordered - only a few loved what they got and a few were unhappy. Our waiter was very friendly but because of where the computer was stationed, he and the other servers were always standing right by our table.

Thankfully we made reservations ahead of time so we didn't have to wait in line.  \\n\\nMenu variety:  Drink menu had lots of drinks to choose from, classified by drink strength and you can also share from 1-4 people.  I shared the Boo Loo and had the Jet Pilot.  For the food variety, they have a small plate food menu, from appetizers to noodles and Bibimbap. \\n\\nFood taste:  I ordered the lumpia and the adobo.  As far as taste, let me tell ya, its not how my mom use to make it.  I was disappointed, the lumpia were 2 rolls cut diagonally to make it look like there was 4 on there.  The lumpia was very non-traditional, it had a pate texture, rolled onto a wrapper and then deep fried.  For the adobo, it was pulled pork on a bed of soup with 2 scoops of rice and some veggies.  Not the traditional adobo I grew up on.  \\n\\nService:  Professional and fast\\n\\nPrice:  A bit on the high side.\\n\\nWait Time:  Absolutely no wait time as we made prior reservations. \\n\\nAmbiance:  Very busy, sound effects and smoke added to the Tiki-Bar theme\\n\\nBathrooms:  Available, but did not use.  It looked like they had only 1 bathroom and a line of 2 or more people waiting to use it.\\n\\nOverall, I made the mistake of not eating before I came here.  I was really looking forward to having some authentic filipino food however it was a big let down.  I also volunteered to be the designated driver for the evening so I couldn't try more drinks on their menu.  The next time I come here, I'll just order their drinks. I feel I didn't get the most bang for my buck with their small plate menu.  I don't often go out and the Tiki-bar atmosphere was fun and different."},{"name":"Gigi's Cafe","address":"6320 SW Capitol Hwy","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Such great waffles for breakfast!

As a Redbones regular and general BBQ connoisseur, I dont get what Sweet Cheeks is trying to pull here. 7 dollars for 5 hush puppies? 10 dollars for 4 biscuits (which they were out of)?

Local beers are 6 bucks, a bit steep even for Boston. \\n\\nWe all got different \\"trays,\\" which run from 16-20ish dollars a piece and come with a good amount of food. The quality of our dinners was quite variable- my brisket cut was small and 50% fat, my friend next to me also had the brisket which was a much bigger and delicious looking cut. The pulled chicken, while salty, was absolutely delicious though. My favorite part of the meal was actually the sides- the brussels sprout salad was great, as was the mac n' cheese.\\n\\nI don't think we will be back. The waits, pricing, and overall experience just didn't impress me too much. Too much hype here- likely from the TV rep of the chef owner.

Let's start with service: I'm convinced that no one, including the owner, has worked in a restaurant before.  The service was shocking.  First, a few minutes after ordering our waitress came by to collect our credit cards.  She announced that until she received everyone's card we would not be served.    We were a group of 10 professionals in our 30s.   Her attitude towards us was very insulting\\n\\nWe sat on the rooftop which was quite nice - the only redeeming quality.  Unfortunately in the middle of the evening, the staff decided it would be a great idea to turn the tv up full volume even though only a small percentage of the customers were watching.  We had to shout over the tv to hear each other.\\n\\nNow to the food: my souvlaki arrived with no veggies, no sauce... nothing.  Just the dry meat and the pita bread.  I checked the menu and noted other souvlaki plates at our table: they all had tomato, onion, tsatsiki, etc.   When I asked for the tsatsiki and other condiments the waitress never brought them.  Most everyone's food was lukewarm to cold upon arrival.  \\n\\nWe waited on average for over an hour for our food.  All of our food was served separately and almost 20 minutes apart.  It was awkward for some people to have food while others were still waiting - but we encouraged everyone to just eat as food was served.  \\n\\nOne women ordered an appetizer and after 45 minutes she still had not received it.  We saw the waitress walking around the restaurant with the appetizer on her tray, and asked her to deliver to our table.  She responded, in a flustered manner, that she would bring it by as soon as she could.  15 minutes still later no appetizer.  It finally arrived after 20 minutes.  We are not sure what journey it took.\\n\\nProcessing our credit cards was another nightmare.  I was charged for 2 drinks that I never ordered - in fact no one at our table had ordered them. The waitress was nice enough to remove, but there was quite a bit of discussion and confusion about the billing process for all parties.  It took over 30 minutes for everyone to be able to pay.\\n\\nI would not go back to this restaurant.   Maybe in a year they will iron out the kinks.  They have a lot of work ahead of them."},{"name":"Mozart's","address":"4784 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"My husband and I had breakfast here one day recently, and it was a bit different, but very interesting.

The eggs were, well, eggs (that's a compliment - I love eggs, but there was nothing especially unique about them), and the sausage gravy was fair.  We split the meal and added a side of potatoes.  The potatoes had a nice flavor in the seasoning, but a little less seasoning would have been preferable.  Our order was definitely a sufficient amount for two, so splitting the meal kept it within our budget.  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.

Be forewarned, these are small plates and small portions of food, but the quality and richness of each and every dish more than made up for any lack of 'quantity'. \\n\\nThe two dishes we had with pork and the two dishes we had with the handmade pasta were the highlights of the show, but even the meatless dishes were so good that I can almost... almost... understand how someone could be a vegetarian (if this was all they ate).

She was hilarious. \\n\\nAll of the dishes were beautifully prepared. There was certainly care put into each and every presentation. Unfortunately, some of the dishes fell short of expectations. The seared scallop crudo with sugar snap peas and horseradish was perfect in texture yet impressively bland. The New England-style clam chowder with oyster crackers and chive actually tasted good, but the consistency was more broth-like than it was CHOWDER, and that's what made it off-putting. The fried rhode island calamari with pickled shallots, parsley, tartar and lemon was very good, but then again I expected it to be; this is a seafood joint. \\n\\nThe true standout was the grilled whole Georgia rainbow trout served head-and-all with muscadine butter and new potatoes. The fish was cleanly deboned at table-side by our waitress. This is the level I was expecting from all the previous dishes. This trout was beautifully plated. This was absolutely delectable, because of its freshness, its simplicity, and the texture contrast between the butter-like meat to the crispy skin. They truly honored this fish. Sadly though, this dish in fact made me more disappointed in the previous dishes because this is how I wanted to react to all of those dishes, not just this one. \\n\\nLure is onto something.

My father went with something called Chicken Under the Brick (or something like that) and he was not impressed. He kept looking lovingly at my meal and expressing deep regrets at his choice. The chicken looked okay but the asparagus and potatoes were burned and not good at all. Yuck. It reminded me of a lesser Olive Garden.

They were very patient with us while we waited for the remainder of our party.\\n\\nService was amazing.  I am a stickler about appropriate dining etiquette, water was always being refilled and they don't touch your glass when doing so!  Your napkins gets folded when you get up from the table.  Thank you.  Some people might think that is pretentious, however, it's just good service.  Our server was efficient and informative--the only thing criticism I have is that he had taken our order wrong and gave me a little bit of an attitude when I sent back the food.  I rarely send back food, but if I asked for the Trout Salad and you bring me a House Salad then I shouldn't have to eat or pay for it.  There's a difference between ordering the wrong item by mistake when you meant something else versus when the waiter misheard you.  We started out with Formaggio and the Trout Salad--both were very good, what's there not to love about cheese?  And I like beets and the fish was pretty fresh.  For pastas, we had the chicken Tagliatelle and lamb Cavatelli.  Daily made from scratch pastas are addictive!  We finished the meal with roasted chicken--that sweet butternut squash puree with the acidity from the artichoke and spice for the peppers was so juicy and tasty.  Everything was seasoned perfectly and had good balance of flavours. \\n\\nIt got pretty busy for a weekday and I noticed that they don't turn tables very quickly, having a reservation might be a good idea because I could see the wait might be long otherwise.

The parking lot was busy but enough people were coming and going that finding a parking spot wasn't difficult. We went in and there was a very short line waiting to order and a ton of people at tables eating / waiting for their food and a handful of people standing waiting for drinks. They also have a giant chalkboard wall where the drinks are being made and chalk for children (or adults if you're so inclined) to play. I thought that was pretty clever!\\n\\nThe menu is posted up on the wall next to you when you enter. They have their coffee menu broken down into coffee drinks, lattes, mochas, and then cold drinks. They also have a board filled with breakfast options like various sandwiches and bowls.\\n\\nWe opted for the Sweet Loraine and the Hipster Bowl. The Sweet Loraine comes on your choice of bread (I chose the fresh made biscuit), with egg, bacon, cheese, and caramelized onion. So good! The Hipster Bowl was a biscuit and gravy with a runny egg and bacon. Also very good! I would not hesitate to get either of these options again.\\n\\nThe coffees came out first. I tried the Spicy Virgin without realizing that it was a spiced coffee and didn't have any milk in it. It was much stronger than I am use to but that was my own fault for not reading the menu more carefully. I heard them call out a hazelnut pecan latte several times and went back to try it when I was in the area a few weeks later. It was good but not my favorite hot drink. I'd probably try something else next time.\\n\\nThe best part was probably the price. We each ordered a 16 oz hot drink, the sandwich, and the hipster bowl and it was under $20!

The tables were complete with personalized menus, and there was an assortment of passed appetizers and several specialty cocktails to kick off the night. After the cocktail hour we sat for a 3 course meal (caprese salad, 2 entree options of either rigatoni or salmon, a side of eggplant, and limoncello sorbetto for dessert), all of which was simply delicious. I had the rigatoni and the pasta was so tender, it felt like it melted in your mouth! All of the ingredients were fresh, and it showed.  I'd expect nothing less from O&J. Also, the menu options were endless, our selection was actually one of the more restrained (and cost-effective) choices of the bunch.\\nThe wait staff was friendly, professional, and efficient -- I think that a major element of what made the evening so great was the pacing of the courses, which the staff timed perfectly.  The appetizer trays the water glasses were never empty, and at the end of the evening checks were handed out promptly which people always appreciate.  Even after everyone had signed, there was no pressure from the staff for us to leave, which was wonderful because everyone was loving the space so much they wanted to stay and chat for a while!\\nAll in all, I HIGHLY recommend Olive & June for a private event, we will definitely be coming back!"},{"name":"Harry Buffalo","address":"6150 South Sunbury Rd","city":"Westerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Had a wonderful experience with Harry Buffalo's.

And then the heat kicked in, not the kind where you need to gulp down a gallon; just enough to get you start sipping on your bottled soda. You can also add some salsa from the salsa bar, which housed 10 different condiments. I preferred enjoying the pollo tingo with slices of jalapenos, the chipotle salsa and the chile de arbol salsa (slightly hotter), while le fiance liked the tomatillo salsa verde.

How about salsa for the chips?  Um... oh... $9.63?  Well.. um...\\"  Cashier: \\"We'll take it.\\")\\n\\nWhen I finally grabbed a table, all I'm looking forward to is drowning my awkward shame in my burrito.  So I took a bite... and it's cripplingly bland.  The ingredients were noticeably fresh, but the combination of flavors was so boring that I ended up dousing it in the habanero salsa from the toppings bar (it didn't help; I put the salsa on my bare tongue after tasting a sad dearth of flavor, and got more numbing tingle than spice).  I rewrapped more than half of it, and ended up throwing it in the back of my fridge, to be reheated in only the most desperate of hours.  Too bad.\\n\\nThe chips were what really shined.

Great idea! Started getting very packed around 530 and our waitress said they have had 3 hour waits on the weekends.\\n\\nThe food? Not a big German fan in general but some things that stood out were the pretzel with bier cheese (appetizer), sauerkraut balls (appetizer), the beer, Apple strudel (dessert), and the house salad. The others that were in my group said the entrees were a bit bland compared to Schmidtz in German Village. \\n\\nThe parking was super convenient.

The creme brulee was pretty standard (in a good way.)\\n\\nMy friend had escargots, duck confit and lemon sorbet with grey goose.

I didn't, actually, though I've done enough other writing there to fill a few dissertations. The wireless isn't always the most reliable, but it's been better in the past couple of years than it was at one point; I can remember at least one moment every visit where everyone in the surrounding corner of the room would start looking up from their laptops, glance around toward the nearest laptopfolk, and try to determine if they were the only one who just lost signal.\\n\\nI can also remember a time when the ladies' room was either broken or out of toilet paper pretty much all the time. The renovation some years ago was well-chosen and well-timed. I think they put the kitchen in around that time, too. That I have mixed feelings about. On the one hand, I love the spicy curly fries. On the other hand, it meant that weekend mornings there went from busy to sardinesque in their crowdedness.\\n\\nSome things don't change, though. The Pattycake cookies have always been reliable. I'd like to see Pattycake cupcakes or muffins there once in a while, too, but cookies will do.\\n\\nAnd the tea shelves! I've worked my way through the green tea selection more than a few times. There is no better tea in Columbus outside of dedicated tea salons. There once was a barista who remembered me and the fact that I always ordered tea. I commented to her that I must be getting too predictable. She said, \\"Well, I don't know what kind of tea you get. Maybe you mix them together, for all I know!\\"  Oh my gosh! Mix it together! That's the next plan. Oolong with pomegranate white, lapsang with gunpowder... with a couple dozen tea options, the possibilities will take a while to exhaust!\\n\\nSo they were already good, and they got better over time. Where do they still fall short? Well, their hummus has gone way downhill. Used to be, you could get hummus as a bagel condiment. Then they stopped having it available, or maybe it ran out too fast every single time I wanted it. Most recently, they had it but it tasted like it had been watered down. I never knew hummus could taste watered down before. And there are certain parts of the caf√© area that are always a couple of degrees too chilly, specifically the corner on the opposite side of the wall with the restrooms. I try to remember to bring an extra layer in case I get stuck back there.\\n\\nHowever, none of its downsides prevent me from continuing to come in when I need to remove myself from the distractions of home.\\n\\nJust a few tips to add:\\n  * If you get tea, you get your hot water at the counter and then bring the cup to the shelves on the store side of the wall. A sign there will tell you how many spoonfuls you get to stuff the little baggy thingies with. They're happy to give you more hot water.\\n  * Parking is in the back. At busy times I've had to stalk the parking lot until a space opened up, but it always comes eventually.\\n  * You may find yourself getting creative with the tables. I don't think a single one is level. So be careful when you sit, and don't put your full cup down until you're sure the table is steady."},{"name":"Supreme Fish Delight","address":"3630 Marketplace Blvd, Ste 820","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Grabbed some fish on the way to wolfcreek amphitheater.

The bartender, seeing my indecisiveness and contemplation at the menu, began pouring samples of the selections I was mulling over. \\"Here,\\" he said, \\"try them first\\" I thought this gesture was so nice especially since the place was so busy but he was perfectly patient.
