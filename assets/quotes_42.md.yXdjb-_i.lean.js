Considering the bad reviews which I was aware of going in, however, it was more of what the majority of the other people wanted and of course they're not versed in yelp and reviews. I didn't want to rain on their parade. The food actually came out in a timely manner which was appreciated considering we wanted to get in when doors opened. No water. I had to ask for it twice which irritated me a bit and hence one of the reasons for a point deduction. It wasn't busy so there is no reason why I didn't get water when asked twice. First time I can understand genuine mistake but twice? Okay that is where I draw the line.

Our waiter, Tim, told us that they've been open for only 8 weeks. Tim was very interactive and personable. He genuinely seemed to want to hear feedback. Food requires some fine tuning, but there's definitely potential based on tonight's visit. \\n\\nWe started out with the routine as our appetizer. Deep fried ramen squares covered in miso gravy, topped with cheese curd, nori and pickled ginger. We both found it to be very interesting. It was surprisingly good, but could've used more pickled ginger to balance the richness.\\n\\nFor our main, we got the pork belly served with steamed buns and the ribeye steak. The pork belly was tender with a nice smoky flavor and the steamed buns were the perfect compliment to it - soft and pillowy. However, we found the sauce to be too lumpy and starchy. Seemed like they used too much corn starch. We were both very disappointed in the ribeye as the steak looked grey. We asked for rare, but I think the steak was too thin to be cooked any rarer than medium. There was no sear or redness expected of a rare steak. Not sure if the pan was even hot when they put the steak on. The side of fries with crispy marinated Chinese donuts actually tasted better than the main protein.\\n\\nWe also got the heart attack fried rice as a side dish. We both enjoyed it. I loved the crispy chicken crackling in this dish. It sort of reminded me of a Korean bap and would've been outta this world delicious if served in a dolsot. This was too much food for two, so we had to pass on dessert.\\n\\nThe service was wonderful all around, but was rather formal. It's a handsome space, so handsome that it felt formal. The music was soft instrumental, again formal. All these elements were like a fine-dining restaurant, yet the food concept is casual, fun Asian twists on Canadian cuisine (or vice versa).

When I showed her my table tent number, and let her know the order should have been delivered to my table, she still insisted it was completely my fault and I should have come when she called my ticket number-- not my table number.

The braised short rib was really good, as was the cod with creamed corn (although the accompanying crepes were oddly crispy, browned, and folded like an egg roll). Nothing was too salty at all (in fact a few things needed a little more salt). If you like drip coffee, I suggest planning on ordering it after dinner--it is delicious (caf and decaf) and we really liked having the steel pot on the table.

The owner Mike was very nice and personable and seemed to have a strong presence with the customers. We sat in the deli next door the service was great and it seemed much less cramped on that side. The food was great, I had been craving waffles for a week and I'm glad this is where I decided to get them. Get the caramelized strawberry waffles if you have a serious sweet tooth.

I'll start by saying we were greeted warmly by both the hostess and our server.  I'm big on customer service, sometimes I'll overlook the quality of food in lieu of great service... but you won't have to here.  There are small plate options, almost like dim sum...Although, they're big enough to share.  Maybe I'm a fan because I like a little taste of a lot of things.  So .. this place was a good fit for my dining preferences.  They also have larger options.  We ordered some spring rolls, pad thai, some wings (lots of choices on wings and they're excellent .. and I'm not a wing fan!), papaya salad, green beans with pickled vegetables, and some lettuce wraps.  WE ORDERED WAY TOO MUCH FOOD .. but it was all presented beautifully and was prepared to perfection.  They have a large selection of beers, some wine, and teas.  They call it asian street fare for a reason .. it was kind of like eating off some of the best food trucks .. something spicy, something savory.. something sweet .. you get it?  There is something for everyone's taste without being generic.  The restaurant is minimalistic in decor, and very clean.  It's not fancy, but it's not fast food.  It's a magical combination of winter park dining in a low key setting .. no pomp and circumstance here .. but you will use real silverware or chopstix if you prefer!  Logistically, the parking is pretty easy.  It's a small lot, but you'll find a place.  The dining area is small as well .. but the tables turn quickly and we've either walked in, or waited a very short time.  All in all, each time we have dined here I haven't been disappointed.

As a personal preference, I dislike dishes that are sour without much else. Both the shrimp and grits are bland in nature, and so the overwhelming flavor of this dish consists of the tomato broth.

The children's menu mac and cheese came out so hot that it must have been microwaved for 10 minutes straight.  Now, this item is on the kids' menu.  It is to be served to children.

Willys Woodfired Pizza & Pub","address":"Progress Ridge Townsquare, 12345 SW Horizon Blvd, Ste 61","city":"Beaverton","stars":"2.5","text":"Let me start off this review by saying that J, my husband, and I have been waiting for this place to open for atleast the last three months. We had high hopes but expected after reading the reviews below that there might be some hiccups, understandably. Its the first saturday this place is open and wanting to have the best possible chance for a good experience we chose to go for lunch. First mistake was coming in the first week. The waitstaff seemed to be confused, stressed and just plain out of sync. I also have atleast 8 years of restaurant customer service experience under my belt so I can totally appreciate growing pains.\\n\\nSo anyway, we arrived and the place looks a little busy but definitely not crazy. We put our names on the list and are told 10-15 minutes, so we decide to sit in the bar. Mistake number two was deciding to sit in the bar, which walking in we saw no waitstaff or bartenders anywhere. We also saw three other tables full looking, all waiting to see a waiter for the first time. This waiting continued on, with all of us looking at one another confused as the bar was deserted by employees. The oddest part, was that employees serving the tables out of the bar periodically kept walking through with food orders, none of them acknowledging any of the bar patrons. Eventually a guy in a white dress shirt walks in talking loudly with a waiter obviously solving a customer issue. This we assume is the manager, who looks shocked that there are customers waiting to be served in the bar. He tries to remedy the situation by yelling at the three other employees whom have all appeared out of nowhere to serve and are now mowing each other over to grab drink orders and look busy. The place was chaos, with waiters walking different directions; faces full of confusion.\\n\\nFinally, someone comes to take our drink order which is simple enough, an iced tea and a botled bud light. The bud light arrives promptly while the iced tea took a good 15 minutes. I was told a few times it was \\"on us\\" and ended up getting two iced teas and a water when it was ready. The manager is waiting on us, so he takes our order which is a 14'' pizza half/half (we confirmed ahead of time we could do this) and a small order of wings traditional style (also supposedly wood-fired...); 10 minutes later the wings arrive, and are slightly tepid but tasted ok. Pretty sure they were previously frozen and definitely not woodfired, but oh well.\\n\\nSo the pizza arrives and its only all one style, not the half/half we order but the manager comps us another pizza with the other half we ordered so that made it a bit better. Meanwhile next to us we noticed a couple had ordered a salad and what looked vaguely like a french dip, but it was so charred beyond belief I can't verify. The man sent the dip back and refused another meal or a re-make. I can't believe a waiter would bring that out to serve, you could smell the burn in the air it was that bad.\\n\\nSo I know this is going to sound probably really nitpicky to some but I really was looking forward to this place and having a great new restaurant in the area. I think the manager was trying, but the place was not well run and there was way too much confusion for a 1pm on a saturday. J and I may or may not go back, the pizza was ok but I have certainly had better elsewhere. And definitely better service.\\n\\nMaybe give the place some time to work out the kinks, or go without high expectations. Prices were reasonable so if they work things out, it could be something special."},{"name":"Gourmands Neighborhood Pub","address":"2316 Webberville Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We like Gourmands.

The XXX chili wasn't worthy of printing a waiver on the back of the menu, but I will admit that spiciness is a relative thing - one man's water is another man's habanero.\\n\\nThe service there was excellent.

Someone said it's the Korean Chipotle and I would agree. \\nI also had the Ribeye Beef Burger which was made perfectly especially with the addition of a fried egg. Juicy and flavorful.

The collard greens were good, the bbq sauce was WAY too sweet and plentiful. The mac and cheese was gross and tasted like mayo. The service was lackluster and the setting is odd, kind of in between a barber shop and a dentists office. There was something clinical about it. Oh and the slow jams that played also added to that feeling. It was odd seeing all the stuff about black Israelites, I am not sure what they have to do with vegans, but it is an interesting collision of cultures that doesn't end too well. I am always surprised when vegan food is good- it is always food that manages to be good in spite of itself, like the child with one leg who runs a marathon.

It came with 3 different appetizers - calamari, cucumber with pig feet (don't be grossed out, it's actually really good), and little fried fishes. They all tasted really good, and the best part... IT CAME WITH A SIDE OF COTTON CANDY! Yes, I was mind blown.\\n\\nLobster with Ginger and Green Onion - For $29.99, it came with 2 big lobsters. The flavor is a little bland to my taste but the lobsters were very fresh and full of meat!\\n\\nSpicy Boiled Fish - This was probably my FAVORITE dish of the night. It came in a huge bowl covered with red chili peppers! The flavor is just amazing - it might look super spicy but it's not the Thai spicy where your whole mouth is on fire, this is more like a numbing sensation. I've had spicy boiled fish at other places before but Royal China just topped it here. The owner said that they are the only restaurant in Atlanta that DO NOT re-use the red chili peppers. So if you like spicy food, I highly recommend this dish (they also have a beef version).\\n\\nHong Kong Style Crab - The crabs were fresh and the seasoning was good. \\n\\nPeking Duck - We ordered the whole duck and the waiter sliced the meat off of the roasted duck in front of us. The whole dish came with tortilla wraps, green onions, cucumber slices, and hoisin sauce. They also made a stir fry dish with the leftover meat on the duck. However, they don't make the duck bone soup here which I was expecting. Everyone loved this dish as well!\\n\\nAs you can see, Royal China has some amazing and authentic Chinese dishes for dinner.

Fries and any toppings will cost an extra dollar, so the addition of cheese and a side of fries still made it an unbelievable deal at $4. There's so bullshit here, literally a burger with cheese, a bun and fries, this burger's got no place to hide. Best case scenario it could have been on par with Highland Kitchen, who did things the right way and made sure each ingredient was perfect. But Bukowski's doesn't seem to care, why ask how I want it cooked when it's going to arrive way overdone anyway?   There's no flavor in the beef, it's dry, cooked beyond belief, and lousy all around. The bun is very nicely toasted and being buttered helps add some flavor, but it's no saving grace. Is this just because it's a lunch time deal and the place is empty or is this what the burger is normally like? I can only judge what I've been given, and quite frankly it shouldn't matter. A burger should be good or bad no matter what time of the day it is, the lunchtime staff should be able to deliver as much as the nighttime staff, again, not my problem. The fries are crispy but have no seasoning at all, and old frying oil really imparts a bad taste.

We used to all meet there after our kids' ball games, swim meets etc....  It had a good family vibe. The servers were happy & friendly.  The food was always delicious and the service was good.  \\n\\nSomething happened at this Bertucci's last year (2013) and we have not been able to feel good about eating here since.  The servers don't seem happy working there so they don't seem to care about their customers or their jobs.    We have tried eating there a few more times to give this Bertucci's a  chance to get our business back.  Afterall, it's in a convenient location (Village Shopps) and we really want to feel that it's back to the way it used to be.  But it continues to go downhill in service.  During one recent visit there, we had to asked another server about our food because our server wasn't anywhere to be found.   Finally, our server came with half of our order.  My dish had burnt string beans.   I showed the server the string beans and she looked at me with a blank face.  She didn't even offer to replace the string beans ... I had to ask for fresh string beans.   My son's food didn't arrive until I was almost all done with my food.  His food finally arrived with my string beans.  We had to ask for water refills.  At the end, we received no apologies...just the check (and we had to ask for it).   This was an awful experience!  Too bad!  I've been coming here for years, but just can't justify spending my time and money here anymore.   You just can't count on this Bertucci's to deliver a good meal and decent service.  \\n\\nEvery once in a while we'll call in for take out and so far that's been okay.  The people who answer the phone to take the order are usually very friendly.  Haven't had an issues with the take out department.\\n\\nIf this place ever decides to do a comeback, it should post a banner stating, \\"under new management\\"  and I bet all the old timers (like my circle of friends & family)  will return & so will new patrons!"},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"During the visit in Portland, we stopped by their famous pearl district, which is a prime location for good food and beer. It is not difficult to find Deschutes Brewery on Yelp because it has excellent reviews. It was a cold weekend when we visited so a flight of beer tasters sounded fantastic. Although it is very popular and famous, I didn't expect Deschutes to be a gigantic place. When we arrived on a cold Saturday night around 5 pm, it was packed already. They have a large bar area and large dinning area. The wait wasn't too bad for us, about 30 minutes. We sat down and greeted quickly by our waiter. Since Portland is famous for their micro-brewery and beer selections, we opted to do a flight of beer and a taster of Black Butte Porter. Since I moved to San Diego, I have become a fan of craft beers. I enjoyed the creativity and playfulness in different types of beer. Personally, I liked their Black Butte Porter the best. It's creamy, strong coffee flavor, and a tough of chocolate sweet. On the side, we had three \\"small\\" plates. They are definitely good for sharing. I loved their PIG WINGS, for some reason, I thought it would be actually chicken wings. I was very wrong. This small plate was brilliant. It is tender pork shank on the bone, which was perfectly seasonable and baked. On top, we had spicy habanero-yellow tomato sauce. Wow! The flavor totally blew me away. This plate surprised with its details and bold flavors. You can't say no to a big bowl of GARLIC ROSEMARY FRIES. The fries was good, hot, flavorful. Perfect side wish with cold beer. NORTHWEST CLAMS was a good plate as well. I love the use of heavy herbs and chorizo for the soup base. Overall, excellent meal, good beers, good small plates, good vibe of the place. Given the size of this brewery, it's clear they are doing well. If you don't have time to walk around and find micro-breweries in Portland, Deschutes Brewery is a good start."},{"name":"The Arlington Cafe","address":"475 Summer St","city":"Arlington","stars":"3","text":"I'm definitely eager to try other pizza and sub joints in the area since this place is just ok.

I love hot soft pretzels. Love them, meaning they might be a favorite food. But this one is meh. Its overly greasy, and every time I've had it (3..?), it just seemed a little underdone.

Could have easily shared it, but the sandwich being as delicious as it was, I just ate the whole thing myself. (New Year's Resolution: No regrets!

If you want the quick and dirty:\\n\\nIncredible service, spicy hot italian, cold beer in appropriate glassware, fenced in dog area, loud as hell inside. \\n\\nNow for the War & Peace version: \\n\\nThe service at Bangers is impeccable. It rivals that of some of the really nice restaurants I've been to. I don't know how they managed to find these gems among the legion of relatively entitled SI folks in this this city but keep on doing it. I've been a server -- I can say that.\\n\\nI arrived solo, waiting for a party of 16. The hostess was incredibly nice and put us down for a table, explaining that I needed to have most of my party with me. They showed up in fits and starts, with her checking on us all the while and the unbelievably efficient Brett bringing us delicious beers at the cocktail area outside. Our water glasses never even got to half full and our beers were barely empty when he approached with a ready pad and an affable grin. Brett: You're now a legend among my friends. \\n\\nKeep in mind this is 7:30pm on a Friday night -- peak time for dining -- yet the hostess managed to wrangle us a huge table to sit altogether. We closed out with Brett who handled multiple cards like a champ and sat down at our table in the way back. We all ordered another round and began drooling over their insane selection of sausages. To whet the appetite, we mowed down on chili cheese fries and poutine. If you're coming here, do NOT skip these items. It's like Bangers took average pub food and sprinkled it with magic dust to make it that much better. \\n\\nThe beer kept flowing and our server was on top of it. The sausages did take a little while to arrive but the place is literally ass to elbows with people. It's only been open a week and they've got the flow down pat. My hot italian was actually hot. That might be the first time that's ever happened. I bit down and boom! heat and flavor all up in my business. Add the spicy sauerkraut. Totally worth it. The creamed corn was also a nice standout. I plan to come back and explore the menu a little further when I dont have 20 people in tow.\\n\\nHere's the one detractor: It's like being in a crowded club at that back table. I don't know whether that's how the whole space is but I was literally yelling at my dining companions. I've got a pretty piercing voice already and I had to speak so loudly that I lost my voice for most of the next day, turning me into 1-900 Kelly. There has got to be some way to mitigate that -- egg crates under the tables? On the walls? Material draped from the ceiling like so many beer halls? \\n\\nMuch has been said of the 103 taps so I wont belabor the point other than to say the flights were our go-to for price and variety. There's a fenced in dog area that's great for all of your super social pups and looks like they've got live music some nights. The five tables just as you walk outside are booze only -- no food -- so don't get confused like we almost did. \\n\\nThese guys could have created something mediocre and still been busy just as a function of location but they've created something fantastic.

This time I tried the Seoul Hot Chicken Bao and it was AMAZING. May be adding that to my list! The sweet soft bun was the perfect compliment to the crispy and perfectly hot (even though I'm not a spicy person) chicken. Must try.  \\n\\nHawkers is great for both small and large parties! Parking can be a bit of a struggle in the parking lot, but there are lots of street spots to use.

The salmon Benedict's hollandaise sauce arrived cold (disappointing, perhaps it sat out while waiting for the Classics?) and peculiarly, included the smoked salmon on top of the Canadian bacon as opposed to substituted for. In my experience, alternate Benedict's substitute rather than supplement. My step dad said he would have preferred just the salmon. The house huevos rancheros were the star of the table, though a tad overwhelmed by homefries. Beautiful presentation and extremely tasty! Would highly recommend, but maybe tone down the sheer volume of home fries. My only personal qualm was the orange juice was served with ice (who does that?). \\n\\nOverall, I'd likely give this establishment another go if we're the area, and I'd be curious to try their dinner menu.

The owner, Chris was rude when we initially expressed our concerns and thought it appropriate to explain that he \\"did us a favor.\\" It was an $8200 favor that strayed from what we agreed upon. \\n\\nAdding insult to injury, Chris' idea of portions were children's size. We had countless guests complain about being left without food. Taking it one step further he failed to supply the appropriate amount of silverware. \\n\\nJust when we thought he had done his worst he insisted that we should be paying $250-300 for trash service despite \\"clean up\\" being included in be agreement. \\n\\nIf you are considering Urban Cowboy for an upcoming wedding or event I strongly suggest you look elsewhere.

Granted it is located in one of the most expensive hotels in Boston, I had no doubts that I'd be spending an arm and a leg on a few drinks. What I didn't realize was that I was actually just paying for a rather cool metal straw in my cocktail, comfy lounge chairs, and the worst god damn service in the world.\\n\\nWhen I say pretentious, I really mean it. There are people who obviously frequents this place and more than likely are best friends with the servers and bartenders, etc. I don't care. But because of that, these servers think they are better than you and when you're a stranger in their corner, they treat you with as little respect as possible. At first, Nicholas (our server) danced up to the tight corner we were seated in and asked what we wanted to order. I told him I wanted something light but refreshing, and he either has the worst taste in the world or he doesn't know anything and just pointed at the first drink he saw on the menu. Either way, it was disgusting. Forgive me for not getting the name of the wretched cocktail.\\n\\nSo that's where the fun started. Because my boyfriend and I only ordered ONE drink each and didn't get anything the second time he visited our cozy corner, our beloved waiter warranted that it was okay to just ignore us for the rest of our time there which chalked up to be a little over an hour. The fact that he didn't stop by a third time to ask if we wanted anything else (which my boyfriend did) annoyed us, but what really took it (at least my anger) over the edge was how he would constantly ask the couple NEXT to us what they wanted and catered to their every need all the while ignoring us even though we literally waved our hands in his face. Eventually, we got fed up waiting for him so we flagged down another server and asked her to get our bill. I guess she told Nicolas because when he finally made his grand entrance, he came with our check and a nice happy \\"Thanks! I hope you had a great night *big smile*!\\" Do you really think that a smile will make us give you a decent tip? Think again, bubba.\\n\\nLeft him an $0.84 tip which I still do not think he deserves, and what's worst was that he tried to chase after us after realizing how much he got from us.

There are tables outside, too.\\n\\nFriendly, fast casual service. Order at the counter and they'll bring it to you. \\n\\nMy impression over the years is that the people who work here are fairly dedicated to their craft.

However, they explained to me how the system works: pick your food, order, pay, receive food, sit down, eat, they clean up. And they're so happy about it all.\\n\\nI got the brisket, and it was awesome. Though I hate the word, it was very MOIST, with little fat. The BBQ sauce they give you to put on it I thought was perfect, though I think they could probably leave it at the condiments station in case you want more, or maybe give you a variety. But yeah, delicious. \\n\\nOn top of the brisket, I also got beans and red potatoes on the side. Also delicious. Seriously kids, I wanted to lick the plate clean, the idea crossed my mind. \\n\\nAlso, if you have a Go Local card (like me) you get FREE banana pudding! Holler at your girl.

I had made the reservation well in advance so when we arrived we were seated immediately. \\n\\nWe started off with the Small basket of Pecan Sticky Buns and Scones as well as the Pecan Zucchini bread. We love Peans so we couldn't resister. The Pecan Sticky Buns were good once you got over how tough they were. They were flaky which made them tough to split in two but once you crunched down on your first bite it was pretty yummy. The scones were okay. The Zucchini Pecan bread was my favorite. It came to out table warm and served with Bail cream cheese, an unusual but tasty combination. \\n\\nFor entrees, my sister and I both ordered The Scrambler: French Toast, Bacon, Eggs and Breakfast Potatoes. This was really tasty! However the French Toast in this entree is different than their signature Brioche French Toast which is stuffed with Bourbon Cinnamon cream. My Mom ordered the Chicken Biscuit which looked and tastes eerily like smoked ham but she confirmed with the waitress that it was indeed chicken.. interesting. My Mom's friend ordered the Fried Green tomatoes which she enjoyed.\\n\\nNow to the bad, the really bad. I was in a hurry because I had another appointment to attend so I asked for the check to pay while the others in my party continued to brunch. I signed the non-itemized bill and left. I checked my receipt and they had mis-charged me $157.57 for a brunch for 4 people that was supposed to be $76.85.. I checked my bank account and they had processed the charge without even stopping to see that they had over charged me. No one from the restaurant called me to inform me that they caught this mis-charge or apologize instead I had to call the restaurant to let them know that I was overcharged by 205%. They said that they accidentally charged me for the table next to mine and would reverse and re-bill for the correct amount. A few minutes later I realized that I gave my waitress a 20% tip of $157 which is $30, way too much for a $76 brunch however the restaurant never asked me about adjusting the tip amount so I had to call AGAIN. I was never offered any form of compensation for their \\"accident\\" or for the mis-charge remaining on my bank account for 3 days. \\n\\nGreat food but it's a shame that they have sneaky management.

We ordered the Carmel corn and bacon and the devilled eggs as appetizers. I could have eaten both the entire night and would have been satisfied. We had the spareribs, which literally melted in our mouths, the catfish which was good but it was catfish I feel I could have made that dish, and the duck a bit on the salty side but we told our server and he indicated he would pass this along to the chef. Overall the meal was great. The sauces on the meats were very tasty. The veggies were limited. All three of us shared the 3 plates and felt like the focus was on the meat. I felt the portion size of the veggies needed to be more. It's not all about the meat. Overall, great customer service and a good dining experience.

The seafood here is consistently good, and even other non-seafood dishes have polish and taste as well. Hanako's charm derives from the fact that everything within its' menu reaches a satisfying standard, if not surpasses. But take note; the specialties here lies within the special seafood menu. There are a variety of exotic fishes and seafood that are served from the specialties menu, and as it constantly changes it is almost guaranteed that the seafood ordered from there is fresh.\\n\\nAs for the service, service here is warm and polite, and you have the option to watch the main sushi chef prepare sushi plates (which is a delight to see!)\\n\\nAnd just to list a few personal recommendations: Sockeye Salmon Sashimi, Chu Toro Nigiri, Seared Sable Fish Nigiri, Tamago Nigiri (Yes, I'm serious; Hanako has the best Tamago I've tasted in my life), Hanako Roll\\n\\nHowever, good the food may be, Hanako is one of if not the most priciest sushi restaurants within Surrey. Although the sushi here tastes amazing, sometimes the prices can feel questionable. Regardless of if you agree with the prices or not, the cost alone makes Hanako a formal dining spot instead of casual. So if you're looking for an appropriate food joint with a large group of friends for example, unfortunately, this place will probably not be your go-to spot.\\n\\nBut all in all, this restaurant, offers the best sushi in Surrey.

You'll find various street-food inspired sausage flavors as well as variants for vegetarians (they drink beer too, you know) and a few simple bistro entrees. My Boerwurst was tasty, although honestly, a little dry, but that was offset by the spicy sauerkraut and mustard toppings and dee-lich bacony german potato salad.  Next time I may try the currywurst or the kofta sausage, maybe some poutine too (I'm from Montreal and am obligated by law to try melted cheese curds wherever I see them)\\n\\nAnyways, some reviewers are already complaining about the lack of beer variety... they deserved to be kicked in balls.... twice. Yeah, maybe only half the listed beers are worthy, but that's more than I can guzzle in a night.

The only thing that bugged me about all of that was the fact that the remainder of the can of coke sat on the warm dish sanitizer and then a cook came out from the back and grabbed it to see how much was in it so she could drink it... puts her hands around the mouth of the can and then puts it back when the waitress told her it was mine. Then she proceeded to take it and pour the rest in my cup without asking. Am I being a stuck up a-hole or is that gross? You decide.

Personally i would never go back to such a place (and neither will my brother or any of my friends), and I'm being generous giving this pub one star.

The real Texas bowl of red, not a bean stew. I mean, the bean stew is good, but chili it isn't. Guy Clark knew exactly what to wish for.

I didn't want to blow my brains out and go triple-X, especially since I was about to hit the Austin City Limits Festival, but I may next time I'm in town. I ate the double-X Frito pie and found the warmth level comfortable. I was lucky enough to hang with the \\"Chili Dogs,\\" a group of Austinites who eat lunch there every Friday, after meeting one of their number at home in Hawaii at the Hilo Burger Joint. I enjoyed the chili, the conversation, the education and of course, actually being in the legendary chili parlor, which has been featured in Tarantino's \\"Death Proof,\\" Robert Rodriguez's \\"Grind House,\\" on Anthony Bourdain's Austin episode of \\"No Reservations,\\" and of course, in the iconic opening lyric of the late Guy Clark's \\"Dublin Blues.\\" YouTube it. In fact, after watching the Bourdain Austin episode again, I realize the Chili Dogs and I were in the same booth once occupied by Bourdain and his party. How cool is that? Yeah, it may be a dump aspiring to be a dive and a tourist destination -- I wouldn't call it a trap, as the chili is great, the prices are right, and they serve cold Shiner, either bock or blonde, your choice -- I prefer the Shiner blonde (premium) over its signature bock beer.

This old Chinese eatery has been around forever.  Probably way before both my dad and uncle went to college in the area. Yen Ching is one of those places that is still sticking around and always will be. \\n\\nThe first time I tried it was 6 years ago, when it was my first or second time visiting Harvard Square.  I was with my dad wandering around the square and we needed something for dinner. We walked by Yen-Ching and thought it looked like a cool authentic Chinese restaurant. We liked it and have been going ever since. Then, my dad realized that it was the Chinese restaurant his Chinese-Brazilian roommate in college took him to for Hot and Sour Soup when suffering a severe cold. \\n\\nThroughout the years, as an enthusiastic Yen-Ching diner, the restaurant has had its ups and downs. The food is generally well-prepared.  It is hot and comes out quickly.  Just this year it has had too many off moments. The last few times I have been, the service sucked. Once, the food came out all out of order, the appetizers coming after the main courses. Then another time it was impossible to get the attention of a waitress to get you more to drink or the check and the food and herbal tea was not hot enough! That is as bad as it gets folks! My family knows the true definition of good and bad service, especially my dad who grew up in a family who was in the restaurant business!\\n\\nStill, even with its bad moments, I will remain as a fan. It is an authentic place that is great for university students and professors who are craving Chinese soul food. It is basically a university hang-out place, not a big family restaurant. It is cheap and you get huge platters of whatever you order. Not like most restaurants these days that charge a lot for a skimpy portion. You must try the fried pork peking ravioli, they rock! They are actually homemade and do not come from some big dumpling factory like the ones at most Chinese restaurants. Once I even saw the waitresses sitting at the table and making the dumplings. How often do you see that? The other food, is good, but went downhill last time. For example, this spicy pork and cabbage dish did not have as much flavor and was not hot.  The white rice, did not even have flavor.  Oh well. \\n\\nI am not giving up on this restaurant.  I love the atmosphere. It is almost therapeutic having the quiet Chinese music in the background and hearing the conversations of crowds of diners. In other words, I love the energy.

Mind you, everyone looked in our direction, but no one had taken the time to ask if we'd been helped or needed seating. Not a great start. \\n\\nWe were seated at a booth by the actual hostess who had been busy in the back - she was really pleasant and apologetic, so we let the idle time we stood waiting, slide out of our thoughts. We ordered four food items, and none were too impressive. \\n\\nDonut Burger Sliders: My boyfriend is an AVID enthusiast of burgers with glazed donuts as the buns. I personally had never had such a thing but, being the foodie I am, was eager to try. These little (and I do mean LITTLE) appetizers are $11. It wasn't stated on the menu, but they only come with two... not four like you would imagine, and like what was our impression. We ordered them as was, minus the mayo, because... yuck? They were tasty, but not a good enough portion for the size or the cost. \\n\\nChicken & (Jalape√±o) Waffles: $16 of absolute horror. The waffles are four, pre-made and probably, most definitely frozen, little triangles of nothingness. I was hesitant about the jalape√±os in them, but thought it might add a nice difference/spice in conjunction with the sweet syrup. The chicken was awful. It was too salty - granted, I know chicken confit means that it's preserved with salt and cooked over a long period of time... but this is not my first rodeo with chicken confit and this was absolutely the worst one I've had. If you're going to do chicken and waffles, the chicken needs to be crispy for texture - the crunch is the best part. This chicken was sad, and gross. \\n\\nPancakes / Eggs / Sausage: My boyfriend is more of an eater, than a reviewer. It's pretty tough to mess up this kind of American breakfast staple meal. In his words, his \\"pancakes were filling, the eggs could have been better, and the sausage was decent. However, my mimosa was the best part.\\" \\n\\nHash browns: These were for my tot, who has an egg allergy. I was disappointed not only with the kids menu in general, but also lack of allergen substitutes. Nevertheless, the hash browns were okay - hard to mess up, I would imagine.

Michael's Bistro & Bar","address":"595 S 3rd St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"The gorgeous atmosphere and stellar location in the heart of German Village, near the Book Loft, make G Michael's appealing at the very onset.  You expect good service and even better food, but my experience actually bent the opposite way; the food was hit-or-miss but the service was exceptional.\\n\\nThe cold corn chowder with crab was so bland and lacking texture that I had one bite and sent it back.  Even reading \\"cold corn chowder\\" makes me wonder what I had been drinking before ordering it, so maybe it's just not my cup of...chowder.  But my dining companion agreed that it was essentially inedible as well, so take it as you will.\\n\\nA special appetizer was boar sausage with braised red cabbage, and it was easily the best red cabbage I've ever had, including from Schmidt's down the street AND in Berlin.  Considering the relative cost-effectiveness for a restaurant and sheer expertise in preparation, I hope G Michael's chooses to put it on the menu permanently.  The boar sausage was decent but the cabbage was the star.\\n\\nThe scallop appetizer was well prepared, but lacking a certain gusto; it's all right but I wouldn't order it again.  The romaine wedge salad had a tasty vinaigrette but the presentation sort of ruined it; romaine doesn't lend itself well to wedge-style salad as it's hard to cut through (especially with just a fork) and the dressing is sort of plopped on there and it's your responsibility to get the right amount of dressing on your lettuce.  Something about it was too time consuming.\\n\\nMy entree was a special of grilled rack of lamb over an arugula salad.  The lamb was delicious but slightly unevenly grilled with one chop being well done and another rare.  The arugula salad tasted good but was overly dressed and kind of soggy.  My companion's catfish entree was, for lack of a better word, awful.  Nothing about it worked.  There was no salt, no flavor; the texture of the fish didn't mesh with the overly hard crust...just a disaster.  But we were full from all of the first courses by that point that we sort of shrugged our shoulders and pushed it aside.\\n\\nJeni's for dessert was a highlight, as it always is, and saved our overall impression of the food despite the restaurant holding no ownership of it.  But the service was affable, efficient, and well-timed, and based on the supreme success of several courses I'd go back to see what else it has up its sleeve."},{"name":"Soul Vegetarian No  2","address":"652 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Awesome bbq tofu paired with amazing vegan tofu and broccoli.

The space is nice and large, but there's not quite enough seating to fill it. A pool table and Big Buck Hunter are practically crammed into one corner (pool and video game players have to jostle for space with each other and with people at the tables nearby) while the other side has a few high tables with chairs in a sea of open space. There's a shuffleboard table along one wall with two pinball machines in the back corner, and a narrow patio out the back door. The overall ambience is typical Portland dark bar, with unidentifiable rockish/punkish music playing at a volume that you just barely need to shout over to be heard by the person sitting next to you. The staff are surprisingly friendly and attentive for being as pretty as they are. The beer list is as long as it should be for a bar in this city, and there is a fully stocked bar for cocktails and mixed drinks. The food menu has a fair amount of variety, with plenty of snacks and larger plates to have a full meal. I had the pulled pork sandwich, which was delicious.

I didn't really know what I wanted so I drove around and stumbled into this Zaxby's.  Now I like Zaxby's a lot so I thought I had hit the jackpot.  I was right....i hit a jackpot of late night tomfoolery!  When I walked in the young lady at the front counter seemed a bit discombobulated.  She was trying to handle too many customers at a time instead of simply breathing and handling each person one at a time.  As a result, I waited to even be acknowledged longer than I should've because she somehow thought that i had ordered already in her whirlwind of thoughts that were faster than her body could process.  Now I always order the saaaame dang thing when i go to Zaxby's...a large Wings n' Things.  I attempt to order just that and the young lady tells me, \\"We're out of wings!\\"  Wait...hold up...rewind...what?!  How the heck are you a place that is known for wings but you're out of wings?!  Like are you joking? Like really?  I was kinda irritated but I realize that it's not this young lady's fault that they are out of the premier product of the store.  I then order a chicken tender basket and an birthday cake milkshake.  My order takes forever to come out but at this point i'm just happy to have food at this.  I drive back home ready to dive into my food.  I bite into a chicken tender and I lie to you not, it is the saltiest thing i've tasted in a looooong time!  It tastes like they add seasoning to an already somewhat salty product which makes the taste almost unbearable.  You're out of wings at this Zaxby's location and then you kill the chicken tenders too.  I don't know what's going on at this location but it's definitely a sign of bad management, under trained employees, and just all out disappointment to the brand that Zaxby's is trying to represent.  And it just had to be at THIS location(area where much isn't expected)...i'll let you read into that however you want but this location is definitely not a great representation of Zaxby's.  I wasted $10.39.  As to not end on a sour note..the milkshake was the only decent part of this meal.

The decor with all of the wood and random antiques that you would find in a traditional Southern home was a very nice touch. Similarly, the waiters were fairly attentive with refilling water and quick to bring the food out. However, the loud rodeo - style music could be turned down a notch as I could barely converse with my friend during the meal.  The pimento cheese popovers were great as the bread was perfectly soft, buttery, and had massive pockets of air while the salted butter and spiced honey served as a great dip (tasting suspiciously like pizza, not that it's a bad thing). The silver queen hushpuppies were warm and buttery to the core upon arrival. The waffles were a decent size and covered with cane syrup. Overall, the sides were great. On another note, the hot chicken was slightly disappointing. It definitely passed the eyeball test in that the chicken was dry rubbed spice. The chicken was also very juicy. However, the chicken itself wasn't as spicy as I initially projected and felt that the medium spicy at another type of chicken establishment in Boston was spicier. The meal itself was pretty hefty with the sides costing $7 a pop.

They ruined my hair and the manager (KP) isn't helpful at all. The manager needs to learn business ethics. Instead of being arrogant KP, perhaps you should be more understanding to your clients.  The towels used smelled stinky and the their complimentary water had 2 dead fruit flies floating in it. Also, I had a chemical burn due to the solution they used on my hair. The burning sensation lasted a few days and I ended up with a scab. I was unsatisfied with their service and the manager said I had to pay extra $ to fix it. I don't understand why I have to pay more for unsatisfactory service? In short, no refund AND you have to pay more to fix it. I would never go back to this salon. I found a better, higher end salon just a few miles away that was able to fix my hair. You can keep the money you stole from me because you didn't provide the right service.

A breakdown of this table service restaurant:\\n\\nService Area 9/10\\nLike a few other locations in the Portland Metro area you're unable to call in advance to reserve a spot and on busy days prepare for up to a 30 minute wait.. but trust me it's worth it! The staff is attentive and welcomes you promptly. Seating is limited while you wait but you're welcome to either the bar area or wander close by - which is what my colleague and I did, we slid into the bar on the corner and had just enough time to order one drink.\\n\\nOrdering 10/10 & Selection 8/10\\nOnce it is your turn to be seated you won't wait long at all before being greeted by your waiter/waitress. They are quick to provide water and incredibly knowledgeable of the menu. If you're given time to think you won't be left stranded once you've made your decision. We make customized flights that are prepped and brought to you in no time at all and the fries are always hot and delicious. In terms to main course food items they have a fairly decent selection but you may find yourself wanting to go somewhere else for desert as they have great choices but it may not hit home with everyone.\\n\\nService 10/10\\nAll the way from the door in to the door out no matter where you are in this establishment you will receive superb service. The staff is friendly, informative, prompt and seems truly happy to help.\\n\\nAtmosphere 9/10 \\nIf you take a moment to truly look at distance between tables and how many people can be seated here as well as the proximity to the chefs area some of the seating is you would assume that you would need to be yelling at the person across from you, but that's not the case. The owners have done a phenomenal job at filling the space in a way that regardless of how busy the location may be, you're able to comfortably focus on who you're with and not be constantly distracted by those around you.\\n\\nCleanliness 10/10\\nFrom the time you enter to the time of being seated you can see the honest effort the staff members do in ensuring that if a mess arises it is cleaned immediately and in a manner that doesn't disturb those around them. Also for being such a busy establishment the bathrooms are even in tip-top shape, and ladies there's never a line.\\n\\nOverall I would definitely recommend to both the avid beer drinkers as well as those that aren't. The assortment of selection and how it can be presented to you makes it an equally pleasant experience for both beer drinking types. The food is fresh and served hot, the service is impeccable -- the initial wait is absolutely worth it."},{"name":"Local Roots","address":"15 E Olentangy St","city":"Powell","stars":"4","text":"This was THE worst experience ever.

Inedible for sure and a total culinary embarrassment for a proper Thai place. \\n\\nThe actual entree was visually appealing and overall wasn't horrific in flavor etc. However, I had asked what the healthiest entree was and that's what I ordered. The tofu was fried and overly oily and generally ruined any possibility of healthy eating. Maybe that's the healthiest they have, but it wasn't even close to my expectation of steamed veggies and tofu. \\n\\nThe service from the bartender was laughable, actually thought it was a joke at one point.

It doesn't go as long as other places in town and the menu is very small, but it is good and well worth the trip over.  I'm not saying you should drive across town to come here, but if you are in this part of town, the happy hour here is pretty good.\\n\\nI'm going to start with the dessert because it was really damn good.  We actually didn't order the version of this that is on the happy hour menu.  We were too late for that so we ordered the small version of the Nutella Calzone ($8 small, $14 for large).  We asked our server how big the small was and he said it was huge.  We asked if the small is huge how big is the large.  He said the large is stupid.  Between 3 of us the small sized calzone was plenty big.  If you like Nutella and you like calzones, you will really like this dessert.\\n\\nFor food we ended up getting 4 of their happy hour pizzas.  1 Margherita, 1 Marinara, and 2 Salame's.  Along with that we got 2 Antipasto Plates.  Each of these items are $5 on the happy hour menu.  \\n\\nThe Antipasto Plates contained various meats and cheeses, olives, focaccia and Mama Lils Peppers.  The Marinara pie is sans cheese, the Margherita has mozzarella and the Salame is more or less the Margherita with salame piccante.  You could probably do very well with one of these and an Antipasto Plate if you were by yourself and have a very filling meal.  \\n\\nVia Tribunali is a chain.  Not major.  They have outposts in Italy (that is good, yes?), Seattle and New York as well.  This is what I imagine most pizza is like in Italy.  Not the NY style I grew up with, but very good.  Might be worth it the next time to check out the regular menu.  It is quite large and pizzas are in the $11-$18 range which doesn't seem too expensive.\\n\\nGood service, nice location and a nice setting to have some pizza with some good friends.

The problem was, there was nobody at the station to seat us, and the two waitresses that were just standing around by the bar area didn't even bother to tell us where he was or even greeted us. They were just busy standing around, talking, and watching TV. I was getting impatient because I was tired from walking around the whole day. I waited a few more minutes before the host showed up and from here on, my experience changed dramatically to the better.\\n\\nAfter we were seated and asking us if we'd been here before, he told us about the popular dishes to get, took our drink orders, and told me about who would be taking care of us and left.

I was only disappointed that it probably took another 5 minutes before anything else came out. I kind of wanted to eat the fried rice with some chicken satay and egg rolls and not plain.

I would have exchanged the beers but the waitress took forever to come around so we just drank the wrong beers.\\n\\nMy gf got the caesar salad which was awesome. One of the best I've had in Atlanta actually. The dressing was creamy and had a slightly spicy bite.\\n\\nI got two lobster \\"tacos\\" for $13. When these finally came out I was shocked. They were tiny (see my photo) and looked more like appetizer spring rolls than normal sized tacos. They didn't come with any sides and left me hungry. The \\"tacos\\" themselves were actually pretty tasty, but the tiny portion left a bad taste in my mouth.\\n\\nMy gf got the hickory bacon bbq burger and enjoyed it. I took a bite and it was juicy with crunchy bacon. She'd definitely order it again.\\n\\nSo, overall a mixed bag. Great burger and caesar salad, but the missing waitress and minuscule size of the lobster tacos brought the meal down."},{"name":"Ebisu On Robson","address":"827 Bute Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I really like it here!

This is where it went downhill... 2 different servers helped our table and someone forgot to put our food order in.  All the other tables who sat down after us got their food first, but none of the servers noticed we were the only ones without food.   We have sat down for an hour now and asked where our food was.  This is when they started to panic and found out what happened.   They came by 2 more times to confirm our order and told us kitchen is rushing our food out.   The tables around us were done eating and paying their bill before we got our food, we were getting pretty embarrassed at this point.  No snacks were offered while we waited longer, they did offer another coffee on the house but we didn't care about that.   Our food came and it was delicious, this is why it deserves the 1 star to be honest...   They offered a free dessert for their screw up but we ended up getting a discount on our entire bill, which should have been offered in the first place.  But we found out later on that there was no manager on duty to handle any tough situation.

Shanghai Morning Restaurant popped up as a good choice on Yelp.  As others have pointed out, the XLB was excellent.  Yes the skins are a little on the thick side, but the advantage there is they don't break while you are trying to get them from the steam basket to your spoon.  We also had the fried wontons with a vegetable and pork stuffing, which is a slight variation from the usual dumplings.  Chicken sir fried with soy sauce, a rather generic description if ever there was one, was quite tasty.  The only disappointment was chicken with crispy rice dish that comes with a sweet and sour sauce.  The crispy rice is a set of 2x2 squares of rice that they pour the the sweet and sour sauce (with very little in the way of chicken) on.  My wife had expected something else when she ordered it.

Nice sauce but if anything the scallops were a little overcooked ie slightly chewy rather than melt in your mouth.\\n\\nThe bad: Things went downhill rapidly when the entrees came out. My wife's Beef Wellington was obviously not cooked. The pastry did not look at all appetizing and was raw. How the chef ever let it out of the kitchen I have no idea. While the Beef was sent back to try again, I got stuck into the duck. It was duck meat off the bone, wrapped in Duck skin and roasted. It looked great, the skin was really Crispy, but the meat had the texture of pulled pork, but drier. It had obviously been overcooked, perhaps sitting under the heat while the Beef Wellington was not cooking. I did eat half of it. But couldn't eat it all. It was too dry. Where was the promised green pepper sauce?\\n\\nThe Beef Wellington came back out but was now a big mess.

Afterwards, we were practically starving, having drove about an hour-thirty in, and then walking the exhibit, so we decided to try a new place for lunch. After looking through the nearby Directory by the parking deck, Rosa Mexicano was it.\\n\\nThe first impression walking in - this place is fancy! Now, I know we are in Union Station in Atlanta, but this is a Mexican Restaurant, and traditionally, Mexican is not fancy. But this place was HUGE, bright vibrant colors, a mix of modern and traditional design, and just a bit up-scale. Niccce... \\n\\nSo, not too packed, not too busy, around almost 2pm on a Saturday, and we are seated at a nice little booth. I notice the cute plates, which apparently feature amata gods, and a traditional ethnic pattern; the same design is repeated on the walls in some copper decorations. There is also a more modern installation on a blue divider, featuring a series of plastic white figures diving. (One friend, from our position at the far table, thought they were birds.) Interesting!\\n\\nThe staff were pleasant and friendly, and brought us water, and chips and salsa. We were asked if we would like some guacamole, and we happily obliged. I DO wish we had realized the extreme price for this appetizer before asking for the addition. Nonetheless, the gauc was good, and prepared for us table-side. It was then presented to us in a lava-rock mortar bowl. We asked for medium spiciness, and I will say... it was definitely spicy! I am not sure how they rate the spiciness, and next time I will ask for no spiciness, or perhaps mild... because the medium set all of our lips on fire! Can we have fire hose's table-side as well, por favor???\\n\\nThe selection for a Mexican restaurant seemed scant, however, on par with an upscale restaurant, so it worked. And I do appreciate the labels showing vegetarian and gluten free. I DO wish there were better descriptions or just a tad more options, as I am vegan/whole food plant based, and would have liked to know better what my options were without feeling like I was irritating the staff, but I made do with what was available, and feel like I found a good option with their Hongos.\\n\\nHongos: Grilled portobello mushrooms, black bean, roasted red and yellow\\npeppers, grilled corn, cabbage and chile de √°rbol salsa...\\n\\nThe corn was AMAZING!!! I am not sure it was entirely vegan, however... And this makes me wary of ordering it again. It was definitely needed to balance out the spicy hotness of the tacos, however. Is everything served here so HOTTTT?!?! My companions all said the same of their meals, as well. At least we had plenty of water, which tasted amazingly refreshing and clear, even before we started tasting all the hot menu items.\\n\\nNote to self: Next time, order gauc, not spicy. Order Hongos, no chile de arbol salsa. And don't eat the corn, or insist it is JUST corn that you get... perfect. \\n\\nAll in all, I spent about $20 on my meal, including my portion of splitting the guacamole appetizer four ways. And the atmosphere was nice, the staff friendly. Wait time for our food was  about the same as other restaurants I have been to, no better or worse.

It was all hustle and bustle during our Saturday lunch.

The octopus came out first. We were a bit surprised that they arrived in dumpling/ball form. I wasn't expecting such big octopus balls. I mean, how does he sit down? (Ba da dump!)\\n\\nThe balls had a subtle octopus flavor, but they didn't blow us away.  The rest of the meal arrived. Of the two, our fav definitely was the beef chow fun--beefy and definitely not a greasy as most places.  The rice casserole was good, but I'm not sure what we were expecting. To tell the truth, after looking at it, Cindy and I concluded that we've both accidentally made similar dishes ourselves since, as Asians, we've experimented with putting stuff in rice as it cooked. Granted, the claypot definitely adds a smokey flavor to the dish which is probably missing from my $8 Emerson Electric rice cooker. Still, I expected something a little more complex.

For dinner, my girlfriend got the Seafood Bruschetta (picture included) and I got the Waxy Burger (no picture because it didn't even look appetizing). The Bruschetta was a concoction of shredded salmon, tuna, and diced peppers mixed with what tasted like mayo and topped with pieces of seasoned shrimp all on top of a piece of sliced bread served with what tasted like 1000 island dressing. We expected it to be a warm dish but it was actually cold. That doesn't change anything as it was still very delicious. As for the burger, I ordered mine medium rare (as that's the only way beef should ever be cooked) and it came out well done. It was inedible and tasted like wax... I guess the name was fitting. The fries came out cold and the pickle spear... well... it was just a pickle spear. The overall service was great. The atmosphere is nice and the waitress was very friendly and on top of her game.

When we did get a table the waitress informed us that the dishwasher was having plumbing issues so they were using mainly paper products that night.  Interesting.  The use of paper, styrofoam, and utensils wrapped in plastic (napkin included!) made me feel like I was at an indoor picnic but at least Mario's and its wait staff let everyone know the situation rather than make its customers believe this was the norm.  \\n\\nThe menu is not extensive but did offer calzones which for whatever reason I have had trouble locating around the area so I ordered a broccoli and chicken one.  The wait was not too long and the food came out at just the right temperature (on a real dish with a real knife thankfully).

The tortillas were good and the guacamole was average to good.\\n   The bad:  I had ordered fajitas for two, the sides were for one and my one request to keep the cheese on the side was not done ( wife cant eat it). The peppers and onions were actually just oily onions ( no peppers) and barely cooked. There were very few of them as well.   The queso was straight from the can and the smallest size possible. The THREE huge bags of chips they sent (overcompensating???) were like crispy tortilla crumbles that I could crust some chicken in. Did they have a round of footy and misplace their ball?

We were shown our booth with an offhand wave (not walked to it) and then we were actually asked if we would \\"still be needing these,\\" meaning the menus we were holding!  Our first waiter (because yes, there were several grim hipster servers who tag teamed our table) was bewildered by simple questions like \\"can I get a 1/2 caff cup of coffee?\\" and \\"what is in your signature 5 flower soda?\\"  Nobody seemed to care if they got anything right.  And they didn't.  One drink order was forgotten, then, once delivered, had to be sent back because it was bad.  Two of the dishes that were ordered were not prepared as described in the menu (instead of a green chile sauce they were served with a red chlle/mole sauce).  Finally, we received our bill and gave waiter X our credit card. When he came back with the charge slip, we noticed the amount he charged was higher than on the bill he gave us.  It seems he left one of our drinks off the bill (his error) and rather than explain that he needed to adjust the bill, he took the card and charged a higher amount with no explanation. Here's the kicker:  2 hours after we left we received a call from the hostess saying that she noticed we had a reservation for 10:30 PM, but that they closed at 10:00 PM.  We explained that our reservation was for 10:30 am (made via phone) and that we had already eaten at their establishment that morning.  And checked in with her!

Unlike many other buffet places where you get up to get your food & come back to your table; this buffet style is you filled it out on the paper and the server will bring all the stuff you placed an order from your paper. I can't take a picture of everything so I only had 3 pics. \\n\\n1) Ambiance/AtmosphereÔøΩ? I like the atmosphere, seemed fun to hang it out, having hot-pot and talking and slowly enjoying the food. Perfect for the cold weather. People areÔøΩ?talking & laughing in the background but it wasn't that loud. But the smell from the steamy hot-pot is not that great; it's actually stayed on my clothes for a whileÔøΩ? \\n2) Cleanliness. - a little messy; but it's AYCE, it's kinda crowded, & it's hot pot so...it's understandable. \\n3) Greetings. Ehhhhhhh...it's alright. I rarely have a ‚Äãvery welcoming greeting in an ‚ÄãAsian place. \\n4) Services/Server. The date we came, look like they are busy with a ‚Äãlimited server but overall, it wasn't that bad about the waiting. However, I really don't like how they kept saying Chinese to us and we talked English back to them. We don't understand Chinese so we had no idea what they were saying. In my opinions, if you have any questions, I think you can figure it out. If you have food questions, just try to order it and you will see because the server sometimes hasÔøΩ?a little tough time from the explanation. Unless you are Chinese is different. \\n5) Food. \\nThe hot pot is divided into 2 parts for your soup base choice. We got spicy & nutrition broth. Whatever you would like for your hot-pot, you just filled out on the paper and give to the server - meats, veggies, noodles, & others. We did orderÔøΩ?some buns but not that great. They will put those stuff in a rolling cart and leave right beside on your table. They have the sauce bar which I tried a little bit of everything (fermented sauce, peanut sauce, soy sauce, oyster sauce, seafood sauce, special sauce, sesame oil, garlic sauce, and other things such cilantro, green onions, onions - all chopped..but overall I stick special sauce with sesame oil). Those sliced meats are my favorite. \\n\\nBottom Line: The food is good but the server and service areÔøΩ?average. Nice place to hang with your group or catching up with your friends but don't sit there for over 2 hrs. I hope the servers know more English, don't have to be fluent, just basic and simple stuff to serve customers.

The first time my colleagues and I attended the restaurant, we ordered drinks and were reviewing the menu, only to be told that 80% of the menu was unavailable due to a kitchen fire over the weekend. I feel this should be communicated to patrons before they sit down and give their drink orders. We thanked the waitress and left in search of an operational kitchen.\\n\\nThe second time we attended, we ordered drinks and were reviewing the menu again when we were told that the kitchen was still not fully operational. This was after I had asked upon walking in the establishment if the kitchen was up and running again to which I received confirmation that it was. Disappointed again in the lack of communication, we decided to stay this visit as they at least had the burger and steak sandwich our group wanted to try. I got the burger and upgraded my chips to fries while a friend got the steak sandwich with chips with our intent being to split our sandwiches to try both.\\n\\nWhile waiting on our food, I reviewed the drink menu which I found to price beer above all the neighboring restaurants and bars on the same street. Speaking of menus, it should be noted that the food menu is quite limited without much variety.\\n\\nThe food arrived and the burger and fries looked delicious whereas the steak sandwich was primarily bun and egg. At that point I was glad I did not order only the steak sandwich as that would have left me quite unfulfilled and still hungry upon finishing it. The burger was cooked medium to my request and was a good burger, but it had no wow factor. There was nothing special about to make it stand out among the dozens of burgers that are available downtown. The fries were large like steak fries and were quite tasty; I'm glad I opted for them instead of the house chips. The steak sandwich has a minuscule amount of steak on it and tasted primarily of the egg which came on the sandwich. When asked how our meals were, we explained we felt the steak sandwich to be lacking but were simply told the meat is portioned out. \\n\\nThe waitresses were pleasant and attentive but the food was nothing exceptional and the second limited kitchen experience combined with an overall limited menu made the overall experience lackluster at best.

The one thing Three Amigos does not have is espresso. And I wanted something to eat but I wanted a cappuccino with it so I Yelped and found this place. \\nMy cappuccino was more of a latte but I knew it was going to be like that cuz I could hear the steaming wand and it wasn't steamed properly.  But that just means that the person using the wand just wasn't trained on how to properly aerate milk for Cappuccino. And I can forgive that as long as it's got the right kind of shots in it. Unfortunately I could barely even taste the espresso which should not be the case.  At least if it's on an espresso machine. I suspect it was an automated espresso machine. Or even worse possibly a pod. Which makes me want to cry. If it was hand tamped it wasn't done so correctly so possibly this is just a learning moment to make sure that everyone knows how to pull appropriate shots, Tamp them correctly and steam milk correctly for whatever beverage is being ordered. But I'm a coffee snob so I apologize for sounding so harsh about a cappuccino. But if you're going to charge $4-5 for a cappuccino I expect it to be a proper cappuccino. \\nBut on to the breakfast. I ordered a veggie omelet and it was very good actually. The veggies were not overcooked they were cut small enough that it was easy to eat.  My only complaint is the eggs. They tasted fine but were overcooked and were not Fluffy at all. And it could have used more cheese. \\nI splurged and got a side of bacon and even though I ate my bacon it was quite obvious that it was bacon from one of those microwavable bacon packs that you buy in the supermarket.

We actually asked the waitress helping them because they first moved tables a couple of times and we were wondering if they were okay! I strained to participate in conversation with my best friends because we were surrounded by tables of 8 - 10 people. \\n\\nI think this may be rectified if you have a reservation however, because for some reason we were squeezed in this area but as soon as I needed to use the restroom, I noticed the back of the restaurant was ample seating for sets of 2's & 4's.

I would not call Bouchee \\"cheap eats\\" however but it's priced as any other Newbury Street restaurant might be priced. \\n\\nWe started out with the warm Olive Plate as well as the Fresh Tomato, Garlic, Basil, Arugula and Parmesan. I should warn you right off the flat bread is big enough to serve at least 4 - 6 people depending on how many pieces everyone wants to have!

They serve it in the cutest wrought iron skillet and I could not keep my hands off of these delicious treats!\\n\\nFor dinner I ordered the Brasserie Steak - I like mine medium well and while I read it was a Hanger Steak I did not read about the side dishes that came with it. I was DELIGHTED to find finger potatoes and a side of arugula salad. What's so delightful you might ask, well, the salad was just salad but those finger potatoes were cooked with some special seasoning, cut down the center and possibly seared in a frying pan after being cooked. I gobbled those delightful things right down my throat! I even went to the farmer market the next day to buy the same potatoes, but alas, cannot replicate their delicious flavor!\\n\\nI've had better steak to be honest with you. This was a bit chewy for my taste but the flavor made up for it and I found my palette licking my lips afterward. \\n\\nNeedless to say, the meal was fit for the queen that I am and we certainly enjoyed every bite of food.

Then the chef (found out later he was the main chef, seriously?), a tall african american guy walked out of the buffet area and screamed at us \\"Can you please move!?\\" My sisters and I were all shocked at his nasty manner. The entrees were below average. Mashed potatoes, different types of meat, fish, veggies, etc. Although it was a buffet, I felt disgusted with the food I could not even go for a second. \\n\\nThe DJ noted that we could request any songs. So my group requested Miley- Party in the USA, and guess what ? The DJ did not play it. The DJ WAS HORRIBLE! At first he'll play pop, then he'll play 60's music.

Not a bad deal and not a terrible idea for a cold night in Atlanta. I saw this restaurant pop up on Yelp this week and instantly made plans to eat here on Thursday night. \\n\\nI called the restaurant ahead of time, and the hostess answered in Chinese (so be warned, all she is saying is the restaurant name). I asked about a reservation for 4-5 at 6pm, but she only kept responding that I should just try to get there early. Later, I found out that they don't accept reservations for parties under six people. I realized how crucial it was to get there early as about an hour into our meal, I noticed the line was getting ridiculous as people lined up against the wall of the entrance. It almost made me feel bad about eating the full two hours...\\n\\nSidenote: 4 TV's in the middle of the room that can be seen from any angle. Pretty nice.\\n\\nYou order from a paper sheet which you write your number of each item you want in the blank space beside it. There is quite a variety of meat ranging from beef, lamb, fish  and chicken to innards and frozen fish balls. There are the usual vegetables that are found on a menu in a Chinese restaurant. What I found interesting were the random baked goods that you would usually find at a Chinese breakfast, such as xiao long bao, fried dough (sorry that is more descriptive, I'm not sure of the translation in English), and fried crullers (I hope that is the accurate translation from Chinese)... They also have handmade noodles, so give those a try!\\n\\nWe ordered two different broths, the spicy broth and the normal basic broth (the nutrition broth). The spicy broth was ON POINT. Not as spicy as I would have liked, but the flavors were rocking. They don't refill the spicy broth but they do add more of the nutrition broth, which I believe is the base for most of the soups.\\n\\nNow I must comment on the service, unfortunately. They are just a hot hot mess right now.They have no way to keep track of who ordered what (although the sheets are clearly marked) and which order is going to who. Not only that, they just stack the sheets on top of each other and our table watched them struggle and squint at the order forms, trying to figure out if they had already delivered that order to that table already or not. It's just a mess, unfortunately. I wish I knew what kind of solution to give them, but this is obviously not the right way. We were constantly waiting on meat or our pastry goods and never got them unless we asked the one guy who was working the tables. The girls seemed very ineffective. We didn't get half our dishes...\\n\\nI advise waiting a couple months before trying this place, as I have already told a few people who were planning on coming here. This place has a lot of potential and I believe it can get there. They just need to get it together. It's not a full two hours of eating if we have no food to eat (as was our experience). It was more excusable when there was a full house, but at one point, we were one of six tables versus one of twenty in the restaurant... and the service didn't budge.

She told us about how Jack Allen's roots and their philosophy of having food go straight from the farm (farmers market on Saturday) to the table (brunch) on Sunday plays a large role in the success of the restaurant! All this effort it takes in finding the freshest ingredients of the season truly pays off. Not to mention the ambiance\\n\\nMost brunches are pretty \\"breakfast heavy\\" and by that, I mean, lots of different styles of eggs, your basic meats of ham, sausage or bacon, and starches. Here, the brunch is definitely more \\"lunch heavy\\" and less of those regular items that you'd see at brunch. Trust me, you won't miss the eggs, bacon and toast when you are here. The plethora of food served on the buffet line is simply delectable in every fashion and the fresh ingredients sure made a huge difference on my taste buds!\\n\\nI'm not sure if the brunch menu changes every weekend but make sure to make reservations (even if it's just for a table for two) so that you can try these dishes: \\nChicken Fried Chicken- perfectly tender on the inside, and crispy on the outside\\nChicken fried pork tenderloin- fried goodness on a plate.\\nMigas\\nLayered enchilada casserole\\ngreen chile pork and eggs\\ntomato basil pie- oh my goodness, fresh tomatoes, fresh basil.

Not mushy at all.\\nJalapeno sausage- just the right amount of kick to them, juicy, and savory\\nMama's sunday chicken- a stewed juicy chicken that melted in my mouth. You don't need teeth to eat this chicken! \\nHouse cured ham- SO much better than regular ham! I can't explain it, but they know how to house cure a ham like a master here.\\nFresh fruit- melons, and grapes. YUMMY! Got myself a huge bowl.\\nSalad- all types of salad. My favorite was the brussel sprout salad. I couldn't get enough of these little things!\\nFresh squeezed orange juice- and I thought HEB fresh squeezed orange juice was the best...

On our first and only visit, my wife, friend, and I gave our name and were given a 45 minute wait time. When you're hungry, this is an eternity but our friend had hyped it up so we decided to be in it for the long haul. They had a cucumber water cooler outside for those waiting, which would have been great except it was practically empty the entire time. To no fault of Joy Cafe, patrons were also using the disposable cups and then putting them back on the table, upside down, and other people would come up unaware and use them. I stopped at least two people from doing it.\\n\\nWell, 45 minutes turned into almost double that. They have a weird way of moving the seating priorities around - we only had three people so they skipped us instead of adding an extra chair to a two-top (and, yes, they did have a stack of spare chairs in the corner so it wasn't that they didn't actually have extras to use) and at least one party behind us got seated at a four-top because they had an extra person. I've never seen a three top before, so I'm not really sure what the issue was - we were, of course, sat at a four-top eventually.\\n\\nAfter that whole thing, you can be dang sure we knew what we wanted to order but it took like 10 minutes for someone to come over. \\n\\nThe food definitely improved the situation; I'm pretty sure it was because it was delicious BUT  we were all hangry at this point so I can't be 100% sure. The muffins that came out - apple, corn, and something else - were A+. I could eat these little guys all day. I ordered half sweet, half unsweet tea and it was some of the best tea I had on my trip to Georgia. Just a real good ratio - you'd be surprised how many places can't quite get it right.\\n\\nThe shrimp and grits were legitimately great. The cheese and corn made it creamy and chowder like. It had a little spice but I topped it off with the hot sauce anyway. There was also a generous amount of shrimp on it, which is a huge plus. The only downside to the meal was that I had to peel the tails off and, considering they were covered in grits, oil, cheese, etc., it was a tad messy.

No matter, we found two spots at the bar.  The one strong suite of HHS over the past few years has been their bar service, so the fact that our drinks were excellent and the spot on recommendation by the bartender to try the new fried green tomato fries appetizer, was not surprising.  The drinks here are the real draw for me, love the ruby slipper on a hot summer day!   \\n\\nHubby got the burger and I got the porkbelly small plate w/ a side of roasted brussel sprouts for dinner.  Both were excellent, and perfectly prepared and came out of the kitchen rather quickly.

One bite though, and I had buyers regret. \\n\\nFood wasn't hot, only warm. Pork wasn't crispy. Sauce wasn't sweet or sour enough.  Same with their sweet and sour soup. Ginger beef was breaded a little to thick. Basically the idea was there. You know it's supposed be a sweet and sour pork dish, but the execution wasn't good. I'd say the quality would be of T&T take out tier, or maybe even less... because I never seemed to get buyer's remorse for an $8.50 meal at T&T.

Maybe they should drain the oil first before mixing in the other ingredients?\\n\\nTheir Tom Yum Soup is ok.  It has the right amount of spice but I think they overdo the fish sauce a bit. It probably would taste better if they used half the amount of fish sauce (and if they don't use fish sauce, something they add is making it taste fishy).

My potato salad was the worst i have ever tasted, it tasted like it had turned bad, but others that tried it said it was just not good. It also tasted like there was something else mixed in, from a different side. One of my friends got the banana pudding and said it had traces of potato salad in it. Needless to say I did not feel good that evening from eating gluten contaminated food. I had the moist brisket and pork ribs. The brisket was ok, a bit lacking in flavor but juicy. The ribs were a little on the firm side for my taste, not a lot of smoke flavor but eatable. The two stars is a stretch, and based mostly on the meat, the sides would be a negative rating.

Within 3 blocks of my apartment are Mama Mimi's, Gatto's (which I still haven't tried), and Hungry Howie's, and 5 blocks from Hound Dog's.\\n\\nWhat truly wins at Hungry Howie's (and what almost tempted me to give it 4 stars) is the deal. This may sound incredibly cheap of me, but the fact that I only paid $5 for a medium pizza which feeds both Rachel P. and me actually makes it taste a little better for me! The amount of food we get for $5 is pretty close to what Mama Mimi's gives us for $10 (two small pizzas at $5 each), without a HUGE taste difference and we don't have to bake it ourselves. WIN!\\n\\nAs for the pizza: it's not too shabby! Is it the best pizza I've had in Columbus? No. But it hits the spot on a wet rainy day. The pizza is a little soggy, oily, and messy, but it is tasty. The bacon is crisp and delicious, but the pepperoni is a little bit soft and wet. The crust (we choose the butter crust) is quite yummy, and I like that it is not overdone. \\n\\nBut would I choose this pizza over Hound Dog's or Mama Mimi's if it weren't such a good deal? Probably not. The deal is it, I have to say. I mean, $5 to feed two people is probably equivalent to cooking supplies to make a home cooked meal, and it even beats McDonald's. But despite my frugal-sense, rest assured if the pizza were bad I would NOT eat there just because it's cheap. However, the taste is just at that point where it's good enough to take up that deal.

We had to wait 15 minutes before even getting someone to come to our table, and we had to flag them down. We didn't bother asking about the teas because we were hungry. They have an expanded food menu, offering more than just afternoon tea, such as full entrees for lunch or dinner. What was disappointing is that you could not just order a classic 'afternoon tea' with sandwiches, scones, and macarons. (Say what?!) You could order 5 finger sandwiches only, that did NOT include tea. (I did that and they were tiny, and did and add on pastry which was fine) You could order 3 mini sandwiches and 2 scones which included tea. Or you could order scones and macarons including tea. Not all 3. But that's what you go to a tea house for! Yes you can do an add on of pastries and macarons,  but wow, money grab. On top that, the worse was they were OUT of macarons and it could not be ordered. (Say what again?!). I have high tea just to have a macaron at the end. In addition, they had given us a price fix menu of their 'festive menu' only to tell my friend, sorry, they are out and it can't be ordered and we should not have received that menu in the first place.

A few minutes later someone else comes out and we are greeted and seated.  We get water but then nothing else for at least ten minutes when I flag down a server and ask if I can get a cup of coffee to which he responds 'just a minute' as he rushes past.  When he does come back to take our order I ask him about the French toast. He raves about how good it is and how people come there especially for it. I decided to go with it mainly because the breakfast menu was really limited and pricey to boot.  I really was expecting a great breakfast menu given the diner motif.  So I ended up with 3 pieces of bread that were somehow soggy in the middle and charred around the edged. Gag!  It was just gross and tasted, no lie, like a soggy piece of charcoal.  My daughter's eggs were cold and the breakfast potatoes were, well, weird steak fry looking things seasoned with- I kid you not, cumin.  Why?  Who knows. \\nFrom reading all the reviews it sounds like the menu has changed several time over the life of this place. So maybe it's evolving. Into what, I don't know. \\nBack to my French toast. When I told the waiter that the chef went a little crazy with the Creme br√ªl√©e torch and my toast tasted like charcoal he took it away but did not apologize. He didn't offer to bring anything else and he did not take it off the bill. \\nI was mad so as I was leaving a saw the manager at the front desk and asked her name. Maggie or Megan, I think. She asked if everything was okay and when I told her what was going on apparently it was the first she had heard. To her credit she then went back and took it off the bill along with the coffee.  I guess she was out of the loop - who knows. She is the only reason I am giving this place any stars at all. Won't be back."},{"name":"Buffalo Wild Wings","address":"11400 University Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"So today we decided to go to BBW to get some food and just enjoy...To our surprise we didn't expect the AMAZING service from \\"Batman\\" (Danny) the server!!!

We walked in on a Friday morning and there was no wait, probably because of finals. I'm more of a First Watch guy for breakfast but the interior was certainly nice and clean. \\n\\nHowever, I have to say that while the food was good, the Italian Chicken Panini I got was no better than one I'd order at Panera or Einstein's. I really like the sandwiches there, so not a bad thing. It came with a side of chips and a pickle. The lady ordered the Tuna melt on a ciabatta. The bread did not look like a fluffy ciabatta but rather sliced bread like my panini, which was weird. And it was very dry. \\n\\nI wanna say that the service I can see from the other staff members other than our server, is pretty good. Our server was training but I'd like to point out some things: forgot water when I asked for water, soda, coffee. Please trim your nose hair, best $6 at walmart I ever spent. After we got our food and starting to eat, he came by to ask how it was, but not sure if he wanted me to finish that bite because he just stood there not saying anything. A nod from me and he was on his way. So I guess he's just really new to serving..\\n\\nAlso he came back after taking our orders to clarify what bread she wanted, but it came out and a server told us that it was Texas Toast. And then when we asked to comp the meal, the manager said that their ciabatta is just like that style. It's always a bit confusing when the staff tells you different information. Also when the food came out the runner said \\"Chicken and peppers\\" instead of the dish's name, so I didnt really get why he did that. Didn't know the menu?\\n\\nOkay enough being mean. But i appreciated it that the manager and training server were there to smooth out any kinks in the service and comp the Tuna melt. Thats why I gave them the extra half star lol. Will I be back?

I'm planning on trying their other location to see if it's an improvement on this one. All in all, it might be worth trying but I think you can find better food for a better price elsewhere."},{"name":"Grindhouse Killer Burgers","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"If you're craving the soggiest and greasiest burger come here.

We then had to wait another 15 minutes for the third lunch to come out. Here's the best part, we ordered a hot dog, a caprese sandwich, and ahi tuna tacos.

Do they wear grass skirts in Jamaica? *shrug* Appropriately themed retro record album covers sadly stuck on shelves still in heavy clear plastic sleeves, one at a jaunty angle behind the cash register looked as if it had fallen down. Overall I was unimpressed with the decor. Rather than being wowed, I couldn't fail to notice how shoddy the work was in so many respects. For a place built on a theme you'd expect the decor to be a key element. Certainly the Kahiki had that nailed. Run down, sure, but the decor made up for the crappy food there. \\n\\nPolynesia, Hawaii... warm, tropical, sunny.... not in Columbus. It was freezing cold and drafty in there. It's only November... it's a long winter of Polynesian popsicles ahead. The HVAC system must have been designed by monkeys. It's hard to enjoy wearing a lei when you're bundled up in your winter coat at the table and wishing you had a hat and scarf. Not only was I cold, my food was also cold within minutes. \\n\\nOn the plus side there were a number of reasonably priced small plates. On the other hand, the three I tried were mediocre at best. The Hawaiian Burgers were underdone and rubbery with only a small 1\\" slice of a pineapple ring. Are pineapple rings that expensive a condiment? I didn't see any caramelized green onions either, but maybe once again the portion was so miniscule that I failed to detect it.\\n\\nThe tiny Thai Pineapple Fried Rice Bowl was about as big as and tasted like a $1.00 Michelinas frozen meal. At least the portion of sliced canned pineapple ring was more generous here.\\n\\nThe mini pork egg rolls saved the show, by far the best thing I ordered, but by the time I got around the eating the last one of the four, it was ice cold.\\n\\nI gave a pass on the $9 cocktails. There were a few as low as $5 though. Are Tiki mugs really going for $3 these days? \\n\\nAnother high point was the iced tea. Some sort of tropical blend that our server couldn't quite describe to us, but I'm hardly likely to head back just for an iced tea. I didn't bother to even try a soda - as my experience for years at  Lessner restaurants is that they ALL consistently all have the flattest, least carbonated  and unpalatable sodas I have ever been served. Perhaps the strict rationing of carbon dioxide gas saves a few cents.\\n\\nAnother plus in my book is that they do not have any distracting televisions, props for that.\\n\\nWill I be back? Maybe. But I won't go out of my way to get there, nor make it a go-to place with my friends.

Some of the entrees (like the liver) were firsts for me, so the bar was set extremely high because it was all delectable. \\nAnd not to mention, the cocktails and wine were just as great. \\nAside from the food, the wait-staff were top-notch...relaxed, genuine, and inviting. \\nLastly, I really appreciated the whole pre-pay aspect when making reservations, and didn't realize just how much I enjoyed that until we left dinner. It was so different to show up to an already paid for meal but I truly loved it. \\nNext to Bacchanalia, this is one of our favorite places.

I realize that the odd number is difficult with it being a small space. The only opening they had was 9:15 pm. I jumped on it and planned to go. I wanted to have a night out with a couple of girlfriends and had been dying to go for dinner. It's just a 4 minute walk away from my house, even more a reason to try it. I called to make sure 3 people was going to work with it being a late reservation. When I looked at Opentable a couple of hours before, I guess I fat fingered it and freaked out. It only said two. \\n\\nThat phone call just set the tone for the entire evening. Never got her name, but boy did she make it a point to sound so inconvenienced. If it wasn't going to work out, I got it. I would have tried for some other time. She checked the books and came back and said that she could only do 3 at 9:45. She said they had a full bar when I mentioned coming up there prior to see if MAYBE a table would clear up. It was a breezy 102 degrees outside and she was insistent on seating us outside. I stayed strong. I wanted the dining room. \\n\\nWe got up there. Now there were two hostesses, the bitchy resting face had doubled. The only place to wait was outside. Again, the persistence with wanting us to be seated outside. We said we'd have a couple of drinks and wait. Guess what? There was no full bar. Just beer and wine. Not only that, they only had counter space for those dining. \\n\\nSo. You can't go to the bar and buy a drink, wait inside for a table or evidently have a smile on your face to be taken seriously. \\n\\nThey sat us pretty quickly, after mentioning that we were here for a \\"pretty late dinner\\". The table was right in front of the door. That's not the problem though. It was right in clear view of the prying eyes of the big balls of sunshine who had been so \\"gracious\\" since the beginning. \\n\\nHow uncomfortable. I was just in utter shock and wasn't about to drop any money here. So my friends and I just looked at each other with our deflated faces and just got up and left.

The decor of the Black Horse was not the run of the mill townie bar and it definitely had some classy touches to it with some purple accent lighting by the bar, the 3 flat screen televisions, and some retro Winchester photos hanging on the walls.  Not only that but it was 10:30 PM and the place was still crowded and packed at both the bar and tables.  Not sure if it's due to the opening day buzz or if my town just has a lot of alcoholic residents but the place was hopping.  I would say it was a very successful grand opening if people were still eating and drinking at 11PM.  Now down to the nitty gritty.  Service was prompt and friendly which it should be especially on opening day.  I ordered the Black Horse Tavern burger and it was a solid burger.  The best burger I've ever had?  No but it was a pretty good burger nonetheless.  It was a half pound angus cheeseburger with sweet italian sausage and mushrooms.  I asked for medium and it came medium in all its pink glory with a nice chargrilled flavor to it.  As for the fries they tasted fine but they were those thin cut shoestring fries and not the big fat steak fries that I enjoy more.  Oh well beggars can't be choosers.  Another thing that I found nice was that each table came with a full set of condiments - salt, pepper, ketchup, and the all important A1 steak sauce which is a must for any burger.  Pricewise, it's a Winchester bar so it reflects the neighborhood but they did offer a  variety of burgers ranging from $7-$11 and entrees in the $17 range.  One thing that would be nice though would be a free refill on sodas as the glasses were not that large and mostly filled with ice so it is not hard to ring up more than $5 in soda beverages if you're thirsty.  Overall a pleasant experience.

However, there wasn't a single redeeming quality about our experience. The prices are insane. A side of broccoli is $3.90, which I'm totally okay with except it was 4 small florets, leaving ample room on the saucer it was served upon. I thought the BBQ Kalebone was pretty good and didn't mind paying $4.50 for it. My husband and vegan friend got the dinner portions which were $15.35/plate and included the entree, two sides and cornbread. This would also be acceptable if the sides were reasonable, and if the meals came out complete. Baked potato side was actually a sliced in half potato that was completely unseasoned unless you consider the flecks of aluminum foil in it a seasoning. The broccoli was also unseasoned. Unfortunately, both of the season shakers on the tables were empty. The dinners also came without the tarter sauce which was a bummer since the server suggested the meal based on the great tarter sauce that came with it. She ghosted after our plates were dropped off and there were no other servers around, so there wasn't much of an option to make this right. The ambiance also leaves a lot to be desired, but I could look past that if any other aspect of the dining experience was redeeming. As a side note, their bathroom had an abundance of dried urine on the seat and no paper towels. They did have an old hair dryer on the wall, but when I attempted to use it I realized I'd be better off blowing on my own hands, so I wiped them on my pants instead. Also, there was no parking available nearby so we parked in a lot for $5. All told, our meal for 3 plus parking was over $50.\\n\\nTL:DR - Prices are way too high, food is unseasoned, service is slow to nonexistent, and the ambiance is totally lacking."},{"name":"Harry and Larry's Barbeque","address":"54 W Plant St","city":"Winter Garden","stars":"4","text":"Small over priced portions.

Maybe even better than ok. \\n\\nLittle Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot is a nationwide AYCE chain. For $18.95 you can get all the food you want on the top half of the sheet for 2 hours ! (Seafood and some other goodies are extra per order). If you come alone, it's $20. But who comes alone to hot pot? Seriously, this pot is as big as a wash basin. \\n\\nI'm also not sure how strictly they enforce the 2 hour limitation. \\n\\nEverything you order, you mark on a piece of paper -- sushi style. You can indicate which type of broth you want, spicy, plain, nutrition, or combo of 2. They have sauces at the table for you to create your own dipping sauces. There selection isn't as nice as Mini Hot Pot though.\\n\\nEverything is family style. They bring out orders of your meats, veggies, tofu, and meat/fish balls based on the number you order. Be sure not to go overboard because they will charge you for \\"waste\\". I think this is pretty subjective because they don't indicate what is considered waste and what isn't. You can eat, and when you run out of food, order some more. \\n\\nI thought their meats and veggies were pretty fresh. They had a large selection for the AYCE portion. I didn't venture much into the pay section but there were quite a number of seafood options as well. They also have \\"main dishes\\" that you don't cook in the hot pot such as scallion pancakes, soup dumplings/xiaolongbao, fried cruellers, etc. \\n\\nI came here with a fairly large group (20) and they divided us into two. Each group had both newbies (to hot pot) and veterans. Since everyone has a different \\"hot pot style,\\" I generally prefer that everyone gets their own pot. Large groups can get complicated (proximity to the pot), overcooking ingredients, etc. But I think Little Sheet Mongolian Hot Pot did a pretty good job of accommodating and providing service. \\n\\nKudos!

Mike told us that it was self serve coffee and teas inside so we could feel free to do so while waiting which is very smart! We waited about 20 minutes which wasn't too bad. \\n\\nOn to the food, generous portions and very tasty. We ordered all different breakfast dishes from waffles to omelettes. I had the Moroccan eggs which was sunny side eggs on top of tomatoes, onions, and peppers with cumin. My fianc√©e ordered a Mexican omelette which was very tasty and filling with a great toasted corn muffin. Not one person had a complaint about their brunch plate and service was great.

Reluctantly we are allowed the two tables together (vs our one in the corner). My step mom was immediately put off by this as she thought 'I'm bringing in a lot of money/biz for you!' The service was extremely slow. Like really slow. Honestly that didn't bother me too much was I've worked in waitressing and bartending and my personal server (a young man) was very nice And that goes a long way. My husband's food was cold and not good, and he was so unhappy and he likes everything. Not picky, not a complainer. He never got a chance to let anyone know his concerns w his meal because no one ever came back by or asked us. We all ate in shifts it was so odd. But anyways paying our bills (all close to a $100 each), my step mom mentions about my husbands meal and the women said, \\"well there's nothing I can do about it now.\\" Before we paid! Um excuse me we expected nothing. Chalk it up to poor timing by the staff but the rudeness was certainly unnecessary and not true. Even if we had paid there is a lot she could do! I'm not one of those tough customers but again having been in industry that was a shitty thing to say. The customer is always right even if they aren't.

This time I had an early morning flight for what was going to be a long day, so I decided to have a sit down breakfast as it wasn't a very busy spot. I sat down and waited at least 10 minutes before someone stopped chatting and came out of the corner to bring me a menu. There wasn't much on the menu so I quickly decided on an egg and cheese breakfast (no meat) sandwich with a bottle of water (I'd order here and skip the line at the Newslink) and orange juice. I ordered just that when my waitress came back 5 min later to take the order. The slow service wasn't a  big deal as the incoming plane hadn't even arrived and would need to deplane before boarding. Well 10 min later, the cook comes out confused about my sandwich order and what meat did I want on it. I explained that I just wanted cheese, no meat. So when my sandwich comes out 5 min later (total wait time now: 30 min), it's just cheese on bread! I got up and pointed to the menu to show the cook, who was still nearby chatting with other workers, that I ordered an egg and cheese. The correct  sandwich was brought to me less than a min later. So what was all the delay for previously! I took one bite of my sandwich and my flight started to board. I got up, with both sandwich and cc in hand, and asked to the waitress close my tab since I had to go. I also reminded her not to charge for the bottle of water and orange juice that I never got. To add fuel to the fire, both the cheese and egg/cheese sandwich was on the bill. The manager was called in to assist with adjusting the bill both times. I finished my breakfast at the register, quickly signed the bill, got a bottle of water at the Newslink next door and rushed onto the plane.

We set up  appointments for 4 messages, pedicures and manicures at least a month prior to the date. When we got there we were checked in and offered water that's when it went downhill.  \\n\\nThe messages were good for half of the group and bad for the other half.  I left with bruising on my back and shoulders, she spent about 5 minutes on my legs total and the rest of the time rubbed the same spots on my back over and over over. the massage therapist would not stop talking during the entire message.  I heard things about her fight with her mother, moving into her new house with her boyfriend and to top it all off....Her dog who is dying of cancer of the mouth.  These are not the topics I want to hear about when I am trying to relax before my wedding (two days later).  I was still so sore that when anyone hugged me or patted me on the back for my wedding I was in horrible pain.  I'm pretty sure she spent a good portion on my message texting and not actually working on my body, one hand would stay still on my leg and the other was tapping at something.\\n\\nThey only had one nail \\"specialist\\" scheduled that day and could only do one nail appointment at a time.  The nail specialist was rushed and at the beginning not so friendly.  The pedicures were supposed to be 45 minutes each and she spent about 15 minutes on each of us.  The nail painting was horrible, when asked to put flowers on the toes she included the stem and made the flowers so small it just looked like blobs from a distance.  She cut one of the girls pretty badly and then got nail polish all over her toes.  We didn't even have time for everyone to get manicures.  She was rushing and doing a horrible job of it.  She was surprised when the bride asked for her finger nails to be filed evenly.  We finally had to leave because we had other appointments and didn't plan to be at the salon for over 3 hours.  \\n\\nMy wife got her underarms waxed and the girl waxed over the area more than once an as she was doing it even said \\"we aren't supposed to do the same area twice but...\\"  Her arms were horribly discolored and sore.  It looked like she had blood blisters in her underarms.  Thank goodness the makeup artist was able to spray paint her underarms to take some of the redness away.\\n\\nWhen it was time for us to pay for the waxing the lady behind the counter was too busy on the phone to actually take my money.  After standing there for 10 minutes and wasting even more time making us late for our other appointments I finally said screw it and I walked out.

So if it looks like I'm proudly trying to align myself with this place - I'm not.  I've gotten dragged here a few times by a friend that likes it.  It's small and it's obviously not hard to be \\"exclusive\\" if your max capacity is what would fit into my living room.  This place is completely driven by money as opposed to even a remote speck of customer service.  Unless you have table service (which is all this place is geared towards and there's only about a dozen or so of those available), expect to look awkward while hanging out in cramped quarters.  And if you do have table service, be aware that unless you're still spending oodles you'll either be moved if someone covets your space or kicked off the table altogether.  And there is zero point of complaining as customer service is not this places strong point - or at all.  I have been places that are considered \\"exclusive\\" in major cities around the world - exclusive from what I've experienced rarely involves being rude to the clientele and I'm surprised that people keep coming back for more at this establishment.  The wait staff are female and attractive in their own way, but much like the clientele, very \\"plastic\\".  Which leads me to the one redeeming quality of this place, it's a great place to people watch, pretentious Vancouverites make for fabulous entertainment.  I can't say I find the men that frequent this place attractive, likely because they've been vetted at the door by the substance of their wallet and not their looks and personality.  The women that get in are on the whole the opposite - you get in if you're pretty and/or scantily clad.  Like I said, great people watching if you're into watching bizarre behaviour.  Music is decent, but there is no dance floor and gyrating at your table or in no-man's land in the middle looks a bit ridiculous, especially if the main reason for dancing isn't for the love of music or dance, but to show the table buying high rollers that you're a sexy creature.  Anyways, didn't want this review to sound bitter because I'm not, I'm just a bit fed up that places like this are considered great as far as Vancouver night life.  I love to dance, I appreciate great customer service and I'm always into a diverse crowd and this place is none of those and obviously proud to remain that way."},{"name":"Canoe","address":"4199 Paces Ferry Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"So I needed a place to celebrate my parent's 30th anniversary as well as my birthday and boy was this the perfect place.

Meaning our wine glasses were never empty...she called herself jokingly as the inebriator. \\n\\nWe started off with some appetizers, they were the shrimp and chorizo stuffed calamari with fried tentacles on the side.

The dressing was out of this world, it was a sweet vinaigrette topped with a white sharp cheese. Yummy!!!\\n\\nFor the entree, I decided to go with the tuna cooked ahi/rare style. This was delicious. It had shitake mushrooms and sat on a bed of black rice with carrots. The tuna was cooked on a wasabi glaze which made the tuna a little spicy but not overpowering, it actually had a tinge of sweetness to it. When they served this dish they actually poured some broth on the black rice, which gave the dish another dimension to it. It was absolutely delightful.\\n\\nI also had a taste of the rainbow trout with lobster succotash. This dish has some delicate, subtle flavors. Not always a fan of trout, but this was amazing as well. \\n\\nThe salmon was perfectly cooked, it was nicely seared on top giving it this crusty texture, while maintaining uniform texture and taste in the actual \\"meat\\" oh so gooood!!! Probably the best salmon I ever had.  \\n\\nI also had a taste of filet, which was also one of my favorites. It tasted beautifully!! This steak melted in my mouth. Probably one of the best steaks I've had....it ties with the Bistro 491 in Augusta. I would definitely come here for the steak, even though they specialize in seafood and game.\\n\\nOverall this place was outstanding. The attention you get form the staff was excellent.

Unfortunately, Royal China did not live upto my expectations. \\nFirst up, I would like to say that I give them 5 stars for the service. We were attended to by 3-4 waiters, all of whom were friendly and helpful with the menu. \\nThe hot tea served at the beginning had clearly not been filtered, had I not been paying attention, I'd probably have swallowed a bunch of tea leaves and branches that were collected at the bottom of my little tea cup.\\nWe had Pork and Shrimp dumplings for starters, they were alright. I have to admit that I am quite spoilt when it comes to dumplings and other style of Dim Sum, having lived in close proximity to San Francisco's Chinatown for years.

There were inedible pieces of deep fried chicken ribs and after much digging, the one actual boneless piece of chicken was quite grossly under cooked.

It took 40 minutes for the order to be prepared....certainly way more time than foods of this type would be expected to take. The restaurant was not close to full, and during the 40 minutes I only saw 2 people arrive to pick up take-out orders. The hostess did apologize a couple of times, and said they were extremely busy, but I failed to see it. When I did get the food, I went home and we sat down to eat, and the meal was really sub-standard. The lobster roll was quite dry and tasteless, mostly claw meat, very little lobster tail meat, probably the worst we had ever had. The fries were below ordinary, and the rings not much better.

As soon as my guest arrived, we ordered our meals. My guest chose the baby back ribs and I selected the prime rib thinking \\"you can't go wrong with prime rib\\". Sadly, I was mistaken. The prime rib tasted more like a tough sirloin. The loaded baked potato was bland as well. The best thing about my entire meal was the caesar salad that I ordered. The dressing was like nothing I have ever experienced, not too thick and not too thin--perfect consistency. The croutons were light, crispy and tasted like house made quality.

Their seven course beef consists of, you guess it, beef served in seven different ways! The meal typically starts off with a salad that is dressed in a vinegar dressing, but you can substitute one course for another if you are not practically a fan of a certain course, which was the case this afternoon when we switched the salad for more beef used within the vinegar fondue. Thus, our experience with the 7 course beef began with the vinegar fondue instead of the salad. Personally, I am a fan of this particular course (hence the substitution) because the acidity of the vinegar and onion gives the beef a distinguish flavor that is further enhanced once dipped within the fermented fish sauce as a spring roll. The fermented fish sauce itself was prepared nicely as evident by the balance between the natural saltiness coming from the fermented fish and the sweetness from the pineapple. Therefore, the fermented fish sauce did not overpower the olfactory senses with the smell of \\"fishiness\\" that is often a characteristic of this type of fish sauce. \\n\\nFollowing the vinegar fondue, the server replaced the vinegar filled pan for a clean/empty pan for the butter grilled beef. The beef came out covered in oil, various seasoning, and was topped with butter that would eventually be used to grill them. This course is definitely for the butter lovers as you can definitely taste the butter that the beef was grilled in. The next course in the series is actually three courses but they are served together on a single plate because they are similar in preparation and how they are to be eaten. These three courses consist of onion stuffed beef skewer, beef wrapped in Hawaiian lot leaf, and the steamed beef pate. The beef in all three of these courses were seasoned to perfection, there weren't any bland pieces on the skewer nor bites within the steamed pate. Afterwards, the final course of beef congee was presented. The congee itself was on more on the thick side (a good thing) and was bursting with fresh flavors from the herbs! It was seasoned well and served as a nice finish to a long series of beef courses.\\n\\nOverall, I really enjoyed the DIY spring roll that accompanied each course as it gave me control as to what I want within my spring roll. Furthermore, I really like the private parking lot they have in the back. Albeit small, it is at least a parking lot, which is great considering how difficult parking is within this area of the city."},{"name":"Gators Dockside","address":"5275 Red Bug Lake Rd","city":"Winter Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"Close to home, and consistently good food.

For that price,  you can't go wrong.  \\nThe decor is nice, again - sports bar,  so there's only so far that neon beer signs and big screen TVs can be different. \\nThey do have a good variety of sports games/channels showing at all times. \\nI've been eating here for years and will continue to do so."},{"name":"Anh Hong","address":"291 Adams St","city":"Dorchester","stars":"4","text":"This place is the spot to get your fix on Vietnamese cuisine. I love coming here with a group of friends because they are able to fit a large group of people. Located in Dorchester, it can be tricky to find parking, however there is a small lot behind Anh Hong (I just wouldn't recommend it because it can get tight). Anyways, I usually always get seated right away because it's pretty spacious. \\n\\nSince I'm always with a group of friends, we always order the 7 course beef. Since a lot of us only like certain things out of the options, we usually do one order of the vinegar beef, la lot, and the rest are butter beef. Along with the beef, they give you sauce that pairs well with the roll, rice paper, warm water to dip your rice paper in, a plate of greens, and vermicelli. Eating the 7 course can be very fast paced; cook the meat, when it's almost done cooking, prepare your roll with the fresh veggies/ fruits, compile everything together, dip it in the sauce, enjoy. What I love doing is adding the butter into my sauce or the roll itself because it just gives it that extra flavor. You can easily get full from this and it gives you such a great food coma HAHA. \\n\\nI've also had their meatball pho which is super fresh and comes with a lot for such a small bowl. I shared that once with a friend and we were both content. Their three bean colored dessert (che ba mau) is AMAZING but be aware that this contains peanuts for those who are allergic to nuts. I also love their Vietnamese iced coffee because it's not as strong as other places, however it is more on the creamier side, which I really enjoy. \\nService here is great and always attentive. Just in case you blow out your fire for the 7 course, they are able to light up your pot again. I'd recommend that everyone try 7 course beef at least once in their life because it's seriously so life changing."},{"name":"North Market","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"How could you not love this place?

The sticky buns had a nice crunch and weren't too overly sweet. The scones came out with a variety of preserves and whipped honey butter. \\n\\nI ordered the Riverside and was disappointed that my eggs came out a little cold. They were, however, beautifully seasoned and quite possibly the best I've ever had. The bacon was plentiful and shared amongst the table. \\n\\nMy sister mentioned that the parmesan truffle fries accompanying her duck n' beef burger were too overwhelming and I will have to agree. \\n\\nBeau loved his eggs benedict.

We heard that this place offered the best breakfast in town, per Orlando Weekly 2018, so we had to come check it out. We arrived at 10AM on a rainy Sunday, and we got seated promptly. When we left at 11AM-ish, though, there was a decent line out of the door, so get there a little before 10:30AM, if you want to take advantage of the brunch menu. \\n\\nWe had access to only the breakfast, which was fine.

I, on the other hand, got the Three Meat Omelet (Ham, sausage, and bacon with white American cheese) with a side of home fries and a bagel. \\n\\nHer french toast was pretty great. It wasn't soggy or anything, and the fillings were perfect together. The banana with the texture of the pecan and the creaminess of the cream cheese. It all made for a great bite. Her bacon was pretty good, too. Crispy, but not burnt.\\n\\nFor my omelet, I chose the previously mentioned three meats. There were a few other options, but I picked the best ones. The meats were plentiful. The ham, salty, the sausage, seasoned well, and the bacon, crunchy. Perfect with the ooey gooey cheese to bind it all together. My bagel was great, too. I just love bagels. I don't know why.\\n\\nThe home fries were fine. I think they could have used more of a crunch to them. They were more of just cooked up slices of potato than home fries of any kind that I've ever had. Kind of a disappointment. \\n\\nOverall, the bang that this place offers is well worth the buck.

Food was decent, service definitely needs work.  (and looking at other reviews, it seems this isn't a one off complaint)\\n\\nWe ordered the ahi tuna poke, Bao chicka bao bao and the short ribs to be shared for our meal.  The poke was good - with a different twist on traditional poke (they used a rice cake with some nori instead of a bed of rice which was actually pretty decent).  The chicken baos were decent- though the chicken was a bit on the dry side.  The short ribs weren't great - taste wasn't great (the sauce was lumpy and tasted a bit different to what I was expecting) - not something I would order again but maybe it's a one off.\\n\\nIn any case, my biggest complaint was with the service.  The restaurant wasn't particularly busy on this day - maybe 60% full so you can't really blame it on the place being busy.  Normally, at most places, you'll get your appetizers first, then your entrees after you've finished the appies.  I found it kind of strange that maybe 5 minutes after ordering, our short ribs showed up along with the baos.  About 10 minutes later, our appetizers (the poke) showed up.  This meant our entree ended up getting cold while we ate our appies.  Pretty unusual and shows a bit of a lack of attention to detail.  Never saw the server come back, and never came back to refill my beverage (which was a Coke - so I figured there would be a refill).  Only time he came back was to give us the bill.\\n\\nIn any case, it looks like Bao Down might need to take a good look at their customer service and maybe improve on this.  In a city full of great restaurants, service is a big differentiator and can make or break a restaurant.

The food itself deserves a full 5 stars.  The service was good but not perfect, so if I could, I would give it 4.5 stars.  \\n\\nWe started with the beet salad.  Delicious.  Chunky-cut red beets and thinly sliced golden beets with a round of pepper-crusted goat cheese and a few sprigs of mache.  The beets were lightly dressed in a walnut dressing.  It was light and refreshing with a nice balance of flavors.  \\n\\nNext we tried the crab cakes, which I highly recommend.  I've tried my fair share of crab cakes, and let me tell ya, these are possibly the best I've ever had.  They're almost 1.5 inches thick and about 2.5 inches in diameter.  Almost pure lump crab meat, which itself was cooked to perfection--nice and tender.  Then seared so the top and bottom form a crisp crust; served with a yummy slaw, seasoned with horseradish.  OMG these were so good I almost cried!\\n\\nThird course was the gruyere, caramelized onion, and smoked ham flatbread pizza.  It was very good...about a foot long and 7 inches wide.  I question, however, whether the ham was house-made.  Unless they have a deli slicer in the kitchen, my guess is that it was not house-made, but it was still good.  I mean, how can you go wrong with gruyere, onions, and ham, right?\\n\\nOur main course was the special--merlu (a dense white fish) in an almond crust, atop a bed of sauteed baby spinach and these interesting shrimp-chorizo-hush-puppy things with a smear of green goddess dressing.  The fish was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The hush puppy things were, um, different.  They were pretty good, if unusual.  \\n\\nDessert was the piece de resistance.  (Sorry if that's a little pretentious, but this is a review of a French restaurant.)  We got the flourless chocolate torte.  OMG!  Not too sweet, rich, creamy, decadent.  Served with a tiny cup of freshly whipped cream.  I had a glass of sparkling wine with it (the Risque), which went nicely with it.  My date got a cup of coffee, which tasted freshly brewed and was served in a little carafe--so cute.  \\n\\nWhile my date and I shared all 5 courses, we didn't really hold back on food or drink and our bill came to around $100, a good value for the quality and quantity of food.\\n\\nWe made reservations online-open table directly linked from Bouchee's website.  We had a very cozy table in a corner booth.  It was a little noisy, as some of the reviews mentioned, but it was quite romantic where we were sitting.  The decor is very nice, mahogany and brass and marble.  I absolutely loved the experience and will most definitely return and recommend to others."},{"name":"Cakes & Ale","address":"155 Sycamore St","city":"Decatur","stars":"3.5","text":"This past weekend I finally had the opportunity to visit Cakes & Ale in its (relatively) new location on Decatur Square. The summary of my experience is as follows: other than having gone to hell in a hand basket, everything is just like it was before the move. Aside from the fact that the service is now glacially slow, the portions are horrifyingly small - and by small, I mean anorexic circus midget small. \\n\\nFood: I dine out frequently and I'm more than willing to pay for well-executed food; that being said, the quality and quantity of the food offerings at Cakes & Ale are not commensurate with the prices. During my recent visit, I started off with the \\"Temple of the Dog\\" - the cocktail was flavorful, but it was literally served in a tea candle votive. For $6, I wasn't expecting a mason jar of alcohol, but something larger than what you'd serve Thumbelina would have been nice. For an appetizer, we opted for the arancini with citrus & fennel pollen, which was a cruel joke. The dish consisted of 6 marble-sized arancini - at $1 per marble it should have been exceptional, which wasn't the case. For an entree, I opted for the half chicken with creamed butter beans, corn, and tomato. The menu alleged that the entree was \\"for 2\\" - after receiving it, I can only assume they were referring to a pregnant woman with fetus. To make matters worse, the dish was completely forgettable and definitely not reflective of the $28 price tag. For dessert, I had the lemon pound cake, which was the only redeeming aspect of the meal.  \\n\\nService: This place makes the Department of Driver Services look like a pillar of expediency. We were seated at 6:40PM, but didn't leave until shortly before 9:00PM - the 45 minute wait between the appetizer and entrees was particularly excruciating. Now I understand why it's impossible to get a reservation on the weekend - there's only two seating blocks the entire evening! \\n\\nAtmosphere: The interior is tastefully decorated and far more expansive than the previous location. The restaurant consists of two dining rooms, a bar area, and an outdoor patio. Dress is smart casual and the clientele is mostly middle-aged to older adults. \\n\\nCost: Appetizers are $5-$13, entrees are $17-$48, sides are $5-$6, and desserts are $7-$8. They also charge $1 per person for bread and water, which I consider to be a dastardly offense in the restaurant world. \\n\\nOther: The restaurant is closed on Sunday and Monday. Reservation requests, but not actual reservations, can be made online. As such, you're better off just calling the restaurant directly for reservations. There is no valet or validated parking, so your best bet is the paid parking lot on Church St. behind the restaurant. Street parking is free in Decatur after 6PM and on weekends."},{"name":"Du Kuh Bee","address":"12590 SW 1st St","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"Lives up to the hype, their hand-pulled noodles are absolutely delicious.

That was the case last night when we expected our usual later-in-the-evening dinner with good service and beer.

The fat of Foie Gras that was crispy outside yet smooth inside blended with Kale leafs at the bottom, and the bitterness of Kale balanced the grease perfectly. Sourness from the pickles(not sure, forgive my ignorance) refresh our taste buds before we take a bite on the tuna steak that is grilled outside but still raw inside.

Winner winner chicken dinner! Seriously. There's no gambling here. IMHO the B.E.S.T. fried yardbird I've had in all of Austin. Tuesday through Sunday (closed Mondays) Dai Due offers their \\"Supper Club\\" menu - prix fixe p/p includes sides, after dinner coffee or herbal tea, and choice of dessert. It's a whole lot of food, so don't be put off by the price. Very reasonable. \\n\\nMenus vary daily as DD is seasonal, regional, farm to table friendly (e.g., wild game, Tuesday wagyu burgers, Friday seafood, etc.); however, Sundays are always Tallow Fried Chicken. Brined then fried with a blend of exotic spices (light curry), the chicken is truly like none I've had before. Crispy, juicy perfection. Sides include fluffy mashed potatoes, beer braised greens, homemade biscuits and gravy, scattered with bread and butter jalape√±o slices. Served family style if multiple people order. Delightful! \\n\\nOf course there's an a la carte menu as well. Couldn't pass on trying the pickled chicken feet. Hmm...:D The broiled San Antonio Bay Oysters with kimchi, shacha cream, and fried scallions are very respectable. Oh, if you're in need for some extra protein be sure to look for the South Texas Avocado Salad with crickets and venison. Chirp, chirp. And, of course, I'm never one to pass on chicken liver mousse (served with pickled blueberries, onion, and served with buttermilk bread on one occasion...yummy!). \\n\\nI don't have much of a sweet tooth, so it pleased me that DD offered a cheese plate dessert option - the Veldhuizen \\"Redneck\\" Cheddar Cheese with Pineapple Guava Paste hit the spot. I've also tried the Apple Basque Cake with Mesquite Ice Cream and Pumpkin Cheesecake with Cajeta and Pecans...both of which were delicious.\\n\\nI really don't think you can go wrong here. I've had brunch on my to-do list for quite some time.\\n\\nOverall: Dai Due is a lovely restaurant with a warm, inviting environment that has an open kitchen. Make reservations, beer (local ATX craft Adelbert's in the house) and wine only, and parking available in front and back. They also have an in-house butcher that fills the small \\"shop\\" in the restaurant with several cuts of meat for purchase and items liked fresh jarred tallow and lard for enhanced home cooking.

Our server was very nice but we were disappointed in how many times we found ourselves waiting around for 10-15+ minutes without even seeing him. He was definitely too busy and management should've seen that and provided additional help or not given him so many tables, as our first experience suffered greatly because of this. \\n\\nThe calamari appetizer was fresh and perfectly breaded. We really enjoyed the caprese salad. I had the linguine pescatorewhich was filled with more fresh seafood than I usually expect. My fianc√© was disappointed in his eggplant parm due to the fact that it was only 4 round slices of breaded eggplant placed atop spaghetti and sauce. It was still very good, just less food than expected and next time he'll try a dish with a larger portion size. \\n\\nWe wanted dessert but our server took too long to come back to take our order so we asked for our check and left.

My version of comfort food is flavorful seasoned pork or meat with rice. That's the Filipino in me. This is an absolute fusion of deliciousness.

Prior to going, she had raved to me about how great this place is, and I looked at the menu and thought, \\"this looks good but it can't be great.\\" BOY WAS I WRONG. Located in the heart of buckhead, next to St. Regis, Umi is a great 1) after work spot, 2) date night, 3) anniversary, or 4) take a client out and about. We went on a rando Wed night and the entire restaurant was PACKED; all the tables were taken (which is a great sign that this place is loved by all), so I would recommend reserving a table to say the least. \\nIf it's your first time going there, they have an EXTENSIVE list of drinks and food. Hands down, I would order their Moscow Mule; its their most popular drink (according to our server) and hell yeah it should be because it's the best infusion of ginger, lemon, soda shaken not stirred I've ever had in liquid form. Their food menu is set up in a traditional form of Japanese dinner where you have appetizers, salads, hot entrees, and then different types of rolls ... and hey do as the Japanese people do when you're here; this is exactly what we did. We started off with their spicy tuna tartar and Yellowtail Jalapeno. The Yellowtail Jalapeno was off-the-chain. It was so \\"buttery\\" and just melted in your mouth and then there was this kick at the end (not too powerful) that just linked every tastebud together for a final firework. The spicy tuna tartar is a perfect blend of all that Asian flavors are known for (pear, lychee, and sriracha). It was incredible and the quail egg that you mix on top gave it that extra \\"kick\\" and \\"funk\\" that leaves you legs dancing underneath the table ... and to think, this is only the starters!\\nFor salad, we got the Seaweed and cucumber Salad with a mazu and the Seared tuna SaShimi Salad. My favorite is the seaweed and cucumber; it was just sooo soo refreshing and so light but well balanced. You start to get full but you don't feel like you're putting on the weight. As a matter of fact, you will probably feel \\"light as a feather\\" because it is just that light and refreshing for your mouth.\\nFor their hot dishes we got the black cod mi So Yaki and the chilean Sea bass Yu-an Yaki. All I can say is #keepitcoming and #wootwoot. Both of these fish were cooked PERFECTLY (like on a scale of 1-10, it's a 15); it's a date that you thought would go ok and ended up specatular; it's the raise you never thought you would get ... you get the point. It's fabulous. The cod is a little better (for me) than the sea bass but personally I think it's because the cod is a type of fish that is better at keeping the flavors and juices in than the bass. \\nWe needed to stay healthy (as if eating seafood is that unhealthy) but we got the Shi Shitou under assorted vegetables. They look like jalape√±o peppers but they aren't and it's made with the most delightful soy sauce. If we weren't at such a nice restaurant, I think we would have loved to transform into barbarians and lick the plate clean (yes, it's THAT good).\\nAfter ALL of this, we got 5-6 speciality rolls including their hurricane, rainbow, typhoon, american tuna, whitefish tempura, 6 pieces of their ikura, and ume-ShiSo maki under their traditional roll. I know by now you're wondering what didn't we get? ...i gotta tell you not a whole lot (and don't worry, we got desert too!) ... Their rolls are SO FREAKING good; I think they were placed on the table and as soon as they were, it was gone. I mean all of their food consistently just melted in your mouth with so much flavor explosion you are left in a trance and all that your brain knows to do is pick up your chopsticks and continue eating and when there is nothing left, you are sad because this wonderful experience/journey had to come to an end (womp womp).\\nFor desert which I believe does and can change so it could be different when you go v. what my table and I got last night ...but we got an assortment of their ice creams, banana cake, pecan pie, and their chocolate box with a lava cake and green tea ice cream. \\nThis place is an experience; the service is TOP NOTCH (my server was awesome; she knew the menu backwards and forward and made some great recommendations as a result). I can't wait to go back; I'm salivating just thinking about the food I consumed last night. #nomnomnom"},{"name":"Capa Steakhouse & Bar","address":"10100 Dream Tree Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Incredible service, steak and atmosphere - with one minor glitch at the bottom of my review. The drive into the resort's grounds is beautiful, valet was very attentive and the property itself is gorgeous. \\n\\nThe dining area was lovely - very nice booths, nice lighting, terraces to watch the fireworks show, beautiful decor and an extremely talented guitarist playing Spanish guitar. \\n\\nI ordered the bone-in ribeye cooked medium with their verde sauce (very close to a chimichurri sauce, but in my opinion, better). The ribeye was cooked medium like I ordered, and the broccoli was great. FYI - the steaks labeled \\"Creekstone Farms\\" are halal. Capa has a partial Creekstone Farms menu. Great quality steaks. \\n\\nThey also prepared rice upon request (it's not on their menu, so I put in a request ahead of arrival - they're great at accommodating when they can). That said, their mashed potatoes left a lot to be desired. But their churros were amazing! And so was their \\"Spa Day\\" drink, which was basically a virgin cucumber mojito. But better.\\n\\nOur server was very attentive and helpful. Capa took care of validating the valet ticket as well.\\n\\nCapa's located atop the Four Seasons resort - and the dress code is supposedly \\"resort casual,\\" which is extremely vague and lax. Men are not expected to wear jackets, slacks, dress shirts or dress shoes it seemed, women aren't expected to wear dresses or overly formal attire either. \\n\\nThere were kids in shorts and slippers running around (literal waterpark attire), and adults even who seemed like they just returned from the Disney parks - men in sandals, t-shirts and shorts. This is probably a loose policy forced onto them because it's on Disney's property, or maybe it's a business decision because of its proximity. Regardless, it's definitely a mistake - the atmosphere looks and feels just like a five star, fine-dining experience, and as such, there should be formal dress code."},{"name":"Java Grind and Grill","address":"125 Main St","city":"Stoneham","stars":"4.5","text":"I went here for brunch today and this place is a bit of a hidden gem.

The server we had was really cool and knowledgable of the menu and beer selection, but he was really the only stand out memory of this place.

Especially for the price of their menu I would be expecting a bit more. My last go-round I ordered the Elk Burger. I ordered it medium by recommendation of the waiter, it came virtually medium rare to rare. It was hard to tell until I took a couple bites but it left the texture of the burger very unappetizing. Since we were here with about 20+ people the food took long enough to come out and I didn't bother to send it back. I just didn't eat it. Burger also tasted like there wasn't much in the ways of seasoning and just had a bit of lettuce slapped onto it. Didn't see my cheese on there either....\\nSweet potato fries were alright. A bit soggy some. Tried my mom's Meat pizza....it was so-so. The crust seemed soggy and it was definitely greasy. My brother's fish and chips was actually pretty tasty. But for $19...holy crap really!? 3 ok sized pieces of fish, some soggy fries all for $19. That was a bit steap. I'd say it's worth MAYBE $15. Everything seems overpriced for what it is unfortunately. \\nTheir desserts are pretty good - the cookie pie and carrot cake are not too shabby. \\nOverall I recommend coming to Deschutes, but honesty I'm not sure if I'd be back to have an actual meal...for the price I can go to several other places in the area to get a bit better quality in my opinion.

Christina K wanted to go here for ages and we finally made our way there for lunch yesterday. I didn't give them 5 stars because the wait was fairly long. They were busy during lunch and it's not their fault, but it was still a long wait for drinks, then to take our order and then waiting for the order. I guess you shouldn't come here super starving... \\n\\nAnyways, I had to order the Croque Monsieur but replaced the tempting ham with turkey instead and potato salad as a side. I also ordered their daily lunch special - Meatloaf sandwich sans cheddar cheese. The waitress/owner must not have heard me so it came out with cheese. I wanted to eat it so bad but my baby is intolerance for dairy so I had to return it. Luckily I was able to trade half the sandwich with Christina so I was very please. The cheese really does make that sandwich so much better! \\n\\nMy croque monsieur was perfect. It has enough turkey, enough cheese and the honey mustard was absolutely addicting. Both sandwiches were absolutely amazing and the portion is generous. I had a food coma when I got home - knocked out completely. \\n\\nI also got a slice of the tiramisu and I couldn't stop eating it... although the cake must have been there for at least 2 days, because the lady finger was stale.

The restaurant was dimly lighted and had a great ambience. It was elegant, modern, and welcoming. I was greeted by the hostess with a happy birthday, and was immediately seated for our reservation. The waitress was honest with her recommendations and very friendly. The smoked salmon pancake appetizer was absolutely delicious!! The salmon felt like it melted in my mouth, and the Vermont blue cheese was not over powering at all. My main course was the Australian lamb over a bed of carrot risotto with mint crumbs on top. The carrot risotto was the best part of the dish. It was extremely well seasoned and had the perfect consistency. The Australian lamb was cooked well but a little under seasoned. For dessert I had the strawberry and rhubarb pie with ice cream on top. Omg!!! The best dessert I've had in so long. Thankfully it was not too sweet and was so warm and toasty.

It is not so strong that people adverse to stouts will not like it. I'd recommend it as a good transition into the darker beers on their menu!\\n\\nValley of the Shadow: A delicious dark Schwarzbier that lives up to the name. You get delicious spices melding well with the malty hops for a smooth velvet finish. \\n\\nJubelale: Are you ready for Christmas and winter? You will be after this dark delicious beer. There are flavors of spices and dried fruits that just make it feel like you should be curled around a fire. It was probably one of my favorite of the flight. \\n\\nPacific Wonderland: A well brewed light lager akin to what you would expect to drink on a hot summer day. You can taste hints of tangerine and citrus in the finish that complement the mild hops well. \\n\\nFresh Hop Big Rig Bitter: A good brown ale with strong caramel flavors. It wasn't my favorite, but could easily be a beer you drink two or three of in a night. The flavors are not so strong as to be overwhelming, but make for some light drinking.\\n\\nMirror Pond Pale Ale: Your standard Pale Ale! It was crisp and clean and worth the spot on my flight. It may not have been my favorite, but that doesn't mean it was bad.\\n\\nOverall, I love the brewery, though with the restaurant it can feel a bit loud and missing the vibe of the \\"craft brewery\\" you usually expect.

I got a whiff of some of their paprikas and chile powders and they smelled heavenly.  I got my wedding bouquet at Market Blooms, and even though I was there at sort-of the last minute, they set me up quickly and efficiently with some gorgeous flowers.\\n\\nI do find that some of the prepared food places are hit-or-miss.  The barbecue from Holy Smoke BBQ is okay, but fairly pricey for the little sandwich that you get.  I used to love Flavors of India, but the service has gone downhill lately and the food I had there last time was bland.  I never really liked Firdous Express, though I would go there for olives (they're the ones with the bowls of olives, right?).  The Fish Guys are, apparently, pretty good, but I don't eat fish so I can't say with any certainty--just basing it off of what my husband said.\\n\\nEven if you don't go for the prepared food, you can find just about anything else, from unusual wines and beers, to a large selection of cheese, local meats and poultry, produce, fresh fish, spices, cured meats, and a variety of dry goods among several  different vendors.

We loved the Cadillac pizza, but also enjoyed that we could order burgers, salads, pizzas, etc. and have them delivered to us in Buda. I was saddened learning that Southside had purchased the restaurant, but felt optimistic when I saw they were planning on keeping all of their grill items and salads on the menu. Since Southside was a pizza joint, I figured they would do a good job bringing in their own pizza recipes. \\n\\nWe ordered once in January of this year when the kids were still home from winter break. My kids both wanted burgers- one the mushroom swiss burger and the other a bacon cheeseburger- and I wanted pizza. I settled on half of a Stromboli. Well, there is no nice way to put this- the food was terrible. The mushroom swiss burger was so greasy that the bun literally disintegrated in your hand. The swiss wasn't melted. The burger wasn't seasoned. A few bites and the $10 burger went in the trash. The bacon burger was only slightly more palatable (mostly because it had bacon on it) and the Stromboli was bland and undercooked with non-melted cheese and cold fillings. We were sadly disappointed. It was hands-down the worst $40 lunch I had ever had. That's a lot of money for a lunch in the first place, but it was an especially hard pill to swallow once we tasted the food. \\n\\nBut, I chalked it up to the change in ownership being fairly new. I figured the grill items were new to the Southside staff and gave them a mulligan. We decided to try again last night and I decided to go for pizza since that's what they're known for. We ordered a \\"Vegetative State\\" pizza with pepperoni and jalapenos added and added an order of mozzarella sticks. (pizza crust with mozzarella) \\n\\nThe pizza came in a timely fashion, but as I opened the boxes, instant disappointment set in. The mozzarella sticks were burnt and the thin-crust pizza was so loaded with toppings that it had no structure to it. I don't love thin-crust pizza to begin with and didn't realize that was all they had, but even so, if it had been crisp it would have been okay. But, imagine piling a bunch of pizza toppings on a flour tortilla and that's how floppy the pizza was. The slices were cut unevenly, so I tried to cut them down to smaller, more manageable slices, but the dough was not fully cooked and ridiculously soggy in the middle. All that aside, the pizza was full of wonderful toppings- how bad could it be? Well, the pizza strangely lacked any kind of seasoning, except that I detected a sweetness in the crust. Did they add sugar instead of salt to their crust? Who knows. But, it was terrible. \\n\\nIt's really hard to mess up pizza, but these folks have figured out how to do so. With the end of Cafe 1626, it was the end of an era.

Unfortunately, it was extremely disappointing. I should note that I am not a picky foodie, enjoying everything from hole in the wall to fine dining style (instagram: dreaelenaxox). Also, it pains me to give a poor review, as it is not something I do often. I appreciated a few things about Dixie's: really cool interior, delish sweet tea, and melt in your mouth peach pie. However, everything in between was underwhelming. The portions of the sides were incredibly small: serrano spinach was good but I was only given a dollop, macaroni was plain (no bread crumbs, cheddar on top). Sides were served in paper cartons rather than in proper serving dishes. I am used to ribs with meat falling off the bone, but this was not the case here. I actually had to take my knife and cut the meat off it. They were dry style with no sauce. Also, the brisket was not seasoned and smokey, and we noticed as we walked in that the restaurant did not have a strong bbq smell (red flag). The half a sausage link was only 5 cm long, no exaggeration! The meals were served with white bread and pickles on a tin tray. I understand that this might be \\"Texas style\\", but the bread was bone dry with no butter. i don't understand why they didn't just serve it with a biscuit? Lastly, a great bbq joint should have condiments at the table (bbq sauce, hot sauces, etc). The only sauce she was able to bring me was a mini bottle of Tabasco. Even though the restaurant has only been open for 2 days, I feel that it is essential for them to make BIG changes especially during the Dine Out Festival. They should be trying to gain customers, not loose them this early in the game. At this point I would never go back there, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. As a person with fairly low expectations it is hard not to be offended by this kind of experience. I guess I will just try to be thankful for the wet wipes.\\n\\nNOTE: It is my understanding that Dine Out menus should be 3 courses (appy, main, and dessert). At Dixie's they consider the 2 sides that come with the meat the appetizers. Does this then mean that the entree is just meat on its on? Very strange and in breach of the rules I believe."},{"name":"Mister Tramps","address":"8565 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Wow I wrote a review about this place and to say how awful it was and it was taken down.

The restaurant is packed and it is located hidden right on Hazelbridge but is located in Empire Center. I thought overall, the food is very average. One of the meat tastes  good but the other two meats are bit chewy. The pancake is very disappointing. It is quite thick texture and not as soft or moist as other restaurants. They don't provide spoon for you to pour sauce out and they forget our kimchi. The portion is not that big, not so sure if that's due to my friends eat some before I get there or not. But I leave there feeling hungry so that's not cool. When we ask for more bean sprouts and missing kimchi, the waitress doesn't seem very happy.

Great location, great decor, but unfortunately that doesn't factor much in what's most important in a restaurant.  We've been twice now--once seated and once at the bar.

We've been to many upscale pubs, and we know good food, whether it be burgers or a new twist on calamari. Here? No deal.  Very pedestrian menu, and what we thought might have pizzaz came to our table not prepared properly. (read: soggy calamari, jalapeno burger missing the listed dressing). I will say that there was one good item, the arugula-parmesan pizza.

Stick with beer.\\n\\nThe Wait:  We get it---a new place, neighborhood joint, upscale town = a wait.  But telling us 20 minutes and ending up as 1 hour means either they are deceitful or naive.

Well, the meal was redeeming, but not astounding. \\n\\nBased on recent reviews on Yelp, I opted to avoid the current Chef's Tasting Menu (lest it be a Strike Two for that menu).  Instead, my family and I chose to pick our own dishes for the 3 Course Menu.  I ordered the Beef Tartare to start, followed by Mixed Greens with Texas Fig, \\"Fresh Cheese,\\" Ham, Pistachios and Cherry Vinaigrette, and finished with the entree of Braised Lamb Shank.\\n\\nThe Beef Tartare was decent, but a little disappointing.  It came served in a bowl of Spring Onion Soup, topped with Fennel-Basil Salad and Tomato Aioli, and it was paired with a handful of water crackers.  I think I was mostly disappointed at the fact that the beef tartare was in soup!  Sure, the flavor of the soup was nice, but it completely overwhelmed the beef!  Call me traditional, but when I think of beef tartare, I think: a nice serving of cold, raw beef, with a raw egg yolk, chopped onions, a dollop of mustard, maybe some capers, and Worcestershire Sauce -- all separate on the plate, for me to mix together.  But, if you enjoy a new twist on the traditional, then you might like the Zoot take on the dish.  Eating a little bit of all the ingredients together in one bite helped to balance out the flavors a little better.\\n\\nThe Mixed Greens was the most disappointing, because it literally was a small plate of mixed greens.  Oh, and with one small fig with a small smudge of soft cheese on half of it, along with a tiny piece of ham (that was smaller than my thumb).  Apparently, the items I thought were going to be main ingredients in the dish were merely garnishes!  There were also a few pieces of pistachio on the bottom of the greens, resting on top of a thick swirl of Cherry Vinaigrette (which should have been more accurately called cherry sauce instead of a vinaigrette).  \\n\\nThe Braised Lamb Shank was the star of the night!  The meat was so tender and juicy, it pulled away from and practically fell off the bone!  It sat on top of a couple roasted onion rings, and it was paired with nicely seasoned endive and green beans, as well as a light and creamy cucumber yogurt.  Everything on the dish was delicious on its own, but also complemented each other perfectly.  I believe my choice in entree was the best at the table, as my husband ordered the NY Strip (meat itself was cooked perfectly, but it was paired with a German Potato Salad that was way too mustardy), my Mother-in-Law had a over-cooked and dry Seared Halibut, and my Father-in-Law had a straight-foward Grilled Yellowfin Tuna.\\n\\nOne other dish to mention is the Sweet and Sour Duck.  Now, it's not the breaded and fried kinds that are found in American-Chinese restaurants.  This duck rested on some creamy paprika risotto and was paired with cherry tomatoes and duck cracklings (fried duck skin).  Very yum!  I wished I had ordered the duck instead of my beef tartare.  Oh well.\\n\\nThe servers were very courteous and friendly.  We didn't make reservations for a Friday night dinner (oops, my bad!), but they were very accommodating and setup a table for us.  The one qualm I have with the service is that we waited almost an hour for our third course to arrive, and the server didn't address the wait at all.  At least she refilled our drinks while we waited...\\n\\nOverall, I'm sorry, but Zoot was only \\"A-Ok\\" for me.  Perhaps I went in with grander expectations than was realistic.  The menu sounds delicious and appetizing, but the reality of the dishes were mostly just average.  Plus, waiting for an hour between a second and third course is not crowd-pleasing.  Zoot, I gave you another chance, and I wished you were more, but...unfortunately, it looks like you and I must go our separate ways."},{"name":"Via Tribunali","address":"36 SW 3rd St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I've been a big fan of the fancy/stepped-up pizza movement in Portland over the last 5 years.

If you are looking for something just like Apizza Scholls and yet better, you are in the wrong place.  The dough is soft (NOT CRISPY) and melts in your mouth.

We don't have Deschutes in New York so I was a little surprised to find a lack of nuclear-hopped brews (which I always assumed Deschutes produced). It's actually more of a local crafter doing what they do well (pale ales).

Onsen Tamago does not mean the egg whites should be raw!!!\\n\\nThe proper method would of been for him to set the circulator to 145¬∞F (63¬∞C) and let the eggs cook for anywhere from 45 minutes. Because time is a factor in the gelling reactions that cause egg whites and yolks to thicken and set, you'll notice changes in the egg within that time frame. At 45 minutes, the whites will be softly set, NOT RAW, and the yolk will be warm but runny.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, this chef thought that serving raw egg whites was acceptable if he called it a fancy name.

To be fair, I've only been one time and maybe I just got a bad first impression. I would absolutely go back for another attempt. \\n\\nUmi is located just off Peachtree St near the Roswell Triangle. The entrance is on that promenade leading from King + Duke up to the St. Regis. There are valets and self-parking nearby, just outside Seasons 52. \\n\\nReservations are definitely recommended. This is a popular place and on a Thursday night was absolutely packed. We were seated in the front dining room (the bar area), but there is also a large, more intimate back room. Ambiance is dark and moody. \\n\\nThe menu is quite large and offers a few items that are harder to come by in ATL. That said -\\n it's super overpriced, IMO. A very light dinner for six was around $500. In terms of portion and pricing, I'm inclined to think we could have ordered better; one of the members of our group had been there before and insisted on selecting items for everyone to share.\\n\\nThe food we did try was good, with a few standout items. The Lobster Hot Plate, for one, was really unique. Large, lump lobster meat was served on a hot stone grill with a little heating element underneath. The quality was excellent. The Spicy Tuna Crispy Rice (a box roll) was also quite good. I wasn't very impressed with the aburi o-toro nigiri I ordered at the waiter's suggestion; two super fatty pieces arrived for $22. The reason I like o-toro is usually the texture but this was way too chewy. \\n\\nI left Umi feeling a little underwhelmed and like I'd spent a ton of money... and also a little hungry.

Rather, everything on the menu would come out in separate rounds so that we would be able to try everything. If we didn't want something at the time it came out, then we should just send it back. If we liked something, then we could ask for it again. I was expecting to be able to order specifically the things that I wanted but we went with it anyways. \\n\\nAt least 40 minutes passed before the first round even came out. And for those who know Chinese food, that is an EXTREMELY long time, even for fine dining Chinese food. It took so long that we even began to question whether or not we heard the waiter correctly when he told us not to place any orders.\\n\\nThe first round of food eventually came out and it was basically just standard dim sum that you could get at any of Vancouver's many Chinese restaurants. There was nothing that made it stand out and nothing that made it worth the $40 price tag. It definitely wasn't bad but not great. \\n\\nFor $40 of Chinese food, we were expecting that we'd be able to at least eat a lot of it. This was also not the case. The timing of each round of food was entirely off. After the first round of food came out, it took another 30 - 40 minutes before we received anything else. We asked the waiter multiple times and was told repeatedly that it would be coming \\"soon.\\" After waiting for those 30 - 40 minutes with no food, we began to ask for some of the items on the menu specifically. Asked for the pork and egg congee and ten minutes later, he comes back with the seafood congee. But we were pretty hungry so we didn't even question it. \\n\\nFood was coming at the most random times. Occasionally, he would walk around the room with a plate of food to hand out. This was usually for smaller things like spring rolls and buns. They were using tongs to put the food onto our plates and two separate waiters both dropped the food on us and on the floor. It might have been a better idea to bring the food to the table using individual plates rather than trying to grab them with tongs from a communal plate. \\n\\nEssentially after the first round of food, there was no more \\"rounds.\\" Food didn't come at the same time, it came randomly only after we asked many times for it. And between each random dropping-off of food, there was extremely long wait times. Dim sum is not especially labour intensive and there weren't that many people in the restaurant, so I'm not sure why exactly it took so long.\\n\\nIn total, I believe we were there for 2.5 hours and we definitely didn't receive all the food on the menu despite asking for it many times. It wasn't even until a full two hours in that we got barbecue pork buns, which I asked for in the beginning. The waiter didn't write down any of our requests until the two hour mark, when we told him that we would need to leave soon. It was only then that he pulled out a notepad and took them down, which makes me think that he literally disregarded every single one of our previous requests? Not only did we not receive everything on the menu as they said, we didn't get seconds of anything that we liked and asked for. We got a few random items in the last half hour and that was it.\\n\\nThe waiter didn't seem to be particularly concerned with the timing of things and told us \\"don't worry about it\\" kind of rudely. He did apologize near the end of the meal, but at that point we were just looking forward to leaving.\\n\\nIn conclusion, mediocre and overpriced food with terribly slow service and waiters that don't seem to care."},{"name":"Smokey Bones Bar & Fire Grill","address":"301 Technology Center Dr","city":"Stoughton","stars":"2.5","text":"Dereck was fun, entertaining, and genuine.

First off, the highlight of our dinner was the Calamari - it was very over cooked but I can tell by how delicious the sauce was that if done correctly I would have been in heaven. Next, the steaks we ordered were undercooked. I ordered mine medium and it was more medium-rare - I'm not the biggest fan of medium rare but I don't mind. My girlfriend ordered hers medium-well because the redness of the meat grosses her out and, unfortunately, it was medium rare like mine. She was too embarrassed to say anything out of fear of retaliation so we kept our mouth's shut and continued to the sides. The sides were okay, but not worth $12 each as they were severely under seasoned. Mashed potatoes had no flavor, just a consistency and the potatoes au gratin were cheesy but again, not much flavor.

They consistently have a chicken or lamb biriyani. The lamb is the best. My one issue is that their chicken tikka masala tastes different from day to day. It's like they don't use measuring cups.

Fortunately this time it was much better, though not terrific.\\n\\nThe first time I went with my father because it was a free cruise event from the organization that runs bone marrow donation. My father had donated his bone marrow to a stranger a year before and this was a thank you. We both wished we hadn't accepted. It was like a lunch cruise with a horrible lunch buffet, we went out to eat afterwards. Then the performers came on, and it was torture. We always tell people this was the worst part. The lame dancing was accompanied by horrible singing. And it was raining so we couldn't even escape to the deck. We always tell people about how horrible these singers were, they were like those people that get booed off staged at karaoke night.\\n\\nOn New Years, the experience was greatly improved, though I don't feel it was worth the pricey ticket. The food was really good and it was a very diverse selection at the buffet, however it took forever to get to the food. The people working the carving station were so slow that the line moved at a snale's pace. This wasn't convenient when there was so many people to serve and I was so hungry because I couldn't wait in the boat long line for the buffet at this pace because a recent ankle injury was keeping me off my feet for long periods of time. The DJ was good and people seemed to be having fun dancing, but then the performers came, and I was like \\"NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!\\" They were just as bad, and I think they lasted longer. Thankfully we were at a higher deck so we didn't have to watch them, but my whole party was cringing. At one point the singers began and then stopped and asked people to be quiet so that everyone could hear them singing and then started again. I guess they didn't get the point that everyone was using their NYE noise makers to tell them to be quiet and let us enjoy our mealtime. I considered eating on the deck in the freezing weather to make it stop. The view of the fireworks were great.\\n\\nAlso, I have a lobster and crab allergy. I asked the waitress to check if there was either in any of the food. The salmon had shellfish sauce, so it would have been nice if she ever confirmed that for me. She was kind of horrible, this wasn't the only thing she forgot, but I guess she was to busy singing horribly.\\n\\n I think the cruise has a lot of potential, but they really need to work out the kinks.

The second, this isn't the best scone in those very same states. It's not even the best scone in Atlanta. In fact it's not even a great scone and it's a stretch to even call this baked assembly of flour, fat, and sugar a scone at all.

It used to open early all of the last year but not anymore. You have to drive all the way around (couple traffic lights with a U-turn) to get in. Very inconvenient if you ask me. Also, escalators are undergoing renovation in the mall and there is only one elevator that can get you to the lower garage from the inside. Most of the time, you'll have to visit every mall floor on the way to your car.\\n- Paying for parking: They have booths with people inside of them to collect payment. Needless to say it can take some time to get out. Most garages these days have automated machines where you can pay for parking before you leave. Why not modernize the process? Also, why not make it easier for people who park there daily? They can provide monthly memberships with cards that can let you out without waiting in line. This will speed up the line and make their life easier.\\n- It's pretty dirty: The staircases are full of filth, spills, and strange odors.\\n- Tall curbs: I've seen lots of people scratch their wheels and even cars on the tall curbs at their exits.

Now, I was truly impressed when I was told that the pizza would be ready in 3 minutes but was underwhelmed by the outcome.  The pizza dough under cooked (too light underneath) and lacked the flavor of Tofu.  On top of that the ingredients outweighed the pizza causing the cheese and pepperoni to slide off each slice.

It's a good portion not overly greasy and comes with awesome dipping sauces. The daikon salad is amazing here as well.\\n\\nPitchers of beer are affordable here and they have a attachment to keep it chilled. The only downside is that the cocktails and martinis here are definitely short poured. The menu for some wierd reason shows the alcohol percentage on each drink.

The tekka maki was classic in form but startlingly fresh with big chunks of deep red tuna.\\n\\nI found Oga on Yelp while in Boston on business, and at just over 3 miles or so from my hotel, what a lucky find it was.  Mind you, that's 3 miles as the crow flies.  Due to the rococo highway engineering favored by the good people of Massachusetts, you have to drive a good 3-4 miles *past* Oga going east before you are allowed to double back and reverse course on Route 9, or as I refer to it, The Highway that U-Turns Forgot\\".\\n\\nLook, this place is worth every mile you might trek.  The sushi is fantastically fresh, the service is impeccable, and the dining room has a style and fresh charm that goes way beyond what you might expect in the non-descript strip mall that houses Oga. \\n\\nI will also say I have yet to have sushi in San Francisco to match Oga's offerings.  It seems odd to me that, hard by the ocean as the Bay Area is, and with what I suspect is a much higher Japanese contingent in the population, we still can't seem to offer up many fine sushi restaurants.  Most sushi restaurants in the Bay Area are dumpy and mediocre at best.\\n\\nOga's offers a full Japanese menu with some really creative specials as well as a huge array of sushi rolls and combinations.   I had a delicious sukiyaki, a classic Japanese dish that seems to be disappearing from the collective consciousness elsewhere but with its rich, almost sweet broth, paper thin slices of beef, silky cubes of tofu, simmered vegetables and cellophane noodles is a delight that deserves a comeback.\\n\\nIf you are in this neck of the Metro West region of Boston, I urge you to check out Oga--it's worth every penny."},{"name":"Mango II Thai Cuisine","address":"2171 Main St","city":"Tewksbury","stars":"4","text":"The food is good but over-rated on here.

I have rarely come across a place with better customer service and a selection of wares that will cast desire of everything in the place into your heart. And that kind of awesome NEEDS to be rewarded. Here is my story:\\n\\nAbout three years ago, my then-boyfriend (now husband) and I were looking for a new apartment, and Belmont just seemed like a town we should be in. We spent a good month of weekends driving to and from open houses and viewing appointments. During the course of that time, we stumbled upon this place. I remember that we were a little bit early to an appointment, and we needed to find parking. We parked right out front of this store and I said we should go in to waste some time before we had to meet the realtor. While we were there, I bought a bottle of wine and a fancy chocolate bar. I cannot recall if the wine was bad, so it must have been to my liking; the chocolate bar, however, was not. It consisted of dark chocolate and sea-salt, a combination that I had enjoyed in the past and thought that I would like in this instance. The packaging also swayed me, as it had a seahorse on it, and I have a heart-on for anything pony. This confection was not in my realm of delicious--quite the contrary--so I gave it to my boy.  He thought it was the best damn chocolate bar he had ever put in his mouth. \\n\\nCut to about a month ago: My boy and I had moved to Watertown and I was going crazy because our wedding was days away, and my friend that was making the cupcakes needed to go to a bakery.  She googled the closest bakery and found Ohlin's Bakery, which is located right next to this place. Upon driving up to Ohlin's, I was very pleasantly surprised to see The Spirited Gourmet.  I was equally happy to know how close it was to our new home. Two days after the wedding (which was completely awesome, if you were wondering), I dragged my new husband over to Ohlin's (review of them to follow), pointed out The Spirited Gourmet and asked him if he remembered it.  His eyes got really wide and head said something to the effect of \\"salt chocolate\\".  I took it as a yes and we went inside. \\n\\nWe spent a good 20 minutes avoiding eye contact with the workers and looking for the chocolate.  Alas, we came up empty handed, and decided that we needed to partake in human interaction to get our question answered. The woman at the counter took on our inquiry like it was a quest.  We explained that it had been a long time ago, we also explained the packaging and what the chocolate bar tasted like, everything we could think of. They didn't have it any more, but she was on it: completely determined to find out what we were talking about.  We gave her our information, signed up for their email list, said thank you, and left with a selection of other fine, savory goodies. \\n\\nTwo weeks went by and my husband received a phone call from Rayna.  She had found the chocolate bar, ordered it, and said it should be in the store in about a week.  A week went by, we moseyed our way down there, and she not only had ordered for us, but replenished her stock for the entire store, in six different varieties.  My boy replenished his own stock, very pleasantly surprised.  I wanted to thank Rayna, but she wasn't around right then, so we picked up a few more Halloween supplies and skedaddled.  Less than a week later, Rayna sent a very thoughtful e-mail informing us that the chocolates were in.  My boy was impressed by that level of dedication, and so was I.\\n\\nForget the store's inventory (okay, don't forget it--there's also a delicious array of cheeses, sausage, spiffy liquors, and wine wine wine from all over the world), that level of customer service alone is a model for everyone else in the business.  Not only did Rayna make us feel like our somewhat trivial request was the MOST important thing, she followed through on honoring it, and, in the process, might just have made us customers for life.  She's certainly inspired us to visit more often than every three years.  Thank you Rayna, and thank you Spirited Gourmet!"},{"name":"Jovita's Mexican Restaurant","address":"1619 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"Awesome food and great service....Cheap prices and nice specials for the low budget consumer!"},{"name":"Waxy O'Connor's","address":"94 Hartwell Ave","city":"Lexington","stars":"3","text":"The venue itself is well done and it USED to be a good place to eat.

The first, and most obvioius reason, is the service. My friends and I were on a self guided beer tour in Portland and we had to check out Deschutes. We were seated promptly, and wanted to get samplers so we asked the waitress for a beer menu. She rolled her eyes and left saying something about getting forms for us to fill out. We look at the beer menu and give her our orders, and she comes back with our appetizer: ribs sitting on top of a nice garnish of lettuce... covered in gnats. We tell her our problem and she gives us an excuse, saying the wood plate on which the ribs are served is wet and must have gnats in them. Like that makes us feel better!\\n\\nOur experience didn't get much better from there, and our server completely ruined our experience. We ate our food and drank our beers in annoyed silence; and this is not how one should act at Deschutes!\\n\\nThis brings me to the second reason I am cringing: This is Deschutes. I absolutely love their beer, and we were all really looking forward to this visit. Our waitress basically tainted Deschutes for us.

I tried the noodle bowl with spicy chicken and lots of fresh veggies, kimchi (warm and cold) pickled veggies topped with sirracha.  The first bite was really good and warrants 4 stars.  Probably the first 3 or 4 bites as the pickled veggies, sirracha, spicy chicken flavors all blended really well with fresh spinach, cucumber and carrots.  The reduction to 3 stars from my perspective is from the JapChae or sweet potato noodles as they get 2 stars at best.  Normally JapChae can stand on its own with a good flavor but this version actually took away from the other flavors.  Not sure if it was slightly burned or just too much soy type sauce or what that flavor was but it wasn't clean or complementing.  Also didn't dig the warm kimchi but that is just my preference as I only like cold sauerkraut as well as kimchi.  I'll definitely try this again as the rest was very good.

I had a yoga class later and didn't want to be well...crunked upon arrival.\\n\\nThe menu wasn't as impressive as I'd hoped for a place called Gourmands and I settled on the Po Po. Now this leads me to another question about restaurants and sandwich names in particular. Why do restaurants feel the need to take a typical sandwich and name it something else particular to their place? The Po Po is a BLT. The blt is a classic sandwich which needs no additional flare but why the rename? The world may never know. I personally find it pretentious and annoying.\\n\\nThe sandwich was ok. I got it on white bread so at to not distract from bacony goodness and the bacon was thin. It's cheap restaurant bacon. I want thicker cut slices of meat but I'm a snot who writes yelp reviews of a blts at 230am so consider the source. The lettuce was shredded iceberg which I don't have issue with. I enjoy shredded lettuce on a sandwich as it makes it easier to chew and other than it falling off regularly it's nice texturally.\\n\\nI got a small amount of potato chips with my sandwich and had some of what I'll call home pickles. If they weren't made in house I'd be surprised but it was a nice accompaniment. A little onion, some carrots just a nice additional garnish.\\n\\nThe Stash IPA was tasty and true to my roots, I felt completely trashed sitting in the bar on one beer.

Really tight jeans on an emaciated frame wearing pink sunglasses when it's daylight outside.
