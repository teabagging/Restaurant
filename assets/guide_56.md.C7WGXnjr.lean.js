We also learned at this location that they charge for cream cheese and they charge for the tiny little free packages of jelly. I asked my boyfriend to go ask them for some grape jelly. They CHARGED him for it and gave him strawberry jelly. I took the strawberry jelly back and explained that we wanted grape. The man said they did not have grape and that he'd told my boyfriend that. I asked my boyfriend if the man had told him that, of course the answer was no. The man proceeded to stick with his original story that my boyfriend was lying and that he'd told him. Finally a nice lady came to the counter and offered me a refund for the jelly since they didn't even have what we asked for. \\nWhile we were there another man ordered a cup of milk and they told him they did not have milk. The man told them that he frequents that location and gets a cup of milk every time he is there. They then gave him a cup of milk that was about 1/8 full. Rightfully so the man got really mad and asked for a full cup of milk which he had just paid for!! Why lie that they don't have milk??

I think my favorite part about it was the crust! It was great!\\n      When i walked in i only saw 3 'flavors' pepperoni, cheese and pepperoni with mushroom i believe. They have a lot of variety of sodas on tap and also imported bottle sodas for sale. They also have merchandise for sale and the decor is retro-cool.

All items were tasty and satisfying, with interesting ingredients, sauces, and accompaniments. We particularly loved the crabcake w/scallop, and as crabcake-loving Marylanders, we're not easy to impress.\\n\\nOur service, though formal, got a little leisurely at times.

Apparently they do not put sauce on the sandwiches, but I think maybe you have to request it. Unfortunately, I never got that message and therefore had a very dry sandwich.

Broder deserves it. And here's why.\\n\\nBroder makes awesome food. There's no question about it. I wouldn't know authentic Danish/Swedish food if it came up and bit me on the ass. Be it authentic or not, it is delicious. Broder offers a small menu of breakfast and lunch. Breakfast consists of assorted baked scrambles, some hash (including a smoked trout hash), ableskivers, waffle with ham, breakfast sandwich, and breakfast bords (boards with meat, egg, cheese, etc). The lunch menu is replete with grilled sandwiches, burgers (lamb burger, yum!), and other delights. Everything is made with quality ingredients, and cooked with love. I frankly have not had anything there that has left me wanting...\\n\\nI have enjoyed the lamb burger, the smoked trout baked scramble, the duroc ham and Swedish farmhouse cheese baked scramble, a special pork shoulder hash, the smoked trout hash, the ableskivers (little pancake balls served with lemon curd, lingonberry jam, and maple syrup), the potato pancakes, the sauteed greens, and some sort of baked rummy cherry cakey thing. Everything was top notch. Cooked on cast iron, using plenty of clarified butter, and frankly delicious ingredients. I would quickly order any of the above items again, were I not on a mission to try everything on the menu.\\n\\nBroder is small, and very comfy. It has a somewhat modern feel, but is appointed with very tasteful wood decorations. It's definitely IKEA meets... well... IKEA.  The only downside is that its small. Is that really a down-side? Well, it depends. Weekends can get a tad hectic. This equates to longer than normal wait times. But, that's the catch. Broder has a one-man stove, and paired with one line cook, they just can't turn tables as fast as a larger restaurant. The up-side to this, though, is that everything is made personally to order, and the quality is simply not diluted. Food this good should be worth waiting for. \\n\\nNow, consider yourself duly warned. Breakfast can take a WHILE here on weekends. If you want fast food, go somewhere else. If you need to be in a hurry, then hurry to a different breakfast spot.\\n\\nThe staff at Broder is simply amazing. I have never had less than 5-star service. That, combined with the excellent food, merits 5 stars from me. Even if I have had to wait a long time for my food on some occasions. \\n\\nI look forward to returning on a morning when I can enjoy a bloody mary or an Aquavit to start off my day.

This was my first time at the restaurant and I came for my birthday and chose this restaurant personally after seeing the menu, but unfortunately it may be my last even though I adored the food. \\nI did make a reservation on open table for a birthday and added in the notes that I may have a party of 8-9 since it was a birthday party a week in advance. I received a voicemail the day of my event that my party could not be accommodated due to the number. I called back and asked could I speak to the manager who left the message and even though I heard her in the background ask \\"she wants to speak with me\\" she never came to the phone. The hostess, speaking for the manager, said she said we can't do parties larger than 6 and I could cancel my reservation and sit on on the patio instead. I said I understand and asked if their was a way since I made reservations that we at least get tables close and she said that wouldn't be possible (Even though the restaurant has a 8 seater high top table at the front). \\nWith that said I came. \\nOnce I arrived I was told by the manager there is a cake fee of 20$ which I'm not sure why I wasn't made aware of when I was called earlier in the day when I discussed this was for a large birthday party. I think it should be stated when confirming reservations or added to the website. If I missed it I apologize. \\nI called ahead that a few of my guests were running late due to traffic. We waited but since it was so late we would have lost our reservation so the hostess said she would allow us to still keep a partial reservation but we had to give the table back by 8pm so I felt my party had to be rushed which I guess was our fault because of construction. \\nNow the GOOD PART but the conclusion isn't good!\\nMy guest spared no expense and ordered nearly every appetizer. The Goat Cheese was so flavorful! It was a hint of sweet and dances in your mouth. The coconut shrimp had a exquisite pineapple sauce and were divine. The calamari is the best I've had in the city. I ordered a drink that the waiter recommended which was Amazing, and I don't even drink bourbon! I don't remember the name but it had a pear on the rim. The lobster Mac was well made. The lobster wontons had a jelly on top which made them a different taste and texture but I loved them. And the fried green tomatoes were so fresh and the sauce complimented it perfectly. \\nNow on to my meal I got the tossed stir fry attached. Absolutely The Best out of all the dishes on the table and everyone of my guest agreed it was their #1 out of everything. I added the coconut brown rice and it is A MUST if you order because it's subtle but add a hint of flavor. Sauce was good and it had a mixture of lobster, mussels, scallions, and various vegetable which were so fresh! I got full and was told I only had the table until 8 due to some guest not able to arrive within the half hour window so we had to bag up the food so we could be served the cake. Luckily they were gracious to let us to go that 8 pm window for my cake. \\nDuring dessert we notice the waiter who had been kind never brought my meal bagged with the other appetizers!\\nHe admits he accidentally THREW IT AWAY!! Which would be fine but I had barely eaten it. \\nTo accommodate he sent the manager over. He said he could either give me half off that meal I had or half off the same meal so I would come back. My mother asked could maybe the cake fee we weren't aware of be removed with the half off to which he said \\"I can't do both\\" he stood waiting on my answer so with great aggregation (but was still polite) I accepted cake fee removal. \\nSo for my birthday I bought, FULL PRICE, a delicious meal that I barely was able to eat because we were told we needed to give the table back by a certain time because traffic cause my party to be 30 min late, all because I opted to have a cake fee removed that I didn't know about until I was there. \\nHappy birthday to me and I chose that establishment.

I typically visit 2-3 times  prior to leaving the city. During my first visit I advised that they needed to open a location in Atlanta, GA. I was immediately advised that it was already in the works! A few nights ago, I was browsing Yelp- and thought my eyes were deceiving me!! The Amelie's of Atlanta has arrived !! I was so excited and made plans to go for lunch on Friday. Upon arriving, I noted that there was a ton of parking in the back, as well as next door. ( the parking next door appears to be for Thumbs Up Dinner, but there is no sign posted stating you can not park in the lot). When I walked in, I felt like I was home. The decor is very similar to the Charlotte location. Next I walked to the counter and saw my beloved caramel brownies!-they taste like heaven in your mouth! I did notice that the assortment of baked goods is not as extensive as the Charlotte location. I also noted that the staff handling some of the baked goods was not always practicing best practices for food handling. For example, she had on plastic gloves, but rubbed her nose with the gloves on! That is not cool!!! She also used the hands covers in gloves to open the fridge and then touched the macaroons--- again-- not cool!! PLEASE HAVE A TALK WITH ALL OF YOUR STAFF ABOUT SAFE PRACTICES!! I want to be a returning customer. Back to the review- I placed an orders of chicken salad croissant, spicy thai soup and MY ALL TIME FAVORITE Chai Latte!!! The food was decent, and my Chai Latte was exactly as I remembered it!! I tried a Chai  Latte for the first time at the restaurant and to date can not find one that compares!   I will also note that the location seems a bit out of place. I was expecting a much larger crowd. I hope they market this gem so that it can remain a part of Atlanta! Last, but not least, the caramel brownie was good, however, it appeared to have been previously frozen as it was a lot harder that I  am accustomed to it being.

The first time I ordered takeout from here, the I waited 5 minutes for the pizza to come out. On my 5 minute drive home it was already cold.. decided to try again a couple months later in hopes of a better pizza experience. Even worse. We ordered a large margherita pizza, we weren't told there was only one size for pizza and we were 2 people sharing.. that's fine. But once we got home, my sister noticed a hair on her slice, she picked it off and ignored it thinking it was her own... then I found a piece of hair BAKED into the dough. Absolutely disgusting. I called the restaurant in hopes of receiving some decent customer service and getting a refund for the pizza. I spoke to an extremely rude woman who claimed she was the manager. Told me in order to get a refund I have to bring the hairy piece of pizza back to the location and they would make me a new pizza. I don't want another pizza from this place! I asked if there was anything else she could do for me, as the manager, and she said no. I told her I would be going on yelp to write a review of my experience with the food and customer service and this \\"manager\\" HUNG UP THE PHONE ON ME. Extremely disappointed in this place!

As most of you may know, Mr. Mueller is getting positive pub and how. It's definitely with good reason that he's featured on the cover of Texas Monthly with the Aaron Franklin, and if JMueller doesn't explode in popularity like Franklin's, it'll be a major upset.\\n\\nRight now, John Mueller has his act in a South First trailer, smoker in tow. With a Super Bowl Sunday Pants Party on tap, I figured picking up some Central Texas 'cue prior to the Houston return trip would be legen-WAIT FOR IT!-dary. \\n\\nWith some natural dryness expected from the cooling/reheating process, I had to sneak a few bites of the brisket right after picking it up. And let me tell you: It. Is. Spectacular. The brisket is thickly cut, wonderfully fatty, and smooth as butter as it melts in your mouth. The thick cut is most reminiscent of Snow's, and though I'd still put Snow's above JMueller, it's a closer battle than I expected.\\n\\nThe turkey was nicely moist, and as most smoked turkey is, the least seasoned and most in need of the thin, yet slightly chunky, BBQ sauce. Here we pause for a brief interlude from strictly meat to talk flavor. JMueller loves pepper. I mean, he absolutely douses everything in it. There's a spiciness to every dish that yearns for a dollop more of hot sauce (which is how I do it at Rudy's). The BBQ sauce has a wonderful blend of spicy and sour, the thinness likely stemming from a heavy hand on the vinegar bottle. Likewise, the potato salad was my favorite side, more mashed than chunked with ample vinegar and mustard seed taste.\\n\\nOK, now back to the meats. The beef sausage was only average to me. I'm not a huge sausage fan to begin with, though I do appreciate the difficulty of utilizing beef as opposed to the easier, fattier pork. But the sausage was just a mite too crumbly, a little under the requisite fat content to make that just right flavor explosion.\\n\\nThe pork ribs were coated in pepper, and having never liked pork ribs, I can't speak to the flavor. My Louie Mueller-loving friend took one look at the entire meat spread and immediately likened it to the Taylor, TX legend.\\n\\nSide-wise, the cole slaw was full of a peppery chipotle flavor, and if you're not careful it'll set your mouth on fire. The baked beans are dirty, with chunks of meat (brisket, I think). Both were fine, and as I mentioned, the potato salad was my favorite.\\n\\nAt this point, you may be asking yourself: why just a four star review? Well, as I first outlaid, I had called in the order in advance. After receiving a massive box of meats and sides, I loaded it up and hastily checked it before leaving Austin. First, I thankfully was keen enough to notice the order was missing the sausage, which I circled back to pick up. It was a difficult chore to check, as the butcher paper/styrofoam wrapping was woefully ill-prepared to contain the oily, sauce-plussed, greasy mess. After a 2 and a half hour drive home, my cooler looked like a BBQ Chainsaw Massacre scene.\\n\\nBut most egregiously, the fine folks at JMueller had packed pork ribs instead of my ordered beef ribs. And given that beef ribs are the piece de resistance here, (and a rarity amongst barbequeans in general, certainly a difficult chore to procure in Houston) that one really hurt. Now, I'll often turn a blind eye to customer service if the food is spectacular (see: Gatlin's BBQ), but not getting to try the food at all? That's a major ding.\\n\\nI will say that Mueller and company are exceptionally friendly, and run a pretty efficient shop as compared to the early days of Franklin's. I expect they'll expand soon, and hopefully the next time I visit, there will be a happy medium between wait time and meat availability so I can try those supposedly amazing short ribs. I'll be waiting with bated barbeque breath.\\n\\nNOTE: John Mueller has reopened a new business (http://www.yelp.com/biz/john-mueller-meat-company-austin)"},{"name":"Ganko Ittetsu Ramen","address":"318 Harvard St, Unit 3","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"BOTTOM LINE:\\nIf you have a couple of more minutes to spare, walk towards Pikaichi in Allston!

We went on a Saturday at an off time (around 3pm) and still had to wait a couple of minutes.\\n\\nFOOD:\\nThey had special ramens on the board, which was fun. I got the tan tan ramen:\\n- the noodles were really tasty and had bite to it, which I love. \\n- they add a ton of bean sprouts in, which I also love -- adds crunch and freshness into a heavy bowl of ramen.\\n- Soft boiled eggs are cooked to perfection (make sure to order it! It's worth the extra $$). \\n- My main complaint was the lack of meat -- there is ground meat sprinkled on top and I got one sheet of pork to go along with it. Felt like that was a bit stingy.\\n- The broth is a little lighter than other ramen places -- so, if that's your preference, this is your place! I prefer heavier, fattier broths so it was a bit of a disappointment.\\n\\nEither way, it's a great (but not fast) option for ramen in Coolidge Corner -- a rarity, but not your best option if you've got time and steps to spare!"},{"name":"Stoli Bar & Restaurant","address":"213 Washington St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"My wife's boss, who loves vodka, came to town.

Jinya also doesn't take phone bookings which also make it really frustrating.\\n\\nBeing a patron myself with this restaurant who makes at least 3-4 visits in a 2-3 week period on an average,  I definitely feel let down and the overall suffering of the customer experience.

There were 5 in our party, 3 of them got the chicken fried chicken on recommendation of the waitress. They said it was ok, but lacked seasoning it should have had. I had the chicken and dumplings with a sis of dumplings and sweet potato casserole. The chicken and dumplings were as good as I have had before.... I loved them... the sweet potato casserole had WAY too much clove or some other very strong seasoning.... both my wife and I took about 2 bites and stopped eating it. I do like the way you have to order since you write down what you want. Although they ask what you want for desert before you have even eaten a thing... so we went ahead and ordered anyway... I had the banana pudding and my wife had the peanut butter pie... the banana pudding was not very good... took 3 bites and could not take much more... flavor was way off and texture was sort of watery... my wife's was not much better... way too much peanut butter flavor.... so if I ever come back to this location will only get the dumplings.... \\n\\nThere is one thing about this place that most do not notice, but there are no real straight lines... with the age of the building and the way they took all those single shops and made one out of it they had to make due with what they had...."},{"name":"Rosie's Coffee Cafe","address":"2330 Sylvan Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This little spot was great!

On those rare sunny PDX days with cerulean skies nothing beats sitting outside eating al fresco unless you're guzzling down a massive tureen of green curry with chicken, kabocha squash, bamboo shoots, eggplant, & basil but a measly $5.50.  Tack on a can of soda for $1 to maintain those fluid levels.  I'm still eating the leftovers despite enthusiastic help from the pooch & Capt Hook, they're such givers I tells ya.  Easily 2-3 times the amount you get elsewhere for the same price.  \\n\\nThe sauce is a bit runny but still flavorful tho not as sweet as the green curry at the Thai cart that my heart resides at (read: Sawasdee).

I'm talking about authentic, honest, delicious ramen with no ifs, ands or buts. Jinya Ramen is the closest we get to this Japanese paradigm of perfection in Atlanta at a reasonable price. \\n\\nNow I don't expect literally perfect ramen from a place that sells it for pretty cheap; granted, some people would say, in indignation, they would never pay for 12$ of ramen! Well well, this is not fehttuchini alfredo my friend, this is art. This is Jinya ramen. \\n\\nI've been here I don't even know how many times, probably 10 at this point, and I think I've tried every single type of their ramen. It's delicious. I really can't say anything else. The ingredients are fresh, the noodles the almost perfect consistency, and proper Japanese garnishes too. Also unlimited garlic you can put on yourself; is there anything less amazing than that? Tonkatsu black, the chicken ramen, the sprouting up ramen - every single one is unique and delicious. I almost end up ordering two every time I go there, but resist with every ounce of my being. Ever since coming home from vacation in Japan I've craved such ramen, and I think this is the closest I'll get (without paying an arm and a leg). \\n\\nThe Japanese fried chicken is also very delicious, fried very crispy and the dumplings also good. If you have broth leftover you can even buy extra noodles. The only thing preventing me from driving there right now is that it's closed, my mouth is watering. \\n\\nPlease, PLEASE come here if you have a chance. It's just one of the best ramen places in Atlanta hands down. Beware the weight, and avoid peak times on the weekends, the wait can be well over an hour.

However, man is just that, man, and man while made in the image of the god(s) he/she was also given free will and with that the ability to deny gods. Lesson learned... LISTEN TO GOD.\\n\\nFor you non-religious types, let me re-explain my position in a less dramatic and less theological manner. When a restaurant's reviews (and a lot of them) are questionable, chances are better than good you're going to have a questionable experience. It gives me great faith when these realities are as certain as death and taxes.\\n\\nSo why the long lead in, well, a while ago, I was visiting friends in Richmond and the Blue Canoe was the destination of choice for supper. Cool, seafood on the water, in BC? Yeah that sounds like fun, but just like that time back in college where you hooked up with that person you had a bad vibe about, only to wake up the next morning itchy, I had a bad feeling about Blue Canoe when I looked at their reviews...\\n\\nUpon arrival I was taken aback, the view around the Blue Canoe was just breathtaking. Truly something amazing. We had a good sized group and a reservation and took up a good portion of the rear dining room.\\n\\nOur server arrived and introduced himself, nice chap, and we decided to order a series of shareable appetizers to split amongst the table, along with a round of drinks. There were several orders of ceviche, pickle chips, haddock and chips, Brussels sprouts and even oysters for some (me). This is pretty much where the wheels started to fall off this wagon. Drinks came out, and ice tea was brought out for one of our group but it was left on the back of another tables booth, and there was some confusion about who ordered what.\\n\\nOver to the sharable portions, the top performers were the ceviche and the oysters - neither one really requiring that that much hands on work from the kitchen. As for any of the cooked items, I think someone really likes their food well done. Brussel sprouts 'had' some sort of seasoning to them but that was masked by the char from being over cooked and burnt. The pickle chips were just chips and required a heafty amount of dip to be edible. And the fish, while moist inside, the batter had been cooked to a point of dark brown as opposed to light golden brown. This could be a by product of either dirty oil OR what I assume was over cooking.\\n\\nFor my main, there was a house special for the night that sounded just wonderful. A Thai curry filled seafood style hot pot which was supposed to come with an assortment of fresh seafood, cooked with said curry inside a phyllo pastry topped bowl baked in the over. Yum, right? Not so fast, you forgot the wheels were shaky right? Yep, this is where they fell the EF off. My food was the last to arrive, NBD, and when it did it look yummy! I excitedly poked through the pastry and... nothing. The bowl was about ¬º filled with what appeared to be mostly yellow curry broth. I reached in to grab a lone shrimp and my fingers made contact with something freezing cold - yes the veggies inside were still cold. I then grabbed the shrimp and pulled it to my mouth only to see as the curry ran off of it that the shrimp too was 100% uncooked. Barf.\\n\\nI immediately summoned the waiter and showed him, his response was immediately apologetic and offered to \\"take care of it right away\\". Great! Happy, with his response and then overjoyed when he brought me a complimentary Caesar salad to make up for it, I was more than happy to wait. About 10-15 minutes later he came back with a piping hot brand ne... errr, same dish as I had before? - with a hole in the philo right where I had left it before. \\n\\nSeems like without asking my preference he had the staff toss it back into the oven and give it a quick nuke to bring the internal temperature of the \\"soup\\" up while burning the old philo on the top. I was shocked. Isn't the SOP (standard operating procedure) to automatically make a brand new dish for the customer or at least ask if they'd like it warmed up or something new. One of my friends asked the question I was too shocked to ask myself, and the server said \\"yes we warmed it, should I not have served it?\\" Well if you don't know I really cannot tell you. Game over.\\n\\nThey receive partial marks for location, setting, and some of the appetizer courses we had but zero marks for everything else. Average, 2 star. Would I return here? Nope.

In fact, it seemed that many doughnuts available at the time didn't really excite me. \\n\\nI ended up ordering a doughnut with fruit loops which tasted exactly like it sounds. Wasn't bad, but didn't wow me either. I think the majority of these doughnuts are more about the design than taste.\\n\\nBetween the three of us, we had a box of doughnuts to go. By the morning, nobody wanted to eat any of them which resulted in the trash a few days later. I do appreciate the unique style that this place has, but I just don't see myself being that excited to go back now that I've been there and done that."},{"name":"Steak on Fire","address":"7541 Sand Lake Rd, Ste A","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"I was craving steak and decided to finally see what this restaurant had to offer.

There isn't much difference in price between the various cuts.  So we tried each of them.  \\n\\n We had the plates for dinner, as they have bigger steaks and have plenty of potatoes and grilled veggies.  Everything was seasoned and cooked perfectly.  The chimichurri sauce was very nice and served on the side.  \\n  \\n  The service and preparation is welcoming and quick, at least when we were there for an early dinner - which wasn't very busy until after we came.  Ordering is at the counter, and soft drinks are self-service.  Other than that, the front person handles your order and serves, even checking a few times to see if you need anything.

The Mac and cheese was really the star of that entree. The collards had a subtle sweetness to them which was different but welcomed. The chicken was fried to perfection and had an excellent crunch, but was a little under seasoned for my taste. The lobster fried rice was bomb. Especially when I added a few  drops of the pineapple glaze and peanut hoisin sauce. I also got to taste the homemade peach brandy ice cream for dessert. I'm not a peach fan by far but the ice cream was really nice!

They're good but a bit on the sweet side for a bourbon and a mezcal drink but it's fine. \\nThe food comes from yet another person (#5, but it's the runner I'm guessing) and my wife receives an overpriced cauliflower mash  with puff pastry which is not bad but small for almost $20. My burger which had a delicious cabbage slaw had nothing else good to mention. In short a 80% burnt not blackened burger with a cold center and a soggy bun. \\nAnd I'm done at this point. I put it aside and then promptly get asked if I wanted it wrapped. Nope. I in the most polite way lose it and tell this quite nice girl how deeply disappointed I am with everything. She offers to have my meal remade but at this point we just wanted to call it quits. She was sweet and comps the burger and our two cocktails. Shortly after my wife finishes, the drink and water glasses have been empty and we have to wave someone down again (maybe #6 but who's counting at this point) to get our check. I wish I was joking but another staffer from earlier asks if we need anything else while waiting for the bill. \\n\\nSidenote: the couple at the end of our table is overheard asking who and where is their server and then where is their check. \\n\\nSo, nice staff when apologizing and great cabbage slaw.

And...\\n\\nBe prepared to have your own fork if you order to go through a delivery system. $10 calzone was over $21 by the time it got to me, in part because of an additional charge the restaurant adds. Say what? I pay the delivery fee plus tip plus a fee for the restaurant handing food to the person I paid to pick it up??  Mkay...\\n\\nBut what really bugged me was that a calzone came on a paper plate in a box with two unrequested sides of cheese in plastic container with plastic lids and a coffee cup of sauce with a plastic lid but nothing to eat it with. When I called to suggest to the manager that sending a fork with a calzone would be a good idea he said it was to cut down on plastic waste and that they do serve calzones in the restaurants with silverware but that I would have had to make a special request for a plastic fork to come with delivery. That I should had thought to ask for them for one. Pardon??\\n\\nSo you'll send two plastic containers, a cardboard box, a paper cup, a paper plate, paper bag for the plastic container but you won't send a fork? Or a single solitary napkin???  And then you'll put it on the person ordering it to request it? \\n\\nI'm all for being environmentally friendly but guys, I'm not cool with having to throw away 6 pieces of trash plus lids and then be told I'm wasteful to ask for a fork. Not to mention there's no place on the app the restaurant uses to request said fork. \\n\\nHave to laugh a little because it's so backward and silly but when you haven't eaten and it's 9:30pm and the only option you have is delivery it's a little much to pay double for your order with no way to eat but with your hands.

I had a cheeseburger, which they call a planche burger ($14).  It was laughably tiny. Nothing but a slice of cheese, beef (not bad, albeit miniscule), a bun, and some sort of vinegary secret sauce.  A lot like what you might get at White Castle. Speaking of vinegar, it's their little trademark, and they leave it everywhere like like an aggressive animal's trail of spoor. It's in the sauces, on the vegetables. It's even in the drinks. I tried my friend's mocktail and it tasted like a cut watermelon that'd been left out in the Texas sun for three days because everyone got so drunk at the picnic they forgot to clean up until their mom finally made them.  We were told the $12 deserts were massive; big enough to share. Certainly they were larger than the garnishes to most desserts, but not by much.

They also have valet at one of the restaurants so you are sharing this small lot with the valet & as we all know there's parking spots you just can't self park at bc it's for valet, what a pain. Due to the parking situation my food was semi cold. I'm also  not too thrilled about the portion I received for $15 (see photo attached).

I enjoyed the clear coffee cups and the little bowls that things came in. Came across well. \\n\\nI'll repeat what everyone else is saying. There's a long wait. BUT!

Their dining month menu offers two choices for each course, so we decided to order one of each.\\n\\nFirst up, two different timbales. The causa solterito is a timbale of  lime-scented Yukon Gold potato with a salad of green beans, fresh corn, cotija cheese and tomatoes. The causa morada features lime-scented purple potato and shredded chicken breast with aj√≠ amarillo. Both are served chilled, so essentially they are little dishes of potato salad. The presentation was pretty, but overall they were a bland in flavor. I couldn't detect any hint of lime in either dishes, or any real seasonings other than salt. \\n\\nWe finished the first course, satisfied but hoping the next course would be better. \\n\\nThe quinotto \\"chisaya mama\\" offered for the second course was amazing and the only reason I'm giving three stars to this review. Beautifully presented, it was also delicious in the mouth. Quinoa is made into a risotto for this dish Grana Padano cheese, golden beets, tiny mushrooms, and local vegetables. It was creamy with a slight crunch in all the right places. I could eat this dish all day long.\\n\\nThe lomo saltado, on the other hand, was lacking. In this dish beef tenders are fried with onions, tomatoes, oyster sauce, garlic and aj√≠ amarillo then served with Yukon Gold papas fritas and garlic rice. I really liked the garlic rice, it had a great flavor to it. But the fries weren't crisp enough, the beef was scarce in the dish, and the sauce was lacking in flavor. I expected a bit of spice in the dish, but there was none that I could really detect.\\n\\nFor dessert, the chocolate andina is a brownie made from quinoa flour, layered with ganache and finished with a fruit gastrique and avocado creme anglaise. I was excited for this dish, it sounds incredibly innovative. But it wasn't. The brownie was really a slice of cake, very thick and heavy cake. I couldn't really taste the ganache and the fruit gastrique was nothing more than a couple of saucy raspberries perched atop the slice. The avocado creme anglaise was tasty, very light and creamy. it was a good counter to the heavy cake.\\n\\nThe other dessert, alfajor, was solid. The cookie, scented with key lime and filled with manjar blanco, had a nice bite to the exterior with a soft interior enhanced by the sweet, citrus infused cream.\\n\\nOverall, I felt like the dishes at Andina were more focused on the beautiful presentation than the quality of the food. Every single plate was artfully arranged, but with the exception of the quinotto the fare was uninspired and boring. While the service, location, and ambiance were all excellent, I was disappointed with our food experience.

My husband was disappointed to find out that they were out of meatloaf, so he decided to go with the hamburger.  I ordered the chicken pot pie and my son had the kids mac&cheese.  We also started with two appetizers, deviled eggs and pimento cheese with homemade chips.  The deviled eggs were delicious (trust me, I have had deviled eggs in all the farm to table places in Winter Park and Lake Mary). These were the best.  I loved the pimento cheese with homemade chips. The pimento cheese was made in house with real shredded cheese, pimentos and even little roasted jalapenos. Both appetizers are addictive. My husband reported the hamburger was hand made and cooked perfectly. The fries were cooked as ordered (crisp) and overall, it was a good meal. My chicken pot pie was not traditional. I miss the pie crust but the flavor was good, the base with thick with good chunks of chicken, potato and vegs. It had a biscuit laying on top.  It was good but not flaky.  When a salad came out to another table, I decided that was my next time meal. My son loved the homemade mac and cheese.  We also tried the coleslaw. It had pineapple with a bit of pepper with crisp cabbage.  It was good but I think next time, I will try something different.  It was great that they have a variety of ice cream, banana pudding and ice cream cookie sandwiches for dessert.  LOVED IT ALL.  I hope when they are in full mode, they add some cool specials each week. I would like them to add the option of fruit as a side (especially for the kid's meal), even if it is just grapes and mandarin oranges.\\n\\n\\nThe service was very good even with a new employee at the register.

When it did come, the cornbread muffins were rockhard on the outside and crumbly only in the very center. In edible really. It was dinner time. You are a restaurant. You should have the food and bread prepared for your customers. Oh and the cinnamon rolls, they are pretty puny and it's just their roll dough rolled then sprinkled with a tiny bit of cinnamon and sugar and rolled up and a tiny bit of cinnamon and sugar sprinkled on top. I wouldn't really call it a cinnamon roll per se, there is nothing gooey about it, it's more like a firm bun. and the rolls are really squishy and soft, more like a cinnamon roll would be. So they were the opposite of what we expected. A local warned us that we would be better off going across the street to Papis and we should have listened. I say skip this place and go to Cracker Barrel because it's about the same level of food and about as Southern."},{"name":"Bison County BBQ Bar & Grille","address":"275 Moody St","city":"Waltham","stars":"3.5","text":"My wife and I went on a Sunday night.

However, this location was a disappointment. Going into the store, I quickly browsed the Yelp reviews to find a usual amount of low ratings. I was puzzled but knew that By Chloe had always been a solid experience. This time however I was severely disappointed in the food.\\n\\n I ordered the original burger with sweet potato and regular fries. While the food was fast, everything was cold as if they weren't prepared fresh. The fries were SEVERLY undercooked and VERY soggy. Some may claim that that is what airfyers do, but at the other locations, they are somewhat crispy and delicious. They weren't even busy, so they had plenty of time to prepare a meal and leave it in the airfyer longer. The only stand out was the chipotle aioli which is definitely 5/5.\\n\\nThe only reason I finished my dish was that I was starving, but after my meal, I just felt somewhat full but dissatisfied. If you plan on going to by Chloe, I would recommend the prepared items / baked goods as they are more likely to not screw up those items. I really wanted to enjoy a nice vegan dinner here but went home very upset. I'm going to contact By Chloe personally in hopes they improve this restaurant to the high standards of their other locations."},{"name":"Grindhouse Killer Burgers","address":"1842 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Mukbang at my favorite burger joint\\nCopy and paste \\nTo watch the video, if link is not accessible \\nhttps://youtu.be/okm28kQQZXk\\n\\n\\nBut I love this place to the death of me"},{"name":"Greg's Place","address":"2736 S Chickasaw Trl","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"The only place that knows what \\"extra crispy wings\\" means.

First of all, the \\"restaurant\\" took up a new location within the B concourse which pales with the old location in B spine. The place is cramped and the way they've divided up the space between the payment station, the beverage station and the condiment station is just maddening.

I've had my fair share of pizzas and after a certain standard they all seem to taste similar to me. \\n\\nBut this one is different. The dough for this pizza is what makes it special. It's crispy on the bottom and soft on top, with this delicious creamy taste. I could eat the crust with no toppings tbh and still think it's one of the better pizzas I've had. \\n\\nEveryday they offer a few different options for single slice pizzas. The day I went they had pepperoni and mushroom as well as spinach and ricotta. I got one of each as well as a slice of the margherita and split with a friend. \\n\\n3 slices between 2 people is definitely enough. The slices are large!

The miso ramen was loaded with vegetables - saut√©ed Napa cabbage with lots of bean sprouts. The pork was very well seasoned, and the 5 minute egg was perfect. My suggestion would be to pile the veggies a little less - I felt I was digging around too much just to find the noodles.

We tried Buffalo Wild Wings and it's okay, but the overall atmosphere just isn't us.  Through some searches here on Yelp I came across this place, Rockin' Wings.  \\n\\nOne night while deeply entrenched in family life The Wife and I were making dinner, a beautiful dinner, pork loin chops to be exact.  We were happily going along talking and starting to prep dinner when a smell wafted into the air.  The unmistakable odor of overheated Teflon and burning pork. Our unfamiliarity with a new pan charred the hide off that poor pig.  This prompted the question, \\"Where you wanna go eat?\\"\\n\\nIn we walked to the mini-mall slot known as Rockin' Wings.  A pool table to our right, video games to the left and what looked like a bar in the back made us wonder if this was a Tax Deduction friendly place for our four year old.  Just a harder glance around showed that it was and in we wandered.  Right by the order area is a tray with every sauce the place has to offer and celery sticks so you can try out whatever you want first.  Genius!\\n\\nNow The Wife and I are not what you would call fans of heat.  We are wimps actually.  This makes trips to some wing places difficult as some owners think that everyone wants HEAT.  Not true.  We ordered up 25 Wings with Honey BBQ sauce, Teriyaki sauce and one called Olin's Gold which I tasted and thought it had some spice but it was manageable.  The Tax Deduction veered off the wing track and went with a hot dog and fries.\\n\\nWhile waiting for our order we played some video games and looked over the hundreds of vinyl record covers posted on every wall.  The Wife and I went back to our youth recalling different memories from many album covers (albums predated CD's and cassette tapes for you youngin's out there).  We went to fill our drinks and was surprised to see an old style soda dispenser, one where you pull the tap forward, not click the metal bar.. been a while since I have seen one of those.  Very nostalgic but also hard to vend our soda without a big old foamy head.\\n\\nIn a very reasonable time our order arrived, and they were beautiful! (see photo).  Those large wing sections glistened under the lighting, sauce covered and arranged artfully.  They almost looked too good to eat.  Almost.  The teriyaki may well be the best we have ever eaten.  The BBQ had a great taste but we both commented on how amazingly sticky there were on our hands.  The Olin's Gold were excellent for the first couple, and then the heat set in.  I guess these have a time delayed fuse on them, and while not unbearable or pain inducing hot, they were most definitely reminding you that you had eaten them.  I did finish mine, and the taste is delicious but the heat was just a tad over my comfort zone.  Not Rockin' Wings fault at all, I probably didn't put enough on my celery stick to get the true heat.\\n\\nYou can bet that we have found our replacement for \\"Wingman\\"!  Rockin' Wings is amazing, has a comfortable space, great atmosphere and even better music playing.  They have some great games to play as well."},{"name":"Lee and Ricks Oyster Bar","address":"5621 Old Winter Garden Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Visited here for their 65th anniversary which is awesome considering they've been open since 1950 in Orlando. On their anniversary they occasionally (not every year) offer two-for-one buckets of their flagship menu item-buckets of oysters. So as you can imagine that sort of bargain brought out *all* the bivalve lovers in Orlando. The wait was over an hour on a Wednesday night and this was to be expected. The entry way (which I had a lot of time to look at) is interesting, it's like walking on board a ship. It's a little dark and dank, and there are seafood smells wafting out of the \\"portholes\\" that let you view the oyster bar while waiting in line. A suggestion: let people waiting in line order drinks. So many people waiting wanted something while they waited, this is an opportunity that has been untapped here. Liked that there was some vintage/historical photos of the founders, Leah and Rick. I should mention that the exterior of the building looks like a ship and the inside resembles a long bar with some booths and tables too. There is a lot of sea life related kitsch on the inside. So this is a 65 year old ship that borders on being divey, but that's a good thing. \\n\\nWhen we were seated at the oyster bar I was confounded at how basic and gritty the oyster process is...you order oysters and hunky guys with Popeye size forearms bring you the buckets and drop them off sort of in a trough area below the bar counter. I was panicked...how an I supposed to eat my oysters there? I can't reach! These guys (and I saw one woman) will delicately and expertly stand there and shuck oysters for you, one by one, then place them on the angled oyster bar for you. Honestly, I felt like I was getting some special treatment or something, but this is just how the place works for everyone.  They also have pitchers of beer that are pretty inexpensive, so we ordered one to share.  \\n\\nWith the oysters you get a sleeve of Saltine crackers, lemon juice in a squeeze bottle, clarified butter, horseradish, ketchup, salt, pepper, and hot sauce (by the way, I think real lemon slices would taste better). There are no plates at the oyster bar, just you and your oysters and condiment cups. This is the part that blew my mind, when you're done with the oyster shells you just push the shells over the back side of the bar into the trough. The process is so raw and fun. Know this, you will feel messy and splattered with oyster juice a little. I love that the napkin holders are mounted overhead. I wouldn't wear anything too nice or bother with wearing any jewelry because it's going to get juicy. I asked our shucker and the oyster sizes vary, so a bucket can be from 2-3 dozen depending on their size. One bucket is plenty for an average appetite.  There are other seafood items on the menu, but the night we went it was steamed or raw oysters only that were being served. I would definitely come back again. The oysters are super fresh and the experience was very lively and fun. For those that didn't enjoy this place, it's not for everyone. If you don't like seafood or if you sit at a table the experience is not the same. By the way, I suspect the joy stick on the Ms. Pac Man machine smells weird, so proceed with caution if you decide to play :)"},{"name":"Steak on Fire","address":"7541 Sand Lake Rd, Ste A","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Pretty much own the place at 5:30.

Constantly raising rent prices to the point where they have to charge insane amounts for the food, or they have to shut down the carts. There used to be many great carts and only a few okay ones are left. Not to mention how disrespectful the owner is to the community that lives next to them. I've had family members who live near by complaining about industrial garbage trucks waking up the neighborhood around 3-4 am.

The food was no where near the quality that we have had in the evenings. They weren't busy, but service was slow. We just decided that everyone has a bad day on occasion and left it at that. We made our last visit a few days ago. This time we went at 5:00. There were only a few customers. When our beans & chips came the chips were stale, the beans were dry & the bit of coleslaw on the side (my favorite) had a flat old taste. When our meal came we were cautioned about the hot plates. The plates were the only thing that was hot! The food was barely warm. My husband's order was wrong. We should have complained, but decided to just eat and be on our way.

Gave us the history of the place & his award winning of chucking oysters. If you can sit at the oyster bar.\\n\\nWe had the cherry stones clams, a must! Dozen oysters, seafood platter & COWDAH a must. We were also given corn bread which was perfect.

They were hitting all their marks. \\n\\nThe food was outstanding. I'm a bit of an oyster novice, but the ones I had here were much more flavorful than what I'd encountered at several other Atlanta restaurants. The tempura-fried green beans were solid, but one of the standouts of the enitre meal was actually the dipping sauce. It brimmed with confident dairy flavor that had just enough dill to keep it from being overly creamy. The broth with the clams and pork belly appetizer was like a firm handshake. Reassuring in its strength but stops before it crushes you in its grip. And the entree? The oysters were so good that we got a second order. \\n\\nI was also knocked over by my cocktails. My grandparents used to make a lot of Salty Dogs, so this entry to the cocktail list caught my attention immediately. The very fresh citrus was well balanced with the salted rim. I ended up having two. \\n\\nAlso, I love the overall layout. The place is really charming, with gigantic ceilings and exposed rafters that aren't too industrial.

The place was full on a Friday night, something the restaurant a few doors down could not say. All three Burgers at our table were overcooked and bland, but the lettuce, tomatoes and pickles on them were top notch. It made me wish I had ordered a salad! I suspect that tomato was an heirloom as it was quite flavorful, especially considering it is October in the PNW. \\nThe ketchup and fries were also great, giving me a peculiar nostalgia of fast food fries from my childhood. However, the roasted carrots tasted like grill smoke and oil more than anything else, and the Brussels were slightly burned for my taste but otherwise good in flavor. Everything took slightly longer to come out than I would expect from a well run popular restaurant. \\n\\nOur service was fantastic and our waiter was super attentive despite the demanding crowds. I really appreciated this touch. The hubster's cocktail was knock out fantastic and the highlight of the night.\\nOverall, I would not object if someone suggested we dine here again, but with all the great food in Portland, I won't be seeking The Fireside again for anything more than a cocktail by the fire."},{"name":"JINYA Ramen Bar","address":"5975 Roswell Rd, Ste B-217","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"OK. So, I went to JINYA with a couple friends and my sister around October 5th, this year. I'm just now writing this review because- well, it seems that I forgot to click the \\"Post Review\\" button when we went to eat. \\n\\nHere goes...\\n\\nI had the JINYA Tonkatsu Black with an added topping of brisket and an extra side topping of brisket. The brisket was AMAZING. It was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The tonkatsu broth was superb. I really had an umami-moment! They served it up with kikurage, pork chashu, and all the regular toppings, but something that really made it special for me was the boiled egg. They don't just boil their eggs in regular water. The boil them in broth! It makes for a soft-boiled egg with so much flavor it's almost a little taxing on your buds. \\n\\nI also got to try their takoyaki. The presentation was very nice and it was served on a bed of egg tartar with kewpie mayo. At first, I was like- \\"Wow. That's a lot of mayo.\\" Then, I found out it was egg tartar and that made for another dimension of flavor. Cool! If the takoyaki had been a little better (and served piping hot - as it should be), then it would have been a much better side dish. However, the flavor profile for that dish was pretty good, overall.\\n\\nFinally, I also had a chance to try the brussels sprouts tempura. I didn't think that one would be very good, but it turned out nice! It was crunchy and juicy. Why is that important information? Well, it's because of how unusual it is for something crunchy to also be juicy. A chef has to be careful to balance the batter so that it isn't too thick or too thin and they have to balance the cooking time to match the amount of batter to the cooking time of the vegetable. So, if anything is off, it's just bland and goopy or it's just hard and burned. I really liked touch of white truffle oil. It added a nice mouthfeel to the crunchy and juicy effects of the batter and brussels sprouts. \\n\\nIf I had to choose a best, it would most definitely be the tonkatsu broth. I drank mine down to the last drop and I left NOTHING in my bowl- except the \\"spoon\\". \\n\\nThe service? It was great. They weren't pushy and they somehow managed to sneak past our table a couple of times and magically refill my water and my sisters' coke twice- without me noticing. However, I did notice that one way they seemed to do this was that they have a pre-designated refill level that they can eye-ball as they walk past. I wouldn't have noticed, but there was a 45-degree mirror wall behind our table (and across the benched seating area above the faux greenery) that I could look directly into and see the rest of the restaurant. They try not to bother you about stuff like that and only interrupt your meal a couple times to ask if you need anything more and if you need the check. I enjoyed the sleek look of things with the modern touches on dishes and lighting coupled with the earthy tones that they instilled with the wood and faux greenery. I'll have to go back and take some pictures of the inside, because since the last photos were taken, they added a full-service bar and they changed the look of the inside a bit. \\n\\nSo, how did I do? Did I surprise you with my food memory? I definitely recommend this Sandy Springs location. I'll be trying the Buckhead location next go 'round to see if they have consistent service, flavor, and environment."},{"name":"Mizu Teppanyaki and Sushi","address":"809 Cypress Pkwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4","text":"Wonderful hibachi experience.

There was a lot of acidity, which is very necessary when eating kale, but the sweet flavor from the raisins cut through the acidity very nicely.  With the acidity and sweet covered, now we get to the best part of the salad: the saltiness.  I LOVED the bacon/pine nut combo and I thought that those two ingredients really brought the salad together.\\n\\nNow we get to the real homerun of the meal: the mussels.  WOW.  I have eaten a lot of mussels and really love the Italian mussel flavor (garlic, white wine, lemon) but this was just the ultimate curveball.  The main flavors of the mussel broth came from the Tecate beer, lime, and the hot sauce.  The hot sauce was the perfect level of spice to accompany the level of acidity that came from the lime.

This place was packed on a weeknight and I never felt rushed......server really took care of our group.\\n\\nAtmosphere- Fantastic, and doors open up to the street with beautiful tables.  Trouble is that it is so loud inside, and the noise just carries.  Add that with train whistle noise going by and it makes having a group get together a pretty solitary experience.  They can't really help the noise issue, no no fault to Hair of the Dog on that one.\\n\\nBeers- I'm just not impressed.  The Adam and the Ruth were decent pale ales, and while the Blue Dot is their famous one, I just feel that in our city full of IPA options, this one isn't all that great.  Floral certainly, but lacking any real hoppy backbone or citrus notes up front.  The value is bad however.  There are no pints here, just 12oz glasses, and at $4.75 is really overpriced.\\n\\nFood- Decent menu of sandwiches, salads, and sides.  Being vegetarian I'm fine with being limited, but apart from the ubiquitous mac n' cheese there weren't any real options for me food wise so I wasn't able to have dinner.  They do have some great cheese and cold cut plates you can split with a group, which is a really great thing to have and goes great with beer.  Some good mixed pickles too!\\n\\nOverall I was just really disappointed and felt a little price gouged.  Just my opinion of course, and I would encourage others to go and see for themselves.  For me, I'll stick with any number of craft breweries with a better value and food options for me."},{"name":"Landon's Restaurant & Bar","address":"3752 Cascade Rd, Ste 100","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"I went here for Mothers Day for the first time hoping for a better experience than I had at Paschals.

It's $21.95 for Sunday Brunch, so why was it $28.95 when I got there and that wasn't explained on the phone. Hell I had no choice but to stay and agree to the price because its too late to make reservations anywhere else in town. My waitress told me that AFTER I sat to the table for at least 7 minutes before she actually came to the table. I guess that stuff bothers me because I was a waiter before. The food ran out but the chef was out there to reassure everybody that everything was on its way.

Service was quick and very friendly and our food was up within 15 minutes. Their menu is ideal in that it has several combos that satisfy multiple tastes. Their gyoza was delicious with a crispy pan-fried outside that was browned nicely and a flavorful porky inside. The miso ramen was rich in flavor and super homey with plenty of noodles, crunchy seaweed, radish and loads of green onions. The soft-boiled marinated egg was the best and a fantastic creamy addition to the bowl. My only gripe was that I went with a gluten-free friend who is not a difficult diner at all! Her only ask was if she could do a bowl of broth without the noodles and more of all the other add-in's and a small side of rice and the waitress just wouldn't let her for any apparent reason.

They don't have the option for different sizes, so you'll just get a massive bowl of pho for I think $8-something. I got their house special which comes with rare beef, beef balls, tripe, and brisket. No complaints about the food, and I was definitely stuffed afterwards. The woman at the table beside me had a huge bowl of vermicelli, and despite not normally being a huge fan, I will say it smelled extremely good and was very enticing - definitely would like to try that next time I'm here.

I also had a burger with it, the Plancha burger, I will say I love that this burger was very light. kept going after this didnt feel at all greasy or heavy in my stomach like some greasier things can do to me. However to accomplish this it seemed to lack in flavor and the lack of sauce on it mixed with the extremely dry bun was a lot to swallow. The real pinnacle of my experience was the dessert, I WENT for the ice cream sandwich and it didn't disappoint, one of my favorite desserts ever! Can't wait to go back to get one:)"},{"name":"King + Duke","address":"3060 Peachtree Rd NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I have been here twice, but every time I visited, I pretty much tried everything off the menu. The ambiance is great and I recommend making reservations if you are planning to go because it's a popular place. There is parking available at the deck, but it's about 14 dollars for 3 to 4 hours. Valet is available as well. \\n\\nWaiters and waitresses are very knowledgeable of the food being served every day. The interior has nice furniture and comfortable sitting and the colors go well together. There are two floors and on the first floor, some of the food is made in the open. \\n\\nAppetizer:\\nPimento Cheese Hushpuppies - They are deeply fried with sweet jam like puree, pimento cheese, and mustard. Within the hushpuppies, there little red pepperish things, but you can barely taste them. The flavor is reach and if you like butter, you're going to like this. \\n\\nDeviled Egg - It's deviled egg... Nothing crazy or memorable \\n\\nBeef Tartare - It's very delicious. I am not a huge raw beef person at all, but however, when you bite into this, the texture reminds me of a really fatty salmon sashimi. It's seasoned quite well on top of great beef quality. \\n\\nRoasted Octopus - It was slightly on the salty side for me, but however it's still a good dish to eat. It is paired with olives, chilies, herbs, and winter roots, and when you bite into a piece, you should really try to get all of that all at once to have to full effect of the flavor. Everything is paired very well in the dish. \\n\\nCountry Pate - This is good, but it's nothing too fancy. Pate doesn't have the overwhelming buttery texture, and I kind of hoped that it would have the consistency that would roll out as a spread so it's easier to eat with. \\n\\nEntree:\\nAnything Lobster or Scallop Related Dishes (Their menu changes depending on what the restaurant procured as their ingredients for the day/week) - You have to try any of their lobster and/or scallop dishes. They are very good. One time, they used walnuts, citrus, and etc. to the lobster tail, and it was an awesome mixture. Another time, they had both scallop with lobster, and that came with toasted farro, radish, beurre monte, etc with it. It was really good and awesome combination of ingredients. \\n\\nFish (Any kind of fish) - Part of me feels like they can work on the fish a bit more. The Arctic Char, Loup De Mer, Swordfish, etc. were ok, and I found them over seasoned and too salty at times. \\n\\nPork Chop - Awesome and good portion. Enough said. Men, this is your dish. \\n\\nKC Strip - Awesome and good portion. Enough said. Men, this is your dish.  \\n\\n\\"The King\\" - Even bigger awesome and 32 oz of meat. The bomb. Enough Said. \\n\\nGarden Sides: \\nDepends what you like, and you have to ask how the vegetables are made. Some are too salty and too charred. \\n\\nDessert:\\nSticky Toffee Pudding - Don't get anything else in the dessert menu except this. It's a date cake if you are wondering what the main ingredient is. It comes with a melted caramel, pecan, etc. type of sauce in the bottom with oatmeal stout, but the date cake, you could never guess it was date. The dessert is awesome, and just get this. Trust me. I have tried everything in their dessert menu and nothing comes close to this one. \\n\\nWine and Cocktails:\\nGreat choices and great alcohol. The bartenders know what they are doing."},{"name":"Hardwood Pizza","address":"80 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This is probably my favorite pizza place in Austin.

Finally, we flagged a server down and made it clear we were ready to order. \\n\\nSkipped apps--they looked beyond boring/pedestrian and opted for the swordfish and 10oz bone-in steak. The swordfish was an odd cut of the fish, lackluster, bland and pretty flavorless not to mention that the currants were hard!!! A divey Greek place somewhere else in town could have topped this version with little effort. The steak with gnocchi was overcooked and they forgot a steak knife which literally took the server the whole meal to bring after we asked. He said it was difficult to find one. Both portions were very small especially for an almost $40 per plate price tag. Dessert was a cold chocolate molten cake (which needed 10-minutes to make only to come out cold) and a ginger ice cream which thankfully was excellent. \\n\\nThe live music and views were the best part, however, turn that ladies mic down!

I've also tried the Miso ramen which was delicious as well without being as heavy. I've also tried the Takoyaki here and found it super filling. Nice, big chunks of octopus in each ball with plenty of bento flakes on top and a bed of egg tartar on the bottom. My one complaint is how soggy the inside was, wish it had a more dense consistency. Service has always been good despite them getting very busy around lunch time. Parking can also be a pain due to the heavy construction and multiple shops that occupy this small lot.

It is in a shopping center and is a very small location. There is outdoor seating (which is nice when the weather is good), two small counter seating areas, and then maybe about four or five tables. Jinya has tons of ramen selections and everything I've eaten here is great. \\n\\nThings I like: Jinya has amazing quality ramen and all the food here is delicious. I normally order the Vegetable Soup Ramen. It is not your typical ramen dish, but the extremely fresh and abundant veggies in it always makes it my go to! I've never eaten anything bad here! \\n\\nThings I didn't like: Whenever I go to Jinya (which does tend to be Friday or weekend nights), there is a super long wait. If you choose to wait for a table, they will text your phone when a table is available which is nice because you can go do other things in the meantime. However, the wait has often been about 45 minutes or more every time I go, so I tend to go elsewhere because I don't want to wait that long. The restaurant is great, but the size of it makes it extremely difficult for them to manage weekend crowds.\\n\\nJinya has great ramen and I've always enjoyed my meal here! I would just suggest going during the week or during slower hours to avoid that wait!"},{"name":"Loyd Have Mercy","address":"3434 S Washington Ave","city":"Titusville","stars":"4.5","text":"Best Fried Chicken in Brevard County!

The portion sizes are decent but you still need to order at least an appetizer or dessert to feel full. The risotto was delicious and was topped with a lot of fresh Parmesan. The duck was delicious but there were very few pieces of it.

Since I've been abroad in London for 2 years, I frequently dreamt of these noodles.. now that I'm back, I'm happy to say that the noodles are still the same, and so are the prices. \\n\\nThough, I feel a bit silly in admitting that I've actually never had their \\"famous beef noodles\\", and have always stuck with the dumplings.  This is a massive dish in itself - 10 big dumplings with a generous serving of noodles.  Still my favorite.  Also, if you get dumplings on its own, make sure you get it IN SOUP.  My friend ordered the dumplings on its own (and didn't realise she had to specify the soup).  They came plain with some vinegar, soy and sesame oil to dip in.  I personally would've preferred soup with it! \\n\\nAlso, another kinda sneaky thing - if you are just looking for beef balls, meat.. or any of the noodle soup dishes, WITHOUT the noodles - it can be done.  They just don't give you the noodles, just meat + soup, for the same price (listed on the back menu).  I asked if you actually get a few more pieces of meat, but apparently you don't.  I think its kind of sneaky to advertise it this way.  \\n\\nAnyway, I'll keep coming back for their dumplings & noodles.

Over three days, I tried three times to come in to eat, only to find out that I was at the tail end of some service hour (they have distinct breakfast, lunch and dinner breaks). It wasn't as though I was randomly creeping in to the restaurant. I came when I heard and saw people. By the time I finally got here, it was more a matter of principle than desire. I *was* going to eat here, d@mmit!\\n\\nSo, I'm pleased to write that things are very tasty here. Since I was dining solo, I made my way to the communal table (to the right as you step in). No need for reservations or a wait. Just get in where you fit in. I sat and was approached by the very friendly server, Lowla. She asked if this was my first time in. I replied it was the first time I could *get* in. She laughed and asked me if I'd had time to look over the menu. Since I'd had a weird few days, I knew I needed booze. I asked her for her favorite drink and she led me to the sangria. Yes. Get this. It comes packed to the brim in a goblet, served with a lemon wedge & cherry and accompanied by a paper straw (that's actually functional). Had I not had to have coherent conversations later in the day, I would have ordered another. As it was, one put me in a very good mood.\\n\\nWhen it came time to order my food, I told Lowla that I needed to eat gluten-free. She laughed and told me that Calvin doesn't change his recipes for 'no one' so my choices were limited. I can appreciate that. I'm in his house. I made the choice to come here. I can't, then, dictate what he serves. Luckily, the curry shrimp with brown rice was gluten-free and absolutely delicious. Again, I was served a massive bowl of yellow curry, vegetables and a decent amount of large-sized shrimp. My only quibble is that I would have liked more rice. The portions are so large here (and they correspond to the prices; my curry was $19 and my brown rice was an extra $2) that the rice portion size was a bit curious... but I didn't mention anything because from the sound of it, you don't come for Calvin. Noted. I just kept it moving and ate my food.*\\n\\nPoor Calvin's is popular. The entirety of my time there, people kept coming. They sat at the bar. They sat outside. They sat by me. They ate. They drank (a lot). They sang (the playlist is fire). The bartenders and servers danced. The vibe is, well, vibrant. Calvin may like things done his way but it's his house so he gets the prerogative. I'd return for more time with the drink menu and another go at that curry. It was a process to eat/drink here but it was worth the wait.\\n\\n*Like New York instructed all those inclined to comment on something they shouldn't."},{"name":"Classic Bistro","address":"984 Morse Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Food is delicious and super authentic.

We made reservations for 8 and got there in time. There is valet as soon as you pull up. When we walked in I was surprised at how small it was inside. Small but not too tight. The hostess tells us that our table should be ready soon as the party before is is gathering to leave. Ok, no problem. There were 3 in our party so we go to the bar for drinks while we wait. Next to me I spied a chicken breast that looked just divine; golden and perfectly fried. Seeing it made me question the entree I came for, the infamous lobster fried rice! So we're yuking it up with the bartender who was really personable and made great suggestions, I had their version of a Moscow mule which had a twist of a sliced pear that you drop in the drink that changed it up! The Lychee martini was really good too. Ok so we're drinking and still waiting. The hostess keeps us updated, the other party is slow poking with paying. It's now 8:30-ish. Another round of drinks and finally at 9 we are seated and told that because of our inconvenience and patience, our server will pick 2 complimentary appetizers. I thought that was really good customer service without is even having to ask. We then move to the back of the restaurant. Now remember, I said this place is small but how surprised I was when we were lead to a quaint patio that was enclosed and dimly lit with candles. It gave it a romantic feel that made me think it is a perfect date night spot. I would never have imagined this part existed from the outside, very nice surprise. Our server comes and tells us he will pair our appetizers with the entrees we select. I thought that was pretty nice too. Between the three of us our entrees were the pan seared sea bass, crispy beef and the lobster fried rice, with that selection the server brought out lobster wontons (the star! we ordered another one) and the deviled eggs. Those were really good too with that korean beef, yum! Everything we had was delicious, everything. As I said we were here for my friends birthday, when our server found out he brought out something, I can't recall what that, was delicious but really I'm only mentioning that this was done because I read another review where someone said they did not do birthday celebrations here. We didn't ask or announce that it was her birthday, he overheard us talking and brought out the desert on his own. Another nice touch.\\n\\nI'm going back and have already made up my mind that I am going to have the fried chicken.

It's just too expensive overall for a place that isn't in the square. People here aren't reviewing with 2 stars because the food is awful, because it's not --- it's just that they think the price doesn't reflect what you get.

I picked this restaurant because my wife wanted Asian and Poor Calvin's was close to where we were.  I was tempted to go elsewhere but ended up here.  First things first, they sat us quickly at an outside table as requested, which was a nice surprise for a Friday night.  But everything else was slow as molasses.  Our waiter brought us waters and then returned a few more times to say he would be right back to take our order.  That felt like forever.   But eventually he did arrive.  He suggested a number of items and I followed his suggestion.  He raved about the Lobster Wontons, I ordered the Lobster Wontons, I sent the Lobster Wontons back to the kitchen after the first bite.  They were fried too long and therefore were very hard around the edges.  Too hard.   The flavors were odd to say the least.  The flavor of the lobster with the berry compote didn't work for me and the caviar may have made it seem elegant but just confused things more.  (Here's where things got weird for me.)  I casually called the waiter over to tell him that I didn't like the wontons and he said \\"I will get the manager for you.\\"  WHAT? NO. \\n\\n(Proper etiquette for this situation would be for the waiter to say \\"Oh, no.  Thats not good.  Don't worry about that.  Is there anything else that you might like?\\"  and then at some other point, the manager should discreetly stop by the table to say \\"I'm so sorry that you didn't like that dish, Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?  I'll take that off the bill.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do for you.\\")   That would have been the proper way to handle the situation.  No one else notices whats going on and no one is embarrassed, myself nor the establishment.   Instead, a few minutes later the waiter comes back over near my table and says loudly, THE MANAGER WILL BE RIGHT OVER TO TALK TO YOU GUYS.  again... really?  thanks dude.  So the manager eventually comes over.  Nice guy, although visibly perplexed that I didn't like the Lobster Wontons and asks me why I didn't like it.  I explained myself and my obviously incorrect tastebuds and he left me feeling as though he was personally insulted that I didn't like the dish.  I now felt bad for being honest and sending it back.  But I truly didn't like it.  Anyway...  The waiter then circles back and now HE wants to know what I didn't like about the Lobster Wontons.  Really people???  Enough already.   Lets just say, Ok no problem, and move on.  \\n\\nI also had the coconut shrimp as an appetizer which unfortunately underperformed as well but I didn't have the heart to send those back.  They were butterflied and fairly dried out.  In my opinion, coconut shrimp should big, fat, juicy and full of coconut flavor.  That wasn't these coconut shrimps.  They were flat, dry and fried in panko flakes.  \\n\\nSo we sat for a while and then a while longer until our food finally showed up.  Again, the service was slow on this particular Friday night.  At this point, I was nervous.  They weren't really doing well so far and I had honestly thought about telling the waiter to cancel the order, pay my bill and leave before we got in any deeper.  But I couldn't do that.  That would have been just plain rude.  Anyway,  I'm somewhat glad that I didn't leave yet.  The \\"Duck Dynasty\\" arrived and I gotta say, The Duck was DELICIOUS.   It was lean duck, sliced into 1-inch thick medallions and it was juicy, not chewy and had a really nice flavor.  It also came with a few fresh homemade, hand-sliced thin crispy potato chips which they would do well by adding a few more to the dish.  They were perfect.  The kale mashed potatoes were bland.  They honestly had no flavor at all.  No garlic, no salt, no spice, no flavor.  Just mashed potato texture.  They weren't bad, they were just boring.  The broccolini was ok.  A bit wilted and dead but ok. They would do better by serving these as a crispy \\"burnt\\" broccolini instead.  That might add a bit more texture to the dish and less wilt.  It was decorated by a toothpick with three stuffed olives which I just found confusing and out of place since olives would be more Mediterranean than Asian.  But this is fusion, so I guess we fuse everything.   \\n\\nMy wife ordered the pineapple, fried rice.  The presentation was cool.  They cut a pineapple in half length-wise and scoop it out.  Fill it with fried rice mixed with diced pineapple.  It was a large portion and it looked as cool but unfortunately, it too had very little flavor to it.  VERY little flavor. \\n\\nIn conclusion, This place needs more flavor.  more spice.  more something.  \\n\\nTheir slogan is \\"Absolute Fusion\\",  I think it should be Poor Calvin's Absolute CONfusion.   Because this place is absolutely confused.  Unfortunately, I wont be recommending nor returning to Calvin's.  \\n\\nPoor Calvin... I really feel bad for him.

It was my only goal on this visit to Atlanta (besides the wedding I was here to attend.)  Twelve of us in my family Ubered over from the hotel and were seated at a big round within minutes (there's no reservations but the restaurant has multiple rooms--it never seems to end). Each person fills out an order slip, including dessert and drink.  For a big group, the food came pretty fast, which was good before we could fill up on bread.  Portions are huge, diets don't count, and it's really good Southern food: I won't lie, there's a LOT of sugar involved if you need to watch it, be careful. Sweet tea has 8 cups of sugar per gallon (but oooooohhhh so good!).  The \\"bread basket\\" was cornbread, sweet milk bread (think Hawaiian) and cinnamon rolls.  Still, I recommend the banana pudding for dessert over the peach cobbler (and so did our server): it's sheet-style so more like a Southern banana pudding strata (kind of \\"tiramisu-style\\" without the mascarpone).  I had shrimp and grits because we can't get that out West, and the mac&cheese side because multiple people recommended it. My nephew's a chef at a rib joint and I do pastry--we tasted everything and commented to each other what we thought professionally. We agreed the Sweet Potato Souffl√© side had the perfect amount of nutmeg (and it was like candy); we loved it.

This is one of the most understated places I have been too, and maybe that's good, because while it was crowded, there was no long lines on a Saturday afternoon late lunch time (1:30pm).  They definitely live up to their slogan purveyors of pork (as it's not just artisanal sausage here).\\n\\nThe place has a great funky exterior with a place for public mural art, and has a very large open interior and a second floor with additional seating.  I loved the interior on the inside as it had a historic wooden feeling to it.  \\n\\nWe were quickly seated upstairs, and a server came and delivered our menus.  There was a dessert menu, drinks menu, seasonal menu, and the main menu all to review!  I have never had such a hard time trying to pick something as everything looked so good, and the menu is more diverse than I was anticipating.\\n\\nMy friend and I ended up settling on waffle fries.  She had hers chili cheese style, and I tried the current special bruschetta style.  Then we ordered different sides, I chose the Frank spinach side salad and my friend opted for the mac & cheese.  The waffle fries were hands down AWESOME!  I love waffle fries, and it's hard to find a place that gets the right balance of crispy outside and soft inside.  \\n\\nI don't like spinach salad usually, but I needed to feel a bit healthy with my waffle fries, so I got it.  YUMMY!  The salad was fresh, tasted as if they had just picked it out back, and the vinaigrette dressing was superb.  The bacon bits were the icing.\\n\\nMy friend had nothing but good things to say about her mac and cheese.\\n\\nI also tried the Kentucky Peach signature cocktail, as the cocktails going round to other tables looked fabulous.  My server highly recommended this one which was refreshing for the hot Saturday day.  Loved that it was served in a small mason jar.\\n\\nAfterwards, I finished off my meal with an espresso and shared a slice of their dark chocolate bacon chocolate with my friend.  The espresso is made with Handsome Coffee, and it was  heavenly.  When you don't need sugar or cr√®me, you know you have perfection in a cup.  It's the best espresso I have found so far in Austin since being in Switzerland.  Their aren't words to describe how yummy the chocolate bacon was.  I am definitely coming back. Their dessert menu alone looks like it needs some additional exploring. Plus, I am curious about their GF hot dog bun, and I should try the artisanal sausage as that is their staple. :)  Before we left the owner came around to chat with everyone and see how they were doing.  Really down to earth great guy.\\n\\n\\nWhat doesn't this place do? They even offer lunch delivery and take out, breakfast, and a Veggie/Gluten -Free \\"ish\\" menu section (even Gluten Free hot dog buns!!!).

Just about the most hippster-y restaurant I have ever been to. Looks like this might have changed since I went, but it was a pre-fixe menu with four categories and you could choose 3 dishes from any category. They were sorted into seafood, land meats, vegetarian, and dessert. As a vegetarian, I really didn't have a ton of options and felt that my options were not quite worth the price point. For example, one of my dishes was mostly just roasted broccoli. However, my significant other's meat options seemed high quality. We both enjoyed our food - it all seemed fresh and was well-plated by the chef.\\n\\nThe service was fine but a bit drab. The server explained our dishes very thoroughly but was kind of unenthusiastic about it. We could hear the chefs laughing and having a good time in the kitchen which was actually kind of nice to hear because it was a little awkward and quiet in there otherwise. \\n\\nAtmosphere is very cute and beautifully decorated but I don't think there was any air conditioning, or very little air conditioning, so it was very hot which definitely made our meals less enjoyable.

BF got the Rheinlander Feast (his fav). My schnizel was really good - perfectly cooked with a side order of red cabbage and mashed potatoes. I finished it all... delicious. BF obviously loved his feast because he dove in and almost ate it all.\\n\\nAfter dinner, the waitress brought out a slice of apple strudel with whipped cream (and a candle), and she, the accordian player, and another waiter sang happy birthday, and another fun German song to the BF. I thought that was a nice touch, and he loved it. \\n\\nI got to actually eat the apple strudel, because the BF LOVES their chocolate mousse. He had been raving about it for days, so he was in heaven when he got it. And I was happy with the strudel - it was so, so good. Lots of apples and the pastry was nice and flaky. Probably some of the best strudel I have ever eaten.\\n\\nOverall, it was a great experience and I'm sure we'll be back again before the end of the year.

Nobody came after 20+ minutes, and after requesting for a waiter, we had to wait for another 10 minutes until we asked again. The waiter seemed very rushed and stressed out- as if he were in a hurry to get to every table. Not one were we asked how our food was. Our water was also never refilled. We waited about 40 minutes for a bowl of clam chowder+ the crab cake sampler. Based off of reviews, the cornbread was supposed to come as a complimentary appetizer first thing- but we had to ask for it on the side! I have to say though- our stressed out waiter brought it our right away and it was amazing- probably the best cornbread I've had in my life. You cannot miss out on this! It's buttery, crunchy, and not too sweet. Everything you could want in northern cornbread. The crab cakes were satisfying as well. I wouldn't call this clam chowder the \\"best in Boston\\", but I certainly could see why people loved it so much. It was a bit creamier and a little more buttery than your average chowder. It wasn't salty, which I appreciated, but yet, it wasn't anything special either. We had to ask to get our check three times, and we noticed that the family sitting near us got their food the same time as us- they told us they'd been there since 5pm (it was 7:00!) all in all, the food was good, but the service was horrendous."},{"name":"Lenoir","address":"1807 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Super hipster, inventive and boujie restaurant.

You get 3 decent sized dumplings.  The terraine, which looked like cat food, was not tasty at all and neither one of us did more than take a bite.

I was in the area for a work conference. F2O was within walking distance from our conference venue, so my group of 7 decided to eat lunch there during our break on a Friday. I was informed by a friend that this F2O gets super busy during lunch, especially during our conference days which happens every year and hundreds of people attend. We are all released at the same time for lunch, so the majority of the attendees flock to the mall to feed. My friend suggested we place our orders online for pick-up. Thank God for her thoughtfulness and resourcefulness!\\n\\nMy group of 7 all placed a group order online. The website was fairly easy to navigate. I started the group order and added the people in the group using their email address. I was given the option of paying for all or having the group pay separately. I opted for separate checks. After adding all the email addresses, F2O then sent the members of my group an email with a link to place their individual orders. The \\"host\\" (myself), then has to submit all the orders once the entire group has placed and paid for theirs individually. F2O's menu is divided into different categories: Chef-Inspired Soups, Chef's Small Plates, Desserts & Sides, Entree Long Plates, Kids, Outside-The-Box Burgers, Panini Sandwiches, Perfect Bite SaladsÔøΩ? and Specialty Diets Menus. They also have a great selection of flavored teas. Again, easy to navigate the site and orders can be placed within minutes. After I submitted the whole group order, I was then sent a confirmation email with a pick-up time. Ours was 11:50am. \\n\\nThe restaurant opens at 11am. Immediately after our lunch release, we walked over to the mall. The restaurant had just opened, so they weren't busy yet but you could see more and more people shuffling in. We found 3 tables and pushed them together for our group, then we walked over to the pick-up counter. My order was ready first, before the pick-up time of 11:50am, but the rest of my group's orders followed shortly. Not even halfway through our meal, the restaurant was already full and the line to order was out the door.\\n\\nI ordered an Asian Salad (Mixed Baby Greens, Candied Walnuts, Tomatoes, Avocado, Sesame Seeds, Pickled Ginger, Mandarin Oranges, Szechuan Peanuts, Crispy Noodles, Dijon Vinaigrette) and added on the Almond Crusted Tuna, which was the suggested add on. I also ordered a cookie. The website didn't give me an option to choose my cookie, but when I went to the pick-up counter, the staff asked me what kind I wanted. I chose the red velvet and white chocolate cookie. My total with tax was $15.90. A bit pricey for salads, but well worth it.\\n\\nF2O's salad portions are generous. A few people from my group ordered a half salad & half soup combo and their salads were big enough to be a single serving. I ordered a full salad and I struggled to finish the entire bowl, and I have a big appetite. It was absolutely delicious and definitely fresh. So many flavors and textures that all meshed so perfectly together. The tuna was a wonderful addition. A friend of mine ordered the same salad, but with salmon and she said the salmon was a great add on as well. I am not a big salad person (meat & potatoes kinda gal), but I could eat that salad every week if I could! I was stuffed after the salad, so I held off on eating the cookie until a couple hours later. The cookie on otherhand, was probably made a day or two before. It was placed in single bags in a clear acrylic display case along with other cookies at the pick-up counter. Regardless, it too, was absolutely delicious. It was soft and chewy. I love red velvet cake and it tasted just like the cake with added bits of white chocolate goodness mixed in. YUMMY!\\n\\nEvery single person in my group raved about their salads.

The egg may have been cage free but it was also overcooked. Not poached, as most eggs are, but over hard. The spinach were odd raw strips of spinach scattered about the plate, a decidedly chalky version of vegan bacon and a hollandaise that separated and was gloopy. Gloopy is obviously a technical term. Since hollandaise is made with egg yolk and butter, I should maybe have predicted the odd flavor. \\n\\nI do appreciate what Bouldin is doing with the menu. The abundance of vegan and veg options are outstanding and this experience notwithstanding, they seem to do a decent job of putting out good food that appeases those folks with alternative eating lifestyles. \\n\\nWe do have a problem Austin wide though and that is our servers. While the service at Bouldin was pretty good, we felt like our server was just kind of putting in hours. Just relatively unenthused that we were in his section. Fine, I get it. I've been a server.

When I asked him why he did that when I clearly explained that it was for me he said, \\"well, it's her birthday\\" and walked away leaving us to figure out the confusion. \\n\\nI was so shocked that he actually thought that was okay when I specifically stated the cake was for me. He put everyone in a very uncomfortable position. I had to watch someone else blow out a candle on my cake and then later ask them to pass the cake back down to me.

Ordering\\nTrevor and I split the Plancha burger ($9) - American cheese, special sauce, pickles, challah. \\n\\nWayne and Sumana split the Plancha burger as well. \\n\\nII. The burgers\\nThe meat was cooked to a perfect medium rare, tasted very meaty, and was nicely seasoned. The challah bun was weird. It was a little crunchy, which made it difficult to cut (in order to split the burgers). It didn't really complement the patty. It was also too big for the patty. Since the bun was tough, when we ate, it squished the patty out the other side! The cheese was really nice, melty, and flavorful. Their \\"special sauce\\" was tangy and oh so delicious.They give you pickles on the side you add yourself.  The pickles were cut really thin, which made it easy to layer a bunch on the burger. They were bursting with flavor; sour and a little sweet. I'm glad they were not stingy with the pickles (I'm looking at you Second Bar + Kitchen). This burger was nicely balanced. \\n\\nIII. The Fries/Sides\\nN/A. We just came from a meat feast at la barbecue so no stomach real estate for sides.\\n\\nIV. Miscellaneous\\nThis restaurant is located in a residential area. It is super cute, and has a nice bright space. They have their own parking lot. There is indoor and outdoor seating. The service was very friendly and attentive. The infamous birthday cake ice cream sandwich is only served at dinner so plan accordingly if you really want that. Really all the dishes that came out of the kitchen looked amazing. I'm sure everything there is good. The only negative was that as I was leaving I noticed dead flies all over the floor and window sill (I'm talking like at least 6 that I saw as I was walking out). Gross. \\n\\nV. Value\\nWe have a new way to measure value. I ask the members how much they would pay for the burger they ate. We would pay anywhere between $10 and $12 for this burger. So this burger is a great value since it's priced at $9! \\n\\nVI. The verdict\\nThis burger was truly delicious, and it could be better with a better bun.

Aghhh, why didn't I listen to the buzz about King + Duke sooner?! \\n\\nI went with a friend for an after work drink &  mid-week (aka humpday) mischief. We sat at the relatively empty, quiet bar as we wrapped up loose business ends & perused the menu. It did not stay empty & quiet for long! It soon got very lively with throngs of people coming in for drinks and dinner. Glad we got there early to snag good seats! \\n\\nI'm not sure which Fry restaurant came first, this or St. Cecilia, but they seem to share the same designer. The layout is very similar, only King + Duke is darker & more masculine. It's upscale & earthy chic with a nod to literary greats. Famous quotes decorate the walls & appear throughout the massive leather-bound drink menu. Love that! \\n\\nSpeaking of the impressive drink menu, you'll find just about anything you're looking for, as uncommon or hard to find as it may be elsewhere. \\n\\nBut what really stood out to me? The service & the food. Yassss!! \\n\\nThe bartenders were all equally courteous, engaging, knowledgable & helpful. And I love, love, love their team approach - any & all of them help you, unlike many other establishments where you have an 'assigned' bartender & are largely ignored by anyone else behind the bar. Not here. No ma'am Pam. Everyone pitches in to make sure you have what you need & you're not waiting to flag someone down for a refill. They're extremely attentive, well trained and have a knack for anticipating your needs. They're passionate about their craft and their customers. And it shows. \\n\\nWhen it comes to the food...it absolutely seduced us! This place made me like something I thought I hated - beef tartare ($9)! I've had beef tartare elsewhere & could've sworn it was the Alpo dog food I used to feed my boxer! Uuck! \\nEnter K+D. I don't know if it's in the prep or the quality of the meat, but the Wagyu beef they use surely doesn't hurt! It's simply prepared with shallots, capers & Dijon, served on top of crispy toast. The flavor is so mild & the beef texture is unthinkably buttery soft. Sheer perfection. \\n\\nAfter we destroyed our share of raw red meat, we opted to go less meat-centric & vied for veggies. The bartenders highly recommended the crispy brussels sprouts ($8) & my friend obliged. Wha?! Again, something I wasn't excited to order, but whatever. Can you tell I wasn't driving this train & was preoccupied with a work task? Lol! I'm usually in charge so here's what happens when I give up the reigns. In this instance, no complaints, I was pleasantly surprised! \\n\\nUntil now, Brussels sprouts had only been mildly tolerable (thanks to that funny smell - oh yeah, the smell of farts!). Fear no sulphuric smell at King + Duke! They've elevated the cruciferous vegetable to an almost decadent and sophisticated dish with chiles, soy, mint-Thai & basil. Packed full of flavor, and equally soft & crispy - they pack a punch of flavor & they only smell of the deliciousness they ooze! They're almost reminiscent of a Chinese dish. These were such a hit, my friend insisted getting a second order. Nope, he didn't want to try other things. Give him more Brussels sprouts! You better believe we'd duke it out over those last bites! \\n\\nWe also ordered the Cauliflower 'Cacio e Pepe' ($9), with peppercorn dressing & grana padano. Perfectly roasted & browned, the cauliflower maintained its firm, crispy texture & was perfectly complemented by the dressing & shaving of cheese. \\n\\nI wanted to order 'The Duke', aka the house burger. It sounds sooooo delicious & I bet it absolutely is. Unfortunately, we were satisfied after our schizo smorgasbord, lol! We will have to return and try The Duke! \\n\\nMuch to my chagrin, this place flew under the radar in my book because I didn't find the menu too appealing (even though it changes seasonally). But, I'm woman enough to admit my mistakes & I have to say, my bad! This place really surpassed our expectations. We're so glad we gave it a shot. They've made believers out of us! \\n\\nThe only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I'd like to see a few more options maybe in a side dishes area - sides that could double as 'bar menu food.' Something like fries (even if they're fancy duck fat fries!), sliders, etc... \\n\\nRegardless, I'll be back with the menu as is & I'm sure I'll find something I'll like. And you should be here too!

The flavor is amazing and goes well with the dipping sauce. The congee, equally as good, had great texture and flavor.  I liked that they put a raw egg in the base and as you stirred the congee, it cooked perfectly. They also have some house made chili that gives it the extra kick if you like it with heat.

We went to Pizzeria Locale based on the recommendations of a friend, who swore that this restaurant was the closest thing to authentic Italian pizza in Colorado. We were sorely disappointed. \\n\\nWe went for dinner on a Saturday night. We knew it would be busy, so we made reservations. The music was so loud (and crappy! they played outdated clubbing music...) that we couldn't have a conversation, and though the place was overrun with wait staff, it took ~10 minutes before anyone gave us menus, water, or any sort of acknowledgement at all.\\n\\nWe ordered three pizzas to split between four people - the Margherita, Funghi, and Maiale. All three pizzas came out very quickly, which was nice. However, they were soggy in the middle, and the crusts were severely burnt. The Funghi was so burnt that the burnt-dough taste of the crust overpowered any other taste of the pizza - we ended up having to pick off just the toppings for ~80% of this pizza. The Margherita and Maiale were a little better (only about half of each crust was severely burned).\\n\\n*We know that these were brick-oven pizzas, and that there is always going to be a bit of charring that occurs in such baking environments. This was not our complaint - our problem was that SO much of the crusts of all three pizzas were SO burnt that they was not edible!!*\\n\\nEven with all the wait staff who passed by our table watching us pick off all the burnt parts (or, more accurately, pick off the toppings and discard giant chunks of crust), no one stopped by to ask about the pizza, the service, whether we needed more water, etc. After finishing all we could and asking for the check (we were not looking for a freebie), we asked for a manager and politely explained to our waiter that, though we understood that the establishment served brick oven pizza, we thought that maybe the oven was too hot because so much of our pizzas came out so terribly burnt. When the manager came over, she offered no apology - instead she just said that the oven was supposed to be that hot, and that she already took a pizza off our bill. She was extremely rude, and it almost seemed like she thought we were complaining just to get a discount - to set the record straight, we purposely asked for the check prior to asking for the manager. \\n\\nThough the staff was not the most attentive and the pizza was not the greatest, both of these problems could have been alleviated by our interaction with the manager - instead, she made it so that we will never be returning.

Mr. K goes to Stumptown or Floyd's to order our coffees and commandeer some seats and I take the boys to Voodoo for a taste of their famous doughnuts.\\n\\nMy personal fave is the Voodoo Donut with the prezel impaling the chocolate and cream heart with jelly oozing out. You've got to try their signature Maple Bacon bar. My boys like the classic cake doughnuts with frosting and sprinkles, but their all time favorite is the one with pink frosting and bubblegum on top. You just don't see that at Tonalli's, Annie's or the handful of other shops in town. When the \\"little ears\\" aren't around I'll order the cock-n-balls or big-ass doughnut.\\n\\nWe try to go when we have the place to ourselves so we can take our time, ooh and ahh at all the sugary goodness in the display case, and the staff is a little less cantankerous than usual.

In my opinion, this is the perfect example of how much garlic should be used for a perfect Caesar's dressing! And, at the same time, perhaps a warning for the faint of heart... It also comes with white anchovies (though my preference is dark) and half a boiled egg which combines just so perfectly. \\n\\nThe polenta is very creamy and enjoyable done with crispy onion and truffle oil.\\n\\nOf note, the apple pumpkin bisque could use more of vegetable stock base and sweetness. \\n\\nCocktails and beers on tap were equally great."},{"name":"XLB","address":"4090 N Williams Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Today was one of 7 national dumpling days this year (haha) and XLB was highlighted by the Travel Portland Insta.

We wanted to dine al fresco and didn't mind waiting for a table out of the four to open (I guessed wrong as to which one would go first).  Not long after we sat down, I second-guessed that decision: SMOKER NEIGHBORS!  Actually, it was such a beautiful evening out (a tad humid), that I think we would have made the same choice the next time.  A gentleman walking by saw me taking a picture of my wife and offered to take one of the both of us - classy and considerate.  Thank you, sir, if you're reading this.\\n\\nAfter perusing the wine list to drive our dinner decision (what's available, what either looks familiar or interesting, what's a better value...) we settled on the ever-present \\"red or white\\" decision.  Quickly had to reverse course when told that the special was a sea bass!  We seldom say no to this delectable dish unless the price is outrageous.  The waitress didn't offer a price, but hey, it's our anniversary (turned out to be $20).  We chose the frutti di mare as the other entree, and paid the $2.25 each to change to the antipasto and caesar's salad, sharing both of them.  The antipasto, in spite of the foundation of the pariah of produce - iceberg - turned out to be very good.  Of the two entrees, the frutti di mare, while fresh, was the lesser, not having much of a memorable delectable taste.  The sea bass, on the other hand, was sublime, with the slight bitter of burnt bits setting off the oily rich flavor, and perfect companion to the Santa Margheritta Pinot Grigio.  The capellini that was cast in a supporting role was good too, if a little heavy in that creamy sauce.  No question in my mind that the linguine from the other dish, or even a fettucine, would have been a more appropriate pasta for such a thick sauce, and the capellini more apropos for the watery liquid sitting at the bottom of the frutti di mare.\\n\\nOur bubbly waitress Dawn was friendly, but a trifle slow.  She was reasonably attentive (did not replace our knives soiled from the first 2 courses, though), but would disappear for lengthy periods (my motto as a dining guest is that one shouldn't have to pour his own wine/water more than occasionally).  We were unsure as to whether something like 3 or 4 wait staff oversaw the 4 sidewalk tables, and also had tables inside.  If that's the system, it doesn't make sense.  \\n\\nAll in all, pretty good food for a reasonable price.

However, my friends and I were sorely disappointed. We came here on probably their busiest night on a Friday, so we expected some delays and frazzled service, however things were a bit worse than we anticipated. I don't like places that don't seat you unless your whole party is present, even if half are already there - so the initial wait time for the rest of our party to arrive put a damper on our experience - but I understand why they have this policy. Once we were sat, everything started out nicely, the server was friendly, and got us waters promptly. However, the service progressively became severely lacking. The water set on the table was never refilled, and was even taken away without replacement. While our appetizers came out quickly, our main courses were a different story. Before I get to that, I have to describe the drink and appetizers though.\\n\\nDrink:\\n\\n1.) Up In Smoke - Took me awhile to finish this drink but with good reason. It was smoky, gingery, bourbon goodness.\\n\\nAppetizers:\\n\\n1.) Tuna Tartare - This wasn't what I was expecting. It was more seaweed salad than tuna, and wasn't as soft as I have had at other places. The crispy rice noodles while in theory a good idea, didn't have the crunch desired with this type of dish. Overall the flavoring was just ok. Not worth the price.\\n2.) Shaved Calamari - I have to admit this was amazing. While the calamari wasn't the best I've ever had, it was still very good, the crisp on it, the texture of the calamari itself was all tasty and very good.\\n3.) Salmon Chips - For a signature appetizer, I was a little underwhelmed. I've had similar dishes at other spots around town, so it seems this is a popular thing these days, and I have to say that Urban Licks does it decently. However it felt that there was entirely too much cream cheese, when you expect the focal point to be the salmon.\\n4.) Bread - This didn't come out until after our appetizers, but I assume it's complimentary, and it was amazing. The bread was warm and fluffy and the butter had a nice flavor that complimented the bread perfectly.\\n\\nAs for the entree's, I personally had the Bronzed Scallops which I can't lie were perfectly cooked and tasted great together with the Gouda Grits and Smoked Tomato Broth. Possibly the best dish I had. However, this is where our experience turned sideways. I get cooking things at different times especially in an expensive restaurant like this where quality of food should be meet the pricing, and I would expect everyone to get dishes at slightly different times, but what we experienced was out of proportions. While we waited over an hour for the first of our dishes, by the time I finished my entree, two of my friends (who ordered the brisket), had still not even received theirs. This was just unacceptable, and we asked the waiters multiple times but the food never arrived until we were basically ready to leave. My friends didn't even get to eat most of their dish and had to get a box to take it home.\\n\\nNow, for the price, I would say the food is alright, but should be way better. However I wouldn't mind spending as much as I did if the service was way more out together and the ambience a little better.\\n\\nThe cream on top of this experience was first that the live band was entirely too loud and we were practically having to yell at each other to talk, even to the waiters. Second, the room we were in behind the band had 0 A/C. I felt like I had just taken a shower by the time I left since I was sweating so much.

Very simple menu with about 7 pizzas, a few appetizers, and some small plates.  Food comes out quick and EXTREMELY hot.  Burned my mouth on both the ricotta and the pizza, so customer beware.  It is all made in the sam oven and served as it comes out so yes it's fresh, but dangerous.  As far as taste, the ricotta was exceptional.  Had an eggy consistency and was a full scoopable dish with mushroom and tomatoes as well.  Definitely deserves more focaccia for delivery, but eatable with a spoon nonetheless.  Bread very good as well and deserves an order.  Pepperoni pizza had a great char to the crust and smoky flavor to the pie as a whole that delivered with each bite.  Ordered a farm egg on top and it just oozed and added another layer of saltiness to the dish.  Tough to eat the middle piece, but well worth reverting to a fork and knife meal for that part.  Pepperoni were quality cuts and a recommended choice.  Pizzas pretty small, so 1 per person or 1 shared with an appetizer or two would be optimal.  Wines expensive at $12 for average poors, but good and not your average so get to try some new blends.  Spot is tough to find and in a not so nice-looking part of town, but safe and cozy if you can find a seat at the bar or make a reservation.  Cool spot off of sixth if you're in town for vacation/event or looking for something fancier and higher-quality that is also nearby the hectic downtown bar area."},{"name":"Mad Mac's Gourmet Sandwich Shop","address":"1105 Main St, Ste 101","city":"Forest Park","stars":"4.5","text":"I would say their sandwiches are really great but they are a little bit expensive compared to others..

I did wish that the egg was poached instead of fried. Finally, the carbonara was my least favourite because the pasta tasted flour-y and unlike the usual creamy carbonara I was used to.\\n\\nService was average; the server didn't seem very friendly but always did as we asked.

I don't know if I have ever had better cooked shrimp.  The fries were millimeters thick and super-crispy (like freshly made French's potato sticks). Octopus dish was way too small and flavorless (I know how much a whole cephalopod costs and this was a rip-off).  The lobster roll was okay. It is hard to impress a true New Englander with a lobster roll. I would recommend that they add a little bit of tail meat and adjust the price, as Maine lobster prices are at a near all-time low.\\n\\nThey also had oysters for sale at $3.0-6.5 PER OYSTER!  Having lived in NC where one can purchase an entire peck of oysters for $10.5, this did not compute for us.

Maybe this restaurant or this night is for younger folks as we are all north of 60 years old, still young in the mind though. The menu is the menu, a bit too spicy or hot with the ingredients but that is a matter of personal preference, not the fault of the restaurant. French Toast should be pretty easy but it was 2 slices of thick cardboard. Actually hard. You would think the egg would have softened the bread.

Sadly, it was truly one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. We were seated at our reserved table and waited for several minutes. A waiter came by and said he would bring waters. 10 minutes went by, and still no water. I then asked the host if we could get some water as we were parched from sitting in a graduation ceremony. My mom then caught eyes with the waiter, and really nicely said that we were ready to order (we still didn't have any waters). The waiter then snapped and said \\"Would you give me a minute?!\\" In an EXTREMELY RUDE WAY. Mind you, we had been sitting for 15 minutes with still no waters. Our table was completely shocked, and I was really embarrassed as my family traveled across the country to spend this time with me, and I took them to a place that did not give us water and had the RUDEST waiter I have EVER encountered? Fortunately, another waiter took our orders. But our orders were incorrect when we got the food... they brought out a salad when my boyfriend ordered an egg salad sandwich, my mom was not given a latte nor was my boyfriend given a latte that they had ordered. They brought out a salad no one had ordered, they forgot the cheese plate we had ordered (we were really looking forward to it before our meal), and there were no dressings on the 2 salads that we did order. Due to this, an entirely separate waitress gave us half off our meal and we not charged for the latte. Honestly, this just really impacted my special celebration day, and I really, really regret making this reservation at Blue Dahlia 2 months in advance. I really wish I would have had my celebratory meal at a place where waiters did not talk so rudely to my poor mother, food wasn't forgotten, and drinks and food were given to us correctly. Even though we were given half off the meal, that truly does not make up for the horrendous experience I had here today.

If you thought shelling out $14 for fried chicken with no sides was a little strange considering we live in the deep south where meat and three plate joints are plentiful, good, and cheap (e.g. Our Way Cafe), wait 'til you see Barbarossa's take on a German Biergarten.  \\n\\nWinning a cooking reality show sure seems to have  a way of inflating prices well beyond those of your immediate market, which in most economic models is a recipe for disaster.  Communion, the little microcosm that it is, seems to revel in it's detachment from reality, and even institutes its own currency: the Communion Token.  With a currency rate ($1 CT=$5 USD) that should be pretty lousy for exports, the charismatic leader of this land rules with an iron fist and a red beard, and thus will not budge on his monetary policy.  \\n\\nCommunion's most insulting assumption is that it can freely charge $10/pint (to be fair, it includes gratuity. . .about 80% gratuity) for low gravity lagers you can find just about everywhere that sells craft beer.  Had Mr. Gillespie chosen to open shop in the middle of the Sahara Desert, this pricing scheme may have been considered fair, maybe even charitable.  Instead, Communion is situated in an area that sports numerous pubs including the nationally recognized Brickstore Pub, multiple award winning craft cocktail bars, three breweries, and a brewpub (soon to be two).  Unfortunately for all these places, they didn't win a reality show, and  must price their libations on an earthling scale in attempt to actually win customers from their competitors.  \\n\\nI'm sure the food is fine albeit grossly overpriced, but in my opinion, a biergarten should strive to make its namesake the focal point of its business without insulting our understanding of liquid measurements and profit margins. \\n\\nWith all of this said, a liter (~33oz) is $15, which although not terrible, is still $7.50/pint for lager.  If you're looking for a great Biergarten, try the one downtown on Marietta St.  Liters for $9-11 and pretty good German food with none of the pretentiousness.  \\n\\nAuf Wiedersehen!"},{"name":"Mexas Tacos","address":"8788 Vineland Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Now I see why this place gets 5 stars\\nAmazing authentic food, Great service\\n\\nFYI it's in the shell gas station"},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"A-ma-zing is the only word I can use to describe Poor Calvin's.

You also get 2 sides with the entrees, so between me and my friends, we tried a bunch:\\n- Whipped potatoes and gravy: great compliment to the fried chicken, nothing too special though\\n- Mac and cheese: WAY too cheesy for my liking but other people seem to like it. It was more than half cheese that had a strange consistency.\\n- Tomato pie: actually my favorite side! It was kind of like tomato stew with a yummy crumb topping.\\n- Collard greens: nicely cooked and also complimented the chicken well\\n- Sweet potato souffle: also way too sweet for my liking, there must be a ton of brown sugar in there. \\n\\nI don't think the food will blow your mind or anything but it's definitely a fun experience to try it!

I'm not sure if the training wasn't thorough enough or if the ladies were simply inexperienced but they are not able to handle the volume right now. Parties were being seated without menus. There was confusion on what party was who because of the handwritten list and double listing (bad communication between service assistants). Tables (and servers) were being double sat. \\nI hosted at a high volume restaurant for over a year and you can bet if there were empty tables, they were being sat. During my 15 wait I saw at least 5 empty tables, some needed to be cleared and some were clean, that sat untouched. I know this is opening week, but that's kinda restaurants 101. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is great. The music is a blend of early 70s and late 60s. Hardwood floors with brick walls give it a quaint feeling while the high ceilings remind you there's plenty of space. I have not yet explored the 2 bars, as they are not open for late night service yet. I believe one will be live music venue. \\n\\nThe servers seem scattered. The dining room is not very large, so visibility seems easy to achieve but we had trouble finding ours. I saw a server seat her own table ahead of other parties. Management looked on. \\nI served at the same high volume restaurant for more than a year. My manager would have sent me home and written me up for that. \\nThe service sections were poorly designed. They did not set up the servers for success. \\n\\nKitchen times were very very long. They're still trying to figure out the pace, though I know my community and my guess would be that many ordered simple bbq meal+side+sauce combos, especially since this is the first visit. There is no reason for those kinds of dishes to take more than 10-15 minutes. Even at this volume. \\n\\nWe ordered the Smokey buffalo chicken dip. The runner who brought it: \\"did yall order an appetizer?\\" (I thought this was rhetorical, she repeats the question) \\"ok what was it?\\".... \\nI hope the Styrofoam plates/plastic ware/disposable serving dishes are because it is opening week and they're dish shipment hasn't come in for some unforseen reason because that is so tacky and so bad for the environment. Again, restauranting 101.\\nThe dip was spicy and the blue cheese crumbles were a good touch. Overall it tasted like it may have been a premade/frozen deal, though the size of chicken piece was really inconsistent so maybe not.. The dip is served with corn chips (definitely not housemade). Ours were stale (they've been open since 5pm, and we received our appetizer around 6:20pm)\\n\\nI believe there are one to two tables in the restaurant that have received food. Several parties have been waiting more than an hour just on entrees.\\n\\nI got the Georgia burger with coca cola bbq sauce, grilled peaches and a bacon marmalade. I never found the marmalade. The burger was over done (I ordered medium) and it was cold. The peaches were not grilled. It comes with tomato (large portion) and shredded lettuce (which is always a mistake in my opinion). I am disappointed with this dish because it sounds really good and it was executed so badly. I did enjoy the brussel sprouts in Smokey vinaigrette, which is saying something about brussel sprouts. \\n\\nWe also had pulled chicken and pulled pork. Both are exceptional. The potato salad side was bland and the fries came from the freezer. When you have craft in your name I expect you to craft the majority of your menu. \\n\\nWe waiting on a To go order for over 30 minutes. A manager tried to reassure us she comped everything (she didnt); I'd have rather her gotten the food instead. \\n\\nThere were several children running about the restaurant. Running into servers, talking to and trying to touch other tables/guests. This is first and foremost a parenting issue but as a manager it it your responsibility to handle that situation. \\n\\nOverall, this was a really poor first impression as far as the operations/experience side. The bbq meat was excellent, but if you can't run a restaurant I don't see being very successful. I currently manage a store front and catering restaurant. At the crafty hog, there is a ton of undue stress on the staff and patrons because of the disorganization in management."},{"name":"JINYA Ramen Bar","address":"5975 Roswell Rd, Ste B-217","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"The three stars is strictly because of the greeter/seater.

When I got to the place near Faneuil Hall, I made sure I peeked in to see how \\"legit\\" this place is. I ultimately decide to try it and when I saw a wall with famous name plates, I was put at ease. Even if the title of \\"American's Oldest\\" could be debatable, at least I can be assured that the food should be solid. There is a bit of a wait, even for one, but I was determined to try it. When I finally got a spot on the second floor right by the stairs, I was amazed at how historical the place looked. I think they preserved most of the infrastructure of the restaurant over the years as much as possible. They even had their old menus by the wall. I ordered a cup of clam chowder as I was recommended by the waitress as a must-try and the pan-seared haddock. The chowder was really good and the best I had in Boston during my time there. The consistency was just right; not too watery and not too thick. There's enough clams and potato in there to make it satisfying and hearty. I could eat a bowl of that alone. The haddock, on the other hand, was okay. The batter was a bit thick and not enough meat. I'm not crazy about boiled potatoes and the vegetable was meh.

It was here since the 1940's. \\n\\nThe place is huge inside! It doesn't look like it from the outside, but they have a ton of room in there. \\n\\nThe wait is crazy. But since the restaurant is so big, the wait wasn't too bad. \\n\\nMary Mac's serves traditional Southern food. They don't try to do anything fancy. It's like the stuff your mom or grandma used to make. \\n\\nThey have a huge menu. Not only are their restaurant and menu huge, their portions are gigantic as well. They aren't afraid of stuffing you full. You will probably have leftovers if you come here. \\n\\nIf you want to try a variety of what they have, I suggest getting their \\"Southern Special.\\" You can pick 3 entrees, 3 sides, and a dessert. They say it's for parties 2 and up. But I think you need 3-4 people at a minimum. It's AYCE. So you can ask for any of the 3 entree or sides over and over again. But I dunno. They brought out so much food, I don't know if you can ask for another plate of fried chicken. \\n\\nSpeaking of Fried Chicken, they have a pretty good one here. The skin is crispy and the meat is juicy. \\n\\nTheir meatloaf was too dense for me. I wished it was fluffier. But it was a brick. \\n\\nTheir chicken and dumplings were good. I liked the gravy on it.\\n\\nTheir green beans were cooked with pork. So it was a porky green bean. I liked it. Too bad if you're vegetarian though. \\n\\nTheir turnip greens were done well. It was pretty traditional. \\n\\nTheir Sweet Potato Souffl√© was super sweet and very nutmeg-y. I think they overdid it on the nutmeg. But it was still good.\\n\\nThey were nice enough to bring a sample of Pot Likker to us. It was basically broth of collard greens. It was nice and comforting. It came with corn bread with cracklings. It was pretty crack-like because of the bacon inside. \\n\\nTheir bread basket was filled with corn bread, wheat bread, and cinnamon rolls. Their cinnamon roll were great. \\n\\nTheir banana pudding was more like bread pudding. But I still liked it. Their peach cobbler was a traditional, good old fashioned peach cobbler. \\n\\nThis is not healthy food people. It has a ton of cream, oils, fat, sugar, salt, etc on it.  That's why most of the food tastes so good. Not only that, they give you a huge portion of everything.\\n\\nThe service was a bit slow but very friendly and charming. I liked my server. \\n\\nIf you're in Atlanta and haven't been to Mary Mac's. I think you should go ASAP."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This was the place my family and I had dreamed of visiting for quite a few years.\\nWe decided to go on a Sunday, after Resurrection Services. So you know that we set ourselves up for a long wait because the restaurant was packed crowded with people!\\nWhat surprised me about Mary Mac's is that it is a whole lot bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside!\\nAfter waiting about 30-45 minutes, we were finally seated.\\nThe atmosphere of Mary Mac's reminded me a lot of grandma's house. It really has an old homestyle feel, and with all of the people there, it made the atmosphere feel like one big family reunion.\\nAll of the staff were very friendly, and our waiter went above and beyond to fill us in on the history of the restaurant, the hundreds of celebrities that have eaten there, and how to place our order. You see, you don't tell the server what you want, and they write it down. The server gives you an order form, and YOU write down what you want!\\nOur family of four ordered pan fried steak, fried chicken, fried porkchops, and chicken tenders as our entre√©s (I know, that's a lot of fried food:). Our sides included mashed potatoes, fried green tomatoes, macaroni and cheese, collard greens, french fries, spiced apples, and applesauce. Our desserts were a brownie topped with icecream and chocolate sauce, Georgia peach cobbler, and a banana pudding. We also received complimentary rolls, muffins, and small cinnamon rolls.\\nNow the reason I gave this restaurant 4 stars instead of 5 was that although the food was delicious, I was not \\"wowed\\". In my opinion, there was nothing overly special about the taste of the food. I'm from the south, and I can find food at just about any church potluck that would taste the exact same way.\\nMy only complaint about the taste of my food was that the collard greens were a little salty, but they were still good.\\nOverall, I'm glad that I was able to finally experience Mary Mac's Tea Room, and to finally see for myself what the hype was all about. \\nWould I return to Mary Mac's Tea Room? Probably not in the near future.

I could dump half of them onto another crust and make a 2nd pizza.  I'm not saying it's bad....but it's not my thing.

I've been wanting to try this place out and I'm glad I did! I walked in today, on a Tuesday afternoon around 2pm and it wasn't busy. They have menus you can look at while you wait in line and there's a large screen behind the register with the menu options. I spotted the truffle, mushroom and swiss burger instantly and that was that. You can order a 1/3 lb. or 1/2 lb. burger. I ordered the latter with a side of \\"smash fries\\" which are seasoned with olive oil and rosemary. (You can order your fry portion either regular or large. Guess which one I chose?)\\n\\nI ordered my meal to go and it was ready within 5 minutes. (Not bad). While I was waiting I took notice of the kitchen and eating area and everything was clean and organized. They seemed well staffed and everyone working appeared super friendly. \\n\\nWhen I got my goodies and went into the car, the glorious smell wafting from the bag was too much for me to handle. I couldn't resit so I opened it up and impatiently put a golden fry in my mouth. 'Then the heavens opened up and a chorus of angels began to sing.' (Yes, I take my food this seriously). I love french fries. They are my weakness, guilty pleasure, comfort food, whatever-you-want-to-call-it. I love them of all shapes, seasonings and sizes; I do not judge. But the one thing they must be: CRUNCHY. Too many times have I been served a depressing, soggy plate of fries. Too many times have I been disappointed with mealy and mushy potatoes. But not this day. On this day I experienced the epitome of what a french fry should be: soft and hot on the inside with a crunchy, crispy outer shell that is basked in the most delicious and wonderful flavor combinations to ever christen your palate. Yes, these fries are THAT GOOD. Of course, I finished all the fries while I was driving, eating them one by one and savoring every bite. (My apologies if you had to witness this).\\n\\nThey packaged my burger in a plastic container which was a very nice change as opposed to paper like most places do. Needless to say there were no leaks or precious juices wasted. I took off the bottom of the bun because in-between the meat and the top bun is where the magic is. I had a hard time finishing it even with this alteration but it was so. damn. delicious. It was juicy, succulent and the cheese was melted to total perfection.

The portions are huge for meals that cost 8-10 dollars. I ordered the salty and spicy squid and I paid 10 dollars including a reasonable tip.

Our server was nice but could have been more attentive. The place inside is bigger than it looks from the outside. It's very loud inside, even though there weren't many people dining in. The kitchen and bar noise reverberates through the room and the music is cranking. Our table was sticky and the floors and counters looked grimy.\\n\\nFirst we tried the Arepa de Chocolo ($4.29). I always love a good arepa. This was put down in front of us and was shiny with grease. It tasted very greasy too. The server put it down knowing the four of us were going to share but we never received plates... not a huge deal. The food came out quickly following. My daughters kids grilled chicken ($7.29) was overcooked and dry. She only ate a little of it, I don't blame her! My Camarones al Ajillo ($11.59) was also very greasy. The flavor was good but it just just too oily. The maduros were good though and somehow missed the grease bath. I thought it strange when the server asked what dressing I wanted for my salad she brought me straight olive oil with vinegar (after I asked if it was a balsamic vinegar dressing and she said yes). I was oiled out by then so just ate it with the green sauce that came with my meal. Hubby said his Pollo Encebollado ($9.99) had a good flavor but, surprise, was too greasy. His meal was the best value as I thought mine was pricey for what I got. The dried chicken kids meal was overpriced too. My son had the cuban and it looked perhaps the best of all our meals.

Here's what I've had in my two trips:\\n\\nBrussel Sprouts - OK, not something you'd think about ordering but they are good mostly because they're in a nice batter but there's this aroma of truffle oil on it to make the experience feel so decadent.\\n\\nCaramelized Cauliflower - Pass on this. Great for vegetarians, but forgettable.\\n\\nTakoyaki - Lots of sauce and flavor, probably the best takoyaki in town. My only gripe is that there's so little octopus in each ball that it tends to fall off the toothpick because it's all potato and filler.\\n\\nCha Cha Cha Ramen - One of the best bowls at Jinya. So much flavor, lots of garlic and the thick noodles are where it's at.\\n\\nPremium White Tonkatsu Ramen - My fiance thought this should be the baseline, but it really was underwhelming on our first trip for many reasons: 1) He only got half an egg when I got a whole egg on the Cha Cha Cha, 2) The thin noodles were disappointing, and 3) The broth seemed plain. Tonkatsu shouldn't be plain and lack that body that most broths should have.\\n\\nBlack Tonkatsu Ramen - It comes with thin noodles but I requested thick noodles which I realize is now my preference with any ramen. Black has more flavor than the White Tonkatsu. \\n\\nService-wise, I can see that they're getting better. Wait times are still inaccurate ie, my first trip i was told 20 min but actually was 45min, my last trip i was told 30 min but it was actually 15. Also, on my last trip, the ramen came out before our apps/tapas.

Eisenhower Bagelhouse has quickly become my go to Sunday breakfast location. They have lots of options so I haven't even tried half the menu yet, but haven't been disappointed so far. They also have a board that lists their bagel special of the day.

It's very difficult to not chow down on the bread because it's soooo delicious. You'll have to control yourself  we also ordered appetizers of calamari and salmon chips.

The crust is a medium thickness that has just a bit of chew to it with a nicely balanced sauce.  No particular herb crowds out the other flavors here.  Cheese was generous and a proper ratio to the crust and other toppings.   Over a three day period, I tried the lingui√ßa, meat lover and alfredo (a variation on white pizza) and found all perfectly delicious.  Care has been taken to select high quality toppings so each contributes a distinctive flavor to the pie. The lingui√ßa was concentrated and slightly salty (which worked well because the rest of the pizza itself was not); the bacon / pepperoni  / ground meat each added a subtle but distinctive flavor to the meat lover;  and  the alfredo was creamy and satisfying.   This is food done right.  Service was fast and precise -I ordered a pizza for pickup at 9:15 PM and it was coming out of the oven at exactly 9:14 PM.  The restaurant is small, neat and clean.

We did exactly as we were told, only to be told by the hostess that the person who had answered the restaurant's phone did not know what he was doing and that we would have to wait over two hours from when the entire group arrived.

I originally found out about Mary Mac's on Wikipedia, of all places (see Atlanta attractions).  Given that I enjoy trying the local cuisine when I'm traveling, I knew I had to try it, and it certainly didn't disappoint!\\n\\nWanting to try a quintessentially Georgia meal, I ordered the fried chicken (drumsticks) with mac and cheese and collard greens, with sweet tea as my beverage.  Before I'd even ordered, however, my waiter brought out a wonderful bread basket containing cornbread, yeast rolls, and cinnamon rolls.  In order to save room for dinner, I saved the cinnamon rolls for the next day, and ate the cornbread and yeast rolls.  I wasn't particularly impressed by the cornbread (kind of flavorless), but the yeast rolls were great.  The sweet tea was cold, refreshing, and very sweet, and made a perfect accompaniment to the meal.  When the meal itself came out, it had 4, rather than the specified 3, drumsticks.  I bit into one and it was fried chicken bliss.  The coating was light but crispy, and the chicken itself was moist and tender--perfect!  I devoured all 4 drumsticks, silently thanking the kitchen for their generosity.  The collards were savory and tender, serving as a healthier foil for the rest of the meal, and came with another piece of cornbread (the only thing I left on my plate, since I was stuffed and wasn't impressed by the cornbread in the basket).  The mac and cheese was made in the southern style with eggs, and was light and fluffy.  Although I wouldn't have guessed it, since I'm a traditionalist when it comes to mac and cheese, I very much enjoyed its light yet cheesy flavor (score: 7.5/10).  Last but not least, the peach cobbler was gooey and sweet, and made a perfect ending to the meal.  My one criticism is that it would have been nice if the cobbler part was a bit crisper to provide some textural contrast--as it were, it was gooey, like the peach filling.\\n\\nOne caveat: If you come here on a Sat. evening during prime time, as I did, be prepared to wait.  I believe I ended up waiting for about 45 min.  There's a lot of seating, and the hostesses did their best to try to get me seated, but people tend to linger.  The food is well worth waiting for, however.  Thank you, Mary Mac's, for a memorable Atlanta dinner on my last day in town! 4.5 stars.\\n\\nP.S.

I sat outdoors on a lovely spring evening. The back patio overlooks a park/ running path. \\n\\nSadly my pleasant experience ended there. Two Urban Licks was truly one of the more awful dining adventures that I've ever had. I sat for about 15 minutes before a bus boy asked if I was being helped to which I responded no. He then went to, presumably, find a waiter. Fast forward another fifteen minutes, a waiter came by and brought me a menu. I tried, in vain, to order before he darted away. Fast forward another fifteen minutes, the waiter didn't come back to take my order until I literally flagged him down to do so (the restaurant was not busy at all). \\n\\nNow onto the food. I ordered a $21 hamburger described as  \\"HOUSE GROUND SHORT RIBS, BIBB LETTUCE, BACON, HATCH PEPPER JAM, HATCH PEPPER CHEESE, PICKLES, SMOKED AIOLI, BRIOCHE BUN, BEER BATTERED ONION RINGS *LIMITED QUANTITY*\\" \\n\\nI tried, in vain again, to order the burger medium rare to which the waiter responded \\"we only do rare or medium, idk why!\\" Alrighty, I ordered rare as, in my experience, restaurants tend to overcook ground beef.\\n\\nBoy was I wrong, the burger came back seared on the outside but completely raw in the middle. Absolutely disgusting, if this was a steak it would've been less cooked than blue rare. \\n\\nThe brioche bun was too small for the patty and coated in grease. The pepper ham was actually delicious, the only thing I could eat. Also there was no bacon to be found on the burger. The onion rings were monstrosities coated in far too much breading and inedible. \\n\\nThe waiter sauntered by sometime later to ask how my meal was (a completely uneaten heap of practically uncooked ground beef) to which I responded (doing my best Gordon Ramsay) \\"it's raw!\\" \\n\\nThe waiter seemed unimpressed and asked simply if I wanted a box.

We've had their wines before, and really enjoyed them, especially the Chianti, but didn't have any experience with their foods since they got a new chef and rolled out a new menu about two weeks ago.\\n\\nWe started with the spinach artichoke dip; something I don't typically love, but found to be absolutely delicious.  The flavor was good, the temperature was perfect, and the cheese on top was perfectly browned.  My only very minor nitpick is we still had around 1/3 of the dip left when we ran out of bread to put it on. Oh well, I was happy to eat it with a fork.\\n\\nAfter that we moved on to the main course.  Our neighbor had posted a few different meals, but the bistecca patate captured my eye.  The steak is only cooked one way, and that way is perfect.  Don't bother asking for medium well or well done.  The roasted potatoes had the perfect level of crunch to the crust, while the insides were nice and soft, and the asparagus was flavorful and crisp.\\n\\nWe finished off the meal with a pair of desserts; I had the cheesecake with the raspberry reduction and my wife had the tiramisu.  The tiramisu was good, but the cheesecake was great.  While the raspberry reduction is a $1 \\"extra\\" that is well worth the price and adds a nice contrasting flavor, the cheesecake is no slouch on its own, and you won't be disappointed if you get it without the reduction.  Pair these with at least the $1 sampler of some of their dessert wines and you won't be disappointed (we had the Toasted Marshmallow Port and Chocolate Raspberry Port).\\n\\nWe also tried a number of different wines while we were there.  Tiffany offered a number of great recommendations, and we loved everything that we tried.  The fruit wines weren't overly sweet, and I really enjoyed the flight that I put together.  While I typically don't love reds, my wife ordered the Italian Full Body Flight, and all three of them were very good.\\n\\nTiffany and Stephanie were great with their recommendations and service throughout the night.  Bonus kudos to Stephanie doing so well on her first night working there!\\n\\nIf I could offer one small amount of feedback to Camelot, it's that I'd like to see more cider options for those of us who aren't huge wine drinkers.  There was only one option, and it was from Mad Moon (kudos for it being a local cidery rather than Angry Orchard or Redd's Apple Ale).  It would have been nice to see at least two or three bottled options from Mad Moon, or even one on their taps.  Bottled options would even allow for bringing in some more obscure options from cideries outside of the area.  Thank you, Camelot for an awesome night!

Great artifacts all around the restaurant.  Great beer selection and served at the proper temperature.  Service was good.

I have been to this particular ramen place on numerous occasions and I can't express how satisfied I've been each and every time . \\n\\nThis time around I actually went for a friends birthday and Santouka has yet again impressed me and my party of 8. \\n\\nThe Harvard Square location is the bigger of the two nearby locations (the other being near Back Bay) and offers mostly street parking . Every time I've gone to this location it has always been busy, but for all the good reasons of course . The hassle of the parking and wait is well worth the quality and service Santouka provides .\\n\\nUpon being seated to your table , the staff will often at times provide a tradition warm group welcome which provides to the overall immersion and experience. The decor feels relatively modern yet comforting in my opinion as well . \\n\\nTo start, we first order a few appetizers in the form of gyoza (fried crispy dumplings ) , takoyaki (wheat-base octopus balls ) and kara-age (Japanese fried chicken) . All were pretty standard, tasty and familiar if you are accustomed to these types of dishes . It felt like great care was taken toward making these appetizers and they were all well received from everyone in my party.\\n\\nAs for the main selling point of the restaurant, I personally ordered a ramen bowl combo that includes an additional flavored egg (on top of the toppings that were already included) to put into your actual ramen if you wish and a fair sized rice bowl on the side . The ramen in this combo comes in a small sized bowl, but if you are extra hungry you can upgrade to a regular size for an extra $1 or large for an extra $2. I upgraded to the large size without regret . \\n\\nThe rice bowl was topped with cooked salmon , roe and scallions . There is also an option for a pork based rice bowl as well for anyone that doesn't prefer or is in the mood for salmon . Quite tasty and really a great change of pace from the noodles if you were craving something ricey in between bites .\\n\\nAs for the ramen, I went with my go-to favorite ramen-based flavor in Shio . Shio ramen is made from a salt-base flavored broth and this particular dish taste quite dynamic in terms of the overall depth of flavor. It was addicting and tasted complete. For any of these ramen dishes, you can literally taste the quality and care that was put towards creating these broths . If one particular flavor doesn't suit your taste buds then there are other flavors to try until you find your personal preference. My ramen originally was topped with bamboo strips , seaweed , scallions and couple slices of pork belly . Additional toppings can be added for an extra cost. I personally added a side of pork cheek which was pretty tasty as well . \\n\\nThis is hands down one of my favorite ramen places of all time . Other than that, there is nothing much more to say other than come and try it out for yourself !"},{"name":"McMenamins Kennedy School","address":"5736 NE 33rd Ave.","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"It is certainly very unique.

The Chicken and waffles were terrible. The Chicken was very greasy. We talk to the manager he was very rude, over the top condescending. He says if you order it you have to pay for it. No sorry about this or an offer to fix it. I'm not in the businesses of going to eat and not eat. He rolled his eyes neck everything. Very unprofessional. Please don't waste your time and money on going here. I've had better fried rice at a low budget Chinese restaurant and better chicken at the waffle house. Attitude speaks volumes to me. Customer service was awful.

It was excellent and cheap.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I have to agree w/Tiff T., though; this place has gone down a bit over the years.  The last three times I went, the meat portion of the dish was very poorly executed.  The first two of those times, the shrimp was either undercooked or grossly mushy - so much so that I couldn't even eat it (which is saying a lot for me; I don't easily get grossed out by food).  By the third time, I thought I'd better follow the immortal advice of George W.:  \\"Fool me once, shame on you; fool me - you can't get fooled again,\\" so I ordered a chicken dish.  The chicken was at least still juicy, but there was nil in the way of flavoring on it.  It was stark white.  I had to break out the sriracha sauce and smother the whole thing.\\n\\nAll that said, it is cheap, fast, and the noodle part of the dishes usually tastes good.  They have a nice little patio, too, which is great if the weather is good.  This restaurant is owned by the same folks who own Satay, and I like Thai Noodles, Etc. better - mostly because I'd rather pay less for mediocre food and Satay costs more.\\n\\nI can't resist throwing in a funny story about something that happened to me there recently.  I was all dressed up for a night on the town, wearing heels and a halter top.  I got up from my table to use the restroom, and on my way back, some lady grabbed me and loudly said, \\"We're ready to order!\\"  When I told her I didn't work there, she about died.

It mentioned this establishment, along with another back in Portland (Laurelhurst Market) I just tried.     The main themes of the article was that the new style of Steakhouse is all about the following secular trends: Nose to Tail cooking, expanded and exotic fare, female friendly menus, premium sides, and varied drink options that better correspond with the variety of main course offerings.   \\n\\nSo...we started with drinks in the small lounge area.  King and Duke has a great mix of cocktails, draft and bottled beer.   I did not look at the wine list, but honestly this looks like a place where I would always drink beer or hard liquor.    We hung out there from around 5:30-7:30 and watched the dining room slowly but surely filled up.     I really liked the decor, and layout here.   \\n\\nAt 7:30 a business partner of mine and I had dinner to talk through our meeting.   The house bread is a Yorkshire Pudding with white cheddar.  Much like my experiences at BLT, and say a Lawrys Steakhouse (Dallas), this bread is remarkable and a great way to start a meal.    for dinner, we had the Crab Toast which was just OK, even mediocre I would say.  We also had the grilled Octopus, and it was amazing.  I think, hands down the best Grilled Octopus I have ever had.     This is a MUST TRY. \\n\\nWe both just had the King Burger which was a mix of Chuck and Dry Aged cuts.

The fire in the open kitchen is the real deal.   They were burning Hickory, it was very cool. \\n\\nToo many of these New-American Southern restaurants in Cities like Atlanta, Nashville, Charlotte and Tampa have good food, but lack the upscale ambiance that I prefer.

Their duck dishes are amazing especially the duck skewers. We tried the pineapple fried rice, red curry, brisket pho and the wonton soup and everything was really good. My only reason to give 4 star is that I thought some of the dishes were a bit sweeter than I would have liked it such as the wonton soup. I added their chili oil and the green chilli paste which made it better, but definitely the dishes have more sugar than I would have wanted. Also they had just one dessert ..the mango sticky rice and I was looking for more options.  Overall it is good and would definitely coming back for more."},{"name":"It's Italian Cucina","address":"1500 South Lamar Blvd, Ste 110","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"My husband really likes this place but every time we go I am underwhelmed. Today we went for lunch. At 12:30, we were one of a few tables and no one new arrived during our lunch. At lunch the entrees all come with soup or salad. My Caesar salad was salty and my husband's vegetable soup that had \\"only veggies\\" per our unenthusiastic waitress, had pork. We do not eat pork. I had the spaghetti bolognese which was flavorless and the pasta all stuck together in a giant clump. My husband's pasta della casa was very good. I think the piece that bothers me most about this restaurant is the unfriendly and elitist owner. We used to come during be week because we both exercised nearby, my husband and I would meet for a post-workout dinner. On multiple occasions the owner gave us disgusted looks for coming in wearing athleisure. Then on another occasion we came with friends and their 16 month old.

You can pick your protein (burger, chicken crispy or grilled, or a black bean burger) and customize it from a wide variety of toppings or preselected options. My husband ordered the classic smash and I had the crispy chicken buffalo and blue cheese, we shared the smash fries and a chocolate peanut butter shake, my son had a kid's cheeseburger and fries. The smash burger was ok, honestly reminded me of a McDonald's burger, nothing too special for me. The chicken sandwich was like the burger, ok but not so good I would go out of my way to order it again, I would have liked a little more sauce and cheese on the sandwich as the chicken was oversized for the bun but needed more flavor. The smash fries had good flavor but were on the greasy side. The best part was the chocolate peanut butter shake, sweet, thick and delicious, I like that they served it with the cup and between the three of us we had no problem drinking it up.

Known as \\"Atlanta's Dining Room,\\" this restaurant first opened in 1945 and is beloved by many, from locals to tourists, from plumbers to congressmen and everyone in between.\\n\\nThis Southern joint, located on Ponce De Leon Avenue, is always bustling. We waited 15 minutes or so on New Years Eve for lunch!\\n\\nThe restaurant also stays true to its origins by having its guests fill out order forms by hand. It definitely exudes a Southern charm, boasting a super sweet iced tea (\\"Table Wine of the South\\"), \\"cracklin' cornbread\\" and pot likker, the liquid that collard greens are cooked in. In fact, if it's your first visit to Mary Mac's you can ask for a cup of pot likker for free!\\nThis clean and simple broth is somewhat mild, but a dash of hot pepper sauce gives it a bit of kick and tang, and a piece of cornbread dipped into it soaks up the broth perfectly.\\n\\nIf I wasn't careful, I could fill myself up on just cinnamon rolls, corn bread and yeast rolls from the bread basket. The cinnamon rolls were pretty small and could use a bit more chewiness and bite, but they were still pretty good. The yeast rolls were soft and warm and delicious, especially with a pat of butter. The cornbread was the favorite between Andrew and I - it was crispy on the outside, yet warm and crumbly on the inside.\\n\\nI ordered my shrimp and grits with fried green tomatoes and collard greens. The shrimp and grits were delicious, second only to the dish I had at Cafe Amelie in New Orleans. It was creamy and gooey with cheese, and dusted with some sort of red spice (Cajun seasoning? Old Bay?). Also, the amount of shrimp was generous!\\n\\nThe fried green tomatoes were on point - the breading was solid, the tomatoes were firm and tart, and the horseradish sauce it was served with packed a punch, but wasn't overwhelming.\\n\\nThe collard greens were also delicious - braised until they were soft and soppy from the broth. I recommend adding a dash of hot pepper sauce!\\n\\nAndrew ordered the 4-piece fried chicken, which included a breast, wing, leg and thigh. We agreed that the chicken was well-seasoned and had a crunchy breading, though the breast was a bit dry in some parts. However, the dark meat was mostly tender and juicy.\\n\\nHe ordered his fried chicken with mac and cheese and whipped potatoes. The mac and cheese was actually very disappointing! It was watery for some reason, and the pasta and the cheese had separated a bit - overall, unappetizing.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the whipped potatoes with gravy were great - creamy, but with a bit of chunk, and seasoned well.\\n\\nOur peach cobbler, however, was a bit too sweet, to be honest, and I suspect that the peaches were canned. It wasn't anything special.\\n\\nOverall, the meal was one of the best places I've found in Atlanta for true Southern food. The portions were huge, and for $25 per person, we brought back about half of our meals as leftovers, which I deem a fair price.\\n\\nRead more on my blog, Cat the Critic!"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"It's been a couple years since my last visit and a group of friends wanted to go.

The only negative, and a big one at that, was probably the manager, whose name I never got (since I was just a guest anyway).  Everyone else, however, was helpful and so nice.  My friend wanted the music turned down so we could better hear a video we were playing on a screen.  I asked the manager, and he said that the music was coming from our computers, which was pretty impossible since they were not hooked up at the time.  He insisted it was not from the restaurant itself, which was ridiculous since the music (classical) was not anything we had on our laptops and were coming out of speakers that were in the rear of the room, which no one occupied.  I brought him over to the music, but we couldn't hear it at the time (bc the video had already started), but we heard it later.  I guess he managed to turn it off later, even though the music was supposedly not coming from the restaurant.  I asked him to turn on the speakers later for the slideshow and he acted like I was bothering him.  Seriously, the rudest manager ever - how did he even get a job in the industry?  My friend complained later, but I heard they were not very apologetic about it.  What terrible service - I don't recommend having your wedding reception here ever. unless they get a new manager.\\n\\nWe had an open bar with a few different liquors to choose from.  It wasn't a regular bar but  a table set up as one, but it worked fine.

I was given a piece of paper as well to write my order: I got a housemade lemonade, shrimp and grits with dumplings and broccoli souffle as my sides, and banana pudding for dessert. I was really hungry when I ordered, but I realized I got way too much food. The lemonade was a bit too sweet and I wasn't a fan. The shrimp and grits were amazing! Shrimp was very well-seasoned and tasty, and I liked the onions/bell peppers sprinkled on top although I wish there was more of it as that's where the flavor for the grits came from. The basket of bread was also just okay, but I was disappointed to not have a cinnamon roll in there! The dumplings were a bit soft and I'm not sure what the sauce was, and the broccoli in the souffle was very overcooked and not tasty at all. I didn't like the sides too much. Shrimp and grits were delicious though. The banana pudding was also tasty! A lot of bread and bananas in there, but it was a tad too sweet. \\nI was really full at the end of my meal, and it was a lot of food.

Since it was my first time my friend and I were given a sample of complimentary Pot Likker (a soup of boiled turnips). It was soothing, perfect for the chilly weather and the mini cinnamon rolls were so warm and fluffy. I had to stop myself from eating them all.\\n\\nMary Mac's is known for their Fried Chicken and have won countless awards for it. Guests can order different quantities, but my friend and I opted for three legs since we both love dark meat. Each dish is accompanied by two sides. We ordered tomato pie, broccoli souffle, collard greens, and baked sweet potato - the former two were absolutely delicious.\\n\\nThe fried chicken legs were very moist and tender, but the skin could have been more crisp.

I am far from a fan of green tea in anything besides a cup and hot water. A few bites were taken.... It took a while for Griffin to return to our table to ask how our dessert was. We explained our discontent. Griffin showed no empathy and didn't offer to substitute for something else. A disheartening close to an otherwise tasty set of appetizers and entrees. We then had to stare at the cake several minutes while we waited for him to come retrieve our payment so we could leave. Also it wasn't explained that there would be an up-charge to substitute brown for jasmine(no biggie). Our drinks were never once asked to be refreshed. Our ice was delicious!

I settled on an entree of Indian 5 spice escab√®che of fish on a bed of fennel with saffron couscous. The waiter explained that this term means that in addition to a spice marinade vinegar can be used to bring a new taste dimension  to the dish. The flavors in this dish were fabulous and perfectly balanced.

The corn bread and yeast rolls were just meh in my opinion.\\n\\nI ordered the 3 piece fried chicken (legs) with tomato pie and pot likker as my sides. The fried chicken wasn't bad, but I think it would have been better if it didn't get soggy by the spilled pot likker on my plate. The tomato pie was rich and pretty good, but the pot likker was a bit too salty for me even though this seemed to be recommended by a lot of other yelpers. One thing I like about Mary mac's is the variety of the sides, there are so many different sides I wanted to try here! I also got to try a friends key lime pie and it was pretty good.

They thought of everything - from the extended hours, reservations, fixed menu with champagne toast, and cute hats for everyone. \\n\\nI love the interior. King and Dukes is named after characters from The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, so the interior has this cool, modern library vibe. Dark, but very clean with dim light of candles on each table. It was louder on NYE, but I would imagine it's a pretty low key place on most other nights. \\n\\nLet's talk about the food. We had a fixed 4 course meal with champagne toast for $75. There were options for each course. This is how mine went:\\n\\nWagyu beef for first course - thinly sliced wagyu beef with some type of oil and crunch to it. My favorite thing of the entire evening \\n\\nShort rib for second course - very tender, nothing spectacular flavor wise\\n\\nLobster for third course - maybe my least favorite as it had a weird taste I couldn't pin point\\n\\nCreme brulee for last course - would have been perfect, but I was not a fan of the citrus like gelatin beneath it\\n\\nI also tried my husband's cucumbers, scallops, duck, and chocolate tart. I would return for the scallops and duck for sure. The duck was my second favorite of the whole evening. \\n\\nService....great as expected with lots of staff coming by our table to tend to our every need.

I had saved this restaurant on my Yelp because of the number of reviews it had - before learning that it's an actual hot spot with LOTS of history. We found out from locals that the Union Oyster House is the oldest consistently operated restaurant in America, opening in 1826. It's also located on one of the oldest streets in the country. That's helpful information to know because with old buildings, comes old structures so the bathroom stalls were TINY. My husband and I both mentioned how we had a difficult time fitting in the stalls lol. I loved all the history on the walls including newspaper articles, artifacts, ships, names of famous attendees, and so much more. There's so much to see throughout the entire restaurant. We were seated without reservations with John on the 2nd floor. He was by far the best waiter we had during our week-long visit. He was informative not only about the menu (providing information about items before we even had to ask about them) but also about things to do around town while we were visiting. He spent time with all of his tables having fun conversations and making everyone's visits enjoyable. John is the definition of a five-star waiter and is a perfect example of what every waiter should strive to be. He truly made our visit that much better. I had the shrimp and scallops over rice in a sundried tomato cream sauce and it was by far the best meal of my entire trip. My whole family also had a bite and agreed that it was OUTSTANDING. Everyone enjoyed their meals as well and we would absolutely come back when in town again.

Yes please!\\n\\nWe had a very enthusiastic, chatty waitress who greeted us as we sat.  We took our time to peruse the menu, because frankly, everything looked amazing and it was just so nice to sit outside and relax.  As a raspberry lover, I ordered the Back Porch lemonade and was happily surprised at its deliciousness.  You couldn't taste the vodka and the lemonade wasn't super sweet; just refreshing and perfect for #porchdrinkin'.  We quickly ordered hushpuppies, which were pretty good for sweet corn hushpuppies (I just prefer savory ones).  We also ordered the calamari, which was superb with the smoky marinara sauce.  I would highly recommend the calamari and a glass of white wine for patio eats.  \\n\\nFor entrees, my friend and I decided to split the pound of crab legs.  And some fried okra.

Hubby ordered the \\"simply\\" grouper with grits, and our other friend got the crab cake appetizer and shrimp mac & cheese (he probably ordered the wisest).  The crab was juicy and wonderful and I really enjoyed both sides.  I'm sure the scallops over the hoppin' john are terrific.  The \\"simply\\" grouper was fine; not overly amazing, but not bad either and would tick the box if you're having a blackened grouper craving.  I thought the same about the grits - just fine.

They usually have cider available, and they have recently expanded their wine offerings.  I had a good sparkling rose today.  They have the best events and release parties.  The south location has better parking, and a spacious interior, and covered patio.  Definitely more room for people here, but has a less homey feel.  I like the ambiance at the north location better.   The food menu is the same at both locations. I wish they would mix up their menu a bit.  It gets old after awhile.  The pizza is OK, the nachos are the best, and the salads are fresh and tasty.  They also have a frozen beer machine here that is incredible.  The frozen island kitty we had today was AMAZING!!!

He was hostile for no good reason. My boyfriend told the manager about the waiter and he proceeded to tell us that there is a $26 minimum that starts at 8 which we got there before, the manager was apologetic but did not come anything which I thought was strange.

The last time i was there was for a Monday Night Football game (Denver Broncos vs. Atlanta Falcons).  There was a Jersey draw that they were giving away in which you would receive a raffle ticket per each beverage bought.  I was informed that the draw would take place at the start of the 3rd quarter.  However that was not the case, when i noticed that that the jersey that they were raffling away was not having up by the TV's i inquired with our server, where she then said to me the they had already done the draw.  They never announced the draw but after following up with our server again she informed me that the Bartender had marked the winning ticket with a pen.  Which is fine, however when the winner of the jersey is one of the bartenders friends, then it raises questions.  Especially afterwards the bartender is providing free drinks for them and then telling them to come by again the following week to win the next jersey.\\n\\nNow before i go on, this may sound like someone lost a raffle draw and is wanting to complain, but this is not the case.  If the draw was conducted fairly i would not be posting this nor complaint on the matter.\\n\\nSo afterwards i sent a email to the Original Joe's info address to inform them about this, and here is where i felt that i got the \\"too bad tough luck\\" saying.  I had sent a email giving them the full details of what happen even providing names for my server,  and the bartender in question.  I got a response back with the basic sorry your visit was not great response.  However the next part of the email was where i question the fact if they care about their customers.  The person that responded to the email had said that \\"i can confirm that it was a sever that made the draw\\".  Unless he was there he cannot prove that!  I was there i asked my sever and she said that the bartender made the draw.  So are they calling me a liar? Was i drunk? Was i not paying attention?\\n\\nWhen i responded back that i would be going to restaurant review sites to let people know about this they sent me a eCard.  Now yes that would be fine but how does that do justice to the fact that the bartender gets away with this and people continue to come in and try to get a chance to win a prize equally but some employee thinks that is not the case.  Based on this matter i went to the person that i had been going back and forth with via email and said that a eCard is nice but why would this make me want to come back? I said that i want the prize that was suppose to be given away that day (yes it sounds greedy but being called a liar is not something i find appropriate for a company to say to a customer).\\n\\nSo if you plan on going to Original Joe's to win a prize that they are offering, think twice because unless you are friends with people that work there you will not only spend extra money on getting a chance at winning but will ultimately lose."},{"name":"Top of the Hub","address":"800 Boylston St, Ste 52","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The views are obviously beautiful, and the waiter was really kind.

For the love of all things precious, order the Banh Cuon!\\n\\nBefore I go into the food, here's some info on how to find this. It's easily identifiable from Colonial Drive, but is a bit trickier to find from the back parking lot (where you'll find the most parking). Walk from the parking lot towards the back of the strip mall and you'll see signs for a salon. Behind an overgrowth of vines is the sign you'll most definitely miss to find the back entrance. Basically walk towards the right and go through one door- where you'll swear you're in the wrong place, go down the hallway and enter the next door to get into the back of the restaurant. Walk in with confidence. Worst-case scenario, you go into a salon instead. Best-case? You find yourself in this heavenly food oasis.\\n\\nCaveat-- I'm not Vietnamese and I didn't grow up eating Vietnamese food, but I can give the perspective of someone who discovered this cuisine 7 years ago when she moved to the Mills 50 'hood and hasn't looked back since. Why do I mention this? Because my palate is surely not as well-tuned as many and I don't have a history eating many of these dishes, so take my review as from someone on the outside with great admiration and respect for this food.\\n\\nSo, let's go with my basic order. I'm a BIG fan of a good bowl of Pho. When I'm at Vietnam Cuisine, I generally order the Pho tai. This is a very simple Pho bowl with rare, thin slices of beef and the typical toppings for you to add on your own. What sets their Pho apart from those in the area is the depth of the broth. It is the closest I've found to the Pho my bf makes (a closely guarded family recipe passed down for generations) in that the broth is good enough to sip on its own. They clearly put time and love into this broth and it sets them apart.\\n\\nBesides by uber-basic order, I've been here with friends that helped me try new dishes. My favorite, by far, was the Banh Cuon - Vietnamese steamed rice rolls. To describe them to a newbie, these are extremely delicate sheets of rice paper, filled with pork and mushrooms, and carefully rolled into cylinders. I can't stress enough how delicate these are. And that's what makes them so special. Like many Vietnamese dishes, this won't make you feel sickly full, unlike a Manicotti (Italian dish that very very vaguely resembles this in that it's filled rolls). You'll notice that these sometimes break as you grab them with your chopsticks, but if you're careful, you'll get them in all their glory. They are topped with fried shallots and come with a basic dipping sauce that you can pour over them (sweet and tangy vinegar sauce). \\n\\nBesides these dishes, everything I've tried here has been really great and authentic."},{"name":"Smashburger","address":"334 N Alafaya Trl","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"First time here, had the \\"avocado\\" burger. \\nLet me paint the picture, you cut an avocado in half, then from that half you cut a slice, then you cut that slice in 3 small pieces, that's what the \\"avocado\\" burger brings.

The food was out of the world - i had the Sweet Potato Tamales.. those were really flavorful and made even better by the sides - the salsa and the beans were both the best that I had ever tasted! Also, there was this spicy habanero condiment on the table which when used in the right quantity, took the food to another level.

But the toast on the tartare was perfectly toasted and easy to bite into. \\n\\nFor our entrees we ordered the grilled swordfish and the prime NY stripe.

Oh yeah, and some tasty drinks!\\n\\nThis review is just for the experience at the Lounge/bar area of Hamilton's Kitchen. A couple of friends and I decided to grab drinks in the afternoon (hey- it was after noon!) and thought it'd be the perfect spot. \\n\\nFirst- I have to mention the art. Patrons and hotel guests are treated to some fantastic pieces by world-renowned artists from the Cornell collection. The ambiance of the space is open, bright, and has small vignettes everywhere for a more personal seating experience with friends (each small seating area has unique furniture making it feel truly special). We went straight for the drinks menu and I was excited by what I saw. It looked like really finely-crafted cocktails are their specialty. I went with the Cucumber Mint Gimlet and one of my girlfriends went with the Bloody Mary. \\n\\nThe Cucumber Mint Gimlet had muddled mint leaves and cucumber slices at the bottom and a lime garnish. It was a bit sweet for my taste as I think the cucumber, mint, and gin would have gone well with club soda versus the tonic they used (no sugar needed!). It was a tad steep for the size drink ($10), but I felt like I was paying for the ambiance and I was A-OK with that! \\n\\nI got to try my friend's Bloody Mary made with Zing Zang mix which was good and had a great kick. The only note I'd have is to work on the garnish a bit more. It consisted of one olive, a slice of lime, and cucumber. I think it'd be great to have a stick of celery and some other extra garnish - Particularly since it's a drink that uses a mix, attention to the presentation and a special garnish would have taken it over the edge and made it stand out as a unique bloody mary. But I'll add that we were all taking turns taking sips of this savory, spicy drink so the garnish is the only note!\\n\\nOverall, drinks were pleasant and we had a great time. I'd definitely return and recommend it to my fancy friends - teehee!\\n\\nP.S. Paul McCartney brunches here when he's in town.

I went for dinner and the staff were attentive and food tasty.\\n\\nOn the other hand, 1 star for speed of the line today, an absolute disaster. My girlfriend and I were standing in line, inside the door about 11:30am, but did not sit down with food until approx. 12:40pm. Cycle time near the end was about 1.5 minutes per customer: with 12 people in front, it took about another 18 minutes.\\n\\nWhat's the cause? I think phone orders. The lead cook was working hard and moving fast, but he had to cook most everything himself. In these conditions, the single cook is the bottleneck, and so phone order after phone order for takeout simply slows down the line on about a one order for one order basis. Essentially phone orders get to cut the line. Bleh. Perhaps they should post a sign that when the line is at the door that the wait is approximately 1-2 hours so the non-regulars can at least make an informed choice.\\n\\nAs you can see from the photos, there's a massive line but almost all the tables are empty. Strange but it makes sense from a mathematical, operations perspective. Because the line is advancing so slowly, people finish their food before the next group has their dishes cooked and are ready to sit. Why was the line moving so slowly? Partially because takeout orders were using up the cook and grill's capacity.

Nobody had a smile on their face. When someone finally seated us, it took a while for a server to take our order.  Despite of the fact that the place was not busy, we waited a while for the food to come out . My boyfriend got a biscuit with his meal. No butter or jelly was offered or on the table. Server didn't check on us. Server didn't offer to refill coffee. We had to ask twice before we got more orange juice. I had to get up and ask for things.

When I eat Italian I want those big portions, filled with carbs and flavour. Loved the Egg appetizer, it was a modern play on a tuna fish sandwich. Meatballs were beautiful. Cauliflower and the arugula salad both were sooo good!  The lamb ragu pasta was a little bit gamey. The feature vegetarian pasta was delicious, and you don't miss meat if you're a meat eater. Now, the server seemed a bit pretentious when explaining the features, saying a lot of things we didnt understand and seemed scripted from the kitchen. Then after we placed the order, he commented that it was a lot of food! I like to eat, and plan to splurg on my night out.

A few antipasti and pasta dishes and classic dessert; Four beverage selections available on tap. Red wine, white wine, beer and Prosecco; and filtered still or sparkling water on tap. \\n\\nTo start we drooled over pictures online.\\n\\nBeef Carpaccio 14: This plate of rare beef was magnificent. Thinly sliced beef that is not bloody. The salsa verde is perfect full of fresh herbs, capers, lemon, garlic and anchovy. And the sliced cheese added was perfecto.\\n\\nDuck Ragu Pappardelle 19: What can I say. I love fresh pasta. I love fresh pasta that is cooked al dente. The duck meat sauce had a punch of subtle heat. I do wish there was a tad more sauce. Near the end my pasta was near dry.\\n\\nBraised Lamb & Sunchoke Risotto 19: Lamb is my sexy meat next to duck. The finely shredded lamb meat was tender and was a nice company to the al dente risotto. I appreciate a nice creamy rice not cooked like baby food.\\n\\nPanna Cotta 7: This cream and sugar gelatin with prunes should not be missed. I remembered our last prune cake from L'Abattoir was equally amazing. I liked how Ask For Luigi paired poached prunes and biscotti with their Panna Cotta.

I had the fried chicken sammie, and it is without a doubt one of the best things I've ever eaten. It has a tangy sauce that offsets that crunchy chicken that somehow stays insanely moist.

I've seen so many truffled deviled eggs that I don't honestly care if I ever have one again, but these were a delight.

Locals who worked at my hotel literally rolled their eyes at me when I walked in carrying the big, pink box.\\n\\nI have to give Voodoo credit for creating a brand and also getting creative with their donuts. A decade ago when they opened (before the 'foodie revolution' which brought pho, cronuts and street tacos to every suburban town in America) they were cutting edge. Nobody was putting Captain Crunch cereal or bacon on donuts. To do so was literally like the invention of smartphones ... unheard of by anyone, but loved by all.\\n\\nOver the years they have stayed in the news by having the FDA stop them from making donuts with a shot of Nyquil or pepto bismo in the center, etc. Naming donuts The Old Dirty Bastard or Marshal Mathers has given them hipster street cred. But honestly, they didn't taste any different from donuts you could get at Wegmans or Dunkin. Maybe a bit more 'sugar bling' ...\\n\\nMy favorite of all was the maple bacon log. I also tried the original voodoo which beyond the cute doll shape was pretty much a standard Boston Cream donut shell with jelly inside. Nothing special beyond the likes it will get on instagram. The Memphis Mafia fritter was way too dense. After a few bites, I was over-sugared and full. Way too much going on here ... maybe it would have been better with a glass of milk.\\n\\nThey were out of the cake donuts when I went, around midnight, probably because they were the cheapest donuts at about a buck each. The other donuts were around $3 and the fritters like ODB, Memphis Mafia and Marshall Mathers, were $5 which was a complete rip off.\\n\\nThe line was about 10 minutes long. I was drunk and didn't mind waiting as the people watching was good. (its right next to two dance clubs) However, they don't really need the line ... it's just that they have 2 people working the counter (slowly) so I think the line pretty much just adds to the 'mystique' of the place. \\"If people are willing to wait outside for 10 minutes, this must be legit!'\\n\\nGlad I tried it. It didn't suck. But it wasn't really anything all that special. Maybe it would have been 5 stars in 2003 when it was impossible to find creative donuts anywhere. Oh yeah ... cash only.

I ended up choosing the Dixie style because it had a fried green tomato and pimento cheese and it went great together. Their recommended styles all looked really good so it was hard to choose from. The burgers can also be custom made from their list of ingredients. They are a little bit on the expensive side, but you can get a double burger for under $10. They also have veggie burgers and impossible burgers which are nice for the vegetarian crowd. I also got the onion rings which were all right. They also have alcoholic milkshakes which are actually pretty strong and tasty. We got the cinnamon one which also had Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal in it. This place also has a great ambience going for it. They have a retro sci-fi style atmosphere going with classic movies playing on tvs and projectors.

The ladies walked me through their plans, and I was hooked.\\n\\nFast forward to early January, and I held a CMYE (Community Manager Yelp Event) for about 35 Yelpers. The entire staff was so lovely, and everyone had a blast at the event. I knew I'd be back for a genuine consumer experience--you know, one that I could *actually* review.\\n\\nFast forward to Saturday night. It was a blistering 40 degrees outside and gallery hop too--perfect for the entire city to venture out... most of them to Kingmakers... my friends and me included.\\n\\nMy buddy, Malika, quickly welcomed us at the door and put us on the short wait list. She suggested that we head to the bar for a drink, and then Sherm came over to get us started with a game at the bar! This was absolutely the best experience I've ever had waiting for a table. What a create way to keep us occupied!\\n\\nAs the night went on, my friends and I had so much fun! Just drinking and playing the night away... we easily got lost in it all. I could see myself here all the time.\\n\\nThe other reviews have done a great job at explaining the entire process, so I'll let you read all about it from them. But I'd like to add a few helpful tips that hopefully will make your experience great:\\n\\n*Parking - It's the Short North; parking is like The Hunger Games. Some of my favorite hiding spots are along Goodale by the park or in the new Hub garage.\\n\\n*The decor - Kingmakers is meant to feel like you're playing games at a friend's house. This isn't a posh lounge where the games come secondary to the interior style. But for me, I much prefer the coziness that Kingmakers brings.\\n\\n*The staff - They're all board game sommeliers... not seasoned waitstaff. Keep that in mind. But seriously, these are some of the nicest people I've ever met. I want to hug them all and put them in my pocket.\\n\\n*The dranks - Beer and wine on tap! Oh, and if you're not into boozing, they have a fabulous selection of unique sodas.\\n\\n*The snacks - Brezel to the rescue! These things are legit. Don't even think about it--get some.\\n\\n*The fee - It's $5 to play as much as you want. C'mon... that's a steal. But this *is* per person, so don't get all offended when your kiddos don't get to play for free."},{"name":"Folk Art Restaurant","address":"465 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Went here after attending a nearby play.

It's a historical landmark and actually served oysters to Daniel Webster when the restaurant was named Atwood & Bacon Oyster House. That oyster bar was established in 1826. The Union Oyster House name was commonly used when referencing it. Another known fact is that the Kennedy family would often dine in a private booth on the second floor. That booth is now named \\"The Kennedy Booth.\\" \\n\\nThis appeared to be a very popular restaurant & bar. It was packed when we got there on a Saturday evening around 6:00 pm. Reservations are highly encouraged. There is a makeshift ramp for wheelchair accessibility, but I would definitely call ahead for assistance and to make sure that you have a table on the first floor. As it is with many historical buildings of this nature, there are no elevators but the hostess there is super accommodating. She saw my 91 year old mother and immediately asked if she could climb up 15 steps. She told us to wait a few minutes, but the wait wasn't long because she got up and escorted us to this awesome room called the \\"Webster Den\\" that was beautifully decorated with historical memorabilia and had booths made of hard wood. It was perfect! We couldn't have asked for a better seating arrangement. \\n\\nThe service was immediate. We got our very large chunk of cornbread as we looked at the menu (which was very extensive). The cornbread was sweet like the Jiffy mix but was way better than that. My husband was wondering how they were able to get the nice crisp edges without burning it. That's actually a nice compliment coming from him. We decided to start with the Oysters Rockefeller. These were very large oysters covered in spinach and a very faint sauce. It was very good. My husband had the clam chowder which he claimed was the best one of the entire trip. \\n\\nAt this point we finally made a decision of what to order. My husband got the fried seafood platter but got them to add more shrimp instead of the oysters. My mother got the crab cakes. It was recommended by our server as something light. Mom doesn't eat much. I ended up getting one of their specials called the Lazy Man's Lobster. So, to be honest, I wasn't as impressed with this dish. It had a lot of lobster which I was very happy with. I think it was that there wasn't much of a creamy sauce. In fact, it tasted more like the lobster was marinated in sherry. Not a bad thing if you love sherry, but it was a little overpowering for me. I also felt like there were too much bread crumbs on top of it. I had to move some of them over to take a decent picture of it (which doesn't do it any justice). There was more meat than what you see in that picture. I would order something different next time. It just wasn't my cup of tea. I had a taste of mom's crab cake and it was delicious. It was totally full of crab meat. A tasty treat and mom ate most of it. I also tasted a little of my husband's fried platter. He did get some clams, and he's really not a seafood eater. Mom and I had the fried clams and they were amazing. I think they were whole belly clams. Delish!! I'd get their clams and oysters again if I'm ever in the area.\\n\\nSo, why 5 stars? Well, the service was excellent and the young manager even brought us a slice of Boston Cream Pie on the house. It was the only Boston Cream I had the entire trip (most people go to the Omni Parker Hotel for that), but it was delicious. I loved the thick coating of chocolate surrounding the vanilla custard. The cake was super moist. It was a big hit! The 3 of us shared that slice. Would do it all over again in a heartbeat. This restaurant is a must visit in my eyes. I wouldn't pass it up as being a touristy place like other reviews have mentioned. I would love to go back and try their raw oysters and even the steamers.

I'd get the vegetable plate to try the hoppin' john, the sweet potato souffle, the fried green tomatoes, the collards, the mac and cheese, the fried okra, the spiced apples... and nothing would be quite as flavorful as I was expecting.  The sweet potatoes are sickeningly sweet, the fried foods are a tad greasy, the collards don't taste like much of anything, and the mac and cheese was chunky with flour instead of cheesy.  \\n\\nSure, we'd made some memories at Mary Mac's.  I'm proud to say that I was a witness to Daniel B's run in with Jo, and that he left out the part where she offered that he could feel her leg if it would make him feel more comfortable about the situation.  But it was never on account of the food.\\n\\nFinally, after years of disappointing visits, I tried the catfish with broccoli cheese souffle and green beans.  Best combination I've ever had.  The catfish is crisp and flaky.  The broccoli cheese souffle is just the right ratio of broccoli, rice, and cheese.  And the green beans have good texture and the right amount of seasoning.\\n\\nBut you do earn a badge from the History Channel when you check-in here on Foursquare.  And it is a very comfortable and welcoming place.  So stop in for lunch if you're in the area, but don't make a special trip.\\n\\n#Yelp365 - 28/265"},{"name":"Whole Food Market","address":"510 W 8th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"This is a great addition to Whole Foods and the Cambie area in general. It's stylish and open, with lots of good cafe food selection.... Not to mention wine and beer happy hour. A good place to meet a friend for a bite and/ or drink. \\nSome things to be aware of, it can get a little noisy and the coffee quality varies, regardless it's still a go-to of mine."},{"name":"The Optimist","address":"914 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I have to start by saying I was very excited about trying this place as it had been highly recommended by friends. I didn't ask them what was so great about it, but was assured that I would love it. I did not.  I did like it though, but not enough to go back anytime soon.\\n\\nThe restaurant was very nice - spacious and bright with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.  The decor was modern and minimalistic.  It was lively - there was a singing guitar player outside (who sounded quite nice by the way) and there was music playing indoors.  We sat at a table but there is also a bar for drinks and oysters.\\n\\nOur waiter (Topher) was awesome.  He answered all of our questions, made suggestions and was very attentive.  We ordered drinks, appetizers, entrees and one dessert to share.  Each course was brought out in perfect time.\\n\\nEverything so far certainly deserves 5 stars for ambiance and customer service.\\n\\nThe overpriced average food is another story.\\n\\nThe mussels were extremely fresh - probably the most tender I've ever eaten, however the flavor was just \\"good\\".  I was hoping for OMG!\\n\\nThe raw oysters were good and fresh, but the condiments they were served with weren't our favorite and kind of disappointed. We're big oyster eaters and have tried them at restaurants all over Atlanta , Florida, New York and Mexico.   I guess we could have asked for something else (no, not cocktail sauce) but we didn't think about it at the time. Not a big downer, but just wish it could have been better (for the price).\\n\\nOur entrees (Halibut and Monkfish) were small, but tasty and beautifully plated. (sorry, so excited to try the food I forgot to take pics).  For the price though they really should come with a side dish - throw a few asparagus spears or slap a scoop of rice on the plate or something - DAMN!  \\n\\nThe Chocolate Tart with Toasted Coconut and Roasted Marshmellow was pretty but the texture wasn't consistent.  The chocolate pie portion was cold and hard to scoop with your spoon which didn't mesh well with the warm marshmallow on top.  I would've enjoyed it much more if the entire thing was warm and smooth.  I flopped off my plate when I tried to get a scoop! Not good dude.\\n\\nOn the up side was my cocktail - the Scurvy Scoundrel - it was incredibllllllle!! (I had two).\\n\\nI would say this is definitely a place to check out if you like seafood and enjoy spending more money than should be required to eat it.  I don't have a problem spending money on good food - but when we think about other places we've eaten we can't help but compare. \\n\\nWould I go back, probably if someone asked me to join them, but it's not on my personal list of things to do."},{"name":"Katana Teppanyaki & Sushi","address":"3345 Lenox Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Expectations are high for Katana, thanks to its sister restaurant, The One sushi in Brookhaven. \\n\\nKatana not only has the same high quality sushi as The One, they also have communal style teppanyaki with open grills. To sum it up, Katana is an upscale version of Nakato or Benihana. But dig a little deeper, and you'll see there's much more that sets them apart. \\n\\nThe restaurant takes its design cues from Japanese art & style. The design is understated, elegant & sleek. There's a main dining area, an inviting craft bar, plus a hibachi room. \\n\\nKatana understands that we are visual creatures and we eat with our eyes first. They delight the senses with meticulous attention to detail & deliver not just a meal, but an experience! \\n\\nWe started with an order of the smoked seabass sashimi (special of the day), and I ordered the chicken dinner, while my friend had the sex & the city sushi rolls + tuna rolls. \\n\\nThe smoked seabass came out with a glass covering & when removed, smoke billowed out! It was a interesting contrast in strong + delicate. The smoked flavor tasted like a whole different world on an otherwise familiar piece of sushi. \\n\\nMy dinner included miso soup & a small salad. The chicken & vegetables were delicious - I ate every last bite! And my friend devoured all the rolls - I didn't even get the chance to try one! \\n\\n(Side note: I've had the Chilean Seabass on another occasion & it was phenomenal.)\\n\\nAs expected at a sushi restaurant, Katana has a great selection of sake, including their own private label. They also have a wide array of Japanese beers and unique cocktails. \\n\\nAnd finally, the service is spot-on.

This pizza is not fucking around. Not only that but the specials are just mind-blowing. \\n\\nThe pizza is not too cheesy, not too saucy, not too doughy, not too crispy. Ingredients are claimed to be locally sourced. \\n\\nThe cheese- high quality and never burnt. The quality is immediately noticed because its not cheap salty bulk food cheese. \\n\\nThe sauce- I dare say may be made in house like it should be, where many places in Boulder do not. Furthermore the kitchen is up front, not hidden and I never see boxes of sysco stuff like at other joints around town. \\n\\nThe crust- The dough always cooked through but not burnt on the bottom this is key because its consistent, many place in Colorado do not have consistent pizza.

Not great. Potential is there. It really could be amazing. But it's not. For the price or other similar pizza spots (all-star/Otto/flatbread) this was lacking. \\n\\nThe center of the pizza was soggy and wet. Even tried to heat some pizza in the oven to crisp it up but stayed soggy and limp. Nothing is worse than half your slice like this. \\n\\nOrdered a the cousin vinny. Slightly confused as it had minimal prosciutto (maybe one deli slice total) and the \\"fior di latte\\" is just regular melted mozz cheese like a normal white pizza.
