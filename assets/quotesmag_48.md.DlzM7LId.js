I was there yesterday and it occurred to me that I needed to Yelp this spot.\\nI've worked in downtown PDX for almost 11 years. I don't remember the first time I ended up at Gandhi's but it had to be at least 5 maybe 6 years ago. Ever since that first bite of tantalizing Vindaloo curry I've been hooked. The menu is somewhat small but the portions are big. There are several vegetarian options (for those non animal consumers) and I've never been disappointed about the taste or quality. There have been weeks where I have literally eaten here 2 or 3 times. My recommendation? The spicy (Vindaloo chicken) with either the creamy spinach or the mixed veggies (not sure what's all in it but it's yummy). For the price you'll be stuffed all day. Seriously. I tend to eat an early lunch (about 11am) and my wife gets pissed at me after eating here because I'm often still not hungry at 6pm when it's dinner time for the family. Keep in mind that if you check this place out during the lunch rush, the line will be LONG. I recommend getting here before noon, unless you like standing. The good part is, the line tends to move pretty quick so you won't spend too long waiting but, seating is limited at this time of day so you may get stuck back at the office eating it. \\nWhat more can I say? One of my most visited lunch spots of the past several years...and as a bonus, the owner is nice and tends to remember what regulars get. He'll be serving it up before you can say 'spicy'."},{"name":"Hot Pot Buffet","address":"70 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I went to this place during a cold November evening after seeing a decent movie with someone. \\n\\nMy companion ordered some sort of an orange mango tropical-looking drink, and she said to me it tasted really bad. I took a few sips, and it really did taste funny. It lacked refreshment, tasted like it was hastily made with a variety of powder and bland water. I could barely get past the next few sips. \\n\\nWe were given a sheet of paper, and we checked off the various meats and vegetables that we wanted. For the broth, I got the Mala Spicy variant. I decided to choose that because it was really cold outside and hot pot is supposedly popular in the Sichuan Province of China, which is known for its spiced up foods. My companion got the Chinese Herbal variant. As for the other food, we ordered a lot of lamb, beef, tofu, vegetables, and quite a few clams. We also got some vermicelli and udon noodles. \\n\\nThe vegetables, particularly the tofu, bok choy and watercress were pretty fresh. I also enjoyed the lamb meats but found the beef to be okay. The clams were a little frustrating to eat, so you have to leave the clams inside the broth until the shells open. As for the broth itself, it was probably one of the most spiced up soups I had in a long while. They provide a generous amount of chili peppers inside. Dipping sauces were just decent. The vermicelli and udon noodles were okay as well. \\n\\nOne great advantage is that this place is open until 2 AM, so it's not a bad choice for hot pot after a night out in the city. Service was slightly mediocre, we had to call out the waiters several times for their attention. \\n\\nOverall, I found my dinner not spectacularly good, just so-so, decent, and \\"ma ma dei\\".

In fact, should you mention Thurn's at Carfagna's, (which I have, since I showed up there to pick up a charitable donation for my food pantry and happened to be wearing my Thurn's ball cap at the time,) men with cleavers are likely to tell you that the two just aren't the same. Carfagna's is a grocer, a butcher, a seafood merchant, a wine shop, a deli and a caterer.  Thurn's has a completely different business model, even if, like Carfagna's, they do happen to feature mighty fine meat. The key clue to the difference is in the name...Thurn's \\"Specialty\\" Meats. \\n\\nThurn's makes delicious old-world meat products, using generations-old, tried and true family recipes, in small batches, by hand. When you enter Thurn's, what you don't see is piles of fresh-cut steaks, chops, cutlets, roasts, shoulders, ground burger, loins and filets. Instead, there's made-from scratch fresh and cooked sausages; a vast assortment of \\"tubes\\" and loaves of cured, ground, spiced smoked pork, beef and veal, stuffed into casings of every conceivable shape and size. They create Jerky people flock to them to buy. They smoke cheeses produced elsewhere (to perfection, i might add), along with turkey breasts, salmon and chicken wings. In season, they process deer for area hunters and donate the meat to local food pantries. Their menu is chock full of wursts, jadgers, wiegers inkens and souse. It is authentic, old-world fare, prepared with extreme care. Like at Carfagna's, at Thurn's you'll see Capacolla...except Thurn's actually MAKES theirs.\\n\\nRegulars will delight when a personal favorite (always good) winds up to be an exceptional batch, which the staff eagerly shares with customers whose preferences they know well. It's that kind of human touch that sets Thurn's apart from many meat markets. Even if you've gone there for years, they surprise you and delight in your reaction. It's a gem.\\n\\nI shop at Carfagna's, too. I love the place.  And while it's true that Thurn's is no Carfagna's, their comparison is ludicrous. Try both. Then go back for what each does best.

An opportunity to check out any area bars we weren't familiar with or revisit old friends and take in their specials. Over those days of new experiences at a half dozen local bars, one particular location managed to fall flat on its face. That bar was MoJoe Lounge.\\n\\nOur group's Yelp happy hour for MoJoe started 4pm Sunday. After brunch at Knead and a spin round the North Market, fellow Yelper Michelle K and I ended up at MoJoe early. Being the (momentarily) responsible person I was, I started by grabbing a Joe Cool from the attached Cup O' Joe before moving to a high-top table on the MoJoe side. The patio was almost full, while the inside seating was at about 1/3rd capacity. Michelle planned to get one of the espresso martinis on special for the event. No Yelp fliers were out at any of the MoJoe tables, and it turned out the bar staff didn't even know what the specials were.\\n\\nWe had one major problem: no waiter. And by no waiter, I mean that in the almost hour and a half before our happy hour group got together, we never had anyone come to our table other than one waitress's token visit a half hour in. Two round tables five feet from us had full service, but the guy behind us at another high-top also had none and had to run to the bar to order. I tried to flag down a bald, middle aged bartender passing by who gave me a cursory glance from three feet away, ignored the gesture, and proceeded to walk right back by our table again with no acknowledgment and never tried to inform the rest of the wait staff. Michelle finally ordered her martini at the bar, only to have the bartender try to hand the drink off to another server and be refused because it wasn't that particular server's table. That exchange happened within our range of hearing.\\n\\nSo whose table was it? Who the fuck knows.\\n\\nThe martini itself was a devious concoction. Mild booze mingled with strong coffee flavor and a hint of sweetness, creating a lovely mouth-tingling mix. The iced version ordered by others and sipped through a straw looked even more dangerous.\\n\\nWe switched to another table for the Yelp-related portion of our visit. Eventually our table filled to about a dozen members, with another adjacent table holding a half dozen more. Our single server was in five miles over his head and actually made a point to tell our lovely CM this. At some point a competent ball capped server started aiding him, and eventually the first disappeared entirely, likely off crying in a corner from the stress of actual responsibility. The supplied Yelp event food was good, the smoked salmon reuben-style sandwich standing tall above the bbq pork sliders and veggie wrap. The Yelp special mojito was refreshing on a hot day, but wasn't particularly strong and didn't stand out above any other similar drinks I've had elsewhere. We salivated over the phenomenal looking house chicken tenders and MoJoe spicy fries ordered by adjacent tables, both filling their large plates to the edge of capacity. Michelle finally broke and ordered some of the fries at the counter.\\n\\nNo, we never got them.\\n\\nMojoe's staff seemed ill-prepared for everything. Ill-prepared for a patio full of patrons, for a large Yelp group they knew was coming, even for two thirsty patrons sitting at a side table. I'd hope for better at the German Village location. In the meantime, this one can work through another set of inept waiters before I'd return."},{"name":"Stumptown Sliders","address":"410 SW Oak St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I love Stumptown's breakfast.

Anyone who has been around this location for a while knows that Nino's started as Rosetti's, in the dumpy little building next door to the current location. Rosetti's was the go-to Italian deli in an area with plenty of good Italian food. They made what I feel are THE world-standard Italian (American) subs. Soft roll, tons of top-quality imported cold cuts, and all the right toppings. They expanded over the years and got into catering, eventually building the new building where the business sits now. I forget when Rosetti's then became Uncle Nino's, but after a year or so it was evident that for the most part, everything stayed the same. The new owners did a great job keeping the particulars of the place alive and well, and continued expanding to include more items, more catering and delivery. At this point, I would have been flirting with a 4 or even 5 star review. However, starting in 2013 things slowly began to change a bit. I'm not sure if there are new owners again, but I no longer see the same people working. And unfortunately, it seems like tradition is being lost. There are way fewer quality Italian deli meats in the case. Subs aren't always cut to order, they are assembled from pre-cut slices (heresy, if you ask me!). Also, it doesn't seem like all the employees are on the same page about what goes on the subs, and in what order. This is an admittedly minor detail, but it makes all the difference. Nowadays sometimes the lettuce goes in the bun first, then meats, then other toppings. Sometimes oil and vinegar are put right into the bun, making it soggy. Having been eating at this place for 30+ years, for decades the subs were EXACTLY the same every time. It seems like now they aren't. And it's certainly not the go-to local Italian deli any more - it seems like the focus is more on catering. None of this is BAD, it's just not as good as it used to be. For years I told people from all around the Boston area that the best Italian sub could be found on Park Ave in Revere. I've been letting up on that claim for a while as I see what Uncle Nino's will become, whether it will stick to the details that made them a fixture in Revere or continue a path towards something else, something a bit more generic."},{"name":"Something Fishy","address":"2107 A E Semoran Blvd","city":"Apopka","stars":"4.5","text":"This place does not honor their groupons.

I ordered the oysters fried in panko, another tasty dish where you could taste the freshness. The panko batter was delicate, but fried so the coating was hard and crispy.They weren't as plump or as gooey like the Nola fried oysters I love, but that quality I guess comes from the oysters used and the way they are done in Nola, with only the lightest of batter. these were different, but delicious.

The ropa vieja was tender, but had no flavor whatsoever - it just tasted like meat.  The beans and yellow rice were ok, but again weren't super-flavorful.  The plantains were dry and a bit undercooked - ripe plantains should be slightly carmelized for a bit of crispiness, but soft.  This healthy serving of meh cost $12.\\n\\nBut the biggest travesty was the cortadito (little Cuban coffee).  Look, I know that Jamaica Plain is full of a bunch of health nuts, and anything that wasn't produced organically by a women's collective in a war-torn backwater is evil, but come on people PROPER CUBAN COFFEE SHOULD BE MIXED AND SERVED WITH TERRIFYING AMOUNTS OF SUGAR ALREADY DUMPED IN.  THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS SUGAR-FREE CUBAN COFFEE!!!!  And I don't want to hear any crying about allergies or diabetes: if you want healthy food and sugar-free, soy-based coffee, don't go to a Cuban restaurant!\\n\\nPerhaps I am spoiled after living in Miami for a few years, but honestly this is not complicated cuisine: it should be salty, garlicky, never dry and always CHEAP.  Despite Boston's tragic lack of great Mexican food, and shitty, Yankee-fied BBQ, it IS possible to get good Caribbean food here; I had some of the best fried pork chops with beans and rice I've ever had in my life at a sketchy carry-out in the middle of a public housing complex, so I know it's possible.

The service was slow especially given that we had no one around us at all.  But here is my thought - it is too pricey for casual drop in after work people and too ordinary for a special occasion.  They need to offer more fun bar food items.  And they need to make the main items more interesting.  Roast chicken for $24 - Not break the bank but not so amazing - you will go out of your way to get it.  The lobster mac and cheese is very good and rich.  But again - it needs a better eye on what does well near a Bruins and Celtics practice facility."},{"name":"Hai San Chinese Restaurant","address":"11105 W Colonial Dr","city":"Ocoee","stars":"4.5","text":"This is as good as it gets.

Upon arriving at what seemed to be a barn, driving closer, it was in fact a... you guessed it... old colonial house which has since been converted into a restaurant and bar. The atmosphere there is unlike anything I've experienced but represents New England; it's absolutely authentic and spot on. From the little stove in the dining room to the tiny bathroom featuring old pluming and all of the wooden seats that creak with when you sit down. We totally and immediately felt like we time traveled and that my friends is awesome.\\n\\nUnfortunately though, despite the affordable menu and friendly service, the food was rather dissapointing. The spinach dip was average at best, being served with some near stale chips. The girlfriend didn't like her entree (I can't quite recall what she had) but my plate of spaghetti with meatballs surprisingly decent and the portion was more than generous. \\n\\nAs far as drinks go, they nailed her cosmo and my beer was cold - both were decently priced which was great. All in all, the place, while full of locals, makes for a very unique setting to eat or drink at - it has its charm and we thought it was a neat spot.

Yesterday when we spent the day in Boston we finally bucked up and got the courage to explore the neighborhood. When in Jamaica Plains, we saw several cute looking restaurants that looked good. Before going to Jamaica Plains, my family and I read about El Oriental de Cuba and saw that it sounded good and got a decent rating. When we walked by the restaurant it looked cute and charming so we tried it. \\n\\nWhen you walk in, the restaurant has the old feeling and does not look like anything special. However, it is clean and does not look run-down. The restaurant has a nice charm. Old photographs of Cuba and Cuban postcards are hung all over the wall around the tables. It is filled with local families eating and having a good time. The waiter we had was a friendly and pleasant young man who was very attentive and did not mess up our orders. The service was generally fast, but was slow at times not because the kitchen was backed up but because the staff in the kitchen really care about and take pride in the food they serve. The menu has plenty to choose from and is written in both Spanish and English. The menu consists of classic Cuban specialties such as a vegetarian special plate consisting of rice and beans and your choice of tostones or sweet plantains, which were fabulous, some of the best I have ever had, to a classic Cuban sandwich consisting of melted swiss cheese, ham, and roast pork on a roll with some marinade pressed on a pan. My parents and sister went for the vegetarian plate and loved it and I was adventurous and went for the Cuban sandwich. I never tried a Cuban sandwich and I have to say if you have never tried one before El Oriental de Cuba is the place. It was delicious and tasted so homemade. Also, if you are a finicky eater, you get to add whatever condiments you want on the sandwich such as lettuce, tomato, mustard, or mayo unlike most restaurants that automatically put mayo and mustard on sandwiches. As someone who does not like mayo or mustard, it was perfect for me. Also, try one of their famous tropical fruit shakes, I got the banana one and it was fabulous. It tasted like the one I loved from Cafe Con Leche in New York City. Then, there coffee rocks as well. Try the classic cafe con leche or the espresso. They are bursting with that strong tasty coffee flavor where you feel like your are in heaven.  More importantly, the food is affordable and you get a huge portion that will fill you up. \\n\\nOverall, a great experience. If you are craving basic Cuban/Latin American food this is the place to go. It reminded my family and I of places like this we ate at in New York City. Now, I have a reason to go to Jamaica Plains, to go to this restaurant. Definitely try. You will not regret it."},{"name":"Dots Cafe","address":"2521 SE Clinton St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Eaten here late night and brunch. Waffles are basically donuts. But delicious.

You know...

However, this place could improve dramatically... \\n\\nI will goto the bad first. (1) What the F^&k is the problem with sports bars that think it's ok on a Tuesday night to play music at a volume level that requires you to yell at the person with you?? (2) What is with the secret shopper program? You lost your best bartender ever in Reggie (large black dood that was the friendliest bartender I have encountered in Atlanta. I walked in and before I sat down my wings were ordered and a 23 oz Miller Lite was waiting on me. That's service right there HG Management Arseholes). (3) Improve the menu and STAT. If you're going to try to stake claim to \\"High End\\" sports bar levels, then you gotta have more than 5 total things on a menu that are good. (4) I won't even go into detail on running out draft beer on weekend. That's unacceptable for any Sports Bar in America. Just saying. (5) Finally, your parking sucks. FIX IT! \\n\\nNow to the Good. (1) TV's everywhere. Some Sports Bars do this on the cheap and you are fighting for a good view of Clemson on the one TV they show because the punk arse Ohio State fans choose to take over the bar. Makes me wear a Michigan sweatshirt just to be contrary dammit. (2) The staff has generally been pretty good to me. Maybe its because I'm the dumbass always with a hat backwards an ordering shots wasting a good paycheck all the time. Ehhhh... It was the other guy. (3) Lemon Pepper Wings = Yum! (4) They got two other entrees that are actually THE AWESOME! The Chicken Entree with mashed potatoes, capers and other nonsense. I freebase it. Also, the Ahi Tuna salad is the tits. (5) The patio is a thing of beauty. I'm a patio guy, so I have spent countless hours out there. Whether you choose to get some sun and watch the absolutely breathtaking view of Peachtree St traffic and people lumbering out of Waffle House across the street or just because there's a table of 4 ladies sitting close by. I like it. Oh yeah, they got a covered patio too for bad weather days. Not too shabby I might add. (6) It's stumbling distance from my house. \\n\\nIn conclusion. It's more of a 3.5 star place, but it has tremendous ability to be better. Proper seasoning of foods, getting rid of those atrocious \\"Secret Shoppers\\" who make you lose your best bartenders, and not running out of beer (for the love of all things Holy I'm still pissed about this) will move you into my 4 star rating quickly. \\n\\nDisclaimer: I know I know!

Not too little to make you feel like you just spent way too much on a couple bites of food, but also not too big to where you don't have room for dessert! Both the duck and the beef were cooked perfectly and were juicy and flavorful throughout. \\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered the butterscotch pot de creme with coarse sea salt on top and a thin shortbread cookie on top and a small side of ice cream. This was also delicious and a great end to the meal. But to be honest, I've had other desserts at this price point that have blown me away way more than this one.

Besides having been to and loved the NYC inspiration for this restaurant, The Spotted Pig, and reading/hearing rave reviews here and in the Sentinel, I just can't jump on the bandwagon. I tried SO HARD to love it but me and my dining parter were both very disappointed. I am going to rate it based on this experience, but I am anxious to go back and have a great meal  so I can give more stars. I truly believe based on my experience and the reviews that others give that the case with this restaurant is that people are rating it based on its aspirations as opposed to where it actually is at this point. Sadly this tends to happen in Orlando due to our lack of fine/unique dining.\\n\\nIf you browse through the reviews that have 3 or less stars, you will notice some recurring complaints: overly salty, too oily/fatty, pretentious but not quite cutting it. I found all of this to be true.\\n\\nI ordered a bloody mary while waiting for our table, and they said that the mix was made in-house. I am a bloody mary fanatic and this was very weird tasting :( It seemed like they did too much too it- it was super super thick to the point that I could taste pur√©ed particles going into my mouth and the primary taste was not tomato juice- it was very bitter, bold, and meaty- tasting so I guess maybe worcestershire sauce...? I sent it back with the intention of ordering another of their cocktails but in the end I was afraid of something else being equally \\"creative\\". The pickled veggies that came with it were very tasty though- I could have just eaten a glass full of those with some vodka on them :) \\n\\nWe began the meal with the much-beloved gruyere biscuits, which were pretty good but eerily similar to the biscuits I ate at red lobster as a child. But you can definitely distinguish the taste of gruyere so if you are a fan of that cheese like I am, they're a total treat! The butter (I think it was truffle butter) that came with them was too salty. Next we got the pork belly appetizer, which I believe was $13. Let me just say that I am obsessed with pork belly and order it/ cook it whenever possible... It is a close relative of bacon and therefore I love it/want to marry it. This pork belly was much less crispy and more fatty than is generally considered to be delicious. I believe that it was a contributing factor to both of our persistent nauseous feelings for the remainder of the night. That being said, the sauce on it and the grape/ cucumber mixture on the top was delicious and had the belly been more crispy would have perfectly balanced the richness and fattiness. As it was, I still plowed through 3/4 of the dish because still... It's pork belly :) \\n\\nFor entrees we ordered the steak frites, a flat iron steak with the restaurant's signature fries served in a beer glass, and the sheep's milk ricotta gnudi. This is where everything pretty much fell apart and we were left staring at each other in complete embarrassment at being \\"those people\\" that send everything back....\\n\\nI will say that I found the steak to be perfectly fine, nothing fabulous but then again it's just a flat iron steak... But it came out undercooked and even after they brought it back after searing it more, it was just slightly rubbery. I would've just eaten it and not said anything, but it ended up being sent back. I concur with the many people who have said that the fries are good but waaayyyy too salty. I have no idea why they would put so much salt, a chef should know the difference between deliberate saltiness that lends itself to the dish and just plain too much... \\n\\nThe gnudi dish was so so disappointing- totally ruined by greasiness. The gnudi themselves were what was greasy- the waitress said that they were \\"lightly seared, not deep fried...\\", but they definitely looked/tasted deep fried. The oil or butter totally took over what seemed like it would've been a very pleasant ricotta flavor had the pasta been more delicately prepared. The sauce in the dish was extremely good- again, overly salty, but not so much that the sauce was ruined. It was rich, earthy, and buttery and had morrell mushrooms, corn, and onions and was just delicious. I tried to drench the gnudi in this but in the end I could not even eat an entire one out of the three on the plate and ended up sending that back as well :(  \\n\\nAs far as those complaining about the staff and the pricing, I believe that they were both what you would/should expect at a restaurant of this caliber. Because despite them obviously being a little below the bar that they set for themselves, they are still better than 98% of restaurants in Winter Park. The ingredients are fresh and superior tasting and the concept is something new to this area- which is refreshing! \\n\\nCan't wait to give it another try."},{"name":"El Oriental De Cuba","address":"416 Centre St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"4","text":"Overrated !!!!!

The bisque was presented in a unique way -- a small scoop of crabmeat in the soup plate, and the bisque poured from a small pitcher over the meat.  The sea scallops were good, and were served with a creamy lobster risotto, but with no vegetable side.  I really wish there had been a vegetable to contrast to the richness of the risotto.  The chocolate cake was excellent, but needed vanilla ice cream to help cut through the richness (a berry flavored ice cream was served with it).  I was also a little sad when they took away the sourdough (half a loaf was left) and didn't offer to box it up (I saw a lot of half-eaten loaves being taken away... what a waste!).  \\n\\nThe food wasn't bad by any measure, but I wasn't blown away by any of it -- and I would expect any restaurant participating in the Restaurant Week promotion would want to showcase their best dishes in order to encourage return visits.

My friend and I ordered off the way back menu they have plates from $12-14 that comes with a large portions of good food. Drinks I had a weak scorpion bowl for one and they had a mai tai with our meal.\\nAfter the meal we sat in the cool room so we could see the band.  I loved them.  The music is music you would hear on the radio top 40ish sprinkled with old school top 40 hits and some salsa.  FYI the patrons on the dance floor are way over 40 and adorable.

Rooms surround a 10-story central atrium that houses 3 restaurants/lounges, a Starbucks and FedEx.  Check-in was efficient and thoughtful - I was granted an upgrade to a 1 bedroom suite as an Elite member.  The room was comfortable and modern.  The only downside (and one of just a few reasons I did not give this property 5 stars) is that \\"connecting doors\\" are very thin - you can clearly hear people in adjoining rooms.  I used earplugs to sleep, which worked well.   The Starbucks is a genuine store and has plenty of staff and seating.  We did not eat on property other than breakfast one day - via room service.  The meal arrived right on schedule and was perfectly prepared; however, the coffee was bitter.   I used the fitness center and was very happy with its size (6 treadmills, 5 ellipticals, I think) and a good selection of free weights and machines.  We had drinks at MIST in the evening and were very, very impressed with our server, Vivianna, who went out of her way to accommodate a special drink request.  Ok, here are a few areas where they fell a little short:  $25 resort fee is, in my opinion, excessive when 1) it was 35 - 50 degrees outside - way too cold for pool/hot tub and 2) even still, I did not see anything at this hotel that was extraordinary (e.g. river pool, wave pool, tennis, etc.  Perhaps it was there, but again, it was too cold to go outside.)  Second, check-out was awkward bordering on rude.  I went down around 7:30 to grab coffees and then walked over and requested to \\"check out\\" as I had hoped to just walk directly from our room to the car.  The front desk clerk was the only person there, and I was the only guest.  She looked at me and said the cards would be deactivated and inquired if I needed access to my room (a fair and good question).  Here is where it went off the rails: I said no, that is ok, my wife is in the room, so she will let me in, whereupon she said, \\"well, then you CANNOT check out.\\"   I was completely perplexed by this response and asked why not?  I travel all the time and check out and then go grab my bags...she replied that as long as someone was in the room, I could NOT check out.  I then asked her to clarify if that meant I had to bring my wife and all our luggage down before I could check out, and she said (in a brusque tone)  - \\"if you want to\\".  I said I would prefer not to do that but do I have a choice?  I added that all I wanted was to get my bill.  She replied that she could CLOSE OUT my account and give me the bill but reiterated that I could NOT check out until my wife and I left the room.  What?  Does that mean I have to come back again?  To which she reluctantly said \\"no\\".  Sheesh - why the hard time??  It should have been clear - even if I was using the wrong terminology - that what I really wanted was to get my bill so I could simply depart from my room to my car!!"},{"name":"QDOBA Mexican Eats","address":"185 Linden St","city":"Wellesley","stars":"3","text":"Solid.

After about 10-15 minutes our meals arrived. I joked with my wife that I had never seen such a large yolk on the egg. Anyway the Eggs Benedict were the best that we both have ever eaten. The whites were cooked perfectly and the yolks nice and runny. The Bernaise sauce was absolutely to due for and plentiful. The potatoes were cooked to perfection. The service was great.

I give it four stars because the drinks are pretty good but the food can be overpriced for what they serve. \\n\\nI have been there twice; once to just see how it is and the second time to meet a friend to watch a football game. If you want to go here just to eat and it's not on Pride, the place is empty. My first time wasn't on Pride and there were literally four people in there (that included myself and a worker). On Pride however, everyone will be sitting outside (I don't why but they can never fill up their entire restaurant) and it's a very pleasant atmosphere. The deck is usually full on Pride.\\n\\nNOW, If you want to watch a football game on the screens inside, it'll be packed, but not to the point where you're cheek to cheek so it's okay. There aren't really any girls in there, if they are in there, it's because they are with their manly gay men friends or they trickle in off to the side so they don't get hit on. When I went, I was with my male friend and I swear he got hit on at least five times by different  men. That'll most likely happen to you if you are a man in this place. Just get ready...I'm warning you now.\\n\\nThe food: they don't have anything major in this place. My first time going here, I spent 13 bucks on a sandwich. Yeah I wasn't pleased. The next time I spent about 8 bucks on six wings; better but it was still a lot compared to other places I've been to. The drinks are pretty fairly priced; I was good with a big pitcher of beer which I got about 5 drinks out of. Good stuff indeed.\\n\\nAgain I do like Joe's On Juniper. It can be a little touchy feely but if you go with friends, you should have a good time...unless someone hits on them and they completely ditch you. Then it may not be so great.

But, I don't much care about their authenticity or lack there of cause either way it's damn good food.  Cuban food would not, at first glance, be very vegetarian friendly (why is pork such a mainstay of the Caribbean/Latin American world?  and why is it in everything?) but El Oriental is an excellent choice for my non-pork eating self.  I always get the vegetarian platter (black beans, maduros) and a side of fried yucca.  It's simple fare, but I'm a sucker for beans and rice.  \\n\\nEl Oriental also delivers for those of us lucky enough to live in JP (just not on Sunday).  The one problem: although the food is excellent the service is occasionally far from it.  If you call in an order to pick-up and they say 20 minutes you can expect to wait quite a bit longer.  If you call and order deliver and they say 20 minutes you can expect 40-45.  And the wait staff can be pretty hit or miss if you are dining in the restaurant.

We arrived last Saturday for brunch not really knowing what to expect.  First of all, our party was ushered to a private table outside on the patio.  The temperature was variable, and some of our group was cold.  Our fantastic waitress, Dana, brought us blankets - what other restaurant does that?  Not a 5 star establishment.  \\n\\nSpeaking of Dana - she was arguably the best waitress I've had in Austin.  She really embodied what I perceive is the values of Suerte: sugar, spice, and everything nice.  Our group of 12 had some extravagant requests - the requests were understood, repeated to ensure proper delivery, and brought to us in a timely manner.\\n\\nOur group got the brunch special menu.  When we sat down, we were very confused as we perceived a lack of edible items.  That was not the case whatsoever.  The items on the brunch menu were brought out over the course of 2 hours, individually, family style.  I feel like I'd being doing a disservice to only use the word phenomenal to describe these plates.  Look at the pictures!  5 stars.\\n\\nAnyways, to end, Dana and Suerte pleasantly relieved our hunger, made us feel welcomed, and delivered a very pleasant experience.

And when you get up to use the restroom, they should fold your napkin for you.  :)  Their recommendations also need to be flawless.\\n\\nFood:  You need to be satisfied knowing that it can not be done better when that first bite hits your lips.  Dying is a little less scary after experiencing this.\\n\\nWine List:  It doesn't HAVE to be extensive (but it helps) but it does HAVE to be varied, reasonably priced, (which is the key....I don't mind dropping good money for good wine, but a 400% markup can be tough to swallow.  I'm looking at you Jean George.)  and cannot under any circumstances contain generic crap.\\n\\nAmbiance:  For the most part I give some places some slack if they don't accomplish this.....it's Boston.

First of all, I agree with other reviewers that it is LOUD in there...would not have been an issue for us since we were getting our food to go, BUT it did make it very, very, very difficult to ask questions of the employee behind the counter or hear her answers. She was very pleasant and answered questions (although...see above...we had to pretty much shout our questions several times and say \\"What??\\" several times). It is small, but clean and neat. They have no take-out menus (\\"we have ordered some\\"). We mentioned to her that we had tried to call about a half dozen times to place our order in advance, but that no one had answered the phone. We confirmed the phone number with her. While we were talking, we realized their phone was ringing...but it was apparently set to low, so it could barely be heard over the t.v. I wonder how much business they lose because people think they aren't open?? That's what we thought, but decided to take the drive anyway. The menu is very small, which I kinda like...if you do something well, just do it! Don't have a menu with 1,000 items all done half-ass. Anyway, you are limited to curry chicken, jerk chicken, oxtail, goat, and fish, plus a myriad of veggies. I am not a huge curry fan and planned on getting the jerk chicken...but they didn't have any. Just didn't make any that day. So I got the curry chicken combo, as did my friend. We asked if they would take our scoutmob coupon even though it said dine-in only and they said \\"sure,\\" which was very nice of them. We also ordered one spinach pie. The combo included rice, 4 plantain slices, yellow cabbage and chicken. There were huge amounts of the rice and cabbage, but 3 small pieces of chicken. Two pieces were actually some part of the chicken that had been hacked in half (very small) and because they had been cut through the bone, there were little crunchy bone pieces. I put them aside. The third piece was a large chicken thigh. It was tender and moist and delicious...I wish the other two pieces had been similar as I wanted more! The rice, cabbage and plantains were perfection. The spinach pie was really good also...especially for the $2 price tag. The combo was just shy of $10. All in all, the food was delicious, but I agree that the meat portions are small, although the veggie portions are large, and it is way too loud.

Bathroom was clean, though I will say that they had only one single-use bathroom for each gender, so there was a bit of a wait when I went there. Outside and indoor seating available. The main dining hall is a single large room with high ceilings. The noise-level is somewhat exacerbated by the bar being in the main dining area. However, the 4-Points neighborhood tends to have well-behaved patrons. Dinner for 2 people (no alcohol) with 2 entrees and 1 appetizer was around $35 before gratuity.

The menu suggested a red wine to be paired with the cheese - dreadful recommendation as one of the cheeses was a soft, fatty blue cheese.  Instead, I had a glass of a Northwest sparkling wine which was superb with all of the cheeses.\\n\\nI had the cedar plank Salmon as the entree.  It was memorable as it was prepared perfectly to suit my taste.  There was the hint of smokiness you expect with the cedar plank, the exterior of the fish lightly browned and the interior nearly raw - as I requested.  Easily the best piece of salmon I've ever enjoyed.  I paired the salmon with a \\"organic, sustainable...\\" Pinot Noir.  Looking back, I'd have preferred a less sustainable, better quality Pinot...\\n\\nMy daughter, the vegetarian, raved about the mushroom soup.  I had a taste and it was very good.  The roasted shitakke mushroom pieces on the top were smokey and reminded me of bacon.  She followed the soup with a pasta and veggie entree.\\n\\nNote to Disney:  Feel free to add more vegetarian selections.

My brother got the frenchie - which by the way was in the main area but was actually an appetizer so she came back to tell him it was small and he ordered the polenta. The frenchie was raw oysters (didn't specify that on the menu). The polenta was grey and seemed like it had been sitting on the plate for hours as it had hardened a bit.

It's hard to believe that such a food mecca like Portland is still missing a great KFC place. So I rolled up my sleeves and immediately headed over only to be met with nothing but sheer, utter disappointment.\\n\\nFirst of all, the wings are frigging' tiny. They're covered in batter, so you think that they're normal sized wings until you take a bite. Then you realize that the wing makeup is about 50% batter. You're literally eating nothing but 50% batter with each bite. Don't get me wrong, I love fried chicken batter -- it's normally what I go for first. But this time around, I was unimpressed. It didn't help that underneath the batter, you could tell that the meat quality was poor -- barely any, as well as incredibly dry and tasteless. Ugh.\\n\\nAnd now for the special sauces? I read up on this place, and I should have known -- it's just another white guy's take on Asian food. Their original sauce tasted like a less vinegary buffalo sauce with ginger tossed in. It was like that time when I went to Boke Bowl and was extraordinarily disappointed by their \\"take\\" on KFC. I'm all about fusion, and don't necessarily believe authenticity is the final law of the land... but in Basa Basa and Boke Bowl's case, it seems like these guys haven't ever had real KFC. It seems like they just kinda imagined what it would taste like, and came up with what they did. \\n\\nTerrible. \\n\\nI could go on... for instance, what's going on with the macaroni salad side? The lack of pickled daikon? But I think you get the gist. The only reason why I gave this place 2 stars instead of 1 is because their decor was pretty swank, the place was clean, and the service was speedy. But the food?

But, the service on my second visit is what made The Pig my new favorite hot spot.  When my family sent me to get take-out, I was apprehensive that this upscale, yet casual, restaurant would accommodate to-go orders.  When I arrived the hostess was happy to take my order and she deferred me to a nearby waiter when she wasn't sure how to answer some of my questions about the menu items.  The waiter patiently answered my slew of questions and really saved the day when he told me the fish I was ordering for my mom was served medium rare.  My mom hates raw fish, so instead I ordered the Roasted Pacific Rainbow Runner which she loved.  While I waited for the food, I sat at the bar and ordered a beer.  Although they don't serve my favorite, Blue Moon, the bartender offered a similar selection that I liked even better...and it was on the house.

No $8 Guinness's here like so many other places. \\n\\nAnd the food, I'm not a big fan of their Guinness stew, even though I love stew, but I am enamored with their Irish Breakfast and their yorkies. The yorkies are stuffed with roast beef and come with horseradish mayo and au jus. That's right, your mouth just started watering. And as for their breakfast, it's amazing! It's only $10 and you get eggs, back bacon, sausage, toast, beans, and fried onions.

Everything about this meal just made me want to come back and try everything on the menu.\\nMy Pork Belly Sandwich arrives. The french baguette was perfectly toasted, crunchy and flakey but chewy and soft at the same time. It came with kimchi styled, pickled vegetables, topped with chopped cilantro and scallions. But the pork belly. Oh goodness the pork belly. Slow cooked for hours then flash fried to finish it off with a crispy skin and tender, gelatinous finish to the fatty parts. Perfect.\\nThere was now a problem. I didn't want to share anymore. Don't get me wrong, the prime rib sandwich was nothing short of spectacular either, but this, THIS was the holy grail. I offered only one bite in exchange for the lesser but it only gave my pork belly that much more contrast of how awesome it really was.\\n\\nOverall, I had one of the best lunches of my life for a mere 12 bucks.

Not only is it on tap (unlike many places that serve it from a can) but they use the proper pour method. It may be the pour or some other magical secret known only to them, but I've never tasted Guinness (and i have a pint of it at pretty much every bar that i go to) as good as at Fox's. On top of the black stuff, they also pour Smithwick's and Harp, 2 more fantastic Irish brews. On top of the straight beers, they do mixed beers as well, all of which are delicious and poured with the proper separation of beverages in the glass.\\n\\nOn to the food. \\n\\nJohnny Fox's used to have a rather extensive food menu, but it was recently revamped and downsized. In this change they removed one of my absolute FAVORITE dishes: the Irish Patchos. The dish is essentially nachos but with slices of potato instead of tortilla chips, topped with cheese, green onion, tomato, black olives and jalapenos; certainly big enough to feed two people.  They held on to the Guinness burger and the Guinness and beef stew, both of which are superb. My final item that tops the food list are the Irish spring rolls.

The Basil-lemondrop was probably the best thing about the meal but was served without a sugar rim.  This may seem nitpicky, but it was basically foreshadowing our evening meal.  \\n\\nThe antipasti platter was ok, the prosciutto was very good, and one of the 2 cheeses was good.  The other cheese they served was a harder cheese, like a romano, that should not be on a cheese plate.  They also gave me 2 pieces, one of which was the rind.  The salami on the plate was not very good, but that may have been personal taste.  What was most telling was the fact that there was nothing sweet served with the plate.  Every other restaurant, both italian and french, when you serve a cheese or a cheese and meat plate, you have something sweet on the plate to help palate all the heavy fat and salt in the food.  Even some dried apricots or honey.  Nothing fancy.\\n\\nMy dining companion ordered the \\"salty chicken\\" (Pollo Crocante) for her dinner, which was the whole reason we came.

There's a great variety of good quality foods on the menu, tons of large TVs throughout the restaurant, and a large bar area for you bar-lovers.\\n\\nI normally order the Cajun chicken pasta, but seeing as I had just made spaghetti the night before, I opted to try the ossobuco. It did not disappoint. The pork was the perfect combo of juicy, tender, and crispy. I did have to ask for additional sauce/gravy. The mashed potatoes were yummy too. The steamed mixed veggies...not sure what there is to say really than they stayed true to the description. Anyway, as normal, the food was great.\\n\\nThe service at this location is where they lose a star (or half star) for me...not because they weren't friendly because they were, but because it was extremely slow. So slow our stomachs were touching our backs. So slow that when our server finally returned to our table, he was shocked and apologized for being missing for so long and said \\"I'm going to yell at the kitchen because your food shouldn't be taking so long.\\" Mind you this was all unprompted.

For $35 per adult prix fixe, you expect more. \\n\\nThe negative experience began when we had to wait way too long at the unattended hostess stand to be seated for our 12 noon reservation. (We were first in a long line of unhappy looking patrons.)  Noon should've been a good time because it was the start of brunch service, but it also seemed to be the checkout time for all the folks who'd stayed Sat. nite at the Intercontinental Hotel, where Miel is located. Anyway, a smart restaurant would've planned ahead and scheduled reservations accordingly. But basically, nothing about the service or management at Miel was smart.\\n\\nAfter we were seated, our waiter took way too long to appear, although he was apologetic saying \\"everyone showed up at once.\\" Well, OK, but that doesn't really explain the amateurish behavior of other staff members who, at one point, attempted to deliver to our table exact duplicates of the orders we had all just finished consuming!  Or the guy (not our server) who put a crepe down in front of me, and before I could decide whether it was the one I'd ordered, just as quickly whisked it away with only some indecipherable mumbled remark.

We placed an order for the Risotto (appetizer), Steak Frites and Pork Porterhouse (all placed at the same time). The Risotto took quite a long time to come, but was delicious and we weren't too concerned about the wait because we were enjoying ourselves. \\n\\nWe then waited another 30 or so minutes for our entree's. Upon taking her first bite, my girlfriend told me hers was not warm. I tasted it, and it was delicious, but not warm at all. We then tried the pork, which was even cooler. No one attempted to ask how our food was for at least five minutes, at which point (what appeared to be a manager) came over to check on us. It was eye-opening that he checked on us, but no other table in the dining room while we were there... My assumption is he knew our food was cold.\\n\\nWe advised both dishes were very tasty, but that they came out cold. He said, \\"we usually do a better job\\", spoke to the server who finally arrived, and left. He did not offer to warm them, make new plates, comp a drink, or anything. We both ate about half of our entrees (in favor of taking the rest home to heat it), placed our silverware in the proper position and waited for probably 10 minutes until our server walked by and dropped off a desert menu, not even saying a word or stopping.

The up selling by our waiter was OUT OF CONTROL. Everything is really affordable but to compensate and profit, they try to up sell you on everything. And they pack diners in like sardines so you are at small tables with 10 or 15 different plates. Stupid. What I actually resented outright was the way they serve you. Once seated, your waiter comes over to settle and up sell you, then he shows you a plastic card that looks like a credit card. If you want his/her attention again, you, the customer, are supposed to clip it into the top of the condiment organizer and then, if and when your waiter actually sees this in the crowded restaurant, s/he will come back over and deal with your issue.

I also ordered the Nacho Mama. It's a monster plate of nachos covered in chicken, cheese, pico, sour cream, guac, etc. I didn't like that the melted queso pretty much soaked the chips. I like my nacho chips to be crunchy. These were not. The people I was with had the French dip, a burger, and a fried chicken salad. All said they enjoyed it. So maybe it's just me. It's worth a try."},{"name":"Hash It Out","address":"7316 N Lombard","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Went there for breakfast a week or two ago because the owners swung by with a menu to my place of work.

In fact, I am quite surprised it is labeled a Hyatt Regency and not their higher end lines Grand or Park Hyatt. The rooms are spacious and more upscale than your regular four star Hiltons, Marriotts etc. Bathrooms have a built-in tv in the mirror, so right there it is putting you on notice that it wants to be in company of Four Season and Hitz Carlton properties, and in my opinion it is not too far from that objective. The travel booking site I used rated this hotel 4.5 star, and I think that is an accurate rating. The service is excellent, with plenty of staff to meet all your needs. The fitness center is outstanding, and they will even bring a set of free weights to your room upon request and free of charge. Nice touch. The hotel has numerous pools, too many to count. The one I used was almost of olympic size, heated and  just awesome. My intention was to give an excellent online rating for this hotel until I ordered room service, a simple pizza. What it was delivered was a disgusting pie about 90% dough and 10% toppings. The quality of the meager toppings, cheese, olives, mushrooms, and sausage was abysmal, like they procured it from a dollar store. Then I felt sick afterwards. You have to try very hard to mess up a pizza, but the Hyatt Regency Orlando manage to do it. Ordering their in room dining marred my up until flawless experience, thus my average rating. My advice is to stay at this property but steer well clear from their in-room dining which is not in line with this otherwise classy hotel."},{"name":"Oz.

So why two stars? Here's the deal...\\n\\nIf you are in need of comfort food, but would rather not resort to the pasta route, then Floramo's is a good place to check out. I've been there a couple times, always on overcast, though not rainy, days, to get some sort of poultry with salad and rice pilaf (that's a funny word). Up until today, I'd only had their chicken, which I think is really dry and kind of stringy. Today I got turkey tips, a pleasant change, but still a little dry. Not as stringy, so that's cool. The rice and salad mix is pretty incredible. But as far as the meat goes? If you can do without, then just get rice and salad.\\n\\nI always feel kind of crummy after I eat there. It's not like I'm rushing to the bathroom or anything, but I just feel like I weigh a lot more than I do. That's not really fun. I'm insecure enough as it is, I don't need a deli making me feel worse about myself.\\n\\nAnother thing about Floramo's is that it's not the most welcoming atmosphere. It's really dark with a cafeteria style set up, and the people behind the counter totally rush you. They don't seem to enjoy it very much when you wait around and stare at the menu. No, it's much better to stay on their good side, order quickly and pay up. You don't want to mess with these people, or so it seems.\\n\\nDrink selection? Weak. I didn't realize this was so important to me until now.\\n\\nSo, to sum up, Floramo's is totally fine is you're already feeling bloated and just need some comfort food sans dry poultry. The rice is delicious, the dressing is good, but it's nothing you can't make at home where it's cozier, cheaper and where you can eat in your pajamas without being judged."},{"name":"Granny's Tacos","address":"1401 E 7th St","city":"Austin","stars":"5","text":"Tacos are so delicious and fresh.

Long. Pointless. Lines - for food that isn't much better than what everyone else is serving in Portland.  I don't even remember the food I ate - it was that forgettable.

I've come here right as they open (very short line) and the food isn't at all memorable.  But sit for an hour on a bench outside waiting for service - and ANYTHING you get is awesome.

And fried potatoes - do you know how easy that is to make?  Toss some parsly on it. Bam.\\n\\nI guess people just don't cook enough to realize that this is something ANYONE can whip-up in your own kitchen with minimal effort for less than $1 in 15 minutes.  Pancakes, hasbrowns, eggs, toast - I mean really?  You'll wait 2 hours for a minimum wage HS dropout to whip these up for you?

Or I spend the time talking with friends inside at a booth - not fighting for an opportunity to sit freezing outside on a wooden bench still damp with dew while I wait for an hour for someone to call my name.

Hip is all that keeps this place busy too - its certainly not the food/service/dining experience.\\n\\nOn the actual review side - service staff was very friendly and decent last few times I went for breakfast - which is their forte.

It wasn't too busy on a Thursday night, but there were a couple of larger (+7) groups there, the DJ was spinning some of our high school hiphop dance hits (although it was a bit too loud, we managed) \\n\\nThe discount voucher provided us with beer samples, and two appy's which we went for onion rings, poutine, and bitter brown and blonde beer. I can't vouch for the alcohol, but according to one of my trusted beer aficionados said the blonde was nice, but the bitter brown was potable but preferred the other. We also then ordered burgers which I decided to go for a Veggie Burger as I haven't had one in forever. Your option is fries or salad, and I decided to opt for healthy Mesclun Salad.  \\n\\nI'll admit that the poutine was ok, gravy was a flavourful but it was fairly salty tasting. It's nothing like a poutine in Qu√©bec but after it's description, you should't be expecting that.  Onion rings were great. The most surprising thing for me was their Veggie Burger.  I admit that after going back to the menu and rereading the description I should have known, but I think my eyes glazed over the fact it had edamame in it. This was a very different tasting veggie burger than what I am accustomed to completely.  I liked their daring edge on it, it gives a completely different texture and flavour for veggies to try. It was a bit too buttery tasting for me, and I really had to concentrate on not thinking about the edamame (I have a huge issue with eating things that are small, green, round and not a piece of candy - don't ask, but it just bothers me highly - not the restaurants fault).  It was very good, I liked the brioche bun too, it was not soggy at all or oversauced.\\n\\nAmbience, as I said before there is a DJ, booths are comfortable, It had a cool inside with black knives decor on one side of the restaurant, and we also enjoyed the knives aimed at the cow design on the other wall.

It has advantages over the original: parking, space, access; they may even have superior staff. The bartender working the early happy hour shift was great. It was he, with hardy passion ( justified after taking my first bite,) who recommended the French dip, his fav of his joints sandwiches. He was very welcoming, garrulous, and friendly--so friendly I scanned my memory if I had met him before. \\n\\nThe inside isn't too terribly far from conventional. They've gutted the old Starbuck turned failed Graffiti Burger there beside the once Giant Eagle soon to be a hispter Odd Lots on West Fifth. Lots of earth reds and darkness. Designs of store icon. Gastropub effects. LOTS more space than the original floating outside Goodale Park. A nice atmosphere for a neighborhood pub. Black fenced in patio with cover. The 70s cheep architectural surroundings makes the scenery rather weak but this is outside Press' control.    \\n\\nOf course it has a nice beer selection of a crafts on tap, the local connection is strong. Four Strings' satyr-duel crossing machinehead icon hovers above Press' on the fence drapped banner at the entrance. Several other local ales, for us apostles of hoppy fun, were on tap the Friday I came. \\n\\nThe Friday Special number one, as I showered with love above, is a must for those still enamored with beef. Mouth melting prime rib with a lovely au jus dip between good bread. Dressed with nothing but flavorful coby cheese and horseradish majo--not too spicy to cut down the prime's tastee thickness. Chop into halves, this seemingly thin sandwich is stuffed more than it seems. ( $12 with side) And oh, to match the greatness of this sandwich, the wedge fries are divine, thick, perfect.\\n\\nI also had a six of wings, buffalo dressed. ($8) Good, not great. The buffalo sauce was just hot enough for buffalo. It's the weak end of their spiciness, so for those that welcome the acidic tongue and lip burn of heat, this maybe a place to check out. \\n\\nUnderrated IMHO. Press on Fifth is to be check out.

I am a \\"foodie\\" and pride myself on knowing good food and great service; I've had some wonderful dining experiences throughout metro Atlanta.  Tonight, I dined with a group of friends who get together throughout the year to celebrate birthdays and other events and we travel throughout metro Atlanta to dine at different restaurants.  Needless to say, we're all frequent diners.  None of us were prepared for the comment that the server made after we paid the check.  He brought the tip back to the table to explain to us that the bill was $332 and we didn't leave enough tip.  Yes, we were in shock!  A mediocre dining experience deserves a mediocre tip. None of us will ever dine again at Alfredo's Italian Restaurant and I'm letting all of my friends know about the awful dining experience we had tonight."},{"name":"Jack's Pizza & Wings","address":"676 Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I first visited Jack's last year with one of my co-workers and it was love at first sight. It's one of those super-eclectic, vibed-out, grungy restaurants/bars that plays awesome music and has a diverse staff. We sat on the patio, where I started with a \\"hot-n-cold\\" and a few cocktails. The drinks are affordable and the pizza menu is very creative. From the Soul Food pizza to the Big Mama, every slice is a must-try. I'm sort of a plain jane so I got a slice of pepperoni with jalape√±os and 5 hot, lemon pepper, strawberry wings. Life was served. The only thing that sucks is that they're only open 4 days out of the week!

There would be a beefy guy inside the station chomping on a cigar and he was invariably named Al, Dutch, Duke, Lou, or Monty. The soda was out of a vending machine that would remove two fingers above the knuckle if you didn't pull the bottle - that's right, a bottle - out in just the perfect dispensing order. The snacks were twofold a pack of Tom's Rye-Chee or Tom's Peanut Butter. Two for a quarter. Finally, you would go into the bathroom and there would be a pink disc at the bottom of the urinal. It had such an overwhelming smell mainly to shock your nostrils so you could not smell the other odors created by missed trajectories of the last guy to come in.

(Barwares just opened up behind the restaurant, same menu, bigger warmer space with great seating options in and out.   We sat outdoors at one of five or six nice tables off the main street and well landscaped for a city setting.)\\n\\nI have eaten here three times and the food is creative and delicious.   The ambiance is comfortable especially now that they have opened Barwares, and provides a mix of casual and chic, but i held off on a fifth star because the quality of the space is outpaced by the quality of the food.  The chef is very talented and the staff engaged.  Evelyn must have been there on a bad night because I haven't had a dish I didn't think was spiced correctly and interesting.   Last night we tried the six minute egg on the 'snacks' menu as a starter, and it was perfectly cooked and woke our palate up with a splash of hot mustard.   With it we each had a cocktail.   In my opinion, where many of the local restaurants trying to get into the cocktail culture make the same drinks and they are all too sweet (there are exceptions yes), Smallwares gets it right.  They have a creative option for each of the serious liquors, eg. \\"The Vodka\\" and \\"The Tequila.\\"  I loved \\"The Vodka\\" last night, which included fresh lime, Benedictine and bitters straight up and icy, and they used my favorite big rock in \\"The Tequila,\\" which my husband ordered.  We split the oysters in fish sauce on a bed of wakame, the salmon tartare, a green salad and the asian style flatiron steak.  The salmon tartare was a perfect example of this chef's skill at taking something that is being done all over town (and in many other cities) and raising the bar and the level.  Instead of the usual mix of avocado, crab and salmon chopped in mid size dice and served in a tuna can size portion, the portion was small, the salmon was diced fine and mixed with even finer dice of apple, subtle to taste but a very nice mix with a slight pepperiness in the sauce.

Moreover, when I tried to order the wine the waitress expressed unease at our table's level of tipsiness.

Coming from the Yukon, our \\"Chinese\\" food choices tend to vary from beef and broccoli to ginger beef.\\n\\nI was basically in shock from the amazing extensive menu choices. Unfortunately, I only had a chance for one visit, so I had to limit my purchases. But wow, were they ever good!\\n\\n1) Ancient Boiled Chili Beef: I had been waiting to try this for years, since reading about it in Fuschia Dunlop's \\"Land of Plenty\\". This was one of the most delicious dishes I've ever eaten. The beef was juicy, slippery, and almost melted in my mouth. The broth was filled with intense flavours, greens, and lots of garlic. It was not as spicy as I expected (though I admit, I am addicted to chilies), but the flavour more than made up for it. One big surprise though: This meal could easily serve four people if they had rice to go with it. Big, big bowl of awesomeness!\\n\\n2) Steamed shrimp, scallop and pork soup dumplings: I had only heard of XLB a few weeks before I got to visit, and I was super-excited to try them. I love that they had instructions on how to eat them. The flavour was worlds beyond any dumplings I've tasted in the past (though most of my dumpling experience is from grocery store freezer aisle). The broth inside was delicious, and the meat and dumpling wrapper were addictive. \\n\\nThe experience: So many people! So busy! But they actually got me through pretty quick, despite a small hiccup where I was waiting for about 15 minutes, before I realized people were having their names put down on a wait list. Nobody let me know I had to do this, so I ended up waiting longer than I would have if they had come to me when I first came in. \\n\\nEither way, this seems like a very popular place in town. \\n\\nThe verdict:\\n\\nIf I lived closer, I would eat here as often as possible, in the hopes of trying everything on the amazingly extensive menu.

Pork belly us easy to over cook and make chewy, which would be hard to eat in a taco. However the pork belly here is pretty on point and cooked ideally.

Though I am not sure this dish felt like al pastor. It wasn't cooked on a rotisserie for sure. No char.

So first, the bartender tells us the kitchen closes soon so we fired off two tacos...he is cold and angry, visibly upset we walked in. Then he hands us a tab and I say \\"oh can we not get a drink?\\" He says, I was just doing last call. Confused I say \\"so does that mean we can or cannot have a drink?\\" He ROLLS his eyes and says yes. (The couple sitting next to us saw this and when the bartender walked away they said \\"jeez whats his deal?\\") Makes us a paloma and the cocktail with gin & st. Germain (switches them when he hands them to us so we started drinking wrong drinks). Buttttt the drinks were SO delicious!!! Tacos came out quick and were absolutely delicious too, thanks kitchen! He came back with an adjusted tab, didn't ask if we were enjoying, didn't actually say a word. He was closing/cleaning, it was 12:15, we paid and he didn't say thanks or anything just grabbed the checkbook off the bar and walked away. I felt that this deserved a review because like I said, I do all of the above for a living and would NEVER make guests feel so incredibly unwelcome, no matter what time it was or how large their tab was. The only reason that I gave any stars is because the drinks were very well made, the food was on point and I know it's a new location #growingpains. Hopefully he can take his attitude somewhere else because Bartaco has a great vibe and he does not fit in. (We all have bad days and we all wanna go home at closing time.

For a trip to Boston, I booked a garden view room and requested a high floor so I could relieve my college experience (my dorm room was at Six Arlington, just a few doors down...my digs then were not so classy but the location was/is killer). \\n\\nService was hit or miss - details  below.\\n\\nIt looks and feels like when Taj bought the property they didn't have the cash to or perhaps just didn't bother to do some basic upgrades.

Perhaps it takes more to impress me now. Nice, but not breathtaking. Also, and this is a bit disappointing, the bedding is more comfortable at a lower level Westin. Granted, that Heavenly bed is heavenly...but this is supposed to be a superior class hotel. What was most disappointing though was the check in. They have  small desk and it was just chaos. Rooms were not ready, several women were freaking out because it was 4pm, no rooms were ready, and they had to get ready for a wedding by 5pm. I finally got into my room around 4:30 pm.  It was not the Garden View room I was told (on the 11th floor) but rather a city view. That was all they had, so I took it. But the desk person kind of gave me grief when I told her to correct my rate to a city view. She asked for my confirmation number...meanwhile after she had already checked me in. WTF? She finally changed the amount. It rubbed me the wrong way that I had to push for them to credit me. I wasn't asking for a discount - simply the rate for the room I was being put in, which was a lower priced room. Tacky on their part. \\n\\nService was friendly by some, but off by many.

Although food was decent, the delivery service was horrendous. I ordered delivery both times and gave them very specific instructions about what I wanted. First off this time around and the reason for my 1 Star is that they delivered the food 45 minutes after their 45-50 min window which meant I waited for 1.5 hours to get my food. Although you can reheat noodles and curry, you cannot reheat veggie dumplings. I'll get to the shape and taste in a bit but they arrived super soggy (pan fried). As for the shape, I've never seen dumplings like a pancake shape before and I've had plenty of Asian food. The taste well soggy bc of the delay and the filling well I could barely take a bite because it was so unmanageable to eat but it was filled with some kind of greens but so soggy so just dumped it. The noodles dish was fine but annoyed that I had to wait for 1.5 hours for noodles. The last dish ordered was red curry but they didn't put rice in so I didn't bother eating it and will have to wait to cook rice so I can try it a day late. I called the restaurant and all they could do was profusely apologize but didn't offer to get me rice or take off the cost of the dumplings plus their delivery fee. I also had asked for hot sauce and spices because I've never eaten Thai food without a spice tray and since I don't have a full kitchen since I just moved here, I was depending on them to deliver hence my request. Additionally I asked that they deliver to my unit since I'm mid organizing my place, the driver said he couldn't find parking but there is plenty of quick parking on my street in front of the building. \\n\\nAnyways I will not be a returning customer. Seems like there are plenty of other Thai places nearby with delivery services or I will use UberEATS. I also ordered this time around using the Yelp delivery service thru Eat24.

That's when I found out about Thurn's.\\n\\nWalking into Thurn's is like having your eyes opened to a new echelon of what is possible with meat. Almost everything here is fully cooked, in one of their smokers. They've been smoking the same way for generations, and have been around Columbus in some form or another for over a hundred years. So needless to say, it's hands down the best you can get in Columbus.\\n\\nAnd what a selection! I settled on some fantastic fresh smoked porkchops (literally sawed off to order), a pound or two of double-smoked wings, and a few slices of blood head cheese. Yes, blood head cheese, it's delicious, and you should be ashamed of not trying it yet. Thurn's knows what's good, which is why they still carry the traditional lunch meats, like head cheese, braunschweiger, and various \\"luncheon loafs\\".\\n\\nIt's cash only, but for about $20, I walked out with enough to eat myself sick.

I had a groupon and made a reservation for 8 pm on Saturday. That in itself was difficult as they don't do online reservations and when you call, a cross woman answers and says she'll try to give you a reservation, but she usually doesn't answer the phone and that's not her job. Sorry to bother you miss. When you get there, a busty teen-age hostess fails to acknowledge you, darting aimlessly around the restaurant and doing everything she can to avoid making eye contact with any of the hordes of customers waiting to let her know they've arrived. As I mentioned, we had an 8 pm reservation, and we didn't get to announce our presence until 8:45. Oddly, we were seated a minute or two later. This was the case for several other parties as well, and there was a great deal of griping in the foyer. Meanwhile the restaurant was almost empty. The food and actual food service were fine, pretty good even, but we were told they had run out of water glasses, so we could not have water until the glasses were washed. Apparently using another glass was out of the question. I never actually got angry about any of this nonsense because it was so utterly bizarre I assumed it could be attributed to a diagnosable mental illness on the part of management.  Someone probably thought, \\"people hate to wait for a table, but if we pretend they're not there they won't notice that they're waiting.\\" As another reviewer mentioned, this is the kind of place that shows up on Kitchen Nightmares and will eventually close down because the manager's version of reality is just too far from the one most humans share."},{"name":"Casa Garcia's","address":"1000 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"I stopped in here for dinner the other night after trying to see Slum dog at the Alamo when it was sold out.

I ordered the spanakopita platter.  Spanakopita: Very obviously yesterday's food and reheated.  It was warm, not hot, and definitely not heated all the way through.  1/4 piece of potato: warm, not heated all the way through.  Moulded cup of rice: warm, not heated all the way through.  1/2 cup of Greek salad: room temperature, not cold.  Vegetables obviously not fresh.  Bizarre dressing that might have just been white vinegar and oregano.  Tzatziki: wow, a generous tablespoon.  Did they they run out from yesterday and have to cut it with oil?  it was awfully greasy and had the strangest consistency.  Or maybe they accidentally left it out overnight?  Pita bread: I've never seen a Greek restaurant be so stingy with bread, cutting up small pitas into bite sized pieces so each person has the equivalent of a 1/4 of a who pita.  Oh, and it was stale.\\n\\nI totally get that most restaurants make their food in advance or partially in advance, but to serve us food that is so obviously not fresh and not at proper serving temperature is absolutely disgusting.\\n\\nService 2/5: Our waitress was pleasant and polite, seated us right away and was prompt with taking our orders and bringing our food.  Too bad she didn't come back and ask how our food was.  Who knows what was going on with staff in the kitchen.\\n\\nValue 1/5: Compared to other Greek restaurants I have been to, portion size was definitely smaller, and prices higher.  But what I was served should have been free leftover food sent home with guests from the party the night before.  \\n\\nAmbiance 1/5: The restaurant is tucked in a residential area -- must have been a converted house or something.  Kitschy decor, typical of most Greek restaurants in the city.  Tiresome, very quiet when we were there, lacked any sort of ambiance.\\n\\nOverall 1/5: Definitely not a place I will ever come back to or recommend to anyone.  Yes, I could have mentioned to the waitress that my food was absolutely horrendous, but that conversation would have either embarrassed her or others in my party, and wouldn't have changed the quality of my food.  (What, wait another 10 minutes while others are eating, to be served a different plate of leftovers?).  Maybe I would have been offered a discount for a future visit, but would I could back?  No.  Maybe my meal would have been free.

We had mediocre food and bad service when we went.\\n\\nMy boyfriend, who is a chef, was excited to order and try their biscuits and gravy because you don't find that in Canadian breakfast menus that often.  I was super excited to have their chicken and waffles, especially because I usually order their fried chicken (and oysters!)when we go there for dinners and I usually love it.\\nWell, it looks like they haven't changed their oil out for a while or they over fried the chicken because the chicken wasn't like what the color usually looks like. It looked almost on the cusp of being burnt.  Although it wasn't what I was expecting, it was edible.  Unlike my boyfriends.\\n\\nHe took on bite of the sausage and he said it was okay but then he got me to feel the gravy on the biscuit.  It was stone cold... not even luke or room temperature. Cold.  And lumpy.  So he sent it back and waiter said he would do something about it. So after waiting and waiting my boyfriend told my cousin and I to continue eating so our food wouldn't go cold as well.  So we did and FINALLY as we were finishing our plates, his plate came back.  Exact same food... the exact same plate with our finger indents in the cold gravy. Exactly as it left the table.. gravy was STILL stone cold. They didn't even fix the problem.  Not even sure what happened to that plate while it was gone.  Looks like it just sat on the pass for about 7 minutes and then got brought out again. \\nIt would have been faster to remake the plate. So basically they did nothing to it.  Obviously he sent it back again and lost his appetite to eat there.  \\nMe, being a food manager,  thought he would for sure get his whole meal comped. Nope.  They charged him for his drinks!  when we questioned that, the server said that they don't usually 'do that'.  Don't do good customer service? They need to review their PR skills.

I've been to 88 tofu house probably 3 times and I've only had 1 good experience there. My first visit there was during normal hours when the menu hadn't changed. Theres a decent selection of choices but I opted for the soup and entree combo. The soup was spiced and sized right, but the entree was a little smaller than what I had expected, but the various 'appetizers' that came to the table made up for that missing hole in my stomach. Although don't expect to see the waitress more than 2 times, 1 to take your order and 1 to bring the food. Hankering for decent korean food again at around 10 pm I came to the 88. But this time the dining experience wasn't as pleasant. The menu had been cut and there was no combo dinner. Also the wait staff seemed to be cut as well since it took a while (20+ min) to get our food.

If you're vegetarian, you better like risotto because that's the only entree you're getting.  I guess you could make a meal out of the starters and bar bites but the options are still limited, the menu isn't really meant for you.

I ordered it the other day and it was overcooked, came on one of the hardest rolls I've ever had a burger on and was overall tasteless.  You'd expect a bar to serve a pretty decent burger, hard to mess up but they really need to re-examine how they put this one together.

I usually go for anything with spinach and/or crispy potatoes in it. I frequent this spot and I have never had a dish that I didn't like. Also, I have never had a dish that I found spicy. Spice lovers (like myself) can add hot sauce that they provide beside the cash register.\\n\\nIf you aren't into the tiffin thing, the meals are also available plated.

A stock turkey sandwich that I could have made at home. I didn't taste anything resembling a cajun spice, and the garlic aioli seemed to be basic mayo. Like the other reviewer, there was a comically small amount of meat on the sandwich. The bread was good, but since there was so little meat it felt like I was eating a loaf of bread with some turkey garnish.\\nI don't mind paying more for a fancy burger, or sandwich, or whatever it may be-- but I want to get what I paid for.

So a three rating is serious disappointment in my book.

I can't trust a description of \\"mixed greens\\" and generally request romaine or other single variety lettuce. That request was apparently not able to be honored at this time. \\n\\nThe fondue didn't come with enough cheese for the toast they provide. I saved the extra bread as croutons for my soup. Which seemed like a huge asset. The shrimp bisque came with a disclaimer that the chef has been perfecting it for 10+ years. Perhaps a few more years will develop it into something savory?  It was ok, but that's not why I go out to dinner. I want someone to prepare something better than what I can open in a can at home. \\n\\nMy scallops came to the table looking like they had been seared to a delicious frazzle.

It was nicely crispy even though it was delivery), fried rice with dried scallops and egg white was fine, and century egg and pork slices congee was good too (though my personal preference is for it to be cooked down more so that you don't see the grains of rice anymore, and I like it extra thick, so it's more medium thick, with the texture of the rice still there.  Taste was good. Plenty of egg and pork in it.  Portion was really big, so plenty for the 3 person meal).  I did the mix and match combo with 3 dishes, but I think that's only a good deal if you choose the higher priced dishes (which I did.  Note that the congee is not one of the usual options for the soup, but they let me do this).  Best dish was the beef brisket hot pot (if you are okay with a little bit spicy) - a great stew for fall/winter on rice.

Traveled there over the weekend for a wedding and stayed in the Club Level for several days. The rooms were very clean, and the housekeeping service was top-notch. All of our needs were met, and our requests were met promptly and without fail. \\n\\nHere's a brief rundown of the experience: \\n\\n* From the moment you arrive, you are made to feel welcome. The valets do a wonderful job of making you feel special. The check-in process was rather painless, and the room was up to our expectations. Bed comfy, room cool. Free Wi-Fi and turn-down service nightly. \\n\\n* The Club Level rooms give you access to the Private Lounge on the 26th floor. Really nice views. The lounge offers complimentary Continental Breakfast, Athletic Club privileges, valet parking, hors d'oeuvres and more. The lounge staff was very accommodating, particularly due to the fact that it was flooded with small children. Wasn't quite expecting that, but there was a dance competition of some sort at the hotel that weekend and large families were everywhere. I guess it's a crapshoot depending on the weekend you go. We were looking forward to spending some quiet moments in the lounge to enjoy the \\"off the beaten path\\" vibe of the lounge. A few things derailed our efforts. My wife nearly got run over by a group of hungry kids lunging at the fresh cookies our first night. The next morning, when looking for a seat, we found a baseball cap wearing man sprawled out on a sofa snoring away, and a lot of guests showing up barefoot, in robes etc. So we ended up grabbing our food, coffee and snacks and headed back to our room. \\n\\n* We grabbed a bite at the 24-Hour B-Line Diner when we arrived. Both of us decided on the blackened Fresh Fish Sandwich. Excellent. Service was outstanding here and it was a great spot to grab a quick meal after arriving very hungry. \\n\\n* There are two pools. One is located at the Mallard Tower. It's quiet there, and the pool itself is long and there are plenty of chairs available. The other pool is at the newer wing. It's a \\"grotto\\" style pool and is much more aimed at families. There's a water slide there, and a few other kid-centric areas. The poolside bar, \\"Coconuts,\\" offers some nice lunch options. You can sit there and eat, or wait staff will come to you and you can place your orders with them. Again, the servers were very attentive and accommodating. \\n\\n* After a night out at a restaurant nearby, we went out to the patio deck of \\"Rocks,\\" their nightclub. After sitting there for a few minutes a waitress came out and asked us \\"what do you want?\\" Not a great first greeting. After asking her for a drink menu, and not seeing her again for several minutes in an empty-ish bar, we decided to leave. This was by far the exception to the rule. A visit to \\"Napa\\" made it all better. Great bartender there, but I've forgotten his name. \\n\\n* The Fitness Center was very nice. Modern equipment, free weights, nice locker rooms. \\n\\n* Finally, the duck march. Very cool, but with a lot more pomp-and-circumstance than I remember from previous visits. Definitely cool to check out and the ducks will chill in the fountain all afternoon if you want to see them without the crowds all around. If you want to see the march, I'd suggest going up one floor and peering over the balcony. That's the best view. \\n\\nWe'd definitely make a return trip to the Peabody Orlando. Not only is it a great location, adjacent to theme parks and close to the restaurant and shopping areas, it's an affordable luxury hotel that has a lot to offer everyone."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"60 Newport Ave","city":"Quincy","stars":"2.5","text":"I've been going to this particular Chipotle since they opened some years back. The quality of the ingredients is quite good. The service can vary, but most of the time I'm pleased with the experience. Usually the portions are generous, with the occasional employee who holds back on rice, beans, or meat. The burrito wrapping is something I've had unpleasant experiences with, where best case scenarios have the employee re-wrapping one that is slightly torn to burritos so loosely wrapped that they barely hold together. So I started just getting the burrito bowls, which seems to be more food for the same price, usually.\\n\\nThis location can be extremely busy during a weekday lunch rush.

There is a decent size bar and a nice outside area if you want to eat outside. We seated ourselves and again was greeted by the owner. He was super friendly and we really enjoyed having conversation with him while we dined. He told us about their happy hour specials ( from 4-7) and sold us on their pretzel and beer battered cheese curds. I ordered the Slowpoke Rodriguez, basically a taco in a grilled cheese sandwich.( taco meat, cheese tomato, and avocado). My friend ordered the Mac the Knife ( Gouda, cheddar cheese Mac, bacon, and honey). I had mine with fries, hers with a salad, and both came with a small side of tomato soup. Our cheese curds came out quick. The portion size was nice, we split them 3 ways and still had some left over. They were fresh, hot, and the cheese just oozed out. They were crisp and tasty and were accompanied by this delicious Dijon mustard for dipping. Next was our sandwiches. Again, we didn't have to wait long at all. My sandwich was amazing. Who would have thought a grilled cheese taco would be so tasty. There was a little bit of a kick, but nothing I couldn't handle. My friend really enjoyed her bacon mac grilled cheese.she let me try it, and just like mine, it was absolutely fantastic. The bacon was smokey and you could taste the sweetness of the honey. The soup was equally as good. Oh before I forget, try their stone fruit lemonade. It was like nothing I e had before. I believe he said it was lemonade infused with peach, nectarine, and plum.

Yes, this is a new concept of dim sum, and no, this isn't like (fill in the city of your choice) dim sum.  BUT -- husband and I had a late lunch there yesterday, and found it to be quite good. Not just \\"well, it's good, for Austin\\", good, either.  I've been around, dim sum wise - growing up in Seattle, then living in Los Angeles until I got smart enough to get to Austin....and our family has traveled several times to different parts of China. From my experiences, there are as many different and good kinds of dim sum as there are most any other kind of food...\\n\\nAnyway.  We both had the 7.95 special with 2 selections and a steamed bun. For fun we added Chinese broccoli...as others have mentioned, it is perfectly cooked with a light oyster sauce. We fought over the last of it, in fact. The shrimp dumplings were great - plump shrimp, juicy with tons of flavor. We also enjoyed the pork & chicken w/wheat wrappers and another with shrimp. I had the vege bun while husband opted for the pork -- neither one of us was willing to share. A bit over steamed, but the flavors good. \\n\\nDessert was the sesame balls...w/sweet bean paste, and a slightly crunchy/chewy texture, which I love.  All of this for around $20, which includes 2 fountain drinks. I'd prefer a beer, but given the vagaries of TABC I surely do understand and will happily sip on soda or ice tea. Thai ice tea was also on the offerings during our visit - it looked good.\\n\\nService was delightful, and as mentioned elsewhere, the manager spent time chatting with us to make sure all was as we wanted. The place was bright and clean, with a choice of seating arrangements - high tops with bar stools, a bar along the front windows facing Lamar, and booths and regular tables. Several Asian families with little kids and grandparents were eating with us - and many other folks were clearly enjoying their first dim sum experience.  \\n\\nSo, this may be dim sum for the masses, but not in a bad way, at all. A nice selection, 50% of the menu is vegetarian, a fun spin on how dim sum is generally served -if you're in the mood, you'll definitely enjoy!"},{"name":"Jimmy John's","address":"3164 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Love Jimmy John's.

Understandably Saturday nights are busy....but this was a little too long.  We finally ordered our food and the waiter tells me that I can't have what I want.  That it would take too long to prepare.  (It's fish btw..  How long could that take??).  My fianc√© was going to order something until the waiter made a face and said it wasn't good.  Next was when we asked for a little more of the \\"complimentary\\" popcorn and the waiter told us \\"NO, you need to save room for your dinner and dessert.\\"  We thought he was joking!!  But alas, he wasn't.  Our entrees finally come out.  The burger I settled on was slightly undercooked.  My fianc√©'s was less than pleased with his chicken dinner.

It could have been saved by the dessert, but they came out frozen.  The only decent part of our meal was our soups.  Lastly, I glanced at the check and left it where the waiter put it.  I laid it on the table, which I shouldn't have done.  Usually that signals the waiter it's ready to be picked up.  I know that!!  As soon as I did it, the waiter came over and said, \\"I'll get change for you.\\"  I responded with, \\"I'm sorry, it's not ready.  I knew as soon as I put it down..

Every now and then you go to a place and order a veggie slice and just get a cheese pizza with a bit of mushroom and a piece or two of broccoli, but not here. They seriously pack that pizza with every vegetable in the house. They've even got a few other vegetarian pizza options if you'd like something a little more unique. If you just want to build your own, they have a toppings list that puts other pizzerias to shame. And the pizza itself is just plain good - not too thin or thick, and made with delicious and fresh sauce and cheese. Their small is definitely fit for sharing - I usually only eat half, but hey, I don't mind having leftovers either. They even have a decent falafel wrap. Who would have thought you could find that at a pizza place?\\n\\nThe atmosphere is nice too - it's spacious and generally a nice place to hang around, even though eating anywhere in Newton Center means you'll inevitably have to deal with hordes of tweens around.

I called in an order on my way home because there was no way I was going to cook after traveling at the pace of a snail the 12 miles from my work to home.  Even though this location was getting ready to close early due to the snow, they took my order and stayed open long enough for me to come pick it up.  \\n\\nThe staff at this location have always been nice and always willing to accommodate my hatred of tomatoes on pizza.  They allow me to substitute tomatoes for black olives or some other veggie friendly topping. \\n\\nReally the only thing that would make this place better is more vegetarian options on their pizza menu.

I understand that is their gimmick, and I like dogs, but can there be a limit or something? My boyfriend had a strange dog under his chair the entire meal and couldn't move. Dogs sniffing each other in the open space, dogs walking around to other tables looking for dropped food, flies buzzing around the dogs, etc.\\n\\nThe only thing that will bring me back to the Tin Shed, is the Baby Beluga.

Waitress took appetizer order and dinner order at the same time.  I was hoping they would not all come out together.  They did.  Spicy calamari was not spicy and was very heavily breaded and kind of mushy.  We did not eat our entrees there.  The fries were cold when we got them. We were told by the older waitress that she was not longer our waitress.   We were rescued by another waitress who wrapped our food for us.  We were not asked if there was a problem with the meal.

Lah LA laLAla laah, Laaah lala LA laaaah. Yeah. Something like that. It was smurfy.\\n\\nWe walk in and hit my head on something. I think it was the cloud of smoke. Whoah... smoking in bars... oh yeah! They still do that in places huh! I felt like I was in a weird foreign country or in a Southern state (which is like being in a weird foreign country as well). Welp, whatevah, what's a little second hand smoke in my lungs and making my clothes smell like ass for a few hours right?\\n\\nRight in front of me as I entered, once my vision adjusted to the smoky gloom, and if I wasn't so hammered from mixing alcohol and cold medicine, was a stairway down. I didn't even notice it at first, which is kind of dangerous with stairways. Later, it occurred to me that I could have pulled a Chevy Chase/SNL entrance to the downstairs. I probably wouldn't have felt it, considering the odd state my brain was entering.\\n\\nI headed over to the bar and realized that there were other Portland Yelpers that I had just met and danced wildly with at the Green Papaya Elite Event. I dragged Lauren G. into the photobooth (see pics). I like Photobooths apparently.\\n\\nThis is where I think the mixture of alcohol and cold medicine really kicked in. I am not sure what happened or how much time had passed, or even what city or time zone I was in, but I suddenly became aware that I was listening to a band in a very low-ceilinged, dark basement looking room that looked like it was half under construction. There was a crowd of people around me applauding a girl playing bass and singing, accompanied by a guy playing drums making funny faces, and two other girls playing keyboards. The sound was haunting, and they were just finishing their song, which accounts for the people applauding. I was a bit freaked out. I literally had no idea where I was or how I had gotten there. In a remote part of my brain, I did know that I liked the music, and they began playing another song, and concern about where I was suddenly dissipated...\\n\\n...I must have slipped again. My memory is very hazy of staring at this girl singing and playing bass. She was green and red. The sound... it was spooky and haunting but pretty cool. There was an EMO guy standing next to me. He had this crazy hair cut that made me think of Echo and the Bunnymen, and he was talking to me about being depressed but liking chicken. I was agreeing with him on the chicken thing. And I got freaked out again as I still didn't know where I was or how much time had passed, but eating chicken sounded pretty good.\\n\\nI turned and tried to figure out how to get out of this dark basement-like room. There was a passage-way and a line of people. I walked up to them and, feeling sheepish, got into line as well. I asked the guy in front of me, \\"So... this bar... it's called what?\\" He looks at me and smiles and says, \\"East End.\\" Ah. Right. Weird. I looked around for the cloud of smoke and the photobooth. Or the windows. The door? The Portland Yelpers? Anything that would make this make sense. Nothing, though a guy with permed hair walked by wearing leopard print tights and a leather/denim jacket. I distinctly remember thinking to myself, \\"Rad.\\"\\n\\nIt's times like these that a good pee makes the world an easier place to deal with. I took advantage of my rapidly advancing place in line and did just that. I fished in my pocket for my Listerine breath strip package, thinking that maybe a blast of spearmint would bring me back to the here and now, and if anything I wouldn't offend anyone with my breath, and came out with the empty package of cold medicine. That little voice that we all have in our head that tells us sensible things like \\"don't piss off the big guy with the tattoos\\" or \\"don't pee uphill\\" broke through for a moment and said, \\"Hey stupid! You drank excessive amounts and took cough medicine on an empty stomach! That explains why...\\" and that's as much as that little voice could say before I started blanking again.\\n\\nI found myself back out in basement area next to perm hair leopard print guy. I was telling him how much I loved his guitar playing in Night Ranger's 'Sister Christian' video. I suddenly realized there was a stairway leading up next to him. I decided I'd ascend these stairs and see where they went.\\n\\nI suddenly found myself in the smoky room with the photobooth, with windows, door, and a crowd of Portland Yelpers. I remember feeling relieved. I think I talked with them, I apologize folks if I was a bit weird. Anyway, aware that I was freaking out and had already probably offended everyone around me, I headed out.\\n\\nI'm not a fan of smoky bars. So knocked a star off.

I live in a big lofted space which is awesome...until a bat gets stuck in the apartment. You can't sleep in a room with a bat unless you want to get rabies shots, and you can't lock yourself in a room separated from the bat when you only live in one room. Being as there was the need for constant shuttling between hotel and home, something closer to home made sense than like, the doubletree or something.\\n\\nThe lobby is gorgeous. Totally old school Boston opulence. The rooms are also sort of old school opulence, heavily brocaded everything. They offer a bath menu (my favorite was the description of the \\"Make Way for Ducklings\\" bath that included bubbles, cookies, a rubber duck, and a glass of chocolate milk. While I am creeped out at having someone draw a bath for me, that was pretty endearing)\\n\\nThe room service menu looked great and extensive (and expensive) but I was too tired and miserable to avail myself to it. They do have late night options which I thought was cool.\\n\\nThe baths are very deep, which was nice to soak in after having been strip searched for bat bites and spending a few hours in my apartment in jeans and a hoodie in 85 degree weather. The shower was pretty awesome too.\\n\\nHonestly, the only thing I did -not- love was the bed/pillows. Maybe if I had availed myself to the pillow bar I would've slept better. It's also possible I didn't sleep well because I was stressed out.\\n\\nWhile I hopefully will not stay at the Taj Boston again, I would totally check out another Taj in another city."},{"name":"Red and Black Cafe","address":"400 SE 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"On tour, was excited to try this place out.

It wasn't overpriced if the food was good, but it really wasn't that tasty at all.

Luckily, Dots was close to our stay and found that it served vegan/vegetarian dishes!  I ordered the Asian Tofu Bowl, man, I was not disappointed.  I always think vegetarian dishes are bland, not this one - Tofu and sauteed veggies in soy ginger sauce over brown rice. OMG delicious.

It's been one of the more welcome additions to the food court over the last five years because there hasn't been any Indian food at Peachtree Center Mall that I can recall until now. This is a good option for vegetarians and people who want to eat halal food.\\n\\nTurmeric has a line of hot ready-to-serve foods much like a typical Chinese food court joint. For those familiar with the food court at Peachtree Center Mall, the serving format is in the same mold as Malibu Wings and Tropical Cajun. However, I think the ingredients here are slightly higher quality. You won't find any low-price $4.99 or $5.99 combos, but the food is still reasonably priced for what you get. I noticed prices have increased about $1.00 across the board. Here were the prices last I went:\\n\\nMadras (rice, bread, 2 veggies) - $6.75\\nBombay (rice, bread, 1 meat, 1 veggie) - $7.50\\nDelhi (rice, bread, 2 meats) - $8.50\\nSamosas (2 pieces) - $4.00\\nMango Lassi - $4.00\\n\\nNo matter if you order the Madras, Bombay, or Delhi, you'll get a three-compartment Styrofoam box full of rice, bread, and tasty food. The portion size is filling. I believe the rice is white basmati rice. It's lighter and softer than jasmine rice used in East Asian cuisine. Turmeric's rice has been lightly seasoned too. It goes well with their meats and veggies.\\n\\nThe bread is naan, Indian flatbread. You get one piece of naan per order. Each piece of naan comes wrapped in foil. The pieces are kept warm in a tray on the food line.\\n\\nThe menu changes daily. They seem to have different items everyday. They serve a lot of standard Indian fare like Chana Masala (chickpeas), Palak Paneer (spinach and cheese), Muttar Paneer (peas, cheese, tomato-based sauce), Aloo Gobi (potatoes and cauliflower), Spinach Dal, Okra Curry, Goat Curry, Chicken 65, Chicken Korma, and Lamb Curry.\\n\\nItems I've tried include the Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Spinach, Mixed Vegetable Curry, and an item simply labeled \\"Cabbage.\\" Funny enough, the \\"cabbage\\" has been my favorite so far. I'm not sure what all is in the cabbage dish, but it looked to have minced cabbage mixed with green peas and perhaps chickpeas, all seasoned in a flavorful spice mix. It was a \\"dry\\" dish, not one drenched in sauce. If anyone happens to know the actual Indian name for this dish, please let me know.\\n\\nThe other items I've tried have been A-OK. The sauce for the Chicken Tikka Masala wasn't as creamy as I would've liked, but it wasn't bad. I thought the quality of the chicken in both the Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Spinach was satisfactory. The Chicken Spinach sauce was savory and the dish as a whole a bit soupy. The Mixed Vegetable Curry contained what I think were cubed carrots, green peas, sliced green beans, and cauliflower in a tomato-based curry sauce.\\n\\nBeverages served are basic Coke fountain products. Napkins and cheap plastic cutlery are self-serve in front of the register.\\n\\nService is good."},{"name":"Tuscan Kitchen - Seaport","address":"64 Seaport Blvd","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I came here with my family and their friends.

Although the service was alright, the food tasted mediocre. The warm bread they served at the beginning was delicious along with the tomato sauce to dip it in. According to my family, the calamari was good but not amazing. But when I ordered the mozzarella carazzo, things started going downhill. It came with mozzarella sticks and pesto that tastes similar to the one I make at my house. My mom and I shared the lobster ravioli which was kind of spicy but otherwise flavorless. Not even the cheese could save it. I don't like to waste food so I ate my half, but none of us except for one person decided to order dessert.

Again, a little expensive at $10 for the sandwich (I thought expensive sandwiches was Stuff White People Like, not ethnic eateries), but it was worth it.

They had several Spanish condiments. It was good and fresh. The decor was kind of dated and plain, but the food, pricing and family atmosphere more than made up for it.

You knew the drink was bacon infused because the grease was sticking to the rim of the glass.\\n\\nI ordered their BBQ Shrimp & Grits with Poached Eggs ($13) and it seriously was the gateway to brunch heaven. With creole spiced prawns, Parmesan cheese grits, and two poached eggs, how do you say no? These grits had texture, but not rough at all. In fact, it felt like I was eating mashed potatoes, with some bits not mashed. Grab a spoonful of grits, submerge it in the creole sauce, and thats the formula for a happy camper. If you have serious hunger pangs, this is the dish to order.\\n\\nI've had their Southern Crab Cake Benny the visit before this, and that was pretty delicious too. But if you're looking for something special, try their shrimp & grits. I don't think you can get a dish like that anywhere else in Vancouver.\\n\\nThey have an outdoor patio, which is where we sat on a sunny Sunday afternoon.

We stayed there last year and not only was it a nicer hotel but for the extra 50 a night the cost of the food was half the price and their specialty drinks were less than the beers here. Not to mention the Rosen made their food fresh for you on order. I was completely disappointed with the mark up on everything here at the Hyatt regency. The pools were small and overcrowded and the convention they had here the pools upstairs were reserved. We paid for a resort fee of 25 dollars a day but I'm still wondering for what because you have to mix your own coffee and toast your own bagels. To recap, if you want to pay 27 dollars for a bottle of SPF sunblock at the convenience store and 6 dollars for a Aquafina bottle you can get 2 24 packs of at publix this is definitely the place for you.\\n\\nI'd personally recommend paying the extra cost for the Rosen Shingle Creek or the Omni and having a good variety of restaurants and convenience shops you can actually go to."},{"name":"Toko Foods","address":"223 W 7th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Ok food.

Every table has its own composer theme, with a collage under the glass (we sat at the Mozart table), and live music seem to be a regular thing. It's dark, yes, but it's cozy, and the desserts were delicious. When I asked why the Banana Split was, as the menu claimed \\"best in Portland\\", the waiter made up an impromptu rap. I eventually picked a sundae called \\"Ship goes to pieces against a rock\\" (mint ice cream, chocolate, whipped cream; very good), and my partner had the seasonal blackberry cobbler a la mode (he said it was very tasty, just the right amount of sweetness.)

I wanted to eat the rice with the meats and veggies we ordered but I was hungry so I just ate one small bowl. Waiting another 20 minutes or so, we got impatient, it's been almost an hour already and only 2 dishes came out. THEN, a staff came to us and told us when we ordered the rice, their computer some how removed our first order, which was funny how we still got our shao long bao, if it was removed. Then about 10 minutes later the half chicken came, then took another 10 minutes for the veggie and duck to arrive.\\n\\nWe calmly ate it but was very dissatisfied. We almost ate 1 dish at a time with long intervals. Last but not least the fried shirmp balls came out, 90 minutes after we sat down. I still don't believe it was a \\"computer error\\". \\n\\nThe food in general was pretty good, except for the fried shrimp balls, it felt like bits of slimy shrimp that doesn't taste like shrimp, it was very tasteless.\\n\\nThey know we were unhappy and all we got was a quick reason 45 minutes later and an unsympathetic sorry. \\n\\nMaybe just bad luck for us that night?

Not too much not too little. I had the crab cakes and they were light and crispy on the outside. I would call it a medium sized portion. It is served with a slaw that has a nice Asian flavor. Let's talk value. They get 4 out of 5 rubies from me. The happy hour from 4-6 lets me choose a house wine for only $5 and a flat bread or another small plate item for $5. I will do The Wine Bistro again and again.

The service is usually good with the waitstaff usually anxious to please. This seems to be a mostly happy place to be and a good place to gather with friends. portions are big.

First new restaurant in Austin to actually deliver on all the hype (looking at you Loro ). Top to bottom, every aspect of the dining experience was truly top notch. Started with a couple cocktails from the bar as we arrived a little early and was not disappointed. The Don Dario, with its subtle yet well blended flavors, was one of the best drinks I've really ever had. Started off with the snapper tostada, which had an ample portion of fresh snapper nestled below a top layer of avocado slices. Despite the chili mayo, the tostado maintains it's perfect crunch. A nice, light starter. Next, we got yes saudero tacos. The dish came with 4 pretty decent tacos topped with guacamole, which was an extremely pleasant surprise given their relatively inexpensive price tag and deliciousness. For entrees, we opted for the carne asada & goat barbacoa. While the carne asada was very good (the fried little potato balls mixed in the whipped potatoes are a nice touch), the goat was the show stealer. Served with 3 \\"sauces\\", the dish was a can't miss.

I ordered the Art Lover, and it had large piles of roasted garlic all over it. No attempt was made to spread it out, so I would get surprising mouthfuls of burning garlic taste - I couldn't see them because they blended in the ricotta - and that much garlic in one bite is a turnoff.\\n\\nI had also ordered a side salad with a variety of toppings, one of them roasted garlic, and I kid you not, it was a whole bulb of roasted garlic with all of the cloves intact. I picked most of them off, but I stink like garlic 24 hours later.\\n\\nThey were all disorganized when my husband went to pick up the order. The employee helping him kept thinking he had 4 pizzas, when he should have had 3 pizzas, a salad, and 2 desserts (which my husband didn't know I ordered, so we never received them). I would think it would be simple for the employees to match customers with their orders, or at least know the contents of an order, but apparently not. Employees in the front and back of the house need more training. Online ordering was relatively easy, but it would be nice for the employees to be knowledgeable about the order once you show up.

You could not tell it was COMPLETELY RAW on the inside because it has char-grilled marks on the outside. My friend ordered the same thing and his was RAW as well. We let the manager know and filled out the incident report. We also obtained the contact information of their insurance carrier in case I may get sick.\\nSure enough, I did get sick and had to go to emergency care. Several hundred dollars and a week's worth of stomach discomfort later, I finally began feeling better and called the insurance carrier for the location to be reimbursed for my medical care. To my dismay, the adjuster was rude, unprofessional and has flat out ignored my request to be reimbursed for my medical bill. I did not even asking to be reimbursed for the day I had to take off at work or the general unpleasantness or inconvenience. I really just wanted my medical bill paid, which has now gone into collections. I don't know if this is some sort of a trend with Smokey Bones as a company, but the manager who had us fill out the incident report never apologized (the server did, by the way). The adjuster never apologized either and never, at any point, asked if I was okay. Is this how you want to treat your customers?\\nNo matter the quality of the food (which has also been declining in recent times), there's a level of service and respect you have to provide to your customers. Smokey Bones has shown it can provide neither. And they will never get my business again for that reason.

They weren't the ones I wanted to order so I passed and went to a la carte. \\n\\nI ordered a BBQ pork bun \\"bao\\". It was huge! It was good. I'm used to smaller ones but it was good. I also ordered the shrimp dumplings (YUM), shrimp flat noodles (YUM), chicken dumplings (meh) and the eggplant (OMFG Delicious!!!). My favorite was the eggplant. It was hard to describe how they made it but it had a filling that was kind of stuffed and then was lightly deep fried. \\n\\nWould I go there again.... sure.

My friend's coworkers had talked up the spinach enchiladas so she opted for those. They were tasty though you've got to be a real fan of cooked spinach or else the greenery might be a bit much. My adobo pork tacos were good. Soft tortillas with nicely charred pork, topped with radishes, diced onions, cilantro and parsley. The meat itself was really flavorful and had a good seasoning to it. The rice and beans on the side were forgettable and mostly went untouched.  We were both drinking their house margaritas which came out in salted mason jars with orange slices- which might have contributed to why they tasted so sweet.

We ordered fried tofu (so Amazing!), sweet and sour wontons (so Delicious), peanut noodle soup (good), pork dumplings (so Amazing!), vegetable dumpling (my least fave - lacked the juices and was dry but husband liked it ) and finally the triple basil sauce chicken (which I thought was good but husband wasn't crazy about it). Overall, this was some of the best food we've had in a long long time at a restaurant. My husbands least fave was the chicken. We ended up eating everything except a bit of the chicken was left over. The bill was only $58 for all that food! Incredible. The most expensive dish was the chicken. It was about 8:15 by the time we got down (in and out in an hour!) and there was still a long line of people waiting to dine.

For dinner, we all did different tacos (I would recommend getting 4 tacos to feel satisfied and not uncomfortably full). Our favorites were definitely the fried oyster taco and the carnitas taco.

Overall, the tacos were fresh and full of spices but could still taste the meat.\\n\\nCocktails are a bit pricey here-was about $9 for a margarita but they are made with freshly made juice so not your average marg.

I was on my way to lunch at one of my usual sandwich and salad spots nearby when I realized that this place had opened.  I popped in just before 1pm.  They were quite busy but they had certainly staffed for it.  A gentleman (manager type?) greeted me at the door and handed me a menu to peruse while I waited in line. The line was long but moved quickly.  I ordered a salad and sandwich combo that was priced at less than $10 (which is what I'm used to at the other place), I also added a lemon bar and my total was under $13.  \\n\\nI sat down and my food came out quickly, I think I overhead the gentleman at the door say their goal was to get food to your table within 4 minutes of ordering.  The Caesar salad was well sized and fresh.  The lettuce was crisp, the croutons were crunchy and crumbly and the dressing was just the right amount and very tasty.  Corner bakery definitely beats my usual salad/sandwich place on the Caesar.  The Uptown Turkey sandwich was good even though they used deli meat.  It didn't beat my usual sandwich a the other place though,  The bacon was crispy and fresh, the avocado was creamy and ripe, and the wheat bread had a nice flavor to it.  Lunch also came with chips, which you can sub out for other items, and a pickle.  I think at least 5 different people checked on me. I imagine that will calm down some after the first day jitters are over.  One employee came by with samples of their breakfast oatmeal.  I thought that was a great idea!  They had the chance to take my business from Starbucks where I usually get my oatmeal.  Sadly though, I didn't like it.  It was too....milky?  I think she said they use yogurt in it, and the oatmeal itself didn't feel cooked, it just felt soggy.  That idea backfired, at least for me.  Their breakfast sandwich options sound good though so I will still give them a try them for breakfast.  My lemon bar was pretty good too.

Sometimes this is due to location, sometimes this is due to wait.  In the Busy Bee's case, it's the wait.\\n\\nThe name \\"Busy Bee\\" is definitely apt.  It hustles and bustles and there can be a wait when you show. In my case, it was a not-so-bad 20 minutes, but had I been on my lunch hour, it would've required me wolfing down my grub with nary a notice of taste.

I was pleased with my order. The chicken had great flavor, though it was a bit salty for my tastes. Now I say this of a bird first fried and then covered in gravy, so really salty should've been expected by this point. The collards weren't overcooked and still had some bite to them. I only wish I'd tasted more meat (either ham, bacon or smoked turkey) to accompany it.  The broccoli casserole had just the right amout of broccoli and cheese without one component overpowering the other.\\n\\nThis brings me to the sweet tea which I referred to at the time as \\"a cupful of diabeetus.\\" It's so sweet I saw Willy Wonka enter hand in hand with Strawberry Shortcake astride a caramel unicorn take a swig and say, \\"Damn, that shit is SWEET.\\" Some in the South may enjoy a tea this sweet. Some in the South also marry their cousins.  Were I to return to the Busy Bee, I'd either ask for half sweet/half unsweet or just order a lemonade.

We did have to send our plates back because we don't eat pork (bacon and ham comes on the dish ) even with that the manager was more than accommodating and responsive to our requests. The plates are full of food. So much food that you cannot eat it all! More than enough for two people to share each plate. The booths are very spacey. No sitting on top of each other.

We sat at a table/booth by the wall and was asked to take our shoes off. No worries! We slipped off our shoes and sat down. Beware of the booth dividers, they are not attached to the booth and will move if you lean on them! I had assumed Yebisuya was owned by the same owners as Shoya. The general vibe of the restaurant, the food, and the menu all looked very similar to what Shoya has to offer. The only difference is that Yebisuya focuses on Ramen. \\n\\nBetween four people, we ordered the takoyaki, gyoza, corn and butter ramen, miso ramen, pork chashu and katsu curry. We ate family-style so we could each try a bit of everything. The thing is... I never was a fan of ramen at Shoya and I feel the same way towards ramen at Yebisuya. The flavor is just not there. It's hard to describe exactly what is missing from the ramen at Yebisuya but I can only describe the taste as lackluster. Nothing I ate stood out to me. Oddly enough, the egg that comes with the ramen is hard-boiled? I'm used to seeing onsen eggs with ramen but this may be just how Yebisuya serves eggs. \\n\\nAlthough I may not be a fan of the ramen at Yebisuya, I really enjoyed the Katsu Curry and would recommend for everyone to try this! The portion is big, the chicken is fried to a golden crisp, the curry is creamy and rich and beneath all this deliciousness lies a bed of yummy white rice.

The sweet & sour pork was not over battered and the meat was pretty lean, tender, and moist. The noodles were decent. \\n\\nThe decor of the restaurant is pretty dated but clean. It's obvious that they cater to a western crowd as by default they give you a fork and a plate (no bowl) at the table - I had to ask for chopsticks. Service was good (for a Chinese restaurant). We ordered three dishes, but only two came first and we waited a long time for the 3rd. Finally, we asked them to check up on it, and it came shortly after that. Seems like they might have forgot about it, but it came quickly after so not a big deal breaker. \\n\\nIt's definitely not gourmet Chinese food but it's pretty good for the price.

I was wondering when he would take a fresh sausage out of the refrigerator (like the regular cook does) and put it on the griddle to be cooked...this never happened.  After he scrambled my egg, he gave me a precooked sausage that wasn't even hot.  He put the bread (untoasted) in the to go box, then the cold sausage on top and then my egg.  What in the hell? I said I will take the bread and he gave it to me.  I was a bit frustrated at this point and decided to toast the bread at my office.

The location was ideal since it was directly across the street from the apartment where I was staying. Each time I came in, the host greeted me right away and I never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a table, even when it was busy. Servers and bartenders were also very attentive and friendly, and the beer selection is huge. On one occasion, I sat at the bar and ordered an appetizer and an entree, and both dishes arrived at once. This wasn't even really a huge problem for me, but nonetheless, a manager came right over and apologized for the kitchen mix-up. Another time (the only time I found the food completely unsatisfactory), I ordered the soup special (some kind of spring minestrone) and it was just completely flavorless. I didn't even have to say anything; the bartender noticed I wasn't really eating it and apologized and took it off the bill unprompted.\\n\\nBrief review of the dishes I had (not all on the same day!): \\n\\nCast iron corn bread: great flavor, but a little undercooked.\\n\\nWhite bean hummus: pretty good, though a little bland; bread crisps were so hard and crunchy that they were difficult to bite into.\\n\\nFried chicken salad: really tasty, though not mixed together so it was kind of a struggle to get a bite with everything in it. Fried chicken was crispy but moist, other ingredients were fresh and delicious, and the buttermilk scallion sauce had great flavor.\\n\\nCheddar jalapeno mashed potatoes: thumbs up. Not too cheesy, not too spicy, great texture.\\n\\nVeggie burger: pretty good! Not too dry or too bean-heavy. Like most veggie burgers, it kind of fell apart as I was eating it, but still good even though I eventually had to use a fork.\\n\\nTater tots: WTF SO GOOD. And such a massive serving! Could've eaten these as my entire meal.\\n\\nOf the probably 5-6 times I came in, the best experience was a Sunday when a few friends and I kind of set up shop and ended up drinking there for...I will not specify how many hours. Let's just say we started on the patio and eventually had to go in because the sun went down and it got too cold, and then we finally left around closing. The food and drinks were fantastic and the service was consistent and attentive the entire time we were there. They never forgot about us even though we were there for hours and there was actually a shift change during that period (lol). \\n\\nI'm going with three stars because even though the service, beer selection, and outdoor seating were all great and I would definitely go back for those reasons, the food was hit or miss. Some of it was delicious, but other dishes ranged from so-so to not even worth finishing.

Then we find out they were playing the Seahawks game on the entire one side of the place, where we had kept our seats all day to not watch that game. In fact, there were just as many people in our row pissed off that they were showing one game on an entire side. Other fans outnumbered he seahawk fans! I saw several people leave, but my game was already going so I asked where it would be shown. They pointed to the projector farthest from the bleacher seating, with an air duct blowing down on it and making it move constantly. What a joke! I was super excited that I had paid for $6 beers, which is way too expensive for a pint of beer that is $4-5 anywhere else! Everyone that works there is a dirty hipster that has nothing to say except \\"sorry\\" will a stupid smirk. We decided not to stay.\\n\\nMy friend and I decided to go back this week and give them another shot. We knew the Seahawk game was late so there shouldn't be issues. He wanted to watch his team play at 1pm so we went there and snagged some seats. Just as we sat, all of the projectors on one side turned to the Timbers match. You have to be kidding me!! His game wasn't even on! We left again, and talked with at least ten other people walking out with the same team jerseys pissed off. There were families with kids sitting in the bleachers with Timbers gear on.. as if a couple 9 year olds are going to spend as much money there as a bunch of football fans would have. I've never seen so many people leave a place at once, and their place went from full to not. \\n\\nI don't see any need to return, as it's been a waste of money and time.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the stuff, but as I drove home I was put in mind of that friend who didn't go to her prom in \\"Pretty In Pink\\" and who once in a while \\"...gets this really terrible feeling that something is missing.  She checks her purse, she checks her keys, she counts her kids...\\".  I knew there was only one thing that could thwart this hellish malaise: lots and lots of little food boats bobbing on the beery sea currently at high tide in my tummy.  It is a credit to Dots that I slept soundly last night.  We're talking complete avoidance of a Dostoevskian would-be slumber lasting, apparently, forever, replete with panic, paranoia, cold sweat, and a general suspicion that things will never, ever be okay.  Whoopee!  It was pretty empty around 12:30 on a Monday--or rather, Tuesday--morning.  The wait gal refilled my water several times in quick succession for which I was grateful.  I got a bacon cheeseburger which I couldn't really see but which tasted just dandy, if on the well done side.  I think that if one could see one's food here some of the charm might be diminished.  It came with lettuce, tomato, pickles, and a garnish of celery, carrot, some dip, and a pepperoncini whose zesty juice I promptly managed to squirt into my contact-adorned eye.  Yeah, that was my fault.  My spicy fries also hit the spot, but this tofu dipping sauce love I cannot understand.  My friend and I drove there resolving to hit up a bank first, parked, realized we had forgotten to go to the ATM, went to the bank, drove back, parked, and then had to walk for several minutes when we realized that Dots was in fact several blocks away.

Lazy Wednesday night, and the spouse and I were bickering over which one of us lazy cusses was going to exert the effort required to pick up the effing phone and call someone for delivery.  The plan was to blow my diet -- and good!  We order Chinese once in a blue moon, and couldn't remember the last place we'd ordered from more than a year prior.  Cursing ourselves for it now...\\n\\nSo DH drew the short straw -- and after some Googling, called \\"Super\\" China.  Dammit.  It wasn't a complex order -- Beef and Broccoli for me and some tropical shrimp and candied walnut ridiculousness for my husband.  Egg roll.  You know.\\n\\nIt arrived hot, I'll give it that.  And promptly -- bonus points there, too.  Plenty of plastic cutlery, napkins, neon colored sauces, soy sauce packets, and oddly yellow fortune cookies.  If we had been caught unexpectedly on a desert island or the ruins of our burned-down house without cutlery or other dining niceties, Fair-to-Middlin' woulda had us covered.\\n\\nBut I don't care how hot you make it, the food just wasn't worth the buildup.  If I was going to blow a diet, I wanted eye-rolling, involuntary moans of pleasure-meriting culinary glory.  I wanted bliss.  But instead, it appears that our elementary school cafeteria ladies are pulling a second shift at Super China.  I love those ladies.  They're nice to my kids.  But their beef and broccoli tastes like a Stouffer's frozen entree -- like a salisbury steak and broccoli.  Not cool, cafeteria ladies.  Not cool at all.  I know you're working with limited resources, but if I'm going to get a hot pile of government surplus agricultural products instead of the Chinese delivery I was getting all amped about, then I want to pay $2.20 for it like my kids do at school.\\n\\nThe spouse was similarly underwhelmed with his tropical shrimp-n-whatever it was.  Is there even a tropical region of China?  I'm going to go look at a globe in a minute.  But here's the thing.  We're easy to please.  We haven't even been to China, so you won't catch us going on about how authentic or inauthentic a place is -- give me a break.  I was born in El Paso.  I have no idea.  I just wanted some flavors.  And beef that could, believably, be bovine in origin.  We're open-minded -- we'll try any dish once just to say we did.  But if we order beef-n-broccoli or shrimp-n-walnuts, no surprises, please.  And please don't depend on that double-helping of MSG to substitute for FLAVORS.  MSG can only enhance flavors that are actually in there -- not create absent ones.\\n\\nSo now I'm retaining water and swimming in excitotoxins for nothing.  Such a letdown.  Super China might be a better dine-in experience.  I imagine after you've picked up your bong and porn items for the week, or perhaps before, a nice dose of MSG-laced cafeteria fare hits the spot.  But next time I decide to self-sabotage, I'm calling Little China."},{"name":"Polaris Grill","address":"1835 Polaris Pkwy","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Had fish and chips here for lunch.

Was so psyched when I heard they were opening a location on Columbus, just a block away from work, because I've been to Davis for brunch and enjoyed it. Went for dinner with my boyfriend, sat outside to enjoy the last bit of nice weather, and literally everything we ate blew us away. \\n\\nFirst off, not a beer drinker, but according to him, they had a great beer list.\\nStarted with the brussel sprouts appetizer which was an explosion of flavors which blended together so nicely. HIGHLY recommend. If you think you don't like brussel sprouts, you're wrong, you will LOVE these. Cooked perfectly, charred just a bit to add flavor, the pickled apples are such a nice hint of sweet, everything about them was perfection.\\n\\nHe got the KFCGH - unreal. SO bad for you but SO SO good. The mac and cheese seriously raises the bar. I got the pork and again, all the right flavors, never had had grilled scallions before and I loved them. The coconut rice and mango salsa were such fresh and flavorful tastes - all in all, it was a VERY happy meal.\\n\\nOnly gripe was no dessert, but I'm hoping that's to come, and let's be honest, I didn't REALLY have room for it....but still, I like to humor the thought. Sangria was just alright, but I wouldn't hold it against them.

We got 2 half carafes of wine, good. Split the prosciutto & melon appetizer which was sweet and savory. She got a chicken dish that wasn't on the menu and loved it. I got the Scallops de Pesto which was top notch and a huge portion full of jumbo scallops and it was so good I ate it all. We finished with Frangelico cappuccinos and the ricotta cheesecake which was the perfect density.

There was already a wait, so there must be something to this place.  We got seated about 10 - 15 minutes later and got to look over the menu at length.  The staff is probably less than what is needed given the crowds, but they do a decent job.  My wife, who is definitely familiar with authentic Asian food, ordered her dish and we got some dumplings to share also.  It was a while before the food arrived, but we enjoyed it when it did.  I was not blown away by the dumplings (home-cooked are even better) but these were a step up from most restaurant fare.  My wife liked her beef-soup dish.  Our daughter then joined us after her separate visit to a ramen shop and she enjoyed the soup too.  \\n\\nWe passed this place later on after a walk over to Stanley Park.  At around 7:30 p.m. the line was out the door!  If you don't mind crowds and waits, and are particular about your Chinese food, this may be a good bet.

I've been having them all around town lately because I'm on sort of a chirashi kick.  And with little hesitation, I can tell you that this is the best chirashi I've had in the Orlando area so far.\\n\\nIf you haven't had it yet, chirashi is basically a selection of sashimi laid over a bowl of sushi rice and usually daikon radish.  What really sets this chirashi apart from the others I've tried is presentation and the sashimi selection.\\n\\nPresentation here at Sushi Katana has always been great, but this bowl is just plain beautiful.  I'm sad that I forgot to take a picture of it, but I definitely will next time. The sashimi included several pieces that are normally missing in the chirashi at other places.  Specifically squid, octopus, shrimp and tamago. This is in addition to the tuna, salmon, and other varieties of sashimi that you'd normally find in chirashi.\\n\\nI should also mention that while this past visit was for the chirashi that I'm rambling on about, I have also been here on multiple occasions for the maki and nigiri, and I have yet to have anything less than a great experience here."},{"name":"Gabriela's Downtown","address":"900 E 7th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Visiting Austin, I was craving margaritas and tacos, and I came across this restaurant tucked away on the edge of downtown. I couldn't resist ordering a fancy frozen marg served in a hollowed-our pineapple- it was a bit pricey but worth the money! I also ordered the choriqueso (a combination of all things wonderful- chorizo, cheese, guacamole, and salsa) and the beer-battered fried shrimp tacos, which were both very tasty. Of note, this place strikes me as a more \\"authentic\\" Mexican restaurant, meaning that if you prefer Tex-Mex you may not enjoy the food here. More starchy thick tortillas (not flour), a good kick of spice in a lot of the salsas and sauces, options such as mole sauces, etc. The portions also aren't huge here, so it was a bit expensive for the amount of food we received.

We ended of using a torch lighter for cigars. \\nThis is a family friendly atmosphere. You can smoke on the outside patio. They have live performers and the Sunday we went, the young lady was amazing. \\nI gave it 4 out of 5 stars because our server was very forgetful and would disappear for long periods of time.

I'll do an update when I get a chance to try the grub. Meanwhile, the bar is very small, not fitting for sports crowds, but looks like a bar trying to appeal to people watching the game.

One of the things that will stick out to you the most on this menu is just how creative everything is. This is not your typical taco place and any taco you get here you will probably not find anywhere else. My personal favorite is the tikka masala because it has just the right amount of spice and the rice is a really nice touch.

The party hostess was delightful and the kids had a good time. My first issue is that we ordered the personalized bowling pin and did not receive it as well as the free game of bowling that was included in the party package that we selected. I called to inquire when my daughter asked about it a few days later. The young lady on the phone asked me when I would be around to pick it up and I told her that this was their error and they should  mail it out to us as we live over 50 miles away.  I have yet to receive it. \\nThe other issues is that we reserved a 3:00pm party slot and, unbeknownst to us, Main Event had leased the entire facility out for the rest of the evening starting at 6:00pm so everyone in the facility had to be out by 6:50pm. This detail was revealed over the phone when I called to confirm the final attendance numbers three days prior to the actual party. I would have never been told if I'd chosen to firm up the details via email.  I felt that this news was casually sprung upon us and there was really nothing we could do at that point since the invitations had already gone out and all RSVPs received,. The result is that we felt a bit rushed to leave and the kids did not get to hang around like they expected. This is probably why the details of our party were botched due to the rushed nature of the occasion.  My husband witnessed some other families with later party start times who'd apparently just found out.
