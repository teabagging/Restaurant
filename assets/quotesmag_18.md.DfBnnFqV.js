You may remember me from such great reviews as: \\"Old Country Buffet: How to Get Your Money's Worth\\" and \\"Planet Fitness: the Workout Jungle.\\" I am certainly not a vegan, but I play one online, and I am here to tell you all about FoMu iced cream.\\n\\nIf you have spoken to more than ten people today, you probably have a vegan friend, and unless you were raised by wolves, you want to be considerate of their dietary restrictions. To an omnivore, most vegan food is punishment food. Faux beef, faux chicken, faux pastries and other vegetarian substitutes for sweet, delicious animal products are usually a huge disappointment. FoMu on the other hand is a pleasantly delicious surprise.\\n\\nFew people jump for joy to eat their vegetables. We all eat them though, because we know that they are important, right? I never had any gripe with vegetables that act like vegetables. Bean soups, and chilis are delicious. Smoothies are great. Even salads can be done right. Like most people, I have a problem when vegetarians try to trick me, and pass off vegetables as some thing else.\\n\\nYOU HEAR ME, VEGANS?! You are not fooling any one with your tofu, tempeh, and whatever else you try to flavor like beef. I have never had a good vegan cookie, and soy milk tastes weird. Play straight with me, and I play straight with you. We hold hands, eat a carrot, whatever. FoMu plays straight with you.\\n\\n\\"Vegan iced cream\\" implies that cream was the food source, so that is not right. \\"Frozen dessert\\" will have to do. So they make their dessert product from coconut milk rather than dairy milk, which sounds good in theory, but experience with vegan foods suggests disaster. Salted caramel is usually one of my favorite flavors, so I tried it out of curiosity, and confirmed that it was gross.\\n\\nI was ready to write off the whole restaurant, but I had some time to kill, so I tried their cookie dough flavor, and it was much truer to what I expect from traditional iced cream. I tried a few more flavors just to confirm, and was most pleased with their blueberry puree. It was downright great with a strong, fruity flavor, creamy texture and no dairy guilt.\\n\\nNormally I eat meat, and meat products with the best of them. I have vegan friends, and we can respectfully disagree on dietary choices for as long as we like, but I think that we have found common ground in desserts. If FoMu could compete with dairy for price in the supermarket then I would actually switch varieties all of the way."},{"name":"Evan's Deli","address":"252 Humphrey St","city":"Marblehead","stars":"3.5","text":"Can't get enough of Evan's deli.

The pho is definitely better than their vermicelli and their rice plates, but vermicelli and rice plates are my favorite Vietnamese dishes. It's always quite a conundrum to order. Although I always forget my own recommendations and get the lemon grass vermicelli, only to see it and become sorely disappointed. And then taste it and become even more disappointed. It is just so overwhelmingly mediocre, and doesn't taste anything of lemongrass. \\n\\nMy other huge problem with this restaurant is the customer service. If you aren't coming in with a large group (or $$$), you will get overlooked. So much so that they might not even bring you water and tea (this has happened to me multiple times).

I went with a friend of mine who generally prefers her food prepared very simply. She was willing to go with me to try something different. She tried researching beforehand, but they don't list their menu online because, apparently, it changes nightly. When we got there, we asked to see the menu which took a while. First, as we were looking over the drink menu, we were told that they only serve craft beer, \\"no Budweiser or Coors.\\" Great. I don't know what made them think that's what we drank. Anyway. Finally, we were handed two menus which we quickly perused and agreed to take a seat at one of several empty tables. After a few minutes, our server came over and asked if we had any questions. My friend explained that she was hoping to find something just kind of simple and plain. Our waiter reviewed several things on the menu that he described as \\"easy\\" but didn't seem to be at all what she was looking for. We kept the mood light, but our server was having NONE of it. When nothing immediately caught her eye, he said, \\"Well, maybe this isn't the best place for you then.\\" Wow. Really? So he left us alone for a while so he could help other guests. That's when my friend discovered poussin (chicken) on the menu. Great! She loves chicken! Of course it was topped with a few vegetables including okra which she doesn't care for. So when our server returned, and she attempted to inquire about the poussin, he explained that it was \\"a 28 day old chicken.\\" Oh yeah? Who cares? We're not the pretentious foodie types who are impressed with your random facts. Do I want to eat it? Does it taste good? That's all that matters. Well, when my friend asked if she could get the chicken without the vegetables on top (just on the side), you would have thought we asked them to make a special meal that wasn't even on the menu. The server went on about \\"our chefs!\\" and how the flavors are chosen and created. Who cares?! It's not what she wanted! Put the veggies on the side. But no. \\"We don't do that,\\" he replied. I asked about food allergies. He said they would accommodate that, but this wasn't a good allergy. He said that they would also accommodate a pregnant woman. Again, he suggested that we find another place to eat. Then he said, \\"You can either be a child or pregnant.\\" Yikes! That was followed by a long, uncomfortable silence. Then he told us he would let us think about it and walked away. Unbelievable. I guess they must be doing alright because they lost a table with that rude, stuck up attitude. When I lived in NYC, I ate in some very posh restaurants and never experienced this kind of condescending behavior. It's Winter Park. Not Paris. Reality check. We debated just getting wine, but then decided to take our business to one of the many restaurants right around the corner on Park Ave. I doubt I'll try to go back either.

The breakfast burrito at Cafe Ole is less than that and they make their tortillas/guac/salsa fresh - something I'm pretty sure doesn't happen at the grasshopper.\\n\\nAll in all, an ok place that could be better, but with the very few options available in Charlestown, an acceptable place to have breakfast from time to time."},{"name":"Jason's Deli","address":"4073 Lavista Rd","city":"Tucker","stars":"3","text":"What's not to love about this place?

The place was full, but not on a wait.  We walked in at 12:45 pm thinking it was plenty of time to eat and be out the door by 2.  Our server took 10 minutes bringing a water and coffee then another 10 to take our order. The food took 45 minutes!!!!  The only response I could get from our server was \\"we're just really busy\\" and \\"i'm sorry the kitchen is backed up.\\"  Do I care that you are really busy?  The kitchen should be staffed accordingly to get food out in an appropriate amount of time.  I ordered an omelet which didn't come with a few of the main ingredients - I asked the server about it and she brought them out to me on a side dish after I was 2/3 finished.  It's now 2:05 and my friend had to be to work by 2:30.  We asked for the check and left cash on the table.  After we walked out the door the server followed us out and said we had to pay our bill, the other servers told her \\"you better go get your table.\\"  I informed her we didn't have time to wait on her so we left cash on the table and maybe she should have looked there first."},{"name":"Murphy's","address":"997 Virginia Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Everything is delicious!

We had a bad experience:  after tasting a wine from the bar, we ordered a bottle.  The bottle was opened at the table and was off.  It was absolutely NOT like the wine we'd tasted moments earlier.  I asked our server to smell/taste both the sample she'd brought to our table and the wine she'd just poured.  She instead offered to get their \\"wine buyer\\" who came to our table to tell us he'd tasted the wine and it was fine; we just didn't know what we were tasting. I asked him to taste the wine we'd had from the bar and the wine in the glass from the new bottle to see the difference and, instead of even trying to placate us by doing that, he proceeded to tell me I didn't know what I was tasting.  He was quite rude and condescending and suggested we try a different wine.  Rather than spoil a very nice evening with arguing with this jerk, I agreed we'd get a different wine.  He never came back to our table to see if we were happy with the substitute.\\n\\nThis guy was so wrong about this wine and was very off-putting.  Even if I'd known nothing about wine, I thought the customer was always right...  but I do know about wine and tried to engage this guy in a reasonable conversation but he was so arrogant and unwilling to listen that it completely put our table off.  Rather than argue with him, I accepted the different wine.  I do know about wine as I am a professional wine judge and certified French Wine Scholar (this was a French wine).  I sent the restaurant an email but have yet to hear back from them.

But you don't get much for $20 bucks. A pretty small lobster roll, probably about the size of a hot dog bun, about 10 kettle cooked chips and a tablespoon or two of mac n cheese. I heard it was expensive and I get that they ship in fresh lobster but for $18-$20 I should feel like I've eaten more than a snack.

It kinda felt like they just took the name and messed up the menu. They took out like 90% of the old menu and added items that were just bad. Not sure why they decided that cause it seriously f*cked up the menu and I doubt I'll ever go back. Mind you this visit was two weeks ago and I was going to leave this alone but it kept coming back to me how awful this dining experience was I decided I had to write this review.\\n\\nMy friends and I ordered quite a few items from the menu and they all managed to taste awful with bad textures. We got the Bison Carpaccio, Quail, Squash Panzanella, Truffled Spaghetti with Meatballs, side of Fritto Cauliflower, and the Pasta Platter. \\n\\nThe Bison Carpaccio was good but it's kinda hard to screw that up unless it was not fresh or its cut too thick for some reason. I'm not sure why they chose the Tuscan Loaf out of all breads because it's such a thick cut of bread and it's kind of awkward to take a bite out of and drowns out the taste of the bison. \\n\\nThe second appy we got was the Quail. I don't eat quail too often but I'm pretty sure its supposed to taste something in between chicken and duck - it tasted bland. They only serve it with two tiny pieces so its definitely not big enough to share as the only appy for the night. The only good thing that came out of it was the gnocchi that accompanied it. \\n\\nAh the good ol' Truffled Spaghetti with meatballs, the dish you can always count on right? Nope. This time it seriously lacked the truffle taste I was really hoping for and not only that the tomato sauce was quite bland. The whole dish was super mediocre and definitely not what it was like before. If you're going to keep this from your old menu that should also mean maintaining the taste and consistency. \\n\\nTo be honest the only good thing that came out of this dinner was the Fritto Cauliflower. Cooked properly, flavor was how I imagined it to be, and I liked how they cooked the dish cauliflower two ways. \\n\\nI saved the best for last. DO NOT order the pasta platter. I'm not really sure if we even ate pasta or what it was. So the pasta consists of the Truffled Spaghetti (but we subbed it out for the Spaghetti Amatriciana), Torchio alle Verdure, and Fennel Pollen Casoncelli. The Spaghetti was bland but oddly enough it just tasted like olive oil, the Torchio was undercooked and tasted like Chinese food but it's an Italian dish?, and the Casoncelli was way too salty and pasta was undercooked. \\n\\nOn the bright side the service was good even though she would only ask \\"delicious?\\" every time she came around and that made things awkward for us lol I think as a server you should never ask a presumptuous question and ask a more general one. It's a bit cringey especially we've been leaving food behind on the other dishes and most definitely weren't shoveling the food in to our mouths. \\n\\nI would give this place one star actually but I do like the new location since it has higher ceilings and more open space than the old location."},{"name":"Barcelona","address":"263 E Whittier St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I have mixed feelings about this place.

I'd give the crust 4/5 stars, basil 1/5 due to scarcity, cheese 3/5 stars and sauce 2/5.

My husband kept bugging me to give it another try but i resisted as long as i could and then he finally convinced me to give it another chance.  Lucky for me, we got Elton as our waiter.  Wow, what a difference a waiter can make!  He was so good, so attentive and knowledgeable, and not too much.  I think the food tasted better too!  He really is an amazing waiter so now i call first to see if he is there so i can be seated in his station.  If he's not there, i don't go.

Perusing the small menu some more I decided to grab the roasted bone marrow appetizer with ham, cheese and a smoked honey mustard sauce topped with walla walla onions, fennel frawns and side of slightly charred bread. I'm not gonna lie but I would have preferred a little more S+P up on that thing to enhance the roasted flavor a little more, but it also wasn't that roasted. Just a tad under too. Other than that I loved the combinations of hearty, bite (from the Dijon), smoky, sweet and touch of acid that was compiled into the dish.

It was a vanilla almond macaroon about the size of a Hershey kiss. Not bad but little crunchy without the pillowy effect you would have from a normal sized one (half dollar size).

The lobster roll was huge and delicious, hands down one of the best lobster rolls I've ever had and they don't skimp out on the lobster. The Johnnycake was good, but once was enough for me. I would recommend it to try, but probably would not order again. Overall, Neptune Oyster is on the pricier end since our total came up to ~$87, but the experience, the quality of the food, and most importantly, the company of my partner made up for it."},{"name":"Pizza Hut","address":"2021B E Riverside Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"Ordered my pizza like I always do.

I came here for dinner for my birthday, which called for a updated review.\\nI made a reservation using Opentable, which only allowed for a maximum of 8 people. I commented on the available comment section asking for 9, which they allowed without making a fuss. \\nWe walked in right at 7:30 on a rainy day. There is complimentary valet parking, but we decided to park a little down the street to avoid the fee.\\nWe were seated in a crowded dark corner, but we didn't mind, as long as we could all be seated together. The seats on the outside of the table seemed to leak into the walkway, which made for some uncomfortable shifting when servers or other restaurant patrons tried to pass.\\nThe server brought out complimentary bread shortly after we made our order. She poured us olive oil to dip it in, which we could add freshly ground pepper and salt to. The bread crust was a little drier than I would have hoped, but our hungry stomachs didn't complain as we asked for a refill.\\nI ordered the Guinness braised beef brisket, which sounded mighty tasty. After tasting my friend's flash fried calamari - she claimed it was the best calamari she has ever had, and I have to agree, it was quite good, I tasted another friend's fries, which came with her burger. I am quoting her words, that they tasted like McDonalds fries but with fresh potatoes (and that's a compliment, by the way). I was highly anticipating the taste of my brisket at this point. The brisket was a little dry, while I would have hoped for some melt in your mouth, tender meat. The flavors, however, were quite good, with the peculiar taste of the horseradish mashed potatoes and the sweetness of the roasted carrots. I switched out my green beans that came as a side with the dish for $2 more for the Truffle Mac and Cheese. I was slightly disappointed, but I cannot complain. There was barely a drop of truffle flavoring in the macaroni, and it became drier and drier as it continued to bake in the hot cast iron ramekin. Truffle oil always overwhelms a dish, which in this case it thankfully did not. However, I also could barely taste any trace of truffle.\\nAt the end of the meal, my friends ordered me a slice a cake, which turned out to be complimentary, and provided a candle and birthday song, mostly sung by my friends. \\nThanks to a great birthday dinner, it definitely provided for good conversation and a good time, I was just expecting more from a restaurant that many claim have one of the best brunches in Atlanta."},{"name":"Little Bird Bistro","address":"215 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"this review is for happy hour only...\\n\\nroasted bone marrow with the orange marmalade was the best marrow i ever had! not bad for $9 during happy hour.

Not only was it well executed, nice looking, and delicious, it was also different. I tried 6 of their crudo dishes and while I enjoyed all of them, the Maine Halibut really stood out. It elevated a simple cucumber to new heights. \\n\\nThe prosciutto di parma was melt-in-your-mouth paper-thin. I also really enjoyed the different pasta dishes I tried. All of the noodles were cooked to al dente perfection. The sausage orecchiette were a bit salty, but satisfying. The mushroom tagliolini and squid ink spaghetti were simple and tasty. My favorite dish was the beef cheek pappardelle with just enough gorgonzola dolce for a surprising little twist. \\n\\nNow onto service. This place is not cheap, and with such a price tag come certain expectations. The first red flag was when the staff person who took us to our table was wearing stretched, faded out t-shirt, old jeans, and dirty sneakers. I don't mind casual, but this was unprofessional and not neat. Our main server while friendly, was perhaps stretched a little thin and not really on top of things. A few more cocktails might have been ordered with a bit more attention. I also didn't think the long booths really work for this type of restaurant. Beautiful food getting passed down several hands loses some of its wow factor. It also complicates clearing dishes. The servers were also not the most professionally trained. Nothing like stacking a bunch of dirty dishes right in front of customers to really bring down the experience. \\n\\nIt is a shame really. The food is great, but without the service to back it up, I can only recommend the place for very casual, informal gatherings.  \\n\\n\\n\\nRant on kitchen administrative fees:\\n\\nSo this restaurant (and apparently several others in Boston) are now charging a 3% \\"kitchen administration fee\\". They try to explain the rationale on their website, but I do not agree with their reasoning. They argue that this is a way to offer more fair wages to back of the house staff. \\n\\nI think it instead does two other things. First, it is anti-consumer. It hides real prices from consumers. Consumers are already mislead by having to pay semi mandatory service fees disguised as \\"tips\\" and taxes not reflected on menu prices. Now add 3% to your bill. \\n\\nSecond, it is anti-employee. Owners argue that is for the benefit of staff, but instead it removes risk from the restaurant and passes it onto the individual employees. Want to pay a fair wage? Then pay a fair wage. Tying fair compensation to revenue means that if the restaurant is not doing well, employees don't get paid what they deserve. Want to provide bonuses based on revenue? GREAT! This can be done completely internally without hiding real prices from consumers. \\n\\nPerhaps we should expect a marketing team administration fee on our bill next year. \\n\\nEnd of rant."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Delicious.

Fries are fresh cut, great flavor; good onion rings and  fried pickles as well. Oh, and you should try the breakfast fries!\\n It is definitely a cozy place as it's not real big.

Don't waste your time or your money there.\\n\\nI went with a friend and we ordered the chips guacamoli and salsa as an appetizer. The chips were fine but the salsa had an over-whelming vinegar taste. The guac was awful. It was shiney like it was ready to turn and it tasted very strongly of vinegar, like the salsa. We ended up just eating the chips.\\n\\nMy entree was the chicken burrito. To say it was disgusting is an understatement. The chicken was spoiled. It tasted and smelled rotten. I had my friend taste the chicken and she had to spit it out. She also agreed that it smelled spoiled. She has sold meat, poultry and fish to the food service industry for several years and so she knows when chicken is fresh or spoiled. It was definitely spoiled!\\n\\nOur waiter was very nice but not around very often, despite the fact that there were only about 10 people in the restaurant. So, I got up and found him and told him what was wrong. He asked if I would like something else but I was apprehensive to order anything else since everything had tasted so bad (except the chips).\\n\\nMy friend was not able to eat her food either. They ended up charging her for her meal and both of our drinks.\\n\\nThe kicker was that the owner/manager stood at the register while we were paying and argued with me about the chicken in the burrito. He said that \\"there was nothing wrong with that chicken\\". and blamed me for just not liking the sauce. (There was no sauce). I also pointed out that my friend agreed that it tasted bad and we both could smell that it was spoiled. He continued to argue with us and began to get really nasty about it so we hurried out the door. He was getting creepy.\\n\\nThe waiter was very embarassed and apologized to us. (He needs to polish up on his serving skills and find another job elsewhere). That owner/manager is very beligerate and  defensive. If that's his attitude then he is going to continue to put out bad food and make someone very sick! \\n\\nI am guessing others have had bad experiences because it was almost empty in there at noon on a Sunday, when the other restaurants in the area (that were opened) were crowded.\\n\\nDon't go there!

So on the last day of my trip, I yelped Lobster Rolls in Boston and quickly found Neptune.  Courtesy of a previous yelp review, I had read \\"you can get the Lobster Roll hot with butter or cold with mayo.\\"  Instantly I was sold.  Lobster Roll! WITH BUTTER! AWESOME!\\n\\nSo for lunch, my girlfriend and I rushed over to North End and had to try the Lobster Roll.  When we got there, we got seats at the bar, which wasn't exactly what we preferred, but since we were hungry and cold, we didn't think too much of it.  So we ordered a bowl of clam chowder to share and two Lobster Rolls (hot of course).  The clam chowder isn't exactly like your typical clam chowder.  It had more of a classical taste, where you can definitely taste the clams in the soup, and it wasn't a thick soup, pretty liquidy.  This was just okay, it didn't exactly satisfy my need for clam chowder, but this wasn't the reason we chose Neptune.\\n\\nThe Lobster Rolls came out, not exactly what I had imagined when I had ordered \\"Lobster Roll - Hot with Butter.\\"  It came out, with a roll, overflowing with magical lobster.  As I see this, I think, WOW! AWESOME! LOOK AT ALL THAT LOBSTER! then to my next thought... HEY! WHERE'S THE BUTTER!  Ah, but foolish me, the butter was already poured on top of the lobster into the roll, which gave the roll a very soft buttery taste.  I quickly began to eat my lobster roll, only stopping to scarf up the pieces of lobster that had overflown the roll and fallen to my plate.  All the while, scraping the plate for the fallen \\"juices\\" (which was really just the butter and lobster juice) with my roll to soak up every single bit.  This was truly an awesome sandwich.  On top of this, I ordered mine with fries, my girlfriend ordered hers with a salad.

It's here...at 50/50 and I am pleased.\\n\\nThe mint tasted alot like you would find mint leaves in your teeth but it was good.\\n\\nAfter sampling the chocolate malted ice cream I immediately skipped over dish and cone and went straight for a pint. I didn't care. I wanted it in a gallon and I would have bought it if it were available.\\n\\nI want to go back. I want to go back right now.\\n\\nA new ice cream place opened up down the street and so when we went back to the neighborhood we tried that one instead. BIG MISTAKE.... it looked good but the ice cream there was so sweet it made my mouth icky. Don't make my mistake. Eat your ice cream at lovely 50/50.\\n\\nP.S. I wonder what else they have! (see below to  find out!)\\n\\nREVIEW FOR VISIT ON 7/29/10:\\n\\nWe were back on Mississippi street to visit Blue Sky Wellness (who, BTW, have reduced price community hours for their naturopath Dr. woot!) and I had to go back to Lovely 50/50. Thankfully, this time we were hungry for food and so had an excuse to try the regular menu. \\n\\nThe menu is limited but the choices that ARE there are really unique and wonderful. They basically have great salads and pizza. The only thing is that you can't get a side salad... all the salads are in the $8 range so more like an entree price in my book. Unfortunately, the size of the salad is not entree. Happily, the quality and tastiness of the food made the price bearable.\\n\\nWe had the fried green tomato salad and the taste of the cornmeal crusted tomato's was exquisite. My daughter hit it when she said they kind of taste like artichoke hearts... they're like savory, buttery, wet, crunchy little bits of heaven. On this side is small handful greens lightly dressed in a very yummy vinaigrette which I should have asked for the recipe on. The size of this dish was it's only downfall. We got like 4 slices of tomato about 4.5 inches in diameter along with the tiny salad. It was supposed to be served with arugala but I'm not a fan and told the waitress so she asked the chef and they switched it out for regular salad greens which were really good. I just think they could have put more on the plate.\\n\\nWe split the salad and a pizza (12\\" is the standard size). Qutite a few of the items on the pizza list were really foreign to me WHICH IS AWESOME because how cool is it when you get to learn something new!?? Very cool, IMO. We chose a baked potato pizza with some sort of panetta type of meat on it (that I didn't see but I think was thinly sliced and just added a salty element). The sauce was ...well, I'm not sure if there was a sauce, which is fine by me, since I prefer a white or olive oil sauce to red any day. \\n\\nThe pizza was pretty good.. the crust was thin but substantial - no cracker crust here. But, honestly, the pizza was tiny bit dry. I ordered a side of creme fraiche which helped. The overall flavor was really good though and I would eat it again. \\n\\nOf course we took home another pint of Chocolate malted ice cream and even though I wanted 2 pints of it my daughter talked me into the chocolate cherry almond which was also very nice (huge dried cherries... good cherries, not maraschino stupid cherries.)\\n\\nI love this place. Plus, the wait staff are ultra friendly (especially the ice cream scooper guy!) and warm. We are big fans!\\n\\nPRICE RANGE:\\n\\nIce cream = $2-$5 for scoops. $6.50 for a pint\\nSalads = around $8\\nPizza's = around $15 (big enough for two people)"},{"name":"Wild Wood Bakehouse","address":"3016 Guadalupe St, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Awesome bakery for gluten free sweets.

I sent her a list of places that I had bookmarked and have been meaning to try.  She decided on Little Bird, it's a sister restaurant of Le Pigeon, yet menu items are at a more affordable price.\\n\\nWe arrived to the restaurant around 12:15pm, about 45 minutes after it had opened for lunch.  Lucky for us, there wasn't a wait and got seated immediately.  I was checking in on yelp and the waiter wanted me to comment on my review about his new haircut, it was nice--there you go. We were put at a table very close to another party with only a low partition between us...it was slight awkward when you are trying to catch up with your friend and overhearing someone else's personal conversation or them talking about a subject you had just brought up.  It's a very intimate setting!  However, I love the style of the restaurant, not the typical French Bistro but had a downtown loft look.  \\n\\nThe food!  My friend chose to do the Prix Fixe menu, three dishes for $25 which included the daily special which was a duck heart ragu with arugula.  I opted for the bone marrow and the goat cheese gnocchi with the braised oxtail.  That way, we could try a little of everything.  I don't liked french onion soup--nope, never have.  Today, Little Bird changed my mind.  In general, I am not a big fan of onion but I found it delectable in the soup and the broth was rich with flavor.  I love bone marrow, when my mom makes Pho with beef bones and try to discard it after the soup is finished...I am standing over the sink fishing out of the bone the deliciousness that is the marrow.  The way it was prepared at the restaurant had a beautiful texture and just luscious.  The squid ink bread and pickled peppers mellow out the richness.  The gnocchi is a must try because the creaminess of the goat cheese complimented the braised oxtail meat and potato dumplings perfectly.  Dessert fell flat for us, we chose the macarons to-go.  So disappointed, it was petite chocolate-mint flavored macarons and not too impressive.  We were jealous of the dessert we saw our neighbors eating and wished we picked that.  \\n\\nLe Petit Oiseau, you earned your spot at the top of my list of favorite restaurants for the moment.

During recent business travel I ate here a few times with the group I was with, so I had the opportunity to try several dishes, and to get a sense of the quality of the service. Portions are massive; often extreme. For instance, the Ruben is presented as an open face with what must exceed a pound of meat. The beef rib is gigantic. They don't offer a lunch portion menu, so based on the massive portions, you will have lunch leftovers. Massive doesn't, however, doesn't always mean good. For instance, the steak sandwich includes a solid steak that has not had the fat trimmed off on a French roll. It was unpleasant to deal with the fat and gristle, uncut, chewy and tough steak. On the same sandwich, the tomatoes were very over-ripe to the point of tasting rotten. I would have returned it but I was with a group of ten people on a limited time lunch, and the service was so slow with infrequent check-ins, that I just didn't have the time. At the same lunch visit, three of my coworkers had wrong or missing parts of their orders. One ordered soup and salad, but the soup never arrived despite two requests. Another had ordered steak salad but got chicken instead. A third ordered pasta with white sauce, but got red sauce. Again, it took so long for the food to come out that these errors didn't get corrected. Once the food was dropped off, the wait staff became distant. On another visit I ordered the prime rib sandwich, and the meat was well done and dry; not at all what one would expect. When I further inquired if it would be possible to get another with less cooked prime rib, the waiter said that it only was available well done.

Great online ordering system. We got the Mustafar II (meatballs, spinach, portobellos, parmesan, red sauce, and ghost pepper salami--which is basically the best idea ever), the Great Deku (an excellent margherita, nice and saucy with delicious fresh mozz and their great beer crust), and the dessert pizza of the week, the Cortana (white crust, cinnamon-sugar drizzle situation on the bottom, plus blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, and bananas. No sign of the advertised vanilla icing, but I hardly cared). It was delivered in sixty minutes on the nose by a totally adorable young woman, it was hot, and it was SO GOOD. It's pricey compared to more basic pizza joints, but given the quality (and holy sh*t, the QUANTITY) of the ingredients, I'll happily shell out.

Although, if you have more than 4 people in your party I would suggest ordering more than one.  \\n\\nI would also highly suggest the salmon entree, it's completely worth the extra cost (and hey, you could get chicken tacos anywhere, right?).  The fish was cooked perfectly and paired with a slightly fruity mole sauce, corn, and grilled pineapple.  It also came with rice and black beans, which were different from what I expected but really tasty.  The portion's not huge...

In the mean time, friends at the bar line weren't getting any luck -- the bartender ask for tips (or no drink), takes the tips, puts his fingers in your liquor and hand it over the bar. -- very insanitary. In fact, the entire restaurant is very dark and everything gives your a out-of-maintenance and insanitary feeling.

The lobster roll was so warm, buttery and delicious.  The lobster juices and the butter made the roll soggy though so I had to eat it with a fork and knife. The fries were made from real potatoes.

I'm usually not a huge smoked fish fan, but it was super great. The guy said it was the best smoked trout he'd ever had and loved the accoutrements.

I couldn't say no to the Korean fried chicken--it was so spicy but I couldn't stop eating it and basically was crying into the bowl. In the best way.

The appearance and decor fits the cuisine served. Definitely enjoyed the over-sized booths they have a the place. We were greeted upon entering the restaurant and seated rather quickly although we decided to dine pretty early in the evening so there wasn't a wait. The bar is big and stocked with an awesome design to it. As for the service, we had to wait just a tad longer than you would expect on a waiter to tend to us. However, she apologize for the wait so all was forgiven. I started out with an apple butternut squash soup and the table was served both rolls and cornbread. The cornbread was good, warm and not too sweet which I like and butter was served with the bread. My appetizer I wasn't a fan of. Maybe it was just a bad batch, but it had a burned taste to it and came out darker than you would think. Therefore, I didn't enjoy it like I thought I would. Also, unless you're a sour cream fan, I don't recommend it in this dish. It gave the entire dish a weird texture and taste as well. For the entree, I ordered the beef short ribs. The flavor profile was darn good, but it lacked on the tenderness side of the house. The rib gave way when pulling it with a fork, but not completely so I had to use a knife one in a while to separate the beef. Again, maybe it's just me, but I like my short rib to be fork tender. Nonetheless, very minor detail nothing serious. The short rib itself was flavorful. It came with pimento grits and braised collards as well. I'm not a huge fan of pimento cheese however, surprisingly, I did like the way it was presented and taste. When ordering, I was close to substituting the sides for something else, but I was glad I didn't. Plus, I don't like to substitute unless necessary. I a strong proponent of eating what's been prepared because it was put that way for a reason. Another positive note, at least the place is accommodating and willing to substitute sides upon request. The braised collards were your run of the mill collards, so I was happy with them and the sauce which came with the entree complimented the meal very well.

The carving station has excellent ham and prime rib. The entr√©es were hot and the cold foods were fresh and had fast turnover, so nothing was limp or gross or smelly. \\n\\nEven their dessert bar was fantastic. Most places have just mini versions of desserts, but Portland City Grill had a good mix of small dessert shots with regular-sized cupcakes and lava cakes. \\n\\nThere were a few things that keep it from being 5 stars, all minor and just preferential. First, the placement of the buffet tables along with foot traffic, made it a bit of a tight squeeze to get around. Second, the kitchen took a little while to get our Benedict and waffle entr√©es out. Finally, we did have one helping of crab legs that were really salty for some reason. It made me pucker, haha.

With that said my favorites are Kumamoto, kushi and cotuit. \\n\\nI'd say this place is pretty up there with Old Ebbitt Grill in DC, worth checking out for locals and tourists."},{"name":"The Ramenman","address":"841 Bidwell Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I went here unexpectedly with some friends after we discovered we couldn't eat at Motomatchi (broth was chicken + pork + shellfish).

Apparently it's safe to eat (they explained it thoroughly when we asked); but I don't like slimy textures. They graciously offered (and did anyway) to bring us fully cooked chicken.

It's awesome to be able to go to a place like this that isn't your run-of-the-mill TeX Mex. Instead, they feature a combo of Mexican and middle Eastern ingredients, and they go really well together.

My friends and I ordered 3 and we wanted more. The size for the soup dumplings were just right to fit in one bite. The perfect thickness of the dumpling skin led to a great balance between the soup and stuffing. It is one of the most difficult dish to make, because it's such a delicate dish.

Followed by a gourmet short rib burger and crispy pork belly.

Considering how much I love BBQ, that really sucks, but it also means I get really excited when I do find a spot that is both legit and delicious. Redbones mixes love of BBQ with love of the South, and the result is worthy of a BBQ aficionado.\\n\\nRedbones has a number of appetizers, but my favorite is the fried pickles and jalapenos. You get a nice basket of both pickles and jalapenos fried in a tasty batter with just a little bit of kick that isn't too heavy. It is served with their house made tartar which seemed a bit odd to me the first time, but it pairs with them perfectly.\\n\\nMy go to main course is the Barbecue Belt since it gives me a nice sampling of most of the smoked meat options. It includes 1 Texas Beef Rib, 2 St. Louis Ribs, 2 Baby Back Ribs, sliced brisket and house smoked sausage. The beef rib and St. Louis ribs are dry rubbed while the baby backs are sauced. The baby backs are my favorite, as they are fall off the bone good. Both the dry rub ribs happened to be a bit dry but still tasted very good. On my previous visit they were not dry so I will write this off as an anomaly. The brisket was very tender and could be cut with a fork (always a good sign!), and the smoked sausage had a very nice seasoned flavor. All the meat had a great smoky flavor and nice smoke ring, evidence that this is BBQ done right. One thing I love is that they don't serve the meat with sauce but provide both sweet and spicy BBQ sauce on the table. This is always a great sign and shows that they believe the meat stands on its own (which it does!). With that said, the spicy BBQ sauce is fantastic and complements the smoky meat nicely, and I happily lathered it on after tasting each meat independently in an unsauced state.\\n\\nThe Belt came with 2 sides. I had a lot of difficulty deciding but finally went with the collards and BBQ beans. The collards were very tender and had a nice garlic and butter flavor. The BBQ beans were hearty with a nice smoky flavor, and they had bits of meat throughout. My son had the mac and cheese, which had made my top 3 but not the final cut, and I tried some of it as well. It was very cheesy and quite good, definitely a southern style mac and cheese. Overall the sides that I have had are really good, and they have quite the selection to choose from.\\n\\nI had never had dessert at Redbones, but on this occasion I decided to try the banana pudding, and there was also an order for the honey custard pie. The banana pudding had a bit of a different flavor than usual, though it was definitely banana, and the consistency was more custard-like than pudding like. It was very smooth and creamy and tasted quite good. The honey custard pie was somewhat similar to a butter chess pie, though it was quite a bit sweeter and had a less firm custard texture. It was also delicious!\\n\\nRedbones gets busy, particularly on the weekends. They have both an upstairs and a downstairs. Going downstairs seems to stress the \\"bones\\" part of the name more with a lot of fun skulls and bones images throughout. We sat upstairs this time, and it had more of the typical busy smallish restaurant feel. It does get noisy, particularly with the bar next to it, but we were still able to enjoy our food and conversation. The prices on the food seemed quite reasonable, and the portions were a great size. Redbones isn't the best BBQ I have had, but it is at the top of the heap for New England thus far. Add the additional Southern feel to the menu, and it is truly a gem. Or perhaps that is a bone...a solid bone. Get your BBQ on and eat yourself some Redbones."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Everything we ate here was SO good!!!  We came in on a Wednesday at around 4:30pm, so there was no wait or overcrowded tables.  It was really relaxed and our food came right away.  Our waitress was so nice and was quick with getting our orders and refilling our water.  We had the johnnycakes with trout and sturgeon caviar and the special Kombu and citrus cured salmon with ginger soy to start.  Then we tried the Hot lobster roll, because of all the yelp reviewers loving it.  The hot lobster roll was so buttery and they did not skimp on the lobster (huge chunks piled super high).    I would have to agree with the other reviewers, the fries that came with the roll were soggy and oddly dark brown, but we finished them.  We also had to get oysters, because it is an oyster bar after all.  The Well Fleet and Bee's River were very buttery and full of flavor and I can't wait to go back to order them again.

It has some improvements to make.\\n\\nWe didn't have a reservation, but the host could have handled it better.  To counter balance that, the service from the bar staff was great and proactive.\\n\\nRestaurant is loud, and gets louder as the evening wears on.  Nothing, absolutely nothing--other than patrons' clothes--to absorb sound.  Nice vibe over all.  Though one of the single-use bathrooms was out of order, thus a wait for the loo.  Not good.\\n\\nOur first two choices from the wine list, the restaurant was out of. . .but the Portuguese wine we chose afterwards was quite good.\\n\\nYou will likely enjoy food, but you may be surprised how much of it is finger food.  And yes, the portion size, or rather lack of, will shock as well.  The chicken was really really nice, but a portion saw four small legs--essentially hors d'oeuvres size. . .And the dessert, a chocolate cake with Moretti's salt-caramel ice cream, was toy sized.  I've seen larger free samples at Whole Foods.\\n\\nNote to restaurant:  some of the portions verge on laughable if you weren't paying for them.  Since you are, it is insulting.  \\n\\nSecond note to restaurant:  Ribs, chicken on bone, fries, arancini are all finger food.  Particularly on a night when half your bathrooms are out of service, you may want to bring a warm towel to the table for patrons' fingers.  The rib joint around the corner does that--a more upscale spot should do that instinctively.\\n\\nI'd return to The Sound Table, but I really hope that they get their act together.

I had the fusilli and it was much much creamier than I expected, but nevertheless delicious! It had fava beans and pecorino cheese, and some sort of roasted garlic I think. I had a few bites of my boyfriend's octopus and I found that it was easily comparable to a scallop wrapped in bacon, but did seem like it was fried (so keep that in mind if you're trying to veer towards the healthier side). For dessert, my boyfriend and I shared the mousse al cioccolato and it was so so good. Although the \\"coffee gelato\\" that accompanied the chocolate mousse cake had no trace of coffee flavor and was rather chalky while eating it.

The beignets are good on their own and come with a huge amount of powder sugar.

The chicken was tender and moist, the breading was crisp and tasteful, perfect texture taste and sound (crunch) in every bite. When it first comes out, it might look small but don't let that fool you, its pretty tall as well with everything stacked up. It is very filling and although I was full halfway through, I could not stop eating it...I know shame on me but if I die, I would have died with a huge satisfied grin on my face. \\n\\nI also ordered the hush puppies as well. They were made with chives and served with a red sauce that had a little kick to it. Nothing too spicy, but an interesting combination to be sure. To be honest, I was not really impressed. Perhaps mine was an off batch but the combination of the chives and spices in this side dish was not impressive to me. I also felt that the hush puppies were too soft inside, almost dough as if they needed to cook a little longer. \\n\\nThe restaurant has very limited seating, both indoor and outdoor, I have heard it is a very popular place so if you are gonna try and eat at this place arrive early. I did with a couple of friends and was served right away. It very environmental friendly and the customer service was friendly and polite. Overall, a great experience and a satisfied belly. =)"},{"name":"Jam On Hawthorne","address":"2239 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Jam is a cute place to meet your girlfriends for brunch or a place to go solo with a newspaper.

The benton bacon, which should've been the star of the show, was a very thick cut, dry smoked, but otherwise flavorless and textureless hunks of ham.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, the jumbo sammich makes for very beautiful presentation and I don't mind diving into such a beast if you come through on flavor - this just fell way short.  \\n\\nMy daughter ordered the Waikiki burger.  When her gynormous entree arrived (again, looking delish) her words were not of excitement, but \\"how am I supposed to eat that?\\"  Who wants to knife and fork a burger? You end up missing some key flavor in each bite when you face such a monumental stack of ingredients.  At the end of the day, she said it was okay, but just had too much going on.\\n\\nSo, if you can unhinge your jaw, you may enjoy this place.

Super soft, warm, gooey in the places it needs to be. Very impressed, hands down best cookie in Austin. There's not much space inside the establishment so expect to take it to go.

Really wanted to give this place a good review especially because of the attentiveness of our initial server.  \\n\\nWe came here after work was told it would be more than an hour wait.  My date suggested going to the Deschutes brewery which I was actually excited about.  We went there and the atmosphere was much more of what I was looking for not to mention there was only about a 20 minute wait.  I hadn't eaten most of the day at work in anticipation of going to dinner later that day - I was literally starving.  \\n\\nJust as we were about to be seated at Deschutes we got a call from Tasty that they were ready to seat us.  My date says let's go back to TastyNAlder.  I went along and unfortunately was disappointed with the experience.  When we got back to alder we were seated on a corner row with very little to no lighting.  I had to use my IPhone to read the menu when I learned the place is not very vegan/vegetarian friendly.  There really aren't any vegetarian options other than potatoes, greens, or some other rare side item.  \\n\\nAfter our initial server we had 2 other servers come by that were preoccupied with other tables.  When I got the salad that I didn't really want but was pretty much forced to get due to the limited vegetarian options I noticed the salad had no seasoning and they didn't even provide any dressing.  I waited to eat mainly because my date hadn't gotten her food but once it arrived learned how really inattentive the servers were.  After about another 10 minutes we finally got another server who offered to redo the salad, why I have no idea just wanted seasoning and dressing.  Another 15 minutes elapsed got the salad with dressing then ate.  \\n\\nThe food was bland, very mediocre, and small portioned.  It literally tasted like a bag of salad you'd buy from Walmart eaten from the bag.  The place caters more to meat eating groups that order in teams rather than a small pair trying to share a relaxed evening after work that wanted vegan food options. \\n\\nLastly, when we got the bill they had two line items for the kitchen and the wait servers.  I understand making the patron aware of all that have to share off the tip but I have mostly tipped based on the service received and the percentage of total bill amount due.  Not sure if the goal was more so to increase tips or to notify patrons of the sharing of tips between staff other than the servers.  The positive: small intimate and exclusive atmosphere, an attentive initial server, accessible location in the city,  and good atmosphere for conversation. The negative:  unusually longer wait, limited vegan options, confusing dual tip lines on bill, and inattentive wait staff (didn't check on us the whole time)."},{"name":"Maitland Breakfast Club","address":"745 Orienta Ave","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"4","text":"First time going to this place today.

I got chicken fried steak and was really disappointed by the quality compared to a place like crackerbarrel. This felt like it was a premade frozen chicken fried steak from Walmart or something.

All fresh and the descriptions were spot on, a wide variety. \\n\\nI have only 2 caveats. 1. On busy days/nights, get a second oyster shucker because even though the place is small, oyster lovers and foods flock to it and it's packed.

I ordered the Thursday special, Shrimp and Grits. Having visited Georgia and South Carolina, I was excited to see Shrimp and Grits on the menu in Boston despite the obnoxious price tag. I honestly believe the components were really well done. My issue is that there was so much Cajun-spiced sauce that it took away from the grits. I could not taste the creamy grits in their classic form.  The flavors were there but it was drowning in sauce. It overwhelmed every thing. If that sauce switched from the 40% of the dish that it was to the 15% it should be,,,it would be a knockout. I couldn't finish it.

The only downside was there was almost too much flavor going on with my dish.  My fellow diners also enjoyed their meals - they were fans of the lobster roll, the burger was rated well too - but a little over salted.

Don't bother trying the fried crab claws, the stuffed crab shells, or any of the hot crab items. All those items either taste of a bad mix of cheese and mayo or are so heavily breaded that you're just eating bread. The dim sum items are pretty standard, nothing to rave about and nothing to bash either because it is a buffet and not a resturaunt. The stuff that you usually find at at fast food chinese places like the general tso's, beef and broccoli or friend chicken wings stuff is good.\\n    Along the back wall are stations for pho noodle soup and hibachi. Unfortunately I didnt get around to trying those because just trying all the other items filled me up too much. \\n   The sushi bar is nothing special.  Actually I'd say to just avoid it all except for the fried rolls. The others are all pretty bland and are there to just fill you up really. The sashimi is pretty much fast buffet quality, in other words don't expect anything special. The soups are also pretty standard except that the ingredients all taste like they've been sitting there too long, especially the seafood soup. \\n   For around 8 bucks I'd say it's a decent deal for a buffet.

If you're reading this and you've already decided to go, and you already have your reservation made, just do it - don't listen to anyone else.\\n\\nBut, for those curious, here's my experience.\\n\\nThe place is small.  Like, can't-not-eavesdrop-on-conversations-on-either-side-of-me-if-I-tried small.  Lord help you if you're sitting a table next to a loud talker.  \\n\\nThe waitstaff is attentive, but unbelievably quiet.  Also, if possible, equally nervous and pretentious?  It's weird.  The whole place kind of screams pretentious to me, but I can handle it if their food is good.\\n\\nAnd boy is their food good.  I was nervous on this front, too, because when you're jumping into fancy schmancy gourmet food and you KNOW you're not going to leave full and you are going to leave without any money in your wallet/bank account, all the pennies are in the flavor basket.  And WOW did they deliver on that front.\\n\\nRemember that when you go to a place like this, you're going to get lots of little dishes in between the ones you actually order.  They're super fun, and tasty!  I'm not going to describe them, though, cause half the fun of it is the surprise.\\n\\nThe breads brought out after we ordered were hearty and tasty.  The sea bread didn't blow me away, but it was good, and a nice change from the typical.\\n\\nNOTE - They no longer do half portions of entrees for a lower price.  I was really sad when I saw this cause I was so excited to try a bunch of things, but you now can't really do that here without seriously depleting your funds.  Also, I think they only have a cordials license.  No cocktails and limited apertif/digestif menu.\\n\\nWe ordered:\\n-Four course tasting for $70 for one person.\\n-One entree for the other person\\n-Two house made sodas (super sweet - be warned - but good)\\n-One dessert for the other person\\n-One hot chocolate & one coffee\\n\\nI believe the total BEFORE tip (and note, no alcohol) was around $135, so just a fair warning so you know what you're getting into.\\n\\nThe Poached Harvard Beets dish was excellent.  Bright, clean flavors, with just a touch of cream, and an awesome barley salad underneath.  \\n\\nThe Washed Rind Cheese Custard Tartine - oh man, I think this was the standout dish of the night for me.  The plate was littered with these delicious little vegetables, and phenomenal-tasting polenta cubes - but oh, man, that cheese tartine.  The pistachio crust was super delicious, and the custard was so pungent and cheesey - you gotta be a strong cheese fan to like this, and I am indeed.\\n\\nThe Roasted Angus Beef Bavette was good - perfectly cooked, nice temperature, and great flavors.  Overall the dish was a little sweet because it highlighted figs, but I liked it.  And again their complements - the spelt berries and the kale - were equally as awesome as the beef.\\n\\nThe Chicken Galantine was a bit of a miss for me - the chicken was super juicy, but almost slightly undercooked in that it was oddly soft, and the skin wasn't crispy at all.  The waffle was underwhelming, though the beans and summer squash were delicious.\\n\\nThe desserts - OH. MAN.  And I am a dessert SNOB - completely, entirely, thoroughly.\\n\\nThe hot chocolate (don't miss it - it's on the drink menu, not on the dessert menu) was absolutely amazingly awesome, totally due to their house made spiced marshmallows.  I kept remarking while drinking it that all I wanted to do in that moment was curl up on my couch in my pajamas.  Could I take it home with me?  My boyfriend wouldn't let me ask.\\n\\nHe got the red wine poached pear and was sad that it was served cold, but he's not a dessert guy and he ate almost the whole thing.  The walnut genoise was perfect, as were its complements.\\n\\nThe chocolate marigold panna cotta is one of the best pudding-category desserts I've ever had in a restaurant, if not the best.  You really don't taste the marigold, it just bumps up the flavor of the chocolate somehow, which is intense, and incredible.  It's also HUGE.  The smoked salt bark and bergamot marmalade were wonderful, though I avoided the cherry bark jelly like the plague - it's thoroughly disgusting, I don't know why it was on the plate.\\n\\nAnd thus completed my birthday bondir experience.  It was lovely - I'm glad I went.  I probably won't be back soon, but I think everyone should try it if you like that kind of crazy weird ingredient amazing flavors you never thought of foodie experience."},{"name":"PONKO Chicken","address":"2896 Chamblee Tucker Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I'm from Stone Mountain, and loved the original Ponko way back when.

There was about one group ahead of us, and we waited about 5 minutes. This place is extremely small, and if you are just two people youll be seated at the bar. I kept getting hit by the people walking in since the fat guy behind me took up all the walking space, even with me hugging the bar. The staff was nice, and I liked it more than my boyfriend did.\\n\\nThe goal of our trip was to try the warm lobster rolls and it did not disappoint. I would definitely come back to eat it again. I dont like cold traditonal lobster rolls, so if you are a lobster roll hater you might like this one. Warm and buttery. For 29$ the bread should have been better, it was some cheapy italian bread that got soggy immediately. The fries were overly salty and okay. Other than that the roll was delicious, and you get a lot of lobster. \\n\\nThe clam chowder was watery but had nice juicy pieces of clams. Interesting and flavorful. I really liked how you can try a variety of oysters from different places. We liked the Wellfleet oysters the most out of the others we tried. I never knew how different oysters could taste. The scallop entr√©e was insanely salty, even the veggies on it were salty. For the first time in my life I did not finish scallops, and they were big nice looking ones, ruined by salt. The uni butter bread was also crazy salty. We heard the waitress recommend it to someone, which was funny. But its 4$ so not a big deal. All in all if you like salty food youll enjoy this place. \\n\\nThere is a reason why so many lobster roll pictures are posted.

We've had this lovely flu thing going around Austin and relevant areas. I'm on the path to recovery and at work. Man, I want some comfort food...something warm and tasty. Something right and better than any food I've had lately-which is very little. And my sense of smell just came back online-so I have reason to want something great. Going on the webinator, I find a review for \\"Best Grill Cheese in Austin-Period.\\" at BS Cafeteria. And it's close to where I am. It's pricey-but well I haven't eaten much in the last 2 weeks-and damn it-they say it's the BEST! So I put out the bucks for the $10 grill cheese with NO chips-no garnishments-other than mustard and a little chunk 'o cilantro. They did put 2 sandwiches in there-i guess to make it logical that there was nothing else there. Long story short- it sucked. It was  thick with unmelted cheese on saturated sourdough bread. What saturated the bread? Some greasy stuff that was supposed to serve as melted butter-and I'm pretty sure they soaked it in this stuff before putting it on the grill. It was disgusting to take a bite and have to wash my hands, not to mention when a bite was taken I actually had this greasy stuff running down my chin. Now I ask you-when was the last time YOU drank your grill cheese? Needless to say-and it sorta broke my heart-i tossed 3/4 of it. There was nothing to salvage-certainly not their reputation. :-("},{"name":"The Soup Peddler Real Food & Juice Bar","address":"501 W Mary St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I forget how good we have it here in Austin.

As much as it may look high class and upscale, once you have been seated its warm qualities make you feel at home! It helps that they have caring, inviting staff to add to the mix! It screams Vancouver style all over but yet has a second floor dining area that has a more intimate feel!\\n\\nService:\\n\\n20/20!!! Service here has been nothing less than exceptional! Go on any night and get a great server. Staff are very knowledgeable about the current menu offerings and approachable if needed! Even when the restaurant is super packed and busy they still are amazingly friendly!\\n\\n* My only complaint is the Uniform dresses that the female servers wear! look a Lil drab in my opinion but at least they still keep a streamlined feel among all female staff.*\\n\\nPrices: \\n\\nUsually when you think of a 5 star Italian Joint you think of Hundred Dollar Plates no bigger than your fingertip and overpriced Wine... Well not at Italian Kitchen! My Friend and I came for a Brunch one day and had bills under 20$ each! Drink and Entree! WOAH!!!! Depending on what you eat at dinner you can expect to spend more of course... For myself I usually spend 30-35$ for Entree, Appy and Dessert with a Soft drink for dinner or closer to 40$ with an alcoholic drink! (Taxes and Gratuity not included)... But for the generous Portion sizes you get it's worth what you pay for sure!\\n\\nFood:\\n\\nTo get a full Gauge of the Offerings at Italian Kitchen I would best suggest trying the Sharing Options! The Pasta Platter for brunch is a must try! A delicious offering of the Kitchens best pastas! Mmmmmm! The Pesce Piatto (Seafood/Fish platter) is also a must!  Crab stuffed Prawns...Need I say more! But if you will be eating you own meals I suggest trying something simple like the Spaghetti with Kobe Meatballs and Truffle Cream! The Truffle Cream mixed with the Ricotta Confit WOOOAHHH!!!! Talk about flavor explosion... This dish may seem sooo basic but the execution is beyond, beyond! If something this good doesn't amaze you then I don't know what will.... (Maybe dessert?)\\n\\nNow when it comes to dessert I feel as though I have had my fair share of experiences... But nothing in this world can compare to the Zeppole at this place! By far one of the Top 3 Desserts in Town...ANYWHERE! Just try dipping one of these Italian style mini doughnuts into the Cr√®me and gently biting into one inside your mouth. The warm chocolate Ganache wrapped around the creme glacee just melts so softly on your tongue its like most heavenly experience your mouth will ever enjoy! No Joke... This stuff is to die for and is the only thing u cannot leave Italian Kitchen without trying! BAR NONE!\\n\\nIn terms of Drinks.... They have good wine and fancy Cocktails.... A Must in the summer is the Pitcher of Sangria! Muddled with fresh berries it's a cooling taste on a warm day is the purfect mix! In the spring or fall try the Sanafir lights Cocktail! Nice soft flavors! Cocktails however will run you about 8-10$ to start... so better to save money and order a pitcher of Sangria or a Bottle of Wine to share! \\n\\nOverall, this place is fabulous and worthy of your visit!"},{"name":"Javier's Taco Shop","address":"121 N Lombard","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"I almost never complain about food. Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's not, and that's just the way it goes. But when you buy food that turns out to be INEDIBLE, it's quite frustrating, which is why I'm taking the time to write this. The carne asada in my 'California Burrito' was so tough, gristle-y, and disgusting that I could not chew it and had to spit out nearly every bite I attempted to take. About a third of the way into trying to eat my burrito, I had to give up and threw the whole thing away. That's  extremely rare for me - I'm something of a human garbage disposal and I will eat just about anything. But when you CAN'T EVEN CHEW IT.... And although the menu said that the California Burrito contained 'potato,' what it actually contained were cold, stale, gross french fries. My guess is that when they make fries that no one ends up ordering, they leave them sitting around at room temperature for eventual use in this horrific 'burrito.' Even if the meat and french fries hadn't been disgusting, this still would have been a terrible burrito. I've happily plowed my through many a lackluster burrito in my life with no complaints, but honestly - This was one of the worst things I have ever attempted to eat.\\n\\nI would have been better off just throwing my money in the garbage or setting it on fire.

It was overpriced for what it was. The fried chickpea appetizer was good but salty. The hamachi crudo was very good but small and expensive. The menu was a little confusing because some entrees are a la carte and some are not. The chicken, which I ordered, was. When it came out, it was 4 chicken wings. I do not typically eat meat but decided to kind of splurge here because the meat was organic, pastured, blah, blah. I should have saved my freebie for some bacon. The sides I ordered were the french fries with homemade mayo (meh) and brussel sprouts which were by far the best thing I had. My friends ordered the steak special. It was $32 and they said they did not feel like it was a $32 cut of meat. They complained of toughness but said the steak was not overcooked.\\n\\nThe best part about Sound Table is the service.

I haven't reviewed anything on Yelp in a long time.\\n1a. This is because the part of my brain that used to be funny has been co-opted by math.\\n2. Everything I encounter in my daily life reminds me of economics.\\n\\nFor example, Match. I went to Match on a Saturday night with one of my single girlfriends. When two single women go out to a bar on a Saturday night, meeting men is generally on the agenda, but this endeavor was wholly unsuccessful (and not just because I was radiating economics vibes!). \\n\\nSo I started thinking about how Match is a great example of market failure. Here's why: \\n\\n- the crowd at Match was like 90% women*\\n- the men who WERE there were clearly on dates\\n- if there were a bar in Boston where 90% of the people were women, this would attract men, and the bar would no longer be 90% women \\n- EVEN if this bar's specialty drink is a fruity martini rimmed with Pop Rocks. I mean, come ON, guys. Just because it's on the menu doesn't mean you have to ORDER it. Okay, fine, so Match has a romantic atmosphere what with the dim lighting and the fire and all, and they do serve a wide range of really delicious and creative martinis that happen to appeal primarily to women, but I'm sure you could order a double whiskey with an ice cold Budweiser chaser or whatever it is the men are drinking these days and they'd be able to scrounge up something\\n\\nSo either there aren't any single men in Boston, or they haven't figured out that bars that appeal to women are... full of women. Neither option bodes well, but at least now I have a place to go with my girlfriends to complain about it over crazy good martinis and Pop Rocks.\\n\\n\\n*Speaking of which, my friends and I once tried to come up with a female equivalent of a \\"sausagefest\\" and decided the best choice was \\"clambake\\"."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Seafood 5 stars, but packed seating affects overall experience.

Crunchy crispy goodness with saut√©ed mushrooms topped with cheese. The Reggie (basically original chicken biscuit sandwich) was on point, topped with their sausage gravy (they also have a vegetarian mushroom option but it looked very watered down in comparison). I would rate the shrimp and grits higher at screen door but these are worth trying if you're a pescatarian trying to find something to suit you on the menu. The biscuit by itself with apple butter - I would take this to go next time so we could have tried the chicken pot pie (with biscuit dough on top which looked DIVINE). Lastly, the hush puppies. So disappointing compared to the rest of the menu and I'm bummed they came out last after all the other goodness. \\n\\nThe open kitchen concept for me is a real fun way to watch your meal being made and I'm glad Pine States allows its customers this pleasure.

It was fresh and thoughtfully prepared Mediteranian food.  I came in early on a Tuesday night.  The server was attentive in just the right amount.  He knew the menu and wines well and took time to thoughtfully answer my questions.  The prices were average for the area.

My meal with the wine was around $16 without the tip - reasonable for dinner in my opinion.   \\n\\nI received a generous glass of wine with my mediterranean platter of hummous, taboulrleh, baba ganoush, and falafel.  The portions were more than enough and I ended up taking home enough for lunch.  The server and I were talking about the menu and he said the \\"eggplant\\" was fabulous.  I said I had almost ordered it so he actually brought me out a piece to try.  It was a slice of eggplant that had been grilled perfectly with just a tiny bit of firmness.  Then it was marinated and served cold.  It was delicious.  I must admit it was the best baba ganoush and falafel I have ever had in Atlanta.  They also served a twist on the olive oil/bread thing by adding balsalmic, feta, and fresh tomatoes and herbs all served with warm pita. \\n\\nThe only thing I didn't care for was the music.  It was flowery piano renditions of show tunes and pop music.  A wee bit reminescent of Muzac.  The atmosphere calls for something a little more hip, maybe jazz or wold music...

Honestly, the free bread with the salted butter was worth noting as well. \\n\\nFor those without a meal plan, the prices are ridiculous - even for Disney standards. $34 for the roasted chicken entree that was mediocre - real world it's worth perhaps $12-15.

The oysters just kind of melted in your mouth and the sauce with coleslaw kinda stuff was great with it. \\n\\nThe tacos came in small portions but I was happy about that- they were cheap (about 3-4 bucks apiece) and I was full when I finished dinner.I don't understand why this place has gotten 3 $s for price, because it's much, much cheaper than many places I've been downtown. \\nI didn't try the rice or beans that normally come in a taco plate. The tastes were much simpler than my favorite taco place (Torchy's, duh) but still pretty good. I especially liked the ribeye taco. The mahi mahi taco didn't have enough flavor, but it was okay. The wine was yummy and reasonable in price (about 22 bucks for our bottle). \\n\\n Overall, I liked the atmosphere of the place and our server made the whole experience.

The burger buns are the highlight, sweet and dense, an amazing complement to my burger and super filling. I had the Western burger, it was tasty. The BBQ sauce wasn't as sweet as I normally like mine but I added jalapenos and it kicked to whole burger to another level so I didn't mind. The sweet roll with the not too greasy burger and the spice from just the right amount of jalapenos was just what I wanted. On to the fries... so good they were perfectly crispy but fluffy in the middle it was a great combo. The best part though was the price burger fries and 32oz drink for 7.99 you cannot beat that for value. When you can get all this to go at such a great price why would you ever go to a place like McDonald's? I will definitely go back and bring friends, they have a nice little out door patio with tables and it would be a nice low key place just to hang out.

We indulged in calamari and a Caesar salad (romaine hearts drenched in a truly delicious sauce-- and I don't typically like dressing) to start, and were happily surprised when we were also given Scampo's complimentary breadstick-dip starter. The green dip was scrumptious-- almost like pesto.\\n\\nFor the main course we ordered a couple of pizzas: a basic tomato-mozzarella one and a more adventurous mushroom-fig-honey-truffle one. Both were quite good, and I felt lucky to take home some leftovers since my out of town friends didn't have a fridge in their hotel room! The tomato-mozzarella pizza had delicious chunks of tomato instead of the usual tomato sauce, which was a nice treat. The mushroom-fig pizza was a good combo of sweet and savory and it was surprisingly filling. \\n\\nWe also ordered a dish of truffle fries, which my friend and I found to be surprisingly akin to McDonald's fries with a little truffle oil on top. But hey, you can't beat America's favorite fry, right? No harm done there, as I'm still giving Scampo a five-star review.\\n\\nThe drink list was quite extensive. Both of my friends got fruity cocktails and we later shared a bottle of pinot grigio. \\n\\nScampo has an upscale vibe without being too stuffy, and the patio, where we sat, has a lovely view of the Liberty Hotel. I'll echo other reviews of the Liberty by warning you that come a certain hour of the evening, the hotel literally IS a nightclub for the young, affluent set. Scampo is not within view of the nightclub-like areas, although we greatly enjoyed a few minutes of people-watching after we left the restaurant. \\n\\nAnyhow, we had an enjoyable night here. Our bill was a cool $157 before tip, which seems like a lot to this solidly middle-class girl, but it didn't seem to faze my friends. And it was a fun splurge!

The salsa was equally fresh, but could maybe have been a touch spicier. With the guac and salsa, they give you this giant bucket thing full of chips... so many chips... my stomach lining definitely expanded exponentially from eating these... but that's because the chips were hot, and sprinkled with a special seasoning which made them extra addicting. \\n\\nMy sister ordered a skillet - half a skillet was an excellent size, and she got hers with grilled tilapia.

We managed to get early dinner reservations on just a day's notice, and we were very excited.  I mentioned that I am gluten and dairy free, and they said they would accommodate this.  Upon entering, we were greeted by a warm and welcoming fireplace, a courteous and friendly hostess, and pleasant, smiling waitstaff.  They seated us immediately and we received the menu.  As another reviewer recently posted, hearing our server discuss the menu was straight out of an episode of Portlandia.  My wife could barely maintain a straight face...and barely managed to not bust out laughing as the waitress described the bread made with squid ink, ground nori, and fish something or other.  Fortunately, the servers were innocent and sincere, seemingly unaware of their caricature of hipster foodie-ness at it's zenith.  They did not have the arrogance of servers I've encountered at other nice restaurants, which was refreshing.\\n\\nAnother positive note was that our server had personally consulted with the chef about every single menu item to accommodate my gluten- and dairy-free request.  The menu sounded delicious and my wife and I imagined some incredible food was heading our way.  We got the mangalitsa pork jowl, the black arborio risotto with seared tuna, and sea scallops with a wakame-daikon-hedgehog mushroom-kale broth.  Here it got hilarious.\\n\\nThe pork jowl was served cold (like the freshly baked bread).  It was supposed to melt in my mouth; but my wife and I could barely locate it on the plate.  For $16 as an appetizer, we were expecting a decent slab or at least chunks of seared pork jowl, hot out of the pan, with some delightfully promised garnishes.  We got quasi-pickled, bland, and limp shaved carrots and daikon radishes, with a 1-mm thin flat slice of cold pork jowl at the bottom, all drenched in some kind of mildly salty, unidentifiable pickling liquid.\\n\\nNext came the black arborio risotto with tuna.  Except there was no tuna.  The dish tasted ok, and I was embarrassed to ask but finally got up the courage halfway through it: \\"excuse me, I'm sorry - wasn't this dish supposed to have tuna?\\"  The server said that it did -- dehydrated, microplaned tuna (meaning they had shaved about .001 ounces of dried tuna on top and the black rice had absorbed it.  There was no taste of tuna and I paid $18 for 4 small bits of carmelized onions and a handful of black rice.  The taste was refined but bland.\\n\\nMy wife got the scallops in the meantime, and this was a tasty, delicate, well-composed but tiny dish for $29.  In comparison with other farm to table restaurants, the dishes here were so small all I can say is \\"microplaned tuna\\".  \\n\\nThe dessert was the chocolate semifreddo; this was delightful, moderate in size, and probably worth the $12 we spent.\\n\\nIn summary: if you don't mind spending a huge amount on almost no food, and are willing to risk some encounters with bland or underwhelming food, go here.  The people are very nice and helpful.  I'd give the service 5 stars; the food 3 stars; and the portion-price discrepancy 1 star.\\n\\nI was so hungry that I had to eat another (large) meal when I got home.  For the record I am not a large person nor an overeater -- 6'1\\" and 160 lbs.  is estimate the three dishes we got contained a total of less than 500 calories.  This is like an unusual art show; we thought it was interesting while reviewing the art but left feeling empty."},{"name":"Maji Restaurant","address":"8391 Alexandra Road, Suite 1180","city":"Richmond","stars":"4","text":"One of the hands down restaurant that you must try when you're in vancouver.

Their dinner menus are more extensive and expensive.

For example, they have an egg roll with mozzarella cheese. The idea is great. The flavors aren't. It's very bland. \\n\\nTheir garlic tuna lacks punch. Even their sushi portions are smaller than everyone else in the neighborhood.  \\n\\nTheir dinner prices are way too expensive for what you get. I have left here 2x with over 30$ for what other places would charge under 20$. For example, if you order the tea ( which is from a soda can ), they give it in a small glass that is 1/2 the volume of the can.

We waited against the window at the entry. Nobody came and we waited. Then 3 snooty chicks come in and waltz up to the host stand right in front of me...Oh hell no. I walked up next to them and stood there where i was accused of skipping line. I politely explained to them that they walked right past me without any consideration. All this drama because the host was dilly dallying around instead of seating folks at all the empty tables.\\n\\n2.) We ordered our drinks. A Mexican Martini and i had the Kiwi Martini.

Incidentally we observed this same food server deliver to the wrong table 3 times...!\\nMy Lobster broth soup was served with a teaspoon rather than a soup spoon making it very difficult to eat without pouring it down my chin\\n\\n4.) Entrees - I had the special that day which was Lobster tacos. My bud had the Coffee marinated Ribeye steak with queso asadero and chipotle horseradish aioli, 10.75 and we shared.

We got seated in two booths by the window and the waitress came by with menus and friendliness.  We ordered another round of drinks, one of the guys decided to be funny and challenge the waitress on the type of certain beer only to be burned with tail tucked between his legs.

You know one of those people that reminds you of a Mother Hen, you know not to mess with her.  \\n\\nOk, back to the review:  the place was small and cozy.  Had about maybe 10-12 booths, if that, and few high tables that seats two.  The bar area was also small, I can't recall how many seats they had, sorry.  After careful deliberation, I ordered the Thurman burger, my bf ordered the Jumbo Buffalo Wings (an order of 10), and two of Nicks friends, Seth's name is the only name I can recall since he sat with us, ordered The Thurrminator.

We took a picture, but unfortunately, I don't have it with me to upload.  However, it was bigger than my the size of my head.  Mind you, my head isn't that small, it's very average.   I felt strangely full just looking at it.  The wings were good, but the burgers were even better.  My bf and I split the burger.  I sat across from Seth who was attacking The Thurminator with intense passion...   It took about an hour, but he did ate the whole thing... with fries and couple of beers to wash it down.  The man gained some respect for that... it was more like sickening awe... I just prayed that he didn't spew vomit across the table which I was seated within a dangerous reach of possible disaster.

Fortunately, we had a waiter that gave us excellent service even though were young and fairly underdressed.  Juliano was great- he was an older Italian gentleman that obviously had been in his occupation for a long time.  He was very friendly and funny.\\n\\nThe food was fantastic.  They give you a few types of bread to start out your meal, and also some long skinny breadsticks.  You get butter, olive oil, and hummus as dips to go along.  Our appetizers were a golden beet salad with arugula and balsamic, and a portabella mushroom plate with goat cheese, spinach, and pine nuts.  Both were splendid.  For entrees, we had a gnocchi with rosemary tomato sauce, and a penne with gorgonzola sauce, mushrooms, and sundried tomatoes.  We love gnocchi and their version was amazing.  The individual gnocchis were smaller than you normally see, but had the perfect texture and pretty much melted in your mouth.  The penne was also terrific, and the gorgonzola sauce was not too rich and overwhelming.\\n\\nFor dessert, we had the chocolate mousse cake and were also comped a tiramisu.  The mousse cake was a little too dry, and the tiramisu was pretty ordinary.  Their best item was the orange chocolate chip biscotti they served with their cappuccino.  I would love to take home some of that.\\n\\nOn certain weeknights, they run an Economic Stimulus Menu, which is a great deal.  For $21, you get a choice of appetizer, entree, and one glass of wine.  The great thing is they have about 6-7 options within each category, which is pretty rare for lower priced menu specials.  La Grotta is about as far away from trendy as you can imagine.

I'm super impressed with the bold use of fish sauce on this dish.\\n\\nBravo, Tasty N Alder....Bra. Vo.\\n\\nBetween three gals - one being a picky vegetarian - we had the following and were extremely pleased:\\n\\n- CLASSIC STEAK TARTARE: My friend loved this and said it was her second favorite dish after the brussels sprouts. It's your traditional tartare served with a raw egg on top, and a side of crostinis and potato chips. I found the tartare too dijon-y, but am finding that to be the case with all steak tartares I've had in the Pacific Northwest. It's a bit overpowering for me. I won't hold this against the restaurant, but I will say that tartare does not have that strong of a dijon flavor in France or other places I've had it throughout Europe; even back in LA, I've never had tartare so dijon-y. A respectable dish overall though.\\n\\n- FOIE GRAS: I love me some seared foie gras, and this was an interesting combination of flavors. Two seared foie gras pieces served with a thick slice of toasted fluffy brioche-type bread and a pineapple-y sauce. It tasted like a pineapple upside cake with foie! I super enjoyed this, but the sweet flavors had me devouring the foie gras by itself first and leaving the rest of the dish to eat as dessert. Admittedly, I'm a bit disappointed at how small the pieces of foie were, but that's because I'm a glutton for the fatty goodness.\\n\\n- GRILLED SPANISH OCTOPUS: I personally loved this dish - probably my second fave after the brussels sprouts. It was so surprisingly tender, I was suspicious if it was octopus at all! Not rubbery in the slightest, and it was really flavorful. My friend thought it had too strong of a charred flavor, but I liked this dish a lot. It was served with tentacles intact, so it frightened the picky eater among us, haha.\\n\\n- FRIED OYSTERS: I think these were breaded in cornmeal, which is generally my preferred breading for oysters. The breading could've used more salt, but the gritty crispy texture was perfect and the oysters tasted yum.\\n\\n- GRILLED BACON WRAPPED SHRIMP COCKTAIL: It's shrimp and it's bacon. I'm pretty sure you can guess what this tastes like.\\n\\n- And of course, the SAIGON BRUSSELS SPROUTS: We loved this dish so much, we ordered a second, despite the painful fact that we were full to the brim and weren't sure we could handle anymore food! Seriously, these brussels sprouts are amazing. They were cooked to perfection with crispy leaves on the outside, and firm with a mild crunch on the inside. Just bursting with intense flavor.\\n\\n- Vegetarian friend had the GOAT CHEESE DUMPLINGS ARRABIATTA and the FARRO RISOTTO. She gave the thumbs up.\\n\\n9 dishes + 1 champagne cocktail + 1 glass of white wine + 1 coffee cocktail = $143. Reasonable price point considering how much we ate and how satisfied we were when we left.\\n\\nFood came out pretty fast - in fact, two of our dishes were served before our drinks. I think they just brought out food as it was ready. No rhyme or reason, and that was fine with us.\\n\\nThe place is trendy and industrial. It's noisy with chatter, but not so loud you can't have a good catch-up with your girlfriends. Music choice was pretty random - nineties hip hop music played all night long, which didn't seem to suit the place at all. But this is Portland where I expect things to be super odd and random anyway.\\n\\nService was fine, non-descript really. It was a Friday night, the place was packed, and when my friends and I showed up, we were told it'd be a 45-minute wait. We left our phone number, went for drinks down the street, and our table was ready over an hour later. Good news is, we weren't totally starving, so for us, Tasty N Alder was well worth the wait.\\n\\nOverall, an excellent dining experience that I would totally recommend to my friends. Those brussels sprouts - gah!

An Italian home away from home, probably because it was one of the places my dad always wanted to go for a special dinner when I was growing up.\\n\\nLast night was very nice. I can't exactly rave- hence the four stars- but I can tell you that the service is on point, the graciousness abounds, and they are generally accommodating about adjust dishes to suit your dietary needs and wants. I say generally because I explained that I cannot consume alcohol in any form - it is disclosed as an ingredient in a lot of dishes in each section of the menu, and I know that with sauces and such it is a common feature in Italian cuisine; I wasn't very comfortable with our server's assurance that the delicious sounding mushroom risotto special was made to order every time someone chose it (risotto would have to be partially cooked to actually get it to a diner in a reasonable time, right?)...this made me a little anxious about ordering anything.\\n\\nWe got the amazing burrata, prosciutto and tomato app and it was divine. Simple, perfect flavors and burrata might be the best cheese everrrrr. My fiance loved his steak, topped with gorgonzola (he ordered it medium and it came medium rare, which he actually loved) with the seasonal veggies of green beans and carrots. I was a little more scattered in my ordering - I got the veal piccata (delicate and just done enough; I skipped the lemon butter sauce brouht on the side because, again, I couldn't be confident of all that was in it); don't like mashed potatoes so I got a simple side (note: charged for this) of angel hair a oglio (tossed with olive oil) and Parmesan, and opted out of the seasonal vegs, not being a carrot lover; I chose a side of steamed asparagus (notes: also charged for this per the menu; while I know the asparagus was indeed steamed it definitely got finished off with butter).\\n\\nThe little birthday dessert was a small but delicious brownie and a dollop of vanilla gelato.\\n\\nOverall, it was a lovely night with good service.

We were hoping for a good meal based on the great reviews we read online; not so much, not one member of my family (party of 5) finished their meal. Three vegetarian meals, 2 meat based dishes and not a single one of us liked their meal which is strange for us since we absolutely love authentic mexican food.

Meeting time was approximately 12:15pm in the reception area of the Liberty Hotel. Audrey, our tour guide came, introduced herself and the tour and we were on our way to the first stop right downstairs. \\n\\nScampo was our first stop. We had the mozzarella and tomato salad with arugula and balsamic vinegar. Not really a cheese person, I was a little hesitant. The presentation was great and it tasted even better. During that,  we introduced ourselves and made some small and big talk. Following the salad was the infamous lobster pizza. It was great, that being, the first ever having lobster pizza. A generous amount of lobster on each slice, very fine dining. \\n\\nTo our next stop was Savenor's on Charles St. A nice supermarket type, with fresh meat. Had a variety of selections including venison dumplings and sliced python and such. And there, we tried a brownie. It was rich and chocolately with nuts. \\n\\nNext stop was, stopped outside JP Licks. Got a nice little history about it but unfortunately did not stop in for a sample. \\n\\nThennnn we went to Beacon Hill Chocolates. Sampled a milk chocolate as well as a butterscotch covered with a dark chocolate sprinkled with sea salt. I preferred the dark chocolate, whereas my date liked the milk chocolate more. Looking around the store, we saw the almighty bacon chocolate. They also had macaroons and Gelato. \\n\\nNext, we stopped by the nut store. Various kinds of nuts, in all different mixtures of nuts. Nuts and more nuts. So much nuts, it was nuts. Sampled the nut butter, and had their cranberry mix. \\n\\nNext off, we stopped outside the Paramount. A, sit when you get your food rather than save the seat whole you wait for your food. We stopped outside for it was packed inside. Got a sample of the freshly squeezed orange juice and it was delish. \\n\\nAfter walking the nice street of Charles, we headed into the public garden where we saw the make way for ducklings. Discovered the remembrance for 9/11,saying that because even as a local, I had no idea that exist. Took a quick bathroom break at a hotel. And on our way to Bacco's wine and cheese shop. \\n\\nThere, was a variety of wines and cheese and other things. We had a sampling and I really enjoyed the a macaroons. The wine was eh, for not quite being a wine person myself. They had a variety of sauces and condiments. My date especially liked the mustard with seeds.  \\n\\nNext off, we made our way to the BonMe food truck. Having had banh mi before, the food truck was different. Started out with half a deviled tea egg and it was great. Followed by a sample of the chicken sandwich (because pork ran out) and it was really good. And lastly, some ginger lemonade, which, was different and refreshing. \\n\\nThen we made our way to Flour, the home of the greatest chocolate chip cookie. Did not get a chance to try it, but Audrey had placed an order to go. So off to our last stop which was Legal Seafood. Had a cup of the infamous clam chowder, which was great and plentiful of clams. To wrap things up, Audrey gave us each a sticky bun, from Flour. \\n\\nOverall, the tour was great and I tried many places I wouldn't necessarily have gone to/even knew of. Audrey was a great tour guide and made things fun and interesting. It was informative, and a lot  of walking. Maybe there could have been a bit more food but it was still a great experience with my food buddy."},{"name":"Portland City Grill","address":"111 SW 5th Ave, Fl 30","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Located on the 30th floor of US Bankcorp, Portland City Grill overlooks all of downtown.

However the numerous recommendations were word enough to get me aboard this place. Keep in mind it's a bit pricy, but if you don't frequent Boston often then I'd say this place is definitely worth shoveling the cash out for. \\n\\nAtmosphere: people warned me about the wait. I was expecting to get there, put a name down, and roam around for an hour. We got there just a little before 6 and the counter had only 2 open seats left, and lo and behold we snagged them with no wait whatsoever #blessed. But shortly after the people coming in were told it would be 45 minute-1.5 hour wait. So plan accordingly! \\n\\nFood: at the recommendation of my best friend, we ordered the Johnnycake. Cornmeal pancake, doused in honey butter and topped with truffled trout and caviar. This has to be by far in the top ten of tastiest things I have ever eaten. The mix of salt and sugar was a perfect harmony and the blended texture of the pancake and the trout worked so well together. It was warm, soft, and all sorts of flavors that cater to the taste buds. Well, WELL worth the $17. I kind of wish they made this as an entree and had like three stacks of the cornmeal pancakes and truffled trout galore.\\n\\nLobster roll and fries for main, warm butter. They are not stingy with the lobster meat here, which explains why it's $30. The warm butter was great and not too overpowering, and the lobster meat was fresh. The roll was also very soft and easy to break apart, and at some points I had to use a knife and fork. The fries were good as well, but nothing better than what I've had before. \\n\\nService: friendly and quick. \\n\\nWould recommend if you're visiting Boston and wanna drop some cash for an awesome meal.

Soon after we got seated, but he could have just said we're still waiting on a party to leave to get you seated, that way we didn't have to crowd the restaurant and wait their the whole time. The second reason is, several people in my party all ordered the same dish and the server took down how we wanted our steak to be grilled and mostly it was medium and when we finally got our food the steak was all well done and slightly burned. We didn't complain because we had waited so long and were basically starving at this point. \\n\\nOverall the food was still amazing, the french toast is delicious, the cornbread is great and overall the food was up to par, except for the burnt steak."},{"name":"Portland City Grill","address":"111 SW 5th Ave, Fl 30","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The beautiful view's that come along with the experience of delicious and delectable food is enough to give PCG a 5 star review.

The snails were fat and not too chewy and the sauce they were in was tangy, creamy and well balanced. The calamari was delicious. Again, not too chewy and the basil pesto sauce was perfect. \\n\\nFor our main I ordered the Black and White striped lobster stuffed ravioli. This is not part of their regular menu, it was one of their specials....and BOY was it special! First off, it was visually stunning. Black and white striped, hand made, round ravioli with big chunks of sweet lobster. The sauce was simply a marinara but it was potentially the best marinara I have ever tasted. \\n\\nThe star of the show was my wife's choice - SCALOPPINE DI VITELLO ANTONIO - (Veal Loin Scaloppine with Saut√©ed Shallots, Fresh Herbs, Sun Dried Tomatoes & Lemon Butter Sauce)\\n\\nThis, and I am not exaggerating when I say this, was quite possibly the BEST tasting dish I have EVER eaten. My dish was sublime, but I kept longing for a quick bite of my wife's! She obliged quite generously! The key to this dish was the sauce. It was perfectly balanced and absolutey delicious! The shallots really shone through in the flavour and the sun dried tomatoes were the perfect accompaniment and offered a sweet note. It was creamy and rich, but not too rich, and every bite left me wanting more. \\n\\nFinally we had dessert - my wife had the Tiramisu. It was about as authentic as one could hope for. Soaked in Ammaretto and just sweet enough. \\n\\nI had the Gran Marnier Panna Cotta with Pistacchio - again, this was easily the best Panna Cotta I have ever eaten. It was very sweet, but that was ok as it was balanced beautifully with the salty crushed pistachios. \\n\\nNow on to the service. \\n\\nWe had two servers assigned to us. I can not remember the older gentleman's name but the second guy we had was called Billy. Both were incredibly attentive and showed a personal interest in each of us. We felt very special. Christian, the part owner and manager, spent a good five to ten mins with us chatting away. The service was wonderfully timed and impeccably executed. \\n\\nThey also bought out a couple of glasses of pear prossecco as a treat for my Wife's birthday - and finally, they ordered our cab for us and let us know when it was there.\\n\\nI could not find a single fault with this place.

Love it!"},{"name":"Anmol","address":"258 Rantoul St","city":"Beverly","stars":"4.5","text":"My dining companion and I tried Anmol last weekend, after I had read the Yelp! reviews. Actually, I had not even known that this restaurant existed, as when I'm driving down Rantoul Street, I'm usually rigidly focused on the road, since it is bumpy, pedestrians pop out from behind cars, and sometimes cars come zipping out of intersections and parking spaces without warning.\\n\\nI have eaten at Passage to India in Salem several times, and was kind of disappointed in both the food and servers there (I ate there because a friend liked it and always wanted to eat there), so my hopes for Anmol weren't high until I saw the reviews and decided to try it. I was not disappointed, and in fact was very pleased.\\n\\nThe serving staff is a cordial team of Indian men. I have been to India four times, and can tell you that Indian culture is one in which smiling is not a spontaneous public action. So, these fellows are educated in American culture and have adjusted to our need for friendly smiles. The staff at Passage to India is not similarly aculturated, and I always felt put off by their brusqueness, even though I have some understanding of their culture.\\n(Interesting to know that the owner of PtI is not Indian himself, but an Anglo-American guy who evidently wants an authentic Indian atmosphere; this may be true of Anmol as well, but I don't know who the owner is).\\n\\nAnmol's menu is varied and the degree of spicy hotness is within the diner's full control. I ordered a mild shrimp tikka masala that was scrumptious in its rich tomato-cream and subtly spiced sauce, which was plentiful. The popular tandoori (a special kind of oven and baking process) dishes are there, in vegetarian, lamb, chicken and seafood variations. and there are marsalas (besides the shrimp version I had), too. You can get any dish completely without \\"hot,\\" or to-the-max, fire-extinguisher hot if you wish. \\nThe completmentary spicy crisp-bread appetizer comes with a trio of hot condiments, but you're under no pressure to eat or even try them. The servers re-fill water glasses throughout the meal, so I felt comfortable trying the spicies.\\n\\nThe garlic naan was excellent. Fluffy, light, slightly chewy, with sufficient garlic that it wasn't one of those \\"it smells garlicky, but where's the garlic flavor??\\" situations that too often are the case in restaurants. You want to taste garlic, not just smell the tantalizing aroma.\\n\\nThe wine, beer and mixed-drink list was interesting. My companion tried a blue concoction with margarita-style salt-rimmed glass and curacao. It was tasty and potent, even in the little sip I sampled.\\n\\nSince others on Yelp! have provided more details about individual items, I won't ramble on, except to throw in my thumbs-up accolades.

A necessary trip downtown today was the only excuse we needed to give this local place a try.  The restaurant is located on S. Young Street just south of E. Broad Street and east of 4th.  We were able to find parking at meters on Young, but there were several (pay) lots surrounding the restaurant as well.   The restaurant is conveniently located within walking distance of High Street.  This restaurant is currently only open during the week from 7:30 am to 7:00 pm.  They feature a full-service bar, and have happy hour specials.  \\n\\nThe interior of the restaurant is welcoming and warm.  We were greeted by the owners as soon as we walked in.  The restaurant was busy with a lunch crowd.  Staffing seemed appropriate for the crowd size, and the service was friendly and quick.  We were seated by a window, which afforded us a great view of the Columbus skyline--and in particular the east side of the State Capital building only a couple of blocks away.  \\n\\nThe menu was fairly extensive with great sounding salads, sandwiches and specials.  My husband ordered the namesake \\"The Hungry Soul\\" which was grilled rye bread sandwiched with a large portion of fresh sliced Pastrami, house- made pickled onions, brown mustard and Swiss cheese, and included a side (he selected the home-made kettle chips).  One of the daily specials caught my eye, so I ordered the nut-crusted chicken with spring mix salad.  The boneless chicken breast was quite large, moist and was drizzled with honey mustard dressing, which was also used as the dressing on the spring mix salad.  The chicken portion was so large, that I was sure I would take half of it home, but it was so good that I ate every single bite right then and there.  Our bill was around $20 which included our beverages.  The homemade desserts sounded awesome, but we were too full to try any.\\n\\nI love patronizing small, locally owned and operated restaurants, especially when the owners are on site for the day-to-day operations.  You can sense the love and care that they put into making sure that their food is delicious and their customers feel welcomed and appreciated.

I am a huge fan. It is the perfect spot to watch sporting events-the massive tv screens make every seat the best seat in the house. If you're not into sports (which I usually am not) they usually have simultaneous old school music videos playing on alternating televisions, which is pretty neat. \\n\\nThe drinks: They have a pretty decent beer selection. They have many beers on tap and something for everyone. They even have their own Jake n Joes \\"IPL\\" which is like an IPA/Lager combo that was really good. I've also had wine and the wine selection was decent as well. I've never had a mixed drink. The prices are very reasonable ($5-7 for beer, under $10 for wine)\\n\\nThe food: I've only ever ordered the same 2-3 things because those 2-3 things are so delicious it's the only thing I ever want. First, let me start with their wings. I prefer boneless, and the wing towers are the way to go. The Jake n Joes sauce is out of this world. The Triple Threat and garlic parm are great too. They are probably some of the best boneless wings I have EVER had. Ever. The fried pickles are great too! I only saw them on the specials so I'm not sure if it's a regular menu item. They are made with buttermilk and out of this world. \\n\\nMost of the time the service I've had has been outstanding. Very friendly, personable, attentive and down to earth. I've never had bad service. \\n\\nIf you're looking for a top notch sports bar, this is where you want to go.

Because of the inconsistency of the product from the supplier they had to revert to the regular Nori sheets that you seen in regular ramen shops.  I understand how it's important to maintain quality control and consistency.  They seem to be trying.  They got rid of the garlic chicken wings which I did enjoy and the nice thing is they weren't fried.  Having said that. it seemed alot of customers preffered a fried greasy wing instead, so they took that off the menu, added another salad (whoopee!) and some new dishes, like cold spicy tofu and a Natto/egg dish which I really like cause it's very healthy.\\nThe soups are still good.  Some people find the Shio (salt) broth soup a little salty so you can ask for less salt if you like. I think the Shoyu (soya) has a more rounded flavour.  For the dinner soups since it's the pork based broth, you can also ask for less fat which makes a difference if you're trying to watch your weight and or cut down on that stuff.  So if you go.

I did request in the reservation that we did not want to sit in the middle of the restaurant, and would prefer a booth or table in a non traffic area, so we had to wait maybe 5 minutes for the table to open. I should mention there was a 40 minute wait for people with no reservation, the place was packed, and a very warm atmosphere.\\n\\nWe get seated and our server Anthony gives us the run down of the restaurant history and the extensive menu, not so extensive it was confusing, more like it was complete in a confident way. He gave us a bit of time to look the menu over and took our drink orders. I had the prickly pear margarita, my wife had the dirty czar martini, the kids both had pepsi. \\n\\non a sidenote here, i have to say, i have traveled all over the nation and have eaten at many fine restaurants including ones owned by eric ripert, thomas keller, bobby flay, mario batali, emeril, etc. so i have slowly become a bit of an unofficial food snob and critic. \\n\\nThat said, we chose to order a variety of things from the menu to see exactly how this restaurant handles such a vast menu. For our appetizers we ordered a shrimp cocktail, an order of lobster mac n cheese, some crispy calamari, and something i have never even heard of before, chorizo stuffed dates, which were wrapped in bacon and served in a robust pepper tomato sauce. \\n\\nAll four came at the same time, the shrimp were humongous and nicely chilled, the lobster mac n cheese had massive whole pieces of succulent claw meat, way more lobster than i had ever seen in a dish of that nature. the calamari included pieces of artichoke hearts and lemons fried in with the calamari, and a wonderful sweet chili sauce, and the incredible dates were something i will certainly spend hours at home trying to recreate. \\n\\nWe were in absolute heaven, and couldnt believe how well the entire experience was. For our entrees, my wife simply wanted a small Caesar Salad with anchovies, our 15 year old went for the Scallops Orleans, which were blackened and topped with cajun cream sauce over spinach, mushrooms, and sun dried tomatoes all on top of crawfish parmesan grits. Our youngest, he is 13, went for the \\"white\\" bowl of clams and mussels. they have red (tomato based), or white, which is white wine, butter, garlic, lemon, basil, and onion.\\n\\nanother side note, you caught the part where i said these are kids ages 13 and 15, and this is what they order, i am telling you, we know quality food.\\n\\nok i went with old faithful , which was a filet, medium rare and lobster tail, with garlic mashed potatoes, and asparagus. You can always tell how good a place is by how they cook the filet. i cut into the center of it, and was very happy to see the exact amount of cooking on all 4 sides, with a perfectly prepared medium rare center. this is more difficult than most people think to make it exactly centered like that, which was the final factor for me in the need to go this far out of my way to write such a detailed review.\\n\\nall of the entrees were magnificent, the appetizers were amazing, the drinks were very good, the service was impeccable, and just before we thought about desert, the owner of the restaurant, happened to be there, and was walking around to each table offering a polite handshake and introduction with a warm humble thanks for coming to his establishment. the only thing i could possibly say to him as a suggestion, was to remove the tray of salt, pepper, sauces etc from the center of each table, as the food is so well cooked and seasoned, guests should have to ask for these things if they dare think the food needs it. \\n\\nI wasn't sure if he understood what i meant, that it was a compliment to the chef, but i think he got it, but again, i felt that he was more eager to please a customer he would rather have something there than make them have to ask for anything.\\n\\nAfter looking through the desert menu, we decided to skip the signature desert which looked like it was just way too much for what we could handle as we have already gorged ourselves to the hilt, so we decided to get the bread pudding and the pecan pie, and we all shared those. Needless to say, they were as tasty and well prepared as everything else, and we couldn't come close to finishing them, even between the four of us. when the bill came , we felt for once that we got the deal.\\n\\nto put it simply, this was by far the best overall dining experience i have ever had with my family and will certainly be back real soon."},{"name":"Magnolia Cafe South","address":"1920 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I went in here on the recommendation of a friend and I must say inwas not impressed.

We came in on a Saturday morning - parking was a bit difficult to find and the restaurant had a 20 minute wait. We ordered their hibiscus lime soda, the CBCB (chicken biscuit), and the vegan grits bowl. The soda was too sugary and had a high content of syrup and ginger in it. We ended up splitting the soda into two glasses and diluting it with water. Would not recommend for people who do not like ginger! \\nI had the chicken biscuit - the chicken was well cooked and well seasoned! The biscuit was fluffy and the melted cheddar finished it off nicely! The only thing that I would change would be the bacon - it was a little too thick and hard to chew. \\nMy boyfriend ordered the vegan grits bowl. The vegetables were grilled well, and the combination of the different veggies provided a good flavor profile. The grits, while creamy, were a bit conventional - making the bowl ever so slightly bland. \\nOverall, good food, good ambiance, and big portion sizes!"},{"name":"La Grotta Ristorante Italiano","address":"2637 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Best Italian food I've eaten!

If you love seafood this is your place. You are first served with the complimentary bread and pink butter Himalayan sea salt. If you have been to a nautical Disney themed restaurant before then you have had this. If you like Steak well, you can find something to eat there too. What is nice about this place is that it is also set right on the water. From just about all views you can see the castle, the light show on the water, up close, and fireworks when the time comes. Again, everything from waiter to table it was impeccable service. We started off first with the spicy calamari, don't pass that one up. If you are a large group and you are hungry well you may want to order two or another app. For dinner half of us order the filet mignon, sea scallops with gnocchi, and I ordered the buttered lobster tails. I have to say at first there was a mix up with the temperature of steaks with the table directly behind ours but once the steaks came out right, dinner was  perfect. The lobster tails could have been cooked for a little less, with the butter the tails were soft and not a tough bite. Again, just like most restaurants with a view, dinner gets put on hold and you can go out on the deck to watch the fireworks. Only guests dinning with Narcoossee's can use the deck. If you are staying in the Grand Floridian OR if you happen to be on their property you can go anywhere near the water or docks to watch the fireworks. You are in great view and unlike the parks you wont be swarmed by families and their children. Yes- I know there are families and children in Disney parks, I am just stating that this area and viewing place is less crowded. Dining does get put on hold and are placed until the fireworks have ended. Though when fireworks are over do bare in mind that the bar starts preparing to close and so does the restaurant.

One of our party has allergies and the restaurant was totally unaccommodating.

Seriously, how difficult is it to sub a salad (or anything else) for the fries?\\n\\nThe restaurant serves the dishes as they are finished. We explained to the waiter that each person in our party wanted their own entree and so we would like the food served all at the same time. He said absolutely not - the kitchen sends out each plate as it is finished. That meant that one person had nearly finished their meal before the next person got their food and the last person got their meal after everyone else in our party had finished. I understand that they serve the food based on the fact that people will share, but if a party indicates they would each like their own entree, the kitchen should be able to accommodate the request. Are they unable to coordinate the dishes like most restaurants do? Is it simple laziness in that it's easier for the kitchen to cook without coordinating efforts? I don't know. What I do know is that we would have been unable to share the plates even if we wanted to... the portions were way too small.\\n\\nThe food itself was okay, although two of our party complained their dishes were lukewarm, even after the very long wait.

Reality does not live up to the hype. There are so many wonderful restaurants in Portland that accommodate allergies, that have the talent in the kitchen that is needed to send out entrees in a coordinated manner so that the entire party can eat together, and who care enough about their customers to allow for reservations so their customers don't have to wait an hour to an hour and a half just to get a table.

My friend had recommended this restaurant to me, so I'm glad I managed to squeeze it in on this trip. \\n\\nLate dinner since it took us a while for our bodies to even handle dinner after Feast Portland's Big Feast and the restaurant was pretty busy. I wasn't even particularly hungry so I was going to order something small but so many items looked good! I was really tempted by the deviled eggs listed under the charcuterie section but after the waitress recommended the chicken liver mousse, I went with that. It felt like a really generous portion for a mere $6. Thank goodness I was able to pawn some off on my friends. And even though I'd been gobbling up some of the complimentary bread and had even more bread with my mousse, I wound up ordering another dish with bread! I just couldn't resist the roasted bone marrow dish which came with a grilled cheese sandwich bc I love both those things. Thank goodness I was able to pawn some of that off on my friends too bc no way could I finish all of that on my own. Even if I weren't full, bone marrow's pretty rich so it's a good dish to share. My friends ordered the scallop tartare, smoked salmon spaghetti, and roasted chanterelles. All were good although I think the mushrooms could have used some more salt. We split the fig tart for dessert. They also have some interesting non-alcoholic drinks. We ordered the housemade cherry lime soda, watermelon presse, and lemonade.

Situated on the bottom floor of an apartment/condo building in Buckhead, the restaurant offers free valet parking. The service is top notch, and the food was delicious. We started with the grilled calamari, which was so flavorful from the basil (pesto) sauce in which it was served. I like that it was not fried, and the kitchen split our appetizer so that my husband and I had our own servings. He had the lobster pappardelle, and I had the shrimp cappellini, both of which were fabulous and just the right amount; so many restaurants serve portions that are way too large. Of the two dishes, the lobster pasta was better, but it's hard to compare because the cappellini was so light and flavorful. I was just so impressed with the amount of lobster and the light sauce, and I hate it when my husband outorders me. Ha! Their bread tray is delicious too, and they offer butter, oil/balsamic, and olives along with the olive loaf and bread that is soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. We knew we had to have tiramisu for dessert since we had read so many good reviews about it, and this dessert was fabulous. I asked Vince, who visited our table to make sure everything was going great, what was crunchy in the dessert, and he told me they used amaretto cookies in addition to the ladyfingers. Top scores for the tiramisu! Overall La Grotta is a very nice restaurant with a lovely ambiance and great food. Of all of the positives, the people watching was probably our favorite ; )"},{"name":"Hooters","address":"1143 Broadway","city":"Saugus","stars":"3","text":"Hit or miss on the service.

When coming to Boston, I knew that this place was on my list.  We planned accordingly and came for an early dinner at about 5 pm.  The place was slammed but we were lucky enough to get a bar seat.  This place is small - maybe they can fit 40 people in at a time between the tables and the bar.  It is not a place for large parties and I would say 2 people is ideal to avoid an even longer wait. \\n\\nNeptune oyster certainly held up to the hype.  We tried three different kinds of Oysters and I the local oysters were amazing and packed with flavor.  We also split the clam chowder.  It was good, but not your traditional chowder - it is much thinner.  It is probably the only thing I would skip the next time, but that is in part to make more room for the delicious food. \\n\\nWe had to have the lobster roll. You had a choice of hot or cold and we went with the cold.  The lobster roll comes out and the lobster is just falling off of the roll - it is that packed with lobster.  The roll was nicely toasted with a little bit of butter.  It was meaty enough to support the lobster, but still light so it didn't feel heavy or dominate the lobster.  The lobster came with fries that were freshly cut and nicely salted.  \\n\\nNeptune also has a very nice wine list.  We had a pinot grigio that paired great with the seafood.  Our waiter was very helpful in picking the perfect bottle for our tastes.  They certainly know their wine and seafood.  The only complaint about the service is that it was sometimes slow.  I can only guess it is slow because they are always busy and can only pack so many people behind the bar.\\n\\nAnd dessert? I have no idea because  I didn't get that far.  Instead, I choose to have another round of oysters for dessert.  This is very important for someone who loves sweets and chocolate.  So yummy!

I knew it wouldn't blow me away, but oh boy did it underperform.\\n\\nThe first red flag was the people, ir rather the lack thereof. At 8 pm on a Saturday night, all the other restaraunts in Somerville were filled with people. My girlfriend and I were the only ones in Yuki-Shabu after two people left within 5 minutes of us sitting down. Although the interior was very nice, and the service very friendly, it could not make up for the terrible food I was about to experience.\\n\\nI should have order some soup or friend rice in hindsight. When I ordered the crab rangoons, I expected something halfway decent. My local greasy Chinese craving provider always offers solid crab rangoons, so perhaps the bar I'm setting is too high. But these were quite disgusting. I was served 10, piping hot rangoons that were somehow almost underfriend, with the dough being a little chewy to my liking. The filling could not be indentified as crab. It was a white paste that smelled of crab, and tasted like seafood, but in no way was the texture or look appealing. This white gloop was also quite hot for the rangoons, a phenomenon not even top thermodynamic experts can explain.\\n\\nThe general Gau's chicken that I ordered was also underwhelming. Although marginally better than the rangoons, the chicken had a weird consistency, like it was too uniform and thick to be realy chicken. It fells like chicken nuggest in chinese chicken form. Some pieces also felt a little undercooked, and all were drenched in way too much sauce.\\n\\nI would not recommend this restaurant, unless perhaps the other items are better, but stay away from the rangoons, those alone should warrant a Yelp reciew of less that 4.

Another thought was 101 foods or ways to cook the selection of items on the menu.  To not bore you as a reader, I won't continue on but hope you get my point.\\n\\nThings that impressed me:\\n1.] Location: just off Roswell, this restaurant has a large parking lot to facilitate its patrons.\\n2.] Exterior d√©cor:  This place looks awesome from the car window.  The sign catches your eye as you drive by and the restaurant windows are large with big curtains hanging from both sides.  As I did drive by, I thought what a great hang out for the summertime when they can actually use/open those windows and enjoy an evening summer breeze!\\n3.] Three-Meat Meatloaf - I beg of you to try!!!  This is such an innovate dish with three types of meat served to include beef, turkey, and pork (I believe) aside mashed potatoes, brown gravy, and green beans (such a classic combo)... this dish takes meatloaf to a WHOLE new level!!\\n\\nThings that did NOT impress me:\\n1.] Interior d√©cor: just average type of modern d√©cor.  Nothing that sticks out to make me look around... I guess that was good for the person I was with - the walls were boring so I had to pay attention to my guest!\\n2.] Price: kind of steep for a neighborhood gem.  These prices were similar to that of Buckhead and for what?!  I couldn't really tell you.\\n3.] Tagliatelle & Meatballs: I've had better... nothing that really stuck out to me about this dish but then again, shame on me for ordering something so ordinary!\\n4.] Menu: As mentioned in my opening statement; I wish this restaurant lived up to its name of \\"Food 101\\" - make your patrons understand why either you chose this as the name or educate them on the food... just my thought!\\n\\nAll in all I don't think I will be back.

Let me start by saying I don't complain much about bad experiences and I didn't say anything to our server or management tonight. I regret that. I also want to say I do not believe our server was the issue tonight unless there was a mishap on her part in submitting our order. I left her a 20% tip which is what I usually tip acceptable service. We ordered an appetizer which came out in a timely fashion. We always get calamari because it's good here and it was as expected. We placed our meal order but that's where things became disappointing. The couple in the booth behind us were seated after us yet received their food first. They even ordered steaks. My husband and I ordered the steak Cobb salad and our girls had burgers - basic and straight forward. We waited an unusually long time for such simple meal selections. I even waited kind of long for a tea refill. When she came by to refill she said our meals would be up soon. Again a wait...then the food arrived. The burgers looked great and our girls were satisfied. Our salads, which we've had before, were awful. They looked as if they were thrown together quite haphazardly. Perhaps this is an indication that there was a mixup in the kitchen or an issue with our order being put in? The shredded lettuce (romaine?) was piled in the center and then the steak, egg, bacon, tomato and avocado surrounded the lettuce. The dressing was literally slopped onto one small edge of the salad and I think there was 1 small bleu cheese crumble on my plate. The avocado was kind of coated in the shredded lettuce and was visibly brown on the surface. Parts of the lettuce were wilty and brown and the steak, well there were just 4 little pieces! As I said, I've had this salad before and it was DELICIOUS! My hubby and I enjoyed it very much when we had it about 4 or 5 months ago. This salad was not anything close.

Over a recent weekend trip to my homeland, my wife and I decided to quench our carbohydrate cravings, and visited three of Boston's top rated modern Italian restaurants: Bar Mezzana, Mida, and Sportello.  Of the three, I rate Bar Mezzana tops with 5 stars, Mida with 3 stars, and Sportello with a disappointing 2 stars.  I have posted full reviews of all three restaurants on yelp.\\n\\nThis is my third trip to Bar Mezzana, and every time I am more impressed.  The menu is an eclectic cross between fresh crudo, and homemade pasta.  The wine list is Italian inspired, with plenty at a reasonable $45-75 bottle price tag - our table had two bottles that night and both were rich and tasty.   The atmosphere is modern and clean, with whites and blues.  Between our table of 4, we tried 4 different pastas and two crudos.  The tagliolini with prosciutto and the orecchiette and sausage were the pasta stars of the night.

My group of three joined them around 10:30am.\\n\\n*Tasty Mary: vodka, tomato, worcestershire, horseradish, lemon, sriracha, celery salt rim, house pickles ($9)\\n*Alder Milk Punch: cognac, cold press coffee, cream, vanilla, demarrera ($10)\\n*Rawhide: bourbon, salted bonal honey, genepy, lemon, bokers bitters ($11) √ó4\\n*NV Marques de Requena, Cava, ES ($8 glass) √ó2\\n*Orange Juice ($5) √ó3\\n*Coffee ($3) √ó2\\n\\nOf course while on vacation, drinks always come first. (Actually for me, this may ring true in every day life!) We all started with drinks. I'm not a heavy drinker in the morning, so I just got the cava and coffee. Nice way to ease into the day. Plus, the coffee provided the caffeine to counteract the bubbles!

(They called this family style.) This was perfect as our table was more or less ordering to share. I chose the pancakes, steak & eggs, and broccolini. The favorite of the sweet plates seemed to be the pancakes. They were fluffy, but creamy on the inside. Had a nice slight tartness due to the lemon. The highlight of the steak & egg dish for most was actually the pancake. I didn't try it as I don't like cornmeal, but that was a hit. The steak was pretty good in terms of flavor, though cooked more than the rare I ordered. I did enjoy the cheesy scrambled eggs. I adored the broccolini. Cooked perfectly as it retained a crunch. Seasoned well with salt and lemon juice. And the cheese added a nice, creamy savoriness to it.\\n\\nI tried a little bit of the rest of the plates. The radicchio salad is huge! But I loved it because of the bacon. Yum! The bim bop was fun. I'm not big on rice, but I liked the flavors. The bambino plate is actually a decent portion. Could be a full breakfast to some. I love bacon, so I'm glad we ordered it. I found the duck duck steak dish to be a little misleading as we all assumed there'd be duck in it. I guess it's just a play on names. The steak was tasty though. I only tried a small bite of an oyster in the hangtown fry. Not really my type of dish, but it looked like the person who ordered it enjoyed it. The french toast was light. I liked the pear maple and whipped cream. I thought the doughnuts were interesting. They were just too dense for me. Though I wouldn't have even guessed they were made with potato.\\n\\nI actually adore brunch, but the waits back at home more or less deter me from going out to brunch.

This place is okay, yet more \\"meh\\" altogether. After eating here in mid-April 2019, I have to summarize my experience here as being a great place to drink beer (particularly draft IPAs), a good place to eat chips & salsa, a decent to so-so entree experience, and slow (if not substandard) table service. \\n\\nEntrees here seem to be limited. Unless I was looking at the wrong menu, but there seemed to be only four entrees offered- one was a Pesto pasta entree, another was salmon, and I forget the other two. The other menu choices seemed to be chicken wings, burgers, and assorted sandwiches (such as cuban sandwiches). The pasta entree was more on the \\"meh\\" side due to hardly being able to taste any of the seasoning. In fact, the McDonald's menu next door was more appealing than the this pasta offering. The entree came with a soup or salad choice, so this helped make up for the underwhelming feeling that the pasta yielded.\\n\\nThe chips and salsa were on point. The salsa seemed to be store bought, which is okay. Not watery, nor too thick. There wasn't a guacamole choice that came with it, yet for $5 (should have been $3, since it was on the menu), whatever. The IPA draft for $5.50 was outstanding. \\n\\nService here needs to improve. While this Sunday seemed to be slow since there were only a few occupied tables save for one that had several loud Russian men acting like drunken old fools, it took about 10 minutes for a server to even take my drink order. Seriously? And not only that, the server seemed more interested in trying to close the restaurant early due to some venue event. Just stupid. And a quick FYI to my server- please wear deodorant around your customers.\\n\\nOverall, this is a sports grill. You won't get the type of service that you'll get at a Four Seasons restaurant. Heck, you may not even get comparable service that you will receive at an Applebee's or Chili's. It really is hit or miss. Tonight was a near miss, yet disappointing with the $30 final bill.\\n\\nPlease have low expectations with this place."},{"name":"Barcelona","address":"263 E Whittier St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"My boyfriend and I stopped here on the way through Columbus because we love tapas and were convinced that so many positive reviews couldn't steer us wrong. I'm sorry to say it, considering what we paid for our meal, but the emperor has no clothes. Our experience at Barcelona was thoroughly bewildering and mediocre.\\n\\nWhat we expected (casual, gastropub-type atmosphere and Spanish finger foods) was completely opposite from what we got. The dining room is stuffy, dim, tacky, and while we were there a very loud band was playing Sinatra hits. \\n\\nThe food was all edible, even acceptable, but nothing close to either Spanish fare or 5-star worthy. The mussels came in a broth that tasted like Campbell's tomato soup. The tomato and cheese plate was drenched in a syrupy sweet sauce. The \\"beef short ribs\\" was actually a beef and mushroom stroganoff. The tapas sampler featured bizarrely flavorless green hummus with a total of two (2) crackers for about a cup of hummus, and various mayonnaise-based things I'd expect to see served at a potluck picnic, such as a curried grain salad with craisins and a run-of-the-mill potato salad.\\n\\nThis is a less important point but much funnier to me: Listing all menu items in Spanish does not make them Spanish food. Calling it a \\"Joe Descuidado\\" does not make a sloppy joe Spanish. It translates poorly (Neglected Joe) and only serves to assist my point that this restaurant isn't actually a tapas place, and it's only Spanish-themed at best.\\n\\nI don't understand why Barcelona is so universally acclaimed, but I'm aware that one bad review from me isn't going to change any minds in Columbus. I'd just like to advise others who might be looking for a traditional tapas experience that you won't find it here."},{"name":"Cattle Ranch","address":"2700 S Sanford Ave","city":"Sanford","stars":"4","text":"Came back last night specifically to try the pork chops.

We started with the lobster guacamole made table side and the lobster corn dogs. Both were very, very good. Even the chips served with the guacamole had some extra seasoning on them that put the meal off to a great start. As for the lobster corn dogs, according to our very personable waiter, these are the most popular app on the menu. Both the breading and the lobster meat in the corn dogs were delicious. I would however probably pass on this appetizer next time because mentally it was hard for me to get past putting something so indulgent like lobster in the deep fryer. Tasty nonetheless. Then the meals: everything on the table looked and tasted amazing. I had the king crab leg boil and it left me full and happy.

I do not expect tons of seating around the bar in normal Disney restaurants, however this is Epcot; where people come to drink around the world. 2) there is no way to open a tab. The bar wants payment for each drink, which can make the experience longer and less enjoyable if you are planning to stop and hang out and have a few drinks in a certain time period. \\n\\nAll in all, I highly recommend the Welsh Dragon; so definitely stop in the pub for one if you're strolling through Epcot.

Every resort has one, and they're primarily there to grab some quick service food while at the resort. With that being said, Disney does tier these eateries - and I have found that the deluxe resorts have much more of a selection; Contempo Cafe is no exception.\\n\\nLocated on the Grand Canyon Concourse, Contempo follows in the same suit as its surroundings and neighboring shops/restaurants in terms of aesthetics. There's really no ceiling, so you have full view of the Contemporary tower and the monorails zooming by. Like other resort CS spots, the layout is pretty open with a few edibles you can pick up yourself as well as coolers with drinks and a pickup station for hot food. \\n\\nOne thing I really like about Contempo is that before you enter the main area there are kiosks to put your order in for hot food. This makes it much more streamlined when picking stuff up. The food itself is typical of Disney counter service - like I said because it's in a deluxe resort there is more of a selection. I remember the steak salad being quite tasty and plentiful mmmm. \\n\\nI'm not sure why such a low star average with this place - it's definitely one of the better counter service eateries I've been to in Disney; go in with standard expectations and you won't be disappointed."},{"name":"La Grotta Ristorante Italiano","address":"2637 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I love.

The food at Crazy Buffet is an example of why I feel that way.\\n\\nIt's a fairly large restaurant in Orlando that caters mostly to the locals, away from all the tourist attractions. Seating is divided into smaller spaces, suitable for groups. Although it was relatively clean, it looks like the decor could use some updating and minor repairs.\\n\\nThe food. Hmmm. They had the usual buffet stations which included sushi, salads, soups, seafood, a few dim sum items, and hot foods. They also had cooked-to-order stir-fry and ramen stations where you choose your ingredients and they cook it for you.\\n\\nThe dishes were neither creative nor original, although it was the first time I've seen (fried) frog's legs in a buffet. I found most of the food to be overcooked and salty. I was drinking lots of liquids and I don't think it was from the 40C temperature in Orlando! MSG?\\n\\nCooked veggies were soggy instead of crispy. Fried or roasted meats were dry. My companions said the ramen broth was tasteless. They liked the freshly shucked oysters but they only opened a few at a time and then walked away. If I had to choose a favourite dish, it would be the fried crabs, even though most of it was overcooked.\\n\\nThere was one thing I haven't seen at a buffet restaurant before, anywhere, each chef-attended station (sushi, stir-fry, ramen, oysters) had a tip jar. On the bright side, the servers were very efficient at clearing plates and refilling beverages.\\n\\nI guess, living in Toronto, I have higher standards for Chinese food.

The fudge on top added a satisfying crispiness/crunch to the soft cookie. My sister loves the Raspberry Linzer. Another cookie, the Almond Bridal, was too dry and dense for me; it was boring and plain in flavor, IMO. \\n\\nLater, I tried an egg sandwich... And was quite disappointed. I got the MassArt sandwich (with whole wheat bread), and the flavor wasn't exciting at all.

I keep trying more things on the menu here.  The latest include:\\n\\nNoodles:\\nZaru Soba ($7.90)\\n\\nSushi:\\nSea Scallop nigiri\\nSurf Clam nigiri\\n\\nI love soba noodles.  This simple dish is one of my favorite Japanese comfort foods.  These are buckwheat noodles, brownish-green in appearance.  They're thin, slippery, and have a slightly chewy consistency.  They're normally served cold with a few garnishes and a dipping sauce.  The dipping sauce is a light brown sauce called tsuyu.  It's made out of dashi (Japanese cooking stock), sweetened soy sauce, and mirin (rice wine).  I like to dip my noodles all the way into the sauce and then suck them up.  Yakitori Jinbei's version was delicious.\\n\\nThe dish is called \\"Zaru Soba\\" because the soba noodles are served on a zaru, a sieved bamboo tray.  Jinbei also served the soba with chopped scallion and wasabi.  Surprisingly, no shredded nori seaweed came on top.  Chef Kondo came out from the kitchen to check on us and noticed, so he brought me out a small plate of nori.  He's the man.  My only complaint with the Zaru Soba is the portion size is small, so you'll need to order other dishes to fill up.\\n\\nOn this last visit, we came late on a Friday night, just before closing (10:30pm) and I was surprised to see that we were only 1 of 2 parties in the entire restaurant.  The Sea Scallop nigiri was fresh.  It was smooth and buttery with melt-in-your-mouth-like qualities.  Unfortunately, the Surf Clam didn't seem as fresh.  Its texture was too soft and limp and the flavor wasn't all that great.  Oh well, it could've been the particular night we went.\\n\\nBe sure to check out my previous reviews (specifically, the 12/15/2011 review) below for my thoughts on many of Jinbei's other authentic Japanese dishes including the yakitori and several of the restaurant's specials.\\n\\nOne note I'm surprised I didn't mention in any of my other reviews for this place is the ramen is $3 more expensive at dinner.  At lunchtime, ramen is only $10.  At dinner, it's $13.

In general, it's definitely on the pricier side. Oysters were $3, but they were some of the most unique, cleanest oysters I've ever had. You can't go wrong with them. I recommend the medium-large ones. For entree, I had the cioppino. Highly recommend it. Comes with 3 small cuts of fish that are incredibly fresh and tender, 2 prawns, and a generous portion of clams. It also comes with rice under. It's just enough food to leave you feeling full when you've finished, but not disgusted full. They also offer you warm, tasty bread to soak up the soup! Their lobster roll is by far the best I've ever had. It's serious q u a l i t y. Yes, usually what I'd define a good lobster roll by is just good dressing and heaping amounts of it. However, I'd never really paid too much attention to how the lobster was cooked. Not only did they give sooo much lobster (most I've ever seen), it was incredibly tender and you know it was cooked with precision.

(And there is fish sauce in just about savory entree.) But I do believe they offer fantastic value. (Most of their dishes fall under $15.) So if that's super important to you then Com Vietnamese Grill should be on your radar.\\n\\nSome helpful tidbits:\\n*****\\nI. LOCATION & PARKING: This restaurant sits in the corner of a strip mall off of Buford Highway next to Lee's Bakery and Tortas Locas. I've never had any difficulty finding a parking spot there.\\n\\nII. FOOD & DRINK: Com in Vietnamese means one of three things (and I'm unsure of the context they use): 1) cooked rice; 2) it's time to eat (sorta); or 3) com tam thit nuong (fragrant rice plates with marinated meats and pickled and fresh veggies) dishes. I think they're inferring the latter. \\n\\nAnyways, my breakdown:\\n===Favorites===\\n*Beef grape leave rolls aka Bo Nuong La Lot ($5.95): I love these grilled grape leaves with beef inside. Many restaurants don't serve them, and they do this well. \\n\\n*Ha Noi Rolls aka Goi Cuon Nem Nuong ($3.95): These special spring rolls feature nem, which is a grilled pork lemongrass sausage served with green leaf, herbs, cilantro, cucumber, pickled carrot-daikon, crispy onion, roasted peanuts, fried wonton skin and peanut sauce. \\n\\n===Try at least once===\\n*Goi trai cay w/ chicken and shrimp ($7.95): It's a papaya salad with a bunch of veggies, proteins of your choice, and a fish vinaigrette sauce. Not my favorite, but not bad, either.\\n\\n*Com tam thit heo nuong ($9.75): The rice plate -- a-ok. I thought the marinated pork chop could have had more lemon grass. I just didn't love the sweet fish sauce. By no means, though, was it bad.\\n\\n*But thit nuong cha gio ($10.95): The rice vermicelli noodle with pork and egg roll tasted standard. No complaints, but not necessarily memorable. \\n\\nIII. SERVICE: Friendly and fast. No complaints.\\n\\nIV. AMBIENCE & DECOR: Not very well lit, yet clean. Most tables accommodate groups up to four. (I'm sure they can host larger groups if you call ahead.) \\n\\nV. PRICES: Very affordable.\\n\\nVI. OVERALL: I think Com Grill will offer a decent lunch or dinner, for those looking to eat non-pho and banh mi Viet food."},{"name":"Tin Lizzy's Cantina","address":"77 12th St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Food was awesome, drinks were strong, and our server mattie was ON TOP of everything!

They're pricey but it's generally really good. We arrived around 9, so the bar was pretty full. I went to speak to the hostess to see if any tables were available, as we didn't have a reservation. Either way, we would be waiting, so my friends went to get a first round of drinks at the bar. This is something that I believe is normal to do. The hostess that I finally spoke to told me that she couldn't seat us because my friends had purchased a drink at the bar. She even advised me to go stop them from ordering if we wanted a table. Clearly she had judged us and decided we wouldn't be spending enough to warrant a table? Not sure what the issue was. We had planned to get additional drinks and some food, but the attitude from the hostess was terrible. We had one drink and left. I was embarrassed to have suggested coming.

I would definitely recommend getting the lobster guacamole-- it's made at your table and to your liking. We were asked to taste the guacamole as it was being prepared to see if we wanted anything added to it. It was a delicious experience.

This space is sexy.  Lighting looks like someone had an unlimited budget at Rejuvenation, and the shiny tin ceiling is spectacular when you finally get around to looking up, way up.  \\n\\nService has been attentive, slow at times, but quite personable.  I think that they are trying to create an atmosphere of \\"sit, stay a while,\\" which can be refreshing if you're used to some places that just want to turn the table.  \\n\\nI came in for lunch one day to try the Le Pigeon burger that people have been raving about.  This came out of the kitchen lightning quick, so major kudos for the waiter's medium-rare recommendation.  That takes no time at all.  The flavors are all spot-on, but like most burgers on ciabatta, I eventually had to give up the whole hand-food concept and resort to the knife and fork.  Fries were beautifully crisped, but salted within an inch of their lives.  \\n\\nI came in for dinner more recently with reservations.  That all went off without a hitch.  We were seated promptly.\\n\\nThe Roquefort and butter lettuce salad was delicious.  Incredibly fresh lettuce and a lovely dressing.  I also enjoyed the mussels, though the fries were again so over-salted that they could not be enjoyed.  And this was after requesting minimally salted fries.  That either did not get translated to the kitchen, or the kitchen is in cahoots with a major manufacturer of beta blockers.\\n\\nI do want to say that Little Bird has a terrific range of prices.  You can enjoy the upscale space on a less-than-upscale budget.  A salad and appetizer combo will cost you under $20.  The burger is only $12, and they have the quintessential French bistro offering of a ham and Gruyere baguette sandwich for only $7.  The full-fledged entree options come in in the high teens to mid twenties range.  You can do it up or do it down here for sure.\\n\\nThis is a perfectly fine dining option downtown.

We ordered the Great Leopold with a coddled egg (recommended by the staff), Cacio e Pepe with chicken arrosto, and the bruschetta. \\n\\nEverything was so good, probably the best pasta I've had in awhile. I thought the portion sizes looked kind of small in photos, but the pasta is really hearty and filling. I actually ended up taking some to go because we couldn't finish everything.  \\n\\nTheir menu is simple and straightforward, with a selection of add ons so you can customize to your desire. The pasta itself is fettuccine style, and it has a bite to it so it's chewier than your average noodle. I also suggest getting the bruschetta rather than the garlic bread cause it's only $1 more and the spreads/toppings they use are so delicious. \\n\\nWe went right when they opened on a Friday night so there wasn't a line, but the food did take 15-20 minutes to get out. Tables were filling up by the time we left, so I can only imagine how busy it gets around dinner time. Go early if you can or expect a wait. \\n\\nService was good, they have hosts in front of the food truck walking people through the menu. We explained that it was our first visit and they gave us lots of recommendations. After you order, your food is brought to you at your table. All of the seating is outdoors and there's a cute upper patio that's connected to the bar. It has that hipster vibe Austin is famous for, and the atmosphere is really lively.\\n\\nMy only critique is that it's kind of expensive. The pasta dishes run at $10-12, but you're almost certain to get an add on because the meals don't come with a lot of protein, bringing the actual cost per dish to $15+ \\n\\nNext time, I'm opting for their special where you can get a half order of pasta with a side salad (or roasted beets/vegetables) and garlic bread for the price of the full size pasta. This is what the staff initially recommended to me and I think it's a better deal if it's your first time and you want to try a bit of everything. \\n\\nOverall, I'm a fan of Patrizi's and can't wait for my next visit.

They were waffles and eggs Benedict. The waffle was a waffle, nothing to write home about. The eggs Benedict was the disappointing gem for two reasons. Number one it's prepared in the kitchen so you expect it to be done right as I understand the chef wants to prepare the Benedict and waffles from the kitchen to make sure it's fresh and not stale from the buffet line. Sadly the egg on my Benedict was hard boiled and the hollandaise sauce was very very lumpy.  Rather than to make a scene I just left my plate on the table, the Waitress nor the busboy nor the manager even asked what was wrong with the Benedict. \\n\\nI've been to Portland City Grill on a other occasions, happy hour and dinner.

So, today, a day in which I have a few future-ish decisions to make, I decided to make \\"it\\" happen.\\n\\nReceiving a warm greeting as I entered, I took and perused one of the menus at the front of the register as I waited for the woman in front of me to complete her order. Having already previewed an iteration of the menu, I had a feeling already I would get the veggie patty, but what would accompany it? I decided on the fries and white rice. I also had wanted hot tea, and then hearing they didn't have any, I reverted to coffee -- also not available; kind of disappointing, because I do prefer hot beverages -- before the attendant suggested water. I assented and he handed me a plastic cup for it.\\n\\nThe register was an iPad that also allows for calculated tipping starting at 20% by default. \\"Sure,\\" I thought, \\"why not\\", and I tapped and signed with my finger. I declined a printed receipt.\\n\\nI took my fast-casual dining number they'd provided and took a table in the rear dining area, poured myself some water from its dedicated spot in the drink fountain, and went to the restroom to wash my hands.\\n\\nI liked the hip and modern design of the bathroom fixtures, and the sign advising one to turn off the lights when exiting was nice. I chuckled at this a little since the lights were on when I entered.  Probably putting in a light timer with motion sensor might give the best of both worlds where if there are multiple people in the facilities someone won't feel pressurized (as some might) to be out first so they don't have to turn off the light.\\n\\nRoughly 18 minutes later, my food came. I expected, since they do cook it to order, that the food would take some time, but it might be that the cook might have been on break, or there was some other delay (but I couldn't tell you for sure).\\n\\nAll I'd observed is the woman who was on queue before me got her food first (with her receiving what I interpret as a verbal apology for the delay), and then mine came 4 minutes later. A guy who had come in not long after me got his food about 5 minutes after me, and then a woman who sat two tables to my left who came after the guy received her food probably about 6-7 minutes later.\\n\\nStill, the food was heavenly. I broke open some chopsticks and went for the fries first; they were piping hot and I love that completely (especially since the food temperature of my last couple dining experiences were starting to lead me to think cold hot food was a new trend[; why not, since it's April and Sunday was 55¬∞ F /s]). The veggie patty, they'd cut into fourths resembling chicken strips, and it was so full of flavor. The original sauce's taste reminded me of ponzu (and both being amber brown, it wouldn't surprise me if the original sauce has that as a primary ingredient); I really liked it. The sauce drizzled down into the white sticky rice, and that added to the flavor. The cucumber garnish was a welcome treat. The way they put together the dish makes using chopsticks very easy (should you be able to use chopsticks, anyway; at any rate, they provide you a plastic fork and knife by default).\\n\\nBetween the general staff friendliness, the modern payment system, cleanliness of the place, and \\"da bomb\\" food, I'm a fan.\\n\\nJust, please: hot beverages."},{"name":"The Westland","address":"10 Westland Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Took over 30 minutes to be seated, and waited an hour for our food to come out.

Our meals always come with an egg roll which I really enjoyed when we got it for lunch so I'm not sure if I was just really hungry or they were fresh because I don't remember it being that good the first time.

None of the food items had any sort of seasoning, except the beef in the empanada. \\n\\nFor the steep price, I recommend going to a real Latin restaurant like El Paissa where you know you'll get flavor and authentic food at a reasonable price."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Awesome food; great variety for vegetarians and meat lovers alike.  Service is also usually very good.  Definitely worth the wait (as there is usually one)!"},{"name":"Bar Mezzana","address":"360 Harrison Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"You ever get that feeling where a restaurant is so good that you're already planning your next trip back before your meal has even finished? That was how I felt throughout my Valentines Dinner at Bar Mezzana tonight. From the service, to the atmosphere, to the flavors, everything was damn near perfect. \\n\\nSo lets start with the service first. Upon walking through the front doors, my girlfriend and I were greeted by the front of the house and were offered coat checks. We were then seated at our table where our waiter came to answer all of our questions and provide his own recommendations. As we finished each course, the waiter promptly came to take away the dishes as well as clean the table. Our water was always refilled without having to ask and they even brought out second rounds of bread + olive oil. Lastly, Bar Mezzana also did something special for their customers by laying out a table filled with Valentine candy/chocolate and gave out clear little plastic bags to fill them with at the end of the meal.\\n\\nMoving on, the atmosphere was not too loud nor quiet but somewhere in the middle. I love that they have an open kitchen so you can see how everything comes together. The interior is definitely more on the modern/casual side while the floor to ceiling window ceilings gives it that extra refined look. \\n\\nFinally, my favorite part, the food. My girlfriend and I decided to try a multitude of dishes so that we could have an idea of what Bar Mezzana is about and this is the order in which we ate. \\n\\nGimme The Tea Cocktail 4/5: A fantastic drink to sip on. Alcohol was not too strong so I could've easily had two or three of these. \\n\\nLive Scallops Crudo 5/5: Honestly, I was super hesitant to order the crudo here because lets be real, it ain't economical (Think $13-$16 for a very small serving) . Now, many yelpers before me have raved about how delicious the crudo is here and after tonight, I now understand what they mean. The scallops we ordered were some of the freshest I've ever had and I definitely appreciate the presentation. At first, I thought the tangerines that were sliced on top of it would mask the scallops flavor but it only enhanced it. Towards the end, I was literally dipping my fork into the sauce over and over before the waiter took the plate away because I was obsessed with the balance of flavors. \\n\\nWarm Marinated Mushrooms Crostini 4/5: I love the umami that mushrooms can bring to a palate and this crostini met all my expectations. The duck egg that was served on top gave the crostini a velvety richness, while the mushrooms had this earthy/meaty tone. The only reason I'm not giving this a 5 is because I feel like I've had a similar plate elsewhere for a much cheaper price. \\n\\nSpanish Octopus 4/5: Octopus has in recent years become a favorite of mine to order as an appetizer, which is why I couldn't start my meal without trying one here at Bar Mezzana. Their version of cooking it is by giving the exterior a crunchy sear/fry while keeping the interior tender and soft. This is served with some baby potatoes and parsley(?), which gives it that added aromatic flavor. For $17, I felt like this was a solid dish but nothing too memorable. \\n\\nPaccheri 4.5/5: This dish was definitely one of the surprising ones of the night because normally, restaurants will serve this pasta dish in a tomato/marinara sauce. However, after my first bite, it was clear that they had incorporated the insides of the lobster aka the tomalley. Personally, I loved that they did this because it really highlighted the essence of the lobster flavor. Furthermore, the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and there was a fair amount of lobster meat. One thing that I will note is that if you're not into eating the insides of a crab/lobster, then the flavors of this pasta might be slightly overwhelming. \\n\\nPappardelle 4.5/5: Again, the pasta in this dish was cooked perfectly al dente. Bar Mezzana also did a great job in not letting the horseradish in this dish be too overpowering and instead play a more subtle role in the background of the palate. The portion was generous and the short rib was basically shredded into the sauce. \\n\\nAffogato 4.5/5: This was a great dessert to end the dinner because the espresso in the Affogato pulled me out of my food coma. \\n\\nThe bill for all of this came out to about $136 before tip which was quite fair considering everything we got to try. If I had to highlight 3 things from this entire review, it would be the service, the crudo, and how perfectly al dente the pasta was. I will most definitely be coming back in the near future to try out more of their menu."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"11/100 Yelp 2018 Review Challenge\\n\\nThe most exciting part of my Portland trip was definitely the food. There were so many hyped up food places and as with all hyped up places - I couldn't believe that some of them could be that good. \\n\\nPine State Biscuits definitely lived up to the hype and it was an awesome start to my food adventure in Portland. Went on a Friday morning and anticipated a long wait due to all the reviews but waiting in line to order to getting our food took under 30 minutes. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I shared\\n\\n1. THE REGGIE DELUXE (5/5)\\nHands down these were the best biscuits and gravy I've ever had. The egg, chicken, and bacon in the Reggie just seal the deal for the proteins. I loved how perfectly seasoned each individual component was and then, when eaten together just complemented everything really well. The chicken has a nice kick to it and was super tender and moist. I've had so many gravy and biscuits where usually the gravy is too salty and biscuits aren't seasoned enough, but this was just right. \\n\\n2. THE HASH + SAUSAGE (4.5/5)\\nYou can't have a solid breakfast without some potatoes. This was a unique hash - very thin and crispy topped with my saut√©ed onions, mushrooms, and sausage. I loved the contrast of textures - the crispy potatoes really soaked in all the flavorful juices of the veggies and sausage. \\n\\n3. BISCUITS (5/5)\\nMy boyfriend and I just had to enjoy these beauties on their own - after all, this place is called Pine State Biscuits. These heavenly biscuits were perfection. Nice and flakey outside, but super soft and moist in the middle. They taste great alone or with butter. But I got it with the apple butter for an additional 75 cents. It was like taking a bite into the perfect apple pie. The apple butter tasted like applesauce but a million times better (because I honestly don't like applesauce.) Even after I finished my biscuit, I found myself liking my little sauce container of apple butter clean. I would've loved to take some of this home to spread on my bread. \\n\\nI left extremely satisfied and will definitely want to return again the next time I am in Portland."},{"name":"The Thurman Cafe","address":"183 Thurman Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"i went there just like many other ya-hoos, \\"der i saw this place on the tv!\\" \\n\\nthe burgers were big. i'll give them that. it was more like a giant piece of meatloaf than a burger (i had to eat it with a fork and knife, which i normally think is a fem thing to do but it was the only way!)\\n\\nthe problem i had, which seems to be the problem everyone else is having, is that the burgers are soooooo dry.

I walked in today and remembered sitting down at the table with my mother and father and my sister. I recall dipping their fried noodles into duck sauce and hot mustard. It seems that they still have the same decor as they did when I was a little girl. However it has that hometown feel, the same owners, And most likely the same wallpaper. I do know for sure that I do not order anything other than their boneless spareribs, pork fried rice, and egg drop soup. So today I ordered the same thing I always order, the egg drop soup and the pork fried rice. And when I tell you that this is the best pork fried rice I've ever had in my life and it's the best egg drop soup I've ever had in my life I kid you not. They honestly have had the same recipe for years. And that consistency is the reason why people still go there. Don't let the dark Decor or the dustbunnies in the corner steer you away. If you want really good egg drop soup and pork fried rice this is the place to go. I will say my favorite Chinese food is chicken and broccoli however here their chicken and broccoli is with the white sauce not the brown. Therefore I do not like it. They have seating inside that you can sit and dine with friends and family or you could pick up. They also have lunch specials I believe 1130 to 3 during the day. Their hours are from 11 AM to 9:30 PM Monday through Friday and on Saturday and Sunday they're open from 11 AM to 9 PM. Now don't ask me about any other items from their menu because I have not tried them. I stick to the things that I love there and I get them every time."},{"name":"Blue Danube","address":"2439 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"If Columbus has a \\"Big Lebowski\\" of restaurants, the Blue Danube has to be it.  Has to be.

The guy making the drinks washed out the frothing container and wiped the frother before using it on my drink, so that was fine. \\n\\nThe latte itself did not have a strong coffee flavor. It tasted like a gingerbread cookie with a fair amount of ginger. Perhaps a little overpowering, especially at the first sip, but the more and more I drank, the more and more I enjoyed it... and then it was gone. 8 oz, just like that! It's definitely more of a treat than a daily drink kind of thing. The size small (8 oz) was $4.58 including tax, which is pricy. Thankfully, they didn't charge extra for the soy milk.\\n\\nWhen I went to sit at their outdoor seating, there was a man who started to smoke cigarettes and was oblivious to the patrons trying to enjoy their drinks outside. The smell was quite bothersome, so I moved to a different table to try to get away from it. That didn't work, so I moved to the table upwind and far from him. Still didn't work, so I left. The man worked at the cafe - I saw him chat with the people behind the counter and go into the kitchen in the back. For one, I wish he was more cognizant of the paying customers. Second, I hope he washed his hands before returning to work, but I suppose I'll never know.\\n\\nOverall, interesting latte and nice ambiance - indoor and out (minus the cigarette smoke). Kind of expensive for a small latte, but glad they didn't charge for the soy milk. They also have an almond milk option, but none of the non-dairy milks are listed on the menu. No vegan food options from what I could tell."},{"name":"The Park on South Lamar","address":"4024 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I was truly surprised by The Park.

We missed the first seating and were told that it would be an hour wait, so we left because we had other plans. I read on the website that you can come in at 2pm to put your name down for the first dinner seating at 5:30pm, which is what we did and had no problem getting on the list. I recommend doing this if you want to have dinner here. \\n\\nStart your meal with the Bread n Butter. No, it isn't complimentary but it is delicious and worth it. The bread is so soft and the butter is creamy and fresh. The Grilled Artichoke was nothing special to me and I thought it was a bit overcooked. This is a dish you can find most places so I would skip it here. The Farro Risotto was my favorite! Porcini mushrooms, a slow-poached egg, parmesan and shaved asparagus make this dish a winner. Once you combine the egg yolk into the dish it is out of this world. The grilled asparagus with the hollandaise was interesting. I probably could have done without the sauce.\\n\\nThe Steak Frites were super decadent, served with truffle fries and a shallot compound butter. The meat was perfectly cooked to medium rare and very juicy. We ended up ordering 2 servings of the Wagyu Skirt Steak with Thai basil chimichurri because it was just that good. It melts in your mouth. I recommend coming with a group of about 4-5 people since everything is tapas style.

They took care of it immediately and a manager came over and apologized and gave us his card and said to call him if there were any dry cleaning charges. They didn't comp us any drinks or appetizers which I thought was odd for such a high class place. And, we all complained about dull knives for our steak and pork loin.

The Chef's dish that I remember that was on the happy hour menu (there were two) was described like hot cheeto fries. The specifics don't really matter since it rotates often depending on the whimsy of the chef, but that's just to give you an idea of what type of dishes are on the happy hour menu. \\n\\nThey have a good selection of beer and wine, but strangely no cocktail menu. I am not a creative person, so I like reading a menu to determine what I want to drink. I ended up asking the waiter if there were any special cocktails of the bar and he suggested a drink called That's My Jam. I was seriously just so happy that there was a special drink that I didn't really listen to what was in it. My mistake because I enjoy my drinks a little sweet and this drink was not sweet at all (think the taste of a Gin and Tonic). It definitely packed a powerful punch though and for $8 I definitely wasn't upset with the drink, I just wouldn't order it again. \\n\\nEven though this place's drink selection didn't really meet my expectations, the Korean Fried Chicken Wings were amazing. I've been to Korea (I'm actually going back to Korea later this year) and these wings wowed me. These are the type of wings that you swat someone's hand if they make a mad dash for a taste. The wings were plump, juicy, and incredibly tasty. It came with some pickled vegetables, which I wasn't a huge fan of, but with wings this good they were basically the same as decorative kale to me. \\n\\nI was a huge fan of our waiter. I've never called a waiter thoughtful before, but that is genuinely the best word to describe him. It was like our individual tastes were a puzzle to him and he wanted to make sure we had the best experience possible so he posed questions and really listened to the answers. I would give him a shout out, but his name wasn't on the receipt (and I have a terrible memory).

Just two years ago my sister and I really enjoyed the Rose & Crown but this time............. Because I was dining alone I was treated to a nasty little corner table out of range of the outdoor fans. I made a few simple tweaks to my order: salmon with carrots and mashed potatoes. (Same thing two years prior, mind you.) What came out IN A BOWL was a scoop of old, cubed carrots clearly scraped from the bottom of a metal cafeteria pan, tasteless texturally bland mashed potatoes and a blush-tinted portion of salmon the size of a toddler's fist. And not a large toddler either. It was clear the salmon hadn't been seared but I hoped for the best. And was quickly punished for my optimism by the sight of shiny, slimy fish flesh. Reminded me of my former employment at the Florida Correctional Institution. Can't quite remember why. On one of her fly-bys, I asked the server 'Kitty' for the check. She hadn't had time to ask whether the meal was satisfactory. Or palatable. Or apt to test my reverse gag reflex later that evening. She confidently whisked the barely modified 'food' back to the kitchen and brought the check. I paid it. Yes, there was a moderate tip. And on the way out, I asked to speak to a manager. What I got was Cinderella. From Norway. (I'm not kidding. That's what was on the nametag.) Cinderella assured me that she checks every entree before it goes out. Uh-huh. Cinderella also assured me that every piece of salmon is cooked 'medium.' Well, not this one. She offered me dessert. She offered me a drink to go. Very possibly the 'to go' part was the one she was hoping I'd agree to. And speedily. We compromised by agreeing that when I returned, she would comp the meal. (Just so's you know, I took the long way around and went to the food court at The Land where I dined cheerfully and happily on lean and tasty pork tenderloin, fresh green beans and the same mashed potatoes, except these weren't cold. And the meal was a third of the cost.) Oh, and I'll update this review when I return to the Rose and Crown for my promised free meal.

Prior to this I'd never had any experience with schnitzels. Google says it's a very thin and tenderized piece of meat breaded and fried originating in Austria. Fun fact of the day for me. Woo.~\\n\\nVerdict on schnitzels? It was tasty, would try again.\\n\\nSeven Hens offers up four ways to enjoy your schnitzel: platter style, baguette sandwich or wrapped, and salad style. We tried ours baguette style. Schnitzels of choice: Cajun BBQ and Ginger Teriyaki.\\n\\nThe schnitzel itself was crispy and fresh and made for a nice chicken sandwich type of meal. Out of the two the Cajun BBQ was my preferred as the Ginger Teriyaki was fairly ginger-y. If I'm ever back, it might be nice to try the salad version of one. We also ordered both with a side of sweet potato fries.\\n\\nThe fries had a nice crispiness to them as well, but I thought they were a little too salty. I'm sure you can probably hold the salt, but just my two cents. Not bad either way.\\n\\nAfter ordering you can pick from a small variety of seasonings near the drink station. I grabbed one curiously to try on some fries. I think it's nice if you just wanna experiment a tiny bit or want more flavor. They basically mimic the flavors already applied to the schnitzels.\\n\\nThe store was more or less dead when we arrived, but the staff was friendly and welcoming."},{"name":"Magnolia Cafe South","address":"1920 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"We used to love this place, not anymore.

I thought I should write a review nevertheless because I did find the place promising and because I am the self-proclaimed Greek-food authority around here. \\n\\nFirst the place is easy to find, there is plenty of parking around, and is fine in term of decor (not TOO many greek flags and Santorini pictures). The service is very good. But then you got to go up to the counter and pay. What's up with that? This is so 80's Greek dinner... Another little remark: the Greek wine list is pretty good (not excellent but good - try the Moschofilero, if you want to get a taste of a Greek grape) but served in tacky overfilled wine glasses. \\n\\nTo the food: I got the avgolemono soup and the spanakopita app (two triangles). Great for lunch or light dinner. They were both pretty good. In fact the spanakopita was VERY good. I thought that their feta cheese was a little too salty but most people don't consider this a problem. I also ordered a the moussaka + pastitsio plate to go (for my sig other at home). I had one bite from the moussaka and it was very good. But the bf told me that the pastitsio was not as good. The salad which came with that plate was a sorry excuse for a Greek salad (lots of lettuce, a couple of thick cut tomato pieces and some feta sprinkles), but the dressing was very good (I used it  to make my own salad at home). \\n\\nThe pizzas that my friends got looked very good (and they liked their taste). I would like to try some other dishes next time (like roasted chicken and potatoes and youvetsi). But I will not try anything with gyro (I know it'll be bad).\\n\\nPS. Another reviewer said that Greeks know their cheesecake? No, actually we don't.

For a meal, my favorite is their Flamingo Sandwich, it has avocado, alfalfa sprouts , chipotle mayo, tomatoes, and their special sandwich house sauce on my choice of whole wheat bread. It comes with a often soggy house potato fries. The fries are a-ok (if you dip them in ketchup), but golly, the sandwich is delicious! It is very filling too , a very generous helping. For late night snack, I always get their very delicious Magnolia Migas. I've got to say...they have the best migas in town, it beats Mi Madres. It is spicy with Jalapenos, the perfect amount of cheese on it, very very delicious. Ohhh...I want one right now just typing this! For desserts, my favorite is their Pecan Pie (Warmed up) ala mode.

I should have known to move or leave as when I sat down the guy to my right, paying his bill, said to one of the owners who was sitting at the bar doing paperwork \\"that's why I have a vasectomy.\\"  She looked at him wanly and said and did nothing as the young hellions ran around the room.  She quickly repaired to the back of the building, I'm thinking to avoid the spawn of the devil.\\n\\nThe hellions ran the aisles, and here is where the restaurant takes some responsibility rather than the terrible parent that brought them. One of the servers ran around with them yelling and laughing at their \\"adorable antics.\\"\\n\\nA final note, this wasn't a one off of a restaurant suffering a bad patron.  The guy that brought the kids was a regular - he talked to a guy behind the bar the entire time he was there, and his kids were rampaging the room.  That is not acceptable to me.\\n\\nGreat food or not, I'm not spending money to eat in a poorly run daycare center.\\n\\nAnd here's the original review.

This time, I ordered the chicken paitan as I have already tried the other flavors.  Sis got the akamaru which is the spicy one. It had 4 chillis but you can request to make it mild or medium if you are unsure if you can take the heat.\\n\\nAfter awhile, 45 minutes to be exact, our orders still haven't arrived so I thought I'd check with the server.  Turned out that our order didn't go through.  The supervisor came to apologize.  He prioritized our order and even offered to give us desserts on the house.\\n\\nThe ramen arrived in a few minutes.  Love that this time, the broth was really hot. Last couple of times I came here it wasn't hot enough.  The chicken paitan had a smooth, creamy, unami broth and I love it.  The noodles were firm and cooked perfectly.  The fried lotus root was a very nice touch (wish there was more) and the menmas or bamboo shoots were very flavorful.  I liked that there was a lot of green onions on this.  Egg was cooked perfectly as usual.  The only complaint that I have was the chicken chashu.  It was tender but way too salty. Good thing the broth and the noodles helped taper off the saltiness of the chashu.\\n\\nSo I have tried all 3 ramens and I would say that the kokuton (#1) is probably my favorite.\\n\\nThere was some misunderstanding with our dessert. When another server came to take our dessert order, she said that we can only choose one ice cream, which isn't what the supervisor told us.  Glad the supervisor came by again to check on us.  He clarified that we can have the matcha creme brulee and so we got that as well as the Panna Cotta with brown sugar.\\n\\nI love brown sugar and this one had depth. It was rich and caramely and so perfect with the Panna Cotta. The matcha creme brulee was the star of the meal. The hardened caramelized sugar was very good and it made a nice contrast when eaten with the matcha custard. The custard had the right amount of matcha flavor and the mint tied it all together. I had to refrain myself from eating the entire thing as I was sharing it with sis.  Although small in serving, I would say this is definitely worth the $5.  These are really good desserts.\\n\\nOverall, a successful meal despite the rough start.  Maybe other servers could be more attentive but  kudos to the supervisor for offering exceptional service. When we paid for the bill, he even said that he would be back with the change.  I think this is the right attitude. I've never seen such good customer service.

They used to be located near K-mart, but moved about 1 block down, they are on Millikan / Murray. Right next to Yum Yum Cafe. Their new spot if amazingly beautiful. Elegant dining, for a buffet. Tables all set nicely. Very clean. Bathrooms are nice and close to the seating area; closer than in the previous cafe. This is important to me as I have mobility issues (I am disabled). The food is more delicious than ever. They have a new soft drink machine and the drinks are 5 star now, you get more choices too. My husband likes Orange Creme. I have RC. Which by the way is hard to find and I have always liked RC. My husband loves the fruit salad (find at the salad bar). It's a mix of fruit like mango and peaches with a creamy sauce. He said wow they upped their game this is even better than before (at the new location). And I too love their food. I would say my favorite is the Chicken Makani, which I put over rice and get lots of sauce and dip Naan bread in the sauce. When we eat there, we both feel pampered and special. Two things: the price went up by $1 per person. Also, it's hard to get parking exactly in front of the cafe. I can't walk very well, so my husband leaves me close to the front door and parks 7 or 8 spots down. It works. In the previous place it was also a little walk from the parking lot. So no difference. My husband would leave me by the door and go park. The owner of the establishment, Mr. Abiruchi, is very kind and the wait staff is attentive and helpful.

After much thought and patience of the staff, I finally decided on poppyseed, cinnamon apple fritter, orange pistachio, shredded coconut, dark chocolate (cake style, I think?), and either blueberry or raspberry. All vegan. Then, I ordered a non-vegan salted caramel for myself as well as an iced almond milk latte. The birthday boy devoured the apple fritter upon arriving home. Needless to say, that was his favorite. We tried all 5 of the vegan donuts and enjoyed them. We also shared them with my sister and brother-in-law, who made a comment that the dough tastes the same for all the donuts. The only difference he tasted was the frosting.

I mostly like that you can get fresh, decent food that is leaps and bounds above typical \\"fast food\\" without ever getting out of your car."},{"name":"Baba's","address":"2515 Summit St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"I finally got to check out this little spot at the top of Summit, and I love it. There's not a whole lot of breakfast options besides the various griddle muffin sandwiches and a few pastry options, but the sandwiches are so good, I really didn't care. \\n\\nI got the chorizo, and my girlfriend had the sausage, and they were both great. I love the spices in the chorizo, and it was the perfect amount of food to start off the day. It comes out pretty quick too, and the tasty, bottomless coffee is great if you're just looking to hang out there for awhile. It's a cozy little spot, but there's not a lot of tables, so I wouldn't count on using it as a like a coffee shop. \\n\\nI've seen they have ribs at lunch time, so that's definitely something that will draw me back there, since I can't pass up a rib. There's a few other lunch options on the small menu, so we'll see if they expand the menu anymore. The food I had was great, and the food I've had from these guys in the past has been great, so I don't doubt that everything they do will be good. I look forward to heading back again."},{"name":"DEE DEE","address":"4204 Manchaca Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I have only come to Dee Dee a couple of times out of convenience: the first was while waiting for a La Barbeque order (which is no longer quite in the same area) and the second was to get something sweet, since it was a short walk from some of the breweries.\\n\\nDee Dee warrants a visit on its own. I only have two things to base this review on: mango sticky rice and Thai iced green tea. The mango sticky rice has a large amount of mango on it - I expected to see a higher rice to mango ratio, so it was a pleasant surprise both times I've had it here. They do a pretty good job with it and it'll definitely fill you up despite the diminutive size of the box.\\n\\nThe Thai iced green tea was amazing. Full of matcha flavor and just the right amount of sweetness. I would definitely go back just for that. At some point I'll also have to try the real food!"},{"name":"Clerys","address":"113 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"The short rib with onions grilled cheese ($13, +$1 for side of tots) was amazing! They probably added a ton of butter to that bread but who cares! Noms. I'll eat a salad later to balance it out. They give you a lot of tots for the additional $1. My friend and I went there around 8:30pm on a Saturday night. It was pretty empty and our food came out quickly. I didn't catch the bartender's name but she was nice! \\n\\nI've been to Clery's a couple of times and honestly, it's your typical bar. The place starts getting packed around 10pm (usually there's a line). Average priced drinks, loud music, and even a downstairs section for dancing. It's conveniently located in the Back Bay area for quick drinks after work. But not convenient for parking. There are surrounding meter spots and scattered amounts of visitor parking within the residents parking area. If you're lucky you'll snag a spot right across from Clery's on Dartmouth St. Non-resident meter parking on Saturday and Sundays. Back Bay orange line station is also one block up Dartmouth."},{"name":"Redbones BBQ","address":"55 Chester St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"After looking at the lunch menu I knew I had to order the combo special. It's a plate of whatever ribs they have ready at the moment, BBQ chicken, house-made sausage, dirty rice, beans and slaw for $8.99. \\n\\nIf this wasn't amazing enough, when my friend and I each ordered one the server looked at us funny and asked us if we were sure we didn't want to split one. We ended up taking his word for it that it was big and shared one order.\\n\\nWe not only gorged ourselves on a MOUNTAIN of BBQ'd meats and sides but we had enough to take home. \\n\\n...and for the record, we're both fatties so that's saying something."},{"name":"Magnolia Cafe South","address":"1920 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Best Eggs Benedict in town! I could go on about lots of items on the menu at magnolia and their being open 24/7 gives them a special place in my heart. The one thing on the menu that I find myself going back for is the wonderful selection of Eggs Benedict on the Magnolia brunch menu. On some days magnolia offers a special version of the Eggs Benedict called the Texas Benedict which comes with a chipotle hollandaise and sage sausage. This is truly as good as it gets when it comes to Eggs Benedict in this town. I only wish it was on the every day menu. So if your looking for a great place to have brunch on a nice Sunday I'd recommend you get yourself on over to magnolia cafe and here's hoping you can experience the glory that is the Texas Benedict!"},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I tried to  eat at Tasty n Alder during a visit to Portland last year. It was packed and they had over a one hour wait. I didn't have much free time as I was headed to the airport, so I found another less busy restaurant in the area to eat. \\nFast forward one year, I tried again, and was able to score a seat in the bar area. I normally prefer the bar seating anyhow. Lots of action. \\nIt was a weekday morning / brunch. \\nService was not so good at the bar. Our food took ages to arrive. Apparently they had some issue in the kitchen. I couldn't tell what was going on as the kitchen is visible from the bar area. But again, I was on my way to the airport. I gave myself sufficient time to eat there, but the delay in service pushed me to the running tight on time mode. \\nThe food arrived and it was delish. I had the beef with corn cake and egg on a cast iron mini pan.\\nThe margarita at the bar was disappointing even after the bar tender re-made it. \\nI grubbed down the food , grabbed the check and ran out. Didn't have much time to enjoy my meal."},{"name":"Jake's Ice Creams & Sorbets","address":"660 Irwin St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Way over priced. Paid $9.53 for 2 tiny ice cream cones.
