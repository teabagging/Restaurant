There is something for everyone, though.\\n\\nThere are plenty of themed stores that are fun to look around:  Ghirardelli store, Princess themed stores, Lego Store, Christmas store, and more.\\n\\nThe souvenirs I found here were absolutely perfect.  I found an adorable princess bag, with drawn images of Snow White, Aurora, and Belle.  For only $40, it was a steal, and I get so many compliments on the bag.  My mom and I also got beautifully drawn postcards that an employee suggested to purchase and frame, which was an amazing idea.  At only $2/postcard, these were also a total steal.  I found an adorable Belle musicbox that plays Tale as Old as Time that was very reasonably priced, and I needed to buy it.  We finally got a magnet since I get my mom a magnet from everywhere I travel to.  Another cute and reasonable score.  My mom got herself some really cute Disney plates with Mickey Mouse on them in a kitchen supplies store.  In the end, I think I spent $60 on souvenirs.

Oh, I'm not ungracious, I congratulate the winner and all the contestants, and I'm sure their parents are very proud.\\n\\nWhat I am interested in is the vegan/veggie hot dog, and not for the philosophical reasons of it being meatless, but from the marketing concept of \\"Do we make this thing taste like a hot dog, or can it just look like one?\\"  I also enjoy the irony of why meatless products should even resemble or taste like meat at all, but that's a whole other debate.\\n\\nThe point is the Hot Dog King makes an interesting vegan dog, but you won't confuse it with your typical All-American weenie. I actually thought it tasted like pizza, maybe it was the oregano; it's apparently based on mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes. Be that as it may, whatever taste expectations I may have had were more than compensated with my perception I was eating something at least semi-nutritious and healthy for me - I have no idea if it's true or not, but sometimes perception is reality.\\n\\nThe Hot Dog King is a trailer which I assume does the bar circuit at night, I found it working a Saturday morning outdoor car show. Cool.

This was an unpleasant surprise, but we'd made a reservation and it was already 1:30 when we got there, so we decided to roll with it.\\n\\nThe restaurant was nice, as was the service--in addition to the buffet options, we could also get a variety of made-to-order dishes from the kitchen, which were included in the price of the brunch. We concentrated on the buffet, though, as we were there to eat barbecue. We got meat from the butcher block, then loaded up on sides from the buffet.\\n\\nThe barbecue wasn't as good as I remembered, unfortunately. The brisket was excellent--brown sugar and coffee-rubbed natural brisket, very tender and flavorful--and I also enjoyed the housemade jalape√±o hot link. The coriander and maple-crusted Berkshire pork ribs, though, were tough and dry, a huge disappointment, especially for someone like Matt, who goes to barbecue joints for the ribs.\\n\\nThe sides were solid. I liked the new potato salad, the chilled sweet corn salad, and the heirloom carrots and avocado. I also loved the habanero honey pineapple, sweet and tart with a heat that really lingered.\\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered the berries and yogurt and a housemade cinnamon roll off the kitchen menu. The berries and yogurt were good, though it didn't come with pecan granola as advertised. The cinnamon roll was sweet and sticky and satisfying, finished with a gooey cream cheese glaze.\\n\\nI enjoyed this visit to Lamberts, but not so much that I'd go back again on another trip to Austin.

We ended up with a couple of their original cocktails which were served with fresh fruit and mint in cool tiki glasses. Both very good.\\n\\nFood: This is where it veered a bit from being a knockout. We ordered the pupu platter for 2, the pad thai with scallops and bacon, and the pork belly bao. The pupu platter was sampling of a bunch of different options ranging from roasted duck spring rolls to Thai beef satay. Unfortunately some of the options were no different than your average Asian takeout appetizer (chicken wings and  coconut shrimp ball) but I really did enjoy the duck spring roll. I was excited for the pad thai but unfortunately it missed the mark for us both - it was a decent noodle dish but the scallops got lost in the other flavor profiles. The pork belly bao was delicious though. Too often do you get stuck with just the fatty globs in pork belly dishes - this was done right where you got a crisp outside and juicy inside complemented nicely with the fresh crunch of cucumber. \\n\\nThe drinks and service were great so I'd come back and perhaps try different things."},{"name":"The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium And Savory Feast Kitchen","address":"Universal CityWalk Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I don't know how anyone can give this place less than 5 stars.

I also tried their sloppy jo slider. My favorite is the chicken ready slider so of course I had a couple of those. Make sure to get honey mustard to dip them in.

If you stop here, forget your diet! We didn't wait long to be seated and they were a little busy. Waitress was nice and attentive. The food - AMAZING! We had items from pasta, pizza to burgers (6 of us dining). Portions were large and the prices were a tad higher than other places we've all been to, but still worth it. Now, to fast forward to the cheesecakes. My favorite dessert is cheesecake, so that being said...here's the verdict on the ones we tried. First of all, one slice of cheesecake starts at 7.95 and go from there, depending on which one you choose and the portion size of course, and they are a very hearty portion slice!! So the first one was their Keylime...my son liked it, for me, it was good, but very tart. Now if you like tart, then you'll love this. For me, it was good, but I personally would not order this, because I'm more of a sweet taste person. Next, Chocolate Mousse, my other son loved it and for me I did too...(just so you know, I only sampled the ones my kids had ). This was smooth and had a nice chocolate taste. My daughter had their Chocolate Cake, but she ate it all, so no sampling there, but she said it was yummy beyond words...at least she saved me from some calories lol!!  Now me, I ordered 2 cheesecakes to take home, because I'm the only one in our family of 9 that loves Pumpkin, so yes, their Pumpkin Cheesecake was full of pumpkin flavor and very, very delicious. The other one I wanted to try, was their Tiramisu Cheesecake and that one the kids and I tried together and OhYeah!! Definitely a hit. So, if you ever try this place, don't skip on their desserts!!

Fortunately for me, there wasn't a line but I heard this place can get packed. There isn't much room to sit though as there's only a couple of tables and most of them get packed as soon as you walk in (and are mostly dirty because the staff are usually behind the counter not on the other side cleaning after the people who were there before) but anyways, I guess it's good to come and try it out at least once to see what the hype is about, but i don't think it's worth waiting in line for."},{"name":"Victor's Deli","address":"710 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"The chicken parm is sub par, the rest of their food is alright though."},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"This place calls for higher quality menu.

Extremely good \\"B\\" which they smoke in-house.   This sandwich has some kind of onion marmalade spread which is just outstanding.  Good bread, well toasted. Funny, how such a simple thing can be hard to pull off well, but they sure do it.  No, its not cheap.  But yes, it's worth every bit of what they charge for it.  Heavy rain at lunchtime yesterday seemed to drive everyone indoors, all tables were occupied when I walked in the door, but by the time I ordered, one opened up, and I noticed the staff was really hustling to get tables cleared and cleaned the minute folks left.  There are very few places in Austin that cure their own meat (much less smoke their own fish, like they do here).  It is a labor of love, and to do it well seems to require passion bordering somewhat on obsession.  This establishment reminds me of what Jesse Griffith is doing at his Dai Due Restaurant on Manor Road.  I have been to feral hog hunting , butchering and cooking school with Jesse, i.e am a little bit more fixated on bacon processes than most folks (and for many years I had a pet pig I raised on a milk bottle, named Patsy Cline).  There are worse things to be obsessed with, than bacon, try the BLT here and see what you think.  - William Osborn (owner of place down the hill with the old passenger railroad cars being restored)."},{"name":"Sushi Bar Kilala","address":"4749 Hastings Street","city":"Burnaby","stars":"4.5","text":"If you're craving uni, you need to go here.

On a weekend trip to Boston, we heard so many positive reviews about Mike's that we just had to stop in. The selection is vast and can appeal to every palate. My husband chose two pastries-- the black & white cookie (a typical favorite of his) and a peanut butter cannoli. Unfortunately the black & white cookie was so good that I didn't have time to snag a picture of it before it was more than half consumed! This was my husband's favorite B&W cookie he's ever had (and he's had a good amount of them). Kudos to Mike's for that! As someone who personally doesn't love a B&W cookie, I have to agree that this was a good balance of sweet icing with a fluffy bottom. Many B&W have a hint of lemon for the cookie itself but this one tasted like the top of a cupcake in the best way.\\n\\nThe cannoli was 'ok'. I'm not sure if it's because our expectations were high based on friend's reviews or if the excitement from the B&W cookie overshadowed the cannoli, but it was just 'ok'. The filling was very rich and very peanut butter-y (hubby also loves anything chocolate + PB) but I think the shell is what was most disappointing. It was not as crunchy as we had hoped (we were there before 12pm so not sure how frequently they fill and let the shells sit with filling in the case, BUT it also may have just been our preference on liking a crunchier shell).\\n\\n For us, we would go back to Mike's but would likely choose another option other than the cannoli (for variety-- a B&W cookie is always on the menu though).

The food was very fresh tasting and had nice flavor.  Small negative was that my mild requested spiciness food was definitely more medium to hot in terms of spice level.  This may be my fault because for some of the items they had to eliminate cream which likely made the items spicier.  With that said, we love Indian food, the food was good, the staff was very nice and I know that they take feedback seriously and will work to make sure that the spice level is a little more mild next time. I look forward to going back again and wish this brand new restaurant lots of success.  Lunch buffet does not currently have vegan friendly items but dinner ala carte menu has many items which can be made vegan upon special request.  I hope next visit I will be able to give this great new business a solid 5 stars."},{"name":"Superica","address":"99 Krog St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Tacos are out of this world!!!

However, the Atlanta restaurant scene has grown leaps and bounds since I first arrived here in the early 90's.\\n\\nThe Sunday Brunch buffet was around $20/pp in 2003 and $25 on holidays such as Mother's Day, Valentine's Day, etc. It was my go to place for breakfast with my wife, who really enjoyed the room dedicated entirely to desserts back those days. It was also my go to place whenever we had out-of-town visitors, but in 2007 they closed for a major remodel and our regular attendance was broken. We tried their other location for a while (Ray's @ Killer Creek), but they just didn't taste the same. \\n\\n-----\\n\\nToday (October 9th, 2016), was my first time eating at Ray's in about 7 years. I'd been here once since the remodel, but other than the dessert room being removed, I personally didn't notice much of a difference in the dining area. However, I did notice a difference in the food. \\n\\nIn the early 2000's it would not have been uncommon to see me doing a happy dance near my table on a Sunday morning. Ray's brought me great joy, not just for the food, the views and the ambiance, but they also added extra touches like magicians who walked from table to table entertaining diners. It felt well worth it to pay more than double the cost of any other buffet in that time period. \\n\\n-----\\n\\nNow, in 2016, the buffet was more than $38 pp w/tax and sadly, there were no magicians. Although I believe Ray's provides a higher quality of food for the Sunday Buffet than say Golden Corral, almost all buffets taste ironically the same when the food has been sitting under a heat lamp for a while. The BEST ITEMS were the \\"everything\\" omelet made fresh to order, the gumbo, flank steak, the salmon en croute, and house-made corned beef hash. There were also several desserts items that caused me to go back for seconds.The Eggs Benedict would've been better had it been hot and not room temperature, but to my surprise the egg was still runny.\\n\\nThe brunch menu boasts over 80 items of which less than 1/5th of them were of interest to my tastes. The items I did try I can only describe as \\"meh\\" including: sausage, pork loin, mixed rice, salmon pate, hash browns, chicken tenders, macaroni & cheese, crab stuffed mushrooms and biscuits w/sausage gravy.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nFINAL THOUGHTS\\n\\nOverall, I didn't think our meal was worth the $121 we paid before tip for 3 people. Although my omelet was delicious, an entire brunch does not an omelet make. I still have a soft spot for Ray's, but the options around Atlanta have grown tremendously over the last decade and I no longer think Sunday Brunch here is worth the price of admission. Food should be satisfyingly delicious at these prices and without my omelet I would have walked away extremely disappointed. Sadly this was probably my last visit to any Ray's location for brunch... and the end to an era where I once thought this place served the ultimate breakfast feast. \\n\\n\\n2016/114"},{"name":"Reed's Jazz & Supper Club","address":"9901 N Capitol of Texas Hwy","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We tried the restaurant on the second floor a year or two ago and were not impressed with the food or the service.

Let's get into this.\\n\\nLet me start off with saying this is closer to a 3.5 and I will definitely return and recommend as of now.\\n\\nI was very excited to see that there was a new vegan Thai place. I'm not a vegan/vegetarian but I play one from time to time. Told the boyfriend we had to check it out after fellow true vegan vetted and recommended it.\\n\\nWe headed here and after being led astray by Google Maps (kick rocks), we finally figured out where it was. Don't blink, it's on a corner and the signage is hard to spot. We noticed it because there was a movie filming right near it at the time.\\n\\nWe got here around 7:30 on a Saturday night, another couple was walking in at the same time and we were the only 4 in there. The space is lovely - clean, open and bright. Very modern-ish decor and seating. Someone else called it \\"functional and comfortable\\". Functional? Sure. Comfortable? Maybe if you are of a certain height (shortie like me) and weight (fill in the blanks). The 2-person \\"booths\\" are wooden and my bf didn't find them comfortable for his 6' frame. There are about 6 of these 2 person booths and one long table in the middle of the room with 5 tall geometic-ish chairs. There was also a random stool under our table. Not sure what it was for? Purse holder? Kid's chair? Extra shortie chair? I've got the 'itis and I'm gonna kick my feet up ottoman? I say all of that to say the seating is limited downstairs but there seemed to be another space upstairs which we didn't see.\\n\\nAnyway, the menu has all of the classic Thai dishes you would expect. We ordered the corn fritter app to start. Not bad but not great. The sauce helped give it more flavor. I ordered the red curry w/ veggie \\"chicken\\" and he ordered the Phad Kapaow (stir fried veggies in mushroom sauce). We were both very pleased with our dishes! They left the \\"chicken\\" out of mine and I had to ask about it. It was brought to me within in a few minutes but I still enjoyed the dish. Flavors and spice level were great. However, both of our dishes were a tad too salty. I went through 3 glasses of water pretty quickly. But, that can be easily fixed, Chef. \\n\\nShandon Anderson, former NBA player and 2006 Champion (with the Heat) is the owner of this beautiful establishment. With it being new, there are still some kinks to work out and I have faith that it will be done, I want to see this place stand and succeed. It's needed!\\n\\nWhat bothered us most during our experience? His Boys. You know Those Friends.\\n\\nThere were two gentlemen who showed up who clearly knew Mr.Anderson. Yelling out his name as they came in. Sitting around, walking back into the open kitchen (big no-no), chatting it up with the waitresses, etc. At one point they were sitting in the last open 2-person booth. Two ladies walked in and were looking around for seating. They were beckoning the women to come sit on their laps. o-O \\nThey finally got up and sat at the long table and one seemed to be bothered by this. The other decided to venture back into the kitchen. \\n\\nLooky here. I can appreciate friends showing support for your ventures. Truly, I do. But at some point you are going to have to make a decision on whether certain behaviors are hurting or helping you. (Big hint: Hurting) To the friends of Mr.Anderson - if you care about his success - let the man work and check yourselves, please.

The server came with drinks and we decided to put our meals in because we had an 8pm movie at the theater next door. There is no host so people were coming in and not being greeted, which was annoying when we were placed by the door. They literally just stood while the server were giggling with the cooks or just standing around. Appetizer of fried seafood came out and it was very good, though the fish was undercooked. Never was our table touched, no water refills or clean silverware. The party next to us ordered, waited, received cold empanadas and after waiting to even be asked if everything was ok went up to get someone. They told them it was cold and that they needed the check. The check never came so they left cash on table and walked out.\\nMeanwhile our empanadas were also cold inside but there was no use trying to get anyone's attention.\\nAt 7:15 we said we really needed to go so if we could pay and get ours boxed that would be great. The server assured my son, who had to walk up to the counter to ask, that food would arrive shortly. Our food came at 7:45 and we asked for check and togo boxes. Boxes never came but the check did.

Then we had expresso and bowl of plump sweet strawberries and whipped cream and a fresh strawberry cheesecake!!!

In order of most to least favorite, my list of hyped-up Portland donut shops goes like this: \\n1. Pip's\\n2. Blue Star\\n3. ??\\n.......... very far down on the list, Voodoo. But you should go just to form your own opinion. \\n\\nHere's a disclaimer: if you're looking for a specific type of donut, like a cake donut or raised or anything like that, don't come here! Pip's makes very small donuts in only six different flavors, so there isn't much variety. But their friendly, low-key atmosphere and comfortable ambiance makes this such a wonderful place to chat and enjoy life with your travel companions. \\n\\nI've had their chai flight each time I've come and I much prefer it hot to cold, even in warm weather. If I had to pick just one flavor, it would probably be Heart of Gold (coconut, yum) or maybe King and I (especially if you like Thai tea). My least favorite is Smokey followed closely by Emmylou (i personally find lavender mildly overpowering), but I like to order the flight anyway.\\n\\nI recently came in shortly after my sister's birthday, and we were pleasantly surprised to find that they are still doing a dozen free birthday donuts! Well, of course, we had to have two of each flavor. \\n\\nIf you're indecisive and don't want to order each type of donut, here's how I would describe them: \\n\\n- Dirty Wu: good, but the Nutella takes over. I'd probably prefer it without. \\n\\n- cinnamon sugar: classic! Cute, messy, sugary.\\n\\n- honey: such a treat! Probably my favorite. Something about the honey makes the donut seem warmer than it already is. Others may find the flavor to be a bit light but I personally love this one. Slightly sticky. \\n\\n- candied bacon maple: surprisingly good! I have to admit I hate bacon and particularly donuts with bacon, but this donut is perfectly sweet and salty with the perfect savory hint of bacon. It's my second favorite flavor so no one believes I hate bacon anymore. \\n\\n- Nutella: least favorite. If you've had Nutella, you know what to expect. \\n\\nIf you're traveling and worried about your next bathroom stop, Pip's does have two gender neutral private stalls in the back which are dimly lit but well-kept with changing tables and everything. AND parking in the area is free! Limited to 1-2 hours depending on how far you park, but still!

EPCOT is full of amazing food options within their World Showcase, and it's no wonder Le Cellier is hard to get reservations at. Luckily, we were able to snag one last minute on my Birthday-Eve-Eve. \\nI'll preface with I'm not a sugar lover, nor a Maple Syrup lover. I think Maple Syrup is great on pancake and waffles and even to dip bacon in, but I'm not Buddy the Elf and it's not something I feel would be a great flavoring for any and all food items...though Le Cellier may have proved me wrong.\\nWe arrived soaked from the thunderstorm and the wait, despite reservations, was about 30+ minutes. It seems no one wanted to vacate their table and go out into the storm. While waiting, we were given complimentary Maple Popcorn. Similar to Caramel Popcorn, but better. \\nWe started with the Le Cellier Signature Poutine ($10), Fresh-cut French Fries, Canadian Cheddar, Truffles, Red Wine Reduction, and it was hands-down one of the best, if not the best, poutines I have ever had. The other close contender being a Black Sheep in Jacksonville, FL. To compare, you can pay $10 for Poutine at The Daiily Poutine in Disney Springs and be given some sub-par fries and canned gravy (do NOT go here. Please, don't. Save your money, save your tastebuds). There is also another version of Poutine at Le Cellier;  the Montreal Poutine (Fresh-cut French Fries, Montreal-smoked Brisket, French Onion Gravy, Gruy√®re Cheese, Pickled Vegetable Slaw, Mustard-Beer Sauce) which we may have to try next time. \\nMy husband and I shared the Porterhouse Steak for Two ($119) which was served with Loaded Mashed Potatoes, crispy Onions, Lobster Macaroni and Cheese, along with B√©arnaise Sauce, and blue Cheese Fondue for dipping. \\nOur daugher got the Le Cellier Filet Mignon ($54), AAA Canadian Tenderloin, Mushroom Risotto, Asparagus-Tomato Relish, Truffle-Butter Sauce. She's tried the Mickey Kid's Meals and they're all the same - gross.\\nIt goes without saying the cuts of meat were phenomenal and delicious. The Loaded Mashed Potatoes were as well and the Lobster Mac & Cheeses was great. \\nThe winning side item for dinner was the Mushroom Risotto which accompanied the Filet. I thought the Mushroom Risotto at Palo aboard the Disney Cruise was amazing, nope. This one wins, hands down! I could have gorged myself on just this item. \\nWe finished with the Blueberry Cheesecake and the Maple Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e.

A hard damn thing. When I do make an exception to my self-imposed meat exile, I try to aim for grass-fed, humanely-raised animals. Luckily for people who want a non-factory-farmed option, for whatever your reasons are, Ray Ray's has grass-fed meat on Sundays. (Just beef for now, as far as I know.. if they decide to expand into pork, I'd be in bleepin' heaven.)\\n\\nThat, alone, for me, is worth the price of admission--and a very reasonable price, it is: $8 for a sandwich with grass-fed goodness, as opposed to the $5 pork sandwich that my husband chowed down on. We had an amazing lunch for $13 altogether, wat.\\n\\nAnd listen, y'all: I grew up in a town where we had an annual barbecue festival. When I got hit in the face today with the smell of smoked meats, I kind of wanted to weep tears of joy, despite the fact that the line was insanely long, the sun was baking my tender skin, and there was a horrendous girl standing behind us who did nothing but talk shit on everyone she knows in a bastardized corn-fed Valley-girl voice. Even having to deal with that? So. Worth. It.\\n\\nI was apprehensive, though. Usually, their grass-fed beef is brisket, tender and delicious and moist and fatty. It seems that they're having a hard time getting enough high-quality brisket to meet demand (cows only got so many briskets), so they were serving grass-fed bottom round. Bottom round is a leaner cut from the back leg, and I wondered: is this going to be good barbecue? Is this worth my $8 and my rare meat splurge?\\n\\nI reined it back in: it's Ray Ray's. OF COURSE it's worth it. They're quality fanatics; they wouldn't serve me something that's not good.\\n\\nI asked the gentleman behind the counter about the difference in the bottom round and the brisket, and he was very knowledgeable. He said some magic words--\\"like really good pot roast\\"--and I was sold.  He was right: while it wasn't brisket, it was tender and flavorful. I ate the meat by itself, with my bread as a side dish, just so I wouldn't dilute the flavor of the meat. It was damned tasty.\\n\\nA++, Ray Ray's.

We had tried to eat at Le Cellier for two years before we were finally able to snag an 8:45 PM reservation in the My Disney app. We arrived a bit early and were told to come back exactly at our reservation time as they were running behind (which is normal I hear). We ended up getting seated closer to 9 PM which, at the time was annoying, but the food and service made up for it. The dining room isn't as small as others seem to make it out to be, there was probably 150-200 people crammed into the cellar themed space.\\n\\nOur server, Jamie, was still training but handled us like a pro. We were greeted promptly and drinks came out fast. He was able to answer all our questions about the menu and gave great recommendations. Drinks were refilled promptly and we were checked on a few times during the meal, truly stellar service.\\n\\nFor food, we started with the beer cheese and french onion soups, both excellent and flavorful. We ordered a side of the signature poutine for the table and split two chateaubriands for the main meal. The poutine was good, a fancy version of your normal brown gravy type offering (which they offer at the Canada stand just upstairs), with a red wine reduction sauce and cheddar cheese. The $120 price tag for two on the chateaubriand is a *tad* expensive for what you get, but the quality is unmatched. You receive four pieces of med-rare medallions, a side of potatoes, roasted tomatoes and three dipping sauces. The steak is melt in your mouth good and had an awesome salty crust.\\n\\nOverall I'm very pleased with our experience even with the missed reservation time. I would definitely recommend Le Cellier if you are looking for a high quality, expensive dining experience at Epcot."},{"name":"The Cheesecake Factory","address":"100 Cambridgeside Pl","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"*UPDATE: Changed to 1 star, I refuse to credit them for our humor...\\n________\\nI apologize ahead for length, but it needed to be covered (I guarantee - my longest review ever).\\n\\nHere's some basic math equations for this visit:\\n\\nEntire experience - my fellow diners + time involved = EPIC FAIL!\\n\\nEntire experience + [my fellow diners + Visit to Dante's + time involved  (absurdity +lack of attentiveness +lack of manager response)] x booze x laughter = the only reason that this review gets 2 stars \\n\\nOK , well that and the fact that I am unable to give a zero...\\n\\nOur group decided that we need to go to the Cheesecake Factory to celebrate National Cheesecake Day with $1.50 slices of cheesecake. You would think they would be prepared, but I digress... So we all arrive at the restaurant with a party of 16. We are given a quoted wait time (after an agitated sigh from the hostess- ever so welcoming) of 2 hours... no problem, expected... change the number to 12, quoted a wait time of 1 1/2-2 hours. The bar didn't have space for us, so we decide to skip (almost literally) over to Dante's across the street for fun, frivolity, and alcohol. The pager wouldn't work over there so our quick thinking leader gives a phone number to call us so we can relax in comfort (this isn't a review for Dante's so I'll skip that). After 2 hours we head back to CF and finally get seated at the 2 1/2 hour mark. \\n\\nThe server (Paco) was nice and friendly got the food and drink orders. Two more people showed while he is taking orders, no problem, the table next to us left and it was added. Took a little while to get the drinks, but no problem. My martini was room temperature and I did not get the side of rocks I requested... ok, larger group, I'll deal.\\n\\nSo we ordered drinks, 1 appetizer, and 13 (that should have been an omen, guys) slices of cheesecake for here, 2 to go. Server comes back, they are out of the appetizer ordered- no problem, ordered a different Appetizer which came out in about 10-15 minutes. Then we waited...\\n\\nAnd laughed with each other and waited...\\n\\nThe two to go slices arrive...\\n\\nAnd laughed with each other and waited (notice a pattern)...\\n\\nLook around, tables seated after us got their food and desserts... and all the servers are sitting around the front of the restaurant chatting away. Meanwhile no drink refills were offered and most of us ran out of water (those that did actually did have water poured some of theirs into their neighbors empty glasses). We actually felt we were not being attended to because the server knew the gratuity would be added to the party. One of us gets up and informs the manager of our situation as we sit in the near empty dining room. Server comes back, I ask for water refills, they are refilled within 5 minutes.\\n\\nAnd we laughed with each other and waited (at this point for over an hour)...\\n\\nAnother member informs the manager we still don't have our cheesecake. Another server comes by and tells us there are only four people working in the dessert pantry (I have been in the business for 20 years and know that is insufficient for this night), OK, how about planning ahead? \\n\\nAnd we laughed with each other and waited...\\n\\nFinally, after 1 hour and 25 minutes of being seated, the cheesecake arrives. Delirious to see the Holy Grail of our quest, we dig in... it was good, although two of them were still frozen, but we dealt with it. Besides the restaurant was nearly empty and they were mopping around us- bathroom trip and exit from restaurant included sliding feet-- how about clean water, wet floor signs, and waiting until guests leave next time). I did not order a second drink since I was already over it.\\n\\nWe get the bill, nothing was adjusted, but the gratuity was still added (of course). It also would have been nice if the manager visited the table and at least acknowledged the problem. The kicker after we paid? The server (Paco) came over and confronting us about speaking to the manager and stated that she yelled at the servers in front of their gossip gathering. He also stated that they ran out of cheesecakes... hello... planning ahead? Or how about letting us know so we can select another instead of frozen ones? Summary thus far: 4 1/2+ hour cheesecake, good but not that good. \\n\\nSecond kicker? We got out so late the subway stopped running and the car was locked in the parking garage and we had to get a security guard zipping around on a Segway to let us out.\\n\\nSo if you want to go next year to celebrate National Cheesecake Day, I suggest the following alternative- July is also National:\\nJuly Belongs to Blueberries Month,\\nIce Cream Month,\\nNational Baked Beans Month (feel free to make the beans yourself from scratch- you'd still get them faster than the cheesecake...)\\n\\nAs for me, next year, I may wait for 08 Aug and celebrate National Sneak Some Zucchini on Your Neighbor's Porch Night (I swear I did not just make that up) with the great people I dined with..."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Was visiting Boston and felt like this was a right of passage.

It's gotten to the point where I enjoy going to Disney Springs almost as much as a park. There's so much to see, do, and eat here. What I appreciate the most is that if you want a high end dining and shopping experience you can have that but there are also plenty of ways you can have fun here without forking out a lot of cash. The parking is free and a delight if you park in one of the garages.  Not only do they have displays that show how many spaces are open, but there are also lights above each individual parking space that let you know if a spot is empty.\\n\\nFor treats you can get crepes, cupcakes, chocolates, etc.  My favorite is to head to Amorette's Patisserie where they have gorgeous desserts.  I usually opt for a Mickey cake that's a chocolate chiffon cake that tastes as good as it looks.\\n\\nFor shopping the World of Disney store is huge and newly remodeled.  The DisneyStyle store is also fun for finding quirky clothing.  I bought a enchanted Tiki Room polo shirt to wear to work. I also love shopping at Uniqlo.  I don't know how I ever made it through a winter without their fuzzy sweatpants. \\n\\nFor cheap eats your best bets are probably Blaze Pizza or Chicken Guy.  For higher end everything from steakhouses to Asian cuisine is available.  I've been wanting to check out Chef Art Smith's Homecomin'.\\n\\nFor unique experiences there are also many choices.

(Yeah, right.) \\n\\nWe walked in on Sunday morning around 10:30am and were seated immediately. The restaurant was fairly quiet. There was steady turnover but it definitely did not appear to be hectic or rushed... which became even more obvious when it took them over an hour to bring our food to the table. \\n\\nSo, for backstory, we were in the midst of a Whole30 and both eating paleo-style. There wasn't a whole lot on the menu that we could choose from (which is totally OK; I don't expect restaurants to conform to every fad diet!). We tried to rely on the server to help us eat well but still within the bounds of our diet. I decided to go for the Burnt Ends Brisket Hash ($25; brisket burnt ends, potatoes, peppers, onions, pepper jack cheese, two eggs any style), just without the cheese; the server assured me it was doable. My aunt kept it pretty simple and had just a side of bacon and green juice. \\n\\nAfter 45 minutes or more, the manager stopped by to apologize but didn't give an explanation for what was taking so long. He offered some bread service on the house - which... OK, but we weren't paying AND weren't eating grains so the \\"free\\" bread was more thoughtful than helpful. We turned it down. A few minutes later, the server came by with a bread basket anyway. Whatever. \\n\\nFinally, after the one hour mark, our tiny breakfast came out - a small hash about six inches in diameter, a side of scrambled eggs, a side of bacon and a juice.

After everything else, they couldn't leave out the one food I couldn't eat! \\n\\nThe manager comped a few items off the bill - which, again, we didn't have to pay. If we had, I would have asked him to comp the whole check.

Got the porter and it came in an 8 or 10 ounce kiddy glass. Bartender said it was because it was 10%.  In Seattle, you get a pint no matter what the ABV so $8 for a 10 ouncer was pretty pathetic.  Thought the $20 price for the brisket was reasonable until she said it doesn't come with any sides and those are all $8-$9 extra, each.  BUT, you can get a smaller version for $5.  I got the mashed potatoes and glad I got the $5 size.  Decent portion of brisket but nothing to write home about. It technically does come with some cold pickled veggies.

I took into consideration that menu items were subject to change, but there were no changes nor replenished items. Upon inquiring with kitchen staff regarding the availability of items, specifically mussels, I was advised they were no mussels. To make matters worse, for the food stations where food was available they were either missing tongs and/or serving spoons. \\n\\nThe dessert station was deserted - no spoons, no bowls, no plates AND no desserts, unless you count the store bought oatmeal cookies. The poor bartenders were continuously interrupted with inquires from unhappy patrons. \\n\\nI must say that this is not the Ray's on the River that I know from Thanksgiving buffet's in past years.  However, I agree with a previous patron who suggested that this needs to be remedied. As a suggestion, for starters, when you settled the accounts from Thanksgiving, confirming final amounts to be charged to various methods of payment, advise your vendor to refund the payments to the cards.

Firstly, love the market where HCT is located. We called ahead to place the order and it was ready waiting for us when I arrived. Let me start by saying I'm from NY so hot chicken isn't really a thing there, but I love me some fried chicken. So the combo of crispy skin with a nice warm heat from the rub was just about perfection. So tender, like nothing better than that. Then, with a dunk of the homemade ranch dressing, a surefire way to get some cool-spicy flavor balance. P.S. that ranch is dangerously good. I could dip anything in that and it would make me the happiest gal on earth. I had the meal option so it came with Mac and cheese and coleslaw. The slaw is made with apple cider vinegar so it isn't mayo-y at all, but rather a crisp, refreshing bite to follow the hot chicken. The Mac and cheese, as Bryant explained it, was  like grandma's. Simple. Macaroni and melty cheddar. I'd toss some ground pepper on there. \\n\\nThe vibe of the place is awesome with communal picnic-style tables, and everyone is friendly and helpful. They suggested I get the sweet tea and the banana pudding, which were sinfully sweet! But part of the experience, right?

Walked in, noticed the bar was pretty busy for 8:30am. Bar patrons were laughing and chatting which seemed to be a good sign that we were in for some friendly service. Our server, Brittany greeted us with a smile, took our drink orders (water and coffee) and gave us time to look over the menu.  The menu read well and we thoroughly studied it and picked our items:  Pecan pancakes, migas and an omelette. Items arrived to the table in a timely manner, however quite a few things disappointed me:  All items (including the coffee) were luke warm at best.  The cinnamon pecan pancake that I ordered was basically a rubbery pancake with cinnamon dumped on it with a pinch of pecans on top (I expected them to be incorporated into the batter), my omelette had a cold slice of waxy, processed \\"american\\" cheese slice on top (which I peeled off and shoved to the side of my plate).  Our server was nice to bring over a small side of shredded cheddar cheese to which I could put on top to replace the \\"Kraft single\\", but because my food was cold, the cheddar didn't melt. My husband's migas were also cold and his refried beans were dry and flaky. Although our server was very courteous, I don't think we will be back.

She got to choose the place, duh, so she decided to go with the place that Orlando Weekly readers voted as the best sushi in Orlando. We get here and first and foremost, the interior is beautiful. The atmosphere was dark, but the few light fixtures present were brilliant and popped in a way that made you feel like you were somewhere fancy. Only amplified by the giant, beautiful wine & spirits display smack dab in the middle of the dining room. So good. \\n\\nOur server was super nice. She greeted us, did the whole asking us if it was our first time thing, and gave us plenty of time to figure out what we wanted to drink. I got a mocktail that was a blend of cold brew and honey and something else. I don't remember what it was called, but it was delicious. Sweet, but not too sweet. \\n\\nI got two rolls, and I let our server choose for me. I said literally anything but lobster rolls. They just feel gimmicky to me. The first one she chose for me was the Siam (Shrimp tempura, tom yum mayo, jalapeno, avocado, yellowtail, ginger-lemongrass pesto, cilantro, tobiko, lime). Super fresh, not too saucy, the yellowtail was plentiful and forward, and the pesto gave the whole thing a ring depth that just felt right. \\n\\nThe second roll she chose for me was one that she said was off menu. They actually have a whole \\"roll\\"-o-dex that includes a ton of off-menu rolls, just in case there's nothing there that catches your interest. I don't remember what it was called, but I remember it has spicy tuna that was out-of-this-world tasty, avocado on top that wasn't too avocado-y thank God, and it came with two dipping sauces on the side. It was solid. \\n\\nI just want to say that I'm so pleased that I asked for the best two rolls that the restaurant has and I didn't get two rolls that were covered in sauce or smothered in tempura flakes. This place lets the fish and the other lovely ingredients sing without covering them up with goo. Good for them. \\n\\nMy girlfriend got the best thing, though. She ordered the Nigiri Selection (Ten piece chef's choice with thoughtful accoutrements). There were 10 different pieces on the plate, so it was basically a flight. Everything from wahoo to tuna to three different kinds of salmon. The most interesting one was the smoked salmon, but the best one by far was the salmon belly. It had some fat-ish marbling in there that made it the best bite of food from the whole meal. Wow. \\n\\nThe server also told us that if 10 didn't sound like enough that they have a 12 piece version as well, just so you know. \\n\\nOverall, I loved this place. I come from a place that has some good sushi restaurants, the Gulf Coast, and I hadn't been wowed with Orlando sushi, until now. Seito deserves the top spot for sushi, as far as I can tell.

This review  is however about the poor service and cocky manager who I unfortunately had to deal with. A few Friday's back myself and 5 friends decided on Vespaio as for a fun night including drinks (as we knew there would be a long wait) and a good meal. Just to double check before arriving I called Vespaio just to make sure they don't have a waiting list which I discovered they do not. my friends and I arrived to Vespaio and put our name on a list and were told the wait could be up to two hours, but they would do their best to seat us quickly. We all head to the crowded bar to begin our wait. About an hour and a half into our wait a \\"celebrity\\" from Friday Night Lights walks in with her two friends. They also Begin their wait at the bar along side my friends and I. A few minutes later one of the girls in my party went to check with the hostess on when we may be seated. She pointed to a table in the corner of the bar and told her as soon as the people sitting there are done, that table is ours. About fifteen minutes later the patrons from that party get up and leave. The staff quickly put a reserved sign on the table. The hostess walks into the bar area and and approaches the \\"celebrity\\" and sit her and her two friends at the  table for six with only three people that was promised to my party. After seeing this happen we all begin to get upset. I ask to speak to the manager, Daniel and never once get a formal apology although I was told if I ran a business I would have done the same thing... I actually run two businesses her in Austin, and would never talk to someone the way he talked to me, or treat patrons who had been patiently been waiting as second class because a pseudo celebrity entered my business. He does say he will send a bottle of champagne over to the table for the \\"misunderstanding\\", which was far from a misunderstanding as he admitted he purposely sat the celebrity and her party first after only being there for thirty minutes tops. After we try to get over the obvious snub we had just been subjected to  the bill comes and low and behold the first item on receipt a bottle of champagne. Needless to say I spoke with Daniel again and once again received no apology, simply a \\"oh I'll take that off the receipt\\" and a nod. I pay for our nearly $300 dinner and leave Vespaio extremely upset and embarrassed that we would be treated so poorly at such a typically great restaurant.

Regardless, definitely still worth it for the price.\\n- The cuts of salmon were much larger in the sushi.\\n\\nWhen I walked in to pick it up, the restaurant was cute and cozy and the woman who checked me out was very sweet and attentive.

I got the impression I'd have a good experience with a sit-down meal here.\\n\\nMy only issue (which may be my issue and not one of the restaurant, in looking at the other reviews) was with the rice. I can't say with certainty what was unfamiliar about it, but it either tasted old or like the wrong type of rice... it was definitely sticky, but felt or tasted different than the sushi rice I have at the sushi places I have liked (e.g., Ichigo Ichie in Franklin, MA). Again, I could have incorrect expectations about what sushi rice should taste like (other reviews explicitly mention how good the sushi rice is) or it's possible that this rice I picked up at 3:45 PM on a Tuesday was an off or old batch... either way, I absolutely recommend trying 3 Country Bistro and I'll certainly be going back in the future."},{"name":"Black Angus Steakhouse","address":"7516 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"Probably the best price for the best meal in the area.

I feel as if it has been decades since I have been here for brunch and so this was a serious throwback for me to attend for brunch this past Sunday with friends - and actually pay for myself.\\n\\nOddly, it seemed as if the food selection was much smaller than I remember from the past. Obviously, I cannot eat from the raw bar or the seafood station, but still it seemed like a much smaller spread that many other Sunday brunch buffets I have been to in the last few years.  They had the usual breakfast-type items (eggs, grits, potatoes, bacon and sausage) and then in a completely different location (pancakes, waffles, french toast and blintzes). The carving station had ham and roast beef, but the 3 times I went to the omelet station, there was no one there to make one for me.\\n\\nOther items were good, but not stellar - mac and cheese was over cooked and not really cheesey, overcooked veggie Asian dumplings and the cheese and cracker station not well attended.  Better items were the chicken pot pit (best part was the biscuit on top), the sesame chicken tenders, the steak with chimichurri and the pork loin. I was quick impressed that the eggs Benedict had a perfectly poached egg on top - not an easy thing to make and hold without it being cold or overcooked. \\n\\nMy biggest disappointment was the lack of any kind of syrup on the pancake/french toast station, the whipped cream was demolished and there was no one to ask for more. Also, blintzes typically have a fruit topping (and there was a sign), but there was no container or place for it. Many of the dishes would be empty and I did not see staff replacing them. We showed up at 1230pm and this was prime brunch time - not the end of brunch.\\n\\nDessert was good - the chocolate cake was great. The cookies were way over baked.

It is kiddie corner to Six Acres, Chill Winston and L'abattoir. The Diamond is a great place for cocktails, happy hour and night cap. The Diamond, co-owner Josh Pape also owns Wildebeest with co-owner James Iranzad. Josh Pape was a bartender at Chambar previously and James Iranzad owns Abigail's Party and Cartel Taco.\\n\\nThe ambiance at The Diamond is cozy and has an old school vibe with brass, brick wall and aged windows. Cocktails and highballs are skillfully handcrafted and there is a good selection of wine and beer.\\n\\nI welcome Absinthe, Campari, Vermout, and Bourbon during Happy Hour (on a Tuesday that feels like another Monday.) Though the drinks are wonderful, I can't seem to say the same about the food. We ordered an assortment of Prawn ceviche, four cheese dip and some hand-cut salsa and chips. All seemed very standard, bland and felt more from a branded jar at your local grocery store. French Fries are missing from the menu and would be a great additional - especially with some homemade ketchup! Nonetheless, nothing a great tasting Bicicletta or Moscow Mule can't forgive.\\n\\nBicicletta #2 $10: Campari, Italian Vermouth, Gerwurztraminer, Grapefruit Twist. A boozy drink semi bitter but delicious. I do like an Old Fashioned finish from time to time.\\n\\nMoscow Mule $15: lime juice, vodka, ginger beer. The Diamond uses premium Absolut Vodka hence the slap in price tag. This is a perfect summer drink. It can be easily made at home too with this simple Moscow Mule Recipe.  I also recommend the Isabella: sparkling wine, mango and ginger basil. Or the Penicillin.\\n\\nTricycle Grapefruit Radler: Try this sweet / sour combination of a Radler from Parallel 49 Brewing Co. Pours a cloudy peach color with bittersweet profiles of grapefruit and less apparent beer lager base.

Needless to say I had high expectations going in! Little Donkey just.. it let me down, just a bit.\\n\\nBefore I rag on it too much I will say that the atmosphere is lively and classy, and the food I ordered was tasty. I also love the whole concept - the restaurant stays open all day for all 3 meals and has a small menu that frequently changes on the whim of the chefs. Oringer and Bissonnette designed it this way so it would invite people to come back even multiple times within a week to sample the variety of offerings. I like that, I think it's a great idea.\\n\\nBut ok, back to the ragging! I was just disappointed in the menu of the night. I ended up choosing Hummus and Ritz (yes, hummus and ritz crackers) and Salt & Pepper Squid (basic calamari) and a drink and came out $40 later, which just hurts! Plus the server, who was otherwise very attentive, didn't know how a couple of the dishes were prepared. With a menu of only 6 or 8 items, this shouldn't be a problem.\\n\\nAll this said, I think Little Donkey has A LOT of potential and my loyalty to Toro and Coppa will rollover to this Cambridge experiment at least once more.

Lobby is well maintained. This is where the rest gets worse. The wallpaper down the halls to get to your room and the wall paper in the rooms are probably at least 15 years old. They are worn and have holes, etc. The \\"garden view\\" from the room is the car garden AKA parking and a weed grown \\"garden\\" to the left. Carpet in the room is old with holes. However those are just aesthetics. When you get to the functional part, there are lots of issues. The elevator sounds like it may not lift off ground floor or break. The lightbulb over the bed was out. There was a clock in our room but the electrical cord was just thrown on the table and not connected to any power. The clock wasn't even facing the right way so someone just threw a clock on the table beside the bed without purpose. I wasn't even able to locate an outlet on that side of the bed. Any tv channels above 10 couldn't keep a connection for more than a split second. The toilet will only flush if you lean your body weight to push down on the lever, almost to the point that you think you will break the handle and lift the toilet off the ground. The desk chair in the room as a piece of metal that cut my leg. The lotion in the bathroom had a broken seal so I threw it away thinking the maid would replace it when she serviced the room but she didn't replace it. While one thing may not be a problem, the combination of these things makes this hotel horrible.\\n\\nEdit: They moved us to a new room and this time in the main tower. I received a call in the room saying they were moving us. About 10 mins after that, I got a knock at the door from maid's manager saying I had to leave my room immediately so they can clean it. I was in the middle of work but I obliged. In the new room, the bathroom is more updated, and complaints from the other room are non issues; however, the room is just dirty. It is like they don't wipe down, dust surfaces, or clean the floors. Gross. This hotel has no attention to details. Pictures of dirt.\\n\\nEdit: I couldn't stand the dirt. I asked for another room change and showed them pics. I told them all I wanted is a clean room with things that work; I didn't care if the view or anything. They moved me to a room that was \\"inspected\\". This time the room was clean and things are working. But as others have said before only 1 of three elevators in the main tower works; this seems to be a running joke in this hotel."},{"name":"The Rolling Rooster","address":"13717 Mopac Service Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I went here with my husband and a friend on a Sunday and we had a good experience.

The youngest child is 1, so we brought him food.  We started with a raw tuna plate of sushi (can't remember the name), and even my husband said it was good!  He hates all seafood!  Like runs in the other direction!  All of the entrees were amazing.  The basil chicken was reported to be the spiciest.  Uh, definitely not...  It was the country pad Thai that stole the show.  A pleasant warming, followed by continuous runny nose for the remainder of the meal.  For me it was 5 glasses of water, because I'm not normally a heat kind of girl.  But I couldn't stop eating it!  Might be some of the best food from those 3 Countries that we have ever had!  \\n\\nOh, and this isn't what I would call a bistro.

We ordered individual bowls of soup noodles: the duck soup was very flavorful, but the meat isn't a good cut; the lamb soup was delicious and there are couple of thin slices of lamb. Overall, there isn't much vegetables in the soup, so it'll be wise to order a dish if you care for a balanced meal. \\n\\nAlternatively, one could order a big pot of soup to share. However, the cost is more as it does not even include noodles. The difference in taste lies in the noodles: in the individual bowls, the noodles are cooked with water before being served (thus, less starchy); in the communal pot, the noodles are prepared in front of you, and cooked in your pot (more starchy and flavorful from the noodles). \\n\\nVerdict: would definitely come back for the soup noodles!"},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow!

Half of the restaurant was empty / tables were waiting to be cleared.

It was flavorful, perfect consistency, and had captured all of the nuances of the beef that were used to make it. I barely noticed the lemongrass. Even though chili had been added, it wasn't overwhelming. \\n\\nEach of the meats that were added stood on their own - though I couldn't find the pork hock or belly. The purple cabbage was also missing. I was not a big fan of the thick rice noodle (so you may want to order the regular). \\n\\nIn retrospect, there was so much pork patty, which was tasty enough, but I would have preferred to have the ingredients that were listed or at least told that they would be missing.

As a lover of beautiful old buildings I figured this was the perfect opportunity to give Lamberts a try. Making a reservation was easy (I used OpenTable for a same day reservation on a Tuesday) and the restaurant called to confirm. \\n\\nWhen we arrived the ambiance of the place was hip and enjoyable. It feels very much like an elevated Austin BBQ joint- rough cut wood floors, glowing red light, and an open kitchen.The smell of smoke was obvious but pleasant: it said good things about what might be coming next. The restaurant was pretty dark for my taste, though, and it was very loud for a Tuesday evening. We definitely had to elevate our voices to be heard as we talked over our meal. \\n\\nThe first thing to arrive at our table was a plate of two cornbread biscuits - which was a little awkward because there were three of us. \\nThe service was friendly, and our food arrived quickly once we ordered. The sides are served family style, and our server said that main dishes were often split between the table as well. This is what we opted to do, and ordered the pulled pork, the pork ribs, and the brisket. \\n\\nI'm a northern girl, but I love to barbecue. Since living in Austin, I've come to appreciate the wide variety of venues that give you an opportunity to sample Texas style BBQ. There are some amazing and affordable places to get a pulled pork sandwich, brisket, or ribs. So for the price, I expected exceptional, elevated barbecue. Instead, Lamberts offers very standard fare. The ribs were good and properly cooked with a pretty good bark, but the flavor was nothing special. The pulled pork was tasty. The brisket was dry. I did really enjoy the sides we ordered: collard greens and waffle fries. The cocktail was delicious, but small. My husband enjoyed his Manhattan, but balked a little when he saw it had cost us $15. \\n\\nAll in all, we enjoyed our time here, but the only thing that stood out was the price.

As we were going through the line The GM made a offensive comment out loud to one of the employees regarding his race, me nor the people behind us found it humorous. However it was too late to turn around because we had already paid.  Next we get outside to the patio and it was disgusting, there were infant pants on the ground, trash all over the empty tables, and flies everywhere. We then waited for a young man to come and assist us. Finally we were able to sit down,after 20 min wait my food was delivered, it was extremely cold! After about 25 MORE minutes the same young man comes and asked for my friend's receipt because they couldn't find her ticket. Long story short it took 52 mins for our food to come out and when it did it was cold and not what we ordered. The GM brought out french fries with a smiley face on them because they had ran out of fries! We told him we didnt want it he said \\"you have no choice I can not refund your money\\". He told us its \\"POLICY\\" to not refund money unless something is wrong with food. I was furious because everything was wrong!

Now I live in Arizona and travel back and forth to Atlanta and spend many hours at the Hartsfield Jackson Airport, so I decided I'd give the Cafe Intermezzo a shot there! \\n\\nWell, I will say it is a lot different than their other locations (Midtown and Dunwoody). For one, their infamous dessert service is definitely not a thing they do at this location: typically at all Cafe Intermezzos, they offer a special service in which they take you over to the desserts and show you all of the desserts and help you choose! Really cool concept. I felt like this is what made Cafe Intermezzo so special. Even when I went over to the area where the desserts were, I was not helped and I had to go grab someone to show me what cake was what (on a slow day). This would be fine if they just labeled the desserts! \\n\\nThey also do not offer as many dessert options, but that is understandable since this is a smaller shop.

I think the star dish in my opinion was the french onion soup! It was covered with the most amazing blanket of cheese - perfectly toasted on top...the broth was really flavourful and the bread in the brown was well soaked and super yummy!

As a person that LOVES steak this was a question I wondered while reading varying reviews online and commiting our group of 5 to dine here when we were luckily able to snag a reservation at the last minute. Our experience with the restaurant's food was excellent and justified the price tag. Which if you are comparing it to a high end steakhouse is not that unreasonable. \\n\\nWe tried the following:\\n\\nBread basket 5/5: The soft pretzel lovers in our group really enjoyed the Pretzel bread. There are also other bread options in the basket that were warm and fresh.\\n\\nArtisanal Cheese Plate 5/5: Cheeses were excellent could use more crackers on the plate. Be prepared to spread cheese on your bread.\\n\\nFilet  4.5 & 5/5: Two people in our party got the filet. One was medium rare (5) and one medium (4.5). I would strongly recommend medium rare not only because that's the best way to eat the filet ;-) but because the cut was better.\\n\\nRibeye 5/5: Best ribeye my husband and I have ever tasted! The seasoning was amazing! Yes, there is marbling. Yes, it looks like blackened steak with quite a bit of char on it (something we normally avoid). Get over it and eat it. It's soooooo good!!\\n\\nPan-seared Red Snapper a la Paella 5/5: The person who got this assured me it was excellent!\\n\\nPoutine 5/5: Picky eater at our table got this dish. She was happy to be able to put the gravy on the side so basically had cheese fries with a side of beef sauce and aioli. Of course, I think putting the gravy on the side defeats the idea of the dish.\\n\\n4 Cheese Macaroni & Cheese Side 5/5: First, we had plenty of food without the side so we could have skipped it but got it to supplement aforementioned picky eater's poutine. It is rich and creamy macaroni shells, covered in cheese, topped with more cheese and breadcrumbs. Sadly picky eater is not a fan of goat cheese and once she detected it in this dish she abandoned it to the rest of the table. We weren't able to finish it but it was great. If your child is ok with goat cheese and likes mac & cheese this side could qualify as a meal.\\n\\nFinally, we had the Duke Caboom Nanaimo dessert. I actually have to give it two seperate ratings because I don't want to lower the rating of the majority of the dessert over the chocolate piece.\\n\\nNanaimo itself:  4/5 Very good dessert. The server explained it to me twice but I still can't do justice in the way I explain it here so I'm just copying thr description I found online. \\"A chocolate coconut brownie with vanilla pastry cream, chocolate gla√ßage, maple meringue, and black raspberry-chocolate chip gelato.\\" In layman's terms: the dessert consists of domed pastry made up of something like a slightly chewy chocolate, coconut cake on the bottom, a custardish middle, and a gelatiny dome covering. It is accompanied by a side of meringues and a scoop of gelato. I am not normally a fan of meringue but these were an exception. The only complaint I have with this part of the dessert is that the ice cream was half melted before we got to eat it.\\n \\nDuke Caboom Chocolate Piece: 1/5 Don't eat it. It's cute, take a picture of the chocolate piece and be done. I assume that the picture overlay one the chocolate causes some type of chemical taste but whatever it was it was not worth it. This was disappointing as we had a whoopie pie earlier in the day with a Mickey chocolate piece on top that was excellent chocolate."},{"name":"Lamberts Downtown Barbecue","address":"401 W 2nd St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Really hard to rank it a 3, but I just wrapped up dinner and I'm still hungry.  \\"Everything's Bigger in Texas\\", we'll not this meal.

TL:DR-my spouse and I were 86'd here by two women who had been consistently rude to us and messed up our orders. The owner's response is we hurt their feelings when they got our orders wrong. \\n\\nFirst I received a short nasty Facebook pm from someone who didn't indentify themselves then finally my spouse got a message from Noah that while more honest tried to justify their behavior claiming in his own words \\"here turnover is normatively regular and vast. This becomes exponential when unemployment approaches 0%, as is the exceptional case here in Portland right now. So I have a duty to my staff to keep them or no one gets bagels\\". Also saying \\"We mess up an order or two every day\\" but most people are fine with that and doubting they messed up more than a dozen times!! Wouldn't a few times be too many??? He admitted we were kicked out for making them feel bad about the mistakes they made and claimed that we are attacking them because they are straight white people. As a white looking mixed person & a white women that isn't the case. He also outed one of the women as \\"not straight\\" under I guess the belief that if you are not straight you can't be transphobic or discriminate. Sadly that's not how it works. He also seems to think him being in his words an \\"ally\\" his employee can't be rude or incompetent. He also tone policed & claimed I don't know what a schmear means which my Brooklyn bubbe got it wrong too.\\n\\nOriginal review: We went weekly since January at the new location & had problem with two workers from the beginning.  Pretty much since they opened the location one of them has almost always gotten our order wrong when she has taken it. At first we would take it back and ask for a new one but I could tell she was getting mad and because I love the bagels so much (I'm a New Yorker) I started just ordering the same thing every time and when it was WRONG I didn't even bring back. Over the last 8 months I've had my order wrong almost a dozen times and I didn't say a thing because she wouldn't even speak to us & was rude to us every single time we were in there after the first two times she messed up our order. When it was anyone other than those two people we never had an issue with the order and everyone was decent. In fact I went out of my way to be nice and polite to her every time I had to interact with her. Then last week I made the mistake of asking them to correct my order (they switched the bagels up, my spouse was cool with eating the mistake but I medically can't eat everything that's on the everything bagel so I had to get it changed). That was a big mistake. My spouse who is a butch queer woman had been dealing with them when they made mistakes after the first time because the blond girl was so rude to me the first time I returned an order, misgendering me & just being sullen. This time it was the other blond girl but both of them were there & the eye rolling & looks they gave me when I asked that they remake it with the right bagel made me glad my spouse wasn't there especially as they also misgendered both of us again but I ignored it. Since that time last week we were there two more times and had no problems until today. While waiting in line I said I'd get something different. I didn't see that at the counter were the two blond women. My spouse joked that I should stick to my usual so there wouldn't be any mistakes and that's when the shit hit the fan. In hindsight I think the one women was purposely messing up our orders in some kind of spiteful passive aggressive act and that the other women was supporting her & after my interaction with that last week it was confirmed for me that they were people who felt it was acceptable to be mean to customers but they proved it like I never thought they would. The one that messed up our order less, looked at us and told us they wouldn't serve us. They even went to so far as to say it was because we complained too much & had an attitude & they didn't like us. Mind you we only asked three times for our orders to be fixed when they have gotten orders wrong almost a dozen times. As queer trans people we have been discriminated more in Portland than in any other city on the West Coast. They had both given us nasty looks when we were affectionate with each other but I'd actually like to hope it was a personal dislike and not because they are transphobic or homophobic. As a former server & industry vet I know how hard service work but this isn't ok. I can honestly say I've never been banned from a place & I can't believe it was because a worker wasn't actually doing their job and was pissed that we pointed out their mistakes. When an employee consistently makes mistakes you don't reward that behavior and you don't kick out the customers that have to deal with their poor behavior. We should have stopped coming but I guess I came to expect the rude behaviour."},{"name":"Punjabi Dhaba","address":"225 Hampshire St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Came in with work friends, and was very excited for some authentic spicy Indian food.

I ordered Charlotte's 21st while my friend ordered \\"the one in a grapefruit. I liked Charlotte's 21st, it was light, refreshing and tasty. I tried my friend's drink.

I was not a fan of the sausage as it had different taste.\\n\\nBLT Lettuce wraps- We liked them so much we ordered them 2x.  It was small serving size. There was a difference between the 2 orders. The first order was smaller portions. The lamb bacon in second order was more charred.

Several other staff came by and were like \\"we will get your check.\\" Another waitress dropped off a copy of our check but we already gave our credit cards to our waitress.

The restaurant has been a staple of Davis Square since before I can remember, however, I can also remember it being much better than it was last night, as well. \\n\\nWe were seated quickly on a Friday night (a plus!), but seated right next to the cold-blocking curtain at the entrance. The curtain was actually touching the entire side of our table, and guests waiting in the makeshift \\"lounge\\" would unwittingly lean against our table, bump us, or elbow us through the cloth while we tried to enjoy our appetizers, tasteless French bread (yeah, the bread they serve is pretty bad) and wine.  \\n\\nThe oysters were perfectly shucked with muscles cut exactly against the shell, plenty of juice, and no errant shell bits -- kudos to the oyster shucker. It's rare to get oysters that excellently prepared, even in high end restaurants. I attempted to relate this information to our server, but he seemed distracted and didn't understand the praise.\\n\\nImmediately after our entrees were brought out (about 45 minutes after we initially sat down) the hostess came and removed a table from our row, making room to drag our table farther away from the curtain. Normally, I'd be upset about hostesses moving tables mid-meal, but I was so grateful to get away from the curtain, this was a welcome change.\\n\\nMy salmon entree was good, and cooked exactly as I asked it to be cooked (lightly seared, raw center), although the two giant chunks of roasted sweet potato (no butter, no other preparation -- just potato) were odd, and not quite as tasty. The red sauce sauce and cheese served with it was also good. \\n\\nWe had an interesting table discussion debating over whether or not my boyfriend's risotto (Italian for \\"rice\\") was *actually* made out of rice, perhaps due to a misunderstanding by some Italian-speaking cook. He remembered the risotto fondly from years ago, but was disappointed by how tasteless and odd it was this time. Honestly, it really could have been actual rice. It also came with a red sauce, which was odd. According to our server, red sauce is traditional for risotto (which is completely untrue, according to my experience and a large amount of puzzled research done at the table last night. Risotto is a North Italian dish always served with a white sauce). I could have accepted the odd sauce choice as an inspirational choice by a good chef, however, given the overall terribleness of the dish, it seems like an oversight. \\n\\nAfter an initially-incorrect dessert order was quickly corrected, we had our dessert (flan and a cannoli) with coffee. The desserts seemed pre-packaged and were served simply, but at $6 each, were satisfying. This is an entree place, not a dessert place! \\n\\nAll in all, a solid three stars. There are much better Italian places in the area to go to if you want a $100/two people meal, but the dining experience did have some highlights.

We had 2 of each flavor: cinnamon sugar, raw honey and sea salt, Nutella and sea salt, candied bacon maple, the dirty wu, and banana custard. The honey and cinnamon sugar ones were good but plain, but I was immediately impressed by the candied bacon maple, considering I traditionally haven't enjoyed bacon donuts. The bacon paired perfectly with the donut's crispness and sweet but not too sweet flavor. The miniature size of the donut is great for sampling multiple flavors without getting bloated or tired of eating just one flavor. I also usually don't like chai, but the Emmylou was soooo good! I'm a sucker for lavender flavored things, and all the flavors (lavender, chamomile, fennel) came together to make a perfect cozy drink."},{"name":"Cafe Intermezzo","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy, Councourse B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Wish I could give them no star!

My food arrived in about 15-20 minutes, however I still had not gotten my cappuccino. Both the croque monsieur and side potatoes were so salty, I couldn't eat it. My cappuccino finally arrived a little less than 10 minutes later and was cold. I usually don't like to send food back, but I had to send my meal back as it was just inedible. The waitress asked if I wanted anything else and against my better judgement, I ordered some wheat toast and scrambled eggs. When that finally arrived, the eggs were burned, like blackened!! How do you burn scramble eggs and then proceed to serve them to a customer?! Unbelievable! The waitress looked embarrassed to bring over the food as she literally plopped it down and quickly walked away. She never came back to my table! I had no utensils and had to literally yell to get her attention for utensils which she again plopped down and quickly walked off.

Zero thought given to those with mobility issues. For garage near amc theater, may have to take two different elevators, transferring once depending on floor you park on.  Not as many ingress and egress points as before, so you should do research beforehand to decide which parking garage is closest to the shop or restaurant you wish to visit unless you like walking miles.  I foolishly assumed that once we were done eating that I could go get the car and pick up the senior in our group.  Nope, she had to use her walker all the way back to the garage due to the fact that the access was barricaded for most of the front of the venue and all the way back to the garage.  So even if I had been able to go get the car, there was no way to pick her up. Also, the ramp that gets you from the hot air ballon ride to the Irish restaurant is very steep and has a massive bump out.  My mother almost hit the ground when her walker struck the bump out.

But then all that is lost once you step into the main dining area, which is quite bare in comparison. Plus it's ridiculously dark inside making it hard to read the menu. Our server was nice but sort of nonchalant about everything. All the food items sound good but didn't really give that \\"wow\\" factor.

I held out on all my other cannoli opportunities in Quincy Market so I could try Mike's. This place is cash only! This is a famous Italian cannoli shop that has been around since the 1940s. This is the 1st of their 3 locations. There is no outdoor dining option but there are a few tables inside on the left of the shop. The shop is mostly a large space that is empty in the middle because I imagine they get super crowded and do not have space for people to stay and dine. I like that they have giant signs with pictures of their cannoli flavors in the center of their wall. They have less dessert options compared with Modern Pastry down the street. I tried the Amaretto cannoli and a hazelnut one. I liked the Amaretto one a little more. They have more cannoli flavors than Modern Pastry does but Modern Pastry lets you customize it. The cannolis here are larger than the ones at Modern Pastry. I thought it was so unique and funny that the strings used to tie the boxes came from the lamp-looking pendants from the ceiling. Outside of cannolis, they also sell cookies and biscotti. Service was super quick because they have a ton of workers behind the counters. The cream inside the cannolis are cold so I think you need to keep it refrigerated if you're not eating them right away. They make for a great dessert to bring to potlucks. This was better than the cannoli I had when I was in Venice, Italy.

Two, join the line snaking over to the cashier.  Three, pay the cashier for the meal you want (don't forget a drink).   Four, pick a table, place your number out where it can be seen clearly, and wait to be served.  It's cafeteria meets traditional and it's nifty.  \\n  I had the classic cheeseburger plate.  Perfect temperature, piled with fresh ingredients, cooked exactly the way I like it - medium rare.  Yum.  The fries were just okay, though (apparently just an afterthought).  Though the fountain drinks were pretty eclectic:  cane cola, red birch, and creme three of the seven options. \\n  Overall, a pretty cool experience, if a bit pricey- truly fresh doesn't come cheap.

Over the years, the identity and image of DTD has changed - even as I type this, there is a major renovation underway which will change DTD as we know it (more later).\\n\\nRight now, however, DTD is separated into three sections: the Marketplace, Pleasure Island, and the West Side. The Marketplace, as the name suggests, houses a number of shops and restaurants to browse (most of them being Disney related). Some standouts for me are the market co-op which is a mini indoor flea-market type mall, and The World of Disney which is probably Disney's biggest retail store on property. There's also a good selection of Disney and non-Disney restaurants located here. \\n\\nPleasure Island *was* the \\"adult\\" section of DTD, consisting primarily of dance clubs and bars. A few years back though all the clubs were shut down and Pleasure Island has been nothing more than a name since, however it's currently under construction into Disney Springs so we'll see what becomes of it. \\n\\nThe West Side has slowly become my favorite area of DTD - it's edgier than the marketplace and has a lot of shops and eateries. There's a bowling alley here, an AMC movie theatre, Cirque du Soleil, a Starbucks, plus a bunch of restaurants including the House of Blues and Raglan Road Irish pub - they also have a few food trucks stationed on the West Side offering a number of dishes. \\n\\nDTD is currently transitioning into Disney Springs, which is going to combine some of the already existing areas of DTD with new construction to create a whole new experience - I'm looking forward to seeing it when it's done. \\n\\nOverall, DTD is enjoyable - my only real criticism right now is the transportation; it's far from most Disney resorts and you can only get there by bus. Moreover, they group lots of resorts together on one bus so getting to and from DTD can take a long time. The construction also puts a dent in the ambiance of DTD, but it's only temporary. It's a good alternative to the parks and worth visiting at least once on your trip."},{"name":"Massimino's","address":"207 Endicott St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"We love massininos!

Showing up unannounced (I didn't feel the need to call ahead for this casual eatery), the restaurant did a pretty respectable job of handling our large crowd.  Even Cynthia N. approved.\\n\\nAll banh mis (Vietnamese sandwiches) are now $3.00 each.  Some sandwiches used to be $2.50, but they're all the same price now.  The restaurant still runs their volume special: buy 5 banh mis, get 1 free (to-go orders only).  Credit card minimum is $10.\\n\\nI always stick to my favorite standby: the banh mi dac biet a.k.a. \\"Lee's Special Sandwich\\" on the menu.  They don't tell you what's in it, unless you ask, and even then I'm not sure they'll tell you everything.  Along with the usual cucumber, cilantro, and jalapeno, it's got head cheese (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_cheese) as one of its ingredients.  The banh mi cha ca (fish sandwich) is pretty solid too.  The fish is served chopped up in patties similar to fish cake, served piping hot.  One to two sandwiches do a good job of filling me up.\\n\\nThe combos, where you get half a banh mi and a small bowl of pho, look filling as well.  I've yet to try the pho at Lee's, but will have to force myself on my next visit just to see what it's like.  The pho looks decent.  It's just that their banh mis are too tempting to pass up.  Also, according to Melissa M. and Marty J, the banh mi trung (scrambled egg sandwich) is very good.  Also on my list of things to try.\\n\\nI did try a new appetizer last night, the banh cuon (rice flour crepes filled with ground meat).  The rice flour crepes are glutinous and are similar to the Cantonese dim sum item cheong fun (rice noodle rolls).  The crepes are good, but you need to eat them with some kind of sauce (Vietnamese fish sauce is provided).  The dish is served with some fresh greens and bean sprouts.  Aaron D. and I noticed the bean sprouts were soggy, like they'd been steamed or something.  They weren't fresh and crispy like the bean sprouts served with pho.\\n\\nThe smoothies here are decent.  I've tried both the avocado and the taro.  The avocado is made with real avocado.  Lee's version is thick and creamy.  You won't find many avocado chunks in the smoothie.  They blend it pretty well.  I really like the taro, though I'm not sure if they use real taro.  The taro smoothie is bright purple, very sweet, and icy.  The smoothies are kind of big, so you may want to consider splitting one with another person.  Condensed milk FTW."},{"name":"La Riviera Gourmet","address":"390 Washington St","city":"Wellesley","stars":"3.5","text":"I came and had a delicious Southwestern Chicken sandwich for lunch.

I do like that, being a fresh seafood joint. AND, the market prices were very reasonable. So far, so good.  I'd been craving oysters on the half, so I ordered six of those.  They were OK; I've had better, but they were good-sized, and satisfied a craving I'd had since December, when I almost ordered raw oysters at Shoal Creek Inn.  I then, to go along with what all the Cool Kids were doing, got a half pound of boiled crawfish.  They were seasoned pretty well; there were varied sizes, including some baby lobster-looking things. They threw a half corn cob in for laughs (then charged me .75 for it!)  I ate it, just for laughs. \\n\\nThis joint is a solid four-star all the way. Food--good, not amazing. Decor--decent, not ghetto. Cleanliness--clean, not sparkling. The dining room was a bit crowded, and it was a noisy place, but overall, I'd go back without hesitation.

Should I get the Hot? Would it be TOO HOT? Would my face melt off? I ordered the Hot anyway, and I was pleased to learn that, yes, it is spicy, but it is not Death Hot if you regularly eat things like hot wings or similarly hot foods.\\n\\nWe went back today, and the Hot chicken was a LITTLE hotter than last time, but still well in the realm of tolerable. \\n\\nBut that's for me. Here's my gauge of Things That Are Too Hot:\\n\\n-- Raw, and sometimes cooked, jalapenos, are frequently too hot for me. Jalapeno hot sauce is not.\\n-- I once accidentally ate habanero salsa from a local taco place and I felt like I was going to die.\\n-- I'm a baby about cayenne a lot of the time, but the cayenne in hot chicken is mostly okay for me.\\n-- I love chicken wings, but usually eat them \\"medium\\" to \\"hot\\". I'm definitely never a \\"blazin'\\" or \\"nuclear\\" or \\"volcano\\" kinda girl.\\n-- Sometimes Flamin' Hot Cheetos are too hot for me.\\n\\nSo, I'm definitely not an iron-tongued person who can eat ALL THE HOT. I find that the Hot grade chicken is just about perfect for me. The crust is super-spicy, but the inner chicken and the homemade ranch cool it down just enough. My lips have just about stopped burning.\\n\\nThe flavor of the hot chicken is worth the burning sensation that will accrue. They do serve a cold chicken, which I haven't tried but which I have heard is very seasoned (in case you're sensitive even to having things like black pepper in your food). I go for the hot because, well, I like burning.\\n\\nWhen we went for the Yelp event, we each had a full meal including two sides and sweet tea; when I went back today, my husband got the full meal and I just got a piece of chicken. I liked the sides okay, but I found the mac and cheese on the greasy side and I don't love vinegar-based cole slaw (theirs is good, it's just my own preference). They were super accommodating.\\n\\nDat sweet tea, too. If you like sweet tea, theirs hits a good note between refreshing and sweet--it's not Deep Southern Syrup Tea.\\n\\nIt's a little pricier than I could have regularly--for hubs and me to eat full meals, it would be almost $30. That, for me, is quite a bit, especially for the casual take-out-style setting of HCT.

Reviews can come from friends of an owner who has encouraged them to write a good review or a bad review from the owner of the competing restaurant across town. Long lines are also not good indicators in Portland. These flip flop wearing luddites wait in line for a plate of eggs at any breakfast place every Saturday. But i had heard that Pips was delish and despite the wait, and being a doughnut stalker, i would not be disappointed. Ok they are small. Ok there is a limited menu. Got it and that's, well... O.K. I ordered salt and honey and the sugared cinnamon. They came out with an order of chai which though a bit too sweet for my taste was light, foamy and put a smile on my face. The doughnuts however, wiped it straight away. There is no parsing the tastes and textures because only one sensation came through: boy are these greasy. I took a second bite unbelieving of what just happened. Surely, i must be imagining that this line of unwashed parents and their whiny children must be hearing Yanny while I am hearing Lauren. The second bite proved no better. On from the sugared grease to the salty grease was not a satisfying venture either. Indeed it was worse. Even the garbage can would not accept my \\"to go \\" cartons. So i carried the two boxes- each with 3 remaining doughnuts back to my car where they remain locked in the trunk. No chance for escape. Which reminds me, i need to remove them before the grease penetrates the cardboard and stains the carpet. I really wanted to like this place. Honest i did. But i have to remember, some folks wait on lawn chairs for 24 hours to watch the Rose Parade and will form a queue for tickets to see Gallagher.

They no longer have than on the menu but you can still order it just ask your waiter. This past weekend when they ran out of grits I opted to get the blueberry waffle and bacon. Nothing spectacular about it but it was good. \\n\\nFor an appetizer I would suggest the donuts! They are really good and comes w/ 3 different dipping sauces. \\n\\nThey don't have unlimited mimosas (womp womp) but you can order a pitcher of it and it serves about 4 glasses.

You have the option of choosing the spice level of chicken (I got warm), and can choose to get either drumsticks, wings, dark meat, white meat, or boneless chicken in the meal. In addition, all the meals come with sides of mac and cheese and coleslaw. The mac and cheese is pretty average, but the coleslaw is really tasty when you mix in the ranch sauce. In terms of the ~main~ attraction, the chicken is juicy, tender, and full of flavor with the right amount of crisp on the outside. The bread underneath is great too since it soaks up some of the flavor and sauce from the chicken. Lastly, washing everything down with a refreshing sip of their free, sweet tea really brings the meal altogether.

For me, the gold standard in town is still Kintaro on Denman, and my bias towards their style of doing things may be obvious as you read on...   \\nMy wife and I went for the first time a couple of weeks back in the evening, and the floor manager admitted sheepishly that they had just run out of broth!  No soup for you!  She graciously gave us a couple of 15 dollar coupons for what she hoped would be our return visit.  Well, not wanting to pass up a free ramen lunch, we took the plunge today.  It was... okay.  Not great, but okay.   \\nFirst off we got the requisite glasses of water poured for us, which I nearly promptly spat out.   I asked the waiter if they had a water filter installed in their main intake, and he said \\"no\\".   No shit...  I did a lot of swimming as a kid, and swallows a lot of pool water.   This water had so much chlorine in it, that it wasn't drinkable, at least without wearing water wings.   I advised that this may have an impact on their broth preparation, but I don't think my unasked for suggestion was exactly welcome...\\nI had the Shiru ramen, and my wife had the spicy miso ramen.  I found my broth thin, and a little salty, even for this old sodium freak.   2 slices of lightly grilled pork belly, a bit of seaweed, and some bamboo.   The noodles they use are much thinner than typical ramen noodles, and while they were properly al dente,  they were not my fave.  My wife's spicy miso broth was very tasty though.  So for 13.95, you get a smallish bowl of ramen, served in a peculiarly shaped near-conical bowl, as opposed to the basic 9.95 ramen at Kintaro.  Sure, the counters are nicer here, and it aspires to an ambience of quiet sophistication, but I'll take downmarket ambience anytime if the food is awesome.

What if I had been vegetarian OR had a serious allergic reaction?  I felt a little sick to my stomach and got a little clammy and sweaty.

For a special occasion I took my family to this restaurant.  I don't think I could be more disappointed. \\n\\nI will start with the service we received. There was no service. A server asked us on arrival how many people in our party . I informed her 3  people. Two adults and one child. She said it would be a minute and then turned around and walked away.\\n\\nWe waited 5 minutes and watched the staff ignoring us. Several tables were empty but needed to be cleared of used plates and uneaten food. Two more groups entered the restaurant after us and waited. During this time no staff even asked those groups how many in their party or indicated how long of a wait for a table.\\n\\nThe employee who first spoke to us had gone to the till to attend to customers paying.  There was no indication after 5 minutes of waiting that we were going to be seated. So I approached the register where the same server greeted us at the door and asked if we need to wait or sit ourselves up. She rudely replied\\" can you wait a second, I said it would be a minute\\".  she had a look of disgust on her face like I offended her for approaching her. She thematically continued typing at the register till.   \\n\\nI thought of leaving right then and there but we drove about 20 min to check it out so we thought \\nWe will give it a chance, maybe the food will redeem this nightmare .\\n\\nWe got our table about 8-10 minutes later . I asked the male server handing us the menu if the female server that gave us the rude attitude was the wife's owner and he said \\"no. She is one of the staff server \\". I asked him what her name was.   He smiled and walked away. My hubby told me to let it go. \\n\\nSo we proceed to ordering our food. We started with the escargot which is next to bland , no taste , dry and very hot . it was served in a sizzling plate.  Next we ordered the duck confit also served in a sizzling plate  and doesn't even looked like the advertised product. It's was burnt, over cooked and chewy. The duck leg looked so sad and ugly sitting in a bed of white beans accompanied by one home made sausage that I can't even finish. For the price tag of the duck confit , I could easily enjoyed a bottle of Mo√´t & Chandon.\\n\\nMeanwhile, My hubby ordered the Pho which he said is rated 2 out 10 and can easily find a Vietnamese restaurant that can served better Soup than this. My little girl got the spring roll with meatball and vermicelli which she also did not eat and were all taken home in a plastic container . It tasted bland , hot and smell like all the food was garnish with same herbs and spices.\\n\\nAll in all, it's a no star rating, Zero customer service. Overpriced mediocre food . \\nProbably the owner doesn't even  know that the people representing his business are acting up like they own the place and does not give a flying fart if the service is up to the standard. If you're looking for Vietnamese PHo, there's tons of places spread throughout the VAncouver area with better service, quality and pricing.  DO NOT GO HERE. \\n\\nBtw, the take out food ended up in the garbage as it smells very funny.

I sent my salad back of course, which took another 15 minutes before the correct salad came out.  We never received the veg side.  We finish the meal and get the bill, which we asked to split (our family and our friend).  We get the receipts to sign and the server charged both orders to one single card (two charges though).

Thank goodness we did, because when we got there and were waiting for them to prepare our table, they were turning away people saying that they are completely booked for the rest of the night. This place is super popular. Popular enough to be the 3rd best theme park restaurant of 2018 according to the readers of Orlando Weekly.\\n\\nWe got seated promptly and looked around. The whole dining room is almost in one giant room with huge columns spaced throughout. It was a smaller space than I was expecting, but the illusion of our only light being cande light made it feel super cozy and intimate and enjoyable. \\n\\nSo let me start with the bad. The service was pretty lackluster. The girl was super nice when we saw her, but we didn't see her anywhere near enough to have an adequate amount of drinks on our table. She also didn't mention our anniversary that we made the reservations for. All Disney restaurants do that. So that was a bummer. First world problems, I reckon. \\n\\nNow, for the reason I gave this place the fourth star, our appetizer. From the Larder: Pig, Pig, and More Pig (Pork Mortadella, Maple-Pepper Buckboard Bacon, Pork Rillettes, Whipped Pork Fat Butter, Artisanal Cheeses, and Accompaniments). \\n\\nThis was the best appetizer I have had at all of Disney World with a close second being (or maybe it's tied with) the bread service at Sanaa with all those accompaniments. The bacon was superbly seasoned with the maple and the pepper flavors, a delightful combination. I don't really know what a rillettes is, but it was also wonderful. Very fatty and decadent. And that whipped fat pork butter. Oh my God, I wish I could have taken some of that home and used it on everything I ever cook. The flavor was so strong. SO strong. Take only a little bit at a time, because it'll shock you. A 5 star appetizer. Get this. \\n\\nThe entrees were absolutely fine. \\nI got the Steak and Frites (USDA Prime New York Strip Steak, Chimichurri Butter, Smoked Paprika Yuca Fries, Saffron-Lime Aioli). She got the Le Cellier Filet Mignon (AAA Canadian Tenderloin, Mushroom Risotto, Asparagus-Tomato Relish, Truffle-Butter Sauce). \\n\\nMy steak was cooked perfectly medium rare, but the flavor play that they did with the chimicurri was just a little out of place with a thick, succulent steak like the strip they used. I think a smaller skirt steak would have been a more appropriate cut to use for this dish. But, the yuca fries were fantastic. Don't worry if you've never had yuca, they taste delicious. Fried to perfection with no greasiness. \\n\\nMy girlfriend's dish won the night, again. Her filet was dynamite. Seasoned perfectly with salt and pepper and atop a risotto that was so rich with mushroom flavor that I wanted to ask for my own bowl of it. All this with just enough truffle butter sauce to not get in trouble on an episode of Chopped. Her dish was also, definitely, a 5 star dish. \\n\\nAnd for dessert we got the Warm Pecan-Brown Butter Tart (Maple Ice Cream, Brown Sugar Anglaise, Whisky Caramel). This was a quaint little tart. The little crust was packed to the brim with these fantastic pecans. The brown sugar theme made it the perfect level of sweet, too. Not too sweet, but still decadent enough to finish off the night right. \\n\\nOverall, there were some high highs, the app and the filet, but there were some low lows, too, the services and the strip flavor play. I left mildly confused, but I definitely tasted some things where I feel confident claiming four stars here and I will be back at some point, because I love steak.

They had about 10 pies to choose from, which you would think would make things easy to find something appealing. I was shocked to find out that you couldn't \\"make your own pie\\" kind of thing, and so many of the toppings on the pizzas they advertised were out of this world. Hubby ended up getting just a simple spicy pepperoni. I got the lemon ricotta. Hubby's pizza was dry, barely cheesy, and the pepperonis practically covered the whole pizza, all he could taste was the pizza and the dough. Mine, was tolerable, I am a big fan of anything lemon so I was excited to try the pairing of ricotta. However, mine was also dry, and the only good thing were the clumps of ricotta I had to spread around to make it seem like there was cheese on this pizza. \\n\\nI decided to give dessert a try, so I got the affogato gelato ice cream.

After going and sitting at a table, and after ordering, the server came back to tell me they didn't have any gelato. He asked if I wanted anything else, and I couldn't help but huff and puff and say no. I then asked for the cannoli that my sister had order to just make to go. Instead of taking care of the customer, and offering a complimentary cannoli due to their lack of good customer service, but no, all they did was say sorry and gave me my check.

I meant to write it a couple of weeks ago, but because of my experience with a particular supervisor there I wanted to make sure I still wrote it. \\nMy family and I went for vacation. We spoke about going here for a while. We came only for the shakes. I had ordered the cookie jar shake. It was good but come to find there was quite a bit of cinnamon in and on top of the shake due the oatmeal cookie being blended in and crumbled on top. I'm allergic to cinnamon. \\nIt's nobody's fault. I had no idea it was in there when I ordered. It doesn't go into that much detail on the menu. Normally I wouldn't say anything but these shakes are so expensive and I really wanted to enjoy one. I went back to the cashier to ask if it was possible to switch to another. I explained my situation. The cashier tried to tell me there was no cinnamon in there. My tongue and throat felt otherwise. Plus both myself and my husband could smell it all over the shake. The cashier seemed rather annoyed which is why I gave this review 4 stars, but she surprisingly still grabbed a supervisor. \\nI normally wouldn't speak to the manager either but at this point, the cashiers reaction had frustrated me. Thankfully the manager was wonderful. He said it was absolutely no problem. He asked if he needed to call anyone for my allergic reaction (I was fine with Benedryl). He let me pick a new shake. He personally made the shake and brought it out to me. He was so sweet and understanding the whole time. That is why I felt the need to write a review. I honestly wished I got his name.\\nHe's the reason I will come back next year(I'm from California)."},{"name":"Blue Dragon","address":"324 A St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Me: \\"What should we get for lunch today?\\"\\n\\nWork peep: \\"Blue Dragon?\\"\\n\\nEveryone within ear shot: \\"YAYAYAYAYAYYYYYYYYY!!!!\\"\\n\\nWhy?

Throw some hot sauce on those fries and everything is right in the world, we've solved global warming and your body image issues are straight out the window, blowing on the cool breeze. \\n\\nThe only wish I have for the Blue Dragon is that they change up the lunch specials from time to time.

I should have asked the waiter about it, but I forgot.  I'll ask next time.  Pad Thai was flavorful and the noodles were able to separate easily (not all stuck together in lumps).  Yellow curry was tasty and the curry sauce had enough thickness and consistency to stick to the food.  I don't like the sauces at some other places that are thin and watery.  Actually, I wouldn't have minded if Thai Curry's sauce was even a bit thicker yet, but it was OK.  Everything about the food was fine.

It did not have the right balance for us, and at the price range, definitely not worth it in our honest opinion.

I called in advance to check on their availability (they don't take reservations so just precaution). When we parked there, there was a shuttle available so that's a nice plus. They was no wait and we actually got seated within 5 minutes. Now the breakdown:\\n\\nLocation: The view is amazing. I've been to Austin before for hiking/boating/etc and this was actually one of the best views of Lake Travis/Austin. 5/5\\n\\nFacility: A lot of outdoor seating with umbrellas included for those who hate the sun beaming down. Fans also are there with light water blowing so that was nice as well. A real downside is the downstairs restrooms. The men's restroom was poorly maintained and trash was filled with a ton of paper. Overall, 4/5.  \\n\\nFood/Drinks: Reading previous reviews, I would have to say I cannot argue: The food here is ok. I ordered the Shiner Bock Pork Fajitas and I will say it's nothing special. Pork did not seem as moist and almost seemed a little bland. Chips and queso were average at best. I also asked for what is available on local draft beers and they only mentioned 1 IPA. That is not a very broad selection. On top of all this, the food here is way overpriced ($16-$17 for fajitas???). I get the experience value but On the Border and other Tex/Mex places are cheaper and offer better food. Overall, 2/5.\\n\\nService: Our waiter was nice in the beginning but I don't feel he was really engaged. He forgot to give us water at times and took almost 10 minutes to get a to-go box. He seemed to be going through the motions. Side note: Even the staff photographer didn't seem that thrilled to ask to take a picture. Maybe they're more on top of their game when it's more crowded. 3/5\\n\\nRandom: The gift shop stays open as long as the restaurant is open. Don't pay attention to the website hours, stop by there anyway to make sure.\\n\\nSo this was my longest review ever. If you're looking for a place with a great view, this is a good place. I do wish the overall experience (Food, facility, service) was similar to the website (website was presented well). Overall, 3/5 (It may not average out correctly but oh well).

It was a little fishy, and needed lots of salt. The dressed arugula on the plate was delicious, though. Very fresh and bright. The ricotta toast was very pretty, but the flavor was a little flat. The ricotta had tons of cinnamon in it, making the cheese itself hard to taste. The granola and fruit on top were really nice, but the brioche bread had dried out. The whole thing pretty much tasted like cinnamon. I was hoping for a ricotta toast like at Lodge Bread Company in LA (which is magical), but it didn't measure up.\\n\\nThe cheddar-chocolate cookie was really good, though.

A solid... \\"eh, it's okay.\\"\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is very cute (designed like some kind of 19th-century factory that evokes fond memories of Willy Wonka) and there's a lot of attention to detail. For example, the huge menu begins with the long and winding tale of Lady Toothsome herself (and a \\"cast member\\" in full costume makes the rounds, greeting tables all night). There are pictures of all the desserts at the end of the menu, and it had me thinking about the perfect way to end my meal before it had even begun - of course, I was too full to actually get one of the enormous $12 milkshakes, but I saw enough of them served to say they're beautiful and it everyone seemed happy with what they tasted.\\n\\nWe were a large party (10, I think) and only had one server taking care of us.

You'll definitely notice the cocoa, but it isn't overpowering. It still tastes more like a savory bread than a dessert or muffin, which was a nice surprise. I probably wouldn't have ordered it, but I'll try (almost) anything if it's free and right in front of me. \\n\\nI really should have taken my friend's recommendation and gone with a brunch item. In the end, I went with the \\"May Contain Bacon\\" burger. It's served with a side of fries. Neither the burger nor the fries was objectionable, but neither was memorable, either. I had the same impression of the risotto, which my risotto-loving friend ordered and pronounced \\"bland\\" before leaving more than half of the relatively small serving on her plate. \\n\\nI probably wouldn't recommend Toothsome's for dinner, but I *would* really love to go back sometime and skip right to dessert.

I had ordered the chicken tender salad, but requested grilled chicken instead.  The grilled chicken came out raw - still very much translucent.  OBVIOUSLY this puts a huge damper on me wanting to eat anything, but Samantha was quick to recognize something was off and had the kitchen remake my salad.  It only took about 2 minutes, but here's what I noticed in that 2 minutes.\\n\\nNot once did the manager stop to see how we were doing, or why I was missing food.  Our server was busy, and therefore was unable to bring me my salad.  She did quickly stop by and realized I didn't have any salad dressing, so she fixed that.  Again, after getting uncooked chicken the first time, it throws you off wanting to eat it the second time.  Even though she did everything she was supposed to do, we were not greeted or acknowledged by the floor manager.\\n\\nI am not someone who expects to get food for free - but being able to have a manager aware of the situation so they could speak to the kitchen staff would have been better.\\n\\nWill we be back?

The cafe is basically split into two spots one with a sitting area and the other for ordering.  In Portland stylce, Pip's is appropriately simple in its aesthetic with little vintage touches spread across.\\n\\nBecause they only have typically five varieties of doughnuts (five standard + one rotating) which are much smaller than the typical doughnut, it is rather easy to try all the flavors without feeling as guilty.  I also appreciated that these doughnuts come out piping fresh hot that -when eaten fresh - give a wonderful bite that also then nicely melts in your mouth.  However, in terms of flavors, Pip's is solid that plays on favorites (various combinations with Nutella and cinnamon) but won't necessarily blow your mind.  My favorites were the one that stepped outside a little: the Candied Bacon (nice mix of sweet and savory with small doughnut as the vessel) and their seasonal Chili Mango (a tropical jam with a hint of spice).   \\n\\nIn terms of their drinks menu, they have your typical cafe menu including your coffees, but obviously with \\"chai\\" in the name you are going to come for it!  And the best way to try all of them is the Chai Flight!  Most offer an interesting mix of flavors that go out of the typical realm of your standard chai.  While all of them were really great, my favorite was the King and I (more like a Thai Tea with a more mellow sweetness) and Emmylou (more floral and calming).\\n\\nParking on the street can be busy, but was not impossible to find on Monday afternoon.  The service was pretty quick considering the line.\\n\\nOverall, Pip's is a nice way to indulge your doughnut craving without feeling too guilty, but what will probably keep you coming back is a chai!"},{"name":"The Brewtorium Brewery & Kitchen","address":"6015 Dillard Cir, Ste A","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We were at Brewtorium on Sunday night for a big birthday gathering for a friend and had a much better experience than last time around.

It's not even necessary to order anything just to come look around, so perhaps either just doing that or maybe just ordering a drink might be a better idea than coming for a meal - at least until they improve both their service and quality of food (for its price)."},{"name":"The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium And Savory Feast Kitchen","address":"Universal CityWalk Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This was the first time I ever tried. The chocolate beer wing's were awesome. I had the knife and fork steak sandwich and that to was good ( would be better with a different style bread ). To end the meal I went with the chocolate bread pudding. Waited over 15 minutes for it and was good but not worth the wait. Many dessert's to choose all look good. Overall great place. Would have gave five stars but the wait time of service did take long. I was alone and I was there for over an hour start to finish. Other tables as well had a long wait as I sat and looked around. The downstairs service seems to be more tentative then upstairs.

Answer: not if you're seeking delicious authentic food at fair prices.\\n\\nTried out the Two Brothers experience during the Cbus FoodTruckFest'15, ordered tres tacos - pollo, asada y chorizo - plus a couple of tamales. The tacos had solid flavor, but fell apart at first touch. Why were these tacos not double wrapped?! If using cheap, thin corn tortillas with the method in which you provision your meat, dude ya need to double wrap it!! For the tamales, uggh extremely disappointed, is it because I'm used to an outrageously stellar tamale cart on every street corner down in H-town TX? (the original street food) maybe.. but man, the masa was like greasy liquified gunk; and I guess there was supposed to be shredded chicken in there too, not sure as I was so distracted by the masa sludge I was attempting to scoop up.

We picked this place since they also had bun bo hue on the menu. They seated us quickly, though the way you order is interesting. They leave the order form and menu on your table, and just pick it up after you write your order in.\\n\\nAppetizer: The dumplings were great! A little oily, but packed with flavor. HIGHLY recommend.\\n\\nEntrees:\\n- Bun Bo Hue: I'm pretty sensitive to spice, and it had some kick to it, but not overpowering. Meats were tasty, though there weren't many noodles and a lot of them were broken up into tinier pieces.\\n- Combination Pho: Great flavor in the broth! Meats were tasty (especially the rare steak), and a solid amount of noodles.\\n\\nServers were attentive, and although I wasn't too impressed with the bun bo hue, the pho was pretty satisfying. I do have to give it 3 stars, though, because our food came out and wasn't very hot. On a rainy night like tonight, I was looking forward to some hot soup. By the time we were halfway through our meal, the soups were lukewarm, so I'm guessing they had been sitting out for a bit before being brought out to us.\\n\\nSolid spot, and I'm hoping that if I try it again, the food will come out a bit more fresh."},{"name":"Feisty Lamb","address":"2174 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I love love love supporting restaurants like this. This was easily one of the best dinners I've had all year, which is especially impressive because Micah runs a one-woman shop: she's the waitress, chef, bartender, and owner. She's also incredibly charming, as is just about everything about this restaurant, starting with her 5th-grade daughter that performed admirably as the hostess. The decor is equally charming, with a colorful hodge-podge of vintage seating and tables, umbrellas and chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, a playful outdoor patio space, and a custom piece of wall art made out of neckties that look like they're frozen in motion amidst a hurricane. We also enjoyed the portrait photography featuring some of our favorite British celebrities on the walls. The Simon Pegg portrait is especially eye-catching.\\n\\nBut we didn't come here for charm and decor, we came for food, and we were definitely not let down. The menu is global and contemporary, featuring lamb in many of the dishes. You can choose from several small plates, and there's also a 3-course chef's tasting menu available. We ordered the crispy jasmine rice cake with veg for our daughter, wifey got the Bobotie (South-African lamb meatloaf), and I went for the tasting menu that included hummus two ways, with delicious little house-made pita breads, followed by char-siu lamb belly on pancakes, and an apple bread pudding with sharp cheddar cheese and a caramel sauce for dessert. All of the food was phenomenal, and every plate a true work of art, pleasing both the eyes and the palate.\\n\\nWe started with artisanal cocktails: figgy gin fizzys with fresh mint and grapefruit. They were gorgeous and flavorful, but my only regret of the whole night is that I didn't say anything about them being way too sweet for our taste. I'm sure had I mentioned it she would have re-made them.\\n\\nDuring our visit, the young hostess helped entertain our almost 4-year-old daughter in between courses, she was incredibly sweet and mature and even joined us in our crayon-coloring, and happily shared with us some of the drawings in her sketchbook.  \\n\\nThe food is avant-garde and does require an open mind if you're not accustomed to adventurous eating. We were sadly one of only two tables on a Thursday night, with a 3rd table walking out before ordering. I overheard the woman at the other table saying to her dining partner that she loved the idea of the lamb belly but couldn't order it because she doesn't eat tripe. That's not what lamb belly is, and it's her loss, as it's *delicious*. I sincerely hope that Portland has demand for this kind of food, and I wish nothing but huge success for this feisty modern little restaurant and it's feisty proprietress. Come with an open mind, as well as patience, as it's no easy feat for one woman (even an amazing one) to run an entire restaurant."},{"name":"Moshi Sushi Bar","address":"2152 E Main St","city":"Bexley","stars":"3.5","text":"I cannot brag enough.

The dish also did not come with nearly enough bread for the hummus, so I asked for carrots or something. They didn't have any, but offered me a cucumber (for a price). So I ordered that. And I'm pretty sure that's where the food poisoning came in. I don't know if they didn't clean the knife or the cutting board, but they were clearly in a hurry.

Brunch. 30-minute wait. Sleek modern interior. Window seat.\\n\\nAfter pouring over the menu for an eternity I settled on Toad In A Hole.\\n\\nThe presentation was not only lovely, but serves a genuine purpose. By cutting a hole out of the bread, the egg is optimized for distribution. Furthermore, if the egg is atop the bread, the yolk will just seep into the bread, potentially making it soggy.  The outside of the banana bread was lightly butter toasted, lending a toasty outer texture. The egg itself was not overcooked, the yolk creamy and partially coagulated, not runny not too thick.  \\n\\nThe miso in the bread is barely detectable, but adds a nice subtle complexity and a savory to balance out the banana. \\nThe Habanero Sausage was juicy, succulent even. Perfectly balanced sweet, savory and hot. Even though I'm a pepperhead I appreciate that the Habanero was not overpowering. A slight hint of heat and flavor accompanied by the sweet and savory. A must if you come here for brunch. \\n\\nThe creamed spinach while not as inventive as the other components was good. It served as a needed green, but was enjoyable. \\n\\nEach item on the plate is enjoyable by itself and mixing the different textures and flavors is delightful. \\n\\n\\nI can't speak for all the other dishes, but this one hit the spot and seemed to be carefully crafted.

The mushrooms had a nice blue cheese sauce, but with 3 or 4 mushrooms, all I wanted was more mushrooms.\\n\\nToscana pizza: Delicious combination of house-made sausage, spinach, and a mild blue cheese.  The combination was perfect, but the dough near the middle was extremely soggy.  The rest of the dough was tender and had the perfect crispness.  Great pizza.\\n\\nLasagna: Definitely the disappointment of the night.  The house-made spinach dough was too thick and not tender.  The tomato sauce was boring, and the house-made mozzarella was somewhat stiff.  There wasn't much of the house-made sausage.  A disappointing lasagna, in my opinion.\\n\\nOverall, a great dining experience that was sadly brought down by a few mishaps on minor food details.

I'd have to say in both cases, the vegetables were AMAZING. they have this garlicky glaze to them that is so tasty, I could just drop the side dishes and have straight up vegetables with a starch lol. The fried chicken was very crispy and tasty and the squid had a semi-sweet glaze to it. Would pass on the pork chop and the mushrooms if I had the chance to again as they weren't the best.

The warm, nutty, creaminess of the drink makes it the perfect winter beverage, and their boba is delightfully chewy. I tend to like my drinks less sweet than most, and they gladly accommodate these requests. For those who need a non-dairy alternative, they use oat milk, which I hadn't heard of before but now have come to prefer because it doesn't give the drink an undertone of soy or almonds of coconut as other non-dairy milks can do.\\n\\nThe places is very open: one wall is a giant window, and having the natural light is delightful!

The only thing keeping this place from the full 5 stars is that the prices are not listed on the menu, and for a place that's pricier than most boba around (more than $6 / drink), it'd be nice to know that from the start rather than after the drink has already been made."},{"name":"The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium And Savory Feast Kitchen","address":"Universal CityWalk Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Spent my first date with my amazing girlfriend here and do not regret it in the slightest.

First time we visited there was a 1 hr wait, so we left. We were in the area and my wife remembered I wanted to visit, so we drove up and the place was empty. Great! We were seated and the server asked us if it was our first time. She went over a few details and for appetizer we ordered the home-made ricotta. When it arrived, it was served with pieces of bread that were completely burned, I mean charcoal quality. We asked the server if they could change the bread and her reply was, in a very condescending tone, \\"our oven is at 700 degrees, everything comes out like that. I can change it, but it is going to be the same\\". I my only answer was \\"everything that comes out of the oven is like that?\\" Dumbfounded by her reply, we almost got up and left, but we had ordered two pizzas, so we waited for them. A few minutes later we were served a basked with reasonably toasted bread and enjoyed an average Ricotta plate. Pizza arrived, with bland undercooked crust. The server told us \\"I told the kitchen to not cook the pizza much to make sure it was to your taste\\". We love thin, crispy pizza. Pizzas undercooked, small and really nothing to write home about. At $17 a pop, a very poor value. \\nMaybe this place was great once, but now it's overrated, poor service and average food.

We called him back and told him we were a bit disappointed by that. Then he said some of it is homemade some of it is packaged. But I think he was just trying to cover himself.

The calamari was pretty good. The carpaccio was nothing like I expected but was also pretty good. For the bad: the pho was the worst I've ever had. It honestly tasted like nothing - like hot water. I tried adding jalape√±o, lime, Sriracha, hoisin but as there was no base flavor, it didn't do much. There was barely any meat to be found in my pho either.

Then she says it's ok to order; I ask for two #5 meals with hushpuppies, an order of oysters, and a large Mountain Dew.\\n\\nIn a way that lacked professionalism and customer service, she told me to pull forward for my total.\\n\\nI get the the window, and am greeted by a gentleman, whom proceeds to ask if I had ordered a Pepsi. I let him know it was supposed to be a Mountain Dew (Observing that he is just now punching in my order, I was skeptical as to whether or not my order would be accurate considering a lady took my order from the speaker.)\\n\\nAs he reaches to hand me my *obviously* medium Mountain Dew, I informed I him that it was supposed to be a large, to which he apologized, and abruptly corrected my drink.\\n\\nHe then hands me one meal box with the \\"This is the end of your order\\" look.\\nI let him know that I was supposed to get two #5 meals, not just one. As he was coordinating with someone in the kitchen to fulfill my order, I check my receipt. Of course, the oysters were not on the ticket.\\n\\nI grabbed his attention through the window to let him know of the error, to which he asked for my receipt, because his \\"manager did not believe him\\" that there was two #5s. To top off this situation, he and someone from the kitchen (his manager?) were blatantly arguing about my order, loud enough to probably be heard from the opposite end of the diner. Eventually, after at least 5 minutes of sitting at the window (I know, not a long time, but cars were starting to line up behind me), we had our complete order. \\n\\nWhat? You didn't think all of that was just for me did you???!?\\n\\nTLDR:\\n1. Customer Service is OBVIOUSLY not trained, that or the people are so new (high turnover?)   that they have not even gone through that part of training yet.\\n\\n2. The order was almost COMPLETELY wrong and incomplete. This could have been avoided in part if the lady taking my order was real-time entering it into the POS terminal.\\n\\n3. Why was a manager arguing with her subordinate in front of all to see? This not only makes you look foolish, but also negatively affects team morale.\\n\\nSources:\\nI work a customer service role in a major retail furniture store, and also worked customer service in a call center.\\n\\nMy beef is not with the gentleman at the window - He was doing what he could with what he had, my beef is with his manager, and the lack of her professionalism.

Hidden away on the second floor in the heart of Gastown, you are whisked away into an oasis upon entering. \\n\\nI've been here twice in the last month. Once, for late night drinks in the back room, it's like being in a secret bar. \\n\\nMore recently, I've discovered that Kris Barnholden (latest post at Bows & Arrows), is now at the Diamond. Of course, I had to come see what was in store! He is a true talent as the kitchen doesn't have ventilation, so there is no grill here. He uses sous vide, two induction burners and a combi-oven to create some magical dishes. \\n\\nWe shared a couple of dishes, starting with a salt cod brandade. It's a delicious creamy emulsion of salt cod and olive oil, served with fresh crispy potato chips. \\n\\nNext, we had the flatbread with white anchovy and tomato. I loved the crust of this flatbread- crispy and thin, yet it also has the flakiness of a biscuit. The tomato was delicious. I think he may sous-vide the tomato, and it was kept to an interesting texture. The flavour of the fresh tomato really stood out. \\n\\nFor a heavier dish, we opted for the smoked lamb ragu, with porcini mushrooms, polenta, gremolata. \\n\\nRoasted beets, black garlic, mistuke mushrooms, puffed wild rice. This was one of the most unique dishes. A black garlic vinegarette covers the cold beets and mushrooms. I love the use of the puffed wild rice, not only does it add texture but it works with the mushrooms and beets to add an earthy flavour. \\n\\nI've also tried the dessert, which had some intriguing ingredients: Chamomile cream, honey almond cake, and Chartreuse apples. This was definitely interesting, the chamomile cream with the honey almond cake goes well together.

There was a lot of fried seafood: shrimp, stuffed shrimp, fish, chicken, calamari, and a couple others. There was also some meat choices but I wasn't there for that. The raw bar was good. It had oysters, crawfish, sushi, mussels, and more.

We understand that the hotel will be undergoing a renovations, but the problem with this hotel versus the rest of the Millennium franchise is that the management seems to really not care anymore and is reflected throughout many of the staff. \\n\\nUpon arrivals we were greeted with a upgraded room which we were entitled too based on a pre-payed upgrade option. Things were looking up. When we got to the elevator the request button light was out and upon entering the elevator so was the button for our floor. Still not concerned as these things happen. \\n\\nUpon entering the room I was surprised at the outdated furniture, the small old and hard pillows and limited view of the mountains from the balcony through the trees. Upon checking out the room it seems the security bar was broken, as well as the door handle to the balcony. When using the bathroom, we learned the door was stuck open and a vent from the ceiling was lying in the bathtub with dirt around it. We called the front desk and asked for another room but they said this or a downgrade was the only option and she said we wouldn't like the downgrade. I presume it was to one of the rooms across from the air conditioning stacks on the roof with no view. \\n\\nWe had maintenance come up and fix the various problems. He was friendly but he nor the front desk were apologetic. There was no room service information in the room, and needed to request local delivery service options which I needed to pick up. Later, when looking to take a shower did we realize the handle to the shower also came off. At this point there really was no surprise. \\n\\nWe decided to go to sleep placing towels over the pillows as they were small hard and needed to be replaced. We slept in and left the room around 11:00 with a request for new pillows and a blanket. When we came back around 5:30 pm we noticed the room was not cleaned, towels weren't refreshed nor was our request for-filled. We called the front desk and a fellow showed up with new pillows and change of bed sheets instead of a blanket. Room service never showed up. \\n\\nWe mentioned all these issues to the management and the only thing they offered was an excuse that they were planning on renovating. There wasn't any consideration of refunding the payment for the upgrade. I have stayed in the Millennium in NYC many a time as well as two times in Dubai and had a set of expectations. The Hotel in Boulder was so out of the brand and didn't understand why it was under there name.

We had never gotten to eat at the smaller location -- I believe they just served breakfast and lunch and we never wanted to deal with the long lines. I just happened to find out they serve dinner now by typing \\"diners on the South Shore that serve dinner\\" or something similar to that into Google. We assumed the restaurant was still in the same location, so went there first, and then found out it had moved to a very bigger, new space. Beautiful floors, beautiful bathrooms, large space. The space decor itself still needs something to pull it all together. It feels a bit empty still, but still a very lovely space. Anyhow, the way that we were treated and greeted the entire time we were there was outstanding -- from the people at the hostess desk, to our waitress when we ate in the dining room, to the people who served us in the bar after we ate dinner. Everyone was so welcoming and friendly, and seemed so happy to be working there. We had an absolute blast listening to and singing along to the live music after dinner, and we met some nice people while sitting at the bar. Everyone in the bar seemed to be having such a great time. The food was quite good -- I had the haddock and my husband had an omelette. I liked how you could get three sides with your entree and they offered a lot of healthy vegetables that weren't overcooked, like some places. So, my thoughts regarding all the previous couple of months' negative comments (they opened in the new space in early November 2018), is that they were still getting all the bugs out and have succeeded in getting them out now, as they settled in, staff got trained/situated. I've already told some others about this great new fun place to hang out on the South Shore and my husband and I will definitely be back. I loved the energy of the place.

Volume dining, stand in line, know my order, act like I've been here before and know what do do.  Except if I don't because I'm maybe an old or dimwitted person--or just don't plain follow traffic patterns well.  Any or all of those fit me.  I was ready to order the Northstar Burger until my sister pointed out that it was MEATLESS.  Not only is it meatless, its anti-meat--black beans, brown rice, and beets.  That seems like a bad day in the chemistry lab to me.  With her gentle guidance, I found the Classic Cheeseburger.  I like that word Classic.  It infers antiquity and Doric columns and all of that staid, boringness of eating a burger my grandparents fought wars over.  Yep, that's the one I wanted.\\n\\nThe children found tables for our group on the second level.  I like climbing stairs like I like migraines and getting stung by jellyfish--but once I got there and got over not having a soda station up top, which I found to be somewhat unfair, I enjoyed being out of the way and being able to look down onto socially conscious people gnoshing on their blackbean burgers and kale pancakes or whatever the special was.  Rarely, do I get a chance to do THAT. \\n\\nMy burger came and put an end to all of that snarky What Am I Doing Here stuff.  Perfectly cooked.  Covered in sharp cheddar.  The onions were a tad sharper than I'm used to, so I leveled them right off the bun.  The other small revelation was the spunky breakfast potatoes.  Tasty, spicy and a welcome offset to my perfect, classic cheeseburger.  I think there might be something to their emphasis on organic meats.  The meat is sourced from the Niman Ranch and when you scoot over and take a look at that, you will find hogs in little hog hotels, munching on pad thai and swilling La Croix before being led to the Big Burger In The Sky building.  Works for me.  \\n\\nChristmas shopping in the snow, eating lunch at the Northstar Cafe--say--I might could call this place the Star of Bethlehem Cafe, right?"},{"name":"Carrie's Winter Park Cafe","address":"240 N Pennsylvania Ave, Ste 101","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"This is my second time here and I absolutely love it.

Most of us didn't even eat lobster, and those who did, said it was mediocre at best, and only two of us went for a second trip to the buffet. I heard that there were other, cheaper options (one trip, one trip no lobster, etc.) but if that's true, we were not informed of that upon entering the restaurant. If that's the case, though, we're here a rather sizable refund! My favorite part of the buffet was the clam chowder; it was fabulous. The fried foods (shrimp, clam strips, fish, etc) were no better than any other restaurant I've had them at, at a fraction of the cost. It was loud and chaotic, and having people in my party who were on the autism spectrum, we left sooner than we normally would at another establishment. The sangria was nothing special... My daughter and I drank about half of it, and then opted for water for the rest of the meal. The macaroni and cheese on the kids menu is literally Kraft instant.

In addition, to make up for the high cost you get to keep the mason jar as a souvenir.

Ya see, I have this thing... I won't let myself write a review until I have actually paid for an experience with my own money. \\n\\nThe first time I had hot chicken, it was on the house. The second time when I bought tickets, I had to give mine to a friend because I was working at Earth Day. Then yesterday, all the stars aligned: I paid for the chicken AND was able to eat it.\\n\\nOkay, so here's how Hot Chicken Takeover works:\\n\\n1. You show up on Saturday or Sunday between noon and 5ish to get your hot chicken on. It's a popup dinner at the Near East Coop, and there's plenty of parking in a nearby lot. Protip: Follow them on social to get updates on how much chicken is left!\\n\\n2. Head over to where you see the tents and locate the ordering window.\\n\\n3. Make a few decisions on what you want:\\n--Meat: boneless breast, white meat, or dark meat\\n--Hotness: cold (not spicy), hot, or holy (as in holy shit that's hot)\\nI prefer the white meat on the bone, hot.\\n\\n4. Pay with cash or plastic, take your receipt, and grab a seat underneath the tent.\\n\\n5. Fix yourself some sweet tea! I mean this as a compliment: It's *not* Southern sweet. It's delicious and just sweet enough. Also, grab some napkins and plenty of ranch dressing to dunk the hot chicken. Trust me on this one.\\n\\n6. Wait about 15 minutes for your hot chicken to be freshly cooked! Make some new friends while you wait.\\n\\n7. Get your hot chicken and get to eatin'!\\n\\nThis is some seriously good fried chicken, y'all. It's moist, juicy, and flavorful. I can't eat the mac and cheese (I get all types of cray sick if I have too much wheat; also, my chicken gets de-skinned for the same reason), but I hear raves about it from all over town. The coleslaw is vinegary and peppery, just the way I like it.\\n\\nBut here's the deal: I would come support Joe even if his chicken were terrible. He is one of the kindest human beings I've ever met. And then you meet his wonderful wife, Lisa... and then you see pictures of their adorable baby... it's almost too much to handle. They are big community partners who love Columbus and love supporting all people.\\n\\nLucky for us all, the chicken isn't terrible. In fact, I think it's the best in town (close with Mya's, for sure). So get out there and show some love to my new friend, Joe, who I don't really hate at all. In case you couldn't read between the lines, I have nothing but love for him.\\n\\nI think Hot Chicken Takeover is hands-down the coolest thing happening in Columbus."},{"name":"Muzzarella Pizza & Italian Kitchen","address":"7780 Lake Underhill Rd, Ste 108","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"If you love garlic... and I mean Love... not that crappy \\"I like garlic on my food\\" feeling but the \\"I eat whole cloves for breakfast\\" type of love then this is the place for you.\\n\\nStopped by here for a quick lunch.. yeah I was thinking \\"let me hit up Subway next door\\" then this place caught my eye.\\n\\nThe restaurant is small with two to four seat tables doting the place.

The base was so fresh and light while the top cream tasted as if it had just been put on. It was shocking. I also enjoyed a very affordable espresso.

We were sent a text for our table saying we were next to be seated after a 45 minute wait. Then we waited about 10 mins at the host stand for our table. While at our table we noticed it was extremely hot since there is no air conditioning in the restaurant . Our server was extremely nice, but didn't catch his name. Once we received our food my steak was well done and was ordered medium. I ate around the steak. To my surprise they brought another entire meal around 15 minutes later but by that time I wasn't interested in the replacement meal. Overall, no apology for the experience or ownership. Lastly, a few dishes were dropped around our table and some glass also shot over us.

I used to laud the food, quality and choices, but sad to say it's gone downhill alot. I would not recommend the gourmet section anymore as the portions have shrunk and the price increased, with no increase in quality or quantity. Whoever is doing the accounting and pricing should re-think the costs because the line-ups have dropped dramatically, about 30-40% from what I can see. Think about it bean counters, less customers because of higher prices is not going to get you the break - even point that you want.

Find another, quieter spot to enjoy your cannoli because you will not find a table here. Might I suggest the harbor a few blocks away, or perhaps the Commons? A much better view.\\n\\nThat being said, it's also a free-for-all inside. All of the individuals behind the counter are ready to help, just make your way to the front, there is no clear line.

High points include delicious wine, wonderful service, gorgeous & romantic atmosphere, and that pretzel bread.   However, there were too many factors that marred my experience there, a bit. \\n\\nHubby and I had a 7:30 pm ADR, which I thought was perfect as that would give us plenty of time until Illuminations.  They were running late by half an hour when we got there, so they made us wait a bit.  It wasn't too bad, as they did give us some charcuterie of bread&butter pickles, cheese and meat. However, we were wasting valuable time we could spend strolling around Epcot.  Backtracking to when we arrived at the Canada Pavillion: when I first saw the sign to Le Cellier and the adorable walkway, I was so excited. There was a little bridge to go over a pond, and lush greens everywhere. There was even a huge waterfall! Oh Canada, I'd love to visit you some day!!\\n\\nBack to the present. There were a lot of grumpy, hungry looking people sitting near us in the waiting room, as well. When we were finally called up, I was relieved. We were seated to the side of a wall, so fortunately we weren't too close to other tables, as I was told might happen at Le Cellier.  When we walked into the dining room I was impressed with how romantic and beautiful it was.  It was dimly lit, and looked like an actual wine cellar (hence the name), which is why there weren't any windows that showed the outside, but that didn't matter to me. I was so excited to eat there. \\n\\nOur server was a girl from Toronto who told us she would be our 'authentic Canadian server'.  She seemed very knowledgeable, and really memorized what she had to say. Yet she was very nervous and it was obvious. I did like her though, and even though service was a little slow at times, she was my favorite server from all the restaurants I visited during my WDW trip.  \\n\\nShe convinced us to try the ice wine sampler so we did. The wines were absolutely delicious. THe middle one was an apple-tasting wine. The first one I tried was another sweet fruity wine, and the last one had strong hints of honey.  Every wine was absolutely incredible. However, they gave us VERY LITTLE and the sampler cost about 23 altogether! I swear I saw another sampler pass by and the glasses were much more full. I wish I complained about it. Also two of the wines tasted very very similar so I'm paranoid they gave us two of the same one. They were delicious wines, but an absolutely horrible value for how much of it we got. \\n\\nThen she served us some sourdough, nut bread and PRETZEL BREAD, while telling us information about them.  The other breads were good, but I had to ask for two more loaves of pretzel bread. It is THAT good. Pretzel on the outside all brown and sprinkled with kosher salt, yet soft, fluffy and bready on the inside. That bread is the stuff that dreams are made of. It went well with the butter they provided.  \\n\\nThen we got our entrees. I knew from the reviews that I had to get the cheese soup as it pairs well with the bread so that's what I got. The soup was thick, creamy, and had a very interesting cheddar flavor, I can't remember how it tastes, but it wasn't like the regular sharp, salty American cheddar. Enjoyable, but all I can remember now is how nauseous I became after eating. I felt like I would vomit because I ate so much of that damn pretzel bread with soup. \\n\\nHubby got the filet mignon with mushroom risotto. I don't care for steak much, but I tried it. I thought it was good, like a standard filet mignon, but not something I would get. The risotto was sticky and decadent. I don't like mushroom very much but I thought that was good.\\n\\nWhen we were done, it took a very very long time for our waitress to return to give us our check, or even take our credit card to process it, so we ended up missing the beginning of Illuminations. The cost of the meal was outrageously expensive, and not a great value for what we got. Yes, I'm a tad disappointed we didn't get any special dessert for our honeymoon, but I was nauseous from all the food I had anyway, so I might not have eaten much.  I'm hesitant to come back here again, unless it's to get some poutine and pretzel bread. Overall I don't regret coming here, but I wasn't ecstatic when I left. Maybe we'll try a restaurant in Morocco, Italy or France next time."},{"name":"Pip's Original Doughnuts & Chai","address":"4759 NE Fremont St, Ste C","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"All I have to say is that I will be dreaming about these donuts and chai!!!! \\n\\nAmazing flavors and textures for both chai and donut.

Me and my friend both enjoyed the maple bacon. The savory and sweet went very well together. I would recommend trying all the flavors if you can! \\n\\nInterior/service: small and nicely decorated.

It took about 15 minutes for the preparation, and the pizza looked really good, however it turned out to still be doughy on the bottom of the crust. It's disappointing eating an uncooked pizza.

Go more than once if you can, the experience is a little different each time. \\n\\nAs far as the hotel goes, one of the things that set them apart for me, was offering text messages from the Concierge Desk. Before I even arrived I was able to text and ask questions like...is there a Trader Joe's nearby and can you see the bats from the rooms? Very helpful and convenient service! They answered me fast too! (Note: You can see the bats from some rooms, but you'll have a better experience on the bridge.)\\n\\nWhen I checked in I asked about a room with a view. It's worth a few extra bucks to face the Colorado River. (Tip: you can negotiate the fee for the upgrade to a room with a view.) You can see schools of big fish swimming around, boats, canoes, kayaks, paddle boards and turtles poking their heads out of the water. This really adds to the whole experience. \\n\\nThere were some genuinely unique art installations around the conference areas which I really appreciated. \\n\\nThe restaurant had the usual overpriced, average hotel food. Two nearby options are Forthright for breakfast, a short walk across the bridge and Bennu 24 Hour Coffee Lounge, which is a short walk or Uber ride in the other direction. Both of these places are difficult to see from the street, so keep your eyes peeled. \\n\\nThe employees that I encountered were very helpful and friendly. \\n\\nMy one complaint here is that there is a funky light near the door that you can press for Housekeeping or Do Not Disturb. The Housekeeping button is right next to the entry-way light. I accidentally pressed Do Not Disturb on the first night (while looking for the entry-way light) and couldn't figure out why I had to call and request housekeeping every day. On the second to last day of my visit, the Operator said to me: Make sure the Do Not Disturb light is off. That was the first time I realized there was such a thing! Also, I couldn't find a towel hook until the second to last day. It's embedded into the door frame by the bathroom pocket door and needs to be pulled out. While these little additions might be clever, they are just not intuitive so I didn't appreciate them much. \\n\\nAll things considered, it was a good experience.

Crawfish Shack & Oyster Bar has 292 reviews and 4 stars, some posted by my trusted Yelp buds, so I had high hopes and now mixed feelings ex post facto. \\n\\nAs for the joint itself, I envisioned something between Austin's Boat House (albeit smaller) and the uber casual (the \\"flooring\\" consists of tossed oyster shells), tiny Aw Shucks in Dallas. Well...first impression not at all as expected.\\n\\nSmallish place in a strip mall; no patio or bells and whistles per se. Enter: a bit shabby and cheesy with plastic fish hanging on the walls, torn pleather chairs and stools, and aged laminate chipping away from table. I'm cool with that. \\n\\nThen I went to visit the ladies to wash up before digging into what I knew would be a hand immersed feast. OMGosh. Sorry. Just bad. FILTHY. I could barely even wash my hands because the basin was full do to a clog. I will spare any additional details; suffice to say I thought about leaving at that point.\\n\\nWell, I didn't. I tried not to dwell, I really wanted crab, and my hubby seemed content (and a lil grumpy from hunger pains).\\n\\nThe waitperson arrived promptly, covering our table with paper (which I took as a good sign, as traditional crab boils are often dump & dive), we each ordered a beer from the limited selection.\\n\\nMenu & the take on grub: \\nThe hubster actually wanted 1 of 3 Cajun entr√©es on the menu and was a tad disappointed they are only offered weekdays (why only M-F?; we dined on a Sunday). He settled for the Fried Catfish plate instead. One large cornmeal crusted filet, bland but cooked well, served with coleslaw he didn't care for and a few burnt hushpuppies he didn't even touch. Not a huge success.\\n\\nLike I mentioned, I came for the crab. One lb Snow Crab, with half cob corn, 2 small red potatoes, and SWIMMING in...wait for it...loads of melted butter with tons of sliced onions and garlic. \\"WHAT is this hot mess all about?!\\" When it comes to crab of any variety, I'm pretty much a purest. Steam it up with a little seasoning and I'm good to go, maybe only the tiniest dip of meat in butter, but most times none at all. The crab should speak for itself. \\n\\nThere it was in all its \\"glory\\" so I went in using my hands, ignoring the \\"utensils\\" they provided me - a regular sized fork and a pair of $ store scissors. Lol. No plastic bib was provided even though I saw a huge stack of them outside of the bathroom with all of the other junk piled against the rotting walls; I guess I could've asked for one, but I consider myself a pretty good picker. \\n\\nThe crab was cooked well, sweet, a little slippery and hella greasy on the outside, but overall actually...good. Not great, not bad, good. The potatoes were yummy (the one bite I had anyway; my husband had to eat something other than one filet of fish). The corn was soggy, no snap (again, \\"donated\\" to the hubs).\\n\\nOrder of small loaf of bread was $1.25. A necessary evil if you want to sop up some of all that leftover butter, if your arteries hadn't clogged already.\\n\\nOverall: I left scratching my head with my stinky hands, crab flakes still under my nails -I was informed they were out of moist towelettes and there was NO way I was going back to that bathroom- perplexed by my quasi-disgust and yet the fact that I somehow did enjoy the oddly prepared crab. Did I mention before that I L.O.V.E. crab? Hmm...\\n\\nThe saga continues. We noticed several people eating crawfish - the place is called Crawfish Shack after all. We're suckers for mudbugs (both literally and figuratively - suck dem heads). Tgey were on the menu, we assumed they wouldn't have any - waaaaay out of season at the end of July! After our meal, we inquired and were informed they're served year-round and they're fresh, not frozen. Huh? Were told they were from Louisiana, but I'm going to make an educated guess here and state \\"imported,\\" Asia. Served in the same onion/butter slurry as the crab. The waiter was kind enough to bring us a sample, 2 tiny bugs. No, just no. Wrong on every level. Other reviewers have raved about the crawfish. In season or not, again, no!!! Foul treatment to such beautiful little creatures that should be punishable by death. Folks, if you are inexperienced with bugs, this is NOT the place to start; and for those in-the-know, this is the place to avoid! Very nice gesture on waiter's behalf though, so thanks for that.\\n\\nThe service was a-ok. Very friendly; however, entr√©es delivered to table about 5 minutes apart and had to flag down someone 4 times for my husband to ask for a 2nd beer. \\n\\nTotal with 3 beers was a mere $38. Quite the bargain. I can handle the strange yet yummy crab, but until CS&OB does some major house cleaning and repairs (I should have snapped photos; no exaggerations), I don't think I'll be returning. Kind of sad actually. Potential. Failed. On the fence about giving 3 stars, but 2 seems a bit unfair as I did mildly enjoy the Snow legs. ;)\\n\\n[127 in 2015]"},{"name":"Ray's on the River","address":"6700 Powers Ferry Rd","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"4","text":"Went for july 4 dinner.

In the daytime, it's a really swell place to walk around. My favorite time to go is at night, after leaving one of the theme parks. Downtown Disney is meant to keep you entertained after the parks are closed, so that's when it gets the most business. With dozens of eateries, shops, a movie theater, a virtual theme park and even Cirque du Soleil, Downtown's really got it all.\\n\\nMaybe I'm just sentimental after having gone here for years and years, but I think Downtown Disney is great. If you want the Disney atmosphere while also having the option to not actually spend money, it makes a good day trip.\\n\\nThere's a lot of eateries here, tons of stores, including World of Disney, the \\"world's largest character store\\". There's also non-Disney themed shops, like Basin (which is basically a faux Lush), shops with surf apparel and the like. It's hard not to miss the giant spherical globe that is the Planet Hollywood (it's worth it to see the inside of this just once) and there's also Disney Quest, an indoor interactive theme park that I've never gone to (nor do I plan to.)\\n\\nA lot of \\"showy\\" chain restaurants (famous more for their atmosphere than their food) reside at downtown Disney, including the aforementioned Planet Hollywood, Rainforest Cafe and T-Rex. Yeah, they're pricey, but it's all part of 'experience' and magic of being at Disney. Sometimes I go into Rainforest Cafe and T-Rex just to look around without actually buying a meal!\\n\\nMy favorite places to go to downtown are:\\n\\nGhirardelli - Stop here for a free piece of chocolate and some of the best hot cocoa you've ever tasted! They also have a soda fountain and plenty of ice cream.\\n\\nEarl of Sandwich - The best place to get a quick service meal Downtown. Absolutely out-of-this world hot sandwiches!\\n\\nWorld of Disney - The gigantic store that sells just about every piece of merchandise sold in all of the Disney parks. If you have a Disney Visa card, you can get a discount here, so it's a good place to buy your souvenirs.\\n\\nVirgin Megastore - This got shut down, but I just want to mention that it was one of my favorite places there. R.I.P., oh awesome store full of movies and CDs and books and trendy things. :(\\n\\nBasin - This store is a clear rip-off of LUSH, with much less impressive products, but it's still fun to browse. I usually help myself to a good hand exfoliation. Basin's sister store \\"Basin White\\", which is located in the Grand Floridian Resort, has some pretty awesome products, however.\\n\\nArt of Disney - You can order a highly customized piece of Disney art here; it's so awesome. There's a digital catalog of hundreds of Disney artwork that you can have made into lithographs, canvas prints, posters and more. Framed or un-framed. One of my dreams is to get a HUGE custom canvas artwork from this store!\\n\\nPin Traders - The largest collection of Disney pins all in one place. You can hang out with true blue pin collecting nerds here, or just take solace in the fact that any pin in all of Disney that you want can be purchased at this spot. (Good if you're looking for a really specific character.)\\n\\nVarious other Disney shops - Yeah, they all carry the same loot as World of Disney, but they're themed and oh-so-much fun to walk through. The Christmas shop is particularly exciting - and has really adorable interior decor.\\n\\nThere's really so much stuff to do here, I never have time to take in everything I want to enjoy after the parks close.

I also got the chicken wings. The wings are cooked to order here. That made me happy to wait for fresh cooked chicken..25 mins. That turned out to be a total disaster! Obviously the chicken is battered and just allowed to sit until ordered and then cooked. Chicken cannot be battered too far in advance. That process will cause the breading to fry hard as an actual rock! I had to pull most of the breeding off my chicken because it was inedible. The breading was so hard it was possible to lose a tooth or two if you try to bite into it. I couldn't even crush the huge clumps of breading with my hand! Actually it was impossible to do so.

The ragu was served over homemade noodles, which were pretty good, although we didn't enjoy the sauce as much as we were hoping. It was just a bit flavorless, which was disappointing. I enjoyed my risotto except for two very big sticking points. The first was that there was a lot of baby octopus in this dish, something I do not care for, which was not listed on the menu. The second was that everything was still in its shell. I understand the appeal of serving mussels and clams in shell (it's aesthetically pleasing, easier for the kitchen, etc), but what ends up happening is always that some shell pieces break, and then I get to find them myself whilst trying to chew my dinner. It also feels lazy (even the shrimp was still tail on), and since everything was well mixed in with the risotto, it became a scavenger hunt to avoid the octopus and bits of broken shell while simultaneously attempting to deshell everything else. I finally threw in the towel when I took a bite that felt like sand from the shell fragments.

Service is also great and the pho comes out pretty fast (5-10 min). \\n\\nI always leave here very content and full :)"},{"name":"Karma - Concord","address":"105 Thoreau St","city":"Concord","stars":"4","text":"Great atmosphere for family and friends!

When I taste UFOs (unidentified-flavored objects), I don't stick around for seconds.\\n\\nFirst, the chicken was slightly salty, and it had a non-chicken taste and a rubbery texture.  I suspect that the chicken was brined.  Why in the world would one brine BBQ?  Shivers!  Just take it straight to the fire, baby!  Also, the peppery sauce was not to my liking.  I prefer sweet.\\n\\nThe cabbage had a weird taste.  Darn!  I love cabbage and it looked so good.  I have no clue as to what potion was encasing those beautiful green leaves. Vinegar? Moose fat?

As I forked a noodle, the cheese slid off my bite like jello slides off a hot dog wiener.\\n\\nThe peach cobbler.  Surprisingly, it wasn't tooth-decay sweet, but it WAS a tad under-sweet and the crust was in thick chunks.  Normally, the crust is my favorite part, but this time, not so much.

The crunchee rolls were very good.  I really enjoyed them.  They were made with tempura shrimp on the inside and had boiled shrimp on the outside.  I asked that they substitute cream cheese for mayo.  I can not stand mayo (YUCKO).  Anyway, the cream cheese set it off properly.  I thought about getting the chef's special, which was a short rib ravioli, but somehow that just didn't ring my bell.  I was hoping they would have fish, but oh well.  \\n\\nOur server was great.  She had a great personality.  She let us know that on Tues and Thurs their sushi rolls are $5 and they have drink specials for $5 until 7:30pm (better check the time as I might have gotten the time confused).  That's good to know as I love myself a good happy hour chile.  \\n\\nI didn't like that one of the servers (not our server) dropped off my entree and kind of threw it on the table in front of my lunch companion and strode off.  He didn't care that he set if front of the wrong person.  I didn't like that.  No.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere here wants for something, but I don't know what.  It lacks warmth somehow.

I chose the latter.  My salad consisted of spinach, wild rice, cherry tomatoes, roasted eggplant, goat cheese, avocado, chicken and topped off with a basil lime dressing.  This salad was out of this world good.  I honestly didn't even feel like I was eating a salad, it was more like a giant bowl of deliciousness that didn't seem healthy, but was.\\n\\nThey have a board up on the wall near the start of the line to order where they list everything that they are offering that is organic that day, which I think is awesome!  Some of their ingredients seem to change based on what's fresh, as I noticed that they did not offer the roasted asparagus today (bummer).  If you want to create your own salad, you get to choose two bases (such as kale, spring mix, spinach, wild rice, quinoa) and then four toppings.  One thing I find amazing is that every place I go to avocado is an extra charge, but not here!  You can even use two of your toppings if you want to double up on it, too!  They have a large selection of toppings to choose from, so sometimes it can be hard to keep it at a four topping minimum, but if you want to add extra, it's only $0.75 per topping.  At the end of the line is where you can add your protein, which is extra.  Some protein options include chicken, shrimp, portobello mushrooms, roasted asparagus, and salmon.  The portions are large here, so I definitely think you get your money's worth.\\n\\nDon't forget to ask for bread or chips at the end of the line to go with your salad (which is free).  They also have a fun Stubborn Soda fountain instead of your usual Coke/Pepsi.  The flavors that Stubborn Soda offer are really good ( I recommend the mango or black cherry)!  \\n\\nI would without a doubt recommend Greenbeat to anyone, especially if you aren't a salad lover...because you can definitely find something here you'll love and will change your mind that healthy eating can be delicious!"},{"name":"The Sugar Sow","address":"1006 E Altamonte Dr, Ste 1001","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"4","text":"I was skeptical once I pulled up, since this place is a little building sectioned off of a gas station parking lot. \\nI got pulled chicken and baked beans and I dare say the taste of this BBQ is acceptably close to the taste of four rivers!! \\nIt's... delicious.

Beautifully-done meats in very special sauces, done right and in decent proportions.  The first time I was there, I had the special of the evening, which was an incredibly fresh piece of cod, cooked perfectly so that it was moist and tender, and served with a few small potato dumplings.  There were six of us at the table, and we ordered three sides:  root vegetables, which was a mixture of potatoes and carrots; collard greens; and cauliflower au gratin (sides don't come with the entrees, which usually annoys me - especially when the entrees are so pricey).  All three were excellent and all plates were cleaned.  We also ordered three desserts for the table: coconut cream pie; something called a \\"carmelita\\" which was kind of like a hearty bar cookie with some lovely sauce; and bread pudding.  Each of the three desserts got at least one vote from somebody at the table as their favorite - which says to me that all three were consistently good.  Add to the mix a bottle of wine from one of my favorite wineries, Chateauneuf du Pape (\\"on special\\" that night for $60 - so again, not cheap), and you've got yourself one helluva meal.\\n\\nThe second time I was here, I had the maple and coriander crusted pork ribs, which were also wonderful.  The highlight of that meal, however, was the appetizer we split - the achiote seared chickpeas and goat cheese.  It's been months since I had this and I am STILL thinking about how amazing it was.  I had no idea chickpeas could taste so good.\\n\\nService is good but not superb, atmosphere is nice but casual (a plus in my book), live music is available upstairs but not deafening if you sit downstairs.

I was hoping my order would be done by the time I got there because I was assuming midday wouldn't be too busy. I get there around 4:13 and didn't see my order at the pick up, so I was assuming they were in the process of making it, which was a mistake.

I don't understand why there was only one person preparing the orders for a couple of people who came in and disregarding both mobile orders that should've been made already.

There are many reasons that I love Little Donkey. It is rare that the servers, the bartenders, the hostesses, the kitchen staff, the bar backs, and everyone else are 10/10. Every time I go to Little Donkey I feel privileged to be there and to experience the exceptional dining experience. \\n\\nAt this point, I have probably had 90% of the menu at Little Donkey. I can easily break down everything I have eaten but that would be boring. I will say on the lunch and dinner menu they have these amazing BLT wraps. If you do not get that, you are missing out on something incredible. Everything I have had has been marvelous and not one thing on the menu has ever disappointed me. I am not only talking about the food, the drinks are also spectacular. I mean....a drink that is in a grapefruit that is not kitschy is a total win in my book. If you want to experience the dishes, ask the servers to chose for you. I have done that a couple of times and have always been more that satisfied with my results. \\n\\nI have always felt like the servers are the anchors in any restaurant industry. They really hold down the fort and the greater the waiters are the more successful the establishment is. I cannot come up with enough adjectives in my vocabulary to describe how amazing Lindsay is but I will try. You will never find a server who is more down to earth, attentive, charming, charismatic, friendly, and delightful. If there were more Lindsay's in the world, well the world would just be a better place. Lindsay is the true MVP and anyone would be lucky to have her. \\n\\nI cannot rave more about my many experiences dining at Little Donkey. There is a reason why the owners are James Beard winners.

The pictures of seria kolomee (noodles) on our friend's feed made us want to come by and try it. The kolomee tasted like \\"bakmi\\" if any of you are from Indonesia. Oh my god, its so good - so so good. The picture/photo will let you know whats inside  it. The fried scallions goes really well with the noodles. Only downside of it, the portion is very small. The hainanese chicken rice was good, but wont be something I order everytime I visit here. \\n\\nThe service is quick. The menu does not have pictures but you are given photos of each food they have on the menu. Which is quite exciting to go through. \\n\\nCan't wait to try the buttermilk prawns.

This last time I got the 8oz Angus cheeseburger with onion rings.  I don't think I've ever had blander onion rings in my life.  There was literally no flavor to be had. And as for the burger, it looked more like a quarter pounder than a half pound Angus burger.  Not much flavor there either.  I believe last time I got a pastrami or corned beef sandwich.  Again unimpressed and like another reviewer pointed out, not quite a NY deli kind of sandwich.  Even an out of the way neighborhood deli in NY would stuff at least 8oz of meat into a sandwich if they expected to get any return business."},{"name":"Hot Chicken Takeover","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Not sure how I was late to this party.

Genius if not a touch arrogant.  Arrogant is good if you got it. Main dish chicken is 5 star. I got medium. Nice heat, crunch, tenderness. Worth the visit.   Banana pudding 4 star.  No spoons, feels like it should be colder, if that is the right adjective, to take heat off my mouth from chicken.   Sweet tea 5 star goodness.  Bread is schwebels and rocks  with chicken. So why only 3 stars.  3 star lunch value and 2 star sides.  15.50 is a high lunch cost. Take out pudding and still over 12.  I appreciate limited sides for efficiency but it's a taste gamble for all.  I thought Mac was dry and non creamy  slaw style did not complement heat.

I live in the area and this is our go-to spot.  My wife and I come here at least once per week and their food is always spot on and the servers are always very attentive.  Huge outdoor patio for lots of good people watching, it's even covered for the bad weather.  Their chips and salsa are the best around and their margaritas are just what you need after a long day.  The wood fired grill in the back really throws out some treats including the fajitas, short rib, nachos, etc... One of the unsung heroes on the menu is the house salad, it flies under the radar but does not disappoint.

It took a while before I decided to take the plunge and try it. But when I did, I was NOT disappointed!! I love me some iced coffee, so I got an Iced Peppermint Mocha. It was just amazing! Its really close to my house, so I have been in several times since then (I also send my roommate for coffee on those mornings when getting out of bed seems just a little too hard). In fact, if I want to pay for coffee (instead of drinking the sludge at work) then I ALWAYS go there. It's right on the way!! I haven't had the occasion to try their food, but I intend to do that as soon as I can. The samiches sounds super good!\\n\\nWhat really sets this place apart from other coffee shops around town is the how warm and hospitable the employees (and even the owner) are. During my second visit, I had the pleasure of meeting the owner. He couldn't have been more friendly or accommodating! I signed up for the email newsletter after learning that they give away a $250 gift card monthly.

Every element was wonderful and loved this dish. I usually can't finish my dishes but this was just too good not to finish!\\n\\nBefore dining at the Cafe, I knew I needed their Dessert Sampler ($12) in my life. It's surely enough for at least two people with samples of four of their desserts! You get the Mocha Pot de Creme (with coffee flavored custard), Fresh Berry Tart (almond cake topped with berries & apricot glaze), Wild Strawberry Cheesecake, and the Chocolate Timbale. This was a fun dessert and definitely no regrets!\\n\\nEverything we had at Grand Floridian was delicious!

We received our drinks and guacamole rather quickly. You MUST try the tequila martini, because it is good. I ordered the tacos Al pastor and chicken fajitas. There were several staff members coming by keeping our drinks full. Despite a packed house our food came out quickly  and my god it was good. I'm still craving the tacos Al pastor now.

I still had an amazing time this night, one that I will never forget! I would still recommend this restaurant for people to try out. But there are a few reasons why this wasn't a 4 or 5 star review. \\n\\nService: Ok, first of all, I was terrified of the server. She wasn't helpful at all when we asked for recommendations or help choosing our items. She had a gruff, snappy attitude. She had a mean, condescending tone, possibly because we are college-aged. She reminded me of the red-haired cook from Orange is the New Black. But if we had a friendly, helpful server, this rating would be much higher. I'm sure if you get a different server, your experience would be better.\\n\\nAtmosphere: I loved it. We came at night, later than a typical dinner time on a weekday, so it wasn't crowded at all. The view is amazing. There is a great view of one of my favorite buildings, the one with a triangular lit-up orange top. The light fixtures are so lovely. The seats and the tables looked really elegant. Basically, the whole interior was beautiful and picture-worthy. It was so romantic. \\n\\nDrinks: We had a wine and a coconut mixed drink. Both fantastic.\\n\\nFood: A few hits, but some misses. We both did the course that is 2 appetizers + one entree. The scallop appetizer was good, but I've had much better scallops from comparable restaurants. The crab cake was amazing. It was tiny, but sooo delicious. The smoked salmon appetizer was very tiny and good, but not a standout. The foie gras is more of an acquired taste. Personally, it's a little rich for me. \\n\\nFor the entrees, we had duck breast and the beef tenderloin. Beef tenderloin was good, but nothing special. The duck breast was so dry and bland. It was hard for us to finish. We took it home but ended up tossing it. \\n\\nOverall, I would say give this place a try as it truly is a unique experience.  The service and some of the food was a miss for us, but the drinks and view were great. I see the great reviews for the food, so maybe we went on an off night.

I think the romantic, river running next to the restaurant feel did it for me. I just imagine that any restaurant overlooking a body of water is a beautiful scene for a nice dinner.......\\n\\nLuckily for me, this scene that had played out in my mind came to life one weekday before New Year's eve. Ray's was having a deal for a 3-course meal with wine and so me and one of my girlfriends who I hadn't seen in a while thought what a nice way to meet, eat, and catch up on life. \\n\\nWe arrived just before dusk, and it was beautiful looking out into the river, with the christmas lights wrapped around the tree trunks and viewing the few homes in the distance.\\n\\nI loved the entrance way, they had a nice fountain outside, and also had a \\"Ray's waterfall\\" flowing behind the hostess station. It was very nice and brought a nice atmosphere to the evening. We were seated on the upper level right near the window, so we were able to look out at the river while enjoying our meal.\\n\\nNow for the food/service. I must say the service was just \\"mediocre\\". Quite honestly, it was because the staff was unknowledgeable. So before coming I had called a few times to check about this deal, and to ask what times it was offered etc etc.....to make sure I got the details right. Well we get there, and after being seated, the waiter comes up and I mention to him that we were there for their special, and he gave me this \\"dumbfounded\\" look and told me he didn't know what I was talking about. So then me and my girlfriend kind of give each other the \\"you've got to be kidding me\\" look, because for any of you that have been to Ray's before, you know that the lowest priced thing on the menu is like $30.\\n\\nSo then he tells us he'll go check on it, and comes back with a different menu which had the options for our special on it, and he was like \\"Well look at this, guess we both are learning something new today....\\"......ummmm being a semi-fancy restaurant shouldn't you know what your freaking specials are?!?!?  So that was kind of disturbing, but once we got past that and dug into the food, we were back in heaven again.\\n\\nWe started off with appetizers, my friend got the clam chowder and I the calamari (yes I love that stuff)...lol.... We then went for the main entrees, which I ordered the chicken with mashed potatoes and she ordered the salmon, mine was scrumptious. Then the dessert.....moment of silence PLEASE for how good this stuff was. It was the richest, most decadent chocolate cake EVER!!! It came with strawberries and whip cream, oh my goodness....\\n\\nNeedless to say, Ray's lived up to my expectations besides the unknowledgeable wait staff.
