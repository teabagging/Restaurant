I just had lunch here today and I thought it was great.  To be honest, this is very close to the experience of actually having lunch at a typical middle-tier restaurant in Beijing.  The food tastes very close to the Northern chinese style, rather than Shanghai style or Cantonese style.  \\n\\nThere are three hand-pulled noodle restaurants on this block of West Broadway.  I think it speaks volumes that this particular restaurant is the busiest and most packed with people at lunch.  You got to know how to order and how to talk to the servers.  This isn't your typical \\"friendly\\" Canadian style.  You got to project authority and command the servers, bark at them almost.  Tell them exactly and precisely what you want, and expect it to be done immediately.  I know that sounds rude, but it really is how things are done in China and in Beijing especially.  And you're not supposed to tip a lot.  I know you can't help it, especially if you're really Canadian.  Its just not normal in Beijing to tip a lot.  \\n\\nI don't think you can go wrong ordering anything here.  I prefer the spicy Szechuan dishes, particularly on these cold, rainy, blustery, grey Vancouver days; but, everything else tastes pretty good.  There is some msg in the food, which is standard.  I think they try not to put too much in.  You can probably ask them to not put any if you prefer.  If you don't like the food here, the problem actually probably isn't the food, but that you're not used to the style and taste of Northern chinese cuisine."},{"name":"Colleen's Ice Cream & Sandwich Shop","address":"61 High St","city":"Medford","stars":"3","text":"I had a terrible experience at Colleen's.  After Church service, I came into Colleen's just when it opened.  It was raining and I had my little dog with me.  Since I didn't wish to sit on the outside wet bench to pick him up, I walked him inside just near the door and pulled out the nearest chair close to the door so I could pick him up.  I cannot pick him up by bending over from the waist due to a very serious back issue.  Colleen started to yell at me to pick him up.  I explained my situation, but she continued to verbally abuse me, and yelled \\"why aren't you picking him up\\".  I said that I was about to when I had to stop to respond to your attack.  In the past I always came inside with him under my arms as I would pick him up outside when it's sunny and dry.  She was very judgmental and critical.  I proceeded to the bathroom and was planning to take out the butternut squash and apple soup, but after her harsh attitude, I decided to leave.  I approached her and expressed that I did not appreciate her attitude towards me.  She continued to attack me by saying that I come in to use the bathroom, and never order anything.  Yes, occasionally, when I'm taking long walks I may stop in to use the rest room and there are NO signs saying restroom is for patrons only.  I have in fact met friends there for soup and a drink, but it's usually later in the evening, after 7 p.m.  Since I don't like ice cream or the food there that much, unless it's a veggie wrap or soup, it's not my pick.  One of the staff members who was there watching had a rude attitude by laughing through this ordeal.  A very turn off for me.

Their salad rolls are better than average (they get a nice crunch from the bean sprouts and they're maybe a little larger than most since they don't fold the rolls over themselves at each end) but could be better if they rolled them with some herbs like mint and Thai basil.

Incidentally, we booked our entire trip about a week ahead of time and still got reservations at Be our Guest (breakfast), Chef Mickeys, Akershus, Spirit of Aloha, and 1900 park fare (breakfast) all at ordinary meal times.  Now we've booked another Disney World vacation in mid-October on short notice and found reservations at Crystal Palace, O'hana (breakfast and dinner), Tusker House, Hollywood & Vine, and 1900 park fare (dinner) and Be Our Guest (lunch).  So PLEASE don't let the six month thing scare you away.  What happens is that the restaurants all sell out shortly after the 180-day mark but then people modify and cancel vacation plans due to Disney's liberal cancellation policy, or they change their itinerary for what park they want to be in on a given day due to fastpass etc, so they drop their reservation.  Also, remember there is a cancellation fee for bookings under 24-hours, so if you check the website a day or two before there are a LOT of last-minute openings at \\"impossible-to-get\\" restaurants.  \\n\\nOkay, rant over, and on to the actual restaurant review.  On approach to the restaurant, my heart fell because I promised my kids breakfast in a castle and my 4-year old promptly declared that it was not a \\"real castle like Cinderella's\\", just a small \\"toy\\" castle.  The forced perspective trick just didn't work at all for us. Also, the d√©cor in the main dining room had a high-school cafeteria vibe in the morning--my sense from the photos is that it is far more attractive at night.  But then we explored the side rooms and were relieved to find that they were BEAUTIFUL, especially the \\"West Wing\\" which looks exactly like it does in the movie.\\n\\nAs for the food, I would say it was adequate, but did not quite live up to expectations.  My husband had the best meal with the \\"Feast a la Gaston\\" which is your typical eggs/meats breakfast platter.  My sons who normally love oatmeal and French toast found theirs to be bland.  But they enjoyed the generous basket of breakfast pastries (included in the price of your meal), so nobody left hungry.  My Croque Madame was tasty with thick ham and flavorful b√©chamel sauce, although I had to pick around raw uncooked egg whites, which is a pet peeve of mine.  And this was by far the most expensive meal we at a counter service restaurant at about $100 for two adults and 3 kids, though for next time we learned our lesson and have purchased the Disney Dining Plan.\\n\\nSo why the 4 stars given the slightly underwhelming review?  First, because choices are very limited for breakfast at the Magic Kingdom, and second, because seeing my kids' jaws drop at the enchanted rose made it totally worth it.  As I mentioned before, we will be back, this time for lunch, hoping that the food quality is better for lunch than breakfast."},{"name":"Pizzicato Pizza - Beaverton","address":"10719 SW Beaverton Hillsdale Hwy","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"I adore Pizzicato!

That's pretty much it. \\n\\nOh, but the food!  Everything is handmade by Connie, who got her start catering for some famous Austin residents like Laura Bush and Ann Richards.  We ordered the beef fajita tacos and green chile enchilada.  Both of the dishes were fresh and served steaming hot.  The prices were reasonable, although not dirt cheap.  The wife liked the mango salad and I did try something new as a side dish: cactus salad.  I thought it was good, but just as our waiter warned me, expect a somewhat sour taste that takes some by surprise.  \\n\\nA couple of things about this place that I wished were different are: their portions are somewhat on the small side (was just right for the wife, not quite enough for me) and their menu was also somewhat small.

Veggie style stuffed avocado is one of their specialities. Top it with Suiza sauce. Must try! Deliciously made.\\nI am not particularly fond of fajitas and enchiladas, so I will not comment on them.\\n\\nService is sporadic.

You check in first at the gate and they will then let you know when you can walk over the bridge to your reservation.

We were seated in the main dining room which was crowded but was also most festive. Beast would walk across the dining room every hour and the whole dining room would erupt in applause. \\n\\nBecause we were there during the holidays the dining room was even more festive with holiday decor.\\n\\nThe food is French inspired and we were there for dinner. The food was average but obviously not the main draw that people go for.

All this for about 44 bucks.  \\n\\nI thought that made sense and I like all those dishes so we went with that.  Well the food was a pretty healthy serving and all of it was really good.  The wonton soup I haven't had in a really long time and it was refreshing to have.

The fresh doughnuts are a treat and my favorite is the veggie wrap from the deli - a must try.  \\nMy only complaint is with regards to purchasing wine.  I went in to buy a bottle in the fall with my driver's license from NY and was told it did not suffice and was then told in order to purchase I had to produce my passport.  I ended up having to drive home to bring back my passport in order to purchase A BOTTLE OF WINE.  For one I am not sure if this was a policy the farm independently choose to enforce but to have my NY license be immediately disregarded as a proper form of ID was not ok.  That issue aside I really do like the farm but am wary from purchasing anything with alcohol from the establishment as I don't tend to carry my passport and license with me on casual shopping trips.

I have always been a purist when it comes to Vietnamese food so of course I was skeptical when the new menu followed suit with the shiny new restaurant. On top of that, every evening I would walk past this place (in the summer) there was a lineup. I would understand if they had a big patio on Main street but the crowds got me curious. Finally, on a Tuesday evening when crowds were less, I hesitantly walked in and got seated for a table of two. The attentive service got my attention. Not to compare, but at other Vietnamese restaurants I am lucky to even be asked \\"how are you?\\". \\n\\nWhile sipping on my first cocktail and considering what to order from the menu, I learned about the story of Anh & Chi. As someone who can relate to having parents settling into a new country with a young family and finding meaning in your new city, the story of their restaurant really resonated. Sitting in the cozy space and pondering this, I could see how their inspiration helped this restaurant be reborn in the community. \\n\\nNow onto the food...\\nFirst, I had to try the Fried Chicken wings I can't stop reading about on everyone's review. We ordered the Chili fish sauce version. $13 for 4 small wings. The flavours were amazing, although the wings themselves were not very hearty. It felt like I was just eating very salty (and very expensive) chicken skin. \\nMy main dish was the Grilled Chicken Bun Thit Nuong. I thoroughly enjoyed this dish but at a price tag of $15 for a small bowl, I regretted not ordering something more original on the menu.\\n\\nAlthough they appear to be modern and fusion, a lot of their dishes actually derive straight from authentic staples in Vietnamese cuisine.

There is just so much flavor in the broth and the beef is just the right consistency. \\n\\nThe restaurant is small and a tad cramped and usually is very busy so it's best to go when it's not peak lunch or dinner time or be prepared to wait. \\n\\nTheir baos are excellent but a tad pricey. The pork belly and dirty bird are my favorites. \\n\\nHonestly can't go wrong with trying this spot. They are on the pricier side as a lot of little dishes add up quickly however you definitely want to try them all."},{"name":"Royal Indian Cuisine","address":"1410 State Rd 436","city":"Casselberry","stars":"4.5","text":"This is the best Indian restaurant we've found in Orlando!

The tandoori chicken and the chicken keema were full of flavor from the spices; the tandoori chicken had the perfect amount of masala and smokey taste and the keema was rich and tasted of delicious tomato.

There's nothing like being served flavorful, hot food.\\n\\nI've been to so many other indian places around Atlanta, most of them so much more expensive than Zyka.

I was wrong.\\n\\nCocina De Consuelo had been at the top of my must eat list (yes, I have a list) for about a year. For some reason I didn't make it in until a few weeks ago when my boyfriend and I were hungering on a Saturday morning. He wanted Trudy's, but he must be ecstatic that I steered him in the right direction.\\n\\nWhen we first walked into Cocina, I was a bit confused as to what to do. You seat yourself, you get your own coffee, you order at the front. (at least on weekend lunch) Despite the Huevos Rancheros calling out to me, I knew I had to order the Queso Fresco Enchiladas. Boyfriend ordered barbacoa and... something else, I dunno. I don't care.\\n\\nSit and get chips and salsa. I loved the salsa. It's not going to win any awards, but it's certainly better than 85% of the salsas you will get... anywhere.It doesn't play- I warn you- If you don't like spice, you will not enjoy it.\\n\\nOur dishes come out and I just gasp. My enchiladas just... look amazing. Queso fresco in fresh and delicious tortillas covered in ancho chile sauce with my delicious VEGETARIAN refried beans.. Honestly, I'm drooling thinking about it. I can't remember the last time I ate something that just looked that amazing. So I take a bite and... that's it. I cannot tell you what made it so amazing.. it just was. Boyfriend is quoted as saying, \\"I don't like enchiladas, but.. oh god..\\"\\n\\nI ALWAYS devour my Mexican food in salsa. But.. with this dish, I just couldn't. It was too amazing to sully with any other flavor. That is truly a first for me.\\n\\nMy boyfriend's meal was average, but based off of his two bites of my enchiladas, he REALLY wanted to come back next week, and come back we did- With my grandparents the next week. I decided this time to go for the potato enchiladas. Connie is famous for enchiladas, they must also be amazing, right? Eh. They're good.. but nothing compared to the queso fresco. My  grandpa ordered an extremely enticing nightly special- the salmon enchiladas. They looked AMAZING (if not... unique) and he loved them. My boyfriend got the queso enchiladas... and they were, again, godly. Why did I choose something else?\\n\\nThis place is amazing. The only warning I would give is that the service has been extremely slow both times I've visited (because there is one waitress for the entire place) and the portions did not satisfy the men (although, I thought they were perfect).\\n\\nNote:  I overheard the sole waitress say that there is no pork in the entire restaurant and that their refried beans are completely vegetarian friendly.\\n\\nMy recommendation is to come here and order the queso enchiladas, and afterward- as you apparently will most likely not be full- go next door to Upper Crust Bakery and order their chocolate cupcake (the best cupcake in the city). I'm truly upset that I've already experienced this meal so I cannot do it again for the first time.\\n\\nI'm drooling too much to continue writing."},{"name":"Peaceful Restaurant","address":"110-532 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Simple straight forward Chinese restaurant with the classic stir fired green beans, hand-cut noodle and Xiao long nap.

All were really good and all plates were bare.  Of course, we had to try the grey stuff (icing on a chocolate cupcake) and it was delicious so we didn't have to ask the dishes.  I had the double chocolate cake and it was even better.  Definitely a place to visit.  I honestly wouldn't eat there unless you're on the dining plan because it seemed pricey, but then again, all the food stops at disney seemed to have doubled or tripled in the last 4 years.\\n\\nThat same day, while waiting in a line, I was talking with a mom of twins who said they showed up for their \\"preferred seating time\\" 15 minutes in advance as they advise you to do.

Yeah. Their mixed drinks are tasty too.\\n\\nEverything that they listed on their menus sounded incredible, from the Mole Albondigas to the Beef Croquettas. In the end, we ended up ordering five different dishes, all of which were yummy, if not incredible:\\n\\nMole Albondigas - can someone send me a troth of that sauce? And the lamb? Oh, yes. If and when you go to Cuchillo, order this dish. You won't be disappointed.\\n\\nBlistered Peppers - Any time Sishito peppers are on the menu, I'm on that. Always a favorite, and they do it right here.\\n\\nHeirloom tomato salad with Pablanos - This was probably my least favorite dish. For some reason, the heirlooms just didn't have as much flavor as I'd like and the ratio of tomato to cheese was way off. \\n\\nBeef Croquettas - YES. Such yummy deep fried balls of joy, especially with that house made guacamole. Want again!\\n\\nPork Belly - Along with Sishito peppers, this is one of my must orders whenever it's on the menu. This did not disappoint. It was so tender, and not too fatty. The sauce was sweet, which was nice. \\n\\nI'd go back anytime to try more of that solid menu!"},{"name":"Brick & Fire","address":"1621 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Not only is this my favorite pizza restaurant, it is my favorite go to restaurant, especially on a Friday night.  I don't even live in the Conway area, but my daughter goes to Boone High School, so we are in the area often, which is how we found it in the first place.  When it's my birthday, anniversary, or other special occasion, and my husband says we can go anywhere I want to go, I want to go here.  I know it's not a fancy place, but it is just really good food.\\n\\nMy favorite pizza is the four mushroom pizza.  They changed it a few years ago, and it is now made with fennel instead of pesto.....honestly, I like the pesto better, but all you have to do is ask, and they will make it the old way.  The fennel is good too, but I like the pesto better.  My husband LOVES the buffalo chicken pizza, in fact, if you ever have it here, and you try to eat it anywhere else, it will never compare to the way they make it here.  They have a bacon cheeseburger pizza, it is amazing. The pizza dough that they make is the thing that makes it so good, it is better than any place I have ever eaten. They have a pizza with fig and goat cheese on it......amazing! Used to be my favorite and now it's the mushroom again, but both delicious. The baked ziti is amazing!! It is probably my favorite thing on the menu, I always say I will get something different, and usually I end up getting the baked ziti.  We once went with my brother in laws picky kid, she ordered macaroni and cheese, and this macaroni and cheese, on the kids menu....was about as gourmet as I have ever had.  Of course, this kid didn't like it because it was too fancy for her, and she loves disgusting kraft mac and cheese, but that's OK, the adults at the table helped her eat that macaroni and cheese.  The simple Italian side salad is wonderful, for $4, if you are not super hungry, it is almost enough by itself and it is delicious, made with a good mix of nice green lettuces, just delicious.   Oh, I almost forgot to tell you about the bruschetta....all I can say is WOW! It is better than bruschetta I have had in very fancy restaurants.  I think they have two versions of it, I have had both, they are incredible, unbelievably good.  The portions that they give you are crazy big too, you can order several entrees, appetizers, pizzas or whatever and share with everyone, that is what we usually do.  \\n\\nThis place is wonderful.  It is so much better than the chain restaurants all over Orlando.  It is not expensive.  It's usually crowded, but not to the point that you have to wait a long time, they have a pretty big dining area and another area off to the side, so you can usually get seated pretty quickly.  We usually have Jen, the same waitress that is usually there, she was not there the last time we went, so I hope she is still there.  She always remembers us and even knows if my husband is with me that we will be getting the extra large buffalo chicken pizza.....even if it is just the two of us and no kids, and I order something else.  He does not eat the entire thing, but he likes having the leftover pizza to eat for a few days, and he says it is still good leftover. \\n\\nI can't thing of anything negative, only maybe the parking is sometimes hard, the parking lot is not very big, but we have not ever been able to park somewhere, but it is tight.  It's on Orange Avenue across from the hospital, so traffic is busy around there, but it is so worth all of that.  It is the best pizza in town, hands down.  If you try to eat pizza somewhere else, you will be sad that you did not go to Brick and Fire instead."},{"name":"Papagayo","address":"331 Great River Rd","city":"Somerville","stars":"2.5","text":"the service was great, the menu was too simple, the food was wayy overpriced for what we were given. it seemed and tasted like food you could make urself without trying so hard.  the chips were a little too salty but they were really crunchy like kettle cooked which i actually enjoyed.

At the other Korean restaurants in Boston, these three dishes are either too bland or just don't taste right.  At Buk Kyung II, the pork bulgogi has a good blend of sweet and spicy, the soft tofu soup is adequately flavorful, and the spicy squid is cooked just right.  However, these are the only 3 dishes that this restaurant is good for.  The dok buk ki also isn't bad, but it should be sweeter and less spicy in my opinion.   I have not tried any of the noodle soups yet, but I have tried the majority of the other dishes on the menu.  The seafood pancake, dumplings, and beef bulgogi are especially NOT worth getting.

So far this is the first sushi spot in Portland that I actually like, that gets the flavors of the rice right, and taking the quality of ingredients into consideration is really a great value.\\n\\nA few insider tips: the sparkling apple cider is only $3 for the whole wine sized bottle, on Wednesday nights you can hang out at the board game shop and have awesome platters of sushi delivered to your table, adventurous eaters should really consider Omakase style dining ($15 is a good amount, note this is only possible if they aren't too busy...if they are all of the standbys mentioned at the top are great choices), lastly if you let them know in advance Wes and Phinn do a rocking job with catering or party orders.  \\n\\nWhile there's busier, more popular places to eat in Sellwood, don't overlook Zenbu. It's not just good for a cart, it's just good.\\n\\nPictures (worth a look, at least I think so):http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fHAnvgN7_ZShyls2CxG21g?select=x2OUGMqQ4JeOhjYXX4P1bA"},{"name":"Henri's","address":"2026 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Cute place.

As we are seated, a pot of green tea arrives on the table - nice and hot.\\n\\nHaving allowed several minutes to review the menu, and very helpful server  came over to take our order, guiding our selection to ensure we could experience a variety of flavours and sweetness/spicyness levels. In the end, we order a number of dishes to share amongst the four of us: \\n- Peaceful Beef Roll\\n- Dan Dan Noodles\\n- Sichuan String Beans\\n- Spicy Gingered Beef\\n- Ziao Long Bao Steamed Buns\\n\\nThe first dish arrived shortly after ordering, and dishes continued to arrive as they finished cooking.\\n\\nThe Peaceful Beef Rolls were delcious, with a sweet hoisin sauce rolled in with the beef inside the puff pastry wrap; although slightly oily due to the nature of puff pastry - they were delicious and a great start to the meal.\\n\\nThis was followed by the Ziao Long Bao steamed buns - pockets of dough filled with a wonderfully flavoured pork ball and delicious juices. Our preferred way of eating these (although not necessarily the easiest nor tidiest) was to create a small whole in the dough, and drink the juices; only once these juices were gone would we eat the dough & pork ball. Very satisfying.\\n\\nQuickly on the heals of the steamed buns, the Sichuan String Beans arrived - a mixture of green beans and thin strips/pieces of pork - flavored with garlic, soy sauce and chilis. These arrived to the table fairly hot, but cooled off pretty quickly - as beens are wont to do. Regardless, this was a nice, light dish with just the right amount of flavour to accompany our admittedly protein & carb-laden selection.\\n\\nAlong with the beans arrived the Dan Dan Noodles - and these were a great surprise as we ordered these without knowing what to expect. first off - it should be known that Peaceful makes their own noodles (which can be seen by the varying thickness). These noodles were served with spicy pork, spinach and a incredibly flavorful peanut sauce - with crunchy crushed peanuts mixed in; judging by the state of the bowl at the end of the meal, this one was a crowd favourite!\\n\\nThe final dish served was Spicy Gingered Beef - a slightly spicy, crunchy plate of beef strips, with green onions - some of the best gingered beef I've ever had in Vancouver.\\n\\nDespite ordering all of this food, we were in and out of the restaurant within an hours time - not bad, considering it was a busy Thursday evening!\\nOne should note, however, that Peaceful only accepts Cash and Debit cards - no credit cards.\\n\\nI would recommend this restaurant to anybody looking for \\\\tasty, well priced Chinese food; we will all definitely be going back before long!"},{"name":"Boma - Flavors of Africa - Temporarily Unavailable","address":"2901 Osceola Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Probably the best buffet ive been to, but at the end of the day, it still is buffet food.

We waiting something like 10-12 minutes to see a waiter about cocktails, let alone appetizers or specials.  Made us all really antsy.  When the waiter finally came, and then the subsequent drinks, they were all very good.  As cocktails at Teatro are all $12-$15 a pop, they best be tasty and potent.  These did the trick...thank goodness.\\n\\nMoving on to the food.  We ordered the tasting portion of the lobster pasta and the pesto tortelloni, the fig and prosciutto sausage and the roasted brussels.  The pasta was really very good.  Almost all of the pasta is made in-house, super tender and delicate, and gave way perfectly to the fillings and sauces.  I could have drank the lobster pasta sauce...which was composed mostly of butter.  So there's that.  The sausage was good, although I didn't get much figgy flavor.  We had a vegan at the table, so I didn't dig for the brussels, but I heard they were good as well.\\n\\nMain course... the winner of the night was the pork shank.  I saw a neighboring table with it (everyone else scopes out neighbor tables, right?) and decided it was a must.  The meat was tender, moist and flavorful.  The braising greens were a great fork mate and a bitter juxtaposition to the almost too-sweet sweet potatoes.  The chicken milanese was good...but the flavor intensity just didn't match the pork shank.  The white pizza was surprisingly spicy-- a'ok, and HUGE.  \\n\\nThe food was delicious.  The drinks were more than drinkable...nothing to write home about, though.  The service left MUCH to be desired, but the food made up for it.\\n\\nA word about the space.  It is small---but really cool.  I wasn't the biggest fan of the backlit blue walls, but for a 21st birthday celebration it was fun.  What was surprising was the acoustics.  Although the dining room was packed and the ceiling tall, it wasn't too noisy.  We did not have a problem hearing everyone in our party without raising our voices.

Cool room, charming service, great vibe, so what's not to like?  Well, I went for brunch and yes, the basket of bread is wonderful.  Fresh baked, exotic breads with these lovely flavoured butters.  That was excellent.  Ordered coffee, of course.  It arrives in a small cup and it looks like a small Americano.  Well, that's because it is.  Uh oh, what about refills?   Yeah, you can buy them.   Yikes, that's a huge deal breaker for me.  My passion at breakfast is the nurturing feeling of being offered copious top ups.  That's why I go out for breakfast, so that a server can keep stopping by and warming my mug.  Aaah...  But that isn't going to happen here because they only do Americanos.  No drip, just fancy pants coffee.  Sigh.\\n\\nSo if the coffee thing doesn't bug you, what about the food?  Menu is really interesting.  Eggs come with a kind of vegetable melange and potatoes.  Nice stuff, but the eggs are cooked terribly.  I had an omelette and the eggs tasted overcooked and kind of like hard foam.  My wife's easy over eggs were over cooked, barely runny.  My daughter had scrambled eggs and like my omelette, really overcooked and hard.  Just not how you make eggs.  This is basic stuff, so kind of surprising.\\n\\nSausage was pretty tasty, but the bacon was really overcooked.  Again, maybe some like it super extra crisp, but I found it almost burnt.  Not burnt, but pretty close.\\n\\nAs I say, service was lovely, although they only brought us one menu and after asking a few times, just never managed to bring one menu each.  We shared the one, but that seemed kind of an odd start.  Otherwise, no issues with service.\\n\\nSo I would go back to try the dinner food, but not for brunch.

The only complaint he had was the sauce for the shrimp, but this may just be personal taste. They did not have an alternative sauce, but he still enjoyed his meal. My meal on the other hand was blah! Turkey, bacon, avocado burger with a house salad. Whoever was prepping food in the kitchen was slacking! My salad was a mess, but tasted ok.

When she heard we had mostly vegetarians she asked if vegetarian/vegan, etc.  She then went over options on the menu, etc. We got a guac for the table which apparently can be customized to a level of heat, but I'm not so much on the spicy so my friends were nice, and spared me and got peppers on the side--suggestion again by the accommodating waitress. I went totally basic and had a cheese quesadilla which was very good, and my friends' seemed happy with the choices.

Add attentive service, a lovely dining room, an appealing menu and q wine list that's intriguing, and you have a special result. This makes for a virtual guarantee of a satisfying and delicious dining experience. Now, let me dispense with the single negative; Teatro's dining room can be a bit loud. I've always thought it would benefit from a bit more sound insulation. But that's all that's imperfect. And pehaps this goes along with the cool vibe. \\n\\nThe list of Teatro's positives runs long. Start at the beginning. After being seated you are offered a generous portion of the city's most delicious Italian bread. It's that type of bread that is the very opposite of the mass-produced type. The crust is deliciously hard and crisp, while the inside of the bread is lusciously soft. Appetizers and entrees are first-rate with lovely presentation, high quality ingredients and great taste. Whether it be vegetable, meat of fish or pasta that you prefer, you'll find a delectable option that you'll long remember. \\n\\nBeyond its exceptional food, the quality of Teatro's people makes for a significant advantage when compared to many other restaurants. This is a reflection of good management and GM, Sarah, leads a staff that shows its dedication to making the customer's dining experience special. Teatro was great before Sarah took the help. But now it's one-upped itself. Sarah is warm, she makes you feel at home special each time. She put together a great wine selection, including the selections by the glass. \\n\\nTeatro's servers are pros, seasoned and attentive folks who achieve the right balance between engaging with you and giving you space. Ask for Eduardo, he's terrific, but so are his peers. At the bar, Moira and Seann are  absolute standouts.

The flavor of the meal, otherwise great, was starting to be a bit overshadowed. Others in my party had the same complaint about the steak.

At such times I personally feel like whipping out a paint-ball gun and saying to them, \\"You want something to film? HERE's something to film! Yippee-kai- yay, muh-fuh!\\" and giving it to 'em, BUKKAKE style. Heck, I'd gladly pay for their clothes--just for the chance to do this but ONCE, and get away with it. But of course, that isn't how it works... if I did something so radical, then *I* would be the one getting into trouble, even though I was the one being violated w/o any permission, but  a moment before.... \\n\\n\\nAbout the food here: the tri-tip chili was tender and filling, but light in the loafers, when it came to seasoning. Choose an identity with boldness and STICK TO IT, young buck! You're about 85% of the way there with  this recipe--- Finish, and pity your customers, is what I say! As for the highly-accalaimed chicken-tenders: I was as much, if not a bit more (given my OCD tendencies) informed on prehistoric culture in my dinosaur/caveman fascination phase in childhood than the other kids in my class, but I utterly fail to see what is even remotely paleo about deep-fried chicken tenders. Sure they were tasty---damn! HEck yeah, they were tasty.... . But Paleo?\\n\\n\\n\\"Paleo\\" as a cultural/foodie concept is threatening to go the way of \\"Organic\\" and \\"sustainable\\" quickly here---relegated to the ash heap of history w/o mercy, mired by its own baseless pretension and absurdity.\\n\\n\\nHowever, there is a clear-cut humorous undercurrent to this cart and the young man running it, and that is absolutely their saving grace, and why I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. Being not any better than a Caveman myself, how can I do other than give some love to this food cart?"},{"name":"Arrivederci Wine & Jazz","address":"17025 SE McLoughlin Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Overall a good experience.

Escargot was excellent.  Texture was smooth and soft; it blended beautifully with the tiny mushrooms it was cooked with.  The rich flavor of the sauce it was cooked in was perfect as an appetizer.  My duck dish was an exciting introduction to the versatility of this beautiful bird.  Moist, tender duck breast and crunchy duck confit came beautifully assembled atop a glaze of thick balsamic sauce.  I preferred the seared rare duck breast over the very delicious confit; nonetheless, I was an overjoyed epicurean.  I had a bite of my brother's medallion; it was tender, juicy, red...excellent.

If you go you should try the naan which was very good, light and different again from the dense, chewy naans in Indian restaurants but the aloo paratha was a revelation. It was large and generously stuffed with an amazing potato mixture and slightly charred from a grill giving it a smoky flavor.

The burrito is solid and hefty?  There's just enough spice between what is in there and the available sauce?  I, of course, had to go back soon, just to make sure that I wasn't imagining it.  Second time, just as good.  Third, fourth, however many times leading up until now, never disappointed with a meal.  \\n\\nOh, I didn't even mention the price.

I think they just put the brisket in the steam table and pull it per order. The mac & cheese was phenomenal. One of the best I've had. This is what is preventing me from giving it one star.

I inquired with the waitress and she mentioned that these were freshly cooked and that I probably previously had the leftovers that they heat up in the microwave, thereby cooking them more. Repeat: She actually admitted that they microwave the food. My other two items were still good but I had no desire to eat the yellow lentils which I usually love because they seemed too hard.

No air conditioning, not even a fan. That affected my meal.\\n\\nStarted with a salad of watercress, arugula with a tart tasting dressing with shavings of parmesan cheese. It's ok, refreshing.

I mean a sharp chipped edge. Told the waitress she frowned and brought the glass of water away. No sorry, no nothing.\\n\\n2nd appy was an assorted plate. 2 small fishies that tasted like lemon juice. Taro ball that had been marinated with broth (this is my favorite item on this dish) 2 pcs of sesame crusted Conch, ok very chewy delicate flavor. Monkfish liver with jam on top, this I am quite disappointed. I've had this dish before in Japan and @ other Japanese restaurants. It's suppose to be like fois gras but this one is tasteless and the preserve does nothing for the dish, it's just sweet jam. The oyster shooter I like as well with the raw qail egg and some kind of soya and liquor? 1 medium size raw oysters, nothing extrodinary. 1pc of pumpkin.\\n\\nNext we had the robata Quail leg with nugget potatoes. The sauce is the best part, it's a savoury demi glace robata sauce. The Quail leg is nice flavor but quail in itself is not my favorite poultry. I like squab much better.\\n\\nNext is Kobe beef? Again waitress did not explain. 3 thin slices of beef grilled medium well, ok not special. Mashed potato with truffle oil? And there is what looks like a section of a spring roll filled with pulled beef, salty sums it up.\\n\\nNext is black cod. This is from the belly section which had a lot of bones. The black cod is not the freshest I've tasted so the flesh is grey in colour. There is 2 pieces of pumkin with some kind of mushy crab flavor white substance on top and cheddar cheese??? I don't quite understand this dish.\\n\\nNext miso soup with clams. The clams were broiled to DEATH and tasted like rubber. Clams added extra salt to the already salty miso thereby SUPER SALTY soup. Maybe try geoduck or light miso please.\\n\\nNext we had 3 pieces of sushi??? 1 Salmon, 1 Tuna & 1 Unagi. Disappointment written all over my face @ this time.

She was told to never mind as we would be leaving.\\n\\nAs we were exiting, the last of our group arrived, just in time for the migration. Bil spoke with the manager before we left to find out why they were unwilling to seat our group. The excuse was that it would be inconvenient to \\"tie up\\" a table and waitperson while waiting for our group to fully arrive. Now, keep in mind that there were about 30 seats available on the deck and a good 6 or 7 tables free in the dining room. Hmm, I'm sure the waitstaff would have been okay with a group ordering drinks and apps while waiting for a few more people. And then more drinks, and dinners all around.

The restaurant is beautiful, with high ceilings, a vast outdoor patio, and modern decor.  It was extremely busy and they were understaffed; however, we were seated immediately due to having a reservation. The hostess was friendly and professional. The tables were very close together and it was difficult to sit down and get up without us knocking our neighbors and out neighbors knocking us.\\n\\nWe ordered and received very delicious coffee. I could have had at least 5 cups during the meal, it was that good. But, the service was horrible. I had my cup refilled twice and I had to flag down the server just for that. (We were there for over an hour and a half.) I ordered the eggs benedict and the eggs were perfection, the ham was a bit dry, and the potato (instead of English muffin) was perfectly cooked. I love medium eggs and the most wonderful thing about eggs benedict is to mop up the egg with a little bread. You can't do that with potato, so I was shocked to find not even a small piece of toast on the side of this dish.  My friend ordered the french toast which she found extremely oily and undercooked. She was very embarrassed about saying anything to the server and waited a little bit to build up her courage. When she told the server, the server snapped, \\"Why didn't you say anything when I was here earlier?\\" We both sat in shock. The server asked if she wanted something else. My friend ordered the granola with yogurt. It was 1/2 cup of granola with 2 tablespoons of yogurt. While she said it was tasty, the lack of yogurt made it dry and difficult to swallow.\\n\\nThe funny thing as that due to my friends complaint about the food, she was worried the manager would come over which she found even more embarrassing. I told her not to worry; that is a manager's job and I would talk to him or her. Not only did the manager never come over, but we never actually saw someone who could have been the manager.\\n\\nIn the end, it wasn't worth the money, the rudeness, the wait, or the headache."},{"name":"Pizzeria Ludica","address":"189 Keefer Place","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Fun times while eating!

The first sign that they aren't true smoked ribs is the meat coming away from the bone cleanly.  Ribs that have been slow smoked from beginning to end simply don't do that.  The meat clings to the bone, and you knaw it off or cut it off with a knife if you are in polite company.  My guess is that they are boiled or baked first, then finished in a smoker to get the bbq appearance.  Having said that, they are decently tasty, just not real bbq to me.

Tonight it seemed like an entirely different restaurant.\\nMy husband turned 50 today and when we were deciding what to do this evening with our best friend and daughter, he said we should go back to 62.  I emailed the restaurant to tell them we would be returning  for my husbands 50th and when we arrived, I reminded them again...they assured me they were well aware of the celebration, not to worry.  The service throughout dinner was horrendous.  My daughter very clearly stated she wanted her asparagus as an appetizer and pizza for dinner.  The pizza came first...when she said she had wanted the vegetable as her app, the waitress actually argued with her and said she asked clearly how to serve it, I had to demand she take it back and bring it with our entrees.  Instead of moving the empty app plates that the table was set with, she slid them aside with the plates holding the appetizers, one almost fell on the floor, another on the lap of my friend.  \\nAnd then of course there was the fact that they entirely forgot to bring a dessert for my husbands birthday. I will say that the food was great, but no matter how good a meal is, bad service is a deal breaker.\\nThe hostess apologized and offered me $10 to return (this is based on a $1700 bill from the first visit and 225 tonight).  I refused, called and asked that the owner call me.  He called immediately, also apologized and said he was also aware that it was a birthday celebration.  He also said that he hoped we would return.  THis was also very nice...although you only turn 50 once.

Other the the somewhat drab exterior (and location) and slightly Americanized service, the interior, atmosphere, and food are very reminiscent of many cafes and restaurants in central Paris (I-X Arrondissements).  \\n\\nThe best value by far is the prix fixe menu du jour (wine not included), which changes daily.  The prix fixe portion sizes are a bit smaller than if you order ala carte, but they are just the right size to make it through all the courses.  Good beef, salmon, and duck specials are authentically and expertly prepared.  On steaks, you can even ask for the French-style preparations (\\"bleu\\",\\"saignant\\",etc.).  Good salads and very well done mousse au chocolat and creme caramel.   Note:  the accompanying vegetable portions also tend to be a bit small, almost to the point of being an afterthought.\\n\\nOne can definitely order a la carte, if one is in a splurging mood   There are good but a limited set of entrees as only the prix fix menu change.  Tip:  Arrive and/or eat early for best selection and availability. Good wine selection to match the meals and to date, you are allowed to bring in your own wine with a corking charge.  However, be prepared for strange looks from the waitstaff should you bring in a non-French wine to have with your meal.\\n\\nI only wish that they could would offer real foie gras with the appetizers/starters, but I guess they disdain from doing so out of animal rights concerns.  Obviously, this is not an issue in France where foie gras is  regarded as a \\"significant part of French gastronomy and culture\\".\\n\\nThe only issues I see with the place is the slightly off 6th street location.  Parking can be a real hassle in this part of town.  Additionally,  the seating can definitely be seen as a bit cramped by American standards, but this type of tight seating is very common in Paris.   And I, at times, have felt a bit rushed by the waitstaff, as sometimes there is a noticeable push/attempt to get a 2nd (or 3rd) seating out of their dinner hours.  This is perhaps one of the biggest differences between France and the US.  Waitstaff in French restaurants in France usually tend to be a bit more discreet (some may argue slow) than those in the US.       \\n \\nOverall, I would rate Chez Nous very highly with it's good and authentic food.  Pricewise in comparison with the other French cuisine restaurants in town, it is definitely the best value as well.  4/5 stars."},{"name":"Trudy's North Star","address":"8820 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This is absolutely the most amazing place!

Some cilantro, fresh and burnt scallions round off the seasonings.  The meat is really tender and definitely beats out the lame shredded white meat only stuff at pasteur or le's.  The only problem is that they don't cut the chicken at all, and it's difficult to eat a quarter of a chicken with chopsticks.  The curry broth is great, and the taro is a really nice touch.  The potatoes were a little odd.

He advised us the better options for food and me, my dad, & gf order the lobster and steak.  I thought it was great. Presentation was messy (clutter) but whatever it tasted good. We all agreed. My mom got a burger.  She said it was okay but that she would get it again. Overall, I liked the place.

We had the same bald server guy from the first time, but this time couldn't care less about us... I have no clue what his problem was but either way that's not my fault. We both ordered the tavern burger or something - which ever has bacon and onions. When we finally got our food it was saturated in oil from the onions. Now don't get me wrong... I understand they have to cook them in oil but i mean there was so much oil that it was soaking into my burger, dripping off the side, and into my bread... no bacon - (sorry thats like the best part) & my burger was overcooked. =( I literally didn't eat it. I pushed it to the side. The server came by, filled our drinks, and walked away. The manger finally came over to check on things and I told him about the burger. His bright idea was to bring us some bacon, to fix the problem... but that is literally it. I don't want bacon for my overly soaked sh*tty burger. (sorry to be rude but that doesn't even make sense). Anyway... basically no one cared. We paid for burgers we literally didn't eat... but I guess that's fine because thats pretty much all the money you are getting from me.

It is my go to take out place in the area for delicious Thai food. It makes me sad when people review them for their Chinese or the fact that they even advertise themselves as a partial Chinese restaurant, because the family is in fact from Bangkok and they know Thai. The owners are super friendly and always happy when we come in. They know our order and it's so great to have a family owned business in town that tries to get to know their customers. \\nGo to dishes are the Tom Ka Gai- which is one of the best I've ever had. They add a twist to theirs and skip out on a traditional ingredient by making their own blend of herbs (so we're told) which consists of some galangal and other tasty things. It is actually quite delicious vegetarian as well. \\n\\nThe Pad See Ew is amazing as well. This is one of my go to Thai dishes so I've tried it out at a lot of other places too. They have the perfect blend of soy sauces, oyster sauce, and the rice noodles are thick, rich and on point. It had Kai-Lan (Chinese broccoli) to add texture, along with carrots. Talk about comfort food! Yum. \\n\\nA new favorite of mine is the Gang Sub-Pa-Ross, which is pineapple, coconut milk, tomato, and curry paste which sounds bizarre as can be; yet this dish is just a warm your soul, melt your worries, sweet and spicy, treat. Something about the curry and pineapple mixed together add the most unique flavor which is unlike anything I've ever had. I love this with chicken too. It has the consistency of a thick soup. It can be eaten almost like a think soup or I love to pour this over a heaping pile of steamed rice. \\n\\nIf you are looking for a boojie Thai place, then Nongs is not the place for you. This is a hole in the wall, for sure. The decor is a mix of Thai collectible-like items, religious Buddhist mini shrines, outdated tables, and a funky, but charming fish tank. Although the decor is not swanky, you should eat there if you ever want to not to take out.

Well I'm prone to exaggerating a bit but not about my experience at Spice Steakhouse in Downtown Orlando. Before coming to the restaurant I read up on some reviews from past patrons about Spice since I had not been there. I have to say I was not thrilled by most of the reviews, \\"food OK, service bad, wait staff didn't seem to care, blah blah blah\\" Though I tried to keep optimistic, I couldn't help but here those reviews at the back of my mind.\\n\\nI was meeting up with friends for a birthday. A birthday celebrated by eating steak, which is just about perfection to me. Walking up to Spice, I immediately noticed fire trucks blocking the intersection on an anonymous tip for a \\"suspicious\\" package that turned out to be nothing in the end.\\n\\nI ordered first and decided on the 16oz rib eye and the person sitting right next to me couldn't decide on the rib eye or the NY Strip and asked the waitress for her opinion. She replied, \\"I'd go with the NY Strip because the rib eye is a bit too fatty and tough. The NY Strip is better.\\" WHY DIDN'T SHE SAY THAT TO ME? I am after all ordering the same steak and sitting right next to the person that wanted the opinion. If you thought that a cut of meat was sub-par why wouldn't you tell me that? Needless to say, I switched to the Strip.\\n\\nThere was a baby with us and we asked for crackers and/or fruit like apples. We saw that there were apples on the menu for the Brie plate so we figured apples were a safe bet. The waitress replied that there were none and the only crackers they had for the Brie plate were a bit large. We agreed on those and moved on. When she finally brought us crackers for the baby, they were spicy crackers or heavily peppered crackers. Why would you bring spicy crackers to a baby? If they were the only crackers in the house I'd understand but when the Brie plate came out, there were plain crackers. Oh yeah, there were apples too. When the steaks were served I found it to be cooked as ordered (medium-rare to medium) but it was a bit under-flavored. The strip needed some more salt and it would have been decent. The other steak orderer, also had a well cooked steak, though his looked like a better cut of meat than mine.\\n\\nIn the end, my first trip to Spice Steakhouse will be my last. The food was OK at best but the service was undesirable. Did I mention that they forced gratuity on a table of 5? 6 I've heard of but never 5. At 19% too, which I thought was an odd number.

I still liked the curry chicken katsu, and also ordered a modified chicken ramen dish (they substituted rice noodles for me), and a kids version yaki soba. Those latter dishes were just okay. Their takeout containers and packaging aren't the greatest - the curry chicken katsu was placed in an oval plastic dish, and everything was mixed up inside, including the light salad that comes with it. When they packaged the noodles, they didn't separate the noodles from the soup into separate containers (even though I did ask in advance if they do that - i was assured it was a \\"special container\\"). Not the biggest deal, but the better Asian restaurants usually separate the soup from the noodles for takeout because otherwise the noodles absorb all the soup by the time you open the container at home. The yaki soba was just so-so for me. Next time I will just dine in if I have the time.

Perfectly chewy noodles, sublime broth, tender cuts of meat, seriously heaven.   I was really hoping for that here, too. Alas... not quite.\\n\\nMentei, I need a good Japanese noodle place in Boston. We don't have any izakaya in Boston, and half-decent Japanese food of ANY stripe can be a serious search in this town (though it can be found!).  But I know curry rice, ramen, omrice, donburi, etc etc -- those are the comfort foods you cannot futz around with.  You either own it or you don't.

Should I rate the food mainly like I would a French restaurant in a strip mall? Should I focus on the experience of dining in Beast's chateau? Ultimately I gave it a five. But if I were to break it down:\\n\\nFood: 4\\nAmbience/Decor: 5+\\nService: 5+\\nCost: 3\\n\\nLet me start by saying that the food is good. Almost shockingly good for princess-themed venue inside a Disney themepark that isn't named EPCOT. In fact, I'd say that this is as good as many of EPCOT's World Showcase restaurants (which are by far the best in Disney) -- better in some cases. It's pretty high praise to say that if this was a French restaurant in that proverbial random strip mall (with nothing else special about it) the food would still be four stars. \\n\\nI had the herb-crusted lamb rack with stone ground mustard demi-glace. The lamb wasn't gamey at all, but was juicy and tender. It's actually quite hard to cook lamb properly, as many restaurants actually fail at this endeavor. My wife's saut√©ed shrimp and scallops atop a puff pastry was fresh and well prepared. A standout was the french onion soup. It is vegetarian (containing cheese, so not vegan), but doesn't suffer in taste for that. In fact, it was rich without excessive oiliness or saltiness.\\n\\nFor dessert, the lemon raspberry cream puff was pretty good, but not a standout. Even though we didn't order it, they also gave us a complimentary sampler cup of \\"grey stuff\\" -- a signature dessert. It's based on a line in the \\"Be Our Guest\\" song within the Beauty and the Beast movie. It was ok -- a bit sugary and reminiscent of basically a cup of icing.\\n\\nIt's Disney, so I think great service is basically a given. However, I do want to give credit to the very personable German lady who was our waitress. \\n\\nThe thing that really blows the doors off most other dining experiences of course is the spectacular atmosphere of the restaurant itself (assuming Disney style theming is your thing of course. If not -- why are you in the Magic Kindom ;)). Even by Disney themepark standards, this place is a standout. I would say there is no more impressive dining space I've seen except MAYBE the Harry Potter restaurant at Universal.\\n\\nThe walk up to the restaurant is over a drawbridge graced by \\"stone\\" lions and gargoyles, where you enter a gate in the mountain below a forced-perspective Beasts' castle glowering above. Inside, there are three main dining areas: The ballroom where outside the glazed windows it is forever snowing; a charming parlor (the least interesting); and Beast's \\"West Wing\\" which is moody and dark with shredded tapestries, a rose whose petals are forever falling, and a periodic lightning storm.\\n\\nWhen we were unsure of whether we could even get in, I had wanted to see inside even if we couldn't eat. I will say, its a bit strange that they gated probably the most impressive \\"attraction\\" in the New Fantasyland area behind a limited-seating restaurant.\\n\\nFor lunch, the restaurant is a quick-service place (aka get your tray, order, pick up) that is easier to get into, and less expensive. Late afternoon, it converts to a full sit-down restaurant with more refined French cuisine and higher prices.\\n\\nGet reservations months in advance, as its pretty difficult. We got lucky and got on the waiting list right at the dinner opening (thus getting seated quickly) but I wouldn't put the fate of your little one's dining dreams in the hands of fate like that.

The bland sauce and cheese combo shines when topped with onions, chicken, and lots of BBQ sauce, but otherwise, it's pretty unimpressive. But because it's under $4/slice, it's nothing a sprinkling (or ten) of red pepper flakes can't fix!\\n\\nPray for a slice with crust, otherwise good luck trying to pick that greasy sucker up.\\n\\nIf they don't have any BBQ or Buffalo fresh, I'd skip the sad-looking Sicilian alternatives and just go for a standard pepperoni slice.  Their cheese blend is nice and salty, and I'm kind of partial to the soft/doughy crust style.  \\n\\nIf you need passable pizza in bulk for a function or something and don't feel like dealing with the rude and lackadaisical management at Upper Crust, go here.  They will probably be willing to cut you a deal.\\n\\nSide note: slush is definitely a no-go.

The prawn was grilled and tasted good ( unfortunately there was only 1 ).\\n\\nThe beef on shaved spinach was nicely done as well. The flavours were light and it wasn't drowning in sauce.

The good news is that I was wrong in my assumption.  The bad news is this assumption kept me out of Bakersfield for a year.\\n\\nBeing an Angelino, I have spent a few times in Bakersfield, CA, and frankly, naming a food establishment \\"Bakersfield\\" to me would be like naming a restaurant Whitehall, or Blacklick.  I was ignorant to the real story having to do with SoCal western music recording/legends...  When I first saw the restaurant I thought to myself (and told Charlie a year ago) there is no fucking way I am going to a restaurant named Bakersfield, and that was that.\\n\\nWell I was totally wrong.\\n\\nCharlie and I were looking for something to get into while gallery hopping, and I was just tired enough not to fuss over going to Bakersville for a bite.  I had noticed that it is always packed, but that doesn't mean a thing as First Watch and Bdubs are also packed regularly.  So we go to the bar, and I ask our bartender Adrianne if they have Herradura, and she said yes.  I ordered Charlie a Herradura margarita, and Adrianne proceeded to make a stunning drink in a salted highball, out of fresh lime juice, with Cointreau AND a splash of Grand Marnier!    Not surprisingly, it was the best margarita we have had in Ohio thus far.  I always feel it's a good indicator when the drinks knock it out of the park to start off a meal.\\n\\nWe asked for veggie options and decided to order everything recommended.  I added a chicken mole taco, and we started with guacamole.\\n\\nI honestly don't know where to start.  The most important thing to me was the obvious high quality ingredients and thoughtful preparation.  The guacamole came out first, and it was hands down the best I have had in Ohio, and it rivals my favorite mom and pop Mexican ranchero restaurants in east LA.  Huge chunks of avocado, super tart, minimal.  Totally excellent!  With house made chips, super thin restaurant style.  I really could have used 2 mouths and 4 hands to handle  the crave that set in.\\n\\nThen the tacos came out, and they were all delicious!  A perfect blend of familiar and interesting.  And again, totally delectable.  The more I ate, the hungrier I got.  I loved the mole in the chicken taco and would have loved a side of it to go with.  The salsas were also fresh made.  This is EXACTLY what I want in a Mexican meal.  There was nothing we ate that tasted preprocessed.  This is a huge deal for me personally.  I can cook the fuck out of food, so if I am going to shell out bucks on dinner, I want it to be the kind of ingredients and care that I invest in my home cooking.  And Bakersfield delivered big time here.\\n\\nAlso of note, the wait staff was great!  Attentive without feeling hustled.  Knowledgable of the menu, everyone we saw was attractive in their own way, and people seemed happy to be working there.  We were able to have a chat with managers Lindsay and Skeeter (I know it wasn't that exact name, can't remember but it was cool and unusual) and they both gave us a nice history and insight into the vision of the restaurant.  The most important impression they made on me was their passion for the business of feeding people good food.  It didn't feel like a management philosophy based solely on some ridiculous bottom line.  You would think that everyone in the restaurant business would get it, that if you make amazing food, and serve it with a great staff in a sexy space, that THIS is the best way to preserve the bottom line.\\n\\nThe decor and ambiance could be described as comfortable and inviting.  All the guests were jovial.  It was seriously good times all around!\\n\\nIt is so nice to see a restaurant in that spot doing well. \\n\\nThis was a reminder to me of how stupid it is when I judge a place by something as petty as its name, especially before I get the scoop.

She seemed to buzz around getting everything done without any fuss; all done with a smile. This is definitely a haunt for locals since she knew many of their names when them entered for lunch. The menu is extensive and awesome. None of those crappy half done cheap cheese nachos here. The nachos were covered in cheese with all the toppings on a plate large enough to feed most of West Roxbury.  My wife's fish sandwich looked great but escaped my clutches. Finally the test of tests they pour a solid glass of Irish whiskey. Prices are excellent, parking is challenging but manageable and the experience top flight."},{"name":"Take Sushi","address":"4528 Hastings Street","city":"Burnaby","stars":"4","text":"I frequently drive by Take sushi, but never took notice until this New Year's Day when all neighboring sushi establishments were closed, except for Take. I decided to take a chance and made reservations for 630pm. When we arrived, our table was not ready and we waited for 15 minutes for them to clean up two tables that finished their meals. We promptly ordered, and then waited another WHOLE HOUR for our food to arrive. They were quite busy that night, though not extraordinarily so, but it appeared that they were understaffed in the kitchen. We ordered the bento boxes, seafood udon, and standard maki rolls. Fish was okay, nothing crazy to write home about. The tempura was nice and crisp. What was most disappointing was the service. We had to flag the waitress down to have them bring us tea. Nobody took notice of us for quite some time. We are normally used to very quick service and preparation. However, Take sushi disappointed us in that regard, and if we have to wait 1 hour for sushi, we will not be coming back."},{"name":"Thai Fresh","address":"8409 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great!

I average one visit a month to Wildfire and have only had one negative experience in the three years I've gone. For the most part, the waiters are timely, polite, and knowledgeable in the menu and offer great drink recommendations. They offer a fun beer tasting on the menu which we tried once and found that they complimented our meal as much as some of the amazing wine they have. I've never had a meal I didn't enjoy. My personal favorite are their AMAZING 3 cheese mac n cheese (it is to DIE FOR!) and the smoked cedar plank salmon. They feature nightly specials and have terrific cuts of meat and fresh seafood. The decor is what originally drew us to this location. The restaurant is styled like a 1950's lounge/steakhouse. They have large blk & wht modernized retro photos on the wall and an amazing  (and well known) martini bar! I think Wildfire is perfect for just about any occasion. I've been with a girl-friend after shopping at the mall for a casual mid-day meal, and I've had romantic dinner dates with my fiance. As a suggestion, I recommend making a reservation or calling ahead as the place *can* get a little packed on certain nights...AND when making the reservation, request to have a great and knowledgeable server. \\n\\nMy one complaint occurred around the holidays last year. My mom was visiting from California and we took her to Wildfire for her first meal in ATL. I had made a reservation, requested a certain table type and we showed up five minutes early and they were happy to oblige and sit us. Food was amazing, BUT, our server was terrible. He had such a terrible attitude and demeanor. He looked miserable and acted no different. He made sarcastic comments to us at the table, made a beyond offensive comment to my mother and then disappeared for 30 minutes. He didn't show up again until he brought the check and we had JUST gotten our food (and wasn't ready to pay and leave yet, heck, we were STILL EATING!) and said to us that \\"I will be back in five, will your payment be ready?\\" I jokingly asked what his rush was and he simply walked away! When we looked at the check, he gave us the wrong table's check. So, I had to find him (as he didn't return in the 5 minutes he said he would) and tell him we needed OUR check. He then preceded to grab it from my hands and without apology printed a new receipt and slammed it into the check book and put it into my hands!!! This guy at this point had disrespected me and my family to a point where I felt my temper starting to flare. I said directly to him, \\"How long have you been a waiter?\\" and he responded with \\"long enough\\". I explained to him that when you preform a service job, you have to give SERVICE. He had been rude and nasty from the moment we sat down. The manager, hearing what was happening, immediately stepped in, and having overheard the waiters responses to me, apologized and went above and beyond to make the situation right. He rep-remanded the waiter, comped most of our meal, brought over free desert AND sent us a $50.00 gift certificate in the mail a week later! Next time we went in, the manager came over to our table, greeted us and insured that what we experienced was a one time thing and the waiter had since been let go and ensured that we would receive nothing but the best service from now on...and you know what, he lived up to his word. Every time since that experience, we've had great service and treated with respect. I've left this restaurant always feeling appreciated!"},{"name":"NadaMoo!","address":"1701 South Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I had never heard of this place before, but I have a love for cutesy dessert-themed things.

We also ordered a spicy chicken appetizer. Overall the food was full of flavor and spices. The only thing we didn't like about the restaurant is that the portion size was very small and when you ordered these dishes they didn't come with anything. No rice no bread, so we decided to order some traditional bread they recommended people order to eat it with. You will see in my pictures how big the portion was. Keep in mind that it was just the little bowl we initially ordered everything else we had to add on top.

I hear it's almost impossible to just walk in for dinner and many people book their reservations 6 months in advance.\\n\\nI don't want to give away too many spoilers, but the whole thing is an \\"experience\\" in itself. First you have to wait in front of the big castle doors - only your party, as you are let in through the magical doors. You get an introduction to the restaurant, and even the way they escort you to the table is special. Like everything at Disney, the details are impeccable and the building was gorgeous. We sat in the main ballroom against the fake windows so we could see all of the action but still have privacy. What surprised me most was the food. Everyone complains about Disney's prices but I thought the quality of the food matched the price. An entire meal would run about $50 per adult, and I can see paying the same amount for this dinner outside of Disney. I had the salmon, which was perfectly cooked (medium) and very fresh tasting. Nothing was oversalted. My sis had the braised pork, also perfectly melty and delicious and came with a good amount of vegetables. Save room for dessert because that is what I'll crave the most. The chocolate cupcake was very adult-like - deep, dark, bittersweet chocolate. And the Gray Stuff! It's worth the hype. I wanted to eat five of them.\\n\\nYou are allowed to wander through the other rooms after you eat. The room that is supposed to be Beast's room might be scary for little kids - very dark with ripped and shredded things around. My 5yr old niece asked why Beast was angry, and then said \\"Oh yeah, sometimes he gets mad at Belle and breaks things.\\" Yeah, that's kinda creepy and not a great thing for boys and girls to know. Ugh, writing that makes me even more angry and hurts my heart. You can't change the movie at this point, Disney should think about highlighting something else rather than his violent tendencies. I'm getting off topic.\\n\\nI am giving this four stars based on the entire experience as if it were a dinner show.

When I come down here, I would usually get the Pho Tai which is the rare beef slices with rice noodle soup. If I calculated how fast they serve the food, it would probably take 20 seconds just because the rice noodles cooked al dente will take a minimum 6 seconds to cook in boiling hot water. Add in some slices of beef and pour in the broth and ding!

I don't know WHY restaurants get rid of great dishes when they are popular!!  But this is what they have recently done....  Probably some \\"innovative chef\\" is behind this, but the changes are terrible!   They have totally changed the best dish on their menu, the Chile Relleno : now, it's turned INSIDE OUT, with the meat and sauce BELOW the poblano chile which is now stuffed only with cheese...  I like cheese, but a giant poblano pepper that's only stuffed with cheese is both boring and overwhelmingly distasteful!  What made this dish so good (the way that they USED to make it), was that the meat absorbed the flavor of the pepper and when you cut into it, you got a nice blending of flavors.  By separating all of the ingredients, this dish completely lost its appeal and ended up being both strange and unappetizing!   I love cheese and poblanos, but this mess was so bad, I couldn't even finish my meal.  They really need to GO BACK TO MAKING THEIR CHILE RELLENO THE WAY THAT THEY USED TO !!!  They also introduced a new dish that my wife tried but couldn't finish either, so they are TWO STRIKES for us.  Unless they realize they have made a mistake and go back to making our favorite dishes they way that they used to, we may stop coming, even after 30 years!

Bottom line: the pho at Xinh Xinh in Boston's Chinatown is very good.  I tried two varieties (my two favorites, that is), the pho ga (chicken pho) and the pho tai (beef pho).  Their pho ga broth was simple, clear, and very tastey, but a far cry from Le's (the best pho ga out there).  It was lacking the subtle sweetness that is likely derived from integrating a small amount of rock sugar in the base (yes, I shamelessly interrogate \\"the help\\").  The beef broth was excellent and spot on traditional.  You intuitively know this when your nose detects just a hint of clove when they place the bowl in front of you.  The quality of the meat in both dishes was very good.  There were no ligaments or excess fat as you might find in some places.  I was, however, dissapointed that they messed up the easiest thing...the rice noodles!  I definitely had a \\"come on, man!\\" moment as I discovered the noodles in the beef batch were not completely blanched/rinsed.  When this step is missed (or rushed as was probably the case here) there there remains a residual sticky starchness on the noodle that is never texturally pleasant and actually steals away the flavor of the broth.  All in all, however, a pleasant pho experience.  I would go back, for sure.

The fish wasn't breaded - thank god, nor was it dredged in blackened seasoning. It was well seasoned and the portioned were definitely more than enough to share. What was the highlight were the Hawaiian pork tacos though - oh my word. And the green sauce? They were terrific and if I had my way? I would've eaten an entire plate of the grilled pineapple. The sides were typical - beans and ride in little tacos bowls with a sprinkle of white cheese. Sides of guac and very fresh pico. \\n\\nNeither of us had margaritas, but the table next to us did and they were freshly made. Looked amazing!!

We ordered a fish and pork dish, plus gnocchi.  Good desserts.  Ordered a Littorai Pinot (Happy BD, honey!) which was fantastic.  Will we be back?  Probably not, especially since it had been a good 15 years since our last visit to Boulder, but I wouldn't mark Frasca off my list.

I might even say I liked the flavor better here... (although the pasta itself was a little stiff, which I understand when you're dealing with yolk). I used the exemplary bread to sop up the extra yolkiness. \\nOrechiette - Waitress recommended. I snuck a few bites and this is one of those \\"sum is greater than its parts\\" dishes. It was very simple looking, but had lots of depth of flavor and more texture than expected. \\nLamb - My friend's main, the lamb, was practically singing on her plate. Luckily she let me have some of it. Very fresh minty salsa verde as a tart counterpoint, but not 80s cloying style. Perfect balance of slight game and mineral with springy freshness.\\n\\nI asked Bobby, who was introduced as a somm, but is also (I later found out), the co-owner, for a wine recommendation. My friend has been on a brunello kick, but no one wanted to drop too much dime on the big brunellos. So we had a rosso di Montalcino from Poggio di Sotto, a great brunello producer (we learned).

The run-for-the-hills-sandwich with green beans, eggs, carrots and zucchini is a bit of an odd combo-even for Portland. Is this breakfast? It was the only main dish I could order and it was very bland, I could've really used some hot sauce to give the meal some flavor but they didn't have any. However the grapefruit brulee was fantastic and the fruit and yogurt side dish was tasty. The cooks were friendly but the service was very slow (40 min wait however it was one of their first days up and running so I'm sure they're still getting a rhythm down.) The cart looks clean and cheerful but I thought the disclaimer on the side of the truck about the lack of substitution was a bit standoffish. As always, I enjoyed eating outside on the picnic tables. Overall, I found Yolk to be \\"meh.\\"  I'll continue to walk to Toast until Yolk gets more veg friendly options.

It wasn't my favorite feta and the watermelon wasn't the ripest, but I'm not hating on this dish.  It was refreshing and very aesthetically pleasing.\\nI think I already mentioned that I ate the grilled cheese.... with cheese and tomato and onion... the only thing that could have made this sandwich perfect was some arugula!  Thank goodness it is missing greens or I would be tempted to justify going back to eat it.\\nThe left side of the restaurant is adorned with wines.  Since it was lunchtime on a workday, I did not indulge in meandering through the wine list, so I would need to give them another shot to have an opinion on this part of their offerings.\\nAt this time, my vote is that this is a great little spot to meet a friend for a nice lunch or for a glass of wine before dinner.  The menu isn't extensive and the ambiance fosters a light and relaxed atmosphere perfect for these situations.  We also never felt rushed to finish up our conversation and were allowed to carry on for some time... this made me happy.\\n\\n[Side note:  this is a great place for two other reasons:  waiting for Barley Swine?  cha-ching!

I feel bad comparing this to Fogo de Chao, but how can you not?  Fogo does the best job of this in Atlanta, and if you are going to charge $35 and offer 16 cuts of meat, then I expect to see all 16 cuts of meat and get $35 worth.\\n\\nSalad bar - this was seriously disappointing - nothing was labeled.  This is a big problem for me as I have allergies and I need to know what things are.

I actually was very hesitant in making a reservation because I didn't think the limited menu and cliche atmosphere would justify the cost. Boy, was I wrong! I actually turned down a reservation to this place twice before I finally booked a last minute (same day) dinner reservation to get us out of the rain. Third time is a charm I guess. I am happy my husband convinced me to book the reservation. After all, how often are we at Disney World, especially at the new restaurant at the Beast's castle?\\n\\nOur check in was pretty seamless. We waited maybe 10 minutes to be seated but we were able to look around the lobby while we waited. Once seated we were greeted by our lovely waitress who was funny, informative, and attentive. She gave us menus and explained a few items (the lunch and dinner menus are drastically different in offerings and prices by the way). Upon her recommendations we placed our appetizer order for french onion soups, which proved to be just perfect for a rainy day. The soup was $7 but was a decent sized portion and was loaded with onion and tons of cheese. We were served some hot french rolls and a softened pat of butter to accompany our soup.\\n\\nAs for dinner, I ordered the rack of lamb (two chops) and my husband ordered the braised pork. Both entrees were fairly hearty portions and we left very full. My lamb was supposed to be served medium rare. In all actuality I had one chop that was medium and one that was medium well. Unfortunately the well done chop was excruciatingly chewy. My waitress asked twice if I like it, to which I replied \\"yes\\" because I didn't want to complain. Eventually she came up and said \\"be honest if you don't like something, I want you to be happy.\\" I finally told her about the chewy chop and she immediately offered to bring me a new chop. I declined since it was at the end of my meal but she gave me a free dessert to be sure I was satisfied. The roasted broccolini and celery root puree that accompanied my meal were both so flavorful! They shined just as much as the lamb chops. My husband had absolutely no complaints with his braised pork, which slightly resembled a roast. His meal was paired with mashed cauliflower and roasted brussel sprouts, which were equally as good as my sides. Each of our entrees were about $25, give or take. I think that is very reasonable for the quality of food, portion, and ambiance. I have been to many fine dining restaurants which charged much more for lower quality dishes. \\n\\nWe ended our meal with dessert: a tropical cream puff and the \\"grey stuff\\". They were both so good! I think the grey stuff won though by a hair, though I am surprised because I didn't expect much from it. The crisp cookie shell and creamy filling really made the dish shine. And though I can't be sure, I believe the price was around $5, which is also very reasonable.\\n\\nOur evening finished with a picture with The Beast! His castle was beautiful and I highly recommend looking at all the art in the three different dining rooms. \\n\\nIf you are at the Magic Kingdom I highly recommend dining here.

I dont know if this is because I'm used to cheaper tofu combos back iin nj/nyc but i was shocked to find out that the lunch special was $20 for tofu and a small side (bulgogi, galbi, spicy pork, bibimbap, etc). But I guess, if you're trying to eat anywhere in Boston it's gona be around that price range. \\n\\nI always order the mixed seafood with regular spice but they have over 15 types of tofu soups ranging from not spicy/white to extremely spicy.

Certainly the restaurant must have been packed. The Yelp buzz must've spread and it was a weekend lunch after all. Much to our surprise, there were several empty tables. The crowds were wholly for the eternally overpacked Trader Joe's. \\n\\nWe were seated in a nice booth and we pored over our menu. This menu wasn't like many others. The entree options were scant and there were a lot of \\"snacks.\\" The beef noodle soup and the rice bowls were the only things I would call entrees. Everything else on the menu was like Taiwanese tapas. \\n\\nWe ordered a couple things each. Every item was good. These are what we got in order of best to fair:\\n\\n1. Dirty bird bao: simple. Fried chicken and cole slaw. You can get this anywhere in Atlanta, right? NOT INSIDE A SOFT BUN YOU CAN'T. It was nice and fluffy on the outside. The chicken was crispy but there was plenty of meat to bite into. It wasn't all coating. There was also a green sauce that seemed to have a hint of wasabi. It was great. I would like a full meal-sized version of this one!\\n\\n2. Beef noodle soup: As with any soup, the broth is everything. This broth was packed with flavor, but it wasn't too salty. You didn't want to chug a gallon of water after every sip. The noodles were thick and hearty. The beef, while good, could have been a little more tender in my opinion. I've been to ramen places where it literally cooks for 24 hours. That's my new bar for how noodle soups should be. I'm not sure if I made some horribly offensive statement by comparing beef noodle soup to ramen. I DO realize they're from two different countries. Pre-emptive apologies.\\n\\n3. Pork belly bao: The pork belly was appropriate fatty. And as extolled above, the bao itself was so good. I feel like it needed something more. Like some sort of tangy or savory sauce. \\n\\n4. Wonton soup: very light, which can be either refreshing or bland, depending on what kind of move you're in. The broth is clear with some cilantro floating in it. There were four large wontons, stuffed with pork and shrimp. They looked homemade, as if the dough had been rolled the same day. If I'd change anything about this one, I'd add something to the broth. I'm not a chef, so I have no idea what. But it just feels like it's one ingredient away from greatness, you know? Like that secret ingredient your grandma says was love, but was really crack or something equally addictive.\\n\\nAll in all, great place. I want to try so many of the other things on the menu!

Let's say you come across a condo that's in an average area, but the price is above average (20% higher), and when you step inside it contains all the high end appliances, amenities, and imported or unique design characteristics.....and that's when you realize why it costs 20% more than the average neighboring condominums.\\n\\nIn other words, this place does have very good burgers, and the french fries are made fresh and never frozen, the shakes are made from scratch on the spot with good ice cream, and even their ketchup packets are premium as opposed to what you're used to seeing.  But the catch here is that all of these extras comes with a premium price.  I paid nearly $17 for 2 regular (1/4lb) cheeseburgers and 2 fries - - no drink, and no shake ($3.79 for 16oz).  I just grabbed a 44oz fountain drink at Exxon for $0.99.  \\n\\nIt reminds me a little of the famous \\"In & Out Burger\\" in California, but still comes up short in comparison to their quality and taste, plus I don't ever recall paying $17 at In & Out Burger (and that was California prices).  But if you want a change of pace from the usual McDonalds / BK / Wendy's and don't mind digging extra deep into your wallet, give this place a try.  \\n\\nTheir fries are great since they are made fresh, the hot dogs are okay - - but not the best, especially at $2.79 a pop, and they do offer a 1/3lb burger but trust me - the 1/4lb burger is plenty big enough.  Overall this place is a nice change of pace from your regular hamburger pit stop, the ambience is almost like an upgraded Rudy's BBQ atmosphere with metal picnic tables, and they always seem to have a crowd there.  \\n\\nPersonally if I could offer them my 2 cents, I'd tell them to ditch their ketchup packet supplier for someone cheaper (because that's not a niche that gains market share), have a more cost effective ice cream stand for their shakes, and manage their labor better so they can pass the savings onto the customers.

They warn you if you have young children that the west wing has thunder and lighting, a dark scary atmosphere and the walls are all torn and things are ripped up.  You know just like the movie.  My son loved it.  You may not want to sit there however if you have children that don't like those things.  The Rose also attracts a lot of people taking pictures near it, so that can be a negative depending how close you are seated to it.

I followed up with the Sauteed Shrimp and Scallops in the puff pastry with creamy lobster sauce.  This I really enjoyed as well.

I didn't remember this from the movie but our waiter was helpful with reminding us of the line from the movie.  This was what I essentially thought a brownie with some grey icing on it.

We also noticed that the restrooms in here didn't have but one mirror off to the side and none in front of the sinks.

The service was curt for the most part. The food we actually received was decent. We ordered an assortment of plates to share but one item, a trio of guacamoles never showed up. Since there were 8 of us and we had so many dishes coming at us we just forgot until the bill came. We paid our bills, then noticed we had been charged for, but did not receive our dish. The server essentially called us liars, saying she brought it,  and it took three guests in our party to talk to both her and the supervisor to finally get them to admit it never came. \\n\\nAt this point we have our coats on and are ready to leave and the offer was we could have the guac now or write our name down to get it on our next visit. As a group of 8, a trip back seemed unlikely, and we were leaving, so we no longer wanted the food. They also did not want to refund our cards since it was a busy Friday night and we had split the food 8 ways. The compromise was drinks that were equal in value to the dish. This worked out to 2 shots of tequila for our party of 8. We accepted anyway because we wanted to be on with our night. \\n\\nAs we were leaving I went to the server to thank her for getting it \\"sorted,\\" and to tell her the food was good. After I say that she turns to me and says \\"Don't yell at me\\" and walked away.

The \\"hostess\\" however.  We walked in and were told that they would have a seat for us in 10 minutes.  The hostess then suggested that we could have a drink at the bar while we waited. We thought that would be a fine way to pass the ten minutes and as we would be visible to the hostess, there wouldn't be any chance of us being forgotten.  The bartenders were very quick to serve us and created a couple of excellent cocktails.  Time passed, we enjoyed our drinks.  Well past 10 minutes my companion started watching the hostess stand, curious about why it was taking so long for our table to be ready. She noticed a couple come in and get seated right away.  I was sent up to see what was going on with our table. The hostess asked me the name we had given her. I had not had the initial conversation with her, but assumed that my companion had used her first name and gave that to the hostess. The hostess looked at her book and said that she didn't have that name. I called my companion over and asked her what name she had given the hostess. My companion replied that she had not been asked for a name. The hostess responded with attitude. Acting like we should have offered her a name without being asked, rather than being humble about not having asked us for a name. I'm sorry, we were within eyesight of the hostess stand, we were told she could seat us in ten minutes and she neglected to ask us for a name. Perhaps the girl should stick to delivering plates and cleaning up after diners, both of which she was doing while attempting to be a hostess.\\n\\nSo, that brings me to the food. I told the server we would be sharing all the dishes.  I ordered two appetizers a pasta dish and the halibut.  The two appetizers arrived together, a green gazpacho and a beet salad. The gazpacho was too acid, with no depth or subtlety of flavor. There was only the taste of onion fighting hard to rise over the vinegar. The beet salad was okay. A cashew butter took the place usually occupied by a light cheese for balancing the sweetness of the beets, but was a bit on the rich side. There was an orange merengue that didn't really add much to the dish, either texturally or flavor-wise. Both the appetizers were cold, so there weren't any issues concerning anything getting cold. Not so with the two entrees arriving together. We had to decide which one we would let cool down while we ate the other. We opted to eat the tagliatelle first. The pasta was nicely al dente with cherry tomatoes and onions. Unfortunately, the onions were tough, perhaps overdone. The dish we had decided to let cool was the halibut with eggplant and roasted peppers. The fish was overly salty, to the point of bitterness and the eggplant was tough. We couldn't bring ourselves to finish the fish.  When my companion mentioned the saltiness of the fish, to our server, he asked us if it was the fish. I replied that it seemed to be the outside of the fish. His response was a rather nonchalant suggestion that the chef must have over salted the fish when he roasted it. No big deal. Really? If you want people to come back for more, you should be concerned about the quality of the dish you create and put in front of them. \\n\\nI would say go have a drink at the bar, they know how to treat you right and have a good sense of mixology. Then go eat someplace else because the chef doesn't seem to have much of palate or doesn't care about what goes out of his kitchen.

Our first visit was quite pleasant - good food and service. That was on a weeknight and the restaurant was not crowded. This second visit occurred on a Friday night when the restaurant was considerably busier so that may be where the problem exists for this relatively new establishment. \\n\\nUpon arriving we were seated immediately. Drink orders were taken and chips and salsa delivered. This is where I say their house margarita is exceptional. We have had it before and it worth ordering ($10).\\n\\nNext was a prompt order of our food and delivery of our guacamole appetizer ($4). Dinner delivery was paced nicely. Enchiladas Mexicanas ($9) was fairly basic and the California Burro ($10) was HUGE with flavorful chicken. The temp served was a bit cool as if it had been sitting under a heat lamp while our fajitas were being made. \\n\\nThe steak fajitas ($14) were ok but nothing special. I added chorizo ($1.50) for flavor but the kitchen did not add it to my meal - the server did have it on my check when it came time to pay. The 3 tortillas that came with the fajitas were dry and brittle and really you need 5 for the balance of food served. The rice on the main plate was a bit oily, dry and felt like it had been sitting under a warmer for awhile.  \\n\\nThe real issue here is that our server never came back - not once - to see how are meal was. Thus, I could not ask for new/more tortillas or make him aware of the missing chorizo. Also our glasses were empty for 3/4 of the time that we were eating. We would have ordered another round of margaritas. \\n\\nFinally, we waited 15 minutes for a check and another 10 minutes for the final receipt to arrive. Unfortunately, this meant a 10% tip when I typically will tip superior service at the 25% range.\\n\\nNot sure I am willing to try again. The hostess did not say goodnight or ask how everything was (probably she could see disappointment on our faces).

As a starter, they serve mediocre salsa and a handful of chips but never refilled the chips even though we had 2 other apps that needed something to dip into them (no dishes for apps were given either). The Guacamole was so very salty and disappointing.  The Ceviche was bland, but there was a lot of it.  We ordered our appetizers first, then put the order in for food when the apps were served.  5 minutes later, our entrees arrived.  I told our server that we didn't really want all of our food to be served at once, but instead of taking away our dishes to keep them warm, he just put them on the table and walked away.  I ordered the Fish Tacos which came with none of the items stated on the menu.  The only things on my entr√©e plate were 3 soft tortillas with a tiny bit of roasted peppers (not on menu) and fish - no avocado or cabbage slaw or garlic mojo as indicated on the menu. If they were out of the ingredients that were listed with the menu item, they should have said so as I would have ordered something else.

There is usually not enough shrimp/pork, too much vermicelli/lettuce. Totally not worth the money. Its super simple to make at home too. \\n\\nPho: The pho is ok here. I think with any pho in chinatown it never comes out pipping hot, which is really one of the hallmarks of a great pho. I mean who wants noodle soup that's lukewarm? The broth is ok, nothing to rave about here. The only place I found with good clean broth is in philly...but I digress.\\n\\nHu Tieu Nam Vang/ bo vien: This dish is probably going to be foreign to a lot of people, since pho is the pinnacle of vietnamese cuisine. Its a soup dish with clear broth. I personally think it has a lighter broth than pho, so this is what I will usually order. The noodles are the same rice noodles used in pho. If you order Nam Vang version, it comes with imitation crab meat, some fish balls, pieces of asian \\"ham\\",some shrimp, basically seafood. The broth is good, but it needs a little bit more fish sauce to bump up its flavor profile. \\n\\nBun bo nuong cha gio (grilled beef and eggrolls with vermicelli noodles) : the problem isnt the beef or the eggrolls. The diluted fish sauce (nuoc mam) is too sweet. Definitely not how Vietnamese people make it at home. A good nuoc mam is supposed to have a hint of sweetness, saltiness, sourness, and spiciness all at once, not just one dimensional sweetness. \\n\\nCom Suon (grilled pork with steamed rice): Again..fish sauce isnt good. In a rice dish that basically requires you to dump this special fish sauce on, if the fish sauce just isnt that great, it makes the dish itself blahhh. Although, I have to give it to Xinh Xinh on the authentic rice dish experience. Usually in Vietnam, when there's a rice dish ordered, soup comes with it free of charge. This is probably the only place in chinatown that brings you a small  bowl of soup to accompanied your rice dish. \\n\\nOverall its ok. Go if you want some noodle soups to warm you up. if you are picky about your nuoc mam like me (since I'm Vietnamese), you can still go, but avoid any dishes that require you to dump this sweet concoction on top!

When I was ordering it was evident to me he didnt speak english well at all, and I had to point at everything so he could copy it down. Thats okay no biggie. He got parts of the order wrong though. We ordered melon soda he brought out a different kind. I noticed right away and ask him if its melon he goes \\"we dont have anymore\\" Im like we dont want it then. Why would you bring out something different without even saying anything beforehand. This guy. I asked for a spicy salmon cucumber hand roll he brings out the wrong kind. The food came out very well paced. The woman who brought out the food was super nice and confident. Our waiter seemed like he was in another dimension. His soul was not in his body at all. At the end of our meal he starts talking about the chefs special. What is he on? It was my bfs birthday so we both were in good moods. In general we are easy going restaurant customers, so it wasn't a big deal but he is weird. I honestly didnt think he deserved a good tip but gave him 15% anyways, I usually give 20%.

Crema and Petsi are like sisters - both serve great food (emphasis on baked goods) and drink in a friendly, casual atmosphere. Simply put, both were clearly raised well. The difference is in their personalities. Crema is the sleek, sophisticated sister who's at home in the cosmopolitan world of Harvard Square. The walls are artfully exposed brick, there's a trendy loft in the back of the restaurant to increase seating capacity, and the window seats are the modernist, Japanese-inspired, polished wood variety that I used to mistake for nightstand at my parents' house. It also attracts a different crowd that seems to consist of H-Square tourists looking for a stylish place to snack, young professionals (or, during the afternoon, the wives of not as young professionals) grabbing coffee, and professional school students frantically cramming (law) or carrying on a leisurely conversation (business). \\n\\nI usually get hot chocolate here, and it's quite good. They use lowfat milk, so it's not quite the same level of richness as Burdick's a few blocks away, but from the standpoint of cardiovascular health, that's not a bad thing. I've also gotten various types of croissants here, of which almond seems to be the best. The breakfast sandwiches, while not particularly large, are well-made.

Boy was that a mistake. The service started out okay but it quickly went downhill. We could never find our server, and when we asked another server to find ours he said \\"sure, is there anything I can do to help in the meantime?\\" We said we need refills on our drinks and when he saw there were seven of us, he quickly ran away and said he'd find our server instead!\\n\\n The next day, after a long day at Epcot, I was really tired and hungry and I didn't want to go far. So I decided to do Applebee's to go. I figured, how bad can this be? I ordered my food and part my order was a Caesar salad. When I got upstairs to my room, I saw that my salad was just lettuce, cheese and croutons! How do you forget the Caesar in a Caesar salad?

It's at the end of the building on the upper North side.\\n\\nWhile Galla's to me isn't fantastic pizza, it's definitely worth trying as I think many will like the options and ability to order slices - something you don't see much outside of Fellini's. I like to experiment with slices to find that just-perfect combination. Try a slice of sausage, jalapeno and pineapple, for instance. Or do something basic if that's your style - it's all available here. You'll get a hit of pizza and parmesan when you open the door - love that.\\n\\nI've tried some of the other menu options, like the wings and subs.

That said, Via Napoli is the best and the least expensive meal we've had in that time.  We had low expectations as we find the value, service, and quality of most Disney sit down restaurants is pretty bad.  Via Napoli was a pleasant surprise.  The check-in experience was the one lowlight -- they don't give you a pager, so everyone who has checked in has to stay in the lobby which is all of 20x10 feet and has literally 100 people in it, so do the math you get 2 square feet to stand in and wait packed back to back with 100 hot sweaty people.  The wait wasn't terrible, and my family waited outside, which was fun trying to text them the table is ready and have them plow through the waiting area to get to the table.  Once we were seated, the experience was very relaxed and refreshing.  The appetizer menu is a little challenging to find anything appetizing including a simple salad, but we came for the pizza, so that's all we got.  The kids did get $6 fruit cocktails, which we had extremely low expectations for (typically you get a bowl full of apples and grapes and they only eat the grapes, so $6 for a handful of grapes) -- however Via Napoli pleasantly surprised us with *fresh* berries -- raspberries, blackberries, strawberries.  It was cool, light, refreshing, and the kids actually ate the whole thing.  The Quattro Frommagio was $41 for a large, which easily fed 4 people.  It was simply amazing.  Light, fresh, authentic.  Since we didn't get an appetizer we indulged in a Pitcher of Sangria for $21...was expecting a carafe since a single glass was $9, but it was a full size pitcher (5 glasses), which was a great value.  Again, light, cool, refreshing (sensing a theme?).   So, grand total was $75 for four people including 5 alcoholic drinks and 2 kids appetizers.  Had we not ordered the appetizers or alcohol it would have been $50 for 4 people -- very inexpensive for a Disney sitdown meal.  It was loud, but very relaxing and refreshing.  The drinks were perfect, the kids appetizers were perfect, the pizza was perfect, the ambiance was relaxing and refreshing and felt authentic.

So they just gave us the smaller wine glasses. We had to ask for the other 3 oz of wine!\\n\\nEventually we wanted to order food. The server never actually bothered to ask this, instead we had to flag him down since he wasn't inclined to check on the table at all. We had to do this again after the appetizer was done and to get any plates cleared. Very lazy service all around. The server later admitted he wasn't very social. Ah, so that's why you avoided every table like the plague.\\n\\nThe hummus flatbread was actually a decent appetizer, although I think it was meant to be a meal. As an app, it could be shared by 4 people just fine. I ended up ordering a salmon salad as my entree. The salmon wasn't as fresh as I'm generally accustomed to, so that was a bit of a downer.

Better than most places, but the meat was still undercooked. Curry itself was delicious.\\n3) Chicken Tikka Masala smelled like butter.

Even though there is no exterior view from most of the seats, the interior decor more than makes up for it.\\n\\nService:  4 stars. Our waiter did a great job attending to our large group all by himself, but he was overworked and could have used a bit of help to fully serve everyone.  The overall service is good, not quite 5-star quality for a restaurant in this price range, but solid nonetheless.\\n\\nBoston Chart House is a great pick if you're looking for a true Boston seafood experience."},{"name":"Mundi Coffee Truck","address":"701 Tillery","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I love this place.

The service is outstanding and fast, especially before 7p.m. on a week day.  Honestly, we had 3 courses and I don't think we were there more than an hour.  We had our main waiter in addition to regular staff passing by that took up spare plates, refilled our water about 5 times and even took the salt and pepper shakers away at the end of our meal to shine up for the next set of guests!  I think this would be a great place for a date.\\n\\nBread is complimentary. We had friend calamari as an app per most reviews - It was very good though we only had two peppers in ours.  Without the peppers, it sort of tastes like any other good calamari.  The peppers is what, to me and my significant other, made the dish yet we only had two in our whole app.  We suggest the chefs add a few more in there.  Dips for calamari were average - nothing special.  Breading on calamari was good, flaky though a tad more oily than I'd prefer.  We had the eggplant (served in a cast iron pan) and Spinach Ravioli.  The eggplant was one of the best we've ever had (we've ordered eggplant from many italian restaurants) and the sauce with the Ravioli could have come by itself in a bowl with a spoon and I would have shamefully eaten it as a soup.  No improvements necessary on either dish.  5/5 on both!  Finally, we had the chocolate cake desert.  This was our only disappointment.  It tasted like chocolate cake we could get anywhere else or frankly, I could make at home.  I think they need to change this up - there is just nothing special about it other than the crispy yummy sugar shell that comes on top and I think \\"special\\" is what set their other dishes on top.  We did not get drinks and for all this (calamari app, bread, eggplant entree, full order ravioli's and desert) our bill came to about $63 with tax.  I'd say not bad for an upscale Italian restaurant!  I would suggest to dress a bit nicer though you can get away with a  nice top, jeans and nice shoes you may otherwise feel a bit under dressed but by no means is this a stuffy place.  Great atmosphere, tables are offset from the door so you don't get chilly while dining.  Very intimate and social at the same time.

My wife and I went in for lunch on Friday, April 7th - right during the middle of a big wind storm.  We'd passed this place plenty of times going to Best Buy and PetSmart and whatnot, but never thought that the BBQ restaurant in the box store parking lot could be much of anything... happy to report we were both WRONG!  My wife had the trio of BBQ sliders, mixing it up with pulled pork, chicken and turkey.  She had fries and coleslaw as sides, and we also ordered some fried pickle spears.  Right up front, I'll tell you that all I ordered was an ice tea, as I'd eaten previously... so my experience and take on the food is from picking at her plate.  Right off the bat, I have to say that the deep fried pickle spears were the best I've ever had.  They are actual spear - not chips - so you only get 4 per pickle.  Something about the texture and almost \\"meatiness\\" of these that makes them far superior to chips... and also, the breading was perfect.  My wife's sliders were simply served dry, allowing the customer to choose between a sweet, traditional or spicy sauce.  The meats were all nicely prepared, and the pulled pork was flat-out excellent.  I tried the traditional and the spicy sauces and found both to be really good.  We both really liked the fry sauce and spent some time guessing what exactly is in it... my best guess is A-1 steak sauce, mayonnaise, a bit of mustard, and maybe some BBQ rub.  I may be wrong in that guess, but the stuff is fairly unique and really good.  Long story short, we look forward to going back soon.  I went out of my way to thank our waiter for his excellent service, understanding full well he was dealing with a packed house and malfunctioning computers due to the wind storm.

Great gluten free treats! \\n\\nI ordered a jalapeno infused quejo with cream cheese and guava paste. It was made to order and came out piping hot. You basically eat it like a sandwich and with every bite, cream cheese was oozing out of the gluten-free goodness. The guava paste was also quite sweet and I could have eaten it straight up. \\n\\nThis place also offers new-age South American drinks (cold and carbonated mate in a tall boy can?!?) and raw quejo dough so you can make it yourself. \\n\\nThe only thing that makes this place dangerous is the fact that the quejos are a small treat and you could easily end up eating 2-3 in one sitting.

The ingredients are fresh and the pizza was not greasy. I also loved the neighborhood feeling of this place - last night was my first time there and they treated me like a regular.\\n\\nWith that said, my husband and I make pizza a lot at home and this was not that much better than what we make.When I eat a slice out I want  that crispy crust you can only get in a pizza oven and, quite frankly, that little more grease that I am not willing to put on my homemade version. But as I have said before, I am admittedly a pizza snob (Pepe's and Sally's in New Haven have ruined me forever.)\\n\\nThere are a lot of pizza places in E.

I was given a generous pour and the bar seemed to be a comfortable place for a few regulars that were there. We were seated right away and looked over the juice menu, which was fairly impressive. We didn't have any, but the next trip I am going to try a couple of their many juices.\\n\\nThe all you can eat salad bar offered plantains, plain and seasoned rice, beans, tomato and mozzarella, potato salad, and many other things. There was a high turn over of food, so I had no qualms about filling my plate up from the buffet. The skewers of meat arrived at the table in a very quick and orderly fashion. While I didn't try the chicken hearts, I loved the sirloin. I found the chicken wrapped in bacon a bit on the dry side. The steak sprinkled with parmesan was good enough for a second helping.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the Bourbon Chicken and was equally impressed. There was enough food for two meals and a nice thick sauce that she really enjoyed. A thumbs up for the entree.\\n\\nOne thing that really stood out was the attentiveness of the servers. In my experience, when a buffet is offered for brunch or dinner, the staff completely ignores you. Not the case here, even the manager came by to see how everything was going. We were overcharged for drinks, but that was promptly taken care of by the manager. They also provide scales for diners that prefer to pay by the pound. Just fill your plate of take-out container with the buffet offerings, stop by the kitchen window for meat, and get weighed in. This is a nice option for lunch as well. \\n\\nHighly recommended for a quick and very filling meal and is also great for groups.\\n\\nUpdated 11/28: I've eaten here on 2 more occasions and it has become one of my husband's favorite places as he would like to eat here at least once a week.  I can give a good review on the sandwiches, which are huge and were too big for a light meal for me.  I would also recommend the juices, mixed with milk so they taste like a shake, and the Caipirinha cocktail made with liquor made from distilled sugar - it packs a punch and is slightly reminiscent of a mojito."},{"name":"Los Gorditos","address":"922 NW Davis St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This was my second time eating at this restaurant and again my mind was just blown by not only how cheap the prices are but how amazing the food is!

They use Boar's Head meats and cheeses, which, in my opinion, are the best flavor on the market. They have unique sandwiches on the menu, but they also let you craft your own if none of the pre-determined flavor combos suit your fancy. I highly suggest the roasted turkey sandwich; it comes with arugula, pear, chutney, whole grain mustard, and sharp cheddar cheese. They also make salads and let you choose your own greens and toppings. Or, you can grab a pre-made salad from the fridge if you're in a hurry! Furthermore, there's a selection of drinks, chips, and baked goods if you want something to go with your sandwich, which I always do! (Apple cider donuts and chocolate croissants are on point.) But, Volante is more than just their deli counter and bakery. They have a whole other section full of fresh produce (the same stuff that goes into their sandwiches!) and other local grocery products as well as craft beer and wine to choose from.

For that matter trying to find a decent place period to eat where the prices were reasonable was non-existent, that is until we found KC Pit BBQ!  What a gorgeous huge place and so clean and neat!  We had definitely found our favorite new BBQ joint!  The name belies the beauty of the place!  Talk about upscale, televisions, professional wait staff, kid friendly, banquet halls etc., the place is incredible!  Most folks are used to BBQ places being ramshackle shacks, and we had heard that KC Pit used to be in a smaller spot, but progress prevailed and they wanted better for their clientele (courtesy of our server), yet  some folks wished they had stayed in their old overcrowded spot.  Don't worry Atlanta does have enough of these low rate BBQ places to satisfy those who crave that kind of atmoshphere, however, anyone looking to enjoy dinner in a \\"NICE\\" restaurant, whet their appetite with good down home cooking, savory mouth watering ribs, collard greens & cornbread, candy sweet potatoes and a mac n' chz that melts in your mouth - KC Pit BBQ is it!\\n\\nWe ordered the Pit Plate and had enough food to feed 2+ more persons,  and it was soooo good!  You can definitely tell that the food was not frozen or pre-made, and we saw a salad go by and land at another table and it was so large and pretty I was wondering how the person was going to eat it all.\\n\\nKC also has appetizers, and we tried the Pecan Crusted Jumbo Shrimp and OMG - it was great, and the Spinach Artichoke Dip and Chips was the best we've had anywhere!\\n\\nWalking into KC Pit BBQ was an experience as well, and you would have thought we had just come home after being away for so long - we were greeted and treated so well.

Where can you go and get good food, great pricing - I paid $22 for a rack of ribs 20 years ago, and KC is only a $1 more two decades later!  The prices are low especially when you look at the amount of food you get.  I took my daughter and 2 of her friends to a popular hamburger joint (I don't even like hamburgers) and spent $45 for 4 greasy  burgers and greasy so-called home-made fries.  We went to KC Pit and ordered 4 full-size dinners for under $40 and had beverages, and as a treat ordered several of their cakes and the Black & White Cake with the Candy Cane was delicious!\\n\\nNo place is every going to please everyone but KC Pit does have something for everyone including privacy booths and a VIP section for those who want to be alone, and I am one of those!\\n\\nI am not from Atlanta but I tell you I am proud of KC Pit and proud to boast about it and would highly recommend it to others.  There are a lot of haters out there, but when something this good is out there, criticism is always going to come.\\n\\nThere aren't any BBQ restaurants in Atlanta like KC's and this is what makes them unique and I say; \\"Keep on with the keeping on KC Pit\\" cuz you got something others wish they had!"},{"name":"DD Mau","address":"1239 Pacific Boulvard","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Really delicious vermicelli bowls.

When I want a veggie fritter, its like having foodie blinders on.  So much so, that when I found myself thrown into the land of the gluten free due to an allergy test/diet, and Yelped the closest GF haven, I thought the app was lying. Because I would know if one of the best rated GF shops around was a mere 3 blocks from the house right? \\n\\nNo... apparently not.\\n\\nEven though time and time again, the GF world surprises me with delicious things, i'm still very skeptical in trying new spots. The \\"it tastes like cardboard\\" era of the GF explosion is etched into my consciousness and so I always feel a bit wary of new spots that claim to beat the wheat. But with my beloved bagels & baguettes off the table, I needed a breakfast substitute and already knew that me and rice flour bread don't get along.\\n\\nSo I popped in here desperate for a sandwich fix. It's a nondescript little spot and pretty simple on the inside - but they've got a couple cases of take home and a deli case full of GF buns. \\n\\nFirst tip - don't get the day olds. I learned this the hard way. They are definitely a steal and still hold up if frozen, but for the real deal - get the fresh ones. Worth the extra few nickels.\\n\\nThe fresh ones are surprisingly awesome. Like Jamie F so enthusiastically mentions - gluten free cheese buns are something to be celebrated. They are a great texture when toasted - crunchy on the outside, softer on the inside and a super great consistency. In kind of the staple compliment of GF anything - I would eat these (and do) even after I could introduce gluten back into my meals.\\n\\nThey've got a ton of different options. Personally the jalapeno and just plain cheese are favs. I can't say spectacular things about the service. In fact the handful of times i've been here, it's been pretty curt - not unpleasant but definitely short - but the buns are good enough that I overlook them.\\n\\nPlus they are the perfect size for mini snack sandwiches. Which is just a happy snack all around. I'm a fan of this place. Not blown away, but still a fan. I'll save the next star for the take home case investigation and if this magical, happy service appears on my next visit, but gluten free or no, i'd definitely suggest you poke your head in."},{"name":"Bakersfield","address":"733 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"This place has a unique and delicious twist on tacos.It's Tex-Mex a la Cali.

All the sashimi had a decent size, but I had to spit out the \\"tendon\\" between the fish meat.

Whether you're a minor looking for a place to smoke off a beer buzz or a village drunk that still doesn't want to head home after a long night at the bar, this place will feel inviting and relaxed no matter what your story is. \\n\\nI had never even contemplated the existence of a place such as Shisha before it opened in the first place, so it seemed like a world of wonder when I took a girlfriend there at her request two summers ago. We ordered two different hookah flavors for us and the crew of mostly 19 and 20-year-olds that had accompanied us, selected a few coffee drinks from the menu (I ordered the chai, actually, which was delicious) and grabbed one of the couches in the side room. After a few minutes of casual loafing, one of the baristas brought our hookahs to us and left us to ourselves. \\n\\nBeing a nonsmoker, I had no idea what to expect from the experience. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised. The hookahs here taste almost nothing like smoke- it's more like a fruity mist that's distinct and pleasing to the taste buds. The atmosphere of the place is really what scores Shisha it's points in my book, though. The couches all feel like they've been passed down through countless generations of college slacking, sans the beer and puke smell that dooms most of them to the dumpster on move-out day. The walls are painted a vivid red color, and the combination of these two things makes it hard to resist the urge to glue yourself to the couch and pass out for an hour or two. The music is also top-notch- whether it's coming from Sirius or one of the baristas iPods is rarely clear, but you're always in for a solid mix of indie rock and underground hip hop that perfectly fits the mood. \\n\\nLike I mentioned before, the chai here is the best I've tasted anywhere around campus, and the mocha lattes are nothing to scoff at either. Prices, generally in the 2-4 dollar range depending on how extreme your drink is, are average and more than reasonable. The food here is nothing to rave about- I've heard that they've discontinued lunch items like wraps and sandwiches, which is probably for the better. if you're in the mood for good, quick Mediterranean food, Apollo's is a no-brainer of Shisha. Otherwise, everything else about Shisha is perfect for anything from a relaxing night with friends to an all-night pre-exam homework bender."},{"name":"The Consulate","address":"10 10th St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Great ambiance!! this place is a real gem...hoping more restaurants like this pop up in Midtown.

But when we got there to pick it up, it wasn't ready. It was ready to go at 1:08. That's right, it took an hour and 23 minutes to put together a couple of sandwiches and soups. They checked the order and then double checked it, and (thankfully) my co-worker who was picking it up triple checked it. It was on the third check that they realized the fruit cup (that I paid extra for) was not in the bag. The kicker? I ordered the spicy Thai chicken salad with no peanut sauce. It seems they neglected to note my special request when making the salad, but realized it after the fact. There was peanut sauce smeared on the lid of my salad (indicating that it had been in the box and someone tried to wipe it off), and in fact there was peanut sauce on my chicken and in my salad. Fortunately I am not allergic, but am appalled that any restaurant would be so careless.

This little joint on SoLa was smart to avoid the ridiculous cult following of and relocation of neighborhood dining to SoFi. Alas, this follows the exact same format: simple, rustic, and surrounded by true Austin institutions i.e. Lick and Barleyswine.\\n\\nThe fermented, tediously processed dairy-based proteins are found in a case boasting a small selection. Additionally, their actual dine-in sort of choices are quite ordinary. I feel as if the ambiance is not at the same level as the pretension found in the menu. It is hard to explain, but with beers at $7 and glasses of wine nearing $14, you better offer some absolutely astounding cheese and a larger selection than 3 units on an iconic cheese plate.\\n\\nMy very small pour of Sauvignon Blanc was certainly good, but I mean... a small pour to match with a rather skimpy whole cheese plate? I am not looking to spend $40 for a drawn-out wine and cheese session, or ~$20 for a pre-Barleyswine snack. Alas, I am certain that they will iron out these undesirable details, and at that point, I will return and grace Henri's with my presence once again.\\n\\nOur $14+$3 (for 1 additional) platter came with a spoonful of blackberry preserves, 7 Marcona almonds, and 3 cheeses, a triple cream brie, Parrano, and a rich blue. Average sized portions, aside from the preserves, which were excellent. A good amount of local (?) baguette, to round it out. All in all, not bad. But  I would have liked a more affordable booze program.\\n\\nYou are paying for atmosphere here. I thin kit is a good little spot for the area, and certainly a great option for those wanting a true \\"multiple course\\" dessert.

I frequented the Harvard Square when it first opened and the food was pretty good. Not London-Wagamama quality but still pretty ok. It was my staple for a couple of months. I ordered the same thing every time- Chilli Men. \\n\\nSo, after many months of a Wagamama hiatus, I decided to check out the Pru one with a friend in town. She'd never been to one so I thought I'd expose her to something cool and different. Well, I was in for something...\\n\\nFirst, the waiter was either new or inexperienced because he didn't really have enthusiasm or the maturity to explain the different style of service. Strike one. \\n\\nSecond, I ordered the veggie gyoza as a starter. The thing came super-fast. Like 2 minutes later. That's a little suspect in my book. I took one bite and knew immediately that this was a microwave job. The outside was hard and the inside didn't taste like it contained vegetables. I was quite dissappointed because I think they served me a meat gyoza. Strike two.\\n\\nThird, I ordered my usual Veggie Chilli-Men. That's when my dissappointment just hit a new level. The sauce was super-greasy. The veggies had char marks like they were grilled- which is good. However, they were mushy. Did they pre-grill them and then microwave them? Really strange. Asian dishes usually keep veggies nice and al dente. These things were mushy and bland. The whole dish was totally not cohesive and was just awful tasting. Strike three. \\n\\nAll in all, pretty horrible all round. I am not sure I'll ever go to this Wagamama ever again unless they fire their chef and get some good servers."},{"name":"El Azteca Mexican Restaurant","address":"1784 Peachtree Rd NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Say hi to Victor!

I was pleasantly surprised that the soup came with a hearty slice of focaccia. However, I'm taking away a star due to the poor milk quality in the cappuccino - the foam was separated from the coffee and not creamy, a sign of poor steaming. The latte art was a sadly executed heart. The other star I'm taking away is due to the focaccia being very cold, which could've been easily avoided. It's a shame that whoever served it didn't take the 10-30 seconds to heat up the bread.\\n\\nOverall, the caf√© has good atmosphere and quality noms.

That's hard to mess up since it's just salad. \\nI ordered the prawns. The flavor and presentation was really good. My only complaint is that it was overcooked. The prawn wasn't succulent and juicy at all. It was still edible. My family enjoyed their dishes though. They ordered the Wild Boar tenderloin and the Short Rib. Again, the seasoning and flavoring was really good, but it wasn't cooked the way we would have liked it. It's as if the chef's were so afraid we'd all get food poisoning from undercooked meat that they over compensated.\\n\\nMy mom got the yellowtail. The fish was flaky, but it's harder to overcook this fish because of its fat content. She enjoyed it but said that she liked her fish from the Fish Grill we went to the night before much better.\\n\\nFor a disney restaurant, it was really good and it is 5 stars if we only compared it with other high-end disney eateries.

Their signature sauce is bomb though.

Was out with my family and the overall the service was just bad. When we came in the waitress was slow and inefficient in seating us. They had no good non alcoholic beverages not even horchata water. I had to go with the water. They weren't able to make simple cheese quesadilla and after 45 min of waiting for our food we decided to leave. I tried contacting the manager to place a complaint, we weren't able to find the right person to talk to and our waitress was awful and rude and took more than 10 min just to check out. I've never had such a terrible experience with a simple Tex mex restaurant.

We asked for an extra shot and it was the weakest tasting coffee I've ever had... \\n\\nWhen we handed the drinks back and asked for extra caramel (after previously making a point of wanting it in the first place) the girl was a complete jerk about it and said next time she's going to charge us extra?! \\nUhhh we wanted it in the beginning we would of gladly paid for the price of the drink had they made it correctly.\\n\\nLike how hard is it to make a flippin coffee that's all you have to do it's pretty simple. \\n\\nWell there won't be a next time because we are never going back to that location again and I'll make sure to tell my friends and family to steer clear of it too!"},{"name":"BC Sushi","address":"2126 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"For the AYCE price of $12.95 during happy hour and after 10pm, this place was pretty good.  Their 25% off on all take out was also crazy good.  We had the chicken teriyaki for take out, then went back later in the night for the AYCE.  My older brother really liked it.

As a vegan tryannabee, I had to get the wonton soup cravings out of my system and this is where I finally did it. I realized the best thing about the wonton noodle soup were the noodles and the soup, the wonton which I believe they still make on site, are pretty standard. The congees are served scorching hot, but again standard, not outstanding, I think they stretch it with maybe flour or cornstarch sometimes. Our go-to dishes are the sweet n sour pork, Singapore vermicelli, lettuce wraps, any of the chow meins. The main things that have had us coming back over the years are the location (always seems to be on our way to or from somewhere and very handy), the efficiency of the service, and the reliably big portions (enough to take home for the kids). They used to have some very friendly waitresses for many years but they've gotten a little surly lately. The owner used to be friendly, but now just seems very tired. The decor never changes and that's kinda cool actually but this is one place that I avoid using the facilities if you get my drift. Maybe I've just tired of this place and it feels like a betrayal of sorts when nowadays I just seem to pass the On Lok by in favour of other places further east like the Ipoh or the Golden Penny not far east on Hastings for a quick Chinese fix."},{"name":"Red and Green Brazilian Steakhouse","address":"5979 Buford Hwy NE, Ste B1","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Stay away.  We used a Groupon to go and for $55 plus another $30 to include the gratuity and two soft drinks we could have gone somewhere much nicer. The salad bar was ok, Ruby Tuesday's is better.  Some  of the meats were fatty and inedible or under seasoned. The bread they served was not cooked thoroughly inside. My husband's stomach is still recovering, the place didn't agree with him.  For the money, you can get much better and I wouldn't imagine spending full price.\\n\\nTo be fair, the service was great and attentive but we went for the food and it wasn't impressive."},{"name":"BC Sushi","address":"2126 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"In terms of service, I wouldn't go here if your ideal dining experience requires any friendly or engaging interactions with the servers. However, the food was of adequate quality for the price you pay, very prompt with giving you your orders, and quite efficient. The food quality can range from decently fresh salmon sashimi to a sad specimen of oyster motoyaki. If you want quantity over quality, this is the place for ayce sushi."},{"name":"The Black Lobster","address":"2 Bridge St","city":"Salem","stars":"2.5","text":"Worst service ever.

I have to go with 2 stars for the customer service, and would give it 1 star for service alone.  I have started timing the time I walk in the store until I get my food.  It averages 20-25 minutes.  20 minutes to get your food at a fast food restaurant?  Ridiculous.  The real frustrating part is the apathy by the staff.  I rarely have an employee apologize for the wait.  I went tonight and they had 6 people working - 1 on the register.  It was absolute chaos watching the people try to organize anything that resembled a workflow and it's not even clear who is managing the employees.  I always respect people and what they do for a living but please take some pride in your job.  Make an attempt to enjoy what you are doing and provide good service and you will have fun.  I saw 2 people walk in and leave today; they had been at the drive through and thought coming in would speed things up.  It's unreal.

I mean it's French food, right? Anyway... we had a larger party so we made a reservation. I would certainly recommend that. This being the case, we were able to be seated at once. The service was really nice...despite the server spilling water on one of our party (things happen). He was very attentive and we never went waiting for very long. If it were based on service alone, this would be 5stars. Unfortunately, the food left much to be desired. Like many of the other reviews I've read, I agree that there's just something missing. Mainly seasoning...we ordered the garlic mussels as an appetizer, I had the special (crepes w/Paris ham and Swiss cheese...others had the omelet natural, the eggs, the French toast, and many other things. The best part, hands down, was the croissant (I'd go back for that alone) and the bottle of sparkling ros√® (which happened to be 1/2 off YAY!!!).

My friend had one of the chimichanga's which is where my only complaint is. The chimichanga is LOADED with cilantro.
