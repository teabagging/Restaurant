Nicer restaurants are hard to find here, as the area is populated by penny-pinching students.\\n\\nI walked in for dinner, and was greeted warmly and seated by a very friendly waitress. The decor is very bright and modern - green, orange, with earthy wood tones - with rock music playing through the speakers. Mission Sushi and Wok describes itself as Asian fusion, which is to say its menu is a melange of dishes from many cultures (Korean bibimbap, pad thai, sushi, orange chicken, to name a few), though I'm not sure if a restaurant can call itself \\"fusion\\" no single menu item seemed to be inspired by more than one culture. I started off with some hot sake (whichever one was cheapest on the menu) and an order of crab rangoons. The crab rangoons, unfortunately, had no taste of crab at all, just cheese. Then I completed my meal with two orders of sushi, the \\"Double Salmon\\" roll (salmon in the middle and salmon on top) and the \\"Spider\\" roll (soft shell crab inside). Both rolls were merely average, and I probably could have gotten similar quality sushi for cheaper at Sushi Station nearby. All this, I enjoyed for $45 - I'll have to come back here to try the more affordable lunch menu!\\n\\nThe service here was better than the food, and I was checked on several times through my meal by my waitress. One oddity was that it seemed like the restaurant was over-staffed - there were 6 or 7 servers just standing around in this smallish restaurant, and it felt like they were watching me eat.

I really couldn't take more than a bite of each.  The motoyaki is also unpalatable.\\n\\nIf you are forced to come here, I would focus just on the teriyaki and the skewers.  They do a pretty decent job with the chicken teriyaki, the yakitori, and the beef skewers.  The jello was also pretty good.   I think as long as the ingredients are not too expensive, then the chefs are able to do a good job with it.  I have a feeling their tonkatsu will be pretty good.  \\n\\nyeah, its kinda funny, but this would be a good ayce if you just ordered their grilled and bbq stuff, and none of the seafood.  \\n\\nThe waitresses here are probably the prettiest that I've seen at a japanese ayce.

In all eight years of living in Portland, I have been to this bookstore six times and for the most part, I remain impressed. And to be frank, I'm more of a library guy than a bookstore guy.\\n\\nThere a wide selection of books and other reading materials go beyond as far as the eye can see. I love the store layout in which they have a different set of books based on the color theme of the room. They even have the Pearl Room in which they keep rare books for browsing, so do be careful while in this one.\\n\\nIn addition to browsing and buying books, they have a very organized lobby in which patrons can sell their used books and get either cash or Powell's credit for them. But like with buying a drink or getting into a club, be ready to show your ID for this activity.\\n\\nThe one thing I dislike about Powell's is that they only have one, just ONE, men's restroom in their whole establishment. This was a big inconvenience for me during my most recent trip there. I work at a retail store that is three times smaller than Powell's and yet we still manage to have two unisex bathrooms to keep our customer traffic satisfied. I'm surprised Powell's hasn't tried to get additional bathrooms, considering the massive crowds they get on a regular basis. Plus I was left with the impression that their bathrooms are frequently cleaned, which is good hygiene wise, but it's no fun to close your ONLY men's room just so you can give it a (hopefully) quick cleaning.\\n\\nBecause of its reputation, it's wide selection of quality reading materials, book buying, and the fact that it is a Portland landmark, I will keep coming here whenever I can. Especially when I have more used books to sell. Though, one quick tip I would suggest for all you would be Powell's customers is to go during the morning hours. That way, it is less crowded and you will have an easier time browsing their wide selections. Or better yet, finding that one book you've been dying to read."},{"name":"Hearth Pizzeria","address":"974 Great Plain Ave","city":"Needham","stars":"3.5","text":"Don't order from YELP/Eat 24.

I've ventured into Tony's Southern Comfort a couple of times recently and I really like the place.  The place isn't fancy but the food is gooood.   Fried food seems to be their speciality. The place is family run and this family definitely knows about food.  And don't worry, you will either leave stuffed or with a big takeout container.\\n\\nImmediately after my bottomless, sweet tea arrived;  a basket of jalapeno corn bread arrived that tasted great.\\n\\nI  had their Chicken Fried Steak which their menu describes as \\"Hand breaded and tenderized cube steak, deep fried and served with cream gravy totally Texas\\".  It is very good.   The batter seems to be lighter than most Chicken Fried Steak that I've had but I really like it.\\n\\nOn another visit, I had the Chicken & Waffles which also is handbreaded then deep fried  served with a golden Belgium waffle.    I never would have thought of serving these two items together but it was great.\\n\\nYou get a couple of sides with your entrees.  They change a little every day but usually consist of green beans, yams, mashed potatoes 'n gravy, mac & cheese. ...\\n\\nIf you can somehow make room then don't forget the desserts.  They always have a big selection of homemade pies and cakes. They have samples sitting up front so you can check them out  which makes it nearly impossible to resist.   I'd recommend the german chocolate cake or the pecan pie.\\n\\nHoover's is my other fav for southern food on the eastside. Hoover's is probably  more upscale/larger selection of food  but it is also $2-$3 more expensive for each entree than Tony's.  Tony's is definitely worth a few trips to check out."},{"name":"Sam LaGrassa's","address":"44 Province St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"A bustling lunch spot serving massive, fresh tasting sandwiches.\\n\\nI was staying just around the corner and located this gem while perusing reviews.

The noodles were overcooked as well. We were a bit upset that the ramen did not come with anything aside from one slice of pork, green onions, corn, and some bean sprouts. Getting toppings would be way too expensive if you are already paying a price point of $12 per bowl. \\nIn addition to ramen, we also ate their house salad. The house salad consisted mostly of iceberg lettuce with very little dressing, shredded chicken, and tofu. It was very expensive for $5...However, I thought that everything on the menu was significantly overpriced.

I had the horseradish encrusted salmon with dill butter sauce,  Roasted Chipotle Sweet potatoes, corn medley and buttered carrots. Carrots were amazing..corn.. well, who screws up corn? Sweet potatoes were very good however, they could have been a little more crispy. As for the salmon...the salmon itself was amazingly moist and flaky. The horseradish must have been for the crispy fried onion like texture, because it was flavorless.

The menu, organized as a pamphlet, consists of neat lists of various appetizers, stir fried entrees, curries, and noodles. Service is attentive and welcoming with multiple waiters checking in on us without any of them uncomfortably hovering.\\n\\nFor our lunch, we ordered pad kee mao with prawns and rama thai, a peanut sauce stir fry, with chicken, both at medium spicy. It did take some time for our food to be prepared, but they both came out steaming hot and looked positively amazing. Firstly, the portions were huge and well worth the price. Secondly, the smell wafting from each dish made both of our stomachs rumble in anticipation.\\n\\nWe absolutely loved the pad kee mao. The noodles were soft, without being mushy, and there were so many perfectly cooked prawns strewn throughout. At first, I thought medium spicy would pack just a little kick of heat. THIS WAS BY NO MEANS LITTLE. The spice coated our mouths in a delicious fiery blanket that was both painful and addicting.\\n\\nThe peanut sauce stir fry, on the other hand, soothed our fiery taste buds with a creamy and savory palate. The chicken was prepared as bite size pieces and cooked to tender perfection. We even loved the side of fluffy, fragrant rice that was served alongside it. By the time we finished both dishes, we were ready to surrender to the impending food coma hanging over our heads. \\n\\nThai Wok Kitchen certainly deserves its perfect Yelp rating.

They weren't as developed,  I remember the outdoor seating didn't have any covering at all, just picnic tables with logo umbrellas in the middle.  They have expanded and there are heaters over the tables outside--more sheltered against the weather.\\n\\nAs time passed by, the wait at Pok Pok gets more ridiculous.  Every time I drive by, there's always a long line of people.  This last time, we were aiming to have everyone come around 7pm and be seated by 8pm.  Living nearby, I went early at 6pm to put a name down.  Surprisingly, it wasn't busy and they had a table for me within 20 minutes.  Oops, well...my party isn't here yet and they couldn't \\"hold\\" it so they released our table.  Instead of putting me back on the bottom of the list, they told me to let them know when my whole party arrives.  Does that mean...you'll have a table for me? Or is that when you'll put me back on the list to wait for a table?  We ended up going over to Whiskey Soda Lounge to wait for the remainder of our party.  There was a confusion with the server if we were on the list or not for a table.  Even though they try to coordinate, its wasn't efficient.  However, it's nice to have a warm place to drink and wait.  When the last person showed up, we decided to walk back over and they sat us within five minutes.  We did end up having dinner around 8pm.  \\n\\nMust have are the Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings (6 pieces), used to priced under $10--I recalled my old roommate being outraged when it increased to $11.50 but now its $14.50, still worth it.  Also had the Papaya Pok Pok and Kaeng Hang Leh.  Green papaya salad is pretty self-explanatory, they do it the Laotian-style here where its a little more fish saucey and salty.  Hang Leh is a pork belly and shoulder meat that is braised in a curry of ginger, palm sugar, tumeric, and tamarind (reminiscent of Vietnamese Thit Kho).   Oh man, that pork belly is so tender and succulent.  That sauce goes amazingly over rice.  Yum.\\n\\nI used to be annoyed that they charge for rice at this establishment but I think that was because I was a poor student.  If you are modeling your restaurant with an Asian concept--most Asians charge for everything.  Rice is normally complimentary at restaurants but I'm seeing more places charge for it...understandable, grains cost money.  I paid $32.50 for a meal that filled me up and that's equivalent to most places I dine at."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The wings are a MUST!!

The room itself is quite small, water is served in plastic cups, and there are no physical menus besides the large one that is written on a chalkboard of one of the walls. What this place lacks in ambiance, it makes up for in its quality of food and an open kitchen where you can watch a beastly Vietnamese man cook famazing italian food! \\n\\nBetween the two of us, we opted for two appetizers and an entree to share. The shrimp scampi came out first, which had a true garlic kick, rounded off with loads of butter and parsley. My friend thought it was perfect, but I thought it was a tad under seasoned, but nothing a little salt couldn't fix. Save the bread that comes out to dip it into the sauce on this plate. A truly great bite.\\n\\nNext came out our clam's casino order, which was extremely hot, but super delicious. Crispy breadcrumbs with a great clam-to-breading ratio, there's not much more that I could ask for! \\n\\nFor our entree, we ordered the homemade squid ink pasta \\"aglio olio\\" aka served with ample amounts of ground calamari, olive oil, garlic and anchovies. The pasta is cooked perfectly aldente, so that there's still a nice bite to it. The flavors of the calamari, garlic and anchovies come together wonderfully with the olive oil to create a true hearty seafood bite. There's a little bit of a pleasant charred flavor, which I believe comes from the addition of some white wine that is squirted into the pan, before being set ablaze. The serving size is definitely enough for two people, and is presented directly in the pan that it is cooked in. \\n\\nOverall, we walked away feeling extremely full and content. We were seated by the window though and got to witness the extremely long line that formed shortly after we entered the restaurant, so I guess we made it there just in time to beat the rush.

Husband ordered the salmon and it was good. Not great, but good. I ordered just lobster bisque and a salad. The bisque looked like it had been in the soup cup for some time - well congealed before reheating and did not get heated through, and I did not care for it at all. The salad dressing options are Green Goddess or house balsomic. You better like one of those or you're out of luck. The waitress was either untrained or inept, but in either case, not helpful. When I told her I was looking for a lite meal and wanted her suggestions, she shrugged her shoulders. When my husband wanted a Guiness beer, again the shoulder shrug. Too bad, I guess...figure it out on your own...was the attitude. We paid the bill ($70 for salmon, 1 beer, lobster bisque that I didn't eat and sent back, and a side salad).

And for a diner, good pie is a must,.. and theirs is ok too.\\n\\nI've seen some poor reviews about service but that NEVER crossed my mind on any of my 3 visits,.. in fact I've found diners to be the best places often for old style service that I like.\\n\\nLastly, this place does have a very slight \\"hipster\\" vibe (in the good way), again like Save-on-Meats, but I'd say it is welcoming for all, even us gore-tex wearing, boring folks."},{"name":"The Nook On Piedmont Park","address":"1144 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Friends staying in Atlanta suggested visiting this restaurant.

Appetizer of lobster morsels under a pile of micro shoestring fries was good, but needed to be served hotter.  Waitstaff doesn't pick up plates from kitchen and it appears that kitchen brings out plates and then has to ask where it goes.  Not a good custom for a place where entrees run $20 to $50 not including sides.  On a very hot summer night ordered lemon chicken, which was nothing like menu description.  It was three inartful hacks off a whole roasted chicken that included mostly the butt end of the bird, with loads of inedible skin and gristle. Unseasoned and no evidence of lemon.  Asparagus was drowned at the bottom of the plate, and was tough and woody.  Garlic potatoes had not a hint of garlic.  It all needed more flavor and proper preparation (no salt & pepper on the table). Left most on the plate. Husband ordered fish, but got a different fish dish than he ordered. He had a bite of my chicken and said \\"ugh\\" and wondered why his dish was not as described, either. The wait for our food was extremely long and we were hamster hungry by the time it arrived; plates were hot but food was not. Waitress was pleasant; she did not deliver the plates and wasn't around for us to ask for anything; did correct price of fish after presenting the bill. The only thing she recommended all night was the duck egg creme br√ªl√©e, but we figured we'd already wasted enough time and money and would have fresh peaches and ice cream at home.  We were very disappointed in pretty much all aspects. The live music was a Jack Johnson type singer/guitarist. Children who wander around is annoying for a higher end place (please go to the myriad places with playscapes which we earnestly try to avoid). Maybe the more formal dining room would be a better choice for those who still choose to try this expensive and not worth it restaurant and the two hostesses should have used their brains to seat couples dressed for a nice evening away from the bar.

Every day they have a house made pasta, and you can sub out the fresh  house made for any pasta dish that has something else,  this dish was listed with spaghetti, but the house made was pappardelle, and I switched it out.

Then, as I peeked inside, I noticed the lush terrariums that lived on window sills and counter tops. The place just screamed life. I was standing in line ready to order from their epic menu ten minutes later.\\n\\nThe fare? Well, as mentioned, its as epic as it gets. If you're feeling adventurous, there's a meal for you. Rebellious? Foolish? Goddess like? They've got it all. Fresh veggies make up most of their bowls. They are usually tossed with a house made sauce and quinoa, udon noodles, or brown rice. They are not afraid to play with exotic flavors or textures here. Vegan fare is elevated to a sublime level by adding flavorful ingredients like shoyu, ginger sauces, and toasted almonds to the offerings. What's best is that these are all natural and simple ingredients, they just know how to do it right. Meals are offered in large bowls, which run around $10 and are a quite filling and well balanced meal. They also have wraps and demi bowls. Now, it seems smoothies and juices are a big deal here as most patrons in line rave about the smoothie flavors. I have not ordered one yet, but as the weather warms up, it's something im definitely looking forward to. \\n\\nA nice touch;  there's always a book at an arms reach.

Neil always greets his patrons with a smile and knows my mother by name and order, which I know she appreciates. His staff is quick and to-the-point, not a lot of small talk going on, which is okay because this place is typically slammed. \\n\\nIn terms of the food... #getinmybelly. I usually get an everything bagel with turkey, egg, and extra cheese. One reviewer commented that the eggs are microwaved - I think it's one of those turbo ovens, but either way, how else are they supposed to cook your breakfast without holding up the entire operation? If you want a griddle meal, hit up Depot Diner. That's their gig. Microwaved or not, I have never had an issue with the eggs, bagels, or cheese. The turkey is a TOUCH salty for my taste, but I still order it with abandon (I live on the edge, I know). They also have a ginormous menu board with lunch as well, but I've never tried it.\\n\\nPrices are very reasonable, which is good because it's cash only. I think the same disgruntled reviewer pointed out that they only take cash, but that's pretty standard operating procedure for locally-owned breakfast joints as far as I can tell. My old spot in Medford had the same set up and they've been around 30 years. It just means to come prepared.

They have essentially everything that you could possibly want for brunch. They have a table of delicious breakfast breads like cinnamon rolls, coffee cake, danishes, and a kick-ass bread pudding. I could eat those damn warm buttery soft, sticky cinnamon rolls all day. I kind of hate them for how good they were... But thats just one table at this thing. And when I was there, there were about 6 tables. They have all sorts of different eggs, scrambled ones, deviled, mashed up with other delicious things like hash browns and pesto and whatnot. Try the pesto eggs. They rock. They also have an amazing fruit salad bowl filled with berries and watermelon and other fruits that all kept their flavor and arent covered in sugary syrup or anything. Good old natural fruit. yum. \\n\\nThe best part of this buffet is that you can have everything under the sun and you can thoroughly enjoy it if you are vegetarian, carnivorous, omnivorous, whatever! My favorite part was when i was walking around with my jaw on the floor picking up random bits of food when an unsuspecting middle aged man looks at the table with assorted salads and says, \\"Salad is for quitters.\\" It made my hungover morning. \\n\\nOne complaint, GET A NEW BARTENDER. I would have given this place 5 stars had it not been for the terrible drinks!

Edgy menu design and the other visual/verbal touches you'll notice here are the sort of thing that gets on my nerves, especially in a place like the Gateway.  \\nBut, i do have to say that some of the food at Mad Mex is pretty good and that the semi-open patio area is a nice place to have lunch on a fair weather day.  \\nOf the three or four entrees i've tried here,  the tilapia tacos have been consistently the best. The guacamole is spicy and high quality.  Also, the habanero salsa is hot and sweet in a fruity way that's not found everywhere. The beef nacho is a pile of an appetizer with a generous amount of beef and cheese. The beef is seasoned saltily but has an appealing overall flavor. I tried their chickpea chili--which is mentioned all over the damned menu--and thought it pretty uninteresting. Sounded promising, and chickpeas certainly are a fine starting point for many recipes, but this was an underachieving bowl of stuff. \\nAs for the service, the first time i went there was the worst, and not because we had to wait too long for anything, but because of the distracted, unpleasant attitude of the waitress. To me, a server doesn't have to go out of the way to be too friendly--a forced cheeriness can be just as depressing--but he or she should at least smile a bit and be mentally present when dealing with the guest. This young woman of my first visit to Mad Max acted like somebody had just dropped in to tell her that her boyfriend had been seen necking with somebody else. Anyway, the next two visits i had more personable servers and it was a better experience. But again, those tilapia tacos were a nice enough surprise on the first visit that the frowny waitress couldn't scare me off. The prices are a bit high, so i don't eat here that often, but i understand they have some discounts for students. Beer prices (i had negra modelo) seemed a bit too high.

I really wanted to love this place, but I just can't. Although the food, for the most part, is ok, and the sushi is ok (not great), the service is a nightmare. I'll confirm the rediculous service in the bar. Two of us sat, with perhaps three other tables occupied at the time, and waited for twenty minutes for a waitress. I ordered their cheap house sake, because I refuse to pay the equivalent of $60/bottle for a shot of sake in a supposed sake pub (but that's another rant). So, it takes 30 minutes to get my warmed house sake, then another 20 minutes goes by before we are approached for our order. Then, while we wait 30 minutes for our food, we're asked to move to a crappy little table in the corner so a big, boisterous group of 12 can hog up the entire bar space. The rest of the experience was horrid - so freaking noisy that all hopes of a conversation with my companion was abandoned.\\nStill, what food we got, once we got it, was decent.\\nOn another occasion, having decided to give it one more shot, we sat in the restaurant section, and had a much better experience. Service was much better, but the food is, I'm afraid, mediocre (edible, but nothing that will raise an eyebrow - I had great hope for the ramen, but was, alas, dissapointed). And there's still the issue of the place claiming to be an izakaya, which, in principle is place where one primarily drinks, and maintains one's stamina with the occasional small plate. But if you're out to be drinking sake here (or most of the other \\"izakaya\\" in PDX), unless you're a member of the Trumph family, you can't afford it.

Arrived on a Saturday night 30 min before reservation. Were seated 10 min early to our delight. Once seated ordered app and a bottle of wine. Were told they were out of the bottle I ordered and a suggestion of a similar (and more expensive) bottle was made. I accepted the suggestion but when it arrived it was the brand but not the year I was told. I'm not a wine snob but if you are going to recommend a wine... have exactly what you recommend. Ordered the steak for two. It took an hour and 10 minutes to get to the table. That is not an exaggeration. I checked my watch and made a note of it. The waitress came to our table twice to apologize and to let us know it would be arriving soon.  When it arrived it was lukewarm at best as if it had been resting for quite some time. It was still very tasty however. Of course by the time we got the entree we had finished the wine since we had an hour to hover over it with only some bread. Didn't really want to buy another bottle at that point so didn't have wine with the actual meal. We were offered free deserts for the wait. Nice gesture but we came for the steak, paid $100 for the steak, and the steak was very disappointing. Having spent over $300 there for the evening a couple of $9 deserts didn't really make me feel any better about the experience. Will reconsider KR Steak as my go to steakhouse for special occasions. \\n\\n***Update***\\nSo out of pure coincidence I met Chef Kevin Rathbun two days after leaving the previous review. He was very gracious and concerned about my experience. He told me he personally wanted to make sure I had an superior return visit. A group of four went and had the steak for 3 plus the cowboy ribeye. Everything arrived promptly and was absolutely fantastic. The wine and service were also exactly what I have come to expect.

I told Dr. Ann I wasn't feeling very \\"Jesus-y\\". I was excited because her boyfriend who we'll call \\"Ashford\\" (incidentally his real name, but he doesn't go by it, so now it's his pseudonym) was in town from New Orleans. He's super sweet to Dr. Ann and is clever enough to harass/tease me without sounding like a jackass. Since they're both from NOLA, they're the types where neither one of them bats an eye when discussing boiling 230 lbs. of crawfish. While tapping a keg. At a baby shower.\\n\\nRunning late and not even showered, I received a text from Ashford that read \\"I hereby request brunch be moved by half hour to accommodate morning sex for which we woke too late. Yelp that, queen!\\" I completely understood. \\n\\nWhen I pulled up to Moonshine I was greeted by the polite valet guy. I asked the very sweet outside hostess about the wait, and she said 30-45 minutes; she would give me a buzzer when the other two arrived, but she would put my name on the list. Kudos to this girl. She was professional, courteous, and welcoming. When Dr. Ann asked what the brunch hours were, she explained they stop taking reservations at 2:30, and smiled and said we were fine and not to worry because we'd be fed. MUCH nicer than the distracted ice queens over at Paggi House with an eye-rolling problem.\\n\\nI sat on a rocking chair outside on the patio. I noted the historical marker out front. Lovely venue. I also noted that when I'm in conversation with my friends, I KNOW we're not half as irritating as 90% of the crowd. For example: \\"OMG, your name is Sergio? Do people call you SERG??? When I'm wasted I call guys SERG, because I can't pronounce it! Hey, SERG! Hehehehe!\\" Uggghhh.\\n\\nWe headed to the patio bar for a couple rounds of Bloody Marys which were mixed well. I enjoyed the outside bar, and there were a few tables in there that looked like it provided for a very intimate ambiance, if that was your preference. We caught up with each other and people watched. Ashford was taken aback I was wearing shorts and sandals, but in my defense it was supposed to be hot that day. Straight boys need to know what they can and can not criticize me on, and fashion is a major no-no. But he bought me drinks, so I forgave him. Now when he made fun of a girl who obviously couldn't pull off a fedora, that's quite acceptable.\\n\\nWe were seated inside by another smiling hostess, and our waiter was VERY friendly. He happily explained the menu and made conversation as he filled our mason jars with ice water. Both Dr. Ann and Ashford said he was hitting on me. I kind of got that vibe, too, and I love waiters like that. And yeah, he was cute.\\n\\nThe best part about the first table were the chicken tenders and chicken fried steak tenders with chipotle cream gravy. The green chile cheese grits with hatch green chiles were just...ok. Certainly nothing like the bleu cheese grits at Paggi House (I swear, with God as my witness, I will not rest until I try every flavor of grits in this city.) The broccoli and cheese casserole was delicious, but the buttermilk biscuits were a little smaller than I expected. King Ranch chicken was memorable (but not nearly as good as Mom's). Both Dr. Ann and Ashford loved their eggs-in-a-basket, however the deviled eggs could have been a bit more flavorful. As for the assorted egg dishes, I liked the vegetable omelette, even though it was served  in a dish, and  was not a made-to-order. The green eggs with pesto were just OK, as was their tamale-chorizo scramble. However, I fell in love with the smoked salmon spread that tasted just as good as the one Jen L. would always have in her apartment in Boston. I decided from then on, I would eat only chicken fried steak tenders and salmon spread. It was that good.\\n\\nWhile I always skip the carb table, I had small samples of the apple danish, the blueberry muffin, and the banana nut bread. If you had to choose one, go with the banana nut bread, although, once again, nothing beats Mom's homemade version.\\n\\nAs we dined, Ashford and Dr. Ann pointed out to me the unusual prevalence of people wearing awful-looking hats (like the chick from outside) and/or 5\\" hooker heels. On a Sunday morning? With those pants? Why? Dr. Ann said the clientele looked just a *tad* silly because of it, but not abominable. Just a note: if a hat doesn't automatically look awesome on you (as they do on Dr. Ann), avoid it. Don't make excuses, or hope for the best, just...avoid them.  \\n\\nIn summary, Moonshine serves warm, unpretentious comfort food in a charming historical building with a friendly staff. I left quite satisfied. Is it as fancy as other brunches? No, but that's just fine for some occasions. Would I return? Absolutely. \\n\\n3 1/2 stars, rounded to 4, because of the hostess.

Tried this place a third time. I keep wanting to like it but I always leave feeling a little disappointed either with the food, the service, or both. Not to mention every time I walk in there the front of the restaurant smells like cleaner.\\n\\nThe first time I went with my friend, I ordered a boba (bubble tea) when it was still on the menu. They only had popping pearls, no tapioca pearls, which is the mainstay add-on to boba. I tried to do the popping pearls, but they were just way too sweet for me. They also charged extra for substituting smoked salmon for fresh salmon on my roll. That made no sense to me. The server was great though and gave us a discount for the boba not being what I expected.\\n\\nThe second time we went, I ordered a basic salmon roll. Can't really mess that up. It wasn't anything exciting. I just wanted sushi. Definitely overpriced for what it was. \\n\\nThird time we went, the table we sat at had pieces of dried rice on it. When the server came up she saw me trying to brush them off the table. No offer to help or apology for the mess. Just laughed and watched as I attempted to clean my own table before even getting to sit down. Should've just got up and left at that point but we were hungry, I wanted sushi, and I didn't know any other sushi joints nearby. I ordered the lava roll and sushi fries. The fries tasted great but there was a severe lack of scallions and masago topping those fries. $9.50 for fries. I don't understand why they would skimp on scallions.I saw maybe 3 small pieces buried in the good chunk of krab covering the fries and maybe a quarter of a teaspoon of masago on top. The lava roll was overcooked. Stars next to rolls on their menu indicate there is raw fish in the roll. The lava roll has a star next to it. The only fish in the roll is salmon. The menu states the roll is baked, but I assumed the salmon would still be raw, or at least undercooked, or why else would there be a star next to it? When the server came by to ask how things were I pointed out to her that the fish was not raw. She looked at me like she was uncomfortable and seemed very reluctant but asked if I'd like to switch to something else. No suggestions, no apology, no understanding smile. She really looked like she just wanted to leave. She then explained to me that the roll was baked and that the salmon was only partially cooked, like she was trying to convince me the roll was fine even though I was clearly unhappy with it. I really wanted to believe her but cooked fish tastes like cooked fish. My friend sitting across from me took one look and agreed the fish was fully cooked. I don't think they could have partially cooked that salmon even if they had wanted to. The slices atop the roll were so incredibly thin, a hair dryer could've had it fully cooked. My friend ordered a bento box. I tried the noodles and kimchi. The kimchi was mediocre at best and the noodles were tasteless. I usually love tempura and normally I would steal one off my friend's plate, but these looked like the batter used to coat them was thick and heavy (not light, fluffy and crispy like tempura ought to be). \\n\\nOverall, this seems like an extremely white washed attempt at sushi. Paired with the terrible service experience at our last visit and the expensive prices, next time I'll just make my own rolls at home."},{"name":"Bistro du Midi","address":"272 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I did not know that a new restaurant had opened in this spot and walked in Wednesday with a friend.

The food is great and the ambiance is lovely, but the service absolutely blew me away.\\n\\nMy previous experiences eating at True Food involved to-go orders. While the food here isn't exactly cheap, I was pleased with the portions and the thoughtfulness around ingredients and flavor. I'm a pretty picky eater but I loved the asian fusion noodle bowls and all the vegetables that were included.\\n\\nLast night, I went to True Food for my first sit-down meal with a friend. It was a bit crowded but we were immediately seated. We waited about 7-10 minutes and nobody came by to take our drink orders/introduce themselves. We really wanted some water, so we flagged a passing server to let him know. He was bringing some plates back to the kitchen but immediately stopped what he was doing to apologize for the delay and take our orders. He let us know that our appetizer would be comped, which we really appreciated. But if that wasn't good enough, the manager came by shortly after to further apologize and make sure we were taken care of. We weren't even that fussed by the minor delay but were blown away by the way they made things right.\\n\\nMoving on to the food - we had the roasted brussels sprouts appetizer and (because my friend is vegan) the butternut squash pizza. I liked the brussels sprouts - there were so many that we couldn't even finish them and they had a really strong flavor. I would say they're definitely not as good as the ones at Uchi, but that's a really high bar so I'd still recommend the True Food ones. I *loooove* cheese so I was hesitant to get a vegan pizza but the almond ricotta was creamy, tasty, and if I hadn't read the menu I wouldn't have known it was vegan. Every bite was so good (amazing amounts of garlic and carmelized onion) and seeing how I'm not a big fan of squash it actually worked really well to add a sweeter element. There were dried cranberries as well - found that a little weird but I didn't notice them so obviously they worked with the rest of the ingredients. I think there was a little too much crust but I was able to spread the ricotta over it to add some flavor and it was fine. The server also brought us some really fresh shredded parmesan so I could have some real cheese.\\n\\nAfter our delicious meal, our server came back to let us know that forget the appetizer - our *entire* meal would be comped. All because we had to wait a bit to get served. I've had so many worse things happen at other establishments and nothing done about those incidents... my friend and I were both blushing because we were so amazed by the service and almost felt like it was overkill.

Desserts and sandwiches are offered, but none are prepared on site, so they tend to be expensive and just off fresh baked.  If you want a sandwich wrapped tightly in plastic that makes good ingredients taste like bus station fare, this is where you can get it.

I do like the california rolls and I like that  they have real crab in them if you want to pay more.( I have had lots of people tell me that California rolls aren't real sushi, but I still love them.)\\n\\n  Another feature I like is all the different seating options from traditional Japanese seating to slightly altered to just regular American seating. The service is usually good, but sometimes can be slow. Most of the servers are very friendly and helpful, but there are a few that aren't.

The Chicken kabob I think is the traditional ground chicken mixed with spices and then reformed on skewers. It almost tastes like they might have mixed it with breadcrumbs.  It put me in mind of a meatloaf taste. So the order for the chicken consisted of 3 skewers of chicken and one piece of pita/nan and some pieces of lettuce and tomatoes.  Not a whole salad as described, but more like enough greenery to make a sandwich out of the Kabob. This is the second place I have been a patron of that the american concept of salad is not consistent. I should nicely like to suggest  that he should change his description to kabob served with lettuce, tomato, etc.  Not list it as a salad. This could confuse patrons in thinking they are going to get a whole huge plate of lettuce or a side salad with the works w/dressing etc. The kabob was good.

I left a pretty snarky review on here, and now I'm feeling pretty horrible about doing that.\\n\\nThis week I was contacted by Sue from CC and asked to give them another go, on their dime this time (a very kind gesture). I didn't feel comfortable going and being catered to for free, so I just returned unannounced and anonymously (not as a trap or anything to CC, but just to have a comfortable dining experience). \\n\\nI have to say, this experience was quite the opposite. I was promptly seated, tended to, and served. The wait staff was attentive and pleasant. I ordered the burrito again, which came out piping hot... it was delicious. I'm not a food critic and not the greatest with words....suffice it to say, it was damn good. I'm not vegan, but could be convinced by meals like this.\\n\\nI'm guessing my first experience was just a fluke...\\n\\nSo... I really loved CC this time.

When my parents came into town, I thought what better place than this to have them pay for a meal? \\n\\nThe major complaint from the group was how dark it was inside. We could barely see each other! I understand for many patrons, not being able to make out your tablemate could be a positive. But, my dad couldn't even make out the words on the menu. They must know of this issue because when our waitress greeted us, she promptly whipped out a little flashlight she had. Handy, but shouldn't be necessary at such a nice place.\\n\\nWe ordered drinks, and my dad said the red he had was probably the best red wine he's ever had. I must give it up to the sommelier (do they have one?) for such a great wine list!\\n\\nMy bf and I the spinach salad with bacon dressing that we had last time. I remember it being much better...light, but a perfect prep for steak. This time it felt slimy and fatty to me. I probably would not order again. My parents split a caesar that they both enjoyed. I really like that they are willing to split menu items onto different plates for their guests; the salads end up being the perfect size for one. \\n\\nThen came the main event: STEAK. All at once several staffers swooped into our table to take away our salad plates, replace with clean plates, and set down our steaks. I was impressed with how orchestrated those few moments seemed. \\n\\nMy bf and I repeated the same steak we had last time, the dry-aged steak for two. The server immediately asked if the steak was done well enough (we had asked for medium rare). We couldn't really see since it was so dark, but who sends back steak at Kevin Rathbun Steak? We soon learned that our steak was definitely underdone, almost to the point where I couldn't enjoy it. That was a sad day in my steak-eating experience.\\n\\nEveryone at the table ordered some sides. The biggest disappointment was the scalloped sweet potatoes, which my stepmother said she couldn't taste any sweet potato at all; only cheese. She even asked me to taste it to make sure. We also ordered the mac and cheese and mashed potatoes, which were both just fine. \\n\\nDessert was the major bread-winner of the evening. My bf and I shared the baked alaska, which was probably the most amazing desert I've ever had at any restaurant. You must order it. It was like heaven on a plate; mint ice cream with chocolate cookie, covered in whipped cream that has been browned over, accompanied by some chocolate sauce. Holy mother of all things sweet- this dessert was on point.  My parents were very unimpressed with their tres leches cake, but I think they didn't really understand what they were getting so I chalk that up to inexperience.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, Kevin Rathbun Steak dropped ranks in my mind. They used to be #1, soaring over all other restaurants in the ATL. Now they are just one of the many great places here. The food is absolutely delicious and the service in phenomenal. I will still recommend to anyone looking for a nice date out.

HE LOVED IT and he was all smiles the rest of the day. (Now every time we go to a restaurant he wants a root beer float lol.) The desserts were odd too. My brother got a mud pie which was bigger than we expected, I got those chocolate stick things which were kinda boring for a dessert so I was a bit let down by it and offered the rest to my family lol.

The person working on the register does not seem to know what she is doing.  I have also noticed her manager was standing besides her and keeps nagging her about her work.  The cashier fired back to her manager as well.  It makes customers very uncomfortable standing on line.  After we ordered our mean, the line starts to grow and it's not because there are so many customer, it is because they are so effing slow.  After several months of opening, I would expect they have trained their employees.  But that's not the case.\\n\\nSecond, I was not too impressed with burger.  I ordered Quesarino burger and expecting to have some kick to it, since it supposes to contain jalapeno.  When I bite into it, I could not feel anything about jalapeno or heat.  It was extremely blend.  Maybe I should different burger IF I go there again.\\n\\nThird, the fries were not that great.  It seems to be cold and tough to eat.  I don't know if they just fried or it came from microwave.\\n\\nFourth, the price seems to be on higher side for the food and service they provide.\\n\\nI know they tried to be like Five Guys, but they seems to be in same league as Burger King.

This is why I took one star off. A sandwich with one side and a soda plus taxes will surely exceed $20 dollars (Without including tips and/or extra toppings). So, if you add cheese, bacon, coleslaw, extra meat, it can be a really expensive sandwich for this kind of shop.

Not much in the way of meat here.  A few options at the very bottom which was a bit disappointing, but not a huge deal.\\n\\nWe started with an Antipasto.  Lots of meats, olives and some cheese (wish there had been some fresh mozzarella on the plate, but sadly there wasn't) arrived at our table along with a basket of amazing bread that I couldn't stop eating.  I really really like bread and this was no exception.  We also ordered some wine.  A nice Chianti that my dad actually enjoyed.  He is more of a sweet wine/dessert wine kind of guy.\\n\\nFor my main dish I had the house-made Pappardelle with Wild Boar meat sauce.  This was very good.  If they take the time to make the pasta, I will take my time to eat the pasta.  This was the only house-made pasta on the menu and you can actually substitute it for any of the pasta dishes on the menu for an additional $2.  It is worth it.  My dish was $16.50.  I imagine it would have been $2 less with another type of pasta.\\n\\nFor dessert we had the Profiteroles, dad had a coffee and I had a Cafe Erros (I think that is how it is spelled) which was chocolate syrup at the bottom, espresso in the middle and steamed milk foam at the top.  3 layers of amazingness.  Not a word, I know.\\n\\nA side note.  There is an accordion player on Sunday nights.  That brought a nice vibe to the place.

Sat down ordered drinks Old Fashion was about the best one I have ever had then downhill we go. Ordered food appetizer was  green onion dip with house made warm chips. Dip was good but chips where soggy. I ordered Shrimp and Grits with a side of red beans and rice and special of the day fried Okra. My friend got the special of the day was stuffed pork chop which turned out to be better then my food. First off the Fried Okra was great we each had an order of it and finished all of it. My shrimp and grits was a big bummer. The shrimp had that old not so fresh taste to them and the grits where like eating sand. They plated it all together so that the greens with all the juice made the food cold almost as soon as it got to me. The red beans and rice had zero flavor like it had not been seasoned at all. Over all the restaurant  had some good points but the main course was so bad that ruined everything else about the place.

As most of you i followed my yelpers to lead me into food coma bliss, this time, im not too sure what happened. Perhaps the expectations were to high or maybe i just wanted some real deal Peruvian damn it! When i placed my order the first thing i asked if the chicha morada was in house made, and i believed. The one i recieved did not taste homemade, it actually tasted a lot like the bottled one they sell, well how odd. For 10$ bucks.... Well most of you can imagine how i feel. Second, and most important reason why i so badly wanted to try this place was for those delicious picarones i kept seeing in all the reviews. wow! That was the most dissappointed deep fried fritter being costumed as a picaron. Smh. If anyone here is really from Peru, you will know right away (just as the chicha morada) that these are no where near to the original thing. The real ones taste of delicious yam flour drowned in an Anise and Fig sauce. These tasted like mapled syrup drowned zepollis wanna bees. The sadder part is prob me being so excited that i ordered 12. Yes, 12. Dont.. Judge me. On to the main course, we ordered, arroz chaufa con pollo, lomo saltado a lo pobre, churrasco de corazon which actually tasted like liver and looked like liver with a lot of pepper, the canned mote was good, i guess. The jalea which my hubby said i lied to him because it wasnt as light and crunchy as i described it... I thought it was ok. The dishes were ok, not great and well some were just full of lies. Overall, i will not be spending my money here as i had hoped for, but i will keep on my search for some good ole Peruvian cuisine as authentic as possible, or for the money i keep spending on these places i could buy myself a plane ticket and travel there myself and actually eat Peruvian in Peru.

Perhaps i might be too hard on them, but if you're gonna attempt to recreate some of the dishes you had in Thailand at least try to make it taste like something you've eaten there.  \\n\\nI'm not Thai nor Laos, but 99% of my friends are & we all can say that their food isn't seasoned right.  The laap and payaya salad didn't have much taste to it, its pretty bland and if it was done right its usually a burst of spice and favors with each bite.  In the payaya, i literally taste more of the tomato than anything else.  As for the Laap, let me just say it was a HUGE disappointed.  \\n\\nI don't know if their recipes was changed to cater to Westerners because i notice none of their dishes had Bo Dac sauce in it and you can tell if it had it based on the \\"aroma.\\"  I seriously doubt most ppl can handle the fact that majority of Thai/Laos recipes are made with Bo Dac sauce, which is basically the liquid from raw chopped up fish (blood, guts and all) soaked in salt that is fermented for months in a tub or whatever container you have.  The sauce from this fermented raw fish is then used in most of their dishes, including the papaya and laap.  The stench of it is very potent and is not for the weak.  A teaspoon of the stuff can cause one to react violently.  I should know because that was my reaction when i had a whiff of it.  However, over the years i have overcome the aroma and had the opportunity to make it right from scratch...lucky me!  However, i still do not have the courage to stare into the container without worrying that a fish head or two will stare back at me!  Nothing you buy at the store can match the taste/smell of true authentic Bo Dac sauce!  Trust me on this!!!\\n\\nNow, i'm Vietnamese and the buffalo wings does not taste like anything i've eaten.  I find it insulting when ppl use fish sauce and thinks that because they do its considered authentic.  Vietnamese people don't usually eat SWEET wings and those wings were extremely sweet, an insult to my culture.  \\n\\nThe only thing i can say that they did right is the sticky rice, but seriously how hard is it to steam rice????!\\n\\nIf you want AUTHENTIC, don't go here!

The owner has set up a system where he personally takes any and all tips that are give on a credit or debit card (ie a majority of the tips). This is illegal and, in my opinion, unethical (tips cannot go to either managers or owners) and I'm sure that customers are not intending their tips to go to him but to either the service or kitchen staff to thank them for their work. Otherwise, aren't they just paying more for their food?\\n\\nI approached him about this issue tonight, standing up for myself and fellow employees, and was summarily shot down. It is with a heavy heart that I write this, as Basta Pasta is great and all of the employees are exceptional, but I'm hoping anyone giving a tip will know to -only- leave cash if they would like to thank the staff, rather than the owner (who is often not even there) or to reconsider giving their business to someone who operates in such a deceitful way.  I also hope that  future staff will receive the fruits of their labor and that the owner will realize how unethical it is to skim their very meager earnings. Anyone who has ever worked in hospitality knows that the dollar or two that someone may generously tip for takeout adds up and makes all the difference with regards to your quality of life. Why anyone would feel obliged and happy to take this is beyond me- something sinister is going on beneath the often gregarious show that the owner puts on for customers. To make matters worse, it is clear that it is not out of necessity as the owner is often boasting about his 55\\" 3-D tvs and luxury trips abroad to St. Barts and the like; this is fine, someone running a successful business should certainly enjoy their profits, but at the same time- why treat your employees, who are simply trying to make ends meet, so callously? \\n\\nI know that tips can be a contentious and often confusing issue, but one thing is generally clear- if you are tipping for service, that tip should (as you intend) go to the staff, whether you decide to do so through cash or credit. When someone in a position of power decides arbitrarily that he deserves those tips and can horde them since usually those in his employ are too scared or poor to say anything, it is everyone else that suffers: the staff, who are not making a living wage, and the customer, who is paying 20% or so more for his dish for no discernible reason. I'm lucky in that I have other employment opportunities, but whoever replaces me may not be so fortunate. \\n\\nIf you want to live in a community that does not exploit those lowest on the totem pole, please reconsider giving your business to and supporting these sorts of practices.

This is my favorite restaurant in Portland and I fall in love each and every time I visit.  \\n\\nDon't be discouraged by the long line that sometimes has a wait up to three hours on a Saturday!  (Yes, three hours!)  Just plan to get drinks and a bite from somewhere nearby after putting your name down on the waitlist where they'll text you once your table is ready.  And to shorten the wait, let the staff know you're down to sit at the counter if you're not particular.  But it's worth the wait, I promise. \\n\\nI first learned about owner, Andy Ricker when he was featured on Anthony Bourdain's Parts Unknown, learning that he lived in Thailand, where he studied the cuisine from all around the country.  At his establishments he specializes in northern Thai food, which just so happens to be one of my favorite cuisines.  I first visited Pok Pok after visiting my boyfriend's aunt who's a PDX native and she swore by the place.  She was right.  It was love at first bite.  And now every time I visit PDX, I always make a plan to eat at Pok Pok. \\n\\nNow that my bestie lives in Portland, I came here more recently when I was visiting last weekend.  Since we arrived at 5PM, we didn't have a problem getting two counter seats where we drank Thai beers and shared the Pork Belly Curry and Ike's Chicken Wings.  But seriously.  EVERYTHING HERE IS AMAZING.  You cannot go wrong with whatever you order.  Although you should know, Ike's Chicken Wings are special in every sense of the word and meaning and you really should get this, in addition to whatever else floats your boat. \\n\\nIke's Chicken Wings are amazingly flavored in fish sauce, has that perfect crispy texture, and has that complementary balance of sweet and salty.  Oh my goodness, get on this!  The chicken wings are also whole, so you'll have to tear off the parts of wing and drumstick, but I think keeping it together really helps savor in the flavor as it's prepared.  I'm not normally a person who likes their wings seasoned in glaze or has a sweetness to it, but it exceeds my expectations here.  I love the Ike's Chicken Wings and it is a must if you visit any Ricker establishment.  \\n\\nThis particular Pok Pok location is located in the SE Portland neighborhood, so is walkable to many other restaurants, including Ricker's Whiskey Soda Lounge.  Like I said, get your name on the waitlist and don't call it quits just 'cause there's a long line.  Just make your way somewhere nearby and know that patience is a virtue and Ike's Chicken Wings will make you a very fat yet happy person.

Last night was an amazing treat. It was like waiting outside in Thailand at any open air joint with the friendly pieced together decor. Except that it was Portland and it was 37 degrees out! PP does credit by keeping everyone warm via incredible propane heat lamps or incredible drinks. \\n\\nFood is amazing, most things on the menu. Even if you're not a salad eater Pok can Talk you into it. Albeit they've contradicted the salad with famous Thai Beef Salad, and a Duck Confit that's a reason to live. \\n\\nThe downside? Eating in a Northern Thai joint transplanted to Portland is expensive. $8 drinks are the new deal, followed by family style items that often don't live up to their shareable names. Some of the menu items like the Spicy Fish Sauce (amazing) Wings are good for 2 - 3 people. More spendy deliciousness like the Catfish comes in a portion size smaller than you'd get at a Pho spot. It's all incredibly well done, all tasty, and all worth it, but be prepared to drop more cash. More than you'd expect maybe, I rarely talk about price because the food around here is worth it.  At Pok Pok you're going to put more bills on the table than you would somewhere like Nostrana, Toro Bravo, or let alone an average Thai place. That's why you're here though, you're searching for something beyond average and Pok Pok delivers. Some of the staples they opened with like the Game Hen and sticky rice are still under $10, but not many of the items on the menu are serving the lunch cart crowd anymore. Done right, Pok Pok is true Northern Thai and tastes better than anything you might find in Thailand because it's infused with our local produce and meats. It really is a great place, and they're not asking something so outlandish from you it can't be enjoyed. \\n\\nAll in all, it's unique, worth it, healthy, spontaneous, and a journey of food and drink."},{"name":"Sushi Sakura","address":"506 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Horrible Food.

We ordered Corned beef hash Benedict and caramel stuffed waffles with caramelized bananas and pecans. The corn beef Benedict was delicious, however, the waffles had extra caramel sauce which made them extra sweet. The cappuccino I got was was actually a latte and not made properly.

I whipped out Yelp to see what else was good and saw hundreds of reviews for this place called The Daily Catch. \\n\\nAt a first glance, the restaurant isn't much to look at. It's probably the definition of \\"hole in the wall\\". There are maybe enough seats for 15-20 people. Although it was already 1:30 pm, the restaurant was full, and we ended up having to wait about 15 minutes. As one diner walked out, he said to us, \\"you don't come here for the atmosphere, but the food is amazing!\\" We were seated at a table for two which wasn't really a table - it was sort of a tile platform jutting out from the wall. I had to sit sideways since there was no legroom underneath, so at that point, I was thinking, \\"this better be good\\".\\n\\nTwo other things also caught my eye. A lot of diners were eating different variations of this black looking pasta and I'd never seen anything like it before. Also, the kitchen is completely exposed to diners. There was one chef churning out orders like mad, moving rapidly from oven to stove to plating. I'd occasionally see a flame flare up out of the corner of my eye. This guy was definitely impressive. I also found it interesting that he was a middle-aged Asian man cooking Italian food...I guess pasta and noodles might have a common origin after all!\\n\\nAt the waiter's recommendation, we ordered the clams casino to start. It was a wonderfully rich dish of baked clams topped with crispy bread crumbs. I've never had juicier and more fresh clams. For the main course, we had two types of their famous squid ink pasta (the black pasta I saw people eating earlier). One version was puttanesca style, with olive and anchovy butter, mushrooms, onions and capers. Just delicious if you like more sour flavors. The other was the aglio olio style, with ground squid sauteed with olive oil and garlic. Mmmm...\\n\\nVerdict: food is really memorable and unique Italian cuisine, restaurant is really adorable and cozy\\n\\nTip: this place gets packed, go during an off-peak time. Even as I was leaving, a huge wait started to build up again.

The menu was singularly unimpressive. Neither of us wanted breakfast, and that was all we saw on the menu. The prices we saw were high. We left, without ordering, and went to Mother's.

I'm sure that's the equivalent, in my world, of spaghetti and meatballs and chicken alfredo (which doesn't actually exist in Italy).  But Pok Pok, thank you for opening my eyes to a breadth of genuine flavors and dishes from this delicious country!  If this is what it really is, sign me up!\\n\\nHowever, I am still, very clearly, a complete novice and therefore do not pretend to understand the complexities of this cuisine.  Thus, my commentary will be, probably to the relief of some, limited.  :)  I'll do the best I can, but hopefully the pictures of this beautiful food will be enough to make your mouth water.\\n\\nI think this first one was my fave.  Prawns and pork belly baked in clay pot with bean thread noodles and a bunch of other delicious salty stuff.

Nah... it was worth it.\\n \\nThe Vietnamese fish sauce chicken wings are a house specialty.  Marinated in a fish sauce concoction, deep fried then tossed in said fish sauce concoction with garlic.  Um, ok.  I'd take these at a bar with a beer any day.\\n \\nCharcoal grilled prawns with a spicy lime/garlic/cilantro root dipping sauce.  I managed to miss tasting this one but wasn't disappointed about it.  If I had to miss one, this was it because it was the most understandable to me.  I like to get my hands in the weird stuff.\\n \\nWeird stuff like this: grilled boar collar meat.  Marinated and sauced.  Served with chilled mustard greens that were to be used as a chaser.  I'm not exactly sure what the whole concept is there.  I guess I could see it if it were more spicy but it wasn't super hot.  Maybe it's just tradition?  Regardless, the meat was wonderful.\\n \\nSauteed water spinach with garlic.  I always go for the greens.  They were simple, fresh and light.  Nothin' too special... just good, yummy greens.\\n \\nBean thread noodles' competition:  Braised pork shoulder and belly curry with a bunch of crazy stuff like tamarind, palm sugar, turmeric, Burmese curry powder (whatever that is) and pickled garlic.  It was suggested that we eat this one with coconut rice (unpictured).  Good suggestion.\\n \\nClearly the place is very casual.  Here's the specials board.  Notice the 'drinking vinegars' in the bottom left corner.  They're mixed into some wonderfully interesting cocktails.  They also have a massive list of whiskeys.  Thailand, I think you and I are going to get along just fine...\\n \\nApparently the place started as just a little shack with very few menu items, including the rotisserie chicken.  It's been expanding little by little.  There's lots of cool, sectioned patio spaces in which to eat and drink.  The indoor space is teensy... like, I could have rested my head on the lady sitting at the table behind me.\\n \\nAs for the service, it was pretty slow.  It seemed like the staff was so laid back (maybe that's just a Portland thing) and they all know that they have such a great reputation that everyone will just wait.  And we did.  Our server was very knowledgable and quite helpful, though.  We couldn't have done it without him.  Plus, he's the one that suggested the bean thread noodles so he's good in my book!\\n \\nThe Short Version (Out of 10)...\\nFood:  9\\nService:  7\\nAmbiance:  8\\nOverall impression:  9\\nWould I go back?\\nFor sure!

It may be that simple, but it was freaking delicious. You know the scene from Eat Pray Love where Julia Roberts slurps the spaghetti in Italy? That is how I felt trying the spaghetti here, I wanted to eat like no one was watching, i wanted to pick up the plate and lick off the sauce.  The ingredients were fresh, everything was seasoned perfectly.  The waitstaff was mellow and attentive without begin pushy- I had a long lunch with a few girlfriends and were never once rushed to leave.  Piazza Italia may seem like a fancy joint by the location, but once you go inside it is a family place at heart.  If you go at the right time you can see the staff enjoying their meal together while watching f√∫tbol on the screens.\\n\\nWhat really put this place into the 5 star category for me was the coffee dessert drinks.  It truly completes the meal, from the chocolately but not overly sweet eros to the rich and delicious affogato- try either one of these, and you can thank me later.\\n\\nThis place was so great  I didn't hesitate to come back again the weekend after.

Why is it that everyone around us had their water poured for them throughout their dinners but I poured my water for myself the entire dinner at least 3 times? Please management help me answer these questions.\\n\\nQuite honestly this place is lucky to be getting a 2 from me. They make good clam chowder. The mackerel tartare was tasty, not fishy, and the lobster roe noodles were yummy but too greasy and the short rib lacked flavor. My favorite was the Boston cream pie which they do an interesting twist with. It's like a fluffy moist cake dipped in chocolate.

It's fun as a gimmick maybe once or twice but after a few times the fun wears off.  Unless you come very early or very late, the wait to get a table is pretty interminable.  Part of that is probably due to the popularity of the place but a great deal has to do with the inefficiency of the staff.  First of why does it take forever for the staff to clear a table so that the next party can eat?  Are there not enough financial incentives to get more seatings in?  I saw a manager-type, walk in and surveyed the scene, and quickly walk out again despite the fact there were tables needing to be cleared.  The front of house people, other than telling you your wait time and displaying post-modern ennui, seem to have no other purpose.  Thank goodness there is a pod of food carts nearby so you can sate your hunger while you wait.\\n\\nSecondly, yes there are menu items, but most people are here to do the DIY pancake thing.  Why does it take forever for the waitress to first take your order and then to bring your bottles of pancake batter?  Are they growing the wheat in their back yard, harvesting it, milling it and then mixing it with the eggs they have to get from their own free-range chickens roaming on the roof and the milk they get from their GMO-free cows in their barn every time you order a bottle of batter?  \\n\\nAnd what is this controlling attitude with the oil?  After a few pancakes, the griddle is sticky and crusted.  But the bottles of oil are nowhere to be found.  And of course it takes another eternity to flag down a server to squirt some more oil on the griddle.  \\n\\nMost of the attraction of this place is for the kids.  There are a *lot* of small children at this place.  But if you really think about it, would you really let your small children stand by an open stove at home flipping pancake?  You probably wouldn't let them close to the range.  So why is it OK to subject them to the same risks and pay someone else to do so?\\n\\nMy hat off to the owners though.

I thought $14 was pretty steep for a burger, but it sounded so wonderful that I had to try it.\\n\\nIn spite of all the wonderful-sounding additions, my burger was bland...bland...bland.  I could not even taste anything special about the lemon aioli.  I could easily have mistaken it for regular, greasy mayonaise.  The carmelized onions were also very bland. The cheddar and bacon barely boosted the flavor.  Another thing is that it was all so greasy, so much that the bun started getting soggy from the grease before I finished eating, and I am not a slow eater.  \\n\\nI have honestly had much better burgers for $5, let alone $14.  \\n\\nThe thin and crispy Pommes Frites were very nice though....homemade and very rustic....seasoned with roasted garlic cloves, rosemary and thyme.  \\n\\nGiven all of the positive reviews for this restaurant, I may have just selected a menu item that was having an off day.  \\n\\nI  do like the ambience of Everett Street Bistro very much, and I will return to try some of the other menu selections."},{"name":"Olympia Pizza","address":"3205 Broadway W","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"So Good, just had a feta and capiola pizza.\\n\\nOpen a little bit later than other places in the area.

I knew it was small when i was stabbed with an umbrella by someone sliding into the family style seating right behind me.\\n\\nThe service was relatively quick without a hitch at all, so no complaints there.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the food was a let down. I ordered the Jammin' Jill wrap and a side of queso with green hatch chiles and chips. The chips and queso were actually quite amazing and their serving sizes are really generous. 8 ounces of queso goes a long way. It wasn't so thick the chips died a slow death as they break apart and sink. Plus, the chiles were used liberally so there was a pleasant amount in each bite.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the wrap, it becomes disheartening. There was entirely too much lettuce and jerk sauce. The sauce was literally leaking through the paper it was wrapped in and the bag I carried it out with. I'm a fan of saucy wraps, but this was too much, especially considering it was overly peppery. Jerk sauce is supposed to have heat but this was not heat. Just pepper. It made every bite a bit unpleasant and requires powering through.\\n\\nThe pineapple salsa was basically non-existent, so I couldn't speak to it. Clearly, it was not enough to cut the pepper of the jerk sauce.\\n\\nFinally, the main event of the wrap, the chicken. This place is supposed to specialize in chicken, so that has to be right. Well, it wasn't. The texture was so off that I was thrown beyond a loop. I was eating the wrap consistently and felt something really soft and was thinking maybe it was avocado. I could barely discern any flavors because of the crazy peppery jerk sauce, so assumed it was the case. Halfway through being annoyed with so much avocado, I open the wrap and realize that there is no avocado. It's the chicken. Either somebody pureed it in a blender or I'll be visiting the ER soon. I have never had mushy chicken and am sad that it ever came into my life.\\n\\nI might stop by this place again for queso and a beer, but it'll be a while before I'm adventurous enough to try anything else again."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"This place is pretty cool!

While we waited for the tacos, we enjoyed their homemade guacamole (very good- tangy, which I like, a little oily, not sure why, but I didn't mind it) . Chips were okay but guacamole was divine so nobody cared- the owner noticed we'd been given warming chips (probably left from the lunch rush) and came running over with a freshly fried basket of chips, which of course puts the simple side dish right over the top. And, you have to love a place where the owners really care.  Tacos, salbutes, etc were delicious, every single one.

My main course was the Grilled Avocados, and they were absolutely amazing - perfectly grilled. The portion was a little dainty -- the size of the Avocado was swallowed up by the goat cheese and peppers, Couldn't they include one mode wedge (I think I got 1/2 of a small Avocado).

I'm a firm believer that this place is solid all around.  In fact I've never gotten anything that i haven't been happy with... until i tried them for brunch.\\n\\nFor the most part the staff is great, some people there go above and beyond.  For example my roommate and I were there on a slow Friday night and we started talking up the bar tender about vodka.  We couldn't ID all the different vodka bottles on the top shelf of the bar.  The bar tender told us about the 2 mystery bottles and offered us a taste.  I now know about Hammer and Sickle vodka which is hands down the best Vodka I've ever had the chance to taste.  It seriously makes Grey Goose taste like Poland springs.  So that was amazing.  I'm totally hooked, I've already been back twice to get that amazing vodka straight up.\\n\\nI've gotten burgers, salads, steaks, fish and shellfish as well as a seafood stew at Burton's and i would order every item again.  I love this place cause its not gonna break the bank.  Its a fresh of breathe air to chain of casual dining restaurants.\\n\\nHowever, and this is the reason for the lack of the 5Th star.  I went for brunch ( which to they're credit, they've only started doing recently) and it was not good.  I order the crab cakes eggs Benedict which is my favorite brunch item to eat.  The crab cake was good, the holindaise was great, the eggs... where so over cooked , that they came out hard boiled.  \\n\\nIf you're gonna be open for brunch, please train your staff on how to properly poach an egg.

I used to walk by this place all the time, skipping out on them because I was never particular about the appearance on the outside. A group of friends were stepping out from a meetup downtown when we decided to grab dinner. We ended up deciding on Ceviche, which, on a Tuesday happens to discount their tapas. \\n\\nUpon walking in (9pm-ish) we attempted to step into the side without the music, but it was closed despite people eating there. We eventually opted for the corner of the live music area, a circular table located in the back that seats 6-7 people comfortably. If you're looking to get in on the entertainment though, this won't be the best spot as you won't see much. \\n\\nAnywho, our table ended up with the Ceviche De Atun (Tuna Ceviche), Gambas Bravas (Fried Shrimp), Calamares Fritos (Fried Squid), Champinones Del Monte (Roasted and Marinated Mushrooms), Papas Fritas (Potato Chips), Patatas Bravas (Fried Potatoes in an aioli sauce), and Chorizo Y Pimientos (Chorizo/Sausage). \\n\\nMy personal picks were the Ceviche and the Gambas Bravas, which were amazing! I do have a small gripe with the Ceviche and that would be the amount of greens the tuna was served over. I was fishing around a bit to find my tuna (huehuehue). The Ceviche is served in a glass, so it is more of a personal dish that you can still share with 2-3 people but nothing to get full over. The Gambas Bravas were possibly my favorite. They come with a slight kick to them, but the shrimp was plentiful and juicy. \\n\\nMy friends ordered the other items which were shared amongst the table. I'd suggest anyone coming with foodie friends to do the same. The Calamari was probably one of the best I've had in Orlando. The breading isn't overdone and the seasoning on them was so good that I felt no need to dip them in any type of sauce. The roasted mushrooms were also great; with a sauce that wasn't overpowering and a juicy bite that kept the flavor of the mushroom quite well. The Patatas Bravas were definitely a heavy dish yet I have never loved a potato dish that much.  I also could not get enough of the Chorizo which were cooked just right and maintained their different flavors well within the sauce they were cooked in. Overall, everything seemed to be well thought out and I had no gripes about any of the dishes other than the Ceviche. \\n\\nI also ordered the Red Sangria alongside a glass of water. It was definitely a refreshing drink to go with the meal. If you're here, don't think twice on it.\\n\\nBecause of the performances the area we were in was very dimly lit (and I mean dimly) so I can't quite comment much on the presentation, but in the light that we could see in, it all looked delicious on arrival. When we were placing our orders, we pulled our phones out to read the menu. There were two candles on the table for light which may not have been adequate. One of them also went out for whatever reason which made it even darker. Had we sat in another spot we probably would have gotten better lighting, so I can't detract from that. \\n\\nLastly, I felt the service to be adequate. The waiter kept coming back to check on us, we got our refills pretty timely, and the dishes came out as they were ready, which was a pro and con. We were hungry so it kept us busy while the rest of our food was being prepared. \\n\\nI'll definitely be back to enjoy the live music, great food and drinks."},{"name":"DUOwusa","address":"875 Woodbury Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"We saw the signs for this new place yesterday while driving around and decided to try it out today after our errands.

My friend and I split the lobster roe noodles which were amazing! Such great combos of lobster, braised short ribs, Brussel sprouts- might sound weird, but so good. The kitchen also split it for us which earns huge brownie points in my book.

Apparently excellent grilled chicken foccacia (Marinated chicken breast with basil pesto, Applewood smoked bacon, herbed cheese spread, beefsteak tomato, red onion and fresh mozzarella, topped with mixed greens tossed in balsamic vinaigrette, served on asiago focaccia - 11).  The fish tacos were stated to be very good as well, but more than the person could finish.

That's usually not a good sign. However, the food here is good, the host charmed me with his cheerfulness and french accent, and my server was cute, jk. \\n\\nAlright, here is the deal. Com is french inspired Vietnamese cuisine. It;s not the typical Vietnamese restaurant you ate at on BuHi. It's not really associated with Com BuHi because they changed ownership, and this is more french-inspired. There's no pho here,  because the french did not bring it to Vietnam, so don't come expecting pho, bc u ain't getting any.\\n\\nIt offers a full bar, food with fancy sounding words, like carpaccio, and grape leaves. I actually freaked out when I saw the menu. This is me: \\" WTF?? Lamb?! Salmon??! apples in salad?!?! Vietnamese people don't eat this?!! ay yay yay!!\\" Then I saw banh hoi, clay pot fish, bun, and calmed down. I ordered banh hoi with grilled pork, with banh trang ( or rice paper) for an extra 2 dollars.  To my consternation, the banh hoi was not greased up with scallions and oil like how I was used to in the VN. The grilled pork was good, but not atypical of grilled pork at other Vietnamese establishments. It was good, but probably not 16-17 dollars good, ya get me?? \\n\\nOne notable thing is they offer la lot, or what they call grape leaves. However, they also use the word betal leaves interchangeably. Ok, I'm not too cultured or learned, but I think this may be a misnomer. Betal leaves is what the old folks use to chew on w some crazy nuts that makes their teeth red and then they'd have to go and dye it black because somehow they think that's more presentable. \\n\\nI ordered the la lot w beef. It was good and flavorful, and had potential to be better. It was just the beef was already marinated and they had to go and pour fish sauce on the dish. The fish sauce is not pure fish sauce, it's the kind of fish sauce that's mixed w/ sugar, h2o, garlic, pepper, to produce the kind you normally get w rice dishes. They advertised it with their dipping sauce, but their dipping sauce seemed like typical red pepper sauce.\\n\\n I'm not sure how authentic, historically accurate, or true to Indochine cuisine this place is and I'd be interested to find out. Overall, this place offers a novel presentation of Vietnamese dishes. All the politics aside, the food is good.

Admittedly we had a waiting list reservation but when we showed up the person at the door took a good 2-3 minutes to even acknowledge us.

When I called the restaurant, I was asked did it say \\"pending\\" and I said yes. Then I was told that they charge it automatically just as hotels charge for incidentals, but it should drop off within 24 hours. WTF?! This must be to ensure their servers receive tips or something. It should be stated somewhere! I paid with my card and my daughter took care of the tip. Had I known this secret policy I would have just had her to give me the tip and I would've added it to the total on the card. Then again, I don't know because it would still be a double tip.

A little free desert would've been nice as most upscale restaurants at least do this much. Our server did say happy birthday to him though and he was very nice. The entire staff was nice and attentive. Nothing to say WOW about, I mean ours didn't converse with us except to help with the menu, and I did see some servers converse with other guests so I guess he was just not a talkative person, or probably just didn't want to bother us. \\n\\nMy son and daughter had ribye steaks. My son ordered his medium well and he said it was more like well done, but it was good. He also ordered the mashed potatoes which taste like boxed instant ones.

Neither of them wanted to send their steaks back for fear of having to wait too long for new ones. Since restaurants do have their own versions of medium and medium well I explained to them that in the future they should ask the server what their version is.  My daughter also ordered their mac-n-cheese and she said it was good. \\n\\nI wanted the duck, but their online menu wasn't updated, so the duck that was actually on the menu at the restaurant wasn't the same.

ICOB provides the tastiest cocktail sauce I have ever had - Gypsy Juice - a little sweet, a little hot, and worked perfectly with these oysters.\\n\\nLast but not least - the most tremendous lobster roll I think I've ever had in my life.  All of the meat was from the claws and was very sweet.  There wasn't too much mayo and served in a lightly buttered rosemary foccacia bun.

There are a bunch of tables inside to enjoy your sandwich. \\n\\nHad the signature pastrami and corned beef combo on light rye bread. It was very good. The meat was not overly salted, lean but not chewy and the coleslaw and Russian dressing was just enough to compliment. The meat is thinly sliced but the sandwich still felt very meaty. In comparison to the recently opened Mamaleh's, this was a way better sandwich and the meat was a lot better. \\n\\nThe only slightly negative point was that you couldn't tell which one was the corned beef and pastrami.

Lucky for me she mentioned that the time frame I was going on happened to be \\"restaurant-week' meaning there was a pre-fixed menu which was a great deal.\\n\\nI ordered from the pre-fixed menu which was a three-course meal. For starters you had a choice of soup so I order the French Onion of course. The soup met my expectations but didn't blow me away. I couldn't remember what the name was for the main course but it consisted of linguine pasta with seafood and a spicy sauce. I was disappointed with it since the pasta was slightly under cooked from being al-dente and the seafood was so tiny you weren't sure what you were eating.

So, I don't even like chicken, and these chicken wings were seriously the most delish wings I've ever had.

You had an option of sitting in an outdoor tent area or inside, so we waited to be seated inside.  (Since we were there visiting, we waned the full effect of Pok Pok!)  Since the place is small, there was a wait.. but luckily they have Soda Whiskey Lounge across the street where you can wait and have drinks until they phone over to the hostesses and let them know when your table is ready.  Hands down, one of the smartest tactics I've seen! We didn't have to wait at a small, crowded, small bar within the restaurant, instead, they had a whole separate bar across the street from the restaurant. Love it!! Btw, the Thai Bloody Mary was good! It had a hint of lemon grass which hit the spot! \\n\\nPrice: For what you get, I feel it is very worthwhile! \\n\\nService: Servers were all super friendly and helpful when we were trying to figure out what to order.

This is what happens when somebody known for his pulled pork, turduckens and grilled lamb goes veg: shock and awe. \\n\\nThat being said, I had an epiphany about a month ago. It was simple and in list form, was sort of entertaining. \\n\\n1. I've been convincing myself that I've been eating well for a long time, but in reality I have been eating garbage\\n2. I really like vegetables and as a grown up, can afford to eat more of them and less of them out of cans and freezer bags\\n3. It is possible to develop a taste for soy, tofu, seitan, strange beans and kale over time (actually, happens pretty quickly)\\n4. The living conditions of livestock on mass production farms is absolutely horrific, the slaughtering of these animals is absolutely cruel and I want no part in supporting this industry\\n5.

The seafood dishes were *gone* by the time I even made it to our buffet table. The scallops with bacon app got rave reviews. The shrimp scampi I didn't even taste because everyone had eaten it already. I also enjoyed their chicken, ziti, broccoli and the chicken marsala. \\n\\nThe setup for the party was great. I just ordered the quick drop, but Katie, who brought the food, nicely arranged everything and was so pleasant. They also have options for servers, chafing dishes, or pretty much anything you could want. I would advice using the chafing dishes. I didn't because I wasn't sure our hall would allow them, but I was sad when the food cooled off.

The outsides of the eight or so blocks of tofu (larger than your standard cubes) were bubbly and crispy, and the innards were soft and squishy and hot. The sauce was soy sauce with cilantro and raw jalapenos floating in it. I dipped, tasted, and said \\"There's something reaaaally fishy going on here.\\" \\nDespite being totally grossed out  by the utter fishiness of the stuff, I tried the second cube of tofu without sauce, thinking maybe the soy sauce had some fish sauce mixed in. I took one bite, then another, enjoying the texture. Then I went for a third bite and discovered a SHRIMP! \\nA big, ugly NOT VEGETARIAN shrimp in my tofu.\\nWe got the attention of a waiter, who took back the plate (which on closer inspection had shrimp in every cube) and gave me a menu, which I pored over for any mention of shrimp or fish in that or any of the other vegetable dishes. No such luck (though another dish clearly contains oyster sauce).\\nThen our original waitress came out and chastised me for not telling her I was a vegetarian. Over and over. Until I felt rather stupid for their menu's mistake.\\nThen she said they'd bring out some tofu without shrimp. I decided that was fine, handed back the menu, though I wasn't really in the mood for more tofu at that point, and waited for my food. \\nI nibbled on some well-cooked rice while waiting, and I noticed a couple of staff members walking around munching on the food I sent back. On one hand, I'm very glad the food didn't get wasted, but on the other, it's pretty unprofessional of workers to munch on food as they work, including while walking across the dining area.\\nBy the time the guy had finished his soup, I got my tofu. I ate maybe three cubes of it, but the fishy odor of the second dish made me wonder whether they hadn't just picked the shrimp off pre-made blocks of tofu. Plus the second order was a little on the darker side of crispy, which wasn't what I was looking for. \\nI took the five leftover cubes home, but they were gross cold and reheated.\\nI would try it again to make the guy happy, but I will be sure to tell the people who wait on us that I'm vegetarian at least six times, despite never having had to tell a waitperson that before.

This place lacks the consistency that one would expect from a restaurant of this caliber.\\n\\nOur server last night was really trying to up sell us.  After asking us the second time if we wanted to order any starters or drinks one would think she'd stop asking, but that's not the case. The entree portions are pretty substantial and we wanted to really enjoy it instead of feeling full before it even gets to our table.  Also, we had a huge lunch that afternoon and went to Harpoon right before coming to the restaurant and the last thing we wanted to do was drink again.  And why do I have to explain myself to the server?  I can overlook this aspect if the food was amazing, but it fell way short of my expectations.\\n\\nThe entrees we had were the lobster roe noodles (my favorite), cod special, and the salmon.  I raved about the lobster noodles and told people that is what I would have for my last meal, but this time around it was just bland and lukewarm when it came to the table.  My sister was completely disappointed by this dish and she's the easiest person to impress out of all of us at dinner that night.  The noodles were so thin and slightly over cooked that they broke when i tried to twirl it around my fork.  The salmon, which was suppose to be served medium/medium well, came out well done and dry.  The cod was a solid dish and I enjoyed it, but not as much as the other fish entrees I've ordered in the past. The fish was light, moist, and flaky, but the crust was crunchy and very oily.  The people we were with that night were nice about the shortcomings, but I was embarrassed because I told them they were going to have an amazing seafood dinner.\\n\\nI am sure that many others have experienced wonderful food during every visit, but that has not been my case.  This is just my honest experience and you can take it or leave it.  I really want to keep coming back, but I don't want to gamble $50+/pp on whether or not the food will be amazing or just mediocre."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"the food is amazing some of the best thai food i have ever had but the service is terrible and it is so pretentious i have been there twice and wont be going back so if you like great food and bad service i highly recommend this place"},{"name":"True Food Kitchen","address":"222 West Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Everyone raves about True Foods but I did not have a good experience.

Since I stayed at a nearby guesthouse, i came here for dinner on my first night in the lovely city.\\n\\nI was dining alone so was seated right away, but I overheard parties of 2 and 3 that had to wait 40 minutes or so.  This was on a Monday night, so it's definitely a packed restaurant.  \\n\\nThe location itself is very interesting.  Part of the restaurant looked like it used to be a Victorian house and then it also had a patio that had a long bar for seating and other tables.  i sat at the bar-like table.  This is also right next to the outdoor kitchen where they do a lot of the grilling, I suspect.  The whole ambiance was casual and friendly and fun.\\n\\nMy waitress was very friendly and despite the restaurant being busy, I never felt neglected.  It probably helped that I sat right in front of the service station though so I was frequently in her line of sight.\\n\\nI told her I want to order something chargrilled (a recommendation from my friend) and she said the Boar Collar is most popular, but she warned me that it is VERY spicy.  I was skeptical at first but decided to try it anyway.\\n\\nSo I ended up ordering:\\n- the Mango Alexander cocktail\\n- the fried chicken wings (i don't remember the actual name of this dish)\\n- the chargrilled boar collar\\n- sticky rice\\n\\n\\nThe Mango Alexander was super yummy.  It has mango puree, coconut cream, lime, and vodka.  It tasted like a mango / coconut smoothy and i didn't taste the alcohol AT ALL.  This is not to say it wasn't strong because I definitely felt a buzz after drinking it on my empty stomach.  It also served as a great way to cool down some of the spicy food I ordered.\\n\\nThe wings came first and they were AMAZING.  It tasted like the best combination of garlic and fish sauce you can imagine.  Full of flavor, perfect texture, and great portions.  Also, they give you the whole wing (including the tip), so definitely be prepared to go a little man vs. food as you try to eat this.  It's all part of what makes it finger-licking good though.\\n\\nThe boar collar and rice came next.  The boar collar was sliced up so it was easy to eat and piled on top of it were thai chiles and garlic and cilantro.  It smelled amazing so I was already excited.  The server also gave me a plate of ice with some raw leafy greens in it.  He said it's to help with cooling down my palette from the spiciness of the boar.  This made me a little scared because they were making such a big deal about the spiciness.\\n\\nSo I took my first bite of the boar collar, and it was not too spicy at all.  It was the perfect amount of spicy, in my opinion.  If you're into REALLY spicy food, you may be disappointed, but I enjoyed it.   The boar was grilled pretty perfectly, and the garlic, chile, and cilantro flavors definitely came up front and center and went really well together.  i think there was also a touch of lime that cut through the heaviness and spiciness really well too.  All in all, solid and very delicious.\\n\\nThe sticky rice they served me was presented in a little plastic bag, which I thought was interesting.  I've been to Thailand and know they usually eat rice that way (i.e., you take bites out of it from your hand as if you were holding a bun), but I used my plate anyways.\\n\\nI was very happy with this place, and it's definitely one of the best Thai places I've been to and I've been to many.  Would definitely come back again if I'm in Portland.\\n\\nOne last thing.  I didn't check out their dessert menu at all because I had planned to get ice cream at the Salt & Straw (or is it Straw & Salt?) cart a block away."},{"name":"That's Italian Too","address":"957 Washington St","city":"East Weymouth","stars":"4","text":"Growing up in Scituate, nothing has ever compared to Maria's Italian subs...until now.

Yes, they have lots of books in almost every category. Yes, I quickly wound up with a basket full of books. It is quite easy to quickly exceed one's carry-on baggage limit at Powell's; fortunately, they will ship just about any amount of books (\\"10 to 1000!\\" the signs proclaim) anywhere in the U.S. for $12.95.\\n\\nHowever.\\n\\nThey had many fewer used books than I expected. Much of what was on the shelves was new; there were trolleys in some areas with loads of one new book (e.g., The Girl Who Played With Fire in Mysteries). I have a sneaky suspicion that most of the walk-in traffic is tourists, and the entrance area suggests that, crammed with souvenirs that might be purchased once but would not be useful to a local. There was even a free \\"have your picture taken at Powell's\\" stand, where they blue-screen a digital photo of you over a digital backdrop of the front of the store.\\n\\nI did go into the rare book room. It's a separate room, closed off from the rest of the store and much better air-conditioned, on the top retail level. It's fairly small, maybe 20 x 30, with only a few hundred volumes (maybe) and some sets. Aside from a signed limited edition of The Little Prince, there wasn't much that caught my eye-it was largely art books, some historical documents, and a number of sets (e.g., a set of 1910 Britannicas).\\n\\nWe still wound up shipping a large box (18 pounds) of books back home.

Not sure if that's the way its supposed to be served when you get into this class of restaurant but to me, it watered down the flavor of the seasoning it was cooked with, and the sauce that I ordered it with.

I came for dinner and we asked for a table for 2 and they said it would be about 10 minutes. We got seated in a timely manner and were looking over the menu waiting to order. The one thing I didn't like about where we were seated which seemed to be close to the kitchen upstairs somewhere is that it literally smelled like feces. I'm not sure if it was the mixture of sauces or what but it was very unappetizing. Eventually they opened some windows and it aired out or I just got used to the smell and it went away but that was a very negative aspect of the restaurant right off the bat. IWe ordered pok pok wings, some shrimp with noodles in a clay pot and then some boar collar. I love spicy food. However, the pok pok wings we got were the regular ones which aren't suppose to be spicy but I think they messed up and gave us spicy because my girlfriend was dying and I could sense there was a higher spice level than there should have been. She barely ate any and I had a plate all to myself. I was happy but she was not and that makes me unhappy she didn't get to enjoy them like I did. They need to check the spice level. Flavor was good but they messed up by making it way too spicy. We then got the boar collar which was also very spicy but they said it would be so we expected it unlike with the wings. The boar collar came with mustard greens over ice that was suppose to help curve the spicy level which it did so I enjoyed it. The girl did not because the meat was rather dry and gamey. The last dish was the shrimp dish which was very tasty, the shirmp was cooked to perfection and the noddles were awesome pairings with the shrimp and sauce that was savory. The issue was that I took a bite of noodles and I bit something rather chewy. I take whatever it was out of my mouth and it's a piece of rope! Supposedly it was to tie the shrimp together but they forgot to cut it. Yeah, that was not very cool and when I told the waitress she tried to play it off like it wasn't a big deal. Yeah I know I'm a grown man and the probability of me choking on it is small but you can't tell me it's whatever to my face. You help fix the problem. They eventually decided to give me the shrimp dish on the house which was very nice of them but I could tell they really were reluctant to do so. If no gesture was made to help redeem their mistake this review would be much lower. The combination of the horrid smell, ultra spicy wings when we wanted non-spicy and eating a piece of rope was imposing on the positive eating experience that I wanted to have.

The sashimi itself is high quality, but besides that, the food choices are pretty typical for a sushi buffet. \\n\\nFor how hyped up this place is, it's not that worth it even during normal hours. It's fairly expensive for a sushi buffet, and there's not as many choices as you'd expect for the price. There are better sushi buffets in the atlanta area for the same or cheaper cost.

Admittedly Mariposa also offers food, but I go there the least out of the three (see review for more details?).\\n\\n2) Live music\\nLa Luna stands alone here out of the three.  One wonders how a place that opens its windows and has live music pouring out can remain so underground.  I think it might be because Desi Dhaba is right next door, as Economy Hardware tends to hide Mariposa.  Perhaps things will change with the addition of the common area outside.\\n\\n3) Pretty coffee\\nServed in generous, colorful mugs, this place offers presentation with their coffee.

Also, the meatloaf was very sweet--which could be from the ketchup commonly used for this dish, but I felt was a bit too much.\\n\\nThe most recent occasion, I ordered the specialty steak and cheese sandwich. The sandwich was very good overall--thinly slice beef, caramelized onions and gooey cheese all complimenting each other. That was the good. So what was the bad? The sandwich was not on a baguette as advertised, instead on a panini bread, and was very very greasy. I do not think that steak and cheese sandwiches should be this greasy.\\n\\n***Complaints about service***\\nAlso, the service was a bit mediocre. I head my steak and cheese order being completed and the sandwich maker calling for a completed order. It wasn't until 5 minutes later that I received my sandwich. This practice is unacceptable because service was slow on this day and people had already been served! \\n\\nSecond complaint was that  my friend and I never received nor were asked whether we wanted water until we requested it--which was after we had been served food. Isn't the first rule when seating tables to give the customers utensils and ask them whether they wanted water? \\n\\nThe decor and placement is very versatile-- good for enjoying food outside on a nice, sunny day but nice and enough spacing for dining indoors.

It looked good but the taste of it was very bland. Everything else from the khao soi, yum woon Sen, & wings was delicious!!

Party of 7.  Table was next to kitchen door, so not the best location on a table that was kind of small for 7.  Reservation was made around 4PM that day, so I guess, can't complain too much.  Reservation was at 8:45pm.  Tried to get into Bones, but 9:45 was the earliest.  \\n\\nWe had the wagyu short ribs and beef carpaccio for apps.  I had a ceasar salad as well.  Carpaccio was nothing special, would not recommend.  The short ribs were good and would recommend.  Had Chimney rock Cab to go with the steaks.  Wife and uncle ordered the dry age for 2. Asked for medium and most of it was medium, but some parts were well done. One had the filet (10 or 12 ounce) and they said it was good.  I had the 20 oz rib eye, med rare and it was good and seasoned to my liking.  the meat was tender.  My 5 year old loved the cheese bread.\\nFor dessert, we had the bonbons and creme brulee.  people liked the bonbons more than the creme brulee.  In my opinion, neither was anything special, just average at best.  If you are looking for a reasonably priced wine to go with the steak and you like cabs, try the Chimney Rock.  It was about $150 or so.  Makes me cringe when I know I can buy it in Orange County for approx $55/bottle.\\n\\nOverall, the steaks are the reason you go here.

The salads are quite good too. I can't speak to the juice, but they do a tasty smoothie. For the ones that have the coconut ice cream, my preference is to exchange the ice cream for avocado to reduce the sugar. They are VERY accommodating with any substitutions you want.\\n\\nFree wi-fi for a few hours using the code at the register. An ever-changing selection of fascinating books along the window.

Very small and a group of more than 4 seems to take up the whole place. It can get crowded and loaded with college kids some nights.\\n\\nService: The hosts are the only nice people in this restaurant and seem to be constantly busy. But the servers... not so much. Oftentimes seem inattentive, rarely check up on you and are very slow getting your food and your order, and don't really care to describe the menu or offer suggestions. And despite the service being really slow and poor, the servers all stand on the wall and stare at you while you eat. One of the female managers is very rude, not only with the way she address staff but also the way she addresses customers and constantly stares at you like shes better than you.\\n\\nMenu: extensive and overly priced appetizers. The wings are pretty good but aren't as good as Bon Chon, they are crispy but not as flavorful as you expect them to be. The dishes, which for dinner range from about 12-20$, are decent but nothing I'd ever crave. The maki rolls are on the pricer side, but are pretty good and some of the signature sushi rolls are good, but depends on the day you have it and who is making it. \\n\\nDrinks: Really good scorpion bowls, occasional very good signature cocktail, but it depends on the server making your cocktail as there is no bartender.\\n\\nThe only thing I would come back for is some of their sushi rolls or their lunch specials. For the Mission Hill neighborhood this is about as good quality sushi as it gets. But in general, slightly over priced and you've probably had better. \\n\\nOverall: What I've learned over the course of 2 months about this place:  you are debating between two places for dinner, the other option is probably better.

We arrived 5 minutes early for our reservation for dinner on a Friday night and they already had the table ready for us, so we were seated immediately.\\n\\nThey have soccer jerseys hung/pinned to the ceiling, several tables fairly close together inside, and a few tables outside.

I was considering the Spaghetti Mare e Monti without shrimp, but after asking if it could be made this way, the waiter seemed offended and alerted me that it wouldn't be any cheaper just because I didn't want shrimp. That really wasn't why I was asking if it could be made that way... so I ended up ordering the Penne al Pesto. At one point during ordering, the waiter asked if I wanted something in Italian, I didn't understand or hear him asked him to repeat himself, I'm still not sure what I was being asked. \\n\\nThe wait for the food wasn't too long, it was about as expected given a busy evening in the Pearl District. While waiting, we scarfed down two baskets of bread, which you can choose to dip in olive oil and black pepper. \\n\\nOur food was served, and my biggest concern was that I wouldn't get a decent portion size for the price I was paying, and how simple my dish sounded on the menu. It was just penne pasta, with a creamy pesto, to the tune of $13. Let's be real here, I likely ordered the item with the highest profit margin on the menu. It tasted okay, I enjoyed my meal and was full by the end. However, I don't think it was worth the high price, the snooty waiters, or the congestion of the Pearl District. I'm pretty sure I could've cooked something similar for myself for much less.\\n\\nSo, if you're into Italian dudes speaking to you in Italian, having strong opinions about their menu, and getting \\"fresh\\" pasta that tasted like ... pretty much every other penne pasta I've ever had.... Go for it! My wife seemed to enjoy her meal, but ultimately I wasn't impressed. It wasn't extra special, and though the prices weren't exorbitant, they weren't cheap either."},{"name":"Cheeseburger Bobby's","address":"4365 Roswell Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Love this place!!

It was started by regular guys.  It's not at all as contrived as you would think.  It was basically started as a burrito joint for guys who love good beer.

People, I'm a Jew, and I don't eat pork that often. But listen: The roasted pork with that indescribable candy-red outer coating is like crack. I like it. I scoop it up, along with the savory sauce, and lay it on top of a fluffy mound of perfectly steamed white rice. And then I eat it. Pure sacrilegious bliss. (Don't tell my grandma.)\\n\\nThe best way to go is family style, but two can have themselves a nice, varied meal. The prices are very affordable for the portion size, so three dishes comes out to about 30 bucks. The meat is almost always perfectly stir-fried or roasted, whichever way you want it. The Chinese broccoli with ginger and garlic is probably the most delicious way to get your leafy greens.\\n\\nOther standouts include: the Peking duck (my sister gets a crazy look in her eye when we order it); the sizzling scallops (not sure if it actually is scallops, but I don't care--the sweet-salty sauce is highly addictive); pan-fried noodles (comes with big, juicy shitake mushrooms. mmmm); beef or chicken w/snow peas (stir-fried to perfection).\\n\\nIf you're the type that likes to play it safe and just get sesame chicken, you might want to get that somewhere else.

I've ordered a wide variety of items and will give some brief notes for those wondering how good they are here:\\n\\nYuk gae jang - 8/10.  This is probably my go-to soup here.  Flavors are pretty solid and remind me of my mom's a bit (not as good, but close enough).  No complaints about this one.\\n\\nFried Fish Appetizer (Seng sun jeon) - 6.5/10.  It really is a shame that they drop frozen cod into this, the fish itself is incredibly dry and the hint of freezer taste to it.  If they were not lazy and used fresh cod for this, I would bring this up to a 9/10.\\n\\nSundubu Jjigae - (Soft tofu stew) - 5 / 10.  I'm probably spoiled by some of the best when it comes to this dish, and growing up around Palisades Park where some of the best korean restaurants on the east coast exist, this soup falls completely flat.  The signature broth taste with a hint of seafood to it is non existent here.  Sometimes this soup comes out way too oily, and other times just way too watery.  I've yet to find a truly authentic and good sundubu jjigae in Boston though.\\n\\nBulgogi - Beef - 7/10.  It's really hard to mess up marinated strip steak.  This is your typical run of the mill bulgogi.  Decent, would order if I craved it.\\n\\nTangsuyuk - (Sweet/sour, crispy pork) - 3/10.  Definitely not ordering again.  This was drenched in the sweet/sour sauce, there was absolutely no crisp to it (I like my tangsuyuk to be crispy).  I'd go as far as to say this was a sweet/sour sauce stew with tangsuyuk swimming at the bottom.\\n\\nKalbi - (Short ribs) - 5/10.  Again, probably spoiled by better kalbi found in Pal Park NJ, the kalbi here is pretty mediocre.  It's extremely tough, chewy, and you don't get a large enough portion for the amount of money you're paying.\\n\\nKimchi Bokum - (Kimchi stir fry) - 7/10.  Another really hard one to mess up.  The kimchi isn't sour so all is golden and good.  Love it.\\n\\nOverall like I said, being korean, I come here when I'm in a pinch and just craving some korean food.  It's not TERRIBLE.  It's just average.  If you don't know much about korean food, it's worth the venture and worth the taste.\\n\\nI haven't left any comments about service because what some people consider rude, others will consider \\"no bullshit, in-and-out service\\" of just getting it done and getting it done quickly.

They do NOT answer their phone; the automated answering system just refers you to their website.  So, if you are confused, or have a question, you are out of luck.  We made a reservation over their website, but something went wrong with the request, and our reservation did not go through.  We decided to risk going without a reservation, and showed up at 5pm on a Saturday.  To our surprise, they were able to seat our party of 6 within 5 minutes or so.\\n\\nThey have a good beer selection.  The cocktails are very good, but on the spendy side; $10 seems kinda steep for a gin and tonic.\\n\\nThe food is excellent.  I had the baby back ribs and sticky rice.  The ribs were very tender and flavorful.  The dipping sauces for the ribs were also excellent.  I'm not sure why they chose to cut the ribs into 1-inch pieces, rather than serving them whole, but perhaps that is the traditional preparation for the dish.  Portions weren't as large as I'm used to, but I got full, and didn't feel cheated.  Prices for food were perfectly reasonable.\\n\\nThe restrooms are inconveniently placed in the building; they are in a very high-traffic area for the waitstaff.  The servers constantly have to ask customers who are in line for the 2 single-person restrooms to get out of the way.\\n\\nSo, admin and technical issues notwithstanding, I enthusiastically recommend that you try PokPok out.

All 5-rated restaurants are great in their niche, and Nori Nori is great in the niche of medium-high-end Japanese buffet, serving a large selection of Nigiri and Maki Sushi, Sashimi, Cold and Hot prepared foods and Desserts in a clean, modern, family friendly setting at the relatively reasonable price of $29.50 a person.  \\n\\nFor me, Nori Nori was a place I brought my \\"date\\" to because she had limited exposure to Japanese food and I wanted her to be able to try as many kinds of Japanese foods as possible at once for maximum exposure.  \\n\\nHere's what you need to know about Nori Nori:\\n\\nFOOD:\\n\\nFirst of all, open up the photos I've uploaded for visual reference in another tab.  I've uploaded 27 photos detailing the buffet section by section.\\n\\nThe first section is Teppanyaki (Hibachi) and Robata (grilled stuff on a stick).  A chef prepares \\"Hibachi\\" for you to order, and takes care of three trays containing Ribeye steak slices, Fried Rice, and the Robata.\\n\\nThe second section is the most significant, and the reason most people go to Nori Nori -- the Sushi Buffet.  The selection is extensive, with about 24 types of Nigirizushi alone, including Unagi, Salmon and Ahi Tataki, Ebi, **HAMACHI**, Hokkigai, Tamago, Maguro, Tako, Shima Saba, Tai, Salmon, Escolar, Inari, Crab Avocado, Masago, Spicy Tuna, **IKURA** and about another two dozen well-made Maki Sushi Rolls.  The rice balls are small, as they should be so you're not eating little pieces of topping with a mouthful of rice.\\n\\nThe sushi quality is decent, but I must note that they are not properly made.  The rice is made out of \\"Sushi Robot\\" machines, or pressed into molds by the chefs behind the buffet line.  Sushi toppings are simply laid on top of the molded rice, and set out.  The rice is also not cooked properly and not served at the proper body temperature (BTW, 90% of Sushi restaurants don't do this properly).  This is reasonable and understandable, because properly hand-forming Nigirizushi takes a lot of experience and skill that is unsustainable in this model.  The Sushi IS good for what it is, and the fact that I can sit here and eat entire plates full of Hamachi and Ikura Nigiri make it worth it.  My \\"date\\" noticed that her Sushi toppings were just laid down and often fell off when she picked them up; so I washed my hands and hand-formed her Sushi for her into the little rounded-top forms she was used to eating at good Sushi restaurants.\\n\\nThe third section is a salad section, with several salads that I didn't really pay attention to because of the three nommy Sashimi trays (Salmon, Saba and Tai).\\n\\nThe fourth section is a cold food section with an excellent Scallop Ceviche at that I enjoyed more than the Sashimi, a very good Salmon Carpaccio, Oysters on the Half Shell, and Crab Legs.\\n\\nThe fifth section is a hot food section with rotating selections.  There was Shrimp, Vegetable, Scallop Tempura Dynamite, a kind of Tempura Blue Crab, BBQ Pork Ribs, Basa Fillet, Oyster Rockerfeller, Takoyaki, Noodle Crab Cake, Beef Short Rib, Teriyaki Chicken, Shumai and Soups.\\n\\nThe sixth section is a dessert section, which is really not notable except for the made-to-order crepes.  There's also a green tea ice cream which is pretty good.\\n\\nPARKING:\\n\\nParking is plentiful and shared with a shopping center.\\n\\nORDERING:\\n\\nBuffet.\\n\\nSEATING:\\n\\nNori Nori is a large restaurant, possibly seating over 250, with a side room and combinable tables throughout.  The layout is expansive, and able to accommodate very large parties.  Because of the food selection and the seating, Nori Nori is perfect to host events or just big get-togethers.\\n\\nSERVICE:\\n\\nIf I could give 6-stars, I would.  We arrived just before opening, and found the entire service staff lined up at the entrance waiting for us.  At 6PM, they all welcomed us at once with a loud \\"IRASSHAIMASE!\\", which is an honorary welcome in Japanese custom, and bowed.  The hostess greeted everyone individually and handed us off to our servers, which took us to our seats.  Nori Nori spaces people out throughout the restaurant for customers' comfort.  Our server walked us through the buffet section by section and explained it to us, then got our drinks.  She stayed at a distance and watched the valuables I left on the table, and while we were eating she bussed our plates quickly and kept my water full at all times.  Very friendly, very attentive.  The kind of service I would leave a 30% tip for.  \\n\\nATMOSPHERE:\\n\\nModern, Japanese-y.  Nice for a buffet restaurant.  Adult contemporary BGM.\\n\\nCOST:  $29.50 per person (dinner)\\n\\nVALUE:  Excellent for what you get.\\n\\nVERDICT:\\n\\n4.5/5 with a nod to 5.  Relative to the Atlanta area, Nori Nori is 5-star; but would be a \\"4\\" compared to restaurants filling similar niches in other major cities with a strong Japanese cultural presence (like Hakone in Honolulu).

The menu looked great and after reading the reviews, we were excited to finally find a night to try it out.\\n\\nThe first point I want to make is the service (hostess and waitress) is impeccable.  Our waitress was one of the best I have ever had - including having eaten at many high end restaurants.  Clearly, the ownership puts a lot of attention on how their customers are treated by staff and to be honest, it's a relief because you just don't seem to get that too often anymore.  \\n\\nLike I stated earlier, the menu reads very well... there's quite a bit of \\"fluff\\" and an attempt at fancy \\"chef\\" wording mixed with meal descriptions translated into Italian (which is typical) but the execution is severely lacking.  \\n\\nWe started with the Antipasto Misto - a typical starter that could be just about anything.  The \\"mixed olives\\" were served hot... ok but kind of odd?  The \\"caponata\\" was like eggplant baby food and did not have any sweet or sour taste that is required for caponata.  The burrata was good as was the crostini.  Giardiniera is served but there's no spiciness, just a couple of very tart vegetables.  The worst part was the menu states the appetizer comes with sopressata and capicola - we were served boiled ham and salami. And the \\"prosciutto wrapped artichoke\\" that we were most excited about - you are served 1 tiny artichoke that was hard and I have no clue what the meat was (wasn't prosciutto by any means).  So all in all, sounded great on the menu but horrendously executed.  \\n\\nMy son ordered off the kids menu and opted for the Spaghetti with Meatballs.  Notice the \\"s\\" at the end of Meatballs, as in plural, as in more than 1.  How many did it actually come with?  Yep - 1 meatball, along with your typical pile of spaghetti topped with bland/tasteless tomato sauce.  So literally $1.50 at best worth of food for $8.00.  My son said the meatball tasted ok but nothing special.  Menu reads well, horrible execution.\\n\\nMy wife ordered the Pollo Guiseppe.  It was decent, but again extremely lacking of flavor.  It reads very well on the menu and you're expecting something pretty tasty but the sausage was boiled, chicken I'm assuming was sauteed but no coloring, the broccoli rabe was almost non-existent and the sauce was just blah.  She ate about 40% and took the rest home. \\n Once again, horrible execution on something that reads like a signature dish.\\n\\nI opted for the Vitello Sorrentino.  Anyone that has had good quality veal knows it should almost melt in your mouth and should never, ever be chewy.  This came with 3 small pieces of veal topped with a very thin and fried piece of eggplant, prosciutto and melted mozzarella.  I ate the first piece of veal - was like chewing on shoe leather.  Thought maybe it was just an abnormality and cut into the 2nd piece... even worse.  The \\"Sherry Wine sauce\\" was tasteless, with a pool of oil at the bottom of the dish - no seasoning at all.  I sent the entire thing back and didn't reorder.  As we explained to the waitress everything was bland and veal should not be like leather.  Extremely poor execution.  \\n\\nThe most frustrating part of the entire night is this is a new restaurant - one that all indications make you believe they care about the customers and want people to come back.  If a dish is being sent back and the customer is refusing to re-order because that dish was so bad, you would think an owner,manager or the chef (if they have one) would come out and talk to the customer.  Didn't happen.  It's as if they know better and speaks volumes of an establishment.  \\n\\nI'm very confused over the high ratings by others - maybe expectations are different for some.  If you're an Olive Garden fan, I'm sure you will be impressed by this place.  If you're expecting high quality, and properly executed preparations - I'd recommend going elsewhere (not that we have too many options in Lake Mary).  Or maybe they'd be better served just being a Pizza joint... seems the majority of their pictures revolve around Pizza which might be very good.  \\n\\nAll in all, was a huge disappointment."},{"name":"U & I Thai Fine Cuisine","address":"3364 Cambie Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"My wife and I love this place for a few reasons. 1.

For an amazing soup, we go for the Tom Kha Goong, a coconut milk soup with prawns and an infusion of flavours.\\n\\nWhen you think of Thai food, you think of Pad Thai.

Upon arrival, we were greeted by a server inside who told us to sit anywhere as they have table service. We took a seat in the backyard garden at a table recently vacated.\\n\\n20 minutes went by while we waited for a server to approach us, so we started to actively look for one and try to get anyone's attention. I finally was able to flag down a female server (who was taking orders of tables nearby who arrived after we did) and asked \\"Are you our server?\\". She said \\"No, but I could be, what can I get you?\\" (note: no apology for the long wait). We were thrilled to finally order drinks and looking forward to them. She also cleaned up maybe one glass from our still un-bussed table.\\n\\nAnother 15 minutes went by, and our server passed by multiple times, without acknowledging that we were still waiting, while she passed drinks to other tables (which btw, were the wrong drinks, they told us). She came back eventually and asked to \\"confirm\\" our drink orders. We thought it was any moment now....\\n\\nStill, another 15 minutes went by without any drinks, and no acknowledgement of this fact or event a sympathetic glance. I flagged down another server and very nicely and calmly let him know that we had been waiting nearly an hour for a drink, and we were a little disappointed and considering leaving. His immediate response was an excuse about how there were only two servers and they were super busy (no apology, again). Because he didn't offer this up initially, we had to *ask* him to go check on our drink progress. By this time the whole experience was laughable and we were asking ourselves why we had waited so long.\\n\\nSo we set a 10 minute timer on our phone (by this point, waiting over an hour), and said if our drinks aren't out in ten minutes, we're leaving. The timer went off without any further word from either server, and we were outta there. \\n\\nThen we went to Stay Gold which was AMAZING and if you are considering going to Weather Up, don't, go to Stay Gold. You'll thank us later.\\n\\nWe understand when bars get very busy (we've both been servers) it's hard to keep serve time  short.

The spicy sauce they have on the table (not sure what it was but it was red and thin) went really well with the calamari. Marinara sauce cost $1 extra but the dish didn't need it. \\n\\nThe entrees we got were incredible. My clams linguine was so flavored and garlicky.

In honor of its namesake, of course, I had the Island Creek oysters from the raw bar.  They were dreamy.  So soft and silky they could be slurped down without a bite.  But chew I would, not as a necessity but as a vehicle to unleash and savor more of the sublime ocean fresh flavor.  Back home in the SF Bay Area, we have good fare from the Hog Island Oyster Co., but they pale in comparison.  The SF oyster version just isn't as tantalizingly tender.  And now, thanks to Island Creek, I'm probably ruined forever for $1 Happy Hour oysters anywhere.\\n\\nAnother must-try:  It's highly rated Clam Chowder.   This was creamy and subtle with a well-orchestrated, multi-facet of flavors.  It's hard to describe because I've never had anything like it in back home in California.  I don't know if this was quintessential Boston Clam chowder.  I just know it was the best I've ever had.  The only point off, being that the wonderfully plentiful chunks of clam were a bit on the chewy side.  The clams in the chowder at Legal Crossing were more tender, though the flavor of its soup wasn't on par with Island Creek's.\\n\\nAlso tried the Seafood Casserole, which frankly wasn't overly impressive.  It was a simple medley of seafood dumped into a light soup base.   The seafood, which included huge chunks of lobster, was unquestionably fresh; it just wasn't accented with anything to enhance its flavor.\\n\\nFrom all the Yelp raves, I had to try the Lobster Roe Noodles.  Surprisingly, there was also a generous portion of the braised short rib, so it qualified as a versatile surf-and-turf dish.  My only complaint was that one of a couple of the big lobster bites was over-grilled and dry.  But otherwise the lobster and beef blended perfectly with the noodles as an ideal blend of flavor and texture.\\n\\nThe only other knock was the long wait for food.  It took about 30 minutes between the oysters and the entr√©e to arrive.\\n\\nBut, all in all, such a pristine experience, it still merits 5 stars."},{"name":"Kevin Rathbun Steak","address":"154 Krog St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Great food.

There were not many flavors outside of \\"heat\\" and I enjoy spicy food. But this was a sorry excuse for \\"Mex\\" food.

The pepper steak was so/so, I was expecting black pepper but it was really only bell peppers. All in all some solid food. We saw many other good looking dishes pass our table, that I'd like to try. The only thing lacking was the service. It was pretty awful. We had to get up at least 3x to find our waitress or ask for her. It wasn't even that busy.

(It's a bit of a trade off for efficiency, I suppose).\\n\\nThe decor is one that is clean and well kept. It has a gloominess of the typical steakhouse in its color-scheme, but the openess from windows and open-kitchen gives it a warm-feel. Definitely recommend for a third-fifth date. Excellent for kids (just be mindful of the hot plates!\\n\\nWe ordered the Kobe Burger with Egg and the Pepper Steak Rice.  The Kobe Burger was very moist, the garlic margarine was spectacular in enhancing the pepper flavors. (I wish they gave a bit more with the veggies). It also comes with a bowl of rice. The Pepper Steak Rice had a mount of rice with garlic margarine in the middle, slices of steak on the side. Personally I felt there was not enough steak and mostly just peppered rice. My recommendation is to mix the rice with the sauces and keep the rice on the hot plate, (some delicious crunchy rice). \\n\\nAs for the quantity of the meal, for someone who eats small portions, it was pushing on too much (due to the rice). For an average male, it would be described as \\"just hitting the spot\\" for a lunch. :) Again, the pepper rice meals are lacking in protein which was disappointing.\\n\\nAs for price, it's whats expect of the area you're in.

But she mentioned that a few years back she at at this place with a green awning, although she couldn't remember the name. After wandering around for 15 minutes or so, we came upon The Daily Catch's green awning and saw a line that started about 10 people or so back from the door to the place.\\n\\nI was a bit worried about having to wait, but we were on line for no more than half an hour, quite good for that time of day in one of the busiest tourist sections of Boston. Once inside, I was taken back a bit by the size of the restaurant; at most there were 8 tables, seating maybe 20 people (at most). The chef was also a bit worrisome as well; an Asian chef in an Italian seafood restaurant? I'm half-Chinese and half-Italian myself, and this made me question our decision to eat there.\\n\\nDespite all of my reservations, my worries were put to rest once the food came. We each ordered a different sauce with the homemade black pasta the Daily Catch serves. Mine was cooked in a calamari and anchovy garlic sauce and she ordered her's with a chopped squid sauce. Both were delicious! And at $21 a plate for a HUGE portion, a relative bargain! Keeping with the odd asian influences, we took home the rest of our food in those white Chinese food takeout containers.\\n\\nI'll definitely be coming back here again. The only suggestion I would have for the Daily Catch would be to work to remedy their space problem. Our table was squeezed into the corner of the restaurant, actually placed on top of a wall build out that completely prevented us from putting out feet underneath the table.

We were right next to Weather Up, and Yelp had some negative reviews about it, so we decided our discovery mission won't be complete unless we prove or defeat some Yelper's myths. \\nHere we go. \\nMyth # 1: Slow service. False. \\nWhen we got in, the place was busy. All outside tables were taken, so we sat at the bar. It took the bartender a minute to give us the menu, but we got our beers very quickly. At that moment one of the tables opened up and we moved to it. There was no problem to transfer our check from the bar. The food showed up faster than we expected. We had our water refilled on time and the check came out minutes after we asked for it. Our server helped me pick a cocktail (we normally don't drink liquors, but their list looked so good) and his recommendation was spot on. I'm sure every day is different and some people get less lucky, but to me the service was just right. \\nMyth # 2: Beautiful patio. True. \\nThe outside seating area is big and pretty. It's great for both romantic dinner and group night out. It gets pretty loud though as the night progresses, but hey, that's why we go out - to avoid silence!\\nMyth # 3: Small plates. False. \\nIt's coming from European perspective. I firmly believe in reasonable portions, not getting stuffed and enjoying every meal (which means being hungry for the next one). I guess if you order olives or mussels, it won't be enough. We ordered fried green tomato sandwich (it was very bready and very big) and some kind of spaghetti (very decent portion for one person). Good thing we decided not to split 3 plates. I want to come back and try their brunch too. It seems very interesting. \\nMyth # 4: Bugs (inspired by one of the earlier reviews). True and False. \\nThere were no bugs in the glasses, drinks or food as someone said in their review earlier. I didn't see anything that would make me freak out (and I am a big bug hater, I usually panic when I see a fly). That being said, I saw one of those scary Texas cockroaches in the patio. It was far away from the bar or restaurant entrance. I guess it's their prime time now. And when you want to enjoy this nice weather, they want to enjoy it too. So I got over it. \\nMyth #5 Cocktails are great and pricey. True.\\nI had the Trade Wind and it was amazing. My significant other had French something. It was very tasty too. Balanced and flavorful. That being said, they also cost 10-15$ each. Maybe I'm too used to prices for wine and beer? \\n\\nOverall my experience was very positive. It's a great place to hang out with friends and enjoy some craft cocktails. I'll be back! =)"},{"name":"Baraka Cafe","address":"812 Memorial Dr","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"The lamb shank was a bit too gamey for me but I tried my friend's vegetarian plate and it was excellent.

And I'm glad we did!!\\n\\nThe  small shop is run by a family from New Orleans (hence the Po' Boys), and both of our meals were authentic, delicious, and very filing. My wife ordered the spicy falafel, which had a nice kick to it, and my chicken sharwarma was one of the better ones I've had in recent memory. They even do combo meals with a soda and side (hummus, baba ghanoush, etc), which makes this place a great deal when you find yourself in the mood for some falafel goodness."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This restaurant was recommended by serval locals so I decided to give it a try since it was within walking distance from my hotel. First let me say the decor was really nice (I don't typically review the interior and exteriors of restaurants, but this one had this very chic design and made me feel like I was in a real Texas saloon lol). Okay anyways, back to the important stuff, food and drinks.  Fortunately I arrived during happy hour and I was able to order the house sangria and a margarita, both of them were delicious. To eat I ordered the chicken fried steak w/mac and cheese as a side. Let's start with the mac and cheese was very underwhelming, not special at all. Now the chicken fried steak was ok, better than the mac and cheese, but it wasn't something that I'd be dreaming and salivating about, it was just ok. Oh they served these mini cornbreads and they were good, had a little kick to it too.\\n\\nOverall, the dining experience was great. Between the restaurants chic and vibrant atmosphere, delicious drinks, and ok food, I had a good time.

The food was delicious, tasty, comfort food. The menu reads a little bit on the healthy side, but the items we had were far from health nut food!  For example, the kale dip is actually a little bit of kale with a lot of cheese and bacon...oh my, so yummy!  The chicken tender salad was absolute heaven....something about the dressing....can't quite put my finger on it.  And the chicken was fried in corn flakes and sesame seeds.

Five minutes later, I still didn't receive my order when I watched people come in, order and then get their food before me.

My friends and I are lovers of Thai and Asian food in general, and heard great things. I'm glad we went but a few of the dishes were not up to par IMHO. \\n\\nThe good: \\nPork Salad w the noodles was my fav dish! Very flavorful and well done. \\nFish Sauce Wings - tasty but we ordered spicy cuz the waiter said there were not very spicy but oh yes they were! Even so they were delicious and I'd order again although at the mild level. \\n\\nThe Okay: \\nCatfish La Vong - cooked well if a tad bland - which was odd with all the stuff it says it comes with on the menu. It was better when we added some sauce that was on the table from one of the other dishes.  \\n\\nThe not so great: \\nKha Soi - I LOVE Kha Soi and order it just about anywhere I see it listed on the menu. I had HIGH hopes for it at Pok Pok but was disappointed at first taste as it was very watery, thin and highly lacking in flavor. It did have lots of chicken in it (w the bone) which was a plus but didn't make up for the lack of flavor.  \\n\\nThai Iced Tea -- very off, weird taste to it - didn't taste like Thai Iced tea at all. I have been to Thailand and was addicted to Thai iced tea there and this was probably the worst version I've ever tried. Perhaps it was just off that night but I couldn't even get through the one glass,  \\n\\nService was good but nothing spectacular. We waited about an hour - told us 90mins so it was less than quoted. The ambiance on the outdoor patio is very nice but the inside of the house is very very small and they CRAM you in. We couldn't even pull the chair out to sit down - had to ask the guy behind if he would mind standing for a minute. Tip: ask to sit outside. \\n\\nNot sure if I'd go back - it is a bit of a trek from downtown Portland and it's also seemed a tad bit overpriced to me.  If anything I'd maybe get some wings and a noodle dish \\"to go\\" as I'm not sure it's worth the wait."},{"name":"Clay Oven Indian Cuisine","address":"7696 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"Food was really good..

While the food was generally still good (I'll explain), our service was surprisingly off.  We arrived on time and were seated and our waiter came by and introduced himself.  It was some time before we saw him again when he then explained specials.  We decided on our meal and waited a good bit before he came and took our order.  We ordered salads and I chose the pork while my husband and son split the dry aged beef for two.  We also ordered two sides - mac and cheese and the stuffed potato special for the day.  \\n\\nWe got our salads and I got the spinach salad which is billed as having egg but I could not find any- or whatever the salad was topped with was such tiny pieces I could not have told you what they were.  The dressing was pretty tart.  We then waited a lot longer and probably had 3 water refills but no sign of food.  Our waiter came by at one point and put two plates before my husband and son so we anticipated our meal would come shortly.  More time elapsed and finally our waiter came and swapped those plates out because they 'were not hot enough.'  Of course not, they would be stone cold by then.  Still no food - no way the plates were warm - and finally they brought their steak.  My pork followed, along with the mac n cheese.  No potato.  My pork, which I had before, is billed with kale and grits.  I had about 1 teaspoon of grits on the plate, artfully arranged.  On our previous visit I ordered the pork, which may not be the same dish but it also came with kale and grits so I'm guessing it was the same.  I had a small but decent serving of grits the last time but this was nothing like that.  I spoke to the waiter and he said it is only for a garnish; it seemed odd but he offered to bring me some grits, which I accepted (the menu doesn't indicate this is only a garnish).  I also mentioned we still did not have our potato and by this time we were halfway through our meal.  \\n\\nThey brought out the grits - which were delicious but we never got the potato until we were finished with our meal and it was a little burned on the skin.  The waiter did not charge us for the potato and he did offer without us asking.  My pork was delicious and the steak was good but the salad and potato were just ok and the service surprisingly poor.  I didn't feel like it was our waiter as much as it was the kitchen.  The restaurant was pretty full but there seemed to be no shortage of wait staff.  All in all the meal was tasty but I expected a lot more for my 50+ dollars a head.  If this had been the original anniversary dinner I would have really been upset and no way would I ever return."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great food with a range of flavor that is really unique.

I know that you will thank me if you take this review to heart. This new Thai restaurant is on Lee Rd, at a traffic light, across from Kingswood Blvd (Kingswood Manor Subdivision)., next to a short strip mall containing an Amscot, a Little Caesars, a Fedex, and a few other stores. \\nI was getting my nails done and I asked my tech if they tried the new Thai place next door. She said that her husband (the salon owner) eats there  regularly, and says it is very good. (They are Vietnamese.) \\nIt is called Mee Thai, and it has been moving in and decorating for a couple of months now, in a small stand-alone building that was previously a latin food joint, didn't last long. \\n\\"Mee Thai\\" is delicious.  Sooo fresh, great portion size, and a very varied menu. I am telling all of my friends about it, and after I finish this review, I am going in again tonight for takeout. I started with the cheese rolls, as an appetizer. It is three very well filled fried rolls(as if for spring rolls), but didn't taste the oil, and stuffed with a pure tasty cream cheese, and served with a dipping sweet and sour dipping sauce. They didn't even make it home! Then I had the sweet and sour beef with vegetables, including pineapple and tomato, and other fresh vegetables, with a large serving of aromatic fluffy rice on the side, and the sauce was medium spice, but next time I will tell them a bit milder for me. It didn't stop me, though, the flavors and freshness were so enticing. I am done with Chinese, from now on it is Thai all the time. Tonight I will do a Pad Thai Basil or something like that. The young ladies explained many items for me, and even showed me pictures on their cell phones of their dishes cooked for others! Honestly, I loved this place. Prices were very decent, and I got two servings out of  the dinner portion. The entree and rice was $10.95, and that appetizer was $3. Seafood was $2 more, and without meat was $2 less, I believe. They had at least 5 or 6 traditional desserts on the menu, and beverages, but last night I was all about getting home with the meal.

The two wait staff were attentive and did a good job...first problem was when my friend ordered a Rob Roy up, with Well scotch.  It arrived and was obviously the wrong color.  The bartender had used dry vermouth!  Any bartender, especially in an upscale restaurant, should know how to prepare this drink.  We had to tell the waiter how to make it.  My other friend's steak sandwich arrived, she had ordered medium and it was obviously cooked well and was tough.  That went back as well.  She reordered crab cakes.  I had the French onion soup, which was very good, and the crab cake sandwich which was okay.  Another friend had the black and blue Caesar and loved it.  Another had a spinach salad with wilted spinach.  The inconsistency was troubling.  We arrived at about 1 pm, and the place was very quiet.

I do like that they text you when the table is ready so you can grab a drink while you wait.

It was good but a little too creamy for my taste. My boyfriend ordered the chicken wings, which he absolutely loved and the Het Paa Naam Tok, a mushroom salad. I'm not a big mushroom fan so I thought it was okay but it was very flavorful. He said the spices and flavor were similar to the steak version, which he was really impressed with. The vegetarian alternative might be a good option if you're trying to become a vegetarian or just need a break from meat. I ordered the Khao Soi (vegetarian), a curry noodle soup. The broth was absolutely amazing - spicy and flavorful. The coconut milk cut the spiciness so it was a good touch. The crispy noddles on top were an excellent addition to the soup.

Were told they were out of the bottle I ordered and a suggestion of a similar (and more expensive) bottle was made. I accepted the suggestion but when it arrived it was the brand but not the year I was told. I'm not a wine snob but if you are going to recommend a wine... have exactly what you recommend. Ordered the steak for two. It took an hour and 10 minutes to get to the table. That is not an exaggeration. I checked my watch and made a note of it. The waitress came to our table twice to apologize and to let us know it would be arriving soon.  When it arrived it was lukewarm at best as if it had been resting for quite some time. It was still very tasty however. Of course by the time we got the entree we had finished the wine since we had an hour to hover over it with only some bread. Didn't really want to buy another bottle at that point so didn't have wine with the actual meal. We were offered free deserts for the wait. Nice gesture but we came for the steak, paid $100 for the steak, and the steak was very disappointing.

They typically have a line in front of the Hanover location that can span about an hour.  They deliver the food in a saucepan.

Their fried calamari was good.  Overall, not worth the wait.

He was very nice, welcoming, and thoughtful. He gave us alot of time to figure out what we wanted to order because honestly the menu was so confusing for us to look at during the first glance. We ended up ordering the Thai tenderloin dish, the mediterranean mussels for appetizer, cup of tomato soup, and the pasta prim dish. \\n\\nThe mussels were appetizing and the atmosphere was nice and warm (taking into consideration that we got to sit outside near the fireplace). \\n\\nHowever my review can't be a 4 or 5 stars only because we weren't so pleased with all of our orders. Jude was very very nice. He did nothing wrong. But the problem was mainly that 3/4 orders were wayyyyy too sweet to the point that my husband and I couldn't fully finish it. My husband even made a joke and said maybe the chef had an extreme sweet tooth that night. But even though i know that the menu description for the tomato soup said \\"sweet creamy blah blah blah\\" in it. I couldn't have prepared myself for THAT much sweetness in a tomato soup. Like honest to god it was as sweet as glazed frosting. My pasta prim was also THAT sweet and poor Jude knew that I couldn't finish my soup because of the sweetness so when he brought the pasta out, he asked me to try it and really get the pasta and the sauce to see if I liked it. \\n\\nSeeing his patience and thoughtfulness I decided I was going to tough it out and simply asked him for salt and pepper so that I can season it to my taste and that was all. I didn't want to say omg it's as sweet as the soup (because it's made from the same sauce apparently) and have him bring it back or give me something different. I didn't want to be a fuss. \\n\\nMy husband's thai tenderloin dish was also very sweet. The sweet sauce soaked into the rice and it was very hard for him to swallow that much sweetness all at once. \\n\\nOverall my review has to be 3 stars because the environment was very warm, relaxing, and welcoming. Jude was also very nice and professional. Hence my 3 stars for service and environment.

But in one day, I can understand why everyone I know who has been to Boston loves it, and ICOB was a fantastic way to end the first day.\\n\\nFirstly, can I just tell you, my girlfriend is just the world's best at researching places in new cities.  Not everywhere we went was 4 or 5 stars, but she should start a vacation consulting firm where she does all of your research for you and tells you where to go.  No one would ever have a bad vacation again.  She did all of the research on this one, and there wasn't a single bad option.\\n\\nAnyway, this was originally supposed to be for lobster rolls for lunch, but they don't serve lunch, so we ended up at Neptune's instead for lunch and came back for dinner.  Yes, for more lobster rolls.  Listen, when in Boston, do as Bostonians do, which is eat lobster rolls for every meal.  It's like the old slim fast diet, where you have a shake for breakfast and lunch, and a regular meal for dinner, only in this case, its lobster rolls twice a day, and I suppose a regular breakfast...or a third lobster roll.\\n\\nWe were almost screwed, and this almost became a very different review.  When we sat down, we were told they ran out of the rolls for the lobster rolls.  I almost cried.  The disappointment was huge, but then our server came back like superman and saved the day by telling us they made more rolls.  Whew - close call.\\n\\nI gave Neptune's 4 stars because I liked this one better.  This was the 5 star roll to me.  And what was the difference?  Rosemary.  The rolls here are warm rosemary rolls, and I loved the extra touch.  Still the same warm delicious lobster with lots of melted buttery goodness, but the addition of the rosemary into the rolls added another flavor that for me, put this one over the top.  Melissa actually liked Neptune's better, and I am sure many Bostonians would like to kill me for this comparison, but I like what I like, and I liked both a lot, but I loved this one more.  \\n\\nI can't think of a single problem with ICOB.  Service was great.  Our drinks were wonderful.  She got a Montalban made with tequila and mezcal, and I got the Wildwood made with Rye and absinthe.  I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but daaaaammmmnnnn, Boston can make a good drink.  And the restaurant itself is just cool.  Classy, upscale, and comfortable.  Just a place you want to stay at once you sit down.\\n\\nAllow me to end this review with a happy noise.  WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!  Thank you, kind people of Boston, for supporting this restaurant long enough to allow me to come here and have a lobster roll.  My life would still have been good, full of the love of a wonderful woman, the support of a wonderful family, good friends and a good job.  But somewhere deep inside - and I may have never noticed it - there would have been an empty pit where ICOB should have been.  Somewhere in an alternative universe, there is a version of me who, perhaps, after trying to come here for lunch, never made it back for dinner.  That version will forever be slightly less happy than this one."},{"name":"Life Alive","address":"765 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"I wish I could visit this place again because I think it needs two visits to really give it justice.  \\n\\nIt seems a little out of place.

All items are mediocre, with the exception of the banh hoi which is decent, and the claypot fish which is awful. \\n\\nThe prices were exorbitant (about double the cost of Buford Highway Vietnamese restaurants) with 1/4 of the quality. The menu is quite deceptive as some of the prior reviews have indicated. They list the price of an item without meat, which appears reasonable and comparable to what you would find on Buford Highway, then you add the meat and it can double in price. Who does that? \\n\\nThe fact that this place gets busy is really surprising. Do people in Dunwoody realize they are spending twice the amount of money and getting less back then they would elsewhere in the Atlanta Metro? I can't figure it out. \\n\\nAs we were leaving, we ask the server who I met at the bar earlier about whether one of the guys there was the owner, and he seems annoyed by the question, and mentions something about how that's his cousin, without really answering the question.    \\n\\nNot much reason to come back here in the future."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is really great!

We're not even going to talk about how many times I ate macarons when I was in France but I did hit up the two major players in the mac game: Laduree and Pierre Herme. After that they really blew up around here, and I started trying them around town. I think West Egg's the only one I haven't tried for macarons. So when I saw Daniel B's review earlier, I made plans to go to Lenox despite the fact I was just there Monday. Oh and I went to Sephora and Macy's and somehow didn't even notice this place off to the side. When you see it, you'll get why.\\n\\nIn my expert opinion these are the best you are going to get around here. Second would be a tie between Alon's and Maison Robert. After you have these you can definitely tell which ones have been previously frozen when you think back on biting into the shell...\\n\\nThe macarons are all pre-packaged which I don't see as a big deal because then I have less decisions to have to make. This isn't some unheard of, weird thing, this is precisely how I bought some at a patisserie in Strasbourg, France, too. Of course in this case I still had to decide on a bag, but at least I couldn't get more! I got: red velvet, key lime, strawberry shortcake, vanilla, and coconut. \\n\\nI was so going to save a few but I failed miserably.\\n\\nThey were great, a hard shell on the outside gives way to a soft interior. They had good looking feet. no cracking, no pointy spots. They're not overly sweet, and there was the perfect amount of filling. \\n\\nOut of these five I don't even know how to pick a favorite! The key lime was okay, it was pretty delicately flavored so it was probably my least favorite. My favorite is Pierre Herme so if you ever get to try one of those you will understand how I could think the key lime was not flavorful. I liked the strawberry shortcake, it had a mix of vanilla bean ganache and strawberry jam. The vanilla was of course every good too, I always like a vanilla where I can see the specks of vanilla in there. The red velvet one was awesome too.

I'd make it part of my trip when I visited Tampa (this is going WAY back).    Now it's right near where I work and I go there about 3 times a month.\\nIt's healthy food (for the most part) and it tastes pretty fresh.  \\n\\nLet me tell you how I do Sweet Tomatoes.\\n\\nSALAD:  I start with two plates at the salad bar because I don't want to go through twice - nor do I want to heap one plate so high that everything mixes together or tends to fall off.  The two-plate system works like this:  \\nPlate 1 is for my standard salad... romaine, spinach, tomato, cucumber, feta, carrots, etc.   Sometimes the specialty dressings of the month are good - like right now it's Berry Month and they do a strawberry vinaigrette.  If not, then the roasted garlic dressing is my standby.   \\nPlate 2 is for the Specialty Salads they have at the front of the line.   The Wonton Chicken Happiness with tasty peanut dressing and other similar items.   Putting them on a separate plate preserves the unique character of their flavor.    I also put any potato salad, couscous, pasta salad, rice salad, bean salad, etc. on this plate.  \\n\\nSOUP:  Most of their soups are decent and I'll have one or two servings throughout the meal.   The chili is an every day item on the soup bar.  The cream of mushroom is good.   The chicken lime chili is good.  Their New England clam chowder isn't the best.  It has bacon in it (to trick you into thinking you're getting more clams?).  I love me some bacon - but not necessarily in clam chowder.  \\nPOTATO BAR:  I've never had a potato here.  Maybe I'll mix it up one day and get one.   Just seems like it would fill me up too much and I wouldn't eat the other stuff.\\n\\nPASTA BAR:  Not the strongest feature of Sweet Tomatoes.  Any of their pastas with a cream or cheese-based sauce is usually horrible.  Their Mac and Cheese isn't good.  Their alfredo sauce tastes like Elmer's glue.  The marinara-style or vegetable-based sauces are much better.  Stick with those... they're healthier too!\\n\\nPIZZAS AND BREADS:  \\nI like their pizza.  I work a few small slices into the mix when I visit.   But the crown jewel of my visit is their cornbread.  You know Chris Rock said \\"Cornbread... ain't nothin' wrong with that!\\" and I agree.  I put some of the honey-whipped butter on the cornbread and that's a great way for me to top off the meal.  \\n\\nDESSERT:    Yes, they offer soft-serve ice cream and toppings to make a sundae.   I imagine they are good - but I always feel like I've defeated the entire purpose of the whole healthy meal thing if a shovel down a bowl of ice cream afterwards.   I usually consider the cornbread my dessert and end it there.  \\n\\nIf you join their e-mail club - Club Veg - they send weekly coupons which brings the price down considerably... from \\"I paid HOW much for salad?\\" to \\"Decent price for a healthy all-you-can-eat lunch\\""},{"name":"Sushi Kiku","address":"2770 Lenox Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm a big fan of sushi, so I was really excited to try this place!

Pork chitterling and mustard green soup\\nWhen I ordered this dish I didn't know it was a soup. So I was surprised when I got the dish. I did not enjoy this as much as the other dishes.

But if you're in the mood for something more bold, the spicy miso ramen will not dissapoint.

We went with the not-spicy version, and they were super magically delicious, sticky and sweet, perfectly grilled and wonderful. (I went again just last week and got the spicy version--I agree with a previous reviewer, the spice masks a lot of the flavor, so you may want to go with the regular version first, unless you're ready for a LOT of spice!)

This place is so very pretty with all the ambiance you can tell someone really thought this place out, architecturally speaking. \\n\\nOur server was great, when we flagged down the bus boy for menu suggestions he happily shared his favorite dish with us. \\nIt's hard to find great service these days but ALAS it's still alive and well after all! \\n\\nWe ordered the French Dip and Antelope burger both were very yummy we even shared a bite with each other! \\n\\nWe sat outside and it looks like they have live music. This would be a great spot to have a few cocktails and enjoy some music on a summer night. \\n\\nTheir drink menu has lots of specialty drinks and cocktails. I tried the White Hate Blueberry Mojito it was a bit weak on the alcohol but that's okay it was late afternoon! The mix was very refreshing and exactly what a Mojito should be; simple yet delicious! \\n\\nOverall, it was a pleasant experience and I will definitely go back.

Knowing my love for good steak, my fianc√© was kind enough to treat me here last August for my birthday.\\n\\nLet me start with the primer that I'm always extremely skeptical about spending money at steakhouses. They usually end up places that over charge for huge portions and subpar meat. Take for example all the Outbacks, Longhorns, and Roadhouses which are littered across the country. Usually never worth the trip and makes me feel bad for the poor cattle that had to sacrifice their lives to perpetuate America's obesity problem with rubbery tasteless chunks of leather.\\n\\nSteakhouse fine dining at places like Rathbun's (and Chops or Bones for that matter) on the other hand is a meat lover's heaven. Please don't go here unless you love a good Steak. Don't go here and order a salad either. It'd be like going to Fogo De Chao's meat buffet as a vegan or going to Fox Bros BBQ as a strict Muslim.\\n\\nThe food was simply amazing. In fact, probably one of the best meals I've ever had.  We started our meal with the Ahi Poke. It was a great interpretation of Japanese cuisine with a surprisingly fresh tuna sashimi which is usually uncommon of American restaurants. A lot of other tables were ordering it too so I'm sure it's one of their big sellers.\\n\\nFor the main, I enjoyed a huge 22 oz dry aged, bone-in ribeye topped with fois gras. I'd definitely recommend this cut over the wagyu which was only offered in a strip steak or the typical, boring tenderloin / filet mignon. I might have been swayed toward the wagyu if they had it as a ribeye. What made the cowboy ribeye so delicious was the cut and breed they used which I'm sure was full of heart-attack inducing, fat-filled marbling. This resulted in a drool-worthy. melt-in-your-mouth, tenderness that when combined with the delicious nuttiness, blue cheesyness, and umami packed flavor of a good dry aging, became the pinnacle of steak perfection. In the end, my only complaint would be the fois gras. It was tiny and difficult to enjoy balanced with the huge steak. I'd recommend alternatively trying the fois gras butter which should be a bit cheaper and allow for the flavor to spread across the whole cut.\\n\\nWe concluded the dinner with a couple desserts, one complementary to celebrate my birthday (a baked Alaska) and the bon bon's. We probably only ate, at most, half of each. Both were tasty but not something worth focusing on especially for a steak house review. I'll leave readers up to trying them out if they dare but frankly after indulging on a huge steak, it's hard to have room for such rich sweets.\\n\\nEven after half a year while I type this review, I still cherish the memorable dinner we had here and would recommend any meat lover give it a try. It'll truly redefine for many what it means to have a good steak. Sure, the prices are crazy - the steak with fois gras alone was over $70! But to get the chance to enjoy one of the best steaks I've had in my life, I'd definitely say Rathbun Steak was worth its price of admission."},{"name":"Sam LaGrassa's","address":"44 Province St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Was told by a local passers by that this is the best pastrami sandwich in Boston.

If you like Greek food you will love this place."},{"name":"Vivo Austin","address":"6406 N I 35, Ste 2343","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Like everyone else, I preferred the old Vivo. Who wouldn't? The old location was beautiful! That being said, they clearly put a lot of effort into this location and the interior, while missing that homey feel, is no less charming. They did the best with what they had and I have to give credit for that. \\n\\nThe cucumber margarita is still as delicious as I remember and, yes, they still serve it with an orchid. (My favorite part!) I ordered the shrimp enchiladas this time because I love shrimp and it's one of the only dishes on the menu that comes with white rice. (I hate brown rice.) It's a little pricy, but very good. The two enchiladas are huge and packed full of large, juicy shrimp, cheese, and smothered in a tasty green sauce. Sour cream is served on the side, if you want. The rice and beans were good, too. The portions are generous and I wasn't able to eat all of my food, despite my best effort. \\n\\nThe chips and salsa are excellent. Not my absolute favorite, but definitely up there in terms of tastiness. They keep that salsa flowing, too, so don't worry about shoveling it in your mouth. They'll refill it just as fast as you can eat it. \\n\\nSo, yes, it's not the same old location we all know and love, but it's the same drinks and tasty food I remember and that's what counts. I still think this is a great place to go for a date or if you're feeling like fancier Mexican food. I can't say I'll come back frequently, but I'll definitely be back."},{"name":"sweetgreen","address":"372 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"One of the things I love most about this place is consistency. I know exactly what I am going to get every single time I order no matter what location or state I am in. Great place to stop for a healthful and filling meal. Their lemonade and tastes are great too. Wonderful seasonal menu."},{"name":"Mee Thai Restaurant","address":"1200 Lee Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"5","text":"Amazing Panang curry! Tom yum very good as well. I see why it has 5 stars and it is a brand new restaurant. It is so clean inside and the silverware and dishes are all brand new. Food has great flavor. Curry is on of the best in town. I can't wait to go back to try more."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Fantastic food.

Friendly service, relaxing atmosphere.  My friend & I shared the chicken biriyani and the veggie curry.  Both were quite good but we probably needed to get something with less rice! Lol. Both dishes of course served with rice and we had naan bread...good grief it was a carb lovers delight!  The flavors were so good.  It would have been nice to have a lunch menu to order from since prices were a little high for lunch but certainly in line for dinner."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Misti was our waitress and she was exceptional. Our food was amazing. I had the shrimp and grits and my husband had the chicken fried steak with gravy and mashed potatoes. It was all delicious. We will absolutely and most definitely be back to eat here if we are ever in Austin again."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"I'm a book fanatic so this place is a dream come true. I always go here when I visit Portland... it's amazing. It's easy to find your way around because the rooms are color coded.\\n\\nDon't go here unless you plan to spend too much money. (What am I saying? you can never spend too much money on books!)\\n\\nParking is a little weird-- the structure really close by has tight corners. I remember that it took awhile to back out of some of the parking spaces, even with a small car. However, the store completely makes up for this problem. \\n\\nPlus they have coffee/ a cafe. It cannot get any better. I could spend all day here."},{"name":"The Vancouver Fish Company","address":"1517 Anderson St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Came during DOV and was an overall nice experience. My siblings (w SOs) and I were seated promptly with water and drink orders down quickly. We didn't have any grandeur view of the piers but the jazz in the background gave a nice ambiance to enjoy. \\n\\nI had the Maple Walnut Prawns, the Seafood Pot, and the Apple Crumble. The prawns had a nice bite to them, maybe could've used a bit more maple or walnut to them though. The boil was the largest of the 3 entrees (fact, also has the most carbs if you're interested) and had a nice variety of seafood, granted my disappointment here is with the overdone seafood and a slightly too salty nage. The apple crumble to me resembled not cooked-through enough cinnamon apples topped off with maybe? raw oats. It tasted good but texture wise was very disappointing. Yay though was the vanilla gelato on top of the crumble though.\\n\\nThe redeeming factor from 3 stars tonight was the service. Our waiter was very kind and was informative of letting us know that our food was coming up and apologized for any delays they had. Also cracked a couple of nice jokes that made me giggle a bit."},{"name":"Moderne Burger","address":"2507 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Always wondered why such a cool, old-school place like this was never crowded with hipsters as most retro-looking restaurants are. This place is definitely good - just not spectacular.\\n\\nThe burger was good but note that add-ons are extra. Fries were great, they were perfectly, deliciously greasy, but definitely share them if you're not a big eater!\\n\\nI have to admit one thing: the milkshake definitely sold me!! Especially the refill tin on the side.\\n\\nBut beware: the prices can add up quick! Sides like fries, additional toppings, and the delicious milkshakes can be costly. A meal for two people eventually added up to around $35. \\n\\nDefinitely good, but also definitely not the best. I'd say this isn't a place you'd make a trip out to dine at, more like your average, comfy neighborhood burger joint. I'd suggest dropping in to pick up milkshakes instead!"},{"name":"Finale","address":"1306 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3","text":"Ahhh....another overrated desserts spots in boston.
