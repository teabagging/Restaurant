I was pretty excited seeing a lot of food trucks on the list that I hadn't seen before, so we went down right after work on Friday.\\n\\nYou can pretty much expect long lines everywhere and limited parking. It really didn't seem worth trying to buy booze, since the lines were so long, so we just grabbed drinks in between at The Walrus. Little Palace and 16-Bit are right there too if you want to step away from the crowds for a bit.\\n\\nI love that there are food trucks from all over Ohio and not just Columbus. We had awesome jerk chicken sliders from Ena's Jerkmania from down in Cincinnati. I'd had most of the popular Columbus food trucks, so most of the lines I was in weren't very long, but if you're trying to stop in to the more well known ones, you'll probably have to wait. It's definitely worth going earlier rather than later at night.\\n\\nA fraction of the trucks are across the street in a parking lot making the sidewalks a little congested, and it's kind of dangerous since 3rd St. passes right through the middle of the festival. I saw someone almost hit by a car on Sunday.\\n\\nMy biggest let down was going back around noon on Sunday and seeing that almost all of the trucks had left, and the only ones still there were the ones that had set up shop in the parking lot. I understand that three days might be a commitment for everyone to keep the trucks down at the Commons, but what's the point of even having a third day then? You might as well just make it two. Since nothing on Sunday looked appealing, we ended up leaving a bit disappointed.\\n\\nI'll probably give it another shot next year just to try some of the newer trucks, but you're better off following the more popular ones on Twitter or Facebook and finding where they are during the week."},{"name":"Hidden Tasting Bar & Social Lounge","address":"433 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"It would be useful if they had replied earlier.

The salmon, on the other hand, was excellently tender.\\n\\nThe prices are a little stiff, but it /is/ \\"fine dining,\\" so I suppose you'll have to excuse them.

It smelled like a urinal and from my recent experience at another 99 it was already starting to seem like a bad night. Luckily that changed. \\n\\nAnother negative there was a waitress that were serving the tables around us and she was so loud and kept making me jump cause it would be quiet and she would walk behind us talking to the table that she was serving and basically scream towards where they were before she got there.

Yagoto did not disappoint. The server was sweet and paid me regular attention, though she was a little less attentive when I was ready to pay and move on. I got to sit by the chef and watch him craft my meal.\\n\\nI'd decided on Special A, which at $16, was a steal of a deal. Dinner consisted of miso soup, salad, gomaae (cooked spinach salad with sesame), sashimi, sushi, chicken teriyaki, and your choice of California or BC rolls. As much as I love California rolls, I opted for the BC roll because heck, I was in British Columbia after all.\\n\\nThe miso soup was slightly salty, and it didn't come with tofu. The salad was fine, complete with plenty of lettuce and ginger dressing. The BC roll consisted of salmon skin, cucumber, radish sprouts, and tobiko. No complaints at all, yum. The chef complied with my request for no wasabi on my concoctions. Fish was fresh and more than satisfactory. The teriyaki was perhaps not the most exciting thing, but it wasn't bad. \\n\\nSwell mom-and-pop, local sushi spot.

As I was looking over the menus, I noticed a bunch of wings that had been devoured by the people next to me. All I could find were duck wings (!!!) on the menu so I asked them just to make sure that's what they were and they offered me one. Never one to turn down free food, I tried it and was instantly happy, and grateful, that I had. I wasn't really in the mood for wings tonight though, but I'll order them next time.\\n\\nI ordered the Goose Island Urban Wheat beer and the seared statler chicken breast - both were excellent choices, I thought. The chicken came with pumpkin gnocchi, which kind of threw me for a loop at first since it's so sweet and seemed kind of odd to put with chicken, but it worked! I'm sure others would be turned off by the sweetness, but I've had a sweet tooth since birth that isn't going away anytime soon. It also came with Swiss chard, which was fantastic. And the bit of chicken skin was a nice added touch (or non-removal, maybe?).\\n\\nFor my next drink I ordered the Pumpkin on the Rye. Figured it would be pretty sweet and didn't want to overdue it on that front, so I finished all of my food but the gnocchi. The drink looked a little less-than-manly in the martini glass and with its orangey-pink color, but whatever. The bartender made it rather strong, and it wasn't quite as sweet as I had expected. It was good for the most part, though I probably wouldn't get it again.\\n\\nOverall a decent place. Felt like a took a little long to get the bartender's attention, but he seemed pretty busy.

First visit. Anyway good things first, Michael, Manager?, came by when we were about 1/2 finished with meal. He was very nice and informative. At that time all was \\"fine\\". Waiter was very nice and knowledgeable with menu. He said menu was new. We ordered fish & chips (we were actually on the way to Osprey to have theirs/we love), a ceasar salad and beer. We often split because we are not quantity foodies & we don't like take-homes. We asked if Buzz had sweet potato fries. Waiter said \\"yes\\" and we asked if we could have those instead of fries. Waiter's reply was \\"yes\\".  So, our order consisted of 3 fish sticks, sweet pot fries, caesar and beer (and later a $10 peanut butter/mouse pie). Here's the rub (& I will give Manager a chance to respond as well/only fair.) When we received our bill it was well over $40. I was amazed. After observing I found the sweet pot fries came in at $6.00 on top of the $14 fish & chips entree price. I suggested we ask for waiter. When he arrived, we asked what happened. He said \\"oh, sweet pot fries are a side item\\". No one told us that up front. Then I realized we did not get the fries that came with the entree.  Waiter said he was sorry.......we opted to save his face and pay. When I got home I got more aggresive because now I realized we paid $14 for 3 fish sticks. We did not get the regular fries that came with the entree. We are reasonable and fair people (and yes we still paid him 20% tip) but this is not right.\\nMy guest enjoyed the meal, I was not as pleased. Pretty common and somewhat greasy as I reviewed my experience. The peanut pie (although very, very expensive but we knew this) was fab. It was small but waiter said that \\"up front\\".

I had a sample of it, and it was delicious and refreshing. It was an excellent choice for a starter as it was not too rich, but it was flavourful with a nice balance of savoury, sweet, and refreshing acid. Then came their famous fried chicken wings which I thought were great, but I've had better version of it at Longtail, a Thai restaurant at the New West Quay Public Market. \\n\\nFor my main dish I ordered dried noodles, expecting it to be a thin rice or egg noodle with the sweet soy sauce, a hint of garlic, and all the pork fixings and scallions. Boy was I disappointed. Though the dish was similar and had most of the fixings, it tasted very one note. There was NO sweetness complimenting the savoury and so I thought my dish was just plain - well - salty. Now, I'm no expert on this type of cuisine and I my partner explained that this was a Cambodian version and who know, perhaps they are not a fan of the sweet. The Vietnamese are also know for making it a culinary art to balance the different dimensions of flavours, whereas other nations may prefer more of just one. This dish therefore is not my main reason for the lower rating. \\n\\nMy low rating is because of the EXCEPTIONALLY horrible service. Yes, many ethnic, and Asian restaurants are not known for their impeccable service, but this was worse than horrible service.

This feels like an interesting concept that fails in its execution.\\n\\nSiMB is located in a hipsteresque brick building next to the MARTA line. The building is nice, even if the surrounding area isn't exactly scenic. Parking seems to be limited to what you can find on the street, but it wasn't difficult to find a place. Despite being trendy in appearance, this facility needs some work. I was seated in the second dining room and it was uncomfortable. The dining room did not appear to be air conditioned--it was warm, humid, and the air was stagnant.\\n\\nUpon arriving, we were informed that it would be a 30 minute wait. It turned out to be 45 minutes--a bit long, but not beyond reason for breakfast in Atlanta.  They did not have a dedicated hostess; instead the waitstaff played double-duty. Perhaps as a result, I noticed that at any given time a notable percentage of the tables in SiMB were unoccupied. The wait could have been cut down considerably if the staff were better at seating customers.\\n\\nThe service at SiMB is lackluster to say the least. It took about ten minutes after being seated for a waiter to even show up. After taking our order, only once during our entire visit did the waiter pass back by.  In that brief visit, he began to pour a coffee refill for me, only to realize (to my dismay) that his carafe was empty. He vowed to return with a full carafe, but never did.\\n\\nSo, SiMB has a few rough spots. I could have overlooked most of these hiccups had the food been good. Unfortunately, it was not. I had the shrimp and grits, but was unimpressed with the dish.  First, the grits were lumpy and dry in places--like they had been sitting around too long. Second, the shrimp were room temperature and tough. I suspect the shrimp have been precooked (or purchased precooked) and are only rewarmed in the BBQ sauce before being served. That of course brings us to, third, the BBQ sauce. It simply did not work with the shrimp and grits. I was expecting something more smoky, but this was sweet and tangy. They type of sauce that you would serve with those little cocktail sausages. It just clashed with the cheese grits.\\n\\nLooking around at SiMB, others seem to really enjoy it. I am unimpressed.

Well, I do like beer... but not so much that the beer menu can overshadow the main reason I came: food. Needless to say, the food was alright... with a beer.\\n\\nIf an item on a menu has a unique name or something, you can bet that I will go for it. You would too if the soup of the day was named \\"Green Eggs (no ham).\\" When it came out, it was a thick pureed soup of potatoes, maybe cabbage (?), and brussel sprouts.  It was definitely smooth, but I could have used softer mini-cabbages (sprouts... did that confuse you?), more flavor, and another layer of taste bud substance i.e. spicy, sweet.\\n\\nI also went for the all meat chili, and it was actually not bad; it paired really well with my pale ale. It was spicy, and certainly meaty. I just would have preferred my meat a bit chunkier; it was really finely ground.\\n\\nFor my entree, I took a shot in the dark and tried their Shepard's pie. It definitely was home-cooked... but it was not cooked by a momma'. This was made hastily in batches and probably just thrown together. The mashed potatoes were fairly smooth with some chunks interspersed; they were very bland, though. The ground beef and veggie mix in the bottom was very disappointing. It was literally just dry minced beef with some peas and carrots.\\n\\nBB Rover's has an amazing beer selection, but the food will merely suffice to coat your GI tract as you work your way through the many choices.

We have been here on several occasions, ate in the regular dining room,  & had great service & food.  This time my boyfriend kinda wanted to be able to watch some of the football games before heading home.  We were greeted by the server in the bar who invited us to sit in the bar area booths.  He was the only server in there except for the bartenders, but he only had a few tables.  By the way, one of the tables seemed to be a bunch of his friends who were nearly done with their meals.\\nIt didn't take long for him to take our drink order, but it seemed that when he left our table then he would head out to the outer area & chat with a couple people out there at the outer bar that he wasn't waiting on, so that delayed us getting our drinks.  He came back with the drinks (iced tea & a Mountain Dew) & said he would be right back.  It seemed to take more than \\"right back\\" to come take our meal order, but when he came back to the table he did say \\"Sorry about that\\" so we thought he recognized that he really had been a bit slow & was going to step up.  I just wanted a simple piece of fish, so he recommended the Mahi sandwich without the roll & that sounded great!  I ordered a side salad & baked potato as my 2 sides.  Mete said it was Sunday so the baked potato was available when we got there about 4:15pm.  My boyfriend just wanted a cheeseburger (cooked medium) with fries & a side salad.  But we wanted to share a cup of chowder beforehand so he asked for that as well.  About 5 minutes later another couple sat in the booth behind us.  Our server almost immediately took their drink order & got them drinks (they had non-alcoholic drinks too).  They got their food order quickly AND got their food before us too.  And I'm referring simply to our salads & chowder & hushpuppies.  Our hushpuppies were a little on the \\"not hot\\" side of warmth, so not sure if they sat in the window or what.  He spent a lot of time chatting up some male customer seated at the bar in the outside area.  I had to flag him down a couple times for refills for my boyfriend.  \\nAs for the food..... The chowder was delicious, & the side salad was fresh & delicious too.  My mahi was grilled perfectly & tasted great.  We didn't notice until we got home & looked at our bill & looked at the website, but our cup of chowder was $4.99 instead the listed $3.99.  It clearly showed on the menu that it was $3.99 for the cup & $4.99 for the bowl as we were there well before 6pm.  He ordered the High Tide Burger & was asked if he wanted American or Cheddar on it & how he wanted it cooked & his 2 sides.  He ordered it with Cheddar, cooked Medium, with Shoestring Potatoes, & a side salad.  There is nothing on the menu about an upcharge for cheese.  What we're wondering is why did we get charged Dinner prices when we got there around 4:15pm & even got cashed out 5:22pm with our check??  Also, my boyfriend got a burger that was clearly much smaller than the bun & really didn't taste all that great.  It's described as \\"A huge portion of fine ground beef\\" on the Dinner menu (that is, since we clearly did pay the Dinner price of $9.49 instead of the Lunch $7.99 & the menu price for the Dinner is listed as $8.99 so I guess we clearly paid $.50 for the cheese).  We don't mind paying more IF we get the larger portion and/or we are there at the \\"Dinner Hours\\", but we clearly didn't & we clearly weren't!!  And the shoestring potatoes weren't cooked properly.  They tasted like they were only partially cooked in oil that wasn't at the proper temperature so they were really oily.  I don't what the cost for MY Mahi sandwich might have been for the \\"Lunch and Low Tide Dinners (11am to 6pm Daily)\\" or if $9.99 is the cost for both Lunch & Dinner.  We only left a 10% tip because of this & we normally leave above 20% when we go out because I worked as a waitress years ago & I completely understand what it's like as a server. Every other time we came here we have enjoyed our food & service & prices, so we wonder if eating in the bar area just screwed everything up.  Basically, we left very disappointed today so it may take some time for us to come back.  And we certainly won't sit in the bar area thanks to this trip."},{"name":"Turf N Surf Po' Boy","address":"407 Lavaca St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow. Wow!

Then they closed, and so I tried Continental, recognizing the name and logo from their Commercial Drive location. \\n\\nAfter the rustic warmth of the Salt Spring decor, I was not a fan of the Space/Retro look with polished reflective surfaces and white chairs. The tables are small and wobbly and the chairs are an uncomfortably low height compared to the table height. I was working with 2 other friends, and we were crammed onto a single square table due to a minimalistic decor (read: not enough tables). Every time they went to write or type, or even put down their drink, the table wobbled. Drove me batty. Whereas Salt Spring had at least 10 tables, this place had maybe 6 or 7. \\n\\nAs for the food/drink and service. *sigh* I miss Salt Spring. The Continental staff member (notice the singular) didn't notice us standing and waiting for service. Then, he preferred to joke around with his friend instead of actually making our drinks. When the drinks were ready, he didn't call them out, just placed it on the bar.

Pleasant, SC, we went to Ted's Montana Grill (Peachtree and Collier)for lunch before they would return to SC. While we were there eating, the back side window of their Sequoyah was smashed, there was significant body damage to the car and ALL of their luggage stolen. Kids were traumatized and a lot of clothes, jewelry and valuables stolen. Ted's did not care- basically saying park at your own risk. The manager in training from Florida offered no help at all.\\nThe police came and said it was their second trip of the day there for the very same reason and that this happens all the time in this lot because Ted's and Uncle Julio's no longer pay for security in the lot. He said the criminals have apps to listen to dispatch and that they know we're the patrol cars are at all times and when they can easily get away with this smash and grab auto theft. The fact that these thugs have 2 easy \\"get away\\" exits other than the front entrance on Peachtree is a big factor. \\nThe surveillance cameras are the to protect Ted's building and the subpoenaed footage will likely give little or no info. Another Ted's patron approached us in the parking lot to say he saw another car window smashed in that lot last week. \\nI guess Ted's does not care about the safety of their customers. I realize the luggage was the attraction for the criminals, but never thought it would be an issue as we would have a quick lunch and they would get on the road. Ted's Risk management has contacted my friends AFTER I called them out on Facebook. They say their hands are tied because they don't own the parking lot.

That was an idea I could get behind.\\n\\nI ordered the almond-crusted chicken skewers: \\"almond rosemary crust, sweet mashed potatoes, twin sauces.\\" Sounds pretty good, right? I thought it sounded like a real meal, and not the pale imitation of one that most airport eateries offer. Overall though, I was really disappointed. The chicken was greasy and overly salty. The sweet mashed potatoes were actually super good, and the cabbage slaw that came with the chicken was pretty tasty as well. However, that greasy chicken made the whole meal just feel heavy and oily. \\n\\nMaybe I was expecting too much of airport food, but I really felt set up. I would have been fine waiting the 15 minutes to place my order and the 10 minutes for my food to be ready, if only it had tasted better.

She did not apologize, barely cleaned it up and walked away, leaving us to finish drying the tables, our chairs and ourselves.\\n\\nOverally, most of our dishes were pretty good,  I recommend the bolognese, salads, bruschetta and arancini.  I do not recommend the ricotta and wild mushroom pasta, it was bland and had a disagreeable texture.   We ordered pasta and tomato sauce for the kids but they ran out of tomato sauce?!

I said to the first person \\"Um, what is this?\\" and she said \\"I have no idea,\\" and I had to ask her to ask somebody (!). She came back and mumbled something about cheddar and goat cheese. Well, whatever the dish was, it was actually pretty delicious, but it was rather disconcerting (and not good dining practice) to not TELL PEOPLE WHO ORDER A TASTING WHAT THEY'RE EATING. It wasn't just me, either..the couple next to us also ordered the tasting and were similarly confused. They even said something to the waitress (same waitress), she explained the appetizer at their request, then never came back to explain any of the subsequent courses to them or us.\\n\\nThe food was actually really great...my second course was (guessing here because again, don't know what was really in it!) swiss chard, cauliflower, mushrooms, and some type of homemade pasta. The dessert was forgettable, chocolate pudding - blah. \\n\\nI doubt I'd come back here. The food was decent but it's not worth dealing with the shitty service and the crowd was also not my favorite.  Lots of \\"olds\\" (as my husband likes to call them) middle aged people.

This is not Fogo's fault by any means; just an observation from a snobby carnivore. The filet was very good. But, avoid the bacon wrapped filet because the cut's flavor is ruined by the taste of undercooked bacon. The leg of lamb was good, and one of the sirloin cuts (starts with an \\"A\\") was surprisingly good as well. The other 2-3 sirloin cuts were tough and relatively flavorless.\\n\\nThe salad bar was excellent, with many options you do not normally see.\\n\\nBottom line: At close to $60 per person, you can get the cut of your choice at any high-end steakhouse.\\n\\nA great choice for those who want to sample many varied cuts of meat from several different animals, or want to gorge themselves to levels rarely seen except on cruise ships."},{"name":"Cafe Orso","address":"4316 Gallant Avenue","city":"North Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Best coffee (49th Parallel, properly brewed) on the North Shore, delicious Belgian waffles, amazing avocado on toast, affogato with Rain or Shine ice cream, beautiful modern decor, friendly staff - I highly recommend this new gem in Deep Cove.\\n\\nAside from the waffles and fresh baked croissants, I loved the cheese and charcuterie board.

The bun does a fantastic job of holding the sauces in place. It makes for a clean eating burger experience. I ordered from the build your own burger option which is great for all those with dietary restrictions. The burger itself was amazing and the fries were some of the best fries I have had in Atlanta. The fries portions are large enough for two, making it perfect for those who like sharing and saving! The price was also phenomenal, making it a perfect spot for starving students and others on a budget. The service was surprisingly very fast considering the long line and there was plenty of outdoor sitting! The only downside is the small parking lot but this is easily remedied by the street parking in the adjacent neighborhood.

Also ordered chicken tenders for our kids, it came with a side of fruit. It had grapefruit in it, chopped up with peel, which made the whole fruit bowl very bitter, and not really palatable for children. I wish restaurants offered more quality food for children, instead of the same old tired chicken strips-Noodles-grilled cheese options. Another thing we ordered was the lavender biscuit, and I love anything lavender. To my disappointment I didn't taste any lavender, even though I could see it. The biscuit was super dense and doughy.

Gunshow is an experience of interesting food served in a restaurant space styled like a break-room. Feel free to dress comfortable and casual for the food experience, it's not a \\"nice restaurant\\" experience. We 2 grown, slightly overdressed, men were seated at a clamped on table extension with 18\\" of table width, rubbing elbows with folks on either side. (Not a problem if expected) The space intimates a restaurant staff break room; commercial food storage equipment is the d√©cor as is the kitchen and prep area. Cafeteria length tables pieced together, bright GARISH lighting and metal rock ambient music. It's kind of bedlam, making intimate conversation impossible and comfort not part of the equation. Though listed and described on a checklist style menu, each small plate creation is  presented table-side by the chef who created it. You may accept or decline the plate. Describing the food here is moot since it changes regularly. There were few if any healthy options like vegan and Paleo, so if you need them, go elsewhere. On my night the appetizers were great, although calamari and an interesting ceviche were presented after entr√©es .(The French chef's food was great but his timing was bad.) Most of the food was well cooked and tasted fine though some dishes missed the flavor mark. (Gillespie can be a tad heavy handed with fat and salt.) Cheffified short ribs, roast chicken & pork belly were served and are typical dishes these days, but here they're prepared with a twist on flavor profiles. The creative combinations may or may not work for every palate, but that's part of the fun if you're one to take expensive risks. *Practice restraint, the $15 (on average) small plates add up quickly. There were ebbs and flows in the service; sometimes too many plates were ready, and the good natured, hairy, bare legged, bearded chefs pounced with a new plate as soon as the last bite from the previous is taken; or there was nothing ready resulting in what felt like a long wait. You might just wait for a certain choice from the menu to be presented or maybe you could tell your server what you want but likely you'll have a wait for the dish to come around. It seemed not perfectly orchestrated chaos. The place is not for timid, genteel diners.

The koi ponds are underfoot (beneath plexiglass), just like the sand garden.  There is outdoor seating, indoor and outdoor lounge/waiting areas, a full bar (with decent and fairly creative cocktails), and copious restaurant seating.\\n\\nThe menu is mostly standard Americanized Chinese fare - people who enjoy standards like mongolian beef, sesame chicken, and lo mein will find their favorite dishes.  There are also more unique dishes, including first course options (if you decide to go with courses), appetizers, soups, and a fairly large menu of entrees.  The wine list is also fairly large for a Chinese restaurant, though perhaps not so surprising when you realize that the menu has multiple steak options, including Kobe filet mignon at $65.\\n\\nAnd therein lies the rub: Liu Pon Xi is a combination of unremarkable (though good) Chinese food and a high class establishment with fancy cocktails, expensive steak, and good service.  The Chinese food is overpriced - most entrees will run you between $12 and $18, and would cost significantly less most anywhere else (and come with rice, too).  The lunch menu, while greatly reduced in complexity, is not greatly reduced in price.\\n\\nLiu Pon Xi is a nice addition to the area, has a vaguely sexy atmosphere, and will no doubt attract a fair amount of business from the Convention Center next door and the surrounding area.   But while it's a good stop on a cocktail crawl, steak lovers should probably just go across the street to the Hyde Park Grill - and I will probably just go to Moy's. 3.5 stars.\\n\\n[Edit: Liu Pon Xi is gone now (as of 10/07), and has been split into two restaurants: one a smaller Chinese place that I suspect is run by the same people, and a new seafood place.]"},{"name":"Village Coney","address":"418 E Whittier St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"The double third pounder is a lot of good food for a good price.

The entire concept. Food made to order and carted around. You say Yay or Nay. They make a tally on your menu and you pay for everything you order at the end. It's insanely affordable for the quality of food you're getting.\\n\\n2. Kevin Gillespie. Not in the \\"I'm a huge fan of Top Chef\\" sort of way. In the, being able to watch a master of a craft work in their medium. Live. Then he brings the food to your table and you try not to pee your pants while he tells you about his MIND BLOWING hot and numbing shrimp.\\n\\n3. Every single thing on the menu. Don't believe me? Try it. Dare you. I am in awe of the fact that each and every thing I ate tonight wasn't just, good, it was INCREDIBLE. The fact that all of the ingredients are sustainable and locally sourced is just icing on the cake. Speaking of cake, if they make it, you should probably give it a go.\\n\\n4. Dessert. I know that falls under \\"Every single thing on the menu.\\" But my point is, try all of them.  The menu is going to change every day, but if you have the option of KG's Grandma's Banana Pudding, go ahead and do that. Swear.\\n\\n5. The little wine shop down the street. Gunshow doesn't have their liquor license yet, but the bad ass wine shop down the street sells GROWLERS OF WINE. I repeat. GROWLERS OF WINE. Go there first. The staff is helpful and awesome. The wine they recommended to us was GREAT.\\n\\n5. Everything. No, really.\\n\\nGo to Gunshow. I can't say enough."},{"name":"Sun in My Belly","address":"2161 College Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I loved this place.  I am looking around for a cater and they were on the list.  We went in for a tasting and I was so happy we did.  They started with a crab cake tha twas tart and fresh, the sqaush soup was something I might kill a preschool for, the fried green tomatoe with pickled beet made me cry inside it was so good.  The salad was so simple but blew me away.  It was simple greens, goat cheese, a fried green tomatoe, and something called goddess dressing.  It was everything a salad should be and more.  the main corses they gave us where the glazed salmon which was perfectly cooked, the fried chicken that was crisp and juicy, then this brunch item of french toast with ham, turkey, and swiss on top with a sunny side up egg, it was what I want on as my last meal if I ever get convicted for killing that preschooler, and the only item of the night that fell short of fantastic with the quiche like thing they brought us, which was not done bad I just did not like the flavor combination.  Christ they even gave us a few of their angel inspired cookies.  They literally tasted like angel wings.

I feel like the value proposition was very poor and that it is largely style over substance. \\n\\nWe dined with a group of about 25 on Friday. While they were a little late getting our party back for our reservation, they handled the situation well and we made no meaningful fuss. We spent some time in the bar and enjoyed some wine and cocktails before making our way down to our room.\\n\\nOur servers were on point. The name on the check was Jesse, though I believe our server said his name was either Ed, or Ned. He was dynamite. The staff generally did a great job making sure that we had what we needed, and that the table was cleared as we went, waters were full, etc... As someone who has worked in the industry for a long time and managed very high volume restaurants, I found the level of service impressive. I was a disappointed in the gauchos on one point however... it was made clear that if we wanted anything in particular that we just ask and they would bring by our preferred cuts or temperatures. I asked 3 different gauchos to bring ribeye to me and never once did I receive any during our two and half hour stay. My big gripes with this place however come down to the food and pricing.\\n\\nThe meats ranged from okayish to dry, bland, and tough. Nothing impressed me. The one cut that came closest was their prime top sirloin which was cooked beautifully, (mid-rare) and was really pretty good. This was the first cut I received and had me excited... everything else was less and less impressive. The bacon wrapped chicken was VERY dry. The bacon wrapped filet was pretty tough (how? I don't know.) and also very dry because it was a bit over done at med-well. The pork tenderloin had great flavor but was again way over done... these three items were almost hard to swallow without some water. I don't say that to be dramatic. They were really that disappointing. The \\"garlic steak\\" was very tough.\\n\\nThe \\"Market Table\\" salad bar was very so-so ish as well. The salads and charcuterie were decent but all the veg was disappointing. I know that this is a national chain, but in a foodie city like portland, your veg options are plain poached broccoli, plain poached green beans, plain poached asparagus... it was pretty lackluster. I'm not a big \\"leafy greens\\" fan so this was disappointing.  \\n\\nThe sides they bring to the table were also a let down. The fried bananas were good, actually, but the fried polenta didn't really do it for me. I know that polenta is corn meal... I'm VERY familiar with it, but this literally tasted like I was eating the breading of a corndog. The mashed potatoes were very dry and mealy in texture. \\n\\nWe were never offered any dessert, likely because we brought a cake to help celebrate in our room, so I have no comment on that side of things.\\n\\nI get why they charge $53/head. You have to if you're going to offer bottomless beef. Wine pricing was bit ridiculous though. I understand how mark-ups work, but when they're selling Domaine Serene Yamhill Cuvee for $135 when Ringside and Portland City Grill sell it for $100, and $90... that tells you their mark-ups are pretty extreme. There were numerous examples on their list that saw similar discrepancies from other high end steak houses in Portland. (...Their Opus one was oddly inexpensive)\\n\\nGenerally, the cost of going here to \\"fill up\\" rather than \\"eat great food\\" doesn't play for me. The place is obviously there to make a profit, and that's fine and fair, but many other places in this city seek to do the same  from a different mind set. I would much rather go somewhere that wants to do all they can to impress with inspired dishes to earn a profit, than somewhere that wants to earn a profit by styling it out and selling the sizzle rather than the steak. I want to iterate that I think a lot of people would come here and enjoy what they get but it wasn't for me. I say spend your money Ringside steakhouse, Portland City Grill, or Laurelhurst Market if you're in the mood for beef as this meal wasn't worth the $165 + tip we paid for it. \\n\\n(two meals, two glasses of wine, 1 cocktail, and 1 corkage charge)"},{"name":"Marrakesh Restaurant","address":"1201 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Just came back from what is the worst experience I've ever had with a waiter. \\n\\nThe young man seated a party of 5 on an empty floor in the smallest corner we saw.  literally empty place, and when we inquire if they could seat us he flat out says \\"No! you sit here,  if you dont like it you can go somewhere else.\\" we would understand if they are going through renovations or are holding reservations but no explanation. \\n\\nWe proceed to sit down in this corner with a super small table. this place has tables and couches, so we pull another table to accommodate all of us.

They didn't offer me a glass water (I was coughing and perhaps I should have just asked) or a cup of tea or anything. Within 10 minutes or so they showed up with the food and I took it home. \\n\\nIt was ok. Nothing special. Probably just scooped up left overs from lunch which is about all one can expect. The crab puffs were filled with more cream cheese than crabs (yeah, I'm being picky) and the egg roll was inedible - hard as a rock. Even the fortune cookies were stale and hard.

This time? Not so much. The waitress pretty much ruined the experience single-handedly. She was in an awful mood, completely bitter and short with us - we're nice people, respectful, I know it can be a tough job, honestly, who doesn't have at least one friend in the restaurant business? I hear the horror stories, I offer up my best. It was pretty evident she was having a shitty night, but holy moley, I have never felt so unwelcome. Before asking us about our order she asked us if there had been money on the table. When we told her there hadn't been she sighed dramatically and walked away... came back again after having to text her our drink/food orders.. asked if we were sure there hadn't been money on the table. Came back fifteen minutes later with the beer, and soon after with the burgers. Each time she either let out an emphatically exasperated sigh or contemptuous glare. Really? Soon after we chugged our beers, gobbled up the food and texted for the check. The waitress comes, and get this, the girl who has been sitting at the table behind ours tells the waitress that the people who were eating at the table my friend and I were sitting at went outside to drink and points to where these people are. The waitress books it outside, gets her money, comes back in, and finally... finally.. brings us our check and let's a flipping smile ERUPT all over us. What? Even as a pacifist I'm not surprised at the overwhelming urge I had to knock her in the teeth. \\n\\nSo to the waitress: Thanks for treating us like a couple o' thieves and liars... and you know, neglecting to apologize for your crappy attitude and unprofessional behavior. Everyone has poop days, but wow, did you take the cake. Worst server ever, that's you.\\n\\nAbout the food: My double bacon cheeseburger wasn't the best, but it was better than I expected it to be, the fries were cold and literally looked like someone just picked up a small handful and threw it down on the plate, not a lot offered, but it was only about $5 and the meal was all about survival and keeping myself from tanking early on in the night. It would probably be awesome drunk food though.          \\n\\nI won't knock the entire establishment because of one employee in a bad mood. Charlie's has good beer for cheap and I dig that.

I knew going in that the service could be slow, but 45 minutes for a shrimp po'boy and fries???  The first clue I had that things were not going to go well was the price.  I have had really good po'boys all over the Southeast US for much cheaper, but I thought maybe it is so large that it could make up for the price.  When my sandwich finally arrived, it looked like a foot long hot dog on very hard bread.  The shrimp inside the sandwich were tiny, I mean microscopic and to top that off there were only four or five of them on the entire sandwich.  This was by far the worst po'boy I have ever had.  I pretty much paid about $10 for a piece of bread with a few pieces of tomato and lettuce drowned by mayo.  Thanks, but no thanks Gene.

Mooo belongs to the Columbus Hospitality group, which also owns Mistral and Sorellina, two restaurants which I absolutely adore. But the experience at Mooo during lunch is VERY subpar, not like what I expected at all.\\n\\nMoo is located in the financial district/ Beacon Hill area, a stone throw away from Marliave which I had a great experience at last week. Mooo has a great location, great decor but those are probably all the great things there are.\\n \\nFirstly, the speed of service. I felt hurried, almost as if they were trying to get us out of the restaurant. I know efficiency is good; who doesn't want their food to arrive quickly, but then in this case, they brought the main entrees while we were still having our appetizers, and all of the sudden, making the table very crowded, and I felt as if I had to quickly finish my app to make space for the mains. Big no-no. \\n \\nThen about the food, I think my friend left half of her Chilled Corn Soup lump crab garnish, poblano pepper oil, and half of her steak frites as well. I got the Steak Tartare hand chopped, grilled flatbread, which is acceptable, and Pan Seared Faroe Island Salmon native corn succotash, which is in my opinion, quite salty. I definitely had to drink some water to get rid of the salty flavor at some point.We both had Native Strawberry Shortcake mascarpone whipped cream for desserts and we both agree that the shortcake could have been a little lighter/ fluffier/sweeter. \\n \\nAnd talking about water, the waiter asked us still or sparkling? We said still water and apparently that means still bottled water, not still tap water. And we didn't even see an unopened still bottled water, just the \\"communal\\" water bottle they use to fill up water at different tables. I mean I can't tell whether that's actually bottled water or tap water. And we were charged 10$ + tax for it. This only became clear at the end of the meal, by the way, so that just left me with a very bad impression and unsatisfactory feeling. One should be happy, content and grateful by the end of the meal! Also, the waiter said: \\"I will talk to the manager about it\\" when we mentioned about the water. I gave him my card, and he came back like 10 seconds later, with a bill where we were still charged for the water, and also not even mentioning what his manager said. Or did he even talk to the manager?\\n \\nURGH. Well, at least my friend's humor made up for the bad experience. \\nBut yes, I would give Mooo a 1 out of 5.

And their Chix Salad is so good that it's hard not to leave this place without grabbing a container of it. So that's just what I did.  That's what I always do.  Anyway, after digging into my pizza I was going to come on here and write another 5 star review about how much I love Newk's.  I was going to talk about how delicious the food is. I was going to talk about how they do everything right all of the time.  I was going to mention to the yelp universe how my pizza from Newk's was \\"all toppings\\".  When was the last time you or anyone you know said that their pizza was \\"all toppings\\"?  Most people would pick one of two possible answers to this question.  Either \\"a long time ago\\" or \\"never\\".  Why? Because most pizzas are \\"all crust\\".  Or \\"all sauce\\".  Or \\"all cheese\\".  But never are they \\"ALL toppings\\".  I imagine this is because, to a pizza place, crust is probably cheap.  Sauce is probably cheap.  And cheese is probably cheap.  But toppings?  Toppings are expensive.  So I was going to come on here and yelp* from the rooftop that my Newk's deluxe pizza was loaded with big chunks of delicious high quality toppings.  It was like a red and yellow bell pepper wedding where the pepperoni married the ham on a field of cheese and artichokes then gave birth to dozens of plump olives and juicy mushrooms.  It was a damn near perfect pizza event.  \\n\\nI was going to say all of that.  I was.  But, as I was feverishly devouring this perfect marriage of multiple meats and valuable veggies I bit into something very hard and very rigid (pic included). At first, I thought it was a rock. It sure felt like a rock. But upon further inspection I think it was part of an olive pit that broke off and somehow made it's way into the ingredients and onto my pizza.  Whatever it was, it was hard like a rock and very sharp along the edges.  I would have no problem cutting skin with it if I chose to do so.  It immediately brought to a halt any euphoric feelings I was experiencing through the discovery of an almost perfect pizza, and nearly tore up my grill. I understand that things like this can happen to even the best restaurants, which is why I'm only docking one star.  I'm still a fan, but my quest to try everything on the menu @ Newk's will have to be put on hold for now.  And even though my tooth hurts, my feelings are probably hurt more.  Because Newk and I had the makings of a great relationship."},{"name":"Fuji Sushi Japanese Cuisine","address":"1449 Lee Rd","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"Loved it... sushi was fresh and very reasonable priced.

This Windy Hill Ru San's location is quite different from the Midtown location in a few ways: 1) It has teppanyaki food (hibachi dinners) in addition to sushi, 2) the atmosphere is completely different, and 3) the food isn't as good in my experience (although neither location's sushi really impresses me).  There is some conflict between #2 and #3, because I find the atmosphere at the Midtown Ru San's location off-putting -- it is perpetually crowded and loud.  It gets pretty obnoxious to hear the \\"Saki Bomb\\" chant every five minutes during a busy night.  I guess it's appealing to a certain \\"hip\\" aesthetic and it's probably more fun if you're buzzed and responsible for the noise, but I like to be able to converse while I eat.\\n\\nSo I prefer the atmosphere at the Windy Hill location and the fact that there's rarely a crowd, but their food really isn't worth the drive.  Ru San's in Midtown is a tad bit better, but even their food is average at best.  If you're looking for cheap sushi, I guess it's a step up from supermarket sushi, but I'm not sold on the food.

(The customers come from the four corners of the earth). \\n\\nThe place reminded me of the classic  Lebanese meals I enjoyed at Marroush Restaurant, a few streets up from Harrods Department store in London. I can still smell the Lamb Kebabs  and beef Kebabs, or Dover Sole cooking on the charcoal brazier\\n\\nI believe that at Byblos Cafe (Norwood) human connectivity is the secret specialty item on the menu  not just the wonderful purple Turnip pickles and Olive appetizer you are served immediately upon entering.\\n\\n A nod to the the beautiful Nellie, Maurice's sister in law about what Mezze you would like and within minutes you are served warm Spinach Pies, and wonderful bowls of the most sumptuous Hummus and Baba Ganouj you have ever had in your life, garnished with a puree of olive oil parsely, and roasted garlic. \\n\\nEvery waiter and waitress is ready to strike ip a conversation if you initiate it ( and will leave you to yourself if you don't) as if you had grown up in the same Mediterranian Village went to the same elementary school, worked in your family Groceria, Mercedes dealership, Rolex Watch Shop then than by some miraculous coincidence wound up bumping into each other for lunch at Byblos restaurant, 1000s of miles away.\\n\\n I  love USA Politics, and I chatted with the Russian waiter from Brighton Beach (a Russian Enclave)  near New York City who told me he had voted for The Donald, a Russian favorite not due to collusion with Vladimir Putin but due his tough stances on alot of things\\n\\nThere are dozens of delicious dishes on the Dinner and Lunch Menus (reasonably priced), so many in fact that this reviews would have to be the length of a Sunday New York Times Magazine Article to due justice to describing them. \\n\\nTo make some attempt at brevity, I recently went to Byblos Cafe  with some family members , and to keep things simple we ordered the Byblos Family Platter #2.

Definitely had a case of the 'my-eyes-are-bigger-than-my-stomach' syndrome. It didn't help that my friend is vegetarian, so I was on my own for all the meat dishes.\\n\\nI've heard really good things about the butter beef and garlic wings from friends and other yelpers, so I went ahead and ordered both appetizers along with an entree of beef luc lac. Definitely didn't order enough food :P\\n\\nThe #71 butter beef ($15.50) is a plate full of thin, mostly rare slices of beef, marinated in a vinegar-y soy sauce. I'm glad I ordered it, as the beef was very tender, but I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce as it was a little too sour for my tastes. The #78 garlic chicken wings ($9.95 for a small order) were delicious! They're liberally coated with minced garlic and fried to perfection. I was expecting them to be fully savory, but to my surprise they were a little bit sweet.\\n\\nThe #34 beef luc lac ($11.95) is a rice dish served with stir-fried beef slices. I've had it before at other places, and while this wasn't my favorite version of the dish, it was still solid. The beef was well seasoned and tender and went well with the rice. It also comes with a bowl of soup, which was pork bone soup with some veggies on the day I went.\\n\\nThey don't have too many vegetarian options, but there are still some. I saw some chive and veggie dumplings on the menu, and my friend ended up ordering their vegetable buns (#74).\\n\\nService was quick.

No complaints on the wait staff either; they were very professional, efficient and our food arrived promptly.  Signature cocktails were interesting, very creative and I had a wonderful chardonnay. But the food was an utter disappointment. The portions are very small and overpriced for the serving and quality. I had the Striped Bass which at $31.00 was one of the more expensive entrees on the menu.  The fish was cooked correctly in a very small center area (2 bites) but the edges and back side of the fish were dry and rubbery. The few mushrooms and 2 small Chippolini onions accompanying the fish did little to appease me.  My friend had the Tybee Shrimp about which she politely commented \\"this dish and the two small shrimp that it included were very good.\\" Her husband's Ribeye received no comment.  My husband's Grilled Octopus did not appear grilled, consisted of small tubes rather than pieces cut on the bias and were paired with cold potato puree.

I don't claim to be any kind of expert, but I know what I like. I like the Fuentes, Partagas, and some of the other famous, high-dollar brands. They're great smokes. At 10 bucks a stick, they should be. \\nThe cigars at Bobalus can stand toe-to-toe with anything you can get from your Heroes or your Pipe World. Seriously. And for about half the price. They have a great selection with leaf from Honduras, Nicaraugua, Dominican Republic etc., etc. They use a wide variety of wrappers - Connecticut, Maduro, Oscuro, Sun-grown, the list goes on. I guess through trial and error, they've hit on the best combinations of filler, binder and wrapper to satisfy any taste preference. Like 'em mild? try the white label - tasty, smooth and very mild. Like a fuller flavor? The XXX Super Fuerte is for you. This one has been my favorite for years.\\nNow - what about this cigar club they have? It costs 50 bucks to join, and entitles you to a free stick for every one you buy. At an average of say 7 bucks a stick,  it pays for itself when you buy the 7th cigar - you have 49 bucks worth of free cigars. Another way to look at it is that a 7-dollar cigar costs only 3.50. Either way, it's a real bargain on great cigars. And if you're like me, and smoke a 2 or 3 cigars a week, you save 300 - 400 bucks a year.

It was instant love at first sight for me. I fell in love so HARD with Casa De Luz that I ditched my quarter written 300th review on Eddie's V to make Casa De Luz my 300th!\\n\\nI was like a lost puppy coming here not too sure what to expect, except for some good vegan food. Let's walk thru this serene experience together shall we!\\n\\nFirst of all, don't expect to find fancy/greasy/salty food at Casa De Luz. Their food concept is macrobiotic. I had to google this word to see what the heck it means after seeing so many people mention it. Macrobiotic is not just a diet. It's a way of life, but in this case, they focus on food that are rich in nutrients and have balanced yin/yang properties. You'll see a lot of whole grains, fresh vegetables, low sodium level (for those of you complaining the food taste plain), no refined sugar in drinks or desserts. For once, try to take in the natural freshness that vegetables have to offer, instead of looking for sodium/butter loaded food. \\n\\nThey have a big parking lot right across the street. Not an Austinite myself, I wasn't aware that it's free to park on the weekend, and possibly in the evening on the weekdays, but don't take my words for that second part.\\n\\nWalking to the restaurant I was a little confused. Maybe I missed the sign directing patrons to where the restaurant is, kept looking around hoping I wouldn't walk into the wrong place since the restaurant is tucked all the way at the end of the beautiful walk way. So if it's your first time here, just keep walking straight towards the back until you can't go any further and just open the door to the magic land of wonderfulness when you see one.\\n\\nEverything here is self-serve except the entree plate. You pay at the counter for your meal/dessert then pick your own table. Grab the silverware/chopsticks, napkins, and cups on the left side across from the cashier, next to the dessert display. It's all you can eat salad and soup. They usually have 2-3 different teas to choose from. \\n\\nThere are always people walking around, keeping an eye out to see when you're done with your soup/salad so they can bring you your entree. If they're too busy or you're too hungry (eat more soup and salad) to wait 5-10mins, just go to the ladies by the salad/soup counter and ask for your entree plate. \\n\\nTheir desserts are pretty good. They're beautifully displayed in the glass case. It was hard for me not to get one of everything. Except for the drink bottles, all the desserts are $4/each. You either pay for them at the beginning along with your meal, or just go back to the cashier and pay for them when you want them. I'm not a fan of pecan pie in general, but I inhaled their vegan pecan pie in about a minute. Definitely recommend.\\n\\nFor breakfast it's less than $8, lunch and dinner are $12, this includes tax. The cost covers all you can eat soup/salad and 1 plate of entree. If you want another plate, it'd be an extra $8/plate. They do not accept tips here, so please make sure to bus your own table. \\n\\nCasa de Luz is not just a typical restaurant. Come here for the experience or just a quick getaway from the busy, crowded of downtown Austin. I'm definitely looking to come back here next time I'm in Austin!"},{"name":"CrepeBerry","address":"352 Washington St","city":"Wellesley","stars":"3.5","text":"I wanted to love this place so much but the crepes have been just average so far and the breakfast sandwiches are pretty standard...

After two times, you start feeling like a punk, and probably cross over that threshold of \\"uncontaminated food.\\"  The problem is the the meat is always too THIN.\\n\\nBut that's where Sullivan's came through.  Your steak comes thicker than those wider ones, and cooked to perfection.  The days of ordering rare and praying that they overcook that too are over!

However, that does not excuse and poor attitude, talking back and over charging. \\n\\nOur waitress Christina Z was not cooperative and over charged us. I met friends who had been sitting in the beer garden. I order a drink with my father and girlfriend and we waited 20 mins and nothing. We asked and she said she had to get 2PBRs and a Corona from \\"Downstairs\\" I know for a fact that other than draft beer, every drink comes from the inside bar and everyone else was getting their drink promptly. I proceeded to order 5 draft beers from the very attentive bartender and our waitress made sure to intercept me and say she got them.

She assured us that she would remove the missing items. Instead, she overcharged us and brought back the bill without the itemized list. If it wasn't for my girlfriend's persistence, we would have overpaid. She made sure to find the manager ask for the itemized receipt and point out the drinks that we never had.

My friends and I intended on having a a nice sociable dinner with my friends upstairs where we usually meet up for a nice meal and a few drinks before we go out.  The music upstairs was already much louder than previously.  In the past here if you wanted loud music and dancing you would go downstairs.  Upstairs is typically a place where you can have a conversation with people over drinks not have overbearing music jammed down your throat while your trying to eat and drink with my friends.  To top it off a band started playing literally right next to us upstairs while we were eating, blaring in our ears.  Don't get me wrong I'm a huge music lover and would usually check out the bands downstairs at BBG but I don't think anybody likes speakers 10 feet away from their ears blasting while their trying to have a nice meal and drinks with friends upstairs.  I noticed the people eating around us were soon to leave quickly as well.  \\n\\nThe worst part of all this is when I tried saying something to the new manager he replied very dismissively and arrogantly which I was absolutely shocked about.

My date was looking forward to the meal all week, so the fact that they were able to meet our expectations in almost every area of the restaurant is pretty impressive.\\n\\nWe went on a Monday night and were pleasantly surprised by the prix-fixe menu offered on Sunday and Monday nights for $35 (which I got). This is a pretty awesome deal, especially since we were planning to spend around $200 total for dinner. The appetizers are limited to two salad choices or a chowder, so my date and I ended up splitting the kobe beef dumplings along with the salad that came with my meal because we heard the dumplings were delicious; they were. My sirloin, which came as part of the prix-fixe and was worth $35 alone, was seasoned and cooked perfectly. My date got filet mignon, which was good, but no better than the filet mignon at their sister restaurant Sorellina, and since Mooo... is the steakhouse we had higher expectations. \\n\\nBoth steaks came with the bone marrow butter which is nicely presented and scrumptious :). We were so full by the time dessert came I feel we couldn't accurately gage how tasty it was, but I would certainly order the pumpkin cheese cake again (one of the dessert options on the prix-fixe). Overall, the food was great; they also added the perfect touch of writing Congratulations on our dessert plates in chocolate sauce which was just enough to make us feel special without causing any kind of scene.\\n\\nOverall the service was good. It started off a little rocky, but since both my date and I work in the food service industry we tend to be overly critical of service. When we walked in the entire restaurant was empty and the hostess sat us down directly next to the only other table in the restaurant with people at it. When my date asked if we could maybe move to a table a little more removed, the host frowned and stated bluntly, \\"I'll have to check, follow me back to the front,\\" and walked away.  I understand that there are reasons for putting people at certain tables which as a host you can't necessarily explain to the guests, but there are certainly more pleasant ways to go about re-seating someone. Our server, and the backwaiter were both sweet and helpful with the menu and mentioning the backwaiter also reminds me--THE BREAD WAS TO DIE FOR. \\n\\nWe certainly enjoyed ourselves, and had a great celebration.

We did eat some pretty good food, but nothing was so good we wanted to wait 20 minutes to get it again. A couple that were seated almost 15 minutes after us were offered food much more quickly even though they arrived after us.

Everything in the \\"city\\" can't be fancy shmancy and marketed to out-of-town tourists who want a full dining experience; the locals have to eat, too, and this place works out great for me! I work at Lenox Mall and live downtown. I call in my order once I'm in my car after work and drop in and pick up my food. The restaurant has tables and everything but I've never seen anyone dining in. Me and the fam dined in once. It was perfectly ok; we had the whole restaurant to ourselves and while the server was nice and gracious, she seemed out of practice and the service was kind of awkward. But the restaurant boasts a nice view of North Avenue, it was a beautiful day, and the fam was in town so I was golden! Most importantly, the food is consistent. As I said, this isn't high end Chinese food (which, IMO, doesn't taste any better, just presented on prettier plates) so don't expect any unnecessary embellishments. They have an extensive menu, food is always hot, cooked right, ready to go when I get there for pick up, reasonably priced, and generously portioned. Sounds like a perfect after work dinner to me. :)"},{"name":"The Thirsty Gator","address":"3040 N Goldenrod Rd","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"Do not be fooled by the looks of this joint.\\nThe oysters here are the best in town.

True it's only one visit & there are hoped for improvements, but the experience was a compelling reason for a return visit very soon! \\n\\nThe Octopus stew was not what I expected.  A shallow soup type plate with discrete pieces of Octopus and potatoes in a truly outstanding reddish-pink liquid.  The Octopus could not have been cooked better.  Firm, not mushy and with only a hint of sea flavors.  But the sauce ... oh!, sooo great ... not thick, but enough to coat the fish and potatoes.  There is another octopus dish on the menu I want to try, but it will take real will power to not order the stew again.\\n \\nI enjoy wine with most meals and often disparage all the many restaurants who price their wines outrageously high.  But this place deserves a gold star for its wine prices.  We had a Portuguese white Dao.  I looked it up afterwards and not only was it well rated, but it retails for $10-14.  So, they're using a 2x or less markup ... another reason to consider frequent visits.\\n\\nMy wife had a tray of seafood ... it comes in several varieties and looks quite appealing.  She had a couple of the biggest shrimp I've ever seen.  The few bits she passed to me confirmed her judgment that it was wonderfully cooked.\\n\\nNow to things I hope will change.  The clams in our appetizer had a nice consistency and tasted great,  but a couple of the clams had some grit ... very off putting.  The sauce though was another winner ... so much so, we'll probably try the clams again.\\n\\nThere was no wine list; the bottles, maybe 10 or 12 were on a shelf and we were ask to pick one.  Had to ask the waitress the price and she had to go over to a list posted by the bar to find out.  A regular wine list would be appreciated.

Nonetheless, I was able to enjoy great company and a really nice meal at Grill 23.  The restaurant has apparently renovated by moving the bar away from the street window and opening it up to bar seating.  Overall the place is nicely decorated, gets good natural light and feels larger than it actually is.  It's quiet enough for a social occasion dinner, but not so quiet that it feels like a tomb.\\nOne of our party is a wine enthusiast and complimented the selections several times.  Many steakhouses I've been to will shorten the wine list (and rightly so) but will inevitably leave the same type of wine at three different price points.  Thus we're either going for the $40 bottle of cabernet, the $70 bottle or the $100+ bottle...of essentially the same wine.  Not so at Grill 23.  There were several good selections depending on your food pairing.\\nOnto the food.  We were a relatively large group of seven, so we actually ordered most of the popular sides: asparagus, brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes and spinach.  All the sides were fine if not a little bland.  I think the chef may have lost his/her panache on the sides.  The only Boston corollary I can come up with is Bob Kraft and Bill Belichik talking about building the roster around Tom Brady.  You aren't drafting the left guard or weakside linebacker to make the Hall of Fame when you've got Tom Terrific.  The complimentary players should do their job, not make errors and get out of the way!  Needless to say, the side dishes meandered their way around the table a few times - looking sheepish.  Finally I took pity and scooped some instant potatoes and limp asparagus onto my plate.  Neither struck me as impressive.\\nI ordered the petite filet - medium.  Upon further review, I should have probably ordered medium well.  In fact, it was such a trend around the table that I chalked it up to being a busy night and the grillmaster probably just rushed these steaks onto a grill that hadn't reheated properly from the last steak.  From the crust, it was obvious the grill was \\"cool\\".  Medium for such a thick cut of filet left the outside looking a little less than crusty and the inside was practically still mooing.  The beef itself was fine and that's why I enjoyed the steak immensely.  The seasoning was nice and subtle.  Also, what's with the onion and garnish hanging all over that steak like a stripper short on rent money?  Man get that stuff away from the star of the show!  Overall, it was fine but I can't help but wonder what that filet had been like on a hotter grill (better crust) and left on another 90 seconds (firmer middle).\\nI think Grill 32 was an excellent choice for our dinner.  We were seven pals having a semi-business/semi-ball-busting dinner with drinks and good food.

Melnea Cass/Mass Ave traffic would not help ratings one bit (hence the 3.5 stars), especially when this delay can be easily avoided. friend who was in front of me even took longer to arrive, getting lost and all.\\n\\n- our group of 4 was seated in the middle of the \\"front\\" side of the restaurant (by Mass Ave, but it appears their hostess station is by the back door, opposite the parking lot and next to hotel entrance). shortly after, the staff started moving tables around us to prep for a group arrival, leaving our table in an \\"island\\" situation. we asked to move, and they gladly obliged so no biggie there, just a little odd.\\n\\n- seems like we don't have a dedicated waiter for the night, anyone would come and bring us food, refill teas, collect check, etc. it's fine by me long as things get done, but i reckon that could be a little confusing for others.\\n\\n- sushi are ok (we ordered mostly cooked stuff) if not much of a surprise; chinese dishes were underwhelming. all in all, not much of \\"modern\\" asian cuisine as their website advertises.\\n\\n- yes yes we didn't ask what \\"yin yang noodle\\" was supposed to be, but borrowing from the \\"yin yang fried rice\\" expectation and the \\"two kinds of noodles\\" as i have had in asia, i did not expect this dish to be the ordinary \\"two-face pan fried noodle\\" featuring crunchy and soft of the same noodle -- that just doesn't sound very \\"yin yang\\" to me.  and the noodle was quite salty.\\n\\n- price (per item) is indeed a bit steep, but given the location and clientele (next to hotel, hospital), it's understandable.\\n\\n- bathroom: both soap dispensers didn't work, leaving the dollar-bottle of Dial hand soap to the rescue. mismatched from the rest of the classiness in this place.\\n\\nnow, onto the good stuff:\\n- free 3-hour validated parking.\\n- the place is huge! great for throwing parties.\\n- the decor is very nice: clean, modern, classy, comfortable.\\n- bathroom is clean; appreciate the little couch in the ladies' too.\\n- staff is very polite and accommodating.\\n- the mini stove on which the iron pot and hotate hokkaiyaki are served is so hip!\\n- good value with [groupon] deal.\\n\\nsuggestions:\\n- add parking address/map on website for those who drive.\\n- when answering customers' inquiry about parking, please just don't say \\"you'll see it when you're here\\", coz we didn't, and that really wasn't saying much.\\n- train staff to pre-plan seating strategies (accounting for all possible situations) to avoid future awkwardness.\\n- either lock the \\"front\\" door and direct guests to enter from the rear, or add a hostess station with real-time electronic seating applications on both ends.\\n- it is also ok to serve multiple sushi rolls on a large plate -- less cleaning, less cost, more environment-friendly.\\n\\nall in all, i can tell these people really do care about their business. i genuinely wish them the best of luck in their endeavors."},{"name":"Windward Passage Restaurant","address":"4739 Reed Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"service was great, sat in the bar and had lunch w/ a firend.\\nmy issue is $40.00 for 2 fish sanwiches/no fries and 2 side salads w/ 2 iced teas, is too much for me to come back.  if they had a website i would let them know."},{"name":"Flying Biscuit Caf√© - Midtown","address":"1001 Piedmont Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"My first visit to Flying Biscuit almost did not happen.

I was not satisfied but I ate my 'burrito' slowly as I enjoyed the quiet ambiance of this place and looked out on Hornby street and enjoyed the strong air conditioning. The place is huge too for a burrito joint, with a prep area almost as large as the seating area. I don't get it. Look at a place like Hubbub which serves probably 10 times as many people in 1/2 the space and makes infinitely better crafted food and it makes me wonder how these guys pay the rent every month. Everything except the food was good ie. the building, the seating, the free wifi, the staff, the speed at which they made my order. But I'm telling you, I squeezed a load of hot sauce on this thing to make it marginally passable.\\n\\nOn the plus side, I think they may be going for a healthy kick but their execution needs to be better and they need to say that on a sign before you order. I didn't think steamed burritos meant low-sodium, low-fat, whole wheat, .... The good thing is that I didn't feel thirsty in the afternoon like I usually do, meaning their sodium levels are probably reasonable.\\n\\nI don't know why but I may go back someday against my better judgement to give them another shot I guess. $9 for a small, flavorless wrap -- that's their deluxe model too!

I just wanted to write a review for my most recent visit, because I will keep coming back!\\n\\nMy friend and I went to Thai Boo last Saturday night, Groupon in hand, and found the normally empty restaurant with lots of patrons.  The restaurant used be Smile Smile, but it had closed and re-opened as Thai Boo.  Thanks to Groupon's $29 dinner for 2 deal, it has packed the house!\\n\\nOur groupon allows us to pick one shared appetizer, 2 soup or salad, 2 entrees and one shared dessert.  We decided to share pretty much everything but our soups.  For appetizers we got the fresh spring rolls with shrimp.  It was your average rice paper rolls with veggies and shrimps (or tofu option).  Paired with peanut dipping sauce, it was delicious.  For soups, my friend got the Tom Yum and I got the Tom Kha.  Usually I like Tom Yum, since I love spicy food, but wanted something creamy so I went for Tom Kha (with coconut milk).  The soups were great as well, both were super spicy, but that's just how we wanted it.  Then comes the entrees - we decided to share the Thai Boo Special Hot Basil Duck, as well as the Red Curry with seafood.  Let me tell ya, next time you are at Thai Boo, PLEASE GET THE HOT BASIL DUCK!!! You can thank me later.  Tender duck meat with a kick of spice.  It was perfect.  The Red Curry was also very good.  By this time both of our mouths were on fire, and the lovely waitresses took turns to come fill our glasses.\\n\\nBy the time dessert came, we were too full so we ordered the Mango Sticky Rice to go.  Again, please do yourself a favor and try the mango sticky rice.  I dream about this.  All this  deliciousness was pre-paid for $29 and I only had to tip and pay the tax... pinch me, is this real?\\n\\nThis is one of the local businesses that I wish would get more visibility.

I had checked out their restaurant and it seemed very discouraging of those with dietary restrictions.\\n\\nBut on my husband's birthday (which I had forgotten until the day before) on a whim I decided to make a reservation, figuring we'd get appetizers at Shed beforehand so we weren't too hungry.\\n\\nAll the food and drink was amazing.  Not surprising.\\n\\nBut the experience itself far exceeded my expectations.  There were several vegetarian options and several others that could be made vegetarian or pescatarian.  I realize they change the menu daily, but if this was a typical selection there is plenty for a vegetarian to make into a meal!  I got no vibe of snootiness or annoyedness from the staff for my questions/requests.  Our server was very pleasant and the service was smooth.\\n\\nI was also nervous about something I had previously read that said once they run out of a dish they're out, so it might not even get to you... being that we had the 9:00 seating I was worried that if they ran out of the vegetarian options I'd be screwed.  That never happened - every dish was presented to us (or at least every vegetarian one).  And I'm wondering if I may have misinterpreted the warning--maybe the idea is that they make enough to present everything to everyone, but if you don't get it the first time you lose your chance to ask for it later? \\n\\nNoise level was not bad either - it was loud, but not disruptive, and my husband and I had no trouble hearing each other.\\n\\nThe bottom line is that what I read about it led me to prepare myself for an anxiety-producing experience, but it was actually the opposite--very relaxing and nicely paced.  In some ways less tense than normal meal service because you can see exactly what's going on and there's always something on its way. Granted, I had had a few drinks, but still. \\n\\nI don't remember names of specific dishes, but I'll try to describe a few favorites: there was a scallion pancake thing that they gave us without the meat - it was amazing.  The risotto was fabulous as well, and some kind of tart (I think goat cheese).  They also had a \\"beet tartare\\" that was lovely - a good test of a restaurant is whether I like the beets, because I don't normally like beets.  The cocktails are interesting and the two I had were delicious (hai tai was one of them).  We had all the desserts--hot banana pudding which I'm told is their signature, something with strawberries, something with chocolate.  They were very good, if a tad underwhelming compared to the mind-blowing savories.\\n\\nSo...

The food is not exactly first-class, but then again it is dive bar food, so what do you expect? I especially love the beer fries and waffle fries, particularly to supplement those big juicy hot dogs. If you have a big enough stomach, get the double! These dogs are of super high quality! I am also quite fond of the mozzeralla sticks and calamari; my best friend and I are always sure to get at least one of these as our appetizer. \\n\\nThe beer is priced very fairly also, depending on what kind it is, and the staff are very attentive. This place does get very busy on weekends, and they do the best they can accommodate. I have worked at restaurants before, so I would know. Dikshawn (did I spell that right?) and Lila are the BEST!\\n\\nMy best friend and I have also found this place to be an ideal means of getting away from the mainstream scene just to rock it out, and crank up the jukebox with some Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Slayer, etc. and not have to hear any of that stupid, generic, pointless pop dance or rap garbage that is being slammed through peoples' heads on a regular basis. Plus, it's always fun to scare away any wimpy, yet stuck-up preppies who think they can come in here and ruin us rockers' fun with any of that stupid mainstream trash... priceless! \\n\\nBottom line - if you are looking to \\"get down on the dance floor\\" then you can forget about coming to Charlie's Kitchen! You are going to LOSE! GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!! We don't want your kind here, because Charlie's is the type of place where we anti-mainstream folks come to get away from people like you! There are PLENTY of bars in Cambridge that will be more than happy to have you play your generic pop dance garbage, but Charlie's IS NOT one of them! Thank you!\\n\\nEDIT: Since I first wrote this review, there was an occurrence at Charlie's that illustrates PERFECTLY the type of environment this is, in terms of the type of crowd for which this place is ideal:\\n\\nSomeone had the nerve to put on Justin P.O.S. Dweeber on the Jukebox one Friday night, and it didn't even take 5 seconds into the track (not song) before practically the whole bar started booing very loudly and chanting \\"SKIP IT!!! SKIP IT!!! SKIP IT!!!\\" When the bartender took the remote and skipped it, everyone cheered!  Not only that, but they cheered even LOUDER when my first song, Judas Priest's \\"You've Got Another Thing Coming\\" came on!  To this day, this remains by far the most EPIC moment I have ever experienced at Charlie's and I simply HAD to include it in my Yelp review. It just simply COULD NOT be ignored, and should serve as a warning to all the stuck-up, musically illiterate mainstream pop fans out there.\\n\\nAll in all, with the food, the drinks, the crowd (particularly my fellow regulars Bob and Steve - you know who you are!), the scene... it's all there and great, and I would strongly recommend this place to anyone who wishes to unwind and get away from the mainstream scene. Also worthy to note is that this where my best friend and I have had the pleasure of doing a Blues Brothers dance impersonation to \\"Gimme Some Lovin\\" on Halloween night of 2014, invoking laughter in many. Ever since then, our tabs have been marked with the name \\"Blues Bros\\" - HILARIOUS!\\n\\nOh, and to Ian B. - As I have said, we don't want your kind here, so don't even bother coming here again! As I have said, Charlie's is the type of place where we anti-mainstream folks come to get away from people like you.

The food was delicious. The service, left a lot of be desired. I'll start with the food.\\nI had a house vodka martini that was nice. Usually I order top shelf vodka but thought I'd see how bad their house was, and it was surprisingly good. I always order mine 'slightly dirty' and that is exactly how it came. The restaurant should spend a few more dollars on olives though, because those in the martini were a little diabetic. We also tried the mozzarella sticks which were tasty. They didn't appear or taste as if someone reached into a giant bag in the freezer and got them out. Actually tasted fresh. The complimentary bread and ricotta was delicious. I ate the Chicken Parm. The chicken was pounded very nicely and was lightly breaded and fried, just as a chicken cutlet should be. The side of pasta was perfectly al dente. I ate every bit of it. Of the other items that were ordered (which I also tried) was a pizza with fig, blue, balsamic, and other things. I can't remember the name but it was very tasty, we all liked the crust and fresh ingredients. Also ordered the penne alla vodka dish but asked for fettuccine noodles instead of penne, which they accommodated. The noodles and sauce were very good and the dish had pancetta in it. Our compliments to the chef for a tasty dinner. \\nLet talk service: It's the small things...ya know? The two gentlemen who served us were both new. One was their first day and the other only a few days in. After seated and given water, it was probably 15-20 minutes before drink orders were taken. We weren't in a rush so no big deal. Other observations/experiences...we had to stop our server from running off a few times, once in the middle of taking our food order and another time during a drink order (he took off before getting everyone's order)...once to clean off the table between apps and dinner...and once to take the enormous menus off the table. He wasn't being rude, he just seemed to be hustling and inexperienced. None of the food came out at the same time and one of the ordered dishes didn't get put into the system. It was quickly resolved and the manager even gave us a few free beers to make up for it but the awkward thing was how it was explained. our server blamed the kitchen and said \\"our chef is horrible\\". I interjected and told him that the chef cooks good food. When the manager came out to apologize and comp some beers, he blamed the server for not keying it into the system (with the server standing there).  It was just strange. We weren't upset or angry...we kind of expected a hit or miss going there. The space the restaurant occupies is cursed, nothing seems to survive there more than a few months.\\n\\nLastly, (again... small things) we hit up the restroom before leaving. The sink in the women's room lets our only the slightest trickle of water...took forever to rinse my hands...the soap dispenser needs new batteries and the toilet has an automated flushing system but also has a toilet seat cover on it. \\n\\nI'll probably go back in a couple/few months if it is still open (which I am pulling for it), hopefully the service will have matured and they will get the kinks out.

The sesame chicken is thinly sliced and breaded so it's a bit on the tough side but the flavor is good. I was expecting more heat since it had the spicy designation on the menu. It was all sweet!

The type of burger that you eat and then realize that most other burgers you eat don't let the flavor of the beef shine, but rather drown it in a sea of sauces and toppings.

But, damn it, if those 5 slices of steak weren't in our top 3 tastes of steak ever! (And I eat a LOT of steak.) It's possible that we just went on a really good night, because I've had friends go at different times and, of course, the menu changes every day, and their experiences weren't as good as ours was.

However, we was very MIA throughout our meal.\\n\\nTo tell you the truth, it's not that \\"romantic.\\" When you hear the world what do you think of? Dim lights... soft music...candles...cozy seating. Well, sounds lovely, but it was quite opposite. Bright, longer tables for two so it was awkward to hold hands, and very loud. \\n\\nWould I be back?

When I asked about the outdoor tables, and even mentioned which tables specifically were open, the hostess laughed. in. my. face. I should've walked out right then.\\n\\nInstead, my family and I were seated and proceeded to make our selections from four menus (for a party of five), one drink menu, and one ripped paper specials sheet. The food was edible but entirely unremarkable (two of us had lobster rolls, which were generously portioned and tasted fresh, two of us had baked haddock-- definitely tasted defrosted-- and one had lobster mac and cheese, which was rubbery and pretty flavorless, though it did have some discernible chunks of lobster in it). Beer selection in bottles and on tap was slim, and for some reason, one glass of Sauvignon Blanc took longer to get to the table than our entrees, despite having placed the order as soon as we sat down.\\n\\nIt wasn't the worst place I've been for dinner, but I won't be back.

He looked at us, didn't say anything, and pointed to a table in the back.  Food was ok.  Nothing to rave about, but I only had a simple spaghetti dish.  When the check came, we wanted to split it equally with three credit cards (since there were three of us) - something that has been done for me at every other restaurant that cares about its customers.

NO, because the host was absent for a minimum of 10 minutes. Can you ask the guy behind the bar, right beside the door, how long the wait will be? NO, that's the host's job. When the host arrived, did he ask for a name and a party size? No. That's your job. Get on the list if you can.

The crust is thin and bland. The real problem was that there was a strip of plastic fried up in the squid legs. Battered and fried, it blended in so well. GROSS!

For $5.50 you get a double cheeseburger and fries, one of the better deals around. The double cheeseburger, although composed of two 4oz patties, added up to a half pound of delicious beef. A possibly overseen benefit of this is that my medium-cooked burger came out in a fraction of the time I expected it, unlike at other places that would use one half-pound patty and make you wait almost twenty minutes. I was hungry, I wanted good food, and I wanted it fast - and I got it. A triple burger would equate to 3/4 lbs of beef and would likely come out in the same short time if one is hungry enough and impatient like me.\\nThe service seemed like it varied somewhat, we sat at the bar and one tender was really friendly and attentive while the other seemed like she wanted to get off work as soon as possible. We didn't really care too much as long as we got what we wanted - beer, of which there is a large selection, and good food at a great price.

I practically rolled out of the door and laughed the entire time I was there, so I don't know if it gets better than that.\\n\\nFirst of all, I really like the atmosphere of this place.  The kitchen is highly visible, the chefs present their own dishes, and the place is brightly lit so that you can see all the nice little things they put in your food.  \\n\\nService here is excellent, and all the chefs are incredibly nice.  You can tell they take pride in their food.  My favorite is when they get carried away in the description of their food, and I have no idea what is happening.  \\n\\nHere is what I remember of what we had:\\nbrisket, pork belly, shrimp and grits, sunchokes, beef slices with pearl onions, some sort of bean dish that tasted slightly Indian-ish, lamb breast, salad with goat cheese, pork meatballs with cauliflower, fried risotto.  I can't remember the rest of the food because it felt like it was nonstop, but all of it was amazing.  They are a meat heavy place, so it might be tough for the veggies.   Everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I'm really not a huge fan of bacon, but I could tell some care and love went into Gillespie's famous bacon jam.  \\n\\nDessert included a cakey play on thin mints, pumpkin cake, and banana pudding/creme br√ªl√©e.  I feel like I should bust out into a few verses of the Sound of Music's \\"Few of My Favorite Things\\" at this point.\\n\\nWe completely nerded out when Kevin Gillespie came to our table and requested a picture.  He suggested we take one a little later when we could get a good shot of the Gunshot sign and the kitchen.  About an hour later, he came to our table to remind us about our picture.  The best part of this is that some of the other chefs did some excellent photobombs.  These people seem like they work hard but really like each other.\\n\\nOverall, incredible food (menu changes frequently as well) and a really fun atmosphere.

The style of service was certainly unique and a fun novelty for a night out, but I'm not sure I'd want that on a regular basis. Basically, they come out and offer you courses one at a time, and you can say how many you want. However, you cannot go back and accept a previously offered course once it has passed by. I'm unsure why this is the case. It makes it difficult because you do not always know what you will like, and so how much of each thing to get, but anyway it did not sour my experience. The food I had was varied and delicious. Many of the dishes were cleverly constructed and I was not really disappointed with anything, but I was not blown away by any one particular item.

I had the garden salad which was good.  Her entree was scallops which I tasted and, though not a huge scallop fan, I thought was really good.  I got the shrimp and grits which had a caramel type sauce.  The grits were good and the shrimp were large.  For dessert, I had the bread pudding, which again was good, and my date had the apple crisp which she liked.  The theme here, however, is that everything was just good.  Not great, nothing of any particular note.  For the price range, I think the food should have been more memorable.  Also, the service left a little to be desired.  While our server was quite friendly, she messed up my request to substitute asparagus for the broccolini (which was permissible even on the special menu) and they originally brought me the apple crisp dessert as well.

Both times I went, old French popular music (Edith Piaf?) was playing in the background.\\n\\nCrepeBerry's menu is vegetarian, with plenty of gluten-free and vegan options (both are $2 extra for crepes.) In addition to the crepes and toasts, they have acai bowls, bagels, smoothies, tea (from Mem Tea) and coffee (Jim's Organic Coffee.)\\n\\nI've only tried the crepes so far. The You Say Potato is filled with sweet potato mash drizzled with balsamic, with sour cream on the side. It's a cool idea and I liked the sour cream combination with the sweet potatoes, but the balsamic wasn't very well distributed and the parts without it were kind of bland. The Vermont Berry has raspberry cream cheese (as well as fresh raspberries), maple syrup, and walnuts. The raspberry cream cheese is an interesting combination of flavors, but the crepe itself was kind of stuck to the plate and I ended up having to scrape it up.\\n\\nI also had a mocha because I felt like I needed to buy something to keep using the wi-fi (which is free), but I'm not much of a coffee drinker so I can't really judge it.

I wore a nice pair of jeans and dress shirt, which was just shy of the average dress. I would recommend, dress pants and solid pair of shoes, blazer optional. But by no means is the restaurant stuffy or too uptight, no one seemed to have an issue with my attire and there were others with jeans on, just not the majority.\\n\\nNow on to the food....Which is flavorful, unique, yet simplistic with Northwestern Flair. I had the wild game sampler, which featured 3 different types of game meat all cooked with solid flavor and texture. I wish the portion would have been a bit bigger but it was not a let down after tasting the meal. My girlfriend has the grass fed steak prepared medium. I personally like my steak cooked well done, but this steak was perfectly flavored, not overdone but still hearty and succulent. The portion was very big, enough for me to have about a third and she still had plenty for herself. I would highly recommend any of their steaks based on this one choice. Be AWARE dinner doesn't not come with any sides, but the sides you can order are big enough for two. We had the twice baked potato at dish. Wow,\\nI don't think I've ever had this dish prepared so well, and the thick cut bacon on top, took it to a whole new level. This is a must as a side. The house cornbread comes out in a little tin can (example of - simplistic with NW flair) and it cooked perfectly, the texture is soft but with a full flavor and substance. Some of the best corn bread I've had at a restaurant.\\n\\nOnly complaints.... and I would classify them more as wishes, not complaints, because the meal and service was great, would be that the meals included a side and there was more of a seafood selection and my portion was larger.

You can smell the great food from seemingly a mile away. I love this place, but there are caveats to make noteworthy. it may not be suitable to evereone's liking. In spite of the greatness there are some problems.\\n\\nTHE GOOD: Huge sandwich that is as tasty as it is generously portioned & stuffed with meat and cheese; Cool & off the beaten path location (feels like I am far from Atlanta proper); The eccentric staff and spectrum / gamut of clientele going in and out / great people watching spot; They specialize in a short list of items and make those things exceptionally well, often spot on perfect. I like how you pay at the point your food is ready (rather than pay at the register before your food is made). The fries are solid / perfectly executed. The sandwich bread is sheer perfection / the best. One sandwich with a side of fries is the perfect amount for two people at the lunchtime hour.\\n\\nTHE BAD: Something this good in a decadent way can't be good for you; Hard to get to from anywhere but Stone Mountain; The long wait time and the Cheesesteak Nazi's attitude (CALL AHEAD TO ORDER!!! - SERIOUSLY! NO JOKE!). Tempers / egos can flare up on both sides of the counter, so be aware; Limited menu and no place to eat inside (mostly, if not completely, takeout food setup). The food, though very, very good takes a long time from point you order to the point it is ready for you to pick up & pay (30 minutes typically) maybe shorter or longer than that.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line: Best Cheesesteak in Atlanta period.

Since this was my first time, I went for the surf and got me a Shrimp Salad po' boy. This isn't some sissy salad here. The sandwich was huge, and packed full of scrumptious goodness to make each bite full of flavors and textures as it's spilling out of the toasted bread that contains it! \\n\\nLet's go through the mondo bite, shall we? You have the initial crunch of the toasted bread going on, which will then take you to your true first impression of this po' boy bad boy: the wonderful combination of the crisp bite of the jumbo shrimp and the crunch of the cole slaw all mixed in a creamy sauce that's not overwhelmingly mayo-y (ew) but gives the right amount of tang. I know creamy sounds heavy and bad, but this sandwich was fresh and delicious! And if this wasn't good enough, that one single bite is followed by random pops of sourness from a few pickles which are complimented by the creamy yet firm chunks of avocado. (There's also tomato and maybe something else up in there, but take it more so as an addition to your 5-a-day of veggie servings). And a mondo bite it must be to capture all of these flavors all at once! Ask for a fork to scoop up the inevitable fallen soldiers. \\n\\nWe were served by Priscilla who's ... how would you explain her? She just has this genuine, down-to-earth presence like you can hang with her at her retro-cool beach shack or something. And it's sorta like that in their lot! There's this organic feel to it all.  If they're not busy inside cooking away, they sit outside as if you're chilling in their backyard with them. During peak business lunch hours, there are tables people can stand around to quickly grab, eat, and go... and maybe meet a few new friends! :) But if you want to make it more of an intimate setting, then sit on the two-seater swing and relax from all the hustle and bustle. \\n\\nOh man! And the best part? These substantial sandwiches will totally satisfy your drunken appetite when you're stumbling out of the bars at 2am because they're open until 3am! Yeaaaah boooy!

I'd give Salts 3.8 stars based solely upon the price of the 1 thing we tried, which was indeed delicious, but not quite $34/person delicious.\\n\\nI've walked by Salts for about 2 decades and never got around to trying it until now. I went with a friend and we pre-ordered only 1 item: the Whole Roasted Boneless Duck for Two (with Lavender Honey Glaze, Roasted Pears, Heirloom Carrots, and Petite Farm Turnips). Price for this was $68. To ensure availability, the duck needs to be ordered a day in advance.\\n\\nWhen I called a day ahead of time for a reservation, I made it clear that we'd be in a rush. The restaurant opens at 6pm, and we needed to leave by 7:15pm. When we arrived, we were seated immediately, and the wait staff knew that we needed prompt service and acted accordingly. They were extremely prompt, polite, and efficient throughout the meal. Our water glasses were refilled frequently (without prompting), napkin was folded when I returned to the table after using the restroom, little bread balls were promptly replaced (again without prompting) when we'd finish the ones on our plates. In short, the service at Salts was impeccable. It could not have been better in any way.\\n\\nAs I mentioned before, the duck was the only item we got. However, before the duck arrived, our server delivered a nice amuse bouche of what I think was butternut squash soup with a nice sweet mousse on top. The flavors were spectacular, and it left us wanting more.\\n\\nThe duck was really nicely done. As others have said, the portions are huge -- 1.5 very full plates per person (I eat a lot, and I was pretty full after just the duck). The skin was perfectly crispy and flavorful. The meat was juicy, the veggies were tender, and the bread crumb stuffing was heavenly. I would've liked more of the lavender honey glaze and/or another roasted pear (the most flavorful item on the plate), because many mouthfuls of duck could've used a bit more flavor. This was true comfort food -- the sort of entree you'd order on a cold winter day, when you want to go upscale from something like the S&S in Inman Square.\\n\\nBottom line:  Salts is very much worth trying, though it's a bit too pricey. In my opinion, the duck entree that we got should have been priced at $28/person (i.e., just under $60 for two). Now that I've had the duck, I'd like to sample some of their other items.

Even though we live just around the corner, it took an hour for our pizza to arrive, and when it did, we were not happy with it. We figured a margherita pizza was a safe choice, but it arrived with almost no cheese on it at all. The pizza was 80% red sauce. You could have fit all the cheese on this pizza onto one slice. No one in the house wanted to eat this thing.\\n\\nWhen I called to say we wanted our money back, the manager yelled at me and told me I was being ridiculous. He told me to email him a picture of the pizza! He offered to take the pizza back and give us another one, but my family did not want another one. He refused to give us our money back. When my mother called and asked to speak to him, he hung up on her. She was so pissed off she drove the friggin' thing back to the pizza parlor to show them how gross it was. I wasn't happy about the scene she caused, but I've never encountered a restaurant manager who cared so little about the quality of his food and the happiness of his customers, nor have we been treated so badly. This whole thing was like a bad episode of Kitchen Nightmares.\\n\\nNow I'm out $20 and had to settle for a shitty frozen pizza from 7/11.

Having it been only two weeks upon opening, their crew is very attentive to our needs and requests. I believe there are corporate trainers present roaming around the floor. It's not too bad at all. You'll get your request in a jiffy. \\n\\nI have a bone to pick about the drinks that they are pushing too. I feel a little overwhelmed and bullied to a point that it is almost being forced to us. And if you'll push for Brazilian drinks, there are tons of Brazilian drinks. Even the non-alcoholic ones. You tend to push the tourist and national favorites. The bar seemed to be loaded with the basic bar items and decent wine selection. \\n\\nWhat about sugar cane?What about pineapple juice? Passion fruit? Coconut? You don't have them huh?

Do I have terrible feelings for this restaurant?  Yes.\\n\\nI used to live walking distance from this place way back before yelp existed to me and there was a time when I came here probably every morning for a latte.  I found it endearing how packed this place would get with nuclear families and ladies who lunch, and how the same exact waitress never recognized me after weeks of being her customer the same time every morning, and I used to think of their food presentation as some kind of accidentally nouveau still life plating attempt with the way they would just plop a whole artichoke in the center of a bare plate or throw the chips on top of my sandwich because they just didn't even care to put them to the side.\\n\\nThat's the romance of Marco's.  \\n\\nAnd you enjoy this restaurant for its charming mediocrity...until you get a bad service experience.  Here's the worst I've had, which happens to also be the most recent:  I walked in with one other person and three guys were waiting already, and they had been there for 15 minutes.  The waitress crossed them off and seated them.  We went to sign up for the wait list but, uhhh, they had a table open...?  Actually they had four 4-seaters totally cleared and ready to roll, not including the one they just used for the three guys.  Okay..sucks for them to be waiting I guess.   \\n\\nWe get our menus from the same waitress, the three guys who are now seated beside us order, and we order 20 seconds later.  We wait about five minutes and someone is seated behind us, different waiter.  We wait 10 minutes, and we are updated that our food will be coming out shortly.  The people behind us get their food.  Wow, that waiter's on it.  The three guys get their food.  We don't even get eye contact.  It's okay.  But we start running out of natural conversation.  The people behind us scarf down their food and get their check, and I tell myself they're just fast eaters.  Many more minutes pass, and the people behind us are long gone and moving on with their day.  The three guys, following the theme here, finish their food too.\\n\\nFinally I see a flash of green coming from the kitchen.  Is that my 'still life of the avocado grilled cheese sandwich on Franz bread with windblown potato chips?'  Yes!  Just in time for the waitress to snatch up the three guys' empty plates and calculate their tab.  I go into an inside voice discussion with my dining partner about how I cannot believe the poor time management of the kitchen this morning, which is now early afternoon.  But the real culprit reveals itself as I bite into a squishy mess of congealed, oily cheese and soggy toast.  The homemade chips are soggy too, which can sometimes happen if you leave fried food sitting on top of itself for 20 minutes.  My friend's eggs are actually completely cold.  We flag down our waitress and ask what's the deal with our chilly old food, and we don't even get something half-assed about a waiter being sick or a busy day.  She just asks if we're going to be able to finish it, or did we just want our check now, and she actually grabs my plate in anticipation that I'm really going to throw away food and then pay for it.  This is one of just four times in my restaurant-filled life that I don't leave any tip, and when I apologize and politely explain why I can't monetarily reward the service she just starts clearing the table and walks away while I'm in mid sentence.\\n\\nDon't let this happen to you and ruin your appreciation of the otherwise charming mediocrity that is Marco's.  Because for me, the endearment is gone, and no longer can I enjoy the checked out waitresses and general thoughtless-effortlessness of the place.  If I wanted a 25 minute old fried egg I could easily make that happen at home and keep my 10 dollars.  And keep the chips off my sandwich."},{"name":"Grill 23 & Bar","address":"161 Berkeley St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"If I could give this steak House more stars I would.

We arrived at 12:25 PM with a 12:30 reservation and were seated immediately. It took 35 minutes before a waiter even took a drink order, and it was nearly an hour before any food arrived. There was only a Sunday Brunch menu available (this was not mentioned on the website). Two of us had Moules Frites (one marniere and one curry), and they were excellent along with very good frites. The third person had Coq au Vin, which was on the greasy side and relatively flavorless. The bread was not up to par, essentially a roll that lacked a good crust and a soft inside. The basket of viennoiserie had a super croissant, two pain au chocolate, and a blueberry muffin that was tasteless and did not belong in the company of the others. The Vouvray wine was crisp and fresh but the Cotes de Rhone was stale (perhaps the bottle had been opened the day before). In general, the service was slow and inattentive.

I've experienced better\\". And that's exactly right with this place. Is it terrible? No--it's not. The drinks were pretty good (cocktails) and the service was decent. The food, however, was simply not good. I read some other reviews about the food being bland, and I couldn't agree more. There was no depth of flavor in either of the dishes we ordered--in fact--it tasted incredibly underseasoned. They do market themselves as a 'healthier' Chinese restaurant, and I sure hope the food is healthier because sheesh it was sooo bland! Also, our tab was over 100$ and I left relatively hungry. \\nPros: Good cocktails, decent service, interesting ambiance\\nCons: Expensive, bland food. \\nWould not recommend the Beijing Duck (42$). The menu says it takes 30-45min to prepare, but when we received it it was room temperature. I would have thought if something takes 30-45min to prepare (and stated on the menu as such) it would come out sizzling hot because it's so fresh. Not the case with the duck. I've had much better duck at less-expensive eateries. Also, be weary about the \\"scallion\\" pancakes that come with the duck (or any other dish--just look out for it). They were literally flour tortillas. I wish I were joking--but no--the Chinese scallion pancakes were actually flour tortillas you would use to make a burrito or taco. Very weird.

No, I didn't."},{"name":"Jam Cafe on Beatty","address":"556 Beatty Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"I've been waiting to come back to Jam Cafe since Victoria day last year and again, it did not disappoint. It took quite long to get back here because of the never ending and always present line ups. But I have gathered that between 8-9 am are the best times to go. You'll need to force yourself to wake up early on those days off just to make it here before a line up starts!\\n\\nGoing on to the food, the first time I had the daily special which was a lemon meringue waffle. The curd was perfectly tart and not overly sweet. The waffle itself I couldn't remember too much of.. but I would say it's not as good as the waffles from Nero's.\\nMy partner in crime decided on the gravy coupe. It was definitely delicious, especially with their home-made jalape√±o sauce. I think the only complaint he had was that there wasn't enough gravy for him to finish everything on his plate. A big portion of the biscuit was left untouched.\\n\\nThis time, I had the soup of the day which was chorizo corn chowder and the infamous red velvet pancake. Neither disappointed. The chowder had a more soup-y consistency than a chowder, but the flavour was there and there was TONS of chorizo. They did NOT skimp on the ingredients. Red velvet pancake was absolutely worth every calorie. I ordered just the half order (thank god!) - which is just ONE HUMONGOUS pancake covered with cream cheese icing. I'm still eating the leftovers for it whilst writing this review. The part that they did very well with this red velvet was that it actually HAD the chocolate flavour to it (unlike most places). I'm loving it even after microwaving it.\\nPartner this time had the salmon benny. He said he was afraid he couldn't finish the full order, but he scarfed down the entire thing within minutes. That's not to say that the portion was small, he just couldn't stop eating it! Again, paired with that jalape√±o sauce, boyfriend didn't have a chance. Side note that I wanted to mention was that when ordering, they give you a choice of how well done you want your poached egg to be. That was a nice touch. \\n\\nOverall service is great. The only thing I dislike is that it's very popular and I can't bring myself to wake up at 7:30 on weekends to come here before the line starts!

Unfortunately, I couldn't see past some of the more glaring issues:\\n\\n1) I no longer have any money, and I don't feel any fuller for it.  The chefs will bring by small plates of their dishes, they'll describe them, and give you the option to take however many plates of it that you want.  They were all wonderful and interesting, but small.... And very expensive. I mean like, $15-20 dollars per plate expensive.  Split among 6 people, we easily spent $70 per person, but I just couldn't help but feel like I didn't get the balance of quality and quantity that $70 should afford.\\n\\n2) I had no idea what anyone was saying. Not the waiter, not the bartender, not the chefs coming by to describe the meal, not my friends... Nobody. This place is relatively small and very very loud.  Not that the restaurant can really control that.. But it definitely clashes with the connection that you can tell they are trying to make between the guests and the kitchen. \\n\\n3) I'm sorry, but this is a cheap gripe: if you're going to rep Georgia so hard in this place, you need to AT LEAST have more local beer on the menu.

When I stopped by last Thursday they had a just 5 entree choices:\\n\\n(1) A miserable Navrattan Korma (way to creamy, and the veggies were so mushy they seemed almost pureed)\\n(2) Chicken Curry (low-grade, sinewy cuts of chicken, unispired tomato-pastey curry)\\n(3) Chana Masala (not bad, but watery masala sauce was a let down)\\n(4) Dal Curry (again, this seemed like it had been sitting in the buffet tray for far too long - and I got there just before noon!)\\n(5) Aloo Gobhi (the best of the bunch, but could have used more cauliflower)\\n\\nThey did have tandoori chicken, but it was totally forgetable.  The pakoras were a little greasy fried a bit too hard, and I'm just not a fan of the bread pakora (or bhajji, depending on who you ask) in general, so I can't say whether this was worse than most.\\n\\nI CAN tell you that what they passed off as \\"naan\\" was a freaking joke!  Andy W hit the nail on the head - this was OBVIOUSLY toasted pita bread.  Dry, crunchy, terrible!\\n\\nThey had both sweet tamarind and spicy green mint chutneys.  The former was too watery, while the latter was actually pretty good...but taking pride in the fact that 50% of your chutneys are good, when so much else was average or below average, would be like a fancy steakhouse serving you a sub-Sizzler-quality sirloin with a burnt baked potato and wilted salad, but decent steak sauce.\\n\\nIn a buffet you usually have minimal contact with the servers - and that's probably for the best given the stoic nature of the staff here.  They did leave a full pitcher of water on my table, so there is that.\\n\\nIndia Grill could...no, SHOULD be so much better.  It's in a great location at 30th and East Burnside.  The building is charming and has character, with a nice view of the street from the upstairs dining area (be advised, they don't seem to have ANY seating downstairs, and the flight of stairs is a bit narrow and steep - not wheelchair friendly, and probably a bit difficult of you are mobility challenged).\\n\\nNot to mention the fact that there is a serious dearth of quality Indian restaurants in Portland.  Why is it we seem to have a Thai or Vietnamese restaurant on every corner, but in the entire city we have only about 6-7 Indian restaurants...and most of them are either too expensive (Bombay Cricket Club, Plainfield's Mayur, East India Co.), not that authentic, or both (Vinalho).\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, I love that we have so many Thai and Vietnamese places - there are so many choices we end up with a Darwinian \\"survival of the fittest\\", so the overall quality is pretty good.\\n\\nCan't someone just open a reasonably priced, decent Indian restaurant here in Portland, or do I have to drive out west to the 'burbs every time I want to sit down and have a quality vindaloo or masala?  It seems to be a no-brainer - Indian food is very vegetarian-friendly, is a diverse form of cuisine (curries, dosas, biryanis, tandoori kebobs, etc), and should be relatively inexpensive.  It can be made to accommodate many dietary restrictions (rice flour instead of wheat for gluten-intolerant folks, very little dairy for the lacto-phobes).\\n\\nSo, why did I even give India Grill 2*s?  Well, 1* for being Indian food, and a second * for being close to home.  That's it.\\n\\nHonestly, if this place had even a moderate amount of competition they would have to seriously improve or go out of business.  But as long as India Grill is one of only 2 or 3 Indian restaurants in East Portland, they can probably keep getting away with it, which is very disappointing."},{"name":"Cheerful Tortoise","address":"1939 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"We had a group of 15 and Gina, our server,  was fantastic.

Read on for the full story.\\n\\nThe wait on a Thursday evening wasn't bad - the longest part was simply being acknowledged by the host.  Sat down with a couple Peronis and the roasted pear salad.  The pears were yummy and sweet but the mixed greens were bulky and awkward and required brisk slicing and dicing - an effort welcomed with thick cuts of meat but not salad.  The crispy calamari pizza was tackled better with fork and knife and the portabello mushroom pizza, while simpler, delighted with the sweet sting of garlic and caramelized onions.  The pizza was good, but honestly, Upper Crust takeout down the street is better and cheaper.\\n\\nHere's the turning point.  I was masticating calamari when suddenly I bit down on something hard and sharp that just didn't seem right.  Squid don't have shells, right?  From my mouth I plucked a deep fried piece of shredded plastic.  Revolted by the idea of recyclables in my food and worried that this calamity might have affected others' dishes, I alerted the waitress.  She informed me that this has NEVER happened, that the chef will henceforth personally look over everything leaving the kitchen and that the pizza will of course be stricken form the bill.  \\n\\nI'm sure that Figs didn't intend to poison me physically or emotionally with their trash, but whether real or imagined, I left  with some digestive discomfort.

Both were unbelievable; the scallops and foie gras were incredibly savory, and my girlfriend's beet salad was sweet and complex at the same time.  For entrees, I ordered the beef and she ordered cod; we both felt like the main ingredients took a backseat to the other flavors on the plate.

Alas we thought why not give it another shot during lunch. Where to begin....lets see. Well when we first walked in we were greeted by a very charming scowling woman who i believe was mute bc she didnt dare speak a word to us the whole time. We were seated quickly and before we could even sit down she demanded our drink order. Cool i guess il get a water and saki  bc i had no clue at this point what they had bar wise. After she took our drink order and brought it to us she quickly went and sat down at the table across from us to enjoy with all the other servers and cooks and every single employee in the building their own lunch. At noon. In the middle of lunch rush. Next to a guests table. The place just opened at 11. Another server who must of seen us staring at them turned around to get our lunch order. Clearly she didnt like us disturbing them during their lunch time or maybe our stares were making it hard for them to eat there noodles in peace and felt the need to actually work and take our order.

So about 35 min later scowling noodle slurper brings us our food. Its smells of wet dog and looks amazingly disgusting. What the heck though maybe it tastes better. Nope.

The only bad thing about the place was they way were greeting by their hostess. There was a table for 6 that was about to become free and still she reluctantly didn't want to give it to us at 9:45 pm stating that it was reserved for another group. After we sat at the bar for like 15 min and kept eyeing the empty table she finally came over to us and said the other party wasn't showing up and that we could have it........Anyhow we were compensated quite well with an amazing waiter, George. He was great and made us feel so welcomed, which by the way, hostesses usually should do (just saying). I looked at the table and there was a crushed red pepper shaker, you have to respect a place that puts that on the table right away....loved it! The pizza was great, we tried 3 different kinds, oliver's, the eggplant and the chicken. All were really good and the pizza comes in a big size with a thin crust. My favorite was the eggplant.

The bartender was energetic and friendly. I had a martini that was excellent. My girl had a 'mid mountain' as recommended by the bartender. It was so delicious, she had a second one. \\n\\nThe host took us to a table that was in a corner surrounded by shelves of freshly canned goods in mason jars. Very romantic and homey. \\n\\nNow the bad. This is a steakhouse that specializes in steak dinner. My girl ordered the 8oz tenderloin. The steak was hard to cut with a steak knife and even harder to chew. It was completely flavorless. It was like eating shoe leather. We had them take it away, and they did remove it from the bill, but you would expect a $48 steak at a steakhouse would be tender and full of flavor. I ordered the 12oz ribeye which I then shared with my girl. It was ok, not anything great.\\n\\nMaybe we just got a bad cut of meat which is understandable.

A restaurant can hide behind tempura, sauces, cream cheese and gimmicks, but in the sashimi, you can really tell the true quality of the fish. I am also going to list prices, not that I mind paying more for better fish, nor do I want \\"discount\\" sushi, but just for a general comparison. I also am ONLY grading sushi, not the other dishes, and not the decor, ambience or even service (unless it's really shitty). Because I want the freshest fish possible (and again to be systemically fair), I will only eat on Thurs, Fri or Sat nights (because usually fish is delivered on Thursday for the weeekend.) \\n\\nI was pleasantly surprised at Kenobi. It's very pretty and slick looking, so I was worried. I ordered: Salmon sashimi $10, Yellowtail sashimi $10, Mackerel sushi $2.25 but just for once piece, Uni $4.50 for one piece, and one fun roll called Surf and Turf $11. \\n\\nSalmon and yellowtail: arranged in a fancy flower-pot-full-o-ice displays (which I personally don't like; just stick it on a freakin' plate!) You could tell the fish had been frozen then defrosted,  which is the standard for U.S. sushi places, I've eaten fish that has been fresh, and it makes a world of difference. Despite that,  the salmon was very good; not oh my god, melt in your mouth good, but fairly high quality, good flavor. The yellowtail was excellent as well. Not too bland nor mushy, which happens often. \\n\\nMackerel: again, good. Mackerel is tricky because I don't think  traditional mainstream America likes it (very oily and fish), so maybe it doesn't move as fast). Texture could have a been better, but the taste was very good. \\n\\nUni: I know there are several grades of uni (this sea urchin roe), and this was...adequate. The lobes of it were not completely intact, more in chunks and kinda small, whereas in good uni, you have one big ol yellow furry tongue shaped piece (sounds appetizing, right? It's delicious actually.) Taste was okay. Definitely not the highest quality. \\n\\nRoll: the selection of rolls was very limited here (okay by me because I don't particularly eat them). So I chose the surf and turf because it sounded most creative. It had cooked beef on top, \\"krab\\" stick in the middle and some mayonaissey sauce on top. Okay. nothing to write home about. \\n\\nHowever, I am giving Kenobi 4 stars, because the quality of the sashimi was so far one of the best in Austin. I thought the price for sashimi was very good. Not the best place to go if you're just into \\"sushi for white people\\" - i.e. rolls full of fried stuff and sauces. \\n\\nThe waitress was very good, by the way, but that didn't factor into my score."},{"name":"Winter Park Fish Company","address":"761 Orange Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"Went here because of the strong reviews.

They coordinated with the hotel staff (the restaurant is located in the XV Beacon hotel) and offered to give us a ride to the parking garage once the valet was back.

It's quieter, the wait staff's a bit friendlier, and you get more personal space.  You a little more rock and roll?  Get up to the second floor where one of the better jukeboxes in town is blaring, the crowd's a bit rowdier, the seats and booths a bit wobblier, the restrooms (Men's at least) bit on the scary side, and where the beer is flowing like wine... so to speak.  They have a good selection of beers too, even though some bartenders don't know how to pour them.  The Hoegarden is a favorite -- comes is a glass your girlfriend might need two hands for.  It's big.  And tasty.\\n\\nThe food is cheap, man.  And that's what you get.  You get a cheese burger with fries for three bucks -- how can you complain?

It was mediocre, nothing spectacular for price paid. Based on this experience, will probably think twice about coming here again."},{"name":"Grill 23 & Bar","address":"161 Berkeley St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"By far my favorite steakhouse around!! I've been here on many occasions and have nothing but exceptional things to say of this restaurant. I'm a firm believer that every steak I've ordered rom here has been more than worth the cost of of the meal. With that being said, once I've finished my meal at this restaurant I am already looking forward to the next time I will be here to enjoy another meal.\\n\\nThe first time I went here I ordered the Filet Mignon and thought it was great. I found it comparable to the Filet's that I had at the Capital Grille, Morton's, etc. I thought it lived up to what a good Filet was supposed to be. After going here a couple of times I really wanted to try a new cut. So I ended up trying the \\"New York Strip\\". I thought it was another good steak, but I did not feel it really had the flavor I was looking for. Next time i tried the dry aged NY Strip, and this is where I was really impressed. All arguments aside about Aged & Dry Aged having no real differences, this Dry Aged Sirloin is forever the steak I will order from here. That's where I stand on the steaks.\\n\\nRegarding the appetizers and side dishes those I wouldn't complain about either. The chowder was great, I'm particular to a lot of potatoes in the chowder, so I got lucky and had plenty of them. I also had a fried calamari appetizer that was flavored very well. I couldn't get enough of it.\\n For side dishes, I'm usually with a few picky eaters so I generally have to keep it simple. Mashed potatoes are good. Their tobacco onions are good. Hash browns are good, and the asparagus was just as most asparagus is. \\n\\nAside from the food on the menu, the wine menu was pretty large. Most bottles were pretty pricey, with fewer that were on the low end range. I think each bottle I've ordered from here was around $80.00. Which nobody really wants to spend on a bottle when you know the actual cost of the wine, but whatever. Another nice thing to share is that if you do spill something the staff gets right on it. My younger brother accidentally knocked over a bottle and 4 people came out of the woodwork and cleaned the table, changed the linens, and cleaned his clothing of any stains from the wine. Besides that the servers are very knowledgeable about what they are selling/serving to customers.\\n\\nOn top of all those good things, here is yet another positive experience about this restaurant. A friend that dines at this restaurant maybe 10 times a year had gone for dinner with his family one night. They ordered the foods they usually order and ate everything without any big issues. When asked how the meal was, he stated that he thought compared to most of his experience at the restaurant it wasn't as good. The server apologized and shortly after the manager came over and said that the entire meal was on the house this evening, and he apologized as well. My friend had no intention of trying to get his meal comped, and didn't want the server to feel that way either so he ended up tipping the server what the cost of the meal would have been plus what he would have tipped. To me, it shows they do care about pleasing their guests, and that is huge to me.\\n\\nThis isn't really a downside, but to me I think if you're looking for a quieter romantic environment I don't really consider this the restaurant for that. I'm not saying it isn't romantic, but some other restaurants in the city would be better choices for that."},{"name":"ParkGrounds","address":"142 Flat Shoals Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"PG is my go-to coffee shop to do freelance work several times a week, and my pup loves me all the more for it.

So if you don't like garlic, I would recommend getting the carbonated version. The only downfall of my experience was the shirazi salad.

Sketchy, if there aren't people, does that mean the food sucks? We were prepared to find out.

We each got an order and got our dinners \\"complete dinner\\" I got Chicken Vindaloo, my sister had Chicken Tikka Masala, and my friend got Chicken Saag. We got the veg platter as an appetizer. My coconut soup was nice and lean, and not too overpowering. The pakoras were nice and fresh and still very warm. Good sign. \\nOur food came out in stages, but we didn't want to make it any more awkward to order or explain anything to the waiter, cause we had already seemed to make eating out more complex than he was ready to deal with. \\nMy vindaloo was alright. It was a little lumpy, the sauce was a bit spicy and the oils were already separating when it was delivered to the table. The chicken was inedible by my standards. 90% stringy, and 10% fat. Really gross. I tried my friend's chicken saag, it was decent, the consistency was almost what I would ask for. \\nWe were full enough from pakoras and rice that desert, though a challenge we are accustomed to taking, was out of the question.

First off, we did not receive any crackers and instead burnt/blackened toast. We sent the toast back. The only fresh meat on the plate was a sausage and there was no cheese. Not charming or tasty. For the main entree, the entire table received family style side dishes that looked like a portion for 2 (butternut squash, stuffing, mashed potatoes and cranberry). The portion sizes were laughable. It certainly was the first Thanksgiving I left not feeling full! The dessert was another disappointment with the sizes of all being miniatures - not regular. The cobbler that 2 of us received was cold and not cooked all the way through. The cake that the 2 others got was dry and clearly cooked days in advance. For such a \\"nice\\" spot we were very sad with our evening. The ambiance was nothing special, the food and portion sizes negative and the service average.

When we came here we were greeted and taken to seats of our choosing. We had a 3 year old with us and he is nothing short of straight up picky. But no matter the request we flew at our waiter, shout out to Michael P., he without hesitation helped with everything we needed. Turning the ambiance music down, when he forgot to bring muffins he brought back more than plenty (and plus some to-go!), and the icing on the cake... Z-Tejas does not have toast and jam.. Which was what our 3 yr old wanted, and to our major surprise, he went back and found some Texas toast and honey. MAGIC MIKE HOST.

So much so that we frequently drove by to see if it was already open. \\n\\nWe are both lovers of Mexican cuisine, and although the place looks authentic the experience was everything but that. \\n\\nWe ordered 2 carne asada tacos, 1 black rooster taco and one chicken taco, plus an order of guacamole to go. When we got home and opened our bag we wanted to cry! They wrapped the two carne asadas and the chicken taco in foil wrap, and when we opened it it was all a mess of mixed meats and ingredients. Not to mention the portions, and believe me I do know that tacos are not supposed to be massive but only one piece of chicken was heartbreaking, and although the carne asada was flavorful the meat was actually pretty tough. \\n\\nWhat broke my heart even more was the size of the guacamole. I saw that for the people eating in the establishment they were getting a pretty good portion of it only to find when i opened my bag a really small container, pretty much the one they give you at chipotle, just about half of the portion I saw people being served for which we paid 6 dollars. Not to mention the lack of salt. It just felt like we were cheated a bit. \\n\\nThe decoration is beautiful and you can see that there are people that are happy to be working there but for the money, the total meal of 4 tacos and guacamole for 25 dollars seemed like a lot of money to still be here sitting and starving.

Called earlier in the day and was told I wouldn't need a reservation for 2 people and they only made reservations for 8 or more.  Got there at 7 and faced an hour wait - which wouldn't be terrible with enough 'rita.  Stood and sat at the bar for over 20 minutes before being helped - although we were acknowledged.  Then the guy made a 'rita but forgot to bring my friends beer.  He was totally flustered, while he had another person in the bar taking care of the people at the tables.\\nSo we waited our hour and 15 minutes and were seated at a table - in the little side room by the register.  If you EVER go here on a busy night NEVER let them seat you there.  The few times I've sat there, the staff totally ignores you.  So, there we are sitting at the tables, menus in hand, drinks EMPTY.

The chicken was so flavorful and wasn't overpowered by too many add ons. I'm usually a fan of tacos with tons of toppings, but the flavor of the chicken was so good that additional toppings would have just gotten in the way. Now, if that wasn't enough, I then moved in to the pork taco... That's when I fell in love. It was juicy. It was flavorful. It was spicy without being hot. It was gone in an instant. The tortillas were also amazing. They were soft without being mushy. I then moved on to the fried plantains. I had never had plantains before, so I had nothing to compare them to, but I have high hopes that all future plantains will be as amazing as these. They weren't over fried, but had a nice exterior and the insides held up nicely. They had a gentle butter flavor without being too overwhelming. I would highly suggest them. We then moved on to dessert. We had the flan as well as the tres leche cake. The flan was delightful! The texture was much more of a mouse consistency, and had a nice little kick at the end. The greatest leche cake was delicious! Incredibly moist and flavorful. It was definitely my favorite between the two. I had also (somewhat skeptically) ordered the hibiscus tea, and I was well rewarded it. It had a gentle floral taste that was sweet but not overwhelming.

We should have known it was going to be a long night when the host told us that they didn't take reservations, even though we had called them and indeed made a reservation. He told us he'd get us in quicker than it would normally take because of the mess-up, but it still took 50 minutes for us to be seated.\\n\\nAnd then there was the food. Fully half our orders were the wrong dishes (and we had a large group), and it took forever to get it.

Both of us refused to be beaten by it, and we both were at the \\"make the bad man stop\\" point by the time we finished it off.  The portion was thicker than some steaks I've eaten; and it was solid, flaky goodness from start to finish.  In fact, it might be one of the better pieces of fish I've ever had.  We were hungry for dinner, and apparently it's the same size of filet/piece that's used on the monster grouper sandwich.

Casa De Luz is sort of a complex of buildings where they offer classes.  Initially we were a little confused as to exactly where the restaurant was, but you just walk through the beautiful garden all the way to the last building.  You pay $12 per diner when you enter (no tipping), The menu for the day is posted when you enter - it includes beverage, soup, salad and entree.  There are no choices - it is a fixed menu that changes daily. You serve up your own beverage (hot or cold tea), soup and salad (the salad is prepared, not a salad bar) - cafeteria style.  The entree is brought to you by friendly staff.  You bus your own table when you are done eating.  The portions are plentiful and delicious, definitely worth the $12.  The atmosphere is great - more upscale than you'd imagine -, with huge tables that encourage strangers to dine together and share ideas. There is also an outdoor patio with smaller tables.  My boyfriend - NOT a vegan - felt it was a bit too hippie/communal for him at first, but was pleasantly surprised at the variety of people eating there:  families in jeans and t-shirts, couples in business attire.

The thin whole wheat crust is very well done, the traditional veg pizzas like the white spinach feta were delicious and full of flavor, and new taste combos like the coconut corn (which sounded, frankly, horrifying to me, but we ended up loving) and the BBQ paneer, were winners. The portobella mushroom w/curry leaf pistachio pesto is another favorite. They are generous and fair with the toppings and every pizza has been well cooked and well balanced. \\n\\nI've tried 4 drinks from their \\"vegan bar\\" (which you can sit at, and watch sports on one channel or Indian news on the other TV on the other side of the bar)  Favorite drink so far is Green Day. Note: it says kale, but they sub cilantro in instead, and didn't tell us, which is not cool in any respect, but especially not cool when one of our party has a violent dislike for cilantro. The staff are really friendly but don't seem to get that they should tell guests of substitutions. The homemade lemonade was not made for American palates, with salt added to it and not chilled it was too much like a strange bad margerita - nicely, the manager came out and offered to make a new one without salt which was very good. Many drinks seem to be a bit salty and I hope they learn to cut back on that - is it a lassi leftover? - I don't think it goes down well with the expectation of fresh juice. The Mango Mania had mango, cantaloupe, orange, and \\"orange pepper\\" (bell pepper I assume) and the pepper was clear, the fruits did not overwhelm it. I really liked this drink but a friend was disappointed it wasn't more traditionally fruit-sweet. Green Coriander drink was nice but also a tiny bit salty. The staff is very friendly and if you ask for modifications they seem to be happy to accomodate. \\n\\nThere are not many tables but on one night we called ahead and they reserved one for us; later we heard them tell another party that they could sit in their sister restaurant, Dosa N Curry, next door and they'd bring the food over. I'm guessing they share a kitchen? So seating may not be an issue. The seating is pretty pizza parlor-ish, the decor the same sweet, slightly wacky good-hearted vegetarian-homey feel as Dosa N Curry. The music is not too loud but at times was annoyingly teenage crap pop (we liked the Indian music though). \\n\\nOH AND THE NICE CREAM: YUM!! coconut and one soy based \\"ice cream\\" in about a dozen flavors that you can sample first, we loved the rich, deep chocolate and the berry and citrus flavors!!

Many childhood memories came back from dining at this restaurant, I do have to say they have really stepped it up a few notches from the orange colored fondue pot. Not only have the pot changed, but the foundue changes in the courses is what made the night SO much fun! \\n\\nThe first course we made a selection of cheese, I think there were about 10 to choose from. This was served with your traditional breads, veggie and not so traditional apples (which was really good). The second course was the cooking oil, wine, herbs, seasons and many more. This is where you select your main dish: Chicken, fish, steak, tuna, shrimp and actually cook your food at your table in your fondue pot. While the food is cooking you can talk, try some wine. After the food is done cooking they set out many different dipping sauces to try. The third and final course was my favorite chocolate fondue! We went with the \\"original\\" chocolate because it has peanut butter in it and I am a huge peanut butter fan. The tray of desserts that came out blew my mind, it had cheese cake, marshmallows, strawberries, rice crispy treats, brownies, and cake. Dining experience will be well over 2 hours.\\n\\nThe Melting Pot was fun and different from all the other restaurants. \\nMoney saver: If you don't want to spend a fortune by eating all three courses, I would advise you to at least stop in and order the chocolate fondue ~ it was WELL worth the money!"},{"name":"The Bagel Place","address":"300 Needham St","city":"Newton","stars":"4","text":"Had an awesome bagel with lox, capers, and onion on a garlic bagel and an iced tea.

With servers speaking English only slightly better than I speak Cambodian or Vietnamese I'm relatively certain that it was at this point that our server said \\"food out in 5 minutes but you order too much\\" and true to these words the first dishes arrived shortly thereafter as we sat picking at the vinegar soaked carrots, sweetened soy sauce, bean sprouts, fiery BBQ sauce, and dried spices that were meant to compliment our selections.\\n\\nWith only two of us present but wanting to make the most of our meal the first plate to arrive would be Prawn Ball Rice Noodle in Soup with Bean Sprouts and served in what can best be described as a punch bowl I instantly realized why our server had suggested we had ordered too much - both at our table and those around us the portions were gargantuan - but digging into the bowl with a spoon I was quickly reassured that although some would likely go to waste it would not be for lack of trying as everything about the dish from the starchy hand pulled noodles to the savory snappy balls of prawn was texturally lovely with flavors brought to a peak by the fatty and briny broth, an effect amplified even further with the addition of some of the dry spices leading us to consume all but a half-cup of broth and a few stray noodles by meal's end.\\n\\nServed as a duo the next pairing would feature one sweet and one savory, both seemingly present on every table in the restaurant - the Strawberry 'Moo Moo' Shake and the \\"Canh Ga Lan Bot,\\" or Deep Fried Chicken Wing with Lemon Pepper Sauce.  Beginning first with the smoothie, a relatively \\"familiar\\" dish consisting of pureed strawberries, condensed milk, ice cubes, and in this case coconut milk the concoction was light, flavorful, and airy like an Italian Ice but substantially more creamy and served with a thick straw it went quickly.  Moving next to the chicken, considered by many to be Phnom Penh's signature item, we opted for a half order for $8.00 and with 9 wings to the order not only was this a pretty good deal compared to many other purveyors of wings, it was also a hell of a lot better with a sweet meets savory shell that crackled on mastication giving way to supple flesh beneath.  Slightly peppery on their own and served with lemon tinged vinegar pepper sauce for dipping I definitely understood why these were present at every table and with turmeric and garlic notes aplenty my only regret was that we didn't order a full plate.\\n\\nSeeing the time approaching 6:00 and not wanting to risk missing the anthem I asked our server if we could order our dessert to arrive with our final item and assuring us this was \\"no problem\\" it would be a mere five minutes later that we would receive the \\"Banh Xeo\\" and less than a minute later when the Taro Tapioca would arrive.  Beginning first with the Vietnamese Crepe - an enormous golden fold of crispy bean sprouts, shrimp, pork, and eggs fried to perfection and served with raw vegetables the dish was surprisingly not overly oily and absolutely chalk-a-block full of savory notes carefully balanced by the vegetal bitters of the beans; another must order and something I've managed to recreate with minimal oil since returning home as a healthy protein packed breakfast.  \\n\\nMoving finally to dessert, the aforementioned Taro Tapioca - all I can say is that if you like taro and you like tapioca this warm preparation is a must order as the fibrous texture of the tuber blended nicely with the tapioca while the light saccharine notes of the maltodextrin and a dollop of condensed milk provided just enough sweetness to highlight the taro's flavor."},{"name":"Bumblekiss","address":"3517 NE 46th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I'm going to have to come back to this place.

I just don't know that I'd go back regularly (hence the 3-star review).\\n\\nWent for drinks and light food with a few friends about a month ago. Their drink menu is fun and interesting, with lots of nice handcrafted options, out of the ordinary selection, for sure. I got a barrel-aged cocktail that I couldn't pronounce and I didn't recognize most of the ingredients. But I figured hey, why not? It was hard to describe - a little sour/tangy, a little sweet, chilly, but warmed me up, too. Definitely a fun try. The others I was with got different drinks, all equally as interesting and yummy as mine.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I ordered the razor clams (never had them before) and the mussels. Razor clams are ... interesting. If you've never had them, they're like long, tough clams. Similar consistency as maybe a piece of fried calamari? Hard to describe. Order was grilled with some slivers of pepper and onion. Four clams, definitely a very small portion, though I don't know if I'd have wanted more (wasn't crazy about it). The mussels were delicious - the broth was really interesting. Tomato, orange, and some spice to it. Would order that again if I ever end up back there. \\n\\nThe couple we were with ordered the Soy Roasted Lamb. I didn't try it so I can't speak to the flavors, but it was REALLY tiny. Much smaller portion than our mussels. In my opinion, probably not worth the price tag (especially since we were looking to just order some apps and share).\\n\\nOrdered a shot of espresso which was delicious as well, and much needed at the time.\\n\\nAgain, I'm not sure I would return, and certainly not on a regular basis. The atmosphere was romantic and trendy, but very dim. Difficult to read the menu and see the plates in front of you. There also wasn't natural light from outside since we went at night. Their entrees sounded yummy, but I haven't tried any of those. Most of the prices were pretty high, especially considering that a lot of the dishes (from what I saw) were not exactly large portions. Might try it again one day, but not really in a rush to go back. There are definitely other places in the Somerville/Cambridge area with delicious foods for less money.\\n\\nHighlights: be creative with picking a cocktail, try the espresso, and definitely order the mussels!"},{"name":"Crowne Plaza Portland-Downtown Conv Ctr","address":"1441 NE 2nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I have to first of all commend the front desk for doing whatever possible to pass on the news to guests checking in that the electronic system is down and that we'd have to come back again when the system rebooted.

I hope the restaurant does not think that by suppressing the very real experiences people have in this establishment that they can fool the public.\\n\\nHere it is below, originally posted on 12/2/2012, after my visit there on 12/1/2012 (three people marked it useful, but unfortunately those were lost):\\n\\nMy experience here was a completely unmitigated disaster and ruined my girlfriend's birthday dinner.  We spent almost 2 hours in the place without receiving any food and finally left when our party realized the kitchen wasn't interested in serving us.\\n\\nWe got off on the wrong foot upon arriving- the \\"waiting\\" room (which is the size of a closet behind a curtain) couldn't hold the 6 of us, so we entered the main dining room, where there was no one to greet us for our 8:30 reservation.  After a few moments of confusion, and the group ahead of us being seated, we were told our table was ready.  It just so happened that some acquaintances of ours were leaving the restaurant at that very moment, and while we briefly stopped to say hello, the same person rudely approached us and told us to sit down so we would not be in the middle of the restaurant.\\n\\nOnce seated, we asked our server if they would be willing to serve us a cake we brought for the birthday.   They refused, without a hint of regret. \\n\\nThe two pairs who wanted the duck couldn't order it because you had to reserve it a day in advance-it might have been nice to have been informed when we made the reservation.  But no big deal, a few of us ordered the duck charcuterie, so we'd have our fill.  Well, a full 30 minutes after ordering, the server informed us that there weren't enough charcuteries for all of us, and we would need to choose something else. \\n\\nAt that point we started to get irritated, and explained our frustration with the experience to the server.  A manager came out and started to lecture me on their business model and how it was okay for us to be informed 30 minutes after ordering that they didn't have what we wanted.  After a brief back and forth, we changed the appetizer order.\\n\\nThen another 30 minutes went by, and it seemed everyone else in the restaurant had been served something hot.  We had gotten our rolls, but we had been there for 90 minutes already.  Finally, after another round of food was delivered to our neighboring table, we decided we had enough.  Although extremely hungry and now near 2 hours into the experience, we were ready to go.  So girlfriend's dad decides to first inquire as to when our appetizers are coming.  He goes into the back room and raises his complaints, the night manager says that the food is about to come out, but he overhears a server saying that they were told to not plate it.\\n\\nNeedless to say, we left.  We offered to pay for the 2 bottles of wine we had, but the manager at least had the decency to not charge us.  What a disaster.\\n\\nI've eaten at all kinds of restaurants, from the truck-stop diner to 3 star michelin restaurants, but have never been treated so poorly before.  A true disappointment.\\n\\nLegal Sea Foods handled us nicely and even kept their kitchen open late so they could serve us (we got there at 10:40pm)."},{"name":"Brighton Beer Garden","address":"386 Market St","city":"Brighton","stars":"2.5","text":"first of all you are a liar - there is not a plant to be found, nothing outdoors and blah plus beer selection\\ni am so not impressed by tvs\\noh! free chips and salsa with our beers?

We had a great time.\\n\\nThe waitress made a mistake and charged my credit card for someone else's bill. I knew a mistake had been made when she brought someone else's Visa credit card back to our table to sign the receipt. I was paying with a Master Card.\\n\\nI brought it to the Managers attention, it was an honest mix up, it happens, no biggie. They apologized for the mistake before we left that night and we left a nice tip. They said they had fixed it. \\"Nothing to be concerned about\\".\\n\\nThe next business day I see a pending charge on my credit card for twice what our bill should have been. Looks like it wasn't fixed the night before and I now have reason to be concerned. I called Fogo the same day, talk to Management. They acknowledged the mistake, happened to be the same Manager I flagged down the night before so he was familiar with the situation. They take down all of my information, said they will call their credit card company immediately and get it corrected. \\n\\nA week goes by. I still don't see a credit applied to my credit card.

My frustration comes from not fixing the mistake in a timely fashion after the error was discovered. Simple.\\n\\nSorry for the lengthy post.
