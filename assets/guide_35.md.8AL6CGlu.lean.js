I love going to places where I know I'll be able to order anything off the menu.  We did walk back and forth down the street several times trying to find it--following the little pin on my iPhone with no success.  But, I wouldn't say that it's hard to find, just that they don't have a lot of obvious signage, other than a giant leaf hanging over the door :-). Luckily, after about three passes down the street, a helpful Boulderite pointed out that we were basically five feet from the door :-)\\n\\nNow, as for the food.  I was starving after a relatively long flight and car ride from Denver, so I immediately ordered the Tempura Delicata Squash--delicious!  I and my non-veggie friends gobbled that right up.  The tempura was light and fluffy and not too filling, the squash itself was cooked perfectly, and the sauce on top was a perfect compliment.  \\n\\nBecause it's squash season, my main dish was the Autumn Salad with tempeh.  Also delicious. Fresh, with creamy chevre.  My friend ordered the Apple Wood Smoked Tofu, which also looked great.  The tofu was one large piece, and my friend, being a non-vegetarian, picked it up with his hands and took a big bite, thinking it was bread.  This cracked me up, and I think it speaks to how nice and golden brown the tofu was.  We also ordered the Colorado Cheese Plate, which came with a great selection of cheese and accompaniments.  The service was attentive but not overbearing and the atmosphere was soothing (I'm a sucker for water features!).

And maybe, down the line it'll get a five star rating, but i'm apprehensive to bestow such a score on any place i've only once visited.\\n\\nNeedless to say, what a REFRESHING change from the usual South End ballyhoo. Anchovies serves good Italian food, but you wouldn't be able to guess italian by the decor. Inside and out, Anchovies looks like a funky, semi-dive bar. The space is comprised mainly of a long bar along the right side of the long room, with a handful of booths and tables in the back. The walls have kitsch--photos, taxidermied animals etc. \\n\\nPrices are reasonable anywhere, cheap in the south end. Menu isn't huge, and really broken up into three categories: Pizza, Pasta, and Sandwhiches (although there are a few deviations from that, such as eggplant and chicken parm, and baked cheese polenta). But the food is great, and I don't want to make the menu sound uninteresting. This is not pizzaria italian food. It's a handful of solid notches above that.\\n\\nEntrees range from $11-$14. I got the \\"Ricciardi\\" pasta, penne with chicken sage sausage and mushrooms in a tomato cream sauce. It was tangy, cheesy, delicious. I also have to forward the recommendation of the pesto salad dressing. Wonderful.\\n\\nAnyway, I'll definitely be back here.

I'm sure I disappointed him greatly by sticking with tap water, while my husband had a beer.\\n\\nBecause it took the staff a while to take our order, we asked if bread was available, as it usually is in Italian restaurants. We did receive some toasted slices of bread, only to see that we had been charged for it once we saw the bill.  I believe good restaurant aiming for loyal return customers will inform them if there is an extra charge for something.\\n\\nThe food itself was fairly lackluster; the pizza everyone raved about was fine, but not outstanding. The dough lacked any real character in it's flavor and consistency. As dishes were being cleared away, we could clearly hear our waiter whisper to the bus boy, \\"try to get him to order another beer or ask if they'd like dessert.\\" \\n\\nI was quite disappointed with our experience; not only with the food, but mainly with the staff and their constant push to upsell us.

Oil and Vinegar. How hard can it be?\\")  Well, let me tell you. It may just be oil and vinegar with a little dash of spice here and there but it is FRICKIN' good!!

The Shrimp and Etouffee bisque is really good, with just the right amount of spice.  I really like that you can sample any soup before ordering, and the staff is always nice.  The only reason I am not giving more stars is because their order process makes absolutely no sense.  You walk in, wait in a long L-shaped line and pass the soup counter where you can sample, but not order soup.  The soups are already made and out for display, and there's a server behind the counter giving out samples.  You stand there waiting for the people in front of you to get their sample and move on.  At the end of this line (in a corner) is where you place your order and give your name.  Then you must step back from this area so that the people waiting behind you can place their orders.  Here's where the \\"no sense\\" part comes in.  The only place to step back to is in front of a self-service soda fountain station where people are waiting and stumbling over each other.  The only other option is to awkwardly stand in front of tables where people are eating.  You need to be close enough to the counter so you can hear them call your name for you to go back to the counter and pick up your order (that's where the stumbling over each other comes in).  It gets quite crowded here during lunch-time so the \\"waiting area\\" is like standing on an Orange line train at 5pm.  Cramped, to say the least.  I really wish that Zoup's management would consider redirecting the order flow so that their customers don't end up frustrated before they have their delicious soup.  Yes, Zoup, your customers are frustrated!  I see it and hear it every single time I'm in there.  If you're going to make the process of pouring soup into a cup take so long, give people a place to stand while they wait.   Perhaps have the order process actually take place right where the soup and menus are.  I'm sure you'd be amazed at how many MORE customers you would be able to handle in the same amount of time.

At 2:30pm on a Sunday, the wait was about an hour for 5 of us. They open up the bar next door just so we have booths and seats indoor. A guy comes around every once in a while for drink orders, and there is a canister of Stumptown Coffee (not the freshest brew, it seemed).\\n\\nPresentation of everything was adorable and really nice. Even though half our group had eaten a small lunch earlier, we all heartily agreed Broder was well worth the hour-long wait.\\n\\nCOST: about $120 total, brunch for 5 people.\\n\\nMUST-HAVES: Potato pancake!! And definitely an order of Aebleskiver (Danish pancakes) for the table.\\n\\n* Pork Belly Baked egg scramble - 4 stars\\n(baked egg skillets are served w/ walnut toast & side: I chose potato pancake. Several combos, I got: slow roasted Carleton Farms pork belly, brie & fresh fuji apples. $11)\\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/broder-portland?select=tyc1YT5Qra_AIIGKQLCVCQ#HtWSWaKlqWgJewJhEe7oJA\\nPotato pancake = da bomb!! This was amazing - a thick crispy layer on both sides, sandwiched around a heavenly soft hash. The walnut toast in all the dishes was great - dense, grainy, perfect give with each bite. The pork belly, the selling factor of this scramble, was really old, dry, & disappointing. It was cooked into a layer of scrambled egg on top, and the eggs were soft and done really well. The potatoes/apples underneath weren't amazing.\\n\\n* Pytt/Panna (Swedish Hash, Smoke Trout - 4 stars\\n(small cubed potatoes cooked w/ bell peppers & onions. Topped w/ 2 baked eggs & pickled beets, served w/ walnut toast. Cooked w/ smoked trout. $12)\\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/broder-portland?select=tyc1YT5Qra_AIIGKQLCVCQ#BwzqWwXZsjqTjySI8Zh7_g\\nIn my bf's words: \\"Reeeeally good.\\" He was at a loss for words but really liked this. I found the trout to be a rather hidden ingredient, and while the presentation was nice wasn't wowed by the way everything came together, though it was good. Everyone else at the table absolutely loved it! Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for this specific dish.\\n\\n* Forlorade Agg (Lost Eggs) - 4.5 stars\\n(2 eggs on a bed of sliced ham & spinach under a parmesan-panko crust, served in a skillet w/ sourdough rye toast. $11)\\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/broder-portland?select=tyc1YT5Qra_AIIGKQLCVCQ#nTmk0FSEfjhq-i8SgxzCWw\\nReally great! This was more what I was in the mood for. A really great mix of ingredients, and the egg was blended really well into the dish. \\n\\n* Aebleskiver (Danish pancakes) - 5 stars\\n(5 spherical pancakes. We chose our 2 side sauces: housemade lemon curd, lingonberry jam. $9)\\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/broder-portland?select=tyc1YT5Qra_AIIGKQLCVCQ#Dpi9zNKEteug_JLWMKiVmA\\ncross-section: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/broder-portland?select=g_YCCQoaeHbzHQaNxaMfRA#g_YCCQoaeHbzHQaNxaMfRA\\nDelicious! A great one to get for the table. One of our group saw their special skillet for making a perfectly cooked spherical pancake - you never think how hard it would be to do this until you think about how hard it is to even get a flat pancake to cook just right. They apparently cook sections and rotate this tool to cook a small section at a time and get it just right. Anyway.. they were frickin good. Perfectly soft, fluffy yet moist and dense enough, and the sauces were amazing. I've had IKEA lingonberry (ok maybe not the best comparison) and never new it could taste this great!\\n\\n* Swedish meatballs - 4.5 stars\\n(sauteed, then topped w/ a sherry cream, served w/ walnut toast & lingonberry jam. $11)\\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/broder-portland?select=tyc1YT5Qra_AIIGKQLCVCQ#Qa7TXWFZrHwJs2R0cUXrdQ\\nTried a bite but this was amazing!

Every time I go in, I am greeted with a friendly \\"hello\\" from Roi, the owner (maybe manager too, I'm not 100% sure where his job starts and ends). He for sure recognizes me each time. \\n\\nThe aesthetic is fairly modern and simple. The paint job is vibrant, yet not distracting. There is one long table in the middle of the restaurant that multiple parties can share while still being separate. Along the edges are smaller tables meant for parties of about four or less. Overall, a very comfortable feel. Also, the place is always very clean, no complaints there. It is counter service, which I feel is very appropriate seeing as how they serve what some classify as \\"street food.\\"\\n\\nI haven't even started on the food yet...delicious! I generally order a shawarma laffa. It's a ton of meat, salads and toppings of your choice, and all wrapped in flat bread. I've seen some shawarmas that are too oily and greasy, but Pita Grille does it right. The portion sizes are fairly big, so you won't go home hungry. I've also had their fries (both spicy and regular) a few times. They won't blow your mind, but they're good and the perfect side. Needless to say, I'm a big fan of the food.\\n\\nI have heard some people say the prices are a little steep, but I disagree. Restaurants have to jack prices up in order to make a profit and kosher meat is fairly expensive as it is. Considering this, it's easy to understand why the pries are what they are. All things considered, I would say price is fair.  \\n\\nIf you keep kosher and want an affordable meat meal out, this is your place. The quality of the food matched with the professionalism of the business is impressive. I would recommend Pita Grille to kosher and non kosher diners alike."},{"name":"Cadillac Cafe","address":"1801 NE Broadway St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"A tasty breakfast and pleasant service, though it did take a little longer than expected for my waiter to come by and offer coffee at 9:30 on a fairly peaceful Monday morning. The place is well maintained - late '80s revival of early '30s deco, complete with pink walls a \\"Miami Vice\\" Don Johnson would fit right in with plus a secondary room with fireplace - but it does seem a little pricey for what you get. In my case, it was a 3-egg omelette with spinach, bacon, and cheese plus Cadillac potatoes (fancy name for home fries with paprika) and an English muffin; add in coffee and it somehow came to over $15.00 before tip.

In all reality, being a Slaughter area resident, I get excited when a contruction site sandwich van pulls by since we don't exactly have a lot of great food options down here.\\n\\nI have been here about 10 times now, and have had mixed experiences.  The bar staff is friendly, and I have overall gotten better service indoors.  Whenever we site outside, it just seems like the little things like getting a waiter within 15 minutes of sitting down, slip through the cracks.  I have never gotten rude service here, but eating Nuevo Leon's food without a drink refill is a painful experience.\\n\\nAs for the food, it's hit and miss.  So so fajitas and enchilladas, as well as a pretty awful Chile Releno have all been mistakes on my part.  On the postive side, a darn tasty burrito (stuffed with carne guisada) is better than just about any other place that I've been to.  The queso is good and cheap, and the salsa is made for spice lovers such as myself.  I've also been happy with the old fashioned taco's, although I also feel like I drank a cup of deep fryer grease after finishing my meal.\\n\\nAs for the drinks, they are expensive, but worth it.  People talk about Trudy's mexican martini's, but the basic frozen margarita at Nuevo Leon is stronger and better.  It can be a little dangerous as it's very strong, yet the flavor is so balanced with a nice lime taste.  \\n\\nTo sum it up, I would never step foot in this place if their margarita machine was broken.  There are better places to get this type of food (even in southest of south Austin) but it's a nice place, with some good menu items, with some great drinks."},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Hipster vibe, no meat here,  friendly staff, great service.

Launderette is by far one of the best places I've eaten at in Austin. The location is cool--a little off the beaten path, but it's a really cool modern building in a fairly wooded area of East Holly. I was definitely expecting a wait, but was pleasantly surprised when they were able to accommodate 7 of us very easily. \\n\\nWe started out with cocktails and pimento cheese with the homemade potato chips. The pimento cheese had a nice smoky flavor and the homemade chips were the bomb.com. Next up was an order of fried oysters. The batter was perfectly seasoned and the cilantro lime sauce that came along with it kind of made me want to kiss it. I want to put that sauce on everything.\\n\\nNext up, we ordered the soft egg toast. I'm not a fan of soft-boiled eggs, but this changed my life. I want it every day for breakfast.\\n\\nNext came the brussell sprouts, easily my favorite thing we ordered. They were crispy and tossed in a bacon apple butter with chunks of apple and parmesan cheese. Holy cow. \\n\\nAfter that came an order of the prawns. Sadly I didn't like this dish--I felt as though gulf shrimp (that are around the same size of these prawns) would taste more fresh. These prawns were also a little soft for my liking. The sauce on them was tasty though!\\n\\nNext were mussells. Dang. Served in a delicious broth, these were fresh-tasting and were the perfect size. The orange sauce on top was a perfect pairing.\\n\\nThen came our order of brick chicken, cauliflower gratin, and frites. Each were incredible, but the cauliflower really took the cake. You can't screw up something in melted gouda, topped with breadcrumbs. So so so so good.\\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered the apple pie (!!!!), hazelnut cake, lemon curd with basil ice cream (!!!), birthday cake ice cream sandwich, and sticky toffee pudding. I loved all of them so hard, but the apple pie topped with ginger caramel was easily the most delicious apple pie of my life.\\n\\nOverall, I give it an A+. My biggest recommendation for them is to offer gulf shrimp instead of oysters and try to keep the flies out of the indoors. Being in such a wooded area in the spring attracts bugs, so dealing with the flies was a little pesky. Decor was phenomenal, food was even better, and the waitstaff was incredibly knowledgeable.

My boyfriend and I came in at 11:16am and sat at the bar to order. Below are the following reasons this location is receiving 1 star if I could give a negative 5, I would. Yes, I timed this because I love to dine and great customer service is Key.\\n\\n1) Bartender Janna B, acknowledged us and gave us water and OJ at 11:19am. We knew exactly what we wanted but she jetted off before we can get her to take our order and disappeared for 10mins. 10 minutes is a long time when you are hungry. \\n\\n2) We ordered at 11:30am. I had to get her attention to order. She seemed to be a little irritated with me, I was very polite. During our order I also asked for Honey for the tea we ordered. (Sidebar: it was not very busy at the bar, 3 parties including us). She informed us that there was no more honey (it's 11:30am on Sunday and you guys are out of honey). I then asked for a Cappuccino to replace the tea. She obliged. \\n\\n\\n3) Between the times of 11:40-11:54am 2 individuals received food who placed their order after ours. One was a walk up TO GO order and the other was a couple who arrived and ordered 10 minutes after us. They even order similar items, like the pancakes and chicken sausage so I was very bothered that they received food before us. We patiently waited and tried our best to be understanding. Did Janna B forget to put our order in? Janna gets a F in attentiveness because she was not in tune with the customer. She could have easily did a check back and informed us of the delay; if there was one, instead she chose to ignore us. \\n\\n4) After being ignored. At 12:03pm I finally told Janna that I would like to cancel the order because it is taking too long and I would just like to pay for my drinks. Do you think she tried to recover me as a customer? No. Do you think she asked me, what's wrong? No. She seemed to have an attitude that I had the audacity to cancel, but why wouldn't I? I've been here 40 minutes and all I've had is Cappuccino. I know it doesn't take 35 mins to make French toast. \\n\\n5) She briefly mentioned the manager Shameka, I waited for Shameka to come by. Nothing. I left and I called Shemeka to rectify the experience, I was told that she  as busy with another customer. (Guys, I've seen busy, you were not, you just don't care). A manager that doesn't care about customer service? Wow! I left my name and number, hopefully she calls back. Maybe she will if she reads this. \\n\\nMoral of the story, customer service is key. My boyfriend and I are avid foodies; we travel all around and try different restaurants. We also review them. We refer our friends etc. I cater! I'm very understanding to fault, but I'm not understanding to people with no integrity for what they do. Food is an experience.

And honestly, this place must do phenomenally business-wise. The parking lot, which is pretty big, considering it's only for two restaurants was overflowing with cars. Literally people were parked along the side grass of the building and searching for more spots to park in. \\nAnyway, the service here was very good and the motif inside was also pleasant.

Here it was just right.\\n\\nAt the end of the dinner, since this was my first time at the restaurant, I was given a coupon for 25% off future visits (for a limited time).

The Tokyo curry's flavor was good but it was pretty much mush. Different from Korean curry that I am used to so maybe it is supposed to be like that? The rice wasn't hot and they put a salad on the side with no dressing or toppings. Maybe you mix it all together? The greens seemed like the ones you get in a pre-washed bag at the grocery store. I don't think they looked through it because my mom found some mildew pieces. The Ramen had a great soup and the meat was super tender!

Come have a seat in the bar where you can taste a series of authentically inspired drinks! From the Tradicionales (Traditional) part of the menu, make sure you ask for the Pisco Sour, one of Andina's most popular drinks, as well as a staple drink in Peru made with a tasty mixture of Don Cesar picso mixed with lime juice, sugar and egg whites served up, topped with Angostura bitters and a squeeze of key lime juice. Of course, you can never go wrong ordering an ice cold Pina Colada made with refreshing pineapple amber rum blended with fresh crushed pineapple, coconut milk and sugar, served frozen with a Gosling's Black Seal rum and coconut shavings.\\n\\nLooking to add a little spice to your day? Come experience Happy Hour from 4:00 - 6:00 7 days a week, and if you can, be sure to get there a few minutes early! This cozy bar fills up quick with locals from the surrounding businesses in the Pearl District and others looking to mingle and have a good time. Another advantage to coming in when it's early, is perhaps even having the opportunity to chat with Head Bartender, Greg Hoitsma while he's pouring drinks. Greg had the opportunity to travel through and stay in Peru for 2 years and knows plenty of the history behind the drinks. And if you order off the Novoandinos (Modern Peruvian) part of the menu, Greg himself is the mastermind behind all these drinks! If you're looking for a little added boost of energy to get you through the rest of your afternoon, you'll find the perfect drink here; the Horcahta De Caf√© an almond-hazelnut horchata layered with shots of golden cinnamon rumand rich caf√© de olla, served tall, and dusted with powdered cinnamon an absolutely delightful drink, or one of my personal favorites the Margarita Pintada, a colorful twist on your average Margarita with 1800 silver tequila shaken with lime juice and agave nectar, served on the rocks and painted with bright splotches of tangy mango nectar and ginger-infused agua de tuna (Cactus Juice), not just a treat for your mouth but for your eyes! \\n\\nOne thing before you leave there, I recommend as an absolute must have if you're having a bit of a sweet tooth, or just because is a spiked Peruvian version of a chocolate milkshake.

Beyond that, based on the way my boyfriend and I were treated, I would NEVER go back. It seems that Indians or any people from India, Bangladesh, etc seem to not like it when \\"their\\" people date outside their race. It was obvious to me (I'm Indian and my boyfriend is white) that this was a problem for the staff and owner at Panahar.\\n\\nUpon entering, we were told to \\"have a seat\\" and wait although there were plenty of tables available. We promptly ordered, yet it was 20 minutes before we got our appetizer and over an hour before we got our dinner. The couple that came in after us (both white) got their dinner before us.\\n\\nNot once did we get an apology for the long delay. We watched as the owner made his way around to every table to ask how their meal was, could he get them anything else, or  could he make a recommendation. The only thing he said to us was \\"excuse me\\" when he cleared our plates. \\n\\nI could easily have dismissed this as they were having an off night but when we observed how every other group around us were treated and the fact that those that came in before and after us were treated to friendly and prompt service, I cannot come to any other conclusion than we were DISCRIMINATED against. To top it all off, when we were leaving and passed the hostess she didn't even acknowledge us (although we walked right past her) not even a nod! All other diners, upon leaving, at least got the obligatory \\"thank you\\"\\n\\nWe've been to many Indian restaurants around the Atlanta area and have experienced discrimination, however, the reviews for Panahar were so great and touted the friendly service, I  wanted to believe that they would be different. So much so, I was willing to drive all the way from Kennesaw to try them out. Alas, they are just like all the rest :-(\\n\\nMy advice to these Indian proprietors: Get over yourself or continue to lose customers!"},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Food was very good, service was average and a bit chaotic, but friendly atmosphere and staff"},{"name":"Steak on Fire","address":"7541 Sand Lake Rd, Ste A","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Greatest fast food/counter service food you'll eat.

This app came out at the same time as our entrees. Server forgot my son's side dish. Came out mid meal.  Pacing of meal was a debacle.  Entrees came while finishing salads.

The most famous donuts are the maple/bacon,  the cock and balls, the Memphis Mafia and the huge Tex-Ass.

I don't like doughnuts much as they're usually much too sweet for me. I've tried doughnuts across the country and have never found one I liked except maybe those made at home with very little sugar and no dusting. But I wanted the experience of going Voodoo - if only for my teen who thought it would be 'crazy cool'. \\n\\nWe drove by at 8 PM on a weekday, there was a CRAZY line outside so we decided to go wait and come back at 11:30. Major oops! The line was even longer! What! Still we parked for $12 for the night and went to Voodoo. There was a 200 person line in front of us with some street performance going on right in the middle. Most people were late teens or twenties and many were drunk. Didn't think I wanted to be in line with my kid, we had even brought our dog, so we sent the poor soul back to the car. My kid got a few cat calls as she was walking back and was upset but still determined to go in and try the doughnuts. \\n\\nWe then had a few teenagers slam into us as they were being chased by cops for breaking into someone's car or store and then a few cops came running after. It was quite a commotion. A homeless dude then got up on a trash can, he seemed really high and started lecturing the general audience in the line. Another crowd of drunk people showed up and lit cigarettes. Most of the people who had kids or others who did not want to wait left at this point. \\n\\nWe waited about 1.5 hours to get in. I had typed my order on my phone and handed it to the server who thanked me for that since I was buying a bunch of flavors. A lot of people were just staring at the board inside, lost as they seemed not to have a clue what they wanted, I think they were in the line just for fun. The place is cash only so some were scrambling to get money. The servers were friendly despite all this going on all the time. It's amazing that they sell so many doughnuts, all their racks were full and they were still making more!\\n\\nSo the visit was an experience, that lasted 3 hours to buy a few doughnuts! But I don't think I would have seen more people and more interesting sights in the space of those 3 hours anywhere else!\\n\\nWe got our legendary pink boxes and I tried a bite of each doughnut having got about 15-16 flavors. I wasn't very impressed, the only one I liked was the Buttermilk bar. I had not tasted one like that before and it was not overly sweet. The voodoo dolls were all different and fun to photograph but not to eat. Eventually, I ended up trashing most of the doughnuts. Out of the 24 we purchased we perhaps finished 4-5 over 2 days. And our dog helped too!\\n\\nRecommended as a place to hang out if you're into that sort of thing.

Yes, it's true, but it's a nice change of pace. It's the opposite of the Portland trend of concrete floors, reclaimed wood, converted warehouse with overhead garage doors. Every once in a while it's nice to put on a blazer and eat out in a place with fresh flowers, carpeting, and servers with ties. I don't know why they cut corners on the finishing touches: creamer in those little individual plastic tubs that you pull the foil off at the top, same thing for the jam, paper napkins...come on, it would take so little to class it up the rest of the way. Plenty of seating options: counter, bar, booths, tables, even a faux patio with fireplace. Oh, I should mention it's a come-as-you-are place.

Not exactly casual though. Some servers are \\nconfident and professional, others are timid and out of their element. Variation in personality types is fine, but anybody in this line of work needs to project grace and \\npolish...some of them don't. Easygoing about substitutions, in my experience (ymmv). If something isn't right, they'll apologize and take action. I even had one of the owners notice, as he walked past my table, that something on my plate wasn't right, and he took care of it. I wasn't even going to say anything, but he took the initiative (to be fair though, it never should have left the kitchen like that).  \\nFOOD: \\nNot terribly imaginative, but good solid comfort fare. Consistent, except when there's a new guy in the kitchen (rare). Sometimes ingredients are frozen or over-processed, so a great idea on the menu might be a slight miss in its execution. Baked goods are especially disappointing (muffins and breakfast bread taste like they came from a boxed mix they bought from the Safeway down the street, and even the toast is mediocre).  \\nPRICE/VALUE:\\nNo surprises here, about average prices and portions.\\nTIP: \\nWant to beat the rush?

We proceeded into the restaurant and were promptly seated. My boyfriend ordered the calamari as an appetizer. It was chewy and over cooked. BUT the only really good thing about dinner was the focaccia with ricotta and olive oil because it was bomb. \\n\\nSo I ordered the duck breast and my boyfriend ordered the pork shank. I received my duck breast and it was really tough. I asked the server what temperature it was meant to be served at (because typically duck is served med-rare and mine was well done) and he told me the reason the duck was pink was because it was smoked and tried to assure me that it was cooked. That was the opposite of the answer I was looking for. So- I normally do not send food back, but i figured for a $30 plate, the duck should at least be edible. I sent it back and asked for a new plate to come out med-rare.\\n\\nMy boyfriend received his pork shank and I noticed he wasn't really eating it, he said that it didn't have much taste, and I agreed. While we were waiting on the duck to be re-made, we asked to take it togo and have the pork boxed up. While waiting, our server decided to play with a flashlight before coming back with the togo box for the pork. \\n\\nAs servers ourselves, we are both aware of how important it is to read your tables and guests energy.

That said we get there and valet says they won't valet any cars wo a RSVP. Yeah it's drizzling and there's no street parking. Is it appropriate to ask your customers to walk from God knows where in heels in the rain? And the mgr wasnt sounding genuinely apologetic and confirmed they had this unheard of policy when I called to complain. Once I told the manager about how unconcerned she sounded she offered to give us a gift card. She said we could come in or have it mailed. Of course coming in without a reservation is apparently a problem so I suggested mailing it. I haven't received a call about sending the gift card out like she said and it's been two business days since. The food is decent but not worth this kind of hassle. I said I wouldn't come back after I had to wait like 30 minutes for valet to park my car the time prior. I should've stuck with my instincts. Why have a special event when you can't accommodate parking for your customers? Get organized so your hostesses at least can tell people oh yes, you should make a reservation or you won't be able to park her. No point in going back to this place.

A aged sea foam paint covers the walls and the troughs that you cavalierly toss your empty Apalachicola oyster shells into. Fishing nets are draped delicately as the decor. \\n\\nIs that Squidward shucking those sweet briny delicacies? Nope, just the salt of the earth Winter Garden-ian folks that have lived, fished and hunted in the area for a few generations.  \\n\\nSo in short, this is the place that locals have known for the last 60 years and have shared with lovers and newcomers to world of Gulf coast oysters in discreet if not heated whispers.\\n\\nYou have to remember that this is a DIVE spot. So don't expect the service to be super attentive but expect them to greet you with a warm smile and fast hands when they finally get to you. Also for those who HAVEN'T been coming here for the last ten years, those bathrooms are an UPGRADE! Honestly, they might not be pretty but they are reasonablely clean and get the job done. The jukebox is well beyond entertaining with everything from Modest Mouse, The Shins, Lady GaGa to Kenny Chesney and everything in between. Its surprising what the diverse patrons pick. \\n\\nSo here is the secret of how to order in this place, once taught to me by a wise man of the sea. \\n\\n1.  Sit at the Bar. Order a bucket. If you like them raw, ask them to put them on ice and let them sit for a good 10-15 minutes. If you like them steamed, ask for them to be lightly steamed so they aren't rubbery.\\n\\n2. Order a cold delicious beer and either the crawfish (previously frozen) or shrimp while you wait. \\n\\n3. If you have them steamed, try the hot sauce with the clarified butter. Just mix the hot sauce into the butter, about half and half and put them on a cracker. Its kinda amazing. Its not too hot (I'm a mild person) and if you like hot wings you'll like this.\\n\\n4. If you have them raw, enjoy the crisp cold briny flavor of the chilly oysters any way you feel fit. They have horseradish, cocktail sauce, butter, hot sauce and saltines. Sometimes you'll be lucky enough to find a pearl.\\n\\n5. Drink another beer. Talk to your shucker. Everyone seems to have a good story to tell.\\n\\n6. IF you start feeling adventurous, ask them about a Rooster. Be warned, you might wake the neighbors.\\n\\nI'm not a dessert person so that ends my instructional.\\n\\nAnd believe it or not, they are not Crabby Patty prices with $14.95 for a bucket which is about 3 dozen. So take that Mr. Crabs!  \\n\\nPS If you ever want to have oysters at your party or at home, you can buy a sack of them in the shell. Just be sure you know how to shuck them first!"},{"name":"Leaf Vegetarian Restaurant","address":"1710 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"This is defiantly a place you want to try if you are in the Boulder area.

The sushi belt seats were half empty, including 4 booths, and the table dining area was completely empty. I had my 2-year-old with me.

When I pointed out that it would be a safety hazard for my 2 year-old to sit there, because the stools could easily tip over, he went to ask the manager, who then came over and told me that it is \\"restaurant policy\\" that only parties of 3 or more sit at the booths, which are conveniently the only place for a high chair to go, too.\\n\\nI again pointed out the safety hazard issue, stated that I come often (usually with my husband and child), and he just shrugged his shoulders and said nothing. I asked, \\"So, you're refusing to seat us??\\" and he just shrugged and stood there and said it was restaurant policy and it was their busy time. I was flabbergasted and pointed out that the restaurant was more than half empty, and he didn't care. \\n\\nI don't know what happened to this restaurant.... I went for years and was never treated this way. Maybe owners or management changed and I should've stopped going when food poisoning became a regular event after eating there. Now I will.

In fact, it would be best if you made it so people could buy tickets online.  I had to call three times to get tickets.  If the person I was going with hadn't been so set on going I would have given up.  Send an email a week ahead to remind people, suggest they wear costumes and tell them how it all works - especially if you are going to expect people to pay cash.  Since this was to take place in a speakeasy, skip the dinner and just have cocktails.  The dinner was distracting and people missed much of the performance.  It wasn't until the dinner was out of the way that people started getting more involved.  Plus it would lower the cost - it wasn't worth $60 a ticket.  With it more like a theatre there could be more clues in the performance and not so much in all the stuff that got passed around and we could have more acting and less songs - it was one or two too many.

Listen to this cute love story (how could you NOT want to eat here?): \\"Andina restaurant is the product of a long and fruitful marriage between John and Doris Platt Rodriguez, representing two cultures fused into one project. John met Doris in her hometown of Cajamarca, Peru during his 2 years as a Peace Corps volunteer. John had already fallen in love with Peru and meeting Doris gave him the extra incentive to stay an additional 9 years. Two kids later, they returned to John's native Oregon and settled down in Corvallis with their expanded family of three young boys.  In 2002, their second son Peter had the vision of a restaurant where Peruvian culture, old traditions and new horizons could be reflected in a cuisine of great variety and quality. With andina, John and his family are now completing the circle by bringing a taste of Peru to Oregon. Andina opened in Portland's Pearl District on July 15th, 2003 to favorable reviews and continues to carve out its niche with a unique and delectable cuisine.\\" (courtesy andina website)\\n\\nAs all others have noted, the menu is huge (sample a few), and the food and drinks are delicious.

Me and my companion were waited by a Korean guy and he is not professional at all. He didn't welcome us and he just kept our orders without even taking notes. He seemed very distracted and didn't care at all. Seriously I already regret as I was ordering.I wish I could leave just like that.\\n2.

The valet parking was awkward (and took too long), the restaurant was exceptionally crowded and loud, the air was very stuffy and smoky, the tables were rickety and cramped and despite having reservations we still waited for 15 minutes.  \\n\\nThe service, while friendly, was having a very hard time keeping up on this busy Saturday night.  The d√©cor was very neat and created a really cool hip industrial vibe - I particularly liked the gargantuan mural on the wall.  The live entertainment was good (though quite a distance from where we were seated) - they were playing classic hits from artists like Jimi Hendrix and Bill Withers, good stuff.\\n\\nOkay, so the food:  We started off with the highly-acclaimed brisket empanadas.  Oh wow, were they delicious!  The empanada was topped with pico de gallo, feta crumbles, a zesty aioli, and what I believe was watercress.  The empanada pastry shell was buttery and flaky.  The brisket filling was tender and flavorful.  The flavors and textures were harmonious - an excellent appetizer.\\n\\nFor our main courses, my wife ordered the bistro steak with whipped potatoes, green beans, roasted mushrooms, and chimichurri.  While it looked very good, the wife's bistro steak was way overcooked and bland.  The green beans were under-seasoned and poorly cooked.  There were a grand total of two small mushrooms on the plate.  Even the chimichurri was bland.  The wife sent it back (something we very rarely do).  The waiter handled the situation well.  \\n\\nInstead, my wife ordered the smoked brisket with corn and red wine jus.  When the waiter returned, he reported that the Executive Chef had tried the bistro steak that had been sent back and agreed that it had indeed been cooked improperly and was inspecting other dishes that were being brought to the pass.  The brisket was much better - lots of juicy delicious flavor.  \\n\\nI ordered the pork shank with stewed white beans and romesco.  Again, the dish looked very good.  They were definitely going for a rustic touch here.  The braised pork was simply falling off the bone.  While tasty, it wasn't as good as it could have or should have been.  The stewed white beans were rather bland.  The romesco was pretty good.  Overall, the dish felt rather disjointed.\\n\\nSo, I would summarize their food thusly: the food that Two Urban Licks prepares looks very good on the plate, however could be prepared much better with more attention to detail and better execution.  The portion sizes are massive making for an awkward dining experience at small cramped tables.  The prices are about what you would expect them to be.\\n\\nAll in all, I felt like there was a lot of potential here.  The quality of their work clearly diminishes as the place gets crowded."},{"name":"Union Oyster House","address":"41 Union St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"It cannot be a tourist trap when the food is good and the prices are reasonable.

The huevos rancheros are not as good as Angela's Cafe in East Boston, but they're version is good enough for a Beacon Hill local to come back often. The staff is very friendly, especially the busboy and the chefs, and the women behind the registers. Don't even bother trying to eat here on a Saturday or Sunday unless you get there when the doors open, or 10 mins before closing because the lines are out the door all day (30-60 min wait). In the past when we saw these lines on the weekends we used to just head straight over to the Beacon Hill Bistro, which is probably quite a bit healthier but just not as tasty as The Paramount.

I am sorry, Austinites, but most of your pizza is terrible. We read about Home Slice and decided to give it a try. Was it authentic NY pizza? The crust was a little crispier, but the rest was spot on. And there are some places in NY with crispy crust (like John's of Times Square, which is fantastic), so that didn't disqualify it. My teenaged son said, \\"It is probably the best pizza we will find anywhere in Austin.\\" However, they need more locations or a bigger place because there was no place to park, it was beyond crowded, and the wait was long. It is also odd to pay a premium for what is just typical average pizza in NJ. Our local NJ place had better pizza and wasn't even a top pizza spot! So, Austinites, you need to fix your pizza. Home Slice is doing what your average mom and pop pizza joint in NY or NJ does, which means other pizza parlors in TX could get a lot closer to making better pizza.\\n\\nOne thing they did a lot better than NY places was giving you little cups with Parmesan and seasonings for your to-go order.

While in line they have a sample station to help you decide. I've tried the Sicilian pizza, Italian wedding soup, lobster bisque and chili con carne (they are tiny!). The bisque is super creamy, maybe a tad much sherry and tons of meat, pizza soup has pepperoni in it which gives it some zing, and the chili was to dark and just meh for my taste buds.

We found this Thai restaurant with high rating and reviews, so we decided to come here for dinner. \\n\\nWhen we walked into the restaurant, surprisingly there was only one table with two Japanese ladies. We thought there would be a lot of customers. The server (who was probably the owner of the restaurant) greeted us and said that it must be our first time to come here for dinner. Of course we said yes!  We could grab any tables that we wanted. The server was very friendly and gave us a menu. \\n\\nOne of us ate something earlier, so we did not order too much. We ordered Jitlada fried rice with pork and Gaeng Daeng (curry) with chicken.  We did not bother ordering a bowl of rice. We just ate Gaeng Daeng by itself. Both dishes of food tasted wonderful!  The only thing we didn't like was the portion especially the dish of fried rice was very small. It gave me an impression of an high end Asian restaurant. The fried rice cost $14. Gaeng Daeng cost $16 without rice. We could have ordered the same curry dish in other neighbourhoods but it would come with rice. \\n\\nThe interior of the restaurant was very well designed. All the colours and decorations matched very well. The location of the restaurant is in Vancouver west. That's why the food cost more overall. \\n\\nMy conclusion is that if you wouldn't mind to pay a little more for smaller portions of the food, sure come try this restaurant and enjoy good environment, good interior design and good quality of food."},{"name":"The Optimist","address":"914 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Not at all what I expected to be writing in review the day after having dinner at the Optimist.

I was expecting a fantastic meal.\\n\\nFirst of well we had a 7:30 reservation (tuesday night.) Arrived on time and sat at the bar to wait for our table to be ready. At 8:30, my date finally asked one of the hostesses what was going on-- to which she said, \\"oh, I thought since you were sitting at the bar that you didn't want your table any more...\\" Umm... what???\\n\\nWe ordered the octopus appetizer at the waitress' suggestion. It was salty and spicy and basically tasted like a hot wing (in flavor.) Not good. Then I had the grouper-- terrible and basically all salt-- and my date had the skate wing (which was highly recommended) and he didn't like it at all either-- was basically a fried mess with way too much sauce. The only good thing I ate was the a piece of bread before the meal.... once I realized I wasn't going to eat more than 2 bites of my dinner I asked the waitress for another piece of bread, and lo and behold they had run out.\\n\\nThe seating situation was abysmal. the food was virtually inedible, and it took forever. waitress/bar tender were nice but I don't think that alone justifies any more stars!

I agree with what Cole W. has said completely... \\n\\nWhen I first came to Austin five years ago when I was planning a move here, my friend Jessica dumped me off at Bouldin Creek while she had to work or something and said, \\"trust me you'll love it here. it's your kind of place...\\" And indeed it was... good coffee, awesome friendly service, funky clientele, book shelves with strange books and games, free wifi and great food. So for the last five years, I have been a loyal customer, stopping by at least once or twice a month when I need to get out of the house, but want to do work or read. When I first moved here and I knew almost no one, I went to Bouldin because I could feel comfortable just hanging out alone while still feeling some sort of human interaction. Sometimes I even talked to strangers. At the very least, the employees were very kind. \\n\\nBouldin Creek was the kind of place you can frequent alone and not feel weird-- mostly because you grab your food and coffee and hide with your book and no one bothers you. And while there are many places like that in Austin, there were none that had food I liked as much as Bouldin. Many coffee houses offer shrink wrapped food that is brought in from elsewhere or crappy scones. Bouldin has great food and a pretty extensive menu. \\n\\nHowever, in the new location, the atmosphere is weird and I agree that table service does not lend itself to relaxing and enjoying your book and it makes you feel bad about taking up a table intended for many when you're alone. While they've expanded the menu a bit and yes, there is way more space, which they seemed to need sometimes, table service creates a totally different vibe. Also, they still haven't worked out the kinks of it yet and it was frustrating waiting for someone to refill my coffee or bring me cream when I could've easily just gotten up and did it for myself.  \\n\\nOn the plus side, table service means that when I bring my dog, I don't have to lock him in the car when I go inside to order. (He tends to cause a scene when left alone.) And while I realize there will be growing pains and perhaps I will get used to the new set up, I am a little sad about the change.

And my date and I didn't know where anything was, so the ordeal of getting us set up with food and drinks, and getting into our movie in time, was kind of a headache. I ended up standing in line for the movie for about 20 minutes while the fella went in search of gin and tonics. The staff members I saw in passing seemed a bit harried. I was reminded of that moment in elementary school where you suddenly realize that adults have no idea what they're doing, that they're just making it up like the rest of us. The fact that, at the end of the movie line, on my way into the theater, I ended up having a couple slices of mediocre pizza kind of sealed the deal. \\n\\nIt's one of the few problems I have with McMenamin's businesses, actually: they always just seem a bit understaffed.\\n\\nAfter all, that same night, the movie we watched completely sucked, but that was OK because the tickets were only $3, we were curled up on a nice soft couch together, and we had booze in our hands. And the next time my sweetie and I went to the Kennedy School -- during Thanksgiving weekend, and on an afternoon, which may have made all the difference -- we had a very different experience. No crowds, for instance. It may help that we showed up far enough in advance to actually find the restaurant and have a leisurely meal and a couple of drinks. And that would be my advice to filmgoers hitting the Kennedy School for the first time -- even if you've already eaten, give yourself enough time to get your bearings and check the place out.

The service was awkward and while not rude, certainly not welcoming.  I would go back for more of the fabulous fish though! (4 stars for the food, if I cared about service it would get 3 but I'm a foodie first, snob second.)\\n\\nThe full story: My boyfriend and I visited Hamilton's Kitchen for the first time on Friday, 09/20/13.  The entrance to the restaurant walks the patron though the Alfond Inn lobby and courtyard area which are a mix of modern and classic; very welcoming and fresh.  \\n\\nWe arrived a few minutes early for our 8:15pm reservation and were told we had to wait, which is 100% fine, since we were the early (hungry) birdies. We explored the lobby and garden/courtyard, were offered drinks by a sweet hostess but weren't seated until nearly 8:30pm because the place was bumping! Several large parties got seated right before us but thankfully a food runner dropped off water as soon as we were seated (fine dining or no, I drink water like a dying man in a desert!).\\n\\nThe dining room is large, lovely and dimly lit, with an open kitchen that is enjoyable to watch. It is quite loud inside however, so if you are interested in an intimate location ask to be seated on the patio, it's quieter, calm and just as lovely. \\n\\nOur server was frazzled and was noticeably cool once he realized that not only were we not ordering drinks, we also were using the Magical Dining fixed price menu.  I used to be a server, I understand the stereotyping, but still.....he quickly took our orders mumbling something about wanting to get us in the kitchen before the large party, which I really appreciated....but then he said something to the affect of \\"still giving us the full Hamilton's experience\\"....what? Like I'm a second class diner because I'm taking advantage of Magical Dining? Weird. I'm tired of writing about the server, he had odd comments all night and wasn't very attentive...but honestly I don't care about service (I just wanted to share so my fellow frugal foodies can gird their loins before making reservations)\\n\\nSo, let's talk about food: We both ordered the shrimp and grits as our starter.  It is a generous portion with 5 large shrimp in a tomato and onion broth, over classic grits and topped with spinach.  Very comforting and I liked how the spinach gave a touch of brightness, to cut the natural salty nature of shrimp and grits.  \\n\\nFor our entrees I had the pork belly with steamed clams, roasted potatoes and bitter greens.  While the first bite didn't make me fall head over heels in love, I really ended up enjoying this dish (to be honest, I've had life changing pork belly and I'm kinda, sorta always chasing that meal again...sorry Hamilton, I was a biased patron on this one!).  What ended up making me happily devour this dish down to the last drop of salty, piggy broth (yes, I just used piggy as an adjective....Ruth Reichl would be so proud! ha) was the balance of the umami belly with the bright pop of the kale greens.  This southern gal honestly just wants to go back and have a huge bowl of just the kale and broth with a side of bread for dipping.  Yes, the potatoes and clams were a nice addition, but had no lasting effect on my impression of the meal as I write this just two days later. \\n\\nThe cobia cooked in a cast iron skillet (so says the menu, they didn't serve it in a skillet, thank god.  I'm a good southern gal, as I said above, but I prefer my food to come out on a plate, not a kitschy mini skillet) with seasonal veggies over polenta that my bf ordered gave me a touch of order envy.  Thankfully he's good at sharing because every bite I had of the delicious white fish made me want to beg for another. The rather generous fillet was perfectly cooked with a light salt crust and was silky, perfectly moist on the inside.  Melt in your mouth heaven, in fact.  The vegetable selection was interesting with thin, flash sauteed beets and sweet potato (which was pretty much raw...fun but not my favorite accompaniment) and quartered chayote squash, I think.  I didn't personally taste the polenta, but Alex' plate was clean down to the china, so I think it was good! \\n\\nMaybe it was because we were still in awe of the fish, but neither my bourbon caramel sundae or Alex's pecan pie are anything to write home about, so I won't. (if you are dying in suspense, just lots of whipped cream and over sweetness on both plates).\\n\\nOne final food detail:  When we finally received our bread service (after the starters had arrived, fyi) the rolls were glorified Hawaiian King's Rolls and the famed bacon butter was underwhelming.  Aka, don't get too excited...cause I was, but now I'm not.\\n\\nSo, would I go back? Totally.  For the fish. Always for the fish.  And maybe a bowl kale. Thanks for a fun night out Hamilton's...I wish you well as you spread your restaurant wings."},{"name":"Little Italy Pizza","address":"619 Main St","city":"Groveport","stars":"4","text":"I ate here for the first time today and I don't know why I didn't come here sooner!

The noodles were pretty good (not my fav) but my bf was happy. The Tai Roll was very interesting but delicious! Instead of seaweed on the outside of the roll, it was some sort of white fish that was curled to wrap the crab meat inside. It was so tender and melted in my mouth.

Right off the plane we ask what he's in the mood for.  He calmly replies \\"seafood\\".  I have been jonesin' to come to the Optimist.  He abides.  What awaited us was far beyond my expectations.\\n\\nWe'll start with the fact that we were without a reservation on a Thursday night and expected that we might wait.  Luckily for us, seating at the incredibly charming oyster bar was available.  Our waiter promptly came to us and took our drink orders. \\n\\nConsidering we were newbies to the experience, we asked our waiter for his opinion on how to order.  He recommended that we all agree on an appetizer and agree on three meals that we can share amongst each other.  We came to the consensus that we would start with the Charred Spanish Octopus, then we would order the Fish & Chips, the Grouper, and the Duck Fat Poached Swordfish.  This is the best decision ever made.\\n\\nI am a fan of octopus just based on the experiences I have had with sushi.  Knowing what I now know about how it's suppose to taste has ruined octopus for me in these familiar settings.  You can cut the octopus with a fork at the Optimist.  Enough said.\\n\\nEverything we had was my favorite, but if I had a favorite over all favorites, the Duck Fat Poached Swordfish is the winner.  It was so tender that it melted in my mouth.  I've had swordfish before, but not swordfish like this.  It was fresh and enjoyable until the very last bite.  The grouper was meaty and refreshing.  The Fish and Chips are easily the best that you will have in this city.  It sounds silly considering it's a fairly average item on many menus throughout the world, but I would be hard pressed to find a place that did it so right.\\n\\nFinally, we were sold on dessert.  We indulged in the Maple Ice Cream Sandwich and the Banana Cake.  The Banana Cake was easily the victor among the two, but don't discount the ice cream sandwich.  The pumpkin butterscotch cookies that create the sandwich are excellent.\\n\\nIf I had a complaint, it would be that I can't see myself venturing back anytime soon due to the cost.  However, you DEFINITELY get what you pay for and I will never discount that when it comes to good food, good friends, and good vibes."},{"name":"Leaf Vegetarian Restaurant","address":"1710 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"My husband and I have been to Leaf 3 times now and every single thing we have ordered there has not only been delicious, but also beautifully presented.

Entrees that use corn tortillas, such as the tacos al carbon, now use only one tortilla instead of two.

But thanks to the Food Channel, the first thing that runs into my head now is the hot pink, psychedelic, Voodoo Donuts instead of grunge or the homeless.\\n\\nHow crazy is it that a city can be defined by a doughnut shop?  Isn't that the whole Insanity of it though, with Voodoo Doughnuts exemplifying almost the perfect metaphor for Portland Oregon?    It's like the brainchild or ultimate fantasy of a late 30-something, can't hold a job, pot palate infused, and gaming addicted basement dweller.  The perfect donut idea generator.\\n\\nAnd considering I fall into that demographic, being a director of sales at one of the most insane companies out there, how lucky was I to have one located just across the street from my hotel. I'm talking like a one and a half minute meander.\\n\\nAs the Southwest famiglia made our way through the droves of homeless looking for free donuts or dollars, you could see the psychedelically pink infused sugar catastrophe that was about to happen.\\n\\nBeing my first time to voodoo donuts, and being the purest that I am, I decided to go with one chocolate, one glaze, and one Homer Simpson!  I ate them in that order and to say that my euphoria heightened with each bite, maybe the understatement of the year.   I would rank them respectively with the homer Simpson being the pinnacle of donuty chewiness, with a light sugary crispness on the outside perfection!\\n\\nSadly I do not believe the treadmill had enough belt to cover the distance I needed to run that off so I added another 30mins of burpees when I got back to the room.  \\n\\nAll worth it and would do it again and again.\\n\\nPortland has truly earned its reputation as home to the best donut shop around.

Whenever I've had guests from out of town visiting, a lot of times, we'd end up here.  It's a great place to show off Southern home cooking and hospitality, especially if your guests are not from the South.\\n\\nThe restaurant has been around since 1945 and when you walk through the doors, it's like walking into an old Southern home.  The building has several different dining rooms with seating to accommodate groups of all sizes.  The walls are decorated with various memorabilia such as autographed pictures, letters, newspaper and magazine articles, plaques, etc. written or signed by famous (and not-so-famous) athletes, celebrities, politicians, and other figures who have visited Atlanta and dined at Mary Mac's.\\n\\nEverything is old fashioned, down to the ordering process.  There are pencils and slips of paper at each table and customers write down what they want and hand it to their server to complete their order.  Mary Mac's offers the typical \\"meat and two\\" option (entree plus two sides).  They also offer a popular all you can eat, family style dining option for $20.95 per person.  Convenient for large groups who want to simplify the ordering process and share.\\n\\nIf this is your first time dining at Mary Mac's, they'll give you a complimentary serving of their pot likker side, which is a small bowl of broth/soup that is leftover from boiling greens.  They serve it with small pieces of pork (inside) and a piece of cornbread.  My favorite items to order here are the chicken livers (both grilled and fried), fried green tomatoes, fried okra, collard greens with \\"cracklin'\\" cornbread, and sweet potato souffle.  Portion sizes are filling and the bread is unlimited, so you will probably leave full.\\n\\nFinally, there is an older lady at Mary Mac's named Jo.  She likes to walk around and give people back rubs.  Sometimes, she'll give rubs to people who aren't expecting it, making for funny and awkward situations.  A while ago (fellow Yelper Angela M. was actually in attendance for this), Jo gave me a back rub, but at the end, put one of her hands on my thigh underneath the table to get a rise out of everyone there.  It was pretty funny, but wow.  Any closer and she would've made contact.\\n\\nMary Mac's is located on Ponce just one block east of Piedmont.  They have a surface lot in the back you can park at for free."},{"name":"Fizz Ed'z","address":"142 Pleasant St","city":"Malden","stars":"3","text":"They made some changes , this was the old honey fitz's , \\nOnly came back for a peek but gotta say they did clean up the place looks so much better used to be a dive bar , \\nThe bar is much roomier then before much better and cleaner can't figure outhow they made it look bigger but it defiantly does have a bigger feel to it like it !\\nAlso much better ppl visiting for the bands they have are great ,, there was a band playing and they were awesome !!

We made reservations under the assumption that it would be OK to just order appetizers and drinks. We had a large group (office gathering) and thought it prudent to make a reservation to accommodate our group. Most of us appear under the age of 30, which SHOULDN'T matter.

We were being watched by four employees as they rolled their eyes, pointed to our table, and made us feel like we did not belong as if we were invading their \\"high status\\" restaurant. As a side note, let it be know we were properly dressed to their attire requirements while others walked in with bikinis covered by sarongs and cut off shorts with tube tops. I guess they picked their battles. How dare we book a reservation and not order the $40 crab cakes?!\\n\\nWe ended up making the \\"walk of shame\\" back to bar area, as it became more and more uncomfortable to sit at our RESERVED table.

It's highly recommended, if that means anything: My friend from the Cambridge area recommended the place to me, and that same day, my other friend visiting the area also told me that her friends recommended the same ramen place as a must-try. \\nFood: I got the kara miso (spicy miso) ramen vegetarian style. The broth was salty (as ramen quite often is) but spicy and flavorful; the noodles were cooked well, springy and chewy, and the perfect thickness for my taste; and I really loved the consistency of the soft-boiled egg, although I wish it was warmer. I do wish they gave more vegetables because the bamboo and mushrooms were great, but most Japanese ramen usually does offer more vegetables. My friend's ramen also came with arugula, which she thought was slightly strange in ramen. However, we both were satisfied and polished off our dishes, and thought the portion size was quite decent for the price. I like that they don't give you too many noodles so that they get soggy before you finish. \\nOn another note though, I'm not actually sure if it was vegetarian or not, so if you're a strict vegetarian then I would check with the chefs/managers to be sure. \\nAtmosphere: I was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the restaurant. The servers were pleasantly friendly, and the servers say thank you in Japanese after any guest finishes and leaves, which was surprising but nice!

I have very good memories of trying authentic Peruvian places after college with a friend who grew up in Peru.  Andina was good, but in comparison to the other places I've tried, this is on the average side. See below for the dishes we've tried:\\n\\nOstras - the restaurant only had west coast oysters that day, which I was happy about as I always liked west coast ones better than the east coast, as they tend to be meatier.  I wish I remember the names of the two types of oysters we tried, but both were not that great.  Also a few had shells in them, not the best shucking job I've seen.  The salsas didn't really do much for the oysters, I think I could've done without them.\\n\\nDe Corazon - beef heart kebobs, possibly my favorite dish of the meal.  They were seasoned perfectly and so tender.  I never had beef hearts before, but would love to try more in the future\\n\\nPicadillo Acebichado - beef tartare, it was pretty good, the raw quail egg was a nice touch and looked really pretty when it was brought out.  We've had a number of beef tartare dishes on this trip and this one was average to below average.  I don't think the flavor was the very robust\\n\\nArroz Con Mariscos - the paella was ok, again, it was good, but didn't blow me away.  The seafood in the dish were super bland, while the rice was well-cooked.  There wasn't anything very memorable about this dish.\\n\\nThe service was great.  We had a bit of time constraint (again, probably should not have picked this restaurant to rush through), and our server made sure every dish came out in a timely matter.

The maple frosting is very thick, and forms a substantial layer between the bacon and bar. It's very sweet-complaints about excessive sweetness are somewhat justified, but it's a good kind of sweet.\\n\\nThe bacon was quite good, a little chewier than I liked for the application but still on the right side of the chewy-crisp boundary. The maple and bacon worked well together. I could see doing a cake this way, or maybe cupcakes.\\n\\nHerself also got a plain raised chocolate, which she pronounced very good.

I'm a bit of a pizza snob, but I live in NYC and pizza there is an art!  Seriously, not just any pizza will do. \\n\\nUpon visiting my sister on the weekend of the blizzard, we decided to venture out on Sunday night to escape a little cabin fever. Armando's was open, so we ordered a couple of slices to go and hung out with my niece who devoured hers in no time flat. \\n\\nWhat I loved: the sauce isn't too acidic, it has just the right amount of salt, acid and sweet. They use really fresh ingredients. They have a perfect pizza crust; not too thin, not too thick, not too soggy, and not too crisp. And they cook everything to order!  If Goodie Locks were looking for the perfect pizza, I dare say this could be it! \\n\\nFor convenience, there are a couple of seats where you can stay in to eat or you can take it to go. The staff is super friendly and the prices are great!  If you are considering ordering delivery, slices are better than the whole pie - the center of the pie gets a little soggy under an abundance of ingredients, but slices are cooked to perfection all the way around. Also, something I always like I know when reading reviews for delivery,  the place is super clean and the ingredients are stored well and are fresh. So, if you don't have your eyeballs on the place, feel good in knowing that it is well maintained and that the staff works hard to make great pies in a lean environment!

I raise a toast--but just barely!-- each Sunday to their mixed marvels like the Midnight Sun-- in homage both to Broder and Flacido Domingo. If that joke failed to wow you, don't worry, once I was presented w/the bill it was clear the joke was on moi the whole time...\\n\\n\\nIn the second place, although they offer lamb burgers, and the guy double-checked with me how I wanted it cooked, he also called me \\"Boss,\\" which is a total deal breaker for me. One of the things I learned working in the corrections field was that inmates call the staff \\"Boss\\" as a form of blatant disrespect--- \\"B-O-S-S\\" spelled out backwards stands for \\"Stupid SOB\\" and so you should know that whenever someone attempts to use the term on you (gas station jockeys seem especially fond of the word, but they are not the only ones, by any means). Is it possible that people  might be using the term \\"Boss\\" in a harmless, or merely smarmy, but unknowing fashion? Sure it is. But they need to know that people like me automatically wonder \\"Is this person a convicted felon? And does he think he's being sly?\\" whenever they use that vulgar term.\\n\\n\\nThe other thing w/the burger was, it's all directly behind the counter, so you can watch them make your food, which isn't always the best idea, as it turns out. I watched my guy poke my burger w/his bare hand repeatedly to see if it was done. I did not observe him wash his hands a single time. What, do they not believe in latex gloves @ Broder? Maybe he has a \\"sensitivity\\" to latex, which brings us to the final point, in a round-about fashion.....\\n\\n\\nThe final observation about Broder was the staff. Every last one of them were supremely skinny, effeminate, pretty boys with more than a little bit of attitude.None of 'em could've been much more than 140#.

The Chicken and waffles were great, the chicken was fried/bone in and paired with a thick fresh Belgian waffle.  The grits had a nice flavor and consistency.  The Shrimp in the grits were cooked correctly however, they had a really strong Fish/Shrimp/Bottom of the Sea flavor...so perhaps not as fresh as they could be...so we ended up abandoning those.  \\n\\nFor spirits we each had a couple of red headed strangers....their spin on a Bloody Mary.  The Tomato mix itself is quite viscous however, I believe they account for this anomaly because they serve the drink with a tiny beer, which we used to dilute the remaining mix once half consumed....so its a good execution when used in that manner. The drink is dressed with the usual Bloody Mary suspects, except for the amazing ethereal piece of bacon that adorns the damn thing!! That bacon was long, crisp, and really set the drink off.  Also, it gives you something to munch on whilst you wait for a table.  \\n\\n Overall it was an acceptable brunch with a nice vibe.  Its busy and it can be a bitch to park so my suggestion is to arrive a bit earlier in the brunch hours or later.  Also, one tip we did not receive upon entering is that you can sit at these small cocktail tables right behind the hostess area.

Part of the reason for this was our meal at Broder.\\n\\nThis was NYW's favorite meal on our Portland trip.  Tucked away in a little pocket commercial corner in Southeast Portland, Broder serves up Scandinavian breakfast like woah.  We arrived around 11ish, and it took almost 45 minuts to be seated.  However, we were sent next door to a bar called Savoy while we waited.  Here bartenders offered us coffee and drinks while we waited in comfy lounge-type booths.  How civilized!\\n\\nUnable to order everything off of the menu, we went with highlights:\\n\\nI had the Danish pancakes, which were actually more like fluffy light pancake balls than your typical pancakes, flapjacks or crepes.  So fabulous!  I enjoyed mine with applesauce and lemon curd, although the lemon curd stole the show.  If I could do it over I'd have doubled down on the lemon, for sure like Stacy M suggested.  My one complaint about this dish was the sauces did not last through the entire meal despite my best efforts to stretch them.  I was extremely ginger with my dipping and still ran out with about 3 pancakes left.\\n\\nNYW ordered the Broder plate which included smoked trout, farmer's cheese, salami, rye toast, yoghurt with fruit, and some other delicious odds and ends.  It practically vanished before our very eyes, and as it turns out was just light enough to feel satisfied after eating it without feeling uncomfortably full.  Always a plus.\\n\\nOur friend had the grilled cheese and was delighted with it as well.  Ultimately, grilled cheese is typically just grilled cheese, so I can't comment too thoroughly on whether it was mind-blowing or just so-so.\\n\\nThe dining atmosphere was pleasant and unpretentious.  It almost felt like you were in a good friend's extended dining room.  Service was exceptional; staff were extremely friendly and went the extra mile to accommodate us and ensure that we had a thoroughly pleasant meal.  At one point I noticed a very interesting tap pull and asked about their beer on draft.  Our server poured me a sizeable taste of a delicious ale from Double Mountain Brewing Company, based in Hood River.  Alas, they only sell it by the keg or I'd have brought it home.  I wanted more than the taste but couldn't justify beer with my pancakes.  Guess I'm not a real Scandinavian...\\n\\nEven with the side waiting area, the wait seemed obscene...we waited almost an hour over at Savoy, and I thought that was overkill even despite our fabulous meal, so I axed a star for the wait."},{"name":"JINYA Ramen Bar","address":"5975 Roswell Rd, Ste B-217","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is absolutely delicious!

She opened the window again and handed me the bag of food without saying a word - not even \\"thank you.\\" I asked her if soy sauce was in the bag and she started walking away so I repeated the question again. With NO eye contact she said soy sauce was in the bag and hurried to close the window. Still no \\"thank you\\" or nothing. I don't know why she was rushing as there was nobody in back of me car in line and only a few ppl inside eating. I arrived home only to realize that there was no soy sauce in my bag. I was pissed given the fact that I asked the young lady twice and she said it was in the bag. Honestly, it can't be that hard working at a fast food restaurant. Seriously! It takes 2 seconds to check the customers bag for requested items. Probably won't be returning to this location again.

It doesn't take long to figure out that this is their flagship. It makes its way into the hearts of many and transcends all ages and people groups. It's just a damn good dessert. Get it, let that salty caramel stick in your teeth, and know that you're part of the club. \\n\\nOn the more savory side, I'm a huge fan of their soups. My favorite of years past has been a curried sweet potato, but the crab tomato bisque is great, too. They'll cycle through a bunch of different varieties, so, as the temperature falls (and should you be a fan of soup as I am) check the menu as it changes. Do yourself a favor and also order a whole baguette alongside. Eat the whole thing or share it with a friend, but their bread is fantastic. \\n\\nParking is a breeze, too.

That being said, I have full confidence that this place will be successful.  \\n\\nA few friends and I braved the subzero temperatures to make a trip to Kingmakers for their first official day of business.  It's located on Buttles near Goodale Park in the lower level of a building.  I immediately thought of a grown man playing Dungeons & Dragons in his mother's basement.  \\n\\nWalking down a few stairs I was greeted by a well lit room several tables and a small bar off to the side.  Most of the tables were filled with patrons rolling dice, shuffling cards, offering wood for sheep, and sipping on mason jars of beer and wine.  There were several large bookcases lined with a vast array of board games.  I knew I was going to like this place.\\n\\nWe took our seats around an open table.  Being the \\"gamer\\" of the group, I was elected to pick a game that the group would enjoy.  I had done a little research on the game \\"Smash Up\\" and was a little curious on how it played.  It seemed to be a simple, light-hearted game that would ease people whose realm of experience ranged from Shoots and Ladders to Sorry.  However, since this review is not about the game we played, I'll just say we had a great time playing.\\n\\nOur server aka waiter aka bartender aka board game sommelier gave us a warm welcome and explained how Kingmakers operated and gave us a brief rundown of the hopes and aspirations for the place.  He informed us of the $5 Library Fee, which I at first thought was a little steep, but when I thought about it, it seemed reasonable.\\n\\nLet me explain, Kingmakers is a business and as a business, they are out to make money.  Board games can take quite a long time to play and as such, players/patrons will occupy a table much longer than they would at and ordinary bar or restaurant.  If players are not consistently purchasing food and drink, then Kingmakers stands to lose money on that occupied table.\\n\\nSo, in short, pay the $5 and support your local small business!\\n\\nAs for the drinks, they have a few beers and wine on tap, an assortment of bottled drinks that I didn't really get a chance to look over, and some food items which, again, I didn't really look over.  For what Kingmakers is, the selection was good.  Don't expect them to carry a huge selection the likes of some other local watering holes.  Odds are, if you're at Kingmakers, you're not looking for plethora of craft beers to begin with.\\n\\nWe drank our beers, played our game, laughed, and had a good time.  I will definitely be back!\\n\\nAs I said before, Kingmakers is brand new, so they have some things to work out.  In case they decide to read this, I have a few suggestions.\\n\\n1.  Serve baskets of pretzels.  There's a chance they already have this, but if not, these definitely should be on the menu!  It would really play up the Beer & Pretzels theme of the place while providing nerds something to munch on while they play, not to mention it's cheap and easy.  Charge a couple of bucks for a basket of good old Rold Golds and you're in like flint.\\n\\n2.  Really play to the nerd crowd.  They need their three food groups; Cheetos, Doritos, and Mountain Dew.  Ok, so that's maybe not what you want to serve, but I could see Kingmakers working with local bakers and shops to get some whimsical food items on their menu.  I've eaten lemon-lime cupcakes with Mountain Dew frosting before.  It tastes just like it smells.  Delicious.\\n\\n3.  Offer a library card.  I know we talked to our sommelier about this and he mentioned there had been talks about this.  It would be nice to pay a flat fee for a one month, three month, six month, or one year card to Kingmakers.  \\n\\n4.  If a library cards isn't plausible, offer a rewards card.  This could be as simple as get five stamps on your card and get a free visit.  Or offer different levels of rewards.  If there is one thing nerds like to do, it's leveling up!  Make some kind of a tiered promotion where you can earn free visits, t-shirts, beer cozies, etc.  Just a thought.\\n\\n5.  Put in a war gaming table.  This is really a selfish request.  I've always wanted to place within walking distance where I can play games like I can play games like Warhammer.  Again, totally selfish and I'm not holding my breath ;)\\n\\n\\nTL;DR\\nGreat place!

Our name was added to a list of 15 or so people, and we were told that it would be 35-40 minutes - ok so it's a long time, but no problem, they have a patio and bar in the back, and they'll come get us when it's ready. It seems like they write down a brief description of the person to find them later - I had a sneaking suspicion about the mechanics of such a system but figured they had it covered somehow.\\n\\nSo we go out back, grab some beers and wait - 35, 40, 45, 50 minutes. Then we start noticing that people who had arrived way after us were getting seated. So we go to the front to ask what the hell was going on, and are told, \\"Oh we couldn't find you.\\" Well, we were in the same seats on their patio for 50 minutes, and they managed to find other people, so what the hell? I know, stuff happens, but I strongly suspect our experience was not unique at this place - there is something wrong with a system where they don't even attempt to call out peoples names to be sure they are still around.\\n\\nSo we finally get seated, order and wait 25 more minutes for a delicious margherita pizza. After an hour and a half of waiting, we heartily tore into it and soon we were down to one slice. Very shortly after reaching this point (less than 3 minutes) a waitress who was not ours comes by and asks if we'd like a box. I had 3/4 of a beer left, and was planning on sitting a bit before working on that last slice, however upon me saying 'No.' She snatches the pan and slice and is off across into the back before I can even react. I didn't want to chase her across the restaurant yelling, so I let it go, but again, what the hell? In thousands of restaurant visits in my life I have never had a situation where 'I don't want a box' meant 'I am done eating'. I felt totally rushed - we spent less time sitting there eating than we did waiting for the pizza (and far less than the wait).\\n\\nThere are a hundred places to eat in Austin, and a couple of other pizza places which compare - sadly I would like to try more of their menu, but I don't go back to places after bad experiences, and that wait isn't really worth it anyway.

Service was excellent as well - utensils were changed, we were constantly being asked how we were, and plates were cleared almost as soon as we finished our dish.\\n\\nWe decided to eat all our meals tapas/family style and ordered several appetizers, 1 entree, 1 side, a couple oysters, and 1 dessert:\\n\\n- Complimentary fresh salted dinner rolls (does not come with butter) - some of the best dinner rolls and free bread I've ever had.  No butter even required.  Perfectly sweet and salty.\\n\\n- Kale salad w/chorizo - this definitely has a kick to it and I would not recommend it to those who are sensitive to heat.  The kale was pretty tough and this was probably my least favorite dish.\\n\\n- Grilled octopus - unlike any flavor of grilled octopus I've had... it's not your typical lemony grilled octopus.  Both my friend and I agreed that the mix of spices and sauces was quite strange.  Octopus was cooked perfectly.\\n\\n- Mussels - your typical garlic mussels, but very flavorful and the broth was amazing.  Mussels were larger than I've had in this type of dish.\\n\\n- Oysters - super fresh and comes with plenty of condiments.  I prefer large oysters and they were nice and meaty.  I know nothing about oysters though... I just know I like the big ones :)\\n\\n- Salmon toast - OH MY GOODNESS THIS IS SO GOOD GET IT.\\n\\n- Duck fat swordfish - the dish looks really boring but it's cooked to perfection and perfectly seasoned - not too much, not too little.  The fresh yellow peaches and puree were a nice touch.  We loved this... highly recommend.\\n\\n- Hushpuppies - unlike any hushpuppies you've had before.  These are great and I would also highly recommend getting these as a side.\\n\\n- Tres leches cake - comes with lots of peaches.  It's a bit different than the tradiitional Mexican/South American tres leches in that I find that one more flavorful, but this was moist and milky and was still delicious.

Seating is tight, the benches are shared and  move when other customers move around too much which I found disturbing since I was in the seat between two benches that pinched when people moved around. There is a counter though, and chairs. Everyone who was seated after us were served before us, which was odd, maybe something we got? We ordered hot chocolate and it was phenomenal! We split two meals, the apple fritters and the eggs and hash. We got the pickled beets on the side because we thought they'd be huge and dripping juices but they were tiny little diced beets so if you are weary, just leave em in, no biggie. Eggs are baked and were great. Hash was different because the potatoes were tiny diced pieces and I really liked it. The beef was little chunks, not the roast beef I pictured but also great. The fritters were really good! We looked at our neighbors pancakes which were little fried dough balls and def wanna try them next time.

The bloody mary was also surprisingly on point, with bacon/bacon-infused vodka (?), mmmm ^_^"},{"name":"Union Oyster House","address":"41 Union St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Unfortunately for my wife and I, the historic value of this restaurant was overshadowed by the poor quality of the food that was served to us. \\n\\nCornbread: Complimentary for both of us, this dish had a high potential to be delicious. Where it fell flat  was, while my wife's was served hot and crispy, mine was served barely warm. The flavor was still good, but probably would have been more pronounced had it been a few degrees higher. 7.5/10\\n\\nBoston clam chowder: Got a single cup of this Boston staple, and can't say anything bad about it. Not spectacular by any means, but also not the best I've eaten so far in Boston. 8/10\\n\\nOnion soup gratienne: Wife ordered this for her app, a very different flavor from what we're used to, but by the end of the bowl my wife began to enjoy it. 7/10\\n\\nOyster Rockefeller: I was really looking forward to this dish. I have to admit, I don't eat oysters very often, but I have had several iterations of this dish from various places, and always enjoyed it. However, this time was lacking. The first couple that I ate were actually not hot, but very warm. There was also too much spinach for my taste. Now, I'm not a vegetable guy, but there was definitely an imbalance of spinach to oyster to cheese for this dish. The remaining oysters were nice and hot, and the oyster flavor was still recognizable, but still nothing to write home about. 6/10\\n\\nBroiled fresh boston scrod: My wife is not a big fan of seafood (yet we somehow ended up at a place called the oyster house, go figure) but she does have an affinity for mild white flaky fish, which is why she went with the scrod. The waiter told us that the scrod came with some boiled potatoes, and he wasn't, but what he failed to mention was that the potatoes would have absolutely no taste to it, which might have been alright had the fish not tasted the exact same way. Somewhere along the lines my wife had squeezed lemon over her fish, as well as adding salt, but when I took a bite of it I honestly could not tell she had done so, as it tasted so bland. The fish was breaded and broiled, so the top side had a decent crisp to it, but there was some water in the bottom of the plate (I'm guessing from the potatoes) so the underside of the fish was soggy. 4/10\\n\\nLobster scampi: Holy hell, just look at the picture below. Where do I even begin with this monstrosity? First, nowhere on the menu does it say you will receive the ENTIRE lobster on your plate. Normally this wouldn't be an issue, except the head is served as just a garnish, and there's no room on your plate to store this giant, unnecessary adornment. I actually had to use my paper placemat to store it, as well as the tail, on the side so I could even get to my pasta. Now let's talk about the pasta. Before I could even dive into it, I noticed a lot of liquid pooled in the bottom of my bowl, which I mistook for butter from the scampi or perhaps some tasty leftovers from the cooking of the lobster. I realized was wrong on both accounts as I took a bite of the pasta. The pasta barely tasted of anything, with just a hint of butter and garlic. It tasted....watery, which might explain the liquid on the bottom of my bowl. Oh well, at least I have my lobster, right? The star of the show, the whole reason for being here? Nope. It was overcooked, rubbery, chewy, and bland. There was one piece of meat from the claw knuckle that was delicious, but the rest was just a disappointment. 3/10\\n\\nOverall the wait staff was friendly but not very attentive. It seemed like they were overworked with the vast amount of people being served that night. He never refilled our water, and we had to ask to get my soda refilled. He neglected to bus our cornbread dishes until right before serving the entrees, and was hard to find when we wanted our check. They wiped down our tables well before we sat, but there was food stuck in the cranny behind the cushion of our seat. There was also a support beam situated right next to me in our booth, which made it hard to sit comfortably. Thankfully it was on my right, and I'm left handed."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Ah-ma-zing.

Apparently they no longer use it in any drinks, so I hope they keep it.\\n\\nThe menu is a bit limited.  A couple of salads, a couple of burgers, some sammiches.  Repeat visitors might find themselves bored, except that the burgers are REALLY good.  The mac n' cheese is NOT.  Maybe they were just off that day but hands down the worst I've had.  Seriously, the blue box is better. \\n\\nLast weekend one of the bartenders told me that there's been a line to get in a few times the last few months.  Which shocked both of us.

Low Brow is awesomer, anyway.\\n\\nMe, I don't dig the non-smoking (see statement about totchos), but I have a few friends who are whiny about that so this is convenient for them.\\n\\nOh, and chalkboards in restrooms are A BAD IDEA.

The hot dogs certainly looked fancy, and the meat was good. But the bread was surprisingly sweet. Hot dogs aren't meant for sweet buns. I don't think that the flavors mix very well, so this definitely could have been better. My lobster roll was quite disappointing though. It came with waaay too much celery in it. And globs of mayo. It was the worst lobster roll I had. It also came with the same sweet bread as a bun. \\n\\nI ended the meal with a creme brulee, and I think it's pretty hard to mess that one up.

The space is large and since it was an off-time, there was no wait. Walking in, I was immediately impressed with their wall of liquor. Not only is it comprehensive, but it is aesthetically pleasing. The main dining room looked like a converted warehouse with exposed piping. I know that's super trendy and it's really un-hipster of me to say this, but that stuff still impresses me. There is also an oyster bar, which was closed during the day. \\n\\nI got the filet-of-fish sandwich, which was pretty good. It was a good chunk of fish between two buttery pieces of jalapeno texas toast. The jalapeno gave it a little kick, but was not overly intrusive as I only placed what the taste was halfway through the meal. I also had a side of hush puppies, which were amazing. They were little balls of cornmeal with whole corn niblets, deep fried and sprinkled with powdered sugar. They came with a brown butter, which was like crack for a foodie. Do not order the burger (the fact that its the only non-seafood entree on the menu should've been your first clue). It is greasy and nothing special.\\n\\nParking is a $2 valet. I'm against places that charge for valet parking, especially when there is no option to self-park. Economically, people would probably be willing to pay more than $2 if it was a voluntary gratuity.

First off, the portion itself would be filling enough as a meal. 2 of my friends ate off of it with me so it was plenty! Whatever bowl they used kept the food hot so even though we were talking a lot and eating slowly, the mac and cheeses stayed pretty hot. Oh yeah and it was so good! I don't know what spices Chef Calvin used in it but it was different...a great different! \\n\\nI was also able to share in the calamari, seafood spring rolls, and mussels and they were all awesome as well! For my entree I had the grilled lamb...words cannot explain how good that freaking food was so seriously JUST GO! \\n\\nThe place is small and cozy and you could pass it if you blink too long (probably why we've never seen it before). They have complimentary valet as soon as you pull up so no need to find parking and that's always a plus.

Don't be fooled by the name - they are far more than a pizza joint, they're a full sit down Italian restaurant. The ambiance is lovely, the staff is polite and professional, and they even have live music on some nights for a little entertainment with your meal! \\n\\nThe endless free breadsticks are delicious, we usually take an entire to-go box full of them home to reheat for later (in an oven or a microwave, depending on how lazy we feel. They come out surprisingly well nuked, just cover in a damp paper towel to avoid them getting too dry). \\n\\nSometimes the owner even walks around the restaurant asking people if everything is satisfactory - to me, that is a big sign of a local/family-owned restaurant doing things the right way.\\n\\nThe salads are good. Fresh ingredients, your standard selection of common salad dressings, and they come free with an entree. Nothing to write home about but having a nice little salad before you engorge yourself with meats, cheeses, carbs, and all those other delicious staples of Italian cooking is never a bad idea. Just don't fill up on salad and breadsticks :)\\n\\nThey can be busy, especially during normal dinner rush times, so don't show up with no reservation at 7 on a Friday and expect to be seated and dining 15 minutes later.\\n\\nMy personal recommendations are the chicken marsala and chicken or eggplant parmesan.

I selected Lenoir for our staff dinner the night prior to our meeting, based on the great reviews. It did not disappoint. Lenoir was a gorgeous venue. So intimate, and exactly the atmosphere I was looking  for. It was absolutely charming, with decor that you only hope to achieve in your home with antique furnishings and Pinterest inspiration. Their light fixtures centered above the communal table where we were seated were perfect. The restaurant is very small, so our party of 12 took up the majority of the space, but it was never too loud or crowded. They greeted us on the adorable porch where the hostess lives, and then brought us all in together. The service was impeccable. Every detail in the restaurant is clearly so thoughtful. My whole group was so impressed. And to the food. I loved the prixe-fixe menu and there was so many great options. I loved that you could choose any 3 from the different groupings. It's definitely not cheap, but not overpriced with the quality. I believe their menu changes frequently but I can say that all of the dishes were so unique and none of my 3 options disappointed. The agnolotti and goat shawarma was actually incredible. And i believe this feeling was reiterated by all of my guests. The wine list was also unique and tasty.

They use Handsome Coffee and will serve pour-over in addition to any espresso beverage. Baristas are great.

I'd ordered the Angus beef burger ($12) and a sweet onion soup ($8), and my selections arrived in a reasonable period of time. The sweet onion soup was delicious. The Angus beef burger arrived soon after and it was thick, flavorful, topped with melted Tillamook cheddar cheese and a mound of lettuce, tomato, and onions. Admittedly, for $12, I expected something...greater. I chose iced tea for my beverage, and my lunch came to $23. Service was polished and attentive, so I added $5 as a gratuity. I will return with my wife for seafood or prime rib dinner, with the expectation that our dinners (based on what I'd read of the menu) would be roughly $40-50+ apiece, so I will wait for an occasion. \\nIn summary, the atmosphere is pleasant, service was very good, the noise levels permitted conversation, and the food was well-prepared but seems somewhat overpriced.

If you look at my last review, I gave this place a harsh 1, a rating that I very, very rarely give. After the manager gave me an apologetic call, I decided to give it a second chance.\\n\\nVIEW - 5 STARS. Thanks to its prime real estate, Top of the Hub has hands down the most beautiful views of Boston. No matter which side of the restaurant you sit on, the view is nothing short of breathtaking. While you can't request window seating, making a reservation a month ahead of time will increase your chances.\\n\\nSERVICE - Eh, pretty average. Our waters were always filled, so I have no complaints, but don't expect an attentive Michelin starred quality service. Our waiter didn't bother to introduce us to the specials on the menu or recommend any of the wines.\\n\\nFOOD - Okay, this is where Top of the Hub is just flat out inconsistent. I would highly recommend the crab cake for an appetizer and the warm chocolate cake with ginger ice cream for dessert. Both are outstanding. The duck confit pappardelle was quite the hit at our table, but it was borderline too salty for me. \\n\\nFor our mains, our group ordered a variety of steak, pork chop, seafood fra diavolo, and chicken pasta. The meats were rather tough; my medium steak ended up very much well done; meat was hidden under an overwhelmingly sweet sauce, so sweet that I could not appreciate the meat. I love steak that melts in my mouth, hence why I ordered the veal, but this just didn't have the effect. The fra diavolo sauce on the other hand tasted like regular tomato sauce, no spice or complexity of any sort. Go to the North End for better variations of this dish. There was a generous portion of lobster meat and mussels, so that was nice. Lastly, the chicken pasta was so ordinary and definitely not worth the $28 price tag. \\n\\nIn summary, Top of the Hub is a beautiful place to take someone special out to for a celebration.

A free appetizer for the table or a simple \\"Sorry about the wait, guys!\\" would have gone a long way here.\\n\\nThe general consensus at our table was that the food was just OK and certainly not worth another visit . Two of my friends ordered red wine which tasted RANCID, clearly from an old, stale bottle. Another friend ordered a veggie platter; two items weren't properly cooked and were too hard and bitter to eat. We didn't bother telling our server about any of this because at this point we were just trying to rush through our meal so we could make it to our other plans after dinner.

The place looks like several trailers with wheels removed that they assembled like legos and just slapped on a  facade in front. It's pretty rundown and I'm surprised that an Atlantic hurricane or a tornado hasn't carried it away yet. The tiny bathroom was the giveaway that it once probably was a trailer, (pretty disgusting). I don't think anyone cleans this place and judging by the patrons, they just make sure that they clean the bar area with bleach. Maybe because of the smell of oysters is already so strong that there's no point in using cleaning products to clean the bathrooms because the smell of your poop is still no match for the strong scent of spent oyster shells.\\n\\nThey have tables but to really experience this place the bar is ideal. You get better service even though I feel like sanitary care should be taken to not touch any part of the bar. The bar is made of long concrete slab that is suitable for gutting fish in an assembly line. It's been painted over but the paint has chipped away and repainted without removing the old paint so that the surface becomes uneven over time. The bar has a mild slant away from you towards the back where liquid and other trash empties into the continuation of a concrete latrine-like sink basin to allow for liquid, spent oyster shells and trash to flow towards.\\n\\nThey mount the paper towel dispenser overhead which I assume is to separate clean from dirty (the bar). The overhead also serves as cabinets to house paper plates, condiments, everything else not oysters. That's good design!\\n\\nI have to say that the oysters are fresh but because of the speed of the shucking by the waitress, you're bound to consume some crunchy shell parts.\\n\\nThe day we went there, there were 2 guys sitting to the right of us. One of the guy looks over to acknowledge our existence and was missing a couple of top front teeth. I guess if you're missing teeth, oysters would become your favorite too. They seemed like regulars. As they ate and drank their pitcher of beer, every oyster they ate, they would throw the shell into the long sink behind the bar. A little while later, they would go outside to smoke and come back in to order another bucket along with another pitcher. That pretty much sums up the entire experience.\\n\\nI guess for the price, you really can't beat it. However, part of the adventure is always having in the back of your mind whether you will get sick from the oysters or from contracting something by accidentally touching the bar. While the food is really good and the price is super cheap, you have to ask, \\"How hard is it really to serve raw oysters? There's no cooking involved!\\" and is it worth being in an environment that is dingy, dark and sanitarily challenged?\\n\\nI'm just surprised that the health inspectors haven't said anything.\\n\\nOverall experience = 4 stars minus 1 star for sanitation."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I was visiting Atlanta and definitely wanted to try some Southern cooking.

One was taking orders, there was one runner, and one cook. The runner was slowly cleaning up as he could. Later, I saw someone working on the drink machine. I made my order and tried to find a clean table. It was mostly clean but food was under the table. I began regretting placing an order but because we mostly had great experiences here, I did anyway. Surely there'd be no issues. After I sat down, I watched what looked like the manager leave and take a phone call. He never walked back in. The phone was ringing off the hook. Someone else came in and finally answered the phone then tried to find the manager, walked down the sidewalk, then come back in confused and took the call. He began to apologize to someone who made a to-go order and then walked back out to find that guy again. Meanwhile, the runner was chatting with the cook and probably had no choice but to wait for the food. The place stayed dirty. My poke bowl was okay. Parts of it was stale as if they made it this morning and kept it out. I really didn't want to go back and complain because that would have held up the now 4 or so tables who put in an order.

I happened to be in town 2 days on business and some of the people I was meeting with decided we needed to hit up this Portland landmark. The line was seemingly an hour long, but it moves quickly and less than 20 minutes later we were all sitting down with more lightly-fried, sugar-filled confections than is good for anyone.\\n\\nWe got pretty much everything, but the highlight was definitely the Bacon Maple Bar of lore. It's really good. The sweet and salty flavors work very well together, but I think the sweet winds up being a bit overpowering. It even manages to drown out some of the maple flavors which is too bad because the maple syrup and bacon motif is really good.\\n\\nI also had an old-fashioned glazed doughnut which was nothing to complain about, but I'd rather have had one at Top Pot in Seattle than here.\\n\\nThe other doughnuts were all yummy--but, let's be honest, it's hard to make a bad doughnut--and were all sorts of random things combined.

It's right on a nice closed street that's been turned into a pedestrian walkway with picnic tables put out. The whole place *feels* like Portland in all of it's mellow, slightly grungy, hipster ways including having random banjo-playing street bands playing while you stand in line.\\n\\nAs if that wasn't enough, the place next door is a strip club and while we were eating our doughnuts we had an entertaining conversation with one of the strippers while she was having a smoke.

I wasn't aware that they had a large shared square table (about 12 seats) for individual/small parties so I was caught a little off guard - but I'm not really shy so it wasn't a problem. They provided a nifty carrier for my bags so I wouldn't leave them sprawled on the ground or on my chair, definitely a nice touch. Service was quick but courteous, the server briefly went over the special for the day but I opted for something familiar (Tonkatsu Shoyu Ramen) so I could make a comparison to the ramen shops from back home in CA. The food came out faster than I could finish a brief journal entry and was a little underwhelming in size (despite paying +$1 for a large) - but it was definitely filling and had plenty of noodles. There were only 2 slices of pork which was a bit disappointing for the price - but it was tasty and easy to bite apart without any struggle, so I was glad to not splash all over my neighbor (less than a foot away from me). The broth was a bit salty so I'll probably opt for miso next time. The servers and kitchen staff called out \\"Arigatou Gozaimasu\\" when I got up and the hostess and a few servers thanked me on the way out - a nice touch that stays true to authentic ramen houses. +1 kudos for the jazzy music - it set a fun and groovy mood, and was more enjoyable than trying to force an authentic experience by playing more traditional Japanese music or something of the like (I hate hearing mandolins when I eat ramen, maybe I'm just weird).

I had asked him if they had any drink specials, not uncommon at a bar... I was told sternly \\"No,\\" and he walked away.\\n\\nOne thing I noticed about the bartenders is that they seemed like they shouldn't be behind the bar. Consistently spilling drinks they were attempting to pour out of the tap onto themselves and the floor with pretty much every drink order. The biggest offender for me was when my friend got his beer he picked off food stuck to the outside of the glass. When a bar can't even wash their glasses properly, there's problems.\\n\\nFairly quickly I was very unimpressed with their lack of friendliness and customer care, we seemed more like an annoyance simply because we were taking our time reading the menu. Upon reading the menu, I noticed another thing: absurd prices on some of their items. $12 for a Caesar salad, $5 for a side of coleslaw - I'm no cheapo but this isn't downtown Boston we're in. Their meat prices seemed on par but I needed a quick lunch. I ended up just getting a plate of sweet potato fries while planning in my head where to go afterwards for food. My friend got a Ruben and a side of coleslaw.\\n\\nConsidering the place was dead and it was lunch time the food took your standard dinner service ticket time to come out and we didn't order anything complex. The one thing everything we ordered shared in common: zero seasoning - not even the essentials of salt and pepper. We grabbed salt and pepper from a table and seasoned the food and even then, saying that it was bland would be giving it too much credit. We regrettably ate our food for pure hunger's sake while being ignored by the bartender and when he did come by to collect our plates we just wanted the check.\\n\\nEven though I did not try their meat, the fact that something simple like seasoning with salt and pepper was tossed aside negates any desire for me to pay their prices just to try and find out how the meat is. Overall, there are plenty of better places to get quality meat for better prices, customer service, and a friendly environment.

We had dinner reservations but arrived with a few minutes to spare. So, we went to the outdoor space to get some drinks and take in the wonderful environment we were in. The 'backyard' is this gorgeous space with huge trees which, I assume, is much-needed shade in the hot Austin sun. There are string lights and lanterns hung on the branches, which added to the ambiance. There was also a silent film playing on a small projection screen; how utterly adorable. We drank our wine before heading inside for dinner service. The restaurant interior was just as gorgeous and charming as outside, with the long communal table in the middle of this quaint space and a pretty chandelier over it. We sat on one of the high-tops, though. \\n\\nAs noted on their website, Lenoir offers a prix fixe dinner for $38, and the nice thing is everything is about the same proportion so you can mix-and-match any of the dishes and be equally fulfilled. If you want, you can pick all three options from one category, our server said. Side note: our server was amazing, very educational and super friendly. Definitely a star in my mind. \\n\\nAfter deliberating for a few minutes, I took some of our server's recommendation and went with the 1) poha crusted mahi 2) confit goat with semolina coconut polenta, red curry, and cauliflower, and 3) caramelized pound cake with roquefort cheese and grapefruit. The confit goat was a-ma-zing; it was fall-apart tender and wonderfully seasoned. It went perfectly with the coconut polenta, and the curry provided just the right amount of heat to the dish. The pound cake worked really well with the grapefruit and the stinky roquefort cheese. The mahi-mahi wasn't my fave, but it was still pretty good. Lenoir is one of those restaurants wherein the physical space, the solid service, and the delicious food play almost equal roles in creating a truly wonderful experience."},{"name":"Naked Pizza","address":"1331 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3","text":"Solid slice.

This was the best service I think we've ever had in a restaurant with kids in tow.  They were given an etch-a-sketch at the door, then balloons, then serenaded with live accordian and singing.  Food came out at a steady pace (fondue and bread first), so they didn't get too hungry waiting.  Lemonade is available in the lobby for people who have to wait for a table.  We came for an \\"early\\" dinner, so we got a less expensive menu.  Our entrees were around $15 each (very reasonable and great portions), and the kid's menu was fabulous.  My son got his own plate of schnitzel and noodles and a glass of milk for less than $5.  They also have an option for kids 3 and under for $1.95 (AMAZING), so my daughter got noodles and cheese.  The noodles are handmade; very tasty.  A great experience; we'll be back!\\n\\nMy only critique is that it is A LOT of starch.  Bread with fondue, then dinner rolls, then noodles.

We stood in line outside for legitimately 30 minutes on a Friday midday to even make it to the inside of the store. Sure, I know it's a tourist attraction, but the sheer length of time it took for us to make it inside was pretty shocking. Especially since it's not exactly in a great neighborhood (this is coming from someone who lives in Baltimore and has stood in line outside for less.). \\n\\nOnce inside, the line continues and you are brought into a kitschy but weirdly sexualized lobby area that smells of cloying B.O. Not in a temporary way, but in a way where you can TELL everyone there just stinks. Not something you want when you're trying to eat a donut. We decided to just grab one donut - the old dirty bastard (which is chocolate frosted, with Oreo crumbles and a peanut butter drizzle). We also grabbed a cold brew (which was a \\"new featured item!!\\" But came out to be a literal milk carton of overly sweetened milky coffee) \\n\\nThe donut itself was fine. But totally forgettable. For $1 I can get a donut from Dunkin and crumble some cookies on top of it and have the same experience.

However, I had never had the chance until recently to make it up there for dinner. Unfortunately, it was an extremely disappointing experience. This review is particularly about Valentine's Day, but I think that my experience illuminates some of the questionable business practices this restaurant has. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I made a Valentine's Day reservation in mid-January (so about 3-4 weeks before February 14th) with no issue. We made a reservation for 9:30 at night - which is quite late, but we figured it would be well worth the wait! \\n\\nThe day of the 14th, he received a call from the restaurant confirming our reservation. The person on the phone mentioned to him that there was a Valentine's Day Special - but was unwilling to give further information besides that. My boyfriend asked what the \\"Valentine's Day Special\\" was - was it a different menu? Was it a special meal option? What was it? The woman on the other line was very brusque and said along the lines of - \\"Oh, it's just a special we offer\\" and \\"you can look online if you'd like.\\" Overall, her tone was quite rude. \\n\\nHe was sort of put off by that, and he looked online at what was called the \\"Valentine's Day Special\\" - a $125 dollar per person, 5-course meal. Nothing online indicated that this was the ONLY thing available on February 14th. We were really looking forward to eating off of the regular menu. We both have some dietary restrictions, and both knew that there were things on the regular menu that we would really enjoy. (I'm sure you can all see where this story is going). \\n\\nWe arrive to the restaurant on Friday, after waiting to eat until 9:30. We are seated and given the menu and are told that the $125/person meal is the ONLY thing available to us. \\n\\nWe, of course, expressed that we were NOT told accurate information, even when we asked specifically during the afternoon confirmation call. Our server was really quite nice, and we knew it wasn't his fault, but we told him that we really wouldn't be able to do the $125/person meal. We were expecting and willing to pay quite a bit for this meal (the regular menu is quite pricey as well) but NOT $250 dollars before tax, tip, and drinks. Not to mention that there were a few things that we would not have been able to even been able to eat! \\n\\nOur server brought over the manager (I'm assuming?), who apologized for the miscommunication and told us that we are not the first people this happened to tonight. He offered us each a free drink as a consolation, which was nice....but it didn't take away from the fact that it was then 10:00 pm and we had not eaten dinner, and every restaurant in the city was full/booked. \\n\\nSo, we sipped our \\"free\\" drinks (we of course still tipped our poor server who was now making no money off of our table) and tried to enjoy the view....while overhearing the SAME conversation happen again the next table over between a couple and their server - they were also not made aware of the different menu and reacted quite similarly to us. I think they decided to just pay for it - which makes me concerned that this might be something that Top of the Hub does on purpose or something  - they can get a few people to pay a bit more than they would normally be willing to pay by not disclosing that there is a change in menu/prices until customers are seated. I hope this isn't true.\\n\\nWord of warning to all of those who may try to come here on Valentine's Day or any other sort of holiday. Know what they're offering that night, and be PUSHY to get the right information. Otherwise, you might end up hungry (like us) or suckered into paying 300 dollars for a meal for two (like the people next to us). \\n\\nTop of the Hub - if you want to charge that much for a meal on holidays - that's your prerogative, I suppose. Maybe people will pay for it if they're aware before they make the reservation (or even just what is ON the menu, for us who can't eat everything!) Just don't be so deceptive.

I like a good burger and it was in my old neighborhood, so I agreed. \\n\\nThe first problem is that the parking provided is about 1/4 of what is needed for the number of tables and seats at the bar. We circled for a bit, frustrated that the only available space was unusable because someone had parked across two spaces. We finally caught a break when an employee from the car wash next door came to that very car. After I called to him and asked him to move it (and a few dirty looks from him), he finally moved his car into one space so that we could park. Great, not enough spaces AND the neighboring business is using them too.\\n\\nThe menu inside the door is reminiscent of eateries I frequented in Austin; pick the meat, the condiments, etc. and they custom-make your item. I chose to get one that was offered already designed, the Apache Style burger. It had pepper jack cheese, grilled onions, new mexico green chiles, and lettuce.\\n\\nThe young woman working the register was perched on a stool sitting with her back to the line of customers, leaning one arm on the counter. Her look of studied indifference to whether people wanted to order or not didn't make me an instant fan. I've generally experienced good customer service in Atlanta, so this was disappointing.\\n\\nI placed my order (with sweet potato fries that my colleague recommended), got my number and my cup and went to sit outside. The outside seating area was attractive so I would have used it anyway, but the interior was uncomfortably stuffy. Despite the steady wind, the table outside was pleasant with the condiments placed cleverly in an empty cardboard four-pack. Unfortunately, while I love the Beastie Boys, having \\"Sabotage\\" blasted that loudly in a dining area discourages-no, prevents-conversation. If they just want to turn tables quickly by making it impossible to relax and enjoy the covered patio, congratulations, success.\\n\\nThe food arrived promptly, served what appeared to be small aluminum cookie sheets. I rather liked that. However, instead of the sweet potato fries I ordered, I got what appeared to be Ore-Ida frozen crinkle cuts. I didn't want to go through the sturm-und-drang of sending the fries back so I shrugged that off. Though I had ordered the quarter-pound 'junior' (this is lunch, after all), the burger seemed poky. That said, the meat was fresh and properly cooked medium and the green chiles were nice (though more of a salsa than actual peppers).\\n\\nTo summarize:\\nGreat location on Piedmont\\nNice facility\\nPain-in-the-ass parking made worse by the neighbor's spot-poaching\\nMediocre-to-poor customer service (attitude, wrong food items)\\nGood but small burgers\\n\\nBased on this experience, I'd rather go to Flip or another burger joint were there is more emphasis on quality food and experience.

So she was quite surprised when I told her yesterday of my visit to Dynamic Dish- a mostly vegan, organic spot on Edgewood Ave, near Downtown.\\n\\nDynamic Dish is a sparesely decorated place with just four tables. It's mainly a lunch place, with dinners served only Thursday-Saturday. All the food is locally grown, and pretty much adheres to vegan preparation rules (although Georgia trout will be on the menu for Valentine's Day dinner). The menu changes everyday, although you will always find a soup, a salad, a sandwich and an entree. You would think this is not a place that a Steakhead like me would venture into, and for the most part, you are pretty much spot on. But two guys I work with have been raving about this place, and one in particular is a true Foodie, so I had to check it out.\\n\\nMy overall impression was actually quite positive. The soup was a Carrot soup with a hint of habanero. Now since Steakhead likes his spicy food, this was a big hit. The entree was called \\"Tea Space\\" Tofu Balls. Jeez, more tofu. I guess Tea Space was the name of a similar kind of place in Little Five Points back in the day, and one of the chefs there occasionally helps out at the Dish. I did try them, and since the tofu was all ground up, it didn't taste like it sounded (which to me was a ball of solid tofu). I still don't know if I could eat an entire meal of it though. I went with this mixed green salad with a kind of cheese that I never heard of and can't remember, and sunflower seeds. \\n\\nDrinks are another area of challenge for me in a place like this. Of course I wasn't expecting Diet Coke, but my only choices were hot espresso or tea, carrot juice, ginger juice, apple juice or bottled water. So bottled water it was. But here's the rub- the small soup, the salad, and the bottled water came out to $12. I wouldn't have thought such healthy living would cost so much.\\n\\nSo, I think Dynamic Dish will probably do very well. They seem to have a strong following, and I think the whole \\"locally sourced\\" food concept will just get bigger (see the sales of the book Omnivore's Dilemma for further proof). One thing that I liked about it was even if you are not living this kind of lifestyle, you will likely find other things on the limited menu that are very good in their own right. In other words, its not like you have to eat tofu.\\n\\nSteakhead Recommends- Yes, for those looking for a healthy alternative\\nPrice: $$"},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Very impressive lunch.

However, I rated it 4 stars because although the donuts weren't warm, or even \\"good enough to write home about\\" taste-wise, they were good, they were a perfect balance of sweet, (where I didn't get a stomach ache or feel bad afterwards) and they were definitely fun to look at. The store was also super entertaining to look at, the music was fun, the service was good (even with them being super busy with customers all the time, they didn't make you wait more than a minute to buzz you into the bathroom) and even with the long lines, they were pretty speedy. Overall, it doesn't live up to the hype but besides the expectation, which can be silly to have anyways, it's definitely worth a stop!

Just when you think you have found all your favorites...a new discovery.  My friend Val recommended Kennedy School for dinner while traveling on business.  The McMenamins (brothers, I think), who are known for converting old buildings into cool contemporary gathering places have converted an old elementary school into one such place.  Kennedy School has been transformed into a collection of incredible restaurants, pubs, a movie theatre, meeting and hotel rooms...we had dinner at one of the restaurants and ordered the humus plate, chicken and cranberry entree salad and marionberry crisp (yum!).

Well.. it was very good, fresh and juicy but I the best I have ever eaten no. It is not so much the food and the whether or not it is good, it is really about the price.  It is expensive for food off of a truck and eating on picnic tables and everything is a la carte'.  I ordered the two piece, which is a chicken leg and a chicken wing ($6) I ordered truffle mac and cheese as my side $5 and a Ziller park soda $3...so Thats $14 bucks plus tax and tip  for fried chicken, mac and cheese and a soda. Maybe its just me but I think that $14 plus for friend chicken is too much.  I asked for some honey that had ants in it.  The girl that took my order was super sweet I didn't have the heart to complain about the honey.  So for two people you are looking at $30 plus for some chicken.

Our family judges how good a Mexican restaurant is by their beans and rice and right off the bat, when you sit, they bring you chips and beans with cabbage slaw.  The beans are DELICIOUS!!! Just like abuelitas.  Not dry and not from a can full of gunk.  The rice is also perfect! Fluffy and flavorful, never hard or bland.  I've had a cadillac margarita, which was pretty strong :) just what momma needed :) and really good.  The food servings are generous, so we always get to take some home for later, which we LOVE.  Last night we ordered the queso fundido con chorizo and Pacificos.  OMG it took me right back to Puerto Vallarta!! The queso fundido was real melted cheese with authentic chorizo on top, served with homemade flour tortillas.  Warm and gooey and hard to serve, it was perfect!  Not a fakey wakey cheese like substance, real cheese people! :D  We ordered bottled Pacifico and they brought the chilled bottle with a frosted glass with salted rim and lime wedge.  Again, perfection!!  I recommend trying the Chicken mole, Carne Asada, and Taquitos Rancheros.  Next time we plan on sharing the fajitas.  The menu has such a variety, which I find really impressive and interesting.  I love that there are pictures on it, so you can get a good idea of what you are ordering.  The wait staff is attentive and polite.  The only negative thing I can say is that the booth we had last night was a little wobbly.  There was a little kid and a teen seated behind me and I understand that kids are active (I've got a handful of kids myself), but I shouldn't feel like I am on a bumper car with my seat getting literally bumped in and out...I think it just needs repair?

Get there early as the large parking lot in the back fills up really quickly as this is a very popular tourist place to hit up and while touristy restaurants aren't usually that good Mary Mac's is a whole different story; the food tastes really good!\\n\\nMy friends and I ordered that country fried steak, Fried chicken, Cheesy Shrimp and grits and complimentary pot likker taste bowl with cornbread muffin. I've never had pot likker before and at first taste it tasted a bit salty and like the left over or bottom part of the soup (could be why it's called pot likker? Let me know) but once you crumble some corn bread in it and mix it all up it was a uniquely delicious soup. My friend said the fried chicken was pretty good and while the country fried steak was good it came out room temperature cold.\\n\\nI got the Cheesy shrimp and grits and it could be the best version i have tried thus far. The shrimp is perfectly seasoned and cooked while the grits was creamy,  cheesy and packed full of flavor and i recommend this dish to anyone.

Crab and avocado grilled cheese - light and delicious. Pumpkin spice pancakes with a topping of brown sugar,  hazelnuts and dried cranberries - yum! Risotto with shrimp, also very tasty. \\n\\nThe setting is lovely, airy and bright with booths and high, ornate ceilings. When this restaurant was bustling years ago as part of the Mallory Hotel, the lunch crowd was a rather geriatric group. The other day, my daughter was definitely the youngest person in the place, and there were quite a few older folks. So, don't go expecting a hip scene: this is as close to what we natives call \\"old Portland\\" and that's not intended as a pun, it's a compliment for a restaurant that reminds us of a gentler, quieter time when three generations might have met to celebrate a birthday or the ladies might have met for lunch and conversation after shopping at one of Meier and Frank's Friday Surprise sales.\\n\\nOne last note.

A blend of French cottage style mixed with lighthearted whimsy, Amelie's is comfortable, spacious cafe with plenty of table seating for dining and working (perfect considering it's proximity to Georgia Tech!) as well as many beautiful couches and wing-back chairs for more casual interludes with friends, or to simply pass out in the food coma you are certain to be lulled into!\\n\\nOnce you see the tempting delights on display in their dry and cold cases, you will test the limits of your dietary self control... and with any luck, lose the battle!  Amelie's entire menu is full of the things that truly make life a joy: combinations of flavors that truly make your tastebuds dance, without an excessive use of sugar to cover up amateur technique or poor quality ingredients.  Their entire focus appears to be on the delicate, not the overbearing \\"wow\\" factor that so many other bakeries try to lure patrons with.  It is in this delicate simplicity that the creations Amelie's produces truly shine!  Their ham and greyure cheese tartine sandwich, for example, is simplicity itself: crusty, hearty bread topped with ham and a slice of cheese and toasted.  But the ham is delicate and tender and not overly salty; the cheese has a mild bite of a high quality greyure.  Simple, but perfect.\\n\\nAnd the pastries.... There is a special guardian Angel that must watch over those with the skills to produce such quality.  The Napoleon, for example: A classic delight of flaky pastry, custard cream, and a top layer of icing.  Simple, elegant... And too often butchered either poor quality ingredients, poor technique, or the mediocrity that comes from mass producing desserts for profit rather than with love and artistry.  \\n\\nAmelie's Napoleon suffers from none of these!  Look at my photograph of the \\"topless\\" Napoleon: the pastry is flaky, delicate and toothsome, buttery and light.  It is unsweetened, as pastry should be, more the flavor of a croissant than a sweat dessert.  The cream is thick but light, not quite a custard but thicker and more flavorful than a whipped cream, very lightly sweet. Even the icing, which by definition is typically powdered sugar and milk, is sweet like a light glaze rather than cloying like a frosting.  When it is consumed, it leaves you satisfied and yet a little disappointed that the experience is over, rather than wishing you had a pickle to cleanse your pallet.\\n\\nAmelie's specializes in more than just sandwiches and pastry. There are cakes, Creme Brul√©e in several flavors, and macaroons, a treat I've always disliked before I purchased one here (the chocolate cinnamon! Delicious!), as well as locally roasted coffee that is balanced in acidity and flavor.  The total experience of Amelie's is that of a favorite college cafe with the sophistication of French influences, without any if the pretension!

But in a good way! I've never had \\"Detroit\\" pizza but I've had everything from the west coast north to south, and the east coast north to south, with a healthy dose of Chicago thrown in the mix. I've eaten it in italy, loved Portafino's pizza, and can truly say I'm a pizza junkie.\\n\\nSo back to 313. Plain and simple, Really great pizza. I had the class which was smoked pepperoni in the original casing, fresh and creamy tasting mozzarella, and a great crust. Just the right amount of pizza seasonings (oregano/basil), and it came out HOT!!! What makes it different, the sauce on top of the cheese. This was great! The sauce didn't slip off while it was hot and fresh, loved that!. The non-tossed dough was very bready and the outside edges were more like fry-bread navajo style but with a cured metal burn like a great skillet would produce. The sauce was really sweet, not what I'm used to, but I didn't hate it. I almost wanted to add salt, but when I got my first bite of pepperoni it all balanced out.\\n\\nI'll be trying it again soon.\\n\\nThe downsides, if you want lots of seating you pretty much have to go through the bar and sit outside which puts you around lots of smokers, drinkers, etc. This limits your options if you're with your children who love pizza. They have one table themselves, but it's right by the street, lots of passers by staring at you while you eat, homeless dudes asking for change or just watching you eat. That's a little weird. There are parking spaces for the bar a few feet from where you sit, and so there is traffic around you, exhaust fumes, etc...heck, maybe that's part of the Detroit experience. ;)\\n\\nAll in all, the food and service is what matters.

I love brie, but it may have been too rich and heavy for the pizza. Overall, pretty good pizza. If I ever go back, I'd have to try the margherita. \\n\\nThe guy's gnocchi was average. The gnocchi were quite large, maybe 3x the size of regular gnocchi. I thought it had good flavor, but it was a little too dense and heavy. The squash that came with the gnocchi was the only part of dinner that I didn't really like. It tasted watery and bland and had a strange consistency. \\n\\nService was prompt and fine. Nothing to really complain about. \\n\\nOverall, a decent place to grab some pizza and a glass of wine. I just feel like this place needs a little pizzazz in order for it to stand out from the crowd.

The Union House Oysters, which they confidently put their name on, were simply heated up oysters with sad cheese sprinkled on top. The Oysters Rockefeller seemed more promising with a topping of spinach and cheese but lacking any fresh ingredients made the dish as bland as canned spinach. \\n\\nOur main dish, the sauteed seafood medley, was decent. A mixture of seafood within a tomato sauce. Half the seafood was well cooked, the other, including calamari and and mussels, were over cooked and chewy.

We came for lunch on a weekday, and the place didn't seem very busy.\\n\\nWe were greeted by a host who could not be bothered to get up to show us to our table.  She nodded her chin towards a booth and we made our way there.\\n\\nThe booth looked cozy enough, and boy was it cozy.  I guess it's a certain ambiance they're trying to put forward, but the table was about an inch from my body.  The waitress did not greet us for 18 minutes (I happened to glance at my watch when we sat down because I was wondering why there were so few people here during what I assumed would be the lunch rush).  When she did greet us, she took drink orders and ran away, despite our pleas that were in fact ready to order our meal.\\n\\nWe ordered our food, and they came out more or less as expected.  The fisherman's platter, fried clams, and a salad with some seafood cakes (crab cakes and lobster cakes from what I gathered).  The fried food was over-battered and lukewarm by the time it arrived at our table.  The seafood cakes that came with the salad looked like, and tasted like, they had been placed into the oven after being taken out of a box at your local grocery store's frozen foods section.  \\n\\nThe most fun little surprise came when we got our bill.  This restaurant does not give patrons complementary refills on fountain sodas.  Between the three of us, we had maybe 7 or 8 Diet Cokes.  The charge was something like $2 for each one.  Now, I can understand restaurants not giving complementary refills.  No one is entitled a refill, fine.  But the drinks we got were entirely ice and contained maybe 3 ounces of actual soda (and I'm being generous here).  Seriously, $2 for 3 ounces of soda from a fountain, which probably cost the restaurant less than $0.03.  And it's not like they made up for it by having a reasonably priced menu either.  Other restaurants also happen to be nice enough to tell their customers that there are no complementary refills since, being in America, they understand that that is what the norm is in the US.  Apparently, being the oldest restaurant in America does not clue them in to American restaurant norms.\\n\\nWe came out of there vowing to never go again.  Everything about it seems like they were trying to nickel and dime their patrons.  They can save on seafood by making the dishes mostly batter!  They can cram more people by shoving everyone together!  They can have a higher operating margin by charging ridiculous prices for 3 ounces of soda!  In the end, we tipped the waitress about 15% because she wasn't very good (20%-25% is my standard usually), but it would've been much less if we wanted to blame her for the restaurant's pricing policies (but I know, I know, that'd be unfair...).\\n\\nDO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE.  If you're in the mood for seafood, McCormick and Schmick's (which also has a delightful happy hour) is near there, or better yet, go to Legal Seafoods.  The prices are comparable, and you'll DEFINITELY get better food, better service, and not feel like the restaurant is trying to nickel and dime every penny out of its customers.\\n\\nSTAY AWAY!!!"},{"name":"Greeley Avenue Bar & Grill","address":"5421 N Greeley Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"What can you say about a small sports bar, with good food, inexpensive beer and good friends by your side?

The pork was fork tender and cooked perfectly. The crepes also had spaghetti squash, greens and a cream sauce. The one flaw is that is wasn't warm, but I was ok with that. My partner's pot pie was steaming, so I think my crepes sat under a light until the pie was ready. Ah well. The flaw with the pot pie was there wasn't enough gravy (sauce), it was dry. The flavor was there, just not enough sauce. My crepes were the highlight to me. Then dessert, partner had a chocolate torte a la mode, and I had fig bread pudding.

Within a minute or so of that, the waiter came by for my drink order (margarita on the rocks w/salt) and seeing my menu closed asked if I knew what I wanted, and I said \\"Yep:  Chalupas Compuestas, beef, with the rice and beans.\\" With that he dashed off.  \\n\\nTheir salsa is fantastic some nights, other nights it's kinda bland.  Tonight it had just the right zing.   I had started in on putting a dent in that tray of chips when the margarita arrived.  Nicely done.  Good rim of salt, slice of lime, and a cherry for garnish.  Ditched the straw and took a proper gulp with a lipful of the salt.  Freakin' excellent.  Some nights their margaritas kinda suck.  Taste like dish detergent, glass is hot/warm, but not tonight!  Excellent 'rita all around.  Flavors nicely balanced and tasted great.\\n\\nHappily munching my chips and salsa and sippin' the rita, and the waiter brought me a nice tall ice water with lemon (without being asked).  Sweet.  Nice to wash things down with a little water.  \\n\\nFood arrived within less than five minutes.  Seriously fast.  Now, Dario's enchiladas can suck, and suck hard.  Their migas are \\"meh\\" for the most part, but dammit, they do Chalupas Compuestas RIGHT...they've always been good.  The beef spiced beautifully.  The cheese excellently melted before the salad and guac are piled high on top.  Tonight they were exceptional.  And I gotta say:  Theirs are the ONLY chalupas that will actually STAY IN ONE PIECE as you munch them!  No fork necessary.  Pick 'em up and start at the edge and go.  Tonight, everything was balanced...the guac was perfect, the beef was perfect, the rice and beans great.\\n\\nWaiter came by twice to make sure I was happy while I devoured everything.\\n\\nTold my waiter that I've truthfully found the place \\"hit or miss\\" but that overall HE had been terriffic, the margarita was awesome, and the food was just perfect.  He thanked me, face brightening noticeably.

My friend had the Porcini Ravioli, and I had the Coq Au Vin Blanc. I can confidently say this is the absolute best dish I have had while living in Austin, and there was even enough to take home for lunch the next day. I highly recommend trying this if you go here, words do not do it justice. We finished with the bread pudding, which I would say is a shareable size. Everything was under $50 before tip. Servers were attentive and friendly, but not too overbearing. We stayed a bit past closing time, and I did't feel rushed at all, like a true French restaurant! I came in wearing a tank top and jean shorts with my bathing suit underneath, and there were others there dressed pretty casually, but I say this restaurant could go either way! From studying in the morning with a coffee, to throwing on a dress for date night, this is the perfect spot for any occasion.

It can be crowded especially during a soccer game or on weekends. I believe that to be an additional appeal. Dont you want to eat at the most crowded restaurant? Other people must know somthing right? Get your ompa ompa on during Oktoberfest. One of the best smaller celebrations I have seen. Very local loyal neighborhoood patrons. There are Steins and mugs that are there for the regulars and available for purchase. I say go for it become part of the club if you think it will be a regular stop. I pop in every once in a while to see what they have and try to have one or two great beers along with my Schnitzel. Decent prices on everything from the food to the beer. A gem hidden inside and increasingly restaurant zone.  Parking is not alway easy.

Mostly because they stack on the rice like a pile of mountain if you get the rice plates.  Great to come if you have a large crowd so you can share and try out all the dishes.  The pan fried noodles are also really good.  I like the crispy noodles that gets smothered in sauce so the noodles soak up all the goodness.  \\n\\nI had the roast duck rice plate for the first time today and it came with chinese broccoli and some duck juice sauce which was super salty.  The duck had a crispy skin and the meat itself wasn't so bad.  Not the juiciest, but still delicious considering it was only $7.25.

If you're not a believer in \\"bottle aged beer\\", you most likely will be after a tasting here.\\n\\nBeer Quality & Diversity:\\n\\nOn tap all of Hair of the Dog's offerings rate above average to excellent:  Ruth (Pale), Adam (Old Ale), Fred (American Strong Ale), Blue Dot (Double IPA), Doggy Claws (American Barleywine), and Lila (Maibock), are all very good.  A taster flight is a great experience here since every beer is different and top drawer.\\n\\nWhile their \\"on-tap\\" list is great, their bottle aged beer is phenomonal.  The aged Freds, Adams, and Matts are especially unique, and those beers cover a widely varying spectrum of beer types.  The menu gives a pretty good account of what each unique batch will taste like.  An important point of note:  Bottle aged beers must be consumed on-site.\\n\\nInsider Tip:  The aged Adams are some of the best beers I've ever had.  Spring for one.  My personal favorite:  Adam Batch #78--let it warm to the room temperature for the best experience. \\n\\nAmbiance & Service:\\n\\nSet across Morrison Bridge (on the industrial side near the tracks), Hair of the Dog is within striking distance to a couple other areas that have a solid reputation in Portland such as Hopworks, Edelweiss, and Bunk Sandwiches.  The tasting room itself looks like a converted garage. It's open and hipster-rustic (new word). Sound carries here with concrete floors, but table spacing makes it acceptable.\\n\\nThe food situation has improved here recently with some homey options such as mac & cheese, thick sandwiches and decent salads.  The plating is poor and messy. The food remains a bit inconsistent, but passable for a taster room.\\n\\nService? Eh.....kind of the standard laissez-faire Portland service you've come to expect. They'll serve you, probably, assuming there's not something more hip to do.  Sadly with a couple of exceptions most aren't particularly passionate (or knowledgable) about the beer.  There is certainly a warm feeling missing that typically resides at the bar in small breweries filled with beer loving staff.  The patrons on the other hand, most are actually a lot of fun and FAR more excited and knowledgeable about the beer.\\n\\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\nThere are four things keeping Hair of the Dog away from a clear five star rating, and I'll list 'em in order:\\n\\n1.  Average and/or borderline unfriendly service\\n2.  Carbonation consistency issues\\n3.  Pricing--especially on bottled aged beer and flights\\n4.  Lack of TV for sporting events\\n\\nAs far as the quality and scope of the beer goes--absolutely fantastic.  Any west coast beer drinker should keep a couple of their brews in the cellar.\\n\\n-AC"},{"name":"Pizzeria Locale","address":"1730 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"The key takeaway here is that pizzeria locale focuses on high quality, true to Napoli ingredients.

We walked the 1.8 miles or so to get there the first time, and it was well worth it.  I had the Foul Play, their take on chicken and waffles.  It was good, but what was different about it was the fruit compote that accompanied the dish, whiskey peach to be exact.  I also remember the waffle having a strong hint of spice to it, apple cinnamon perhaps?  It was good and certainly worth a try.  The last time we went, I think I had a simple bacon and egg breakfast with hashbrowns, all of which was tasty.  In fact, I think the bacon they served may have been the best bacon I've ever tasted.  It was greasy and a piece or two could have been a little more crisp, but the flavor overshadowed any other lackluster bacon qualities.  We did have to wait about 15-20 minutes on the last visit, which I believe was the 4th of July.  It was during the week though, and the standard weekend brunch menu was not offered, so, no chicken and waffle for me on round two, but that was fine.  I would really like to return for a lunch item and see how that is.  Others have mentioned their homemade jam, which is totally worth the additional 25 cents they charge for it.

First class burgers, but a bit over priced. We were intrigued by the Grindhouse menu. It was more interesting. So we drove over there early on a sunny Saturday afternoon.  Although we were lucky we noticed parking is obviously a problem at this popular location.\\n\\nAfter placing your order at the counter you'll receive a number to place on your table. If the store is very busy it may take a while to for your order to arrive. You can use that time to drink your draft beer (yay!) and observe the 'pseudo hipsters' in their calculatedly disheveled, expensive labeled attire. Amazing how 6 or 8 people at a table could managed to conform to cartoon-y caricatures with similar haircuts, glasses, shirts and jeans legs rolled up like little boys whose moms know they'll 'grow into them'. On the Saturday noon when we visited Grindhouse was full of these media/ advertising types. \\n\\nBut the food at Grindhouse is GENUINE. *smile*  Really, really good in fact. My friend and had been seriously craving BEEF.  We each had ordered double burgers. Singles would have been 4 ounce patties, pre-cooked weight. My buddy ordered the Apache burger with roasted green chiles and pepper jack cheese, I ordered the Grindhouse special. Because of the typical 'American style' condiment list including lettuce, onions, special sauce, pickles, I hadn't noticed tomatoes weren't included. A friendly server brought me a couple of tomato slices.\\n\\nBTW, we noticed a couple of guys were gobbling burgers with 3 patties! That made their burgers about 6 inches high. They shmushed them down a little in order to get them into their gaping mouths! The hot juicy burgers were so good I could almost understand why they risked unhinging their jawbones!\\n\\nGrindhouse's burger is made from chuck and brisket. The Grindhouse burger (which they seem to cook to a perfect medium) has a flavour slightly reminiscent of roast beef, rich and yummy. OTOH, the burgers at Farm Burger taste very much like steak. The buns at Farm Burgers are better, less starchy tasting than the Grindhouse's potato buns.\\n\\nAll in all, I preferred the Grindhouse restaurant's decor as it is less 'cold' than Farm Burger's Piedmont/Tower place location. Grindhouse is less expensive, the menu is more diverse and I think you get more for your money.  I wish the owners of Grindhouse would open a restaurant in the North Buckhead/Wieuca Road area. Sure, there's a Five Guys location nearby but their offerings are extremely limited (no beers or wine) and the burgers are flavorless, overcooked and GREASY!\\n\\nIn the meantime, we are looking forward to our next visit to Grindhouse Killer Burgers. I'm looking forward to trying some of the sides. The salads and chili looked great!"},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"One of my absolute FAVORITE places to eat in ATL...the brisket is the house special and it's amongst the BEST I have EVER had...get the brisket...we always have a great experience here and will be back again and again!!...BOOM!!"},{"name":"Top of the Hub","address":"800 Boylston St, Ste 52","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I love this place.

But the new place has its own charms and I spend my work day at the counter here on a regular basis. The vegetarian/vegan food options are always excellent and I order from all over the menu and am rarely disappointed. My typical summer order is the tofu broccoli salad...delish...with a dual dressing mix suggested by super server Jacob awhile back...the ginger miso and citrus vinaigrette...I lurve it. And the tofu scramble tacos have long been a favorite...I wish I had the secret of their scramble to replicate at home. They taught me the virtues of nutritional yeast. So much yum. Even more than the food and eclectic ambiance, I want to shout out to the staff...some days I sit at the bar for hours working and other days I rush in for a cold brew (stellar) and sammich on the run. Either way, they always take great care! If I am there for hours, they constantly supply refills, check in, and don't give me angry looks for taking up prime space.

He's blending both Southern and Asian flavors into something beyond fusion. \\nIt's an unassuming little place that, even once you're inside, doesn't give away it's hidden pleasures at first glance. Seating is at a premium given the handful of tables inside. Our party of 9 was sat at the long table in the center of the very narrow dining room and while elbow room may be a bit tight I feel like it only makes the experience that much more enjoyable since you'll likely be sharing and passing what comes to the table.\\n\\nWe started with cocktails. I had the Hugo's Aviator which was a little citrusy and a little floral. The majority of our table tried Calvin's evening special which was similar to a Stoli Doli but even better. They have a limited but nice wine list and a full bar...so after a little liquid lubrication you can queue the onslaught of tasty delights. \\n\\nOur server, who was wonderful, helped us wade through the small plates menu and we decided on the Duck Rolls with Hoisin sauce, the Basil Rolls in a rice wrapper with a curry dip, the Lobster Wontons with caviar (which I didn't get to taste sadly), Fried Goat Cheese served resting on an onion ring, and lastly the Lobster Mac n' Cheese.\\nI can say that the Duck Rolls were fantastic...full of depth and I didn't find them greasy at all...with the hoisin they were near perfect. The Basil rolls were fragrant and herbaceous, and a really nice option for someone wanting to keep the meal light. I would recommend eating them with your hands as they seemed to explode into a salad on your plate when cut in half...you'll see what I mean ; )  \\nI liked the goat cheese as well. It reminded me of a Faberge egg in size and shape melding kale mashed potatoes and chevre together, covered in panko, fried crispy and served upright resting atop a very crispy onion ring with a mustard curry dip.\\n\\nFor my entr√©e I tried the PC's Fried Chicken laid over the Lobster Mac with veggies. If you want to kill two birds with one stone this is your dish. You get two amazing pieces of southern fried chicken with a dash of curry and another flavor profile distinctly Asian but hard to discern all alongside heavenly Lobster Mac that was cheesy and loaded with chunks of lobster. My second choice was the Crispy Beef but the PC's was our server's recommendation and it was well placed. \\nI also had a chance to try the Massaman Chicken Curry, which I thought was fantastic, and the Stir Fry that evening was also loaded with good stuff and packed with flavor.\\n\\nFor dessert, a griddle seared vanilla pound cake served with a coconut ice cream and then a pumpkin cheesecake that was silky and smooth. Lastly, they're doing espresso right even down to the crema on top.
