They're trained on how to assemble a sandwich, but there's no sense of urgency. Their customer service leaves you wishing you just had a Subway there because then you'd get to see your goddamn sandwich being made. 2 out of 3 times when I grab my lunch from Which Wich, something goes wrong like a missing ingredient or the fact that they recycle used paper bags (that hold your sandwich), which is confusing because my name isn't Joey nor did I order the philly cheesesteak, so...they should probably stop doing that. Also, it's unsanitary & confusing. Of course, when they do something wrong, they don't really apologize to you. When I was missing an ingredient that cost me extra, one of the staff just stared at me blankly, unapologetically asking, \\"what do you want me to do about it? Do you want me to make you a new one...or...?\\" Yes, let me wait another 15 minutes for you to make me a new one because your slow asses can't put together a sandwich fast enough. NO, just plop on the missing ingredient & apologize on behalf of your staff who made a simple mistake. Like I said, at least at Subway, you can see your sandwich being made so you know it's exactly how you want it. \\n\\nI kind of wish they had some sort of sesame dressing, but anyway, the point is: not the greatest place, but great if you work at Assembly because they have an app for you to order your food. They take such a long time to make anything though & the quality of the ingredients are equivalent to Subway.

Yes, please!).\\nThis isn't your standard table-service, fixed-menu Red Robin-style burger and beer joint. It's more like the way that Irish pubs are in Ireland; you order your drinks at the bar, and your food from a little window in the kitchen, and pay as you go. They call your name when your food is ready so that you can come collect it and return to your table or stool to enjoy your haul. This allows them to keep prices low because they don't have to pay a lot of extra staff members to run around like chickens with their heads cut off just to make sure everyone's served on busy nights, and gives you a rare opportunity to interact not only with the girl pouring your pint, but the guy grilling your burger or frying your Rocky Mountain Oysters, as well.\\nIs the burger the best in the world I've ever had? Well, no. But they're hearty, and delicious, and you can afford three of them for the price you'd likely pay for the Best Burger In The World anyway, so there's no shortage of food (and that figure includes three beers during their Hungry Student Special) for the price. The burgers are good-sized, so you won't actually need three of them, but the value cannot be underestimated. They have a good selection of fried sides and other dishes as well (anyone that serves Rocky Mountain Oysters is already top-notch in my book), so there's a good variety of tastes.\\nThe service is friendly, if somewhat bare-bones, but the lower staff-to-guest ratio is not a detractor. It's part of what makes the Dark Horse special, from the friendly interaction to how it impacts their overhead and thus, the price you pay for your beer and food.\\nThe beer selection is good, and they've got a full bar as well, so you can give yourself a good excuse to eat some good food and help absorb the alcohol.

Hello kiddies, it's your favorite fun loving Mr. Smidgens here! \\n\\nYes, I finally made it to Franklin BBQ and when my coworkers and I decided on going we watched the clip of \\"Hitler doesn't get Franklin 's BBQ\\". \\nWell that was at 10 am! The three of us looked at each other and they asked me if we should leave at 10:30 am. I stood up grabbed my keys and said,\\"We leave now!\\". Like Mario Andretti I raced through traffic on IH-35 and exited the 11th street exit. We pull up next to Franklin and the line is there. I drop off my coworkers and they get in line. It is 10:30 on the dot! \\n\\nI park up the street and on my way down the hill to the line 2 guys jump out of their car and race to the line. I laugh and stroll past them to my buddies. We start the clock. As we stand in the sun we are excited to finally try this BBQ for the first time. Then as quickly as the line is growing there she is! The girl who tells you whether or not you have made the cut off for the amount of BBQ they have. TA..TA..TAAAAAAA!!! She strolls past us as we exhale...whew! \\n\\nWe made the cut by 10 peeps. The girl with the tats goes back up the stairs with her clip board and comes back with a bin full of ice cold beer and sodas. After baking in the sun for 15 minutes an ice cold Big Red sounds refreshing. I have not had one since I was a child. Ahhhhhh....so good once it touches your lips! 11 am!!! The doors open! We move five feet. So exciting we tell each other. Then the Big Red is gone and it's hot. Steamy hot. We are hungry and we are hot and sweaty. We move into the shade. Yea!!! We are getting anxious and it has been an hour. Yikes! We move back in the sun. So hot. Milk was a bad choice....we are getting irritated at the people we see just stroll inside. You cannot place an order and pick it up to eat inside. \\n\\nWe try to figure out what the heck they are doing and then realize that they had 1 friend who decided to come in early and get food for everyone whilst they just stroll past the line and make us all angry that we did not think of that! That is one hell of a friend! \\n\\nAhhhh...we get back in the shade again. Small victories that we don't take lightly. It's been an hour and a half now. I am trying to calm my buddies. They have that look in their eyes. You know that look. The one where they are watching other people with their food and they could snap at any moment and grab someones meat from their plate with no regrets. Yeah, that look. \\n\\nWe are inside the building now and we still have another 30 minutes before we hit the counter. We are no longer baking in the sun but there was no air flow. With sweat dripping down my face and the counter only a few yards away the excitement was back! \\n\\nAfter 2 hours and 5 minutes it was finally my turn. I am so happy to be at the counter. I ask with a grin, \\"How much BBQ do you have left?\\". \\nHe smiles back and says plenty! Awe yeah! I ask for a pound of lean brisket and a pound of pulled pork. It all looks so good. After getting all of my pickles and napkins we take a seat. I grab a soda. I go for the blueberry soda and think to myself\\"This is going to go well with my BBQ.\\". \\n\\nI sit back down with my buddies and we are quiet and happy. The brisket was excellent! I tried it on its own first. Lean and moist all at once. The rub is definitely salty but mouth watering. No real need for sauce. The pulled pork was succulent. I added some of the spicy sauce and that made it even better. Washing it down with the blueberry soda was the right choice!\\n\\nWe left Franklin's 3 hours later after riding an emotional roller coaster, satisfied and thankful for the experience.

We started off with the Calamari (we have this thing about always ordering Calamari when we visit a new restaurant).  While it was not the best we've ever had, it was good.  It was fried nicely while still maintaining the calamari's freshness and texture.  It wasn't rubbery like most places and the side of citrus mayo was a solid compliment to the appetizer.  Onto the main course!  \\n\\nUpon an incredible recommendation, I decided to try the \\"Lamb Pasanda\\" which was Boneless Lamb Cooked In A Cashew & Pistachios Sauce. It was incredible and I enjoyed every bite!

They were able to accommodate a group of 25 people on multiple tables which is what I wanted so there could be mingling since I am not a fan of the long \\"last supper\\" style seating. \\n\\nThe service was top notch. We had three servers, Stephanie, Amber and Andres, handling our party. They were able to keep everyone hydrated and satiated on multiple checks without missing a beat. And we were moving around a lot. They were friendly, courteous and on top of things. \\n\\nLet's talk about the food and beverages:\\nI ordered the tuna tataki, the pork gyoza and the pineapple cream cheese wontons. The tuna tataki was good, but not the best I have had. It was slightly fishier than I would have liked. The presentation was beautiful and it did go, as my friends seemed to like it more than me. I loved the gyoza and the unique wontons. The vegetable tempura was crisp, perfectly cooked, and had sweet potatoes in it. I tried a couple of the rolls (although I do not remember what they were) and they were all fresh and delicious. My only regret is that I did not see the Las Vegas roll until I saw photos posted on Facebook, and wished I had tried that, as it looked delicious and I heard it was the best thing of the night.  - That's what I get for talking and drinking. \\n\\nThe happy hour value was great and they had items to suit all. I opted to order Mumm Brut Prestige by the bottle - as it was just as good a deal as the happy hour Lunetta Prosecco and I preferred it to the Prosecco. They have three sparkling wines on the menu, the third being a split of Chardon Brut Classic. Only the Prosecco is offered by the glass. The wine list is mostly California covering sparkling, sweet, and red/white light, medium and full bodied selections (2-5 selections of each). There are some other standard selections including both New Zealand & Chile Sauvignon Blancs, an Argentina Malbec, both Prosecco and Moscato from Italy, and both a Resiling and Merlot from Washington. The full wine list can be found here: http://www.rasushi.com/menus/wine\\n\\nThey did have a clever Halloween menu with \\"boo bite specials\\" like black bat teriyaki wings, zombie and black widow rolls and wicked shrimp. But the drink offering of Witches Brew was a table hit. I ordered a punch bowl of it (think extra-large rounded goblet) with straws for everyone and we took turns trying this hurricane like concoction of Svedka vodka, Southern Comfort, Disaronno, cold sake and tropical juices with a Jim Beam bourbon float and fog. It was potent and tasty. It's a good thing we all shared one ;). \\n\\nAbove and beyond: \\nWe brought in three birthday cakes and they not only served them for us, but did not charge us a fee. You do not see that at many restaurants. \\n\\nAll in all, I had a fabulous birthday happy hour on their lovely rooftop patio with quality food and great service. I will be back.

I had a blended chai latte, which I was slightly disappointed in -- I think I was expecting a chai-flavoured milkshake, but it was only $3.50 for a medium, so not a huge loss.  \\n\\nThere is free wireless and outlets a plenty.

We ordered the hot combination appetizer sampler that consisted of salty bacon wrapped prawns, lemony (apply a heavy squeeze, it makes it better) lobster bites and a scrumptious crab dip. Get the large order of crab dip! You will not be disappointed, yum! We ordered the crawfish and prawn special. The dish was an interesting and different type of meal. The prawns were drenched in an overly buttery and creamy sauce. We got full after a few bites because the sauce was so heavy... and we cleaned out the crap dip earlier... so that may have something to do with us being full so fast... just don't forget the crab dip! The presentation of the meal was fun with saucy prawns on one side, a mini mountain of rice on the other with a whole crawfish balancing on top of the grainy mountain. We ended the meal with a slice of freshly made apple pie with a sweet and sticky caramel drizzle. The dessert was heavy as well which was good because you left full and in need of nap. I think all restaurants should aim for that. Thank you, Jake for a wonderful lunch and suitable seafood!

I went there mid-week around 7pm, and it took about an hour to get in and seated. The place is only open for dinner. Water cups were passed out to those waiting to get in. Guests kept coming out, raving about how great it was and worth the wait. Once inside, you can order a drink while in line before placing your order. There's limited seating. A few tables to fit 2-4 people, a large community table, a smaller community table and bar seating. Someone seats you when there's an available spot once you place the order and brings you food when it's ready.\\n\\nThere are three ramen dishes to choose from, and you can customize it with various toppings and pastes for extra $. The ramen dishes aren't that big, but that's because you're supposed to order more noodles later (extra $1.50), so the noodles don't get too soggy. I got the #2 Tonkotsu Sho-Yu. The ramen was thin and tasty. The broth was flavorful (heavy on the garlic) and not too greasy. It came with one marinated egg, which I loved since the yolk was melted and bright yellow like the kind I've eaten in Japan. I'm not a huge fan of pork, but I did like the one small slice of pork belly. Overall, I did like the ramen, but wasn't in love with it. Maybe I'll add toppings/pastes to spice it up next time. \\n\\nAlso, I tried the Munchie Katsu Slider. It was like eating a beef/onion meat loaf with a cabbage slaw. Cold potato salad with veggies was added to the side. I found it tasty, but don't think it's for every one. \\n\\nThe customer service was very good, especially considering how busy it was.

She catered to our every needs and was very sociable. We arrived at 9:20pm Friday. No wait, ordered and food cane within 25 minutes. Keisha had to get us extra sauce because our food bag only had a little. I ordered 1 lb crab legs and 1/2 shrimp with 1 lb of sausage. The difference from the other place is that the flavor of the season is embedded in the meat. The sausages are not an extra $5 per lb, they are already in the bag with plenty corn and potatoes.

It's not for everybody, and let me say this: It definitely attracts an older crowd, you don't see a lot of college kids in here. I'm only 37 years old and when I go in for lunch I'm easily the youngest person in there. But let me also say this: I LOVE this place. First off, I don't know how the service is in the main restaurant, I always sit at the bar. The bartenders are SUPER nice, attentive and friendly. They know me by name. There's a great crowd of regulars who are in here every day and they are great people. This place makes a MEAN drink.  Watch your bartender pour a mixed drink with vodka for example: there's so much vodka in the glass that you're wondering where she's gonna put the mix!  The food is very tasty and it's a great, great value. On Tuesday you can get a HUGE piece of prime rib for 15.95, and it's delicious.  I don't think I've had anything here I didn't like. Don't get me wrong, it's not fine dining in boston, but their burgers are delicious, and so is their seafood and it's FRESH.  Another thing that always blows me away is the selection of great food. Every day, they have a different specials menu with delicious food at a great price, in addition to their HUGE regular menu, which is full of pasta, sandwiches, dinners and seafood.  I absolutely love this place.  I was at a restaurant the other day, and they wanted to charge me 8 dollars for a salad, and then an extra 12 DOLLARS to add chicken to it. Are you kidding me? At the Century House I can get a huge Greek salad LOADED with buffalo chicken tenders or grilled chicken for like 12.95. It's a no brainer.

I'm stoked about writing 800 reviews but I'm a little bummed.  I'm sad because I'm not getting my Elite badge, which would've been 9 years straight. I won't get into all of that but yeah, kind of a bummer.  Now to the real review!  I've NEVER had Tatsu-Ya until last week!  I've kind of put it off because the idea of standing in line for a bowl of soup reminds me of Seinfeld.  I love Seinfeld but standing in line for soup just doesn't appeal to me.  So we go and only wait for maybe 10 minutes before placing our orders.  I've always been a staunch Michi loyalist and I know people who love Michi and people who love Tatsu-Ya.  Well, here is my takeaway.  We had the brussels sprouts, salad, she had the OG and I had the miso hot.  The salad was just OK. It was bright but just alright. Wouldn't suggest it.  The brussels were pretty good but not the best I've had.  My date was kind of let down with her ramen.  I'm pretty sure the OG is just straight up pork broth with no tare.  That means, no flavor enhancers.  She also thought her pork belly was more fat than meat and it wasn't rendered out all the way.  My ramen, the Miso Hot was FANTASTIC!  For those of you who want to know the differences between Michi and Tatsuya, here it is.  Michi has much larger portions and the prices seem cheaper than Tatsuya.  My bowl is basically the same as the Sapporo at Michi.  The portion is a lot smaller here, the noodles are a lot lighter and more thin.  You don't get a choice of broth thickness and the broth here is pretty stout.  I LOVED IT.  The bowl I had came with ground pork and not belly, I'm OK with that.  All bowls here come with half of an ajitama, I gave mine to my date, I don't like boiled eggs :P.  The spicy bomb in here was AMAZING.  So much depth of flavor on top of it being spicy.  I'm pretty sure that this bowl of ramen is one of the top 5 soups I've ever had.

We've become mighty close over the past year and a half, haven't we?  I was first introduced to this place when it was over in Somerville and within walking distance of my old apartment.  My friends and I would order our respective \\"usuals\\" on Friday nights and watch movies while we chowed down on what was, for my money, some quality Americanized Chinese food.  I always thought that the pork fried rice was all right but nothing special (it could tend toward the greasy and tasteless end of the rice spectrum), but the main dishes always made up for it: sesame chicken = yum with good sauce, orange chicken = spicy and sweet, beef teriyaki = tender enough to slide off the stick, spare ribs = also tender and delicious, spring rolls = crispy but a bit greasy for having only veggies in them, and egg rolls = also greasy, but in a glorious egg-rolly way.  I always wound up feeling like I was going to burst because the portions were generous and the food was scrumptious enough that it inspired me to eat my fill.  If I had leftovers, I always finished them the next day.\\n\\nI ordered from their new Brighton location for the first time this week, and it was a bit of a different experience.  On the positive side, the guy on the phone was very polite and honest about the delivery time (30 minutes), and the delivery driver was also really cool.  As for the food itself... well, to be fair, it was still decent (I got my usual sesame chicken with PFR and beef teriyaki), but it did not seem to be as fresh as it was at the old place.  The chicken felt like it'd gotten a *little* too crispy and the rice was a *little* too dry, though the beef was absolutely wonderful and cooked perfectly.  Also, the serving of chicken was quite a bit smaller than it tended to be at the old location, which was actually fine because I would up only eating about half of it... and I threw the rest out.  I was not even inspired to keep the leftovers, and that makes me sad.  \\n\\nI'll probably order from here again if I have a serious hankering for Chinese, but I think I'll also start to shop different takeout/delivery locations as well.

The Octopus (usually a great dish if prepared correctly) was so chewy and had a slimy skin on the outside that it was inedible. I actually had a bite of the end that was the most cooked. My biggest problem was the way we were treated when we asked for the check. Our barmaid/server never came back to the bar, and in her place was a man who promptly handed us the check. We noticed that the Octopus entree had not been removed from the bill. We told him about our issue and he responded by saying that I had eaten most of it. (2 bites)not even close to a 1/3 of the portion and that they would not remove it from the check and we needed to pay for it. He stated that he was the manager and he called the owner an the owner would not take the item off the check. So here we are in utter disbelief that an item a patron felt was not prepared correctly or didn't like would not be removed from the check. We told him that we were not paying for it and he threatened to call the police if we didn't. After a brief argument in front of other customers the manager agreed to only charge us for half of the entree. We promptly paid and left. \\n\\nI would never return to this restaurant and will tell everyone I know to avoid it at all costs. \\n\\nI have never been to a restaurant where if a customer didn't care for or the kitchen mispreppared an entree that it was not removed from the check and offered something in its place."},{"name":"903 Mills Market","address":"903 S Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Really enjoyed 903 Mills Market!

The texture is very chewy, but it was very fresh and flavorful.\\n\\nThe ceviche I ordered was just average. I thought it could use some extra flavor to it, and the shrimp and scallop was a little more tough than expected. The serving size however is very generous! My drink was pretty good, but again nothing out of the ordinary.\\n\\nAfter dinner, we all ordered the beachcomber kahuna bowl, which was very strong. The absinthe really masks the taste of the drink overall, but I think it's a great deal for a giant drink to share with the table.\\n\\nI wish I could give an additional half star because the service was incredible.

The staff were super friendly and sat right at the booth with us to take our order, and were very proud of their fresh quality ingredients, and spoke to us at length about it. I really liked that they had a page dedicated and clearly marked with the gluten free options.  They also have a vegan cheese option, which we did try because of the detox.  I ordered the mighty meat, and my friend put together her own pizza with some of her fave toping choices.  \\n\\nFirst of all, the crust was better than average for gluten free, but not as good as some other favorites I have found in Austin.  As always, it is thin crust, had a OK nutty flavor, stayed together, but was not completely crisp.  There was still a hint of gooey on the inside.  The vegan cheese to give it credit at least melted, and was tolerable.  I am just not a fan of vegan cheese to begin with. The meat was delicious, but what stood out was the delicious sauce.  This pizza didn't need cheese, the sauce was great!  We ordered a separate dish of the sauce, which they served heated up, just to dip our crust in.  Probably one of the best pizza sauces I have had in awhile."},{"name":"Hey Cupcake!","address":"5530 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"If you want cupcakes in Austin this is the place to go.

On the positive side, I am in love with the food here! I'm so happy I found this place for the food specifically. The only reason I had to give it lower stars is for the staff. I don't know if the following situation occurred because the server assumed that we weren't going to spend money. We ended up spending over $100 between the two of us. I wanted to order 3 things off of the normal menu and my friend wanted to try the Portland dining month special and the server strictly wouldn't allow it. What if my friend had gone to the restaurant by herself? Was she not allowed to participate in Portland dining month because she's single? It seemed purposely discriminating. I go to restaurants all the time by myself so I was definitely put off by that. I didn't want to eat anything off of the Portland dining menu but the server said it was absolutely required if my friend ordered it. She also kept saying it was family style repeatedly and I tried to explain I didn't want anything off of the Portland dining menu plus I have food allergies so \\"family style\\" wasn't going to be an option for me anyway on that menu. It's like she didn't hear me at all. I wasn't going to share anything off of that menu. My friend ended up being forced to order off of the normal menu. So I'm torn because the food was amazing so I hope the chef is highly commended but the staff really made me feel very unwelcome. I pictured this restaurant as a place I could comfortably come by myself, order some wine, great food and read a book but now I'm not sure. It clearly discriminates against single people during dining month. I've eaten at plenty of other restaurants by myself during dining month and outside of dining month and have never experienced this strong of an unwelcoming feeling.

We chose to sit in the bar area since it's open seating, and took a booth by the window.\\n\\nService was a little slow--bars usually are so it wasn't a huge deal, but considering the price point it was disappointing.

Even the Low Bar uses the good kind, and it's a dive.\\n\\nWe ordered the calamari and mezza apps, and the crab mac & cheese entr√©e. I'd heard good things about the mezza and was looking forward to it, but what arrived looked like a basic snack tray from a block party. Store-bought pita, hummus, and feta, complete with some plastic bag shards sticking to the bottom of the pita bread. There was an olive spread as well which may have been homemade--I say that because there were ground-up pits in multiple bites I had. It's possible they added those for show though! It tasted good, but it was the third disappointment, and I wasn't charmed. The calamari actually tasted great, but the amount of dipping sauce was ridiculously small, and the squid was cold.\\n\\nThe crab mac and cheese was beautiful, but it was $25 and I couldn't see any crab in it. It was topped with chopped tomatoes as a garnish, which I think should have been some lump crab meat for the price point. The cheese sauce was creamy and rich, with lots of bacon pieces (I assume to make up for the lack of crab). My husband didn't understand why I was so disappointed in it until the bill came. He said, \\"For $15 I thought it was amazing! For $25 I hate it.\\" That makes four disappointments, if you're keeping track.\\n\\nOur server was super nice, and the view was beautiful.

This restaurant represents the true meaning of Texas, turning an average situation into something amazing through hard work. Brisket is not the rolls Royce cut of the cow, yet they are able to turn it into something so amazing. \\nI am usually not ok with waiting 3 hours for a meal but franklin barbeque is something that I find is worth waiting an entire day for. Even when they tell you they're out of turkey, don't freak out, if there's brisket, everything will be ok. The side dishes ain't bad either and boy was that barbeque sauce amazing. \\nUltimately, I'd give this place 10 stars if I could.

It just falls apart, and it is packed with flavor. When people go nuts for Franklin's, it's the brisket that they're talking about - it really is that fantastic.\\n\\nThe sausage is pretty good, it's juicy, but in my opinion, there's no beating Lockhart sausage. Franklin's is still worth trying though. I do enjoy their sides - the mustard-y potato salad is a great compliment to the rich meat, as is the slightly vinegar-y coleslaw. The beans are standard pinto beans - about the same as you'd get most places. I do like the simple flavor of the sauce, but this meat really doesn't even need it.\\n\\nAs much as I love the brisket, the whole idea of waiting in that line is insane to me, when I can get comparable barbecue in Lockhart or Elgin... but I will happily look forward to getting to eat Franklin's when I get the chance."},{"name":"La Moule","address":"2500 SE Clinton St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Came here for happy hour- pretty great offerings for the $.

The meat is so juicy and tender, and the batter is just right -- no greasy fingers or extra breading. I opted for the chicken salad instead of the fried chicken entree.

I was a bit skeptical about the dressing but it goes SO well with the chicken. \\n\\nThe servers at SCK are so kind and attentive.

I think the one thing I would've liked is if they had jam instead of butter. Honestly, I could have filled up on this alone. These little drop biscuits are so warm and flaky. Slather on some butter and before you know it, you're three biscuits in! I'm generally not a fan of corn bread but I'm glad I tried these.

The texture and flavor was fresh and delicious. Then I had the margarita pizza which was pretty perfect - they have their own brick oven that they cook their pizzas in so I figured, correctly, that was the perfect option and I saw a lot of other tables getting just that.

Hands down...best BBQ in Atlanta...!!! After a long and very cold day of sightseeing, we needed some down-right Southern food to feed the body and soul; and by accident, we found Fox Bros. and it didn't disappoint...!! \\n\\nThe place isn't very big and parking is definitely at a premium so the saying \\"patience is a virtue\\" must be applied at all cost to have some deliciousness. The wait time to be seated was about an hour (some people's wait time after us was longer..) and there's really no inside waiting area so one's left being in the staff's way; and you're so close to the kitchen and pick up window, that you can see how your food will be prepared and all the different flavors coming out of the kitchen will definitely open up more of an appetite.  \\n\\nOnce we sat, Lizzy took our order. She was friendly and welcoming. Our food came out literally 5 minutes later...impressive and so welcoming after such a long wait. I ordered - the Smoked Chicken Plate (A half smoked chicken. $14) and I've never had anything like it. The chicken was tender, flavorful and its juiciness was on a league of its own. I had it with baked beans and fries and both were cooked to perfection. My husband ordered - Pulled Pork Plate ($14) and he stated that it was the best he's ever had; and given his discriminating taste buds, this was a huge compliment..! He told me that it was \\"delicious, fresh and very meaty\\". Both plates were big enough to share but gluttony took the best of us...'cause we didn't..! As if all this food and a \\"moment on the lips forever on the hips\\" wasn't enough, we needed to bring it home and order the coconut cream pie and it was a sweet heaven delight. From the thick graham cracker bottom to the coconut flakes...it tasted homemade and absolutely decadent...! A must try and for about $6, you can't beat it. If you're a red wine lover, they'll get you there since it's $10 a glass that seems to have a 5oz or so pour; bit over priced for the quantity and quality; it should probably be priced at around $7. \\n\\nAll in all - service was great, food-to-table promptness was impressive, quality of food bar none excellent and price point, excluding wine, was competitive. I don't give it a 5-star rating, unfortunately, due to the long wait and overpriced wine. If you can overlook that like I did, you won't regret the Fox Bros. experience..!

Okay, not a problem, we cozied up next another couple sitting and waited to order drinks. Side note, the view is gorgeous and we got there right at sunset so I can see how sitting at a table by the window or on the patio would really be lovely. Our server greeted us, got drinks started, and recommended some dishes. We decided to start with calamari. While we waited for our appetizer it became increasingly difficult to ignore the bro's across from us and the young woman in their group with the high pitched, nasal-y voice. The guy next to us was telling his date \\"how stupid Mary was,\\" it was all very distracting from what was supposed to be a nice, romantic dinner before the symphony. The calamari arrived and I was rather surprised to see it was served stuffed in what looked like a miniature fryer basket that was placed on top of a plate. Why? Fried foods need room to reduce the likelihood of sweating. I'm not a chef, never have been but this is just cooking basics 101. The calamari tasted decent but because it was so tightly packed it got all sweaty and the coating fell off. We hadn't quite finished out appetizers when my boyfriend asked what I wanted for an entree. I told him I just didn't think I could hack another minute of 9021-bro, or hearing about stupid Mary.

After reviewing the YELP reviews, I had a great opportunity to go for dinner on a Monday evening.  YELP says they were closed only on Sunday so I was set for my Monday dinner.  I drive there on Monday night and: CLOSED!  Ugh.\\n\\nI was able to rearrange my schedule on Tuesday and visit them then.  I am glad I did.  I sat at the bar, and Chuck the Bartender was my Server.  I got the Lobster Ravioli appetizer and the Cioppino.  The food was very good and Chuck was awesome.  In this day and age of so many awful service experiences, it was nice to stumble upon a place like Tony's were things just clicked.  So, the food and service was great, and when the bill comes, it turns out to be less than many of the sub par chains that I sometime visit.\\n\\nI would have probably rated Tony's 5 Stars had the hours on YELP not been incorrect.

The manager came by, and though it was loud on the patio and couldn't hear some words here and there, he did thank us for dining and choosing this location as it was our first time here. \\n\\n[Food Highlights]:\\n\\nTable side cornbread and biscuits - I think I would prefer the cornbread over their biscuits. Though the apple butter, I think that's what it was, did help a bit for the biscuits. But I believe the cornbread is the winner with a spread of the room temperature butter. \\n\\nFried green tomatoes - Wow, these are the best I've had in quite sometime. I think the thin layer of goat cheese just brings it all together quite well. The crunchy texture of the fried batter and the slight tart of the green tomatoes. I would definitely recommend this. \\n\\nShe-crab soup - Slightly salty on the mid tones and finishing. It's very creamy and filling. Even more so if you dip some of the biscuit. Not the best I've had. It's ok to put it simply.\\n\\nShrimp and grits - Tastes like... a more cajun style. The grits weren't as creamy as some other brunch spots. But I do give them praise for serving it in a different manner. I just wasn't impressed by the accompanying sauce. Joy's cafe still has the top spot for their version to me, then La Petite Marche coming in a close second. \\n\\nSpringer Mountain Farms Fried Chicken - I think I should have ordered it as chicken and waffles. Our neighbors order looked huge when it was brought out to their table. The fried chicken is actually very good. Moist while crispy, crunchy battered skin. Seasoned well, without being overly salty. My foodie friend tore up the collard greens. But I wasn't really impressed with the potatoes. Order it as waffle chickens and you won't be disappointed. \\n\\n[Total Bill w/ Tip & Tax]:\\n$60 something w tax. \\n\\n{Summary}:\\nFood venturing with a friend and fiending for some brunch, we settled on South City Kitchen's midtown location as we could stop by Paolos later for dessert. I think majority of what we ordered was ok. Though I probably might just try their other location if I'm hankering for brunch. At least you can walk it off and scout out for a dessert spot down the road. I wish I could just give 3.5 stars, because this is what I felt this place earns so far."},{"name":"Flat Patties","address":"33 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"I normally don't make any yelp post.

A Key Lime Cream Ale isn't my typical choice of beer but this was so damn good and refreshing. \\n\\nI came on American Beer week so their special release for that day was the Hop Suck'n Slut, a Double IPA that I thoroughly enjoyed. But my overall favorite was the KoKo Dragon Bourbon Wood Aged Stout. The very kind gentleman behind the bar kept me company and we talked about beer. I learned that they age their stout with wood spirals rather than the barrel aging process. Which I really loved the more natural wood flavor rather than the big in your face flavor. He told me about all their past events and future event ideas that sounded really amazing. They host homebrew competitions, a chili cook off using their beers and have a lot of musicians playing throughout the week.\\n\\nI'll just quote their about page because it's a perfect description of their beers, they are \\"big, bold and full of flavor, yet subtle and distinct.\\" If you're in the area, you should definitely give them a try."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing.

We ordered five to split: the country-fried rabbit, the clams, the corn pancakes (w/shishito peppers), the pork belly (over grits and kumquat) and finally the oyster gratin. While we waited, we started out with pickled string beans.\\n\\nThe rabbit was juicy and the breading was perfectly done (for what it's worth, the portion may look really small -- but like all the other dishes we ordered, it was extremely heavy). And of course we wanted more of that gravy...delicious. The clams were also flavorful, and I appreciated that they didn't rush taking the plate when we had plenty of sauce left. The corn pancakes were dense and rich, with whole kernels inside. It didn't look like much - but it really hit the spot.\\n\\nNote that the plates came one at a time -- in general, we are all for this especially given the limited space at our table. However, there was a significant lull between dishes three and four -- while we weren't hungry given that the first three dishes were quite filling, the lull was certainly noticeable. Similarly, we did feel that there was a noticeable -- if minor -- break in service for the second half. \\n\\nAs such, we were excited for dish four (the pork belly) which turned out to be a tiny bit overcooked. Still fine, but just a relative disappointment. As for the oyster gratin, it may have been that we should have stuck to four dishes and it was harder to appreciate when we were full, but we weren't fans - even as total leek geeks, we felt like a little overpowered. Had we been hungrier, I think we would have also wanted a little more bread to wipe up the sauce. \\n\\nThat said, we're certainly looking forward to coming back and trying the burger (and getting more of those corn pancakes and cocktails).

Luckily we got the last table available or else it would have been a small bar facing outside. The menu was printed onto a wooden board and I thought that was neat. The beautiful interiors incorporated both French- and Vietnamese-style decorations. I ordered the beef and carrots stew on rice ($12), and we shared the shrimp and pork tapioca dumplings ($9).\\n\\nSince I have never had vietnamese dumplings before, I didn't know what to expect. These dumplings were very chewy, with a small filling of shrimp and pork inside. I thought the tapioca dough was just a little too thick for my liking. As a result, the shrimp and pork filling got lost in between. It just felt like I was chewing the dough for a long time. It was an interesting experience nevertheless.\\n\\nThe beef and carrots stew on rice was just heavenly. The beef was so tender and the carrots were soft. I was looking for some comfort food and this dish was perfect. I also liked how there was a nice kick to it, it really warmed me up from the inside too. Amount was generous, especially the beef. I totally didn't expect the rice to be served with the stew on top, as I thought it would come in a bowl on the side. The rice in the stew totally soaked up all the flavour and as a result, each grain of rice was covered with this yummy goodness. I really recommend this dish, especially when fall/winter is coming, this makes great comfort food.\\n\\nThe reason I'm giving a 4 stars is because the service was a little lacking. Given the amount of people in the restaurant and the number of staff, I thought they would come by to make sure everything is fine, or to refill our cups more frequently.

The great thing is they have a ton of lawn chairs that you can sit in while waiting. Also, everyone is pretty friendly and talks to each other in the line. Matter of fact, I had to leave and get my\\nCar because my flight would be leaving in a few hours. Two young men saved my spot in line and also offered to order my food if I didnt make it back in time. Once I got\\nInside, I saw why it took so long. Everything is cut fresh and people ask a lot of questions about the weight of the meat. As far as the food, it is well worth the wait (which actually end up being 2 hours)!!! Best bbq I've had in a while. Especially the ribs. They were a game changer!

Oracle Coffee Company is a locally-owned, ethically sourced coffee shop that can more than hold it's own against the big boys in the city. They serve a great product and it's in a space that is welcoming, comfortable and conducive to both grabbing a coffee with a friend or buckling down for a couple of hours of work. I predict it'll be a big hit.\\n\\nThis needs to be noted, because I'm sure it'll drive some people crazy: They don't serve any dairy. You can get all sorts of dairy alternatives, but zero cow milk. I'm fine with that because milk is gross and I prefer almond or oat milk, but I'm sure this would be a deal breaker for many people. Don't come all the way to Oracle if you need regular dairy. \\n\\nWith that out of the way, everything is great. I had an oat-\\"milk\\" latte (trying to kick the almond habit) and also just a black coffee, and both were great. The latte was rich and creamy and had some pretty nice art, considering it's still not the easier-to-manipulate milk. Their espresso is by Sweet Bloom Coffee out of Denver, which is a solid choice. I'm always a bit surprised when Portland shops don't feature a Portland roaster, but I suppose variety is a good thing. Anyhow, Sweet Bloom is direct trade, which is definitely a good thing.\\n\\nThe space is great, too. It's super well lit and spacious. Almost comically spacious. The area behind the coffee bar is larger than some of the other shops in town. There's room for many, MANY more tables. Maybe if they get crowded they'll re-assess, but in the meantime it's nice to have such an open environment. They play good music, and the staff seems pretty cool. Free wifi, ample electric outlets, and comfortable chairs. This place works for me.\\n\\nAlso, directly on a streetcar route. That'll come in handy for sure!

Expensive yes, but they are open 24/7 fully staffed, and your pet doesn't need to wait and suffer if they need immediate care. I feel the value is there especially when they sit there and listen to you and your concerns, evaluate your pet, explain options to you, and let you stay with your pet as long as you like in a private room and process things until you are ready to say goodbye, if that is what you need to do.\\n\\nThe staff actually sat and talked me through my choices of keeping a sick pet going or not, and supporting me with their own experiences of losing animals. I've never experienced this level of concern at a regular vet office. Dr Agnello and the nurse ( Allison? -  I was in a fog and am not sure of her name) and the front desk staff all were quite comforting.\\n\\nIt made me feel a little less alone, and more accepting what I needed to do. I kept waiting for them to rush me out the door like has happened once before at a local vet during a prior euthanasia, which made me so sad for days to come that I couldn't give a proper goodbye to my beloved dog, and soured me on vets for while, (and people for that matter). But IVG encouraged me to stay as long as I needed before and after. I was stunned. They were so accepting and non-judgemental about the pet grieving process. It helped me so much get through this awful day, and my dog even liked it there! At a time like this IVG is worth it!\\n\\nI have brought another pet here for opthamology care and they were great for that too. Sad pet care costs a lot, but for a specialist you need to expect it. Unfortunately owning a pet comes with risk of health problem - it's the chance you take for their love and companionship. It's an awful thing when you need to decide between their care and your finances. I'm not sure why these other reviews say they only care about profits, I have never felt this way in the 10+ times I've been here. If you are concerned about cost let them know and they will not do additional tests without your permission.

Also, they have great live music outside, which adds to the great charm of this restaurant.\\n\\n Now the bad....\\n\\n$$$ - Pricing is quite high overall. Chicken is a great price, but many dishes are overpriced. For example: \\nPasteis de Bacalhau - $10 for 4 of them. \\nCarne asasa with rice and beans - $28\\nFish tacos - $12 for 2 tacos with no sides \\n\\nFood wait times - Out of the 6 or so times I have been here, only once has the food come out in proper time. The very first time I came, I ordered the Filet Mignon (Bife a Portuguesa) and the Bacalhau dish. Food took 1 hour, 5 min to come out. I did not complain, ate the food, and even forgot how long it took because of how good it was.\\n\\nSecond time I went, my table ordered 3 chicken dishes. It took long to arrive, they gave the wrong chicken to the wrong people (one was hot, one was mild, and the other was the garlic), and the chicken was quite dry. The flavors were really good though.\\n\\n Then, I went for my mom's Birthday...\\n\\nOur dishes took nearly an hour to arrive (table of 5), and my girlfriend's dish only arrived after 1 hour 30 min wait. When her dish arrived ($34 bacalhau), the rest of the table had finished eating. \\n\\nI do want to give a shout out to FABRICIO. He is a server there and he is the best server and has the best customer service. He truly cares and is very knowledgeable. If it weren't for him, we would've never returned after that night. \\n\\n During this last visit, it was a table of 3. We ordered 2 chicken, and one Carne Asada (medium rare). There were no other tables sitting outside, and the restaurant was about half full. After waiting for 40 minutes, the server comes out and says he has an update on the food. He said there was a large party inside and the food was going to take a little while. At this point I was quite upset and asked him how long it would take. He said he was going to check....10 minutes later he still had not showed up to update us. Then, all of a sudden our salads arrive...At this point I asked for a manager.\\n\\nThe manager NELSON had horrible customer service.\\n\\nWe explained to him what had happened, and that we continue to come back to the restaurant but keep having these issues. His response was \\"well, it only has happened the last couple of times. Good food takes long to come out, and the other party inside has been waiting longer than you.\\"\\n\\nOh, what a great response for a manager. We are coming to this establishment and spending over $30 for dishes here; I don't believe they should take an hour to make a medium rare steak, no matter how busy they are. He proceeded to keep telling us that that's how it is, and did not offer anything to fix the situation.  Also, on this day they were not busy at all. I have gone to many better restaurants that are completely slammed and have food come out at the proper times.\\n\\n I believe the owners should really think about how to change the way this is run, because this place is going to lose a lot of good customers if they don't make changes SOON."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Funny how I've been to Screen Door a number of times and still neglected to write a review.

Plenty of parking and plenty of space to take in all of the awesome artwork blanketing the surrounding walls of other businesses (#OrlandoStrong). Upon entering the restaurant, I got a sort of rustic, down home southern kitchen-type of feel and I loved it. In my book you can never go wrong with meatloaf, so that's what I decided on. The Meatloaf Sandwich on sourdough seemed like a solid choice to me. It was indeed a fantastic choice. The meat worked in harmony with the sourdough bread. The chips were good, but I also tried some of their ranch seasoned fries and they were on point! Definitely the way to go for your side item. My son I ended up sharing and I got to try his Mac n' cheese which was also a winner. Love the use of the overly large pasta shells. \\nTheir Stubborn soda selection wasn't really my speed, but was interesting and something different. \\nI'm probably going to be kicked off of Yelp for this next statement, but here it goes...I didn't try a dessert.

The black ash was basically a black charcoal ice cream and looks awesome in pictures. It didn't have a super strong coconut flavor, but was still good and could probably be enjoyed by many palates. The blueberry lavender was for sure my favorite because the flavors were very forward. They also have more plain flavors like chocolate and cookie dough if you want to stick to the classics. \\n\\nYou can also sample any of their flavors and they use metal spoons as the sample spoons instead of wood or plastic which is awesome and reduces waste! \\n\\nIf you're downtown, definitely check this place out!

It serves as a great dining choice for either brunch or dinner.  Additionally, they have a nice bar area that is good for drinks and tapas. \\n\\nI find that the bartenders here put great drinks together so it is good choice if your plan is to meet up for drinks.  The bar can get busy towards the end of the week and on weekends, but the quality and selection of cocktails, wine, beer, and tequila make it all worthwhile.  My personal favorite is the sangria margarita, using malbec as the base, topped off with some fruit and a cinnamon stick.  DELISH!  Their more traditional margaritas are well-crafted as well.  \\n\\nFood wise, the menu can rotate with the season, but popular items tend to stick around.  In the starters section, I've always been partial to the spicy tuna tartare which has a zesty vinaigrette and comes with an avocado puree.  In the mains, I have really enjoyed the Negro Modelo braised pork shoulder which comes with a port and fig reduction.  The seared Ahi tuna is quite delicious as well.  \\n\\nI only recently went to Masa for brunch and was quite happy that I finally made it over there.  Like their dinner menu, there is quite of variety available and plenty of vegetarian options available as well.  They offer a 2 course menu for $8 which is a good deal.  At brunch, definitely get a bloody mary, though I am sure you cannot go wrong with some of the other options.  I chose the eggs benedict which came with a green chile hollandaise sauce.  I love eggs benedict and I found these to be quite good.  The biscuits are on the dry side, but there's a fair amount of sauce you can use to soften them up.  I started with the caramelized banana empanada, which is a wonderful sweet start to brunch.  \\n\\nThe service is attentive, even when the place is hustling and bustling full of people. I tend to make reservations if I plan on dining in the main area, as it can get busy on weekends."},{"name":"Cafe 101","address":"5412 Buford Hwy NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Boy am I glad we decided to give this place a shot for lunch today. \\n\\nWhen we arrived, we saw the paper sign stuck on their window indicating their lunch buffets on Sat-Sun. from 11:30AM-3PM....at a crazy price of ~7 bucks for adults, and 5 bucks for kids!  SCORE!\\n\\nWhat's great about the buffet is that despite making it a buffet, the quality of the food served did not seem to drop at all. The typically popular dishes made here (spicy eggplant, basil chicken) were really on point, and even the Szechuan-style spicy crispy chicken nuggets (they really aren't that spicy, but super tasty anyway) stayed crispy sitting inside a small tin container. \\n\\nShanghainese style noodles were made competently, stir fried string beans had the proper 'wrinkle' and flavor to them....I was thoroughly satisfied and impressed with the options they provided here.  In a pleasant twist, they included shrimp with the spicy eggplant dish- they properly salted and cleaned out the shrimp (probably multiple times), to get the texture of the shrimp to be crunchy/crispy when you bite into it.  \\n\\nI couldn't help but get 3 pretty full plates of food. So good. Yes, definitely on the greasy side, but so good- not to mention the great prices (again).\\n\\nWhat's missing from this buffet is the typical buffet stands with steaming water heaters underneath the dishes- everything is served on two circular tables, and you make your way around and between the tables.  Homestyle.  I like it....a LOT. But if they start drawing larger crowds, they might need to change things up.  I considered not writing this review because I didn't want this place to get flooded and overwhelmed (leading to drop in food quality)- and go out of business.

When our friends (who've been there a few times) suggested we get some dogs their I jumped at the chance. Locale was OK, I appreciate the downtown location since downtown needs this kind of stuff, but didn't really dig standing on the sidewalk waiting for a table in the middle of downtown (this did not weigh on my review).\\n The whole orginization of the restaurant was chaotic. The hostessing was a mess, no one knew who was waiting and in what order as people came in and were not addressed. The place is small and needs someone to control the flow better. But, it was Friday so, it was mederately busy. This didn't excuse the rushed rude waitress. Kind of bummed about that.\\n\\nAnyway, about the food. The Menu had promise and I wanted to try just about everything. I took some suggestions from my seasoned friends and got the one with the chili and fritos (insert whacky name here) and the one with baked beans (insert name here). My boyfriend got the one with brisket and the one with bacon wrapped around it. By far the bacon wrapped dog had the most flavor, this is nothing the cook did. It was just the magic of bacon. Otherwise, the buns were too big for the dogs and I thought all of them lacked flavor. (no I don't smoke, my tongue works fine) The baked beans were the worst i've ever had and the coney sauce was super bland and even needed salt if it had been sans fritos. Everyone at my table seemed happy with their meal, but I just felt like I was let down after a long build up of hot dog heaven promises. Maybe I went on a bad day. Sometimes Betty's is inconsistent in food quality. We can't all be perfect 100% of the time.\\n I'm not sure I'd go back here and wait 45 minutes for a bland hot dog and sassed service, but I still feel the urge to try every single menu item.

Food is not only a question of taste, but also proportion of taste. The lasagna was made expertly. The beef was not over seasoned, and the ratio meat vs ricotta vs pasta was just right. And the marinara was really, really good. Based on that alone, I would have given five stars. But... It must have been a bad night with the garlic rolls. The bread was a bit bitter and not yeasty at all. If something, they were quite bland. The garlic butter on top was probably made with margarine and old rancid garlic powder. Even if that was not the case (I really don't know what they used) that's how it tasted. If something, it was mediocre at best. I don't know what the hype was about. That was 0 stars. Finally, the dessert was a White Chocolate Bread Pudding. As far as bread pudding goes, this one was good. Not very good or great. Just good. I can't say I tasted any white chocolate, but then, it is a more subtle taste to find in cooked food. The whipped cream was excellent, more like a French Chantilly. In the end though, I probably will forget this dessert pretty quickly. The pudding gets 3 stars. What about service you say? Joshua was my server. His table manners were rather average. I had barely say down and opened the menu on the drink page that he asked me what I wanted. Either he did not notice I had just arrived, or just doesn't get it. I think it would have been proper to wait a minute or two, or ask the question differently than \\"Call I get your drink?\\" This is an Italian restaurant after all. Same thing with the dessert. He came unprepared, and asked me if I wanted dessert. Again, it is in the way he asked. Overall, he's not bad, but he would fit better at a Denny's or IHOP than this Italian joint. Summary: I have no doubt they can make good food. But my mean was quite inconsistent. The menu is just the regular run-of-the-mill menu of an Italian restaurant. In other words, if you want to eat something truly original that is Italian, you will not find it there.

It was more like homestyle potatoes with vegatables and chunks of meat thrown in.\\n\\nSome friends of ours ordered the Oyster Po'boy and we were told it wasn't great. We all decided to order shrimp and grits at the end to share and we were surprised by how good it was. There were 4-5 large prawns in the grits which were seasoned nicely. It was my favorite thing we tried.\\n\\nOverall, if you can wait less than 20 minutes, I would say give it a try.

We waited about 40 minutes before getting seated, but as all of my fellow Yelpers are saying, it's worth every minute. Staff were very friendly and helpful. I was torn on what to order, but I knew my heart belonged to the Fried Chicken & Waffle, and I am incredibly thankful that I followed it.\\n\\nI've tried quite a few versions of buttermilk-fried chicken and waffle, but Screen Door, you're the best. You win. The chicken was tender, cooked perfectly crispy, and the spicy coating was delicious. The waffles... w-o-w. Did I mention that they're sweet potato?!\\n\\nI also loved that you can pick how many pieces of chicken you'd like with your order. I'm a small eater so one piece was more than enough. Trust me, it was a generous piece.\\n\\nAnd of course, we had to order the Praline Bacon Waffle. Let's just say my boyfriend finished it within minutes, and claims it's one of the best things he's ever eaten. I had a bite and couldn't contain myself. Was that bite even real?"},{"name":"The Cocoa Bean","address":"Gaylord Palms Resort & Convention Ctr","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"2.5","text":"Great coffee shop in the Gaylord Palms resort.

We head to Border Cafe, find some miracle parking and walk in.  The hostess was pretty robotic but what really disappointed me was our server.  The dude basically ignored us most of the time and one of the other servers (really nice lady) had to make sure we had enough plates/water etc because she saw we were being completely neglected.  Our actual server was just chilling with his friends and talking the entire time.  Lucky he got any tip at all.\\n\\nOn top of the bad service (aside from that one lady who wasn't even our server) the food was mediocre at best.  The pastelitos have gone way down hill and the quesadilla was so salty you couldn't taste much else.  I can forgive bad service once in a while but never sub par food.

Crezzy. Just came back this November and hit it up again. The stories:\\n\\n2015: We rolled up at 1 pm on a Saturday. The line was not even to the end of the building. The line lady discouraged us and tried to make us go away, telling us everything would be out by the time we got inside. It was blazing hot. We got inside. at 2ish. They were out of ribs and pulled pork, but they had everything else. So, we got the brisket, and sausage. Half and half (half lean, half fatty). They give you a default 3 pile of white bread (I guess non Southerners don't know this, but though I did not grow up in the South, I'm half black, and know that BBQ goes with white bread, duh). We ordered a couple pies and got all the sides and then set down to business. There are 3 sauces -- one is too sweet and not really a BBQ sauce, there's no smokey or mesquite flavor of any kind to it. All three are vinegar based. The regular is \\"tangy\\" with low sweetness and no heat. The last one has a little more kick but isn't really \\"spicy.\\" We mixed the kick + the regular for the perfect blend of kick + tang. None of these bottles are labeled you have to pour sample drizzles on your plate to try things out. \\n\\n2016: We arrived at 10 am on a Friday. Line was alll the way around the back block to the neighboring building's driveway and beyond. We got inside at 2:15 and ordered at 2:30. There were loaned lawn chairs and a lady who comes by with a wearable cooler selling you beverages. Behind the parking lot is a coffee shop with picnic tables. At one point, they came out with a mini roll of brisket in a piece of white bread to tide you over since we'd been standing in line all through lunch time. It was overcast/rainy, so luckily not hot out. We got in, and they were again, out of ribs. This time out of turkey. We got the brisket and pulled pork.\\n\\nDETAILS\\n\\nThe meat -- the best sausage I had, not having had a chance to try La Barbecue, but having tried the Salt Lick and Iron Works, is at Salt Lick. So, do not bother with the sausage here. They make it themselves but they make it off site -- it is not their specialty. The sausage was pretty bland and nothing unique whatsoever from any other general restaurant you might eat at. Their specialty is the brisket, and they will NEVER RUN OUT of the brisket because THEY KNOW YOU ARE COMING. So, you can show up LATE -- and still get brisket. The brisket is the best of the briskets I tried around town, good flavor, tenderness, smokey flavor. Is it amazing? No. Is it worth the wait? From 10 am, yes. From 1 pm, even better. From 5 am? I don't know. Not willing to try. :) I am willing to wait less time elsewhere for something similar, however.\\n\\nNow, I've never had the ribs. We keep trying. I guess you gotta get there at 5 am or whatnot to get your hands on them, which other people did. I'm not willing to do that. Sorry. :) If those were amazing, this might all be worth it.\\n\\nThe pulled pork -- ok. Not mind blowing. Pretty good. 3 stars. With sauce, 3.5. \\n\\nI asked for extra bread up front -- the guy nodded knowingly and I got a double handful (6 pcs).\\n\\nOh, the carvers are hot. Heh. But most men in Austin are hot and pleasant, so ... YMMV.\\n\\nThe lemon chess pie is pretty good. They always run out of key lime before I can get my hands on it. I had the pecan last time -- it was good.\\n\\nSides: I'm not into coleslaw, my friends enjoyed. I liked their potato salad, mustard based, although could have had a little more salt. Beans -- kinda spicy, actually, but otherwise not a ton of flavor.\\n\\nAfter all that waiting -- we got full pretty fast (your belly shrinks up after all that time!). We will likely go next time we are in town but more likely at 1 pm. :)\\n\\nSidenotes: They give you a tray with butcher paper to hold your food and extra butcher paper as your plate. BEFORE you leave the register you will want to: 1) ask for plastic bags to pack up your food, 2) pull off more reams of butcher paper as you need, 3) grab a whole bunch of paper towels from the roll. There are no togo boxes -- you wrap up your food in the paper and take it like that. You can use the paper holders that held your sides to act as \\"containers\\" for your food."},{"name":"Shawarma Point","address":"90 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I've had everything on the menu here and I can honestly say that everything is so good.

My first and foremost recommendation would be to come early and prepare to wait a little. I ordered the 3 Little Pigs and some form of a mocha that I cannot remember the name of. The seating is family style so it's very likely that you'll end up next to strangers that will turn to family by the end of your meal.

It came with a Jerusalem-style bagel, three dips, a little tomato salad, and two eggs any style (I got them poached).

I was three paragraphs in until I realized it started sounding like every other review here.  After visiting this establishment several times, I'm gonna share with you some insiders to what will turn a good experience in to a great experience at Franklin BBQ.\\n\\n1. Be prepared for the line.  I don't mean prepare to wait, I mean bring chairs, umbrellas, board games if you have any, have your phone charged, bring a hat or sunglasses for those summer mornings, and definitely bring water and either eat breakfast before you leave or bring a snack with you.  \\n\\n2. If anyone says \\"meh\\" about the brisket here, it's because they did not ask for the moist cut AKA fatty.  Ask for MOIST AND the edge piece if possible.  That's where the win is at.\\n\\n3. If you're not a dessert fan, who cares?  Finish off your meal with one of their mini pecan pies.  Only need one for the table.  Cut it in small pieces (I know this sounds silly but it works) and have everyone at the table savor a slice of the pecan pie.  A great way to end the meal experience.\\n\\n4.  As for the whole experience, ask one of the staff members ahead of time if you can visit the pits.  Who knows? Maybe you'll run in to the owner who will show you the pits himself.\\n\\n5.

Go in, wait with a smile, and leave with a grin and a fully belly of awesomeness."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is seriously amazing.

First of all, we sat outside on the patio and the view was amazing. We had the Columbia River right in front of us and we saw beautiful trees and bridges with trains passing by. Secondly, the food was delicious. We ordered the calamari and bruschetta for appetizers. The balsamic glaze on the bruschetta really kicked up the flavors. The calamari had some artichoke hearts in them which were pretty delicious as well. Only criticism for the calamari was that some of the pieces were soggy and tasted mushy. I ordered the Blackened Ahi Tuna for my entree and once again it was very good. The tuna was perfectly cooked with a nice crisp on the outside, but the inside was a moist medium rare. The rice and broccolini were also very good. Only critique was that it was a little salty from all the salt/pepper to make it blackened, but then the sauce was also a little too salty. My wife ordered the hamburger and it looked really good. I unfortunately didn't try it because I've had so much food already at this point to eat anymore. She said it was good though! We ordered my son a pizza from the kids menu and it was a pretty decent size pizza considering it was from the kids menu.

Unfortunately since ownership changed hands it has gone downhill fast. The food is incredibly inconsistent. I usually order one of their phos extra large, which is supposed to include more meat, but sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it's not even as much meat as you'd get in a regular pho. The broth is also hit or miss. Today it's rich and flavorful, tomorrow it may be tinted water. It's frustrating because it can be a terrible value for the money, due to this. You never know what you're going to get. \\n\\nI always have to check my order before leaving, because they will get it wrong at least half of the time. I don't mean forgetting an item, or something minor. I mean giving me a completely different type of pho than I ordered. \\n\\nThey also need to decide on their identity.

We called ahead of time to let them know there would be 8-10 people in our party. Apparently we should have warned them that most of our party is heavily tattooed and modified so they could have told us to go elsewhere.\\n\\nWe filtered in over a 15 minute period, but just ordered waters and snacked on chips til our whole party arrived. The first strike was asking for queso dip to accompany our chips. We had to ask three times, and the dip only made it out when our food did (about a half hour later), rendering the ordering of it moot. We ordered all our food at the same time to avoid confusion. Half the dishes were incorrect, and two of our party received their food ten minutes after the rest of us, despite their food just being a quesadilla and a soft taco, both incorrect as well. One of our group asked the waiter what the sauce on her dish was, and instead of finding out, he shrugged and said, \\"I don't know,\\" and walked off. We had no refills at any point until we chased down our waiter. I ate half my food, and when I went to the restroom for a few minutes, the waiter snatched my food off the table so quickly that my fellow diners couldn't tell him that I was still eating. Strangely he made no move to clear the plates that were clearly finished.\\n\\nRight after the waiter made off with the rest of my meal, he dropped off one check out of the five expected checks. At this point we decided to complain about the service. While waiting for the manager, the waiter came back (still without the rest of the checks) and snatched the sole check presenter out of my hand, and returned several minutes later with a check with a higher price on it than before.\\n\\nWhen the manager (who's name I never caught) finally arrived, she never once apologized, and made excuses for the server, blaming us for arriving and ordering at different times, despite all of us ordering at once. We asked for the late and uneaten queso to be taken off the menu, and perhaps the half of my meal I didn't get to enjoy, but she refused. One of the members of our group went up and talked to her again and asked for the items to be removed, but she again refused and said that her only option was to suspend the server for a couple of days, or give us a coupon for one free meal. Our group member stated that we wouldn't be dining here again, and once more asked to have the items removed, at which point the manager broke out the most offensive part of the night. She removed the queso and half-wasted meal, but looked right at our group member and said, \\"I bet you were all planning on doing this [getting comped meals] from the moment you walked in here.\\" We immediately paid and left, none of us have ever received such offensive service from any establishment. Ever.\\n\\nThe funny part about this visit was that every other table in the restaurant was getting wonderful service except for our table of heavily tattooed and modified people.

We decided to split the ostrich sliders and I got the curry pot pie and tuna for dinner. Many of the plates are tapas style, so ordering multiple is a good idea. That's not to say they were small, though--I was shocked at how much food I got for dinner.\\n\\nThe ostrich sliders were pretty good--it is a similar texture and taste to ground beef, just a bit more lean. Definitely a cool experience trying ostrich, though. The curry pot pie had an (apricot?) glaze and was phenomenal. The glaze itself you could bottle up and put on just about anything. The tuna dish was also quite good as well--seared tuna and a small salad, essentially. \\n\\nService was very buttoned up--waters filled quickly, pleasant waiter, etc. I think we ended up spending around $40/person for dinner (no drinks) which wasn't awful considering the quality of food we got.

And two.  As well as reasons three through five.  I mean, honestly - unless you're vegetarian, how could this place not be at the top of the list of restaurants to try if you're coming to town to check out the food scene?  I mean, is there even a more well known spot in Austin?  Well, other than Chick-Fil-A...HA!\\n\\nConsidering how Franklin Barbecue is practically the gold standard BBQ joints in Austin are measured against, it's no surprise that the place is insanely popular among tourists and locals alike.  If you need proof, look no further than the lines that form at the crack of dawn...everyday!  As tempting as it was to wake up at 6:00am to join in on the hours of fun/waiting in line (note: it wasn't), my friends and I opted instead to preorder online a week in advance for a scheduled pick-up from their to-go trailer (around the corner).  They require at least five pounds of meat to preorder, but that was fine - we ordered almost nine (did I mention we were excited?).\\n\\n-- SAUSAGE - $19 per pound or $4 per link\\nSome of my friends thought this was just okay, but I thought it was pretty good!  While it didn't have much spice to it (which my friends wanted), it still was well seasoned, fairly meaty, and super juicy.\\n\\n-- TURKEY - $19 per pound\\nI'm generally not a fan of smoked/barbecued turkey, but that's probably because I had never tried one that tasted this good!  The rub they used packed a lot of flavor and I was super impressed with how moist it was!\\n\\n-- PULLED PORK - $22 per pound\\nIn the best way possible, this was a bit different than I expected (I feared it was going to be slathered in BBQ sauce).  The portion had a nice mix of bark/non-bark pieces and the flavors had really nice smokiness to it.\\n\\n-- BEEF RIB - $22 per pound\\nNot as impressive as the rest of what we tried, though it's likely because it was the last thing I tried and I was starting to get full.  They nicely charred the crust without drying out the inside, and the rib had a nice beefy taste to it, but I didn't think the flavors stood out by comparison.\\n\\n-- BRISKET - $25 per pound\\nThe thing to get...and it is AMAZING.  The brisket wasn't overly fatty, the bark was perfect, and every bite practically falls apart in your mouth (it was so tender!).  If only the Bay Area had something half this good, though it's probably better for my waistline that we don't...unfortunately.\\n\\nAlong with pounds and pounds of meat, our order also included slices of white bread, pickles, onions, and a couple of tubs of barbecue sauce.  I didn't use any of their sauce (I prefer my meats with just dry rub), so I can't comment on that, but the pickles and onions complemented the meats very well (I liked the freshness they added).  Sadly, my photo of the meal wasn't the greatest since I forgot to take it until just after we had started to dive in (sorry, no glamour or individual shots), but trust me when I say that everything looked ridiculously tantalizing (evidenced by the thousands of photos that look better than mine).\\n\\nEven though the workers couldn't let us stay to eat our food at the picnic tables by their trailer, the staff here is super friendly and just as awesome as the food they put out.  Along with giving us suggestions on where else we could go (they suggested a nearby park, but we ended up at a food hall downtown), one of the workers helped us go through their stock of t-shirts for the styles/sizes we wanted.\\n\\nAll of that, paired together with quite possibly the best BBQ I've had in my entire life and you're talking about an easy five stars for Franklin Barbecue.  Though I still wouldn't wait all of those hours in line at the rack of dawn, I'll definitely make my way back here again!"},{"name":"Buttermilk & Bourbon","address":"160 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"My husband and I enjoyed a wonderful dinner here!

I'm trying to find out what to order on the Yelp app before the server gets back.\\"\\n\\n[Time & Date of visit]:\\nI've honestly been here more times than I can remember. Good thing / Bad thing. =|\\n\\n[Party Size]:\\n2-4 I usually try not to bring an actual group here more than four people. This isn't the place for a tour bus to stop at.\\n\\n[Location/Ambiance]:\\nParking - Aye, this is some what of a frustration. Usually there's some idiot who blocks the back parking lot entrance or takes two spots. Parking is limited. You can't park in front of the subway or have fun getting it towed and tracking to see which impound lot it was taken too. Sometimes there's a cop at the other end of the lot.\\n\\nInside - Cramped is saying it lightly I feel. But it's been like this for years. People still keep coming. Granted they could update the porch area with some heater lamps, I'd gladly sit there for more elbow room. The alcove before the double doors is usually congested with hungry people waiting patiently in line. Don't worry, most people are doing take out and the wait isn't so bad. Don't wait it out, the line doesn't really get shorter. If you're hangry, send someone more patient to wait for your group. \\n\\n[Service]:\\nFast casual kind of setup. I think they've changed up on having the food runners and bussers provide drink refills since they are already up and moving. That I think keeps a line forming in the already congested and cramped beverage area.\\n\\n[Food Highlights]:\\nIf you're a vegan, I don't know what to say but I feel sorry for you and you're missing out. Your veggies might have never moo'd, cluck'd or oink'd. But this is fine tasty bbq. \\n\\nRibs - have always been consistent through the years. Fall off the bone tender. \\n\\nPulled pork - I actually prefer a more sweet mesquite kind of bbq sauce instead of more vinegar tasting. But the pulled pork is just as good. \\n\\nChicken - Usually most bbq joints, the chicken is a bit dry. Though it has improved from the last visit. I still just own up to paying extra for both a rib sandwich and pulled pork sandwich since you can not sub on the combo plate. It's so worth the extra dollar. *drool*.\\n\\n[Total Bill w/ Tip & Tax]:\\nEven with a drink, maybe dessert or beer, it's usually under $20 for me to be very stuffed and make the tummy happy. \\n\\n{Summary}:\\nGood eats whether dining in or to go. Fatt Matt's is a staple of Atlanta BBQ even with other options around.

I'm looking confused as to why she would ask me such a question, then she told me their seems to be a problem with the connection to the credit card machine which has been going on for several days. She continued to attempt to process my payment which was the only form of payment I had and nothing happened so she notified her Boss. She came back tried it once more and said that he said to continue to make my food and that it was a good thing he was present. With limited time before I had to go back to work. He finally came out after several attempts from the cashier to process payment he proceeded to do the same thing with no introduction. After standing there for an extended amount of time he told me I've tried processing your card 100 times there's nothing I can do and told the customers behind me cash only and allowed me to walk out the door with no food.

There are so many tasty sounding options.\\n\\nTo drink I ordered the Sriracha milkshake, because I was very curious how it would taste. It was made with coffee ice cream, coconut, ginger candy, molasses and of course sriracha! Unfortunately I did not really like this shake. Too much sriracha was put in the shake that it completely overpowered all the other flavors. All I could taste was sriracha after a while. If only a small hint of sriracha was in the shake, it probably would have been perfect.\\n\\nFor food I ordered the all beef frank corn dog with a side of cheese and jalapeno covered tater tots. The corn dog was probably the best corn dog I've eve had! Yes I haven't eaten a corn dog since I was in 2nd grade, but that's besides the point. The tater tots were decent, but they could have been better.

It tasted good too! Fried onions straws and BBQ sauce paired nicely with the pork and potato. Although I think $16 was a little steep for so little food. I was hungry just a few hours after eating! \\n\\nWe also tried the Georgia Roll ($18) which was tempura shrimp roll topped with eel and tuna. It was a nice blend of sweet and salty and hot and cold.

For comparison, I'll be looking at the 3 categories of a perfect ramen: broth, noodle, and toppings.\\n\\nBroth: The broth was almost perfect! As someone who prefers a lighter flavor profile, Tatsu-Ya's broth was just tasty and light (and milky) enough that I actually drank all of it. I'm a huge noodle eater and I've never done that in my life. That's how good it was but I might be an statistical outlier.\\n\\nNoodle: Even though the texture and the chewiness was right, the noodle was a little too thin to have that ramen feel. I also ordered extra noodle and they cost $1.50 for 2oz and $2 for 4oz. Definitely go for the 4oz option.\\n\\nToppings: OMG, the chashu was AMAZING!!! I repeat, AMAZING!!! It literally melted in my mouth. Too bad each bowl only comes with 1 piece and an extra piece cost $3, which is pretty ridiculous. Other toppings include the standard  green onions, mushrooms, egg, and such. Good enough.\\n\\nI got the regular bowl at both locations. And the verdict is... that Tatsu-Ya wins on the broth and the toppings and Michi wins on the noodle. The price was about the same so it wasn't a factor. Overall, Tatsu-Ya has the best ramen in Austin.\\n\\nLastly, just a little about the atmosphere. Pretty hipster. I've been to Ramen houses in Japan before so I was fine with sitting next to strangers at the bar seats or the long row seats. However, the waiter (who was assigning seats during peak hours) suggested squeezing in a random guy with my wife and I at a small square table against the wall. Really? O_o 3rd wheel much? Why would he even suggest that? Obviously I said no and opted for the row seats instead.\\n\\nBesides that, both my wife and I enjoyed our experience at Tatsu-Ya and would come here over Michi in the future."},{"name":"Guilder","address":"2393 NE Fremont St, Ste B","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"The only downside of this spot is that it's not in my neighborhood!!

Nice little bar, friendly staff and the food was decent but both of us ordered the chicken with Caesar salad and BOTH of our orders of chicken were served quite raw.

I looked at where I had cut the chicken from and it was definitely pink and oozy, like really raw, where I had cut it from.  My friend's was the same.\\n\\nThe server took them back into the kitchen and they made us each new orders. The Caesar was terrific but the chicken was under seasoned and I had kind of lost my appetite as I have been really sick a couple of times with salmonella poisoning.\\n\\nI think if you serve two diners raw chicken you could at least offer a comp glass of wine while your meal is recooked.  I don't think we even got an apology, now that I think about it.\\n\\nDue to our experience, I should probably rate this a 3 1/2 star but I don't want to hurt a restaurant owner due to lack of concern of the server.

Not only did Chef Aaron Franklin received James Beard Foundation Award for Best Chef: Southwest in 2015, the restaurant was listed on the Yelp's Top 100 Places to Eat for three straight years (#8 in 2014, #56 in 2015, and #9 in 2016). Heck, even Anthony Bourdain (featured on \\"Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations\\") and President Obama (https://www.huffpost.com/entry/obama-franklin-barbecue-pays-it-forward-austin_n_5577714) paid a visit here!\\n\\nMy friends and I already knew ahead of time that we will need to get here at least 3 hours before the opening time (11 AM) just to have a chance to order their legendary brisket. We started to wait at 8 AM and a line had already formed. There were complimentary lawn chairs and people even brought their own beers (BYOB - bring your own beer), but one of my friends actually bought a can of beer inside the restaurant around 10:30 AM. The wait itself wasn't too bad because I took my friends out of the line for two separate coffee runs while one person would hold the spot. The overall atmosphere felt like an outdoor college tailgate party. One of the staff estimated that our section will probably get to order at 11:30 AM and it was a fairly accurate estimate (we placed our orders and paid at 11:45 AM). At 8:30 AM, one of the staff walked around and asked each party how much meat we are planning to order (they were NOT taking orders) so that other people waiting in the back know which meats will be sold out. Since the free parking lot was already packed at 8 AM, I had to drive about 2 blocks away (E 9th St & San Marcos St) for free street parking.\\n\\nThe menu is very simple - meat by the pound (minimum a quarter pound)  or sandwiches. Meat options include brisket (lean or fatty - $25 per pound), pork ribs ($22 per pound), pulled pork ($22 per pound), turkey ($19 per pound), and sausage ($19 per pound). They recommend at least 1/2 to 2/3 pounds of meat per person. We ordered 1 pound of meat per person with no side and we were REALLY full afterward - so don't get too greedy and over-order! Sides include potato salad, slaw, and pinto beans and each side order is based on single ($3), pint ($6), or quart ($10). For tarts, they have burbon banana, pecan, key lime, and lemon chess.\\n\\n***\\n\\nBrisket (1 pound): Brisket were mostly fatty, but the cutter recommended few slices of lean brisket. What a killer fatty brisket! Each slice of fatty brisket melted in my mouth and I have NO idea how cutter can cut such a tender meat! Lean brisket wasn't all that bad, but it was no match against fatty brisket! Both fatty and lean brisket had tons of flavors too!\\n\\nPulled pork (1/4 pound): Meat tasted just slightly dry, but meat had full of flavors.\\n\\nPork Ribs (1 1/2 pound): Ribs had absolutely UNPARALLELED blend of spices that left my tongue with a slight tingling sensation and a hint of spicy kick from pepper. Another must order in addition to fatty brisket.\\n\\nBread: It was slightly sweet with a soft texture and honestly it was surprisingly good.\\n\\n***\\n\\nPersonally Franklin Barbecue is one of the two best American BBQ I have ever had in my life (the other one is Little Miss BBQ in Phoenix, AZ, except that you only wait about 2 hours). One can argue that waiting in line is a part of Franklin Barbecue's experience and I savored every last drip of succulent juice oozing out from these fatty brisket! A visit in Texas isn't complete without Franklin Barbecue! \\n\\nP.S. - You can actually skip the waiting line by placing a pre-order (typically at least 10 days in advance) on Franklin's website (https://preorder.franklinbbq.com/) if you are planning to order at least 5 pounds of meat, but all pre-orders are to-go only and you also need to pay a deposit."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I've been here 2 times and both times I was amazed of the taste and quality of the food despite of the long wait even on weekday lunch time.

I pulled up to the order menu and waited and waited after about 4 cars pulled up behind me I finally said \\"hello\\" to which the lady on the microphone said oh welcome to taco cabana can I take your order?. I proceeded to give my order  to which she read back completely wrong. I had to correct the order.  I pulled to the window and waited and waited at least 3 minutes before being acknowledged. She takes my payment and I asked for jalape√±os and salsa, during this time I watch my food be put next to her by the cook. She slowly goes to the salsa bar to get the salsa and jalape√±os.   She comes back moves my food to the other side of her and then decides to make my drink mind you 5 minutes have now gone by.  I then see her taking a drink of the dr.pepper from a clear cup. Instead of saying something to me she walks off and stands at the front counter all while my food is just sitting there after another 3 minutes she comes back to the window gives me my food and says you'll have to wait our dr.pepper is being switched out.  I finally said forget it and drove off. This place is pathetic and the attitude of the employees and managers is horrible.  90% of the time you go to drive through the first thing they give you when you pay is a drink.  She could of told me right then and there there was an issue but instead drug it out another 10-15 minutes.  I pulled into the drive through at 10:04pm and pulled out of the drive through at 10:32pm. How Taco Cabana has not done something with this store yet I don't know they see all the bad reviews and it continues.

You can valet, street park, or find a nearby lot.  Atmosphere is homey (venue is in renovated home) with what appears to be family photos.  We went in for Sunday brunch without a reservation and were seated at a table for 2 within 10min.  Staff was professional and our server Brandy was very good.  She went through the menu with us and described several of the fave dishes.  We settled on the hash, the fried egg sammy, and a side of mac & cheese.  All dishes were good!  I must say that both my wife & I come from families with amazing southern cooks that could definitely prepare similar dishes at least on par with our meal today.  No knock on Revival though, as it has to be challenging to maintain consistently good food.  For dessert, we we both thoroughly enjoyed the lemon pie!  Please give this a try.  In short, we enjoyed our experience and our food at Revival and we will be back."},{"name":"Fuji At WoC","address":"1420 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"4.5","text":"I LOVE this place.

The roasted mushroom gnocchi was lukewarm, oddly bitter, and slimy. The pork tasted wonderful, but also was not the right temperature. The chicken thigh was mealy, and the carrots on the dish were somehow rubbery.\\nHowever, the clams, beef carpaccio, and Brussels sprouts were to die for. \\nUsually everything here is wonderful, but this was just bad. I think I'll stick to their upstairs bar Longfellow. The food there has been consistently good with great service.\\nAlso, the host was quite snippy with us, despite the restaurant being empty. As someone who works in the restaurant industry, this was a bit concerning. The service was also slower than it had to be... \\nOverall, a disappointing meal.

The chicka-bao was pretty damn relish though the chicken itself was a bit dry; the YVR was jam packed full of fresh tuna which was a pleasant surprise but I was a bit turned off by the fact that it's marketed as \\"seared\\" yet served ice cold. Also a bit mayo heavy...  The bao itself was a bit dry but end of day pretty delicious.\\n\\nWe also ordered the Kung-Fu (?) fries which I personally did not like. It was sweet on sweet on sweet and became a bit too much.  We had a couple bites and then had to call it quits.\\n\\nThe best part? Bad ass loud gangsta rap the whole time and 33 acres beer.

Its a central hub where you can go to meet a friend, take your family or just sit and do homework. I find the atmosphere to be warm and inviting. Not to mention beautifully re-done since the last owners. The rotating artwork is a great idea, always keeps it fresh. As well as the sound of albums turning on the record player instead of sports or top 40, how refreshing!\\n\\nAs for the food: Wow! I have never been disappointed and its safe to say I've tried nearly everything on the menu. You can tell everything is made with care, home-cooked with fresh ingredients. I especially admire their presentation of the food with fresh berry garnishes and cucumber swirls. The menu is rotating so try not to get too attached to anything, but what ever they replace it with is sure to be just as good. The kitchen is also very open to any adjustments you want to make to your food, I even got a side of potato chips with my sandwich! \\n\\nAs for the coffee, you can tell its made with care and is never watered down. The owners seem to be avid coffee drinkers as I always see them around the cafe with a cup of their own so I believe they would not be willing to skimp on quality. I love the guy who often works the front that does the corky latte art! So cool. \\n\\nI find the service friendly, welcoming and non-intrusive. I was able to sit at one of the tables with my laptop for about 3 hours doing homework with no disruption. Even on the wi-fi card it says they welcome you to stay for as long as you want, as long as all the new comers have a seat. \\n\\nAs far as independent cafes in Vancouver, I think this one is a gem. Most coffee shops that I have been to have limited options for food, or just a few wraps/sandwiches sitting in the fridge all day. It really is unique and it feels like home.\\n\\nIf your looking for Starbucks, go to Starbucks. If your looking for a lunch at cactus club with fake smiles and sub-par food, then do that. But if you are looking for something different, then I full heartedly recommend Commercial Street Cafe."},{"name":"Smashburger","address":"1298 Worcester St","city":"Natick","stars":"3","text":"Terrible customer service.

The glass was literally 1/3 filled (a traditional small white wine glass mind you).  Due to a miscommunication the server ended up bringing us a second round to which we took as to not be rude.  At this point we were in to drinks for $45 and maybe had a totally of 6oz of slush each.\\nOur appetizer came ($12 for lobster fresh rolls).  It was divided into about 6 bite sized pieces of roll. They were decent but not worth the price and certainly not great.  The most disappointing however were the meals.  I had the roast beef sandwich. The beef was grey and dry covered in oily cheese and a hard bun which seemed toasted to cover the fast that it was stale.  The fries were cold as was the sandwich, this was $15.  My partner had the black bean burger at just a couple dollars less.  It fell apart on first bite, was also on a hard stale bun and was served with completely inedible rubbery oily potato chips.  I've been in Boston my entire life and never dined at Sonsie.  For an over $100 lunch, I will never be back.\\n\\nAlthough I appreciate the owner reaching out, the general manager simply offered to send a gift card to cover the cost of the extra drink that was brought by mistake (a gift card that never came btw and it's been 3 weeks).

It was literally just chicken pieces tossed into a sub roll.  My roast beef was good.  Because of the dissatisfaction my gf had for this place after that instance, which at the time I didn't think was a big deal, we avoided Supreme for the good part of a year.\\n\\nFool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me....\\n\\nSo recently we finally came back to Supreme (after finding one Subway was closed earlier than their posted hours indicated, and another Subway having no sub rolls left).  I ordered another roast beef ($5.80 as of 4/18/2015) and my now fiancee ordered a veggie sub ($3.25).  She called Supreme in advance to find out about the vegetables.  Are they grilled, fresh, etc.?  They confirm the vegetables were fresh and not grilled.  So I go to pick up the order without knowing exactly what she ordered.  The bill somehow got to $14.07.  I inquired as to why a roast beef sub and vegetable sub would both cost that much.  The lady at the register told me my fiancee ordered a chicken kabob sub.  She then asked the cook to clarify the order who told her that the sub was a veggie sub.  She only deducted a $1 from the original charge (after hearing her mummer something about there being a difference of $2).  I still thought I was being over charged but thought perhaps the toppings or something was ordered that increased the price...always know what you're picking up (which I tend to, but not this time).\\n\\nAs I get home, I looked up exactly what we ordered and well $5.80 + $3.25 + tax (6.25%) DOES NOT EQUAL $13.07 (it's $9.62 rounded up).  And there is no mention of extra toppings costing anything.  It's a difference of roughly $4, but the principle is that they schemed me to gain an extra few dollars (that's called fraud for short).  The lady's immediate assumption of there being only a difference of a $1 was too rushed to indicate any form of care for the customer.\\n\\nMoral of the story is not to go here.

And look, I've been a server before. I get it, you want to go home! But the restaurant was open and if you're open you need to provide polite service to your customers or you need to close earlier - seating people and then making them feel extremely unwelcome at every turn is not cool. I was there with my brother and due to the late hour we were exhausted and in no mood to linger anyway - we were definitely planning to eat quickly and get out, which we made clear when we sat down.  But the server went out of his way to make sure we knew just how inconvenient our presence was and rush us out, definitely crossing the line from brusque to just plain rude.

They have a bar full of Mexican liquors and beers. I had the trios meal where I was able to mix and match what I wanted. I chose a chicken tamale, a chicken taco and a beef enchilada, just to try multiple foods from the menu. Everything was DELICIOUS. My friend ordered the queso like meal (I forget what it is called) but it's a big bowl with 3 different melted cheeses with different kinds on meat in it. It was almost like a dip or a thick soup. It was really good. If your a cheese lover, it will take you to the moon. After our meal we went to the shop they have full of Mexican art, clothing and even furniture and some desserts. I love this place way more than tacos and tequila.

This is likely a popular date night restaurant, and we were told that Sunday brunch is amazing, and packed to the rafters.\\n\\nI started my meal with a cup of their legendary She-crab bisque which was very creamy with just a touch of sherry, and filled with bits of lump crabmeat. Then came a plate of fried green tomatoes to share with my tablemates. Good Lord these were yummy! They were fried up with a bit of goat cheese, and then a red pepper coulis on the side. Our waiter brought out a basket of warm corn bread with some sweet creamery butter while we waited for our main courses.\\n\\nBy the time my entr√©e showed up, I was plenty full, but I forced myself to enjoy the Southern buttermilk fried chicken served with some amazing collard greens on top of garlic mashed red potatoes.

I've heard many great things about it. We were seated at the front of the restaurant right where the doorway was. Man, was it cold considering they left the door open for their own convenience of serving customers that were out in the patio. We noticed there was a lamp heater right at the doorway. We asked for it to be turned on and the server said it was broken. Half an hour later, this guy (I think he's the owner) moved the lamp heater out to the patio and turned it on. Seriously? We then asked for the door to be closed, they said they can't because they need to serve the customers out in the patio. Um... Ok... We then ask to be moved to another table that was a table away from the front door. They said it was reserved and the customer asked for that specific table. Those customers didn't even arrive until an hour later which we were close to finishing our night.\\nWhen we ordered some alcohol, we were asked for ID but my boy friend recently renewed his license so he didn't have his picture ID with him. Therefore the server just said he can't have any and that she will only bring enough cups for the rest of us. We were like seriously.... \\nAfter ordering our food, we noticed our utensils were dirty. So, we asked to have that exchanged. The servers did it but with some attitude. \\nWhen we asked for the bill, the server came back and told us because our bill is over $100.00 they tacked on a 10% gratuity. What the heck? That made no sense to me considering we were only a table of 4. First off, with the service we got we didn't even want to give them the 10% and now it's tacked on. Ya, we were in no mood to bring it up to the manager or anything and was just forced to pay it. We really just wanted to go home after a long day.\\nOverall, my experience here was just horrible.

I supposed small plates are trendy nowadays even though they are by no means economical. \\n\\nWe were a party of four sharing a couple of plates for dinner. Our first impression was that the place looked like a nicer version of old favorites such as Beehive or Beat. The first cocktail drinks continue to bring approvals. I ordered an Indian Summer, and while a bit on the pricey side, it is Boston and the drink was good. \\n\\nI'm afraid I cannot report that food ordering was without incidents. Apparently they had given us different menus (I was wondering why I couldn't find the dish with poached eggs on my friend's menu!). While we resolved our confusion, it was a bit disappointing to discover two of the plates we wanted to order were out. One was out for the evening and the other was out for the season. \\n\\nWe ordered scallops, fois gras, wild boar meat balls, local fish and rooster. Although all the plates were good and uniquely presented, I don't think most were extraordinary. My favorite was the meatballs. Kudos to that though I supposed most of decently cooked meatballs would've been delicious if you only eat one. The result of a medium plate with only four meatballs... The desserts were also good. Our table was divided between orange chocolate cake and cumin donuts. Personally I'm not a fan of cumin in desserts, but some people approved. Finally, the red Spanish wine I had with dinner was so-so. I've had better. \\n\\nOverall I loved the concept of Wink and Nod. The speakeasy style entrance was definitely interesting.

It was obvious when we waked in that we'd never been there before. The lady behind the counter didn't greet us but instead literally looked down her nose at us impatiently. The menu is limited so we ordered a slab of ribs and a pork sandwich. Torn about which sides to order I asked the ray of sunshine what was good. To which she coldly replied, \\"Everything.\\" I followed that up with a friendly, \\"What's the best?\\" To which she flatly replied, \\"Everything.\\" I murmured that that helped a lot and ended up with beans, mac and cheese and slaw. (It wasn't busy, BTW...)\\n\\nWe sat ourselves and got our drinks. The lady who brought us our food was almost as unfriendly as the order taker. Really, if the workers are that miserable they should stay in the kitchen and not interact with guests. I guess they figure they can get away with treating people like crap and they'll still come back because the food is good. The surprise was the bus boy. He was friendly, and shocker, even smiled. He asked if we needed anything and refilled our drinks. He even offered us a to go cup and filled it for us, smiling the whole time. Give this guy a raise or put him at the register!! \\n\\nOnto the food... The ribs were downright delicious. Fall of the bone, perfectly seasoned/sauced... just wonderful. The pork sandwich was kind of mushy. It was OK but nothing special. I didn't particularly care for the beans- I like mine sweeter. The mac and cheese was good as was the slaw.

Opened by superstar chefs Ricker (Pok Pok/Ping) and Mondok (Sel Gris), this much-anticipated, long awaited neighborhood burger joint finally opened its doors this week and offered me an opportunity to check it out before the crowds form.\\n\\nThe space itself resembles your standard McMenamin's-esque pub. Lots of wood and warm light, but without the crazy McMen's eye candy. It's actually fairly simple and plain. There is a large waiting area up front, some high-backed booths along one wall, and tables throughout. The back corner has a bar area serving a good selection of local brews and a full cocktail list. They also have milkshakes to which you can add booze, if you so desire. \\n\\nThe menu is short and sweet, offering The Foster Burger (local beef and back fat with onions, lettuce, and condiments) for $7.5, to which you can add bacon ($2), 2 year aged cheddar ($1) caramelized onions ($.5), Rogue Bleu ($2) or a fried egg ($1.5). There's also a lamb burger with fried egg ($11), a dijon-crusted, cheese filled portobello burger ($10), and a fried cod burger ($10.5). Each of these comes with hand-cut fries, a cup of soup, or a small salad. The rest of the menu is basically a few salads and a house-made pickle plate. House-made pickles are so \\"in\\" right now. \\n\\nI sampled the Foster Burger with cheese and Hilary B had herself the Fish Butty (cod burger). The Foster Burger was good. Cooked medium rare (as it should be) and nice and rich from the back fat. Add in a fresh helping of lettuce and tasty sauce, and a fresh-baked (from An Xuyen next door) sesame bun, and it could easily be somewhere in the top-10 burgers I've had in Portland. As it should be, from such renowned chefs and at such a hefty price tag (even though it's starting to be standard to pay $10 for a burger in this town, I'm not falling for any argument that it should cost that much). \\n\\nThe cod sandwich was tasty, but the fish was easily outmatched by the huge bun. The house-made pickles on the fish (or were they in a tartar sauce?) were the dominant flavor of the sandwich. It was tasty enough, but again at $10.5 it didn't really hold a candle to either the catfish sandwich at Corbett Fish House or even the Fish Burger at Horse Brass (both VERY respectable fish burgers). The fries were greasy and tasty, like fries should be. \\n\\nThe burgers were served in plastic baskets with red and white checkered wax paper, which adds to the burger bar kitsch, but doesn't stand up to the $19.5 we paid for the pair of burgers. Most places that have $10+ burgers serve them on plates. I think even McMen's does. \\n\\nService was quick and on-point. There were a ton of servers on, and some seemed kind of distracted at times (hell, it was the second day open) but we never were left wanting for a server when we needed one, and were checked on often. \\n\\nOverall, $23 for 2 burgers in plastic baskets and 1 Reed's Ginger Beer ($3.5 for a bottle!) was a tad steep for a very neighborhood-y, McMen's-style (but definitely better food and service) atmosphere. While the burger is good I would have to say that it doesn't stand up to some of the other amazing burgers I've had in town. Overall, 3.5 rounded up to 4. Maybe if I had ignored the press and hype, I would not have walked in expecting more. \\n\\nI hope that this restaurant continues and supports the revival of FoPo. Check it out when you're in the area and support your local restraunteur.

It tasted more like tequila than watermelon. I wish there was a better balance of flavors. I ended up trading with my friend who got the Blue Hawaiian, which tasted better to me. He actually preferred the margarita over the Blue Hawaiian so it worked out.\\n\\nWe had a coupon for free appetizer or dessert, and we decided to use it on dessert.

I just could NOT imagine paying $62 (regular adult admission) for this! Boy, I'd really be unhappy! And do you know you must PAY TO PARK?!? It's only $3, but just the fact that they charge is insulting. \\n\\nPre-Show: We intentionally arrived late so we missed this show. I'm my opinion these dinner shows open their doors an hour and a half before dinner just so you'll buy overpriced drinks and overpriced souvenirs.\\n\\nFood: This is your typical mass produced, low quality fare. They keep the lights so low you can barely see your food, which is a good thing.

The biscuit was fluffy and delicious as well. It comes with a side of roasted potatoes or plain/cheesy grits.

First up was the b√°nh m√¨ trio, a sort of b√°nh m√¨ sampler dish. While all three of them were of good quality, with fresh ingredients (I especially appreciated the freshly baked baguette), I think the best of the bunch was the house special, made with Vietnamese ham and braised pork belly.... because... pork belly.ÔøΩ?The savoury mini crepes came out nice and very hot, and nicely presented as well. The Banh Bot Loc, shrimp and pork tapioca dumplings, was nice too. I would prefer thinner dumpling wrap, but this has more to do with the nature of tapioca dumplings in general than the dish as made here. \\nFinally, the Pho Tres Bon -  As a $12 bowl of pho, the expectations for this were high. The beef tenderloin was both tender and very tasty, and the inclusion of bone marrow adds a welcome bit of richness to the texture (although it's a bit hard to pick out of the bone). The broth was also quite nice. The flavour could have been beefier, but it's still quite respectable, and would at the least seem to confirm the menu's assertion that they do not use MSG. Like the other dishes we had, it's also nicely presented (the little side dish for the bean sprouts, shaped like a little boat complete with a guy with a paddle, is pretty nifty!). All in all, I'd say this place was worth the visit, and while I actually went for the bone marrow pho, I think the b√°nh m√¨ stole it for me - will definitely return for that house special!"},{"name":"Junior's Diner","address":"2920 Corrine Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Always great.

The space is so small and the staff is only made up of an owner/head chef/bartender, a sous chef, and a server. I suspect that if they are full, the wait could be long. The staff were all very nice and attentive. The head chef dropped by at the end of our meal, and he clearly is passionate about his food and his restaurant. He was formerly head chef at Five Spice in Lake Oswego, but clearly is happy to have his own restaurant and his own menu.\\n\\nFor drinks, my companions and I had a glass of the Seaglass riesling, a glass of a Coelho pinot noir, and an unsweetened iced tea. The prices were reasonable given the amount poured (they are large wine glasses), and my party even checked the prices of the wines by the bottle to make sure the restaurant is not upcharging. I am confident in saying that the wine is appropriately priced. The iced tea was also good and they gave timely refills. \\n\\nWe started off with the crab cake appetizer and the truffled mushroom soup. Both were delicious. The two crab cakes were perfectly blackened on the outside and paired with a small salad and a delicious aioli sauce. The truffled mushroom soup was amazing, and as a mushroom lover, I was super impressed by how flavorful the soup was. Then I had the smoked double-cut pork chop. It was the best pork chop I've ever had. The days of marinating and smoking the pork chop that the head chef does is a work of magic. I'm normally fairly wary of pork, as it can get quite dry, but this was truly special. The french onion bread pudding, grilled asparagus, and mushroom cream that the pork chop came with were equally delicious. All in all one of the best meals I've had. I also could only finish half of the food, as the portion size was quite generous. On the pork chop alone, I would recommend anyone I know to give this place a visit.\\n\\nMy companions had the chicken breast with risotto and the special of the day, which was a prawn dish with pesto risotto. Both risottos were great, although we agreed that the pesto risotto was more interesting on its own than the spinach risotto that came with the chicken (they were out of butternut squash). The prawns were butterflied perfectly and not overcooked at all. Everyone hates a rubbery prawn, but these were great. The chicken was perfectly cooked, but overall, it was the least impressive of the three dishes. The presentation of all the dishes was beautiful. We all had to take leftovers home.\\n\\nMy companions were so impressed, they were immediately sharing their experience with their families to get them to come to the restaurant. In the future, once the weather is better, they will have seating outside and are intending to hire another server. However, I am a little concerned that the kitchen may not be able to manage the extra tables. While I enjoyed myself immensely, the entrees took 45 minutes to be served even though there were only three parties in the restaurant. It wasn't an issue, but I can see it becoming one if the kitchen is put under stress."},{"name":"No Mas!

Several times a week we would go to Tasty Burger for great burgers, great service, and an amazing craft beer selection. Usually we'd sit and enjoy a couple beers and a burger, and we knew most of the staff by name (and they knew us).  \\n\\nAt the end of last summer, we moved to Pennsylvania, and our final meal in Boston was at Tasty Burger on the eve of our move. This past weekend we returned to Boston for a visit, and we wanted to visit several of our old spots. Tasty Burger was at the top of the list.  Our flight landed at Logan on Thursday (9/11/14), and shortly after settling in we headed to Tasty Burger for our first meal in Boston in over a year.\\n\\nTasty Burger has an amazing selection of craft beer, mostly in cans, including several from our favorite brewery, Six Point, including our favorite craft beer, Resin.  We can't find Six Point where we now live, so we were really looking forward to Tasty Burger for more than just a bite to eat.  \\n\\nThe first thing we noticed is that the staff is completely new, which wasn't a complete surprise -- it's been over a year, after all, and even last summer there were new faces as several of our \\"regular\\" waitstaff were promoted to positions at other Tasty Burger locations.  \\n\\nBut what we weren't expecting was that the service would now be downright horrible. \\n\\nWhen we arrived at Tasty Burger, there were more than enough tables to choose from.  The three of us -- me, my girlfriend, and a friend who we were staying with for the weekend -- sat down at a table close to the bar, and we were given menus.  When the menus were placed in front of us, we asked for three waters, as we were all very thirsty.   Some time later, our server returned -- without water -- to take our order.  We ordered three Resin beers, and asked for frosted glasses with them (as per usual).  We each ordered a burger, and we ordered a large fry to snack on, and asked for the fries first if they were ready before the burgers.\\n\\nSome time later -- still waiting for waters -- the bartender comes to our table with a bottle of wine and some glasses.  \\n\\n\\"You ordered a bottle of Riesling?\\" she asks us.  \\n\\n\\"No,\\" I said, confused.  \\"We did order some beer, Resin.\\"\\n\\n\\"Oh, that makes much more sense,\\" she says, and heads back to the bar.  Meanwhile, our waitress is on the other side of the restaurant, looking at the bartender with a confused look on her face.\\n\\n\\"Resin,\\" the bartender shouts to the waitress. \\"They wanted beer.\\"\\n\\nNow, this in its own right wouldn't really be much of a bad service issue, as mistakes can happen.  I mean, it's not like RESIN isn't written in 4-inch high letters on a giant chalkboard behind the bar with the rest of the beer selection or anything, or it's a beer they've had for a while. Oh wait, yes, it is, and it was one of our former \\"regular\\" waiters that first introduced us to Resin about 2 or 3 years ago.\\n\\nBut it was the waitresses' loud reaction (and still no water on the table) that really turned me off.  Instead of apologizing, she complained (loudly) that she was going to miss out on the tip she would have received on the full bottle of wine.  For the record, a full bottle of Riesling (according to TB's menu) is $19.  Our three cans of beer (which would actually have been at least six had it not taken SO LONG to get the first round) were $6 each, so that's $18 for the three (or $36 including a second round, which we were intending but never ordered).\\n\\nTo give the bartender some credit, even as she was laughing at our waitress she did manage to quickly return with three cans of beer.  We did have to ask for glasses though, but she brought them quickly.  Some time later, our burgers arrived -- but still no water, or fries.  \\n\\nThe fries did come shortly after, but were not as fresh as we're used to from TB, and we would have liked them much earlier.\\n\\nOur waitress eventually returned to check on us, and we asked (again) if we could have three waters.  \\n\\nA few minutes later, our waitress returned -- WITH ONE GLASS OF WATER FOR 3 PEOPLE.\\n\\nWe had to ask for water (that makes at least 4 requests), and she finally returned with two more waters -- and our check.  Now, at this point, we probably weren't going to order a second round of beer, but it would have been nice to have been at least asked if we were ready for the check.  \\n\\nOh, my beloved Tasty Burger, what happened?"},{"name":"Fat Matt's Rib Shack","address":"1811 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"1st time here, the sauce was amazing!

That particular episode explored the origins of pizza in Naples, Italy.  Of course that brought out pizza cravings for the rest of the evening.\\n\\nAs it happens there is a place in Austin called DeSano Pizzeria Napoletana, which specializes in that exact kind of pizza.  So guess where I went to lunch today?  \\n\\nThis is one fascinating place, with the scent of the wood-burning ovens immediately cluing you in that this is not your average pizza joint.  It's an open-kitchen floor plan where you can see the individually named ovens and the pizzaioli hard at work shaping pies.  While most all the tables are designed for seating large groups, I did like the mix of benches and stools at different heights, so everyone should find a comfy seat.\\n\\nDeSano may be a chain, but they're very old school with the use of their wood-fired ovens and most everything (flour, cheeses, San Marzano tomatoes) brought in from Italy.  Service was fast, friendly, and I even got to watch the action through the 'Dough Room' window!\\n\\nI tried an 11\\" 'Margherita Classica VPN', which contains San Marzano tomato sauce, mozzarella di bufala, pecorino romano, olive oil, and basil.  I asked for Italian sausage as an add-on, as well as the crust done 'Carnival style'.   This is where the crust edge is folded and twisted into a star-like shape and each fold is stuffed with creamy ricotta cheese  Using the extra tomato sauce as a dip for these bits of crust after you eat the rest of the slice is a must!\\n\\nA single bite of this pizza transported me back to when I visited Palermo in Sicily. The proportions of sauce, cheese, toppings, and crust are a perfect rendition of pies I've had from Napoli on south down Italy's boot.  As a bonus, both the sausage bits and ricotta were some of the best I've had of either ingredient. \\n\\nHIGHLY recommended you try this if you're a pizza lover!  Or even if you're not - this place might convert you!\\n\\nSome Pro Tips:\\n\\n1) Those not familiar with Neapolitan pizza need to come with an open mind, as it's a different style than a typical American pie.  The sauce is milder, as it uses the less acidic San Marzano tomato. The central crust is thinner, and each slice (in my opinion) is best tackled at the start with a knife and fork instead of by hand.\\n\\n2) If you enjoy Italian vino, the prices of the wine accompanying your meal are quite reasonable.\\n\\n3) 'Carnival' style is not on the menu; you have to ask for it.  There are some things to keep in mind.  First, it can only be done to the 11\\" pies.  Second, it's an extra charge - I believe it's a couple dollars but I misplaced my receipt (sorry, fellow Yelpers). Finally, keep in mind that the crust is stuffed with ricotta cheese, not mozzarella.  Ricotta is the pillowy, soft cheese you may be more familiar with in ravioli or lasagna.  What this cheese lacks in 'stretch' it more than makes up for in deliciousness!\\n\\nThis place scores a 5 out of 5 on the 'CTJ Scale', as noted below.\\n\\n5 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Jesus good. Would be OK passing away after finishing a plate here.\\n4 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Mary good. Would be OK being seen eating here by Mother Mary.\\n3 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Joseph good.

It was pretty dead but I like it that way. We sat ourselves outside on the decent sized patio. Even though it was nice out they still had the fire pit going and it was nice to look at. I am pretty sure our servers name was Jamie. He was nice and prompt and helped me with recommendations since this was my first visit.  \\n\\nWe decided to start off with the pretzels since they are only avail 3 days a week. It was 2 soft pretzels with some grain mustard and queso to dip. After taking 2 bites a realized this probably wasn't the best app to get if you planned on ordering a meal because they are very filling but good non the less. I would say they are better suited if you are planning on hanging out drinking and snacking. Also, the queso is was kind of generic tasting. \\n\\nI ordered the french dip with fries. It was really good. The truffle mayo was the perfect compliment. But I have to say I kept eying my fiancees burger like a dog begging for food. He ordered the special that day which was the breakfast burger. It was a bacon, cheese burger with an egg. He opted to leave the tomato sauce off which was a good move. The burger was perfectly cooked and flavored. The egg made it borderline too heavy to eat (in a good way). He never has food left over but he had half left over to take home. \\n\\nOverall it was a really good experience and I plan on coming back. Next time i think I will skip the app and dive directly into the sublime burger. I only have one bad thing to say. There was a rather bathroom-y smell on the patio and I figured it was due to the many people walking their pets in that area. But as it turned out their were 2 port a potties behind the patio. There was a Halloween party that night so I am going to assume this place has a real bathroom and this was a set up for the party.

When I got there the line to get a to-go drink was extremely long, snaking around the bar and up the ramp towards the entrance to the Pavilion (which I understand is very common).  Once I found out that I was not in the right line I went looking for the hostess station.  The hostess was very friendly and let me know that they have both tall tables to stand at as well as lower tables with seating and asked which I would prefer.  I chose the lower table and was pleasantly surprised to be told it would be about a 10 minute wait.  They have some benches available to sit on while you are waiting for your table as well as a wide cement ledge around the small fountain right outside the door.  \\n\\nTrue to her estimate, I was seated in less than 10 minutes (those waiting for a to-go drink were waiting much longer than that although the line did move along).  They offer an extensive Tequila menu which includes specialty cocktails and mixed drinks like margaritas.  The prices were typical for Disney - I ordered a house margarita on the rocks for $14.  It was a very nice size and was delicious!  The table service also offers what they refer to as small bites: tortilla chips w/salsa, tortilla chips w/queso, tortilla chips w/fresh made guacamole or a trio combo with all three.  I was pretty hungry as it was lunch time so I opted for the trio.  Boy was I surprised at the amount of queso and guacamole that came with it!!!!  I'm a pretty big eater, and I was using this as my lunch, but I was not able to finish anything - chips, salsa, queso or guacamole!

How times have changed.\\n\\nIn October of 2010, we went in for our weekly Davis Bakery lunch. I noticed a gentleman standing around observing everything. I hadn't seen him before, but everyone would stop occasionally and explain things to him. At first, I figured he was just a new employee. Then I saw him give a free item to a customer. I knew something was up. It turned out that Chris and Alex Davis had sold Davis Bakery. We were nervous. What would happen to our beloved bakery? \\n\\nFor the first few months - pretty much nothing happened. It was business as usual at Davis Bakery. The same great items and the same great service - just with different management. All seemed well.\\n\\nThen Frank and his wife started making some changes - some pretty welcome ones. New smoothies, new specials, new bagels, new desserts, new side items. It looked like we were getting a new and improved Davis Bakery. \\n\\nThen the new year came and suddenly portions started seeming just a little smaller. Maybe it was just my imagination - or maybe it was the new employees just not making things right - again. My sandwiches would often be missing one of the ingredients, or something would be under/over-cooked. Lots of visible changes at the bakery too - new counters, fridges and display cases, a changed layout. You'd barely recognize the place anymore.\\n\\nDavis Bakery has always been a little iffy on their use of social media. I follow them on Twitter and Facebook and they'd occasionally announce their daily specials. It's a great idea - days I wasn't even thinking of going in, I might read about the special and decide I wanted to try it. A minute of work for them, and an extra sale they wouldn't have gotten. In late January, they asked their Facebook followers what sort of changes they'd like to see at the bakery. The overwhelming response was more vegetarian items. \\n\\nDuring lunch one day, I asked one of the more older employees (as in he had been there a while) about some of the new changes. He explained that the new owners had \\"sunk a lot of money into the place and now needed to try to recoup some of it.\\"\\n\\nSo what sort of changes came after asking their Facebook followers? Longer hours (now open evenings), craft beers, a soup and salad of the day and a hot special of the day. You can go in for dinner and get a single plate of whatever their cook decides they want to make that day. It'll run you about $8 and it includes either a cup of soup or a small salad. You can also order anything off their regular breakfast or lunch menus.\\n\\nThey never did add any more vegetarian items. \\n\\nWith the spotty service and inconsistent food, I was ready to take Davis Bakery down to a 3, fighting for a 4 star rating.\\n\\nBut then they went and jacked up the prices - and seemed to have cemented the smaller portions as the norm now. Davis Bakery had always bordered on expensive in the past, but the service and food were good enough that you wanted to support the local business. Prices on a lot of items went up between 10-20% - and the portions went down. I get that they need to recoup money - I could accept either jacking up prices OR reducing portions, but not both. \\n\\nI've tried going back a few times and I keep getting the same anemic portions at prices that are just not worth it anymore.\\n\\nI miss the old Davis Bakery."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This place is gross and the food is nasty.

It's also much nicer to bring people here to the Nest compared to the old SUB (Student Union Building). Menu has a good selection of drinks and food. I got the BC Burger and fries which were actually pretty good. Lunch selection is around $12 bucks. \\n\\nOverall, Gallery 2.0 is potentially a good place to go, when they are open and available. Good atmosphere with a self-serve system can make it a good option on campus. If they can improve their ordering system and improve speed time, this place could be one of the best on campus."},{"name":"Cosmic Ray's Starlight Caf√©","address":"1180 Seven Seas Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Food is absolutely untasted.

The girl is a good friend of my g/f so we decided to treat them to something special.  Since we live really close to Yaletown we walked by Elisa often and we wanted to try it out... well Monday night we finally found a good excuse to try out Elisa!  \\n\\nI can confidently say we all really enjoyed the experience!  The restaurant decor is upscale but not overtly fancy.  It's a comfortable setting.  The tables are nicely spaced so we are not packed in like sardines!  Our waiter (Dominic) was really good with us.  He asked if it was our first time to Elisa we said yes....  Than he patiently went over all the different types of meats Elisa has....  As, I said to Dominic I didn't know there were so many different types of meat!  We got a Meat 100 crash course from our new friend Dominic!  We ended up going family style and ordered 3 different types of meat...  Blue Dot Sirloin, Dairy Cow Ribeye, and their best Japanese wagyu... more about the meats later....  I need to follow the chronological order....  for appies....  we shared some scallops and 3 different types of beef tar tar...   To be honest, I'm not a raw beef guy so I didn't eat much of it.  The other people said it was really good so I'll have to take their word for it.  To me...  raw meat is raw meat!  \\n\\nOk back to the beef!!!  I loved it!  I'm a carnivore so I love eating steak and meat!  Elisa's meat is a cut above the standard fare that you find at The Keg or even Hy's.  Elisa prides itself on premium cuts of meat... of course you end up paying for it, but I believe the higher price is justified by the premium cut of meat you're treated to!  My fave was the Dairy Cow Ribeye!  It's disgustingly dripping in fat!  You'll gain 10 pounds just looking at a piece of meat like that!  But man it tastes sooooo good!!!  Bite into it and the meat and fat melts in your mouth.  The gristle rolls down your chin...  as the fat and richness swirls around in your mouth you close your eyes and imagine all the fat being applied to your belly as you swallow that last bite!  Hahaha!  Really I might joke but it's wonderful!!!\\n\\nWe were pretty full but we had to have dessert!  After all it is a Bday we were celebrating!  We shared 2 desserts...  A baked Alaska... and a Berry tart...   Love that baked Alaska!  I'm surprise more restaurants don't serve this dessert!  \\n\\nThe only drawback that detracted from our experience was that we were seated right in front of the restaurant's open fire oven.  The chefs charcoaled all of the meats right in front of us!  It wasn't too bad when we first got there, but once the evening got going and more meat was being cooked it felt like we were sitting in a sauna!  I jokingly told the waiter next time I come here to eat I'm coming in my bathing suit!    \\n\\nOverall, we will come back to Eliza!

Here, the burger comes with two thick and delicious pieces of bacon, BRIE, grilled onions, dijon sauce, and pickled onions on the side (put them on!!) on a buttery brioche bun. The brie was the most perfect touch, I don't think I've ever had brie on a burger before. As far as fancy burgers go, this is definitely one of Portland's best I've tried yet. The only downside, if you want this burger and fries, it's going to set you back $17. For the poor and the cheap this is sad news, but overall I'd have to say the meal was worth it.\\n\\nAdditional small detail, I always feel guilty and paranoid that I'll feel less important to my server at fancy restaurants when I order the burger and fries with water.

At first glance this corner neighborhood hangout seems like it would be completely packed to the rim with fratastic dude-bros.  And don't get me wrong, there is a fair share of dude-bros, but that can be expected for a gastro-pub in Midtown.  The outdoor patio and the inside bar seem to be like two different worlds.  The patio is alive and vibrant.  This dog friendly place makes for a great place to hang out with your best friends (2 and 4 legged).  It was warm out (and there was no where to sit outside) so we choose to sit inside.\\n\\nThe first thing that stuck out to us were their booths.  I mean this place has the cutest little booths.  They can probably sit 3, but it's super ideal for a date or just a couple friends trying to catch up.  What's awesome is that even though it is noisy and busy, you could settle into a booth and have your little private enclave.  So, like I said the inside is completely different than the outside.  Outside, was bright and dog friendly and full of dude-bros.  And with dude-bros come the women that find dude-bros attractive.  Inside is overrun with ex-dude-bros, banker/business type guys, old single guys, creepy guys, sports guys.... you get the idea.  I could probably count the number of female patrons inside on one finger.  Yes, there was exactly one.  This being my first time here I am not sure if that is a norm for this place but it certainly was noticeable and as much as I LOVE THE \\"D\\" slightly awkward.  Also, maybe because it was still early... like the girls are at home getting ready because the guys here most definitely attract the high-maintenance girl, and they would come out later... who knows.  Just A LOT OF GUYS.  And no, it wasn't a gay bar.  This place was as straight as it gets.\\n\\nSo we sat down and were pretty promptly greeted by our server, who was really nice.  Now if any of you know me, you know that I like my drink order taken pretty quickly and I also hate it when my drink goes empty.  The only issue I had was that after she brought us our customary waters she never returned to ask about what we wanted to drink.  It is a bar and I assumed that she would have asked but nope.  I actually had to stop her when she came to take our food order that we would first like to order our drinks.  My buddy asked for a recommendation which he found to be amazing.  He actually seemed a bit taken aback in a pleasant way.\\n\\nWe decided to start off this epicurean adventure with some friend mushrooms.  They were just standard beer battered mushrooms.  Big mushrooms, dipped in a run of the mill beer batter, and then fried.  There really was nothing spectacular about the mushrooms.  I wish they would have seasoned the batter some or even sprinkled on some rock salt.  What was delicious were the two mustards that came with it.  You have to like mustard, which thank the good lord I do, but they were yummy.  It being Friday I got the ribeye special and my buddy, the one who was thoroughly enjoying his beer, got the salmon.  Both dishes were seriously good food.  The presentation was also beautiful.  Really beautiful for a bar, like almost too beautiful.  But I like sexy food so I was ok with it.\\n\\nThe food arrived FAST!  Again, maybe because it was still early and the kitchen hadn't really gotten into dinner service yet, but the food was out almost immediately.  This is a good thing.  The first thing I tried from my steak dish was the little cherry tomato that had been saut√©ed and mixed with the bacon jelly and I almost fell off my chair.  No literally, I was like WTF, how does this place make their tomatoes.  The steak was also cooked to perfect temp.  My friend really liked his salmon.  I had the opportunity to sneak a fork of his grits and they were just STUPID good.  All-in-all the food was a hit.\\n\\nI wish this evening held some more tidbits of delight but the tidbit of delight I got from the food was good enough for me to take time to write this.  The only reason I didn't give this place a full 5 stars is that there was way too much sausage (this coming from a guy that is a connoisseur of sausage) and the server didn't get our drink order.

They follow the strict guidelines of the Napoletana Association of Pizza (VPN).  I didn't even know there was such a thing!  Italians take their pizza craft seriously!  Almost all the ingredients are imported from Italy, even the flour.  Which means that I can eat it!!  I am sensitive to U.S. wheat I found out after years of doctors and testing - it's the chemicals used in the process that affect my system.  I can eat this Italian pizza without problems. The pizza here is phenomenal.  The crust is lightly crisp, and the ingredients fresh and full of flavor. Don't forget to check out the pizza condiments bar with spicy oil, fresh grated parmesan cheese, and peppers.  It is located on the far left of the restaurant at the front.  \\n\\nYou can order the pizza to go our eat in.  You can use their mobile app to place your order in advance.  You will walk up to the counter and pay for your pizza and will be provided with a buzzer.   They usually bring it out to you by hand before the buzzer even rings.  They have a draft beer on tap, and one white and red wine option.  Both are decent.  They have a good selection of imported Italian wines to purchase by the bottle as well.  The ambiance is very casual. They have several long community picnic style tables and benches to sit at.  The salads here are also tasty.  My favorite is the Caprese salad with their fresh imported mozzarella.  It is DELICIOUS!

Cantina is one of Atlanta's most popular Mexican restaurants. At the time of writing this, it's got over 1,000 Yelp reviews which is a lot for a restaurant in Atlanta. This place has a great atmosphere, but sub-par to average food that's a bit overpriced. Our experience was lackluster, but I wouldn't say this is a bad restaurant. We just expected better.\\n\\nNo Mas! is located in the Castleberry Hill neighborhood in Downtown Atlanta. The restaurant has its own free parking lot and is connected to other concepts that fall under the same business umbrella. There's a cafe (ADios Cafe) and Mexican artisan market (No Mas! Hacienda) next door that are worth checking out. No Mas! Cantina and Hacienda opened in 2006. I first visited in 2010 and it turned out to be almost a decade before I returned.\\n\\nThe restaurant and connected cafe and market are beautiful. The interiors are well-designed, colorful, and artistic. There are large plants, intricate artwork, and unique light fixtures. Inside, the restaurant has two levels. Outside, there's a spacious covered patio with a cool vibe. The ambiance is nicer than your typical Mexican restaurant, but still casual and fun.\\n\\nThe menu is pretty standard for a Mexican restaurant with nothing that really sticks out as different or special. Apps will set you back anywhere from $5-14 each ($9 guac), soups and salads $5-18, fajitas $18-20+ per person, entrees $15-25, and desserts $6-7. Entree examples include Tajada de Cerdo (bone-in pork chop, $24), Camarones Brochette (jumbo shrimp, $25), tacos, enchiladas, tamales, and chiles rellenos. A lunch menu, with items priced at $10-14 each, is available Monday-Friday, 11am-4pm. Alcohol-wise, they have a full bar with margaritas, cocktails, beer, wine, sangria, micheladas (Mexican beer cocktail), and tequila.\\n\\nWe visited for dinner on an ordinary Tuesday night. The restaurant was busy, but not packed. It was easy to find parking when we showed up around 6:40pm. When we left around 8pm, all spots were taken. So, something to keep in mind. Also, the parking spaces are tight.\\n\\nHere's what we went with:\\n\\n* Queso Tradicional ($5, chico size) - No Mas! custom blend of melted white cheeses\\n* Spiced Pineapple Margarita ($9) - Roca Patron Silver, Patron Citronge Pineapple, pineapple & orange juice spiced with cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg\\n* Los Trios Combinaciones ($15) - seasoned beef taco, seasoned chicken enchilada with mole sauce, pork tamale, refried beans, and poblano rice\\n* Fish Fajitas Arracheras ($18) - fried pollack, flour tortillas, poblano rice, frijoles puercos, guacamole, pico de gallo, cheese, and sour cream\\n* Sopapillas ($6) - homemade Mexican puff pastries, served hot, tossed in cinnamon sugar and drizzled with honey\\n\\nGenerally, meh to okay describes the food. The tastiest thing was probably the complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were fresh and crispy and the salsa was flavorful. Mild, a little bit runny, and good. The queso was A-OK though there was nothing memorable about it.\\n\\nThe Spiced Pineapple Margarita was yummy. It was sweet and I could hardly taste the alcohol. It reminded me of apple cider, but an alcoholic version. That's the best way to describe it.\\n\\nThe Los Trios Combinaciones was fairly unremarkable. In general, the food on this plate seemed to be lacking flavor or \\"oomph.\\" I thought the food was satisfactory, but my fiancee thought it was sad. Nothing was bad to me, but I didn't think anything was particularly tasty or tasty enough for me to want to come back and order it again. The taco, which was served in a soft flour shell, came with plenty of meat. The beans were plain. Some cheese on top would've helped.\\n\\nNo Mas! offers chicken, steak, shrimp, veggie, and fish fajitas. With the fish fajitas, the fish is served fried, not grilled (we were expecting grilled). In typical fajita fashion, the skillet was served sizzling hot, onions and peppers on bottom, fried fish fillets on top with sides of rice, a whole jalapeno, three warm flour tortillas (corn also an option), and a plate of beans, sour cream, pico de gallo, guac, and shredded cheese. The fish fajitas were fine, but they could've been a lot better. The fish didn't have much flavor. The breading was soft and a bit soggy, not crispy, and the veggies underneath had no char. The other ingredients were par for the course.\\n\\nThe sopapillas were average at best. The pastries essentially amounted to deep-fried tortillas. Along with cinnamon sugar and honey, there was whipped cream in the middle. These looked better than they tasted. Can't say I recommend them.\\n\\nOur server was Brionna and she did a good job. She was polite, friendly, and attentive.\\n\\nTL;DR - If you're looking for casual Mexican food in Atlanta, I'd recommend a local chain like La Fonda or La Parrilla before I'd recommend No Mas!

Sister restaurant to Blue Water, I was excited to finally try this one! We made reservations for a Tuesday dinner and they were fully booked until 8. Luckily we were seated a tad earlier but the restaurant was very busy! Here's my review: \\n\\nFood:\\n- Kale salad: I loved the presentation on this, the salad itself was really good but could have done without the peanuts on top \\n- beef carpaccio: was good but so thinly sliced that half of it was stuck to the plate \\n- bone in ribeye: wish we ordered this medium rare, still very yummy (make sure to ask for side dipping salts for extra flavour!) \\n- gnocchi: this dish was just ok - was underwhelmed and the coloring threw me off \\n- mushroom risotto: good but nothing special \\n- chocolate lava cake: this was so yummy! Comes with salted caramel ice cream and passion fruit sauce which helps cut the sweetness \\n\\nInterior: \\n- the interior is beautiful, and spacious\\n- music was a tad loud so it was difficult to talk amongst ourselves at the table \\n- loved that they had Japanese style toilets! (Automatically opens and toilet seat is warmed - like in Japan) \\n\\nService: \\n- service was excellent, our server was very knowledgeable and friendly \\n\\nOverall the experience was wonderful.

I couldn't pull it off on my last visit so I made an extra effort this trip to Portland. So we called in on Saturday to see if we could get the first seating reservations at 9am on Sunday... Not.. We were however told we could call in at 8am and add our names to the waiting list would would allow us to be seating after the first line.  What??? So we did call and got on that list not understanding and still showed at 8:30am and got in the line that went around the building and down the street. Good thing we did, because the list really doesn't matter it seems. They seat everyone in line before even looking at the list I guess. WEIRD, but whatever.\\n\\nLOCATION & AMBIANCE (Rating 2.75)\\nThe place is old, not well kept and nothing is notable or enjoyable about the location or seating. More would be good and I can't believe with this much success that they haven't handled that.\\n\\nSERVICE (Rating 5)\\nThe people and service we encountered were great! Very knowledgeable and helpful with the menu. As we approached the front of the line they even took our names and phone number again and suggested we go down the street to a local coffee shop and wait so we could be comfortable. They texted us when they were ready for us. \\n\\nCHICKEN & WAFFLE (Rating 4.5)  (Rating 5.0 with Gravy) Let me explain...\\nFirst.. SHARE THIS DISH!  So the waffles are sweet potato waffles. Yum. There are 3 sliced chicken breasts that are breaded, dipped and fried to perfection stacked on top of the waffle. This is WAY OVERBOARD. Extremely difficult to eat all three even if you're starving. The breading is extremely pepper laced and has an exceptional taste, not overly greasy and very crunchy making it some of the best breading I've tasted. However, the sweetness of just syrup poured over the waffle with the spices didn't cut it for me. Instead, I ordered a side of their sausage gravy which was awesome. Dipping the waffle with chicken in the gravy made this dish perfect for me and I'd highly recommend it as 5 of the 6 people at our table agreed it made this dish better than their version.\\n\\nFRITTER (Rating 3)\\nThere are about 6 fritters in the order so you won't be disappointed there. The fritters  not sweet, have a bit thicker dough it seemed than a doughnut and fried skin was softer than I would have liked. Additionally, the sauce they serve it with is not nearly enough. Ask for more when it's delivered.\\n\\nPRALINE BACON. (Rating 2.75)  I was so bummed with the bacon. The reviews were amazing so maybe I just got a bad batch. It was MUCH too greasy and the Pralines were so thickly caked on that it overpowered and over-sweetened the taste in my opinion."},{"name":"Domino's Pizza","address":"1931 E Oltorf St","city":"Austin","stars":"2","text":"Tragic.

I ordered the truffle penne which came with steak, broccolini, garlic, shallots, and bacon tossed with penne in a white truffle scented parmesan cream finished with tomato. Overall I liked the pasta and the only complaints I had were that the steak cubes were very large which resulted in them being hard to eat and there was too much parmesan which made it hard to melt on top of the pasta. My boyfriend got the twigs signature burger which came with half pound angus beef with honey cured bacon, lettuce, tomato, crispy onions, white cheddar, and lemon garlic aioli on a brioche bun and fries. He said that the burger had the right amount of flavor and the ingredients seemed fresh. My mom got the works pizza which came with herb infused marinara, pepperoni and Italian sausage, mozzarella, mushrooms, red and green bell peppers, tomatoes finished with fresh basil. She said that the pizza dough was very good compared to other places and that there was just enough of each ingredient where one didn't overpower the other. My stepdad ordered the fish and chips.

Had to buy a whole brisket to go with our lunch order to be able to do that.  But they gave us a 1/2 hour window for pick up and when we showed up early, they were happy to oblige.  They cut their meats to order so we still had to wait 30 minutes for our order.

The people there are super friendly.  It's definitely very organized - not their first rodeo for sure!\\n\\nThe food:  No knife necessary!!  The brisket is so tender you can just pull it apart and it tastes like no other with a spice crust on the outside packed with flavor.  I'd like to think I know how to make a good brisket, and I do, but this was sensational.  Although we did try the sauce options, it really needed no adornment to enjoy it's true flavor.  We tried the pork ribs and they were also delectable, falling off the bone tender.  Their beans were great, cole slaw ok, pickles good and wonder bread that accompanies your order, a must to make it all complete!  We even tried their banana bourbon tart - albeit much later in the day - and it was also delish!!\\n\\nYep, it's worth the hype.

Anyone who has read my review of the 6th street location knows I love Little Woodrow's, so you can take or leave my review of it.  I was accused of being an owner of Little Woodrow's, I'm not, but if I could buy stock in it I would. \\n\\nFirst let me say Little Woodrow's is a chain.  It is based out of Houston, I think the first one was in Bellaire.  I know yelpers hate chains, I don't.  I think if something is good, there should be more of them. Of course I am biased too. My Pops runs Burger Kings in Houston. A chain paid for my 13 years at UT.\\n\\nI'm not a southie, and this location is south south, like Buda south almost.  I was on I-35 headed south, and I realized - shit I dunno where this place is.  Was it Stassney? No South Park Meadows is further south than Stassney. I made the mistake of exiting William Cannon because I didn't want to pass it up.  About 33 minutes later I finally made it through the light at 35 and William Cannon.  Jebus, that is one damn long light. \\n\\nTo my surprise South Park Meadows, the huge field where I saw Ziggy Marley, the Black Crowes, and numerous music festivals, is now a gi-normous strip mall.  There is a super target, a walmart I think, every big box store you can think of. I drove around the damn place for another 30 minutes looking for Little Woodrow's. \\n\\nI finally gave up and called Little Woodrow's on Sixth for help. It was easy because I have them on speed dial on my phone. What? You don't have your bar on speed dial on your phone?  No? Oh so I'm a drunk just because I have my favorite pub on speed dial on my phone?  Does it make it worse that it goes in order, my wife, my sister, my pub 1,2,3? I suppose I'm a bigger drunk because The Texas Showdown is #4 huh?  Seriously, quit judging me! \\n\\nWell it turns out I had passed it entirely. It is right on Slaughter behind the Chick Fil-A.  I was fully prepared not to like it, seriously I was. I freakin hate strip centers.  But although, Little Woodrow's South is in a strip center it is at the end of one, in a little wooded part, that seems like its own beer park.  \\n\\nOut front there is a huge sign that says LITTLE WOODROW'S and there is this pretty patio with seating on a couple levels and there is a huge bonfire pit right in the middle of it. The inside looks sort of like the north location but the long bar is over on the left and there is seating to the right. \\n\\nI counted 9 big booths inside, 16 little tables for 4, 9TV's hangin inside, plus a 150 sq ft screen that comes down for UFC and football, plus 2 flat screens over the bar. \\n\\nThey have all the same specials as the other LW's. Sunday Night is best $2.50 any draft, Mondays is $2 any Texas beer, Tuesdays is Big Ass Beer (Lone star 23oz $1.75), Wednesdays is $3 wine night(This is new to this locations) Thursdays is Giant Mug Night (25oz Lone Star $3.) and Steak Night. Saturdays is u-call it night at the bar.  Unless you are getting a better deal, Lone Star is always $2 though. \\n\\nThey say have 33 beers on tap and 100 different beers total.  Also they have $10 buckets of beer during longhorn games.  They also say they will show all UFC events, and have every package, NFL Sunday Ticket, NBA, NCAA,  MLB, and NBA.  They did not get MLB for this season, because there is only one month left. But they will next year. \\n\\nOk, back to my trip.  I get out of the car, and the manager \\"W\\" sees me and screams \\"Don's in the house!\\"  Which made me feel welcome. I saw 2 waitresses that had moved from the Central Location, \\"J\\" and \\"L\\". I said hi to them.  Then I walked up to the bar to get a Lone Star. \\n\\nA funny thing happened.....two minutes later I was still standing at the bar and I didn't have a lone star.  They were just busy, 1st day open and all. Then a bartender walked up to me and looked at me, and finally asked \\"can I help you? \\" I said, \\"I'll take one.\\"  And she looked at me weird. So to help her out I put up my hand with my index finger out to indicate \\"one.\\"  She still looked at me weird. Finally the poor girl says, \\"One what?\\" \\n\\nHahahaha, they don't know you here Don, you freakin moron.  You actually have to say, \\"One Lone Star please.\\"  Hahahaha, \\n\\nI get my beer and wander outside for a smoke.   Anyways I follow the wall around the back and guess what is there?  A big sign that says LITTLE WOODROW'S BACK YARD!  What sweet heaven is this?  A Little Woodrow's with a back yard?  Yup yup, it is true. They have some tables out there, and get this......Washers!

Just fantastic Southern food, there's no other way to describe it.  Screen Door has earned its reputation.  When I told people I was going to Portland, I had more than one person tell me to go to Screen Door, so that was the first meal I had when I got to town.  Very glad I took their advice.\\n\\nFirst of all, I hear there's always a wait.  Always.  And, it's in a neighborhood where parking is at a premium.  My brother got out and and got us on the list while I drove around for at least 10 minutes, closer to 15, looking for a spot.  Finally got one about 2 blocks away and waited outside.  It was a great day, so no issues with the wait.  As people slowly made their way into the restaurant, we went inside and sat on the benches.  We were called after 35 minutes, which was right in the heart of the 30-45 minute time we were quoted.\\n\\nWe knew at least one of us (ended up being my mother) was ordering chicken and waffles.  That was decided prior to arrival.  We decided to go with the pimento cheese and the glazed breakfast hush puppies.  The pimento cheese comes with sesame crackers and veggies for dipping.  It was fantastic, just like you'd get in the south.  It was creamy and cheesy but the red pepper flavor was strong as well.  It's not spicy, but very flavorful.  Even though we knew we had a large lunch ahead of us, we ate all of the pimento cheese.  Likewise, the breakfast hush puppies, stuffed with cheese and bacon, then topped with the sugar cane glaze and powdered sugar were fantastic.  Crispy, but not too dense on the inside.  You could taste every ingredient.  My son loved these, he ate 2 by himself.  \\n\\nFor my entree, I went with the catfish po' boy and mac n cheese.  I also tried some of the famous chicken and waffles.  The catfish is fried perfectly and has that classic cornmeal crust.  Additionally, the filets are large and juicy, they aren't skinny and dried out, which happens too often with fried catfish.  They are served simply on a soft roll with mayo, pickles, and lettuce.  Very simple, no fancy remoulades or anything.  But, it's probably the best po' boy I've eaten.  The bread withstands the ingredients well, and the catfish is fantastic.  I'll have a hard time not ordering this again, despite my desire to try other items at Screen Door.  The mac n cheese was crusty and cheesy on top and cooked to a nice al dente.  The sauce was seasoned well, it wasn't just a cheese overload.  Another re-order.  \\n\\nThe chicken and waffles is as good as you've heard.  A fluffy, pillowy waffle with a slight crunch to it, topped with boneless chicken breasts and syrup.  It's a classic dish, and this is the best version of it I've had.  The chicken may be the best fried chicken I've ever eaten.  This is impressive, because it's a chicken breast rather than a fattier (and more flavorful) piece like the thigh.  The chicken is heavily, but not too heavily, seasoned with salt and pepper.  There is so much pepper it may seem spicy at first, but once you've had a couple of bites, you get used to it, and you crave more.  The breading is just the right thickness and it's also seasoned well.  As full as I was, as we were leaving, I saw someone receive an order of chicken and waffles, and I immediately got hungry again.  After all I'd eaten, I probably could have eaten that entire plate.\\n\\nWe sat outside on the porch.  The picnic tables are sturdy and were comfortable.  Service was fantastic.  Our waitress was very friendly, was great with my 5 year old son, and was quick to offer suggestions (I couldn't decide between shrimp and catfish for my sandwich, she advised catfish and I was appreciative).  Given this place's reputation, the service could coast on the strength of the cuisine and people would still eat here, but our server was fantastic.  \\n\\nOther than the wait, and I would have waited longer, I can't think of anything I would change about the meal.  Can't wait to return to Portland and Screen Door.  6 stars."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"It's an experience you have to do once in your life.

My partner had the black bean burger at just a couple dollars less.  It fell apart on first bite, was also on a hard stale bun and was served with completely inedible rubbery oily potato chips.

Like when you walk into a store that's going out of business. They weren't displayed nicely and there weren't enough to fill the shelves. Most of the store are bulk candy with little Chinese food style cartons to fill up and at least those looked nice. \\n\\nHowever there are no signs about pricing on any of the displays.

No \\"I'll be right with you\\" or \\"Just a moment please.\\" Honestly if I hadn't promised a toddler the candy I would have just left. I felt like I was bothering her and she made me feel that way and barely said anything to me as I paid for almost $5 of a handful of chocolate gummi bears and a few gum balls that when we tried them felt stale. My daughter couldn't chew the gum balls at all and I threw the rest out. By the way, they didn't taste like champagne or any flavor other than bubble gum. I guess people buy them because they look pretty.\\n\\nJust avoid this tourist trap with their dead-eyed endorsing celebrity photos eating their stale candy on the outside. I can't imagine actually eating here seeing how much these employees hate being here and clearly hate dealing with customers and were so inconsiderate as to not have any signage, greet and thank customers, and to crank up the music to an unacceptable volume.

The interior is quite spacious and there's plenty of light coming in the windows.\\n\\nOn my first visit, I ordered the Bun Cha Ca or Fish Cake Vermicelli ($10.25). This dish is probably more famously known in Vancouver from the appropriately named Bun Cha Ca Hoang Yen on Victoria drive. When the bowl arrived at my table, the aroma of the fresh dill was quite noticeable. The clear broth has a distinctive tomatoey flavour so it's much lighter than your typical pho dish.\\n\\nOverall, not bad. However, I found that the thin rice vermicelli noodles didn't compare to the one I had at Hoang Yen.\\n\\nOn my next visit, I tried their Spring Rolls ($5.25) and Banh Mi Dac Biet ($5.50). Based on the pictures in the menu, I wasn't expecting too much for the spring rolls but I was pleasantly surprised when they brought it out and saw that they used a rice paper wrapper. These freshly fried spring rolls crisped up nicely.\\n\\nTheir special banh mi had all of the things that make for a good banh mi sandwich... nice crusty roll, crunchy pickled veggies, a variety of sliced meats as well as pate... love how it all works together.\\n\\nOn my next visit, I ordered the Shrimp and Pork Salad Rolls ($5.75) and Tapioca Dumplings ($8). I've had salad rolls before and the version here was pretty good and I liked their peanut sauce. However, I've never tried tapioca dumplings before... I was intrigued by the picture in the menu. These small minced pork and prawn dumplings and encased in sticky and chewy (in a good way) translucent tapioca and then wrapped in banana leaves. It's a bit difficult to eat without getting your fingers sticky but I actually enjoyed the mochi-like texture with the savory meat in the filling.\\n\\nOn my next visit, I ordered the Shrimp and Pork Salad Rolls ($5.75) and Tapioca Dumplings ($8).

However, prices are still fairly reasonable. I ordered the Com Dac Biet or Pho Nam Special Rice ($11.50) with gives you an option on your choice of protein. With the dish, you get a beautifully fried egg with crispy edges and a runny yolk, tender lemongrass chicken, and a crispy spring roll.\\n\\nI figured it was time that I finally try one of their traditional pho dishes so I ordered the Rare Beef, Flank, and Tendon ($10). It came with beautifully rare beef on top of the noodles with big pieces of tender tendon and slices of flank in a clean and subtle broth. While the flank was a bit dry, I really enjoyed the rare beef (it's not often that I find rare beef in pho that is actually rare).\\n\\nSo, overall, there are some pretty good comforting Vietnamese dishes here and it's a welcome addition to the neighbourhood."},{"name":"J Christophers","address":"250 E Ponce De Leon Ave","city":"Decatur","stars":"3","text":"This is the second location I've tried since I've been in ATL.

Although I ordered a King cut prime rib which was loaded with fat and gristle, my review is more about the awful customer service by the manager than about the bad prime rib.  When I mentioned to my server that for $27 there was an awful lot of fat and gristle that I could not eat, she called over the manager.  The manager then proceeded to ARGUE with me that the meat comes that way.  I told her I could only eat a portion of the meat and she said she would not do anything to fix the problem.  I said well that's too bad as I feel this is not worth $27.  She walked away and then someone else came over, arguing with me AGAIN that the meat is fine.  It's suppose to be like that.  I am well aware a king cut has a bone but half the meat fat and gristle?  And then to have the manager be rude on top of it?  There is certainly a better way to handle things.  With all the other customer service oriented restaurants in Billerica, this is the last time we will eat at Stelios.  Too bad.  It used to be nice. Being in the restaurant business myself I KNOW this is not the way to treat a customer.   Apparently management does not care to make their customers happy and welcomed.

However, I do think it is important to provide a review that would strengthen the quality of service. I went to the restaurant today, especially the bar, to meet with a few friends. The bartender took about 20 minutes to make the \\"quick fix\\". I asked another bartender, and she went to him to bring an already prepared drink (that he did not bring). It was difficult to get his attention, and it seemed that he was actually pretty attentive to other tables. Moreover, our group was big, and when I asked for separate checks, he seemed frustrated. In other words, the customer service was poor today, and I felt targeted, disappointed, and I don't know if I will feel like going to this place again. Perhaps, Alden and Harlow should invest in training their bartenders to appropriately treat all customers well and in a timely manner.

The biscuit was everything you wanted: dense, moist, and sturdy enough to hold up Mt. Grit-manjaro. \\n\\nThe grits, oh the grits. Even my mom loved them. The pimento cheese was melted creamy goodness mixing well with the salty bacon and ham. My only suggestion would be to cook the egg a little less so that the yolk is runny and mixes with the other grits and and pimento cheese. \\n\\nOf course, I couldn't leave without dessert. They had the Carmel bacon Poptarts and I also got the salted Carmel Snickerdoodle cookie bar. Plus, I got the Nutella iced coffee. A bit much, you say? Maybe but it's my birthday and I was going all in. The bacon Poptart was sweet/savory combo that was good. I would have liked more sweet. But the Snickerdoodle bar was A-Mazing! Pop a scoop of ice cream on that thing...world peace would probably happen. \\n\\nObviously Se7en Bites is well loved and I'm happy that my mom and I have made it a tradition to visit on our birthday. So check it out! Make sure to try their desserts. If you go for lunch, I highly recommend the The Southern. It's made me re-evaluate my Northern distrust of grits and pimento. Now about fried chicken..."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Be warned--this place is addictive!\\n\\nWe had a great brunch at Screen Door. We waited ~45 minutes for our table, which wasn't a problem because there is a ton to do in this area (check out Kopi Coffee nearby!). Once seated, our service was really fast, and our waitress was super friendly. \\n\\nFor starters, we ordered the bacon and the lemon corn fritters. The bacon was coated in nuts and brown sugar and was wonderful but very rich. One order is probably enough for your party. The fritters were in place of the hushpuppies, a favorite of our local Portland friends, which are no longer on the menu. Our friends said they tasted about the same. They came with this phenomenal lemon sauce that made this entree last about twenty seconds on the table. \\n\\nFor entree, we ALL ordered the chicken and waffles. My friends assured me it was the right choice...and they were right. \\n\\nNow, I'm a huge eater, and expected that the three piece chicken on waffles would be the perfect amount. But let me tell you, this chicken is massive. I was only able to finish one and a half pieces, and rest was my dinner for last night. The chicken is fried and very filling, so be warned that you will have leftovers!\\n\\nOverall, loved the atmosphere and all the food we ordered.

When we pulled up and valeted the car my initial impression was, \\"Wow, this place looks pretty cool.\\" I loved the speak-easy vibe when we were greeted at the door, carded and headed down stairs.  Once we got down, granted it was a slow Sunday there was no one there to guide us to a seat or to the bar.  The place was empty except for the bar so we just looked at each other and said, \\"Okay, bar it is\\". \\n\\nAs we sat ourselves, I noticed no TV's, which I guess is fine since I think they are going for that traditional speak-easy vibe, but still a miss in my opinion.  First things I noticed were the bar was a mess.  Having worked in this industry, I was shocked since I assumed they'd be putting their best foot forward having just opened, the bar was already very scratched up, and there were no hooks to hang my purse or umbrella (I always notice that).  Menus were tossed across the back bar, bottles littered the counters too.  We were greeted by the bartender, who was very nice, he made me an excellent Grey Hound and the bf ordered a beer.  They don't have anything on tap which my bf noticed and was disappointed about.  We decided to then order, I was pretty confused when looking at the menu, nothing is outlined as an appetizer or entr√©e, so we just assumed what was what.  The menu was also small and fairly foreign to us, we both safely choose the two pasta dishes and were pleasantly surprised, they turned out great-expensive, but tasty. \\n\\nNow what I was so disappointed in was as we sat and ate, there were non-stop distractions going on behind the bar.  There were probably a totally of 4 or 5 people behind the bar cleaning and talking amongst each other.  As our meals were placed in front of us, I believe one of the bar backs came over and started cleaning-running continuous water, pulling up grates, moving bottles.  There were bottles everywhere. All we wanted to do at that point was finish and leave, I almost felt like I was in the way.  I noticed the couple to my right who were enjoying a few drinks, had leftover beer bottles just sitting in front of them, why all the trash?? The mess and distractions alone killed the experience, and in truth I go out and choose a place based on the food but equally important the environment and experience!  While the food wasn't bad, I'll probably never go back here.  It was expensive and the experience was pretty bad."},{"name":"Ok Omens","address":"1758 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The previous incarnation of this cafe came highly recommended, so we had high hopes for Ok Omen.

Other descriptions are equally enlightening. (Look at their on line menu for equally absurd prose.) \\nThe food menu was small, but interesting. The beignets stuffed with Tillamook cheddar were excellent when warm. We ordered them a second time but received them quite late and couldn't enjoy them. The eggplant was unremarkable. We substituted impossible burgers in their touted signature burger. The burger patties were meaty as promised, but the toppings were quite pedestrian, including what appeared and tasted like a slice of processed American cheese, iceberg lettuce, dill pickles, chopped grilled onions and sliced onions (see photo). \\nThe service was odd and abysmal.

Yelp friends, food websites, Social media, etc.  All of them had glowing reviews.  However, most of them had a common theme:  long waits.  Now, I've been known to wait in long lines for food before (the 85C Bakery opening is still champ at a wait time of 6 hours and 45 minutes!).  However, with such limited time in Portland, I didn't really want to do that.\\n\\nWell, on our 1 Saturday morning there, we drove by just to see how long the line was, and also, it was on the way to our alternate breakfast choice.  Well, at 9:07am, 7 minutes after they opened, the line was about 5 deep.  I immediately made a sharp left turn on 24th and asked my wife to wait in line while I found parking.  It must've been my lucky day, because right after making another right on Couch St, I found parking.  I was willing to walk a bit, but I'm not complaining!\\n\\nWe probably waited another  1/2 hour for our table, but when reviews frequently mention 2-hour waits on the weekends,  1/2 hour is a breeze!  They originally put us at a table, but after we ordered they asked if we could move to a booth, so they could accompany a big party.  No big deal.  In fact, the booth was more comfortable.  \\n\\nFor the food, me and my wife got Huevos Rancheros, Shrimp and Grits, Fried Chicken and Waffles, Praline Bacon, and some TUMS, obviously!  Yeah, we ordered too much.  But, that wasn't the worst part.  The worst was that we actually finished it.  Ok fine, so Chicken and Waffles was only a 1-pc and the bacon wasn't served with anything else, but still!  That was a lot of food for 2 people!  \\n\\nMy favorite is either the Chicken and Waffles or Praline Bacon.  I used to love Chicken and Waffles when I first had it maybe 20 years ago.  However, there are way too many variations of it now and the flavors always seem muddled.  Not here.  The chicken was perfectly seasoned and cooked and was just so incredibly juicy.  The sweet potato waffle was a great spin on the classic and was extremely light and fluffy.\\n\\nNow, for that praline bacon.  I knew it was going to be good, but not THAT good!  First off, it's a little off putting with all those pecans encrusting the bacon.  Second, the bacon is a little on the soggy side.  But, it's all uphill from there!  The pecans and brown sugar, contrast but don't contradict, the saltiness of the bacon.   The bacon is thick cut, which helps prevent the toppings overpowering the dish.  Also, the bacon is smoked and they add just a touch of cayenne.  \\n\\nThe Huevos Rancheros and Shrimp and Grits were good, too.  Just not as good as the other dishes.  The service, on the other hand, was fantastic!  But, maybe that's a Portland thing in general, because the whole trip, everywhere we went, people were super nice!"},{"name":"The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar","address":"Universal Citywalk - Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Sushi marries up nicely with the burgers at this joint.

I pulled out my phone which had the email confirmation for the date, time, and the fact that we had 1 WHEELCHAIR bound person with us. When she got her manager he explained we were not in their system and there was nothing he could do. I again, showed my phone and explained we made a reservation and had the confirmation to prove it. He then went on to tell me there was no room and he could not accommodate us. I said we were willing to wait, but he insisted he had NOTHING the rest of the night. REALLY, NOTHING?! Mind you, I can see multiple open tables as I am speaking to him. I explained that since we had a guest in a wheelchair it was extremely DIFFICULT to walk around the city, especially the North End area and find a restaurant to accommodate handicapped accessibility. Long story short, the argument lasted about 5-7 minutes and I am still appalled he wouldn't try to figure something out for us being with a handicap customer. He finally gave in and gave us a table after a male stepped in and started criticizing his management on the situation.

We have always enjoyed the food as well as the friendly staff. Since we no longer live close to Louisville anymore we haven't visited Zucca for sometime. We decided to go last evening, a Saturday night, and we had 7:00 reservations. While we had a small wait, we were seated at a 4-top table within 10 minutes of arriving. Our waitress was attentive. We noticed many new faces including the floor manager. It was a busy place, and we did wait for our appetizer, which was our usual, the calamari. We realized when it was placed in front of us it was over cooked. Definitely should have sent it back, however we didn't want to wait again for it. Our Ceasar salad was good, but overdressed to our liking. When my husband asked for bread, a few tiny pieces of their focaccia was served. It was stale! We were now a bit shocked at at this point. In the past, our dinners or appetizers have always been absolutely delicious.\\nDinner came, I had the pasta primavera, it was excellent. My husband enjoyed the vodka rustica pasta dish. With our dinners we each had a glass of the Barbara de Alba, however, the 2nd glass of this, which my husband enjoyed, was much better than the first. Perhaps a new bottle had been opened?\\nWhile we enjoyed our dinner, we were a bit disappointed too. However, most likely we will be back, but we won't rush back either.

The chicken was superior, fall off the bone finger licking good. But the rack of ribs were very underwhelming, it seemed like they had been under a heating lap for most of the day. The sauces packed a wollop, all have some serious heat, even the sweet stuff. The spare ribs looked bigger than the half rack of ribs. For 15 dollars the soul fire platter is two meats, two sides, cornbread and a pickle. The meat portions are a little skimpier- for your best value go for the spare ribs (meatier than the rack of ribs) and the catfish.

We showed up at 7:30 am this past Sunday morning with lawn chairs, games, breakfast, and of course, a giant cooler filled with beer. Despite this, the first member of our group was 30th in line. The wait actually wasn't too bad. Because we showed up early, we were under the shade of the stairs for the entire time so it wasn't even that hot. Our tailgating kept us entertained.

I don't know if it's because of the hype or because we were so darn hungry from waiting that whole time but my boyfriend and I ordered 4 lbs of meat  for just the two of us. With such a reputation, you can imagine the food wasn't cheap - 4 lbs of meat + small potato salad + small pecan pie came out to $80.\\n\\nAnd now for the food itself! The brisket was really really good but not as amazing as the hype (to be honest, the expectation was so high I don't know if the quality was ever going to meet it). I actually really loved the sausage and the ribs - and I don't normally like ribs. Don't bother with the pulled pork - it's only okay - or the sauces. This stuff tastes good all on it's own.

The rice was over-sauced, and the vegetables looked like they came from a Lean Cuisine TV dinner - limp and bland. Maybe that's why they had to pour a bucket of sauce on everything. The chicken was over fried and super dry that I could hardly cut it. And what basil - I didn't taste any basil flavor. That dish is worth $10 max, but they charge more than double that.

Not will this only be hands down be the best BBQ I've ever had but my experience at Franklin BBQ will go down as one of the most epic foodie adventures I've ever had...\\n\\nCame here on Sunday by myself at 2pm... food was sold out. I was in town for a business trip so I'm use to braving restaurants by myself now. Came back on Tuesday at 11:30am and the line was at least 100 people deep. My flight was at 3:30pm. Almost stepped out of line becauseI didn't bring my luggage with me and I thought I was going to miss my flight. But luckily, I befriended this cute old Asian couple in front of me. The husband offered to wait in line and for his wife to take me back to my hotel to get my luggage and to drop me off at the airport after our meal. Yes, silly me... I got into a car with a stranger but we had such a fun time! As he waited in line, the woman showed me the Asian spots in town and even got some boba.  Got back in a little under 2 hours and we were almost at the front of the line. FIST BUMP to the husband for waiting in line for us. We ordered pretty much everything on the menu: brisket, ribs, links, and pulled pork. EVERYTHING WAS FINGER-LICKING DELICIOUS! And best part, they even paid for my meal! And to top it all off, we sat down next to a girl and her grandma and they were on the way to the airport and offered to drop me off.  Yes, getting into car with more strangers... but everything just fell into place that day. It was amazing!\\n\\nSeriously though, thank you Franklin BBQ for bringing people together. Not just any people, but the nicest people ever! People who are brave enough to wait in line very long for the best BBQ ever and still not be cranky. The food is well worth the wait but the memories you make in (or in my case out of line) is that cherry on top. I wouldn't try this place on a weekend but it's not that bad on a Tuesday. When we sat down, people were still coming at 1:30 and able to get some food.\\n\\nSo moral of the story: Eat at Franklin's, make friends with people in line and order everything on the menu. For those traveling and do not have time to wait, skip the line and grab a slab of brisket to go (chilled and packed to go). I can't wait to come back and bring some friends!"},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"We just ate here and the food was very good, as usual.

The front cashier was on the phone and was more interested in talking to whoever than serving the customers. I ordered a 20 piece and usually with other wing restaurants dressing comes with the order if requested. This place Charges you a dollar for a small ounce of dressing... OMG! I said forget it! I had dressing at home (this was a take-out order).\\nWhen I got home the bag that was holding the wings was saturated with grease. I ordered the  garlic parmesan and it looked horrible. The parmesan was clumpy and did not cover most of the wings and to make matters worst I could not taste the garlic. The reason the bag holding the wings was saturated was because the wings were swimming in grease... WTF!! Someone did not shake off the grease from the fryer basket and dumped the wings strait into my container..OMG. I could barely choke down these wings.

In fact I showed up in my usual NYC uniform of black skinnies and black moto jacket..bad outfit choice as soon as the Texan sun hit us. Since we had so much time, my boyfriend ventured out to Pueblo  Viejo for breakfast tacos (awesome!) and then I went back to our hotel to change into shorts and grabbed the SPF.  \\n\\nThe \\"meat tally lady\\" (I didn't catch her name) gave our portion of the line a 4-4.5 hour wait time which I initially scoffed at, but turned out she was pretty on point (we finally sat down around 1:20pm). We hate waiting on line for anything, but when in Austin for the first time, how can one not head to Franklin? \\n\\nWe ordered 2 lbs of brisket (we got a great mix of fatty and lean cuts..both buttery and smoky) 2 lbs of ribs (just the right amount of kick, amazing crust, and fall off the bone goodness), 1/2 lb of pulled pork (great with their pickle slices and any of their table sauces) and sausage links (skippable, it had a strange fatty taste to it). \\n\\nThe guys behind the counter were amazingly friendly and surprisingly chatty for such a bustling place. We were hesitant to ask questions because we wanted to keep the line moving, but they were so good natured about not rushing anybody.

Also, when you walk in, you are immediately in a sectioned off ordering line. This works fine if you are ordering food but creates an awkward situation if you only want to go to the bakery section and don't plan to order food.

Walked in around 6:30 on a weeknight and the place was slammed. That's a good sign. \\n\\nSat on the patio and our server was swift on her approach. Sweet tea and an order of half & half fried pickles/jalapenos was in. Definitely enough for more than two people. The half order is a rather generous portion. I'm a fan, too. How can you not be? It's pickled and fried! The ranch dipping sauce is a little runnier than I would have liked, but I'm not a large proponent of ranch in the first place. Think the pickles/jalapenos are great on their own. \\n\\nFor my entree: Six smoked wings and the \\"Fox-A-Roni.\\" Wow. Just wow. The wings themselves are tender and aren't overtly smoky. The subtle flavor is perfect and matches the sauce wondrously. Oh, yeah. That sauce? Simply bad-ass. Enough sweet, smoky, spicy, and perky that has me doing a celebratory dance. I'd eat that off of an old shoe...or my foot, for that matter. That wing sauce is a textbook approach to making my palate a happy camper. Also, as I'm sure many chicken wing lovers would agree, smoking chicken wings is like a breath of fresh air. It honestly makes them more enjoyable for a longer period of time and the flavors tend to be less harsh on your palate. Well played, Fox Bros. \\n\\nWife had the pimiento cheese sandwich.

They got the student special (burger and beer)  and I was still on my chili cheese fries quest so I got the cheese and gravy fries and onion rings.  Service was pretty good.  Nothing noteworthy, he was just a dependable guy.  From what I heard, the burgers were pretty good (sorry, I cannot remember what they got).  Beer was good.  Cheese and gravy was alright - the gravy could have been tastier (it seemed like it was from those instant gravy packages) and thicker.  It was a bit watery and made my fries mushier faster.  Otherwise, still a good time.\\n\\n2 - Take out!  Their mint-chocolate shake was terrible.  Very minty, but it had chocolate chips that threatened to kill me after I tried to suck it through the straw too hard.  =[  The chili cheese (yes, I'm obsessed) dog didn't travel too well back to my place (chilicheese e'erywhere) but it was still delicious.  \\n\\n3 - Take out! Sack of cheezburgers.  I'm not sure if I was just hungry or what, but they were the best plain burgers I've ever had.  Kind of soggy bun with everything falling out of the burger, but it was still delicious.  Cooked mid-rare served with lettuce and tomato.  Yum.  I'm craving one now.\\n\\nOverall, it's a solid burger place near Fenway.  Way better than any fastfood burger, but don't expect to be wowed by presentation.

They offered some free appetizers and set reservations, which they don't normally do. So we agreed. \\n\\nWe tried the crab Rangoon dip and Parmesan truffle fries. Neither is us really cared for the crab dip, but the fries were extra delicious. In my first review I forgot to mention how much my wife loved the fries. She hates shoestring fries (what they do at cowfish), but the seasoning and toppings were so good that she told me they were \\"stab someone in the hand with a fork for stealing a fry\\" good. \\n\\nTonight's drinks were a Moscow mule and the margarita. The mule was nothing special, but the margarita sure was top shelf quality. When my wife asked for sugar instead of salt, the waiter told us that they didn't \\"rim\\" it...not necessary when you only use quality ingredients. He was right. \\n\\nThe entrees were a fusion bento  box and the veggie burger. The veggie burger is clearly house made and very thick. It was different than any veggie burger I've ever had, which I suspect was due mostly to whatever they used to bind it. It was well prepared and tasty, albeit a little dry without some condiments.\\n\\nThe bento box was definitely a unique experience. The mini burger (aka slider) was cooked well done, but its basically impossible to cook a slider any other way. It was a basic burger, but tasty. The sushi, I had the firecracker (Shrimp tempura, kani inside coated with tempura flakes, topped with yellowtail, and salmon), was clearly made with fresh fish and packed a lot of flavor. I'm not a huge fan of fried components of sushi, but that roll came recommended and it was good. The sides (edamame , sweet potato fries, and Thai cucumbers) were the highlight of the box. The sweet potato fries are ok, but the cucumbers were amazing and very unique. The edamame was the same as at any restaurant, seasoned in the shell but flavorless once you shell them. \\n\\nI would recommend having a larger build your own bento box option. I would have been willing to pay more to get a box with burgushi, regular sushi (all rolls of my choice), a custom slider, and sides of my choice. \\n\\nOverall our second experience was much better than the first. It's probably a 3.5 star place, but the commitment to service by the management and the fact that this location is inside a theme park warrants the push to 4 stars.

Our server was bussing a table about 5 feet away but never said anything and didn't greet us upon arrival, so we said \\"do we seat ourselves?\\" and the response was \\"Yes, anywhere you like is fine\\". We've been to hundreds of self-seating restaurants and this was the first where we were virtually ignored.\\n\\nUpon seating in one of the booths by the front window, my 2 year old daughter dropped a toy on the floor.

So far, I was totally willing to overlook the slow start.\\n\\nThe next 15 minutes were fairly uneventful, until our food started to arrive. Our server dropped off our pizza. However, there were no plates on the table and there were only two place sittings for our family of four. So she apologized and said she was going to go get our plates and the pizza spatula. Only she went behind the counter and delivered a glass of wine to another table instead. About three minutes later, she came back to our table and asked how everything was, despite the fact that the entire pizza was still on the tray with not a single bite eaten. Then she realized \\"Oh, I'm so sorry, I forgot the plates. I'll get them right away.\\" Only a new table sat down at that very minute and instead of grabbing our plates, SHE WENT AND GREETED HER NEW TABLE AND GOT THEIR DRINK ORDER. My wife had to go to the counter to get the plates. \\n\\nIn all honesty, this might be the worst service I have ever received at a restaurant. Who does this? \\n\\nNow, the funny thing about this experience is that the pizza is pretty good. Not the best I've ever had by a long stretch, but pretty good for central florida. Not too doughy, pretty tasty sauce, nice texture. Unfortunately, my wife could not say the same thing about her toasted ham and cheese sub, which had about one slice of ham in it and was about 95% bread. Regardless, you go to Jerry's for pizza and the pizza was pretty good. Unfortunately, we will never be back to experience it in the future."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I hate waiting in lines for anything...but I will wait in line for this ramen!

If you want hip fusiony deliciousness at a slightly higher end, you probably can't do better in the area than Alden & Harlow."},{"name":"Boston Shawarma","address":"315 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This is by far the worst Shawarma place I've been to. I got a chicken and fries shawarma and the meat was dry af. Not much flavor in the shawarma. Never will go back. Also the cost was $9 and def not worth it. Do not go herez"},{"name":"Boston Shawarma","address":"315 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Found this place as I was headed to the Museum of Fine Arts. Great home cooked food and great prices. Well worth the trip. This place is cash only."},{"name":"Pirates Dinner Adventure","address":"6400 Carrier Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"The food was not the best. I was expecting a different menu as listed on the web site.  Yukon gold potatoes was listed.  We had mashed potatoes and a mix vegetable.  I'm sure the potatoes were instant and the vegetables frozen.  The chicken was okay but had no seasoning.  Dessert was a brownie with powdered sugar.  I'm sure it was store bought and they added powdered sugar.  Salad was warm and only one type of dressing.  The performers were mediocre at best.  First mate was very entertaining.  Purple pirate was entertaining and orange pirate was talented.  Mermaid was also talented.  My 3 year old grandson enjoyed and that's what mattered the most.  Price was expensive for food.  We we expecting much more since we were in Orlando."},{"name":"Hei La Moon","address":"88 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Went with a local friend who said this was one of his top spots. During the weekday lunch we were sat on the street level. It was surprisingly busy with so many carts of goodies running around. Of course the parking was insane but it was still a great experience. I would highly recommend stopping in."},{"name":"Tapestry","address":"69 Kilmarnock St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Fantastic service...from the hostess to the waitress. Ambience in the restaurant section was spectacular -- enclosed glass fireplace, quiet without being boring, and nice lighting. A good example for others restaurants to follow."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"We hadn't been there for a while but we are so glad we visited again.  I had the fried chicken entre this time, OMG, how did they maintain the moistness in their chicken breast? Delicious, spicy and the crunchy coating was excellent. My wife had the jambalaya and she loved it. We also enjoyed the appetizers, spicy pimento cheese dip and the hush puppies. Before I go further, there were 4 of us. LOL.  Once again, we had no room for dessert. We will be back."},{"name":"Lonesome Dove Western Bistro","address":"419 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"They have a large selection of small plates which come out surprisingly fast, too fast, to the point where they taste like they have been sitting around. Nothing to write home about."},{"name":"Tropicana Cuban Restaurant","address":"9616 N Lamar Blvd, Ste 141","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Came in this Saturday afternoon, sat at the bar for 15 minutes and was completely ignored by the bartender and waitstaff.  I was really looking forward to trying this place but I will not be going back."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This is our second time to the Screen Door.  We went last Saturday night and we knew we would have to wait.  We were seated in the outside heated patio.  The food was excellent however the service was slow!!  My husband put his empty beer glass at the end of the table and in most restaurants the wait staff realizes they should come over fairly soon.  The woman did not and when he did order another beer it was never brought.  I ordered dessert and it took over 15 minutes to bring it out.  Dessert which is pre-made shouldn't take this long to bring out."},{"name":"Sushiemon","address":"201 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Just had their sushi, usually go somewhere but decided to give this a shot. As we ordered it, picked it up, had no real interaction with the people or the interior establishment. This review is solely on the food:\\n\\nThe basic tuna roll wasn't tuna. It looked like tuna but was no tuna, it was the cheap compressed crap. And secondly it went bad, smelled horrid. After one bite, I was already sick. The spider roll was all bread no crab -- sauce was bitter with no kick at all. \\n\\nThe following hours I had an eventful 2.5 hours of hugging my toilet and wanting to die. I must have gotten insanely unlucky or this place doesn't follow sushi protocol. The fact the sushi chefs were not Japanese might have been a big hint. Won't be returning, my esophagus and anus can only take so much."},{"name":"Bao Down","address":"12 Powell Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Good food but I would suggest that not everyone appreciates your blasting hip hop music. It was a struggle to hear the women behind the counter and I could wait till I left."},{"name":"Foster Burger","address":"5339 Se Foster Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Finally had a chance to try Foster Burger, as I've been wanting to! Burger was tasty. Bottom bun was soggy... they use that red & white checkered paper inside baskets, which gets wet and red dye bleeds onto your food. I'd prefer regular plates. Our server was extremely kind. The atmosphere was interesting...a little dingy/dark. Posters of old concerts covered every inch of the walls. My 9 year old couldn't help but notice the words on the posters such as, \\"sweaty n*ppl*s,\\" and, \\"s*x,\\" and said the place should be rated R. Not sure we'll be dining in again because of this, which is a bummer because I love grass-fed burgers."},{"name":"Zucca Italian Ristorante","address":"808 Main St","city":"Louisville","stars":"4","text":"My wife and I decided on Zucca for our anniversary celebration. Good choice as it was an absolutely fantastic dinner! Our server, Steve, could not have been better. To be honest, it has been sometime since I have experienced amazing service like that. Steve was attentive, knowledgeable about everything on the menu, happy to answer our questions and most importantly to us..it felt like he invited us over for dinner! So friendly and warm, you could tell that he was proud to be a part of Three Leaf. Even Matthew the GM came by several time to congratulate us!\\nThe cuisine was outstanding. We both ordered on Steve's recommendations for dinner. Again, spot on! The salmon was delicious and cooked to perfection, The Gnocchis were perfect and served with a sauce that I literally wanted to drink! We are so lucky to have Zucca so close to home and both are thankful that we spent our evening with the staff at Zucca. I highly recommend Zucca if you want a fantastic meal with exceptional service in a restaurant that puts the guests first and truly knows what they are doing. We will be back..very soon...."},{"name":"Sunshine Diner","address":"2649 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Best breakfast I have had in Vancouver.

I ordered the combo shrimp with one cluster of snow crab it comes with corn and potatoes. I always get the mild garlic butter sauce. But next time I'm going for the juicy crab special.
