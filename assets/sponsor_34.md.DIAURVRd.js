They have separate menus for vegan, vegetarian, and meat eaters, which is great (and almost expected it seems here in Portland). I was worried for a brief moment I had made the wrong decision, since almost everyone else in my group of 7 ordered the garbage burrito. I'm not a fan of pork, so that's why I opted-out and chose the Stacy. \\n\\nWhat I liked about this burrito:\\n* The tortilla is fresh, and even though it *appears* burnt, it did not taste burnt at all. \\n* There was a generous portion of cheese, that was fully melted by the heat of the other ingredients in the burrito. I hate it when I get a clump of unmelted cheese in a burrito.\\n* They fry the onions to the right consistency, and the flavor/seasoning complimented the seasoning on the meat.\\n* There was also a generous portion of meat in there, I feel like I was served my money's worth\\n* Not super bean heavy, and while others might say the beans are \\"bland\\" I actually appreciate that. I want to taste the bean flavor, not spices that they throw on the beans. There's enough other seasoning going on in this ingredient party.\\n\\nAlso, we had a large party that ordered to go and we all paid separately, and rather than just handing each person their burrito as they came out, they synced up the cooking and gave us one wonderful paper bag full of burrito goodness. Then we could visit the sauce bar to pack up little containers of sauce to our hearts' content. I recommend packing a little container of each sauce if you're on the go so you can try them all. \\n\\nThese burritos are huge. They do have the problem/feature of being so large that you do generally get a bite of only one or two of the ingredients at a time, so if you like your burrito ingredients mixed up better, this might not be the place for you. Also, I would not consider this an \\"authentic\\" Mexican burrito at all, but that wasn't what I was looking for, and it doesn't make it less tasty to me."},{"name":"The Locus","address":"4121 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"French Toast Roulade (stuffed with triple berry compote and cream cheese and rice crispy coating.

They laid atop greasy flavorless rice with a dollop of garlic paste on the side. The meat mezze was disgraceful. The falafel was rock hard on the outside and dry and bland on the inside, the dolmade was dehydrated like it had sat under a heat lamp, the ground lamb was also dry and pathetic. The chicken was the only decent tasting meat on the platter. The tabouleh, baba ganoush and hummus were good enough. Hard to mess those up. I don't believe in yelping places out of business so when the owner very excitedly asked how I enjoyed my meal, I laid it all out uncensored. I was being polite but I didn't like the excuses he gave. He said the tenderness of the lamb depends on the vendor and that normally it melts in your mouth.

Took so long the baby got impatient that my friends husband had to leave with the baby. So we just got it to go at that rate. While that going on the manager was empathetic, which you should be. My friends pizza didn't get brought out. Server clearly didn't ring it in because you could see the manager go up to the line and call for one quickly. I watch everything when I'm out to eat. The manager went over to the server to confront her for not ringing it in. \\n\\nAfter that. We boxed our food up because our experience was ruined. \\n\\nHere's the part that gets me. When a table has broken glass and wine spilt on them, YOU COMP THE WHOLE CHECK. Not just the alcohol. That's not how it works.

We ordered a beer and it never arrived, but we weren't charged for it either, and we ended up eating so much that we wouldn't have had room for beer anyway, so no big deal.\\n\\nOn the food, I'll start out by saying that this is one of the very, very rare places in the Boston area where I've asked for a desi level of spice and actually gotten it. I understand why restaurants are hesitant to give a ton of heat to non-Indians, but it was perfect where appropriate.\\n\\nAfter a cute and tasty amuse bouche of a baby aloo bonda, flavored nicely with cumin, we started with pani puri and gobhi 65. Both were respectable, but just okay. The pani was a little heavy on tartness and short on black salt and cumin. The filling was simply cubed potatoes, but they were really tasty and spicy with lots of chili powder. Chutneys were decent. Gobhi 65 was pretty good actually, but way too salty, which made it hard to eat - otherwise the seasonings were great.\\n\\nFor an entree we split a very aromatic and flavorful shahi paneer.

A little unfair to harsh on those amongst us who ooze confidence, but every now and then, for those of us often beset by self doubt or insecurity, you just want to see those people fail.  rontoms is the bar version of one of those people.\\n\\nrontoms doesn't even have to try.  They don't bother to put a sign out front, just a silhouette painting of some guy with like a helicopter backpack contraption.  Don't get me started on the name - not Ron Tom's, not Rontom's, not even Rontoms. It's: little \\"r\\" + \\"ontoms\\", no possessive apostrophe.  Why?  Because they're cooool.  Oh, and their website - yeah, check that out.  See if you're cool enough to get the joke.  Does it provide a menu, list of events, or really ANY useful information?  Not so much, but hell, it's soooo cooool!\\n\\nOK, so enough hatin', rontoms actually is cool.  The space is wide open, but the low lighting, sunken seating area to the left of the main entrance, and loungey couch seating to the right, really make it comfy, relaxing and mellow.  Sure, when it gets crowded and hard to find a seat that \\"mellow\\" may seem elusive - but that just because you weren't cool enough to score a seat.\\n\\nThey pour a nice cocktail, and have a decent selection of beer, but again the focus is on \\"cool\\", thus Full Sail Session is the order of the day - it's way cooler than PBR nowadays.  Order a pint and the bartender (probably a cool looking, shaggy haired young man) might look askance at you, but he won't say anything...it's not cool to point out how UNCOOL a customer might be; let your own \\"cool\\" do the talking.\\n\\nThey even have a nice back patio, because we all know that enjoying a fine ciggy smoke will only get cooler now that \\"the man\\" has banned smoking indoors.\\n\\nIn fact, perhaps the only uncool thing about rontoms is the open window into the kitchen allowing you to see, and question the hygiene of, the greasy haired cook banging out those fancy mac 'n cheeses.  Then again, maybe his practiced indifference to grooming, is in fact cool...if I were cooler I'd probably know the answer.\\n\\nSo, yeah I'll definitely recommend rontoms as a cool destination, especially for pre- or post-func drinks if you're walking to/from a show at Doug Fir.  The only question is: Does rontoms have the versatility and adaptability to stay cool, or is it just a passing fad?

It's been a while since we were at Gio's - I was surprised to see only a 2-star average.  Our last visit was certainly not just \\"meh\\".  This time, we ordered the antipasto salad to share - a LITTLE disappointing in that it was just a salad-size salad (i.e., not \\"entree-sized\\") of chopped romaine, 6 roulades of ham/salami/provolone (I think), and a few kalamatas and tomato chunks ($9.99).  The nachos was a much better value (same price), even after adding another $4 for a generous sprinkling of \\"rock shrimps\\" (quite tasty!)  We almost didn't finish it because it was so humongous (good to share as an appetizer for 4 people and up).  The grilled squid was a good choice over the fried calamari, even if someone forgot to put salt in it (a few pieces slightly burnt and therefore bitter).  To be in the romantic mode, we shared a \\"fish-bowl\\" of margarita (half salted!): potent, a touch too much ice, and we should have ordered it frozen.  I don't care for the strawberry mix they used, though - tastes totally artificial.

We checked in a bit before our reservation and shortly after, they walked us in to our table in the Main Ballroom. You have a choice of a few dining rooms, the Main Ballroom, West Wing and the Rose Gallery, each with different ambiances. \\n\\nFor food, we ordered the French Onion Soup to start, Saut√©ed Shrimp and Scallops & Grilled Strip Steak for entr√©es, and The \\"Grey Stuff\\" for dessert. One thing I wanted to note was that the food comes out very quickly, we felt pretty rushed throughout the dinner, I'm guessing because they are trying to turn tables fast. \\n\\nMy girlfriend and I shared the French Onion Soup. Nothing too special, solid starter. Had we known that this was going to be one of those really rushed meals, we probably wouldn't have ordered it. Next come the entr√©es, unfortunately, they weren't offering the lamb, so I settled with the Grilled Strip Steak, steak was cooked well, comes with fries and a garlic butter. The Saut√©ed Shrimp and Scallops is actually a pasta dish, turned out a lot better than expected, I would recommend getting this dish. Finally, you have to try The \\"Grey Stuff\\", the pastry shell was a bit hard and dry, but aside from that, it was a great dessert to cap off the meal. \\n\\nOverall, you're here for the ambiance and setting, the food is average and nothing amazing about the service. We walked around the other dining rooms after our dinner was over to check out some of the collection pieces. The Beast walks through the Main Ballroom every 20-25 minutes to make an appearance and if you want to take a picture with him, there's another room that you can wait in line.                            \\n\\nNOTE: If you're planning to visit for dinner after July 27th, 2018, they will be introducing a prix fixe, 3-course menu, instead of the a la carte option."},{"name":"Mighty Fine Burgers Fries & Shakes","address":"10515 N Mo-Pac Expy, Ste 105","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Ditto to everyones review.

It's intimate and modern, and the covered patio is a great place to enjoy a breezy night.

They really know how to balance their flavors, and I appreciate how I can count on the quality of their dishes.\\n\\nI love how there's plenty of seating, which makes the restaurant quieter since everyone isn't cramped in a box of sardines, and you don't have to worry about making reservations. My party was able to walk in on a Friday night with a party of 8 and get a table immediately. I was very impressed by the service, and I have to applaud our server for automagically filling all of our water glasses, somehow appearing whenever we needed her, and taking great care of us the whole night. It was very refreshing after suffering defeat at Contigo earlier that night, where they attempted to squeeze us into a table of four. Nothx. \\n\\nOther notes: Tuesday nights is paella night, where all of their paellas are a steal at half off from 5-7. For the small plates, I would recommend the brussel sprouts and quail. Cocktails here are awesome; try the Pennsylvania Railroad Sour. Also, they just recently expanded their happy hour to end at 6:30 instead of 6, which really helps when you're rushing there after work. \\n\\nAll in all, Fino is my favorite place to go for a low-key night any day of the week, where you don't have to worry about parking, making a reservation, ordering the wrong dish, or snobby service.

My boyfriend had the $50 omakase, while I had the $40. \\n\\nIn the middle of our meal, there was a long 30 minute wait. The table next to us who arrived over an hour after us, had already received their entrees while we had not. It turned out they had made a mistake and delivered our entrees to them. We had to wait another 10 minutes for our entrees. \\nBut my entree never came. They didn't even realize they had missed my entree until I asked about it. The waitress almost didn't believe me, she had me name every dish I had thus far. She then came up 5 minutes after I had told her about the missed entree, telling me it was last call, and I needed to place my last orders in if I wanted any. I reminded her about my entree, and she almost looked shocked, like \\"Is this girl gonna let the missed entree go?\\" After speaking to the other waitresses, and the chef, she tells me my entree will be coming in the next 10 minutes. My boyfriend finished his meal, while I waited for my entree. \\nBy the time we finished our meal, we had been in the restaurant for 3.5 hours. We were the second last table to leave, and the last table left came in half an hour before closing. Eight tables had come and gone during meal - three of which had omakase. Ridiculous. When our bill came, I asked if we could be given a discount for the inconvenience they caused with the mix-up. No can do, said the  waitress. \\n\\nBrief overview about the food, as I basically rated this restaurant on its service. First up was the baby spinach salad, which was extremely salty. Next was the raw oyster and oyster shooter with the monkfish, which was alright - your typical oyster shooter dish. I also had had the quail and salmon - salmon was tasty, but the quail was very, very bland. The soup, which I believe was squash, was good. My entree, the lobster and cod, was good - but certainly not worth the wait. The tempura was not so good, and the sashimi was pretty fresh. Nothing special.  \\n\\nNeedless to say, I will not be back. The food was mediocre, but it is not good enough to bring me back.

They also have sushi, but I'd come here for the soba since there are so many strong sushi places in the area. I was so excited when it opened, but service was a little clunky. Looking to go back soon to see if they've ironed out their kinks!\\n\\nTHE SPACE:\\nThe restaurant's situated at the end of the plaza with the Starbucks, so it was a little hard to find. The restaurant's spacious and has a big bar on one side and seating on the other. My favorite part of the space was the giant mural that runs along one side of the wall. Besides that, I felt like the space could use more tables or something -- some people called it airy but I call it sterile-looking. \\n\\nTHE FOOD:\\nWe got some yakitori and soba:\\n\\nYAKITORI\\n- Negima (chicken thigh with scallion) - Delicious with a sweet sweet marinade!\\n- Shishito - a big pile of shishito peppers, of which I had the luck to draw the only insanely spicy one in the pile. Wish they were grilled a little more, as they tasted a little raw on the inside.\\n- Beef enoki - tasty, but a little overcooked.  \\n\\nSOBA\\nThe most exciting part of the menu, and I'd suggest only coming here for the soba.\\nComes in both cold and hot soba forms -- I highly recommend the cold soba. Brings a lightness to an otherwise heavy meal! Also the practice of dipping the cold noodles in broth keep me slow and deliberate with my noodle slurping. \\n\\nI got the kamo seiro -- duck cold soba. Came with a generous helping of duck and the hot dipping broth was rich (although I wish I had more). Boyfriend got the kimchi pork cold soba and it had the delicious sour bite from the kimchi.\\n\\nTHE SERVICE:\\nMy biggest complaint was the service -- the yakitori took forever to come out, which was surprising given we ordered 2 skewer's worth of food. They also brought out my boyfriend's soba 25 minutes before they brought out mine, which made our dining experience awkward (both from him trying to be polite and wait and my obvious hanger from the situation). \\n\\nAll in all, I'd give this place another chance given the rarity of its menu, and I hope they've fixed some of the service flaws we experienced."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"3640 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The rumors are all true.

With noodle soups you usually run into the problem of meat based broths. As someone who's pescatarian, I try and avoid accidentally eating meat (especially in broth form). The server here told me that Sugidama's broths are exclusively fish based- no meat!!! Great for me, not so great for vegetarians (I would check with your server if you don't eat fish). The soba we had was delicious! The sushi roll was pretty good. My advice? Stick to the soba/noodles and apps. The sushi's not bad by any means- it's just not the showstopper.

Or just give the restaurant a call, they're very helpful. The shopping center is pretty new and I think the street addresses haven't been updated in Apple Maps.\\n\\nThat said, the staff is one of the best things about Wagamama. They're helpful, attentive, and professional. Service was very smooth.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the food doesn't measure up to the service. It's not bad, but it's not great. I am a big fan of ramen, so I was looking forward to trying Wagamama. Their ramen is definitely not traditional but looked like it could be very good.\\n\\nThe hubby & I started out with the duck gyoza appetizer. Not bad--I expected the duck to be sliced or chopped, not shredded, but the spicy-sweet sauce that the dumplings came with tied it together pretty well. \\n\\nFor the main course I ordered the spicy beef ramen, the husband went with beef miso ramen. The waiter warned him that the beef miso was much spicier than my spicy beef, which was odd, but whatever.\\n\\nAnd indeed, the miso ramen was much spicier, but not steam-shooting-out-the-ears hot. It did build up pretty hot over time, though, to the point that the hubby lost interest in the broth once the noodles were gone. We could pick out the chili oil, red pepper, black pepper, and toasted sesame flavoring the broth. The melange of sliced vegetables and nori bits thrown on top of the cubed beef was odd but not bad.\\n\\nI was less pleased with the spicy beef. The flavor was not bad--it skewed more toward Vietnamese pho than ramen, with a chicken broth base flavored with cilantro, sliced jalapenos, bean sprouts and a wedge of lime (tossed right into the hot broth and stewing away, yuck). But the beef--well, it was good quality, and there was a lot of it. But it was sliced into thick slabs almost a half inch thick. \\n\\nNow, like most Americans I like a big giant cut of meat, but not dunked in a big giant bowl of soup. The least they could have done was given me a steak knife. The beef was pretty tender for what it was, but having to gnaw at it while holding it steady between a pair of chopsticks and a soup spoon is kind of a challenge. I can't see someone ordering this while trying to impress a date (unless their date is into watching someone gnaw away at a piece of beef). This is where being already married has its benefits, as in, I no longer have any qualms about slouching around the house after dinner picking meat out of my front teeth. Still--if they're gonna serve a big slab of beef in the soup, they need to bring a knife with the bowl. And extra napkins. Or they can adjust the recipe and walk it back to the Asian way of doing things, using wafer-thin slices that you don't have to fight with.\\n\\nPerhaps the most damning thing about the broth is that it doesn't stay with you. I don't know how to describe it, but if you've eaten at any of the more traditional ramen places around Boston, the best ones have you feeling warm and full and you're still thinking about the ramen when you're way down the road. Wagamama's ramen doesn't come close. It's got great up-front flavor, but a watery finish, and unfortunately that was what I was left thinking about on the drive home--how weak the broth was in the end.\\n\\nLike I said, service was great, we got seated relatively fast for a Saturday night--within 15 minutes--but the ramen isn't quite there. Wagamama isn't a bad spot, it's probably very acceptable for suburbanites, but it's not my bowl of ramen."},{"name":"Chatime","address":"1545 West Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"I enjoy the milk teas here, and customization of sweetness and ice is good but otherwise this location is WAY TOO LOUD!!

We arrived right on time for our reservation but our table was not ready.  We were directed to the bar which was spacious and had a calm atmosphere.  We were able to order our first drinks and review the menu.  As an appetizer, we ordered a charcuterie and cheese plate.  It was because of this appetizer why I rated this restaurant 4 stars.  The brie cheese was cold and the salami and pepperoni were to hard and tough to bite into.  Also, they did not give enough bread to accompany the meat and cheese.  I will say however the bread they did give you with the plate was phenomenal! It was slightly toasted but tasted like it was fresh off of a campfire, it had a wonderful smokey taste to it, that when paired with the fig spread and hard cheese, was a wonderful flavor explosion.  For main dishes we got the filet mignon with garlic mashed potatoes and savory shrimp pasta.  We contemplated asking for an order of garlic mashed potatoes to take home because they were absolutely incredible. Wonderful flavor that just melted into your mouth.  Pair a bite of potatoes with the juice from the filet and we were in heaven.  The shrimp dish was tasty as well, the shrimp were massive.  I would definitely return to this restaurant for a special occasion"},{"name":"Habibi Restaurant","address":"1012 SW Morrison St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I dropped by here for dinner while visiting from out of town based on the great reviews, but thought it was fine, nothing more.  Cucumber water was lovely.  The hummus was yummy and you get lots of it, but nothing to write home about.  Pita was warm and delicious.  I had the vegetable kabobs and was a little disappointed.  Some of the vegetables were fine, but others (like the mushrooms) were mushy and a little unpleasant to eat.  Not to be nitpicking here, but I really didn't like the platter they were served on - like a brassy/tinny gold platter - the feel of my fork and knife on the plate was really quite unpleasant.  The service was indifferent - a guy that I assumed to be the owner was friendly and took my order, but everyone else seemed to not give a fig.

Unfortunately it was completely underwhelming!\\n\\nI am a fan of the ambience, it's warm and cozy. The vintage pages of classic cooking techniquess from a cookbook plastered to the walls as decor is a nice touch. We arrived around 5:30 just in time for the tail end of happy hour. We ordered two of the specialty cocktails at the bar and waited for a table. The cocktails are exactly what you expect them to be for a hipster hangout and were tasty. We we surprised at how quickly we were seated considering it was a Friday night at happy hour and the place seemed pretty packed. We must have gotten there just in time before the big crowd. We were seated upstairs, which is nice because there are private tables. We ordered the charcuterie and pickled veggies from the happy hour appetizers and waited until six to order off of the dinner menu. The apps were good but the things that followed are where this story gets interesting. \\n\\nThe best thing that we had from the menu hands down was the beef tongue with frisee salad, apple butter, Cabot Clothbound Cheddar, and an over easy egg on top. This dish was amazing! My only complaint is that the Cabot Clothbound Cheddar was completely absent from the dish. Next up we shared the crispy rabbit with beans, fingerlings, celery, and pine nuts in a dijon cream sauce. What we expected was a nice cut of tender meat with a crisped skin exterior where the meat sort of just falls off the bone. What we got was the equivalent of rabbit \\"shake and bake\\". There was barely any meat on the bones and the fried coating was WAY too much. To add insult to injury there wasn't enough of the Dijon cream sauce to help balance out the overcooked dried out fried rabbit we were served. This dish completely missed the mark. The last thing that we shared were two cheeses that were featured as a prominent section on the regular menu, not the dessert menu. For $6 a serving, I was shocked when only 4 small triangles (2 oz total) came out with maybe a tablespoon of honey and jam on the side to go with the three slices of bread. When they brought it to the table they didn't even bother to tell us which cheese was which (my personal pet pieve). The worst part is that they served us the stale end piece, you know the one that has been exposed to a little too much air. That's right, same cheese, two triangles, two completely different consistencies. That was the nail in the coffin for me. \\n\\nOverall I say if you are dining here be prepared to pay for the atmosphere and the idea of a good \\"foodie\\" restaurant. You can tell a lot of thought was put into the menu, but that doesn't do anyone any good if it can't be executed properly. The snack we had for $7 at the food stalls on 10th was better than most of the food we had at this supersized hipster joint."},{"name":"Spoleto Italian Kitchen","address":"4750 The Grove Dr","city":"Windermere","stars":"3.5","text":"This is the Italian version of Chipotle.

We always seem to manage to think of this place on Mondays.  And they are always closed on Mondays.\\n\\nSo imagine our surprise when we came up with the bright idea of french food on a Thursday.  We were planning to catch a friend's performance downtown and had to think of what was nearby.  Oui, oui...Chez Nous it shall be!\\n\\nAs soon as we were seated, the BF declared that it reminded him of home.  He's from Belgium...the Flemish side...but no matter.  It was homey and cozy and old-worldish...as much as Austin can be...especially since the sign proudly declared that it was established in 1982.  Not 1882...or even 1282 as some signs read in his hometown of Brugge.\\n\\nChez Nous is perfect in its simplicity.  The ONLY reason I am knocking it down a star is because they don't have foie gras.  I've been craving foie gras since I returned from vacation in France a month ago.  When I go to a French restaurant, I want foie gras.  To all you PETA-people out there I say...if you can catch me and force feed me until my liver is perfectly delectable, have at it.  Until then, I am at or damn near at the top of the food chain.  If I can catch, trap, shoot or farm you, I'm probably gonna eat you.  This is why I stay as far away from lions, tigers and bears...and the rare tribe that may still enjoy cannibalism...they can and will catch and eat me.\\n\\nWe devoured the prix fixe menu ($26 pp):\\nDuck pate - close enough.  Yummy!  Served with gherkins and olives.\\n\\nSalad Lyonnaise - the egg was poached to perfection and the vinaigrette was flavorful and not overwhelming\\n\\nSalmon with crab meat - medium-rare and seared just right with a fabulous slight crunch.  Crab was a teeny bit dry, but the beurre blanc was phenomenal\\n\\nSteak - BF let me have a bite.  It was a decent cut of meat, seasoned well and perfectly medium rare.  I think it was still moo-ing when it got to the table.\\n\\nBoth entrees were served with fresh veggies and croquettes...I think they called them pommes dauphines.  The fresh veggies were zucchini and squash.  They were a tiny bit too squishy for my taste, but well-seasoned and buttery.\\n\\nFor dessert we opted for the chocolate mousse and Crepe Normande.  The chocolate mousse was short on presentation.  When topped with my sprig of mint from the crepe, it spruced it up for a minute.  Only for a minute because the BF inhaled it shortly after I played dress-up with it.  It was marvelously fluffy, chocolaty, rich and light all at the same time.  The crepe was filled with cooked apples and served with caramel sauce and creme frache.  I stupidly attempted to deconstruct it so that I could taste the flavors separately.  Not a smart move, but when eaten the way I am sure the chef envisioned, it was perfect!\\n\\nThe service was classically French...unobtrusive and efficient.\\n\\nInclusive of our strong enough for the European BF espressos and a glass of wine, the bill came to about $70 before tip.

I wanted to leave because of their attitude, but let's be real it took awhile to get there and it is in the middle of an apartment building...not much else going on around there.\\n\\nOur waiter was fine, but he kept trying to take away our food before we were done.

The space is much smaller than I expected but unique from other coffee shops with their on-the-counter display of treats and one massive coffee machine maker (no clue what it actually is, but it's a beautiful piece that connects all the way to a vent in the ceiling). It's a bit noisier than I thought too, but again, this location is also part restaurant so there are plenty more conversations being had among those who were on their laptops or studying.\\n\\nThe nontraditional part about the \\"coffeekitchen\\" in relation to other coffee spots, is that servers wait on you at your table. Our server Aaron was extremely well-versed in the coffee they served and how it was brewed. I am simple when it comes to coffee - I like it black and then decide whether I want it hot or iced. When I told Aaron this, he suggested I try the pour over method of brewing instead of a traditional iced coffee. The pour over draws out the best qualities of the coffee. I was so impressed (no coffee junkie here) that I said told him to go for it ... and it was excellent! I was surprised that it was still served in plastic cup with lid when we were clearly dining in ... not certain if they had another option.\\n\\nNext time, I'll have to stop in for lunch and have some food from the kitchen as well.

I know it's frustrating when people hang out AFTER closing time, but this was almost an hour early. Just no. \\n\\nAnd I get it... I've worked in restaurants. But when customers are actively ordering drinks and desserts and still making you more money (not just sitting, talking afterward), this is unbelievably rude.

As a former service worker, I always stack my plates, wipe up my messes, and leave at least a half hour before closing time, because I understand the struggle and I care. It's sad, because otherwise, this was a pleasant experience, as usual. I am a regular here and have never made a complaint until now.

Cheap, tasty food, vinyl booths, 70s decor, friendly waitstaff, vintage exterior signage, and respectable Bloody Marys.\\n\\nI first heard about The Spare Room  via a link on Facebook. A friend had posted a list of the top 33 dive bars in America (http://www.thrillist.com/these-are-the-33-best-dive-bars-in-america), and The Spare Room was featured alongside a handful of other dive bars I've enjoyed over the years. With a trip to Portland already booked, I figured I'd pay a visit while I was there. \\n\\nAlthough the bar opens at 7 am daily, none of the Yelpers had elaborated on The Spare Room's breakfast, so my Portland friends and I decided to go for brunch. According to the menu, many of the breakfast entrees aren't much more than $4 before 11:00 am. Alas, it was already 11:30, but my Denver omelette with hashbrowns and toast  only set me back about $7.50. My friend ordered bacon and over-medium eggs, which she said were executed perfectly. The four slices of bacon that came with it were thick-cut and crisp. My other friend ordered the chicken fried steak which arrived absolutely smothered in gravy. When we were done, we all ordered sandwiches to go, to be eaten while watching a football playoff game on TV later that day. The California sandwich has thick slices of roast turkey (not luncheon meat), avocado, bacon, and tomato, and it was amazing. \\n\\nFrom what I saw of the two bars, the huge dance floor, and the stage, I can only imagine how the place comes alive at night.

Generally I don't care about the burger accoutrements, but the crinkle cut pickles and crispy lettuce with all three sauces really hit the spot. I thoroughly enjoyed the hand-cut crinkle fries too. They were a little limp, but the flavor made up for that, and I prefer soft fries to overly-crispy ones.

I've been hung up on when called by someone from popeyes' corporation before and nothing has improved.  As far as this locaton, you will surely have more misses or negative experiences than hits or positive experiences from either or both the food and the employees. The decent working employees do not stay.  The food is not consistenly fresh and made to order, even when hot because it may be refried or rebaked to heat through.  Sometimes the cabbage of the cole slaw was tough, and the red beans and rice looked contaminated because the consistency was strange.  Biscuits are either fresh or reheated, and I think the recipe has changed due to the difference in the texture. Food may be served on your carryout food bags and napkins since proper service is atypical here.  You must know about the televised ads since some employees may lie to you and deny you the food choices. Sometimes the wait is WELL over ten minutes like close to one hour. This is true; I experienced it. For your own support, you may need to record yourself dealing with popeyes' bad choice of employees. Why pay overpriced charges for old and misproperly handled food?

The atmosphere was actually surprisingly low-key for high end French food. Just a nice casual ambiance.\\n\\nWe had both looked online at their menu and had walked in expecting to each order the Prix Fixe dinner menu, which comes with an appetizer, entree and dessert ($29.50).  \\n\\nI ordered the pate while the GF got the salad and added on lardons ($1). The pate was not my cup of tea; while it tasted okay, I probably wouldn't order it again. The salad with the crispy bacon was very very good however. \\n\\nFor our entrees, we ordered the Saumon au crabe (grilled Atlantic salmon, smoked paprika beurre blanc, crab remoulade) and Bavette aux √©chalotes (Grilled Texas wagyu beef flank, pernod butter, fried shallots). Yeah, I just copied and pasted those entree names from their online menu. French food is very difficult to spell... \\n\\nThe salmon was by far the best piece of salmon I have ever ingested. Perfectly cooked, seasoned, and it also has the most ridiculously crispy/delicious skin on a fish I have ever come across. It was so damn crispy. I'm still amazed. The beurre blanc served with the fish was a perfect complement. It let the fish shine without being overpowering. \\n\\nThe Steak entree was equally as bomb. The meat was perfectly cooked as expected, the butter was a great component that let the quality of the meat stand out, and the crispy shallots served on the steak was a nice textural contrast. They both were served with this potato fritter type of thing that was really good as well.\\n\\nFor dessert, we had the Creme Caramel and the Cr√™pe Normande ($2 upcharge, totally worth it). The creme caramel was good, but not amazing. I thought it tasted like a basic flan that was pretty good. The GF liked it alot though. The dessert crepe we had was filled with caramelized apples and accompanied with a nice caramel sauce. It was awesome. Definitely worth the $2 upcharge IMO. \\n\\nOur second visit was for lunch today. I ordered the steak frites ($19.50) and the GF ordered the Croque Madame ($8.50). While the steak was on the smaller side (they do give house bread out to all the tables at least?), the taste was amazing. Served with a great butter/sauce thing. The fries were unique; guess I've never had \\"real\\" french fries before but it was very good. Needless to say, the steak was perfectly cooked. The croque madame was very very good as well. And very reasonably priced. $30 after tax for this awesome lunch? That's some great value right there. \\n\\nAll in all, Chez Nous comes through in every way.

The Chef's Choice is six courses, can't be modified, $105 a person, and all people at the table must agree to it, so go with your most daring of friends. We went with the Quattro Piatti which ended being a six-course after being brought out an amuse-bouche.\\n\\nWe started with the Proscuitto plate (image posted) which was the dazzler, great way to start the meal.\\n\\nFor the antipasti, the salmon \\"crudo\\" and the halibut cheek \\"guancia\\".

While the raspberry sorbet was to die for, the cake and buttercream came up short. The \\"tortia di formaggio\\" was a creamy treat and the \\"cioccolantini della casa\\" were a selection of dark chocolates all made in house, simply sinful.\\n\\nWas also surprised with a few more of the dark chocolates for dessert with a leaf reading congratulations after they had found out I was graduating.

I have heard about Trudy's before and it got the usual because it's in Austin it's the best place ever review. I studied the breakfast buffet prior to looking over the menu so I could make an educated decision on my plan of attack. After studying over the breakfast menu I noticed everything offered on the menu was on the buffet, so I decided to get the buffet. I couldn't imagine just because you order it off the menu that it would be made differently than what's put on the buffet line. However I did like their salsa, it had good flavor and nice little kick of heat on the back end. On the buffet line their were some pork empanadas which were awesome. I also liked their queso, but everything else was alright. It seemed like everything I tried was missing something, I couldn't put my finger on what it was missing. Our waitress was pretty terrible, we got there prior to the after church crowd so it wasn't even close to full. It took her about 15 minutes to bring us our drinks, then the next time I saw her was when she brought the checks.

I love Mexican food and have had the best.....and worst. Hmmmm.  Restaurant is comfortable with lovely open air view of the Mystic.  Waitstaff tried hard.  Guacamole was tasteless.  I added the salsa and salt and pepper which helped some.  The chicken enchiladas were overpowered by the Verde sauce. Rice was hard and the beans...well, were they beans?  They were liquefied glop. Worst offense, the Margarita. It could have been poured from a pre-made bottle.  Don't ask for a frozen drink.  They don't make them. No salt around the rim....or on the table for that matter.   We each dropped about $35 and most of our meal was left.  Chilis (not my idea of great Mexican food either) is far superior with better chips, salsa, and guac.

The bar was pretty full but we found seats and the atmosphere was nice. Tasty beer [we had a darker kind, I think the Martzen.] I had a great time. I was excited to try the food in the future.\\n\\nTHEN I READ THE YELP REVIEWS! There are Many bad reviews on here, and let me tell you, after all of that, I was scared! So I went to Gordon Biersch with a very scrambled head. My boyfriend and I were going for our anniversary, but I was also trying to eat healthy, so I decided before hand on the Ahi Tuna Salad, with their normal dressing on the side. My boyfriend chose the pulled pork, even though someone on here said it was spicy.\\n\\nFirst off, I we didn't order appetizers. And this was half before almost EVERY restaurant we go to serves some sort of bread before our meal. But they had nothing, which is okay, but slightly depressing. I ordered the lighter beer that was supposed to have a banana/clove flavor. Someone on Yelp gave it good reviews. Well, puke. It was absolutely awful. It tastes like Hoegaarden. So if you like that, you'll enjoy it. But I despise it, so whatever. What a waste of money.\\n\\nSo the FOOD. People on here raved about the Ahi Tuna Salad, but honestly, it didn't do it for me. The dressing had only a small amount of flavor, and the tuna itself tasted like nothing. There was no way it had even close to 400 calories. It was literally just lettuce and tuna. So so boring. AGAIN, a waste of $15. My boyfriend's pulled pork was actually really good though, and the garlic fries were AMAZING. If  I could go back in time I'd definitely choose that instead. \\n\\nThe main reason I Give Gordon Biersch three stars is the APPLE BREAD PUDDING. This stuff was HEAVENLY. I even took a picture of it. It was so so so good. I am a bread pudding lover, and I get it all the time. This is some of the best bread pudding I've ever had, so I definitely would go back just for that. \\n\\nThe service was pretty good, and the environment was definitely inviting.

I don't think those few minutes made a difference to the food.

From the atmosphere, to the service, to the menu - it's all just a little strange, like it can't decide what it's personality is.\\n\\nATMOSPHERE\\n-Weird.  Nice, but weird.  Funky artwork and \\"cool\\" graffiti'd walls accompanied by...paintings of garfield and tony the tiger and a gigantic portrait of marlon brando from the godfather.  The seating is diner-style, but it still somehow feels too open and too squished at the same time.  Also it seems like they won't seat 2 people at a booth - sadness.  \\n\\nSERVICE\\n-This kind of goes along with atmosphere, but there were a SH*T ton of staff around!  I think a staff member walked by our table on average every 5 seconds.  Now, this isn't a bad thing necessarily, but it becomes a little overwhelming at a certain point.  Our waiter was super friendly, but also super awkward.  He would often tell us he needed 10 seconds to go do something and he'd be right back, and would disappear for 5 minutes.  He also looked at me like I was absolutely crazy when I asked him to not bring fries with my burger - that made me feel kind of bad.\\n\\nMENU/FOOD\\n-The menu is intense.  It tries to be a little down-home diner style, but with an upscale/modern twist.  The prices are high.  Too high if you ask me.  High to the point where I questioned what I was going to order based on price, and to the point where I actually wanted the food I got to be better than it was.\\n-That said, the food isn't bad.  It's good!  They bring you clearly housemade bread with olive oil, which was really good.  Very upscale.  I got the cauliflower and bf got the duck tacos to start.  Everything was tasty, but super greasy.  The duck tacos were $9 for two.  I guess because it's duck, but it didn't seem worth it to me even though they were good.  The cauliflower was almost too salty.  He ordered the short rib and butter noodles, I ordered the burger sans fries (come on, guys, it's covered in fried onions and likely a mayonnaise based sauce - i just didn't need them).  His dish was good, but everything was very spiced with an earthy nutmeg flavor - it was kind of strange.  My burger was freakin' awesome.  I repeat - FREAKIN' AWESOME.  Having just reviewed Grass Fed in JP, I would come here before there any day.\\n-BF ordered a cocktail - Hell in a Handbasket or something (their menu isn't online otherwise I would look up the exact name).  It was $13, tasted more like tequila than vodka, and tasted more orangey-medicinal than anything else.  It was really, really not good.  I hope their other drinks are much better.\\n-We didn't go for dessert this time around, but they were pushing the Mascarporeos which came over with the pastry chef from Via Matta.  I've had them at Via Matta and they're good - more of a \\"shtick\\" than impressive taste wise, but worth a try if you like that kind of thing.\\n\\nBOTTOM LINE\\n-Happy's was...interesting.  I was sure we wouldn't be back, but my boyfriend said he'd come back sometime.  I think we'll probably go back to Citizen down the street first, but who knows, you might see us here again.  If you like burgers then go and get it, and decide if you want to go back again and try something else."},{"name":"Beirut Cafe","address":"2 SW Naito Pkwy","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Tried the chicken shawarma wrap which was a leaking mess.

Something they are doing must be right.

They are friendly and efficient.  No trouble at all here.\\n\\n2) Due to Westlake location, not crowded for dinner -- I can always get a good table.  Lunch, I don't know.   The population of the 360 corridor is like 40K+ more people during working hours.\\n\\n3) The regular events like live music, trivia, the World Cup specials, etc. add a lot to the atmosphere.\\n\\n4) Some of the food is actually OK.  Sandwiches mostly.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1) A lot of the menu is pretty mediocre, maybe even worse.  They really need to hire a chef, it's obvious this stuff is mostly pre-designed from other locations with a few instructions for kitchen staff.  That said, some of it is pretty good.  Just order like you are in a hamburger joint, not a restaurant -- if it sounds like something that should be designed by a chef, skip it, it will disappoint. \\n\\n2) The darts (and other pub games) are basically just for show.  Nothing is set up right or maintained.  It's not that hard to do, you can easily get someone from the ADA (Austin Dart Association) to pretty much set it all up for free.

Hamilton Rd. in Gahanna. Normally, I'm not very keen about eating at chain restaurants like this, but this restaurant, in so many aspects did not follow the norm; excessively long wait for wait staff to acknowledge you in the restaurant and then take and deliver your order quickly and accurately. \\n\\nAs soon as we  walked through the door, by design, the wonderful aromas of fresh baked, homemade bread waft through the air and hit you like a sledge hammer (in a good way) - just to remind you that no matter how full you are after your meal, you will still need to buy one or three loves of bread to take with you. \\n\\nAs we looked over the menu, more of a normal formality than out of need, Jessica, our server came to our table to take our drink orders. When she returned after just a minute or so, I was intrigued that she asked us if we had any questions. (Obviously, questions about the menu - that doesn't happen very often). Normally, the questions to us are more substantive - \\"What would you like to order?\\"\\n\\nJessica took my order seamlessly, even when I wanted to substitute extra crispy hash browns for my mashed potatoes. My wife ordered turkey and dressing with a side order of baby carrots. \\n\\nIn between bringing our orders out from the kitchen, Jessica sat a mason jar in the center with two pieces of a new menu item - sweet bacon. It initially reminded me of some of the strange concoctions you can get during the run of the Ohio State Fair, while having a brown sugar and maple syrup lightness to the taste, the bacon was crisp and not overpowering. I think that a full order of five or six pieces of bacon are meant to be shared. \\n\\nAfter Jessica removed the empty jar that had the sweet bacon, when she came back to our table a few minutes later and asked, \\"I gave you some of the bacon. Didn't I?\\" I joked with her, described the jar, the flavor of the sweet, crisp bacon and then said, \\"No. We didn't get any of that!\\"\\n\\nThe meals itself were typically wonderful. My Chicken Fried Steak cutlet was tender, juicy, flavorful with just the right amount of crunch in the lightly breaded, seasoned, pan-fried batter. I must also admit that my Extra crispy hash browns were truly made to my liking. The rich, white, peppery gravy on top of the cutlet added a delicious savory flavor without being overwhelming. \\n\\nI sampled my wife's turkey and dressing. OMGoodness! I may have to come back here and grab a huge carry out of the dressing to take with us out-of-town for Thanksgiving. However, I don't think I'll likely wait that long to get a couple of orders to take home. \\n\\nThe turkey was tender, moist and juicy, which added the perfect compliment to the blend of translucent cooked onions, bread pieces, sage, celery, and chicken stock to bind it all together with an array of other spices and herbs. There was also another main ingredient that provided a special taste (secret ingredient, I suppose) to their dressing, but not to my own. \\n\\nBoth meals were \\"must haves.\\"\\n\\nOur waitress, Jessica's jovial, friendly, and professional manner seemed to provide just the affect you would expect in a server who obviously likes her job and people. She kept our glasses filled and my coffee hot. (Often times, when I place my original order, I will ask for coffee \\"with\\" the meal. Some will forget the coffee entirely and need a reminder, others will bring my coffee when it was requested, when my food is brought to the table.  Kudos to Jessica for bringing piping hot coffee shortly after she placed my meal on the table. Although, Jessica was very friendly, it never crossed the line to intrusiveness. \\n\\nI asked to speak to Jessica's manager. When I saw Jessica's whole demeanor change, quickly added that she was not in trouble for anything. I just wanted to let her know about our general experience with the meal and how wonderful she, Jessica, had been. \\n\\nI met Iroquois, her manager, who I had noticed had gone from table to table asking patrons if everything was ok or not. I was impressed with the attentiveness Iroquois demonstrated to all of the customers in the restaurant. I pointed out Jessica's attributes displayed to us, both personally and professionally, and then thanked her and told her we would tell others about this restaurant and the service we'd received. \\n\\nOn the way out to the register, we passed right by all of the purposely and conveniently stacked loaves of Pumpkin, Banana-Nut bread and Apple bread slices. All of which are homemade and delicious. \\n\\nWe'll be back and I suggest if you haven't been to Bob Evans in awhile, perhaps you should visit them again."},{"name":"Clyde Common","address":"1014 SW Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"When doing my Portland research, I came across Clyde Common and honestly thought it was a pub that served food.

To our pleasure, he met all of our needs right on time with a positive attitude! \\n\\nAs for the food, everything was just mediocre. I opted for their soup of day, which was corn chowder, and mussels. The corn chowder was on the salty side just like any other American restaurant soup. They also added bacon to the chowder so it had a full punch of flavor. The mussels that were cooked in a tomato sauce were prepared perfectly. I was happy to find the mussels to its full plumpness and flavor. However, the sauce was wayyyy too salty. I often like to enjoy the broth with a fresh baguette, but it was overly salty that it made that impossible. My friend ordered a NY strip that was boneless. Be prepared to get it cooked not to your liking. She asked for medium, but it turned out to be well done. As for the taste, it was obviously dry and tasteless.

They were served at different times, by different people. The curry was ok, mediocre is being nice, and her donburi was terrible.

The chips were warm, salted nicely and thin and perfect for dipping.  It's a meal in itself!\\n\\nMy party of three came in for lunch mid-afternoon on a Saturday.  This is usually change of shift so I attributed some of the service issues that we had with the change of shift.  That is, until our server disappeared.  \\n\\nMy 7 year old ordered tacos off of the kids menu, which came served like fajitas (which is perfect for kids, who can assemble as they wish). She ordered her steak medium rare, it was more like medium well, but it appeared well seasoned and she enjoyed it.  Her food arrived first - before our drinks (one bar drink, one iced tea, one seltzer water).\\n\\nI had the fish tacos which I have to say, reminded me of some of the delicious fish tacos that I have had on the west coast in San Diego.  The fish was larger than expected, but absolutely delicious and perfectly cooked.  The light sauce was perfectly paired as were the radishes lined across the top.  I wish I took a picture but I was hungry and we had been waiting.\\n\\nMy husband ordered the pozole soup as a starter.  It arrived with his chicken tacos - but let me tell you, both were delicious.  I tried the soup myself and wished I had ordered a bowl.  \\n\\nOur server came by with our table drinks (ordered when we sat down) about 3/4 through our meal.  Other staff members had already gotten my bar drink, another got my daughter's seltzer, and another got my husband's iced tea.  She did come by and offer dessert menus and we ordered churros (also amazing) and churros also come with the kids meal. I asked to get them to go because we'd been waiting so long.  Twenty minutes later, someone comes by with a plate with my daughter's churros and I let her eat them while we waited on the rest of our order and paid.\\n\\nA manager did walk by and I explained to him that the concept was great, the food was great, but it is in sharp contrast to the terrible service, having to wave down various people for basic components of our meal and our server missing from the time drinks were ordered until she brought a dessert menu.  The manager was great, actually wants us to come back again and he made it right and invited us to return.  They've only been open four weeks and explained that they are working with a lot of new staff. \\n\\nI wish them luck - it's a great, great location, great food concept and excellent execution from behind the kitchen doors.  We will be back but we will give them some time to work out the service aspect.  It's so important, especially for families who don't eat out a lot and when they do, they want an enjoyable experience.  Kids aren't particularly patient when it comes to this kind of stuff and us parents usually go places where there is some level of service predictability. \\n\\nOh, and the Cielo Azul margarita did make waiting so long just a a little bit sweeter - what a delicious (and strong) drink.  Because all of the service was not bad, I wanted to add that the front desk greeters were warm, welcoming and made great eye contact and were friendly and engaging upon entry and exit.

We have to admit that the outside of the joint looked a little seedy.  However, once we entered that front door, all of our fears were laid to rest.  While the inside is decorated in typical bar paraphernalia, it was very clean and not too crowded.  Barley's is definitely a bar that moonlights as a restaurant.  The tables were nicely spaced, but the chairs were a little too small.  Noise level was tolerable at the beginning of our lunch, but it exponentially elevated once the hostess sat some hooligans next to us.  However, the overall vibe of Barley's was nice.\\n\\nHigh marks:  Clean, well-spaced tables\\nLow marks:   Suspicious exterior, small chairs, hooligans\\n\\nService:  Grade B+:  We had a nice server named Fife for our lunch service.  There was minimal wait for food and drinks, and Fife provided us with a pleasant accurate service.  We give her some kudos for maintaining her composure while the hooligans at the adjacent table harassed her.  However, there was nothing really jaw-dropping about the service.  We did only have to ask for thing once, so that was definitely a positive.\\n\\nHigh marks:   Accurate, quick service, only had to make requests once\\nLow marks:   Nothing jaw-dropping about service\\n\\nFood/Spirits:  Grade B:  Katina and I split the difference on this grade.  She favored giving Barley's a C+ for the food and I voted for a B+.  As a result, we average out to a B.  We ordered chicken wings for our appetizer, hoping for a repeat of the pleasant surprise we had at Ri Ra.  However, while the chicken wings were okay and cooked with a nice char, they could have been a little crisper and the buffalo sauce could have had bigger testicles.  It was a little too mild and needed more of a vinegar kick.  Katina ordered the Irish Peach for her drink and thought it was smooth and easily drinkable even though it contained whiskey, which is not one of Katina's favorite spirits.  I ordered the house brewed Scottish ale, which was very malty and smooth, and the Russian stout, which was dark, thick, and smooth with almost no harshness.  For her entr√©e, Katina ordered the Lonestar burger and I selected the Ed's burger, which was a bratwurst burger.  Katina's burger was okay, but she ordered it prepared medium well and it came out medium to medium rare.  There was enough blood in it to turn her bun pink, which is a no-no.  This is why we get excited when someone gets a medium well burger or steak prepared correctly...it doesn't happen that often.  The Ed's burger was a delicious brat burger topped with pulled pork.  It was topped with spicy chipotle mayo, and it was so good I felt the need to take a nap afterwards.  \\n\\nHigh marks:  Ed's burger was fantastic, good mixed drinks and beer  \\nLow marks:   Lonestar burger not cooked correctly, chicken wings were ho-hum\\n\\nValue:  Grade C:  What's up with that \\"C\\" grade, you ask?  Well, we had lunch service for two and both ordered burgers, so the $52 price tag was a little steep in our book.  Add the inconsistent food quality, and there you have it...a \\"C.\\"  However, if you're not eating on a budget, then you should give Barley's Brewing Company a try...they might surprise you.\\n\\nHigh marks:   None\\nLow marks:   Too pricey for lunch...especially for burgers lacking the \\"wow\\" factor"},{"name":"Mighty Fine Burgers Fries & Shakes","address":"10515 N Mo-Pac Expy, Ste 105","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is solid.

Walked around 4th street, but the wait was too long at the places we wanted to go to, like 219 West, & ended up coming here bc I had come here for a reception last year and remembered it being decent. \\n\\nWe were seated outside on a Friday night (no wait) and our waiter was helpful in giving us recommendations. The warm chips & salsa were restocked when we were almost done with them, so we never had to ask for \\"more\\". I loved that. \\n\\nI ended up getting the Monterrey (1 chicken mole, 1 spinach, and 1 Veracruz enchiladas). It was alright.. I ended up switching the ranchera sauce it came with for their sour cream sauce for the spinach enchilada. That turned out to be my fave. The chicken inside the mole and Veracruz was too dry. I also didn't like the corn tortilla bc it was too hard. \\n\\nThe Cam Poblano Asada was reeeeally goooood though... There was shrimp and cheese stuffed inside a huge pobano pepper and it was wrapped with a thin/tender piece of marinated flank steak. TASTY - when I tried his, everything just melted in my mouth! This dish is highly recommended.. however, it's $21.49.\\n\\nThe environment is nice (I found it somewhat romantic too when we were seated outside)... the price is average (not cheap or too expensive).

It was delicious!  The tuna is served rare by default, and my only complaint is that this is the only time I've ever been served rare tuna and not been warned in some way (by either the menu or the person I ordered from).  I happen to love rare tuna, but I assume that there are other people who might be unpleasantly surprised.  Other than that, I have NO complaints.  The salad was tasty, freaking HUGE and not drowned in dressing...  it had the perfect amount (enough for taste, but not sopping wet).\\n\\nThe line to order food was really long (almost to the door), but it moved pretty quickly.  Despite the restaurant being rather packed (it was prime lunch rush time when we arrived), our food did come out pretty quickly.  Everything ordered by my co-workers looked DELICIOUS, including a wild mushroom soup that I will definitely be trying on a future visit.\\n\\nThe only complaint I heard was from one of my co-workers who ordered the Club salad with fried chicken pieces on top.

We ordered margaritas and they were good but not great. I asked if I could get a shrimp burrito and the waiter said yah we can definitely do that. He came back 5 minutes later and said they couldn't do that. So I asked for a menu to look again to order something different and the manager came over and said they could do it but it would be 4 dollars more. I told them that was fine. The burrito was pretty small, and just had shrimp in it and a little cheese. My friend ordered the fajitas but they didn't come out sizzling like usual, it was just the meat and all of the toppings on a plate. He wasn't too crazy about it.

My boyfriend, who is not a regular eater of vegan fare, enjoyed his burger, but found it a little undercooked/not crispy enough, to the point where it crumbled in his hands after the first bite. THAT BEING SAID, the manager checked up on us and immediately pointed out how mushy it was, which we both appreciated.\\n\\nMy favorite part, besides the cool furniture and classic 80s tunes: THE TEXAS TUMBLEWEED FRIES. Holy crap. The Yuca fries were tasty, the russet and sweet potato fries were passable...but the fried veggie noodles are the bees knees in this joint.

Fogo de Chao is certainly the most popular and seems to be the undisputed favorite for good reason.  However, Red & Green Brazilian Steakhouse on Buford Highway should be considered the best value Brazilian steakhouse.\\n\\nPrice comparison (as of 7/17/2013):\\n\\nFogo de Chao\\nLunch: $32.50, salad bar only: $22.50\\nDinner: $49.50, salad bar only: $24.50\\n\\nFire of Brazil\\nLunch: $17.95 (8 cuts of meat), salad bar only: $12.55\\nDinner: $41.50 (16 cuts of meat), salad bar only: $21.50\\n\\nRed & Green\\nLunch: $21.95 (9 cuts of meat), salad bar only $9.95\\nDinner: $34.95 (16 cuts of meat), salad bar only: $9.95\\n\\nSal Grosso was charging $41.95 for its dinner service before it recently closed.\\n\\nThese prices are for the rodizio service, which is a traditional Brazilian restaurant service where passadores (meat waiters) walk from table to table with giant skewers of meat.  It's essentially a meat buffet, except the meat is freshly cooked and brought to your table one-by-one.  It's a fun experience.\\n\\nI went to Red & Green Brazilian Steakhouse last night for the latest Buford Highway UYE (http://www.yelp.com/events/atlanta-buford-highway-uye-red-and-green-brazilian-steakhouse).  Eight other Yelpers joined in.  I made a reservation with the owner, Young Lee, and he had a long table set aside for our group in the back.\\n\\nThe restaurant has been open for 7 years.  I've always been curious about this place when I pass by it on Buford Highway.  The red and green signage is so large and in-your-face.  It's in the same shopping center as Sushi House Hayakawa and Karaoke Melody 1.\\n\\nWalking inside, I was taken aback at how elegant and grandiose the restaurant looks.  The place is decked out from floor to ceiling.  The owner put a lot of money into this place.  Just inside the entrance are chandeliers, colorfully lit stone columns, a wine room, and automatic sliding glass doors.  There's a flight of stairs that go down, presumably to one or both of the restaurant's ballrooms.  The \\"red\\" ballroom seats 300 people and the \\"green\\" ballroom seats 150 people.\\n\\nMr. Lee stood by the automatic sliding glass doors to greet each person in our party.  He's a very nice man.\\n\\nThe main dining area is large and deep.  It goes back pretty far.  There are different sections of seating, some more private than others.  There are also two large flatscreen TVs mounted up top.\\n\\nYou can think of Red & Green as the \\"cheap\\" option for the Brazilian steakhouse experience.  You're paying less money, so don't expect the food to be as extravagant as Fogo.  That said, I don't think the meat quality at Red & Green is significantly worse than Fogo.  It's still good.  The salad bars are worlds apart, though, but that's where $9.95 vs. $24.50 comes into play.\\n\\nRed & Green's salad bar looks very nice, but its items are quite basic.  I'm sad to say it's not too different than a Ruby Tuesday salad bar with iceberg lettuce and mixed greens plus all the standard toppings.  Various veggies and pasta salads are also available.  There is a small hot bar with white rice, black beans, and plantains as well as a soup bar with mushroom soup and chicken noodle soup.  It would've been nice if the salad bar items had descriptions.  On the bright side, everything was fresh.\\n\\nAt dinner, the following 16 types of meat are served:\\n\\n1. Rump steak\\n2. Top sirloin\\n3. Filet mignon\\n4. Garlic beef\\n5. Pork ribs\\n6. Bacon-wrapped filet mignon\\n7. Bacon-wrapped chicken breast\\n8. Flank steak\\n9. Lamb\\n10. Pork loin\\n11. Pork sausage\\n12. Chicken drumsticks\\n13. Chicken hearts\\n14. Beef ribs\\n15. Ribeye\\n16. New York strip\\n\\nI believe our group tried everything except the flank steak and chicken hearts.  Since the restaurant wasn't very busy, a minimal amount of meat was cooked.  We had to specifically request the bacon-wrapped filet mignon and an extra order of plantains at the hot bar, which they immediately prepared.\\n\\nIn general, I thought the meat was good.  I liked how each meat was freshly cooked and brought immediately out from the kitchen.  I wasn't a fan of the chicken breast or drumstick -- they were both too dry.  I did enjoy the ribs (both pork and beef), pork sausage, sirloin, and filets.  We had our meats cooked medium so they were pink, tender, and flavorful.  Some of the meats were a tad overseasoned/salty, but nothing excessive.  Also, some cuts were quite fatty.  The beef ribs were gigantic.  A server let Marty J. keep one of the bones to take home to his dog.\\n\\nService was very good.  Anna was our server and she did an outstanding job from keeping our bellies stuffed with cheese bread and garlic bread to filling additional food requests to separating checks.\\n\\nCheck online for deals and discounts.

My partner and I sat at the bar as always, and as always it's an experience that, regardless of who's seated next to you, is either enhanced or redeemed by the staff here.\\n(And don't know if I missed it, but Mr. Morgenthaler's new book was nowhere in sight; if it was on display, naturally, it should be - but if it wasn't, whatever the reason, it struck me as classy not to do the expected hard sell.)\\nThere are many good descriptions of the cocktails already posted, but I'll say again that the barrel-aged drinks they make add a fantastic depth to already great drinks. Even when we asked the bartender to keep us in the gin family and surprise us - a request not cherished by every bartender - he affably mixed up two expertly balanced drinks.\\nThe food also remains top-notch. We had two happy hour apps, the smoked clams and the meatballs. The clams were my favorite, lightly smokey in what I'm guessing is a sauce that includes pimenton (Spanish smoked paprika). I know the daily popcorn is always mentioned, and it was tasty (thank you, young lady who even offered to share the entire plate).\\nFor dinner I had the branzino, cooked beautifully along with its accompaniment. Though I didn't much sense the scallop mousse it was served with, no matter; the dish was excellent. And it might have been the cocktails dimming my perceptual powers.\\nThey clearly don't need more recommendations, and I'm sure visitors like me crowding the place drives the locals nuts, but go.

I still liked it, but it was really chewy & as it cooled off didn't taste as good.\\n\\nThe GF menu doesn't change & there's nothing on the specials that you can eat.  They can't even make any of the special's gf so you're limited to the same choices all the time. I really don't know what's with their broccoli with garlic butter.

It's like they went halfway between \\"cheap\\" steakhouses that give you 2 sides ON the plate & super elite expensive one (ahem like Kraft NYC) that charge you for each side.  The result doesn't work for me esthetically nor do I feel even remotely sated.

In addition to the bagels themselves, the sandwiches are unbelievable.

And wait.\\n\\nYes, this is a popular spot for good reason! But don't blame the long waiting on the line. There's a reason the line gets so long - the service is s-l-o-w. There is absolutely no sense of urgency going on behind the counter whatsoever.\\n\\nEmployees, while pleasant, are usually talking with one another, sauntering over to the coffee, bagel or sandwich stations as though no one is in line at all and they're making themselves a sandwich to pass the time.\\n\\nEvery time I have gone to BW (only a handful so far), I've seen handfuls of people walk in, take one look at the line, and leave. Think of how much business this place is losing because they're so slow!!\\n\\nI guess it probably doesn't matter to them. They're doing well, obviously, and the employees probably couldn't care less whether someone stays or goes.

It is conveniently located. The outdoor seating area is great for nice and cool nights. We were seated inside which was quite loud and a little too cramped for Austin Texas dining. I felt like I was back in NYC again sitting almost side by side with absolute strangers at some fancy SoHo restaurant. I could overhear their entire conversation and I am sure they could hear every word I said. It was loud and my company and I both have hearing problems so this was not a great place to dine for us.\\n\\nWe ordered the Fried Alexander Farm Egg & Rapini and Fried Goat cheese as appetizers. The goat cheese was good, the Farm Egg was just out of place. It did not belong on a dinner menu. I did not like it either.\\n\\nDuring a previous visit, we ordered the Dolmades. They are funky tasting. Being from the Middle East I must admit, I think these Dolmades are a horse of a different color and not in a good way. They should just put this appetizer out of its misery and take it off the menu.\\n\\nMy main course was Hanger Steak & Pommes Frites. Translation: burnt charred stiff piece of beef of questionable origin thrown on top of greasy bed of fries. This was a terrible dish. I never want to see it or smell it again.\\n\\nMy company ordered Butternut Squash Ravioli and he was happy with it.\\n\\nAfter we were done with appetizers and the main course, I was still starving. The food quantity was just ridiculously low for Austin. You may be able to pass this as food in NYC but in Austin only pretentious people will love this stuff and be glad that they paid twice as much for half as little food. -- Whatever happened to the old Castle Hill btw? Do you remember their food, how it was delicious and there was plenty of it on the plate?\\n\\nAnyhow, we had to order dessert because as I said I was starving. I ordered Caramel Date Cake and I must admit it was the most delicious thing I have tasted in a long while. My company ordered Pumpkin Flan, and that too was delicious. Whoever is doing the desserts knows what they're doing.\\n\\nThe service was good. The matre'd was kind and responsive when I refused to sit at one of the high tables and wanted to get a booth. I was impressed by her flexibility. Our waiter knew the menu well and was very attentive despite the hectic Friday night craziness. He took good care of us.\\n\\nOverall, honestly, this establishment is clearly trying to deliver the goods. And I hate writing bad things about people who are working hard to do things right. I think the menu needs to be changed around a little, and the chef needs to stay away from beef.  Maybe the correct direction is to completely get rid of entrees and turn it into a tapas style restaurant.\\n\\nI wish them the best of luck.

I got the OG and replaced rice with rice noodles and chose tofu as my protein. The noodles are short and not long noodles which I was bummed about, and the tofu is a little crispy on the outside but mine were a bit cold so it wasn't that enjoyable. Flavor-wise, I didn't like it. It wasn't bad, but it didn't really stand out, but I can see how they're trying to incorporate asian influences like the sauces (peanut-lime dressing, sesame, miso ginger) with healthy options like seasonal greens, carrots, sweet potato, that came in my OG bowl.\\n\\nI think I need to try a rice bowl with chicken and the curry sauce looked good, so I'm willing to try again, but also hoping to get more, because other fast casual places in the area have bowls that are more filling and I felt like I finished mine pretty quickly.\\n\\nPART 2 (SECOND VISIT)\\nSpoke to some coworkers to get recs, and went for the Chef Curry because Oakland represent, but also because I wanted rice, chicken, and the curry to try this time (also spice level isn't too bad!). Wow, huge difference. Definitely do not get the rice noodles, save the noods and your money for Chinatown! The seasaoned chicken plays a huge role in comparison to tofu (sadness because love tofu) and the curry isn't very thick but the rice holds the sauce way better than the stubby noodles.\\n\\nWould change my 3 star to 4, but I still think the service can be a bit improved. I noticed a got 1/3 of the cilantro the first time versus the second, when I got a bigger bowl, larger portions, so consistency needs to be achieved, and a bit more organization with having the next employee be in line with the customer during the prep process.

Make sure you get priority seating in advance!\\n\\nThe service has usually been good (I've been about 8-10 times). They do not have lids or straws, but that's OK, I'm an adult. There's not much to say about the service as it's a buffet, but they're usually on time with refills and plate clearing.\\n\\nThe buffet itself is large. There is plenty of fresh fruit, great salads and hummus and breads. I really like the pasta salad and the tossed salad with citrus dressing. They also have soups on the bar. My favorites are butternut squash and potato. I've hears the gumbo and ox tail is good as well. There is a kids section with the requisite mac and cheese, fries and such. It's funny to see how many adults spend $27-$30 on a buffet, then proceed to eat chicken fingers... Next are sides such as rice, potatoes, couscous and things like that. The meats are good too. There is always a fish, usually salmon, chicken, prime rib and this coca-cola pork roast thing. I know I'm leaving stuff off, but hey, I can't remember all the good stuff.\\n\\nDesserts are in their own section. Simply put, they are amazing. I think I could eat about 45 zebra domes. Man, those things rock. There are other items too like mousse, fruit pastry, cookies, and KILLER tiramisu.\\n\\nOverall, I really like this place. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because it's a buffet."},{"name":"Chin Chin - Howell Mill","address":"1715 Howell Mill Rd, Ste C-16","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is our staple for delivery Chinese food.

I then went on to try to explain to him that refusing us service based on the fact that I have a guide dog is illegal under the American with Disabilities Act (ADA). He claimed that he knew the law already. He then made up some empty excuse about how the restaurant has a lot of hot soups and how that was dangerous to the dog. Lots of restaurants have hot soups. We have never had any problems at any other restaurant before. This was clearly a half-baked justification for his discriminatory behavior.

On this lunch visit, I had Steak Bulgogi. It was very good and had plenty of flavor. The steak was also perfectly cooked to the medium specification that I had requested. Also, the fresh fruit juices here are really good. They have several choices, and they're made with actual fresh pressed/juiced fruit, not concentrate or bottled like other places serve. Service here was good, consistent with the prior two experiences."},{"name":"Taco Loco Mexican Grill","address":"44 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Unreal burritos, quick service, low cost.\\n\\nParking is a little tough, but worth it once you find a spot!"},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"As far as food and price goes I would give this 3 stars, but because the presentation is so great it gains an extra star. My husband and I went here for both lunch and breakfast. The meals are quick service even though it resembles the table service restaurants. There are 3 rooms to eat it. One is the west wing which I definitely recommend trying to get a table in if you can. If you can't then you can always check it out after you eat and get some pictures. It has the ripped picture of the prince, the rose with falling petals, and the room is dark and has lighting and sounds of thunder. One of the other rooms is the ballroom and they do an excellent job of bringing the ballroom from Beauty and the Beast to life. From the ceiling to the windows with fake snow falling outside, it is incredible. I don't remember what the third room was called but it was great as well. One thing I liked about this restaurant verses others is that there is self serve fountain drinks so you can refill as much as you want while you are there. I would definitely say the breakfast is better than lunch. We both ordered the croissant donut and it was fantastic! The price was really high for the food though. Lunch was good, but nothing to write home about. But just being in the restaurant is worth paying more for the food. Disney knows how to capture every detail.

Trust me when I say this place rocks. Fantastic venue for a special occasion unless you can afford to eat here everyday. But the service, food, experience are all well worth the money I believe. The place is located inside the St Regis so you can valet there and they validate parking for you. The restaurant is located on the top floor and to a corner, the huge impressive door sure leads you to another world altogether. Nice lobby and fireplace library style lounge area up front is very inviting. The bar somehow marries that space to the dining area really well. The interiors are gorgeous to say the least  and all that artwork from the investor's private collection is amazing. Service is top notch (ask for Heather) and the wine director Caleb is very approachable - he make sour to visit every single table to see if he can help with wine suggestions. I had the Tavistock pinot but the husband settled for a Chilean Malbec. They had bread service out with 3 varieties of breads/buns all baked to perfection. They do have a private dining area for parties, an open kitchen space where you can see Chef Grossman and team working magic and a few tables up front that serve as the chef's table if you'd like premium seating. The restaurant does open up to a patio so I came excited for warmer weather coming around. For appetizers, we tried the cured yellow tail and the wagyu pierogi. The pierogi could serve as meal in itself if you are a light after - it had potatoes and mushroom and was simply smooth and flavorful. The yellow tail had a lot going on in the plate and is quite pretty visually in presentation, lots of color and texture going on. Impressed you will be. For entrees, we did the venison chop and new york strip ragout. We usually stay away from medium rare cooked meats as it is usually too rare for us to appreciate but these folks got the perfect nutter crust and the meat cooked just right inside. I didn't have to fight with my meat for sure and would have been very upset if for the pricing that had been the case. All the sides suited the meats well. The venison was served with parsnips, barley, puree and brussel sprouts while the ragout was served with potatoes, spinach, leeks, packed eggs. I liked the presentation in that the meat sort of took center stage on the plate while the sides were displayed all around it instead of towered on top of each other. It looked like the meal was filling even before we ate it, and quite frankly there was enough meat on that plate that we were unable to finish our dinner.

It seems like they've avoided the fusion route, sticking to a menu of Vietnamese classics. Without further ado, onto the food:\\n\\nH Tiu Kh√¥ (Tossed Noodles) - Excellent toppings and a rich, flavorful sauce. However, slightly let down by lackluster noodles. I would still recommend if if you prefer dry noodles versus pho/soup noodles. - 4/5\\n\\nB√∫n B√≤ Hu (Spicy Noodle Soup) - Fantastic broth but everything else was just okay or just slightly better than your typically pho place. Still a solid choice for people who like spicy broth - 4/5\\n\\nCh Gi√≤ (Crispy Spring Rolls with Pork & Black Mushrooms) $7 - Amazing. Pastry was light and fried to perfection. Fillings were generous and full of flavor. Only slight complaint was that it was almost falling apart but that was probably due to the thinness of the pastry. Possibly one of the best fried Vietnamese spring rolls I've tried in the city. 5/5\\n\\nIn a nice change from your typical pho place, service was flawless.

Infact, a week did not even pass. Boyfriend and I had a great dinner here that included done of the things they offered at the Elite event, hello aranchi!\\n\\nThroughout the week leading up to our dinner we examined the menu closely. We decided on getting small plates to better sample what they have to offer. Quickly their truffle Parmesan fries made the list. We also decided on the Arancini, Mussels, and the Grilled Asparagus & Wild Mushrooms Pizza.\\n\\nWe did not made a single bad selection because our dinner was fantastic. By far my favorite were the truffle Parmesan fries. Crispy, hot and flavorful. The truffle or Parmesan were flavor not overpowering and balanced well. The fries came with ketchup but you should just leave it to the side. The mussles were not what we were expecting but really enjoyable. The mussles were taken out of their shells, which definently made eating them more conventient. The Arancini were filled with short rib pieces and was so good with the crunchy exterior and the creamy, tender interior. They were served with a rich sauce that was a nice touch to compliment the meat filling. Lastly, we ordered a pizza. The pizza was a bit more done for my liking but the crunch contrasted the toppings nicely.\\n\\nAlthough we were satisifed with our dinner we continued in to dessert. Boyfriend and I split the Mocha Semifreddo. It was delicious! The semifreddo was served with Salted Caramel & Chocolate Sauce, both delightfully rich!\\n\\nThis place is nicely decorated with muted walls and a ceiling that is lit with accent lighting. The busy kitchen is at the end of the long space. The setup works well for service but I find the tables were a bit more close together than what I perfer. While the closeness allows you to easily see your neighbors' meals, resulting in some food swooning, it also allows you to squeeze between the tiny bit of space to get to the booth side. A sway to much and youre going to knock over your neighbors glass."},{"name":"Teatro","address":"177 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The food is great for the price - I recommend the mushroom and goat cheese pizza as well as the prosciutto with poached egg.

If you're dreaming of exploring the vast flavors of Africa, you're going to be disappointed. If you're looking for a vague and very slight introduction in a beautiful restaurant, you may like it. Read on for more.\\n\\nLocation/Atmosphere:\\nBoma is located in the Animal Kingdom lodge. It's absolutely gorgeous, Disney really spared no expense on the lobby of the hotel. The restaurant itself is attractive with a lot of unique architectural features to look at. \\n\\nFood:\\nNormally, I'm not a fan of buffets. It's no doubt one of the worst ways to serve food, usually you find empty bins of the good stuff and full ones that nobody wanted that are now practically inedible. On the good side for Boma, this place does a steady business, so really nothing sits out for any period of time. As a result, you don't tend to find things that have gone hard, soft, covered in a film, etc. Nothing lasts very long, so it's all pretty fresh. Calling this African cuisine isn't too far from calling Taco Bell Mexican cuisine, although there are a few nods to true regional cuisine. Most of what you'll find is \\"inspired\\" by African flavors, or is a non-African dish such as coleslaw renamed to sound African. That being said, I found most of what I ate pretty flavorful, but never spicy-hot. They avoid heat, us ridiculous American's can't take it. For us vegetarians, there are AMPLE choices, just walk away from the meat station. Oh, and the dessert station is evil, and I may have made a couple trips there for uhhhhh \\"research\\" for my report. *cough* \\n\\nService:\\nIt's a buffet. It's Disney. That equals pretty good service for a buffet, or pretty mediocre service for a sit-down restaurant. Let's call it \\"acceptable\\" and move on. Note: If your party is 6 or more, there's an auto 18% gratuity added. Pretty generous for a buffet, I hope they're sharing with the kitchen staff. \\n\\nOverall:\\nPersonally, I prefer Jiko right across the hall. More authentic African flavors, as well as a vegetarian menu (you have to ask for it!). But Jiko is a bit more fancy/expensive. If you're with family or a big group, Boma is a solid bet with options for everyone. As with most Disney restaurants, it's on the expensive side for what you're getting, but it's a great place to meet friends who are in town staying at Disney."},{"name":"Anh and Chi","address":"3388 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Amazing food!

We almost ignored the \\"quiche\\", which would've been a mistake, because the quiche alone was amazing, elevated to new heights on the tomatoes.\\nManchego Biscuits & Quince Jam - 4/5, fluffy, flaky, cheesy biscuits and jam. Salt, sweet, fruity, and cheesy, meld together.\\nGoat cheese cheesecake - 4/5, tastes exactly as you can imagine. The figs provided the perfect traditional counterpoint to the sharp goat cheese flavor, which was also subdued with a bed of honey.\\n\\nService was cool, unobtrusive, and attentive.

We enjoyed it enough to stop in for breakfast 2-4 times per month.  Most of the time everything has been very good, although one morning when we took a visiting friend there for breakfast our oatmeal was served to us cold.  We happened to be staying to eat that morning, so we were able to ask them to please heat it up.  This was done in a rather grudging manner, but we chalked it up to someone having a bad day.  \\n\\nMost of the time we ordered our breakfast items \\"to go\\".   The items typically consisted of a ham/egg/cheese sandwich and one Morning Glory Oatmeal.  Each time we took our order to go, our food was piping hot and STAYED hot for at least 10 minutes.  However, one morning my husband and I stopped in right around 7:30am and ordered our usual.  Our food was prepared reasonably quickly and when our name was called we took our bag of food and left.  Unfortunately, we did not check the bag before leaving.  10 minutes later the breakfast sandwich was cold & mushy, and my $7.00 oatmeal was stone cold.  Even worse, the portion size was approximately 1/2 the size I had always received.  Cold, $7.00 oatmeal  1/2 the normal portion size was definitely not the way to start the morning.    \\n\\nI used my card on that day and received a Square receipt.  When prompted by Square to click on the \\"happy\\" or \\"sad\\" face, I clicked on the \\"sad\\" face and answered the questions that resulted.  There was wording there that suggested that I would receive a reply from JoLa.  Nope .  No apology, no explanation...just nothing.  I also wrote a note to the \\"management\\" in the link on JoLa's website.  Once again, no response.  IMO, this is absolutely unforgivable and shows just how little a business cares about their customers.\\n\\nWe have absolutely no plans to ever return to JoLa again.

There are various platters, but the vegetarian one comes with falafel, mini pizzas, tabouli, spinach pie, vege grape leaves, and dipping sauces. It's probably enough to split with someone else if you eat enough pita bread in the beginning. Also delicious are the kabobs served on a bed of rice with a side salad. And if you are trying to really save money, the chicken gyros are less than $6 and they are both filling and tasty. \\n\\nThis place is a must-go, you won't be disappointed with anything you order. The service is great, food comes out fast (and pita fills you up in the meantime) and the variety of dishes is endless."},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"This is disappointing review to write.

It's a little pricey as most hotpot is, but its a really amazing treat-yo-self type of place. \\nTo start off, the house spicy broth that we ordered was so incredibly flavorful. The soup was covered with a thick layer of hot oil and chili peppers. The herbs and spices give off an intoxicating aroma and really got me excited for the meal. I'm not sure what some of them were, but I definitely picked up on star anise and bay leaf. For a group of four, we ended up ordering according to their recommendations three different meats: New Zealand lamb, American Kobe beef and pork shoulder. We also ordered a veggie combo which was insanely huge! We thought it was per person, but luckily the waiter let us know it was for four people. It included Napa cabbage, bok choy, lettuce (?), spinach, a little potato, daikon and corn. On the side, we also ordered some fried tofu because it's my favorite hot pot accompaniment. There were so many options to choose from, but what we ordered turned out to be a perfect amount of food. \\nAll the meats were fantastic and so fresh but hands down the New Zealand lamb was the best. It was so flavorful and paired perfectly with the house spicy broth. We ended up wishing we had just ordered that meat, though the other ones were also very good! The veggies came out in an enormous bowl, er bucket, might be a more appropriate term. The Napa, bok choy and spinach cooked down, soaking up all the delicious broth. We all got sides of rice, which I think was a good choice. The soup is definitely spicy and having something to cut the spice with was important.

That made the breakfast worth it to me. \\n\\nBut strictly speaking regarding the food, it was just OK. The indoor seating and theming was lovely. I couldn't stop staring at the beautiful ceiling and chandeliers. \\n\\nA huge pro was that fountain drinks were self serve, so free refills! I like to grab a cup of ice water before I leave the comfort of AC back into the heat and humidity. \\n\\nThis was our first time using mobile ordering. I definitely recommend it because you can skip the longer line for ordering. We paid when we got there, and then found a table. The servers walk around with food carts and bring your order to you. I'm not sure how they find people because we didn't have any pager or anything. Because of that, it felt disorganized to me but we didn't have to wait too long. \\n\\nCroissant Doughnut $25: I only tried a bite of this but it was the better or the 2 entrees we tried. Price is steep, even by Disney standards in my opinion. It does come with an assortment of pastries for sharing, and a beverage. The pastries tasted like basic grocery store purchases to me.  \\n\\nCroque Madame $25: This was decent. Edible, but nothing to write home about. It also comes with pastries and a beverage. \\n\\nWe ordered 2 entrees and that came with a plate of 5 small pastries for sharing: croissant, chocolate filled flakey pastry, chocolate muffin, blueberry muffin, and a danish. \\n\\nMaster's Cupcake $4.99: This is topped with the grey stuff and it's...all right. I believe it's supposed to be cookies and cream, but it was really light in flavor. The cupcake itself was very moist, but overall it still tasted a bit plain. \\n\\nI would want to come back to try their lunch menu if I could get a reservation.

You want brown rice? They have that too.\\n-GOOD veggies....the mushrooms are especially amazing. I am sick of mediocre carrots, Boston! Take some lessons from Wagamama.\\n-Sweet potato fries unlike any other. Cut in large chunks, they are incredibly tasty and perfectly cooked; not greasy at all and one serving is NOT enough for 2 hungry people. I would be willing to make this a meal in itself, except it would be better served with another dipping sauce.\\n\\n\\nCons:\\n-There isn't one of these in California.\\n-No Pho or Bun....but I get the impression that this is intentional.\\n-The sweet potato dipping sauce is badly camouflaged mayonnaise. \\n\\n\\n\\nUntil visiting Boston, I had never heard of Wagamama. While in a a department store, we asked the incredibly awesome sales guy where to eat, and he suggested since we were heading toward the mall anyway, why not go to Wagamama? My friend said that he had been there before and gave it a thumbs up, so we headed over. Quickly. With much hunger.\\n\\nApparently, Wagamama is very big in the UK, but the only U.S. locations are in the Boston area.  Now, in general, I have not found Boston to be a mecca of fresh and awesome food, but Wagamama is the exception. As my BFF (who lives in Boston) puts it, \\"The food here tastes incredibly fresh and tasty....you know, considering we're in Boston.\\"\\n\\nDon't worry Boston, I'm not hating on you, or your food. It has its own unique flavor, and I am a HUGE fan of the quantity, if not always the quality. There is food every block that you walk, and it all looks good enough that I am willing to try pretty much every place I have come across. But as a traveler, Wagamama is appealing because I feel like I am actually getting veggies that are not drowned in butter, and a portion size that is reasonable so that I am not tempted to over eat. \\n\\nI was able to taste 4 different dishes here and I would order any one of them again.  The sweet potato fries are amazing and they also do a great job with Udon. The rice tastes fresh and is perfectly cooked, and all of the sauces are appropriate in weight and saltiness.\\n\\nThe service was really great.  The manager actually took really great care of us; I think the panicked look of thirst and hunger on our faces drove him to be especially attentive to our needs which included having a crapload of water on the table at all times. \\n\\nThe restaurant also holds a lot of diners; I get the feeling that at peak times it could be a little uncomfortable to sit cafeteria style so that the conversation you are having about last night's threesome is overheard by the soccer mom next to you, but hey, to each his own. We were there during a lull and were able to request a booth, so it was great. \\n\\nI haven't tried the ramen because it is not my first noodle choice, nor did I get to enjoy any dessert, but I look forward to it during my next Boston trip. \\n\\nI would come back here anytime."},{"name":"Grainmaker","address":"91 Summer St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Was excited to try this place, a fan of Southeast Asian food and was curious to see how the build-a-bowl idea would translate.

Don't get me wrong, it's a great place, but come on, we waited over an hour to be seated WITH reservations.\\n\\nOk now that I have vented... the place is beautiful. It really does feel like you are stepping into a set of the movie. The main ballroom is huge and they have these beautiful huge chandeliers that adorn the high ceilings of the ballroom. Outside of all the loud talk and the crying of all the tired children, it really does feel pretty magical.\\n\\nThey also have a few other dining areas to the left and to the right of the main ballroom. The left dining room is themed around the beast with so much detail including clawed at drapery and rugs. My favorite part of this room is that it's dark and they have the magical rose sitting at the corner of the dark room. It's beautiful! To the right of the main dining area, they have a bigger room where they display a statue of belle and the beast dancing. It also rotates 360. I was impressed\\n\\nWhere the place is lacking is the service piece. Though they were very attentive, I sensed the waiters (at least our waitress) was almost annoyed with us. She had this look of \\"hi yea whatever... what do you want\\" She was clearly agitated when we asked questions or we asked her to repeat herself. we were almost afraid to ask any questions because she had this agitated look consistently. Oh well\\n\\nThe food was tasty and pleasantly filling. I had the steak. It wasn't a high end cut but it hit the spot and made me content!! The place also serves beer and wine. The only place you can get alcohol in the magic kingdom!! And oh boy the desserts are freshly made and delicious!!! I had the chocolate dessert!! It was sooo tasty and a great way to finish off my meal\\n\\nThe most exciting part about this place is that The Beast comes out every thirty minutes or so and makes himself available for picture taking!!

Due to the menu change and impatient staff I got flustered and ordered the Turkey Bacon Ranch (read: anti hummus veggie). It wasn't bad, just disappointing. The flavor was salt; not turkey or bacon. Just salt.\\n\\nThe BF ordered a Chipotle Chicken Club flatbread and I WISH I would have taken a photo. There was, and I am being generous here, 4-5 half strips of chicken. I don't even recall any bacon but I do know we were both feeling sub-par after our visit. \\n\\nThe smoothie was pretty much the same, though I don't imagine a 3 ingredient smoothie could change all that much.

My family and I are natives to the Decatur area, so we've eaten at EVERY indian restaurant in the Decatur/ATL area for the past 25 years!!!\\n\\nZyka has the 2nd best butter chicken in ATL and of all the Indian restaurants I've had in NYC, Chicago, San Francisco, Philly, LA etc! It's authentic tasting (not bland and watered down so it's more palatable for Americans) with the right amount of kick. Their chili chicken and chicken 65 also are very tasty and a family favorite. Best butter chicken I've ever had was from this small to-go-restaurant inside Cherians Indian Grocery store; unfortunately, the place has closed down. =( \\n\\nWhen you walk in, you go to the front counter and check-out their menu (pictures are also posted as a slideshow on their TV). You place your order, pay and grab a table. While you wait for your food, go grab all of your dining needs from the left corner of the restaurant. You will find: plastic utensils, paper cups, cold water, napkins, straws etc. Listen for your order number/name to be called out, grab your tray and enjoy! If you want to order more food or forgot to order something, just go back to counter and place another order =)\\n\\nA few things to note:\\n- serving size is relatively small compared to the usual American portion sizes. Everything is a la carte, so if you want basmati rice or naan, be sure to order that!\\n- after you're done, you must dispose of your trash in the nearby trashcan. Everything is served in styrofoam plates, so you just toss everything in the trash afterwards.\\n- remember, this is a self-serve restaurant.

My brother was visiting from school and he said he'd go with me. I also have a friend who works there, and thought maybe she'd be there too. \\n\\nWe went at an off-hour, around 4 or so, so I can't really tell if it was \\"busy\\" or not. The interior was what I expected, and you will surely never want for a TV. In my head I even thought \\"I wonder if they've got TVs in the bathrooms, geez!.\\" (They do.) \\n\\nApparently my brother liked the short skirt/kilt thing the waitresses wear. I, of course, don't give a crap. \\n\\nWe sat in the bar area at a corner table. Two middle aged women were just finishing up a meal, and a group of older gentlemen were having beers. A group of three people that I believe was a girl, her dad, and her gay, were ponied up to the bar. It didn't take too long for the girl behind the bar to come take our first orders. As an appetizer, I ordered the Scotch eggs, and little bro got the Cornish crab cakes (at my insistence). \\n\\nThe Scotch eggs were more flavorful than the ones at Sherlocks, but I'd avoid using the mustard that came with it; it's too overpowering. The crab cakes were surprisingly excellent; they weren't fishy and were actually quite flavorful. Overall, I'd reorder the crab cakes, but the Scotch eggs were somewhat unremarkable. At this point I also ordered a Newcastle from a pretty good beer selection. \\n\\nFor entrees we went traditional British: fish 'n chips for me, Shepard's Pie for him. According to him the Shepard's Pie was delicious, and I could tell the portion was generous. The most important thing for my fish was that it not taste too fishy, and it didn't, so I was satisfied. It came with two good sized fillets and I got a dish of Guinness mac and cheese. \\n\\nMidway through out entrees my friend arrived for work (yay!), and she was glad to hear we liked everything. She personally made me my dessert (traditional English trifle), which was a nice light ending to the meal. She said next time I should try their bread pudding, which she described as amazing. \\n\\nSo overall, this quiet mid-afternoon \\"linner\\" went quite well. After reading some of these reviews before I went, I was extremely cautious of the food, but it came out just fine. There's nothing I'd say that was particularly phenomenal, but for pub food, it got an A. \\n\\nAs for the negatives, I couldn't help but muse about the rather unfortunate location. There's nothing else around it, so logistically it makes it a difficult place to integrate as part of a larger evening; it's a bit far, so not conducive to bar hopping. However, it's also too far for anyone NW to want to drive to if they'll be drinking, and the South siders have downtown/SoCo to entertain them, so there's no need to travel here for them. Basically, it makes sense for the Westlake neighborhood. And that's what I suspect a lot of the clients end up being--an older Westlake crowd. \\n\\nAlso, something that crossed my mind (but may not be applicable to what is essentially a chain restaurant) was the size of the menu. It's a pretty involved menu (19 appetizers alone, 7 soups, 14 sandwiches, a dozen British entrees, a dozen Yank entrees, and a whole range of desserts). If there's one thing I took from Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares is that he always tells a restaurant, and especially a pub, to SIMPLIFY the menu. The danger is sometimes the menu is split in so many directions that the overall quality suffers. That did NOT happen here, but it was the first time I ever thought a menu could be trimmed. As Tim Gunn always says: edit, edit, edit! \\n\\nIs it sad that my directions in life seem to come from people on TV. Don't judge me!!!\\n\\nAnyways, I rank this a 3 1/2 stars, but will round up to four because I would definitely go back. It's nice to have a British pub in Austin."},{"name":"Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical Revue - Temporarily Unavailable","address":"4510 N Fort Wilderness Trl","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"An absolute must do.

Marike's food is just  above average, but the ingredients are fresh, the portions are just right, and the food is made with love and--given the other choices in the area--this really is the tops. One foodie score - Marike's does have a way with the home fries.\\nWhat is so wonderful about this place is the mother and daughter team that run it. You walk in and it immediately feels like home. The mother is, quite possibly, the sweetest and warmest woman on the planet. She welcomes you into her home like you're a neighborhood kid -- no matter how old you are -- and treats everyone in there like family.\\nThe daughter, on the other hand, is totally funny, fun, capable and completely brash.

Highly recommended."},{"name":"Zyka","address":"1677 Scott Blvd","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"So conflicted with this restaurant. I had  a very mixed experience here. I tried the chef's recommended mutton curry, the chicken 65, and the naan. The first thing i noticed when looking at the menu was that it was really cheap. around 6 bucks for entree items. After I got my food, I realized why that was. It's really not a lot of food. Each entree is served in a small plastic bowl, the same size you'd expect when you buy a pack of 50 styrofoam bowls from walmart for a couple bucks. You know what i mean. It makes the price seem a lot less attractive. \\n\\nAmbiance: casual and comfortable. Lots of space to sit, and room to walk around. \\n\\nService: well, its an indian restaurant so be prepared to get your own water from the water station in the corner. Otherwise, they're very nice up front. \\n\\nFood: \\n\\nMutton curry (2.5/5) - Didn't like it much. You can tell the onions were cooked to a very deep brown when this curry was made, and although this might be the essence of this dish, it made for an overly robust flavor that wasn't balanced out by any acidity or lightness. Don't recommend unless you're an Indian uncle who knows what they're getting into with this very heavily flavored dish. \\n\\nChicken 65 (4/5) - Probably the best chicken 65 I've had. I got it to go, and man it was good. Perfectly fried with a good amount of spice. The only reason I deducted a star was because it wasn't a lot of chicken. Other pictures on yelp made me feel like I was scammed a bit here, and the to-go portion seems a LOT smaller than the in-house portion. The sauce they provided with the chicken was delicious though. It's like a garlicy raita or something. Superb. I'd order it again. \\n\\nNaan (5/5) - Perfect naan. Some of the best I've had. It's buttery, its fresh, and its amazing. It's really airy, and when you pull it apart you can tell it's still very moist inside. It pairs very nicely with the food, and I highly recommend it if you like naan. \\n\\nOverall, not bad. I think i'd like to try some of the other items. I think part of the reason I felt my curry was so disappointing was also the fact that I had a lot of bones in my portion. It just was not worth ordering to me. This was a little annoying considering it was the chef's recommendation. I think the chicken curries might be more worth it to try. Don't be fooled by the low prices though, they're about the same as your average indian restaurant once you factor in portion size."},{"name":"Continental Seafood Restaurant","address":"11700 Cambie Road, Suite 150","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"Just had dim sum with my family.

For a place open for less than a month. it's doing OK. It is nicely decorated, not too much different than Beef Obradys original decor.

It was happy hour and my friend wanted a glass of wine but happy hour was only at the bar, but Larry would ask. I wanted to try the home made soda & went with the root beer. Larry brought our drinks and the root beer was flat, and syrupy sweet. I sent it back and they returned with a proper root beer. Apparently, I got the bottom of the barrel. They gave us some nacho chips and cucumber salsa. Nice to try a taste, but I don't care for cucumbers, so I wouldn't recommend eating a bowl of it. My friends liked it, though. \\n\\nIt is pretty loud, between the music and the crowd. I think there are a few too many tables and it makes it congested.

Another half hor for main course-which came after I spoke with the hostess and told her we were going to leave.  During this time, we watched the cooks wander outside for at least two breaks.

We were excited by the menu and happy that the prices weren't terrible (we hate places that force you to do prix fixe on holidays). The food was pretty good! We got the prosciutto pizza with gorgonzola and fig and it was very delicious. My husband ordered the steak with truffle fries and I ordered the scallops. My scallops were so delicious and the fries were outstanding (super crispy, which is my favorite) but my husband was a little disappointed by his steak. However, we were really disappointed by our dessert choice. We ordered the dark chocolate cake, which our server recommended, and it was terribly dry (was it made in an Easy-Bake oven??) and was really lacking in any exciting flavors. Vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce? Not the most creative toppings. Overall, the food was pretty good and the prices weren't outrageous. \\n\\nWhat brought the review down to 3 stars was our server, who was honestly terrible. When we sat down we ordered our drinks right away. I ordered a Moscow Mule. Apparently our server didn't know what I said or what it was, but didn't clarify it with me before placing the order. 10 minutes later I was brought a shot of tequila. A few minutes after telling the server that no, that wasn't what I wanted, the manager comes over to take my order. Another few minutes goes by and she returns to tell me that they don't have ginger beer. I was pretty annoyed at this point, as my husband received his drink already minutes before, but I found another drink to order. About 20 minutes after sitting down for dinner I was finally served my drink. \\n\\nThe most annoying thing about our service was our server was rarely around throughout the evening. We would look for him throughout the evening to order another drink, but he was no where to be found. I noticed another table was looking around for him, too. We had to ask for another drink when we were already empty, which isn't a huge deal, but an experienced waiter at a nice restaurant would've noticed it before we were empty and asked if we wanted another. Then, at the end of the night I told our waiter that I'd like to order a dessert martini and would like to see a menu. He brings us the menu and I order the drink first and then the dessert. My drink never came. 10 minutes later he shows up with our check and my husband reminds him that I never got my drink. His reply? \\"Sorry, I didn't hear you.\\" \\n\\nWe really expected much better service at a restaurant like this.

Mondays they have 5 dollar mex martinis, and theirs are among the best in Austin.  \\n\\nThey have a great outdoor area with retractable cover for rain/shade, and you can seat yourselves outside, which I like. I wouldn't suggest going with a large group though, unless you want to show up very early.  They only seat tables up to 6 or 8.  Their rule is to not seat incomplete parties also, so make sure you show up together.\\n\\nThe food is about average or a little better for Austin Tex-mex.  I particularly like the chile relleno.  A good tip they don't tell you is that you can substitute your rice and beans with any meal for any of their sides."},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"The restaurant needs to reserve on Disney app in advance.

The food is surprisingly good and they also offered all kinds of bread land a small plate of fruit along with your main dish. The bread are very delicious but it's too much and I couldn't finish them all. They also have unlimited fountain soda and their hot chocolate is very rich. I spent around $27 for lunch.

It's a great place to come not just for their coffee, but for their food as well.  My Bostonian friend was raving about the Crema Grilled Chicken so we knew that we had to get that.  It's a sandwich made with tender pieces of chicken breast, fresh avocado, corn, and cotija cheese and pressed together into a panini.  The result is an oozing hot sandwich with a delicious combination of flavors.  Make sure you order chips with your sandwich because their chips are homemade!  They're thinly sliced sweet potatoes that are deep fried and transformed into delectable chips.  Pair all this with the creamy tomato bisque and you've got yourself a delicious meal.\\n\\nAlso had the chocolate chai french macaron.  This was delicious, and you could really taste the chai embedded in the chocolate filling.  I would pass on the salted caramel cupcake though. \\n\\nCan't finish this review without a mention of their coffee.  At first sip I knew the coffee beans here were something special.

For example, their Brother sandwich is a delicious medley of molasses-like cured pork belly, perfect complementary greens, signature eggs, an incredible flavorable cheese, and other spices on a very tasty baguette.  The problem: you end up with a giant mess when trying to eat it.  I agree with another reviewer who suggested that a utensil is needed.  The main issue is the texture and size of the bread.  At Yolk, it's chewy (not hard) and thin, so everything slides out the sides.  Moreover, the eggs are bound to run all over, so you can add sticky to the mess.  Not too many sandwich places have mastered this, Meat, Cheese, Bread is definitely one that does.  Handling aside, Yolk offers some delicious fare.  Don't skip on the delicious side greens with bacon.  It's not the best deal for $4; I wish you get more for $5 or that they would lower the price a bit.  I never cared for the seating at this mini-pod as the wind blows all over the place, there always seems to be yellow jackets flying about and there's no protection from the rain.  Service is a tad slow even if yours is the only order.  Their complimentary sea salt and homemade red pepper sauce are a very nice touch.

When I pointed out to one of the cheerful but clueless dining room staff that I would not have ordered the SIDE of chips if I had been told by the order-taker that my entree also came with chips, she instantly summoned the manager.\\n\\nThe manager arrived and asked what was wrong; I explained the situation and he told me that the chips ARE listed on the menu with the quesadillas.\\n\\nA quick consultation with the printed menus on display at the entrance showed him to be incorrect as I stated. I also suggested that he spend some time educating his order-takers on what is on their own menu and to assist the customers when they order so as to avoid these kind of problems.\\n\\nIn all, mediocre food; clueless staff.

It was similar to the tastes I am used to with dim sum. Everything was very good. The rice rolls definitely stood out especially since half of the dim sum spots we went to did not have them. The beef with parsley is my favorite. We ordered a variety of rice rolls: minced fish & bean curd skin, Chinese doughnut [fried dough], dried shimp & onion, and mushrooms. Another item I really liked were the egg tarts. They come out very hot. Again, everything else was very good. We also had pan fried daikon cake, Spare ribs & pumpkin, chicken feet, beef ribs, sweet durian stick rice cake, and an assortment of dumplings. Like other dim sum spots in Vancouver, you order via a sheet and the food is made to order. If you order enough, they bring it all in the dim sum carts. The prices were also great. We ate a ton and the bill was $85 [We were somehow given a 20% discount. We think it was because we ordered so much]. I also loved that the restaurant has its own large parking lot with plenty of spots in the front and back.\\n\\nIf you are visiting Vancouver and looking for recommendations, feel free to message me through Yelp and I can share my itinerary, which includes my Yelp reviews.

Unfortunately, the restaurants I have been to in the city typically pale in comparison to the better restaurants in the surrounding area.  I guess it comes down to restaurants in the 'burbs needing to try harder to get customers to make the trip.\\n\\nAnyway, I started with the clam chowder which again - was decent but not great.  They claim that it's \\"Award Winning\\" but unfortunately it was just above mediocre compared to other chowders I've had.  The texture was pretty good - hearty without being too thick, but the clams were a bit on the chewy side and the overall flavor was way too salty in my opinion.\\n\\nNext I had the mixed seafood grill.  It was a bit on the pricey side at $35.00, so obviously I was expecting something pretty good. What I got was simply okay.  There was one crab cake of decent size, but a bit dry in texture. Flavor was again okay, but nothing special.  The Shrimp were quite good and cooked perfectly, but there were only three of them and they were of modest size.  The Salmon tasted good, but a bit overcooked. It was supposed to come with mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.  The potatoes were good, but there were only two asparagus stalks.  My biggest complaint about the dish is that there was too much sauce which made the meal seem heavy and made it difficult to enjoy the seafood flavors.\\n\\nMy wife ordered the fillet, cooked medium.  It arrived in an uber-rare state.  They took it back no questions asked and threw some more heat under it.  When it came back it was cooked to their satisfaction.  Her only complaint about the steak was that the steak was charred as opposed to seared (which is her preference). \\n\\nThe drinks seemed a bit watered down.  I had a Hendricks martini, which was very weak and only filled 2/3 of the glass.  My wife complained that her wine was watered-down tasting as well.  I'm not sure what the brand was.\\n\\nWe ended up not staying for desert, so I can't comment on that.

This restaurant has a very cool design both in-side and outside, and is located in an amazing setting overlooking Boston Harbor and the City of Boston.   We were there are a beautiful Sunday afternoon in July, with lots of well-dressed mostly 30 to 40 year olds who were eating brunch and having cocktails. This restaurant has a nice public waterfront in front to lounge at, and the Boston taxi service is located directly in front to get you to more cool waterfront places.  If that sounds good enough for you, then this place is perfect.  You'll love it.\\n\\nOkay, now what Reelhouse is not.  First, it is NOT fining dining, or even good dining.  It is a place to eat.  The menu for at least brunch was very limited and not creative.  The food is average at best.  I would say if you close your eyes the food has more in common with a 99 than it does to say Row 34 or the dozens of new well-priced creative dining options that have sprung up through the City over the last five years.\\n\\nThis place is NOT a place to drink craft cocktails.  We were served mediocre, low-alcohol common drinks in small plastic cups overfilled with ice.  Regarding your expectations for craft cocktails, think the outdoor deck of a 99 and not say Yvonne's, Baldwin Bar or any of the true craft cocktail locations that have sprung up through the City over the last five years.\\n\\nThis is NOT a place to enjoy professional, experienced service.  Our server literally did not hint at a smile the entire time he waited on us. He could not appear more bored and uninterested in what he was doing.    He was not particularly familiar with menu, did not stop back often, failed to bring a second spoon for the chowder we were splitting, despite the fact that we asked for one after not getting one in the first place.  The restaurant is hosted and waited by 20 somethings who are relatedly good looking but have no clue about a dining experience.  Yup, think 99 and not say Menton or the any of the other true fine dining experiences that have sprung up through the City over the last five years.\\n\\nLastly, the valet experience.  When I read Yelp reviews I usually ignore the ones where reviewers  complain about an experience unless I see it repeated.  Could just be one or two people at the restaurant and I may not experience it if I go there. However, my experience really illustrates the inexperience and attitude of the staff.  I am not sure if this is repeated, but the valet experience was a disaster.  I gave my ticket to the hostess and waited about 15 minutes, but no car.  I checked with the valet and he said it was coming.  I waited another 10 minutes and checked back again.  He said they didn't have my ticket and asked me to provide it to them to make it easier to find.  I brought him back into the restaurant and asked the hostess what she did with the ticket.  She said she couldn't fully remember and she pointed to a third person.  Total confusion and finger pointing among what ultimately became 4 of them.  Then they said the finally found the car. I walk outside and see that they have the wrong Jeep.   I told them I would walk to the lot and get it myself, which I did. I found the car but they couldn't find the key. I waited outside the locked car for another 10 minutes before the valet walked back to the remote lot and said the key was in the valet box outside the restaurant all along.  Oh that's great.  Forty minute wait, and no offer to comp the $12 valet fee.  \\n\\nLastly, there is NOTHING to do near this restaurant...just this restaurant in what perhaps 5 or 10 years has the potential to be the next Liberty Wharf with a better view. Maybe then you'll be able to enjoy the location AND your dining experience."},{"name":"Barley's Brewing Company","address":"467 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"For some reason, everytime I went by this place I thought it was empty...not the case!

It is difficult to get a reservation and I have no interest in waiting in line in the blazing sun for a quick service meal. The theming is elaborate and grand, there's lots of Disney Imagineering on display here. After a mishap on the monorail we were running late for our ADR, so we were whisked inside and immediately directed to a computer terminal to place our order. This is efficient, though quite impersonal. We were told to find any available seat in the restaurant and somehow our food would be delivered (there is no receipt/table number, so Disney must use some combo of MagicBand/Big Brother to match guests to their meals).\\n\\nMy big issues with breakfast are selection and price. Every adult entree is $20 and every kids' entree is $12. That's pricey, even for Disney -- if you want an egg sandwich, that's $20; if your kid wants Fruit Loops, that's $12. The meal does include a lovely mini pastry tray for the table to share, but all I kept thinking is that for a few bucks more, I could be at The Crystal Palace buffet eating more/better food.\\n\\nWe were able to find a seat in the coveted West Wing, which is probably much better at dinner. It was a little odd to be sitting in a dark, eerie room at 9 o'clock on a warm sunny morning. You can also watch a fake rose periodically drop some petals, if that's your thing.\\n\\nA minute after finding our seats, a staffer wheeled an elaborate cart over to us and delivered our entrees. I chose the meat and cheese tray and it was fine, but so overpriced. My friends both picked the open faced egg sandwich, which seemed tasty but hard to eat. We were done with our meal in about 15 minutes, which was great in terms of getting our touring day started but disappointing considering the price. \\n\\nI think the breakfast options are just too expensive and too unremarkable to be worth your time/money.

Good food is a must, but Continental does all the extra little things well to put it over the top: unique specialties, ample space and convenient parking, and my personal favorite - push carts! This is our go-to place in Richmond.\\n\\nThis is a mid- to upper-class place. Not nearly as fancy (nor as pricey!) as some of the overhyped places, the food is often great and occasionally divine. The shrimp dumplings (ha gow), my bell weather for dim sum quality, are fresh, large, and mouthwatering. But Continental has good specialties too: my favorite is the durian mochi. Perfect if you enjoy durian!\\n\\nImportantly, they make your experience easy. For one, it's located in a big parking lot. None of this tiny Richmond plaza mess. For another, the inside is very spacious with ample seating. I've never had to wait for a table nor felt cramped bumping elbows with the auntie next to me. The operative word is easy. \\n\\nFinally, call me old-fashioned but I give Continental an extra bit of love because of their push carts. With so many places moving to ordering off a menu, there's something I enjoy about being able to see my food before I order it. Plus it helps me order stuff I wouldn't normally. The push carts are a big positive for me.\\n\\nOverall, Continental does everything right and then some. In this competitive a market for dim sum, you've got to go the extra mile to make the experience a good one and Continental's done just that. Go and see for yourself!"},{"name":"Sweet Carrot","address":"1417 W 5th Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Five stars for the Brunswick stew, cornmeal pancake, mac-n-cheese and friendly fast service!

We should have ordered online prior to showing up.  The line even with our reservations was pretty long."},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Ok so here's the deal with Be Our Guest. It is an absolutely BEAUTIFUL restaurant that will transform you back to your childhood obsession with Disney. The food is actually really great and the service is definitely on point! So why do I give it 4 stars? Well, actually getting in to be able to experience all of its awesomeness is quite the mission! If you are planning a Disney vacation for next year I would suggest you make a reservation NOW... Yes, NOW! My cousin made a reservation last December for a day in June! Getting a reservation is the easiest way of getting inside the Beast's castle, but it does take quite a bit of advanced planning and doesn't really help if you are already at Disney or going in the near future. \\n\\nMost people will tell you to go for lunch, which is like typical Disney counter service and requires roughly an hour wait in the hot Florida sun. The food is no where near the quality of the dinner menu and, while you get to see the inside (you can't go in the castle unless you are dining) its really messy and not really as \\"magical\\" as you would find it during dinner. So how then can you get inside for dinner without making reservations 7 months- 1 year in advance? Well, Disney has a standby line and a select number of tables to give to walk ins every day. The line opens at 4pm (when the restaurant opens for dinner), get there by 3:30 so you can be toward the front of the line because the number of tables given out are limited. Also, if you have more than 4 people in your party is might be close to impossible to get a table on standby. If you don't mind splitting into groups of four this might be easier. Also keep in mind that, if a table is available, they will sit you either immediately or within a few minutes. That means that you will be eating dinner around 4-4:30pm. They will tell you that you can come back later if you would like to eat later, but a cast member told us that it is virtually impossible to get in without a reservations after 6pm so we've never tried this. \\n\\nMy wife and I have eaten here three times. Twice it was just us. If you have only 2 people you should be fine. The third time we have 5 people. That time, we waited in line only for them to tell us that they don't have standby tables for more than 4 people. After speaking to a manager (because obviously they should have informed us of this prior to making us wait in line for an hour if this, in fact, was the case) they managed to accommodate our party.  We're still unclear as to whether you can actually walk in with a party larger than 4, but I would recommend you ask the reservationist or a cast member PRIOR to waiting. It's possible that things change depending on the reservations for the day. \\n\\nAlso keep in mind that the restaurant has not even been open for a year so there have been changes in operations and procedures every time that we have visited. They are definitely working out a lot of kinks, but if you can manage to get inside for dinner, you will not be disappointed. \\n\\nBetween all of our family members and our various visits, we have tried everything on the menu and have not been disappointed with anything. The steak is a favorite of mine and the truffle fries that is comes with are literally worth all the hassle to get inside. The truffle fries alone make up for the chaos to get in! The salmon is also delicious! The sauce that is come in and the potato puree is absolutely fantastic. They have creme puffs and other small cupcakes for dessert and do a cute little presentation. The passion fruit and the strawberries and creme are our favorites! \\n\\nMake sure to walk around after you finish your dinner! The West Wing is really cool and if you wait a few minutes (till the thunder starts) there is an awesome disney surprise in the portrait of the prince in that room! Also, the Beast does make nightly appearances (depending on when you go it might be a few times during your dinner) they do a cool introduction and its a really fun little addition for kids and adults alike. You can also go and take your pictures with the Beast in the study. All in all the restaurant is spectacular! It is pricey, but just like most things at Disney, you tend to get what you pay for... a really magical experience!"},{"name":"Applebee's Grill + Bar","address":"13351 Sr 535, Ste 100","city":"Orlando","stars":"2","text":"Nice place with friendly staff, the lighting was a little bit low but nice food at a great price.

But magical grown up experience, it is not. Once you make it through the front doors, you are crowded into a que with nonfunctional order screens and pushed toward a distinctly unmagical Disney employee to make your food selections. Then it is into the over-crowded tables pushed too close together to find a space to sit. This can take a while. Once you find a place, an employee pushing a food cart finds you in the crowd by your magic band. As creepy as this is, it's a cool effect for the kids. Despite not really being a sit down restaurant, there is real silverware, if it is accompanied by paper napkins and cups. The food is very French, delicious and small portions. Some children may not appreciate the French menu so make sure you reserve a time if the day that has menu options they will enjoy. Once your food is dropped off, there are no waitstaff other than the very busy cart pushers bustling around. Even so, when we flagged one down they were super helpful. Overall, the concept is great.

For appetizers, the assiette de fromages is good. The plate offers lots of variety, but for someone who isn't crazy about strong cheeses I really just enjoyed the brie. Too bad they don't offer just a small brie plate to start (rather than as a desert). The bread they bring out is also good and they are happy to replenish it. Unlike most of the high end restaurants in downtown Austin, I appreciate that they have larger serving sizes. I hate ordering an appetizer to share with a few people that looks like it can barely be split by two.\\n\\nFor the main courses, I recommend the prix fixe menu. It's a great way to try a few different dishes while keeping down costs and you will leave satisfied, and very full. To start, the Salad Lyonnaise is amazing. I have never had egg like that before, let alone on top of a bed of fresh vegetables. I absolutely love the Saumon au crabe - such delicious salmon, very succulent. The sides are always delicious whether it's baked mushroom or summer squash. \\n\\nFor dessert, I absolutely must recommend the Mousse au chocolat. The portions are huge and this chocolate mousse is rich without being overpoweringly sweet. The Cr√®me caramel lacks something to be desired, it's a rather bland flan if you're into that sort of thing. They drizzle it in a great caramel syrup but it's nearly impossible to get it on your spoon from the plate and the flan soaks nothing up. For those who'd prefer to skip the sweets, just go straight to the brie (since you can't have it as a standalone appetizer...).  The Profiterolles also look delicious, but I have not sampled them, simply seen. \\n\\nIn conclusion, for the price this place is really worth it. Lots of great French food, a nice ambiance, a relaxed/comfortable yet intimate meal, and attentive staff."},{"name":"Cantina Laredo","address":"201 W 3rd St","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Everything about this place is just OK.  It's not horrible, it's not  awesome, it just is.  It's hard to write a review when I am so benevolent about this place.\\n\\nI am a little bit of a mexican food snob, growing up in Houston.  I haven't really found a mexican food chain in Austin yet that lives up to El Tiempo or Escalantes in Houston.\\n\\nI automatically knock points off when the flour  tortillas are not homemade.   Other than the store bought tortillas, the food was just fine.  They did have pretty tasty homemade salsa.  The queso was mediocre.  The beef in the fajitas was pretty tender and decent.  The happy hour margarita tasted good, but a tad watery...at least they don't use sweet and sour mix.\\n\\nThe service was ok, we waited on water fill ups, and the waitress mysteriously disappeared the last 10 minutes of happy hour and asked if we wanted another margarita at like 7:03, but other than that the waitress was pretty attentive and friendly.\\n\\nI guess the thing that gets me the most is that it's mediocre food with a higher price tag.  It's like taking a bunch of clothes from Wal-mart and selling them at a trendy boutique downtown for double the price.

Having lived in boston for 30 plus years, we've never eaten there.\\n\\nWe were extremely surprised and delighted by the experience.  They have a prime location and could throw just about any quality of food at you but that wan't the case at all.\\n\\nWe tend to be \\"foodies\\" when we eat at a nice restaurant and this was no different.  My wife started with oysters which she said were very good, not too salty.  I had a cup of their award winning chowder and it was very good as well.  We also split the \\"east meets west\\" tuna.  It is a mix of tuna tartar and sliced tuna with avacado.  Delicious as well (the tuna tartar was better than what we had at DelFrisco's about a month earlier).  We then split a caesar salad.  Again, delecious, the dressing wasn't too garlicy (not sure if that's a word) and the romaine seemed very fresh and topped with plenty of cheese and croutons.\\n\\nFor the main course, our son had the chicken tenders and fries.  My wife and I split the blue cheese filet and the crab cakes.  The steak was OUTSTANDING!  I am a steak guy and have eaten at many steak houses across the country and this steak was better than any I've had (including DelFriscos).  The crab cakes were excellent as well.  Tender and flaky with not a lot of filler.\\n\\nThe only minor downside was, we ordered a side of the mashed potatoes as we didn't see on the menu that the steak came with mashed potatoes.  Our bad, as I assumed it was like most of the steakhouses where you have to order the sides because the steaks don't come with anything.\\n\\nWe sat on the patio, though it was a bit cool, but not unbearable.  Our waiter was very attentive and paced the meal accordingly.  They have valet parking and are right next to the aquarium and Rose Kennedy Greenway.\\n\\nWe would recommend this restaraunt to anyone visiting Boston!"},{"name":"Mighty Fine Burgers Fries & Shakes","address":"10515 N Mo-Pac Expy, Ste 105","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Arbor Walk is a weird shopping center.  Not only is it almost completely without shade, making any actual walking there in the Austin summer an exercise in masochism, but it has a totally random selection of shops.  One day while I tried to speed past the Joanne's Fabrics on my way to Spec's, hoping to pass it before my wife suggested another 2 hour insomnia-curing fabric-buying spree, my eye happened to glance over at the Mighty Fine.  This little tidbit was safely stored in the back of my mind where information goes to die, and I assumed I would never think of it again.  Then, I heard from some other random source about this place called Mighty Fine that the guys from Rudy's had opened up, and there it was again.  So, one fine day, I packed the family and shuttled everyone over to get some giant hamburgers.\\n\\nThe decor, from the hand washing station to the picnic tables complete with ridiculous checkered tablecloths, was straight out of Rudy's.  The tables are very long, so you might want to eat outside if you have a problem with sharing a table with a complete stranger.  Personally, I don't mind eating with some fat sweaty guy I've never met elbowing me every 10 seconds while he wolfs down his food if I'm at the county fair, but I prefer a more civilized experience at any establishment classy enough to have air conditioning.  So, my personal advice would be to go during the off hours or eat outside where there are a couple of smaller tables.\\n\\nThe burgers here are more than ample, and the flavor is not bad.  They aren't going to blow your mind, but the quality is on par with the price.  The fries, however, are a tragedy.  Ranging from burnt to half-raw in the same order, they are utterly without flavor.  They taste like the frozen fries you get at HEB except they cost a lot more and you don't have to heat up your own house cooking them.  The shakes are fairly average for an eatery like this, but are at least worth a try if you have some extra cash burning a hole in your pocket.\\n\\nMighty Fine is probably the best place to eat in the Arbor Walk without spending a lot of money, but there's not a whole lot of competition for that title."},{"name":"Cantina Laredo","address":"201 W 3rd St","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"My wife and I stopped in this restaurant on a slow weeknight after we strolled around downtown and did a bit of shopping. It was our first time to try it. I think we were the only table in our waiter's section, but the service was very poor.\\n\\nFirst, the waiter had no personality and seemed rushed, though it was a slow night. He took our drink orders and hurried off, without bothering to tell us about any specials or anything else. It took a while for him to return with the drinks, and we were ready to order. \\n\\nMy wife ordered a salad off the appetizer menu, and the waited said \\"ok\\" and then walked away, I guess thinking that it was a starter? I had to flag him back down and tell him she would be having that as an entree and that I was ready to order also. Good grief.\\n\\nI ordered a steak with mushrooms and stuffed bacon-wrapped shrimp. About 15 minutes later a different waiter brought out my steak, but not my wife's salad. We asked about the salad and he seemed confused and said he'd check on it. I sat there with my hands in my lap, not wanting to start eating until my wife had her meal, while I told my wife \\"I think we should have gone to Mamma Fu's\\" The manager came over after noticing us with one plate and me not eating. He too went to check. A few minutes later our waiter came back with her salad and a lame \\"sorry about that\\". \\n\\nSorry doesn't cut it at these prices. I expect better service and a more sincere effort to create a good dining experience. \\n\\nMy iced tea sat empty the entire meal. The waiter never checked back to ask how the meals were. Service sucked all around. The salad and steak dinner were ok, not great, but not bad. Not good enough to get me back in there for another try though. \\n\\nThis seems like it might be an ok place to drop in after work and have some drinks and appetizers, or to meet friends for drinks before going out, but I wouldn't trust it for a date night or a serious dinner.

I have been noticing a marked change in the overall vibe, vis a vis my original review's suggestion that the staff need not yell back and forth amongst themselves like they're out partying while they're making my sandwich. It's all open so of course the voices carry, but now it's more normal, fun but conversational. Nobody's hooting or cackling. Today I finally felt social enough to talk to a young manager-looking man wearing the manager-looking shirt. Turns out he's the new manager. See, nothin' gets by me! I think he said Jordan is his name, and he started around 8 months ago. A couple minutes chatting and it's clear that this dude is the reason for the positive change. In addition to a more pro ambience, there have been some changes to the menu and some tasty salads and sandwiches can be had, though I haven't gone back to try some of the less fortunate dishes that have been disappointing in the past. All told, pretty good show, Panera. The outlets, though.\\n\\nUPDATE June 20, 2016: On the plus side, they finally ditched the bathroom code. However, more of the power outlets have died so it's a challenge to find a place to plug in and write.

Or maybe it's more of a love/meh/hate relationship.\\n\\nThe love: Sunny, roomy, free wifi. I can usually find a table with an outlet for my laptop. Good iced tea, good coffee. Good A/C on scorcher summer days (no A/C in my home so it's a welcome relief) and best, it's not TOO cold, know what I mean? \\n\\nThe meh: Food prep, quality and ingredients is spotty. If you find something you like, stick to that. I like the Napa Chicken Salad sandwich and the Asian Chicken Salad. Other choices I have tried include the Fuji Apple Salad, Grilled Cheese, and Turkey Avocado sandwich. The Fuji Apple Salad is so weird -- the apples are dried apple chips, and I think the walnuts are candied. The grilled cheese -- a rare indulgence one looks forward to as being a warm, buttery, gooey, crispy-crusty comfort food -- was dry, on cool, dry, barely-toasted bread, and bland gelatinous cheese. Disappointing and a waste of the calories. The Turkey Sandwich was also dry and boring, and I usually love turkey & avocado together. They seem to have good bagels and baked goods but haven't tried those.\\n\\nThe hate: \\n- Those outlets? Not all of them work -- some of them are loosey-goosey when you stick your power plug into them. \\n- The staff? Okay, this is a risk since my face is pictured right on this review, but a note to the young manager lady who wears the manager-looking shirt -- BE QUIET and tell your staff to BE QUIET. YOU ARE ALL TOO LOUD. I have had to move my table from the back (near the kitchen) several times because there is a great social ruckus always going on, caroling, strident oblivious voices yakking incessantly about everything from boyfriends to school to what-have-you, cackling and hooting with laughter. You can't even hear yourself think. it's too bad because \\"the back\\" would otherwise be the quieter place to work, situated as it is in a sort of separate alcove.\\n-- Bathroom code? Ditch the bathroom code, it is entirely unnecessary. Go up and down the whole entire block, no one has a bathroom code. What's the point?\\n\\nAll told, it's convenient for a cool place to work or write with a so-so sandwich and iced tea, it's never too crowded so they let you stay all day (despite signs suggesting a 2-hour limit) and I'll keep coming back.

I'll admit that I went in with high expectations which I think are reasonable given the prices and the reputation. What a let down! We joked that they would surely reveal the hidden cameras any minute for the hilarious TV prank but sadly that never happened. We ate out almost every night this week at Oak on Fourteenth, Empire Grill, and Murphy's South. All of them served far better food than Frasca. Still joking with the wife about reporting them to the credit card company for fraud."},{"name":"Zaika Indian Bistro","address":"442 Main St","city":"Woburn","stars":"4.5","text":"Dinner here for the first time, and it will be the first of many.

Perhaps the only thing that is only implied from the name of the restaurant is their above average beer selection. Whether you're looking to sip on an Orange Blossom Pilsner or some Purple Haze, or going with a much more basic beer offering, Mellow Mushroom will be sure to accommodate you. Getting back to the pizza, I would personally recommend the Caesar. Perfect if you love caesar salad and pizza, and of course if you'd think that a caesar salad sitting atop a pizza would be delicious (it is, by the way). The garlic knots here are alright. They are more like garlic donuts or garlic balls, I wasn't too impressed when we ordered them at my table once or twice.\\n\\nAnother cool thing about Mellow Mushroom is their trivia nights. I know for a fact that they host trivia nights on Friday nights, as well as one other night of the week. Either way, it is definitely worth going and playing for a round or two. I won a pitcher of beer once when our table happened to correctly guess one of the bonus questions. That was pretty sweet. \\n\\nAt the end of the day, Mellow Mushroom is your typical college town pizza place. Except that it is a chain of restaurants, rather than being an independently owned self-glorified dive pizza pit. Still, I enjoy Mellow Mushroom's vicinity to the UCF (and also Rollins) campuses. And you can never go wrong with pizza and beer."},{"name":"Jiko - The Cooking Place - Temporarily Unavailable","address":"2901 Osceola Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Wonderful service and food at this African inspired restaurant.

We are spoken to in English, immediately given glasses of water and forks (!), and ALL of the wait staff take their time with you to explain items or help you place orders. Perhaps it's managerial policy to be this attentive to non-Asian customers.

So this is for lunch time only. This restaurant gets a lot of hype, praise, and attention for what it is and it deserves too. Its freaking Beauty and the Beast themed, and if you are Disney fan, you would love this place too. Now i'm just going to say, the biggest reason you want to visit this place is for the Beauty and the Beast decor, theme, attention to detail, environment and ambiance. Don't come here during lunch time expecting 4-5 star rated food with beautiful presentation and your own personal waiter.\\n\\nThe two times I went here, I used the online reservation system so I was able to bypass the extremely long line that one would have to wait to get in. It is just like waiting in line for a ride, that's how long the line was, so please reserve early. I'm also going to say, if you have to wait a long time to get in, ask yourself if you really want to see the Beauty and the Beast decor, because if you are not a fan, a lover of it, and you don't care, you might come out saying you wasted your time and you are better off going to Columbia Harbor house to eat.\\n\\nNow the decor is a sight to see. That's the 'Be Our Guest' experience. There's the main dining hall, the library, and the West Wing with the rose in glass dome which is really cool. The rooms each have a lot of detail, look around, look at the ceiling, look at the windows, but watch where you are going so you don't crash into the moving carts going everywhere. After you order and all, grab a table before wandering around touring each of the rooms which I encourage you to do. If you don't grab a table, you will have no place to sit. Be sure to return back to your table as that's how they locate you and know where to deliver the food.\\n\\nThe food is mediocre, nothing to rave about. If you want to come here because you want to try the food and don't care about anything else, I urge you to stop and go elsewhere. I got the braised pork which I think is the best option because it's the most unique out of everything else and I got the roast beef sandwich with fries the second time. The roast beef sandwich is just a flat sandwich, you can make it at home. I think McDonald's fries are better than the fries I got here. My wife got the Tuna Nicoise salad and the braised pork the second time. She did not like the Tuna salad but also liked the braised pork. Again, not a 4-5 star rated dish by any means at all. I did get the Masters Cupcake twice because as everyone else raves, its really that good.\\n\\nI enjoy the environment, the ambiance and the decor of this place...would I wait hrs to get in, absolutely not. I would rather wait hrs for Toy Story Mania at Hollywood Studio and that is stretching it as well. But is this one of the places I would get reservations right away after booking a Disney vacation as early as possible, YES, most definitely."},{"name":"Jiko - The Cooking Place - Temporarily Unavailable","address":"2901 Osceola Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"One word, Amazing!

The next thing I noticed after being seated were the prices. They were very reasonable (especially once I saw the portion sizes). We ordered cocktails first. I had the Berried Alive ($10) which was Bourbon, black berries, lime juice, mint, and awesome. My wife had a Peachy Keen ($8) which had Whiskey Girl Peach, like juice, and ginger beer, served in a copper mug. It was very refreshing and ice cold. For an appetizer we had pork Disco Q fries that you'll see in the picture. $7.95 for a pile of house made waffle fries, a huge lump of perfectly smoked pork, scallions, ranch, and the best 'cue sauce I've had outside the stuff my dad makes. Four people could easily split this, or two who feel like waddling home. Dinner brought us each a BBQ plate. I had more of the perfect pulled pork while my wife went for the half-chicken. Both were great and under $15. They came with two huge side portions and toast. My only complaint for the whole meal was in the slaw. It just tasted weird.

So if you only have one day in Magic Kingdom I might choose to go elsewhere because part of the experience is being able to sit there and breath it all in. The ballroom is the best and you should try to sit there, if not ballroom, the west wing is equally cool, but I'm not a big fan of the other room.\\n\\nBack to my review. The French onion soup was delicious and packed with umami flavors. Cheese was certainly melted but I would have liked more of it to be all charred and crunchy. Lamb was fabulous. Filet was so tender you didn't even have to chew. Desert now comes in a trio of deserts, a raspberry macaron which was my favorite, a white chocolate \\"chip\\" cup filled with the famous \\"grey stuff\\" aka an Oreo Cr√®me mouse, and a dark chocolate grand mariner bon bon.

The servers are authentic African and the executive chef is new(er) and also tries to revamp the menu back to more authentic items. It had become too Americanized for my taste. They also took the Mac and Cheese and chicken nuggets off the menu so kids are encouraged to also try foreign cuisine (yes mom and dad, they WILL love it). The meat is fresh and you can request all kinds of \\"done-ness\\", the soups and salads are outstanding and you should NEVER leave without having tried everything on the desert bar.

I really like this place. This review is going to be a review/rant/owner letter.\\n\\nI've been here 5 times and I've gotten the same thing every time, the Cobb salad. It's really excellent tasting, portioned, and a terrific value. 5 stars for that, no question.\\n\\nThe atmosphere and working spaces are really fantastic. Comfortable, large, clean... I'm into it. 5 stars.\\n\\n---Now the rant...\\n\\nHOWEVER, they've closed early TWICE on me in the last week. Once at 3:00, once at 5:30, when according to their sign outside, they usually close at 7. These times were not posted in advance, so it was clearly a \\"day-of decision\\".\\n\\nMaybe it is just me but this is my pet peeve. I also think not sticking to your hours is the kiss of death for any retail business, especially restaurants and coffee shops (where time reliability is highest - food and workplace). If you're closing early, you've got to be asking yourself why and how you can fix it. The last thing you want to do is bail out though because it leaves SUCH a bad taste in the customer's mouths. I drove 20 minutes to work at your shop and now I have to turn around and go somewhere else? Ouch!\\n\\nThe first time I was told it was because a chef quit. The second time, because it was slow. So now I feel somewhat obligated to call first, to make sure you'll be staying open. And now I'm in a tough place as to how many stars to give this place, because neither are legitimate reasons to close early. A flood in the kitchen, a robbery, a fire - those are legitimate reasons. Even an all out strike shouldn't stop you, unless maybe you're out of town. :)\\n\\nIf you're the owner, here's the question you have to ask... How much more business would you get if you were the beacon of reliability and didn't make your customers call to make sure you're still open? What if I didn't have this issue and I gave you 5 stars and so did everyone else and your rating when up? How much more business would you get from a 4.5 star rating on Yelp. I imagine it makes a considerable difference for most small restaurants to gain half a star on Yelp. You probably wouldn't have that \\"it's slow\\" problem.\\n\\nAnd if \\"it's just the holiday time,\\" maybe you should ask yourself what you could do to bring in more people during this time of year. You still have the same bills, so you can't afford to throw in the towel. It's not like every business is slow during this time. Some have it figured out. Some make winter hours. If you did that, your customers would appreciate it over closing randomly because well, you gave them a heads up. It's the surprise of closing early that hurts you the most. In fact, I should be giving you fewer stars out of principle, but I'm holding back because I like this business a lot and want to see it succeed.\\n\\nBut I'll just say now, that I will deduct one star for each time this happens. It probably won't happen because I'm going to call from now on. But I'm just saying, stop it! :)\\n\\nI gave the lovely counter person a bunch of tips about how you can make more sales from your existing customers, like posting ANYWHERE that you sell beer (perhaps the menu on the wall or the coffee board up top.) Or putting more (and I didn't say this, but also better) items in your hottest sales spot, the display case.

It took 20 minutes to find parking and an hour to be seated so I was hoping it would be worth it.  We had to ask for water, chips, and salsa multiple times.  The most offensive part was after lingering at our table for 15 minutes, the manager came over to ask \\"I was wondering if you might be able to leave the table, we are on a hour wait and we need this table.\\". After we looked at her incredulously, she offered to buy us a round of drinks in the bar if we moved.  Wow!  After spending $150 with 7 people, I would have expected that the manager would have been a little nicer!?!?\\n\\nI will never go back, there are many Mexican food places that have better food and much better service!!!"},{"name":"Henri's","address":"2026 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Let's talk about Henri's after sunset.  \\n\\nLots of plusses:  In the 'hood.  Locally owned.  Good service -- supportive, interested, and available, but not hover-y.  Nice wine selection.  Snacks if you want.  Cozy atmosphere.  Three friends and I split a bottle of wine and some cheese plates, and each of us paid $12, and that included a generous tip!\\n\\nSome challenges:  It's small.  And when small gets busy, it gets LOUD.  Maybe there's room for 25 inside.  And it's obviously still on my mind, but \\"cheese plate\\" is an overstatement, by a mile.  Maybe \\"cheese bits\\" would be more accurate.  $3 or $4 per cheese plate seems like a steal, but then the plates arrive and there are about six cubes of cheese per plate, no joke.  In our group, at least one of us hadn't eaten dinner and was counting on a bit more food volume.  \\n\\nAs it was, every time a hand reached out, we silently counted down the remaining cubes.  If you took one, you were going to make it last.  Nibble each corner slowly, unhurried, measured bites.  We all looked nervously at each other because no one wanted to eat the last cheese cube!  But we wanted to eat the cheese!  \\n\\nCheese quandary!  Cheese crisis!\\n\\nYes, we could have ordered more cheese plates.  But it's funnier that we didn't and now I am writing a review of our eleven cheese cubes for $7.  Ah, come on, Henri's, it's all in good fun.  (And please give us more cheese, even if it means increasing the price per plate.  Please.)"},{"name":"Beulahland","address":"118 NE 28th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"this review is just based on breakfast at beulahland.  i really liked the atmosphere and laid-back attitude of this place- definitely a great spot to lounge around on a sunday and drink coffee with a friend or 2.  the food was kind of blah as far as i could tell. my egg sandwich was dry... i get it that it's not a place that's all about the awesomeness of its egg sandwiches; i just like to get my $4 worth.\\ndefinitely going to check this place out at night sometime - my friend keeps recommending the sunday night video request thing they have here."},{"name":"Louie's Pizza","address":"118 Main St","city":"Woburn","stars":"4.5","text":"Everything about this place sucks except the amazing pizza and the awesome people who run it:)"},{"name":"Juanita's","address":"1043 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"3","text":"craving fish tacos and having already experienced the sublime deliciousness of  illegal pete's, centro and tahona, i thought i'd give juanita's a try.

The place was a little small and it did get crowded because it was super busy, especially during peak hours. We got there at a good time, right before the lines started to form. Efficient service, great prices and good portions as well. One thing - the beef roll. It is to die for. My friend and I ordered one and I guess we were enjoying it so out loudly that our neighbouring tables also ordered the same right after glancing over."},{"name":"Tavern At The Creek","address":"2475 Africa Rd","city":"Galena","stars":"4.5","text":"Was looking for a different Pizza place on Saturday night. Saw the one review and decided to try with my wife and daughter. We decided to try an Italian sub, some wings and a Pepperoni pizza. The sub was fantastic. The bun was excellent and had the addition of cheese melted on top. The wings being smoked were fantastic. We did not want dip them in any sauce. The Pizza had a great crust on it. The sauce was very good and had a very good amount of pepperoni on it. We plan on taking our neighbors the next time we go up there. So glad we decided to stop in and check it out.

The atmosphere is great, the drinks are good, and I really like the selection of BBQ sauces (I'm known to mix the spicy + Coca Cola sauces). The menu is obviously focused on BBQ (chicken, turkey, brisket, pulled pork) but have a few other options for fish or non-BBQ eaters. I really do live their Cola sauce and especially the pork belly appetizer (flash fried with the Cola sauce). \\n\\nIn the end, I gave it 4 stars because I think the meat could be smoked a bit more (there is still a need for a knife in some cases, which is unacceptable for southern BBQ) and because the servers can be quite slow on occasion. I would definitely recommend for an evening when you're looking to catch up with friends and don't have plans after so you don't mind if it is slow.\\n\\nRelative to Buckhead, parking is a breeze. They have a fairly large lot, although I am sure on the weekends it gets pretty crowded."},{"name":"Shing Yee Restaurant","address":"1255 Washington St","city":"Newton","stars":"3.5","text":"Decent food, 1 waitress for the whole restaurant? She was not very good either! She never asked what we wanted to drink, and walked away after we ordered our appetizer. She never came back for our entree order!

I usually go for the pita wrap but this time I wanted to try something new and it was worth it.

I really enjoyed this restaurant.  The drinks were great and the ambiance was fun.  The food was also wonderful.  We tried a bunch of the small plates and also got the Pizzetta to start.  All were excellent.  For an entree I got the dinner size portion of the Agnolotti.  It was sooooooo good! The only complaint that I have about 62 is the portion size of the entrees/apps.  The dinner size of the agnolotti was that of a small plate.   So you'll end up leaving the restaurant still a little hungry.  But besides the portion size you definitely need to try this restaurant.
