At My initial visit the execution of the items we ordered was not as good as the descriptions on the menu sounded.  The fries are delicious, and the burger is good.  The second time I went, I ordered a burger and tried out the one dollar fried chicken special.  The burger was good, the chicken was fine.  The most recent visit was 5:45 pm or so on Saturday after thanksgiving (11/25/11).  We had 6 adults + hi chair needs.  The covered patio was draped in heat containing plastic curtains, but at the entrance there was a giant gaping hole that let cold in.  There were only a few tables taken, and one large one in the back that was near a heater.  We were told that one had a reservation, but then we were offered two tables put together fit next to the gaping open doorway, with gusts of cold wind coming in (it was about 40-45 degrees).  When we waffled at that suggestion, they told us we should just come back when it was warmer.  Seriously?  That was your best attempt at getting us a satisfactory seating arrangement?  It seemed very much like two birds in the bush were better than one in the hand to them. Maybe we were not hip enough?  We left, went to opal divines and spent over $100 on dinner and drinks.

The tropical happiness seasoning in the noodle dish reminded me most of Indian cuisine, but with a bit of a Polynesian spin, still different enough to tell it apart.\\n\\nThe second visit involved a to-go order of two giant samosas and the pan fried noodles except with mushrooms and lentil fritters. The samosas were a meal in itself, like a size of a burrito. The exterior was easy to cut yet still firm, and the potato filling was amplified with the chutney at hand. The noodles were yet again excellent, with the mushrooms and fritters adding a nice textural difference to the overall dish.\\n\\nMy only complaint would be that the containers aren't large enough to safely transport the samosas to-go, but it's a pretty mild in comparison to the quality and friendliness this place offers.

She located Contigo boasting the \\"best hamburgers in Austin\\".  Within 2 minutes Siri triumphs with directions and 4 stars on yelp!  My mom and I had to try the hamburgers, and I believe my sister had a sausage sandwich.  So she had one half of my hamburger and I had 1/2 of her sandwich. Contigo is definitely not a fast food, in and out hamburger joint.  At 1st I had sticker shock looking at the menu.  $10-11 for a hamburger, I sat scratching my head?  The waitress guaranteed it would be really good and it is served on Challah bread.  Challah bread is a traditional braided egg-bread of my Jewish ancestors so I had to try it.  We also split a kale salad with a sweet tasting vinaigrette.  The salad was delicious, and we ate it as if we had not eaten in a week.  I have to say being used in Texas sized everything, when the hamburger came it appeared to be on the small, but thick-side.  In my humble opinion, the menu is designed as small plates, meant to be shared so you can try a variety of things.  And if you get there for happy hour - there are several options to taste and at least half of the price of regular menu items.  But I digress.  \\nAs it turns out, the restaurant procures their meats from several local, small farms and butchers/creates all of their own sausages, hamburgers, sliders or whatever is on the menu, fresh that day.  One bite into the hamburger I was hooked!  The condiments were on the side unless you order cheese and bacon.  I wanted to taste the meat on its own with the freshly made bread.  It was the 1st hamburger that had a taste of its own, needing no ketchup, or mustard or mayonnaise!  It was juicy and delicious.  The atmosphere is friendly, but loud.  It is definitely a 20 to 30 something hang out, but hey the 40-60 somethings fit right in.  I went back one time since then and I made a mistake of ordering a cheeseburger.  The hamburger is good by itself, but this time I tried putting the tomato and onion on too.  \\nThe 1st visit for 3 people, 3 entr√©es, one beer, wine and soda with the tip was $44.  The next visit for 2 people several happy hour appetizers, several drinks, and two entr√©es with the tip was $60.  Was it the best hamburger I've ever had?  The answer is no.  But it is definitely up there and worth a visit.  For my Mom from San Francisco this was considered a cheap dinner.  For Austinites, I would say it's moderate to high if all you're going to have is just beer and a burger. This is fresh, European style meats and real people portions great for sharing.  I did not leave hungry at all either time.  If I wanted a plate of food that could feed a small nation for $5-$7, there are hundreds Of Austin Restaurants in that genre.

They offer simple fare- nothing posh like other late night dining options around Kenmore, no flame torched ahi rosettes or kobe beef tartare or baked fois gras tartinettes- but simple fare done right.  The onion rings aren't as good as I had hoped, but the chicken fingers were excellent (for chicken fingers) and came with the best honey mustard sauce I've ever had.  Other things I didn't order but saw come out of the kitchen were the bacon-wrapped scallops and potato skins- which look like what I'll be having next time.\\n\\nAlso impressive was the selection of alcoholic coffee drinks available in addition to Irish coffee.  I had a Mexican coffee- coffee and Kahlua- which was done such that I could taste the alcohol but wasn't overpowered by it- an overall soothing, late night drink.  Haven't just tried a beer there yet and didn't sit at the bar, which looked like it contained some neighborhood regulars, and while the ambiance certainly wasn't posh or nouveau, the joint is obviously well kept, nicely lit, quaint and cozy.\\n\\nThey also offer live music which wasn't going on when I went, but I've passed by it many a time when the music is going on and from what I can hear it sounds like a fun evening- usually involves acoustic base from what I can see through the window.

That said I have no issue with Vegans. I am a vegetarian and have thoroughly enjoyed vegan baked goods from Whole Foods and New Seasons. \\n\\nI ordered a small chai latte made with almond milk and two bakery items. After asking for specific suggestions from the employee at the front desk I was directed to the weekend special donuts, chocolate glazed and filled with some kind of chocolate cream and a coffee cake to eat the following day. I was completely disappointed with the chai as it was watery and the largest flavor hit I detected came from the the cinnamon and nutmeg sprinkle on top not the chai itself. I'll admit ordering it with almond milk contributed to its watery consistency but it should have had no affect on the over all flavor. \\n\\nThe weekend special donut does not present well. It looks like a lump of you know what with icing on top. The glazing itself was very sweet as was the filling inside however it was downhill from there. First of all calling this thing a doughnut is stretching the definition quite broadly. It has none of the lightness nor any of the fried, rich decadence and fluffiness that one expects to experience when ordering a bakery item called a \\"doughnut\\". This thing is as dense as a hockey puck. The overall flavor of the actual \\"doughnut\\" was surprisingly bland except for the sour notes that kept hitting my tongue from what I can only assume were burnt sections or overcooked parts of the pastry.  I did eat the entire \\"doughnut\\" but only because it was ridiculously overpriced and I'm a chocolate fanatic so even if it's bad letting chocolate go to waste is sin in my book. \\n\\nThe only reason that I'm writing this review right now is because I'm currently trying to enjoy the granular coffee cake and it is currently affecting my ability to enjoy my morning coffee. On a positive note the flavors are wonderful, nutty richness, cinnamon, nutmeg, all of the classic coffee cake seasoning one expects when ordering a pastry item most Portlanders are pretty passionate about given our rabid consumption of its namesake beverage paring but that's it. Admittedly the flavors are good and unlike the lumpy, deformed \\"doughnut\\" there is nothing sour or over-baked here. It just has a very off putting grittiness. The mouth feel (I feel ridiculous even writing that word) is that of slightly moist sand. \\n\\nVegan baking does not have to be ugly, dense or dry! I have experienced the exact opposite many times. And I expected to find that the items at Petunia's would be heavenly and lift vegan baking up to an exalted status. Thus far they have failed to deliver. Perhaps my expectations were a bit high? Who knows? I will try at least one more time as I was told the salted caramel something or other is their signature item and they were simply out of it. And they also have a chocolate cupcake with pink frosting that has glittery sprinkles on top. This is something that has to be tried if for no other reason because it's a freaking cupcake with glitter on it.\\n\\nThe location is bright and fun and the service was competent and delivered with a warm smile. It's disappointing that the pastry items don't deliver as much goodwill as the employees smile did."},{"name":"Lupo","address":"869 Hamilton Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"My dad loves this place so he took my fiance and I there for dinner last night. My dad goes there quite regularly to just have coffee with the owner, who is Argentinean (as are we), so after hearing so much about the great food I was excited to get a chance to try it out.\\n\\nThe restaurant is in a heritage home on Hamilton street. When you walk up the steps to the door it's quite unassuming - you might even miss it if you weren't looking for it. But the inside has a warm, welcoming threshold, where we were greeted by an energetic and friendly host. \\n\\nThe decor is clean. Despite it being in a converted house, there's nothing homely about it. Some restaurants play up the heritage aspect with antiques and opulence - Lupo makes it clear that it's focus is the food, and rightly so.\\n\\nAs a special little treat the chef sent us some empanadas to start (an Argentinean pastry - I have yet to meet an Argentinean that didn't like empanadas), while we perused the menu. The specials of the day sounded delicious but we all ordered from the menu in the end, with the exception of our starter, the burata salad that was a medley of tomatoes, beets, and greens with a generous portion of the burata cheese. \\n\\nMy dad had the sablefish, which he tells me is his 'go-to', my fiance had the tenderloin, and I had the home made ravioli (since I can appreciate that they're quite labour intensive to make).\\n\\nWhen our meals arrived they were plated absolutely beautifully.I wish I could plate dishes like that.\\n\\nWe're a sharing family so everyone had a bit of everyone else's plate. I got to try the sablefish and was blown away by the delicate melange of flavours it had. Our server had explained that it gets marinated in an amazing combination (that I don't entirely remember, but recall it had orange juice) for more than 12 hours. My fiance's tenderloin was cooked perfectly to medium rare, and it was a great cut with no gristle in the center. I loved the potato pave, which is a fancy version of scalloped potatoes.\\n\\nMy ravioli was in a rich, creamy sauce. It was delicious, though I definitely was envious of the other two dishes, more for the variety than flavour. Pasta isn't really a dish that lends itself to sides and accompaniments the way a meat protein dish does so I certainly wasn't expecting it - especially given that my pasta dish would be considered a second course, not a main (in Italy there are usually 4 courses - an appetizer, a pasta, a meat and then a dessert).\\n\\nFor dessert all three of us shared one of the specials - which I can't remember the name of but it was like a creme brulee of chocolate and espresso with some fresh berries and coulis.\\n\\nThe ambiance was semi-formal and there was soft jazz playing in the background. I think this would be a wonderful place for a date - especially where we were seated, cozy by the window. It's definitely a 'treat' for us as it's billed as an upscale (and thus pricey) place, but certainly worth the investment for a special occasion like a birthday or anniversary. \\n\\nWe're thinking we might do our rehearsal dinner here for our wedding since they have an upstairs area that lends itself perfectly for a private function."},{"name":"The Peached Tortilla","address":"","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This place was incredibly delicious.

I went to Japan and compared the sushi from town to town, and I learned how sushi is supposed to be prepared... the whole nine yards.\\n\\nI'll start by saying the sushi was tasty and had unique flavor combinations. I've learned to accept that here in Austin, no food is \\"authentic\\".  It's always got to have some fusion element, some Austin or Texas flare to it. My roll had cilantro ponzu dipping sauce, which was quite delicious!\\n\\nThe individual nigiri is overpriced, as is the case with most sushi places around here, so I only order it if I'm with friends where we can share a boat or a large combination dinner. \\n\\nAfter watching them make the nigiri as I ate my rolls, I realized I had made the right decision. Two of the four chefs seemed to embrace the honor of being a sushi chef. One of them was asian. A third was talented at making rolls, but gave me the impression he would cut corners and substitute fish if he needed to. (They assumed I didn't understand Spanish, which I do.) The 4th chef was by far the least-talented of the group, and he also seemed to give less of a crap about the quality of what he was making than the rest. He fumbled with the nigiri multiple times, a few of which he threw the rice out and started over.  When he was done making a roll, before he cut it, he cut off the fish & veggies sticking out the end... aka the best part! What?! He was also very slow.  Then I saw him telling one of the very talented chefs what to clean up and when to do it, and I had a harsh realization: he's in charge of the line. (The boss is an asian guy who stays in the back, but this guys was in charge of the line.)\\n\\nI looked around and noticed a lot of sushi no-nos, such as pre-cutting your fish (it oxidizes more quickly), leaving the fish exposed to air for long periods of time (it oxidizes and gets that bad \\"fishy\\" smell and taste), and several other things that are nit-picky. \\n\\nOh, also the green tea was not real Japanese green tea, which is not expensive for a restaurant to get. That's kind of a pet peeve, especially for $3 or $4/pot.\\n\\nAnyway, quality was decent, but not for $35.

I have no idea why, and I don't ask for the secret formula because I just want to know where they are so I can get them when I need a fix.  and this is definitely going on the list of places with the 'best tips'\\n\\nUnlike Marc S, I didn't get the vibe that I could easily hang here with any of my more high maintenance friends who only drink mojitos, jofitos, and colitos - generally sh*t in stemmed glasses - so while they might mix a good one here, I usually associate those drinkers with places like Orleans or Temple Bar.  This place ain't that.\\n\\nit's just a quintessential Boston sports pub - and for that, it gets good marks.  definitely a good choice if you are in the hood."},{"name":"Lupo","address":"869 Hamilton Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"The food here is great!

It's our first dateaversary so we were willing to face the weather in order to get the waived corkage fee and hopefully some gourmet eats.\\n\\nIt was unsurprisingly quiet in the restaurant so we were seated immediately.  When our server came up, she asked about getting us some wine but we knew the drill (if you don't, you get to pick your own bottle and it's fantastic). After she explained how the layout of the wine racks worked, my boyfriend quickly asked about making vegetarian versions of any of the items on the menu. The Wine Bistro is decidedly NOT veg friendly, but the Clintonville location had enthusiastically worked with us before to get something amazing from their menu choices.  The server simply said, \\"Hmmm. No.\\" I was floored. She was so curt about it. \\n\\nAfter a few minutes of considering it, we decided we'd just leave rather than ordering the only option on the menu that would work, which we didn't really want. So we went back out into the snow and frantically tried to find another place nearby. The weather was just too awful to justify driving around for a place so, eventually, we just went home.  We're now cooking our dateaversary dinner at home.  I had planned this two weeks ago and didn't dream that we'd be essentially told that the idea of not putting meat in something was unthinkable. \\n\\nWe'll probably go back to the Clintonville location and I hope the owners do consider adding another vegetarian option or two to the menu, but Lane ave Wine Bistro will not see our faces again."},{"name":"Gourmet on the Go","address":"","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Very disappointed.

Hops N Scotch aspires to be the Russell House Tavern of Coolidge Corner, and if they make a few changes here and there, I feel they will definitely fulfill that much wanted and needed niche. The bar offers a good selection of beers and scotches. However if you're a scotch connoisseur, the menu may not impress you that much. Their scotch offerings seem to be for people who don't drink beer but want a good drink to sip on while the rest of their party drinks a wine or a beer. Although I didn't have a glass of wine, I did notice that their wine offerings are pretty generous and it's only $9 for a glass of house wine. \\n\\nI was quite satisfied by their beer offerings but I did notice that their beer glasses were often hot which could quickly warm a beer that should be ice cold. Also their tap beer seems a bit warm. I would recommend the owners to get a few more beer glasses so that they can freeze the beer glasses before offering it to the customers. \\n\\nWe got the scotch eggs and po boys. The scotch eggs were definitely unique and offered a lot of favor. The po boys were good and you got your money's worth. I would recommend the kitchen toasting the bread a little bit so that it looks more appealing on the plate. \\n\\nThe service was excellent. We were blessed to have Diana as our server and she reminded me of a happy fairy that danced around our table as we had our dinner and drinks. She was super friendly and open to hearing any suggestions that we had for the restaurant. \\n\\nThe ambiance was nice. I noticed that a lot of girls were dressed up to come here and that most of the guys were dressed in a nice polo and jeans. The place seems to accommodate people that are just wanting a chill place to grab a drink but it can also be a place to bring a nice date. \\n\\nWhat I'm most impressed about is how open the management and wait staff were to suggestions on how to improve the restaurant. I got the impression that they still had a few things to learn about the restaurant trade and that they're doing the best they can to serve their customers' needs.

Just excellent. They're not big - not fast food sized - and they're in soft corn tortillas (like 2-3 probably because the juiciness busts through the tortillas) but they're really good and the meal is filling.

As such, I will do the same here. My girlfriend and I got the all meat sampler, and a Lamb dish on the side with mangoes, onions and peppers. It came out on the squishy bread tray and included lamb, chicken, beef, a lentil dish, seasoned carrots, and a grain-like dish in the middle, along with the pancakes you use (instead of utensils) to gather the food with. Each dish was deliciously seasoned, as the smell we experienced first entering the restaurant correctly predicted, and extremely unique. \\n\\nSince many of the foods (and Ethiopian dishes in general) featured on the meat sampler were stew-like, I incorrectly assumed they would all taste similar and bland. This was definitely not the case. I had thought each dish would be similar instruments playing a single note. What we received was a symphony of flavors, with each little herbed accent as exciting and fresh as the next. This was my first experience with Ethiopian cuisine, yet it was still enough to place it in my top 5 ethnic food groups, behind Thai, Indian, Mexican, and Middle Eastern.\\n\\nIn terms of the peripherals and non-food related issues, we experienced average to below average service across the board. The waiters, as others have mentioned, gave off a very strange stand-offish vibe. While this may be cultural in nature, I still found it distracting. The owners came up to us during our meal and playfully joked with us through the duration of it. The costs of the meal were a bit higher than I am used to at a restaurant of this quality. \\n\\nAdditionally, the waitress told us multiple times (upon our asking), that the all meat combination/sampler would not be enough to feed two people. This was DEFINITELY not the case, as there was plenty of food for both of us, even disregarding the other small dish we had ordered. As such, I spent far more than I was comfortable spending and didn't get to sample any of the Ethiopian beverages or desserts offered.\\n\\nThey've got a few wrinkles to iron out at Ras Kassa's, mainly service, menu, and price related.

There were crumbs & Syrup all over the table. Once cleaned they never gave us silverware until after our meal arrived; and I still had to ask.  Coffee arrived minutes later. It was good and strong but each of us was only given 1/2 a cup, like they were on rations that day. We all ordered our meals. One of our diners was assured that the French Toast was a huge portion comprised of two thick slices of Bread; however they were not that big at all. For $7.50 it was NOT worth it.  One of our diners ordered the Benedict platter and enjoyed it; which is the only reason the review recieved 2 stars. I ordered the steak & eggs with the request of Medium Rare; it arrived Medium well! They offered to cook a new steak, but everyone was done with the meal by the time it arrived.

Hubby ordered a veal Milanese dish that was pretty good, but the order that stood out was the La Famiglia Especial that I had ordered.  It was the most HUGE platter of food I have ever seen in my life!  Veal and five pieces of chicken breast were over tortellini in a mushroom, onion, pesto sauce that was to die for.\\n\\nThe more I ate, the more I realized it didn't even seem to make a dent in it.  So we packaged both leftovers and while we were able to finish the veal for breakfast the next day, the Especial lasted for breakfast, lunch, and early dinner.\\n\\nAfterwards we asked the hostess about white boxes w/ tie strings that said Mike's Pastry that everyone seemed to be carrying around, and she recommended Mike's or Modern for cannoli's.  Unfortunately, we were too stuffed to even consider it.\\n\\nIf we ever get back to Boston again, we would like to order the mussels appetizer that looked delicious at a neighboring table with an entree rather than two sizable dinner plates."},{"name":"Life of Pie Pizza","address":"3632 N Williams Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow was this pizza incredibly delicious!

When we first walked in, there was a dead mouse, tiny and curled on it's back with its feet in claws, lying in the middle of the floor. When we pointed it out to the proprietors, they were appalled and immediately dispatched someone to take it out in a dustpan. Needless to say, we were a bit discomfited, but too hungry to leave. Also, the servers and staff seemed just as appalled as us, exclaiming that they had JUST had the place completely cleaned.\\n\\nWe ended up sitting outside on their sunny patio where visions of the dead mouse dispersed as we contemplated brunch. I ordered the green eggs-n-ham without feta. Basically, it was a scramble of eggs, avocado and spinach (the \\"green\\") and ham. It also came accompanied with a side of buttered wheat toast and delectable grilled and seasoned breakfast potatoes sprinkled liberally with seasonings and shredded cheese. Mmmmm, so yummy.

She had never been; I suggested it because the pizza I'd gotten there before had been really good.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, the staff proceeded to botch our order to a degree normally found only in bad 1970s sitcoms.\\n\\nFirst, I ordered the $5.50 special slice of the day: Stromboli pizza. I had no idea what Stromboli pizza might be, but it sounded fine to me. With my bottle of beer, the total somehow came up to nearly $16. I explained to the counter girl that I was simply getting a $5.50 slice and a bottle of beer, and she acted like she had never heard of the special (though it was in huge letters at the counter). It took her and at least one other employee a few minutes of playing with the cash register to get my charge to around the correct ballpark (though I think it was still a little over).\\n\\nMy date ordered a spinach salad with tomatoes. After a few minutes, they brought her a house salad. It looked good, but it wasn't what she ordered. So she went back to the counter, told them, then sat back down to wait for her spinach salad. When it came, it didn't have tomatoes. So she had to get up again to get tomatoes.\\n\\nThen came the garlic bread. It didn't look great, but I was waiting for my slice of pizza, so I was hungry enough to try some. The tomato sauce (not very good to begin with) was cold. I don't mean room temperature. I mean COLD.\\n\\nSo this time I had to get up and ask them to nuke it for a while.\\n\\nAt this point, another employee tries to hand me a spinach salad. Apparently they had made another one. I said we didn't need it, but that I was still waiting for my pizza.\\n\\nFinally a guy brings out my Stromboli pizza, which wasn't a slice of pizza at all. What I was given was, essentially, no different from those Hot Pockets you get in the store. And it was burned, to boot.\\n\\nUnderstand, I had just come here from across town because I REALLY wanted pizza.\\n\\nWe left full, but not the least bit satisfied. \\n\\nI'm still going to give Southside three stars, because the one other time I've been there (when my friend and I got actual pizza), it was very good.

I got here at about 11:15 on Friday.  I waited in line for about 35 minutes, but they had free beer, Coors light on draft, so that made the wait easier to stomach.  They sell their bbq by weight.  I had no clue how to order it that way, but when I got up there I said can I get some brisket and turkey and I think I ended up with about 1/2 lb of each.  OMG!  So yummy!  The brisket was really good, but let me tell you that turkey was something special.  Literally, the best turkey I've ever eaten.  I couldn't finish it all.

(Wow, it looks like everyone else has the same review.) So maybe I should give a note about the service. We were tucked into a corner of the restaurant, and didn't even get a server for about 15 minutes. We considered leaving. But he came by more regularly as the night went on. The wait for the main course was about 25-30 minutes. It seemed a bit long, but I've had much longer waits before. In the end, the service was \\"subpar\\" as Sean M. mentions, but not \\"awful\\" as Alexandra suggests.\\n\\n(India Pavilion, if you read this - please listen to all of us!)\\n\\nAnyway, I came here because when I was in Cambridge in college, this was the best of the many Central Square Indian restaurants, and I was not disappointed. From the delicately spicy sambaar to start, to the excellent, richly flavored chicken jalfrazee, to the different and satisfying lamb dal masala, every part of my meat thaali (sampler) was on point. My girlfriend had the chicken mango, and that is some wonderful sauce. Even if it's not traditional, it blends the mango into traditional, more tomatoey flavors into something great.\\n\\nMy seat offered the perfect vantage of the nonstop bread and pastry (samosa) making station, so I saw as my paratha was kneaded and prepared and then delivered hot and fresh. Every bread or stuffed dish you order is made right then! So maybe the wait isn't so bad. The gulab jamun were the standard dense but fluffy variety, I can almost never complain about those.\\n\\nSo all in all, the ONLY THING holding you back from five stars is the service. I think that's fixable.

We came here on a busy Saturday night. We had to wait a long time to be seated even though there were 3 empty tables in the restaurant. The lineup at the door was getting long and people behind me were complaining that it was taking too long to get seated as well. They didn't have a waiting list system; it's either by memory of who they noticed walked in first or they just ask everyone when they have time. \\n\\nWhen we finally got seated, the server brought us water right away but we didn't get the menus until 8 minutes later (they just pointed at an empty table we were supposed to sit down at, and didn't walk with us to the table so that's why we didn't get our menus right away). From hot chocolates to waffles and fondue, they have many options on their unique menu. I have to say that I was very impressed by this since not a lot of dessert places can offer this many options. The servers were bilingual (English and French), and were knowledgable about the food in the menu. It took another 15 minutes for them to come over to take our order. \\n\\nFood came fast and was very delicious! The quality is there and matches the prices that they charge. If you are a chocolate lover you will definitely love the desserts here. We got the 53.8% Belgian ($9.75), which the description of the drink was exactly what I expected. The way you drink it is different and it was an interesting/fun experience. We also ordered the black and white waffle ($13.75) which was tasty and great in size since we both got full from sharing this dish. The waffles that we chose for this (I can't remember the name) were soft and tasted different (the batter) from what I am normally used to, but in a good way! \\n\\nService is terrible! I understand when a restaurant is busy, but there is a big difference between being busy and terrible service. There were only 2 servers so yes they were understaffed but I have not once seen them look around the restaurant to see if anybody needed something. Basically, they only help you when they walk by your table, and that is only if you try to get their attention. I asked for my bill 3 times tonight, and none of the servers remembered after each time I asked. We waited almost 15 minutes (OMG!!!) to get our bill and that is because during the third time I asked, I actually sounded angry when I told them that my parking meter was done (it really wasn't). He apologized and grabbed our bill and the card machine immediately (Thank God!!!) and it didn't even take more than 5 seconds. Needless to say, they got the tips that they deserved. Don't get me wrong, the servers were not rude in any way, and the food really was delicious, but the slow service was extremely unbearable for me. The awareness and attention to customers were very disappointing. I will give this place a try a couple months later. Hopefully they can improve their service soon because it would be a shame to have bad reviews on that when their food actually tastes good."},{"name":"Hanabi","address":"2525 W Anderson Ln, Ste 120","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Prettiest and most delicious ramen in town!

They also offered some mini blueberry muffins for free too! And they were delicious.\\n\\nWe finally got seated probably after a 30-45 minute wait. So basically how you order is that you choose one drink option, a savory dish, and a sweet dish. Its $22 per person and you can also add their extra stuff too for more. I thought that deal was pretty worth it. So I ordered an orange juice and my friend got their caramel hot chocolate with toasted milk marshmallows and his came in a cute reindeer mug! My friend and I ordered the same savory dish which was the baked egg surprise with asparagus and crispy tater hash, mushroom, onion, basil and truffled hollandaise. It was sooo good! The egg was on the bottom of everything and it was definitely a surprise because we didn't notice it right away. It was really delicious and a good combo of everything together.

You love good food.\\n2. You love good artisanal cocktails and freshly brewed beer on tap.\\n3. You like the out of doors more than sitting in a hermetically sealed climate controlled room.\\n4. You have a dog that likes one of the three things above.\\n5. You have children who are capable of staying within arm's length of an adult.\\n\\nThe scoring guide:\\nFour points or more.  You are a Contigre.  You have what it takes to have an awesome time at Contigo Austin, and have probably already been.  You are probably why the hostess told me that the wait would be over an hour for a table a couple of Fridays ago when the weather was gorgeous.\\nThree points.  Give Contigo a try.  You will probably find things you really, really like, but you might find it doesn't suit you in other ways.  If it's the lack of Bud Light that kept you from saying yes to number 2, for example, then Contigo may not be for you.\\nTwo points.  Having children and a dog is not enough to go try Contigo.  Love of food and cocktails might be enough in and of themselves, but the Contigo vibe is pretty definite, and you may or may not find it to be your place.\\nOne point or less.  What the heck are you even doing reading a Yelp review?  Did you stumble across this while looking for nail salon or car repair ratings?\\n\\nThe answer guide:\\n1. If you love good food, then Contigo's kitchen will probably satisfy you as much as it did me.  I have been amazed by the contradictory views of Contigo food here on Yelp, so for what it's worth, here are my favorites.  I don't think of myself as being an adventurous diner, but two of my favorite items on the menu were the ox tongue sliders, which looked and tasted a lot like brisket, and the baby octopus, which transported me to the south of France or the Italian Mediterranean coast (not that I've actually been.)   The white bean dip and the crispy green beans are less risky crowd pleasers as well.  The campagna pate was good and so were the savory rabbit and dumplings (I'm getting more adventurous all the time obviously).\\nThe only item that didn't grab me was the chicken & apple sausage on baguette.  It was just a little too ordinary.\\nThe desserts are also a must, with their mint chocolate chip ice cream redefining the category of mint chocolate chip.\\n2. Twelve beers on tap, and none that start with Bud.  If you must have a mass American lager, they do offer Coors, Miller and their light versions as well.  The only cocktail I've tried is an old-fashioned, which was well executed.  The house specialty is a tangerine tequila drink, and the Moscow Mule gets strong marks all around.  I don't know if the bartenders have time to go off menu for other specialty cocktails, but the cocktail list they offer should have something to please just about everyone except dedicated gin drinkers (of which I am definitively not.)\\n3. Almost all of Contigo's seating is outside, with some of it out under strings of bare bulbs and some in a covered patio with ceiling fans.  This is definitely alfresco dining, and is a big part of the Contigo appeal as far as I'm concerned.  There is a washers court along the side of the restaurant for you to play a game of washers while you enjoy your Moscow Mule and/or wait for a seat at a table.  You can give yourself a bonus point on the quiz if you enjoy playing washers.\\n4. The dog lovers found Contigo right away.  The outdoor seating makes this among the most friendly dog restaurants in Austin.  If you aren't a dog person, don't let this discourage you, as the dogs that have been there when I was there have been completely unobtrusive.\\n5. Parents have also found Contigo right away.  And this is where it gets a little more tricky.  Dogs are used to being on a leash.  Someone else's \\"adorable\\" five-year old isn't.  Folks who know how to control their little ones frankly make the scene nicer for everyone.  I like a multi-generational scene.  But kids running around a restaurant are still kids running around a restaurant.  The staff of Contigo deals with this quite tactfully by greeting patrons with little children with some comment about children being kept at arms-length.  That suits me, and oughta suit people with or without kids.\\n\\nContigo has staked out some unique territory, and it is territory that I really like.  Take the quiz and if you score a three or four, give it a try.  If you score a five, you've probably already been."},{"name":"Veggie Galaxy","address":"450 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I feel like I don't even need to review this place.

We waited an extended time for a our food and the server apologized for the delay.  Once we received our food, both of our meals were only moderately warm (certainly not piping hot, as I expected since we waited so long).

We ordered the peach pie to share and again we waited entirely too long for the pie.  Once it arrived, it also was only luke warm... much like our meal.

It was totally overwhelmed by the thick sliced, hard as a rock, charred pork belly and the oversized and overly bitter house biscuit bun. Ruining bacon is a sin. I ate less than half my five dollar burger. I thought the whole point of Burger Week was to show how great you burgers were so people would come back when they were full priced.

The salmon was also cooked perfectly though, the sauce ratio was off (I am a sauce girl). You get a lot of rice with a nice big piece of salmon,  however there is not enough sauce so you end up eating dry, plain white rice. \\n\\nOn to dessert.  We went with the rustic key lime pie and the triple chocolate pot de creme.  The key lime pie was very tart and I loved it.

I enjoy spicy food and the menu said it'd be spicy but it wasn't, that was a little disappointing. All dinner items come with white rice and to add on fried rice it only costs an additional $1.50\\nWhat I do appreciate about their fried rice is that they do not use soy sauce so that tremendously reduces the amount of sodium.\\nThe vegetable roll was great and very large. I ordered some sake at the bar while I was waiting and it actually came to less than the menu price on my bill so that was pretty cool."},{"name":"Made In Puerto Rico","address":"13605 S Apopka Vineland Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"Beautiful decorations and excellent service.

No I'm sorry you don't like it, no would you like something else, no whats the problem, just walked away without a word.

It's still not my favorite place to eat, but it's adequate if you order properly.\\n\\nThe breakfast menu is really the way to go here-- the omelets are good, the eggs benedict is pretty tasty, and the pancakes are, well... pancakes. Hard to screw up. You can get the pancakes with chocolate and walnuts, with a banana puree, and they're practically good enough to justify the price.\\n\\nAs for entrees, I've tried a variety now. The Mac n' Cheese isn't very good, sadly-- when I tasted mine it was so non-cheesy that I thought they'd given me the vegan version by mistake. The grilled cheese sandwich is fine, if a bit greasy, and they have daily special varieties that make things interesting. My favorite thing is actually the seitan pastrami Rachel sandwich-- the salty smokiness of the pastrami flavoring overcomes the natural blandness of seitan, and the texture isn't too much of a problem when sliced thin. The seitan BLT is similarly not bad (not as good as the pastrami), and comes with a nice roasted tomato instead of fresh, which adds flavor. So I can generally make a decent meal here, though I still end up feeling kind of heavy from all the grease.\\n\\nDesserts are still not particularly good. The chocolate pudding is fine, but I ordered a chocolate/butterscotch pudding parfait once and the butterscotch was sour enough that if it had been non-vegan I'd have assumed it was made with sour milk. It was so bad that I scraped it off the chocolate layers and actually asked the server to make sure it wasn't spoiled. My daughter loves the vegan PB and chocolate cake, but in my opinion the cake is dry and the frosting is uninspiring. Stiff and oily, probably due to whatever coconut oil or shortening they're using instead of butter."},{"name":"Blasi's Cafe","address":"762 Adams St","city":"Dorchester","stars":"4","text":"Rainy day here.

Their staff is super knowledgeable and friendly and everything came out promptly and just how we ordered.\\n\\nSpeaking of ordering, we started with the charcuterie and cheese board and the truffled deviled eggs and loved every bite.  The board had duck ham, chicken liver mousse (OMG), pork rillette (DELISH), pastrami salmon, country-style pate (YUM), a couple of cheeses, and some sauces/condiments to match.  Everything was very good and honestly, I could have made my entire meal out of the chicken liver mousse - amazing.\\n\\nOne of my friends never strays from the beef shoulder with the 110-degree poached egg and after tasting it, I can see why.  It's the most tender, flavorful meat topped with the silkiest egg you'll get in your face.  Next time, that's what I'll be getting!\\n\\nMy other friend had the crisp chicken thighs and they were incredible,  Chicken is such a hit-or-miss dish at a lot of places but Salty Sow nailed it.  That gravy was plate-licking worthy.\\n\\nI had the duck breast and although I'm not a fan of cardamon (or, maybe I just *thought* I wasn't, ha!), every bite was heaven.

The veggies are fresh, there are other salad options (i.e. potato salad, broccoli salad, chicken salad, etc) and there are ample toppings and dressings.  My side of smoked turkey was perfect...just the right amount and the taste was exactly what I expected. The price was a little high for lunch (around $12 with tax), but it IS an all-you-can-eat salad bar.  If you forgo the side of meat, I believe the price is around $9.\\n\\nOur server was great.

We were told that would be fine, but after waiting we mentioned that we were ready to put in a to go order to which we were told \\"you have to wait until 5\\"....it was 4:58. I remember vividly because of how asinine this response was, but fine. 2 minutes go by and now we're told \\"oh you can't order from the counter you had to put your name on the list sit at a booth and then order from there for a to-go\\". You've got to be kidding that doesn't make sense, but whatever we told them to add us to the list. At this point people starting coming in to dine in and they all were getting sat despite the fact that we'd now been hanging out waiting, and we were getting increasingly frustrated. We're both in the service industry so we're easy but we had to twist their arms just to be able to end this moronic runaround we were getting and finally order our food because they clearly hadn't put us on the list and obviously didn't give a shit. So in all that first experience: TERRIBLE SERVICE but the poutine was great so I decided to give it another go because of the food.\\n\\nThe second time I came in the SERVICE again was MISERABLE. The person taking my order was a total snob throughout the whole ordeal and basically made me feel like I had personally insulted him by just coming in to eat. I asked if they had donuts (I didn't know it was only on weekends I just knew of them from their instagram) his response, in what seems to be the standard for VG's customer service, was to scoff and be RUDE and UNPLEASANT. I couldn't eat my food fast enough and get the hell out of there because there wasn't a single staff member that made you feel like being there. This time though the food matched the service it was overly greasy and I left feeling NAUSEOUS and just gross. I really wanted to think it was just an off day.\\n\\nMy visit this week though has been the final nail in the coffin for me. While I will say I had my \\"best\\" customer service experience here I use that term lightly. \\"Best\\" in this instance referring to the fact that when my server did show up he wasn't a complete and total prick BUT it took 10 minutes just for him to show up and an additional 15 minutes to get my drink. The only other time I saw him was when I got my check. Again though the food was just lackluster and heavy leaving me feeling gross and sick to my stomach.\\n\\nThis place has a niche because it offers vegan junk food but since veganism is becoming more prevalent I would say it's just a matter of time until a new spot pops up where the food and the staff don't leave you with a bad taste in your mouth.\\n\\nI really wanted to love you VG but I've never left without being entirely disappointed."},{"name":"Twelve Hours","address":"559 Washington St","city":"Brighton","stars":"4.5","text":"Came here for lunch today with the hubs.

The portions were massive but the quality wasn't amazing.  The \\"chicken strips\\" were creative in that they were the dinner-style fried chicken in breast format and then just cut into strips.  Why, however, they could make that for lunch but couldn't offer up the dinner option at 3:30 on a Wednesday was beyond me.  The french fries with gravy and bacon were interesting but also so rich that even eating just 3 or 4 made my arteries start to harden.  Also, seating was tough.  Lots of parties of 2 and 3 occupying cafeteria tables designed for 6-8.  I'm not suggesting that they would have wanted to sit next to me and my two children but it would have been nice for us to find at least one place to sit where we didn't feel like outcasts because we lacked beards and skinny jeans. \\n\\n7 Stars: The take home pie.  OMG (that's my 10 year old daughter's contribution to the review).  We brought home a full apple and a slice of strawberry rhubarb.  My only regret was not getting a full rhubarb pie as well.

The bacon jam was a little too sweet though. If you were blind folded and told to taste it, you'd have no idea it was pizza. I love pizza so it was a little disheartening.

I've been to Ten Oak a few times over the last couple of years. Once for brunch, which was fine, once for my birthday so I OBVIOUSLY don't remember that, and this most recent time for a friend's birthday this past Saturday. Please allow me to set the stage:\\n\\nMe + my fiance + Fiance's BFF (also Best Man/Birthday Boy) + his GF (also a Bridesmaid in our wedding). We have all been to Ten Oak before. My fiance and his BFF love whisky and bourbon and are quite educated on the subject so needless to say they've been looking forward to this visit as it had been about a year since we were there. It was about 10ish and the place was pretty dead. We walked in and bellied up to the bar. There were a couple of guys at the rail and one HUGE party of chicks in the back, must of have been a bachelorette/birthday or something. The girls were wrapping up so I didn't think much of it. Also a DJ spinning some obnoxious top 40 shit. Excuse me, not spinning - I think he was just hitting next on his laptop.\\n\\nWe sat down and were given the basic cocktail/dinner menu. We had already eaten so I ordered the pop rock tini and my BM ordered a French 75. Both fine but my drink was about 1/2 oz short, just sayin. The boys had to ask for a whisky menu (why you would have to do that at a whisky bar I have no idea) only to be told by our bartender that he wasn't overly fluent in the whisky selections....wha?? Ok, get someone else over that's fine. Meanwhile the girls at the back table are not going quietly into that good night. I can see them across the bar dancing ON THE BAR and receiving shots from the Mgr directly in their mouths?! Gross. I thought I was at a nicer place then Coyote Ugly, apparently not. I asked the bartender that didn't know anything about whisky \\"Hey, is that your owner pouring those shots?\\" 'No, that's our manager (rolling eyes).' Yikes.\\n\\nBottom line - if you're ready to drop some good money on a cocktail or high end whisky DO NOT GO HERE. I'm not sure where you should go instead but we all agreed that this place could be great if it were in a different neighborhood with a different manager!"},{"name":"La Famiglia Giorgio's","address":"112 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Our family of 4 ate here in June. The food was very good, as was the service, and the wine selection and prices were outstanding. The initial appeal, noted by others, is their selection of over 20 sauces for pastas. \\n\\nFood portions are large. The walnut & gorgonzola salad was a bit disappointing - the romaine lettuce was sparse and limp. The warm goat cheese dip was good, though in retrospect, not so different from the sauce I had on my entree. My wife and daughter enjoyed splitting a dish of angel hair with the fresh tomato sauce; their meatballs were huge, but not terribly flavorful. My son enjoyed his angel hair with the carbonara sauce. I enjoyed the frutti di mare. The freshly grated parmesan was a nice accompaniment.\\n\\nThe highlight for me was a bottle of 2006 Allegrini Amarone. Amarone is my favorite wine, and Allegrini is my favorite producer, but I rarely buy it - in a wine shop or at a restaurant - due its high price. At La Famiglia Giorgio's, the Allegrini Amarone was less than retail: $80 (the Wine Bottega, a wine shop a few blocks away, sells the same bottle $82). They have several other Amarone's on the menu, including one for around $50. The waitress decanted it through an aerator + filter - a nice touch - though the wine glasses were rather thick and uninspiring.\\n\\nThe wine helped makeup for what otherwise would be 4-star level food.

We'll return to Dallas soon.\\n\\nWhen I saw Keri B.'s \\"Women Who Wine n Drink---June Edition\\" was to be held at Ten Oak, which she described as a venue with \\"dark wood finish and sexy wall art\\", that \\"specializes in bourbon and whiskey\\", which she considered \\"a more manly diversion\\", I knew I had to invite myself  even though technically I'm not a lady. But I like sexy wall art. I like bourbon. And believe me...I like manly diversions. I asked if I could blend in by wearing a wig. Turns out, it gave her the idea to wear one herself. On the way there, I had to chuckle that I was crashing the ladies' shindig, who in turn were crashing a bar billed for the guys. I am such a double agent.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I forgot to grab a wig, and I didn't think to swing by Charlie's to see if they had any spare wigs lying around backstage, which I'm almost positive they do. When I arrived, Catherine T. was sitting outside on the open patio by a gigantic stone horse head fountain. If it weren't so oppressively hot, the patio is a very appealing spot to sip your whiskey and catch up with friends. Once Keri arrived, we moved inside near the bar where we had a reserved table.\\n\\nSpeaking of the table, it's this massive tree trunk with special reinforced steel and beams to rest your legs. I rarely ever have reason to notice the tables I'm sitting at, but in this case, I thought it deserved a mention. \\n\\nFive Dollar Happy Hour is from 4-7. Half a dozen cocktails and several appetizers are only $5, which I think is a hell of a deal. I began by perusing the extensive bourbon list on their main menu, and decided to have a glass of Angel's Envy neat. I recognized this particular name since right as I was leaving The Brown Bar a couple weeks ago, a rep for the brand was handing out free samples. He explained that through a unique aging process, it comes out extremely smooth, and doesn't have the typical \\"burn\\" if you were to drink it straight. In case you were interested, the website elaborates that \\"The port cask process imbues Angel's Envy with rich and robust aromas, caramelized fruits, chocolates and a smoky undertone.\\" It was excellent then, and it was excellent again at Ten Oak. \\n\\nThe girlier Happy Hour cocktails are delicious as well. I ordered the Executive Washroom, a name that sounds kinda gross but since it's made with gin, St. Germaine Elderflower, strawberry liquor, basil, and hand made orange bitters actually tastes wonderful. I also had sip of and would recommend the Water Cooler (vodka with muddled berries, St. Germaine, blue curacao, with a splash of prosecco). Keri mentioned and Catherine ordered the pop-rock-tini (Bacardi razz rum, bols peach schnapps, cranberry, pineapple. topped with prosecco. and rimmed with pop rocks). Next time I'll give this very unique elixir a whirl.\\n\\nThe Jester king beer braised pulled pork sliders topped with coleslaw were decent. Kelly S. arrived, and she ordered us the roasted chicken pizzetta topped with house-smoked bacon, cheddar cheese and jalape√±o and served with bourbon barbeque sauce. It was spicy, but tasty (and only $5! Seriously, this is a great deal). We also enjoyed Gulf shrimp corn dogs with mustard, truffle fries, and I noticed more than one order of \\"Figs in a Pig\\", figs stuffed with bleu cheese and bacon wrapped. Thanks Kelly! \\n\\nThroughout the get together, I had this vague sense that something about the place was familiar. I knew it had opened quite recently, but not sure what it replaced. It was then someone mentioned that this used to be Cuba Libre. No wonder. Years ago, Jersey and I were staples at that place. Her, so she could keep an eye on her boyfriend who was a waiter; and me, more so for the rum and Cokes. This is  where I'd run into Johnny Knoxville and also where I went to a completely unbearable Young Democrats function that turned out to be a completely lame \\"getting to know you session\\" with team building exercises. I got tipsy with my friend and left halfway through it. The Ten Oak space is so completely different (especially with the addition of the patio), but I say for the better.  \\n\\nOh, and the best part about all of this? I was brought a wig in case I had forgotten mine. It was blonde, and for a while I became Natalie I., Yelp's newest Woman Who Wines and Drinks. I think I looked fabulous, and the ladies who knew me such as Darla and Yolanda got a kick out of it. The other girls who arrived just as I had put it on probably thought I was either really gay, or a complete lunatic. I think they were relieved to know I was indeed an invited part of the Yelp group, and not some weird creeper guy off the street. \\n\\nTen Oak, at least for an affordable and trendy Happy Hour, went as smooth as that Kentucky bourbon I had.

The only thing that I found to be of any worth was the gravy that they put on my wife's smothered chicken breast.  \\n\\nAfter $50 for three people and an hour wait we left extremely disappointed.

The bread had a good flavor and texture with a very nice flakey crust they made a little crunchy feeling with each. Fresh deli meats and cheeses, and a special note is the way the prep the sandwich. After loaded all your toppings, they use a knife to fold the items around eCh other and tuck them in the fold of the bread. It's a good technique that allows for eating without drippings and making a mess. \\n\\nThey offered a selection of four pepper mixtures, I went with hot and sweet on both and recommend these for the cold sandwich, although good on the hot, for me, the sweet distracted from the hot steak. \\n\\nAtmosphere is very laid back and the staff was friendly and talkative while they prepared the sandwiches."},{"name":"Yard House","address":"888 SW 5th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"A bit pricey, but great quality food and drinks.

I was excited to see many interesting dishes that seemed like Starliner Diner fare on the menu and hoped that it would at least be as good, but LouiE's Grill didn't make the cut.  In a location where the last two or three restaurants have gone under in just a couple months, LouiE's might not last long either unless they pull thing together.  Despite being a slow weekday night with only two or three other parties in the restaurant, our table had rice on it when we arrived, which is not usually the best way to start off a meal.  The service was very slow and at many times there wasn't a staff member in sight to wave over if you needed something.  The food we ate was okay, and my husband liked the ropa vieja, but I thought it was missing something acidic to brighten the taste and tried to wait patiently until we could get some lemon before eating.  The sweet potato fries and plantains were not as good as Starliner, with too little flavour in the sweet potatoes and a somewhat unripe taste to the plantains.  While there is a chance that this is not related to the restaurant's food, my stomach was sour for about the first half of the next day- not an enjoyable experience.  Overall, I thought it was expensive ($25 for a shared appetizer and entree, no drinks) for what we got.  In the end, I'd rather wait for a table at Starliner or go for a different type of food."},{"name":"La Famiglia Giorgio's","address":"112 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Sweet Jebus that's a lot of food.\\n\\nI want to be clear and say right away that this is not on the same level as Panza or Giacomo's. \\n\\nThat being said, this place is very good for the money.

Well I've never said this about a Texas bbq joint, but the ribs are what's best here, even more so than the brisket. This might be entering the nitpicky zone, but I've actually had better brisket in other parts of Texas. The smoke ring is certainly present and well done, but the meat itself is not overly tender. I actually need a knife, which ideally shouldn't be the case. Still enjoyable. The pork ribs however, another story altogether. Super tender, juicy, and jam packed with smokiness. Easily the best ribs I've had to date. \\n\\nIn a short time, La Barbeque has forged a name of its own in Austin.

The szechuan beef was spicy & the thinly cut pieces of beef were tender, so we thought this was a well executed dish too. The shrimp fried rice was very flavorful and was full of nice sized shrimp (which is a must for this dish, IMHO). We also tried the fried dumplings and they were good as well. We will be going back to the Hunan House soon to try some of their different menu items."},{"name":"Twelve Hours","address":"559 Washington St","city":"Brighton","stars":"4.5","text":"Everything about this place is memorable, from the ambience and decorations to the food and plating. Its also easy not to feel guilty about eating here because of how affordable it is. Add all of those factors to some great tasting dishes that are served hot and fresh and its a recipe for a great time.\\n\\nWe came here twice in one week because we liked it so much, especially given their happy hour deals for their opening ($10 for lunch and $15 for dinner). I believe all of their specials start out with a salad on iceberg lettuce with onions, carrots, an amazingly tangy mustard vinaigrette that pairs well with the sweetness of some sliced pineapples. Its quite the unique salad, truly one of a kind and it comes with most of their dishes.\\n\\nFor the main course, on both trips, I ordered the basil fried rice with beef and some wings and egg rolls as an appetizer. Neither of those times was I ever disappointed. One of my pet peeves with eating out is that I want my food to be piping hot. Because they bring your food out to you and the rest of the dining experience is self service, your food is always super hot. Flavor profile for the basil fried rice was excellent, spicy as expected and not heavy on any one particular taste. The egg rolls are filled with some sort of potato and mango mash up and there's a sweet, light dipping sauce to dunk them into. The wings have no flavor but are crispy on the outside and it allows it to soak up all that sweet sauce that's also used for the eggrolls. Portion sizes and the amount of meat you get are extremely generous.\\n\\nI'm pretty sure my wife will be begging to come back here, she probably likes it more than I do. To be quite frank, I don't think I can complain. I'd be more than happy to come back. Everything about this place is awesome.

You grad a plate (it's small) add on fresh veggies that you like such as cabbage, broccoli, carrots, bell peppers, spinach, tofu and fried tofu, water chestnuts, baby corn, and even eggplant! Once you piled or assembled your veggies onto the plate (again the plate is small) you have to take some time to place all the tasty veggies onto this plate some will fall off the plate which is fine, just try to stack them as high as you can to fit on the plate. When you are done being a builder, you add your own meat; chicken, pork, and beef, it will go on the same plate as your veggies so try to pile it on best you can (don't worry it will all be cooked). You then move on to the sauce pit where there are different sauces that you can add to your plate of veggies such as combination sauce, lite soy sauce, garlic, rice vinegar, pineapple juice and sweet sauce. U basically can  add as much soy sauce n garlic as u like just pour it on! They even have a \\"How-to\\" list of different sauces that you can follow along if you want a certain sauce like \\"teriyaki\\" and \\"sweet and sour\\". There are many combinations of sauce you can make. Once you have custom made your dish you pass it to the cook who will cook your food right in front of you! It's pretty cool to see your food being made, and for the cook dicing your food with 1 hand is pretty cool.  The service is good, its only 1 person who serves your drinks, the place is not too busy and since your food is done in front of your eyes you really don't need much else. For dinner you get a bowl of rice, potstickers and flatbread!

I'm fully aware that Applebee's is not The Ritz, but my comments will have nothing to do with atmosphere or the food.  This restaurant is clean, spacious, and the food is good!  Prices are great.  The service and staff are what's bringing this Applebee's down.  My husband and I live in the area and Applebee's was our savior last winter during all the bad snowstorms.  We had a routine of digging out the car and heading over to Applebee's to enjoy the drink specials (how can you go wrong with a $4 house margarita/$3 Coors?) and tasty appetizers- we really had a good thing going for its convenience and price.  Consistent good food, clean, nice atmosphere.  Something must have changed over the course of the year (Staffing?  Management?) because our last 3 experiences have been frustrating.  I'd like to first share the night before Thanksgiving 2015- not a crowded night at Applebee's, plenty of staff on hand, we were quickly seated in the dining room.  After waiting at least 15 minutes for a server to come over to take our drink request, we put in an appetizer and then ordered our entrees to avoid another wait- we thought we were doing the server a favor.  Appetizer came out and my entree immediately followed, drinks brought over, though, we both asked twice for waters and never got them, but oh well.  The kicker is that my husband's entree never made it.  We both watched the server write it down and it never even came.  We waited, we drank, seeing if it would come--nope, just the check.  We weren't charged for it, so that was fine, we moved on and were over it and ready to leave. Because it's a convenient, clean restaurant for a cheap tasty meal, we went back.  Seated in the bar area this time and had the nicest, most attentive server ever.  I wish I could remember her name so I could give her a shotout for doing her job and doing it wonderfully.  Things were fine.  Put our drinks in, got plenty of water, and ordered an appetizer and entrees.  Everything came out fine, except my husband got the wrong entree.  No problem, our server totally made up for it with her awesome customer service.  What really sealed the deal for us, was a recent night at Applebee's this February.  We waited about 20 minutes for a table, which was fine, it was Friday night after all, and were seated in the dining room.  Waited at least 20 minutes to be acknowledged by a server, put our drinks and appetizer in.  My husband's drink came over and was in a pint glass with red lipstick on it.  Not the server's fault, but come on.  Gross.  We waited so long for those drinks!  Luckily, another one quickly made it over.  Got our appetizer, put our entrees in, and were hoping for more drinks.  But our server was nowhere to be found.  By the time he came back around, we were both over it and ready to go home, so just asked for to go boxes because we had fully digested in the amount of time it took him to come back over to us- never apologizing for the wait or even asking if we needed anything else.  The to-go boxes never made it and the server disappeared again.  When I was about to get up and ask a hostess for boxes, he conveniently came back, so we grabbed the boxes and got out of there.  I just can't take the lack of customer service here--it kills me, because we really liked this Applebee's location.  If it's understaffed on a Friday night, then that needs to be addressed by Management.  People go out to eat because they want a night off from the usual routine.  They want to relax, have drinks and food with friends/family--it's a shame to see this Applebee's go under because of the poor service.  Is it a training issue?  Why are the servers so poorly trained and inattentive?  I will also add, we always left the servers 20% tips despite their sub-par service- people have off days and I know it's a living, but we just can't take it anymore and won't be coming back.  We haven't escalated our issues to Management because by the time our servers come to our attention, we just want to leave and go home without causing a fuss.  I get it, this industry can be overwhelming, but customer service is a fundamental principal of any occupation.  End rant. Get it together, Applebee's, you can be so much better!"},{"name":"Thai Bloom","address":"3800 SW Cedar Hills Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"Way overpriced.

I did enjoy the fact that I got a bone-in leg and a thigh--the breast gets annoying after a while, but what concerned me and affected the flavor were two things.  The batter wasn't good.  It tasted and had the same texture as what Chinese food places use for their general tso chicken and orange chicken.  It didn't have that golden crunchy feel or look.  The batter was thick and didn't match what southern fried chicken should be.  I think they need to do something similar to what 'screen door' or 'bread and ink' do;  I am referring to the batter only.  The 2nd issue comes from a theory that I have;  I think they just toss the COOKED rotisserie chicken in batter and fry it to create their fried chicken.  This technique might work, but it still gives the chicken an off texture.  Issue #1 probably stems from the shortcut they take with not preparing the chicken the right way.   I really wish that they fix this, because I see solid potential here.  The chicken was still moist, seasoned well, the place was nice and had a great patio, and lastly, the waffle was a pretty good waffle--nothing fancy like a legit liege Belgian, but still good.\\n\\nAnother thing, the polenta was bland.  If I was in a Romanian prison, I'd probably gobble it up and love it, but I am not; this is Portland, and you need elevate dishes.  If it says cheese, make sure that the cheese is there--maybe turn it into a creamy grits type of thing, not the solid squares.\\n\\nI will come back, and I hope they fix some things.

We knew they had not been open long and I expected a few missteps.  \\n\\nThere were none.  And, that in itself, is pretty amazing.  I'm only giving 4 stars now as I expect as this place settles in, in will get that fifth star.\\n\\nWe arrived around 7 without a reservation and were seated outside right away.  Score 1.  I expected to have to wait given the buzz.\\n\\nThe space is unique.  Basically, you enter into one dining area where the kitchen is.  You can see the staff busily preparing dishes.  The tables all seem to the style of communal with many of them raised.\\n\\nThe next dining area is what I would call a breezeway between the next building which houses the bar and additional inside dining.  We were seated in the breezeway section.\\n\\nIn front of the bar building is what I would call the front porch and front yard area for additional outdoor seating.  All the areas are quite pleasant.\\n\\nThe Salty Sow has quite a large staff and they employ runners which makes thing that much more efficient.  And while speaking of the staff, they are quite knowledgeable and very accommodating.  We met the GM Jennifer Velzquez who is the wife of the executive chef Richard Velazquez.  She stopped by to make sure everything was going ok. \\n\\nOur waiter was knowledgeable about the dishes on the menu when we had questions.  When we wanted a wine recommendation, he grabbed someone more knowledgeable than him to help.\\n\\nI also witnessed that when two people came to the breezeway to wait for a table, someone noticed them and rushed out a couple of stools.  That kind of observation to your guests goes pretty far to impress me.\\n\\nAnyway, on to the food.\\n\\nThe menu is broken down into 5 sections - Hors' doeurves, Things in a Jar, Vegetables, Ovens, Plancha, etc., etc., etc..., Desserts.\\n\\nWe order two Hors' doeurves - The duck fat fries and the chicken liver mousse.  Both were outstanding.  And the portion is much more than I expected (which I will keep in mind for next time).  The fries come with two slow poached eggs on top and a cold bernaise sauce.  These things are an awesome guilty pleasure.  Breaking the eggs over the fries and dipping into the yolks felt so wrong yet so right.\\n\\nThe mousse is a perfect example of what this dish should be.  I make this quite often myself and found this one to be right on the mark.  I would only suggest more toasting on the crostini served with it.\\n\\nAfter that, we move on and order two of the vegetable list and one Plancha dish - Romanesco and Wild Rice Casserole, Crisply Brussel Sprout Leaves, and the Petite Bone-in Filets.\\n\\nThe Casserole had great flavor and texture.  The Romanesco was not over cooked and still somewhat crunchy but not tough.  The almonds add great crunch.  My wife liked the dish but I concur with here that the cream could be reduced a little bit more.\\n\\nThe brussel sprout leaves were perfect.  Great flavor balance with the raisins and nice play between bitterness and sweet.  Zero issues with this dish.\\n\\nThe two filets came with what I believe to be enoki mushrooms and a sauce made from bone marrow and red wine.  Being that the filets are cut thin, I worried about them being overcooked when I saw them, but they were not.  The outside of the meat was nice and crispy while the interior was a solid medium.  The sauce really makes this dish.  However, if you are looking for a small 2 inch thick steak, you might look elsewhere on the menu.\\n\\nAll in all, we were greatly impressed with the drinks, staff, service, and food.  \\n\\nWe will be back."},{"name":"TenOak","address":"409 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"The Bourbon Burger makes my night!

Carmelina's did not let me down...the salad was perfect.

We went around 9 pm on a Wednesday night, so we were happy to find that there was zero wait!  This was absolutely sweet because we were expecting a wait and were starving!\\n\\nWe took a couple seconds to scan the menu, but we knew what we wanted - the famous Midnight Train - \\"four southern fried jumbo chicken wings and one Original waffle.\\"  I also wanted to try a side, so I ordered the Macaroni & Cheese to share.  I usually just get water at restaurants, but I decided to go crazy and order the \\"Uptown\\" (Sweet Tea + Lemonade).\\n\\n* \\"Uptown\\" ($2.50) - Gladys Knight's version of the Arnold Palmer was good, but I think they poured more lemonade into my cup than sweet tea, which made it more sour than I like.  Fortunately, when I mentioned this to my server and asked for a little extra sweet tea to even out the flavors, he was super nice and brought me some in a little cup without charging me extra.  =)  Yes, they do charge you extra if you want a refill ($1.50, I believe), but I did not find the need for a refill.  The Coke glass that the drink is served in is HUGE and probably twice the size of a regular, restaurant-sized cup.  I actually had to ask for a to-go cup because I couldn't finish all that liquid!\\n\\nThankfully, it didn't take too long for our food to be served!\\n\\n* Midnight Train ($10.50) - The menu says \\"jumbo chicken wings,\\" and I found that they truly were jumbo-sized!  You get four \\"whole\\" wings, which is the wing and drumette, so it's actually more like 8 wings!  The fried chicken wings came out hot and tasted good, but they really weren't anything special.  I honestly think that Roscoe's fried chicken is more flavorful and delicious.  The waffle was just \\"meh\\" as well.  It's truly a plain waffle that is probably no different from what you can make at home with a waffle iron.  But overall, I thought the price for the huge amount of food was fair.\\n\\n* Macaroni & Cheese ($3.50) - You get a tiny dish of mac 'n cheese on your plate.  It tasted just fine but, like the chicken and waffles, there just wasn't anything unique about it.  I wished there were more \\"chunks\\" of cheese baked onto the small portion I shared with my friend, and I thought that it was overpriced for the amount.\\n\\nAlthough I can eat A LOT, I couldn't finish my meal and had to take some of it home.\\n\\nOverall, Gladys Knight's Chicken & Waffle gets 3.5 stars for their \\"OK\\" food, but I am rounding it up to 4 stars because of the excellent service we received.  The gentleman who served us was so kind and friendly!  We felt very welcomed by him, and I will be sure to update this review with his name if I can remember it.  With the Scoutmob discount, the total bill for both of us came out to be around $18 (not including tip) - which was an awesome deal for the amount of food we got!  I may return if my friends want to go, but it's not really a place that I would go out of my way to eat at - especially considering the fact that two homeless men begged us for changed as soon as we walked out the door.  Memories of life in south L.A. came rushing back, and those are not fond memories...\\n\\nTIP:  As others had mentioned, there IS free parking behind the restaurant.  It looks a little shady and you may have to figure out how to drive there due to the one-way streets, but I think it's worth it when you find it.  Gotta love free parking in Atlanta!  =)\\n\\n[Review 092 of 366]"},{"name":"Chameleon Restaurant & Bar","address":"2000 NE 40th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Wonderful atmosphere, great food, located in the heart of Hollywood.

Again, very moist and you could taste the white oak? smoke which gently kissed the ribs. ;)  I can't remember what Franklin ribs tasted like (Time for another visit), but these ribs are my favorite in town now.\\n\\nSausage was great.. I'm really not too picky on sausage, so as long as it isn't dried out, you can hardly do sausage wrong in my book.\\n\\nOverall.. I actually like the food better than JMueller.  JMueller had a much more peppery flavor which I found a tad overpowering.  I also think the meat now is much more tender and juicy as well.\\n\\nThumbs up on the sauce as well.  Sweet with just enough pepper... wonderful.\\n\\nI'd be curious to know more about the name.. it doesn't seem to fit given the location and type of BBQ, actually seems like a downright bad match *shrug*  But in the end, who really cares if the food is as good as this.\\n\\nDefinitely check it out and have a nibble.  10 minute wait when it opened.. much better than standing for hours at Franklin if you have that itch and just about as good."},{"name":"SuSu Sushi","address":"408 Washington St","city":"Stoughton","stars":"3.5","text":"For the price you pay, it's great sushi! I've been here a few times and I was never sure what I really wanted to rate them as mainly because of service. But since the first day they've opened they have definitely improved in service. They're more attentive now and you get your food at a much quicker pace. Plus now they give you a sheet of paper to fill out what you want which makes it a whole lot easier and quicker plus it also makes for less mistakes. \\n\\nI highly recommend going here for dinner and not lunch. The special rolls are served during dinner time and it's a much better value then getting simple California rolls for lunch."},{"name":"Veggie Galaxy","address":"450 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Delicious! I've been here more than once - first time was just for dessert, second time for dinner. I intend to go for a third time and beyond...some of the specials they have sound great, plus I would love to try their breakfast items.\\n\\nIt's a nice space - very much like a classic diner, with booths of varying size and bar seating available as well. Waitstaff is on their game as well (though I will say the second time I ate here, the personality and manner of the waitress didn't exactly scream \\"Veggie Galaxy\\" to me...didn't detract from my experience; I'm just sayin'!)\\n\\nI had what I believe was the Kendall Square burger on a mushroom chickpea patty. Every individual part of it was delicious - the onion rings huge and flavorful, the garlic mayo tasty, the arugula nicely-dressed with something, the patty took all the flavors well - though the sheer size of the complete burger made it difficult to eat. Somehow, I managed though :) Also, I'm not typically a coleslaw guy, but this came with a killer red cabbage slaw. I forgot to ask for cheese, but they do make their own vegan cheese on the premises, which gets cool points from me.\\n\\nIf you just have a sweet tooth, it's worth coming here for dessert alone. The first time, I went with three others, and I shared their vegan cheesecake with someone - convincingly cheesecakey! Also, when another friend ordered a slice of lemon meringue pie, the waiter mistakenly brought us two and, when he learned of his error, gave us the extra slice on the house. The BEST lemon meringue pie I've ever had, bar none. On a subsequent visit my girlfriend and I shared a hot fudge sundae and were pleased with the coconut-based \\"ice cream,\\" not to mention the taza hot fudge and the coconut-based \\"whipped cream.\\" We got strawberry and chocolate, and chocolate is the clear winner here.\\n\\nI wish there were more restaurants like this in places outside of Cambridge. It's actually pretty funny; just picture the types of people that would eat at a place called \\"Veggie Galaxy\\" in Central Square, and then you walk in and there they are!"},{"name":"Steveston Seafood House","address":"3951 Moncton Street","city":"Richmond","stars":"4","text":"I've been to this restaurant for a number of years, having grown up in Richmond.

It's usually not super-crowded on the weekend, too, so a good place to meet friends when someplace like Cafe Luna is booked. \\n\\nOutside of the lunch buffet, the mango entrees, coconut soup, raita, and rice, generally, are high quality. (Yes, good rice is important.) Less impressed with lamb or chicken korma or eggplant dishes, which are my favorites at other places. Kofta is decent though.

You also have to pay $10 to split a meal, and then they don't even bring it on separate plates. At the end of the night the charge that came up on our card was $10 more than it was supposed to be.

Nothing to see here... plenty of better ramen options in town.\\n\\nWe absolutely LOVE ramen, and have it at least once a week, We've been to all the ramen places in Portland. We had high hopes for Boxer Ramen based on past reviews. Unfortunately, we were disappointed. To each their own, and everyone's taste buds are different, but ours responded very differently from other reviews. \\n\\nWe found the ramen to be bland and mediocre. We've tried a couple of different ones here. The soup base, whether pork or vegetarian, just tastes like salty water a little miso sauce thrown in. VERY salty. Maybe at the limit of solubility of salt in water. It had none of the complex spices and herbs that other ramen places have.\\n\\nThe meats and vegetables were likewise mediocre. The pork ramen was particularly disappointing. If you like gobs of pure, white, greasy fat, then you'll love this one. We picked out over two dozen little square cubes of white fat, without any trace of actual pink pork meat in them. It might have been intended to give the soup stock some pork 'flavor' (which it didn't do), but we're not big fans of eating pure lard. \\n\\nThe vegetables likewise tasted low-rent. The mushrooms were very heavily pickled, enough to make our lips pucker. The noodles in the bowls we tried were also low-budget, and tasted like what you'd get in those 79 cent instant packages at Fred Meyer. \\n\\nOverall, we didn't find anything 'bad' about Boxer Ramen's soups. Just nothing to enjoy about them. Maybe the best thing we can say about them is that we didn't get sick afterwards. It might just be our personal taste preferences, but we find the high-quality noodles and other ingredients of Noraneko, and especially the rich flavors and likewise high-quality ingredients, fun combinations, and complex broths of Boke Bowel, so much better. If you work close to Boxen Ramen and have a craving for ramen and limited time, it'll certainly do.

It was overflowing with crawfish and and had just enough cheese to complement but not overwhelm it. However, they drizzeled a mayo over it which added absolutely nothing to the taste, while making the tortilla crust soggy. BIG misstep. \\n\\nThe lamb shanks were a bit overcooked and tough, but they were seasoned well. They also were not properly trimmed, so there was a pretty large amount of fat still left on them. \\n\\nThe jerk chicken was cooked properly, moist on the inside while still being fully cooked. However, the jerk seasoning just wasn't strong enough. It didn't have the heat that usually comes with it. \\n\\nThe pan seared snapper had the same problem that the quesadilla had. It was cooked properly and solved on a bed of spinach and sauce. The sauce was tasty and added to both the fish and the spinach. The fish was moist and had a nice crisp to the top of it from the sear. BUT then they drizzled the sauce all over the fish which caused the crispiness to disappear the flavor of the fish to be overwhelmed in sauce. \\n\\nIn the end, it showed promise, but each dish had errors which took a lot away from it.

We walked in at 10:30pm which I hated because I'm a hostess at a restaurant myself (they closed at 11). But we were so hungry, and we had just arrived from the long drive, and this was the closest high scale restaurant in the area - or as I like to call it, \\"real food restaurant\\" - anyways we were treated really nicely even tho the restaurant was almost empty, which was nice because I was expecting to get long faces. Our waitress, JODY (ask for her she's great) was very nice and I liked the fact that she spoke loudly, clearly, so I can hear her, and she was also very jolly. She didn't make it seem like we were being a burden on her by arriving there late. She also recommended a great Riesling wine which I thoroughly enjoyed! I wanted to order the risotto, but they ran out (I liked that Jody let me know right away!) so I ordered the prime rib - and it was to die for! The chef even came out and asked if everything was to our liking. My boyfriend had the bacon rapped meatloaf! \\"Better than grandma's for sure!\\" We also had an appetizer that was so good that we didn't even get to take a picture of it before eating it. Thankfully, I did remember to snag a pic of the dessert- it was a lemon pound cake with blueberries and vanilla ice cream.... I dream about this dessert! In all, we had drinks, app, entrees, dessert all within an hour and I didn't even feel like I was rushed. Everything was so great it started off our whole vacation weekend on an amazing note! I can't wait to go back to Orlando! Shall return for that short rib risotto!\\n\\nTHANKS TO JODY AND MR.CHEF!"},{"name":"McDonald's","address":"9814 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"2","text":"This McDonald's is horrible.

Its a good small appetizer to share. I believe it was $3 or 4 which is a steal. The calamari was a litle too chewy for my taste ($5) but it was a great sharing size with good dip. \\n\\nTried the orange sunset roll ($12) and it was on the plain side. I think they had so many people and only one sushi chef that we could see working that all the food came out really late or cold.

The Blanche rita? Delicious. My boyfriend had two as Little Larry's (add a floater), and they are as potent as tasty.\\nThe Sparkling Sangria? Super yummy, sweet, with a hit of Elderflower that's just enough. I'm not normally a \\"sweet\\" drinker, so that's saying something.\\nMy favorite, though, is the Rosemary's piglet. That Rosemary Syrup is to die for, and adds a savory element to a potentially sweet drink. I'll definitely be trying the Maple Glazed Old Fashioned next time I'm here, though, because that drink is a) my signature, and b) It has maple syrup. Done and done.\\n\\nYeah... This might be why our bill was so large, come to think of it. \\n\\nWe split the Eggplant fries as an appetizer, as well as a \\"Carnitas\\" taco- for him- and the cornmeal fried catfish taco -for me. Boyfriend was not overly impressed with the Carnitas taco- too rich for his blood. We both devoured the catfish taco, because that sweet onion slaw is killer combined with the remoulade. The eggplant fries were, well, eggplant fries. Actually lacking in some serious eggplant flavor, which was a disappointment.\\n\\nWe also ended up splitting the Slow-Cooked Beef Shoulder for dinner, which the boyfriend promptly devoured. I didn't eat much of it (I was crazy full from drinks and tacos) but what I did eat was fabulous. I had no idea that turnips could be sweet, like caramelized onions.

Whatever the case may be, I was left with a feeling of half-fulfilled nostalgia. The fries were greasy and flimsy. The cheeseburger was hard to finish because the oil and cheese melded together. I was left seeking the accompaniment of something not fried... a fresh veggie option or something sans oil. The acid from the lemon in my water was the only reprieve I found. Don't get me wrong, I was not anticipating grilled asparagus or roasted brussels... but I just wasn't prepared to have a Rorschach grease blot creation on my napkin from my dinner.

It's in a strip shopping center a bit north of central Boulder, so there is lots of convenient parking, which is a pleasure for this area. The space looks a bit dated, particularly a huge circular cut out in the ceiling lined with plywood panels that would be at home in the den of any 1950s ranch house. The staff was pleasant and friendly, but the two servers were just not enough to handle the 15 occupied tables plus crowded bar.\\n\\nIt turned out that Wednesday is wine night and all bottles of wine were 40% off. The restaurant is set up to let you take the remainder of your bottle home. So, although I was dining alone, I ordered a bottle of Sicilian wine which I enjoyed. I felt the general pricing on the wine list was outrageous, but my bottle was reasonable after the discount. I'd recommend sticking to Wednesdays if you want wine.\\n\\nMy meal began on a high note with a lovely tomato bisque. The presentation was gorgeous and the soup was very flavorful. My little cup of soup was served in a gigantic plate with a flat bottom which made it difficult to spoon up, but some of the crusty bread from the basket provided helped to clean the bowl. The bread also came with a very fruity and fresh olive oil for dipping. If only the rest of the meal had met this standard.\\n\\nA runner brought out my entree of lamb shank on polenta with broccolini. The presentation could have been 1980 or probably 1880. Again, the plate was huge. Unfortunately it was also cool. Between the cold plate, the distance from the kitchen, and the relatively cool room, the food was not warm at all. The broccolini was cool, the polenta was barely warm, and the lamb shank was a bit warm. I like my food very hot and this was disappointing. It really ruined the experience for me. The lamb shank was also overcooked. I might have mentioned some of this to the waiter, but I did not see him again until I had finished the dish.\\n\\nI was getting frustrated about no one checking on me and I carefully timed the interval between finishing my lamb and getting dessert. This took a full 30 minutes. I sat for ten minutes with my finished plate in front of me before the waiter made it over and then it took another 20 minutes for my dessert to arrive. This seems unreasonable to me.\\n\\nThe dessert was a citrus panna cotta brulee which was tasty and a generous portion. The dessert was in a sherbet glass, but the plate on which it was standing had a number of completely useless blueberries scattered about. Quite a few of them were mushy. Another dated, unnecessary touch that reduced the experience.\\n\\nI think a $90 meal for one deserves more attention to detail.

Also I've tried every topping and would recommend skipping the kale or ordering it on the side because it 1) tastes VERY non Asian and 2) has a super strong flavor that overpowers the entire bowl. \\n\\nTraditional bibimbap also boasts an egg which this place sadly doesn't offer though it would seem standard...also lacks true Korean flavors in the pickled dishes. The Korean red sauce is at least spot on but if you're looking to make this even more of the real deal I'd take it home and put some sesame oil and seeds in it :) \\n\\nAlso, free miso soup!

I would give this a \\"2.5 It's aiight, but nothing to write home about\\" (you're welcome Yelp).\\n\\nI came back here to give the Thursday Specials (i.e. Happy Hour) a try after having a pretty good previous visit. On said previous visit I enjoyed Mama Mei's Dumplings ($7) so much that on or off the special I had to order. I also ordered tempura zucchini ($1)because I LOVE VEGGIES and I love em more when FRIED, and a volcano roll ($7) (described as California roll with crab salad and baked seafood on top). \\n\\nOf these items, the zucchini was the most impressive. Two HUGE planks of firm tempura'd goodness served pipping hot n fresh! YUM YUM YUM! The dumplings were not as good as I remembered. The wrapper was a bit chewy, maybe a tad under cooked and while flavorful, it didn't give me the previous kick of spice. I still ate every last one but not as enthusiastically as before. \\n\\nLast up was the volcano roll. This was interesting (and not in a good way). I usually do not go for Kani (imitation crab) or Krab items but I made an exception because 1- it was on the specials menu (regularly $9) and 2- i like baked seafood on top of my sushi from time to time. The rub here is that I have no idea what kind of seafood was baked on top of this and I am a sea creature reincarnated to a human. There was definitely some Krab salad, but then there was what I would call dark meat fish (usually the blood line). At one point I thought it was stuffing, then I thought this could be mushrooms, or ground meat/sausage, it could be a mix of blood lines from different fish which grossed me out mentally and then I couldn't eat any more. I just don't know what it was and that is not cool. \\n\\nAll in all, the Thursday Night Special menu is comprised of tempura items ($1-$3), some tapas ranging from ($7-$9), and a few sushi rolls (around $7 I think the volcano roll was the fanciest), and nigiri ($3-$6). All it all if you are looking for the basics when it comes to sushi/tapas, it's aiight.

My son loves carbonara, but what came out was a bad, pre-made alfredo with some saut√©ed pancetta and onions.  The bolognese basically tasted like ground beef in marinara.  Our third entree was one of there signature chicken dishes but didn't have very much flavor at all .  Overall the food wasn't terrible, but it wasn't very good either.  The service on the other hand was terrible.  Maybe it was because we came at 2:45 and were dressed like tourists, but the waitress was extremely inattentive and rude when we asked for plates when we had to ask for plates and serving spoons for the entrees.

This is not the place to go if you are a) snobbish, b) need super clean bathrooms, c) are vegetarian, or d) are on a diet.\\n\\nThe clientele is varied, but there usually are quite a few Latino families dining here. The busiest times seem to be weekend mornings.\\n\\nThey have micheladas here (haven't had one yet, but there are usually people drinking them on Sat. mornings).  The best value is the breakfast tacos deal. They are huge (it seems like 2 eggs per taco, every time I have gotten one), and are something like $1 each before 10AM (I think). The price increases about 50 cents each after that. You can get them any time of day.\\n\\nI also really like their migas, although the tortillas tend to be not so crispy at times.  Their refried beans are very good, I'm pretty sure they cook them in lard (mmm, lard......). Most of the breakfast entrees also come with a little slice of fried ham on top. Again, I think lard is involved here.\\n\\nThe salsa is decent, though frequently too hot for me. It varies, though. I guess it depends on who is making it that day.\\n\\nIf you like trying new, hole in the wall places, try La Tapatia.

I really liked the concept for both desserts, but there was something lacking. With a little refinement in taste and texture, the food would have been excellent.

I went here for a weekend late lunch. I was immediately greeted as I walked through the door but while sitting at the bar waiting for a table it took a solid ten minutes to get a drink. The tall glass of merlot i got however washed away this slight annoyance. It was surprisingly busy for 2 pm and was seated within twenty minutes. I think it is important to note that there was a family gathered next to us, with several children, for a child's birthday celebration. I considerd this an added attraction as opposed to an annoyance. The children were not very loud and it gave me a sense that restaurant likes to foster a family atmosphere which i think adds to its credibility as an authentic italian restaurant. I dont imagine these types of gatherings are held in the evenings. However, if you'e in the mood for something more intimate i recommend asking to be seated downstairs where its a bit more secluded and not as close to the entrance. \\n\\nThe bread was very good and there's olive oil right on the table next to some readily available parmesian cheese. Before we ordered our clam's casino appetizer i noticed that the menus were rather dated, too big, and not really easy to read in their cursive format. I think new ones are needed. There is a seperate lunch menu provided but their entire menu selection is available. \\n\\nThe clams casino was good and whetted my appetite nicely though i felt the serving should have been slightly larger for the price. We ordered our entrees from the quite reasonably priced lunch menu. Of course the price is commiserate with the portion, so if you're looking for a larger portion i would order from the dinner menu  The petite tendrloin was cooked exactly to my specifications and found i could not stop myself from eating until i noticed two-thirds of the plate was gone. \\n\\nThe waitress was very nice, albeit very busy. Our water's were filled when emptied and she gave us ample time to come to our decisons. Once i got the check it took a while for her to notice i was paying with my card.

Oh well, we just had to be adventurous and try them out ourselves. Te Wei Chinese Kabobs serves... kabobs, who would've thought? They also serve other Chinese snack items like dumplings. \\n\\nThe kabobs come in two styles: grilled or in a chili soup. The chili soup kabobs are cheaper. They are only 60 cents each. And if you get 10, it's $5. The translations for the kabobs looked like direct translation of the Chinese characters.  For example, there were Chicken Jane and Wood Ears.\\n\\nSince we were in an adventurous mood, we decided to take advantage of the 10 for $5 deal and try some Chicken Jane and some Wood Ears. We also ordered Tofu Fish, Lamb, Chrysanthemum, quail eggs, noodles, and others.\\n\\nOur dish came out with a huge bowl of Chili broth with the kabobs inside it. The kabobs looked tiny. No wonder they were only 60 cents. I think you would need to order about 20 kabobs to be satisfied. \\n\\nThe Chicken Jane is actually your everyday chicken gizzard. In the chili broth, they have decent flavor. And like all chicken gizzards, they had a nice crunch to them.\\n\\nThe Wood Ears were wood ears. They did taste like trees.\\n\\nTheir Tofu Fish was my favorite. It tasted like fish balls you get at dimsum.

I gave up.    *sigh of desperation*\\n\\nBUT THEN *twinkle sound* I found Tucci's. This place is kinda off the radar, I've never heard any sort of advertisment for Tucci's, but it is LEGIT!!! I tried Tucci's not long ago, and am sold for life! The jalapeno cheesesteak is my ish! (I feel obligated to mention that I am a whiteboy, and the jalpenos get a lil spicy, so sometimes I have them hold the hot peppers but it depends on my mood).\\n\\nThe people that work there are Austinites of course, but they got the talk and knowledge of Philidelphia sandwich maker. Everyone there is friendly, I never feel like they are rushing to help the next customer (so I understand that it takes a second to get my food, but not an excessive wait).\\n\\nIn a nutshell:\\n\\nThe other say I was in there and some random guy walked in to order and said \\"Ey'! What are yous guys doin'?\\" ... 'nuff said, GO to Tucci's!\\n\\nBTW, the E. Wm Cannon location is the spot, the Oak Hill one feels more corporate, still good, but you can't talk with the sandwich makers like you do at Wm Cannon. Good food, but a different experience, but what do I expect? I can't imagine Oak Hill people eating at the E. Wm Cannon shop.."},{"name":"la Barbecue","address":"2027 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great BBQ! la Barbecue and Micklethwait are my favorite."},{"name":"Kabayan Grill Filipino Restaurant","address":"1328 North John Young Pkwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4.5","text":"Was very happy with this place.

Got tractor-beamed in by the lit up case of pizzas. Ordered 3 slices total, for myself and the two kiddies with me. Turned to pay for the food and got hit with a $24 bill.  Huh?  What?  Surely, this must be a mistake.  I started looking around the kiosk and it was only then that I noticed off to the side of the display case that the slices were $7.50 each!  Yes, it's my fault for not noticing this before, but I didn't think about asking the price, because pizza slices are universally $3-$4 each, even in the extremely high cost of living city of New York.  Seriously?  $7.50 for ONE slice of pizza?  To put that in perspective, if a whole pizza came with 6 slices priced this way, it would cost $48.71 (w/tax).  Who in there right mind would ever expect to pay nearly $50 for 1 pizza?  Answer: nobody. Southside, either the kiosk space is incredibly expensive at the convention center or you are greedy money grubbers.  If the kiosk space cost is out of your reach, then please don't ever come back to Palmer. You are not doing yourself any good gouging the public like this.  It only serves to promote a really BAD public perception of your company.  The pizza was cold and had been sitting out for a while (with no offer to heat it up), so I can't give a fair assessment of if it was good or not.

The marionberry crumble bar crumbles were perfectly crunchy, and the berries gave it a tart taste, so the dessert was not overly sugary or sweet. The inside was moist and soft, so the texture contrasted well with the crumbly top. As for the Cookie Monster baby cake, it was the most delicious cookie dough cupcake I've ever had, and the cookie dough was so soft and creamy.

My brother was in Portland earlier this year and did some research; Smokehouse 21 was rated #1 by a local rag. So off I went...\\n\\nHere's the summary:\\nObviously great care is taken with the food, and I can see why some people rate it 5-stars. But for me, it wasn't exactly my style. I had the ribs and regular brisket (they were out of the burnt ends by the time I arrived, about 8 PM).\\n\\nGood points:\\nNot dry. Even though the brisket was not the cut I prefer (the \\"moist\\" or fatty side of the brisket), it still wasn't bad. Ribs were tender. Good sauces. Decent portions. Good sides. The beans were more like what I've found in Texas, and I don't usually like them that way, without some sort of sweet sauce. But these were pretty good. The pear cider was crisp and just dry enough, and I recommend it. Service was very friendly. I liked the ambiance of the joint.\\n\\nPoints off -- in my opinion:\\nEven though the ribs were not dry, I could have used a bit of marbling in the ribs for flavor. Maybe the fat had been cooked-out over time time before they got to my plate, but the end result was the same. Also, the smoke flavor was too subtle for me; it was surely smoked, because there was a smoke ring on the meat, but it didn't translate to the palate. So, although good, they could have been better.\\n\\nI had to wait about 20 minutes for my food to come after I ordered. Not sure why.\\n\\nThe potato salad was awesome taste-wise. However the big chunks of lean bacon were like speed bumps in the road; they should dice them at least half the size so they can be flavoring and not an entr√©e. \\n\\nAll-in-all, a four-star experience for me. I wouldn't call it #1 because I've had ribs in Portland that I've liked better. Now, on to the next rib shack..."},{"name":"Is'Original","address":"1671 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Best basil fried rice in the world!!!!

I jokingly suggested to the group, previous to arriving, that we order everything at once including three drinks each and ask for the tab.  Instead, I ordered olives for an appetizer the moment we sat down and 15 minutes later, nothing.  I'm sure I was hyper aware based on the poor marks my boss had given this place.  The waiter walked by and I jokingly asked how long it took to \\"make\\" olives.  I quickly saw this guys real colors when instead of saying, \\"man, I'm so sorry, I'm slammed tonight or... The kitchen is really backed up.\\"... He scowled and immediately went and got them to make a point.  He put them down in front of me and said,\\"hows that for service, was that good service for you sir?\\".....in a sharply condescending tone.  I should mention that I am the kind of person that is usually quite calm and very understanding, but when people throw their bad attitude my direction, I have zero tolerance.  I waited tables for years and if I was in the weeds I would tell people that.  Or, if I forgot someone's item or app, I would own up to my mistake and kill them with genuine kindness.  This is the epitome of what I see more and more in Austin.. This sense of entitlement and attitude that is most definitely not Texan.

The reason we decided to go there was a flyer online about a Cinco De Mayo event at the place... and we wanted to do something special for it. Arriving, you would have no idea there was anything special going on for Cinco De Mayo. It's self-seating so we grabbed an available spot indoors but close to the outdoor patio. The place was really interesting inside. When we were greeted by our server, I got my hopes up. She was very chatty and told us about the specials, including a Bloody Mary/Bloody Maria bar, Mint Julep's & Dollar Mimosa's. This was the last moment I was impressed by our server. We decided to go with Mint Julep's for our first round in honor of the Kentucky Derby that was the day before. It took a while before our server returned, and she returned with one Mint Julep (Minus The Mint) and one Bloody Maria for the do-it-yourself bar located at the back. After reminding her we Both ordered Mint Julep's she grabbed up the mistake and said I will get you one. After waiting another 10 minutes plus I finally received my first drink after being at the place about 20 minutes. At that point we decided to order because we were beginning to see that service here was Slow, the place being just mildly busy. We were excited about the food menu options and I ended up ordering the Migas. I made a point to ask if it came with anything because I really wanted Home Fries as well. Our server reassured me that \\"Yes\\" the Migas come with a side of Home Fries. My friend then ordered Chicken Fried Bacon & Biscuits. She asked if it came with a side of anything, and our server told her \\"No\\"... so she the requested A Side of Home Fries.\\n   We then went ahead and ordered our Bloody Maria's so we could make a trip to the Bloody Mary bar. After waiting quite some time, our drinks were dropped off, and we were pointed to the back where the bar was located. We put our purses on the table, and in plain sight trusting that no one would mess with them in public, and headed to go fix up our drinks. Upon returning to our table, we began to visit about a patron at the bloody mary bar who was just standing there eating all the bacon, and then began screaming to the people who worked there, that the bloody mary bar was \\"Out of Bacon, Bring More Bacon\\" ...when we were interrupted by an Old Lady sitting at a booth behind our table. This old lady then began to Scold Us for leaving our Purses at the table. We assured her we live in a great city, and we trusted no one would steal anything from them in plain sight. Here's the kicker. She said No, not that. That After The Bombing in Boston, No One Should Leave Their Bag/Purse Anywhere. Now. My purse is on the smaller side; nowhere near the size of a backpack, and my friends purse could hold some money, cell phone and a lighter Max. Here is this lady, who interrupts us and goes out of her way to scold us about leaving our bags behind for 5 minutes to go to the bloody mary bar because what... She thinks we are leaving a BOMB on the table? It was a really crazy moment, and I just couldn't believe this is how this old lady lived. In fear of two young girls at brunch in public leaving their purses on the table for a Max of 5 minutes. Riddick. I looked at her in a way questioning if she was really serious, and then turned my back to her again. Deciding to just ignore her sad paranoia.\\n  Another server then dropped off our food. My friend got her Chicken Fried Bacon and Biscuits and her side of Homefries... Then I got my Migas and No... No side of Home Fries. Frustration with the way service and crowd was at an all time high now. It wasn't for another 10 minutes that our server finally came over to check on us and ask us how the food was. Looking at the table she realized then that there was no side of Home Fries with the Migas I had ordered. Once she realized, she said they had forgotten to bring them out and she would go grab them. My friend at this point asked for Ketchup. 10-15 minutes go by and she comes back to say that Both sides of Home Fries came in that One dish (this was her covering her mistake and lying about it) She also Drops Off The Check then as well, even though we had intentions of staying for Mimosa. Still No Ketchup. I'm just irritated at this point and ready to leave. We remind her again about the Ketchup, and at this point we decide to ask someone else for the ketchup that we have now had to wait 20 plus minutes on.\\n  It was obvious that our waitress was ready to get out of there, evidence by dropping the check without checking if we wanted anything else. Never getting us ketchup, and also lying about a mistake she had made. Bottom Line: Food was good, Drinks were strong, Service was Awful, Crowd was Lame. I had a bad experience and probably won't be back, even though I enjoyed the brunch food."},{"name":"Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen","address":"875 Osceola Pkwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"Service was the worst!

Menu was impressive with choices I have not seen on other menus, but I went with a safe choice of two chicken burritos and my honey ordered a quesadilla as that is his fave everywhere.  Upon getting our food it looked very amazing and well heres where the 2 stars comes in........His Quesadilla was huge and had wonderful white cheese on top and it came with beans and rice, the beans were more runny than other places and I like em to be a bit thicker and he felt that his fajita quesadilla was far too many peppers with not so much meat.  For me my burritos were also huge, but the chicken was a bit dry and bland and very stringy and chewy, and it was pretty much like they opened a can of diced tomatoes and poored that over my burritos to represent a traditional red sauce (no really im serious it was like diced canned tomatoes with no flavor.)  Alright my honey said we should give them 3 Stars so thank him Fiesta, lol........So 2 stars to me was because once we got our food our server didnt want to have anything to do with us after that, he didn't even check back until we were pretty much about done.....I am a server folx and it is 2 bites or 2 minutes to check back and make sure your people are happy, now that being said he never wanted to come back after checking back, and so my honey had to finally wave him down just so we could tell him we were done and would like a box.  Being that I am a server he got a great tip for poor service, but he was my reason for 2 stars when I go out to eat I want to be waited on not ignored and we are not the picky, ask for all sorts of crap type people we are an easy table and an easy tip, had he done better he would have gotten 20% and up, but his service skills are not good and he needs re-trained.

We're a little confused about where to go because the building itself is smaller than the living room in my 1 bedroom apartment, yet has 3..or 4? glass doors, but we manage.\\n\\nFinally get to the right place to order, spy the stack of menus hiding behind the many people in line and begin perusing our dining options. Not being a meat-eater, I notice the menu directs me to 'ask about our veggie options!'. Well alright, I do, 10 minutes later when it is finally my turn to order. My hopes are high, because the meat burgers all sound very creative, well thought out, and appetizing. This doesn't appear to be your run of the mill burger place, where the options are 1 patty, 2 patties, or veggie. I've been fantasizing about what tasty and clever veggie options are awaiting me while waiting in line (in what amounts to a very hot hallway with lots of flies buzzing, paint peeling, and unfinished walls). Much to my disappointment, the veggie options alluded to on the menu are not plural, but rather a singular OPTION: to pay 1.89 extra for a veggie patty. Bah humbug. So this IS that kind of place.\\n\\nI'm not normally one of those people who gets bent out of shape when there aren't specific veggie options (especially at a place that serves burgers since those are obviously meat-centric)..I can make do with just about anything (I particularly love side dishes, which are generally meat-free) but I suppose I felt a bit led on, thinking there would be specialty deliciousness for me to enjoy, even though I don't like meat. Well, false I was. So I went ahead and ordered the veggie patty along with some a la cart toppings...which they were out of. So, I'm feeling a little nervous as this bill is adding up quickly and the Groupon will not be buying be loads of sides as I had hoped. And in addition to paying nearly 10 bucks for this magical burger, I'm not even getting the toppings I want.\\n\\nBut the good news is that the fries were free, so I was able to to also order some fried mushrooms and a drink (and I think something else that I don't recall). I'm nervous about what is to come, but head outside to play the waiting game. Oh right, patio is full. Okay, other patio. Also full, but a table opens up soon enough. \\n\\nThrough the power of almighty Yelp, we will fast forward about 25 minutes to when the food and I finally meet, face to bun. It is very large, and I realize why I was charged $10+ for my burger. Because I was actually ordering 2.5 burgers. Oh. Except I (stupidly) ordered it with lettuce, tomato, avocado and other things that don't reheat well so I can't eat half now and half later. It's now or never, baby.\\n\\nAnd after making my way through some burger, fries, drink, and mushrooms, the verdict is..? The burger is fine, taste-wise, though absolutely nothing special. Fries are good (but I am a fry-lover like no other. I can't hate on those). Mushrooms are very, very oil-filled.\\n\\nSo for all the waiting and annoyances, the food itself was incredibly anti-climatic. And yes, I felt incredibly sick for several hours after. \\n\\nI feel bad for writing such a poor review, when I am clearly not in their sought-after demo (I work in the biz and now I see how annoying it is to have someone ding you for things that simply aren't your top priority), but I'd like to add another voice in the reviews, just in case there is another grumpy grandma out there, trying to decide if your mom's will fit the bill. If you eat meat and quite literally want to eat half a cow, it probably is the place for you. Unfortunately, paying a fair amount of money for a burger that was topped with mediocre, plan B fixings and in a dilapidated building (please finish installing drywall..it looks like a construction zone in there. how in the world did you get COA and health permits?!) just isn't my cup of tea.\\n\\nMust say, the cooks and staff were all immensely friendly.

The fresh half-size of melon and grapes were also a welcome touch.\\n\\nThe two standout items were the entree itself, and the salad.

My favorite is the Picante Burger which has pimento cheese, jalapeno bacon and fried green tomatoes - it's delicious. The pizzas are also very good, as are the small plate selections.

And, yep, on the way back I had to wait (again!) for a bridge to raise and come back down.\\n\\nBut it was totally worth it.\\n\\nLet's get things straight: the interior isn't going to win any awards.

And I actually went there not two hours ago).\\n\\nHowever, you're not going to a smoothie place to look at the interior; you're going to a smoothie place to get a smoothie. And this was one mighty-fine smoothie.\\n\\nBasically, you're presented with a huge variety of different smoothies and milkshakes you can have. This is a good thing for most and a bad thing for me, in that there were easily four choices that I could have opted for. I went with the banana, blueberry and strawberry smoothie (it had a name but, again, I have a terrible memory) with soy milk.\\n\\nThe smoothie was absolutely delicious. There weren't any clumps in there, which some smoothies sometimes have. And it was blended so that no one flavor truly overpowered the others.\\n\\nFrutilandia also had a menu for some sandwiches, all of which looked pretty good. I'll have to check those out some other time.\\n\\nSo! If you're looking for a smoothie during the cold winter months, I'd recommend trying Fruitlandia.\\n\\nI will end with a question instead of a statement:\\n\\nIs this place really called \\"Frutilandia\\" or is it a misspelling of \\"Fruitlandia\\"?

I ordered through a delivery service, the \\"half smoked chicken\\" with two sides. I chose the Mac and cheese and the fingerling potato salad for the sides. The chicken was very small, about the size of a Cornish game hen. The skin had been left on and rubbed with a dry seasoning, which was inedibly salty. I'm usually the person at the table who adds salt to everything, so if I think something is too salty, you better believe it! Additionally, I wouldn't have eaten the skin even if it was properly seasoned, as it was dry and leathery. As for the sides, I only got to try one, as what was delivered was Mac and cheese, and coleslaw (which I hate) - no potato salad was delivered. The Mac and cheese was edible, could have had a bit cheesier taste but was not unbearable; however, the bacon pieces that were mixed in were hard, chewy, and added nothing to the flavor of the dish. It could  just have well been left out, in fact, I picked all the (thankfully few) pieces of bacon out and threw them away.

I think that the entire staff may be smoking waaaaaaaayyyyyyyy too much dope to be effectively running the operation.  The delivery times for being so close to our house are always crazy long, and we end up just going to pick the damn thing up to save some time.  Last time we ordered, I spoke on the phone to a woman who was convinced that my name was Eileen.  After repeatedly yelling (in a nice but loud way) into the phone, \\"No Andrea, A-N-D-R-E-A, Andrea\\" the order still wound up under Eileen's name.  By the time my husband figured out where the pizza was with them, it was cold and had to be heated up in the microwave when he got home (we live 5 mins away).  Today I called in an order and spoke to someone who actually sounded pretty competent.  This turned out not to be the case however as when my husband arrived to collect the pizza, the order was nowhere to be found.  I've spent the entire afternoon driving back from my parents' house in another city, and he's spent the weekend trying to meet a crazy Monday deadline.  Neither of us was in the mood to cook, so after calling Homeslice and finding an hour-and-a-half wait (which is absurd), we called Southside for a rescue.  Now my husband is in the kitchen cooking and pissed off while I write this.  We can forgive the occasional mishap for some good pizza (just as we can forgive ridiculously long waits for the occasional serving of Homeslice), but not knowing if we will actually wind up with a pizza or not is just too much.  This restaurant needs to invest in good help, fire the people who are screwing it up, and then they'd be OK.  I don't recommend delivery because it always takes forever (even if you're close), I don't recommend pickup because you may not wind up with a pizza at all thanks to the staff (who did not offer my husband anything to make up for the mishap), and I don't recommend eating at the restaurant because the atmosphere needs a lot of work (as does the service).

In addition there is a whole buffet of hot and cold side dishes, the best of which was the potato salad.  There is also a dessert buffet including ice cream and flan.  The meats:  chicken and bacon is excellent, beef, garlic beef, pork, kielbasa, and even chicken hearts (not exactly my fave).  \\nWe had no problemo finding a spot to park on the street and the cost was about $22 per person.

Her mom has connections to one of the owners and told the girl she should check it out as it's 'some of the best interior Mexican around\\".  Well, I knew little of it seeing as I typically avoid Rainey like the black plague.  So it being a Friday I decided to look into reservations (Seriously?  Who does this in Austin?) and got us a table an hour or hour and a half later.  I suggested we go in and see if they can get us in earlier, working in this industry I know that these things happen, and well they did!  We each had a Manhattan while waiting and well, the pricing was similar to Peche or East Side Showroom minus the house made fanciness.   This place is TINY, like SUPER TINY.  It's clientele appeared to be West Austin elite for the most part which made me feel out of place whilst wearing a hoodie and torn to hell Chuck's. Oh well right?  So the service was super great and everybody was helpful and friendly.  Now that that's out of the way, as an amuse bouche they served two house made salsas and a small ramekin of pickled vegetables.  That's awesome and all but they served them with ROLLS.  The girl is from New Mexico and comes from a Mexican family, I'm from Mississippi so my opinion is almost null but both of us were kind of \\"WTF\\" about the bread.  Whatever, we still ate it.  I ended up getting their roasted pork that came with black beans and homemade corn tortillas (fancy taco plate) and she had one of the chile rellano's, out of three options I believe.  While the food was tasty and the ambiance was super nice, I couldn't help but feel a little let down.  As I mentioned, I work in this industry and have a pretty good understanding of pricing etc etc.  Believe me, If I were to go into detail you'll probably turn catatonic with glazed eyes and drool forming at the corner of your mouth, so I won't.  Let's just say that I'm not a fan of paying for ambiance or locale.  Was the food good?  Absolutely!  Was it worth $70 for entrees and 2 cocktails?  I certainly didn't think so.  With so many options in this town for Mexican food whether it be Mexican, Tex-Mex or Interior and majority of them being in the $10-20 per person range it's a little unnerving to spend $70 for two people and having cocktails made that are basically straight up old school recipes with standard ingredients.

They first bring out a good-sized basket of bread, as well as a plate of parmesan and crushed red pepper flakes, which the waiter then douses on olive oil to create the most delicious dipping oil. I could've just had that and baskets of bread for dinner, it was too good. For the main course, I ordered the Chicken Busciola. It's chicken, prosciutto, peas, and mushrooms in an alfredo sauce over pasta and it was delicious. The chicken was tender and the whole dish (especially the mushrooms!) was flavorful. I chose to get it over homemade fetticini for an additional $3- not quite sure it was completely worth it, especially since I tasted some of the pasta off of my family's dinners and it tasted just as good. \\n\\nMy family ordered the Chicken Marsala, Combo Chicken & Eggplant Parm, and a Cheese Pizza.

First off I admire when a restaurant really means it when they say \\"mild, medium, hot or hottest.\\"  I've ordered \\"hottest\\" many times only to be disappointed to feel a slight tingle.  The spice here is true tested thai spice, so beware.  I ordered the basil tofu, the Pad Kaprao dish and loved every moment of it.  I don't think I said one word to my fiance during the entire meal.  He ordered the preaw wan, the sweet and sour curry which he loved so much that he licked his plate when he was done, seriously.  I liked it too but it was a little too sweet for me.  And then came the dessert. They didn't have a menu so the waitress rattled off the choices, which were all very creative and different.  We settled on her favorite as we asked for a suggestion, which was green tea ice cream, caramel mousse and berry compote.  Another so-good-we-licked-the-plate-literally choice.  We rolled on home happy and stuffed that we found a great thai place super close with delicious food, enough to come back.  The only thing I take a star off for is because you have to add a protein to your dish which is just a foundation and comes plain.  $1 for veggies and tofu, $2 for chicken and beef, and $3 for shrimp and fish.  That's not so cool.  I think that veggies should automatically come with the dishes and if you're going to charge for the proteins, then you can do so for the tofu, chicken, etc.  The outside seating area was really nice and peaceful with a fountain and nice patio furniture.

Their molcajete dishes are unique, their margaritas are excellent, their traditional Mexican dishes are quite good, and their guacamole is delicious (although mixing it table side is something of a mistake, since guacamole should stand at least a few minutes for the flavors to meld after mixing).  My only real knock on the place are the prices, which seem a bit much for some items.  $6 for chips and salsa (which are free and unlimited at many Mexican restaurants) seems high to me, especially when the guacamole is only $3 more.  I understand that the salsa is also mixed fresh table side, but this seems a bit gimmicky to me and I've been at many other places that serve salsa made the same day and did not charge such a premium for it.

Let's be honest, Boston is boring. Boring. There, I've said it. So I was very excited for a specialty wine bar to celebrate the end of final exams.\\n\\nI stuck to the by the glass menu that I might try a few reds. The Dolcetto d'Alba, which was pleasant, very good but not the biggest thrill in the throat. It lights up your middle and back tongue and you wait for it but not much going down. I had the cab Franc with dinner and it had that smell that comes with a delicious bordeaux like a nose full of dust. I don't know the wine geek terminology but to a simple but beautiful gal off the street like me, it smells like dust. It was also very good but not as good as the smell promised. My baby on the other hand, had what is in my mind when I want a glass of wine, it was a barbaresco (they were pouring it in place of the Nebbiolo) and it was divine, order it if you go. I'm not kidding around, order it.\\n\\nFood, they are on the right track and I will go again for sure, but they need to figure out their sauces. They are going for Italian ingredients based cuisine which is what we sorely need in Boston. I wish that places in the north end would do the same it seems all I see in the north end are 50lb plates of alfredo and spaghetti and meatballs. maybe I need to scour yelp and find the right places to go, I admit I haven't been since the pre-yelp era of eating out.\\nBut back to the gnocci with with wild boar that I had for dinner.\\n1 They make excellent pasta\\n2 The gnocci was well textured and tasty and soft, it left just a slight tasty flavor of some cheese (I'm talking flavor only it was not gooey or cheesy) like a grana or a very nice parm\\n3 the guy at the next table over's plate of pasta looked equally tasty. I am talking specifically about the quality of the pasta, I make it at home and I can tell by looking at his plate that the pasta itself was well made and delicious and not the rubbery crap I've had in the north end.\\n4 The meat was delicious but the sauce on this plate was not there yet. Don't get me wrong the plate was delicious but it was only an onion away from being perfect. They used I suspect starch to thicken the juice and it was just an empty space filler. My baby suggests onion, and/or root veggies, onion cooked until melty in a sauce would have done the trick.\\n5 - They have speck on the menu, which if you have ever had in or from Austria, yummmm, they wrap their pork plate in speck and it is a real treat. If you ever want to impress your dinner guests my mother in law has a recipe for a pork tenderloin wrapped in speck that knocks people out every time.\\n6 - I don't know what or why I'm counting, but the tuscan style soup, a classic tomato bread soup was so tasty and delicious, I would not recommend passing it up.\\n7 - the quail was also tasty wrapped in pancetta but I can't eat little birds, I'm sorry. It reminded me of that Mitterand's last meal story on NPR where the guy decides to recreate the meal and they eat whole Ortolans. Blech (eating a whole songbird I mean). It was delicious I just discovered that I can't psychologically cope with cute little birdies on my plate. My parents have quail in their backyard and they are goofy little things.\\n8 - the waitress recommended the strawberry millefeuille which I loved, caramelized cookies and marscapone. I was glad she talked me into getting something other than my usual chocolate whatever is on the menu. This is apparently their specialty dessert, and it is really nice.\\n9 - dessert wine, I forget the name but it filled up your whole mouth with this light delicate flowery fragrance when you took a sip, it was a nice nice experience.\\nSeek out the waiter with brown very curly hair and sideburns, he is knowledgeable. He talked baby out of the barbera, for whatever reason he had an inkling that what he would like was the afore-mentioned barbaresco, and it was a very good tip.\\nI will be back and try the cocoa tagliatelle with porcini, I was torn between a few dishes to order.\\nOh the decor is nice too, you can look on their website, I like the modern style without being too dry.

About 10 minutes later and, after being there for over an hour and, since I have a job to get back to, I went to the counter and told them I had to go.  The guy asked me to wait because he somehow failed to send my order back to the back, but it was time for me to go and I asked for my money back.  He apologized, gave me my money and THAT'S IT.

Since its not Korean bbq, I'll assume its the former.\\n\\nAnyhow, you don't care about the grammar, you care about the food. It's in a quaint slightly out of the way location, but positioned in the perfect place. Eat and enjoy some bbq and then there's more trailers across the street to satisfy your needs for dessert.\\n\\nThe line, although seems long, moves surprisingly fast. The guys who run the place are ultra friendly and glad to point out things and help. Free sample of brisket by the cutter at the counter to get you worked up too and boy it sure set the bar high! \\n\\nAs for the meats, we got 2 hot links, a pound of pork ribs and a pound and a bit of brisket (fatty). The hot links remind me of boudin like texture and spice, lots of snap, not too porky, textural medley within with punchy flavors. The ribs are fall off the bone masterpieces, large with some peppery bite. We tried a bit of the sweet and tangy sauce dabbed on and I prefer the sweet (the tangy is a tad too vinegary for my tastes). Its less viscious than other bbq sauces too just fyi. The brisket is a melt in your mouth slice of heaven, some of the best I've had in Austin. Large smoke ring and marbled fat everywhere, a bit too much fat honestly. We chose fatty because that's what we're used to, but it drenched the butcher paper and we felt very heavy at the end. I think a combination of lean+fatty mix is the way to go so your tongue doesn't feel too coated at the end. Free pickles, onions and ask for bread as you go.\\n\\nThey offer free beer, but no free water. Especially on a hot day where me and my friends prefer water (as we don't drink), I rather not have to fork an extra dollar over for bottled water. Only real complaint.\\n\\nIt offers a lot of what we all love about Austin bbq: a unique atmosphere, well cooked, smoky meat but best of all: limited wait time! All the other places I've been to are pretty good in the bbq circuit too, but the wait time is just long....finally a place that has it all without spending half your day there."},{"name":"Chai Thai Cuisine","address":"2447 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"So Delicious.

The food was still mostly quite good, but the atmosphere was lame and the service was APPALLING!  It could be because they were understaffed, or there was an incompetent manager on duty, or maybe Sunday night is simply the night they stop trying, but it was terrible.  \\n\\nI wanted a cocktail before wine with dinner, but it took forever for the waitress to even take drink orders.  When I asked whether one of the specialty cocktails on the menu was sweet or not, she had no idea, but after having waited 15 minutes for a drink order to be taken, I was impatient and ordered it anyways.  Although the bottle of wine somebody else ordered soon came out, my cocktail didn't arrive until AFTER our food had arrived, and was, it turned out, excessively sweet.  The waitress agreed to ask the bartender to make the drink less sweet, and it was fine after that but as a result I didn't get to start drinking my \\"pre-dinner\\" cocktail until halfway through the meal.  It was clear that other customers around our table were also impatient with the service.\\n\\nThe atmosphere in Casablanca Sunday night was also pathetically like being inside a supermarket or Walmart, with the lights up quite bright (this around 8pm) and no music to dampen inter-table noise/conversation.  Also, we were seated in the front part of the restaurant, as if the nicer rear part was crowded, although when I went to the restroom in the middle of the meal I found the back empty!\\n\\nWhen I lived in Cambridge for years in the 2000s, Casablanca was one of the hippest, best-atmosphere places to go in Harvard Square, with impeccable service and waitstaff who were quite on the ball.  It was for this reason that I went there Sunday night, taking two friends who'd never been to Harvard square to what I thought would be one of the best restaurant experiences there.  Although the food was mostly good (with the exception of the PEI mussels), I was embarrassed for myself having taken my friends to such a terrible place, for Casablanca, which should probably close rather than continue to offer such poor dining experiences, and for Harvard Square, which, through Casablanca, showed itself to offer a dining experience little better than what is on offer in the some of the most unsophisticated villages in the region where I currently live."},{"name":"Spoon Eastside","address":"749 Moreland Ave SE, Ste C-105","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place is great and right by my job.

The food is 3.5 stars, not terribly toned down to Western palate, nor is it very authentic. I guess for Vancouver, it is decent Thai cuisine.\\n\\nI have been here a few times now as it is near work. If the restaurant is crowded or if you are ordering something that needs more time (e.g. BBQ or grilled anything), be prepared for a wait of at least 15 minutes. \\n\\nThe tom yum soup and tom kha are both good, personally I prefer the tom kha as the coconut gives a richer finish. It is not very spicy and has a tart taste to it.\\n\\nThe pad thai is average and is Thai spicy (I could not remember if I requested for that). I like how they do have the typical Thai seasonings (cut chilies, fish sauce, sugar and chili flakes) in a container. You will need to request for it as it is only 1 container to be shared. \\n\\nThe BBQ chicken is surprisingly good and worth the wait. The meat is tender and well marinated. I will skip the sweet chili sauce as it detracts from the taste. I will ask for the chili flakes instead if I want to spice it up. \\n\\nThe fried rice has pineapple in it and is not bad, likewise for the chicken with eggplant dish. Not the best but acceptable. \\n\\nOh, and the Thai iced milk tea absolutely hits the spot.

I just didn't want to mess around with parking and Dirty Martin's had ample (that should have been a sign). Kids were hungry, thirsty, you name it. So time was of the essence. I remember going back here when I was in college, but couldn't recollect how good the food was (again, another sign). I remembered that it was called \\"Dirty Martin's Kum Back Burgers\\".  When we walked in, I did remember that the place looked pretty much the same since I was last here, which was 16 years ago. It has charm in that the interior really hasn't been touched in many, many years and I kinda like it. There's lots of memorabilia on the walls. We seated ourselves in the back of the restaurant where it has half empty, and waited a few minutes before a man came over and asked us if we had been served. We hadn't. A couple of minutes later our waitress, Angela, came by and she took our drink order. Drinks came out promptly. The kids wanted chicken tenders but with onion rings instead of fries. I ordered a bowl of chili.  Now on to the food:  The chicken tenders came out with fries, not onion rings. Not a big deal, however, before I realized it, the waitress had quickly disappeared.  My chili. Oh how can you mess up chili?! I didn't taste any spices, no heat, just grease. When I dipped the tortilla the chili came with, only the grease adhered to hit. Not. Appetizng. At. All.  The waitress finally came back and asked if everything was ok. I told her the kids got french fries instead of the onion rings they had ordered. She said she will bring back the onion rings quickly and that they can keep the french fries. We did get the onion rings pretty quickly, but they just didn't do it for us. I was hungry because I couldn't finish the chili, so I tried a few. It was greasy with little breading. The guy we saw earlier did come back to check on us, that was nice. We waited for our check for about 10 minutes until  the waitress came back and saw that I had my credit card already out and gave us the check.  The sign says they have been in business for 90 years.

The interior is supposed to evoke the patrons of a modern farmhouse atmosphere. However, I found the d√©cor less modern farmhouse and more reminiscent of other Austin's trendy fine dining establishments. Not a bad thing, just overdone. The d√©cor is simplistic and that appeals to my taste, and since the food is the real star of a good restaurant, I appreciate the d√©cor not trying to compete. \\n\\nFortunately for us, we arrived during happy hour. My husband had the house wine, which he found to be a good choice. According to him, it can be a crap shoot ordering the house wine at many places and since I no longer drink wine, I defer to his critique on the wine selections. I went with a safe bet and ordered the Blue Sow, Tito's with a blue cheese stuffed pickled okra. Most of the signature sips sounded delicious, but are prepared on the sweeter side for my palate.  \\n\\nOur server was very nice, but not helpful when we asked for suggestions. He did inform us that Salty Sow does not serve dinner until 5:30pm, so our only option was to order from the happy hour menu. We started with the chicken liver mousse, it was served with pickled onions and crostini. The liver was average, but the pairing of the pickled onions heightened the dish to 4 stars. We then went with the honey rosemary dipped fried chicken, the sweet potato biscuit was delicious, the chicken was good, but I did find it a bit too sweet for my liking.  I would have preferred to taste more rosemary instead of the honey, but I know a lot of people who would rather have it served as is. The duck fat fries were tasty, but we couldn't tell it was fried in duck fat. All three hors d'oeuvres were good, but definitely not 5 star good. The portions were healthy, unlike the prototypical serving you get in most Austin restaurants. \\n\\nTypically we would be satisfied with having just the three hors d'oeuvres for dinner, but given that we didn't eat lunch we were still hungry. We decided to split a main course, and unlike the prototypical Austin restaurant, we were not charged extra, that in and of itself deserve 5 stars. For our main course we ordered the milk-braised pork shoulder with white beans and escarole in an exquisite sauce. I asked our server if he could bring us some extra bread since it would be a waste to leave anything on our plate.  Holy crap it was delicious and the portion was ample enough for two. We certainly could have shared a second order, though that is more a reflection on the mouthwatering taste than the portion size. After my last bite I informed my husband that we will be back so that I can order this perfectly cooked pork shoulder again. He reminded me of all the other delectable sounding dishes on the menu, but I wasn't paying much attention since I was still delighting in the heavenly pork shoulder, which brought me back to my mother's. The dish was executed perfectly, and it was a feast for the eyes as well as the stomach. \\n\\nWe were both full, but at this point felt we should just continue indulging and order a dessert to share. We went with the Bananas Foster Beignets made even richer with the addition of honey & nutmeg ice cream. Wow, I'm not sure how to begin the review of this enjoyable dessert. My only recommendation if you are coming to the Salty Sow is to order it and then thank me later.\\n\\nAll of the servings were big and reasonably priced.

It's a fairly large place but when I got here it was really quiet (it was Monday). There were only two tables besides me when I arrived but later in the evening there were four when I left. The interior is fairly nice and it's nice enough that you can bring a date but not so nice that you feel like you have to dress up. \\n\\nThe service was decent although I can't exactly say they were challenged tonight. There weren't too many tables for my waitress to juggle so I'm curious to see how they would do under pressure. But in my experience it was good. She came and checked up on me at the right intervals and was also fairly personable so I wouldn't be surprised if the service was good even if there was busy. \\n\\nThere is a lot to be said about the food. I wouldn't be surprised if more than half the people that come here don't finish their food. And that's not because the food sucks, it's because they don't skimp on you. I got the cabbage wrapped with beef/lamb as an appetizer which was good but nothing too impressive. The mixed grill platter (which I got as an entree) was another story. The chicken that came with it was cooked perfectly. It was charred on the outside giving it a great full taste while the inside was just cooked meaning it was super moist on the inside (I could tell it was also seasoned/brined/marinated for a good amount of time). The beef was a bit disappointing since they didn't use a great cut (felt like flank) and a little over cooked for a medium rare which I asked for. But given the price, I can't say that it was that disappointing. And I also regret to say I ate way more garlic mayo than I expected to #crackmayo. \\n\\nThe main thing I was disappointed about was the fact that the ice tea didn't come with free refills which was an unpleasant surprise when I got the bill.

We began with wonderful mimosas, followed by the wonderful Pan Dulce.  Perfect, sweet and yet not too sweet.  I had the Huevos Rancheros with salsa divorciados and their housemade chorizo.  This was, without question, the best rancheros I have ever had.  Please do yourself the service of ordering your eggs some other way besides scrambled...a way that involves yoke, because the yoke melding with the salsas and the perfect black beans with just enough Oaxacan cheese.  It is served with perfect little housemade ciabatta that divinely sop up the salsa and yoke.  I shared a bite with my partner and she shared a bite (reluctantly) of her Huevos Benedictos.  The poached eggs, cured pork loin, corn/cheese gordita and perfectly cooked potatoes come together under an unbelievable Oaxacan-inspired hollandaise.  Every dish was perfectly spiced and perfectly balanced.  In fact, that is the hallmark of El Naranjo.  These are not dishes that began their life this morning.  If you are looking for $6 tex-mex with taste-bud killing heat, go elsewhere.

She reminded the server (who asked \\"did you order a Ceasar?\\"), and it was out within 5 minutes.  It was still a rookie error:  you don't make it the guest's fault if you forgot the salad order.  Her Halibut was overcooked by a solid 2 or 3 minutes and quite dry.  In the plus column, the Halibut was served on a bed of rice, and the pickled onions were to die for.\\n\\nWe didn't complain:  the server was friendly as pie and cute as a June Bug, and (more to the point) we were both hungry.

I wrote a note that we were visiting for our anniversary. I do this every year. I was very upset that we didn't hear so much as a \\"Happy Anniversary\\". While this is not a huge deal, this is the first time this has ever happened. Every other restaurant we have gone to on our anniversary has obliged, and done what they could to make it a special night. Tresca brought us a bottle of wine and dessert, which was way above and beyond. A simple \\"Happy Anniversary\\" would have been great, but Mamma Maria didn't even try.\\n\\nI did a Yelp search for romantic restaurants and Mamma Maria popped up. it is nothing of the sort. Bright lights, very loud, and we were surrounded by rowdy tables. \\n\\nAfter being seated by the host (who, as mentioned in other reviews here was extremely grumpy), the waiter asked if we'd like a drink. We ordered some wine, and I tried to order an appetizer at the same time. He, very condescendingly, said that ordering an app now would ruin the timing of our meal, and brusquely walked away. What? We were starving and wanted something small to eat. I have never heard anything like that in my life. To top it off, we didn't even get our wine for twenty minutes. How's that for timing? \\n\\nWhen he finally returned with our wine (seriously, twenty minutes!), he was gracious enough to ALLOW us to order the mozzarella app. I also ordered the rabbit pappardelle, and my fianc√© ordered the Bolognese. The app was meh, but both meals were delicious. By the time we received them, however, I already hated the place. Our pompous waiter could not have done more to ensure a miserable dining experience. \\n\\nWe will never return.

Midwest Grill is a fine churrascaria with good live music, attentive staff, and delectable foods.\\n\\nOn how to churrasco: \\n\\nSit down, order a drink. Go to the salad bar and get some salads and your beans and rice. Note, Midwest grill makes red beans and rice, my favorite! Black beans are what the northern Brasilians eat. In Sao Paulo we ate red beans.\\n\\nCome back to the table and get ready for the meats. Now here's the important part: pace yourself. The \\"gauchos\\" come around and bring different cuts of meat on skewers which they were roasted on. As they come to your table, indicate if you'd like what they have and use the little tongs to take your cut of meat as they slice. These tongs are communal for your table so be sanitary. There's beef, chicken, pork, linguica and other sausages, and other parts, including the infamous chicken hearts. Here's the deal, they bring you the cheapest cuts of meat first. So slow down, enjoy, and soon enough that incredibly tender sirloin will be coming your way.\\n\\nAfter you've had your fill, let your waiters know. Sit back, have a cafezinho (strong Brasilian coffee) and some pudim (pronounced something like poodging). Midwest Grill offers some desserts in their salad bar area, but you're better off shelling out the extra $3 and going for the pudim (flan to the rest of the world).

Sugary, nasty, overpowering, cheap barbecue sauce, with the occasional bit of what should have been chicken, but which was mostly gristle. Every other bite of chicken had nasty, gristly cartilage bits in it.

And both the beef and the pulled pork fell apart with the edge of the fork, a testament to how tender the meat was and how well it had been slow cooked. \\nLots of places call what they offer \\"barbecued\\" because they dump some barbecue sauce on their meat, but what you get here is the real deal.

We were seated immediately even with no reservation in the upstairs area at a table.  The place is beautiful, well decorated, comfortable, and welcoming.  The service however was not  good.  Our server, Courtney took forever to bring water or even acknowledge us, one of us ordered a beer and she delivered it with no glass, so we asked and when she brought it was a little awkward.  Then she comes back finally to get our order and because it took so long for her to come we ordered everything at once.  We thought she would stagger the order but the brie board arrived in a timely fashion (delivered by someone else) and just five minutes later our food (also delivered by someone else).  Would have liked a little more time to just enjoy that. Then we had to flag her down for more drinks she never offered.  Then after waiting and waiting to get our check we finally tracked her down again.  The area was not crowd, as it was a Tuesday around 6 p.m.so there really is no excuse. Just a poor excuse for a server. I would like to think she just had a off night, but sadly I think it is her norm.  I left 15% so as to help when she will be out of job, which should have been the night before we arrived as she has no idea how to take care of customers.

They have weekly specials and punch cards as well. \\n\\nOk that being said there is certainly room for improvement. Either the concept is a throwback to the 80/90's or that place is in dire need of a remodel makeover. Not much for decor but a a few weathered pictures and a business card board. Curtains instead of cabinet doors, big brown boxes etc. Drink lineup is a lil weak. They have Pepsi products, tea, and lemonade. Sugar packets (which they were out of) so I made an a. palmer. They should stock maine root and more local stuff. Ooh, if they sold austin craft beer that would be a game changer, but I digress. Pretty dirty ac vents as well.

All of these ends meet at a menu that is pork-centric, artisan-crafted, and offering up daily specials.\\n\\nI don't remember the last time I wanted to under-order at a restaurant, but this was definitely one of those occasions. Having glanced over the menu, I already only wanted to try a couple of items. Too often, even at Barleyswine, I want to order until I puke. The smoking gun phrase here was \\"neck bone gravy.\\" This nuanced \\"smother-able\\" gloop was found on at least 4 menu items, not to mention in whatever else it was disguised it. Not  a bad thing... but certainly a way to compel you to order less grub.\\n\\nLet me also go further; the \\"entrees\\" from top down: thighs, belly, shoulder, cheeks, steak, filets. Anyway, I honestly just wanted to come here for the duck fat fries. But, very surprisingly, the dishes are enormous. Note: if you come for Happy Hour, prepare to leave around 7PM, having had your night knocked out by your forecoming food coma. At $3 an order during happy hour, these fries are a steal. 2 eggs, cooked 110-minute style, sitting atop a mound of super unctuous tubers. Pure chaos.\\n\\nWe also got some roasted cippolinis. \\"Why order onions for $6?\\" you might ask? I will gladly tell you that this was honestly the best order I have ever made. This side of sweet, caramelized Allium descendant complemented the meal, ordered in gluttonous stupidity, perfectly. We also got milk-braised swine shoulder, and chicken confit drumsticks.\\n\\nOn both accounts of these meat-based goods--which is hard to say, since everything has meat in it; even the veggies are either butter or bone-based--they were rather dry. The greasy mouthfeel of the onions certainly provided that lubrication needed.\\n\\nI want to end with the most disturbing, but quite good, side dish of potatoes that I have ever had. The Yukon gold mash+neck bone gravy tasted like pure butter. Butter may not even have been a component, but this silky smooth mush slid right down the hatch. You could literally drink this white glop. It is tasty, but far, far, far too rich for good measure. I took a bite.\\n\\nIf you want to give some stuff a shot that you might otherwise not have, Salty Sow is your place. Chicken confit, neck bone gravy providing a pool for many pork-centric dishes, and triple fried duck fat fries--with some of the most insane crispiness and airiness around?

This was definitely enough to share between two people, and we were a little sad we didn't have room for dessert at the end.  The chicken was really delicious--tender, juicy, flavorful, and not greasy.  The squash casserole was a little bland, but the stir fried corn tasted really fresh and had a nice little kick from the jalepenos.  The waffle was good but nothing too special.

As a pilot, I fly into NYC regularly and if I'm staying overnight I have my favorite places in the neighborhoods where I've eaten for years.  But finding that pizza and pasta in Austin is a challenge.\\nOn Saturday I was driving with a GF who lives in Travis Heights.  We've been to Home Slice and Botticelii's, so it was time to try Southside Flying Pizza.  Called the number on their store sign as we drove past to ask if they had basic spaghetti.  They do, either with meatballs and sauce , or just plain sauce, but not with ground meat sauce Bolognese-style.\\nWe were going to her place with a rented movie and some wine, so we ordered a delivery of 2 spaghettis with meatballs and sauce.  Each one cost only $6.95.  The order taker said it would be delivered in 45 minutes.  \\nThe delivery driver arrived in 35 minutes, the portions in the plastic containers were huge, the food was hot, and it looked great.  They even sent us excellent garlic bread we didn't order.\\nThis spaghetti was like the the kind I grew up eating in New York.  The pasta was perfectly al dente, it had the required taste of a lightly salted cold water rinse, and that subtle extra virgin olive oil tossed flavor.  The meatballs were large and covered in a sun-dried tomato sauce with shredded ricotta cheese melted over the sauce.  The meatballs were delicious and I'm afraid they might be made with veal they were so good.  I don't knowingly eat veal no matter how good it tastes.  I detected the flavors of oregano, fresh ground black pepper, garlic, and basil in the meatballs. \\nDinner was $15 including the delivery charge.  I'll be calling Southside for spaghetti again when I'm in the area.  I like the pizza at East Side Pies and Frank & Angie's, so I need to try Southside's pizza next time no matter what the negative yelp*ers write.  4 stars for now.  5 stars when they make a good Bolognese meat sauce spaghetti.
