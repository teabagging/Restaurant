(I am looking at your Suerte).\\nWe ordered three beers and one glass of wine between the four of us.  My friend asked where the \\"Texas Hill Country Wine\\" was from and the waitress didn't know and didn't offer to check. My friend was persistent and asked her to find out what winery/vineyard the wine was from. She came back and said- it's actually from West Texas.

Actually, can I give it -5 stars?\\n\\nSo, I'd like to start this by saying I've been fortunate enough to eat at Totto in New York. Top notch, and honestly has set my bar for ramen in both New York and Boston. \\n\\nAfter seeing Totto open up in Boston, I was excited to try it, though put off by the hype and long lines to actually get a seat. (You can't get it to go).\\n\\nSo, Last night was the night. It was around 9pm, I was hungry and knew I wanted to try it, knowing how amazing the one in New York was.\\n\\nI sit down (with no wait time), browse the menu, settled with the Miso Ramen. It came with ground pork, additional pork slices (i paid extra), noodles, scallions, onions, the works.\\n\\nI had to run to the ATM immediately after ordering my meal, due to being a cash only spot. Maybe put a bigger sign in the window? Is there even a sign? I don't know, i'm not going back to find out, either.\\n\\nAfter running to the ATM and returning in no more than 5 minutes, I see that my ramen had already been cooked and put on the table.\\n\\nI take my first bite, and realize the noodles are hard and almost undercooked. They didn't feel as juicy and flavorful as I would have anticipated. This set me back on my excitement, to say the least, but it wasn't going to stop me from devouring the meal.\\n\\nThe broth all steamy and hot, noodles that are semi hard and crunchy, to a fried egg that looked promising. Well, it wasn't. It was COLD, like, barely cooked it cold. I started to get worried. Obviously the paranoia set in of, \\"I hope this doesn't mess with my stomach\\", I put that past me, and stayed away from the egg. My favorite part was the pork, seemed the most flavorful as well as soft and tender.\\n\\nQuickly trying to finish up most of the meal that was still costing me 12 dollars, but not agreeing well with my taste buds, I scurried out of there and still tipped well because that waitress was a cutie and the wait service was pretty good.\\n\\nMy stomach wasn't feeling so hot about an hour after the meal, I didn't think anything of it other than it may have been that undercooked egg.\\n\\nFast forward to 5am, I wake up with my stomach doing all sorts of acrobats inside me,  run to the bathroom and puke up the entire meal, ferociously, I could have replaced a firing squad with the projectile of that vomit.\\n\\nNext thing I know, things are trying to move \\"South\\". Now I have things coming out from both sides. Wow, all for the cost of 12 dollars. Say it ain't so. It may be cheaper to buy an OTC laxative, next time.\\n\\nThey really need to take some notes from New York's Totto. Cmahhhhn.\\n\\nI'm telling ya folks, between wait time to get your fanny in a chair, the time to get that spicy ramen on the table and down your gullet, to the time you're sitting on the toilet, while puking into your sink, this is the true 12 hour dinner \\"Experience\\".

I was just there this past Sunday evening to try out the Chef's Whim for the first time, and I was far from disappointed. The four-course tasting menu was executed perfectly, with some of the most memorable flavors I've tasted in a long time. It was also a strong showing, with no particular \\"weak dishes\\" that tend to crop up in a tasting menu. I will note that it seems like Craigie on Main is less experimental with their tasting menu than T.W. (Improv Night) or Asta. In my opinion, the focus is more towards the traditional, and in a sense, mastering the traditional. The menu had a strong leaning toward meats (no complaints here), and that comes across as a unique point.\\n\\nI remember most two particular dishes. One featured wild-caught Scottish salmon with rock shrimp and mussels. I still have no idea how they prepared the salmon, but in the end it was just so soft and buttery, tasting as if I were eating the highest-grade sashimi! Very surprising. The other dish featured sirloin and veal sweetbread. The veal sweetbread had to be my favorite part -- surprisingly tender, rich, full of flavor, and yes, slightly sweet.\\n\\nAll in all, an amazing dinner at a great value! I highly recommend it.\\n\\n*With my bf, we each received the same dishes up until dessert. This is a bit different than at Improv Night (all different courses) and at Asta (few dishes in common, most were not, ordering a 5 + 8 combo).\\n\\n*I've been here previously and had the half pig's head for two.

Their core competence seems to be designing convincing simulations/replicas, which makes sense given their movie making background. They are good at it and they carry through to the small details in a way that is impressive. Their efforts on that score are to be appreciated by the discerning guest. This is not only evidenced on their many \\"simulation\\" rides (you move only a bit but 3-D films and other effects are used to give you the illusion of a roller coaster type experience) as well as their food options, which often are compelling examples of what they are trying to emulate (like the international pavilions at Epcot, I suppose). Also the staff seem to have the right mix of helpfulness and playfulness  and that is a win. The scale works better than Disney - easy enough to walk around and figure out how to get where you need to go around the resort. Also not just Harry Potter is cool - so is the other stuff (Simpsons, Men in Black, and a lot of other stuff you wouldn't think you would enjoy). We stayed at a resort hotel and that was helpful and seamless.  Oh - don't get the Universal Prepaid dining plan. It's a nightmare.

Innocent until proven guilty - hence the 4 star review - but I will not be ordering from here for a while.\\n\\nWhile this scandal certainly leaves a bad taste in my mouth, the one thing that never leaves a bad taste in my mouth is the buffalo chicken pizza. It is simply divine. I've had many a buffalo chix pizza where it's just cheese with greasy chicken thrown on top. Here, the buffalo chicken could seriously stand on its own. And the sauce is buffalo sauce, not tomato. It's wonderful. Other pizzas are good too, because of the high-quality ingredients, but this is its stand-out.\\n\\nA lot of people really don't like it here, and I totally get it. You have to love thin-crust pizza to love upper crust. I'm lucky enough to naturally enjoy both a thin, crispy crust and a thick, chewy crust. This is as good as thin crust gets (apart from Figs).\\n\\nUpper Crust is expensive, which leads me to remove the coveted 5th star.

We started with the hearth bread which was only a few slices of bread (delicious bread) instead of a small loaf, a mesquite butter (great in concept, a touch sweet even before the roasted garlic was added), and properly roasted garlic. We then ordered the green tomato and blue crab parfait. The green tomato, pickled melon, and sun-dried peach combo overwhelmed the overall dish with tartness. Also, the crab had a fairly strong scent and taste to it, which indicated to me a possible lack of freshness. We then had the aged pork ribs which, despite sounding amazing on paper, were wholly unremarkable. The smoked rabbit carnitas were very tasty and easily our favorite dish of the evening. I did find the pig blood mole to be superfluous since the rabbit was so moist and delicious on its own.

It was definately tastier than any other Italian place I've been to and getting a large order should always be the way to go.  I got the Frutti de Mare as my entree, two of my friends got the 1/2 lobster, mussels and clams special, and my other friend ordered the swordfish and tune pasta.  Everyone except the swordfish and tuna person, who opted for the pesto, opted for the Giacomo's sauce.\\n\\nThe pasta was cooked well.  One of my friends commented that his was a bit on the hard side for his tastes, but I thought mine was just right.\\n\\nThe sauce was one of the best sauces I've ever had.  Lobster based, with a hint of cream is how our server described it.  And she was spot on.  Tasteyyyyyy.  And I definately know its a lobster based sauce because I found a small piece of the shell in my dish.\\n\\nThe rest of the dish was filled with calamari, clams, mussels, scallops and two fairly large, firm shrimp.  I can't stress enough how much I hate soft mushy shrimp as that is usually a sign that it was soaked in water to make it look larger.  Oh so seafoody, and oh so good.\\n\\nI enjoyed my dish so much that I forgot about the packed room and the long wait.  Its all worth it.\\n\\nThe only thing that I could complain about is the fact that the waitress forgot to bring us the extra side of marinara for our fried calamari, although by the time she would have been able to bring it over, the dish was all finished anyways...did I mention the fired calamari was good?  In any case, this is just a minor issue, and completely understandable with how busy the place was.\\n\\nFinally, the workers there were all really friendly.  I say workers and not waitstaff because there was an older gent there that was definately not a waiter, maybe the manager or owner, who was also really friendly.  \\n\\nDon't go with a crowd larger than 4 unless you plan to get there really early."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Ate at this place for the first time while I was in Austin.

Very fresh tasting, very light on the dressing, giving just enough moisture without oversaturating everything. \\n\\nWe also ordered the La Capricciosa pizza with sausage, mushrooms, artichokes hearts and fresh imported buffalo mozzarella with a plum tomato sauce;   Fettuccini Positano with homemade style fettuccini pasta with sauted sea scallops, shrimp and arugula in roasted garlic and fresh cherry tomatoes sauce; and Rigatoni Salsiccia e Ricotta made with homemade style rigatoni pasta with Italian sausage and sweet onions, in plum tomato sauce topped with ricotta cheese.\\n\\nIt was a lot of food, and the portions were good sized (I just finished my leftover Rigatoni for lunch). Price-wise, it wasn't cheap eats (the Rigatoni was $16), but the quality of the food was great as was the service, which helps to make up for it.  Definitely worth trying.

Through the virtue of age, longevity, and, in some cases, hard work, they've acquired respectability, despite their Summer of Love lasting well into the Reagan era.   Stone Soup Kitchen is similarly not afraid to let some of its hippy dippy roots hang out, mixing respectability with a sort of optimism lost on surly GenXers as myself. It's a small, narrow space in a brick store front in Grant Park and decorated in bright, cheerful colors.  Ever changing artwork adorns the walls.  The servers tend to be neighborhood kids, their parents stopping by to remind them that, really, it doesn't matter if they choose Brown over Dartmouth, they'll love them and support whatever decision they make.  Then off they go, NPR tote bag in hand.\\n\\nThe menu is good if not spectacular.  The bacon is thick and the grits are a joy.  But, oh, for a real hash brown though. Or maybe some corned beef hash.  Though they may not fit in your overall motif, Stone Soup staff, consider the addition of hash of any sort a tribute to Jerry Garcia. I'd be most Grateful.\\n\\nIf Stone Soup were a presidential candidate, it'd be Dennis Kucinich. If it were a school, it'd be Paideia.  If it were a grocery store, it'd wouldn't be because it'd be the Dekalb Farmers Market.  If my metaphors got any more Atlanta insidery, they'd implode into a singularity of Peachtree Streets and sweet tea.  In short, Stone Soup Kitchen is a perfect fit for the somewhat hippy dippy, family-oriented folks in Grant Park.

The location is super convenient - you get off at the 39 bus and it's right there. It's also located in the middle of everything. I'll just get to the point and say that I really don't like their pad see ew here. It doesn't taste authentic and the broccoli was raw. It's not suppose to be raw! The restaurant is also really inconsistent. I came here two times asking for the same thing - pad see ew with duck. The first time they incorporated the duck into the dish, which I enjoy because it makes the duck tastier and juicier. However, the second time I ordered it, the gave me duck on the side - unseasoned and super dry. I honestly couldn't eat the dish along with the raw broccoli. I ended up eating all the appetizers. The appetizers are REALLY good! I LOVE scallion pancakes and they definitely have really good ones. The fried chicken is also really good. I highly recommend it. The reason why I am giving this place 3 stars instead of 2 stars (because it sounds like a 2-star review) is because I've only had pad see ew here. I'm sure their other dishes are good.

The aglio olio was recommended by our waitress and it was okay, and so was the world's best burger. The best part of the meal was probably the side of fries the burger came with. Aside from the food, the place seemed to be having a trouble getting their staff organized. The Italian staff were very friendly and attentive, but communication was a little hard. The server we had the second time we went got our order incorrect after she had already checked with us before placing it, and forgot about our drinks until we had to ask for them.

This was a dish with some of the most tender scallop I've tasted with a refreshing puree that went well with the papadum chips. The pickled grapes were a little odd but didn't make the dish any worse. This was also great plating.\\n \\nWe also got the Soupe de Canard (cauliflower soup with barbequed duck, cilantro pistou and toasted almonds). How this one worked was you took a photo of the pretty soup and proceeded to swirl it all together; at least, that's how we went about it. Maybe a different tax bracket would approach this more elegantly. This was a very thick soup and the duck almost tasted like pork; it was delicious and gets my vote for choice appetizer.\\n \\nMy choice of entree was the Moules Frites 'Congolaise' (mussels in tomato coconut cream soup with fries). Watching this come in was a treat. A giant pot landed in front of me and I could see the light escaping as our waiter pulled back the lid. These are some deliciously large mussels. I didn't have to go fishing for many mussels either; most of them stayed in the shell. The lid of the pot doubles as your shell bin. Pure genius. The tomato coconut cream soup was also great to douse the mussels in and was incredibly filling. The fries on the side were just bonus at this point. This and the other mussel dish easily get my vote for choice entree.\\n \\nWe also tried the Curry D'omble de L'arctique(roasted arctic char with parsnip miso curry, kale, sorrel, pomegranate, and pint nuts). This was some of the softest char I've had, even softer than at Catch-122. You get two hearty offerings of char and the pomegranate tasted alright with it though I'm not a fan of having seeded fruits in my dish. The curry wasn't as spicy as I'd like but this might just be the Belgian style of preparation.\\n \\nMoving onto dessert, I chose the La Barre de Chocolate (Hazelnut praline chocolate mousse bar with sherry vinegar and burnt cinnamon milk foam). This was quite the way to over-exaggerate a chocolate bar. I didn't taste much of the sherry vinegar and I think the chocolate shell got in the way of enjoying the mousse inside. The milk foam had a good amount of cinnamon and made the chocolate shell a little more enjoyable.\\n \\nWe also got to try the Gateaux de Chevre ((Goat) Cheesecake with speculoos, green apple sorbet, and quince caramel). This was an interesting mishmash of ingredients. I'd never had goat cheesecake before but it's similar to regular cheesecake though just a tad smoother. The best part of this was looking at the caramel holding up the dessert; it looks like cracked glass you'd see in a chapel. Simply beautiful.

So here I was at Craigie again for a belated graduation celebration with one of my best friends who offered to take me here for dinner. I have great friends...who apparently love me enough to take me to my favorite restaurant ever! This particular evening ended up being a book signing/tour event so there were several ingredients and plates on the menu that are not usually there. The bartender also made a drink up for that evening that went with the prix fixe and it was pretty darn tasty.\\n\\nFor appetizers I got the ragout and the bone marrow. The ragout had veal sweet breads and cocks comb on it that evening. I've been dying to try cocks comb and while they were prepared fantastically, but they are not my thing I've discovered. But at least I get to cross it off of the list...As usual, the egg on top was cooked perfectly and the yolk flowed beautifully. I love a well cooked egg. The marrow was absolutely sublime as well and I never noted this before in any of my reviews, I think, but I love the fact that they cut the bone for you so it is easier to get all of the marrow. \\n\\nFor my main course I had venison 2 ways -- sausage and steak. This was a real treat as I rarely get to have venison in a restaurant and it was cooked to perfection -- medium rare, with a beautiful center. \\n\\nMy dessert was absolute heaven. I got the chocolate tart with salted butterscotch, a huckleberry sauce, and white chocolate-miso ice cream. I was super excited to try this because the ice cream alone sounded really interesting. It was a fantastic mix of salty and sweet and provided a great addition to the tart. \\n\\nAfter we left, I noticed there is a pumpkin soup on their menu that sounds great.

One thing is clear. Texas Barbecue is meant to be experienced in a rough and tumble place, and the Salt Lick expermiment on 620 with tablecloths was doomed to fail. The $23 all-you-can-eat choice is a good one because they now let you take everything you ordered for seconds or thirds back home. This means you easily get a whole second meal for free.

My dad ordered a pizza that was described as having ham and artichoke hearts but had extremely little of either. My mom ordered venison ravioli which desperately needed a little salt. My sister ordered mushroom papardelle which was undercooked and shockingly bland considering how flavorful a good mushroom dish can be.

This one is more like a franchise, as it's separately owned from the extremely popular New York locations. It definitely looks the part of an authentic ramen-ya, with a good percentage of spots on stools at the counter overlooking the action. The layouts here and the 2 in NY are very similar. \\nFor the broth it's chicken, chicken, and more chicken. It's Totto's claim to fame and is terrific. Body is on the thin side with the lack of vegetables used. Fairly intense chicken flavor. Nice milky color, it certainly passes the eyeball test and looks like a good paitan broth.\\nEverything else doesn't quite reach the high bar set by the broth. Most bowls get straight thin white noodles. These are too soft for my taste, as I get too much Squish Squish with little resistance. The Miso get slightly wavy medium yellow noodles. These are better with more bite and come chew. \\nMiso Ramen is still light-bodied. It gets a paste that is nutty but the flavor is too subdued. Spicy Ramen uses a chili sesame oil which gives it about 5 out of 10 heat but is slightly harsh going down. \\nMega Ramen talks a big game but doesn't deliver, especially considering it now holds the title of most expensive bowl in town at $15.50. You get thick pork belly, thin char siu, and shredded shoulder. Sounds like a lot and comes in a huge bowl but what arrives is pretty skimpy. \\nThe meat is a weak point here. Chicken breast is passable but dry. Pork belly is on the tough side, dry and stringy. Only on my most recent visit (my 4th) did I get pork that was barely acceptable. Chicken and pork get time under a butane torch on one side for a bit of char. \\nChar Siu Buns are a good size but are not pleasant to eat if you get some tough meat. \\nYou no longer have to line up, even before opening. Just look for the person holding the blue clipboard and put your name in. Makes things easier. \\n\\nBoston's version of Totto probably won't meet expectations of those looking for NY's heavyweight locations.

I didn't at all feel that this place lived up to its reviews and publicity. Everything seemed off.\\n\\nThe service was uncoordinated--we had been asked several times by whom I initially believed to be our server if we had in fact \\"met\\" our server. Drinks were not promptly refilled even after making eye-contact with the members of the waitstaff. Despite the fact we mentioned our previous experience with tasting menus at other restaurants had taken an upwards of 3 hours to get through a dinner, and given assurances that was not the case here, we still wrapped up a 9pm seating at 11:30, averaging about 20 long minutes between courses.\\n\\nBut the food was the biggest let down. From the cold bread (why even cover it up with a napkin in a basket if it's ice cold to begin with?), to the lack luster progression of unpleasant flavors and textures, the inclusion of micro-greens on every single dish (even dessert) led to just a very odd menu. Nothing seemed to be tied to the time of year either--we experienced spring and summer inspired flavors in October. We were also miffed the amuse was counted towards one of the courses. In all of our other experiences this is usually compliments of the kitchen.\\n\\nThe standout dish was the slow roasted cod which was texturally magnificent, but just didn't work with the other elements of the dish like broccoli. The scallop sashimi was overly acidic--like licking a lemon--ruining the subtle sweetness of the scallop. In fact all of the first three dishes shared the same overly bright profile and suffered the same flaws, fatiguing us by the time we got to the fifth course a simple pasta which was just fine. The duck-breast-stuffed porchetta (incorrectly described to us as porchetta-stuffed duck-breast) was throughly gag inducing, basically like eating a piece of solid pig fat--a textural nightmare compared to the cod. The dessert was a major downer. Two dishes, one with fennel ice cream (ugh) and the other, a miso cheesecake, featured puffed rice and japanese sweet potato (just because japanese is in the name doesn't mean it belongs in a dessert) both misfired with odd compliments of flavors and ingredients. I've had unconventional desserts that have forever changed my mind about the inclusion of certain ingredients in a dessert; this was not one of those unfortunately.\\n\\nWe left feeling very disappointed as well as a bit confused. Was there something we missed? Was this an off night? Maybe we just didn't understand the food? Is that even possible? Too many questions went unanswered unfortunately."},{"name":"Chambar","address":"568 Beatty Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I've been here multiple times now for lunch, dinner or just cocktails.

The selection was very limited and nothing on there sounded interesting.  Urged by my friend to try it out and the fact that I was hungry, I put in my order with the very friendly cashier.  When I got the food, I was shocked that I paid $7.25 for a plate with just one chicken skewer (it looked like something you buy at a grocery store and heat up), with rice and cabbage salad.  The chicken was really dry, tasted old and did taste like it came from the grocery store freezer - reheated.  Rice and cabbage salad was ok, but anyone can cook rice and cut cabbage and serve.  No complaints there.  I was very disappointed and felt cheated.  I could have gone to the sushi bar around the corner for something bigger, tastier and more satisfying for close to the same price.

We went last night with group of nine. Here's how it played out:\\n\\nService:\\nAll the orders were taken at the same time and most likely placed in the computer at the same time.  However, the dishes all came out at dramatically different times.  My wings were the first to arrive, 10-15 minutes later the last dish came out and the waitress was already cleaning up the dishes from the first order out.   While it may not be entirely the server's fault a good kitchen team will plate the orders, keep everything warm and grab another server to help serve everyone at once. \\n\\nOne person in our party ordered a side Caesar salad instead of fries.  When the order came out it had fries and no salad.  When it was pointed out to the server she looked like a deer in the headlights with no clue what to do.  As she was about to take the order back to the kitchen I suggested leaving the order here while it was hot and bringing the salad when she returned.  I was thanked for the suggestion. \\n\\nFood:\\nSome at our table ordered burgers; others wings.  My partner and I split the Portuguese and Jakarta wings.  When the plates were put down we asked which was which?  The server had no clue (a similar theme to other reviews here).  I have to question one pound of wings. What I saw was thin, over fried dried out wings swimming in sauces that overpowered the meat by lighting your mouth on fire.  The wings were dry, with broken bones and not a whole lot of meat.  I counted ten in the order and would loved to have had a scale at the table.\\n\\nWings has a large selection of different flavours to choose from. Unfortunately (a loss for them) they won't let you order half and half, like a half order of Buffalo and a half order of Portuguese. That's a marketing disaster waiting to happen.  Seriously, I'd be willing to pay a $1 more to explore the menu. \\n\\nI split the Mile high burger with another.  It was the worst tasting item served that night.  The meat had the consistency of Play-Dough not ground beef.  The tastes on left on your palate were so bland the beer I used to wash it down tasted much better. \\n\\nSummary;\\nI'd classify this as a \\"last resort\\" place for wings.   I don't feel I got the value I paid for.  I was left thinking \\"I could have done better.\\"  Next time I have a hankering for wing I'm heading up the hill on Davie to Score!

We were not disappointed.\\n\\nBased on these reviews, we know it was BYOB/BYOW so we started at the adjacent Winery and sampled some decent wines.  Picked a bottle and headed over to the restaurant.\\n\\nIt was a Saturday so we were surprised that there wasn't a wait.  We were seated in a big room that was almost empty.  Ambiance was great.  Awesome smells.  Casual but fun environment.  Nice music.  String lights outside added a nice feel.\\n\\nOur server was quick to come over and explain the experience.  I don't know his name but he was AWESOME and really accommodating.  We told him we were first timers and he explained the menu.  Having traveled halfway across the country and being in Texas, we decided to go big with the $25 all-you-can eat family style plate.\\n\\nOur first plate arrived quickly and we wasted to time digging in.  The plate has sausage, brisket and pork ribs.  Oh man. The brisket had a nice bark on the outside and was perfectly tender with pink smoke rings to indicate perfect cooking.  The ribs were just about fall-off-the-bone, but had a little pull to them.  As most BBQ aficionados will tell you, that the preferred doneness.  The sausage was incredible.  Bursting with flavor and so juicy and tender.\\n\\nOn round 2, I asked if we could replace the brisket with burnt ends.  For those who don't know, burnt ends are the crispy, caramelized, flavorful outside layer to the brisket.  Our server said \\"of course!\\" and returned with a plateful.  My one tip to you is to start with this request.  They were AMAZING.\\n\\nWe finished with pecan pie that was delicious but honestly couldn't live up to the rest of the meal which was world-class.  \\n\\nAll-in-all this was a hell of a meal.

They serve chicken & waffles, and I saw them come out while I was there, it looked great. But beware it takes 35mins to cook. Our waitress suggested we call ahead next time if we wanted that dish.

Normally I wouldn't give a place that served me mouldy cheese in my first food order with them EVER a second chance, but I'm a neighbourhoody kinda guy that wants to see new businesses succeed in the wasteland that has become W Broadway between Macdonald and Alma. \\n\\nDue to the nature of my work, I spend a lot of time in bars all over the world, so I've seen awesome, and I've seen total shit. A lot of new places seem, at first glance, to look awesome. Everyone's got the antlers, the exposed brick/beams, the reclaimed wood bar top, a couple cool beers on tap, and a few hip looking bros behind the bar....but not everyone has the service and quality control to back it up. \\n\\nWhile it may LOOK great inside, this place is just another shitty sports bar masquerading as a hip new place to hang. They've gone to the tremendous expense of hanging 8 (it might be 10 actually) monster flat screens around the upper perimeter of the place, so that wherever you turn, some over make-up'd dork from Sportsnet is staring down at you. Talk about ruining the work that someone put into those beams and bar top. \\n\\nI like going for a beer. My schedule allows me to pop down to my local at 3pm for a pint if I want, so when a new place opens up that has a $3 pint day, I'm gonna give it a few tries. The first time we stopped in was late at night (after 10, not so busy) on the way home from a walk. We seated ourselves at a large, conspicuous, 4 seater table near the front and waited. And waited. And waited. 5 mins. 10 mins. 13 mins......no acknowledgement. Servers were there, doing stuff, taking orders elsewhere, but didn't seem to notice their new guests sitting at a fresh table with no drinks on it. So we left. Fuck em. Strike one. \\n\\nStrike two was the next week, on a sunny afternoon. We figured a successful grocery shopping trip deserved a beer, and maybe a snack. It was pretty slow, so we were noticed in a timely fashion, and our beers arrived quickly. We decided to go all in and ordered the pulled pork poutine. It came out in a good time, and the first few bites were passable (rolling my eyes at their claim of having amazing pulled pork), although the potatoes were a bit dry. Colony was on the verge of redeeming itself, until I unearthed a sizeable chunk of mouldy cheese. Really guys? Our server apologized and took the offending piece of bad food back to the kitchen, where I had a clear view of the chef's reaction. I suppose a shrug and a quick check of the cheese container on the line is an acceptable reaction...if you're a total fucking hack. We kept what was left of our snack, picked through it, and it was struck from the final bill. I wouldn't really order it again, mould or no mould. Just cause you serve it in a cute little cast iron pan doesn't make it actually good. \\n\\nStrike's three, four, and five have come over the last 6 weeks or so. Again, a $3 pint of something drinkable is tough to beat, unless they're magically out of what you want and have to settle for something else (we actually both wanted to leave, but a miscommunication led one of us to ordering while the other was in the bathroom). Unfortunately the service continues to be shit. Slow and inattentive loses the race, folks! Last night we sat with empty glasses, waiting for our bill for over 15 mins, while new patrons hovered over us waiting to snag our table. No tip for you! \\n\\nAnd don't even get me started on their cheesy attempt at perceived coolness with their 'low brow' Thursday event thing. Get real. And get your shit together. \\n\\nActually, do whatever you want, Colony.

The atmosphere is perfect.  Not pretentious at all.  \\n\\nWe were welcomed with a drink compliments of the owner just as we sat down.  Our server was quite nice and recommended a fantastic, yet reasonably priced bottle of wine after inquiring as to what our types we typically like.  \\n\\nWe went with the prix fix option for $65 each.  Includes an amouse bouche starter, app, main and dessert.  \\n\\nMy amouse bouche was a duck breast with mushrooms and beets, my wife had squid noodles with something.  Small, but amazing.\\n\\nFor apps I ordered the pigs tail.  First time I've had pigs tail - like a bacon chicken wing.  Excellent.  I would have been more than satisfied if that was my main course.  My wife ordered the squash soup with pork belly grilled cheese.  Fantastic.  The chef sent over another grilled cheese for my wife when they saw she ate it so quickly.  First time I've experience something like that.  \\n\\nFor our main course we went with the roast chicken for two.  It came with a rice polenta.  A staffer brings out the chicken whole (cooked) then takes it away and carves it up.  They come back with two plates and all the hard work done.  By far the juiciest and most delicious chicken we have ever had.  \\n\\nFor dessert I had a chocolate mousse with white chocolate icecream and my wife had smoked pear with a scoop of icecream and cracker crumbs.  Both were great.\\n\\nBig surprise, another well deserved 5 star rating for Craigie on Main.  we cannot wait to go back.  \\n\\nForgot, after dessert a staffer brought over a couple cookies for us that looked like mini Pepperidge Farm Milanos along with another 'Happy Anniversary'."},{"name":"Little Big Burger","address":"3810 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"They get 5 stars because they are the only place in town which will deliver a medium rare hamburger as requested.

Yeah...it's just that good!\\n\\nCharcuterie has become one of our more favored appetizers and snacks of late, and The Salty Pig (TSP) does it great justice! Tucked inside the business side of Tent City Apartment building off Dartmouth, TSP is a quaint setting with an industrial facade, rich colors, and the smell of great food. \\n\\nThere are several things to choose from to eat -- salads, pastas, pizza, and the like, but the real heaven is the choices of cheese and meats from their charcuterie side of the menu. We opted for the Duck liver mousse, Gruyere cheese, Mortadella, and Roquefort cheese. We opted for the Fig Jam as an accompaniment. Within moments, our feast was laid out in grand style on a rustic wooden cutting board. Nicely toasted baguette accompanied by whole grain mustard with pickles and onions. We were definitely in Hog Heaven!! \\n\\nEach morsel was an orchestrated oral delight, and the flavors were perfectly melded for each other in such a way as to create a harmonious balance in one's mouth. The Duck Mousse was light, fluffy, and had a perfect balance of salt to gaminess. Likewise, the sharpness of the Gruyere was a superb blessing to the palate between bites of the Mortadella. The pickles and onions were mild and not overly sour, making them and great palate cleanser between the richness of these wonderful delicacies. Roquefort was truly outstanding as well. \\n\\nOn our second visit, we opted for the Duck mousse yet again, but opted for the Brie instead of the Roquefort. Once again, we were just as pleased with the outcome. \\n\\nStaff was wonderful and accommodating. Very friendly, and eager to make suggestions (in case you're unsure of what things might taste like).

No problem as that's a good thing as others want to eat there as well.\\n\\nWe wait for maybe 20 minutes and are seated right next to the fireplace. The soot from the fireplace was a little much but not that big of a deal.\\n\\nOur server comes over and am told there are no alcohol sales but could bring my own. Since I've never been here before, I would have never thought I would need to do so. Asked if it was a dry county and was told is USED to be but isn't anymore. STRIKE ONE.\\n\\nThe person I was with wanted to get the 2 meat plate and have the brisket and pulled pork. She was told that can't happen. Even though they have pulled pork sandwiches, can't get by itself. STRIKE TWO.\\n\\nWe ask for bread to come with the meal but didn't. More about this in a second. \\n\\nThe brisket was OK but came smothered in sauce before I got to it. I would have preferred to add it myself like the R.R. location does. The turkey was very good. The ribs we ok at best.\\n\\nNow for the fun part of the evening. While I was eating, something moved by the fireplace so I look to see what I was.. A MOUSE! It ran along the floor and climbed up into the fireplace area.  I told the waitress about the mouse and she said she would get a manager to come over. Ten minutes pass. NO MANAGER. She comes back over to see if I saw it again to which I said YES. It kept coming to the front of the fireplace and then scamper back into it. \\n\\nTake two on the bread request as we are trying to eat while looking to make sure the mouse doesn't climb onto my feed (sandals on).\\n\\nThe waitress comes back and asks about the mouse again.

She finishes there and then stands around for a bit and then is gone by the time I look back up. \\n\\nAbout 5 minutes later the SAME manager comes over to our table to ask how things were. I asked her is she know about the mouse and she said yes. WHY DIDNT SHE COME BY BEFORE THE OTHER TABLE SINCE WE WERE THE ONES WHO SAW A MOUSE IN A RESTAURANT?

She has the balls to ask if we wanted to pay our bill and leave. My mouth hit the floor and then asked \\"you expect us to pay for this experience?\\". She said 'well, I guess I can take care of your tab\\".\\n\\nAt no point since the mouse was seen should they have expected us to pay for this.

Its like a club that wants to be a restaurant that wants to be a club. The layout is such that it doesn't work well as either. \\n\\nThe food: The food is meh at best. If you want good Cuban food they are other places in Atlanta that serve it up better. What I ordered was quite bland to say the least. \\n\\nThe wait staff: The wait staff has either been under-trained or never trained. They seem to have gone out of their way to hire nice looking women to serve but I wish they would have hired someone instead that understands what service means. Every request seemed like pulling teeth. I honestly got the feeling that since I was their by myself she thought I was hitting on her. Common sense (which doesn't seem that common anymore) would suggest that if I'm asking to speak to the manager, I'm probably not that interested in getting your phone number. \\n\\nThe worse part was that I went to they bar several hours later (will get to why i was there several hours later in a bit). One of the bartenders told the lady that I was standing next to that if she wanted something to drink she should go to the other bar because she was too busy. For real?!?!?\\n\\nThe concert: I got to the event around 10pm and ate and hung out for a while listen to the music and trying to enjoy myself. The music was not the best but I understand that the dj was trying to cater to a diverse crowd. At 12am, there was still no sign of the artist. At 1am, there still was no sign of the artist. Finally at 1:45 am I went out the door to talk to the doorman to ask what was going on. He claimed he didn't know. After the doorman walked off, another group of gentleman that worked their informed me that the artist was still chilling at the hotel and that they had not picked him up yet. At that point I was feed up and left. \\n\\nSo, to summarize, I got ok food, lousy/horrible service, and they took my money on the concert without ever actually seeing a concert.

We arrived Friday evening around 4:30pm and the place wasn't too packed even though it was happy hour. Upon being seated in the restaurant section, our hostess overheard me debating my options for what alcoholic beverage would be the first victim, and mentioned if i went to the bar i could get drinks at the happy hour special. While i wandered off to grab my strawberry margarita, my friends had their drinks served and we dug into our dinner options on the menu. When our friendly server came back, she dropped off some appetizers my friends ordered and took our dinner order. I ordered the prawns (coconut, kabobs, fried, grilled, and one other). Upon taking the first bite, i about melted in my seat. Those were the most flavorful, and PERFECTLY cooked prawns ever. My other 2 friends were just as impressed with their food.

But you can make amazing Italian food with no meat, specially since the menu gives vegan and gluten free options (which we both did not take).\\n\\nI just don't get why this place is so expensive -- I'd give four stars if the food was half the price. It is perfectly fine because I did get a groupon and knew what I was going to, but I thought it would be an amazing experience.

Even if you're not a foodie, but really want to impress one, you can't go wrong with this place.\\n\\nCraigie does just about everything right from hospitality, service, and of course the food.   The staff was warm and inviting, and the service was about the attentive yet unobtrusive.  For its high-end caliber food, the atmosphere is more casual and relaxed rather than uptight and pretentious.  \\n\\nCraigie's food though is the true highlight here with great quality and care put into selecting fresh local ingredients, and if you opt for a tasting menu, to creating unique dishes for the table.  I opted for the 10 course meal to experience the breadth of flavors, and was not disappointed.  A warning that the food might be meat heavy was not warranted at least for our menu that evening.  We had 3 seafood-centric dishes, 2 veggie centric, 1 pasta, and then 2 meat dishes.  That was topped off with 5 desserts for me and my friend. \\n\\nEach dish was well crafted, flavorful and distinct.  If there were anything to nitpick for me, I would say the desserts aren't quite up to par with the rest of the meal.  This preceding dishes were spectacular while the desserts were just good (save the homemade peanut butter cookie with peanut butter ice-cream which was out of this world).  However, I don't really like dessert at all, and my usual complaint would be that they were too sweet for me.  Others may  find them more to their liking.\\n\\nThe true highlight of the evening for me though were the mocktails.  As a non-drinker, often relegated to water or some boring juice drink, the bartender crafted what was a series of lovely and beautiful drinks - with unsual flavors - that complimented the food well.  Truly eye-opening, and in my opinion, worth visiting Craigie for alone.  I had my friend who does drink try them, and she was equally impressed with the unique concoctions. \\n\\nYes, this place is expensive but worth every cent.  I came out stuffed,  unlike another well-received local restaurant offering wonderfully creative fair too *cough* o ya*cough*.

It's a pretty good drink for the summer and to wash down a spiced up dish. \\n\\nThe Chicken Satay had a good amount of juiciness to the meat and had a nice moisture, making it tasty. I really liked the peanut and cucumber sauces. The Golden Bags were nice and crispy on the outside and liked the tasty and chewy mixture on the inside. \\n\\nThe Khao Nar Ped was pretty good, and it's definitely more than enough to fill up a hungry stomach. The duck was not too bony and the juiciness and meatiness made the duck tasty, especially with the brown sauce and rice. I also liked the crisp Chinese broccoli and I thought it was freshly cooked. I had a few pieces of the pork from the Khao Moo Dang, and it had a nice and tasty crisp. I could definitely imagine it as another tasty rice dish. I also had a few pieces of the Chicken Basil, and I thought the chicken was a little dry, but had a decent spiced up taste. I did not eat the Pineapple Fried Rice, but the girl liked it. \\n\\nAtmosphere was also pretty good, liked the ambiance of the place and the comfort of sitting.

The first star goes to my Scallop Carbonara (tasty with large, sweet scallops and bacon). The second star goes to my wife's Broiled Seafood Platter (seafood tasted fresh, and it wasn't overcooked). Where this place loses its rating is in service, as well as the heavily starched Clam Chowder. \\n\\nToo Long, Don't Want to Read: \\nChowder is starchy, not creamy. Service is slow because of our waitress... REAL SLOW. Other waitress and gentleman who seated us seemed much better/more in tune with the crowd.\\n\\n---\\nACTUAL DETAILS BELOW:\\n---\\n\\nFirst off, it's a chowder house. For a chowder house, the clam chowder is lacking in both flavor and texture. They surely didn't thicken it up with cream. It comes out almost gelatinous, and you can certainly taste the starch they loaded up in the chowder.\\n\\nNow, the service here was terrible (probably only a fault of our waitress). I will say that I can forgive mishaps in the kitchen. Things happen, and delays aren't always the wait staff's fault. I'm not exaggerating when I say we waited almost an hour (if not more) for our food AFTER we put in our order. However, our poor service goes beyond the delay in our food coming out.\\n\\nWe were seated around 6pm, our order was taken about 10-15 minutes after being seated, and we had to ask the guy who showed us our table where our waitress was. A couple had come in after us by 10 minutes and had their order taken before our waitress even acknowledged us (fortunately for this couple they had a different waitress).  \\n\\nOur water was never filled unless we asked for it. In fact, our waitress passed our table several times, and rarely ever checked up on us. When she did, we had to ask for water to be filled. I've waited tables for years during high school and college, and rule #1 is to never let water get below half way. If it does somehow get below half empty, you don't ask if they want more water. Just fill it. Not this lady. She saw I was out of water, and I had to prompt her to fill my glass.\\n\\nOur appetizers were served, we finished them, and the dishes sat there for a long time. Rule #2a, when you take care of rule #1 you pre-bus the table. Rule #2b is you pre-bus the table even if your patrons don't need water. Since our waitress never followed rule #1, she never took care of rule #2a, and she never took care of rule #2b.\\n\\nThen, our food took almost an hour for it to come out, and during our wait for our entrees we (my wife actually) had to ask the gentleman who seated us where our food was. My wife even brought up the couple that received their order before us, despite being seated after us... and he even acknowledged that he noticed that! Our waitress rarely came to check on us, and she certainly didn't bother to notify us of the delay or reasons for it. Again, we had to prompt for this update. Not surprisingly, that couple that had received their order before us had finished their meal and paid their check well before we even had our waitress (after being told by the gentleman we inquired with) update us on our food. I don't know if she forgot to put the order in, or if there truly was a mishap in the kitchen. Still, if it was the kitchen's fault she could have notified us when she realized we were sitting there with a bunch of empty appetizer plates and empty cup of chowder on our table... for over 30 minutes. \\n\\nFinally, our waitress begins to get concerned (too late?), and she updates us on the food for a second time.  She offers us beverages on the house, but we decline. Water is all we wanted. We indicate that it'd be nice to just pack things up for us to go home once the dishes are ready. I'd imagine this would show her we had a sense of urgency (remember this for later). Well after 7pm our food comes out, we try to enjoy it there, and she asks us if we want our empty glasses of water filled. What happened to rule #1? Does she not know about this rule? After asking for the check we get it fairly quickly, but again we have to wait. Remember our sense of urgency by wanting to pack things up? Well, we sat there for another 5-10 minutes for her to come back and pick up the check and run the credit card. \\n\\nThe kicker in all of this is that the restaurant had 8 tables seated at the busiest moment. It's not difficult to keep an eye on all the tables and run your other tasks to ensure good service... even decent service. I'm not difficult to please, because I understand food service and what goes on. Still, I don't think we'll go back, despite how enjoyable the entrees they were on their own. It's a shame, because that appears to be the common theme in all the reviews I've read on this place. Maybe we'll try it again, but not anytime soon.

I'll leave its explanation to simply that it made my head hurt.  So for the regularly scheduled Friday 5.00PM happy hour with friends I was hoping for somewhere I could sink into a corner booth with a drink, stare at a wall for a while, and chime in to banal conversation occasionally.  \\n \\nAnd then The Tube was suggested; the complete antithesis of everything I was after.  \\n\\nI've swung by here a few times before, because I've come to believe it's a decent spot, but simply not my scene at night. (Much like most of the bars in the Old Town / Chinatown area.)  But when we walked in at 5.30 to an empty, silent, tidy bar, I looked at my friends in disbelief.  Is this the same place? You've gotta be kidding me... it's kinda... nice. \\n\\nSo we chatted with the bartender about the calm atmosphere and the economics of juice in cocktails, got our $2.00 wells and $3.50 beers, and avoided the Hamm's tallboys (the too hip for PBR drink of choice) for Black Butte Bottles.  Sitting down by candle lit pint glasses I realized I'd never really took the place in.   \\n\\nMost notably the menu is written on one of those Pee-Chee Paper Folder with the tennis, football, and track athletes on it.  Okay, that's kinda cool, and the Tube that the bar takes it name from?  Well, not very tube like actually. It's more like a squashed burrito wrapped in teal and full of F-Bomb droppin' artwork.  Definitely intriguing.  \\n\\nWe hung out for an hour, and when leaving around 6.30 others were starting to wander in.  I realize that this evening was unlike any other here before, and likely an unusual experience that could otherwise alter the general perception of the place.  \\n\\nBut that goes back to that lecture where even Yelp came up as a digital ecosystem.

Empty glass sat before being asked for another which, unfortunately, learned some time later was out of stock. Not surprised since gazing around would guess 90% were beer drinkers. Good segue to the fact that also noticed majority of the tables were eating pizza. \\nThe octopus was spot on, too bad the main course arrived at the same time as this first course.  This was a wild boar ragu, ground meat with good taste, pasta hard to judge since it not hot when I got to it. My wife's main course  of pork three ways was disappointing.

We chatted it up with others that were also waiting to be seated. It was mostly locals eating here even though it is smack dab in the middle of a tourist area. Once we were seated We ordered garlic shrimp and fried pork as appetizers and they were both very good, especially the shrimp. For entrees we had the steak and onions and pork chops and again both were very good. My wife had a glass of sangria which she loved.

Every time I have an out-of-town guest, Antico is a must-do. And it's gotten to the point that they ask me to freeze and bring them Antico pizza if I'm coming to visit them. The vibe in the restaurant is friendly and informal, and the seating is family-style.

A few days ago I had some trouble with my chain and it had gotten jammed in between by spokes and cassette.

We shared the fish croquettes, the spring rolls, the national fish dish, and the chicken skewers. My sense is that they tend to overcook the seafood, although our sample size was only two. The fish croquettes were borderline burnt, while the fish entree (the national dish) was as dry as jerky. The chicken however was pretty juicy, and I appreciated the fried plantains that came on the side. The spring rolls were also tasty, especially the chewy rice wrapping.

I've had the arroz con pollo (greasy, kind of bland, and the peas just seem like a useless addition), the camarones enchilados (didn't think the tomato sauce was very flavorful as promised), the ropa vieja, and the ropa frita (both much better than the other two).

Plus, it was paid for by my company. Being a recent college graduate, spending $100 a person on dinner seems like an absolutely ludicrous idea. So for this review I'll skip on any mention on the price, since I figure if you have $100 a person to even consider coming to this restaurant, then it's probably not much of a concern!\\n\\nFirst, the location has to be mentioned. The restaurant is in the old city hall, which looked as close to a palace as any city hall I've seen. It was beautifully lit from the outside, and had a cozy yet elegant interior. We were seated immediately for our reservation (which we had to make two weeks in advance). Our private room for twelve people was located in what looked to be the old vault (it literally had a metal bolted door on the outside). The room was a bit claustrophobic for my tastes, but still quite nice. \\n\\nI was expecting a stuffy, reserved waiter, but ours was funny, talkative, and attentive. We ordered drinks, and I was very surprised that they didn't have a draft system - maybe that is something common among upper scale restaurants that I'm just not aware of. I ended up ordering a sidecar, which had a more-than-respectable amount of alcohol in it. We also had some delicious white wines. \\n\\nFor appetizers, we ordered a seafood tower, crab-stuffed mushrooms, crab cakes, ahi tuna, and calamari. Unfortunately, not being a huge seafood fan I didn't eat much of those appetizers. However I do have to say the seafood tower was quite impressive. It was a massive bowl, filled with ice and placed on a foot high pedestal, with crab legs, lobster claw and tail, oysters, shrimp, and a small bowl filled with scallops. Everyone seemed quite pleased with it, and I have to admit that I tried the crab legs and they were delicious. \\n\\nI'll also briefly mention that the bread was a tasteless loaf of white starch similar to what you find in Stop & Shop. But seriously, did you really go to an expensive steakhouse to fill yourself up on bread?\\n\\nSince I didn't eat much in the way of appetizers, I ordered my favorite soup ever: French onion soup. I was a bit disappointed with this soup, as it contained a massive amount of some type of alcohol that wasn't cooked off. I felt like I could have lit my mouth on fire and performed tricks with the fumes I was breathing out.\\n\\nAt last though, the steak arrived and the rest of the world faded slowly out of existence. This had to be the most incredible steak I have ever tasted. It was a filet mignon, eleven ounces big and topped with a blue cheese crust. I asked for it cooked medium-well. \\n\\n(As a quick aside, a lot of people in this review complained about how underdone their steak was, and I don't think those complaints are really valid. There is a very large box at the top of the steak menu explaining their system and how their medium is closer to most restaurant's \\"rare\\".)\\n\\nIt was cooked exactly to specifications, as was the other eleven steaks that arrived at the table. The steak itself was everything a steak should be - tender, juicy, and flavorful. Although I was initially worried that eleven ounces wouldn't' be enough, it was plenty. The sides that I tried (potatoes au gratin, steakhouse fries, and mashed potatoes) were decent, but I have to admit I was expecting a bit more.\\n\\nFor dessert, I was able to sample the bread pudding, banana cream pie, and crme brulee. All three were delicious, but the crme brulee was the best I ever had, with a perfectly crispy caramelized top and delicious interior. \\n\\nAll in all, it was a very positive experience, and I should again highlight the fact that the steak was incredible. However, the somewhat lacking sides prevented me from giving it five stars."},{"name":"Miller's Ale House - Orlando East Colonial","address":"2600 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"So we go on a Saturday evening, with a group of friends.

Around 130-ish today, we ordered some food for pick up. On the way to pick up the food, my wife was in an auto accident. (She's safe, thank God.)\\n\\nHowever, while I was on the phone with insurance/tow trucks/rental car agenices/etc, I received no less than 3 calls from the folks at Red's inquiring about when we would pick up our order. I told them my wife was in an accident on the way to pick up the order, and we currently had more pressing issues. After hanging up on the final call, I was immediately contacted by the \\"manager\\" of Red's, who requested payment for the meal we had not picked up. To be honest, I was baffled. I less-than-politely reaffirmed to him that my wife had just been in a car accident, and I was unconcerned about the order. I hung up and considered the matter closed.\\n\\nFast forward to 30 minutes ago: My wife is home, safe and recovering, and we get a knock at the door. It was the manager of Red's, with a bag of now-three-hour-old food, demanding payment. I DID NOT GIVE THIS RESTAURANT MY ADDRESS. REPEAT: I DID NOT GIVE THEM MY ADDRESS. This guy looked up my address based on my phone number and came here, expecting what, I don't know. \\n\\nI step outside to speak with him. He attempts to hand me the bag, which I do not take. He says \\"30 dollars\\". I tell him I'm not going to take delivery of this food, and he can get off my property or things will get ugly, quick. He begins mentioning something about us placing the order. I reiterated that my wife had gotten into a car accident on the way to get the food, and his response was \\"I don't care.\\" So, he was then advised in no uncertain terms to vacate my property immediately, which he did. He then stood on the street at the top of the driveway attempting to take photos, until I emerged outside again. He then drove off, mentioning that if he didn't receive payment by Monday, he would \\"call the police\\". Getting a good laugh out of this last bit, I invited him to do so and offered to call them for him myself.\\n\\nNeedless to say, this shook the wife pretty good. Long story short, as an avid, active Austin foodie I recommend you avoid Red's like you owe it child support.

OK, I tried to order a second drink special but that was also a no go. I ended up just ordering a standard cocktail. Ordered the fish and chips and it came out hot and crispy. The fish (large portions) was light and flaky and the batter coating was very good as was the pile of hand-cut fries. The tartar sauce and the cole slaw were both underwhelming; the sauce tasted like plain mayo and the slaw lacked any zing (vinegar might have helped). I indulged and order one of their dessert specials for the day: caramel crunch pumpkin cheesecake. No disappointment here.

We arrived around 10am ($20 for preferred parking - worth it) and left for Islands of Adventure next door around 6pm (I purchased the \\"two parks in one day\\" option).  \\n\\nHollywood Rip Ride Rockit Coaster - I didn't attempt this roller coaster but my girls did.  It looks cool and the soundtrack was great, but I felt queasy just looking at the thing...and hearing all the screams of the riders. You have the option of purchasing a music video of your ride.  \\n\\nShrek 4D - One of my favorite attractions here!  It starts off with a pre-show in a \\"dungeon-like\\" room by the Three Little Pigs, Gingy, Pinocchio, the Magic Mirror, and Lord Farquaad.  After the pre-show, we take our seats in the auditorium and during the 3D film, Farquaad kidnaps Fiona, which leads to Shrek and Donkey hot in pursuit to rescue her.  Your seats will move, you will get sprayed in the face by misters, and other fun stuff. \\n\\nE.T. Adventure - This attraction starts off with a pre-show, in which Steven Spielberg appears on TV and tells us that E.T. needs to go back to his home world because the planet is dying... and only E.T.'s magical healing touch can save the planet.  We enter the forest setting (so beautiful) before we board the ride, where we ride past police officers as they give chase and eventually \\"fly\\" over the city (nice view) and then into outer space, before arriving at E.T.'s home planet.  At the end, you'll pass by E.T. and be sure to listen for your name as E.T. thanks you for visiting.  \\n\\nTerminator 2: 3D - The pre-show starts off with a Cyberdyne staff member introducing us to the Cyberdyne universe via a promo video, before Sarah and John Conner appears on screen to warn us about Cyberdyne's sinister plans for the human race.  After the video, we take our seats in the auditorium and the main show starts.  Hold on to your 3D glasses and seats because it's such a fun attraction, filled with actual robotic soldiers, live stunts (smoke and gun fights), and continued action in the 3D film. \\n\\nDisaster! - This is an interactive attraction that follows the storyline of a fake movie studio run by a man (played by Christopher Walken).  We go from room to room as part of the movie-making process, before we end up on the actual ride, in a subway station.  Lights start to flicker, the train is shaken by a violent earthquake, sections of the roof collapse, a gasoline truck falls through the ceiling and bursts into flames, another subway train enters the station and derails, and a flash flood of water rushes down the stairs and into the station. \\n\\nFear Factor Live - You can volunteer to be part of the cast about an hour before the show.  There are three main stunts, which consists of the Endurance Hang, the Eel Tank Relay, and the Stuntman's Challenge.  If you sit in the front rows, you have a great chance of being chosen to participate in the various mini-stunts (eating/drinking gross stuff and having scorpions crawl all over your head).  \\n\\nThe Simpsons Ride - This attraction is so over the top!  You walk through a long queue and along the way, there are so many sights (TV screens, posters) and sounds (Krusty and the other Simpsons characters), it's almost sensory overload.  You and seven others step inside a room, get on a car, and are off on a crazy ride, simulated to make you feel as if you're on a roller coaster.  Although the car never leaves the room, based on the simulation, you'll feel as if you went to different themed areas.  There are several drops, so I experienced bouts of motion sickness.  \\n\\nUniversal Orlando's Horror Make-up Show - The pre-show area takes place inside the \\"Pantages Theater\\" lobby, which includes multiple displays of Universal horror films, such as Hellboy, Psycho, The Thing, and Chucky.  Soon we enter the small theater, where the two hosts crack jokes and share some of the secrets involved with the making of some famous horror movies.\\n\\nRevenge of the Mummy Ride - This ride is an indoor roller coaster, in complete darkness.  The special effects are so cool and at one point you come to a complete stop, and then the coaster takes you backward...and there is a (relatively) steep drop during the ride.  \\n\\nTWISTER - During the main show (where we line up on a platform under a roof overlooking a simulated outdoor scene), we see dark clouds roll overhead, a tree get struck by lightning, hear sirens going off, and feel the strong winds, and then - a simulated tornado drops from the sky.  \\n\\nThe Jaws attraction was closed for renovations on the day we visited, bummer!  \\n\\nI purchased two Universal Meal Deal tickets at $20.99 each, and we made use of these for multiple meals throughout the day (for the three of us).  The best food options were at the International Food & Film Festival.

After being shown to our table and sitting down with my menu on one of the bench seats, I looked up at the dense hoard of patrons next to me and felt disoriented for a second.  My instincts told me to ground myself first (perhaps, like an astronaut would do upon disembarking from his capsule); and, with a sense of expectation that justified the act, I scanned my surroundings to see what everyone was eating.  And, seeing their smiles, I wondered if I would be smiling too very soon.\\n   \\nGranted, I have gone to many restaurants and have eaten my share of meals (and, a fair share of barbecue, nonetheless, on my current stay in Texas); but, after much anticipation, the prospect of finally eating at The Salt Lick aroused an unusual mix of excitement and, oddly, calm all at once.\\n \\nShaking off those feelings, I glanced down at my bare table and saw in my mind an assemblage of brisket, sausage, and both pork and beef ribs (all of which I hadn't ordered yet).  My fingers, as I imagined them, were sticky from having touched the glazed surface of the meats that I would be eating shortly.\\n    \\nIn my mind too, I pictured meats that were justifiably savory and robust (and, yes, keenly sweet from all of that attention that they seemed to be getting from the pit masters in the kitchen - with that \\"mop\\" that they use to baste everything with).  At one point, just as the waitress stepped to my table, I brought myself back to the here and now; and, as I turned my head, I swore that the skies had opened up and that the Gulf of Mexico (about one hundred and fifty miles away) had crashed at my feet.\\n       \\nYes, the brisket, cut thinner than I had seen it elsewhere, was good; but, although it was tender, it was also, honestly, a tad dry.  The beef ribs that some had raved about turned out to be rather difficult to eat (as the meat clung steadfastly to the bone and had to either be coaxed off with prying fingers or simply left there still attached).  The pork ribs, however, were remarkably moist but lacked just enough flavor and smokiness to make them an obviously praiseworthy item.\\n\\nWhat stood out the most, perhaps, was the sausage, which was served sliced - and not in links, which is how almost every place in Texas sells its sausage.  With each bite, the sausage, because it was not whole, did not release much (if any) grease; but, also, it did not provide a distinctive snap from its casing either.  Instead, it tasted most like the sausage that I was familiar with prior to visiting Texas (sliced, hearty, slightly sweet, and so pristine - as if suggesting it were not even handmade).\\n\\nUpon leaving with my dinner party, after eating so much meat (and, yes, downing some blueberry cobbler and vanilla ice cream for good measure), I saved a rib bone from my plate, cleaned it off, and shoved it into my pant pocket when no one was looking.  I clutched it with my right hand as I left the restaurant and headed for the car.\\n  \\nWith a line of trees at my side that were decorated with glowing ornaments (ones that could have easily passed for Christmas lights), I felt that I had secured a prized souvenir (something akin to a good luck charm from a special place) and that I had something tangible to trigger my memory in the future.\\n\\nIn fact, a mere two days later, when I needed a lift and something lighthearted and trivial to amuse me, I took out that rib bone and looked at it.  Actually, I rubbed it; and, while the world did not change (nor did I), I did think of the The Salt Lick and its beautiful surroundings just for a passing moment; and, indeed, in that moment (like a child in the presence of magic), I did feel better for having done so."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"ABSOLUTE BEST FRADIAVOLO GRAVY I HAVE EVER HAD!\\n\\nAfter visiting the USS Constitution on a Sunday afternoon, we walked to The North End and thankfully we were able to have dinner at Giacomo's.

I work in the industry and my thoughts are either you're a restaurant or you're an art gallery, you can't be both. It is one thing to have really cool art work in your restaurant that is for sale, but when you sit at a table to eat and they hand you a menu that has $25,000 art work on it instead of food, it's a little pretentious.

And why was your door unlocked?  Later, as I drove by, I saw a couple leaving with food.  I HATE to think this but... maybe they were only closed for tattooed white girls?  I'll never eat here, I don't care how good the food is. The smell alone decided that for me, but the way I was treated sealed their fate on my shit list.  If you're closed randomly on a week day in the middle of the day, that's fine, but don't shout at me like I'm your dog.  You can speak to me in a civil tone.  So I don't know, maybe the food is heaven, but I'll never know."},{"name":"Pure Taqueria","address":"300 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Basic.

And my $8+ for lunch.\\n\\nThis place is great for the variety of sandwiches and the atmosphere, as I noted in my earlier review.  But the consistency just has taken a nose dive, for me, since my first few visits.\\n\\nFirst, the guys taking the orders get the sandwiches out of order.  9 times out of 10, everything goes fine IF you pay attention and keep track of your sandwich with the name and/or fixings.  However, if the sheeple around you aren't paying attention or busy for that all important phone call during lunch, you'll end up getting their sandwich.   They're not listening to the guys asking them questions about their order, and everything in the jumbled line gets even more out of whack than it already is.\\n\\nSecondly, asking for something hot or grilled = burned of late.  I've had their take on a corned beef and pastrami reuben ordered grilled twice and received a sandwich with burned pastrami.  Granted, blackened pastrami is sorta tasty, but not enough to want the sandwich prepared that way.  Whoever is in the \\"grilling\\" room off behind the counter is sorta slap happy with the sandwiches when making them hot.\\n\\nThird, you're not going to necessarily get what's listed on the signature sandwich menu unless you make a point of reading out the ingredients to the guys taking the orders.  For example, a Godfather is supposed to come with genoa salami, prosciutto, cappicola AND CHEESE.  That's right -- CHEESE.  If you don't tell them a cheese, you don't get it.  If they're asking you what bread you want, why can't they ask what cheese you want when it's listed as part of the menu item?\\n\\nFinally, the busier the line gets, the smaller the sandwiches get.  It's like they're slapping a little bit of the ingredients on for speed, effectively reducing the amount of sandwich you're getting for your money.  In this economy, I wouldn't put it past them to cut portions -- but at least don't make the mistakes mentioned earlier in this review ON TOP of making the portions smaller.\\n\\nThankfully, their 2nd business -- Broad Street Cafe -- has a quieter, calmer pace to it and a little more variety for about the same price point.  I appreciate that the owner/manager of both locations -- Claudio -- is passionate about what he does.  Just hope he gets his sammich-makers in line so I can feel good about going back to Reuben's Deli soon."},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The food was great, bartenders nice and comfortable atmosphere.

After she finished up with those two women, she doesn't even look at me for another minute or two. When she finally acknowledges me I tell her that I'm picking up an order. She was confused.

One. So it's not indicative, I admit, of the entire dining experience, but the single experience was worth Yelping about-- without question. \\n\\nI went with a friend for a quick drink. The ONLY reason we went was because it was close. In fact, it was the closest thing. I wasn't expecting much. I remember Firefly. I remember the fleeting Six Burner. I just wanted a palatable adult-beverage. Which I hoped whatever the hell went in there would have. \\n\\nI can't speak for the overall dining experience, because I didn't have one. What I did have was one of the most hopeful engagements of my restaurant life. \\n\\nThe GM-- Jillian (or Gillian, or some alternative spelling)-- is wonderful. I don't know how tight a ship she runs, but I know that she loves her job, is passionate about what they're trying to do, and is incredibly knowledgeable about every aspect of the menu. There was a vague rumor that my friend and I had been neglected because of our ambiguous seating and before we had time to really care, she came over to apologize, bring menus, and engage. That was wonderful, but not what made it so wonderful. \\n\\nDo you ever get the feeling that you could tell your server more about the food and beverage offerings than they could? Not the case here. Girl knows her stuff. She's pedigreed (former Eastern Standard girl, trained under Garrett), enthusiastic, and just real enough to make you believe in her restaurant as much as she does. \\n\\nAdd to that my discovery that it's owned by the Coda folks, which also has that endearing and enduring quality of hip-to-a-point, but unquestionably comfy, and I will, without a doubt, give it another try. They're curing their own meats, serving up an excellent beer and wine list, and the staff is drinking the Kool-Aid. And that's a huge deal. Patrons can tell when the staff is phoning it in. \\n\\nIf you go in, if you aren't 100% happy, ask for Jillian. Not because you're a pain in the ass, but because her authenticity and passion transcends some silly mix up or snafu. Let her explain the wine for you, or tell you about the house-cured meats.

Restaurant was not busy, but even when I arrived early, I wasn't greeted. By anyone. There were plenty of servers around, including one who was off duty and spread on about 3/4 of the guest seating by the door while \\"waiting for [her] car\\" (apparently it had been towed the evening before). The servers on the clock were way too preoccupied with her and her plans to greet me or even asked if I had been helped. While the congregated there by the entrance, they continued to discuss their \\"rough night(s)\\" from the previous night in language inappropriate for customer earshot, including one male server who was talking about showing up to class and interviewing subjects (apparently his professor also had issues with the server's \\"un\\"professional attire, but hey, he didn't care, it was Friday and all he had to do was interview these people.) Needless to say, this didn't give me the best first impression. (I am not a prude, and having been a server, I'm not averse to discussions by servers; however, those conversations should not be in earshot, and those servers off the clock still need to respect customers...restaurants where I worked would never allow someone off the clock to just sit and wait in spaces typically used for guests, especially when other servers are bound to socialize with them. The \\"non-greeting\\" was just inexcusable.)\\n\\nWhen my friends arrived, we were promptly seated. Everything went okay, but when only two of us were drinking margaritas, the waitress seemed a little offended. We twice had to ask for water refills, and we were there less than an hour. While our check wasn't high, as former servers, all three of us understand the value of the table we're are inhabiting, so our tip usually reflects that, as long as the server is friendly and pays attention. She wasn't busy, so her lack of attention to our detail just did not make sense.\\n\\nI arrived early enough to park in the spaces reserved for the restaurant.

I have no idea, but I love boiled/steamed peanuts - this is a good sign.\\n\\nAs for our meal, it was great.  As it was our first time here, we opted for some of the basics:\\nHot and Sour Soup, Seafood Noodle Soup, Pan Fried Pork Dumplings (pot stickers) and Shredded (thinly sliced) Pork in Hot Garlic Sauce.  Soon after we ordered, dishes began appearing one by one.  First , the Hot and Sour Soup - in a bowl large enough for at least 5 people - It was perfect.  Spicy warm and tangy with just a hint of smokiness.  Then the dumplings (12 large) - porky and oniony - with a dark, sour dipping sauce - not like the scallion/ginger version I normally experience.  At this point we were pretty full, but we powered through as the best was yet to come - the pork in hot garlic sauce.  Wow! possibly the tastiest non-fancy Chinese entree I have ever eaten.  Now we were stuffed and just had our server package the noodle soup (and the left over hot and sour and the left over pork).\\n\\nWe walked away happy, full and with most of our money (the entire meal, which was enough for 4, was $27 - yeah baby).

This place might have your answer. Located at a somewhat hidden nook in Downtown Crossing, this place offers up some tasty Falafel wraps. I had the Falafel Wrap twice from this place, and it was probably the tastiest pita wrap I ever had in Boston without any meat inside. The pita bread was so soft and chewy. The Falafel was crisp on the outside, and so filling and chewy on the inside. The hummus, and the vegetables made a great combination that made the wrap tastier. Only problem is that if you put the hummus inside, you may have to pay a little extra. I paid almost $6 for the wrap, but it filled me up for a good few hours. It gets messy to eat when you are down to the last few bites of the wrap. \\n\\nCame back here to see how they do in terms of lamb, and got the Lamb Kebab. This is a dish filled with rice, pieces of lamb, a decent sized salad, hummus, one falafel, and pita bread. Lamb was decent, tasted good with the rice, tasted even better by putting the rice, lamb, salad, and hummus into the pita bread. After eating the dish, I was really full so portions are great. \\n\\nDuring the weekday lunch hours there was a line, but surprisingly, it was quicker than I expected. It was pretty cool for them to give me a falafel while I was waiting. I got my food less than 4 minutes on average, so service is extremely effective. \\n\\nI would probably call this place a hidden gem of Downtown Crossing. I would probably come back here again if I really need a wrap and if I am not really in the mood for eating meat. This does not happen to me often, but the falafels are pretty good here and would not mind coming back here,"},{"name":"Chutney's Indian Restaurant","address":"7637 Turkey Lake Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Tried the biryani!

But as a local resident looking for an escape from the house for a night, this restaurant's fare is an embarrassment to the luxury of the rest of the hotel.\\n\\nHere's the skinny: I've seen better caesar salads served at 35,000 feet. This was a boring, unimaginative, joke of a salad that they charged $8 for. I know, I know - hotel room service is always through-the-nose, but if I agree to break the bank on hotel food, why would they phone in a damn salad? in this case it was just sad. If they served that caesar salad to me in the restaurant I would have sent it back in about 20 seconds.\\n\\nWe also ordered a lobster mac-and-cheese dish - I nibbled on it because of a low-carb meal plan. The lobster was not integrated with the rest of the dish; it was simply lumped on top. Which would have been fine except for the lobster meat was rubbery beyond all reason - like chewing on an old garden hose. epic fail there.\\n\\nThe \\"cappuccino\\" series of soups are good. Not stunning, but passable.\\n\\nThe mousse-mound dessert was the stand out. Tender, pitch-perfect flavor and a surprise gooey middle.

As we do consider ourselves foodies we had to go to Craigie On Main while visiting the city.  We made reservations far in advance and when we arrived we got a great seat over looking the kitchen.  Because we had a late lunch (which was poor planning on our part) we weren't going to be doing the 8 course meal.  When our server came over and we ordered, one of us got the three course meal, a few of us ordered just entrees and a couple of us shared a handful of appetizers.  Throw that in with multiple rounds of wine and 4 desserts we were well on our way.  The snobby experience we had w/ the waiter was almost unbelievable.  When we told him that we weren't doing the tasting he pretty much turned over our table to a food runner.  We were staring at empty plates that would not get cleared.  It was a pretty awful experience as we weren't ordering the large meal because we were cheap but rather not starving......\\n\\nAside from that the food was good but nothing to write home about.  We have such amazing restaurants in LA that I guess we expected more from this hyped up restaurant.  The service honestly could of turned us off to where there was no way we could enjoy the food.  All and all the food was decent, certainly creative but nothing that is so memorable and outstanding you savor every bite good.\\n\\nLastly, since one of my girlfriends is such a foodie, she was hoping the James Beard awarded chef could come by our table since he had been dropping off food for other tables all night.

Why not take a trip out to check out Cackalack's?  After all, Eat Street and previous reviews can't be wrong, and we've been looking forward to trying the big chicken sandwiches cheered on national television.  Honestly, there had been a couple of people tell us the food truck had greatly gone down in quality since the truck had sold to a new owner, but as always, we believe we should come to our own conclusion.\\n\\nThis chicken put the \\"awe\\" in awful.  The chicken coating was burned, period.  If you don't believe me, please see the attached picture.  When the sandwich was handed to us, I looked at the guy in the cart and with my eyes gently attempted to send the subliminal question, \\"Really???\\"  Hint not taken.  And I, not being a Cackalack Certified Expert thought, \\"OK, maybe it's just dark and not as bad as what I thought.\\"\\n\\nTwo words sum up my Cackalack chicken experience--one bite.  I offered the remainder of the sandwich to my sweetheart who picked through and ate some of the inner chicken.  The majority of the sandwich went into the trash.\\n\\nIn fairness, it was obvious at least half the problem was the fryer oil was old, but I do not for the life of me not understand how the two young men in the cart couldn't recognize such an obvious problem.\\n\\nToday was beautiful and sunny, and brought out the big groups who celebrate coming out of the rain in the first 55 degree weather day of the Portlandic minute-dry season, so there were a lot of people at the pod.  Realizing that every chef can have a bad plate, I watched carefully as three other people who ordered sandwiches receive the same awful chicken.  I personally saw one person picking off the breading in an attempt to down the $8.50 worth of sandwich they just purchased and another person comment on the black exterior.\\n\\nFinally, we read this cart had awesome Cajun fries.  Not this visit.  I've attached a picture of the fries and the standard Zenner hotlink to once again ask why the two young men in the cart can't clearly see the immense amount of burnt food attached to the fries.  Any person in this cart cooking should quickly and easily recognize this is a result of not changing out your fry oil soon enough.  I'm not sure if they use a two fry process or not, or if the oil on the single fry process was simply not hot enough, but the fries were limp and greasy.  I will say the Cajun spice was tasty and placed on good potatoes, it would have been nice.\\n\\nThe chicken sandwich did have a beautiful bun.  The hot dog bun which came with the hot link was clearly days old.  I know the bakery doesn't deliver on Saturday, but this bun was certainly not picked up or delivered before the previous Wednesday.\\n\\nIn fairness, I read the other reviews and believe I should state the owner was not present when any of this food was served.  I saw the comment which stated the food is completely different when the owner is present.  If true, I suggest the owner take note and figure out how to keep quality standards up when he isn't working the cart.\\n\\nIf the owner will answer some of these comments and let us know some issues have been addressed, we would be happy to give Cackalack's another try, as we really believe the business concept is great."},{"name":"New India Cuisine","address":"2304 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Food is great and the owner is very nice and warm.

What usually happens is that the protein and shell sit for minutes because the second person is serving someone else!   Even if the first person has nothing to do after 'serving' you, your order sits and sits and sits until the second person is ready for it.  After adding stuff, the second person passes your order to a third person to add chips -- after a minute or two because that guy is in some long discussion with the first person.  Finally, your order gets passed to a fourth person who checks you out after another long minute or so.

Independent brick and mortar book stores are rare, and this one is lovely- I've always felt at ease spending a long while perusing books and the employees make great recommendations. This review is solely based on the recent addition of the upstairs cafe.\\n\\nIn the past the cafe was a great spot to grab breakfast at any hour, or a fresh juice, or even a beer. It was wonderful when I worked in the neighborhood and would have a hankering for eggs for supper. The food was always reliably good (not great, but hit the spot) and the service was fine (a little aloof sometimes but attentive). However, since the addition of the upstairs cafe all bets are off with dining at Trident. I have been seated (I use the term loosely because no one pays any attention to you when you arrive) upstairs four times during variously busy and quiet moments. Twice I've sat at the bar and twice at a table (once with my husband, all other times on my own). It is like pulling teeth to get the uber-hipster servers that populate the cafe to acknowledge you for seating, or to order. And forget having a server swing by to make sure you have everything...like a fork...or the food you actually ordered...or a refill on coffee. Mind you I've experienced this level of inattention during quiet, late afternoon moments sitting at the bar, two feet from a server who refuses to make eye contact or respond to a polite \\"excuse me, could I please have a fork for my eggs?\\". \\n\\nI had been avoiding Trident for a few months since I can get comparable/better afternoon breakfast elsewhere minus the \\"too cool to actually help a customer\\" attitude but a friend from out of town was visiting and remembered the place fondly enough that I caved and said \\"sure, why not\\". We sat downstairs and had a kind an attentive server, decent enough food and a timely check delivery. So all I can say is if you're going to eat at Trident, don't even think about sitting upstairs.

We care about how many gluten-free options the restaurant has and how helpful the staff is in dealing with our concerns.\\n\\nGluten-Free Options: Things that are already naturally gluten-free on the menu: egg dishes, some salads, and burgers without the bun.\\n\\nTotal From A to Z: 3 Stars\\n\\nA's Review: * * *\\nI find one thing particularly frustrating about the Walnut Cafe and its sister outfit the South Side Walnut Cafe. Both of these are neighborhood favorites and are almost always packed. This is not an easy task here in Boulder, but the formula they use is a good one: make lots of good food at a reasonable price while still offering many options for various dietary needs, like light/low calorie meals or vegetarian and vegan options. What is frustrating to me is that adding gluten-free options to that list of accommodations would not be terribly difficult. GF pancake mix, GF pie/quiche crust, and GF hamburger buns are all easily obtained, and many from local sources or bakers. I understand that there might be a cost premium associated with offering such options, but I don't think people would mind. The food at Walnut Cafe is very tasty and the staff is great. They've taken so many extra steps to help so many people find hearty, healthy, satisfying breakfasts and lunches...why not this one?\\n\\nZ's Review: * * *\\nBoth of the Walnut Cafes have a wonderful, local Boulder feel. There's local art hanging on the walls, the service is always super friendly, and they have a full coffee bar that's way better than Starbucks! Like any breakfast/lunch joint, there are naturally gluten-free selections already on the menu. This primarily includes egg dishes, some salads, and burgers without the bun. And, in my experience, the staff have been very helpful in assisting me with my order. However, I still have to admit to being slightly disappointed. The Walnut Cafes are extremely accommodating to other types of dietary restrictions. You can order soy cheese, tofu, tempah, garden burgers, or vegan sausage. You can even substitute free range eggs if you want to! But when it comes to being gluten-free, the menu is just not accommodating at all. For example, each breakfast meal comes with two sides, and there is a big list of sides, but the only gluten-free sides are fruit or grits. I ended up ordering fruit and fruit with my eggs! It seems to me that a place that is willing to carry tempah, soy cheese, and vegan sausage could at least throw in some gluten-free pancakes! Or maybe a crustless or GF quiche?"},{"name":"Mozart's Coffee Roasters","address":"3825 Lake Austin Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I probably just ordered the wrong thing but their chocolate caramel tart is disgusting.

Second, the staff is incredibly friendly and you can tell everyone there is passionate about food and the mission of the cafe.\\n\\nWe started with a \\"Longevity cappucino\\" ($5) which is made with mushrooms and unsweetened almond milk. It sounds weird, but was delicious and warming on a chilly day. We asked them to leave off the maple syrup they normally add, so it wasn't too sweet. \\n\\nFor our mains we had the gluten-free flatbread of the day ($14), a side of sunflower seed cheese ($3) and a \\"Green Plate\\" ($14) which is served until noon.\\n\\nThe flatbread was tasty but didn't wow me. It's a savory pizza-like thing on a soft \\"bread\\" made of cauliflower, kale and some type of base grain (quinoa?). I think it would have been better with sauteed mushrooms.\\n\\nThe Green Plate consists of a piece of quiche, some toast, and homemade apple sausage. Not many restaurants in Vancouver make their own vegan sausages, so I was impressed by this. I liked the taste of everything on the dish, but both the quiche and the sausage could have been firmer.\\n\\nLastly, we had a chocolate tort for dessert ($8). The taste of avocado in the mousse came through a bit too strongly, and the crust was too hard, but I liked the concept and it tasted good.\\n\\nTip: try to get a seat away from the automated sliding front door, which lets in a ton of cold air every time it opens and closes.

A lot of places offer flavor shots but they're usually these dinky little drops of flavoring that I don't notice until the last bitter, sugar sweetened cup. I ordered a pepper mint flavor shot in my coffee at the Red Line (which is only an additional 50 cents) and when I sipped it... wow. I did not need to use a single grain of sugar and I wouldn't have even needed the milk. Usually I only add milk to coffee when I need to drink it in a very short amount of time and I need it to be a teensy bit cooler.

Why is this fact important?  Because this was the first place that made say \\"This is THE best Texas BBQ I've ever had!\\"\\n\\nNow I'm no Texan, and I know the list of top BBQ joints across the state is a sacred ranking and can result in a long debate depending on who you're talking to, but The Salt Lick always seems to make its way into people's top 5, even amidst fierce competition like the near-by, more urban Franklin's BBQ.  While I have yet to visit the latter of the two, if you aren't up for waking up at 8am to brave the 3-hour long line amongst the company of Austin's entire hipster population (typical of a day at Franklin's), here are 5 reasons why The Salt Lick is my current king of Texas BBQ:\\n\\n1.) Texas Hill Country - Yeah, it may be a 25 minute drive from Austin, but if you're a city-slicker that hasn't had the time to do the Hill Country justice, this is a great way to get a preview of \\"God's Country.\\"  Whether you're taking a detour from SXSW or wrapping up a day exploring the state parks all around it, Driftwood TX just seems more fitting for a sprawling BBQ palace than a small building nestled between skyscrapers.\\n\\n2.) BYOB, and the hour-long wait done right! - I've gone in the winter and I've gone on summer holiday weekends, and unless you're there for a private party, you're waiting for a table!  But never fear!  If you come prepared, you're set!  The Salt Lick is a BYOB establishment, so if you arrive with a sixer of Texas microbrews (or an ample amount of your beverage of choice), a deck of cards, and some good friends, that hour is going to fly by.\\n\\n3.) The Open Pit - Whether you're on Yelp of Google and you've searched for \\"The Salt Lick,\\" the first thing you've probably seen is pictures of their famous open pit.  And rightfully so...when I walked in for the first time and saw that thing covered in brisket, turkeys, ribs, and sausage hanging from the hooks above it, I had already convinced myself that the food was going to be perfect.\\n\\n4.) The \\"Thurman's Choice\\" - I haven't had a meat I didn't like at The Salt Lick, and the Thurman's Choice plate is the best sampling of their signature meats: brisket, ribs, and sausage, complete with sides of beans, slaw, and potato salad.  For those with a bit more room in their stomach, go for The Rancher, which gives you everything Thurman has to offer, plus turkey.\\n\\n5.) Speedy service to make up for anyone still upset about #2! - So you waited in line for an hour, and your one friend that forgot to bring his booze is still a bit ornery about the wait time.  After you tell him or her to \\"can it!\\" you'll be pleasantly surprised to see that your food is already out in front of you.  Regardless of the crowd, I've always experienced speedy service here, and when you're craving some BBQ, that might be one of the most important things of all."},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Very good fish & chips Crispy not greasy and delicious.

I know that Red Lentil just opened, but I feel that the first few weeks are the most important and if they don't have it right by now, I'm not sure if they'll ever get it. I have high standards for vegetarian/ vegan fare and don't think anyone else should expect less just because there aren't many restaurants that serve exclusively vegetarian in the greater Boston area. \\n\\nWhen you walk into the Red Lentil, you are greeted all at once by chaos and less than enchanting decor. There was no wait because I called and made a reservation. The hostess stand is awkwardly placed next to the door and didn't provide enough space to stand. There was a small crowd in the front waiting to be seated, while a frazzled waitress/ server/ busser tried playing the role of hostess as she held dirty plates in her hands. The two person staff wore frightened expressions on their face and they frantically rushed around the dining area with a lack of direction or purpose.\\n\\nAfter we were seated, it took some time to get a glass of water. No ice? Maybe it's a Euro thing. My companion and I ordered an appetizer to share and two entrees. The menu seemed innovative enough, with dishes that grabbed my interest by the descriptions, like the Beet-Potato Latkes or the Near East Seitan with Teff Crepe. I was impressed by the selection of vegan and even gluten free options.\\n\\nWe finally got our appetizer-the Gobi Manchurian, after what seemed like a longer than usual wait. The waitress/ server/ busser forgot to give us napkins and utensils so we starred at the plate while she fumbled in the kitchen. This dish was undoubtedly the best thing that we ordered and that wasn't saying much. The cauliflower was smothered in a reddish sauce that tasted like a spicy marinara out of the jar. Granted the dish was fried, it was still greasier than necessary. The batter that covered the cauliflower was not crisp, but unpleasantly chewy. This appetizer was some sort of Indian incarnation that was poorly executed. \\n\\nOur entrees finally came forty five minutes after we were seated and after first bite I understood that all the time we spent waiting wasn't worth it. I ordered the Butternut Squash Polenta and my companion ordered the Millet Loaf with Local Farm Seasonal Vegetables. It seemed as though the chef spend entirely too much time focusing on the presentation instead of what it actually tasted like. The plates were heavily decorated with so much \\"sauce\\" that it soaked ever morsel of food. Both dishes were very forgettable and tasted like three day old left overs. They had almost identical flavors, except the Butternut Squash Polenta had so much rosemary that it made every bite bitter. The millet loaf was drowned in a red tomato-like sauce that screamed canned tomatoes, mixed with an unnecessary amount of sugar. Both were a mush fest with severely overcooked vegetables along side undercooked ones. The vegetables were far from organic tasting and overpowered by too many spices. \\n\\nThe Red Lentil left me with a bad taste in my mouth. After all, a highly unimpressionable meal, with dishes that only sound good through the descriptions on the menu, not to mention overpriced."},{"name":"New India Cuisine","address":"2304 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Fabulous food cooked to order.

After 20 minutes we started to wonder what was taking him so long.

After eating the whole bowl of free chips and salsa he finally came back and took our orders. Now it is 35 minutes from when we arrived. We ordered the 3course of the prix fixe menu and the waiter did not write down our order, I guess he felt memorizing would be faster. We both watched as he went to another table without putting our orders in the computer first. I laughed thinking \\"I hope he puts the orders in or we'll be waiting forever\\". After another 5 minutes of watching our waiter he still did not put our orders in. I took it upon myself to ask why, I went over to the hostess and told her \\"I don't think our orders are in, can you make sure they are\\". She checked and saw them in the computer.

Its name is derived from the Chinese immigrants who crossed the Straits of Malacca to colonize Singapore. Their descendents became known as Straits Chinese.  This Southeast Asian country is a crossroads to many diverse cultures and its people are most proud of their culinary heritage.  A blend of Malaysian/ Indonesian dishes dominated by pungent spices and herbs that cross influences with Indian curries mixed with the Chinese philosophy of opposite flavors-fire and water.  At Straits Atlanta, it's all about these bold aromatic-intoxicating flavors that grace the recipes to create unique foods of passion for the body and soul.\\n\\nWhat started as a real estate investment of the defunct restaurant Spice, Ludacris and Chef Yeo created a glitzy sexy place to hang out and be seen.  The extensive hypnotic drink list is managed by mixologist Ferdinand Garrido who creates some incredible potions.  The smooth drinking, Redhead in Bed (Kettle One citron vodka, muddled strawberries and Pacific Rim Riesling) is absolutely delicious. \\"What up... Hey baby I got the potion, take a sip of this and put your back in motion.\\" Equally alluring is the refreshing Lemongrass Mojito, this elixir's flavors match nicely with the Singaporean foods.\\n\\nAt the helm of the kitchen is Chef Chris Espa√±ol who brings life and flair to the multi-cultured imaginative menu. Each dish is prepared in a communal sharing style, but at times it's hard to share, they are that good.  For starters, the spicy Kung Pao Chicken lollipops, is to die for- chicken drumettes laced with crushed peanuts and red jalapeno flakes.  At the other end of the spectrum is the delicate Tuna Tower; a mound of Ahi Sashimi served with aromatic kaffir lime leaves, pickled shallots, and wonton chips.  Murtabak, a Malaysian snack, is Roti Prata (grilled flatbread) stuffed with a savory minced beef.  And if any of these don't make you drool, there is the Tamarind Shrimp, grilled large white prawns drizzled with citrusy calamansi juice and served with a tamarind kumquat sauce.\\n\\nAs for the noodles and rice, there is Shrimp Pad Thai made with palm sugar and garlic, the wok fried Garlic Noodles, and Nasi Goreng with shrimp- spicy fried coconut rice, all are tasty staples.  Chicken a main ingredient in many Singaporean recipes is showcased in the Potong Kari Ayam, a traditional dish simmered in yellow curry with potatoes and carrots, and the delectable Spicy Basil Chicken. Here the chicken thighs are melt in your mouth tender and is cooked with shitake mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and Thai basil- the depth of flavors are simply fantastic, don't miss it.\\n\\nBut the real treats on the extensive menu are the Tamarind Beef- tender filet mignon cubes accented with sweet potato hush puppies and brussel sprouts in a black pepper oyster sauce, and the Short Rib Rendang. The exotically flavored tender, moist beef short ribs are braised for 3 hours and are served with saut√©ed spinach and black eye peas.  These outrageous dishes are OMG good.   If your emotions call for some vegatables, try the Bijang, sweet and tangy Chinese eggplant or the ladyfingers sambal-spicy okra.  The unique flavors compliment the exotic subtle flavors of the Singaporean dishes.\\n\\nA great meal should always have a sweet ending and the treats are worthy of a taste.  Consider the sweet potato cr√®me brul√©e with its creamy delicate flavors, or the tropical tasting pineapple bread pudding, but being a pistachio fan, the off-menu pistachio tart with its toasty nutty flavors was a dream come true.  Straits Atlanta is a high-energy dining experience and is the perfect place to share emotions with friends and enjoy flavorful Singaporean cuisine that has a touch of down-home southern pizzazz.\\n\\nLGBTG FRIENDLY ***** (Feel Classy)     \\nFOOD *****        (Tasty Singaporean Treats)   \\nPRICE *****              (Portions to be shared)       \\nAMBIENCE *****     (Happening Spot)     \\nDRINKS *****           (Creative Drinks)     http://www.straitsrestaurants.com"},{"name":"Kappo At East End Market","address":"3201 Corrine Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"5","text":"This place is fantastic!

Also tried two other cold dishes, the tuna crudo and the scallop ceviche, which were both phenomenal. The crudo was extremely simple, which it should be, and had the perfect balance of fat/salt/lime/garlic. The ceviche was delicious, although not as impressive as the crudo, nor the scallop ceviche from Select Oyster Bar.\\n\\nSince I personally do not like cooked fish (only raw everything or cooked shellfish), I ordered the steak. It came out perfectly cooked and seasoned; the meat was very tender and the herb butter was divine. Oh, and it was paired with textbook perfect fries and a small side salad - it was excellent (and cheap). My wife had the Bluefish, which she described as one of the best fish entrees she's ever had. They have a fish of the day, as well, so we'll have to go back so she can try another.\\n\\nRow 34 had a lot of craft beers on tap, but since I wasn't ordering anything fried, I stuck to the wine list - which was affordable, thoughtful, and approachable. Kudos there!\\n\\nIf I could, I would knock this down to a 4.5 star rating, b/c our server was pretty awful. I didn't catch her name - but she was pretty unpleasant.

For my first experience, I tried the chicken cutlet w/ cucumber salad and potato pancakes. For an app, I tried the pierogies. Everything was delicious, except maybe for the pierogies. And really for that, it seemed like the flavor problems encountered were a result of maybe a pan that was too hot. I do enjoy pan fried pierogies because of the crust that creates on the bottom, but maybe it wasn't flash steamed or not long enough. All the same, not a deal breaker. My second experience, I ordered the beef goulash w/ mashed potatoes and potato dumplings. I will say that everything was delicious. My only gripe was that I wish the portion was just a big bigger.

The dish still came out with meat on it! A bit of a miscommunication since she thought we just wanted an extra side dish of meat, but still. \\n\\n- They didn't take our groupon. Apparently you can only use it for dinner. Dumb of me to miss the fine print, but seriously? That's a ridiculous exclusion. We totally wouldn't have gone there without the groupon and I was only interested in brunch b/c of their meat-heavy (and kinda pricey) dinner menu. At least they took the face value of the groupon so it wasn't totally wasted. \\n\\n- The \\"poached\\" eggs on the benedict were hardboiled. Uh guys... really?! I know perfectly poached eggs can be an art, but these were easily overcooked by 2 minutes, which is inexcusable. We had two orders of the benedict at our table and all four eggs has solid yolk centers.\\n\\nOverall fine, but again, not worth it without the groupon I don't think.

Our server was not very pleasant but he was not mean; he just acted as if he did not give a crap about us.  Whatever, we were determined to enjoy ourselves so I ordered French onion soup, a bone-in ribeye medium rare, creamed spinach, and potatoes au gratin.  \\n\\nWe also had cocktails to start and ordered a bottle of wine.  One thing I do not like is when we decide on aperitifs the server automatically assumes we will not drink wine in this condescending manner and takes our glasses away without asking.  I would appreciate it if we were consulted with first.\\n\\nThe soup was too salty and seemed quite average.  The steak itself  was good and buttery but definitely not the best I have ever eaten.  Both sides were a waste of money as they were quite bland and forgettable.  I could only eat less than half my meal but was looking forward to leftovers the next day.  Apparently I was wrong in that line of thinking!  They came to clear our plates and asked if I was finished, which I stated that I was and assumed they would wrap everything up since there was 3/5 of my steak left.  Instead, all that food was just thrown away.  Not only was I indignant that they would waste it but I spent a bit of money on it!\\n\\nWe ended up ordering coffee and dessert, which I cannot even remember what it was at this point because it was so lackluster in flavour.

I had eaten a sandwich and chowdah at Boston Chowda and ice cream at Ben and Jerry's around 6:30-7pm (EDT) but got hungry again \\"late night\\" during my normal California dinnertime hour (7pm PST) when most places were closed. One of the magazines in my hotel room mentioned this gastropub as a cool newish place and Yelp told me it wasn't too far away from my hotel, open late, reasonably priced and walkable, a little over a half mile away. My hungry self was on a mission, through the rain, even bypassing Candy Heaven along the way for real grub. \\n\\nIt was pretty easy to navigate to on foot, and I didn't feel bad about solo dining, dimly lit lofty space, TVs to watch, people at the bar, roomy tables. My server Arty M. was great. Their late night menu is pared down to only include the charcuterie Starters, Salty Pig Parts, Stinky Cheeses and Pizzas (no Pastas or Mains). I asked the waiter how big the pizzas were and if it was enough for one person...basically if I was really hungry I could finish it, otherwise take leftovers to go. Wasn't really an option for me since my hotel room didn't have a fridge/microwave anyway, and I didn't want to waste any delicious food. \\n\\nI chose their signature wood-fired pizza, appropriately named \\"The Salty Pig.\\" It had the daily house-cured salty pig parts (I could definitely taste prosciutto di parma, and smoked prosciutto), arugula, mustard and a pale ale caramel instead of a red or white sauce on top of the crust, and cheese. The menu description alone was intriguing enough to place the order, along with a Diet Coke with just the right amount of caffeine to stave off a potential food coma so I could still be awake to walk back to the hotel. \\n\\nWhen that glorious, perfectly oven-charred flatbread came to the table, it was game on. The sweet caramel with the spicy mustard and the peppery arugula all came together with the salty prosciutto, warm crust and barely melted thinly shredded cheese and was no match for me. Slowly but surely (with no one to dine with and talk to, which meant full concentration on enjoying the meal) I devoured that pie until the wooden tray was all that was left. \\n\\nWhen the check came, it arrived in a little lined journal that other guests had left their mark/commentary in.

I got in line at about 5:50 and waited for close to 1.5hrs before being seated (they don't take reservations). The wait is long but well worth it!

She said she would check on them and then she went the table next to us and engaged in a long conversation about her family with them.  I had to hold back from saying something like could you talk to them later and get my food.  At this point I summoned the manager, I tried to break it to him gently that the service sucked.  He apologized and got us our other three dishes and showered us with free dessert and two extra dishes.  The bill came to about $70 and my friend felt bad for the waitress and tipped her 40% in cash.

I wasn't expecting to get a table very quickly, so I huddled up in the cold outside at one of their outdoor tables with my name on the list (for 6 people).  One of the people that worked there was kind enough to come outside and fire up one of their gas heaters that are strewn about the outdoor seating area for evenings such as this one.  \\n\\nMy wait ended up being about 40 minutes.

What is going on? And did we really drive over 30 min. for this? \\n\\nHowever, the BBQ there is great!!!!!!!  The beef brisket was moist and well seasoned.  The sausage was a little on the bland side, but the texture was perfect and moist.  The turkey was good too.  \\n\\nThe beans were flavorful, the coleslaw wasn't drenched in mayo and was crisp, and the potato salad was good too.  \\n\\nIt was quite a drive out there,  considering we went out there specifically to eat there, (30-40 min. away from Austin), however it was worth it.

Once a year I make a sweep of the steak houses in Boston and throughout the year I visit the excellent ones over and over. Some are excellent once, and then fall down the next time. Some are uniformly disappointing. But in my experience, over the past 10 years, only 2 restaurants consistently deliver perfect steaks. These include Moo and Ruth's Chris. You would think Morton's, the Capital Grille or Grille 23 would be on this list but they are not. Grille 23 gives you the bum rush; Mortons equates quantity with quality and the Capital Grille -- well it comes very close most of the time but for the money it should be perfect all the time. Now I am writing about the food, not the experience, because Ruth's Chris in Old City Hall is snobby and elitist. If they don't think you meet their expectation of what a customer should look like, they put you in a corner where the \\"valued\\" customers don't have to look at you. But the food - especially the steak -- is unparalleled in Boston. It pains me to admit it because Ruth's Chris is a chain, but there it is. The steaks are the best anywhere. Hands down. Period. No question. And that's why I go there. For the steak. The vegetables are ok, not great, but ok. The appetizers are superior but I've had better elsewhere. The desert likewise is superior but I have had better elsewhere. But I have never had better steaks on a more consistent basis than I have had here. The NY Sirloin is perfection itself. I measure any other restaurants attempt at a similar steak against Ruth's Chris. Likewise the filet is good enough for God. Nothing more need be said. If you want experience, then by all means go to the sadly fading Oak Room. If you want the whole meal to be \\"good\\", then go to Capital Grille. But if you want the perfect steak, the steak you will remember in a year, then you can only go to Ruth's Chris."},{"name":"Little Bangkok","address":"2225 Cheshire Bridge Rd Ne","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Came here to eat, but didn't get a chance to try the food because they have a $12 minimum to charge a card.

The place has a bright, lively atmosphere - I can't imagine not being in good spirits after dining here! Well, maybe if we visited when the tiny little spot is crowded (during typical dinner hours, almost every night of the week) and had to wait ages for a table our happy mood might have some dampers on it.\\n\\nBut we've always managed to visit before or after the biggest crowds - and their kitchen is open 'til midnight Friday & Saturday, so it's a good spot for a late-ish dinner or just cafe con leche and dessert!\\n\\nIt's a little tough to eat \\"cheap\\" here - the Cuban Pressed Sandwiches (avg price $8-10) only save you a few bucks from the price of the dinner plates. As far as the entrees go (most seem to run $10-15), I've thoroughly enjoyed each one I've tried! The Pollo Criollo is basically a quarter of a chicken, in tasty spices. The Vaca Frita is like a Cuban beef version of pulled pork - all juicy and shreddy with lots of salty-garlicky good flavor.\\n\\nThey have a variety of sides that are all pretty tasty - my favorite is the borderline un-PC Moros y Christianos (black beans & white rice - with chunks of bacon). The cabbage slaw is fresh and compliments most dishes well - and it's the non-creamy kind, which makes me and My Lady very happy! The tostones (fried plantains) are nice, but they seem to be fried a little too hard and almost always turn out crunchier than I'd prefer.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the Maduros (sweet, sticky fried plantains) were tender and tasty, but more of a desert. If they could prepare the tostones to the same texture as the Maduros I'd be in heaven! Pambiche is also a great place for dessert - lots of delicious pastries and cakes, oh so tempting!\\n\\nI've only been here a handful of times, and have never tried the empanadas, but they're on my list! It's also a worthy breakfast destination (7-days a week), and from 7-8am it's 2-for-1 breakfast entrees!\\n\\nAll in all a fun, lively spot! If you're passing by and you see a table open grab it.

Beware pulling all the cheese of the pizza in one bite because that will happen.\\n   What i love about this place is the variety of Greek, American, Italian, and Mexican food. The menu has alot of a variety in items ranging from tacos,burritos, ribs, baklava etc. Subs from here are preety good and the meat ball sub is giant. The food is decent but nothing special. The service is a little slow because this place gets alot of delivery business. The interior is very tiny so you'll probably want to take your food to go. If you're looking for a safe pizza place with a variety of items to try this is the place for you just dont expect to be \\"WOW'd\\""},{"name":"Surly Girl Saloon","address":"1126 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"The Surly Girl is in my top 5 joints for lunch in C-Bus, and a very cool place to hang for happy hour.

Me and whatever friends I am with just go nuts on oysters, shrimp, fish and chips, and drinks. \\n\\nThere is usually a wait, both times have been about 45 minutes, so we just hang at City Tap House while we wait. But they call you when your table is ready. They have a huge selection of oysters and we like to get as many as possible. I prefer the smaller, sweeter oysters over the huge meaty ones. I just wish they served a mignionette instead of just the sauces they come with, but that's a small complaint. The fish and chips are the best I have had in Boston. So crispy and the fish is fresh and flaky. \\n\\nThe beer list is pretty good, and the waiter knew the details on all of them. I asked what IPAs they had and he knew right away. He suggested an unfiltered New England style IPA which was very good. He brought my friend a sample of one of the red wines, which was cool. She liked it and got a nice sized pour.\\n\\nAgain, we get in trouble here. Our bill came out to about $200 (ouch), especially since my friends were from out of town and I wanted to treat them.

Is this the most authentic Japanese food in Atlanta?  A) I wouldn't know, and B) almost certainly not.  That said?  While it isn't the most authentic, and probably isn't the best either, it's really good and satisfying, the servers/staff are very friendly & good.  From the hostess to the servers to the hibachi chefs - all were very welcoming, friendly without being pushy or intrusive, and a professional.  \\n\\nSo - the food.  We started with a mix of sushi, and they were quite good across the board.  Best ever, no, but very solid.  If you weren't in Atlanta for Soto's, I'm sorry.  This isn't nearly that good, but you won't be unhappy at all.  The other really nice thing is that they were willing to tinker and accomodate both my pregnant wife (no raw fish eggs) and my gluten-intolerant father-in-law (wheat-free tamari).  No pushback at all, and came to ask follow-up clarification questions to make sure all was right with those needs.  I particularly enjoyed the white kelp roll, and my wife swears these are consistently the best (\\"ripest\\") avocado rolls in the city. \\n\\nThe pork dumplings were also quite good, although I like a little more sear on the bottom to add a little more color, texture, taste.  \\n\\nSo - the hibachi (dinner theater of the best kind).  A young chef, who'd been warned about gluten issues,  was very careful to separately prepare the noodles and avoid using soy sauce with wheat.  There's a $2.50 charge for fried rice - TOTALLY WORTH it.  Quite garlicy, and very good.  Good, not great, steak, chicken, scallops & shrimp - totally solid, and worth the price of admission.  \\n\\nThis was a real step up from chain competitors (yes, there are a couple of other Nakatos in other cities), and a fun experience.

You can choose to wait for a table inside or take one of the outside tables (under heaters) which accommodate another 18 people.   \\n\\nThe menu is filled with generous portions entrees of stewed meats and seafood, rices, and beans, each comes with an assortment of delicious sides, like fried plantains, red cabbage slaw, or avocado salad, as well as sandwiches and empanadas.  Not your traditional Mexican fare, mind you.  Vegetarians are a bit more limited, but not overlooked, veggie empanadas are available.\\n\\nThe wait staff, while busy, has always been personable and accommodating.  I highly recommend checking out their happy hour, which features tasters of their entrees at really reasonable prices."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"What a bomb place.

Sure, you should expect to wait, but for food this damn good it's more than worth it.

More like in a quandary . . . I'm not sure what all the hubub is about. I want to rate this place higher, but the breakfasts, lunches, and pickles, just don't do it for me.\\n\\nFor starters, the pickles are gross. They're the super-duper electric-green ones (like jarred Vlassics) that just aren't worth the effort--or the garlic breath. (And I love pickles!)\\n\\nThe sandwiches I've had have only been so-so. A turkey one with cream cheese and sundried tomatoes, and a veggie wrap. My spanish omelet with breakfast potatoes and rye toast was okay. (For the record, I despise that fluffy food service version of rye bread. Rye should be thin, oblong, and 100% crunchy when toasted.) The potatoes weren't particularly flavorful. Some onions and a little bit of butter would have done them some good.\\n\\nThe people who work here are very friendly and the service is super-fast. Props for that. And their chocolate chip cookies and bakery muffins are lovely. (The muffins are made with yogurt to keep them extra moist; however, they're not made in-house.) And the muffins come in a variety of interesting flavors. (Good to know that I can get them grilled. Grilled corn muffins are nirvana!)\\n\\nThe specials sounded interesting (a salad w/ bing cherries, as well as coconut-banana pancakes)--perhaps that's where it's at.

Went today (2 pm) to celebrate my birthday with 9 family members.  A brief wait to be seated, and then the long wait began.  After my entire party arrived, we asked for a high chair for the little one, and that took a while.  No kids menu or crayons, as I noticed at another table.  My son went up to the hostess area and got the menu and crayons for his daughter.  After finally getting our drink orders taken, we evetually had one basket of chips and salsa brought to the table. Getting hungrier, we kept looking around for our server to place our appetizer orders.  When she arrived with the drinks, she also brought my sister's appetizer order, which we did not know she had placed.  She said she ordered it with her drink.  Why wouldn't the server ask if anyone else was having an appetizer since my sister was ordering one?  So then we waited more time while she took the appetizer and the entr√©e orders at the same time.  More waiting.....then another basket of chips and salsa came to the table.  Finally STARTED getting appetizers, not all, but two or three at a time....more waiting, then entrees started coming, and my nephew had not received his appetizer yet.  Server said it was coming.  I noticed people at other tables were also not happy with the slow service.  \\n\\nIt seemed as though there were only two or three servers working and they were working in slow speed.   My son asked twice for a refill on his strawberry lemonade and some steak sauce before it was brought out.  Server refilled all drinks one time, but never asked did we need anything else.  My sister asked for more napkins and that took a minute to get.  \\n\\nMy nieces wanted dessert and we decided against it based on wait times.  When we asked for the checks, my nephew also requested a drink refill.  My sister had paid for her group, my son had paid for his family, and we were still waiting on that refill, so I asked for it in a to go cup, and as we were standing up to leave, server brought the drink.  \\n\\nSlowest service ever, and with no personality or friendliness about her.  She never even gave us her name.  \\n\\nSeems like the skillet queso used to be better as well.  Overall, food was good.  But the customer service was horrible.

If you're looking for a nice place to enjoy good food and good conversation with loved ones, while relaxing and enjoying your meal, perhaps choose somewhere else. Maybe the time waiting for a table and the thrill of watching the staff serve you and kick you out in under 20 minutes is the experience you're looking for...for me, I'd rather be sitting, chatting and enjoying my meal...that way I actually have the time to decide how great it is.

During the class, the restaurant owner talked about his personal philosophy and his reasoning behind getting fresh meat, etc., which was interesting. We then got to try to cut the chicken on our own, and to my surprise, we got to take the chicken home! Doesn't even stop there - we got complimentary gift bags (with a small cutting board and an apron) AND we got a 3 course meal. The 3 course meal included salad with arugula, wrapped chicken with quinoa and beets, and a shortcake with coconut ice cream and raspberries - all of which were absolutely amazing (and tasted healthier because it wasn't too greasy or heavy).

I think this restaurant is franchised, so there's probably a pretty good reason why there seems to be such a difference in the reviews about this location and the one on Guadalupe. I can't speak for the Guadalupe location, but I definitely can speak for the Airport one.\\n\\nI am shocked by the number of good reviews this place has. My opinion is very different. I admit, back in the late 80s and into the 90s, this was one of the best burger joints in town. I don't know what's happened, but on a recent trip the shredded lettuce on their condiment bar had a look and a smell that indicated it was more than several days old.\\n\\nTheir hamburger meat was so heavily seasoned I couldn't taste the beef. They advertise out front that they use USDA Choice beef. There is NO WAY their beef is Choice.\\n\\nThe help was all Asian, spoke little English, was rude and slow to complete orders.\\n\\nIf you want a REALLY good burger in this part of town, go a little closer to I-35 on the other side of the street. The Stallion has much better burgers and some really good blue-plate specials too. A major disappointment at Burger Tex though. I won't be back.\\n\\nBy the way, the crispy coating on the fries that some reviewers say is \\"yummy\\" is really nasty. I usually like seasoned fries (example: Burger House on Spicewood Springs), but Burger Tex's \\"seasoning\\" reminds me of the coating that fries will get on them when they're cooked in oil that been re-used over and over again.

It's about 20 miles outside downtown Austin and well worth the drive to the middle of nowhere. \\n\\nThe setting is truly Texas: a large ranch with mature trees that shaded the numerous picnic tables, live music and lemonade being freshly squeezed out on the patio. Our table of 15 only had to wait about 30 min for a table inside for Sunday lunch. I saw many people order to-go and eat it out on the picnic tables outside. It's also BYOB so you would see a bunch of tables with coolers full of booze, which incidentally makes the wait go by even faster ;) If you forgot your booze, they have The Salt Lick Cellars next door where they sell beer and wine, and also have wine tastings. \\n\\nSince this was a destination for us, my husband wanted to see the smokers. These babies are no joke! The staff is so nice, they let you come around to the back and take pictures and ogle the meat. My mom even asked for a sample and they happily obliged. \\n\\nThe brisket and the ribs are some of the best I have ever tasted.

I'm basically one of those Portland vegans, except replace bacon with fried chicken (and fish and turkey and the occasional piece of cheese if I'm feeling masochistic). It's one of those dishes that everybody knows and loves, yet only 2-3 restaurants in town can really do it right. The Cackalack Shack (say that 3 times fast) is one of those restaurants that really nailed it.\\n\\nI decided to skip the sandwiches because I didn't need any bread holding me back from the magic that lies between the two slices. Instead, I opted for a pile of their chicken tenders with the hot sauce. I have quite an affinity for spicy food, but I decided against their XXX sauce because I really don't like getting sweaty from my food in the company of others. The hot sauce was quite hot and almost made me reach my boiling point, but not quite there. \\n\\nThis place really takes their chicken quite seriously. You don't see many establishments prodding each and every delicious strip with a thermometer in order to make sure that they don't exceed that magical delicious point, but Cackalack's sure does. Honestly, this bit of OCD really shows in the quality of their Draper Valley chicken because it is perfectly moist on the inside and has a fantastic, crispy and flavorful breading. Awesome.\\n\\nFor $6, you get this massive pile of deliciously fried bird, a piece of texas toast and some spicy cajun slaw garnishing the side of the meat pile.

Well my husband had just about finished sipping his beer by the time my smoothie came, and I was terribly disappointed.

It was gross, and I was disappointed, but I drank it out of fear that it would take an astronomically long time to get another one. \\n\\nThe thing that irritated me the most, however, was the fact that the two servers were badmouthing their customers right in front of us.

Maybe a little cracked pepper too? A Fesh peppaaaaa? \\nI ordered the pan seared halibut with the pea risotto. The fish was  cooked nicely but it lacked a citrus element to it. The entire dish did. It came with an lemon aioli sauce which was completely unnecessary. Wished it would have been some sort of lemon sauce or a different sauce not mayo based. The risotto was overloaded with peas it completely drowned out the risotto and sauce. The fish is edible but honestly you will see it lacks finishing elements. \\nThe pasta frutti de mari was very watery! No sauce should be like this.

I must say that it was a pretty good last ditch effort for dinner plans, because I left happy and very full.\\n\\nI was a bit overwhelmed by their menu, simply because there were so many things that I liked. In the end, I ended up getting the fresh summer roll and cucumber salad to share and the panang duck (good amount of duck options... super happy about that). All in all, everything was very delicious. Here's a run down on what I thought about everything:\\n-Fresh summer roll: I'm always a bit conflicted when I order this because I'm allergic to peanuts, so I can't dip into the sauce, but it was still pretty good.\\n-Cucumber salad: the spicy type of vinagrette on this was ahhhmazing. For such a small salad, it packed a lot of punch\\n-Panang Duck: I love the panang curry on it's own, but the fact that there was a boneless duck in it was even better. I think they seared the duck before putting it in the curry because it had a nice crunch on it. The veggies were also cooked, but still had a nice crunch to them. \\n\\nThe only downside- just had to wait pretty long for everything... even when we asked for the bill. It's almost as if the waiters had no sense of urgency at all, but they were very friendly.\\n\\nOverall, I had a pretty good experience here.

For our main course, I had the Enchiladas Mole Poblano, and Hubs had the cochinita gorditas. Everything was beautifully presented and exquisite. The flavor combinations in the mole were the perfect balance of chocolate, poblano and cinnamon. I tried a bite of the tender cochinita, and found its sweetness perfectly balanced by the tangy pico de gallo accompaniment. \\n\\nThe chef came to our table while we were finishing our dessert and asked for feedback and told us a little bit about her background.

First, the positives: The service was fast and friendly. Once we were seated our order was taken quickly and our appetizers came out very fast. The fried calamari was amazing; tender and fresh. We also tried the burrata which was a huge hit with everyone. Now, the negatives: Because they do not take reservations we stood outside in line from 7:30 to 8:47 waiting to be seated. My wife and kids had time to wander the neighborhood and wait in line to buy desert at nearby Mike's Pastry while I stood in line. Unlike the appetizers, the entres were nothing special. Between us we tried the red sauce which lacked much flavor or texture, the scampi sauce which was also bland, and the fra diavolo which had no spice to it at all. The linguini was cooked well, but tasted like store bought pasta.

The appetizer size is not that large, and I give the waitress kudos for letting us know. But here's a suggestion: instead of wolfing down the appetizers, take the time to cut them up into small bits and let them linger on your mouth for a bit. The flavors are excellent. \\n\\nI ordered the Mafe and it was delicious. Could it have used a bit more meat? Yes. Could the rice have been a little less dry? Yes. But overall, this dish is well worth ordering. \\n\\nI was a bit hesitant about going to this place because of some comments about very slow service. I didn't see it. The waitress did a fine job. I should say that there were only 4 other tables with customers, so I'm not sure what happens when the place is full. But as far as my experience, there were no problems. \\n\\nMy friend ordered the Michoui (lamb shanks) and he said it was fantastic. It looked fantastic. \\n\\nI've never had Senegalese food before, but I'll definitely be sure to return there and try the other dishes. \\n\\nAlso, the decor of the place and its convenient location are bonus points. \\n\\nThe only two negatives wer the Latin American music and the volume. Maybe it's my limited understanding of Senegalese culture, but half the time, I felt like I was in a Mexican restaurant. I have excellent hearing and the music was so loud that the only way we could understand one another was to speak much louder than normal. I'm also a big believer that sounds, like smell, affect the taste of the food.

Although I'm a bit delayed in leaving a review, as it's been well over a month, I can still chatter on about the dining experience, itself. \\nMy boyfriend made this reservation for us for my birthday and when we arrived, parking was nearly impossible.  Be advised that you should expect to valet, unless you expect that the parking gods will be aligned with you.  Parking is mostly Resident Only and very difficult.  Don't distract from the awesome experience you're about to embark upon by getting po'd at the lack of parking.  Just valet it.\\nWe waited just under 5 minutes to be seated and once we were, we had plenty of attention, from numerous employees.  They were generous with their time, explanations and almost 'over did it', which would be my only complaint, if I had to have one.  It felt as though they were watching each time I took a sip of the bottled water and rushed over to refill the sip of water I just took, which was a bit disruptive to me.  Attentive, yes.  A bit too frequent, yes.  As I said, though - my only complaint.  \\nI don't recall exactly what I had, so I won't go into the details, but I can say that it was delicious and beautifully presented.  \\nI mentioned, in passing, to the waiter as a photo was being taken that it was my birthday and the waiter took it upon himself to accompany our desserts with a simple candle on a separate plate for me to quietly celebrate with.  Quite nice.\\nWe had a great corner booth (not sure if that was pure luck or the doings of my outstanding boyfriend) and I would highly recommend requesting that seat, if allowed.

See, my husband and his family and I decided to get BBQ for his birthday dinner meal and he'd never had Salt LIck, despite all of the raves he's heard from multiple people, so we settled on trying it out. Everything was fine and dandy, including a pretty polite server and tasty slow-smoked meats, and although the restaurant sent out an expo instead of our original waiter to give us our food (and thus he auctioned off our plates, like \\"4 meat platter?\\" \\"Sausage, turkey, brisket?\\") it was tasty. \\n\\n4:30 this morning I woke up, feeling like death. I threw up A LOT and was all set to blame it on something else, like maybe I had bad spinach? But then my husband started throwing up a few hours later and the timing is too coincidental. One of our other friends who ate with us complained about feeling sick as well.\\n\\nSo, no! I will never eat here again.\\n\\nEDIT: The rest of the group I was with all reported being violently ill. Not all of them brought home leftovers. I can only assume that our difference in body weight and amount of tainted food consumed were the reasons why our vomiting started at different times, and that the original food poisoning actually occurred at the restaurant itself, NOT from eating the leftovers.\\n\\nEDIT AGAIN: I will add another star because within the hour this review went up, the owner contacted me asking me what date and time I ate at this restaurant, to find out what happened. My father-in-law called to explain what happened and received a very apologetic response, a refund, and a credit for 7 dinners, which is really good customer service. The owner is on top of the game. I realize this must be an isolated incident, as Salt Lick has a pretty good reputation, hundreds of loyal diners, and feeds many people every day. That being said, however, what my family and I went through because of this food (the only link between all of us and the awful aftermath) has made me wary of labeling this restaurant anything higher than two stars.

I think part of me wants to find THE fried chicken - the one that will send me over the edge in happiness and tell me that yes, my quest to find the perfect fried chicken was totally worth it. Unfortunately, Double Comfort was not the place for that. However, I am going to give them 4 stars due to other menu items and the fantastic service I experienced.\\n\\nI took my sister here for a dinner date (my sister and I like to eat out a lot, don't judge), and this seemed to be a safe place. My sister isn't necessarily \\"picky\\" per say, but she won't be eating like a Chopped judge anytime soon either. \\n\\nWhile it was a Friday night, the place didn't seem to be too packed. I couldn't tell if it was a good or a bad thing. My thought process was that this place is in the hustle and bustle of N High, so it'd only get busier as the night went on. After all, it was only 6:30PM.\\n\\nAs other reviewers stated, there's quite a wait for things. It took us nearly 10 minutes to be seated. Our \\"waiter\\", Phil, was actually the bar manager pulling double duty. He was definitely hustling and bustling between tables, and he did his best to be as attentive as possible to each and every patron. I wonder if they're naturally understaffed or if someone called off; either way, I still received excellent service.\\n\\nMy sister and I started off with their version of poutine, which was topped with sausage gravy. Let me tell you, I will NEVER turn down some poutine. It's up there with being one of my favorite dishes, and their twist didn't disappoint.\\n\\nWith the poutine being as delicious as it was, I thought I was in for a treat. I ordered the roasted and my sister went for the fried. She ordered a side of mashed potatoes and I went the mac and cheese route. I didn't enjoy my roasted chicken too much; it was overcooked and underseasoned. The mac and cheese though was my jam, and my sister didn't understand why I kept eating it even when I stated I was full. Her fried chicken was the same - a tad overcooked and not seasoned well enough. I also didn't care much for her taters. They were chunky and flavorless.\\n\\nThe real star of the show was Phil. As busy as he was, he gave us a lot of attention. He was especially proud of his vodka, which came in 3 flavors (pineapple, tea, and jalapeno.) Let me tell you, I like my vodka, and the fact that he spent so much time and energy into making some different flavors was very interesting. My favorite was easily the pineapple as I have always disliked tea and the jalapeno flavor made me parched. However, if you like it on the spicy side or if you like tea, you will definitely like those two. \\n\\nAll in all, the menu has some hit and misses. The alcohol selection is great and the atmosphere is awesome, and thanks to Phil I'll probably be back. I'll just order the poutine and mac and cheese and maybe stick to the bar."},{"name":"Barcelona Inman Park","address":"240 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Barcelona has delicious food - It's amazingly delicious. \\n\\nHowever, after my first visit, I've never been back without cash. Ever.  \\n\\nThe first time I ate there, my friends and I all bought rounds of drinks (three of us) while we waited for seats.  This was during Winter 2015 and it was very chilly outside.  It was packed inside, and we learned that they had recently ended a regular DJ set which basically turned the place into a hip night spot, according to the bar server who was drifting around to serve all the folks packed into the bar side.  Nevertheless, folks were jammed in there like they were waiting for showtime at any moment. \\n\\nWe were on round two by the time we were seated on the largely restaurant side, and I was finishing up a delicious hot toddy brandy drink (my second), but no one minded, as the ambiance was very nice. \\n\\nWe had an amazing dinner, including sliced cheeses, olives, duck, strip steak (mouth is watering) and a lot more on wa-a-a-a-a-y too many small plates, which is the specialty there. \\n\\nThat next morning, everybody's cards had fraudulent charges.  \\n\\nI had only given my card to the server who was drifting around in the bar, as I did not pay for dinner, and before I left the restaurant, someone had gone shopping online at a floral shop and few other places. Really? I'm eating and you're shopping? \\n\\nAll three of us had to deal with our credit card companies to get the matter rectified.\\n\\nBecause the restaurant was my suggestion, I was extremely embarrassed and felt personally responsible. \\n\\nSince then, I've come back this place at least three times to enjoy the delicious food.  I have also hosted a beloved family member who traveled from far away, along with a good client, at this restaurant. (Actually, at the last such dinner, the paella was not good at all. It was greasy and the rice was oddly burnt and still undercooked - It had been cooked too quickly, and we'd waited forever.), \\n\\nHowever, I never, ever, ever, use credit at this restaurant, and that can be very inconvenient Like, we literally have to stop for cash before going there, cause it's not worth the risk. I also have to find a delicate way to mention it to anyone I speak to about the restaurant (I will admit to loving it if asked, but never recommend anyone go there without direct prompting), because I feel guilty suggesting a place that may rip someone off. \\n\\nLike: \\"Oh, yea, the food is ama-a-a-zing, but I wouldn't let my credit card out of my sight there...just sayin. Use cash,\\" which is just sad.\\n\\nAs a result of these inconveniences, I never go to Barcelona on a whim, and I am always inconvenienced. I wanted to have a group event there, but then quickly remembered that's not cool for my guests.  \\n\\nI haven't written this place off, but I also can't argue that the food and the generally very good service somehow corrects what I experienced. Too bad, as this rating should be a 4-star, at least.   \\n\\nSo: Food is delicious, drinks are insane, paella was a challenge, and enjoy yourself with CASH ONLY."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Sitting here right now.

They have a great location, right on the lake. They have ample space to sit, inside and outside. There is often live music. Most of all, the atmosphere is great for whatever your purpose... studying, dating, watching the sunset, etc etc.\\n\\nOnly problem is.... they know it. Like Eva Mendes knows she's hot. So their prices are ridiculous, and their policies alike. For instance, the \\"Moccachino\\" seems to be nothing more than a powder mixed with water in a pitcher. But it'll cost you nearly $5 a glass. Today I asked for it without ice (being that it's already cold, and I usually end up with a big cup of ice). So they complied, sort of... they only filled the glass 3/4 of the way full. For $2, that's annoying. For $5, that's ridiculous.\\n\\n[update]\\nUpgraded to 4 stars just 'cause I go here so much that I really cant justify only giving it 3 stars. I no longer order the pre-mixed not-much-more-than-chocolate-milk Moccachino. Instead, I get an \\"Iced Mocha Special\\" (though not on the menu).

So, we called for a reservation and they were all booked up, but they suggested we come in and try their waitlist, which we did.  The wait was only 40 mins.  So, in the meantime we went to the bar and put our names on the waitlist for the bar and while waiting for the bar, we stood at one of their many \\"high-tops\\" which are really just these cool shelves on the sides of posts.  We were quickly approached by a bartender and we asked about a couple of wines.  She brought out these two wines for us to try and we really liked what they provided, so we selected a bottle of one.\\n\\nWhile waiting for our table, our bar spot came available and we decided to sit at the bar and take our name of the table list.  This was a GREAT decision as we got to talk to the bartenders and chefs, even though they were really busy.  They were all very friendly and really happy to tell us all about the incredible food this amazing restaurant offers.\\n\\nTheir menu is very unique and AMAZING!  They have a very nice raw bar menu, including some really mouthwatering ceviches!  We chose the scallop with orange juice and it was unbelievable!

We also ordered shrimp cocktail and that was very fresh, large and very nicely done!\\n\\nFor our entr√©e, we ordered the monk fish, but they were out of monk fish and sub'd it with hake instead.  This was probably one of the best-prepared fish dishes I've ever eaten!  The gribiche sauce was outstanding!  The freshness of the fish and preparation was unbelievable!

The first time we went the service was SO UNORGANIZED. When we didn't need any help we had a different person literally every 30 seconds asking us how it was going. Then, when we actually needed something, there was no one in sight. We waited so long for drink refills that we had actually already finished our food before someone finally came by to see if we needed anything. \\n\\nTHEN there's the prices. This place doesn't even compare to the MANY other mexican restaurants in the area. Way overpriced and....You have to PAY FOR EXTRA CHIPS! I have literally never been to a mexican restaurant that charged you for more chips. I ordered a margarita which was expensive, but I thought maybe it was just really good? I don't mind paying more for quality. NOPE! Terrible. Tasted like something they poured out of one of those premixed dispensers. That's not even the kicker...you have to ASK and PAY MORE for what they called \\"top shelf\\" tequila. I can go to El Vaquero and get a margarita with patron silver AND pay a couple bucks less and it will be amazing. \\n\\nSo after my first trip there I vowed never to return, BUT alas my book club was scheduled to meet up there. It was a disaster. Took an incredibly long time to get our food, they completely screwed up one of the girls orders. It took her an extra 20 minutes to get hers and they didn't even apologize. Didn't offer her anything for the inconvenience. We asked to speak to a manager, and some young girl comes around to \\"take care of it\\". Taking care of it was taking $3 off her total and acting like she was inconvenienced by having to actually take care of a customer. \\n\\nFinally, the food.

The coals completely died out & we sat there for 20 mins before one of the servers finally came up. He changed the coals out and I asked for the check, after telling him that we hadn't been checked on at all since we got the hookah. His reply was a sarcastic \\"no one checked on you at all? Nah\\".

It's a small cafe located inside of a bookstore, and it seems like they sell actual food all day. Not just coffee and pastries.\\n\\nI forget what I ordered, but I wouldn't recommend it anyways. It was a scramble that came with chicken-apple sausage. And holy crap, it was the worst sausage I ever tasted! It was so dry and bland, I couldn't believe it was even meat. I added a ton of salt and hot sauce, and still couldn't get the disgusting taste out of my mouth. I ended up just leaving it and eating some of my coworker's breakfasts since the portions were so big anyways. The stuffed pancakes with bananas were pretty gross too. It had some kind of cream cheese-based sauce. But it had a weird aftertaste that didn't go well with the bananas. The best dish I tried was this bowl full of meat, cheese, and hashbrowns, I forget what it was called though. Anyways, the server was pretty nice to us even though we had a bunch of requirements, such as separate itemized receipts for everyone, and paying with 7 different cards.

So that was disappointing especially since I asked our waiter if it was hot chicken....he apparently doesn't know what hot chicken is. The upside to that sandwich was I ordered the orzo salad which was light and fresh which was a perfect side to such a heavy sandwich. If you go get the orzo! My husband and dad had the heavy weight and they shared it. They enjoyed it ok but my husband said the food was nothing to write home about and he wouldn't go back. The smashed potatoes or whatever were mediocre as well. We definitely wouldn't go back for food. The server was really nice but said he was super busy and crazy...which is weird seeing as it was a Sunday night and the place was almost completely empty. We had to ask another waiter for our bill and to take the payment because ours disappeared. The server that took our bill definitely looked annoyed which led me to believe that our server was often missing and this guy had to cover his tables. My dad said at one time he was pretty sure he saw our server watching the game at the bar...real busy. Anyway if you wanna go for drinks I'm sure it's a great place.

The room was small but clean.  I wish they offered some bath slippers, but like I said, you get what you pay for.  Turn down service was great and they left us 2 bottles of water each night.  The shower was a little old and the lighting was horrible once you closed the shower curtain, but like I said, you get what you pay for.  The location was central to every where we needed to go, and it was conveniently located a few miles away from South Congress Avenue.  The only problem was almost every other street seems to be a 1 way street and you have to go a few miles out of the way just to get home.  However, parking was ample and free and the staff was super friendly.  The elevators were a bit slow but we were on the 2nd floor so we would just walk up to our floor.

If we had actually received our 2 sandwiches (corned-beef reuben, and a philly w/o mushrooms) today, I would have a review based on the food I received. Instead, I am writing this review about the food I never received. After waiting 20 minutes, and watching about 18 people receive their sandwiches, we decided we would leave, and told the guy behind the counter that they can cancel our order. I was told our food was just coming up. But, in my opinion, it was too long to wait for 2 HOT sandwiches, one of which just possibly sat on the counter for 20 minutes. We left... WHILE THE STAFF BERATED US; yelling \\"have a great day!\\" over and over until the door was completely closed.\\n  Was it our fault that the staff didn't keep focused? Was it our fault 18 people received their sandwiches before us? The answer is NO. Yet the staff made us feel that we should just stand around until they remembered what we ordered and decided to make it.  I was asked 4 times what I had ordered. When I was asked the first time about my reuben, I saw the guy make it right there on the counter. It looked like it was going to be exactly like the sandwiches I would get while growing up in Philly and Jersey. I was excited! But then the philly became the misfire in what appeared to be a well oiled machine. The philly sandwich just never came to be... not until we had made the decision to go. Just not sure how much longer they crew at Reubens though we should wait around for them to make us 2 sandwiches. We had the day off, so we were not in work attire. I guess they realize most of their patrons have about 30 minutes for their lunch break, so maybe thats why they catered to the \\"better dressed\\" patrons.

I enjoyed my dining experience here. \\n\\nThe menus are fairly simple and quite interesting, with a variety of beers, wines, and distinct cocktails. We sampled some of each of these, including their sangria (their traditional sangria is a little less sweet and fruity; the mango sangria is quite a bit sweeter). The cocktails have combinations of muddled fruits and spices. They were, unfortunately, out of several types of liquor and wine this evening, but each time we were informed of something not on the menu, an equally interesting alternate was offered.\\n\\nWe tried a little bit of everything for the appetizers too. The brochettes de crevettes (grilled shrimp with a sriricha sauce) were my favorites with the vegetarian nems a close second, with a rich cumin flavor. The lunch menu seems to offer a few more vegetarian selections than the dinner menu does. My dinner entree, the mafe (lamb stew) promised lamb falling off the bone - it did, which also implies some bones will be in the stew. It also contained white and sweet potatoes, carrots, and cabbage in a spicy peanut sauce - remember Senegal is equatorial, which means typically spicy food. There was enough extra sauce to garnish my side of jasmine rice. My dining companions were equally satisfied with their meals.\\n\\nThey were, again, unfortunately out of a few of their dessert offerings, which tonight included some of their cocoa based cocktails. I instead tried some Senegalese coffee. It was perhaps the strongest coffee I have ever had - even stronger than Turkish - with a deep, rich, earthy aroma and taste, stronger than other African coffees I have tried. \\n\\nThe staff here are wonderful, they make you feel so at home as they interact with you while taking and delivering your order. I almost wish we could have pulled up 2 additional chairs and asked them to join us.

For a complimentary dish when you sit down they bring out soda bread with a olive oil and Guinness reduction dipping sauce. It was a bit sweet and I liked it! \\n\\nOur dining plan had an app, entree, and dessert covered for each person so I went with the Irish smoked salmon served with capers, shallots & cr√®me fraiche and my fella had the garlic & chili lemon butter shrimp. Both were awesome. For entree, I had the fish and chips and my fella had the shepherd's pie. The fish and chips were also great and very filling. The shepherd's pie was a bit non traditional in that it wasn't served in a crock or anything but rather it was built in a ring form which allowed it to stand alone. Pretty cool presentation since you could see all the layers. That dish was also quite tasty. \\n\\nWe were both stuffed from our meals but since the meal plan included dessert we soldiered on. We got the Bread & Butter Pudding to split off my meal and a cookie to go off of his. This bread pudding you guys....it's really really good. Very rich (they don't call it BUTTER pudding for nothin') and served with a vanilla sauce and caramel on the side. The caramel alone was so good I could have sipped on the ramekin by itself. \\n\\nThey also have a very solid beer and whiskey menu (including flights of both) plus cocktails that have a bit of an Irish feel to them. \\n\\nIn general the place is definitely pretty adult friendly what with all the beers and pub atmosphere and such but kids will enjoy the entertainment as well.

Seriously they normally have tour buses in the parking lot.\\n\\nYou don't walk in to the restaurant and wait to be seated. You walk up to a hostess stand, you will be warmly greeted and then sat in the outside ( tree covered) holding area until a table is ready. While in this area you will be entertained with live music and of course they will be selling popcorn and cold drinks. Keep in mind this is a BYOB restaurant so feel free to bring your cooler of adult beverages to enjoy. If you forgot your adult beverages, never fear connected to the restaurant Salt Lick Winery, you can purchase a bottle and take it in to the restaurant to enjoy with your BBQ. Texas is the only place I have seen people have wine with BBQ but hey you only live once right!\\n\\nOnce your table is ready you buzzer will sound off and a host will escort you to your table / picnic bench. They have a fairly large menu and you could take a lot of time looking over it or you could just order the Family Meal to the tune of 24.95 of all you can eat BBQ. Let me say that once more ALL YOU CAN EAT BBQ for under 25 bucks. It's only 8.95 for kids and keep in mind this includes all the side items as well. If you have a small appetite you might need to look over the menu they have many items for 9 bucks and up. So I guess they have a little something for everyone. Keep in mind on Sunday they do something a little special.  They have BBQ baby back ribs and  prime rib and other items that I was not paying attention to, because frankly all I cared about was the ribs. \\n\\nSo I ordered the full rack of BBQ baby back ribs and they were everything I needed them to be, tender, moist and coated in sauce. I tried to finish them but I was not successful. Which is okay since they will make great left overs. They say it is about 12 ribs but honestly I think it was more then that. In fact the rack of ribs we so large they barely fit on the platter.\\n After stuffing myself I decided it would be a good idea for cobbler. That was not a good decision, it as not my favorite.

A good option if your looking for something different. I had a hard time finding it. The street doesn't have an normal green sign but one painted in brown and white that says Farnsworth. When your looking for a green city sign its hard to notice. \\n\\nI was in there early Sunday afternoon. The line was a little confusing. If your just getting stuff out of the pastry area you still have to wait in line behind a ton of people who still need to order their full lunch. Then the place to wait to pick your food up is a foot over so it still looks like they are in line confusing the staff taking the next order. Anyways 20 min later another person came out from the back to help out and I was able to give him my pastry order and go right up to pay bypassing the people who had a gazillion questions. I was looking for cupcakes and they only had chocolate. I got one of those and a Belgium chocolate brownie. The cupcakes and brownies were large priced at $2.75. \\n\\nBy the way the guy packed the cupcake the frosting got deflated in the bag. So I had to deal with a mess before I even took a bite. I thought it would be better. The whole cupcake had a very nutty flavor. I wasn't really a fan. No dryness problems but just an odd taste. The frosting was like whipped creme. All together it was average. The Belgium chocolate brownie was very rich. It was more like a flour-less chocolate cake. I ate half and couldn't go any further. \\n\\nI saw some other desserts like mini creme brulees I would go back for. I would also like to try their famous sticky buns after reading the other reviews.

We passed it on our first pass cause I was looking for a little BBQ joint. This place is like a BBQ complex, and it's all real good. \\n\\nThe ambience is the most striking thing. They nailed it here. From the parking lot to the waiting area under the canopy of trees to the open pits near the seating areas so you can drool over the meat from afar while waiting for it to reach your table. It's all done so well. \\n\\nThe food was all good too. You don't choose sides. You choose your meat. They keep it simply about the BBQ. just so happens that the cole slaw and potato salad are some of the best I've ever had. I got the Thurman Plate I think. It was the largest plate with brisket, sausage, pork ribs, and turkey. Brisket was beautiful with the smoke ring and all and it was so tender it was coming apart just trying to move it on the plate. Sausage was perfect not overpowering. The pork ribs were delicious, so tender. The turkey was above average but not spectacular. I was nearly done before I realized I hadn't tried the sauce because the meat is so flavorful you don't need any sauce, and that is a direct quote from my 11 year old. \\n\\nIf you are with 45min or an hour of this place you have to go there it is what I imagine Texas BBQ being complete with Cowboys and Cowgirls bellying up for their fill. \\n\\nIt is BYOB so bring a cooler or you will be visiting their cellar next door to buy your beer/wine."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"4.75 stars.  Quite simply, one of the best brisket, ribs, and sausage meals you will sit down to in your entire life.  This place is full of memories for me:\\n\\nI witnessed one of the greatest contests known to man when behemoth law student David C. went head-to-head against a 5'7 professional body builder hailing from Pennsylvania.  The situation?  Can anyone on the planet eat more food than our book crunching friend.  Our visitor was definitely giving up some pounds, but the resulting performance remains the single largest amount of food I have seen eaten by an individual in my life.  While David C. took down what was the equivalent of about 40 pieces of sausage, a couple of racks of ribs, and maybe 4 servings of brisket, Mr. Body Builder pretty much ate SIX TIMES as much food.  I didn't even realize the stomach had the capacity to hold that much solid at a time.  I lost my appetite watching the performance, and at the time, this was the best brisket I had ever eaten in my life.  \\n\\nWhile that might be the most memorable moment, I do remember my introduction to this place was carried forth by none other than courtroom legend \\"Bulletproof\\" Reposa (prior to alleged mastubatory gestures).  I brashly noted that I could take down a family style plate on my own, and while I almost succeeded, I was eventually done in by the excessive sausage remaining on the plate.\\n\\nOver the years, I introduced a number of individuals to the Salt Lick.  I have two favorite traditions here.  The first is to order their delicious rendition of blackberry cobbler at the end of an AYCE meal here.  The cobbler is a nice, sweet refreshing treat that is the diametrical opposite to the divinely soft brisket, hearty ribs, and perfectly spiced sausage.  The second tradition involves leftovers.  The Salt Lick allows you to take a plate of leftovers with you after your AYCE meal.  If you are in my group and you are a newbie, you are getting the leftovers.  And you will be the happiest person on the planet that day.\\n\\nThe Salt Lick has expanded to other locations (including an egregious location out in Las Vegas), but you aren't going here unless you head to the original in the heart of Driftwood, TX.  No trip to Austin is complete without a visit to one of the greatest BBQ spots in the entire nation.  Along with Black's BBQ in Lockhart, TX, I give the Salt Lick my highest recommendation."},{"name":"Stone Soup Kitchen","address":"584 Woodward Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"foo d and drinks are pretty good.  the lady with the big chest and beehive hair-do seems perpetually angry at the world and she reflects that energy in the service that she gives.  that's why i gave it one star.  otherwise, it is a great place."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I think the pizza is decent but it's a bit hyped up.

They have a full bar equipped with wide screen HDTVs for sports viewing.  The dining room is a dark atmosphere with singular high rise lights shining at the center of the table.  The atmosphere was classy, low key, and comfortable.  \\n\\nI started with a bowl of loaded potato soup for $5 and the wine of the day which was an Estancia Pinot Noir glass for $11.  Both were overpriced.  The soup was good and the wine was good, but I've had better wine and soup for cheaper.  The initial server seemed pretentious and arrogant.  Luckily, he was replaced with a much friendlier guy that made the experience enjoyable. \\n\\n I ordered the special of the day which was a horseradish encrusted steak with a loaded baked potato for $24.  The steak was average at best.  It had that taste of a steak that was cooked on a dirty outdoor grill: burnt and smokey.  The loaded baked potato was rised high and tasted great, but how hard is that to accomplish?  The three things that amazed me were things that I didn't order but tried from other people's food:  the cole slaw, the cous-cous, and the carrot cake.  The cole slaw is not your ordinary cole slaw.  I couldn't decipher all the constituents but a big ingredient that was out of the ordinary was their usage of bleu cheese.  The cous cous was soft and tasty which is unusual for me to say because I typically don't like cous cous.  \\n\\nThe carrot cake was hot, yes hot.  This is only the 2nd time that I have come across a restaurant that has the gall to serve the carrot cake hot. It was delicious.  The first was PF Chang's in winter park, but they got their cake from the Dessert Lady which is why there's was so good.  This was a square piece of carrot cake with a great texture and taste to the cake and wonderful icing.  All were hot and gooey. \\n\\n Overall, the experience was decent.  There were some pros and some pitfalls.  I think if I had probably ordered a burger or a pasta, I would have been happier.  I can just say to not order the steak because it's dry, overpriced, and tasteless.  The only way it reminds me of Houston's like the other two yelpers said was in the overpriced category.  Houston's is unquestionably overpriced for the quality you get and so is this.  I would prefer J Alexander's however.  They don't overwhelm you with pretentiousness like Houston's does and they give you bigger portions and are a little bit cheaper than Houston's.

Now that this location in Winter Park, I only have to drive 10 minutes to enjoy an amazing Indian meal.  It just opened last week, and let me tell you, they really have their act together.  The decor is very nice, the service is amazing, and the food is very tasty.  My wife and I ate there for lunch today.  I tried my favorite, lamb vindaloo - Indian hot, and my wife tried the vegetable dosa. The lamb was very tender and the vindaloo gravy was made from scratch with hints of fresh ginger.  My wife had the dosa, which is a Southern Indian dish.  It is basically an Indian crepe, filled with various goodies, like curry potatoes, peas, onions, etc.  The lunch portions are very generous and include a small salad, pickled veggies, yogurt, lentil soup, and naan.  They had all of the traditional Northern Indian items on the dinner menu, as well as lots of delicious Southern Indian dishes.

The \\"salsa\\" is more like a mince of refreshing herbs and while I can't say what is in it specifically, I can point out that I don't like a lot of herbs but this was an amazing combination with the steak and potatoes.

The prix fixe menu changes monthly and each month chef Earl highlights or celebrates a certain part of Thailand or certain genre of Thai cuisine. One month, the menu revolved around Thai street food. How cool is that? Each course was an interesting lesson, if you will, about street foods in different regions. And it was all delicious. Though I didn't love every single flavor, I appreciated them all. Fun! This is what dining should be like! I feel like I savor and appreciate the food and the preparation of it so much more in such a setting. \\n      But what is a great meal without great spirits? Drinks are served from Paadee's full bar. I'm a craft beer snob, and I'm always happy with one of the 4  beers on draft available. The cocktails are delectable and potent (the Rye and Cherry is divine), and the wine selection is pretty impressive. You can get wine pairings with each course if you want. \\n      Bottom line: Save up your money to dine at Langbaan as many times as you can. You won't be sorry."},{"name":"Pizza A Go Go","address":"3240 N Williams Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This is the best Pizza place I've found in North Portland, and is probably a contender for a top-slot in the city.

Since that first amazing experience, I've been back for a birthday meal with my parents, a birthday dinner with my girlfriend, a Chef's whim experience with roommates, and most recently, brunch yesterday. Each of these meals has been nothing short of incredible, and all shared the extreme satisfaction with the food, top notch service, and leaving the restaurant knowing that the money spent (while expensive) was well worth it.\\n\\nDinner is a meal that is always awesome at Craigie. It's definitely the least economical offering they have, but you need to eat right? Ranging from a la carte meals to a prix fixe and a tasting menu, the choices really depend on how hungry you are and how much you care to spend. Obviously, the more food you get, the happier you are going to be, because all of the parts of the meal are executed incredibly well, each course is better than the next.\\n\\nThe Chef's Whim menu (I think it's just on Sunday nights at this point) is an awesome way to taste really good food at a more affordable price for a prix fixe. You don't know what you're going to get for your three courses, you just know that it's going to be awesome. The only thing the server asks when you order the Chef's Whim is if you have any allergies, other than that the meal consists of whatever the Chef wants to make. It can involve parts of animals you wouldn't otherwise try, which makes it a delicious, adventurous event!\\n\\nBrunch yesterday was awesome. The coffee was flowing - delicious and strong. The bloody mary was spice well with fresh horseradish. I got the hash - made from beef cheek and beef tongue with a poached farm fresh egg. Just incredible.

This all makes Giacomo's a perfect place for a date!"},{"name":"The Porter Beer Bar","address":"1156 Euclid Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"A great place for beer snobs and hipsters (is there a difference?) but just an ok spot for the blue collar beer drinkers like myself. The Reuben is fantastic and the fish & chips are slightly above par. The service is slow, but this is the L-5-P. Prob be a good spot to bring a girl that pretends to know a lot about beer because she is the only one of her friends that drinks Newcastle instead of Corona or Bud Light."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"One of my favorite BBQ spots! We've moved out of state, but every time we're back in TX, we make a point to get to Salt Lick.  Delicious, pit smoked brisket, sausage, chicken, turkey, and beef/pork ribs. If you have room, really yummy blackberry cobbler! \\n\\nIt's cash only, and BYOB, with no corkage fee! Great for large groups, and you get your food fast. Definitely worth the drive, we always walk away happy"},{"name":"Barcelona Inman Park","address":"240 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Always a good time here!!
