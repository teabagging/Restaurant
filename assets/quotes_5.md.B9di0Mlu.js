No need to thank me, just doing my civic duty. \\n\\nHot Chicken Takeover sits on the second floor of what might be my favorite kind of food destination, an indoor food market(North Market to be specific). There are so many glorious things happening between these 4 walls, but the smell of hot chicken conquers all. \\n\\nSo I've had Nashville hot chicken. Im sure I am not the first and won't be the last to make the comparisons; this is nothing like that. I really can't explain it without boring you with details, but technically speaking, they really very much different. \\n\\nIn terms of the menu, pretty simple: chicken, Mac, coleslaw, waffle. Of course ordering the chicken is a little more complicated, as you'll have to choose your cut of meat + white vs dark + heat level. This is where I usually take the opportunity to talk down on white meat loves....I'll refrain lol \\n\\nThe food:\\n\\nChicken - dark comes with a quarter chicken, leg and thigh. A piping hot, super juicy, absolutely perfectly crispy breaded piece of meat. Call me a softy but the 'warm' is the perfect heat level. A nice kick, but not enough to drown out the wonderful chicken. It's no Nashville hot, but it's good enough for me to be forced into getting a second piece! Don't judge...\\n\\nMac - solid Mac and cheese. Cheesy and nicely al dente. The only thing that could have made this better was a little change in texture. Maybe a crumble topping or browning of the cheese. Maybe that's just a personal preference, but this is easily a satisfying version.  \\n\\nColeslaw - I don't like coleslaw. I'm not sure anyone actually does. There's no such thing as a good one. Period \\n\\nBanana pudding - So many thoughts! First of all, I'm walking into this a huge skeptic, as I've never been a fan of pudding. But this is absolutely delicious. These three layers could not have been a more perfect ensemble. With that being said, this is diabetes in a cup. If you happen to pair this with the \\"free\\" sweet tea, you might not walk out alive.....\\n\\nI am grateful places like Hot Chicken Takeover remain far away from me. Who wants to deal with that kinda temptation ? \\n\\nOh and I've come to the conclusion that if your city doesn't have an indoor(no one wants to deal with the outside elements, unless you live in San Diego) food market, it seriously needs to step its game up...."},{"name":"Mr. Bones BBQ","address":"1201 Barbara Jordan Blvd, Ste 1230","city":"Austin","stars":"2","text":"In a nutshell: for eat-in be prepared for a wait, or go once their staff is up to speed, take away is great.\\n\\nI've been four times now, and the food has been great.

It toke 20 mins for the appetizer to come but they finally came and we're super good which was the chicken taquitos . The server not once checked up on us to ask us how the appetizer were nor the drink I mean that's server common sense I assume . Thankful they were good. We then waited 30 mins for our entrees and the server noticed the food wasn't on the table he said \\"Idk why the foods not here yet I'm going to check on it\\". I was like ok maybe it's the kitchen he never came back. Of course to top the cherry the manager comes 5 mins later to tell us \\" I do apologize but the server left the food on hold and forgot to send the food it's going to be a few mins maybe 5\\". I was ready to explode but of course I didn't on her because she was so nice to us compared to the server. We had to cancel the order because I lost my appetite with all the time we wasted and got nothing . I think the servers name was McKenzie maybe Idk .

My friend was initially told they were out of coffee while I was told the cashier would deliver it at the pick up counter.  The cashiers finally decided they would brew another pot so we both paid for coffees. We checked back when the coffee no-showed and were told the cashiers had forgotten.

She asked where we'd be sitting, said she would bring it to us at the table and gave us a makeshift marker.  I knew it would be impossible for her to find us as the limited seating was in chaos.  we ended up sitting at a dirty table with the last customer's dessert remnants.

They gave no further instructions. In the meantime we watched dirty tables accumulate with no one servicing this dining area for the dessert counter.

I haven't been back to this location in ten years.  That was when it really was the best Japanese restaurant in Boston.  Up until my last visit, I was a regular here.  In fact, I had been a regular here since even before the owners made the brilliant decision to convert their restaurant from Chinese (the original Ho Yuen Ting) to Japanese.\\n\\nThis was the place where I had my first Beef Negima and fell in love with Caterpillar maki, Backdraft maki and Hotategai sushi.  They had fantastic, light and airy Tempura.  My wife and I decided to stop in for dinner and, feeling nostalgic, that's what we ordered in addition to a few other \\"standard\\" items.  For some reason they were out of Hotategai, so I was a little disappointed.\\n\\nI was even more disappointed that they changed the recipe of the Beef Negima.  They used to roll the beef around scallions and cheese.  Yes, cheese.  It was so good.  They now omit the cheese and the teriyaki sauce tasted like Kikkoman or some other commercial brand.  Their original teriyaki sauce tasted homemade, which I believe they really did used to make in-house.  I remember asking them about that years ago.  They're the ones who inspired me to make my own homemade teriyaki sauce.  My recipe tastes like their original sauce.  It's just not the same anymore.\\n\\nThe Tempura was a bit oily but crispy.  Generally, everything except the Beef Negima was good, but it just didn't seem as good as it used to be.  Maybe it's because we've gotten so used to great sushi from all the competition that sprang up over the years.  Maybe it's because they really have gone down hill.  Maybe it's a little of both.

Sadly things were put into a damper.\\n\\nThe server was lackluster and the rolls were just the same. I split the ninja, inferno, spicy tuna, and bonsai rolls. The last three came out on the same plate and we had to guess that much--the server just noted the ninja was on the way and bolted (which I could understand if it was busy but maybe they). \\n\\nThe food wasn't bad but there was slightly too much rice on the rolls and it tasted off; it was dry. The chef does know what they are doing though as the spicy tuna was good (simpler rolls execute quality of ingredients and proportioning). The inferno was really good but text it wise in thought a little crunch to go with the Krab would take it to another level since it's a fairly soft roll. The bonsai left me underwhelmed as all the fish actually lacked flavor--signs of low quality cuts, as I think it was supposed to have yellowtail which is both a light and flavorful fish--couldn't distinguish it from the tuna. \\n\\nThe ninja was good, the ponzu accentuated the delicate flavors of the fish. \\n\\nOnly real complaint is the INACCURATE pricing of rolls on the menu to what rang up on our bill. An $11.50 bonsai roll is really $12.50 (which for the quality I'd actually have paid that price for a ninja not bonsai; ninja rang up $10.50). So be wary of the potential to be paying more than you expected. I would have just told the server myself except she seemed to be avoiding us after we paid. And in retrospect a posh atmosphere and fresh fish do come with a price tag--although I prefer it being accurately reflected right from the initial order menu. \\n\\nI'll give this place another try next time I'm in town.

A while. Bring entertainment- & maybe some snacks.\\n3) If you are just a few folks, you can sit at the bar to eat.\\n4) Don't order boring things like the veggie burger.

Latkes, blintzes, borscht.\\n6) Adding to #5, the latkes are amazing- they are huge, share them, or make them a meal.  But please do not expect thin, cripsy, made-by-my-Grandma latkes:  these puppies are fat masses of soft shredded potato with a crisp and delciously greasy crust-  sour cream ups the cholsetrol further and the applesauce has an unidentified spicy kick.

The only problem is that this place has gotten SO popular that you have to arrive about an hour ahead (8:30) if you want to claim a table for you and your group.  Also, the sushi rolls that they have on happy hour special all taste the same now.  Spicy salmon, spicy tuna, California, and Atlantic all look and taste the same with slight variations in pinkness of the grounded-up fish.\\n\\nHowever, I do recommend their $5 pizzas (margherita, bbq chicken, california, or pepperoni) as a great value.  The sliders and fried calamari are also great appetizers to share.  Or if you're just there to drink, check out their frozen margaritas in a variety of flavors!  And don't forget the sake bombs!\\n\\nI used to crave going here weekly for happy hour specials but a year or so later, I have found the atmosphere a bit too crowded and the sushi rolls less divine.

Unfortunately, I missed a few of the ingredients after hearing something about liver.  I hate liver, but I decided what the heck, I guess I'll try it out.  I asked the server to hold the cilantro (of course), and I said yes to the jalapenos.  I should have said no.\\n\\nI thought the \\"Special\\" sandwich was really good!  The French baguette was really fresh and delicious!  Among the various meats inside, there is some type of liver, pork, and head cheese (see Daniel B.'s review for a link describing what it is...  eek!).  Along with the special kinds of meat, there are slices of pickled cucumber, carrots, jalapenos, and some other pickled veggies.  WHOA, the jalapenos were REALLY spicy!

Next time, no jalapenos for me.\\n\\nIn addition to her banh mi, my friend ordered a crepe.  I never had one of these Vietnamese crepes before, but my friend told me that you're supposed to wrap bits of  it in lettuce (or other greens), dip it in fish sauce, and then eat it.  The one that she ordered had shrimp, pork, and bean sprouts in it.  I tried a bit of it and thought it was pretty good.  The crepe is a little sweet, and eating it with lettuce and fish sauce was interesting.\\n\\nOverall, I feel that Lee's Bakery deserves 4 stars for their cheap and delicious banh mi!  Service was also great!  Our server ensured that our water glasses were refilled often, and she was pretty friendly.  One thing that I noticed on my way out was that the same banh mis that cost $3 if you eat inside the restaurant are $2.50 each if you take them to-go.  And, as others have mentioned, if you buy 5 banh mis to-go, you'll get one free.  Sweet deal!  I'll definitely be back to get 6 banh mis to-go!  =)\\n\\n[Review 021 of 366]"},{"name":"Zaftigs Delicatessen - Brookline","address":"335 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Top 5, everything on a Sunday Morning was perfect.\\nClean, nice looking establishment.\\n\\nOmelet, side of Bacon, I will download a photo.\\n\\nLovely girl waited on me.

They have a convenient setup where one can freely 'sniff' the different offerings of teas.

I also had their cheese scone which was heated up in the microwave, making the texture chewy and unappetizing.  It was also bland.  Finally, the tuna fish sandwich which was grilled nicely on the panini press hardly had any tuna.  Seriously??  It could have easily been called tuna-flavored sandwich...\\n\\nI'm giving an overall 2.5 rating, as it gets 1 star for food and 4 stars for our experience with the teas.

I don't come here often, but every time I do, I have mixed feelings. When I went the Friday before last for lunch, the line was out the door, but it moved fairly quickly, and we were able to find a seat for five people easily. The location is quite large with a bottom and top floor as well as a covered patio. \\n\\nHere's what I don't like. The classic burger. I think they use Niman Ranch burger meat (or at least they used to), and it's almost as if they think that alone makes the burger. They don't ask you how you want it cooked, so it comes out well done, and you just get your normal toppings: cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, and what tastes like Heinz yellow mustard. It actually tastes a bit burnt, and the burger flavor doesn't shine through. Okay, that's great and all, but I could make that at home, so what is the selling point here? Oh, did I mention it's FIFTEEN DOLLARS. Are you kidding me?? I would say literally every burger at Flip Side down the street is better than this burger and cheaper. \\n\\nAll right, so maybe I shouldn't be getting a burger at a place that caters toward the vegetarian palette, but really, is it that hard to make a burger taste good? I've had the Pad Thai there as well, and it really didn't do much for me. Definitely not the best I've had in Columbus, especially not for $14.50.\\n\\nI will say the dark chocolate truffle cookie is amazing, even at $3, and that alone could fill me up, so it wasn't all bad. I just need to remind myself next time I come here, which is only like a couple times a year, that I hate the burgers.\\n\\nSometimes I think the popularity of Northstar Cafe is overblown, but I guess all these people can't be wrong? Maybe my taste is just not sophisticated enough. Northstar Cafe is the Arcade Fire of restaurants, and I just don't get it. Any who, if you want to eat healthy, organic things, that taste mediocre for a high price tag, this is your spot.

I don't know how they stay in business.  A friend used to live in this neighborhood, but it has been a few years since he moved out.  He told me the food was good, so I finally decided to make the walk over after I got home from work last night.\\n\\nWalked in and the place was pretty dead.  There was one couple at one table, and two couples together at another table.  I took my order to go.  After looking at the long menu, I decided to order (by number) the #3 and the #67.  Oh.  You want to know what those are?  That would be the Spring Rolls and the Praram which I ordered with pork.  Other choices aside from pork are the norm.  Chicken, beef, tofu.  Others not so normal.  Fishballs? (Fish have balls?  Who knew?  Stupid joke.)\\n\\nI waited out the 10 minutes it took to cook my food amongst a pile of newspapers sitting on a table by the counter.  After reading a bit about the Blazers last loss my food was ready and I was out the door.\\n\\nOne thing about the interior of the restaurant before forgetting.  It can be described as such.  It was like I technicolor yawned and my technicolor yawn designed the place.  I took liberties with that previous sentence.  A similar line is from a movie.  Know which one?  I guess what I'm trying to say is, the design wasn't very pleasing to the eye, but you don't really go to a restaurant to eat the design and ultimately I don't really care what a place looks like.\\n\\nBack home and time to eat.  Went for the Spring Rolls first.  They were  hot and crispy, not too greasy, stuffed with glass noodles and veggies and came with a very good plum sauce.  Wish there had been more sauce as I about ran out before finishing the forth roll.  Oh well.  Minor details.\\n\\nOnto the Praram.  At first glance, I thought the portion was a bit tiny.  A portion of white rice (would have preferred brown, but wasn't even given that option) helped grow the dish.  When asked how spicy I wanted it from 1-5 I said 4.  Wish I had said 5.  Either my tongue is completely numb now from spicy foods, or the food really isn't as spicy as these places say it is supposed to be.  Next time I will ask for 6.  The Praram consisted of pork in peanut sauce with coconut milk and spinach.  It was very tasty and I judge a place on whether I can make another meal of it.  Let's just say my lunch is taken care of for today.\\n\\nSo, if you read other reviews for this place, most have said they go here because it is in the neighborhood.  There are so many thai restaurants in town and everybody has their favorite.  I wouldn't say this is my favorite, but it is pretty good and I'm glad I finally got over there.  If you are in the neighborhood, stop in and show them some love."},{"name":"Punjabi Dhaba","address":"225 Hampshire St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Totally underwhelmed by the blandness, crispy naan, and prison trays.

Loved everything except perhaps the ramen, whose broth fell a bug flat (but the matzo balls were lovely as were the noodles themselves).

I have never been sitting inside, but the outside seating area is a treat! It gives you the full portion of sunshine for almost the entire afternoon! This is like docking to a station to fill up your empty batteries. Nice side effect: Wonderful place for people-watching:-)\\n\\n2.)The only negativ thing i can point out turns out to be a positive one again: The staff is a little bit slow, but that allows you to hang out in the sunshine for hours and nobody would rush and throw the check on your table while your still enjoying the last sip of your coffee. Which leads me to point number three..\\n\\n3.) They serve wonderful coffee and they DO serve it in china! No plastic cups if you dont order to go, not even if you sit outside. WONDERFUL!!!\\n\\n4.) If you order a green salad, you get a green salad. No fancy, wanna-be salad with chicken stripes and artificially flavoured super-drizzled low calorie salad dressing.

I had the eastsider on gf crust pizza delivered, and it just....wasn't good. The crust was mushy and undercooked, the sauce has no flavor, and neither did the cheese. The toppings were not evenly distributed and all pooled to the middle of the pizza, which only amplified the bad texture. The ingredients all just seemed poor quality and tasteless. The second star is because the pizza arrived in the time frame suggested and so far it hasn't gives me food poisoning or anything. Seems overpriced for the product, but it would be fine if the pizza was actually good.

Write off the bat when making the reservation via telephone the hostess advised we could only have the table for 2 hours and would have to leave and go find seating in the bar area. That already put a sour taste in my mouth, we got there and got seated we had 1 waitress who seemed a little frustrated, not the friendliest. I have never worked in the restaurant industry before, so im sure its tough having to serve a group of 15 people however it wouldnt kill to smile. I ordered the butter chicken, my dish arrived and the chicken was raw, i advised the waitress and she bought a \\"new\\" one for me within 5 minutes the chicken still tasted borderline as if it just passed the pink stage. It didnt taste right so I ate a few bites and left it to the side. Everyone else at the table was not impressed with the food , taste wise nohting was really that great especially for the price . We ordered some yager bomb shots as well  which We order all the time at other restuarants. The bill comes at the end they eneded up actually having the nerve to charge me for the raw butter chicken, as well as for each yager bomb shot they charged 6.50 for the yager and 5.00 for the red bull. But here is the catch we DID NOT get the entire can of red  bull just a small amount , so they cahrged everyone in that reestuarant for a can of red bull at 5.00 and only gave them about a third of the can. 11.50 for a yager bomb shot. We advised the waitress and she said oops taht was my bad. YOUR BAD , really can you imagine how many people they rip off on the daily If your charging for the entire can of red bull your supposed to give the entire can of redbul not a third. So she removed the red bull charge off the bill which took her about 20 mins to do alone. Then i advised her as to the butter chicken charge on my bill and advised that i shouldn have to pay for the raw butter chicken as i didnt even enjoy it or the \\"newly\\" cooked one they bought out in 5 mins. I didnt think it was fair, she then goes to \\"talk' to her manager , comes back 10 mins later and still hasnt removed it off the bill and says there is nothing she can do. I was so upset at this point because its the principle of it, its not that i couldnt afford the 17.99 but if i didnt enjoy the dinner at all and it was RAW why would i be paying the full price for it. Ive ate at many restaurants and rarely have had issues, when i got to Cactus Club Cafe and even if the food comes out cold, or there is anything at all wrong about it they remove it off the bill and are so apologtic and provide great customer service. Yaletown Brewery didnt even come close to providing that and they charge the same prices as a Cactus Club, however there service is no where close. In the end the server came back after another 10 mins and finally removed the butter chicken off the bill . worst experience ive had , and on top of that they add a 18% tip for parties over 8 which i understand , but wow what a waste of 18% going to that waitress who was one of the worst servers . I feel bad becuase my friend didnt really enjoy her birthday and we deeply regret making a reservation at this restuarant, would never recommend this restaurant to anyone or would never return."},{"name":"Yaletown Brewing Company","address":"1111 Mainland Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"I'd honestly like to give these guys a 0 stars but it's not possible.

The chips were thick and annoying, but they also give you these wonderful flour tortillas for scooping up the queso.  The barbecue brisket is pretty good, with a great coffee rub and moist, tender fatty parts that don't need sauce. On the other hand, the non-fatty parts of the brisket are pretty dry and tough, which wouldn't be so bad if their barbecue sauce didn't absolutely suck.  The side of collard greens is pretty damn good, especially after adding mustard.\\n\\nThe second time I was here was Frito pie night - fritos slathered with brisket (I think it's a brisket chili?), cilantro, and goat cheese.

Small, homey little place, with friendly faces and very good service.  Menu is basic for the most part, eggs, pancakes, etc., but they do have some very interesting options, like a breakfast avocado bowl, and several different breakfast quinoa bowls.  Also, they offer several different kinds of yummy sounding baked oatmeal, which I will try next time.  This time, I had an egg with turkey sausage, hash browns, and Portuguese sweet bread toast.  Everything was delicious.  My only small negative is that I thought it quite costly to upgrade from regular toast to the sweet bread ($1.99!).  That seems like a lot of a slice of bread.  All in all, I will return and am glad this new diner has opened in Stoughton!"},{"name":"Hot Chicken Takeover","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"The chicken here is really good. It's juicy, flavorful, and just really well made. I usually get the hot, and it certainly is hot. Initially it just seems kind of spicy, but the more you eat it, the spicier it gets! This is coming from someone who has a fairly high spice tolerance!! \\n\\nEven though their chicken is good, I knocked down a star for two reasons: 1) I'm really not a fan of their Mac and cheese or their slaw, so I only get the chicken. Their Mac and cheese I think is too solid, and not very flavorful. Their cole slaw is okay - I like that it's not very heavy, but I can really do without it. And 2) their hours are very limiting. I can never come here on the weekdays ever, so I'm really just limited to the weekends. (And even though they not have a second location that has better hours, I don't think the other location's chicken is as good)."},{"name":"Gourmeto's Pizza","address":"8216 World Center Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"You know I never have eaten here and never will.

I have no complaints about the cleanliness of my room. However, when I was coming in late on the first night of my stay, my planes were delayed and I did not get in until after midnight, so they called me to make sure that I was still coming, which I understand. And then they called me 5 min later to check. And then they called me again after that. Clearly there is not good communication with the front desk. The conference I was attending was actually in the hotel, and they did a great job of catering to it. The food was fantastic. And it's very close to plenty of great restaurants and shops, so that is definitely a plus! But, it took them 2 weeks to send me a final bill via EMAIL, and I had to call for it 2x (I needed it for reimbursement from my company). So that was annoying. And then when I would get back from the conference around 7/8 at night, they would be cleaning my floor. No biggie because I realize it's a big place and probably takes a long time to clean. But then housekeeping would just leave all the bags of trash and dirty linens in the hallways for hours at a time. I am not paying to walk down a hallway filled with dirty laundry and trash, so that was gross.

I bought some pita from Barbur World Foods, and then fried up mixed peppers and onions to  have on it. (Also made a delicious ras el hanout - chocolate ice cream for dessert and roasted cauliflower and feta cheese to accompany.)

It's near lots of shops, restaurants and cute neighborhoods. In my case, I was here for the Inbound 2017 conference at the BCEC so transportation to and from was provided via shuttles - even during rush hour, I didn't find the commute to be bad at all so no complaints on my part. Keep in mind that Boston in general is an expensive place to stay and play so be aware that you will be paying premium rates at this property which may deter some people. \\n\\nCheck-in was a breeze and I was able to get in early which was nice. The room itself was average with a view of the building across from me as well as the city. There are NO USB plugs that you usually find more often at other hotel properties so remember to bring your adapters!\\n\\nNow, here are some things (and also my reasons to deduct stars) to consider if you are not able to reap the benefits from employer reimbursement or Marriott rewards:\\n\\n1.) WiFi access has a fee associated with it\\n2.) Parking is $40/night for self park and $60+ for valet\\n3.) Pillows are dull and lifeless - if you have neck, shoulder and back problems I would recommend bringing your own\\n4.) I had a bathroom towel that had marks on it (pic posted)\\n5.) It's just an average property tied to the Marriott name - unfortunately, Marriott has great potential to come off as a higher end name, but this property really wouldn't be one to define it.

Colleagues and I are in town for work and they put me in charge of selecting a spot for dinner. Thanks to my fellow elites in Austin, I landed on Lamberts.\\n\\nHere's what you can expect - it's pretty dim inside (not ideal for food pics!!). The restaurant appears to be 2 levels - upstairs was booked for a private event on the night we were there. There's complimentary mini corn bread but they only give you 2 pieces, regardless if you have an odd number of people in your party. Sooooo, ya gotta share; which is actually ok because it's not great cornbread so someone can have my portion. \\n\\nSidebar: Lamberts can make a mean tart lemonade. I asked our server if they would tone down the sugar and amp up the tartness. She delivered perfection to the table - I was even surprised by how tart it was but I like lemons so if you're the kind of person who truly appreciates a tart lemonade, Lamberts has it down solid.\\n\\nNow let's talk about food. You can't come to the south and not have fried green tomatoes. Lamberts takes it a notch higher by plating it with jumbo lump crab salad and a light salad. This is a YES! Without some sort of dressing, fried green tomatoes falls flat but this was a well executed dish that brought southern meets seafood meets greens on one plate.\\n\\nMEATS...I am so in love with Lamberts brisket. Since I don't have a stomach the size of Texas, I like that Lamberts offers a smaller potion of their brisket for only $6. It was the perfect size (about a full palm). You don't even need sauce on their brisket - it's tender, fall apart, flakes easily with a fork. \\n\\nColleagues ordered the natural pulled pork sandwich (it doesn't photo well but don't let that deter you) and the enormous whole black angus short rib.

Usually this means a place that got it mostly right and I thought was about a 4.5, I'll give a 5; 3.5, a 4, and so on. Not to make the review process too persnickety or nitty gritty; it's just that when we come across a  \\"pure\\" 5 star experience, such as Flying Pie has earned, the significance is muted to a great extent by all the \\"grade\\" or star inflation flying around with other place and reviews. It seems to me that making partial star points (in denominations or 0.1, or maybe 0.25--and DEFINITELY include a 0 star option, for the very rare but oh-so deserving...) is an easy solution to this problem. Powers that be @ Yelp (or maybe Yelpicorn Donaldo? He seems to have some juice in these forums), one can but hope you're paying attention...\\n\\n\\nDoes any of the above make much sense? I have had quite a few 4+ experiences, but the clean, \\"knocked it out of the park and out of the freakin' zip code\\" 5 star rating is rare, and needs to be.\\n\\n\\nThis leads us, inexorably, to Flying Pie. It has been a long while since sampling their offerings, they had just opened their Milwaukie store the last time, which was about 4 years ago, if memory serves. I had somehow managed to forget what to expect from these people! I've had many pizza slices from just about every competitor, where there was the thought \\"Wow, those are really good mushrooms/onions/garlic etc etc, sure wish there was more than 2 or 3 little pieces per slice\\". Needless to say nobody in our extended pizza dining party made any comments within a million miles of that sort with the Flyin' Pie! Holy flippin' Toledo, ye gods, there was so much topping---so much meat! one or two slices, regardless of the crust style (we got thin for nearly everything, but sicilian for the combo and stromboli) was enough of a meal for everybody in attendance. Which was fantastic news, b/c that meant plentiful leftovahs!!!\\n\\n\\nSo. Much. Goodness! I'm still agog. The 18\\" pies come in around $30, but I have to say, I've been made to pay as much from certain other local competitors, for so much less product and service, that there is simply no comparison. Most of the competition does not even belong in the same category as Flying Pie; it is the Big Leagues, in an entire region nearly destitute of worthy competition, mostly just t-ball and beer league teams, as it were....\\n\\n\\nFinally, BIGGUPS to Josh, the co-owner of the franchise. Josh, you went above and beyond, attending to my group's needs. Your \\"can do\\" spirit is what helped make this country great. I know that sounds terribly corny, but hey, you almost can't help but succeed w/your ethos, brother. I truly hope you make a bazillion, and keep gettin' er done w/that same can-do drive we all saw on display.\\n\\n\\nIt would be difficult indeed to use hyperbole to do any justice to just how terrific the Flying Pie really is.

I've not had any communication problems with the staff. \\n\\nWhen i order Chinese food, I always order food with special requests. China Wok honors the requests and my food comes out delicious. My favorite is the Won-Ton soup. I order the large $2.95 1 quart size Won Ton soup. I request Water Chestnuts, Napa Cabbage & Snow Peas to be added in with the usual mix of broth, scallions & Won-Tons. \\n\\nThe soup is outstanding. They charge me $1 extra (total $3.95) for all the extra add-ins but the soup is great. \\n\\nTheir house-style of fried rice is not a deep, dark color. I ordered a combo dinner and requested some hoisin sauce to be sauteed in with the rice as i wanted a darker rice. The lady knew exactly what I wanted and stated back to me \\"you want a dark fried rice\\". The food came out great. \\n\\nThe menu is also super reasonably priced. They've been in business there for a ton of years and probably never saw the need to jack up prices. \\n\\nMy only suggestion on the menu is to 'stick with the basics'. The soup is outstanding, the combo dinners, the chow mein, the egg foo young, moo goo gai pan, etc. are all outstanding and a great value. The menu does have some higher-priced 'house specialties' such as the golden-fried won-ton with veggies, etc.etc. but those, IMHO, are simply overpriced versions of the basic menu items. \\n\\nMost of the entree items come with a container of steamed rice. As I like to change things up, I asked if I could do Fried Rice instead. The lady repeated back to me 'fried rice $1 extra' which I paid & is very much in line with substitution charges at other Chinese establishments. \\n\\n\\nChina Wok is tough to beat for solid, basic Chinese-American takeout-style food.

Beautiful view, tourist advertising, lots of development going up around it, and yet... there's something just... odd...I get a weird vibe, and I'm not sure why...anyone else? Eh?\\nAnyways..  the food sucks, (this is a multiple occasion, many things ordered opinion) the view is great. We take people who visit us to sit out and chill on the deck. The wait staff seems to be pretty good, the menu is REALLY lacking for choices, and the drinks are completely overpriced.\\nUnfortunately, because it is such a great view, I'll go back when people come into town, but that's about it. I feel that because of that, I'm supporting a business that really needs to be taught a lesson in listening to their many unsatisfied customers, but... oh well. Maybe I'll do Uncle Billy's next time instead. If they got their act together, meaning their food on par with the class of the building and view, this place could be absolutely incredible..but for some reason they blatantly just don't seem to care.

Not many reviews so I'm guessing it's fairly new. The menu online looked really interesting and when bacon is an ingredient in pretty much every dish, how can you not want to try them out? \\n\\nStopped by with my brother in law and we both ordered the same thing, bacon Cuban and a side of smoked bacon mac n cheese. The set up is very simple. You walk up to the window and place your order. Take a seat outside and they will bring our your food. Warning, they have very limited outside seating, so personally I recommend getting it to go or sit outside in this unforgiving sun. \\n\\nLet's get to the food. The \\"Cuban\\" was really good. Instead of the traditional mustard they had a peppercorn sauce, which I enjoyed. However mentally I had a hard time getting over the fact that it was supposed to be a Cuban. It was pressed, had the right meats and a pickle but at the end it was not a Cuban. Don't get me wrong, it tasted great! The pork had an amazing smokey BBQ taste and you can tell it had bacon but it was not over powering. \\nHowever the star of the show was the smoked bacon mac n cheese. This thing was out of this world good. One of the better Mac n cheese I've had in a while. \\n\\nWe will certainly be back and try out some of their other options. They really have a good selection of food items and all sounded delicious. For example the bacon fried rice or the chicken in a pig pen (pulled chicken, bacon,\\n ranch and cheddar) \\n\\nTry them out! Support local businesses! I want this place to stick around so I can have more Mac and cheese"},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet.  It's one of my fav brunch places in Portland, and I try to take all of my out of town guests here, because I know everyone (including me) will leave oh-so-happy.  And this was one of the first places I ate at, when I came to Portland to find a place to live, so it has a special place in my heart.\\n\\nI'll get to the food in a minute.  Let me talk about the decor.  I LOVE the decor of Mother's!  Chandeliers everywhere with kind of a shabby chic vibe in the main dining room.  The bar area is nice too, just a little darker.  It can get a little crowded getting to a table, but don't let that bother you.  \\n\\nThere is always a wait - once again, that's brunch in Portland.  I don't think I've ever waited under 45 minutes for a table, but they give you one of those thingies that vibrate and light up when they are ready to take you.  You can walk around, walk down to the Saturday market (a few blocks away if on a weekend), or just hang out.  It's up to you, but it's worth the wait, believe me.  And sadly, I've never been here for dinner (I keep saying I will, AND I will, I just haven't gotten to it yet).  So this review is just about brunch (my fav meal).\\n\\nOkay - let's get to the food.  One word:  DELICIOUS!  I have NEVER been disappointed in a meal I've had here, and I've been here at least a dozen times now.  I've had their Biscuits and Gravy, Crunchy French Toast, Fritatta, Pork Apple Sausage and Cheddar Cheese Scramble (my fav savory dish, so far), and just plain scrambled eggs with bacon and a biscuit.  All of these dishes have been really good.  I have no complaints.  But the one thing I'm waiting for this summer (and I think they only have this special during July), is their Marionberry Belgium Waffle.  Seriously, one of the best (sweet) brunch dishes I have ever eaten, anywhere. It's so simple:  a Belgium waffle topped with Marionberries and whipped cream.  But it is so light, it just melts in your mouth.\\n\\nService has always been outstanding and Lisa (the owner) occasionally serves food as well (which I think is amazing). And everyone comes here - both tourists and locals, so that says volumes.\\n\\nOverall, in my top five brunch places in Portland (I think I'll start a brunch list....).  I cannot wait to go back (which will happen after the wedding I'm in...I have to fit into my bridesmaid dress...).  If you haven't been yet, put it on your list.  I'm serious.

As you can see from the number of reviews this is one of the best (and most famous) Italian Bakeries in Boston. It's nearly impossible to find this place without a huge line during the weekends (it's a little better during weekdays). They have some tables but not nearly enough for their busy times so expect to get your stuff to go. They have all the standard Italian pastries and baked goods as well as standard American things like cupcakes and whoopie pies. \\n\\nI've tried several things here and it's really hit or miss. I got a classic cannoli ($3.50) which had obviously been filled much earlier in the day as the interior of the shell was soft and chewy. One thing I like about their cannolis is that they make about a dozen flavors, they're all very delicious but again, they fill them when they're made so the earlier you go, the better they'll be. I also tried a rainbow cookie and a pistacio cookie of some sort. The rainbow one was solid, nothing outstanding though. The pistacio was extremely flavorful and gooey (like a macaroon). Definitely a tasty treat.  Lastly I tried a red velvet whoopie pie whose interior frosting was so disgustingly sweet I actually threw it out. \\n\\nI've got enough amazing bakeries in NYC that I wouldn't go out of my way for Mike's except for maybe one of their unique cannoli flavors."},{"name":"Pip's Original Doughnuts & Chai","address":"4759 NE Fremont St, Ste C","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Cute little donut shop.

Whereas throngs of servers can be found at places like Pho Bac and Pho Dai Loi, here you get a more family-run atmosphere with just a few servers and a smaller space.  Impressive long menu includes not just the usual pho and beef stew but also Hue style and Chinese-influenced style broths, even offering congees.  Price is low, low, low.  \\n\\nThey go heavy on the acidity producing a fragrant and extremely flavorful broth that still feels light.  Not as delicate and savory as Pho Dai Loi's, but it's just different, not worse.  Presentation is on the simple side, but rarely sloppy.  Great spring rolls, okay summer rolls.  I keep reading about how good the fumet (fish broth) is, but seeing as that fumet is not an actual dish, I am not sure if this means I've had it by having had the seafood noodle soup.  It's wonderful though.    \\n\\nOne weakness is their beverages.  The selection is as large as Pho Dai Loi across the street, but generally not very well made.  I usually get a plum icy, avocado/durian smoothie, or coconut juice when I go to a pho resto.  I found the plum icy here too bitter because they dropped a whole section of lime rind.  Coconut too sweet.  Avocado not sweet enough.  They should definitely improve upon their drinks.     \\n\\nSince this is so close to Pho Dai Loi, I say go try both and decide for yourself which you prefer.

Each dish is about $8-$15 depending on what you order. \\n\\nI got the curry special which said it was supposed to come with a \\"chutney salad\\" but  wasn't really sure what part of the meal was the salad...perhaps it was the super spicy red pickled veggies? Or the scooped up ladle of white yogurt dipping? Either way, I was satisfied at the end of the meal, but not over-whelmed in any way. The meal had a few pieces of meat, but mostly veggies and a lot of liquid sauce--which I must say was delicious--but because of that, I knocked a start for seemingly skimping on the hearty part of the meal. If I was only \\"just about full\\" then I know that means other people will probably STILL be hungry.  \\n\\nAlso got the chicken fried rice and that was actually waaay more filling...likely due to the high amount of rice content and so there was a bit of left over for that, but not because they gave exceptionally large portions...it was the fact that you were likely eating 2 bowls of rice with a piece of chicken leg in there. Again, the flavor was pretty good, but the hearty-ness of the meal just lacked a bit. \\n\\nBottom line: A-Okay. It'll get ya from point A to point B, but don't all come running at once!

The response I've always gotten when I extend the invite: You'll be disappointed. And I was. \\n\\nI reference in almost every critique of a restaurant or bar that I've served and bartended before. As such, I'm pretty paticular about getting good service. Because I was damn good at my job and I know exactly what you should be doing when your'e serving me - I know when I should have water on my table, how often and in what incriments you should be coming back to check on me, how long my beverage should take based on the business of your section and the bartender, etc. I have high expectations because I did your job before, and I did it well... and it was a no-brainer. \\n\\nThat being said, I did like our server because I felt bad for him. He gave very poor service but was clearly inexperienced and honestly did his best to make up for it. He forgot to bring us our appetizer (queso) completely. From the top, our experience went like this: \\n\\nWe were seated on the third level balcony. The weather was nice. It took 15 minutes to even be greeted by a server and have our drink / appetizer order taken. In the meantime, the fans came on (though the weather didn't call for it) and made it impossible to have a conversation. Graciously, when we finally did get service, he turned them off. By the time we finished round one of drinks we were nearing 30 minutes of not being checked on for a second time and still not having our queso. On my way to take my daughter to the restroom, I brought this up to the waiter who made it clear he had just forgotten. He brought us our queso and another round of drinks immediately, which all hit the table at the same time as our meals. \\n\\nEveryone was satisfied with their meals but me. You may think now that it's because I'm over bearing and picky, but honestly, if something has cheese on it, I rarely complain. And it's hard to mess up Tex Mex in general. \\n\\nI ordered the Stuffed Avocado, pointing to it on the Appetizer portion of the menu when I ordered it. The waiter didn't specify that there is a Seafood Stuffed Avocado, as well. So he made that choice for me and I was brought the Seafood option - which I definitely didn't want. I could tell he was having a hard time, so I didn't complain. Until I bit into what was a chilled-cold avocado half that was covered with a lukewarm creamy sauce with chunks of raw shrimp and undercooked scallops. I almost lost my stomach at the table. I ate queso and my poblano chowder (Which was alright, until I pulled an entire bay leaf out of my mouth. For those who don't know, these are entirely inedible and must be removed from a dish before serving.) and made it through the meal quietly. \\n\\nThe atmosphere here is gorgeous. The service is absolutely unacceptable. And the food is incredibly sub-par. \\n\\nIt's worth going to the shops and the neighboring restaurants, but I'd never recommend this beyond the great pictures you can take or ordering adult beverages on the balcony."},{"name":"The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium And Savory Feast Kitchen","address":"Universal CityWalk Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Lesson learned, avoid restaurants that say \\"soft opening\\" at the entrance.

Best sandwich ever!' and my last bite of the sandwich I was like, 'ugh, I feel sick.'  Not the kind of sick that comes from eating too much - I only ate about half of my half - but the kind of sick where it's like, wow, is my body built to digest this?  The tangy mustard that gave the sandwich such a kick at the beginning got really tiresome and nausea-inducing, and the thick-cut pastrami - this is no traditional paper-thin sliced pile of pastrami - got heavy and chewy.  The flavor combination may have just been so strong that it was tasty at first but wasn't able to last a whole sandwich.  I don't know.  Whatever it was, I started out loving it and ended by forcing it on Dan.\\n\\nDan got the ostrich, which was neither awesome nor offensive.  It was fine.  Good bread, no doubt about it, but the meat was not flavorful enough for the plainness of the toppings, so the overall effect was blah.\\n\\nGood take on chai, though, with honey and ginger.  I gulped it right down.\\n\\nI am going to leave this at a noncommittal 3 stars, on the off chance Dan and I ordered the wrong things.  I plan to go back and try the sandwiches with more creative toppings.  I've got my eye on the turkey one with cream cheese and lingonberry preserves."},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"All my coworkers told me that I had to come here and I'm glad I listened to them.

I got one refill but then our server seemed to forget about me when she refilled everyone else.  Even when I got my refill, the coffee was still not hot.\\n\\nThe menu offers a plethora of choices for French toast.  I thought some sounded good, some sounded interesting, and some sounded like they'd be too sweet and more like dessert.  I was not overly excited by the other menu options.  I really enjoy omelettes when they come with grits or potatoes or a biscuit or something, but the only omelette option (choose your own ingredients) did not come with these sides while the other egg options, about which I was less than enthused, did come with sides.  Maybe it was just me, but of all the varied combinations of eggs with something, I could not find a combination that had what I wanted.  I was not alone as I did discuss this with two other people at our table and we all considered just ordering a la carte to get closer to what we wanted.  At least we had that option and I was also pleased to discover that they would do some substitutions very graciously.\\n\\nI had the breakfast that had two eggs, a biscuit, home fries and bacon.  I substituted cheese grits for the home fries and was surprised to see that a croissant had been substituted for the biscuit, as well.  I didn't like this - I really wanted a biscuit and the croissant just did not seem to go well with my scrambled eggs and grits.  The grits were good, the eggs were standard scrambled eggs, the croissant was blah, and the bacon was crispy.  It was a lot of food and definitely filled me up.\\n\\nI didn't really dislike this place and I would come again if someone else wanted to go, but I would probably not be the one to suggest it.  Although, I sort of feel like I should give them another try and maybe get French toast to see how it is.

There was a couple sitting in the entryway, and us. We peeked into the dining area and there were a lot of servers walking around. Each time a server looked over, they would make eye contact and smile but no one asked if we had been helped. Most of the servers seemed to be walking around and looking about, and not actually serving. Finally after a few minutes of not being able to get someone's full attention, we walked to the bar area. \\n\\nAgain not being noticed standing at the bar, we just shouted over the commotion and asked if there was a host we could speak to and put our name down for a table. One server who noticed I was trying to get some help looked up without stopping what he was doing, shouted over, \\"how many people?\\" \\"what's your name?\\" and that was that. We had a seat, and within the next 15 minutes, several more parties entered and were not greeted. One group even left. \\n\\nAfter some time,  a server came to the front and started taking down names, though she said she wasn't sure of the wait time since she didn't know where the host was.

He even told me the ingredients for the spring roll dipping sauce! \\n\\nLike I said I only had an hour, and my funds were low. Based on the suggestions of my new found friend I ordered the grilled pork banh mi ($2.50) and of course I couldn't pass up the opportunity to try that not-so-secret spring roll sauce ($3.00). My total came to $5 and some change. Now that's what I'm talking about. What a steal! \\n\\nDare I say it......\\"Love at First Bite\\". My baguette was fresh baked, crusty on the outside, soft and tender on the inside. This hearty sandwich packed a powerful explosion of flavors.

The overall mesh of the flavors together was heavenly. \\n\\nI devoured my sandwich in a matter of minutes, and I enjoyed every second of it.

But, I've been sketchy of this place from the get go and I've avoided their dine in and delivery this whole time. To me, a chinese restaurant should not have a Elvis show lol, and I'm not thrilled with it being called Gourmet Oriental. I've always made it a point to not give support/profits to anything with 'oriental' in it, I'm not a rug! Plus their 'commercial' for the place is misleading lol. It shows picturesque, neatly prepared food plates and a family being politely served by a waitress and they show the gazebo... it was very much NOT this way lol.... Anyway, despite my bringing all this up to my mom, she insisted we should try it to at least see its worth since I had told her there are cars in the parking lot when I've gone by it (I explained those cars could be staff members or customers there for other reasons like the bar drinks or Elvis lol).  \\n\\nThe outside looks very cheesy and OLD! The entrance stairs for the place are not any better with age. The inside decor is WEIRD! Like I said, there's a gazebo in the center of the dining room with the center tables having better table settings (cloth napkins neatly folded etc) while the booths along the walls are severely lacking. For some reason, we sat at a crappy booth. The table was VERY not clean and sticky, but it had better lighting than the other booths. We all got non alcoholic drinks, my mom's ginger ale tasted weird to her, don't know how my brother's soda was to him but he drank it all (he doesn't really notice stuff tasting bad/weird).  My shirley temple was 'boring' compared to others I've had elsewhere. The shirley temple here came in a regular soda cup with a straw and 2 cherries in it lol, but when I've had the drink elsewhere, there's been a fruit cocktail on top of my drink, a fancy straw and glass lol. The waitress only had 1 other table of 2 to deal with the whole time we were there so her attentiveness should have been tons better than it was. But instead she was very unenthusiastic about her job tasks. We were very nice to her nonetheless and she just had a 'ehhhh' attitude the whole time. (Personally, I'd enjoy the quiet times of my job more than the chaotic because it would give me more energy to provide more attention and friendliness to customers, but I guess I'm just a loon for thinking that way...) \\n\\nThe food: we got a pupu platter for 2, peking raviolis, and a all day special of chicken lo mein w/ fried rice and wonton soup. The wonton soup was a tiny bowl with literally 3 tiny wontons in it so we each had 1 wonton lol. The pupu platter was probably the only dish done close to decently standard that you would get the same kinda deal elsewhere too. Pretty minimal portions though. There's a flame option which could've looked cool but my brother said 'no' to the fire. The peking raviolis were at least the doughy kind I love so much, they were kinda flattened though rather than thick and plump. The chicken lo mein was eh, and I personally had to add the spareribs to the fried rice to make it more like pork fried rice. Overall, your safest bet is probably the pupu platter or maybe other appetizers. They really slack off with entree dishes. My mom says we're spoiled because we're used to better Chinese food elsewhere, and yeah it's true. I'm very used to certain dishes being a certain way and anything less than that tastes gross to me.  But even she admitted that she'd rather go elsewhere than go to Gourmet Oriental again lol. And now I know what the food and inside is like, so now I have my answer if I should  go there again or try delivery - a big NOPE!"},{"name":"Lima Criolla","address":"6406 N Interstate 35 Frontage Rd, Ste 1550","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Love the Peruvian ceviche.

I got the nerve up to get a lobster plopped onto my plate and cracked open the claw.  I got the meat out and was okay at first. I was taking my time with it.  As I started to work on the rest of it, I began to feel grossed out manhandling the lobster so I quietly put it back on my plate.  Everything isn't for everybody and that was alright with me.  \\n\\nWell, here comes Britt to the rescue asking if I needed assistance opening the rest of my lobster (with a hint of a patronizing tone) and before I could let any words leave my lips to reply, she picks up the lobster off my plate and starts cracking away and shoving the fork into the tail.

I was weary to try this place at first (given some of the negative reviews) but I figured I'd give it a shot and see how it is myself.\\n\\nI prefer to go there during lunch, since the all you can eat array is pretty much the same as dinner, just cheaper. When given the option, I would definitely add the AYCE Korean BBQ to your meal. You cook the BBQ meat yourself on the grill located in your table. Their website can be misleading about it though. Last I checked, it said the BBQ is only available on weekends, but you can still have it  on weekdays (for a couple extra dollars), just let them know you want it. \\n\\nThe BBQ (of various available meats like chicken, beef, pork, etc) is worth a try and it's a fun, interactive activity to do together with your family, friends, etc. The meat is tasty and you can try various kinds.The rolled sushi (maki) is solid. Their California rolls are different from what I'm used to (because they put lettuce and use big chunks of kani in them (instead of shredded kani), but they are good nonetheless. \\n\\nBe warned that they do have a limit on how many pieces of sashimi a person can order (I think it was 8 pieces allowed per person?). So if you want more fish than the 8 pieces, you may have to resort to their sushi. Which is fine too, but some diners may not like the chunk of rice the fish is slabbed over. \\n\\nSome dishes on the AYCE menu that are my favorites are the beef and chicken teriyaki (must haves for me), tomago (egg) sushi, spicy tuna cones, B.C. rolls, and avocado rolls. I'm not a fan of their spring rolls (they taste pretty generic and frozen tasting). And the times I've had their pork gyozas, they've been a bit over-cooked (dark exterior from being pan-fried too long). \\n\\nThe service is pretty good considering how busy the place gets. They're speeding with removing away your empty plates, but you have to take care to get their attention when you want to order more food. Which is pretty understandable, considering they're usually very busy. So don't be afraid to raise your hand or waive your order around a bit to get noticed. Subtle attempts to catch the attention of a server probably won't work because they're all hustling around. \\n\\nA big tip when wanting to eat here, MAKE A RESERVATION. They get very busy at lunch and at dinner, so unless you want to wait to be seated (could be a wait time from anywhere to a few minutes, to an hour plus). So, make a reservation beforehand and you'll be seated soon after checking in with the front staff. This place is definitely worth checking out.

The food was definitely decent but not four stars on its own. However, since I only had the lamb gyro with fries, I don't feel like I really know what they offer food wise. \\n\\nWhat did I like about the atmosphere? I thought you would never ask. There was a bit of a surprise factor there in that, this place is between a cvs and a cleaners. So you expect it to be tiny. It is tiny, however, they do a lot with a little space. The initial entry way has a couple of chairs which are primarily used by people who need to sit in the three or so minutes it takes to make their food. You get to see the food being made (which is cool) and smell it. Yum. And then, to the side, is a little cove with painted walls, music, b/w and sienna art work and cute little table and chairs. I dunno. I liked it. I could picture me having a mama mia moment in there. \\n\\nThe guy at the register was all smiles and very eager to make sure that I didn't think the wait was too long. I think he took my snooping around as pacing and was a little concerned. I also heard him be very patient with those notorious special order people. \\n\\nFinally, the gyro was good. I know tzaki (sp?) isn't supposed to have a ton of flavor and is mostly there for the creamy texture but I would have liked a little more flavor. Otherwise the fries, bread, and meat were good.

The restaurant's decor is way better than their service. I understand that there will be flaws, such as mediocre service and longer wait for food, during their grand opening, but diners shouldn't have to wait 2 hours for their food. We sat down and waited fifteen minutes before we had to wave a server down to get us tea. Someone should've came to us sooner and we shouldn't have to wave someone down. It took us another 15 minutes before we had to yet AGAIN wave a server down to put our order in. Okay so we placed our order and the first 2 entrees (out of 5) came in 30 minutes. That is quite a long wait....... but what was even worse was that we literally waited another hour for the rest of our entrees to come out while we had to watch bigger parties that came after us get their food first. Okay what?! Seriously?! We waved our server down and she told us she forgot so we told her we don't want it anymore but she was like nooooo we're making it right now and sounded super annoyed. Okay, not professional. How are you gonna forget about our food and make us wait even longer when we just want to pay and get out??? So we waited another 20 minutes for our entrees to get here, expecting the remaining 3 to come out, but only 2 came out. Okay wtf. By now it was nearing the 2 hour mark since we've been there. \\n\\nBUT LONG STORY SHORT: We got there at 6PM and didn't leave until 8:30PM because they kept prioritizing bigger parties first. Not to mention, they forgot about our food many times and we had to wave our server down ALL THE TIME. We even saw some smaller tables leave without paying because they probably waited longer.\\n\\nI MEAN COME ON. People have things to do. Time is precious. Don't waste our time and expect us to wait even longer for your mishaps.

I was always told by my grandfather that some of the best food can be found in the local hole in the wall type of places.  So I did not let this deter me from trying this place.  \\n\\nThe service was very pleasant.  Our wait staff was friendly and courteous.  They were also very quick and attentive to our needs which was very nice.  Our waitress took our drink orders and asked if we wanted appetizers, and returned with our drinks in a timely manner.  (only one of us ordered the margarita and I was advised it was no Maudies Margarita...)  \\n\\nThe prices on the menu were reasonable, and there was a fair selection of food items in which to try.  Our orders were made, and the dinners were also served in a timely manner.  \\n\\nThe plate presentation was rather bland, nothing too exciting in that department.  I ordered the mixed grill plate, to be honest I was very disappointed in it completely.  There was next to nothing about this that was spicy.  Actually it was very bland.  The beef fajitas were tough and hard to chew and the chicken fajitas were like cardboard (and tasting like cardboard to boot.)  The grilled onions were very raw, barely even seeing any real grill time.  The sausage was dry and over done, and the wrapped shrimp was extremely tough/leathery and unappetizing to eat. The rice served with this plate was bland and overly done.  Now the beans that came with the plate were very good.  I did enjoy them, and was the only thing that I ate completely.  \\n\\nMy other family members had similar complaints about their dishes, and several of us actually suffered from some sour stomachs later on in the evening time.  Which begs to question the quality of the food and preparation of our food that evening.  \\n\\nAll in all, I have to give this establishment two stars... I could not in good faith give it a single star.  The wait staff did an excellent job in tending to our needs, and were very charismatic.  As for the food, well I could only rate it as a single star.  I cannot say that I will return to this place again after tonight.  I would have to really think about it...  I have read some of the other diners reviews of this place. Some of which are very mixed.  Mostly though, the food is getting some moderate to bad reviews, while it seems that the service has some really good reviews.  So I guess if you are looking to find a place that sells some fairly decent appetizers and have some half way decent get together time, El Mercardo would be a nice place to go, but do not expect much more than that."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"great cannolis! long ass line! not from boston, but read about this place in travel guides, good place to try. \\n\\nnever had a cannoli, and this was my first time. looooove it."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Wow wow wow!

Overall Experience - 2.\\n\\nI was super excited to try this place. We went for lunch today, 9/1, on our lunch break for my birthday. I prefaced when we sat down this was all 4 people's first time at the establishment. Note, when we sat down, there was only one other table in the place.\\n\\nWe ordered the Bistec a la Pobre, Pollo Saltado Limeno and two of the Vegetarian Platters. We had probably been sitting for a solid 15 minutes before the waitress came over and said \\"we have no quinoa for the vegetarian platters, but we can do a fried rice instead\\". Both people said that's fine- but we were all confused as to how it took at least 15 minutes after an order was placed to realize you have no quinoa....\\n\\nWe waited, and we checked our watches, another 10 minutes before the steak and chicken dish came out.....and then we sat. And waited, and waited. No vegetarian platters. I made eyes with the waitress at least 3 times, and rather than come over and apologize or offer something to hold us over or even refill our waters which were all empty....she chose to ignore the problem, aka us. And yes there were now other tables...3. With two waitresses.\\n\\nIt was another 10 minutes before the vegetarian platters came out making the total wait 35 minutes....and instead of simply subbing in fried rice for quinoa they just brought out a pile of rice with some steamed broccoli and peppers. What??!!! We were all so confused but at this point had to shove the food down our throats and get back to the office. \\n\\nThis place is around the corner, and had the potential to get a lot of business from us but it'd be pretty hard to get my colleagues to go back- although my steak dish and the chicken dish were pretty tasty, and I liked their hot sauce.

This place was in my opinion, just average. I guess you shouldn't expect good Italian in Denver after hanging out in NYC or San Diego. \\n\\nThere was four of us for dinner tonight. We were seated promptly at our reservation time and our table was very large and accommodating for us. We ordered appetizers first. The Caprese salad appetizer was smaller at this place than at similar places and was also $10 which was overpriced in my opinion. 3 average sized meatballs appetizer was $6. Overpriced for three smaller than average meatballs in red sauce. \\nWe ordered 4 entrees, 3 of which came out in a normal amount of time. I ordered the wild boar with pasta. It was decent and a decent sized portion. I didn't have a lot of meat in the dish and for $16, was a little overpriced. The couple we were with had one of the specials that was a seafood and pasta dish and the other one had veal Parmesan. Both of their meals were just OK they said. The pasta seafood dish was way overpriced for the amount of seafood in the pasta. \\nMy wife's entr√©e didn't come out until probably 5 to 7 minutes after everybody else got their food. Not a long time in general but seems like forever when you're at a restaurant. It was kind of awkward. When she finally did receive her dish which was the LASAGNA BOLOGNESE, It was way overly salty. I prompted her to send it back, but she has a fear of doing that at restaurants. She ate about a third of it and push the rest away I tried it and was overwhelmed by the amount of salt in this lasagna. They must've spilled the saltshaker. Obviously nobody tasted the lasagna dish before serving it. If they did, they would've obviously known that there was way too much salt in there. \\nThe service was decent and I would say average. Although the second beer I ordered took a long time to get to me. When it finally did, all the foam had dissipated and there was about 2 inches on the top of the glass empty.

Seated us exactly at the right time, even though the restaurant was fairly full when we got there.\\nVery large menu with lots of appetizers and specialty cheeses. Also a supplemental special menu that I would assume is changed daily.\\nYou can sit at the bar to eat and watch them cook.\\nThey leave you a bottle of water on the table so you can fill your own glass. Why doesn't every restaurant do that?\\n\\nCons:\\nFood was so-so. Wife's lasagna was too salty to eat. Our other dishes were described as just OK.

With all the other great options to choose from, I can see why this place was a ghost town at brunch this morning.  \\n\\nWe went downtown to be amongst the people, so we thought Lamberts would have a happening scene.  Man, this place was awful today.  We showed up at 11:30 and there were only people at one table.  The place was empty.  The host sat us right next to the only other people in the restaurant.  The seats are already uncomfortably close to each other, so we didn't understand why he sat us there with all the other tables in the restaurant.  We asked to be moved, which they gladly accommodated.  \\n\\nAfter moving tables, we sat there for at least 5 minutes without a greeting.  Again, the restaurant was EMPTY!  I finally asked the host if he could send a server by so we could order.  When she showed up, I believe her name was Leighton, she had the worst scowl on her face.  I couldn't tell if she was pissed that we had to ask for her, or if she was just having a bad day.  She was snarky and rude the entire meal, and clearly wasn't happy to be at work this morning.  When she dropped our check off after we paid, she put it down and walked off without saying a word.  We only tipped her 15%, which was 15% more than she deserved.  If I owned this restaurant and had a cancer in my organization like her, I would fire her immediately before she poisoned the well further.  We didn't see a single manager the entire time we were there, giving us the impression that they're asleep at the wheel.  \\n\\nAs for the food, it was nothing to write home about.  Lamberts is known for being pricey, but they just aren't worth it these days.  The benedict was $18, and it came with a salad dressed in vinegar.  ??????  The eggs were good, but you can get a benedict anywhere in town for less money and better service than Lamberts.  Lastly, you leave the restaurant smelling like a bbq pit b/c of all the smoke.

My husband said it was the worst part of our trip to Boston. \\n\\nLet me start by saying that I grew up in an italian american neighborhood in Chicago and good cannolis were all around.  My husband and I now live in a similar neighborhood, still in Chicago, where a good cannoli is just a short walk away.  We are definitely not cannoli snobs here but we know what we like. \\n\\nWe went to Mike's on NYE after having dinner across the street.  The line (or people fighting to be waited on) wasn't bad.  We are from a big city and understand how to deal with crowds.\\n\\nI was a little confused by the cannoli flavors as we waited in line.  I felt like possibly a cannoli purest because I've never seen cannolis with flavors like fruits, oreo, lobster etc.  Standard Chicago cannoli - ricotta with choc chip filling and pistachios on the edges.  The only major variances from that are choc chips on the edges and possibly a choc dipped shell.  However, I was soo excited because these odd flavored cannolis at Mike's looked huge and delicious.\\n\\nWe opted for two cannolis - one pistachio and one chocolate dipped.  We were excited to find a spot to eat them.  Everything was perfect until the first bite.  What ... no chocolate chips in the inside.  Ok, hmm!  Next, a greasy taste from the shell.  Hmm again.  And no sweetness at all.  The ricotta filling was really bland tasting.  I was glad I asked the girl to put powder sugar on them so we got a little sweet flavor.  \\n\\nAgain, I wonder if we just went on an off night or if the cannolis in Chicago are completely different than they are on the east coast. \\n\\nI do hope to go back one day and try it again (for full disclosure - my husband disagrees with that statement)!"},{"name":"Tew-Mac Tavern","address":"1880 Main St","city":"Tewksbury","stars":"4","text":"Great food, awesome martinis (the espresso martini is the best I have ever had!) and the staff is very friendly!!

They have a very nice beer selection and perfect size paper bags for camouflaging your libation. Sushi A-Go-Go kindly requests this and I say hey, fair enough! :-)\\n\\nThe seating consists of 4-5 picnic tables with umbrellas and some string lights. Don't miss out on this spot or their new location downtown. It's sooooo goooood! I'm giving 4 stars because they don't have appropriate size saucers for the soy sauce which also comes in little packets. We had the Texas Roll, Dynamite Roll, and a Mango Salmon Roll. All were fantastic, especially the Texas Roll! The pricing is great - under $20 for 2 people and we had 3 rolls! I know that Maru is also nicely priced but I would take Sushi A-Go-Go over Maru anyday. It's simply tastier in my experience."},{"name":"Modern Pastry Shop","address":"257 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"mmmmmm! such a cute logo, and such good italian bakery yummys!\\nso much better than mike's, which has a constant long line and a lot of hype. modern has amaing cannolis and creme puffs and everything you can imagine. \\na great diet breaker and cute ambiance."},{"name":"Linh Caf√© - French Cooking","address":"2836 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Sorry but this place is over-rated and expensive.

It's fusion food that is just Asian enough to make you feel like you're eating something exotic without taking you out of your comfort zone.\\n\\nHowever, it wasn't my cup of tea. I had never eaten at a Ming Tsai establishment, but I expected more based on reputation. First, the good things we ordered: clams with udon, steak with umami butter, and skillet cookie. These were the dishes that I might come back and eat again because they offered good flavors and were well-prepared. The clams with udon were definitely my favorite, along with the skillet cookie - which isn't Asian, but it isn't trying to be either, so I was ok with it.\\n\\nThe other dishes we ordered were depressing. The tempura fried chicken wasn't a delicate Japanese tempura - it was thick, dark brown batter on a bland chicken that was definitely bred for size and not flavor. They served it with orange duck sauce and chili sauce - which kind of drove home that suburban Chinese takeout vibe for me. The duck fried rice was sticky, brown, and had undercooked, hard rice - a huge departure from the fluffy, light yellow fried rice I grew up with in Chinatown. I don't know how they messed up fried rice, but it was the worst thing we ordered.\\n\\nI kept switching between chopsticks, fork & knife, and eating with my hands. My tiny plate was a mess with chicken bones, sauce, and clam shells. The experience was just sort of jumbled overall too.

I do agree that it might be over cooked, but still thinking about the price, it's okay.

First off this hotel and the surroundings look absolutely nothing like they do on the website. This place is nothing if not outdated. The staff is not helpful and have not paid any attention to me. After arriving and waiting two hours in my room was still not ready and I was standing there with groceries that were melting they finally decided to upgrade me. If this room is the upgraded room I am scared to know what the regular room looks like. The whole hotel looks like something from The 60s and not in a really cool hip way it looks like really nothing has been replaced or cleaned since the 60s. Low popcorn ceilings, beat up furniture, nasty carpets. There were even expired Coors light beer cans in the refrigerator. The water in the lobby was out. An elevator was out of order. Nothing vegetarian on the menu in the restaurant or in room service. I could go on and on but you get the point. Do not look at the website and think this is what you will be getting. The only thing this hotel would be good for is an episode of antique roadshow and a study on how not to treat people for customer service.

I'm no expert in cannoli. I'm not even Italian, but the cannoli I've tried in other places have never impressed me much. I've always found it to be an ok dessert/pastry.

Highly recommend this particular cannoli (I can't speak for many other treats there, except for the few different treats my kids had--which didn't impress-- and the different cannolis they had--which were just ok).

He would give us recommendations for his favorites and for the \\"most popular\\". His favorites were hands down the winners of our choices. \\n\\nI also like that their characters (Penelope and Toothsome) were very interactive with the crowd. My kid (10yrs old) really ate that up and loved this place. \\n\\nAppetizer-- I had the avocado toast, which was good for someone who LOVES avocado as there is A LOT of it. The dish also had a light balsamic glaze drizzled on top and a few tomatoes. But IMO, the dish lacked flavor. It has potential but needs something with more of a punch. Maybe a seasoning on top? To be fair our waiter suggested the hummus or the Brussels and we chose to try something else ÔøΩ?Main-- we had the grilled teriyaki salmon which turned out to be some of the BEST salmon I've had. It was light but flavorful. 6oz portion, man I could've eaten double!! The veggies were good and we subbed mash potatoes for rice. Staff was happy to sub sides for whatever we liked with a ton of options. This dish was suggested and the waiter claimed it to be his favorite. I can see why. It's a nice light meal before the overindulgent dessert options. He also raved about the super food salad which we did not try.\\nDessert-- I was undecided so I went with his favorite (again a winner!) which was the flourless chocolate cake and we subbed the Nutella ice cream for sour cream ice cream. His thought was that the Nutella is a tad overpowering to the sweetness of the cake. I would say I could agree to that after tasting it. The cake was amazing and the sour cream ice cream complimented it well. Think of sour cream ice cream as similar to the homemade mix you would make for cheese cake, light and tangy. Perfect with the super moist cake (reminds me of carnivals chocolate melting cake). Hands down this dessert was a 10! He also raves about the bread pudding. \\n\\nMy son got the brookie. And well it was an enormous plethora of sweets from ice cream to cookie brownies and whip and all sorts of jazz. Nothing special IMO because none of the flavors stood out. It just was a smorgasbord of sweets if that's what you're going for, personally, I prefer quality over quantity and for that reason I suggest the cake!\\n\\nDrinks- I only had one, the high fashioned. If you like an old fashioned, I mean a good strong one, this is for you. This is a sippable drink, not a chugable.

For some reason, I thought it was hash as in hash browns, but it was potatoes and salmon with this heavenly gravy-like sauce blanketed on top so while it certainly wasn't what I had expected, it was DEFINITELY delicious! The half order was smaller that I thought, but once I finished it, I realized that it was the perfect portion  I got the lemon lemon lemon for dessert, which was unfortunately underwhelming. The cake was so dense like I was raging clay and the flavor wasn't that great. The lemon sorbet it came with was delicious, though. Our server (I forgot his name) was awesome and gave me and and Marty of 6 incredible service! I will definitely be returning in the future, maybe just staying away from the desserts."},{"name":"Modern Pastry Shop","address":"257 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"So many choices!!!

The place is always slammed and thriving with hungry people being fed delicious plates off of steaming carts of deliciousness.  My friend is Chinese and although most of the staff appear to speak at least someEnglish, I've found that I'm better off leaving the ordering to him. I've enjoyed most everything I've tried and really the whole Dim Sum atmosphere is just exciting.  The food you order is on a price tier system, so your cards on stamped based on how expensive the time with be.  The dishes aren't too expensive so you can usually share several dishes and desserts and not end up spending too much.  I've found that Dim Sum tends to be more of a brunch concept but I've had it for dinner as well, which is fun too.

I agree with the other comments made by other customers such as it was an hour wait. After receiving a text message that a table was available, we still had to wait an additional 20 minutes or so before being seated to a table.  After being seated, it took about another 25 minutes before getting our food served. This process needs to be looked into and the management needs to get on top of this restaurant providing better service.\\n\\nOther than better service is required, the food also needs improvement. We ordered eggs, pancakes, toast, sausage and coffee. The coffee was brought to the table about 15 or 20 minutes later after placing the order. I had ordered only 1 pancake, but received 2. Both pancakes were cold. The toast was hard/cold and the butter never melted on it and the toast had a weird taste. The sausage didn't come with the order and we had to request it again which also had a weird taste. Overall, the food was not worth the long wait.\\n\\nAs an observation, a table of 6 came after we had placed our order. We were a table of only 2 people and the table of 6 received their order before us and they ordered more food. How is this possible? The napkins on the table were crumpled up instead of looking clean/flat. I noticed the busboy did not even clean the table next to us properly. Food was left on the table from the previous customer and the busboy put his hands/fingerprints all over the utensils and threw the utensils on the table, not even placing them on their crumpled up looking napkins. Should the busboy cleaning tables and picking up dirty dishes be handling utensils?\\n\\nThis was the first time we went there and we will never go to the place again. We have eaten at various places around the country and outside the country and the food was great/delicious and there weren't always  long waiting periods to be seated/served.

We usually go for the gyros since the craving for one is what brings us here. \\n\\nUnfortunately, the pita bread, fries, and Greek salad are just average. Pita is doughy but not warm, grilled, or otherwise seemingly prepared in house. Fries seem like any old fry from a food supply store. Thick cut and tasteless. The Greek salad is lacking quality and flavor featuring thick chunks of ice berg lettuce, kalamata olives with pits in them (so watch your teeth), a few feta chunks, but mostly lettuce. We've had better Greek salads at a deli. \\n\\nThe view from the out front patio is nice with a little sliver of Lake Ivanhoe looking back at you.

The patio, although open, the windows between the patio and the bar were closed. A nice warm evening in Atlanta and the windows are closed??? Until when? Oh when you get more people? That seems silly and takes away from patio/bar sitting experience for those that don't get there at 7pm.. The second shock was the nice little sign on the table that stated \\"Please enjoy this table for two hours ~ $75/per hour minimum for each additional hour.\\"  I'm sorry, but where am I, and what restaurant charges for ADDITIONAL HOURS??? The waitress claims people come and hang out without ordering anything. Ok, then kindly advise THOSE people you need the table for paying customers. But to put out signs like that? I was appalled and just disappointment in the way Strip chose to handle the situation. Maybe its me. \\n\\nStrip for food is ok. We go for sushi, but as I eat sushi in other places, Strip reminds me I just go there for the location and patio. They used to have a half price special on sushi on Thursdays but that been gone for some time.  Now it seems overpriced.

I had their take on a ham and cheese sandwich The Croque Monsieur - $14.95, Country ham, Gruyere cheese, French loaf toasted, grilled, topped with bechamel sauce it was excellent. We also had their Quiche, Broccoli Cheddar - $10.95 English colby cheddar, fresh broccoli, fresh fruit, and choice of side salad or soup, as was the kids chicken tenders. We ordered two drinks from the bar, one of their versions of an old fashioned and a chocolate cherry libation.  Both were good  The Revolutionary Old Fashion: Four Roses bourbon, cr√©me de framboise, Cointreau, sugar, Peychaud's bitters $11 was very tasty and not too sweet I almost ordered a second.  The Wicked Cherry: Mount Gay Black Barrel rum, cherry Heering liqueur, cr√©me de framboise, chocolate bitters $12 had an unexpectedly powerful cinnamon finish that was almost too much but was still tasty.

We also sampled some spicy boar ribs that were... well... oily and spicy, with a buffalo-type sauce and some blue cheese chunks. They had that distinct spicy buffalo flavor for sure. Good but not mind blowing, by any means. \\n\\nFor the main course, we enjoyed a platter of brisket and dry-rubbed BBQ chicken, sided by collards and some mac n cheese. The collards were, and I should take care not to offend when I say this, not as good as our collards in Portland. We have 3 or 4 places that make collards better. The mac, however, was so good we ordered more, much to the complaints of our arteries. But of course, the real deal, what it's all about, is the brisket. The inside slices were so juicy, tender, and smoky-delicious. \\n\\nNow I'm not well-traveled as far as brisket goes. I've had pulled pork in the SE, and some amazing ribs, chicken, and everything else, but all the brisket I've had in the PacNW is, well, marginal. It's been dry, gristly, or simply not good. I'm sure the locals may know of better brisket, but in my world, this was it. I basically took my share (it was served family style), and then looked nervously around to see if anyone was watching, so I could take more. So good. \\n\\nBut that's not all... the meat was served with 3 sauces - the House BBQ Sauce, a Cracked Mustard Sauce, and the Haba√±ero Hot Sauce - all of which were above par, but it was the mustard that blew my mind. It was like a cross between a hot mustard, a honey mustard, and a basic yellow mustard, but with a slight softness and a clean, delicious, seemingly somewhat sweet taste. The tang of the mustard was there, but the balance between hot, sweet, tangy, zingy and creamy was absolutely perfect. Had I thought about it, I would have asked for a bottle to go. I think I used about  1/2 of the small bottle we were given. I couldn't stop. I'd drink it straight if I could.

We put our name in for a table around 7:45 on a Saturday (during Spring Break) and were told it would be about an hour and 20 minute wait.  We expected a long wait, so we were not too concerned.  They were asking if we would be staying for dinner or just dessert, so apparently both are an option.  If you are just looking for dessert and don't want to wait, it looked like they also had a milkshake-to-go line, in addition to their chocolate shop at the front of the restaurant.\\n\\nWe walked around City Walk waiting for our tab and we received a text when our table was ready.  The text said they would hold the table for 5 minutes, so we walked back over to the restaurant to claim our spot. \\n\\nWe  ordered the Totchos as an appetizer.  The tots themselves were delicious, perfectly cooked, however there wasn't anything too special about the toppings.  They could have used more of the green chili sauce. \\n\\nFor dinner my husband ordered the burger and I ordered the Forest Mushroom Flatbread.  My flatbread was good, but again nothing special.  It needed just a little something else, maybe a balsamic drizzle, to take it from average to really good.\\n\\nWe were stuffed at this point, but we were at a Chocolate Emporium! We obviously HAD to have dessert and it absolutely had to be one of the milkshakes.  These are not ordinary milkshakes.   They come with outrageous toppings, such as entire cupcakes or cookies.   We decided on the Cookie Jar Milkshake, but I also had my eye on the Red Velvet one, which comes with an entire cupcake on top!  It was actually a better milkshake than I had even guessed.  It wasn't overly thick, great flavors and a delicious giant cookie on top. \\n\\nOverall, if I were to return I would probably just come for dessert. None of our food was bad, but the main dishes just weren't amazing. Dessert though? Fantastic."},{"name":"Mad Hatter","address":"969 Washington St","city":"Weymouth","stars":"4","text":"This place made the transition from small town breakfast to full size restauraunt with a bar and function room incredibly!

While having so many specialty food under one roof should scare you away - the Vietnamese owner/chef clearly takes pride in being a jack-of-all-trades.  To any pretentious people crying about 'inauthentic' Japanese food, you shouldn't care who is making it as long as the food is good.\\n\\nReplacing a god-awful yet-another-East-Van pizza-by-the-slice joint that used to stand here, this little place will have something to satisfy your craving for Asian food at any budget.\\n\\nWhile I assume this place would probably make some excellent Vietnamese food, I have yet to sample it as I dare not betray my loyalty to the Bao Chau/Le Petit Saigon duo further up the street.  Maybe one day when I'm sure no one is watching.\\n\\nMy usual is the ubiquitous takeout ~$8 multi-roll combo with miso soup - with unagi!  Tasty, filling and cheap.  While not gourmet by any means, the food is well-prepared, prices are good and the service is excellent.

I've been there the last  two Sunday evenings and perhaps there is a new chef. I ordered the green curry in supersize and asked for only vegetables instead of the meat or tofu.  I pay the same price as anyone else ordering green curry with meat/tofu which comes with eggplant and some vegetables.   So for the past two weeks they decided to only give me a small  amount of vegetables. I guess the idea of substituting does not register with them. I would've thought they would have given me more vegetables as I wasn't having any meat. Even the amount of green curry was less.  I mentioned it to them but they didn't seem to care or understand.  Also I think they've decided to add some more fish sauce and garlic. Not a big fan of the fish sauce as I'm generally vegetarian.  And throwing lots of garlic on food is low brow and shows a lack of cooking skill. Also, I asked for no eggplant and they just decided to remove it and not add any extra veggies. So I ended up with green curry and a smattering of vegetables. I've been there many times before and I think that the one of the owners was working there. At that time, she was very decent and made sure I got lots of vegetables instead of the meat or tofu and eggplant.  I noticed there seems to be a different chef there on during the last two weekends.   I can only give them one star for this service and food.

I really wouldn't ever order food from there again, there have been multiple issues where they have left prepared food on the shelves that should of been tossed (probably to save money - but that is money saved on your health expense!)

I even buffered the time and ordered it earlier than I would need it, just to be sure I could just run in. I showed up and was told that they received the order, but didn't make it because someone from Uber Eats had also ordered and had the same first name. That didn't make sense to me because when I looked at their order, they had ordered something completely different. I had also paid for the order already, they just chose not to make it. But whatever. He tells me they'll make it now. I go sit down. The place is absolutely dead, very few people, so I grab an empty table to sit and wait. Then a female employee comes over and extremely rudely tells me to move and that she's assigned the table to someone else. She doesn't tell me that I can sit anywhere else and is just extremely put out with me. I hadn't even said anything at that point. I got frustrated and said that I wasn't the one who had messed up the ordering and didn't understand why I couldn't at minimum just sit down and wait. She proceeded to repeat that I couldn't sit there. I finally asked where I COULD sit. She then relented and let me sit at a nearby empty table. I repeat, the restaurant was almost empty. It was all so silly.\\n\\nA male employee comes over and tells me he's refunded my order, which was nice. But I had been waiting for awhile at that point and I kind of think he just offered it because he may have seen the altercation with the female employee. I told him what happened and he told me that she was having a stressful day or something. I get that, truly. But how hard is it to just be nice? All she had to do was kindly say that she had reserved the table, but would I like to sit somewhere else? \\n\\nI mean by the time I got my burger I didn't even want it, the whole situation was ridiculous and unnecessary.

You get not one but two salsas with your chips and they were both quite good. The rice and beans that come with the meal are also pretty flavorful. My meal itself was kind of just ok. I got the steak tacos al carbon. The meat was cooked well and the sauce was ok but it lacked freshness. Even just a spring of fresh cilantro would have been great and the tortillas tasted sort of strange. The ceviche was unfortunately the real disappointment. They completely doused it in two different sauces that were thick and overpowering. I felt like I was just eating sauce and the seafood was completely lost. Worst ceviche I've ever had and honestly just a shame. Around the table I heard equal praise or disappointment depending on the dish, just seemed real hit and miss depending on what you order.

This restaurant is aesthetically pleasing to the eye but don't be fooled by it! I came here for a birthday dinner. Upon my arrival my party wasn't here, so I chose to sit at the bar and while I waited for 20 minutes, not one single person came to ask me if I would like anything to drink. Once our party arrived, it took another 20 minutes to be seated. Mind you, the restaurant was not full. By this time, I could have taken my shoe off and eaten it, I was that hungry and it took another 20 minutes to get menus. I ordered a Caesar Salad with Shrimp and Seared Blackened Tuna. When our dinner came, I looked down at the Seared Blackened Tuna and it looked like my 3 year old got ahold of a knife to slice the tuna. The presentation was awful! In addition, the tuna smelled like it was sun bathing for the last 8 hours and it wasn't seared, but rather over cooked. The Shrimp Ceasar Salad tasted like a TGI Fridays Ceasar salad and out of the 7 people at my table, 6 returned their dinner. All complained that their food had no flavor and tasted worse than a microwavable dinner! Thank God I brought birthday cupcakes, if not we'd all would have starved! This restaurant is lucky to even get one star! The staff was extremely rude and made our dining experience quite unpleasant! I asked if we could speak to a Manager or Owner and our waitress said, \\"He is very aware of what's going on\\". But no one came to our table to talk to us. The bathrooms also smelled like urine and you could smell the kitchen as you walked to the bathrooms and the smell was awful.

As we waited for our order, people continued to come in and out of the place, leaving with to-go orders and grabbing a couple triangles for a quick lunch.

The third and final time dining here, my partner and I sat at the bar for lunch. The staff and service were super awesome and helpful. What happened next has nothing to do with Mother's, but the people within the restaurant. While going to the bathroom, my partner (a female who presents a bit masculine) was called out by an older white woman for using the women's restroom. The woman proceeded to explain why she didn't belong in there and how she was making everybody (only her) uncomfortable completely ruined not only my partner's day, but mine as well. This is the reason some people (in my partners situation) turn to suicide. Acceptance is key. I know that situations like this occur and you as a restaurant can't control this, but this is Portland we're living in. If you support the trans/non binary community, maybe you could offer a non-gender restroom option. Especially when your main clientele seem to be white cis 1%r's. I don't know. Maybe think about it.

The staff is you classic Italian family  - the woman who got my cannolis cracked me up as she was telling me about her daughters (who also work there) and their boy problems. It reminded me of my own family!\\n\\nI ordered the Amaretto cannoli for myself and took home three for my family: the peanut butter, the espresso, and the chocolate chip. I got them all with powdered sugar (sugar on top of sugar? I think YES!!).\\n\\nThe Amaretto barely made it out of the store. As soon as I got outside, I began to devour. The cannoli was HUGE and LOADED with ricotta. The filling in this one tasted like it was infused with amaretto, giving it a nutty and distinct taste that I found delicious. The shell was soft and crunchy at the same time, and I loved the hint of chocolate from the drizzle. \\n\\nMy friend likes their lobster claws, which are apparently pretty popular here. I tried some of hers (which was also GIGANTIC), and it reminded me of a cream puff - flaky, doughy pastry with a sweet cream filling.

I question why need 2 scrambled eggs instead of something else?\\n- Can be very crowded in lobby and checkin, as this hotel hosts a lot of conventions and meetings. \\n- Budget a little extra time at rush hours for elevators, which can be tricky to navigate. \\n- If the fire alarm goes off, prepare for total shutdown for quite a while even after intercom says everything is OK. I once walked down 29 flights because elevators were paused.\\n\\nTips:\\n- Request 28 floor or higher if you plan to visit Concierge Lounge, since elevators on lower floors do not go straight to lounge floor. If you end up being on lower floors, taking the fire escape stairs can be quicker than going all the way down to lobby and back up. \\n- Staircase connects 28 and 29. (Of course there is also the fire escape staircase connecting all floors.)\\n- Amenities are more complete on Concierge Floors (28 & 29) - robe, liquid hand soap, etc. \\n- Every room has a fridge - doesn't look like it, but it is under the TV. What appears to be a drawer is actually a cabinet. \\n- If you order food (GrubHub, Seamless), it is delivered straight to your room. No need to go downstairs. \\n- Hotel is connected to 2 malls, once in each direction. In winter, this is helpful as it cuts down the time you need to walk outside. \\n- Starbucks on 2nd floor is slower and less complete than Starbucks at Westin hotel (short walk through Copley Sq Mall)."},{"name":"Kick Butt Coffee","address":"5775 Airport Blvd, Ste 725","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I've been sitting here for the past 2 hours working on a term paper and I thought I'd take a quick break to write about this place.

Pretty much everything I've had here has been good, and the quantity matches or exceeds the price. They even recently remodeled and slightly expanded the interior. I do like how most of the food is already made, so even if there is a long line, you still receive your food in a timely manner.\\n\\nMy wish is for the improvement on service. It can vary, and staff appear to have changed frequently over the years we have been here. And tonight when we dined, they close at 9 pm, but they were selling out of a lot of foods by 8 pm. However, when a customer tried to eat in the dining area around 8:15 pm, they said the lobby area was closed. When we were still eating, they were already cleaning up the dining area and putting up chairs. When we left at 8:30 pm, they closed the main gate in the front, making the restaurant appear closed altogether. I just think if you close at 9 pm, you should close at 9 pm. \\n\\nParking can be tricky during busy hours (especially Sunday afternoons).

We went with the Candied Bacon Maple, Cinnamon Sugar, Raw Honey with Sea Salt, and Blackberry Lavender.  My favorite was the Blackberry Lavender. It had a strong lavender flavor which was balanced well by the sweetness of the Blackberry glaze. The Candied Bacon Maple has a very strong bacon flavor but it is a little too sweet to have more than two. Raw Honey with Sea Salt was good as well.

I usually get forced to one of the suburban locations, go to different dim sum spot, or, better yet, hold out until one of my trips to Los Angeles. Growing up, however, this was the spot my family would go for dim sum, always remembering those lengthy waits for a table and not settling to share one (because other parties do steal your own food, hehe). In high school, you'd eat almost anything edible, especially after a long wait. \\n\\nI came here recently for a business meeting and my expectations weren't all that high. The meeting was strategically mid-week and before the lunch crowd so it was dead quiet, save for a few older Chinese folks. There was no FOH and we just awkwardly fetched a table for ourselves. The new decor doesn't really impress me a whole lot. Fake trees? \\n\\nI kept it simple and did ha gao and siu mai. Well, they weren't horrific but definitely sub-par. The ha gao's filling was passable but the dumpling skin was as thick as Donald Trump's infamous hair. You can immediately tell if a dim sum place is good by the ha gao dumpling skin. The siu mai was warm but lacking in a whole lot of character. Overall, both dumplings felt overly starchy and sat in my stomach like an anchor.\\n\\nFor whatever reason, and I kinda don't want to know, the ha cheung tasted tart. The sauce is soy sauce, the rice noodle neutral, and the shrimp slightly sweet, so what gives? That shouldn't be the case. So far, I haven't felt any ill effects, but if you don't see posts from me for while, you'll know why.\\n\\nThe beef tripe provided minimum spice and maximum oiliness. There wasn't a sign of hot peppers in the tripe. \\n\\nI didn't stay for dessert, and there wasn't much offered to begin with. I had to make some special orders for some basic dishes (like plain cheung fun).

We also ordered the Thai BBQ Short Ribs which was extremely disappointing and tasted like it had been in a crock pot for 3 days.  Absolutely no moisture or flavor, except for the taste of burnt meat.  It was black on the outside and a waste of $18. Really disappointing.

Immediately, it peeked my interest when I read the decals on the lobster car that said \\"Boston Lobster Feast AYCE\\". I quickly jotted down the number to the restaurant and started to do my research on this so-called lobster feast. We quickly signed up for the email notifications as they advertised that they offer a birthday coupon so we waited until it was one of our birthdays and surely enough we received a coupon in our inbox. \\n\\nUpon arriving to the restaurant, our servers was super nice! I was a bit skeptical about how the service was going to be since it was located in the touristy area on International Drive. Usually places with lots of tourists from my experience have been a hit or miss for great customer service. To my surprise, not this place! They were friendly and our waitress went out of her way to make sure our first time here was memorable. \\n\\nSo how it works here is you pay a set price and it's AYCE including the whole lobsters. I wish the lobsters were precut so that it was easier to eat the tails but that didn't stop us from eating over 15 lobsters across two people. Let's just say you definitely eat your money's worth at this place. They offer a wide variety of seafood from lobster to a raw oyster bar. They limit you to one lobster per trip to the buffet lines, I think it's to prevent excess waste. The quality of the lobsters here are not the best but they do satisfy my seafood lover cravings. I was also excited to see that they have a dessert bar with an ice cream stand as well. \\n\\nThe downside to this place is the restrooms. They could use some TLC that's for sure. Overall, I would come back to this place for another birthday celebration or special occasion. It's worth the price tag for AYCE lobster, seafood is already expensive as it gets so including lobster tails is definitely appealing."},{"name":"Thai Basil","address":"1215 Thurlow St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Great place for quick, cheap and pretty good Thai takeout.

The hostess claimed she sent out a text to let us know we would be ready and to cash out any checks. At that moment, i received said text and cashed out. Continuing to wait another 45 minutes we all went to ask the hostess Ami if there was a problem. She laughed at me and claimed she forgot. Manager Alex and other manager (didn't get his name) said our bay was available as Ami proceeded to laugh and walk into the back. I then asked why we had to wait 2 and a half hours at this point when the venue was empty. They apologized and said they would give us a free hour of game time. Which was very appreciative. Server Audrey was just as great as Jason. Super nice, friendly and attentive as well. When we got our checks, i guess our complimentary hour didn't show on the check. My friends talked to the manager and fixed it. Although Audrey and Jason were amazing, i had a poor experience with the wait time, hostesses and hurting myself on two different areas of the venue.

The soup base is what elevates this dish from your standard pho--the chunks of crab roe melt in your mouth and add so much depth to the tomato broth. The vermicelli is thicker than usual, has some bounce to it, and retains the flavour of the soup well. It is topped w/ a variety of ingredients, namely Vietnamese pork ham, pork leg (I only had one slice in my soup though), shrimp, tofu, tomatoes, and a side of bean sprouts, chili peppers, and lemon. \\n\\nThe portion size of the Shrimp Salad Roll was larger than I expected, being two long rolls cut into four total. To my pleasant surprise, we were also given two peanut sauces to dip to our heart's content. This was much welcomed as salad rolls on their own tend to be bland. Though I found this Salad Roll to be average, I did enjoy the fact that each component could be tasted in one bite: the vermicelli, shrimp, lettuce, mint, and bean sprouts. \\n\\nWhile I wasn't expecting much for service, it would've been nice to at least get a response after placing our order.

I just put romantic and Jewish in the same sentence. Tiger, pay attention. This place makes my list for top 10 restaurants in Boston. The decor is rustic and authentic. The waiters are super attentive and have amazing memories (like how wives never forget that you cheated on them). After my third visit, the waiters remembered me and were very enthusiastic and were joking around with me as if we were buddies. This might not seem like much to you, but as a person who has a lack of human contact thanks to TV, the internet and the Wii, this melts my heart.\\n\\nOk, so how about the food? The key to this place is their use of creative ingredients that turn old classics into standout new favorites. Their breakfast is out of this world. The homemade apple sauce is revolutionary. The empire eggs (Two poached eggs, spinach, smoked salmon on potato pancakes, Hollandaise) is a must try. Their eggs benedict are just as good as the empire eggs but more traditional (canadian bacon instead of smoked salmon and english muffin instead of potato pancake). Do NOT get their omelets... this place has way better offerings than that.\\n\\nMy friend got the cheese blintzes and absolutely loved them. On previous occasions, I got the hot pastrami sandwich which is the best I've had outside of New York and LA.

Ever since they were named one of \\"10 Best Delis in America\\" by National Geographic, they increased their prices. Really? National Geographic? They are known for their wild safari animals and nude tribal photos and their recommendation leads to a price bump? Whatever... you have me hooked Zaftigs.

I was really looking forward to the brussel sprouts and kale (6/10), but I found that their seasoning was a little bit light... Delicious though, all the same. The brussel sprouts were cooked to the perfect level of doneness. Finally, the dish that I measure so many Japanese restaurants by, the assorted tempura (9.5/10), which were simply as good as tempura gets. The batter was ever so light and crispy, and you could see the vegetables clearly through it.\\nIt's not fancy, in fact they have cafeteria style service where you order at the register and pay right away before you eat. If you're looking for a fancy sit-down, this is not your place. But if you're out with a few friends for a quick meal, before you go to a movie, this would be an ideal little joint. The staff were very friendly, and brought the food out so piping hot that it would burn your mouth. You can't ask for more than that. The little restaurant was very clean, and well tended to.

His bill was 150 and now he's spending more money on ER visit. Antibiotics and labs. Sick as a dog after leaving that place. \\n\\nWaste of what could be an amazing restaurant. \\nI will say I voiced my opinion to the manager about the poor service and his solution was to remove the gratuity fee. Even though I appreciate the discount I feel bad the waiter had to take the hit. She was young and overwhelmed. maybe it's a staffing issue then again while trying to take care of the bill there were like 7 hostess standing around... \\n\\nI give the restaurant 2 stars because of the view instead of suing"},{"name":"The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium And Savory Feast Kitchen","address":"Universal CityWalk Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"You didn't click on this for my review of the food so I won't bore you long.

The soup everyone be raves about is just a heavy overly salty baked potato soup.  Our other food was decent.  Not exceptional, but not worth complaining about it.  My husband did seem to enjoy his steak.  The menus are paper, the tables are similar tables to what you find at every counter service.  You are packed in like sardines to a dark dingy space.

We've celebrated many a birthday at Disney before... with cupcakes, plates with ice cream and happy birthday written on them, complementary desserts, so I just assumed this would be the same . It was not.  By the time I realized this the check arrived and my kids did not get to sing happy birthday over dessert to their dad.  Lesson learned.... I guess I'm supposed to order one of the $75 dollar cakes.  This restaurant ended what just wasn't a magical Disney experience.  After 35 visits, Disney May have lost its magic for me.

Go to Cowfish instead across Citywalk for better food and actual genuinely good milkshakes. The thing was this confetti cake \\"milkshake\\" was just awful and one of the worst things I ever had the displeasure to drink. After paying a hefty $13, we couldn't even drink this concoction and left it nearly untouched. What made it worst though is that we talked to 2 servers and 1 manager who just didn't care about customer service at all or righting a wrong. \\n\\nThis was my first time at Toothsome and the milkshake was a \\"must eat\\" at Universal. I shared a salad and flatbread with my friend, both of which were very good. We decided to try the Confetti Cake milkshake, which is one of the new flavors. When it came, it looked picture perfect. But the lesson here is looks can be deceiving. Once my friend lifted the cup to take the first sip, she noticed right away that the cup felt suspiciously light. Being that there was a full cake slice and the cup should've been filled with a milkshake, you would expect there to be some weight to hold. But it was suspiciously light. \\n\\nAfter taking the first sip, I noticed this \\"milkshake\\" was wrong. First, nothing came up out of the straw. Second, I just got the whipped cream. Third, I finally got to the \\"shake\\" and it was just more whipped frosting that tasted like confetti cake. I asked my friend to try and she immediately thought the vanilla ice cream of the shake was forgotten. When you drink a shake, you expect a creamy and thick consistency of your drink, but it genuinely tasted like only flavored whip cream through a straw. It was the same constancy as the whipped cream below the confetti cake. \\n\\nWe shared with our server that we thought the ice cream was missing because it tasted so bad and unlike a milkshake. She only explained that the cake confetti flavor is a \\"lighter\\" milkshake than the espresso or chocolate ones. That's a fair point but there is a difference between a vanilla dessert tasting lighter than chocolate and our milkshake not even tasting like a milkshake. We tried to explain to no avail. She was not the most helpful server with no attempt to rectify the situation. We didn't want to drink just sugary cake confetti flavored frosting so we didn't drink the rest of it. \\n\\nAs we were heading down the stairs, another server asked us how our meal was and we told him about our terrible drink. He was surprised because he said others who had the confetti cake thought it was filling and delicious, so it was odd we both thought the drink was so airy to the point of tasting like nothing but frosting. He offered to walk us down to speak with the manager downstairs. \\n\\nFinally we were speaking with the manager to tell us our concerns that our \\"milkshake\\" was made incorrectly and missing the vanilla ice cream component. This manager simply kept repeating that this is a light milkshake. And that he was sure the milkshake was fine. \\n\\n\\nThis is what was the most frustrating aspect of this experience. Three different Toothsome employees paid no mind in helping us customers have a better experience. This isn't to sound arrogant that the customer should demand any wish and be granted it, but I would've loved to have tasted the delicious Confetti Cake milkshake they promised everyone else has had or a different one of their concoctions. Or because the \\"shake\\" was so to our dissatisfaction, taking it off the bill. I've never been to a restaurant where the staff doesn't do its best to see all of its customers leaving happy.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, dreadful confetti cake milkshake and uncaring customer service."},{"name":"Pizza Day","address":"10225 Research Blvd, Ste 110","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"My husband and I had been planning on eating at Jason's Deli next door but saw a sign for an organic pizza and thought we'd check it out.

The filling was still delicious and amazing but it lacked the umph of the crispy, crunchy, handmade shell.

The Millennium Harvest Boulder was such a disappointing experience that it forced this exception. Our reason for selecting this venue was its proximity to Folsom Field, home of the CU Buffs. It's shameful that a hotel within walking distance of the stadium should diminish the great American experience of FBS college football. \\n\\nThe hotel is in disrepair. There are 3 elevator doors in lobby but during our stay only one set of doors would open to an operating lift. The lobby itself is rather ho hum drab with few places to sit and relax. Our room was plagued by multiple deficiencies including but not limited to : a bathroom door that did not close properly, multiple impaired electric outlets, a heater not much good at keeping us warm and a very uncomfortable pull out coach. When booking I confirmed there was a restaurant, we wanted to have dinner before walking to the game. However, in lieu of a closed restaurant there was a low class outside Gazebo tail gate offering booze, hot dogs and chips in very uncomfortable temperatures. Even accounting for Game Night our room would have been robbery at $100 but we paid much more. \\n\\nThe good news is 2 fold: #1 the staff despite our disappointment in the hotel and room were professional and friendly. They did their best. #2 The Buffs beat the UCLA Beach Boy Bruins 38-16! The next time we travel to see the Buffs, we'll for sure not stay at the Millennium Harvest.

The potatoes are standard fare for mid range restaurants, and obviously were big batch and had no butter or any seasonings to them. Honestly the only high point to my dinner was the meat. Don't forget to ask for butter for the potatoes or extra gravy! \\n\\nIt did take a fair bit of time to get our food, but the wait was overall ok as it wasn't too busy. You can tell they prioritize the main floor versus the bar, as we came in at the same time as some nice old ladies who sat in the main room and left 25 minutes after them. Even after ordering, what appeared to be, similar meals.\\n\\nThe soda cups are small and not worth the price, don't bother with them. Even with free refills you'll have to hunt down a member of waitstaff to get a timely refill. \\n\\nMy partners food was generally alright, but looked much smaller in portion and value than mine for the same price.

So this review is a amalgamation of my past 10+ years of visits to this particular Panda Express. To begin, it has been evident for a while that the staff here does not enjoy working here. Rarely are they friendly or helpful with any questions or concerns I have had as a customer. This may be attributed to the fact that I've never seen this place not have a line that  is almost out the door. I would also agree with an earlier reviewer that over the years, the portions have significantly gotten smaller while the price has increased. Because this location is often so busy, they are constantly running out of a lot of their menu items and thus causing a even more increased wait time. To be fair, because of the high turnover of food, when you do finally get the menu items that you order it is freshly made. This location is a perfect example of how much customer experience and service has a an major impact on a restaurant's overall performance review.

Believe it or not, this was probably one of the best tacos I've had. Full of flavor and not shy on the cilantro (love cilantro!!). I got the Rigatoni with Pork & Beef Bolognese ($17). Simple, hearty and the definition of comfort food. Our food and drinks came out quickly and Dana checked in frequently. Honestly, I would add Porter to a local favorite of mine and will be back soon!"},{"name":"Austin's Pizza South Lamar","address":"1817 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"How on earth do they get away with it?

The flavors were solid all throughout and each slice had equal amounts and a generous portion of toppings. The Italian sausage was my favorite part, so fresh, flavorful and juicy. The mushrooms were huge! I loved that. Could have done without the olives. They added a weird saltiness that I could have done without. I liked that the pizza had a bit of a spice to it as well. \\n\\nI wasn't a fan of the crust, and to me the crust is was makes or breaks a pizza and separates the mediocre from the great. The crust was a bit too charred in places, and there wasn't much substance or flavor to it. The bottom was also a bit too thin. It didn't hold up to the ingredients and fell apart easily. It was also way way to soggy. I had pizza in Italy that was pretty thin but still never got soggy no matter what it was topped it. Something went wrong in the making and baking of this pie. \\n\\nThe pizza has six small slices, perfect for sharing between two people and not feeling stuffed. \\n\\nWe also decided on sharing a half chopped. It was bigger than I expected, so next time I'd get the mini to share between two people. The dressing on the salad was to die for! One of the best homemade Italians I've ever had. \\n\\nThey used to give free olives as a mini appetizer, and I enjoyed munching on them, but they don't do that anymore unless you ask. \\n\\nVery limited draft menu.

One table of four at my arrival. No greeting at the door. The chef was in the kitchen and had to call out the waitress who was at that table chit chatting.

She didn't even mention that! She said she had four tables. Yeah, so, first not my concern, and second that is just average for wait staff, and third the others came in after me. Utterly the worst place I have ever been. Just moving to Beaverton and will avoid this place. Chit chat on your time, and get busy. Oh and she made some other excuse that the manager wasn't there because \\"they took their son to the airport.\\" Hey manager (owner?), this is what happens when you turn your back.

It took me about 30 minutes to order and another 10-15 minutes to get my 3 dozen order. They have some unique toppings and even offer a special/seasonal topping which is nice. However, I was not impressed with the donut. It was a tad bit on the dense side with a bitter after taste which ends up counter balancing the sweet toppings and leaves a negative note on your palate. It's best to eat it right away while it's fresh because the freshness doesn't last very long and becomes dry and stale overnight.  I prefer my donut light, and airy with a sweetness factor which goes well with a good tasting cup of coffee. It was an okay experience.

My 3 kids, wife, and myself after a great day at Disney Springs wanted to take the boat transportation from the dock by the boathouse to the dock by the Cirque de Sole theater. In between there is one stop at Port Orleans, this was a busy Saturday night so there was quite the line to get on the boat from the Boathouse area dock.. which we waited and was happy to do so since the kids were pretty excited for the ride. We get to the Port Orleans stop and we're told that we have to get off and wait in line again in order to get to the Cirque de Sole dock. I ask if he's seriously going to make my 4 year old, 2 year old, and 6 week old wait through an hour long line after a 5 minute boat ride to wait in another hour long ride. I was threatened to have security called on me after that statement. The night prior (Friday) we did the same thing, but were not asked to get off at Port Orleans. So my advice to you is DO NOT RELY ON THIS AS TRANSPORTATION! Just a novelty. The absolute worst Disney experience (and my wife and kids are hardcore go from coast to coast several times a year) we have experienced. The cast member was beyond rude better described as volatile and really ruined our, once awesome, day. I hate to write this terrible review. But now you are warned.
