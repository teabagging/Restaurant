Everything was fine, until the owner, Lill stopped by our table after one of the people in our group had commented to the waitress, Kristen, their pickles were still gross (seriously, no one in our party liked them and people at the next table agreed that they were inedible) and she would like her to request that they have an all day breakfast menu since, as a vegetarian, there are limited options available for her to eat but she can have eggs.\\n\\nLill not only leaned across the table, but pointed in our dining companion's face and was extremely nasty in her responses.  She stated we were the only people who ever complained about the pickles - fine, whatever.   She's not changing the menu because it's extremely eclectic and everyone loves it - except our friend tried explaining that there's limited options because she's a vegetarian and Lill, rather than addressing her concerns, listed off ethnicities that the menu showcased.   We commented to some foods that were awesome on the menu (The cheese tart with tomato jam?  Wonderful)   Our friend once again pointed out that as a vegetarian, she could eat eggs, so an omelet would be perfect at dinner.\\n\\nLill then turned to walk away, throwing over her shoulder that if she didn't like it she could go somewhere else, they're not the only game in town.\\n\\nWait, what?\\n\\nYou're telling someone who is in your restaurant, willingly, with a group of five other people, to go somewhere else?\\n\\nCongratulations Lill, you've got your wish.

But that's also it's downfall.  Sometimes they work; other times they don't.\\n\\nTake a simple thing like calamari.  One one visit, the taste and texture were textbook; on another, perhaps the oil was a bad choice or needed to be deep-fried but it was noticeably wrong for frying.  Fried olives sound like a mistake, but were delicious.  The salad with Manchego cheese is my favorite, but I'm a Manchego addict so take that for what you will.\\n\\nAs reflected in some of the other reviews, I think the service is inconsistent.  I have gotten some unwarranted attitude (this isn't LA or NYC or London, OK?) at times, but others I felt warmly received.\\n\\nI think the layout of the outdoor cocktail area is notable for its uniqueness.  Couches and tables are shaded in the summer by a sun shade that provides a much cooler (temperature-wise) environment than you might expect from mid-summer Austin.  The interior is also well designed; modern, but with warm touches like the golden bull.\\n\\nThe price points are a little high, but happy hour is a good time to try some tapas and some of their cocktails.\\n\\nI think FINO is worth a try (I will eventually be back), but trying to guess what it will be like is really like flipping a coin.

Much to my surprise,  it was open!  That was the first surprise.\\n\\nThe second surprise is how authentic and how delicious and how true to Taiwanese flavors this place is.  Also, I walked in kind of not knowing what to expect and hoping that it wasn't another place trying to do too much or infuse some Americanized flavor into Taiwanese food.  I just wanted to have a place that knew what its identity was and was proud of the heritage of the food.  This place did not disappoint me.  \\n\\nYou can usually tell how good a Taiwanese restaurant is by trying their beef noodle soup and their baos.  We ordered two baos: the Dirty Bird Bao (a Taiwanese Chicken Cutlet bao with pickled vegetables and wasabi aioli) and a Pork Belly Bao (made with braised tender delicious Berkshire pork and topped with cilantro and crushed peanuts).  They make their baos (steamed bread) in house and the texture and taste reminded me of my homeland.  The meat was well-seasoned and not overly salty.  After one bite into the pork belly bao, I was convinced that this place might meet my standard for Taiwanese food but tried not to get too excited.\\n\\nI'll be the first to admit that I'm a bit of a beef noodle soup snob.  I usually have to resort to making myself beef noodle soup because there are only a few places in Atlanta that make anything worth mentioning, none of which are inside the Perimeter.  After one sip of the soup, I was convinced.  The flavors were all there... it wasn't too salty, not too oily, not too spicy... the balance of flavors and the texture of the perfectly cooked noodles turned into a party in my mouth.  The beef was tender and flavorful too.  After finishing the bowl, we talked with Andy, one of the owners of this family owned place, who said that they are trying to honor the tradition of Taiwanese food.  He also told us that the menu will change every 3-4 weeks and they will also rotate through to serving oh-ah-zhen (oyster omelette) and ba-wan (glutinous meatball) and other traditional Taiwanese foods.\\n\\nAh-Ma means grandmother in Taiwanese and I'm sure that just saying those words evokes lots of fond memories and emotions of childhood and being fed by your Ah-Ma.  I'll be a regular patron, and I'm sure I'll see some of you guys there as well.\\n\\nI hope you guys stay in business for a very long time.  Atlanta needs places like this to succeed.

It's familiar, and it reminds me how chinese places were when my Mom used to take me for crab in black bean sauce back in the 80's. \\n\\nSo I now go to On Lok and get crab in black bean sauce.

I'm talking melt-in-your-mouth, best eggs of my life, insane amounts of buttery-goodness. Might I have sold my soul to the devil for this quiche? It is entirely possible. \\n\\nThe quiche came with a side of fruit, which was a bit underwhelming (unripe, tasteless melon slices are the worst thing that can happen to a fruit bowl), but I was so mesmerized by my quiche that I didn't mind. \\n\\nDo I have a tendency to exaggerate?

The chef gave us a free small bit of salmon and dill also which was very cool. The drinks were great. Could use a better beer selection but this is coming from a craft beer connoisseur so I can't knock them that much. Great wine and brandy selections! We got the burger, filet, and venison. All the meat was cooked to perfection. Well balanced and delicious. The only improvement I saw with the burger is to somehow make the heirloom tomato on the burger more crunchy. Or maybe put a thicker slice on the burger. It was a bit thin and soggy when I bit into it. So it was the same texture as the bread.

Just for your reference, I've tried Pho Phu Thinh Restaurant, Delicious Pho, Pho 99, and Pho Hoa. I think the one remaining restaurant we haven't given a chance to is Pho Sen Beef, so I'll update this post when that happens. \\n\\nBut in conclusion, for me it's definitely Pho Huy great-great-greater than Pho Hoa, which is greater than Delicious Pho, which is greater than Pho Phu Thinh Restaurant, which is finally greater than Pho 99. \\n\\nI don't know if there's just more MSG or if they are putting something illegal into their broth, but it's just mad delicious in comparison to the rest. I'm a bit of a pho snob when it comes to my broth - it needs to be rich in taste which would equal to many hours of boiling the beef bones, and I find a lot of pho restaurants that aren't located at Vancouver East side to be lacking this element. Pho Huy, however, does it for me. \\n\\nI acknowledge that it's a tad more expensive than other pho restaurants in the neighborhood, but hey, if the difference is this big in terms of taste, I don't mind paying the extra buck for my pho at all. The service is almost always attentive and good. Servers are always accommodating and I like how they leave the cilantro out of your pho to be added by your own discretion with the bean sprouts. They also have these great incentives like getting a can of pop free if you purchase more than 25 dollars before tax, or spring rolls if you purchase more than 35. \\n\\nAll in all, I will definitely be back at Pho Huy and definitely recommend it to you all."},{"name":"Taco Loco Mexican Grill","address":"44 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"I loved this place!

Ok so the waitress was nice but how can I say \\"bad at her job\\" without sounding mean? Mind you, the sir and I are both servers.\\n\\nOrdered a lamb meatball and rib specials for apps. Received the ribs and a tiger shrimp instead of the lamb. The waitress had no problem switching it out and didn't take long at all. They were good but not a whole lot of flavor.\\n\\nOur entrees included the steak au poivre (and a side of veggies) and the hoisin duck breast. Had to reask for the veggies because the waitress forgot, but once again no big deal.  The steak was ok but sort of dry while the duck breast was tiny and the piece I tried reminded me of two day old reheats... with no hoisin at all. Boo.\\n\\nSo about this time we're wanting alcohol to wash it down. We were told that a \\"pitcher of okinawa smash serves four and it's only like 12 bucks\\". As there was only two of us, the waitress said it was possible to only do \\"two little shots instead of a pitcher\\". Awesome, two drinks for 6 bucks? Sure!... No. Once the bill came we found out the two drinks were 18, somehow 6 dollars more than what the bartender said a whole pitcher would be. I didn't enjoy, but the sir did.\\n\\nAnywho, we each got a piece of mochi ice cream for 5 bucks total. They were good, but something tells me they probably bought it down the street at Trader Joe's (maybe that's why it was the best tasting thing).\\n\\nEnded up paying a hundred bucks (including a 20% tip because I felt bad for the waitress) for a meal that tasted worse than what I could make at home and didn't fill us up at all. It is very disappointing to compare this meal to the only other expensive meal I've ever eaten which was exponentially better.

While waiting with my 1 year old i got to really check out the place.  The seafood display is really nice, fresh cuts and yummy selection.  The place seemed pretty busy with locals picking up some fresh cuts.  The fish shop is separated from the seated section which is nice.  It look like a pretty neat place to have lunch.  The two guys working were super nice, helping me tame my little one year old with oyster crackers.  Before i get to my food review, i have to explain something cool that happened.  I thought i recognized the owner who helped me order, but i couldn't' place the face.  After some small talk, he explained he worked for years and years at Greer's Seafood in Belmont.  That's where i grew up, and if you are from that area you know that Greer's on Trapelo was the mecca for seafood on Friday night.  Call in your order early in the day, line out the door without fail and taking home the most delicious seafood that was cooked with care.  The owner (i think his name is franny) explained he works hard to recreate that Greers taste.  I just knew this was going to be good.  Of course i get home and we dig right in...first thing we notice is how fresh the food tastes.  My shrimp was very lightly seasoned and perfectly grilled and the veggies (nice mixed of zucchini, onion, pepper, carrots and squash) were drool worthy (and i can tell you i NEVER drool over veggies).  My husband admitted it was probably the best fish and chips he has had in years.  After a while you just get used to getting served overly battered, wet, oily fish. this was carefully coated and clearly cooked for the perfect amount of time at the perfect temperature.

The aftertaste is very pleasant.  I wanted to order another Schwarzbier, but asked to look over the beer menu for a second time.\\n\\nI made my choice for lunch - a chicken and pesto calzone with marinara sauce.

No problem getting a seat, but it was getting fuller as we left at around 6:30pm. PARKING NOTE: you can use the \\"permit only\\" lot next to Sacco's Bowl-Haven, just make sure you tell the host/hostess.\\n\\nFresh soba and fresh tofu are really hard to find outside of NYC/LA/Tokyo, so I was super excited to taste Sugidama. GREAT apps. We tried the baby octopus (perfectly fried), zaru tofu (never had this before, light and refreshing), and chawan mushi soup (more traditional, well executed). I'll reserve judgment on the sushi until I've tried some more. I ordered a soy paper maki. It was just okay, but I'm generally not a huge fan of non-traditional sushi, so maybe that was it.\\n\\nBig draw is obviously the soba. DELICIOUS. Well cooked with a good amount of toothsomeness. Judging from the texture this might not be 100% buckwheat, I wouldn't be surprised if it's nihachi (20% flour, 80% buckwheat).\\n\\nKeep in mind, soba dishes are traditionally lighter and simpler than in-your-face, rich/fatty ramen bowls that are overflowing with add-ons. The classic tenzaru soba was perfect (tempura also well-fried). Sukiyaki soba was an interesting dish I've never had before, but also good. By the time we got to the duck soba, we were stuffed, but it was similarly tasty. I will say the dishes could use a little bit more scallion or small greens to add some color/texture, but other than that these were pretty representative of Japanese noodle houses.\\n\\nI had eaten dinner at Oishii South End two days earlier. Obviously a different location, ambiance (though I like Sugidama's airy, light-wood aesthetic more than Oishii's oppressively dark nightclub vibe), and focus, but it's not close.

I am also the kind of person who would rather try a new restaurant each time I go out than return habitually to the same familiar spot. I am rarely so taken with a restaurant or a particular dish that I feel the need to return or recommend it to a friend. So it is particularly unusual for me to publicly extol a restaurant, especially one that is practically the definition of a classic chophouse.\\n\\nBut based on my two experiences at Wildfire (located outside Perimeter Mall), I do not hesitate to add it to my shortlist of favorite restaurants, and encourage everyone to try it for themselves. Minor disclaimer: The only food I have gotten thus far at Wildfire was lunch take-out, so I cannot vouch for table service. Nonetheless, given the degree of care that goes into a simple to-go order, I am confident the servers are of superior quality as well.\\n\\nThe dishes I have eaten are the Char Crusted Turkey Burger and Lemon Chicken Breast. Without going into the details of their ingredients, I will just say that both were cooked perfectly, and flavored with just the right balance of seasonings. The wild rice side is also delicious; mixed with peas and other minced vegetables, it tastes rich and earthy, but not oily, as many wild rice dishes tend to.\\n\\nBesides the outstanding quality of the food, the attention to detail in packing the to-go order was unexpected and impressive.

The gravy is delicious - made in house with actual pieces of sausage and flavorful herbs, great consistency. \\n\\nWe also had some of the deluxe hashbrowns which were a special tasty treat. Crisp brown on the outside, hot and mooshy on the inside, mixed with peppers, onions, mushrooms, cheese.

I get this nostalgia vibe like it was a place your Grandparents probably went to grab some Italian grub and chew the fat with friends, or the owner. \\n\\nThe place is ecliptic and almost dive worthy... The decor lets itself be known with it's kitschy collection of what has to be over 100 copper kettles, all shapes and sizes. A collection of Pressure gauges, and bad Italian restaurant knick-knacks litter about the walls. It's a curious collection to experience at least once.. I suppose. The lighting is on the darker side, which will have you rubbing your eyes feeling as if you were a bear awakening from a long hibernation once you open the front doors as the bright light of the outside world pours in.  \\n\\nThe food in my opinion was A-OK. Going back to the notion that this place is OLD and reminiscent of your grandparents... then you'll get what I'm saying. Just picture the 1950's-60's and people looking for what they thought was \\"Italian Food\\", and Villa Nova fits the dish perfectly. It's nothing new, nothing exciting, nothing really fresh, or trend setting. \\n\\nThe pizza is worth a mention. I really enjoyed it. I ordered just a plain Cheese pizza, but could see where adding meatball and other toppings could make it a hit. It's a nice crispy Ohio square cut pie. Right up my alley, and Villa Nova makes it well. \\n\\nMeatballs are the big winners here. I saw so many of those traveling past my table that I was pretty disappointed I did not order one for myself. Perhaps in a future trip. \\n\\nPrices here were high in my opinion for the quality of food with each small dish averaging around $7 and going upwards from there. \\n\\nSo... to Sum up Villa Nova... think no frivolous and non changing, and that's basically what you'll get. Is is the best Italian Columbus can offer? Heck, no, but it's a nice place for families and groups to get together and have some American Italian food and support the small Mom and Pop's instead of the Olive Garden's and Bucca Di Beppo's.

A few more bites realized that the monstrosity was composed of primarily liquids sunk at the bottom, dried wads of meat, and some vegetation here and there.\\n\\nTo be honest, I was so disappointed with the food that I finished half of the burrito before I went to another establishment afterwards and destroyed my cravings.

After a one-hour flight delay and airport food all day of travel, my stomach was still on California time and I had to find something to eat that was still open on Friday night that wasn't too pricey, bar food, or far from my hotel. Cue my inner Duchess. Already missing Ramen House Ryujin, and unimpressed by touristy chains P.F. Chang's, Cheesecake Factory, and Pinkberry inside the shops at Pru, I happened upon Wagamama. I did also want to try Legal Seafoods but not on the first night, wanted to keep it simple. \\n\\nNever heard of Wagamama (apparently a British-based chain that has only US locations in MA) and thought I'd give it a try. Picnic bench style seating, I was a solo diner so it wasn't too awkward. Off their summer menu, and, \\"when in Rome,\\" I got the seafood ramen (noodles in a vegetable broth with mussels, shrimp,and salmon, topped with wakame, spinach, carrots, scallions, and a wedge of lime) for main dish, $12.95. It was okay, not too filling though.\\n\\nFor dessert, I wanted the coconut reika (three scoops of coconut ice cream with a tangy mango sauce and toasted coconut) but the waitress was able to hook me up with a smaller version of it (one scoop portion instead of three) since it was just me...on the house. I know what you're thinking, since when does Michelle L. turn down massive ice cream? It was a long day and that one scoop was plenty rich, thanks very much. Not sure if it was the local Cambridge Toscanini's ice cream but it was refreshing, the tropical flavor helped. I didn't realize she didn't charge for the ice cream dessert until after my trip was done and I was going through receipts for an expense report. Oops.

We felt instantly welcomed.  Our server Nick was superb and attended to our every need in a timely and gracious manner.  Wes, one of the managers that night,also checked in on us a few times to make sure we were doing ok. \\nAside from the excellent service, the food was the true star of the evening.  Despite a few slight misses, we were completely satisfied with our meal and look forward to a return visit.\\nWe started with the Blistered Peppadew Peppers.  What a delicious combination of flavors!  The peppers were served with goat cheese, smoked almonds, black pepper honey and (yum!) homemade crackers.  The sweet, salty, cheesy combination was a true delight.  I will have this again the next time we go.\\nWe tried an assortment of meats between the two of us.  The sliced smoke turkey, sliced beef brisket and the baby back ribs.  The ribs were everything you expect from ribs, meaty, fall-of-the-bone tender and not overly spiced.  The turkey and brisket were worthy contenders and were not dried out.  They have a sauce station and we tried the cherry cola sauce....EXCELLENT....a must try!\\nThe sides was where if fell off a bit (I would give a 4  1/2 stars if it was available only for this reason). I absolutely loved the corn and edamame succotash.  The mac and cheese was a decent effort...nothing spectacular but a solid effort.  The smoky braised kale was a tad on the vinegary side for my taste...my husband didn't think so though ...he liked them.  The sweet potato souffl√© was velvety smooth and not too sweet but they had a bit too much cinnamon ( again for my tastes, anyways).\\nThe space is wonderfully decorated with a very spacious deck.

(While I was in line another customer was returning because his order was wrong as well, stating, \\"It's not the first time.\\" As long as a mistake is a tasty mistake, and it doesn't hurt my pocket, I won't really complain. Since I didn't pay for the egg, (I guess she didn't hear me? It was a big hectic.) no worries. On to the flavor!\\n\\nLike a fellow Yelper said, it looked like they put a slice of processed american cheese on my biscuit, which I was a bit bummed by as I am now spoiled by the rest of Portland eateries. Upon my first bite, however, I realized it wasn't at all american (I don't know what they use at their stand at the market, though) but was a super-sharp and flavorful cheddar. Yummy. The fried chicken was lovely, not \\"hockey puck\\" style as I've seen it described at all. Thin? Yes, but not too thin. It is the perfect size to be on a biscuit. I didn't notice until I was about halfway through, but the chicken was also slightly spicy. which was a very nice touch indeed. The bacon was perfect, but unless it's soggy and flimsy, isn't it always? The biscuits were fabulous homestyle biscuits that would make your mama proud. Well worth every penny spent!\\n\\nIt's also true that they have next-to-no seating, so expect to take your food to go unless you are super lucky. I did start to feel a bit claustrophobic as women with huge purses kept backing into me, even when there was no need. But that is the way of women with huge purses; it can happen anywhere.

It's super cute inside, with plates, white linens and awesome shaped glasses! I really liked the table settings but wasn't a huge fan of the chairs. The walls and decor were subtle and in 'exotic' colors (orange/coral and green). I liked it. It felt very intimate. This is a place for a date with someone you already know, like a nice little romantic nook! We were greeted and spoke to 3 employees before ordering. It was nice and felt like we were valued as customers!\\n\\nWe both ordered chicken pad thai. I did half chicken, half tofu, my boyfriend did half chicken half pork. When asked how spicy we wanted our food, the range was 0-5, five being the mysterious \\"Thai Spicy\\". I chose 4. Boyfriend chose 3. \\n\\nFood arrived promptly and table service was awesome. Both meals were yummy, however my chicken/tofu pad Thai wasn't spicy. It was like...what I would term a 1 or 2. My boyfriend's \\"3\\" was a zero. It wasn't spicy at all. Having never had pad Thai before, I don't know what \\"Thai Spicy\\" might taste like, but this wasn't spicy. I added the table chili sauce and was very satisfied spicing mine \\"to taste\\". \\n\\nWhen I go again (I would totally go again!), I'll order it 5++ (I might ask for it \\"Thai Spicy\\" by name) and still add chili sauce. But it was very good food! \\n\\nOh and we ordered ice cream, to go. The ice cream was good. My boyfriend had mango and I had coconut. My coconut (I'm not sure why/how) tasted like tuna. So I didn't finish it. My boyfriend smelled and tasted it and insisted it only tasted like coconut (he hates coconut) but it didn't taste like coconut. It was like a coconut undertone with tuna juice. Maybe they were preparing tuna near the ice cream? I don't know why I tasted it so strongly. \\n\\nSoooo no ice cream for me in the future but really, the experience was lovely, service was superb and the food was yummy!"},{"name":"Im Thai Cuisine","address":"1671 Main St, Ste C","city":"Buda","stars":"4.5","text":"Went here to try it out To go and was not satisfied. I come from California and grew up eating Thai food and I have to say this place is not that great. The people though we're nice but the food on the other hand was not up to par. I ordered the pad Thai chicken, pad see ew beef, a chicken satay (they didn't have beef which I found kinda odd) and a beef fried rice. When I got home with my partner expecting a feast to share with his brother, we discovered in the To-go box tiny portions of each thing we ordered. I mean I've eaten lunch specials that are 2x as bigger the. Something neatly wrapped in a single square of tin foil. Any way let me break down what we got for you future eaters out there.\\n\\nThe pad Thai, It's colors were kinda light, not really orange like most pad Thais i have eaten. The flavor too was off almost like it was watered down or it's missing something. This in the To-go box though expanded the most because you have to mix it with the lime And the bean sprouts. It made the box look more full, so portion wise out of the 4, it was the most we were given.\\n\\nThe pad see ew beef on the other hand was tiny and was almost covered completely with the little sheet of tin foil! When I opened it looked right, and I had high hopes for it but when we got to actually eating it, the flavors don't really taste like it. Don't get me wrong it wasn't disgusting, just not what pad see ew exactly. Maybe it was like the pad Thai and the flavors were really watered down and then they added fish sauce. I mean there are slight hints of pad Thai because of the egg but still it was not pad Thai. Just wearing a fake mask that made it look like it.\\n\\nThe beef fried rice, just as the others, was tiny. This how ever looked right and tasted right. I have to say they got the rice down! But the portions were tiny so I have to take away points on that.\\n\\nThe sate on the other hand... Was not good. I asked if they had rice with it because typically sate appetizers had rice with it to eat with it but they did not. I was ok with it because I wanted to try this place out. Well when I opened the box when I got home the sate was dripping with oil and I don't know what! It never seen sate like that ever! I gave it it shot  and took a bite. It was Limey and dry. I then though ok maybe with the sauce it will be ok... No the sauce didn't taste like peanuts really.. It tasted like lime too with a small hint of peanuts!\\n\\nAll in all this place would be good for people who have never tried Real Thai food and don't like big potions. We payed about 37$ for 4 things that they could have easily put in 1 to go box. The only thing that got is a very nice lady who worked the front desk! I've never written a Yelp review ever but this place needed a review on it bad. I don't think I will be ordering from here. Maybe it's different eating in but so far I'm not impressed at all.

And the quality Happy Lamb offers is comparable to other hotpot places that aren't buffet style. I can't believe the veggie combo they have is huge! It's a giant bowl the size of like a small basin. If you want sauce here, you would have to ask for it on the side. They offer sacha, sesame, garlic, and chili oil. I just wished they offered scallions but it's not a big deal.

Since I had already looked at their menu prior to going I knew what I wanted, which was the #44 - ginger chicken udon. My friend ordered the #42 - yaki udon. I also ordered a large melon juice, which was the best part of the meal. It was so fresh and delicious I could probably live on it.\\n\\nThe dishes arrived shortly, and they were the perfect size. I hate when I go to a restaurant and get overwhelmed by how giant the entree is when it arrives. The dishes smelled delicious. The udon noodles are thick noodles, kind of the same thickness and consistency of earth worms. Well, I'm GUESSING they're the same consistency. I've never actually cut into an earth worm. I was lucky in science class. Thankfully the udon tasted good. There was a really nice pickled red ginger garnish that I liked a lot.\\n\\nMy friend is from Taiwan, and I felt a little embarrassed at first by my lack of chopstick experience with this type of noodle. So she asked the server if he could bring me a fork and knife. Right after she asked I realized that I didn't really NEED a fork and knife, but I digress...\\n\\nThe bill came to around $30, which wasn't too bad. My friend was upset that no one ever gave me a fork & knife, and didn't want to leave a 20% tip. I normally tip at least 20%, so I felt bad. I really thought the service was excellent, and the food was OK. A little pricey for what it is, but I don't really plan on going back any time soon. I would, however go there for their juice.

Out of the sweets, my favourite was the fruit tart and from the sandwiches it was the brie and mushroom croissant and smoked salmon.

Hmmm....am I being paid to be a restaurant quality control agent? \\n\\nOn another trip, I went for a whole steamed lobster. Now, Chart House is the only place I've been where they de-shell the meat for you.

Yes, they do fried well. The nice accompanying photos of the clams and fries do the place justice.

Their specialty is in waffles, which come in either the brussels or the liege variety, but they do also make a good assortment of pastries, breads and cakes. During my visit, I've had the opportunity to sample a few of their waffles (Ham & Cheese, Apple & Custard, and Milk Chocolate with Pecans) as well as their Chocolate Trio cake. All of the items that I've tried were pretty good, with the cake and the liege waffle were my personal favourites. Although I did find some of their cakes to be a bit on the pricier side, the majority of their prices are very reasonable. All in all, I really liked this bakery. It's definitely worth checking out.\\n\\nHam & Cheese Brussels ($4.25):\\n3.5/5\\nThe waffle was soft and fluffy, albeit a bit dry. There was a fairly good amount of ham inside. I could have done with a bit more cheese however.\\n\\nApple & Custard Filled Waffle ($4):\\n4/5\\nAgain, the waffle was soft and fluffy, and the filling ensured that it was moist. The apples were tender and had a nice scent of cinnamon. I really enjoyed the custard, which was mildly sweet and creamy.\\n\\nLiege Waffle, Milk Chocolate with Pecans ($3.50)\\n4.5/5\\nThe waffle is considerably denser and chewier than the brussels waffles, and I really preferred this type of texture over the latter. The chocolate was sweet and not at all waxy, while the pecans were fresh, toasted and lent a nice fragrance and texture.\\n\\nChocolate Trio ($6):\\n4.5/5\\nThis consisted of chocolate cake topped by a layer each of milk, dark, and white chocolate mousse. This is definitely a great dessert for chocolate lovers. The chocolate cake was a tender and moist, with a slightly fudgy texture that reminded me of a brownie. The chocolate mousse was smooth, creamy, and flavourful. I did find the chocolate garnishes to taste a bit stale; otherwise, however, this is a seriously fantastic cake.\\n\\nAlmond Croissant ($3.95):\\nN/A\\nI gave this to my mom.

On one occasion when MK was opening at 9 am we were able to enter at 7:45 am with an 8 am reservation.  Most places would not be open inside the park but it's nice to be able to get in early before the crowds for picture taking, enjoying personal space, and to catch some rides before lines get long right after you finish eating.\\n\\nPre-ordering is possible for breakfast and lunch.  I highly recommend this because it repeatedly allowed us to skip ahead of about 40 people after we entered the castle.  On one occasion there were technical difficulties and this forced us to go through the nonpre-order line which took an extra 15 minutes.  I did notice a problem though that ordering from my smartphone's browser would sometimes change the item by the time I submitted the order.  After entering the castle with a pre-order, you still stop at another desk where you have an opportunity to confirm or change your pre-order before you are seated.  After you finish your pre-order meal, you can still walk through the ordering area if you want to experience talking suits or armor or take a picture while sitting in the Master's Chair.\\n\\nDrinks are self serve from beverage fountains for breakfast and lunch and we used this to refill empty water bottles repeatedly.  They have coffee and hot chocolate also.  During these periods one can also choose which room to sit in assuming there is an open table.  The Grand Ballroom is the largest and the noisiest.  The Castle Gallery to the right is quieter, medium in size, and has some half booth seating with bright/romantic decorations.  The West Wing to the left is the smallest and dark with signs of Beast and the famous rose.  The two latter rooms have more personality.  Regardless of where you sit, you can explore.  We saw plenty of people roam between rooms to see the different decorations and take pictures.\\n\\nDinner takes place only in the Grand Ballroom and it does not allow pre-orders.  Instead there will be a server.  This is the only time that Beast was available for photos.  Meeting Beast is not like meeting other Disney characters.  His servants announced that he does not do autographs because Belle only taught him how to read, not how to write.  My wife dressed in yellow asked him, \\"Can we dance?\\" and that led to a nice photo op.  Dinner is the most expensive followed by breakfast and then lunch.  But breakfast does come with complimentary pastries.  For breakfast, we found that simply ordering one entree for sharing by 2 people plus the complimentary pastries was enough to last until lunch.  To-go boxes are available if you ask a server.\\n\\nIf you are a Beauty and the Beast fan I recommend you eat here at least once with a pre-order if possible.  I would come back here for breakfast simply for the early entry also.  If you have trouble getting a reservation or your exact desired time, just keep checking back especially on the days leading up to your visit.  Cancel reservations by the night before to avoid a fee if your plans will change.\\n\\nAs for the actual food:\\n\\nScrambled egg whites - 3/5 exactly what one would expect from the menu description (comes with pastries)\\n\\nEggs Florentine - 4/5 the pastry shell is soft and flaky similar to a croissant (comes with pastries)\\n\\nCroque Monsieur - 3/5 I had higher expectations from reading other reviews\\n\\nBraised Pork - 4/5 \\n\\nFrench Onion Soup - 3/5\\n\\nSaut√©ed Shrimp and Scallops - 4/5 the pastry shell is similar to the breakfast item above\\n\\nPan-seared Salmon on Leek Fondue - 4/5 above average but not unique\\n\\nThe \\"Grey Stuff\\" - 4/5 hard to resist ordering with the background music and especially with a sincere \\"It's delicious.

The only reservation we could make was for 9 pm but that is not a problem for us at all.  We got there and got seated pretty close to 9.  The menu is not a large one, very small and very limited.  I am not sure if they change it frequently, they might just based on the fact its a printer piece of paper in a plastic sleeve.  The waiter was not very friendly, he was very cold and to the point.

It was 5 pm on a Sunday, the place was 1/4 full.  No crowds.  The food was good.  The service was not.  I appreciate the manager taking half of the very late meal off of the bill, I do.  But, they need to get their acts together if they want people to come back.  This is a place I used to frequent with friends after a showing of an indie movie at the theater behind it.

After coming here for 2 years I know sometimes you will get defrosted bagels from the day before which is extremely easy to stop out when ur ordering and eating them as is. They are mushy and have a slight freezer taste and totally different than the crispy fresh ones you expect. I also have had issue with not getting my sandwiches made as ordered. No salt and pepper makes a big difference when ur on the go and don't have any to add. Overall don't expect to get popular picks like French toast before 6:45am or after 1:45pm it's most likely going to be frozen or sold out. Also I would say don't make urself known as a pain with the staff, they might have forgotten the S&P a few times but that's better tha getting snooded when ordering.

Dingy and outdated doesn't even begin to describe it. It was dark, loud, dirty and the furniture is really worn. In addition, during the course of my visit, some employees frequently went outside to smoke, and the vents pulled the awful smell to right where I was sitting. Who would feel like eating after smelling cigarettes for so long? No one. \\n\\nIn regards to the service, my waiter was an elderly gentleman who wasn't a good hostess. He missed multiple cues that my husband and I gave to ask for water, the check, etc. I don't blame him, because he was the main waiter working the dining area while the other employees stood around, joked, and smoked outside. \\n\\nAnd to my surprise, the food was mediocre! I was firstly pissed that it took about 35 minutes for two meals to be made when there were practically no people in the dining room. They were not complicated meals, and I could have cooked better at home! My husband ordered a kabob, and he was served his meal on a plate too small.

I'd been meaning to go there for years, so I was salivating in anticipation.\\n\\nI ordered the risotto to start and the halibut for the main course.  My boyfriend ordered a beef dish, which may have been a filet, although I don't recall exactly.  \\n\\nI will admit the flavors of the risotto were beyond delicious and sophisticated, but the texture was crunchy, and I mean breaking my teeth crunchy.  It was also runny.  But what was most remarkable about this dish was that some very skilled and patient person in the kitchen managed to meticulously spread what couldn't amount to more than two non-heaping teaspoonfuls of risotto one rice grain deep onto the plate.  I'm not a big eater, and rarely eat more than half my plate.  Even I was insulted by the paltry portion of the risotto.\\n\\nAnd that was the highlight of the dinner.  Downhill from there.\\n\\nNext came out two beautiful entrees.  The protein, sauces, vegetables, all looked gorgeous, perfectly cooked, nicely presented.  My piece of fish was fresh, plump and tasted of... salt.  I had a taste of the sauce, and detected no flavor other than salt.  The adorable baby carrots tasted of salt.  After about 4 mouthfuls, I knew my prospects for enjoying this meal were nil.  I asked how my boyfriend's entree was and he said with a pinched frown that his beef and sauce lacked flavor and were too salty.\\n\\nSo that was it.  After years of wanting to eat there, three weeks of waiting for our reservation, I was served one grain of rice deep layer of flavorful but undercooked risotto in runny broth, and two entrees where all natural flavors were beaten out of beautiful and fresh ingredients and replaced with: Salt.  Dessert was out of the question.  \\n\\nWe each ate about 1/4 of our entrees and left.  We were never asked how our meal was.  Perhaps it was an off night.

Being from Chicago (and Hyderabad, IN), I come from a varied experience when it comes to US based Indo-Pak, Hyderabadi, Mughlai dishes and have been some of the best out there (US and London). So compared to authentic HYD places in Chicago, NY, Houston, Dallas the fare is passable at best. What I do like though is the setting and scalable serving platform. \\n\\nI'm a huge fan of the Hyderabadi cuisine (restaurant is based on it) and some of its dishes are pretty good. However, there are some issues with most of its dishes, especially the curried and chicken kind (Chicken 65, mutton masala etc.,) are not for the faint of stomach as this dish can create a lot of issues the morning after. Also, their dishes tend to have more oil. \\n\\nThe other issue is with their portion size, which is relatively small. I can pretty much call every single one of their dishes are 'appetizer sized' compared to a normal restaurant. However, that does not deter people from lining up due to its relative reasonable prices.\\n\\nThis restaurant goes jam packed even on a Tuesday night. So something must be right. And yes it is. Most of their dishes are  good flavored though laced with oil. Most impressed is the scale with which they can serve a good number of people though the customer service is so-so, especially on busy nights they take 40-45 minutes to serve even pre-cooked food such as biryani. So overall the customer experience is based on how much Indo-Pak variety one has experienced. For Atlanta, it is pretty good, however, when you compare to restaurants in other cities its quite passable.\\n\\nOverall, OK experience food experience and satisfactory eating experience. \\n\\n\\nMust Try: Behari Kabab, Mutton (Lamb) Biryani, Khubani ka Meetha (Dessert), Naan/Paratha\\n\\nAvoid: Chicken 65, Chicken Kadai, Any curried masala"},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"If you really want an interesting dining experience or Are a big fan of Beauty and the Beast, come here.

That has been our experience at Meehan's at Atlantic Station. \\n\\nWe live in a condo at Atlantic Station and frequent all the spots at Atlantic Station and I mean all of them on a weekly basis.\\n\\nFirst time at Meehan's was an awesome \\"first date with the place\\" we felt it out with a few draft imports, their incredible homemade pretzels with mustard and cheese dipping sauces, one of their appetizer dips and had a great experience. it was great, an authentic feeling tavern. Couldn't wait to go there again.\\n\\nNext time in we ordered the same as above but threw in an order of fish & chips that were average but okay and worth another shot in the future.\\n\\nFast forward to last night when the wife and I went in for a \\"great evening of food and brew\\". Here is where you throw in the obnoxious jock character (who by the way looked like an idiot--anyone that old who turns their cap backwards trying to create swag looks like an idiot); the flaky blond server and an evening full of botched orders.\\n\\nHere's our night/experience:\\n\\nWe started with our usual order of drafts; her Guinness and me a Blacksmith (Guinness & Smithwick's). Being an avid import drinker I noticed we both got a Guinness right away because I saw no line separating my two brews and the bartenders here definitely know how to pour the drinks.\\n\\nSo not wanting to deal with a server who mentally appeared to be somewhere else far, far away; I walked up to the bar and asked the bartender  about it; he agreed she had taken the wrong beer and set me up (I witnessed one pint dumped/wasted down the drain--that itself should be a crime).\\n\\nJump to food order: I opted for the chicken buffalo wrap with a side of mashed potatoes but cannot tell you how it is/was because I was not given what I ordered. I tried I really did but it must not have been in the cards. My plate appeared with a chicken BLT sandwich with fries (0 for 2 couldn't even get the side right). No big deal, we are easy going people; servers work hard; no prob....I asked the order be fixed.\\n\\nMinutes later the BLT returns (at least it had the proper side of mashed); still no buffalo wrap. Blondy offered to get the buffalo wrap at this point and acknowledged the gaffe. Seeing my wife's food in front of her I told the server never mind, I'll take whatever they think I should eat so I kept the chicken BLT.\\n\\nNow the Chicken BLT was very good; I would recommend it. My wife on the other hand; opted to give the Fish & Chips another shot and I've got to say; if you like picking up one sweet potato fries and getting 10-12 stuck together from the grease then this meal is for you. While she was eating her chunks of fries I tried a taste of her fish and \\"chips\\"; would never order that again....ungood; think Arther Treacher's in an awesome atmosphere; way too much grease on this night.\\n\\nBottom line with Meehan's: We met the owners prior to their opening; they were nice enough to walk us through and give us a private tour; and they were the nicest, guys you could ever meet. Sincerely great people on business ventures and expanding their current stable of restaurants. I wish them the best BUT they don't deserve for their place to be run like this when they are away, period. It doesn't suit their style.\\n\\nBottom line #2: If you go to Meehan's stick to the draft brews and pretzel's, just make sure you sit on the opposite side of the bar as the obnoxious drunk jock who is easy to identify; just follow the pounding...\\n\\nFinal note: We shortened our visit and opted to walk back to our condo to watch the football game as did two of our neighbors who also cut their visit short with an \\"eat and run\\" after they made the mistake of sitting next to the drumming jock.  \\n\\nI hope this place can get it right because the build out they did really provides a great atmosphere; especially like the imported wood confessional...\\n\\nUPSIDE: Nice, friendly bartenders who know how to pour, awesome pretzels, they take the \\"A\\" card for residents.\\n\\nDOWNSIDE: Hit or miss..."},{"name":"Mangia Chicago Stuffed Pizza","address":"3016 Guadalupe St, Ste 100","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Good thin crust pizza, tender with just enough crunch.

I also could've had jalape√±os and cilantro, but I decided to do without. I really must say that the bun does wonders for the sandwich because the crust is super crunchy, but not hard and the inside is soft. Everything together was super tasty!  As for the roasted pork banh mi, the pork could've been a little fattier (according not to my husband), but the crunchy pig skin was very crunchy.  His sandwich had the same fixings as mine and added just the right mix of flavours and textures as well.

The Chili had some flavor and the meat was tender. The collards were good, if a bit flavorless, but the bacon was mostly fat and really mushy. The bone broth was really sweet and otherwise flavorless, which I didn't understand. Bone broth is usually pretty good stuff. I can make slow cooker sized batch of bone broth that can serve at least 10 people, and I never pay more than 10 bucks (using organic ingredients). In the end, good idea for a food cart, but the prices were way too high for an essentially flavorless and tiny meal. Don't charge for novelty!"},{"name":"Fresh To Order","address":"860 Peachtree St NE, Ste B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"first time at f2o and I will never go to Panera again\\n\\nFresh to order is so tasty and around the same price.

I walked in around 3:30p.m. which is kinda bad since they close at 4:00p.m. but I always have a bad habit of going into places before they close (Yes, I am THAT person). \\n\\nWhen I walked in, the place was super busy! My boyfriend and I walked up to the counter and I was instantly greeted by EVERYONE, which was awesome but a tad bit overwhelming. As a food publicist, I analyze customer service, quality, and the way they sell. The barista started explaining coffees to me without even finding out what my needs were. When Vespr Craft Coffee opened up, I trained them on how to ask open ended questions and get to know the customer and what they wanted; this wasn't here, which made me kind of sad. However, the barista did redeem herself when I asked her about the food, which should be hanging UP on the boards and not on a little brochure. \\n\\nI ended up ordering a Turkish Latte (Totally ordered it after Julius from Droolius talked about it). The latte was yummy; I could taste the cardamom and other spices, which was a huge hit in my book since I am from India. My boyfriend got a latte because he's boring like that. We also ordered the Mediterranean platter, which was presented BEAUTIFULLY. However, I wish I was notified that the olives weren't pitted; it probably said it on the menu but the barista should totally remind the customer.\\n\\nThe only reason why I'm NOT giving Barnie's five stars is because one of the employees went around from table to table and checked on tables - with ours being the exception, of course. I've trained at least 4 coffee shops on how to follow up with customers, which includes coming by with a water pitcher. Another reason why Barnie's lost points is because we were served as if we were regulars. My boyfriend had NEVER been to Barnie's and was very excited to finally try it. However, no one bothered to really build a relationship with either of us and talk about the brand. \\n\\nOne of my friends works at the location and she was trained by me (She wasn't there), so I hope she will shed some customer service tips with the rest of the staff."},{"name":"Joe's Burgers","address":"7409 SW Bridgeport Rd","city":"Tigard","stars":"3","text":"My wife loves the idea of how we remember Joes.

Then the server explained the specials and we ordered a few small plates.  We got a Hamachi Tartare (out of the tuna)(13$).  This was light and refreshing with an avocado puree and even a little crunchy with some tempura flakes.  The duck quesadillas were rich and satisfying (12$).  I could have eaten about 300 of these.

So we were a little surprised when I came out, but it was pretty tasty regardless.\\nSo we sat and enjoyed a little longer.  We asked our server to surprise us with another small plate.

They now have gluten free buns.  They cost you a couple bucks more as you would expect.  The funny part is how they serve it.

I have no clue what kind of toxic sludge was used to make them that way so if I grow an extra nostril I'll know why.  Gluten free doesn't mean healthy, in the US it just means less than 20ppm of gluten in your foodstuff.\\n\\nThe burgers themselves are going to depend on which of the many burgers you order and if you eat like cookie monster or are a food snob.

I guess he had tunnel vision & did not see me sitting in the chair....I ordered a specific drink & the waiter was unsure if they even had the liquor I asked for . We proceeded to order chips & salsa and to my surprise they give you a basket of chips & what seems to be a 2oz cup of salsa for FIVE DOLLARS! Definitely not enough salsa for that price!! We ordered out food , which wasn't that great . I didn't even finish my meal I was so unimpressed. When the waiter came to check on us I told him I was finished , he looked at me and said ok...? And gave me this \\" what you want me to do about it\\" kind of look .i literally had to tell him to take my plate because I was finished eating! We decided to split a dessert .....

The ahi tuna appetizer was gelatinous and didn't appear fresh. They mention they roll it in soy sauce to make it brown looking but among all of us, it still was odd tasting and we've all had this very same dish at numerous other restaurants so we had a good sense on what 'fresh' smelled and tasted. No need to have to come to our table and debate this situation when it was hard enough for us to want to tell you.\\n\\nWine: They ran out of the one we wanted and brought a cheaper California version out as a substitute.  At our suggestion we asked if we could get the same kind of bottle of wine that was a little bit pricier for the same price as the one they didn't have and not from California. They were willing and this was appreciated.\\n\\nBathrooms:  Clean but no toilet paper to be located anywhere.  Strange for an opening week when you really are hoping to do it right.\\n\\nNoise level: They are cranking metal and alternative rock really loud in a new Mediterranean food restaurant?  I think this spot used to be a cheesy bar and now it's keeping that bar like quality?  Definitely need to change that music but after all our disappointments we didn't have the heart to tell them.\\n\\nWaitstaff - The waitstaff were doing their best and I think maybe first timers?  They didn't seem to have experience for what this restaurant was trying to represent...ie: they might have had bar/lounge experience but not fine dining experience?    Perhaps bring napkins, silverware and extra plates before food comes out so people don't sit and wait for that while the food gets cold?  Bring items when requested and don't need to be reminded.  Perhaps though they couldn't hear us over the ridiculously loud music.\\n\\nThey also brought us dessert on the house (tiramisu) as I guessed they could sense we weren't quite having a good first time experience.  However I think that wasn't the best way to handle this. We were being kind, genuine and maybe just ask how you could do things better rather than stick a dessert in front of us. Especially when we don't eat desert and it's basically a lot of whipped cream vs. a genuinely well made tiramisu?\\n\\nWe just didn't get a high quality, fresh food vibe from this place. The website seems to try to 'market' this approach but we just didn't experience that.

The noodles were chewy and so fresh. The sauce is out of this world delicious. Then we ordered veggie pan fried dumplings. I'm not a huge dumpling fan but these were super delicious.

The kitchen was a little slow that night but it was a Friday and this is understandable when it is busy. Well our orders got messed up and I am unsure if it was an error by the server or the kitchen but again this isn't important, again these things happen. The server apologized and had a manager come speak with us.\\nThe manager said she was sorry and asked if she could get us some appetizers she could rush right out because our dinners would take a little while. She suggested these lobster spring rolls which were delicious and something else I cannot recall. We ate them and our dinners came out, she checked it was alright when it did and it all seemed to be fine until we were done and got our check.\\nWe got the bill and the appetizers she offered us were on there. We told our server who apologized and got the manager. Mind you we ate our dinners and they were great and I am not looking for a free ride but the appetizers she offered to hold us over while they remade our messed up order? \\nShe came over and asked what the problem was with our bill and I told her it was that we were charged for the appetizers she offered us.\\nShe very rudely said, \\"that is typically how it works when you order something at a restaurant. It goes on your bill.\\" \\nShe said this and the table behind us heard and laughed at us. It was humiliating. I wasn't asking for my meal free which most restaurants would offer when they messed up. Just the apps she offered. Is this her up sell scam? Mess up my order to get me to buy apps I didn't want in the first place??\\nI didn't know how else to respond I was so shocked she said this to us. She then said \\"if I need to take them off your bill to make you happy I guess I'll do that\\"\\nI said no forget it. I was embarrassed because she made us look like we were cheap jerks to the other customers and just wanted to get out of there. I used to come to the chart house at least once a month. It was our night out go to choice but not anymore unless I find out this lady is gone. I certainly wouldn't feel comfortable there now and this is so disappointing because this was my spot.

I was not given the option to choose a temperature for my meat. After waiting ten minutes for my food and seeing the thickness or rather slimness of the burger patty, I could see why.

No reservations, but only a 5-10 minute wait. My wife and I shared a family salad for two, and an individual carciofi pizza. The salad was pretty big, plenty for us both, and the pizza had a real nice crust, but not burnt (or well done, as some claim) as so often happens with wood and coal-fired pizza ovens. \\n\\nWe did enjoy our meal, and the only reason for four stars, instead of five is that I save five for a really great experience, and even though we were seated pretty close to the bus station at the far end of the restaurant, we had a hard time getting out server's attention.

The buffalo chicken flatbread was ok. nothing special plenty of chicken but it seemed soggy and too much cheese for flatbread. Lobster Bisque had cheese in it really cheese in lobster bisque how strange. Mac and cheese was so bland and watered down it went back after 1 bite. Kraft makes a better one  and I hate Kraft mac and cheese so that gives you something to compare it too. The sushi was great tho, I am not a sushi fan but my friend is so I tried it.

I enjoy the atmosphere, the friendly service and of course the food, which has always been consistently great.  I decided to go for dinner this week after about a year of not visiting and again was not disappointed in any way.   Teatro remains solidly good in my opinion.\\n\\nOn a miserably rainy Tuesday I arrived with my friend without reservation at the surprisingly busy restaurant.   We did look for a seat at their small but busy bar and decided that the main restaurant was the only option.  Greeted by a very friendly host we told them we had no reservation to which he said \\"not a problem, please follow me.\\"  We were seated in the center row of the restaurant very close to two other tables.  Teatro definitely keeps it cozy.  \\n\\nI love the architecture of Teatro with its high ceilings made for a cavernous and loud atmosphere. This is definitely one of those places where if you want a quiet dinner, this is not the place.  However, if you want something fun, noisy and where you can hear someone else's conversation, this place is perfect.  The design of the ceiling is striking white and pale blue and I love the open kitchen.  The people watching is quite interesting from the business crowd, to the pre- and after-theater crowd, to the girls on a random mid-week night out, like us.\\n\\nTheir menu is Italian inspired with lots of tasty options from small plates to share to pastas offering half and full portions to crispy flatbread pizzas and more serious entrees of sirloin steak and seared scallops.  \\n\\nOur evening started with fresh, soft bread and garlic hummus while we looked at the menu.  \\n\\nWe were all about trying lots of different things and sharing.  Looking through the smaller plate options we started with the Whipped Ricotta.  It was quite possibly one of the most heavenly dishes I have had in ages and could have easily doubled up as a dessert.  Served with crispy bread we put large dollops of this white, super creamy ricotta, drizzled with sweet honey and olive oil onto our bread, took a bite and then had a moment of silence.  It was fantastic! High praise for something so simple.\\n\\nNext was the Truffled deviled Eggs.  I am a huge fan of deviled eggs and these; small little numbers laced with a hint of truffle were really quite tasty. \\nThe Tuna Tartare, our third choice for small bites was very prettily presented in a little bowl filled with fresh tiny chopped melt in your mouth tuna with a sharp kick of lime, crunchy cucumber and a bite of chili.  Lovely.\\n\\nFour our entree dishes we shared the Mushroom Pizza and Fetucelle with Rock Shrimp pasta dish.  \\n\\nThe pasta is crisp and flat with a thin layer of olive oil and strewn with earthy mushrooms and spoonfuls of goat cheese across the pizza, which I happily spread over the mushroom.  I do like crispy thin pizza and I loved this tomato' less based version.   \\n\\nWe ordered the half portion of pasta, which is absolutely more than an enough.  Large spaghetti pasta cooked perfectly al dente with chunks of chopped sweet shrimp and tomatoes with a lemon infused buttery taste.  The pasta is a little too garlicky for me, however my friend loved it.   \\n\\nTeatro is such a fun dining experience for any occasion.

While eating here, I thought to myself that when people talk about great restaurants in Austin, eating here would definitely give someone that impression; and deservedly so. The Butternut Squash Manti was exceptional and the Sweet Potato Moussaka and Pan Seared Salmon were excellent as well.  A misstep was the burger. It was medium done and we ordered medium rare. It was really salty, the pickles weren't very good and overall it was disappointing, especially when compared to the other delectable items they have. They gave us macaroons at the end which, while far from the best macaroons ever, was a nice touch.\\n\\nI look forward to dining here again."},{"name":"Zyka","address":"1677 Scott Blvd","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"We went with a group so we got quite a few things to share including Chicken Boti; Chicken 65; Butter Chicken; Chana Masala; Mutton Masala; Mutton Biryani; and another dish with some potato dumpling things.  The sauces were amazing!  The mutton masala was tender and the sauce was my favorite, but the chana masala was my favorite dish of the night.  I would suggest ordering the raita if you're going to get the Chicken 65.  My favorite version of Chicken 65 is the non-fried version at Bhojanic, but this is my favorite fried/authentic version.  The servings are not huge - they are individual sized servings - but still large enough to share with others if you plan for 1 entr√©e per person.\\n\\nThe prices were extremely reasonable.  It's not fancy or pretentious.\\n\\nA few other reviews I've read were upset with the Styrofoam plates, etc. but I couldn't care less about what the food was served on as long as it was good - and I thought it was.  You bus your own table, so it makes clean up easier.  For first timers it can be a little intimidating if you don't have someone to tell you the process.  When you go, grab a menu off the front counter and get in line (it might be a good idea to have one member of your party grab a table if you're in line on a busy night).  The cashier is trying to get through the line as quickly as possible and doesn't offer suggestions or upsells.  You do need to order saffron rice and/or naan separately if you want either.  Drinks are in a can so suck it up if you want a refill and buy another.  There are pitchers and Styrofoam cups available if you want water for the table - again, it's serve yourself for the water.  Once you've placed your order and you've paid, you can wait at your table for them to call your name.  As for the one reviewer who said that you get funny looks if you're not Indian, well, I didn't notice any funny looks from the other patrons, but who cares about looks from other people - just enjoy your dinner."},{"name":"Chez Rama Restaurant","address":"3669 E Livingston Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"The food here surpasses anything I have ever had.

Would love to see their menu grow over time! Recommended if you live in the Brentwood area."},{"name":"Wildfire","address":"94 Perimeter Ctr W","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"The Perimeter Mall area continues to get inundated with new restaurants, to the point where they must have reached market saturation at this point. The two latest entries to the area are literally located in the mall parking lot- Seasons 52 and Wildfire. Last night, a fellow foodie and I decided to check out Wild Fire, a Steakhouse concept by the same folks who introduced Maggiano's.\\n\\nWildfire has been open a couple of months now, and it appears to have generated a strong amount of interest. Being a Wednesday night, I was shocked at the line of people waiting to be seated. Thank God we had a reservation, or we may have been SOL. But here is something I don't understand. The place knows they are popular. They also know that in most cases they are making a first impression. Then you better have enough bartenders to handle folks while they wait for a table. There were only two bartenders, and one was primarily focused on making drinks for the dining room, leaving one overwhelmed soul to take care of a packed bar. Needless to say, having a drink while we waited for our table was a complete chore. So, again, my advice to you, make a reservation....especially if you go on a weekend.\\n\\nThe dining room atmosphere is an open set up, with lots of wood and stone. You definitely get the feeling that this not a place for the faint of stomach. And while the noise level can be quite high, but there is a certain energy that I found appealing. The service is decent, but one sin they committed was they brought the entrees before clearing the appetizer plates. You expect this at Outback, but when you spend $30 for a steak, I don't want to be rushed.\\n\\nFor starters, we split an order of sweet & sour calamari, and an order of shrimp stuffed with crabmeat. The calamari was awesome! Many times, calamari can be mistaken for rubber bands. This calamari was extremely tender, and the sweet and sour glaze was a unique touch. I can't speak as glowingly of the shrimp and crabmeat dish, however. The four medium-sized shrimp sat in a 1/4\\" puddle of oil with crabmeat more in the puddle than stuffed in the shrimp. I am not exactly sure how you would stuff shrimp that small anyway.\\n\\nThen, it was on to the steaks. Wildfire offers the standard selection of cuts- several filet mignons, NY strips, ribeyes, etc. I was in the mood for a filet after having one completely overcooked at Ruth's Chris last weekend. I added the blue cheese dressing and I need to stop doing that, as only Chops has done it well lately. The blue cheese topping at Wildfire sat on the meat like a pancake. The consistency was hard and grainy, and was too thick. I wound up scraping most of it off. The meat, however, was cooked to perfection and was very tender. Not qualms about that at all.\\n\\nThe main upside for Wildfire is value. For an upscale steakhouse (remember, this isn't Long Horn), you get a very good steak, at prices about 20% less than others in that category (my filet was a decent size and $28). Furthermore, you get a choice of side with your entre, so they don't get you with a ton of a la carte add-ons. The quality of meat is right up there with the big boys as well. The sides options aren't great, but hell, that's not why I go to a Steakhouse. And the service can be a little refined. But these are all nits. If you are in the mood for a good steak, but don't want to shell out $80-100 per person to do it, Wildfire is a strong choice.\\n\\nSteakhead Recommends: Yes\\nPrice: $$$"},{"name":"Sugidama Soba & Izakaya","address":"260 Elm St, Ste 106","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"This is a great \\"hidden\\" gem in Davis Square.

I suggested farm-to-table, and Clyde Commons was close enough to work to warrant a lunch-time visit.\\n\\nWow! The staff was wonderful. The chef was so excited about the eggs that he threw a few appetizers our way as a quick thanks, and the food was stellar! We shared the pickles (the smoked egg is, without a doubt, the most succulent, delicious way I've ever enjoyed an egg), popcorn in an Old Bay sort of seasoning blend, a crustini with fennel and sardines, and the chef even prepared us each one of her eggs over easy! I thought I would be stuffed after the appetizers, but our main courses were too good to pass up. I had the butternut squash ravioli in an apple-cream sauce, which our waiter aptly recommended as spring's version of a fall favorite. It wasn't overbearingly heavy or sweet, just tasty. My coworker enjoyed the lavender lemonade (which she said wasn't too lavender-y, which I take to be a good thing), and the trout with shrimp mousse, grits and etouffe. \\n\\nLunch went a bit long with all of the different plates, but they were timed with precision and I never felt like I was overwhelmed by the number of options. We were in a little late at 1 p.m. and safely missed the lunch rush, so even sitting at a big table we were all by ourselves, which I did appreciate. \\n\\nClyde Commons has a good thing going on.

So we were about half way through the chips before our waitress came and took our drink order.  The drinks were ok; I think they are pretty expensive.  We missed Happy Hour.  I enjoy Margarita's but that glass is just too heavy!  It took a long time to get our food, and when it came out it wasn't very hot. By this time our drinks were long gone.  We tried to get our waitress's eye, but that just didn't happen.  Finally the cranky looking red haired hostess saw us and sent over the salsa girl.  We ordered more drinks, and I asked them to Microwave my food.  Apparently they don't have one, which is too bad because all I wanted was for it to be hot.  They made me a whole new plate which took forever again. Everyone one else was done by time it came out and the restaurant was pretty much empty.   I'm really not sure how the food was.

As it stood we had limited time, money and transport, but the hotel concierge told us there was no reason to travel to Richmond and recommended Hon's, which was right around the corner. \\n\\nHon's is a huge bustling casual restaurant with five labeled kitchens: vegetarian, chef's specialties, BBQ, Wun Tun, and Potstickers. The vegetarian menu contains dozens of items. While there I tried the fried bean curd skin veggie dish and the enoki mushroom bean noodle dish both of which were very tasty. Their wun tun soup is also quite good with a rich delicious broth. \\n\\nHon's menu lists many items but it's mainly a noodle house with a little dim sum and some other savory dishes. While you'll find authentic and different things here, it's not really a place to go for fancy dining with tons of seafoods and meats or labor intensive meals.  I saw a lot of people ordering the potstickers which looked like they had a fairly thin skin like the Wun Tuns. So little time, so much Dim Sum! I wanted to try the Chinese doughnut but the first time I was by myself and it was huge, and later on my traveling companion wasn't that interested in it - the sesame balls we ordered after one meal were hot, fresh and gooey.\\n\\nBased on this experience I'd say it's probably true that the Chinese food experience in Vancouver is different than in San Francsico. The flavors and textures of the fried bean curd skin were interesting and fresh and the black bean was delicious. And I really noticed that the service was exceptionally friendly - much moreso than in San Francisco.\\n\\nI do wish we had time to try more diverse places in Vancouver including a higher-end one, but trying Hon's was fun since I mostly eat in workaday Chinese places at home.

Between the inebriated Buckhead Betty who broke the leg of her chair and fell on the floor twice within an hour period, the tired old cougar preying on anything with a pulse and a Y chromosome, and the endless sea of frat boys with feathered Bieber cuts and gingham button downs in every color imaginable - there was enough entertainment to warrant an admission charge. Needless to say, if this place doesn't get you laid, then nothing will. Oh yeah, and the barbecue isn't anything to scoff at. \\n\\nFood: Smokebelly is a Southern barbecue restaurant will some contemporary twists. The menu includes both smoked and non-smoked meats using both wet and dry rubs, as well as appetizers and salads. Meat options include brisket, ribs, turkey, sausage, and pulled pork - besides chicken wings on the appetizer menu, there were no other chicken options on the menu, which was surprising. Approximately a half dozen different barbecue sauces are available, which can be accessed at your table and at self service counters in the middle of the dining room. In addition to the complimentary pork rinds that are served, our party of six opted for several different appetizers, including the pimento cheese, smoked salmon dip, disco fries, and fried pickled okra - all of which were quite good. For an entree, I had the baby back ribs with the mac n' cheese and chilled sweet corn and edamame succotash. The succotash and ribs were good, but the mac 'n cheese was a disappointment - it tasted as if it had been sitting underneath a heat lamp for twenty minutes before it was served and was arguably among the worst i've had in a barbecue restaurant in Atlanta.   \\n\\nService: We had two waitresses, one of which was in training - both were very friendly and capable of answering questions about the menu. However, the expediency of the kitchen left much to be desired - we waited an excruciatingly long time for the food to arrive, to the point where the waitresses apologized at least a half dozen times between the two of them. The restaurant had been open over a month at this point, so the delay was simply inexcusable - meanwhile, a gentleman who appeared to be the manger or owner was too preoccupied with flirting with a table of young co-eds than getting the kitchen staff in gear. \\n\\nAtmosphere: The ambience of this place is really quite impressive. The dining room consists of a large open room flanked by two separate bar areas - it opens up into a large patio. There's also a small stage area in the back corner - it looked like live entertainment was in the works during my Friday evening visit, but we left before they started. The clientele is skewed toward the 20-30 demographic, but there were also several larger groups with children - for the most part, the demographic was about what you'd expect for Buckhead. \\n\\nCost: Appropriately priced for the food quality, portions, and location. Appetizers are $5-$10, barbecue plates are $10-$17 (including two sides), sandwiches are $8-$12, salads are $8-$10, and sides are $3. Bar snacks are $3-$4 and specialty cocktails are $7-$10. \\n\\nOther: Smokebelly is located in the spot formerly occupied by Tavern 99 and is operated by the same team behind Milton's and The Big Ketch. Lunch and Dinner are served. Hours of operation are: Monday-Thursday, 11:30AM-3PM and 5PM-10PM; Friday, 11:30AM-3PM and 5PM-11PM; Saturday, 11:30AM-11PM; and Sunday, 11:30AM-10PM.

Well why not? \\n\\nTROY: Ok, okay...I have to say that you are quick to judge this place on poor service.  It should be fine, as long as you know what to order and how to order it.  Please Deke, this is WAY better than Subway, it's more like a Panera.\\n\\nDEREK: I ordered a salami muffaletta after discovering that their corned beef and pastrami is portioned out into little baggies. Once again no competition for Danny's Deli of course. The muffaletta comes with a signature olive mix that overpowers and basically ruins the entire sandwich. EEEWWWW! The crusty muffaletta bread is good but simply doesn't make up for the stuff between the bread. I would suggest to go light on the mix if you try it. \\n\\nTROY: First of all, if you compare every single corned beef sandwich to Danny's Deli then you are setting yourself up for failure time after time.  I don't buy a Corvette and complain that it's not a Ferrari, I enjoy the ride.  And you said that they had pretty good salami, just not as good as Brown Bag Deli.\\n\\nSecond, I absolutely agree that the sandwich was way too olive-y...yuck (and I like olives).  It's their signature sandwich, but you'll need to customize it to better fit your tastes.  BTW, the meats are in portioned bags for portion control and to speed up the order.  Waaa!\\n\\nDEREK: So Troy? ---  you build your own sandwich...after you ordered directly off the menu and made 20 different changes, did the food come out properly? Yea right ---- Well don't feel bad cause mine was wrong too. Even though they completely remade our order it was frustrating to have not one, but both orders come out wrong. \\n\\nTROY: I ordered the Club Royale but made some changes: turkey, roast beef instead of ham, bacon, pepper-jack instead of swiss, cheddar, tomato, lettuce, add sprouts, stone ground mustard instead of honey mustard.  The croissant was absolutely amazing!  If you like sandwiches, you'll love this one, as long as they get it right.\\n\\nTROY: I accept that the more customized my order is, the greater the room for error...that being said, they can really screw up a sandwich.  The kid that took the order wrote it down his way, then the sandwich maker interpreted it a different way.  There isn't any reason they should have messed up your sandwich, but unfortunately they did and left a bad taste in your mouth (olive, haha).\\n\\nTROY: The manager was quick to correct the mistake and made sure it was right.  I appreciated him apologizing and handling the whole situation himself.  They may not have hit their stride yet, but they will, and it'll be better.\\n\\nDEREK: Surprise of the visit was a total lack of quality from a restaurant/menu that truly has the makings to be good. Lots of choices and combinations that should fit the bill, but the assembly line and chain experience here just make you leave dissatisfied.\\n\\nTROY: My surprise of the visit was overwhelming variety of choice, combined with fresh endless salad bar, endless pickles (Claussen), great drink bar choices, and the complimentary soft serve ice cream with your meal.\\n\\nTROY: Look, I have eaten here 3 times in the past month, that is a good endorsement.  I have tried to hit on a variety of items to get a good feel for this place and I will continue to visit.

I love the decor, from stunning chandeliers, to the hanging tea cups from brunches, to the beautiful quotas on the wall, and white walls with highlights of pinks and pastel coulors.\\nThe menu was a little overwhelming but I knew I was there for, High Tea of course!!  And we were glad we choose it.  My friend and I both decided on the Neverland High Tea for $30.  Also has an option for a demi half for $18.   The menu offers other food items not just high tea.  \\nI started with a heavenly Earl grey.   Very nice and smooth.  Tea is unlimited and feel free to try different flavours.  I prefer black tea with my high tea.  I also tried hazelnut tea, lovely brought me to a very happy place.  \\nWhen our 3 tier high tea came, not only was it beautiful it also tasted delicious!  When our server was describing what we were about to eat, I completely ignored what she was saying and was taken by the smells of the pastries.  They had a Christmas themed high tea.  The smell of cinnamon and ginger enlightened my senses.  I was very excited but the smell it was nothing compared to the taste.  \\nWe started from the bottom worked our way up.  The bottom had dainty sandwiches.  From traditional cucumber sandwiches to smoke salmon, the plate came with 5 sandwiches.  My favourite would have to be the croissant, it was perfect!  We skipped the middle treats to go directly to the top that had the scone with jam & Devonshire cream.   Omg was it delightful, brought me to a happy place.  The scone was buttery and not too hard topped with jam and cream I could have just had that and be content.  \\nWe still had our middle tier, by this time I was getting full, but not before tasting a couple of treats.  I tried the cream puff filled with Nutella, you had me at Nutella.  The rest I saved for home.   It also included mini cupcake with a ginger bread, several cookies and cake.  \\nI really didn't want to leave this place, but my tummy was happy and my legs told me I had to get up and move before I passed out.

Beware that things can get a bit salty. When I remember, I always ask to go easy on the salt.\\n\\nNotable hits:\\n- Cumin lamb stir-fried noodles: ask for the blade-sheared noodles for this dish for some extra chewiness. It's an explosion of cumin flavour in the mouth!\\n- Xi'an cold steamed noodles: the chilli sesame sauce combines together very nicely for a bull body of flavour.\\n- Sichuan meat salad:  I love this. It's spicy and slightly tongue numbing from the peppercorn, yet the sesame oil leaves a very fragrant aftertaste. Very refreshing appetizer.\\n- Sweet rice wine fish: I'm generally not a fan of non-minimalist cooked fish, so this was a pleasant surprise. The flavour was dimensional (sweet and sour), yet delicate and suited the fish.\\n- Chilli garlic eggplant: hit the spot! Get a bowl of rice with this one for sure, and just start pa fan. \\n- Peaceful beef rolls: love the flaky pastry.\\n\\nNotable misses:\\n- Chilli garlic shredded pork: aka fish-flavoured pork. Very much lacking in  the signature fragrant vinegar flavour. \\n- Sichuan thousand chilli chicken: deep fried chicken pieces stir fried with lots of dried chilli and peppercorn. This dish looked super appetizing (if you're a big fan of spicy food), but very disappointing in flavour. The chilli and peppercorn did not add any flavour and the chicken was dry and bland.\\n- Beijing ZhaJiangMian noodle: bland bland bland.\\n- Dan dan noodles: salty salty salty. Not memorable.\\n\\nDiners, Drive-in's and Dives, the Food Network show, recently filmed an episode here. I have no doubts they'll feature the beef rolls and one of their hand-made noodles.

Not!!!\\n\\nI confess (and I rarely do), sometimes I will suffer crap more than once if a relative, or a friend, just has some indestructable urge to roll in it.  I'm referring, specifically, to some of the elders in my neck of the woods who remember Stromberg's from it's \\"Glory Days.\\"  But, something happened since then -- either the new bridge diverted traffic just enough to make a difference, or the owners passed it on to the kids, I don't know, but for LOOOONG time, something just ain't been right.\\n\\nSo to make it easy on the eyes, I'm going to LIST the things any considering Stromberg's should know:\\n\\n1. The very first thing to greet you, other than the weeds and tall grass growing out of the curb and street (I don't care if you don't own the dead end of the street; if people have to use it to park for your business, pay someone $10 to get a weedwhacker and make it presentable), is the unmistakable scent of urinal cake, right when you walk in the front door.\\n\\nThere is absolutely NOTHING better than a mix of ineffective urinal cake, and bathroom stank to ruin even the appetite of a marine platoon that just ran 50 miles for 3 days with no food or water.\\n\\n2.  Then, you are next greeted by... (ready?)... NO ONNNNNNNNNNEEE!!!!!\\n\\nThat's right.  You, my dear friend, are a mere nuisance to the people standing around talking at the bar.  In fact, sometimes, you can't even tell if they're employees, or customers, or employee's partners, or a liquor salesman.  You just look at them, they just look at you.  As if they're waiting for one of the pleasant, but harried, waiters to come seat you.  \\n\\nThere should be no urinal cake... and there should be a greeting within 20-30 seconds of arrival.\\n\\n3. Despite the urinal cake stank and having to send up a flare to get seated, it is still a very wise choice to request seating inside.  I know, I know, \\"But Eric, it's such a lovely day outside.  I really want to sit outside so my aging mother can appreciate the beautiful weather.\\"  I suppose that's ok but your choice from then on becomes very limited, and very grim.\\n\\na. Do you want your mother to get something to eat and, therefore, LIVE?\\nb. Or do you want to wait forever to get ANYTHING, including a greeting, and watch her slowly starve and, possibly, DIE?\\n\\nI'm not kidding.  The only ones happy at the outdoor seating area are the seagulls.  Seriously, if you are going to risk sitting outside and are feeling pretty hungry, KNOW WHAT YOU WANT QUICKLY AND IF SOMEONE TAKES YOUR DRINK ORDER, MAKE SURE TO ORDER YOUR APPETIZERS WITH IT OR YOU WON'T BE EATING FOR A WHILE.\\n\\nDo not ever let the server off the hook, you must be 2 steps ahead, ordering things sooner than normal because you really run the risk of not seeing a server again for a while each time s/he walks away.\\n\\n4. So, you brave the urinal cakes and the lackluster, camouflaged employees who eyeball you before they seat you and, on the way to the dining area, you have to walk by the bar.  Now, I'm not gonna make a big fuss out of this, but a lot of restaurants keep the drunks completely separate from the diners.  Do you want your 8-yr old daughter walking past a bunch of drunk strangers on her way to the stinky bathroom?\\n\\nI didn't think so.\\n\\n5.  I can't speak for anyone else who's been there other than the one's I was with, but on a couple of occasions, the soups were pretty salty and the fish was just so-so.  If one must go here, I think they are more safe sticking to the appetizer's.  But, if you can make it past those urinal cakes, chances are, you can't smell and, therefore, can probably eat anything.  I wish you luck.\\n\\nI can't speak for the Black Lobster out back, not my kinda place.\\n\\nBut, really, I'm not a bad guy.  So, I'm going to list the things I like about Stromberg's just to be fair:\\n\\n1. The seagulls.  When my food arrives cold, it's kind of a saving grace to throw it to the seagulls and watch them fight for it.  For some odd, low-class, reason, I can never get enough of that free entertainment.  And none of the other diners ever seem to mind, probably because for the 30 minutes prior, in which we were all waiting for our waiters and food to appear, I could overhear some pretty colorful conversations that very closely matched my dining sentiments.\\n\\n2.  There's a couple people on the waitstaff who are very friendly.  I don't know why they stay there, but, then again, I don't know why some people stay in abusive relationships.  And, it's none of my business, either.  But, I had to mention this so the ones who know they're nice know this isn't about them.\\n\\nConclusion:  Stromberg either needs to be completely LEVELED and have new management put up a whole new SURF N TURF restaurant; OR, they just need another serious overhaul that caters to an easy-going, middle class, crowd who simply want nothing more than a pleasant, family-oriented meal.\\n\\nIs that too much to ask?

And every time I've ordered a plain bean burrito it's been accompanied by something of an argument -- \\"you sure? that's all you want? no meat at all?\\" -- which makes ordering a little annoying.  Worse, that bean burrito often arrives with random bits of \\"bonus\\" meat in it anyhow.

We will need you to keep your tray tables down and your seat back in the full and upright position (because you really shouldn't eat laying down, it's not safe.) Relax and enjoy the flight, because at Volate Farms we will all be flying first class. \\n\\nAfter take off, we will be serving up a perfectly curated bakery section, featuring famous New England apple cider doughnuts. The choices here are so thoughtful, and the flavors truly embody what we all love about New England cuisine. Brown Sugar. Cinnamon. Pumpkin. Maple. Dark Chocolate. Perfect.\\n\\nWe will then be stopping by the Meat and Cheese section. Featuring an unparalleled selection of organic local products. The meat is fresh, deep in flavor, and responsibly raised in local New England farms. This is not the Stop and Shop meat counter. \\n\\nNext, we will bring you to the world famous produce section. This is the true heart and soul of Volante Farms. These are the seeds that have grown this beloved farm stand into what it is today. 100 Years ago, this corner had a small farm stand, 20 years ago it had farm house, and today it is a beautifully constructed and multi-faceted marketplace. It becomes obvious that Volante Farms truly does reap what they sow.  \\n\\nWe will also be serving alcohol on this flight. A large selection of craft beer and wine is available on your right. Please ask our experienced flight attendants for recommendations. \\n\\nAs we begin our descent, we would like to offer you complimentary Crescent Ridge ice cream.  (It's actually not free, you have to pay for it) \\n\\nAnd now we are landing at the final destination. The Sandwich Counter. Here you will experience one of the premiere sandwiches in the Boston metro area. The Volante sandwich represents the Volante name with much aplomb. The meat quality, the unique spice blend in the homemade relish, the high quality and authentic Italian meats. I recommend the sesame seed roll as it adds earthy and deep nuttiness to the otherwise sharp and salty flavors present. The fresh mozzarella cools down the experience, bringing balance and lightness. \\n\\nThank you for flying with Volante Farms.

Known for their freshly made signature  noodles, we ordered a bowl with spinach mixed with other greens. The soup tasted bland, so we asked the server if we can have another one. They returned with the same bowl, only this time the soup really rocked. We also ordered their beef Bannock and it was excellent. Probably, one of the most tastiest I've ever had.  I ordered a Beef and tomato fried rice that was pretty good. Although I wasn't expecting them to use a purple colored rice that was rather grainy in texture, I still found the saucy dish quite tasty.  It's best to arrive early, especially during dinner time and no later than 5:30 pm. This location seats about 50 and parking can be hard to find. There's pay parking outside on Broadway, but if you look hard enough,  you can find free parking a little further away.The service was good and their prices are reasonable; however, their dish portion is nothing to get excited about.

Definitely not as fancy as Cafe Bombay, but much cheaper and  just as delicious.\\n\\nI ordered the Mutton Biryani as recommended by the cashier, while my friend ordered a veggie curry. We split an order of the saffron rice (it comes with a lot), and each ordered a serving of naan. Both were delicious, but I preferred my mutton entree. Contrary to Joe L., both me and my friend were stuffed halfway through our curries--probably because of the carb overload from the naan and rice. We ended up taking our leftovers to go, which I again thoroughly enjoyed for dinner. \\n\\nAs with most Indian/Asian restaurants, the service was perfunctory but quick. The food came out very quickly. As far as ambience goes, there really isn't much to speak of.

But my meat friends say the meat is equally as irresistible (and the meat eaters even love the vegetarian options) \\n\\nThe kids of Pho Hoa (a long time family-owned hole-in-the-wall mediocre Vietnamese restaurant) took over the space, redid the menu, renovated it to look stunningly beautiful. Mom is still in the kitchen and they've introduced unique dishes from across Vietnam.\\n\\nVietnamese in general: First of all it's hard as a vegetarian to find Vietnamese places that have vegetarian friendly options without fish sauce or meat broth. This place, although I haven't yet tried the pho (noodle soup), has THE BEST vegetarian soy sauce. It's a secret. I asked. The owner's mom makes it. And she won't even tell her kids what's in it. I told them they can bottle it and sell it. It's easy for meat eaters to just add fish sauce to make things taste good, but to find the perfect veggie friendly sauce with a balance of sweet, salty, and tangy is hard to come across. They nailed it. \\n\\nVegetarian Vietnamese: I love Chau Veggie express (also modern Vietnamese inspired). I love Baoguette, which offers veggie broths, veggie curry, and amazing veggie Banh Mi (Vietnamese subs). But I think Anh & Chi steals my heart for number one. Maybe I just needed some new variety. And they didn't disappoint. Usually, as a vegetarian, there is 1 (MAYBE 2) options for you to choose from. Here there were sooo many, my head was going to explode. Or I just had to come back to try more things. I opted for the second choice. \\n\\n\\"B√°nh X√®o\\"- Crispy Tofu & Shitake Mushroom Crepe: woah! Mind blown. And (not that I care) it's gluten free. Deliciously crispy crepe is filled with tofu, Shitake mushrooms, bean sprouts. You cut it, add pickled daikon & carrots, add basil (and some other leaf that had a foreign and distinct taste) then add sauce, wrap it in Lettuce and enjoy. A lot. It's HUGE and I shared it with my sister and we could barely finish the other things we ordered. \\n\\n\\"Cay Me\\"- Veg tofu salad rolls: yum. Pretty standard. They make it special by adding the crispy crunchy bits of the deep fried rice paper inside which gives great texture. $4 for 2 rolls. Great price. \\n\\n\\"Cha Gio\\"- veg crispy spring rolls: great. Comparable to other places. But they take the presentation up a few notches and add lettuce so you can kind of feel less guilty for eating a deep fried log of heaven. \\n\\nGreen beans & tofu: YUMMMMMM. Salty, garlicky, and sooo much flavor. What's so special about green beans? I've had many that just aren't as good as these ones! It just tastes so damn good. They do it right. \\n\\nSalad: I think I had the mango or the pineapple one. But I'm not sure. It was amazing- fresh and tangy. It's not a lettuce type of salad. More like chunks of pickled or marinated vegetables and fruit to create a fresh balanced crunchy party. \\n\\nAubergine (roasted eggplant): pretty good. I still like JAPANESE eggplant (Nasu dengasu) better cuz they add a miso flavor. But still great. Simple eggplant, enjoyed for its natural flavors, and everything comes with dipping sauce. \\n\\nOwners: you can tell they are fiercely proud. They come and check on every table personally to make sure the food is good. I commented on how stunning the decor was and he said \\"more importantly how was the food?\\" They have successfully modernized a family business to carry on a new generation and legacy of their parents, who I'm sure we're immigrants.

I ordered a grilled cheese with bacon and onions and it was pretty good, but there could have been more cheese. It was a little dry. My iced latte was really good. Great coffee in my opinion. I would have liked to see a larger pastry selection, but I am hoping that they just had a busy morning ran out of a lot of stuff before I arrived. A lot of vegetarian options as well. I was looking for more of a brunch type place, and I wouldn't call Crema that. There menu selection wasn't as large as a typical restaurant with a full brunch/breakfast menu, but as a coffee shop it is definitely top notch.

Score! Who can say no to free food? We just had to bring in a printed flyer. There were at least 15-20 of us who came in. \\n\\nNOTE 2: If you're into burgers and want to compare it to fancier burgers, this will NOT be the place for you. Cheeseburger Bobby's is a simple burger joint. \\n\\nParking - there is a lot. You may have to wait around 3 mins to park during lunch time, but Cheeseburger Bobby's shares the lot with other shops. Therefore..... parking is awesome :) \\n\\nI really like how they have all the toppings and etc in a buffet form next to the cashier. It was great! I'm not a burger fan, so I tend to pick certain items for my rare burger times haha. They also have duplicates of sauces next to the buffet. (mostly 2 Ketchups/2 Mustards/etc.) This is why I gave an extra star. \\n\\nThe burger itself was free, but not bad. A nice quick lunch. I figure this place is like 5 Guys, so... I'm assuming same quality. My food came out ~10 mins after I ordered. \\n\\nNot sure if this is normal, but as we were eating, they were giving out free fries. And it was A LOT of free fries. I'm really unsure if it's b/c we had the free flyers or just b/c it was a Friday thing. Fries themselves were ok. Not as good as CFA's, but decent enough. It was free, I'm really not complaining. \\n\\nInside - they had several booths and 2 man top tables with 1 (?) long table that could be broken of into 2s or could fit 8 people at once.

It's because of the quantity and service.\\n\\nI came here last night (10/18/2014) with my girlfriend after an awesome fun filled day is Salem. We arrived around 7:30 and were both extremely hungry. The hostess said she would not be able to sit us until 9:00, unless we sat at the bar which had open tables. My girlfriend and I really didn't care where we sat and are very easy going people, so we took a seat in the bar area. To start off, our server was very monotone; and really wasn't friendly at all. In hindsight, that's fine with me...as long as you do your job and serve me, I'll leave you 25%. I was a server for 6 years and am extremely understanding and uncritical when it comes to serving.\\n\\nAnyways, she took our drink order we also ordered an appetizer of grilled calamari (9$). The drinks were fantastic. The cocktails are around 10-12$, but they make them very strong and super tasty. \\n\\nWhen the calamari came out, I was in shock. It was literally 5 pieces of calamari. I really wish I was joking, but I'm not. I understand that this is more of an \\"up scale restaurant\\", but I have eaten at many upscale restaurants, but never have I been so disgusted with the quantity of something they the restaurant calls an \\"appetizer\\". Again, I give credit where credit was due, and regardless of the portion size, the calamari was very good and much different because it was grilled instead of fried.\\n\\nBy the time we were done eating our calamari, our cocktails and waters were empty. Our waitress must have walked by our table at least 3 times and did NOT ask us if we needed another drink or more water. This is when I start to get annoyed...when you don't do your job. I don't like flagging servers down for drinks, because it's not my job as a customer and find it rude to do so. Also, I hated when people did that to me as a server. \\n\\nSo now, our food comes out (still empty cocktails and no water). We both ordered the 62 burger (16$) which were superb in taste, but small compared to the average burger (Review is based off quantity and service, not quality). However, it's very difficult to eat with nothing to drink. By this time, I'm assuming our waitress is going to come back and check how we are doing and finally notice our drinks are empty but boy, was I wrong. She NEVER came back and we didn't see her throughout the course of us consuming our burgers, which was a good 15 minutes. It got to the point where we had to get up and ask the hostess for more water because our waitress literally disappeared...which is completely unacceptable in this kind of \\"up scale\\" establishment. \\n\\nTo top it all off, as I thought about the entire experience I noticed something...\\n\\nOur server ONLY brought out our cocktails and gave us the check.\\nA different server brought out our appetizer.\\nAnother server brought out our food.\\nAnd yet another server cleared out plates off the table.\\nAnd to top it off, we had to ask the hostess to bring us water because our server NEVER checked backed to see how we were doing after we received our meals.\\n\\nI ended up leaving her 10%, which was meant to be an insult to the service. I don't like stiffing servers because they need to claim around 10% of there total sales at the end of the night in taxes.\\n\\nHonestly, if it wasn't for the quality of the food, it would have been a really bad experience. Based off other reviews, I'm sure my experience was very rare...but it doesn't take away for the fact that it still happened. \\n\\nAll in all, I wouldn't come back. For the price I payed for the 5 pieces of calamari, the burgers which I could barely fit in the palm of my hand and the absolutely horrible service, I'll take my patronage to some other establishment in Salem."},{"name":"Hog Wild BBQ","address":"9226 SE 82nd Ave","city":"Happy Valley","stars":"3.5","text":"Good BBQ spot for take out\\nPulled chicken and pork is tasty\\nmac n cheese is nice\\ngood cornbread\\nbuild a sandwich is also a good choice\\nservice is proper"},{"name":"Mentei","address":"66 Hereford St","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"I was expecting too much when i went to mentai, that is why the 3 stars.  i ordered the pork ramen and it was not what i expected.  the soup was just ok and the noodles were too mushy.

I had to wait for him to return to let him know I was not done ordering. This was a mirrored copy of our previous visit to this restaurant with the same server. On the previous visit I chalk it up to the possibility that he was having a bad evening. Clearly this is his personality and or attitude normally.\\n\\nAt the conclusion of the meal my wife and I planned to take what we could not finish of our meals home, which was about 20% left of our meal, and when Christian came by our table, my wife indicated two boxes. Christian took our plates, to which we assumed he was planning to box our food up for us, however, he never returned with the boxes or the food in the boxes.\\n\\nI personally and firmly believe that a worker is worthy of their wage, I also believe in tipping accordingly. Christian's performance and attitude received an equally valued tip, which was more than 10% of the total bill. I never want to be one of those customers that does not tip at all. At this point Christian came and retrieved the signed bill and proceeded over to the bar to complete the transaction, and at this point is when Christian vocally and within eyeshot of my table says, \\" can you believe this?\\" and proceeds to hold the paper slip up to the bartender while shaking his head and points out the tip. How disrespectful to a paying customer within eye and ear shot.\\n\\nTo future customers of this location, be warned if you have Christian as your server because you fall under the possibility he will be upset with you if you do not tip according to his expected level and may not have a problem vocalizing or showing his frustration within your table area."},{"name":"Culver's - Austin","address":"2240 W Braker Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I drove by Culver's on Braker  every day on my way to work for about a year before I tried it.

I have NEVER had a frozen treat that tasted SOOOO good!  Oh, my stars!!  Had to use the spoon.  Too thick to get through a straw.  Once, I asked for a little extra blackberry in my concrete mixer.  I was told \\"Sure!\\" and not charged!  Not only that, each time I returned, extra blackberries were added without me asking or being charged, upon ordering.   Enjoyed 3 or 4 of these before I tried their food.  (I've continued to order the mixer's for 4 years)   Had the Grilled Prime Rib with Mushrooms.  It was enormous, hot and had so much flavor, I was completely blown away!  I know their sign states they are not like other fast food joints but I just thought that was typical advertising.  Not!!  Their chicken tenders,  the butter burgers, both fat and juicy.  And the staff is so friendly!  I've eaten all over the US, often in very fine establishments, and have  not encountered happier, friendlier or more helpful staff anywhere.  I haven't tried the fries because the sandwiches are so big, there is never room for them.  It's always 'either - or.'  They look great!  Light and crispy looking.  Maybe I'll just get an order of fries one day.  How to pick fries over a sandwich...Hmmm.  That's the challenge.\\n\\nThis is NOT a fast food restaurant.  This is a restaurant that serves a menu that kind of resembles a fast food joint if you don't think about the pot roast, Walleye, Prime Rib, chicken salad, chicken fried steak or any of the specials they offer on a regular basis.

We arrived at 5:30 which was early, but we were there for THREE hours.  The ambience with the gorgeous patio with great sunset views and cool breezes alone gives this review the minimum three stars it deserves and the food and cocktails push it up two more stars.\\n\\nWe happened to be there early enough to catch the happy hour deals with cocktails and select appetizers so we ended up getting like eleventy billion dishes of the fried anchovy-stuffed olives.  Oh god.  That stuff was like crack.  I don't think there was a single time during dinner that there was not at least one dish of those olives on the table.  We just kept ordering small dish after small dish and carafes of sangria and various other cocktails, it was a waitress's wet dream...or nightmare. :)  \\n\\nSo I've talked about my lady boner for the fried olives.  Let's talk about the chorizo-stuffed medjool dates with blue cheese wrapped in bacon.  Seriously, people.  Re-read the last sentence I typed.  I'll wait.  Ready?  Medjool dates.  Chorizo.  Blue cheese.  BACON!!!  Between the salty and the sweet, what is not to like in there?!  We ordered anywhere from between 3-5 plates of the stuff (they come 5 to a plate and there were 5 in our party).  I think we ordered almost everything on the tapas/small plates menus.  We also got the cheese plate, which came with olives and almonds with the addition of chorizo and jam√≥n serrano.  Now, the bf is a Spaniard (no, for real, he lived there until he was 7...no sexy Spanish accent though :( haha) and he's very picky about his jam√≥n.  He's turned his nose up at several jamones served at pretty authentic Spanish tapas places in Dallas and Chicago.  This, however, he ate and enjoyed.  \\n\\nWe also ordered the piquillo pepper stuffed with crab, which was a cold dish, but enjoyable.  One of the highlights of the night for me, aside from the aforementioned dates and olives, were the fried goat cheese balls with honey and caramelized red onion jam.  Yuuuuum.   The calamari was also good- the sauce they served it with was a tomato-based sauce that had a smokey flavor with a spicy little kick.  Pork pinchitos were excellent, as were the sweet potato chips that came with this kick-ass yogurt dipping sauce that was swirled with molasses and star anise.  On special that night were carrot fritters that came with a chimichurri and yogurt sauce and those were awesome as well.  Pretty much the only dishes I wasn't crazy about all night were the prawns escabeche (which I SWEAR had corn nuts, yes, corn nuts, like the redneck/ghetto-fab snack sold in gas stations in it) and the hummus.  The pita bread that it came with was delightfully fluffy, but I felt like something was off in the flavoring of the hummus.  Just skip it and save room for more olives and dates. :)\\n\\nDinner ended on an especially high note with dessert.  We ordered almost one of everything off of the dessert menu along with dessert drinks and it was all delicious.  I got the moscato d'asti and it was the perfect pairing to my pear galette.  Super buttery, flaky crust with perfect baked pears, mmm.  I almost didn't want to share bites of it with people around the table, but y'know, I HAD to if I wanted a bite of their desserts. Others got the goat cheese cheesecake with rosemary and I think blueberry sauce, the pound cake, and a Valrhona chocolate tart.  \\n\\nAt the end of our meal, the owner and the manager each came over to say hello and inquire about our experience.  Both super nice guys and it's always nice to see proprietors and management who have a vested interest in the experiences and opinions of their customers.

So, we came here for our anniversary dinner. \\n\\nDecor/theme - LOVE IT!! the restaurant has a diplomat/spy theme with the decor to go along with it. For examples, some walls are decorated with china  from different countries, one of the restrooms is decorated with replica firearms on the walls. The purple color upholstery at the round booth is epic!! \\n\\nService - Impeccable!!! we had a very early dinner so the waiter had  time to chit chat (a pleasant one, of course) with us during beginning of dinner service. He was very attentive - case in point: after squeezing the lime juice into my water, I place the lime wedge on my plate. Within a couple of minutes, the waiter removed it swiftly and discretely. We truly enjoy being served by you, Mr. Cat (his name on the receipt LOL). \\n\\nFood - we ordered two dishes from the rotating menu (inspired by Zambia - heck! I can't even pinpoint where it is on the map) - Piri Piri Roasted Cauliflower and Chibombo Village Red Snapper. We also ordered three dishes from the resident menu - Havana Egg Roll, Dry Sauteed Thai Okra, Yutou Box (dessert). Overall, all dishes tasted great. Some of the dishes seem simple, but with minor twitch, it tasted much better than the original version. For example, the Thai chili sauce on the okra - with addition of shallot, pepper, and rosemary.....it suddenly has a more complex flavor. Another example is the Havana Egg Roll...essentially a Cuban sandwich in the form of egg roll skin.  Omitting the bun makes it less stuffing and the egg roll skin gives it a nice chewiness.\\n\\nThe dish we love the most is the Yutou Box - chewy Taro brownie topped with taro sorbet - all made n-house. The dessert is not overly sweet (a delight to my palate), but the taro is just so aromatic. The texture of the \\"brownie\\" is more like a Âπ¥Á≥ï (Chinese rice cake) or a firm mochi....it's easily one of the top 3 dessert I've tasted in Atlanta.\\n\\nWe will absolutely come back again, and again, and again.

It wasn't actually my first choice, but due to some last minute reservation making my choices were limited.

Their website had a variety of food options that I thought would satisfy my vegetarian friends and me.\\n\\nWhen we got there we sat outside because the space out there would accommodate my group better.  We were happy to be outside since they had the shades down to block the sun and there was a slight breeze.  The inside seemed a little cramped, too, so we had more room where we were.  The staff was super friendly, they had unique drinks (gazpacho martini), and tasty food options (I hear some of the best quail in the states).  Everything we ate was good and we were even blessed with a beautiful sunset I'm sure the people inside missed.  The outside waiting area is great and comfortable, too.\\n\\nAt the end of the meal, the server had no problem splitting the bill.  We offered to pay the easy way, but he said it was no problem just listing what everyone ordered.  (I was a server for a few years and insisted on doing it the way I thought was the easy way with a large group of people- everyone writing the amount they were going to pay instead of itemizing.)  To end the meal perfectly, they threw in a free dessert of my choice.\\n\\nI'm giving it a four out of five because some of the food dishes weren't perfect.  My friend ordered the lamb and pork kebabs and got some fatty pieces and some other portions were a bit small.  It was almost perfect, though.

Our waitress was lovely! I don't recall her name but she had an Irish accent... She was friendly and knowledgable about the menu. In order to assure speedy delivery, she suggested we order dessert in advance because their chocolate lava cake takes thirty minutes to cook. Once we finished our meals it was perfectly ready and tasted incredible.\\nI ordered oysters on the half shell which weren't the best I've had but still yummy. It was the lobster bisque that really stole my heart! Creamy and delicious with just the right hint of spice! The lobster was plentiful and I was in bisque heaven! My boyfriend and my brother both ordered the teriyaki steak which I sampled (of course) and it was delicious as well. Perfectly cooked and had a lovely accompaniment of coconut onion ring and pineapple sliced beneath potato fingerlings."},{"name":"Tawakal Halal Cuisine","address":"1004 Bennington St, 2nd Fl","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Review of Tawakal in form of 4-movement symphony:\\n\\nMovement 1: Exposition\\n\\nI lucked out and came here at a time when there were no other customers. The owners were just finishing up breakfast and we had their undivided attention. It was like being invited into a warm Somali kitchen for a one-of-a-kind meal. The food is not only exotic, authentic and delicious (my favorite kind), it's cheap as hell. \\n\\nMovement 2: Appetizer\\n\\nFor less than $3, you can (and should) get the Mixed Platter appetizer featuring an assortment of nafakha, patata, bajiya, and a sambusa of your choice. We went with fish and it converted my I-don't-like-samosas boyfriend into where-have-these-been-all-my-life? Of course, sambusas are not the same thing as samosas, but, as with many Somali dishes, the Indian influence is very clear.\\n\\nMovement 3: Entrees\\n\\nPart A: The boy got the Chicken Biryani with basmati rice, chicken, fresh vegetables, raisins and spices garnished with fresh coriander. Indian influence? Yes. Indian? Definitely not! For one thing, as Yahya (pronounced yah-hi-yah), one of the owners, explained, the rice is cooked differently. For another, the chicken is a lot less curry-sauced and a lot more pepper-seasoned. But the range of spices clearly present certainly rivaled any traditional Indian chicken biryani.\\n\\nPart B: I had the Tawakal Plate--strips of chapati bread sauteed with peppers, onions and steak tips. I can't begin to describe how delicious this plate of food was. First off, like the biryani, it was enormous and I had to take half of it home. Second, the only thing I can think of that remotely resembles this dish is the moo shu pancake dish at Mulan (which you should certainly try if you never have). The chapati strips, soaked in the delicious sauce of beef, peppers and onions, came out both crisp and tender. The steak tips were chewy yet soft. The dish was filling without feeling the slightest bit greasy or heavy.\\n\\nMovement 4: Service and Decor\\n\\nTawakal's owners, Yahya and his cousin Abdi, deserve a movement all their own. They are possibly the nicest restaurateurs I have ever met. Not only are they attentive, warm and friendly, but their passion for their homeland and their homeland's food is clear to anyone who speaks to them for more than 10 seconds. Oh, and they are incredibly easy on the eyes. ;) The decor is very bare bones without being dirty or sketchy. It invites a laid-back, casual vibe that few could disagree with. And there's a gorgeous corner of the restaurant that's suitable for large groups. It's covered with beautiful blankets, cushions and other paraphernalia, and groups can choose to dine there sitting on the floor for a truly authentic Somali experience.\\n\\nCoda: The.Tea.\\n\\nThe complimentary tea is a tea of magnificent, epic proportions. It is a black tea spiced with cardamon, cinnamon and cloves. It tastes sweet, slightly tart (from the clove) and soothing. It comes out piping hot and you can have as much of it as you want. Yahya explained that it was an original creation of his and now I'm kind of inspired to create teas of my own! He even offered us some extra tea for the road. If you dine here and leave without trying this tea, consider your experience a failure until you've had it. It's that good."},{"name":"Avalon Diner","address":"16106 Marsh Rd","city":"Winter Garden","stars":"4","text":"Tried this place on a recent vacation to FL.

Yeah, you probably could have gone without knowing that. En-Eee-Ways.....\\n\\nPeople were yelling. There were, like, three menu items - which is good when your decision-making ability is impaired. I ordered the cheeseburger with red, no pickles or onions, fries and a Diet Coke. The much touted fries (\\"The only fresh hand cut crinkle fries in Texas\\") are not good. They are like greasy potato Ric Rac. The meat is delicious and hand formed by some dude who stands in a window forming meat patties all day. (Seriously, is that all he does?

This is the 3rd Brazilian restaurant I've tried (Texas de Brazil in Fairfax, VA ~$50pp and Folia in Marietta ~$30pp).  Red and Green is in between.  Folia's salad bar was useless and decor was plain - and from what I recall the meat selection was unimpressive.  It was also completely empty on a friday night.  Here, decor is closer to the upscale steakhouses and the soup/salad bar is pretty good.  \\n\\nPROS: \\n-The main thing I love is being able to get RARE or whatever temperature you like (only a few beef cuts were served slightly above my preference like the filet and most of the kababs/cube cuts).  \\n-Service is great.  The meat service was pretty constant the entire time, and the bread was brought out fresh from the oven about every 20 min.  Whenever we requested something it didn't take more than 10-15 min to come out.\\n-Cream of Mushroom soup is very good.  I think it has portobella and shitake.  I had 3 bowls on my first visit here.  \\n-fresh cheese bread (imo better than having them sitting around). \\n\\nCONS:\\n-Charging full price for kids over 10 is ridiculous.\\n-Salad bar could use a few more items like cheeses, artichoke hearts and hearts of palm. \\n-The lamb (both times) was not quite what I expected.  They are kebab like cubes and a little chewy.  The flavor is good but the mint marinade described on the menu is barely detectable.\\n-Sauce selection.  I'd like a mint sauce for the lamb and horseradish to complement some of the beef.\\n-The dinner price $35 is too high and therefore this place is never packed.  We went during late dinner hours each time and there were only between 6-10 groups sitting out of maybe 25-30 tables in the whole restaurant.  If lowered to $25 I think they'd stay busy and there'd be no worries about old reheated food as noted in some of the other reviews."},{"name":"Potbelly Sandwich Shop","address":"10515 N Mopac Expy, Ste 300","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I really enjoy this place.

Located in Grandview, Sweet Carrot transformed the once loved Rife's Market into a cozy spot to grab a quick bite to eat.\\n\\nI see some reviews rating this experience as if it was a traditional sit-down restaurant experience. I personally do not believe that is fair, so I would advise going elsewhere if you're looking to be catered to for 1+ hour(s) like a normal restaurant. If anything, this style (they call it Fresh Casual) would fall somewhere in between Chipotle and Northstar.\\n\\nTHE FOOD\\nAfter browsing the menu before entering the line, you order your food from a cashier who hands you a table number to be served once everything is ready. The typical experience is to pick a main specialty (Pulled Pork/Brisket/Chicken Meatballs/Brussel sprout) on top of a base (Cornbread/Sandwich/Salad):\\n- I ordered the Pulled Pork on top of the Cornbread. The cornbread base is essentially if cornbread and a pancake had a baby = corncake. It also included a corn salsa and drizzled sauce to pile on the corncake and pork\\n- For sides I also got the chicken meatballs (teriyaki/soy-ginger) and deep fried macncheese balls for my daughter\\n- Lastly, we got the carrot cake pop to finish everything off\\n\\nVERDICT\\nWith all things considered, for how quickly the food came out and the cozy atmosphere of the place, I could see myself coming back to try more food combinations. The food is comforting (while not overly filling) and is tasty for the short turnaround time to serve it. My reasoning for the 4-stars is that none of the food was overly memorable and would not have me craving it until the next time I came back. \\n\\nPARTING WORDS\\nGreat addition to the Columbus food scene and love the concept to push 'fresh' fast casual food!

Alas, I cannot give more than three due to a lackluster experience. I came for lunch this week and was extremely excited to carve through the menu with a buddy of mine. We ordered the charcuterie board, the boudin noir, knock wurst, spiced squash soup and the ham, gruyere and braised bacon sandwich. The only reason I got the ham and gruyere sandwich was because I had to send back my knock wurst after it arrived completely raw. Not undercooked. but RAW. uncooked swine is no joke and I wasn't about to put my bowels in jeopardy in order to just let that one slide. I work in service as cook so I have some major trepidation about sending food back. found a hair? eh, no biggie. shit happens. burger was under-seasoned? thats cool, theres salt on the table. got an oinking knock wurst? SEND THAT SHIT BACK! I didn't freak out though. stuff like that happens all the time in even the swankiest of restaurants. Must have a been a new cook working the nice n easy lunch shift to get their bearings. I bet they won't do that again. and luckily for them, I wasn't some entitled prick who decided to make a scene and demand a refund or some B.S. like that. So, aside from that whole sausage fiasco, the food was really tasty. they used quality ingredients and some care was put into the writing of that menu... for the most part. That ham sandwich- yeah, it was good, but if I had those ingredients I could have EASILY made that at home for next to nothing. Personally, I - along with many other folks, I assume -come to places like this to get inspiration and see what chefs can do with their ingredients that makes one say \\" how the hell did you make three ingredients blow my mind?!\\"  Finesse and subtlety are things I look for and I they just failed to hit it on the level I hoped for.

I changed the noodles to rice noodles instead of the regular noodles that goes with it.  When i tasted the broth, it was so flavorful. Very tasty, but misses the distinct bun bo hue flavor.

I decided to try this place after avoiding it from what I hear from my sources, contrary to the large number reviews on Yelp. My reservations I fear were founded.\\n\\nXinh Xinh seems caught in the middle without a specialty, at least in terms of the pho I had. The pricing was higher than Dong Khanh while not being better in quality, and definitely lower quality than its competitors within a block. The first telling sign was when I received the plate of Thai basil, lime, and bean sprouts. The bean sprouts did not have the bitter end-roots removed/cut and it looks like they threw bean sprouts on a plate, ran it under water, and then presented it (the bottom of the plate was a complete puddle of water). The green residuals you'd find in a bag of bean sprouts that should be sorted away was there in its full glory. The bean sprouts should be washed, drained, cut, then put on the plate. I ordered a regular-sized bowl and the quantity of contents (cuts) seemed much less than any of the competitors. It was however, filled to the brim with broth... which can be a bad thing because there was not really room to put down any of the fixings. The noodles I had, I suspect was kept out in the strainer too long, because it stuck together like a brick. When I tried to part it, I got splashed by the overfilled bowl. At least I wasn't wearing a tie today... On the bright side, they put a plate beneath the bowl so my lap wasn't also a mess, but that could have been avoided in the first place. They need larger bowls or less broth. The broth seemed to lack flavor, there not being enough aromatics within. Some of the cilantro was thrown in unchopped, a full uncut piece in my bowl. There was two pieces of each cut, but none that seemed particularly well-done. The brisket was very... gummy at the edges, a bit overcooked. The eye rounds and flank were buried, so it was shriveled by the time I got to it. The tripe and tendon were in minute pieces, like a part of the broth more than a cut.\\n\\nThe service was the bright spot. They were quick, checked in, and got me the bill quickly when gestured for. I gave them the tip they deserved.\\n\\nIt is also very telling when the fortune cookie I got after the meal read, \\"Discontent is the first necessity of progress.\\" I hope they will improve their food, or they will be stuck in the middle like K-Mart.

She was very nice.  We ordered quickly and our food was brought out quickly.\\n\\nI ordered the smoked turkey plate with mac and cheese and baked beans.  The turkey wasn't dry, but it wasn't as moist as I would have liked, and it didn't have as much smoke flavor as I would have expected.  The mac and cheese was just okay, but I am a little of a snob when it comes to mac and cheese.  The noodles were a little overcooked.

Woah. Quite generous today. ;) \\n\\nCame here to try the uni soba. Ate everything but uni soba. Sometimes things don't go as plan.\\n\\nFor appetizer, I recommend the scallop hokkaiyaki. The baked scallop is served over a small fire and continues to cook at the table. This is a very creamy dish. \\n\\nWe also tried the hamachi Kama which is grilled yellowtail collar served with ponzu sauce. I wished they served this with grated daikon as do other places. This is my one complaint about this dish. \\n\\nThen there was the spicy salmon wrapped in cucumber. Taste as should. \\n\\nWe also had the baby hamachi jalape√±o. This was thin slices of yellow tail served with a kick and a punch to the tongue thanks the to spicy sauce and the thin slices of jalape√±o topping each piece. \\n\\nThe amaebi (sweet shrimp) nigiri is so sweet and so fresh. This is not to be confused with the less adventurous cooked shrimp (ebi). If you fear shrimp head, not sure why anyone would be, the shrimp head does come fried in batter. \\n\\nFrom the yakitori menu we tried several items during our first visit. We tried the negima (chicken thigh meat and scallion) where the chicken was juicy. The Tsukune (chicken meatball) comes with quail egg on the side. It was also juicy. The ika yaki is a whole grilled squid. Taste as should. I only wished that served it with grated ginger and sirracha. \\n\\nThe Hokkaido don was too pretty to eat. But we ate it of course. The sea urchin, salmon roe and scallop was so fresh. My only complaint is that the snow crab were slightly salty. Other than that, this dish was absolutely tasty. \\n\\nI honestly think this is one of the best restaurants I have had in a long while. Can't wait to go back and try more of their sushi.

For the fast casual concept, great value (price vs quality). \\nFirst, a gripe. For all you yelpers out there, understand that \\"FRESH\\" does not necessarily equal \\"HEALTHY.\\" The food I had there was definitely fresh, but probably not healthy. \\n\\nFood: Delicious! I ordered corn chowder w. almond crusted chicken skewers and a soda. The corn chowder came out quick and had one of those croissants on the side. I was little surprised by the dab of honey on the side (got all over my fingers...curses!) but delighted at the taste. The almond chicken skewers came on a foot long, rectangular dish with 2 decided UNHEALTHY sauces, a mandarin salad in the middle, and mashed yams + cinnamon and walnuts. The chicken skewers were tender, well battered, and tasty. I tried both the sauces but they were just ok. Standard really. The salad is solid and the mashed yams were pretty good. Soda from a fountain. \\n\\nPrice: $14 for all that food. Again, solid. After reading all of the postings here on Yelp I took a closer look at the price. I swear some of you are on crack. Have you ever been to a fast casual restaurant before? Have you ever ordered a salad? Most of the menu items were like 6.78 or something like that. Yes, it's probably a $10 salad if you start adding stuff to it, but please explain to me how that's any different than Wolfgang Pucks, CPK, or any other fast cas. concept restaurant? Urrr! Angry!\\n\\nService: As noted before, friendly and quick. I was greeted at the door and handed a menu. He explained the \\"order at counter, we bring to you\\" concept. He came by a couple of times and offered to refill my soda (dude, it's a soda fountain, I think I go it). \\n\\nAmbiance: Good. Clean, chic. I liked the big pictures of menu items on the wall and the pasta/oil jars. Outdoor patio seating is sweet, but Atlanta in the summer is too hot for me to enjoy sitting outside.\\n\\nWould I come back? Yes. I recommend you give it a try.

We had a rezzo for 6:30 and the table was ready and waiting for us when I arrived early and awaited my entourage. They arrived shortly after and we grazed the menu and ordered drinks. \\n\\nWe didn't get to place our dinner orders until 7, and my tummy was rumbling at this point. I was a little anxious to get in and out of this place since we had a  concert to go to in Stanley Park, so maybe if this was a place where they leisurely serve you, it probably wasn't a good pick on our part, so one person in our party let the staff know that we were in a bit of a hurry. We ended up getting our dinner at 7:30 and wolfing it down so we could get out of there just before 8. \\n\\nI'm sure this restaurant is great for meat eaters, or pescatarians, but for vegetarians it kinda sucked. There were not a ton of dishes on the menu that were for herbivores, but one of my friends said that they serve a bunch of stuff they have at other sushi restaurants, its just not on the menu.... uh... ok? So I should just risk ordering things and hope they don't cost as much as the $5 veggie roll that I got. $5 for a VEGGIE ROLL?? Are you kidding me?? Ok, fine, maybe it will be a really big veggie roll? I'll risk ordering a yam roll as well, even though its not on the menu. Yea and the yam roll with asparagus was $5.50. Ummm...no. I ended up ordering the deep fried eggplant as well, with no breading since the breading has fish flakes on it, which was almost $5 too, and I ended up paying $16.80 after tax for  two average rolls and some eggplant. Sushi restaurants are a dime a dozen in Vancouver and I know that I should not have to pay that much for vegetables, rice and seaweed, that is ridiculous. \\n\\nI think the icing on the cake for me was when I put my $20 bucks down for my bill and I was not even offered or given change. Sure I am going to tip 15% (which technically is only $19.32) but don't just assume that. Maybe it was just pouring salt on my already wounded wallet, but by the end of the excursion I was pretty unsatisfied, and still hungry.

Maybe its different for lunch and dinner but for breakfast forget about it, terrible! It all started with you having to order your own food on a computer which is difficult when you want to ask questions about the food. Once we order we were told to just find our own seating, sit anywhere we'd like. We sat in the middle of the ballroom which is pretty much the only good thing because its a pretty room. We had to get our own drinks, napkins and silverware and we had to wait 10 minutes for someone to explain how the heck we get the food and how everything works. Once we got the food I was HIGHLY disappointed. I got the eggs with bacon on bread thing and no where on the menu did it say it came with a mountain of spinach or arugula (I really dont know, a mountain of leaves) and tomatoes and the cheese was disgusting. Once i took all the stuff i didnt want off it was alright but definetely not worth $24. My friend order the kids french toast because she didnt like anything on the menu and had to pay $14 for 6 miniature sticks of prench toast.

The menu reads like the best BBQ + Southern + American combo in a \\"create your own\\" sort of fashion.  Let me tell you, it did not disappoint.  It's located right in the Grandview Heights area of Columbus and fits with the modern, hipster, innovative feel of the area.  Right when you walk in to Sweet Carrot, you get a clean, bright and welcoming feel with a combo of larger tables, seats at the bar, and taller two tops.  \\n\\nOne thing I did not like about Sweet Carrot was that you order at the counter then take a number. I just tend to prefer table service because it's easier to fix mistakes, opposed to having to wait in line to take care of one.  I wanted to try the pulled pork on a corn cake but the cashier must have heard \\"loaded corn cake\\" because not only did I get my pork on coleslaw on a corn cake, but there was a layer of Mac n Cheese in there too.  No wonder my meal was more expensive than I thought. The Mac was a nice element and I enjoyed it, overall though it was just a little too rich for me.  But the pork was tender, the BBQ sauce was flavorful and the Mac was rich and creamy and salty.  The corn cake was just fluffy and savory enough and made a great bed for this decadent stack.  Perfect.  Only complaint was the slaw was too sweet.\\n\\nThe other options on the menu looked great too.  The fried artichokes sounded and looked like a delicious meat free option and I was also very intrigued by the kale salad option.  This concept is definitely unique and needed in today's food scene.  My biggest complaint of all is that Sweet Carrot requires me to make a 90 minute drive up to Columbus from Cinicnnati.

Nothing was good about this place.  I work a couple of blocks away and came here with some coworkers for lunch.  Let me list all of the reasons I will never return:\\n\\n1. Food - this is the most important thing (obviously).  I ordered the spicy sausage with collard greens, fries and a piece of cornbread.  Why these sides?  Because this supposed BBQ place does not serve mashed potatoes or mac and cheese. WHAT?  \\n\\n- Spicy sausage - the only edible thing on the plate.  I took it out of the too-hard roll.\\n- Collard greens - ew.  Barely warm and too mushy.  I had 1 bite.\\n- Fries - tasteless.  How do you mess up fries?  They had no salt.  My coworker next to me bathed her fries in ketchup.  I ate 3.\\n- Cornbread - hard and dry.  Why is the cornbread at Boston Market better than the cornbread here?  I took 2 bites.\\n- Drink - diet coke... with no bubbles.  The waitress said it was just their gun.  So why are you serving people sodas when you know it has no bubbles?  I had her take it back and had water.\\n\\n2. Cleanliness - I opened up my napkin wrap to find a long brown hair.  Since I was with coworkers (and my boss), I didn't make a big deal out of it and just asked for another wrap (about 10 minutes later when the waitress appeared).\\n\\n3. Service - besides the waitress serving uncarbonated sodas and taking a while to check on us, the thing that annoyed me the most is that she expected us to clear the table for her.  We were seated in a semi-circular booth and my boss was signing the check.  The waitress wordlessly held out her arm for us to give her our plates.  She didn't ask and she didn't wait the 3 minutes for us to leave so that she could clear the table.  I had 3 plates - food plate, bread plate that was already there and my cornbread plate.  She literally held out her hand for each one.  Why?  Just wait until we leave.  Or ask or something.  That was just so strange to me.  I don't want to clear the table for you.  Also, please note that this was a late lunch and there were literally 4 other customers (2 couples).  Its not like there were people waiting for our table and she had to rush.\\n\\nAnyway - due to the terrible food and annoying service - I have no desire to ever step foot in this place again.

He has been raving about it since. With so many great restaurants to try in PDX, this was never one of our top choices. But my husband really wanted to back to Clyde Common, so when we found ourselves downtown on a Friday night and hungry for food, we ended up here. We arrived around 7:30PM and were told it would be a 30 minute wait. Fine, we weren't too hungry. We were finally seated around 8:05PM. What I noticed though was that even though there were ample empty seats and we were only a party of two, the host chose not to fill them in. Perhaps the European style seating was too close to comfort for some. Anyway, our server came to our table immediately and offered us ice cold waters. We quickly ordered since we had been sitting for 40 minutes at the bar and already made our decision. We shared the fideos, roasted game hen, and a green salad. After we ordered our food and drinks, we never saw our server again. My husband ordered a glass of red wine and did not receive it when the food came, so he asked one of the staff members for it. Guess what? We were consequently charged for two glasses of red wine! Anyway, they nicely took it off our bill. In terms of food quality, has the chef heard of any other spice besides SALT? Seriously, everything we ordered was overly salted. The fideo wasn't too bad, as long as you didn't eat the salty Italian sausage. The hen was nicely cooked, but the saltiness ruined it. The only way that bird could be eaten was if you skinned it and avoided the accompanying sauce at all cost. Even the salad had too much salt. I am usually the pickier eater of the two of us, but even my husband couldn't believe how salty it was. I thought perhaps we needed some bread to get rid of the saltiness, but guess what?

The location is very convenient.  I get one of two things...either 2 slices of cheese or a buffalo and bleu cheese sub. I have never once sat in the restaurant to eat my food for one good reason, the place is gross. It's not even remotely clean! I sometimes sit and wait for my order and the table, seat and walls are disgusting. My arms sometimes actually stick to the table if I use my smartphone to pass time.\\nSo, today it's a 2 slices day. I ask for the slices \\"to go\\" from a woman who often gets my order wrong ( I ask for onions, lettuce and no tomatoes on the sub and she gives me just onions, or just tomato, or sometimes just lettuce...She often walks away from me, and others WHILE we are ordering! No wonder she gets it wrong...she also tried to give me ranch dressing for my buffalo and bleu cheese instead of bleu cheese))   and I sit and wait. I see the pizza cook put my box on the counter and he calls me up. I go up and I see her take the box off the counter and tell the pizza cook that I'm eating it in. I said, \\"No, that's to go\\" and she spins around and asks, with attitude \\" did you change your mind? You didn't say to go\\". I said \\"I certainly did say \\"to go\\", you just didn't listen to me (big surprise) and then she INSISTED that I told her it was for dine in...like I lied or something. We went back and forth about this twice...she just couldn't hand me the stupid box and let me be on my way. She was insistent that I was lying for some unknown reason. To sum up my experience. The food is \\"OK\\" not great, and the service is pathetic! The place could use a THOROUGH cleaning. It has never had one. And the one young lady needs to listen to her customers much more carefully. She acts as if she couldn't be bothered sometimes. It's also funny that the pizza cook heard me loud and clear and presented my food the way I asked for it!

Before I begin my review, I would like to talk about the restaurant and serving utensils. Decor is pretty typical with indian portraits and life themes on the wall. Utensils are disposable plastic and serving dishes are styrofoam. This is a first for me as I have never seen this before, but then again the prices of most dishes were $2-7 per dish.  I guess it pays to keep the cost down. Now on to the star of the show...Biryani.  Biryani is a dish with it's origins in Hyderabad. There are literally 10s to 100s of this dish. The chicken is usually marinated in yogurt and spices, cooked and mixed with rice and topped with fried crunchy onions. This particular biryani did not have fried crunchy onions, the dish was not spicy (rather lacked spice) and portion size was slightly small. Lastly, Naan has always been free when ordering a meal. I can only assume that to offset the low meal prices, this is why naan cost $1.49 for one slice. The naan was very mediocre at best during this visit.

Upon studying their online menu, it is a no-brainer to order \\"The Reggie\\" - it's a fried chicken sandwich on a biscuit, with bacon, cheddar cheese and country gravy. I went all the way and ordered the Deluxe, with a fried egg. This, after having a fabulous Mac'n'Cheese (made with orzo, marscapone cheese, lobster meat with truffles, at \\"The Original\\" the night before), is like a heart attack waiting to happen, but I just had to have it. \\n\\nI wanted to also sample their fried green tomatoes. Yep. Kill me now.  The place is tiny, and by the time I got there, it was close to lunch time and their seating is extremely limited and you see many people eating on the sidewalk.\\n\\nFolks, this is the BEST all around chicken sandwich I've ever had. The fried chicken patty is of course butter milk marinaded, with good amount of spices (to many people it maybe on a bit salty side, but for me, it was perfect as I am a salt hound.), biscuit was fluffy as seen on TV (as they make the biscuit dough, they knead in shaved frozen butter so as that melts, adds flakiness to it) It is not a sandwich you can pick and eat, because of the generous amount of gravy and also the flakiness of the biscuit, so it requires a fork and a knife. \\n\\nAs I type this five hours after consuming it, it is still happily sitting in my gut and needless to say, I am one happy customer. All hail Portland!"},{"name":"DD Mau","address":"1239 Pacific Boulvard","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"So unbelievably yummy! I haven't eaten there but both times I've been I've gotten sandwiches to go. The first time was the crispy pork bahn mi. Unfortunately, I waited too long to bite into it so it wasn't so crispy anymore. Was still yummy though. The spring rolls- amazing! That I dived into as I was driving right away... \\nThe second time I got their classic sandwich. I asked for extra jalapenos and only got a normal amount... but still delicious. I actually saved it because I was so full and didn't bite into it until I got back to NY. A little risky I know... But I had faith... Glad I did because it was so delicious.

I bop my head along and I wait for my Lamb Schwarma sandwich with patience. \\nWhen it arrives via the super nice and constantly smiling dude, it looks amazing. I almost need a minute to appreciate just HOW good it looks before I can bite it. And I do.  And they flavors hit me. Hard. This amazing and beautiful combination of spicy juicy pipping hot lamb meat, drenched in THE BEST Tzatziki sauce that you are gonna find, and fresh tomatoes and lettuce wrapped in warm garlicy pita. \\nOh my GOD. Is this love? \\n\\nYES. Yes it is.\\nAnd it came with a really yummy salad of mixed greens and amazingly awesome killer hummus. AMAZING. We got an extra plate of Tzatziki and pita. I couldn't decide which was better; The Hummus or The Tzatziki. Seriously it's a toss up, because they are both SO DAMN GOOD.\\n\\nSo in the end. I love this place. I love almost everything about it. The only thing I don't love about this place, is that I'm not there more often. I've died and gone to food heaven. And I will be back. Especially for my birthday.

In every appetizer and entr√©e, you can readily identify those elements and appreciate how they play together.\\n\\nI had the recommended sea bass (savory) on a bed of sweet potato pur√©e (sweet) and bok choy (salty).  As a huge fan of sake- and miso-infused fish, I really enjoyed bass' firm texture and subtle waves of flavor.  33 Restaurant & Lounge had a sake cod dish that was very similar but lacked the same flavor boosting sides.  My date, however, seemed to agree with others who have reviewed the bass, saying it was bland compared to other fish steaks she's had.\\n\\nOf the four appetizers we had that night, the coconut shrimp (savory) with its semi-salty batter (salty, obviously) and pineapple pur√©e salsa (sweet) was easily my favorite.  The dish was very simple, but the sauce behind the batter was a slight, yet noticeable complement.\\n\\nMy least favorite of the appetizers was the saut√©ed Shitake mushrooms.  The sweetness of the sauce, coupled with the natural pungency of Shitake, were too overpowering for me, my date and the tiny quail egg on the dish whose flavor was completely lost.\\n\\nI'd definitely come back and would recommend this place to others.  The drinks, progenies of a woman named Noon, are amazing.  They don't have a very large beer list, which is disappointing considering their neighbor is American Craft, but I'd definitely stop here for the specials.

Via Napoli had only a five-minute wait.  We were seated and served in the spacious dining room by a friendly Italian waiter.  Though the restaurant was quickly filling up, Leonardo patiently answered our questions.  \\n\\nWe started our meal with a family salad of fresh mixed greens scattered with Greek olives, marinated mushrooms and little red peppers that were both sweet and spicy, all tossed in a light vinaigrette.  The children got individual pizza margheritas; the adults shared a 20-inch pizza, half Italian sausage and half carciofi (artichoke.)  I asked for the addition of prosciutto for extra protein.  This was the best pizza I've ever eaten, with a thin, chewy, yeasty crust, fresh mozzarella, and  wide ribbons of delectable prosciutto.  I had thought this would just be a snack, but it was filling enough to be dinner. \\n \\nThe meal was more expensive than I had expected; instead of $7 a bowl, the family salad was $7 per person.  The total cost averaged out to $2O per person.  That may be a lot for salad and pizza, but it was a bargain compared with other Disney restaurants.  Crystal Palace was $52 per person, and the food was not as high quality.  (I guess you pay more for the photo ops with Winnie the Pooh.)\\n\\nA word of warning to my fellow Americans.  Via Napoli serves authentic Italian style pizza, which means most of the choices are \\"white,\\" with cheese but no tomato sauce.  Toppings are applied lightly, and there are no pizzas here piled with meat, unless you pay extra.\\n\\nBut as I said, this light fare was very filling.  We came hungry and cranky, and we left very happy.\\n\\nOne more thing is worth a mention.  I didn't notice that there was an automatic gratuity, so I added a generous tip.

The yucca fries were sliced too large and were tough, and the \\"tumbleweed\\" fries did not taste fresh.\\n\\nI ordered the vegetable stir-fry from the daily specials menu. My stir-fry plate must have been sitting around for twenty minutes, as most of the food was room-temperature.  There were a few \\"hot-spots\\" in the rice, making me think it had been microwaved.  Instead of sending it back to be re-warmed and further delaying our party, I just gave up after eating about a quarter of the entr√©e.  \\n\\nAs for the other meals, you'll find a Yelp review of Nicole H's pesto dish.  A friend ordered the chili, which seemed to mostly consist of a bowl of tomato sauce.  \\n\\nWhen he came to pick up our dishes, the waiter asked how everything came out.  We groaned and replied that it was not good.  Looking at my un-eaten plate, the waiter asked if I wanted a to-go box.  I replied, \\"definitely not,\\" and he grabbed my dish and walked away.  Perhaps he was as done dealing with us as we were with Citizen.  \\n\\nIdeally, I would speak to the manager, but we had been there for an hour and a half, and it sure didn't seem like my complaint would make a difference.

Seven friends (some old some new) and I met here last night for what turned out to be a taste delight for me.\\n\\nFirst of all, it's been awhile since my cocktail tab trumped my meal's, but such was the case last night.   You really owe it to yourself to try a few of their cocktails.  \\n\\nThe first I tried was the GINGER APRICOT DAQUIRI flor de cana 4 yr, canton ginger, orchard apricot & lime.  It was very good and very refreshing.  I shared a sip with a few around me and they all agreed it was great.  \\n\\nThe next I tried was a friend's drink whose name will no doubt cause many to twitch CEDAR FEVER  It was very tasty.  What's in it you ask?  Well we'd like to ask you - hayman's old tom gin, zirbenz stone pine, st. germaine elderflower & peychaud's bitters.  Clear as mud, right?  \\n\\nThen I went for the RIO 16 cabana cachaca, pomegranate, lime, earl grey & orange bitters.  I remember loving it and I don't think I shared it.  I think I just sucked that one down.  \\n\\nThe last drink makes something things about last night a blur...\\n\\nSo what was the last drink of the night?  I had the MATA HARI which was an Absinthe drink.  You will want to order this if you have even the slightest bit of show off in you.  The presentation is awesome.  They bring out a big container of ice water that they turn on to drip slowly on the sugar cube and you can control have much or little water you want.   Mmmmm, it was good.  I never had Absinthe before so that was a treat for me.\\n\\nSoooooo, that was the drinking.  Now the food. \\n\\nBriaised Lamb Shank with Romesco:  Fideos Parmesano, Scallions & Garlic Aioli.  Fall.  Off.  The.   Bone.  It was delicious.  I think based on what I saw, that it was the best choice on the menu.  I tried the steak and it was definitely tasty too, but if you are a lover of lamb(if you read my Olivia review you'll know I love ALL parts of lamb) this is a solid choice.\\n\\nIt was the opinion of those at my end of the table that we will be returning here for certain.

I've been visiting Chez Nous for years, and you know what?\\n\\nThis is French bistro dining at its best. Every time I come back, it's like I'm back in Paris.\\n\\nThere has never been a single dish that was unsatisfactory. Not a single one: appetizer, soup, salad, entree, prix fixe menu...ALL were spectacular, and cooked perfectly.\\n\\nIf you have never tried sweetbreads, try them here. They are, quite literally, mind-blowing. One of the best flavors this side of foie gras.\\n\\nA current offering, the Wagyu flank steak, was delicious. I usually go with the ribeye when I get steak here, but their meat purveyor is top-notch, and this was the real deal (I was, of course, skeptical of any claim of true Wagyu beef).\\n\\nThe duck confit melts off the bone, and the sauce is divine.\\n\\nI noticed a switch from escargot to mussels, and it was noted by the staff that the usual escargot provider ran out, and the owner \\"couldn't find any that he approved of yet.\\" A true food artisan knows when supply is not good enough for his craft, and I very much appreciated this straightforward reply. The mussels, by the way, were perfect -- tender and garlicky.\\n\\nThe bread has been panned (ha, see what I did there?) by others as \\"not authentic,\\" but I believe that the bread, served room temperature, is exactly how the French serve it. The butter is creamy, delicate, and NOT the standard Land-o-lakes oversalted crap you find in the grocery store.\\n\\nSoups are always beautifully prepared and very obviously blended by hand with care in a blender (which is a painstaking process, but produces the best textures). The one I just recently had, cream of mushroom, was earthy and almost pillowy in texture -- marvelous!\\n\\nI hesitate to talk about it (because it might sell out even faster), but...the duck liver mousse is one of the best pates I've ever had in my entire life. This usually sells out by Wednesday or Thursday night, so make sure you go for lunch to get it, or dinner Saturday or Sunday.\\n\\nDesserts are always fantastic, and because I eat so much food I usually end up going with something light, like the chocolate mousse...although I'd hardly consider it \\"light\\" by usual standards. It's such a perfect chocolate flavor that I can only eat several spoonfuls before I have to throw in the towel and waddle back to the car.\\n\\nI find it difficult to believe that the dollar rating here is $$$, because it's more like $$ depending on what you order (the prix fixe is VERY, VERY reasonable). I've seen \\"more upscale\\" (but not necessarily *better*) French places that are way beyond $$$$, but don't have the charm or family-feel that Chez Nous does.\\n\\nOne of the best restaurants *ever*.

I had high expectations having seen the cool build-out of the space and it's inviting curb appeal. Unfortunately, we left disappointed in the overall experience. Specifically, the barbecue fell short - the ribs, in particular. As a BBQ aficionado, I perfectly understand the qualities that make for good, competition-grade, ribs and Smokebelly fails in that regard. My GUESS is that they par-boil the ribs prior to smoking which results in an over-cooked product that is mushy and falls off the bone. While some may like that approach, it is not considered to be desirable by true connoisseurs. Good ribs will have a \\"tug\\" when taking a bite. Furthermore, the ribs lacked sufficient smoke flavor for my liking suggesting, again, that the cooking process involved boiling at the expense of smoking. I will say that the sides were pretty good and the complimentary pork rinds on the table were a nice touch. Importantly, the service was also good as our waitress was attentive and nice. It should also be noted that, come fall, Smokebelly would be a fine place to watch football games as they have outfitted all walls with an impressive array of HD TVs.

I also find the prices to be pretty reasonable, Reflecting the ingredients to be higher quality than what you normally expect for takeout quick Chinese place but not so high that it falls into the gourmet or luxury or extremely authentic camp. And finally this is an awesome place to end the night after you've been out. Truthfully I've been here a few times after having a night out on the town and it is a great way to cap a night of drinking. They stay open really late on the weekends. I love the wonton soup because the wontons are simple but delicious with pork and chives and the broth is awesome for when you have a cold or when you want to sober up a little bit on your way home. I also find their Pad Thai to be very good. The wonton soup is under five bucks and the pad Thai is under 10 bucks. I did not honestly like their version of fried noodles or lo mein as it was more in line with the Cantonese style with smaller thinner noodles. I usually prefer the way it is made in Fujian style restaurants with thicker fried noodles. But that's a matter of preference. If you're looking for standard American style Chinese food and Thai food this is a great place to go.

We wanted to get in a handful of places as we bar hopped in the SN. It was a Saturday night probably around 10pm which I should have known better is the worst time to enter any bar. Overcrowded, super loud, obvious that getting a drink would be next to impossible. Although we planned to get drinks we all realized we really had to pee. The lines for the bathrooms were insane. Only one toilet for women and one for men. They clearly decided to maximize their square footage for bodies. It was like at the lat minute they were like oh shit we have I have a bathroom.  While waiting in line to use a restroom isn't the worst thing, having a clogged overflowing toilet with turds at the rim of the seat is pretty much inexcusable.

When we first walked in the decor really got me excited. While waiting for our table we saw lots of delicious looking dishes other people were eating and we were so excited. As we were seated, I noticed a wet stain on my seat so I used my napkin to wipe it away. The server saw me and apologized and gave me some new napkins which I really appreciated but the napkins he gave me had some dried noodle bits stuck to it. I'm a big girl I can handle that I just brushed it away and went on. I looked down at our sharing plates and noticed that my plate was dirty. My husband's fork was also dirty so I asked for those both to be replaced.

Lots of filling which made it a little \\"limp\\" it broke easy which made it a little hard to eat without spilling the filling.

The broth was very flavourful and rich which I didn't expect. It had a pork knuckle and lots of beef flank. The beef was a little dry and I'm not a big fan of knuckle but it was tasty enough. The cabbage garnish was a little eird for me but it's fine.\\n\\nAll in all, I think it didn't meet up to the hype. Everything tasted good but didn't blow me away. I probably won't go out of my way to come here but if I do come back if try the rice dishes as they looked very good."},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"With the popularity of Disney's pre-paid meal plans for hotel guests, the Magic Kingdom has been in desperate need of additional dining capacity -- especially for full-service dining. Be Our Guest, which opened in late 2012, fills this need with a unique hybrid: fast food at lunch; table service at dinner.\\n\\nDinner adds another new twist: the availability of beer and wine in the Magic Kingdom. This news is probably only shocking to locals and Disney fans, but day visitors haven't had access to alcohol in Disney's non-European \\"castle\\" parks since Disneyland opened in 1955.\\n\\nWhen one arrives for dinner, one should check-in at the unmarked stand where the crowd has formed, before crossing the bridge to the location. I'm sure signage is on the way, as most folks went to the gatekeeper first, only to be turned back. After checking in and receiving a pager, you wait outdoors on the bridge for your turn, and you are ushered in by an eager assistant quoting lines from the film. (We did wonder what the experience would be like if it were raining, or on a steamy, humid August night.)\\n\\nThe decor here is spot on. The recreation of the ballroom from \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" is spectacular, and lunchtime is as busy with diners as with looky-loos wanting photos. Graciously, Disney forbids non-diners at dinner.\\n\\nThe service is also stellar. Our server was gracious and funny, and we never felt rushed. Our dining experience took about an hour and 45 minutes.\\n\\nThis location also joins the ranks of the nearly-impossible to get into. Reservations will easily book up almost six months out. For our February meal (a Valentine's treat), I booked reservations last fall.\\n\\nKeep in mind: while the dinner service has an upscale menu (and upscale pricing), you're still in the Magic Kingdom. Casual attire is the rule: we saw people in sweats, flip-flops, T-shirts and general theme-park wear. (There were also those dressed a shade higher, perhaps due in part to our dining on a pleasant February evening.)\\n\\nI had salmon on a leek \\"fondue\\" bed, and my partner had a cornish game hen. Both were tasty, though perhaps just a notch below what they might have been in a hotel signature restaurant. One of my favorite French wines was available -- Joseph Drouhin Laforet Pinot Noir -- so it was an easy, reasonably priced choice. For white-wine fans, we noted they carry Conundrum -- another favorite, but at just shy of $60 a bottle we passed.\\n\\nMy dessert was a chocolate cream puff which was fabulous and too much all at once. Order it if you're still hungry after dinner, or consider leaving some of it behind (which would require more willpower than I possess).\\n\\nFor a bottle of wine, two appetizers, two entrees and two desserts, our bill came to just over $100, which isn't too far off of what I was expecting. Your mileage may vary.\\n\\nOverall, we had a nice meal, save these few issues: First, the ballroom is all hard surfaces, so it had the volume of a cafeteria more than that of a fine restaurant. Second, my salmon was so heavily seasoned it barely tasted like salmon (though it was still very good). Third, our two-person table was sized for a fast-food meal, and we had to jockey plates and such for position to make room for wine, bread plates and entrees. Lastly, our table was right in the entry -- I had a view into the ladies' restroom -- but fortunately our server was OK with me moving my chair to the table's side so I could see the ballroom.

Luckily, we were able to get a 5:25 reservation here only a few hours prior. We made the reservation on the WDW app, which said that the restaurant was in AK. At 5:00, we decided that we needed to head over for our reservation, and we learned that the restaurant was actually at AK Lodge! We laughed at ourselves for making this mistake and did not stress since we were less than a five minute bus ride away from the Lodge. We saw it as a fun opportunity to walk around another resort and see Disney Springs a bit to catch a bus back to our resort. Luckily, we made it with time to spare for our reservation!\\n\\nBoma was very easy to find inside of the Jambo House section of the hotel, and we were seated within two minutes of checking in. The hostess who sat us and our server were both lovely, making the experience quite pleasant.\\n\\nWe loved that we were able to walk up to any place on the buffet and did not have to wait in line for each trip to get more food. All of the food was fantastic and there were great options for many taste preferences! Highlights included the hummus, curried pasta salad and the bread pudding at dessert. The room was beautiful, and we admired it throughout the meal.\\n\\nBoma served as a wonderful, relaxing ending to our day at Animal Kingdom and I would recommend it to anyone!"},{"name":"The Mission Bar & Grill","address":"724 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I lived on the \\"hill\\" in college and never really appreciated living there until I moved to Allston.

After spending a good 14 hours conquering every square inch of the Magic Kingdom, it was nice to end the day in an elegant dining area. We did feel underdressed in our tee shirts and shorts, but we weren't the only ones. Our server's name was Frank, and he was so dear to us! We decided to skip the appetizers and go straight for the entrees. My husband ordered their steak dinner, and I went for their lamb and polenta dinner. I had never tried lamb before, so what better place than at the most magical place on earth? Best decision ever! My dinner was perfect - and I don't use that adjective often. My husband loved his meal as well. Since we were on our honeymoon, Frank also had us try the grey stuff. It really is delicious! We also had cupcakes for dessert - very sweet, but very satisfying. My only wish is that I could replicate my lamb dinner for home cooking! Be warned: the dinner menu is very expensive, but so worth the price.

It took a while for me to like the deep dish Mangia makes - two thin crusts piled with cheese with the sauce on top then the toppings, but once I got a taste for it, I can't stop loving it.

I only eat lamb if people know how to cook it to make the smell not pop out that strong. This one ??? I love it... the smell is not funny.. it is indeed delicious.

Another half an hour passed and we finally got our apps.  Not until 11:40pm did we get served our dinner.  I was livid.  If you can't accommodate 12 people or the 45 pages of your own menu then don't put yourself out there just to make the selective seem impressive.  Not only that, all the food came out at different times.  I think the last person to be served was at least 20 minutes after the first plate was brought out.

I was in a rush and needed to get to the school. They also recommended that I get 4 containers of cream cheese. I paid $27.75 and when I arrived to school realized they only gave me 20 bagels and two small containers of cream cheese. Again, nobody is picking up their phone to rectify the situation.

There were not four seats together at the bar.  After asking three times whether or not we should go somewhere else, since the hostesses were unwilling to seat us, the three hostesses had a conference and decided we could sit at one of the high tops in the bar area.

The woman asked if she could sit at a different table, closer to the Boston side of the restaurant, and we saw the hostess refuse to let them sit at a table of their choosing.  NOTE: Once we got up, they were the ONLY occupied table in the restaurant.   As we were leaving I asked if was true that the hostess denied the couple's request to sit at a table of their choosing.  The three hostesses admitted that was what happened.  A man who identified himself as a manager approached the hostess stand.  I told him the story of what happened to us and what happened to the other couple.  While he listened to my complaint, he seemed to hold open the possibility that there could be some explanation for the behavior of the team of hostesses.  At this point, the only occupied table in the restaurant was the one with the unhappy couple.  He said sometime they held tables for reservations.  Right.

I'm actually re-typing this, as I wrote a review that day, it SUPPOSEDLY auto-saved, but Yelp was down for maintenance. When Yelp came back up, my carefully thought-out witty review... was no mas.  Undeterred Yelper that I am, I took the weekend to sulk, and here we go again; TAKE 2, as we say in my biz...\\n\\nAs many of you know, Your Ol' Pal Shooey is getting ready to have open-heart surgery in three weeks.  The little instruction thingie from my cardiologist specifically said AVOID alcohol and AVOID red meat. Believe me, I've been trying. They always seem to find me, and jump down the ol' gullet before I know what happened. Anyway, so this past Friday at work, I had a little scare. A co-worker who was just on his way to lunch offered to take me back to Casa Shoehead and get my meds.  So on the way back, as we approached the office, with my head still in a woozy state, my co-worker said 'I'm hungry\\" and whipped into the Culver's drive-thru.  Not knowing exactly what kind of place it was, I thought to myself, \\"Yeah, I'll order a salad...\\"  ...until we pulled up to the menu board.  *sigh*  Not this time.\\n\\nThe menu had the uninspired mediocrity of most burger joints, with lacklustre pictures of the fare. I immediately spied the Mushroom and Swiss burger, but after the previous night's stellar M & S at Cover 2, ordering one only promised disappointment.  My inner cardiac patient told me to at least pay a modicum of lip-service to \\"healthy eating\\", and order either the lathargic looking fried or the tired looking grilled chicken sandwich... Until I saw it. Prime Rib Sandwich! At the same time, an audible voice rang in my ear, \\"THE POWER OF BEEF COMPELS YOU!\\"  I blurted the order into the order speaker faster than any decision I've ever made in my life, (except possibly to marry the soon-to-be-ex Lovely Mrs Shoehead)  We sped off, and scampered back to our desks, grinning like two kids with Halloween bags.\\n\\nThe sandwich was really not bad. A decent size, with a nice amount of (presumably) prime rib. The meat was flavorful and tender. There was a nice blanket of melted Swiss, and finely diced red onions snugly underneath.  all-in-all, it was a pretty decent sandwich.  The fries were unremarkable, and a bit soggy. The unsweetend iced tea was cold, and not sweet--as promised.  The whole meal didn't suck, but will not send me running back either.  The mediocrity or the place leads me to give it three stars, but the sandwich was OK, so make it three platinum, diamond-studded stars. \\n\\nI understand they're known for their custard, so I'll give the custard a shot, and see if I can bump it up a star..."},{"name":"Clyde Common","address":"1014 SW Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Went with a group of 7 people total tonight (April 11, 2010) and we experienced excellent service at the bar and from the hostess, but once we got sat it was all downhill from there.

The prawns, crabs and all the other seafood chunks are so soft that they literally melt in your mouth. Among the noodles I would recommend having the Singapore rice noodles. The pork potstickers are also very soft and cooked to perfection. I would suggest not to try the items with the sauces such as mango sauce or sesame sauce as they are quite bland.

Jiko, Swahili for cooking place, offers the most exclusive South African Wine lists in the United States. Most of the selections are available by the glass, which provides a great opportunity to try some new wines that are rarely available anywhere else. The South African climate is not that much different from the northern California coast so many of the same grape varietals are available, such as Chardonnay, but there are also many new and unusual wines to tempt your palate as well.\\nThe food is a multicultural infusion of modern styles and dishes with traditional African inspired flavor and ingredients. Each dish offers beautiful colors and spice, which pair beautifully with many of the available wine selection. I've been told that the menu changes often but no matter what they happen to be serving you are sure to find a fantastic meal. Definitely try one of the exotic fish dishes, which include pan-roasted monkfish or banana leaf-steamed Chilean Sea bass.\\nThe interior is both simple and exotic with earthy tones of brown and orange and two huge wood-burning ovens as the centerpiece of the open kitchen. Throughout the restaurant and across the back wall are suspended white birds that fly gracefully in front of a lighted backdrop that slowly changes through the cycle of an African day from dawn to dusk. Overall the whole dining experience is a feast for the senses and an amazing opportunity to branch out and try something a little exotic."},{"name":"Marika's","address":"199 Cabot St","city":"Beverly","stars":"4","text":"Excellent food!!

Great ingredients, but I was somewhat disappointed when it came to be undercooked. The dough unfortunately still tasted doughy, so the consistency of a thin sliced pizza was not there. It was flimsy and doughy.\\n\\nBut I still devoured a large pizza...and by myself, but I wasn't finished yet. So I got some of their \\"coppa di brutti ma buoni,\\" which is something Italian for \\"ugly but good.\\" Basically it's an Italian equivalent for a sundae. This definitely made up for the undercooked pizza. But damn, a $14 sundae should be good and it was pretty good. I would come back just for this \\"ugly but good\\" sundae.\\n\\nOverall, a pretty great experience. They have a decent wine selection. The service was great.

WHOA! i got the toffee pudding (which i walked in knowing i was ordering, but the waitress suggesting it really sealed the deal) and steve got the panna cotta. i seriously would go back to sixty2 on wharf for the toffee pudding alone. the cakey stuff was very moist and flavorful, the warm, gooey sauce made me want to die of delicious overload, and the real whipped cream was so perfect. except for it wasn't perfect for this lactose intolerant lady and i was in pain the rest of the night, but that's what lactaid is for. i just forget to use it pretty much always. the panna cotta was great, too, but i really focused on the toffee pudding.\\n\\noh! they have a good beer list, too. they carry a couple long trail. i got the long trail hefeweizen. i love hefeweizen for reals.\\n\\nthe regular menu was awesome and i'm totally going back. i think the prices for entrees were from about $12 to a bit over $20. i don't have any more room to write!"},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"My daughter & I were lucky enough to get a dinner reservation at her beloved Beast's Be Our Guest.

I'd go back for it alone.\\n\\nSo all in all, I guess I wind up with a 3 because there was a lot not great here, but one totally amazing dessert and good salad made up for the rest."},{"name":"Clyde Common","address":"1014 SW Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I have to say I was underwhelmed. Nothing about this place sold me for a second visit.  The service was strange out of the 5 people that came to our table only one was remotely friendly and helpful.  The food was... Meh! The whipped cheese app had great presentation but there was not enough berries or toast to enjoy the cheese. My gnocchi looked like poop but tasted ok.  The ramps were by far the highlight! The desserts were also just ok! My response to this place is that the menu is too pretentious for what it is."},{"name":"Buk Kyung II","address":"151 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"3.5","text":"My friend and I, neither of us are Korean, wanted authentic and delicious Korean food, so we pretty much just tailed a group of young Korean folks into this restaurant. Best way to find authentic eats, yeah? \\n\\nThe servers are nice, a little slow, and kept speaking to me in Korean even though I don't understand at all. . . . so I was confused most of the time. \\n\\nWe were going to order tofu soup and spicy pork with rice, until we looked around and saw almost every table ordering noodles dishes. We took a close look at the menu and noticed that they make their own noodles! So I changed my order and went with Jambong, even though I had no idea what it was. \\n\\nAnd. . . . .it was GREAT! I added the $1 for extra seafood and it came with plenty. The noodles were chewy, swimming in the sea of red hot broth that was definitely amazing :).  The bowl was quite large too! Though I was hungry, I could only finish 1/2 of it by the end of dinner. \\n\\nI'd definitely return and try some more noodle dishes. :) Thanks, random group of young people that we tailed for this good find!"},{"name":"Zaika Indian Bistro","address":"442 Main St","city":"Woburn","stars":"4.5","text":"Simple and a small restaurant on Main Street. We have been taking out food from them since they have opened. Never had any complaints with food. Staff are really nice and friendly. \\n\\nTheir Chicken Tikka (Kebab) is by far the best ones we have had in US. Great flavors, juicy and reminds home. The Naan and Kulcha are of great quality. Other favorites are Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Dhaniwal Kurma and Chicken Madras. Good part about takeout is you get surprise free appetizers some times. There was once some confusion with our pickup order and we had to wait extra 10 mins. The owners made up for that by giving us on the house Mango Lassi :)\\n\\nWe have used their catering services for a party. High quality food delivered on time. They were amazing and our guests loved the food. Price was very reasonable. \\n\\nGlad to know they are opening in Bedord, MA some times soon. We can start getting home delivery."},{"name":"Sweet Carrot","address":"1417 W 5th Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"My wife and I hired Sweet Carrot to cater our wedding and could not be happier with the choice.

The menu is varied and anything you get is going to be tasty, they also have the best cole slaw this side of the Mississippi River.  I would say that it is a little pricey and that delivery can sometime be a little long (resulting in some melted fro yo!!), but that over all what ever you order from Amsterdam is going to be delicious.  The French Fries here, are the best....ever!!"},{"name":"Union Burger","address":"9680 Narcoossee Rd, Unit 103","city":"Orlando","stars":"2","text":"Overpriced and mildly disappointing.

The Nutella milkshake was very good, although I think it had pieces of Kit Kat bar in it???\\nAs they're a new restaurant I'll give them another try and the benefit of the doubt that they're still fine tuning the details.

Sure, I've passed by it god knows how many times but have never set foot in here.  While my opinion may not be popular it's totally unbiased.  This place is TINY and has plenty of charm.  The parking is as minimal as the seating, so be prepared to be dealing with frustration depending on when you decide to try it out.  Observations; There was literally one person working the counter and floor.  It wasn't crazy busy but I could see how this could create issues.  The menu isn't very big yet options are to be had.  The tortillas are seemingly made fresh and you can definitely taste it.  The salsa is freaking delicious, one of the best I've had in town.  The prices are definitely a little on the high side.  I mean, I get it, you're place is small and you're in a very high dollar real estate area.  I had the beef fajita taco plate and was a little underwhelmed when my plate arrived.  I had their vermicelli and refried beans as side dishes.  The tacos themselves were literally beef and sauteed onions.  No accoutrements, no garnish, nothing.  The last impression I had was the counter person/server seemingly being rude to my dining partner.  Thankfully, I didn't witness it but surely not a positive thing."},{"name":"El Azteca Mexican Restaurant","address":"1784 Peachtree Rd NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is really good and the staff are really nice.

I figured I was going to be there for at least 10 minutes or longer but they were able to move everyone through in less than 5 minutes.  I can't ask for more than that when there is a gargantuan line during the lunch hour.  \\n\\nAnother good aspect was that they had about 2,328 people (give or take a few) working behind the counter which is why they were able to move the very long line along.  I hate places who try to save a buck but skimping on servers/work and sacrificing service/timeliness.  Kudos to Chipotle."},{"name":"The Mission Bar & Grill","address":"724 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The nachos were pretty boring. The taco salad was similar.

Now, before I got into my spiel, I have to say that the quizmaster here is awesome. He's friendly, funny, and makes the pub quiz a lot of fun. That said, the service here is abysmal. Every time I've come here, my waiter/waitress has gotten something wrong about my or one of my friends' orders. I'm not sure if it's because they have a low standard when it comes to their hiring practices or what, but it seems everyone who works here is equally inattentive to their customers' needs.\\n\\nA few weeks ago, I went there with some friends to give them another try after some disappointment in the past. Unfortunately, the service didn't improve at all. In fact, it may have gotten worse. First of all, we all ordered drinks and that was fine. However, after ordering drinks, we didn't see our waitress again for the next thirty minutes or so. This was particularly frustrating for one of my friends who wanted to order food as well. Eventually, we just had to ask another server to get our waitress so that he could order. When she finally returned, he ordered his food and another friend of mine ordered a glass of cabernet. However, when the waitress brought it out, she set a flute of champagne down on the table and walked off before my friend could say anything. It took us another ten minutes or so before we could find someone to bring us the correct drink.\\n\\nThis wasn't the only order mix up either. Another friend of mine, who was sitting at a table across from us, ordered a gin and juice. When they brought out her drink, it was a pint of beer. My friend asked what drink the server had given her the server didn't know. She said she had just picked it up from the bartender. Someone eventually brought her the correct drink, but did not apologize about the mistake.\\n\\nWhen we were ready to leave, the server would not split up our checks even though there were eight people in our party, and we were sitting at two different tables. Additionally, the champagne that my friend had been served instead of cabernet was still on the check. Overall, we were just happy to get out of there once everything had been squared away. If I ever go back it will only be to use the gift cards we have won during the pub quizzes. Otherwise, I will be going to Mr. Tramps for my Wednesday pub quizzes from now on."},{"name":"Chatime","address":"1545 West Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Worst Chatime location.

The Original Glazed really is pretty special when you get to have it fresh enough that it's still hot. Not many donut places offer you that. \\n\\nThe coffee is actually pretty tasty and you can get things like lattes and mochas, so that's an extra star out of the gate.\\n\\nThey have a drive through, but it's very worth at least one visit inside to watch the conveyor belt if you never have. I have mixed thoughts about watching the donuts move along on the conveyor belt under the descending sheet of glaze. While it's very, very cool to watch and at first gets me hungry for donuts, if I watch too long, it starts to fall under the TMI about food category (kind of like how knowing what's in a hot dog can ruin one if you let it) because it starts to look almost too sickeningly sweet to actually want to put much of that in your body. Not that it stops me.\\n\\nIf you have kids that have never been to Krispy Kreme, the conveyor belt should be as much of a hit as the donuts."},{"name":"Hon's Wun-Tun House","address":"1339 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Light on ambiance, but heavy on food, Hon's sports a sizeable menu of greasy Chinese comfort food.

Try it.  \\n\\nI have to admit I actually ordered some spicy tuna rolls for myself this last time.  I'm trying to acquire the taste for the sushi thing, but it's going rather slowly I'm afraid.

We made 3 orders for grilled tenders and two of them were fried. We asked them to correct the order and that we ordered grilled and the response we  received was that grilled would take too long. We then asked for our money back and they were able to mess that up as well. I asked for a receipt to confirm the credit, but they couldn't provide that either. I never received the credit and had to call in to get it done. The so called manager was extremely rude and had no interest to help.
