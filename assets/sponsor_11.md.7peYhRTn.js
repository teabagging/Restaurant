But for the past 7 months or so, I've been very disappointed. I've been driving all the way across town on a weekly basis for years just to enjoy my favorite vegan comfort food: the Hawthorne Mac and cheese. \\n\\nIt used to be the best here: hot, creamy, \\"cheesy,\\" and exactly the same every time - as you'd expect from a restaurant. \\n\\nBut ever since August or so, it's been remarkably inconsistent and more often than not, very disappointing. One day it'll be watery and under flavored; the next it'll be an entirely different recipe altogether (some kind of nutritional yeast mixture rather than the old Daiya), and so on and so forth. Not once in the past 7 months has it been as good as it used to be. And it is always different. I never know what to expect. \\n\\nI guess I should just stop coming, but I look forward to it so much and I always have high hopes that it'll be better this time. \\n\\nThat hasn't happened yet, though. \\n\\nTonight I was especially disappointed: the dish came out lukewarm with barely cooked pasta, half-raw kale, and watery, over-salted sauce. I almost wanted to cry into my bowl of disappointment.  \\n\\nI've brought it up to employees a handful of times. The first guy said maybe it was just a different cook and instructed the cook to make it creamier. This helped make the sauce less watery, but it still didn't rival the \\"old\\" Mac and cheese. \\n\\nAnother guy kinda shrugged and said he didn't know. \\n\\nTonight I was informed that the recipe has been changed about 8 times over the past several months. That makes sense given my experience. But why?!! If the current recipe stays, I won't be eating Mac and cheese here again. EVER.

It would have been better had the peppers and spinach been even across the sandwich because they were the best part. \\n\\nFor the burger. I tend to think people who eat burgers can be of two kinds: those who season the beef and those who (if at all) only use lite salt and pepper. The people of Toasted are of the first variety, and believe me when I tell you that the patty by itself (which I tasted because my partner couldn't tell if there was something wrong with the meat) tasted really nasty, like I had mistakenly eaten something that was never meant to be food. The bun and condiments were great though, except the onions, which were thick enough to use as fake teeth (if you're into that sort of thing, we just toss them to the side).\\n\\nNow the fries themselves are so nice, they must make them fresh and they would have been great I'm sure if we'd only gotten them salted. The rosemary truffle oil is a terrible combination, it smells and tastes like I should just take it home and cleanse my house with it, just too much and a bad combination.

One of my friends, who I haven't seen since high school, had a little too much to drink last Friday night. She was so drunk, in fact, that no taxi driver would pick us up. She was randomly slapping boys she thought were cute, telling adorable couples they were going to break up, and even went so far as to flail her legs wildly at parked cars (which obviously resulted in a cop threatening to take her to the drunk tank). My other friend, who hangs out with said drunk friend more often, tried her best to control Drunk Friend while my husband and I stood back and watched her aghast. \\n\\nAfter walking over the Burnside bridge and managing to keep Drunk Friend from falling off the side, Other Friend decided we needed a break and figured getting Drunk Friend a slice of pizza would help calm her down. Or least keep something in mouth for a few minutes so we could get a moment of peace. While they ordered pizza (At a pizza place outside Dante's I don't know the name of, so sorry no Yelp review. But it was good!), I went inside to use the restroom. \\n\\nI expected them to be jerks about it or have to wait in line to even get inside, but nope. I just flashed my ID and walked right in.

I had to respectfully keep my distance from the stalls as I waited my turn because otherwise I would have been able to see right over them and onto the squatting girl inside.

Fantastic. \\n\\nWhen I came out of the bathroom I finally started to pay attention to what kind of establishment we were in and said to my husband \\"This is where we'd hang out if we lived in Portland!\\" Black clothing and guys with long hair ran wild.

My friends and I sat outside where we watched a ton of runners go by, making us think about our poor life decisions that we were still drunk from the night before and they were out running a casual few miles. \\n\\nI'm a bit of a bloody mary connoisseur, and I think the bloody mary here is the best one I've ever had. When I saw the \\"Make Your Own Bloody Mary\\" checklist at the table with about twenty-five different add-ins to choose from, I knew I'd be starting my morning off right. My friend and I thought it would be a good idea to check off everything on the list (turned into a $25 bloody, definitely a spectacle which unfortunately drew other guests to our table when we were trying to be inconspicuous in our ridiculous state). Pepperoni and cheese skewer, slim jim, shrimp, blue cheese stuffed olives, green beans, pickle, pepperoncini, old bay seasoned rim, celery were only some of the ingredients that were stacked high on the bloody. Amazing. \\n\\nFor my meal I got a pulled pork omelet which I'm sure would have been really good but my hangover was starting to kick in making it really hard for me to eat anything. My friends said their meals were great...blanking on what they ordered.\\n\\nBonus points to the waiter who poked fun at us because of the condition we were in. We were not the easiest customers, but we were definitely the most laughable because nothing that came out of our mouths was remotely comprehendable (or even English for that matter). I will definitely be back for brunch again...maybe next time I'll be presentable. But probably not."},{"name":"Centro Mexican Kitchen","address":"950 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Best queso fundido (queso with pumpkin seeds) - served with tortillas; we also got chips.

Moar benito flakes!\\n\\nSushi-wise, we split the soft shell crab ($9-$10), the tomago ($5-$6), the spicy tuna maki ($6.25), and the harmony maki ($6).  Perfect amount of food for two people.  Soft shell crab was great - 5 pieces of crispy fried soft shell crab and fresh avocado.  Tomago (2 pieces) was decent according to my friend, although the sweet-egg flavor has never quite appealed to me so I only took a bite.  The spicy tuna maki was lined with a little crispy tempura of sorts, which I loved - thought it really added to the texture.  And my all-around favorite was the harmony maki - mackerel soaked in sriracha sauce, with avocado - yummy!\\n\\nAmbiance - nice, a little on the cheesy-side of slick.

Those statements might be true. IMHO, however, if you leave thinking either of those things, I do not believe you were in the correct mindset when you sat down.\\n\\nThe idea here is to experience, learn and grow. Each bite is a journey and should be savored. It's not a \\"get full\\" kind of place. You eat the food with the same type of respect that it's shown while being prepared and plated. It's the type of place you can enjoy even when you aren't necessarily hungry if you are thinking of it this way.\\n\\nThat being said - it was a a special occasion. ;)\\n\\nWe were in Austin for a week just after our 6th wedding anniversary so I chose Emmer & Rye after much research. This is our favorite way to dine and we love to support restaurants that source locally and give a great feel of the neighborhood/community they are a part of. E&R nailed it!\\n\\nWe picked 5 plates from the menu and selected 2-3 items from dim sum carts. We were totally satisfied with the amount of food. We ordered 2 cocktails and made them last throughout the meal. If you haven't ever tried Monkey 47 gin, stop what you're doing and find it. \\n\\nI legit loved everything we tried, but the Tomato / Mozz / Basil sorbet really stood out to me. It tasted like bruschetta ice cream. Not just any bruschetta, like the BEST you ever had kind. You just don't expect that combo of flavors while eating sorbet. That's some Alinea shit right there. \\n\\nI am happy to say that Emmer & Rye served me some of the most beautifully executed food i've had the pleasure of sampling in my life.

We tried again last night, for what we thought was a long-overdue revisit. The first thing we noticed when we walked in was that the attractive and stylishly dressed young women at the host podium seemed efficient rather than friendly. There was no rudeness per se: just a sense of \\"ah, you're here, let's get you to a table and move this thing along.\\" Perhaps that initial impression colored my perceptions for the rest of the evening, but from that point on, I'd describe all our encounters with staff as a bit hurried and frenzied, which unfortunately communicated itself to us and made us feel tense and anxious. Our smiling, gracious waiter came quickly, but again, seeming somewhat like he was on the clock, and needing us to keep up. We ordered iced tea and a cocktail, which we assumed we'd receive quickly and savor at our leisure, but surprisingly, we were offered the opportunity at that point to order our meals, which we did, mostly because we got caught up in the brusqueness of the pace. The oddly disconcerting outcome was that I was served my soup course before I ever got my cocktail - not a huge deal, but again, what's the hurry? Our drinks arrived shortly after I finished the soup, which I didn't want to eat cold. Our entrees came after a reasonably relaxed span of time, and were beautifully plated. I got the Walleye special and my companion got the New York strip special. The first bite of my Walleye confirmed that it was perfectly cooked and delicious. A couple of the side dishes - the \\"spicy\\" coleslaw and cheesy grits - were under-salted, and I actually had to use salt from the table to give them some spark - something I don't think I should ever have to do at a \\"fine dining\\" restaurant. My companion's New York strip was a different experience. His first-bite impression was that either the meat hadn't been trimmed well in the kitchen, or else it wasn't a good cut of meat to begin with. Underneath the nice sauce, it was gristly and chewy and not especially flavorful, even though it came as medium-rare as he'd asked. The crab cake that accompanied it was very good. My observation to him, with which he agreed, was that if a restaurant that doesn't specialize in steak decides to serve steak, particularly as a special, then it better be darn-near flawless. His definitely was not. The real stunner came when we got the bill, and discovered that the New York strip special was FORTY SEVEN DOLLARS. I even asked the waiter if that was a mistake. He said it wasn't, and seemed apologetic. If I'm going to pay the same price for a steak dinner at 8 State Bistro that I'm going to pay at any of the best steak houses in town, the steak itself ought to be every bit as good. It wasn't. Last but not least, I asked about the offer I'd seen on Facebook the previous day: that mentioning the one-year-anniversary of the restaurant would get us 50% off our meal (which would have made up for the steak), but the waiter informed me that it was more of a roulette, and the prize could be anything from 50% off to a free appetizer. That came as a surprise, and felt a bit \\"bait and switch,\\" but I opted in and got 15% off anyway. Better than nothing. Overall impression ... if I were asked by the owner/manager of 8 State Bistro to give unvarnished feedback, I'd tell him or her that something or someone in the workflow or chain of command is making the staff nervous. They're not relaxed, they're not having fun, and it bleeds over into the customer experience. Contrast this to a restaurant with similar ambiance and ambitions - \\"Third and Hollywood\\" in Grandview - where everyone on staff seems genuinely charming, easy-going, and welcoming, but still efficient. Bottom line for me is that 8 State Bistro subtly demonstrates a discordant disconnect between its pretensions and its product. Given its competition in the Central Ohio market, \\"fine dining\\" needs to be a seamless experience; not broken, for example, by the bus-guy wandering up and down the main serving aisle with a big black plastic tub. Yeah, that happened. It works at Bob Evans, not in Uptown Westerville."},{"name":"Hong Kong","address":"1238 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"I never liked this place for the food.

Thats the only reason I can think of to explain how they've been around this long and somehow still have some semblance of a good reputation.  \\nI haven't been to Stephanie's in years, but I recently suggested it to a group of friends who I was out to dinner with for one person's 41st birthday.  We made a last-minute reservation here because our first plan fell through.  Somehow, I think this biased them against us before we even arrived.\\nThe host gave me a less than warm greeting when we arrived, and directed us to the packed bar to wait.  This was difficult as there was no place to sit or stand without being in the staff's way.  After about 15 minutes, we were seated at what was referred to as their \\"best table\\".  I'm not sure how that could be the case as the table is next to their linen chest, which staff kept reaching behind us for.  *Note to self: don't store linen behind corner 8-top round table.\\nOur server started out ok, but things quickly went downhill when one of our party showed up late and not exactly dressed for our dining choice.  Not his fault, but seemed to rub our server the wrong way.  This late guest also did make a few dining faux pas's, but again, I expect service at an establishment like Stephanie's to be a little less rigid and a little more professional (ie, don't wear your dislike for a guest on your face). \\nTo make matters worse, when our entrees were served, the guest in question did NOT receive his entree.  The server checked in at the table, at which point we pointed this out to him.  He made a disgusted face and didn't return for almost 30 minutes.  A busboy finally brought the dinner, at which point the rest of the table had finished their meals and some were already being cleared.  Our friend sent the entree back, which prompted the manager to come over and apologize.  Still no check in from our server.\\nEventually, the server came back and barely spoke to us.  He was cordial, at best.  \\nWe had been carrying around our own birthday cake (again, not having planned to be here) which we asked them to serve - and we paid a plating fee, even though they didn't plate it.  After dinner was cleared, it took at least another 10-15 minutes before we saw the cake.  Not sliced, not plated, just carried out.  \\nWhen we left, I went to speak with the manager to apologize for any difficulty on the part of our friend, but to highlight the missteps of our server, as well.  I was told he had left for the evening, which I find curious when the restaurant was still half-full and open for another hour or so.\\n\\n*To boot, the friend whose birthday we were celebrating is in a wheelchair and is fighting a life-threatening illness which has slowly caused him to lose quite a bit of freedom.  Not that the restaurant should have known this, but their complete lack of professionalism throughout the night and horrible treatment of our group overall sure made for a lousy birthday.  I, personally, am embarrassed that I even suggested Stephanie's for this outing and feel badly that the birthday boy could have had a lot more fun."},{"name":"Ah Sing Den","address":"1100 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"As a former patron of East Side Show Room and a big fan of everything oriental, I was excited to try Ah Sing Den for the first time.

The shishito peppers had so much sauce they were almost soupy; the crab gyoza weren't done enough; and the meat on the hot rock was so poorly cut and presented that we sent it back.

But this behavior, so crass, rude, and downright unprofessional, should not be tolerated, especially when it's impossible to order anywhere else after 10 pm.

The interior decor is beautiful, from their comfortable white leather futons, open bar with everything from beer to wine and their special drinks. A few flat screen televisions showing sports/BET and rap music blasting.

Under the watchful eye of the moon, there were three cabanas side by side, with white leather (L shaped) lounge chairs and a coffee table with aromatic candles lit. They also had about three tiki torches and two cocktail tables just in front the cabanas, another plasma TV on the wall and a piece of a red carpet that just seemed to be thrown in... I guess you could say you walked the red carpet...lol \\n\\nI didn't appreciate the fact that;\\n-Despite a turn out of about 50 people they only had one waitress working the patio. However, she provided the best possible service.\\n-The host of the event had intended on doing a video slideshow and got approval from the owner beforehand. However, on the day of the event the owner couldn't find the box that connects to the television. The host was asked to mount a ladder to access the USB port on the TV but, after this was done the owner still couldn't find the remote. Now, that sucks!\\n-You were not able to hear the live band from the patio. I wish you could, that would have been great.\\n-There is a wooden outdoor storage shed at the back where some of the cooking gets done, hmm. \\n-A friend of mine was displeased with her drink and they refused to exchange it.\\n\\nI'd recommend Toppings if you're looking for a decent place to host an event, particularly the patio on a cool night (just don't do a video slideshow).

When I discovered this place was almost entirely gluten free, I knew I had to treat myself. \\n\\nThe bowls themselves are well constructed, with fresh, high quality fish. I had the yellow fin and tuna when I went. You can create your own bowl, or chose from some pre-planned combinations. I took one of their suggested bowls and made some modifications. The girl behind the counter was very friendly and helpful, and was happy to answer all of my questions about the ingredients and even went to ask the manage for the few things she wasn't 100% sure about. \\n\\nI'm used to restaurants not taking my concerns and questions seriously (yes, I have to eat gluten free. Yes, it's for medical reasons. Yes, cross contamination matters) so it was really nice to see a positive friendly response. \\n\\nAll of the ingredients in my bowl were fresh and the flavors mingled well. Nothing over powered anything else. I like that they let you sample the sauces first. The togarashi and avocado creme sauces complemented each other nicely.\\n\\nAnd! all of their sauces are gluten free - yes, the soy sauce and ponzu.  Please, PLEASE don't ever change this! I also appreciated how they kept the one not-gluten-free topping separate from the other ingredients, so there wasn't an opportunity for cross contamination. This is the right way to do gluten free! It doesn't cost the restaurant anything extra to do it, and it allows them to accommodate gluten free customers easily. \\n\\nI finished my meal with pineapple dole whip. Yes, THAT dole whip. Official,pineapple Dole whip. \\nThe kind that is usually found at Disney World. \\n\\nMy only apprehension is that as they get more popular, they may start cutting corners with ingredients, or reduce or remove the gluten free soy sauces.

We know that getting in on a Saturday night is usually a tough thing given the popularity of the restaurant.  We took advantage of the call ahead seating.  I called at 6:00 pm for seating at 6:30 and was told by the host that the wait was 1 and 1/2 hours.  When we arrived, there about 70 people in the waiting area and spilling into the bar area.  When we checked in, they told us that the wait would be 45 minutes (which is not bad).  We spent the time in the bar chatting with our friends and having a drink.  The wait was more like an hour and 15 minutes and we had started to talk about going somewhere else.  Finally, we were seated. [Note #1: avoid Saturday night and the long wait.  There's got to be a better way to handling the crowd and getting people to table quicker.  While time wasn't a problem for us, had we had other things going on that night, we would not have been able to make it]\\n\\nBJs has a great selection of beers brewed on site and my favorite is the India Pale Ale.  Nice and hoppy, with a good finish.\\n\\nTableside service was very good. Our waitress checked on us frequently but was unobtrusive.  And despite the huge crowd, the meals came quickly.\\n\\n For my meal, I had the half rack of ribs with baked potato and salad.  The salads were good sized portions with lots of extras in them: carrots, croutons, and a mix of lettuces.  I didn't ask for the dressing to be on the side so it was already on the salad when served.  I could have used a little more dressing, but that wasn't a problem.\\n\\nMy main course, though, was disappointing.  The ribs were very dry and really didn't have much flavor.  They were coated with a barbecue sauce that was ok.  The meat did come right off the bone, so they were done properly.  I think that they had been made well ahead of service and were sitting somewhere and got dry.  They did have a nice char on the outside of the sauce, so they were fired before being sent to the table.  The baked potato was very large, but was also dry inside.  I eat lots of these things and I'm not sure how you get it so dry in the middle.  I had to ask for more sour cream just to soften it up.\\n\\nThis was the second meal that I had a BJs that I thought was underwhelming. I asked my friends how their meals were and they said that they liked the food, so it must just be me.\\n\\nThe bottom line for me is that there are some really good restaurants in Columbus, and, for now, I plan to go to one of them instead of BJs."},{"name":"SnowBean","address":"5310 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"The place was nice and small it does not have that much variety when it comes to deserts in general a lot of tea and drink, which that is fine.

We weren't quite sure where to go, but I remembered that Stephanie's had an upstairs that I thought, there may not many people in that area as it was the afternoon.  From the moment we entered the restaurant and asked the hostess for help to when the EMTs walked us out, the staff of Stephanie's showed a tremendous amount of compassion and professionalism.\\n\\nImmediately, the hostess took my friend to a booth in the back of the restaurant and Chris, the manager, came over to see if my friend needed water or a bite to eat.  Fortunately a waitress was a trained EMT and came over to take my friend's vitals.  The waitress eventually made the decision that it was important to call an ambulance.  This was all done while miraculously not causing a scene.\\n\\nI was amazed at not only the professionalism but the compassion they showed.  They didn't freak out and they didn't minimize the situation.  In addition, there was a point at which bringing a stretcher in to remove my friend was an option and Chris shared that it had been done before despite the difficult walk ways.  I could imagine for anyone running a dining establishment, this would not be an ideal situation, but again, Chris was absolutely incredible at his handling of the situation.  Fortunately, my friend was able to take her time to be able to sit up and walk out of Stephanie's with the EMTs.\\n\\nIn reading the reviews here, I understand why people can be overly picky and think that a very popular place on Newbury Street can be overpriced compared to other establishments they are used to.  However, yesterday each person we interacted with at Stephanie's showed their genuine care and concern for a fellow human despite what it could do for their business.  This should not go unnoticed and I believe they should be commended for their actions.

Yes, it took ~1 minute for a waiter to walk up to us and seat us. Yes, it did take about 7 minutes for the bread to arrive. Yes, the waiter was not super observant on refilling our glasses. But other than that, everything was great. The bread served before the appetizer was warm (bonus points for that, since I've been to many MUCH more expensive places where the bread have been cold). The first appetizer (bruschettas) was delicious. The second (mushroom pizza) was a bit boring. The filet mignon was one of the best I've ever had (super juicy and tender). I had planned to get dessert, but was so full by the time I finished the filet mignon that I didn't have room for dessert, so never got to sample that.\\n\\nOne thing that I like about this restaurant is that it is relatively quiet, making it possible to talk with your partner without having to ask \\"what?\\" every second second.

Last night we attended a food and wine pairing (event held once a month at the Cappriccio Grill) where the menu is preselected and the wine selection is paired perfectly to complement the flavors in each of the four course meals. The dinner costs about 65 dollars per person, which in my opinion is a small price to pay for the 2 hour palate vacation. Cappriccio Grill sources meat and vegetables from as close as local farms to as far as Italy.\\n\\nWe were greeted with a glass of wine and light appetizer during the social reception before dinner. They assign you a table and you have the company of other wine and food enthusiasts sharing your table. The four course meal was incredible. I have to say, I would have never ordered something like Goose Liver Torchon,  Rabbit Fricassee , or Pomegranate Glazed Lamb Chops, but that was the beauty of this dinner, I didn't have to choose. I think that a lot of people stay in there food comfort zone.(What mom used to make). I was afraid to go to expensive restaurants and order something unusual. \\n\\nThe food was prepared expertly by Chef Isaac and the kitchen staff. I loved everything about each plate.

Their hot subs are real hot subs from a grill, instead of crappy boiled meat run through a toaster (I'm looking at you, Quiznos).  And if you don't like subs, they have white bread, white bread, tortillas (wraps), bulkie rolls (or \\"kaiser rolls\\", if you prefer), and marble rye.  The most expensive item is $7.00 for a large steak bomb, and most sandwiches are cheaper than that.  They're also a corner store, so you have a much wider selection of beverages and chips than you find at most other places.  Their salads are also very good and quite large -- they have everything from a regular garden salad to all sorts of specialties.   And you can get a side order of potato salad, cole slaw or pasta salad for a very reasonable price.  I've never had their soup, but I've seen enough people order it that I imagine it's as good as everything else they have there.\\n\\nOne of the biggest benefits is that when they take your order, they write it down, so they almost never get the order wrong.  And you can call ahead so your sandwich is ready to be picked up when you get there!  There is sometimes a line, particularly right around 12:00, but it moves very quickly.

I should go there.\\" The other week I finally DID go there and fortunately it was a rather nice meal.\\n\\nI was instantly taken with the decor of the place. Whoever designed this place did a bang up job, because it looks fantastic. It's a very warm and inviting atmosphere with nice artifacts and art displayed throughout. The multi-level patio looks like it'd be a great spot for happy hours. A+ on that end for sure. \\n\\nThe food was pretty good. We started with the carbonara pizza, which was tasty enough but very much a brunch pizza. The egg totally overpowers the rest of the flavors and I couldn't really detect any of the cream sauce. Even though there was plenty of the pancetta to be seen, it wasn't strong enough to compete with the egg so it was kind of disappointing in that respect. The crust, however, did taste good and was a nice egg carrier. For my entree, I had the saltimbocca di pollo (chicken saltimbocca panini). The challah bun was good enough for me to want to make a \\"holla!\\" pun but I'll spare you. The chicken was tender and the walnut crust, while not particularly bursting with nut flavor, was crunchy and nice. My friend ordered the piccole polpette (meatball sub). I had a bite of one of the meatballs and uh. Yeah. I want to eat more of those. Quite literally, if they had brought me a dirty skillet chock full of those meat balls and asked me to pay to eat them off of the floor, I'd probably have done it. There are a myriad of ball puns I could make, but as with the \\"holla!\\" pun, you will be spared. I ordered a side of fingerling potatoes, which was pretty unnecessary. Cooked well, sure, but unnecessary. \\n\\nThe service was quite good. Our server was very attentive in terms of making sure that water and tea were refilled when necessary and was great about giving us time to peruse the menu. We didn't wait long at all for any part of our order to arrive. All in all, it was a pretty nice experience.\\n\\nWhen I go back, I'd like it to be for an intimate but casual-ish date or something like that. This seems like it'd be a pretty prime spot for that.

We have been here three times in the past 2 years, because we really wanted to like the place.  The first time was just to check it out - we weren't overly impressed, and the second and third times were with a Groupon.  We sat at the bar all three times, because you typically get better service at the bar.  Not here.\\n\\nThe last time we went, about a week ago, the bartender took our drink order right away and let us sit for a bit before taking our food order - not too long though.  My husband ordered the fish and a side Caesar, and I ordered a chicken dish also with a side Caesar.  For a Saturday night the place was not very busy at all, but after waiting 1/2 hour for our salads, I finally said something.  Obviously the bartender had forgotten (we noticed that she didn't forget anything for the regulars who were sitting next to us though), but she said nonchalantly, \\"Oh, those will be right up.\\"  And instead of going out back to check on them, she approached two people who had just sat down at the bar and gave them menus, took their drink order...and MADE their drinks.\\n\\nWhen she finally went back to get the salads, we overheard her conversation with the kitchen.  The bar is tiny, and the kitchen is right behind it with a doorway, a curtain and a counter area separating it.  It's not exactly private, and we were sitting right across from it.  We heard someone in the kitchen asking what to do with our food which was clearly ready to be served, and she said to give it another 5 minutes.  My husband has a thing about speaking up about poor service and problems with the food, so I bit my tongue.  We ate our salads, then we had to wait some more - about 10 minutes in total - for our food.  Once again the kitchen had to ask her what she wanted them to do with our food.  It was so surreal - one of those moments in comedy shows where the person says, \\"Umm, I'm sitting right here.\\"\\n\\nShe finally brought our food to us - at this point we had been siting for 45-50 minutes.  My chicken dish came with angel hair pasta (I had to ask her about the pasta choices when I ordered), and there was a madeira-style sauce.  For some strange reason, the kitchen put the chicken and pasta in two separate piles on the plate.  The chicken was covered in the madeira sauce, and they put a huge amount of red sauce on the pasta.  I didn't know what to think.  I had imagined the chicken sitting on the pasta with the madeira sauce on everything.  Instead I had dried out chicken in an overly-salty madeira sauce (probably from reducing for 20 minutes in the warming oven) with a side of luke-warm, rubbery pasta covered in red sauce.  It was gross and made no sense.\\n\\nI couldn't bite my tongue any longer, so I asked if I could please have some plain pasta  after explaining to her how I had envisioned the meal (not to mention there was no mention of red sauce on the menu).  She asked if I wanted some of the sauce from the chicken on it, and I said that would be great.  But then she told me that it would take a while because it would be made to order.  Huh?  However, she again took her time and waited on other people before going to the kitchen to put in my order for pasta.  Thankfully I didn't have to wait that long, which made the wait for our salads and meals even more infuriating.  But the pasta was freshly-prepared and delicious.  By far the best part of my meal!  My husband's fish was good but bland.\\n\\nIf we had not been using a Groupon, I would have said something to the manager and asked for a discount -   and we are people who put up with just about anything in a restaurant having worked as a waitress and a bartender.  Instead we will just never go back.  It is pretty telling when a place has to use Groupons over and over to drum up business.  We have learned our lesson."},{"name":"Olive & June","address":"3411 Glenview Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"My girlfriend had been wanting to try Olive and June for quite some time now.

All very tasty. And I would order all of them again in a heartbeat.\\n\\nFor the first visit this month, I got the Chocolate Decadence Cake - I got this last year, too. This cake wins the prize for presentation and rich OMG(!!) taste. It's a baked flourless chocolate that tastes like a truffle (yeah, it melts in your mouth ...), with a beautiful display of fruit garnish on top. I got the small cake which is 6\\" round and could feed 8-10 people if you cut small pieces -- I think small pieces are fine for this kind of cake b/c it's so heavy & rich. Cost is $21.\\n\\nFor another birthday, I got the Strawberry Shortcake which was highly recommended by the bakery. Presentation was nice & simple (not as showy as the Chocolate Decadence) and OMG delicious, too! This cake was definitely lighter than the Decadence but much sweeter than your ordinary shortcake -- that's because their yellow cake is soaked with threemilk so it's like a Tres Leches version of the strawberry shortcake. Yummo! I had gotten the small size (6\\" round) which is slightly more expensive at $24.50.

Before your meal, you are given a complimentary bowl of savory chicken broth (with bits of scallion and cilantro) in a small bowl: just enough to whet your appetite for what's to come.  The tacos de carne asada are fantastic: the steak is not overly seasoned or fatty and there is a perfect amount of chopped cilantro and onion.  And the chips and salsa-oh my, the chips!-were soooo good.  Crunchy, thick, and freshly fried, they were the ideal accompaniment to the tacos.  And  if you love fresh radishes, you get a whole container of 'em on your table.

The food was excellent so we decided to come back this weekend. Our second visit was not as awesome. Allow me to explain......\\n\\nI love to order omakasa or if they don't have it, we like chef choice sushi boats. I love to let the chef take us on a sushi tasting journey. Many people don't know this, but in true Japanese tradition, the chef will select the best cuts of fish or the most unique rolls that are rarely ordered. It's the best way to experience great sushi once you get past the vanilla rolls like California, Spider, and Tuna rolls. The only caveat, is that you must ask the price ahead of time. Sometimes you can even ask for a chef selection and give a dollar amount. It all depends on the restaurant policies.\\n\\nWe noticed that omakase was on the menu for $100 and up per person. We asked the waitress how much it would be tonight and she said exactly $100. We asked how much food would be served for such a high price and would it all be sushi (it was listed on the sushi side of the menu). She didn't know and went back to ask the chef. When she reported back to us, she said the following:\\n-The chef would choose anythng he wanted, but they would be top quality items\\n-Not all of it would be sushi\\n-The chef would take into consideration what we were drinking for matching purposes\\n-The chef would have her check in to see if we wanted it to continue, almost like all-you-can eat\\n-The chef would stop when we were full.\\n\\nDeciding to really splurge, we excitedly went for it. BIG MISTAKE!!!!\\n\\nWe received four courses before the chef cut us off. Literally, 12 peices of sashimi (premium cuts), two 4oz grilled escolar filet simmered in sake, 10 one-piece nigiri pieces, and one roadrunner roll (to split). \\n\\nThat was it.\\n\\n $200. \\n\\nYIKES!!!!\\n\\n And for dessert???? Half an orange to split. \\n\\nWhile the food was excellent, it was not worth $100 a person. I don't care which cut they gave me or if the waitress mispoke. This was unacceptable and misleading. We could have feisted for this amount by choosing our own items, premium or not.\\n\\nIf you come here, don't get the omakase, choose your favorites. The food is good, no doubt.

They were decent for New England standards though. The pork belly was too salty for my taste and the brisket was not tender and smoky. There was a huge piece of unrendered fat in one (of two) of my brisket pieces, which took up about 1/4 of the entire piece. The sides were good, not memorable. \\n\\nOne plus is the portions are big and I think you get your money's worth. The sides are much bigger than they look on the plate.

Our server was Tina, and despite the fast pace, our drinks stayed full and she was always pleasant and attentive.  Kane got the pasta deal, which I must say is very tasty and a great deal, where he orders one pasta to eat, and Maggiano's gives him another to take home.  I ordered an appetizer of jumbo lump crab cakes, and Vreeland got a fish dish, and we all had their delicious spinach dip and bread with olive oil and balsamic.  Everyone had leftover except me, which was my plan.\\n\\nMy mother-in-law ordered and asked them to leave off a gluten item and sub another in (not a gluten allergy, just as a preference), and when the food came out, the gluten was there, so we called over for someone to help. They apologized, and we go the substitution on the side, along with a direct apology from the awesome manager, Mr. Kelly Lew.  He apologized again, and said that he wanted to make sure we enjoyed our stay, so he ordered and covered a dessert platter for the table.  All complimentary, and suuuuper tasty!  We were already having a hard time deciding which o the desserts to get, and we really ended up with almost all of them in the platter.

I wasn't too hungry anyways and thought I can just graze over my friends' fries, but I didn't like that they wouldn't let me customize the only vegetarian option they have. Then one other friend stepped out of line because she found out they use peanut oil. So my peanut allergy friends beware! The rest of the group who were able to order their burger weren't happy with their meal anyways mainly because they paid more for their tiny burger compared to the burger I ended up getting at UBurger down the street. Key note, make sure your burger came with everything you ordered because one of my friends did not get her bacon until she consumed 3/4 of it.

The pu pu platter is gone, which is a HUGE loss. Even though the old pupu platter was heated Costco hors d'oeuvres, it held a solid place in the tiki vibe, & deserves a place in the menu (with quality improvements, of course). \\n\\nThe drinks are perfect. That's not a compliment. The constant measuring slows the bartenders down, when any bartender worth their salt should be able to do a 3 second pour blindfolded. It backs the bar up, and while it might save you a $1.47 a month in liquor costs, it's not worth it. Let the bartenders sling the drinks, and let the turnover maximize the profit. Granted, I haven't owned a bar for a little over 20 years, and my bar wasn't the reason I was able to retire at 30, so take my advice with a grain of salt, but opening night hiccups aside, we would've cleared our seats almost a whole hour earlier if the bar was running full steam.\\n\\nHale Pele passes muster with my my girlfriend, who is Hawaiian, but her big complaint was the loss of the pu pu platter & the volcano.

If they added entrees (swordfish or mahi mahi, for example) or played with the Polynesian theme with some sweet potato fries (my girlfriend insists they should add some poi) I'd toss on an extra star."},{"name":"Steak ‚Äôn Shake","address":"12163 S Apopka-vinland Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"2","text":"Worst Steak 'n Shake I've been too.

There was once a time when I was so disappointed in the hot pot options that we had in Austin that I lost all hope. For Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot, this place is very consistent in quality and taste (after all, it is a chain). All you can eat should be the only option since you get your money worth and try a variety of things. I've been three times within two months of trying this place. Lots of birthday celebrations here!\\n\\nAnother big perk is that it is VEGETARIAN friendly. So my fellow vegetarians, trust me and go ahead and go. Even though the online menu looks otherwise - you can choose two types of vegetarian both (tomato base and mushroom base), all kind of tofus, tofu skin (yummm) mushrooms, root, leaf vegetables, egg, and noodles galore. There's even appetizers for you - the pickled cabbage to hold you over as the broth broils.\\n\\nFor meat eaters, again the quality is consistent every time. Firstly, there is a fried chicken wing starter that comes with the all-you-can-eat. With that said, the lamb, beef, fresh beef meatballs, frozen fishballs, balls with roe, Fo Chou meatballs, etc. Eating in a group, I recommend the half and half of mild and spicy broth (although the spicy is tolerable). Unlike some mediocre places, the broth starts off hardy and gets hardier has you go. It is also not too salty but even if you drank the broth, it is not a numbing MSG potion. If you did want the numbing sensation, there's Sichuan peppers and peppercorns that you can gnaw on and get to your weird paining.\\n\\nJust a tip: one order of fresh red meat is LARGE. Order rounds appropriate so you don't waste food!\\nAnother pro tip: go earlier for dinner because they begin to run out of popular items (fishballs with roe).\\n\\nSoft Serve Ice Cream at the end so you can slow your roll."},{"name":"Sandy La","address":"5257 Victoria Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"Ok, I'm going to be honest to say I kind of want to give this place a two star.

The language barrier was a bit frustrating. The waitress was unable to tell me what was being served that evening. The 'hot' selections at the salad bar were just warm. The mussels on the salad bar looked old and uninviting. \\nI felt that unless we took large servings from the limited amount of variety offered we only got the equivalent of a 10.00 meal each. 2 people for a weekday dinner plus 3 drinks came to just over 100.00.

Metered parking is also available on the same street and is much easier to come by if you ever want to give Sweet Cheeks a try.\\n\\nWe were greeted at the door immediately and all the waitstaff seemed so sweet and kind - it was definitely comforting to feel like their welcomes were genuine.  Mason jars served as cups, utensils were in a tin can, and three bottles of different sauce adorned the table once we were seated.\\n\\nMenus are all on printed paper and seemed rather simple.  The significant other and I opted to try an order of the the famous biscuits (4 for $10), and two different trays.  A tray typically comes with a choice of BBQ meat, one side dish (you can choose either hot or cold,) as well as housemade pickles, onion, and bread.  We chose beef brisket ($12) for one tray and ribs ($14) for the other.\\n\\nWhile waiting, we decided to try the sauces - the larger sauce is their BBQ, which had a nice smokey flavor to it.  The medium sized bottle is their vinegar sauce and the smallest a spicy habenero sauce.  Warning: Use the habenero sauce in moderation, it does burn!  For sides we got to try broccoli cheese casserole and their mac and cheese.\\n\\nThe biscuits came out first : First impression?  They're friggen ginormous, almost like biscuits on steroids.  Fluffy, warm, and airy, they are made to order and are accompanied with a sweet honey butter.  Be careful when eating these, though, you will get full, and quick!\\n\\nThen they trays came out shortly after.  The ribs were my favorite of the two b options we ordered this time around. On another occasion we ordered the pork belly ($13) which I liked even better.  Everything goes great stuff their bbqs sauce, and out of the two sides we liked the broccoli casserole the best.  \\n\\nThere was plenty of food left over so we ended up packing a lot of it to go.

If you are traveling north on Roswell, the restaurant is located inside the Whole Foods shopping complex on your left.  Canton Cooks is all the way in the back.\\n\\nThe restaurant gets very busy for dinner on the weekends.  There's usually a wait.  The times I've had to wait, it's been no longer than 15 minutes.  When business is good, you're almost packed in like sardines.  If you don't have the fortune of sitting in one of the booths along the walls or at one of the large round family-style tables, you'll probably be sitting inches away from the customers at the table(s) next to you.  It can make dinner awkward since you're practically having a meal with the strangers sitting next to you.  They can hear your entire conversation and vice versa.  Of course, I bring it up because I had this happen to me once.  It was just my dad and I.  The older gentlemen sitting next to us hardly said a word to each other over the course of their entire meal.  I could tell it was because they were uncomfortable (haha).\\n\\nI've found the quality of the food at Canton Cooks to vary from time to time over the years.  I've been when it's Yelp five-star \\"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\\" and I've been when it's Yelp one-star \\"Eek! Methinks not.\\"  On average, it's closer to three or four stars.  My favorites here include the salt and pepper squid (as many here have already mentioned) and the snow pea tips in garlic sauce.  The salt and pepper squid is fried and is served with jalapenos and onions.  As the name states, it's salty and spicy (just a little bit), and very tasty.  The snow pea tips are a pretty standard Chinese vegetable which I order often at Cantonese restaurants.  The snow pea tips prepared at Canton Cooks are exceptionally good, IMO.\\n\\nTheir steamed ground pork with salted duck egg was a big fail.  We ordered this because our server recommended it.  It's a popular dish for some, but it was just downright gross to me.  Even my dad, who *loves* Cantonese food, was disappointed with it.  It was a huge plate-sized pork patty with duck egg mixed in.  Looked promising, but I think we took at most 4 bites total and then left it on the table.\\n\\nService is good.  The servers are always moving and the dishes come out fairly quickly.  Overall, I'd say this is not bad Cantonese restaurant, but the dishes can be hit or miss.\\n\\n#Yelp365 - 38/365"},{"name":"Kuhlwein'S Farm Market & Deli","address":"1859 Walker Rd","city":"Hilliard","stars":"4.5","text":"Great toasted Italian sub!!

I just knew that MCs like Lil Wayne, Young Jeezy and Soulja Boy were the best ever.  Then while riding with my dad while he's blasting the oldies station, they play Ice-Cube's \\"Today was a Good Day,\\" Slick Rick's \\"Children's Story\\" and Eric B and Rakim's \\"Eric B for President\\" in succession.

I'm a believer in good chips and salsa set the stage for the meal and they did not disappoint in the opener.  Very flavorful, slightly spicy and not too thick.  Crispy chips, fried on the premises, nice and thin yet able to withstand dipping.\\n\\nLike my above analogy, the taco enlightenment also came in threes.  I ate the beef asada, fish and chix tacos.  The flavors of the asada were comforting.  It placed my taste buds in the mind frame of a incredibly tender pot roasty feel.  The spices weren't overpowering and the gravy/sauce went nicely with the flour taco.  The fried chix taco was bountiful, tender and set off rather nicely with a generous helping of lettuce and tomatoes.  The final and my favorite was the fish.  The tilapia was seasoned just right, again very healthy portion, creamy mayo-based dressing with sauteed onions.  A very nice twist from the standard tartar sauce.\\n\\nThe tacos are HUGE, so unless you're really hungry or you want to share with the table 2 tacos is more than enough if you enjoy the chips/salsa and also get a queso.\\n\\nWhen you're ready to bob your head at an authentic taqueria, throw some PE into the CD player or blast some Big Daddy Kane on the I-Pod and head out to Taqueria Los Hermanos in Tucker..just drive towards The Light."},{"name":"Hofbrauhaus Columbus","address":"800 Goodale Blvd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Looking for authentic German food in a haubrau setting?

Tuna Poke was delicious, ribs were fantastic, Brussels sprouts were phenomenal, but the prices are fully twenty five percent above where they should be, and this is really where the problem lies when we come to the star of the show, the burger.\\n\\nNow, OH BOY do I love cheeseburgers. I have cooked them professionally, and I have enjoyed hundreds of the best burgers in the world. When I travel I typically eat the top 3 cheeseburgers in the area. There are a few things that set apart the best burgers I've ever had (the now closed original Save-On Meats lunch counter in Vancouver BC, the double at Del Taco in Baker, California) from the pack. The meat has to be hot and juicy. The brown on the meat needs to be brown and not black. The  cheese and bun need to be brought up to temp so they have better texture and don't drop the temperature of the meat. The toppings should be cold (or piping hot) and crisp. There needs to be some acidic component, mustard, pickle, vinegar in the sauce, etc. The best burgers have all these traits in common.\\n\\nAnd by these definitions the best burgers are at Bar Bar and the original Killer Burger location on Sandy Boulevard. There are many others, and some of the carts are damn good, but at those places I get a hot, juicy, cheesy, unctuous, fresh-tasting, lip-smacking burger  for around five or six bucks. My Yakuza burger, that I've heard was the best in the city, did not measure up. It was overcooked, and incredibly overpriced. I think it's the peppery / savory combo of the arugula and the cheve that has people talking. It wasn't bad, I might order it again at a lower temp for like eight or nine dollars . . . which brings us to my real complaint.\\n\\nNow, if you were to go to Yakuza's website, http://yakuzalounge.com/ right now and look at their sample menu, you'd probably think their burger was nine dollars, because that's what is says. And that's a fair price. It's tasty, not a worldbeater by any means, but it's good. But here's the dirty little secret - the Yakuza burger is actually fourteen dollars, not nine. That's a pretty big jump in price from the publicly available price and the actual price in the restaurant on the flagship menu item, don't you think?  I feel almost as if they baited me with a low priced, satisfying entree in a sea over overpriced, tiny entrees, and then switched that to a ho-hum warm burger at the exact price I was hoping to avoid. I was unsatisfied with this experience.\\n\\nI went home and ate a bowl of cereal, because I was still hungry.

I know good food, whatever style or animal (part) it's from, and I can appreciate the well-made from the not.  Sweet Cheeks was firmly in the \\"not\\" category for me.\\n\\nThe vibe is casual, and this place yearns, correction -- *aches* -- to be casual.  From the \\"cold scoop,\\" \\"hot scoop\\" thing they've got going on to their intentionally unmatched cutlery, they want to establish this real, easy-going southern flare.  That's fine (and to their credit, everyone around me in the restaurant seemed to soak it up).  The problem is, as cool and chill as it was, the food sucked.  Southern cooking may not have frills, but its got strong flavours -- real, solid TASTES.  Give me some smoky barbecue, thick peppercorn, honey glaze... anything!  Sweet Cheeks had none of that.  They describe their  menu items in the most bland, straight-off-the-animal type of way (read: casual, indifferent), but then deliver exceedingly bland food, too.  We had the pulled chicken sandwich, and a chicken tray with collard greens + a potato salad.  The chicken was moist, but it was just plain chicken.  The bread was plain white texas toast.  I could almost picture the exact Shaw's bread-bag from where they got it from.  The collard greens had some pieces of pulled pork thrown in them, and the creamy potato salad was essentially what I've had at summer work picnics for years.  There was nothing at all special.    \\n\\nHalfway through my meal after not being able to even finish the sizeable portions of chicken on my tray (ie. telling the people I was with, \\"this is getting kind of gross...\\") I thought the non-descript medicine-bottle jars of sauce would do the trick.  They didn't.  And again, by the plain-jane labeling on the bottles, it shouldn't have come as a surprise that it tasted like some sauce that I probably had stocked in the corners of my own kitchen fridge anyway.  \\n\\nThe real disappointment for me was when we brought half our meal home and reheated it the next day.  I didn't come to Sweet Cheeks as any sort of commendation to my dietitian friends, but when the little Chinese restaurant style take-out box containers were covered (and I mean *covered*) in thick pieces of congealed lard from the meat the next day, it was a little ridiculous.  What Sweet Cheeks can't (or won't?) do in terms of flavoring, they seem to add through the remarkable \\"flavoring\\" of grease.  Call it natural, organic, or whatever Mother Nature term you choose, but the saturated fat content of such absurdly prepared food just defies reason.  Did I get served some particularly fatty cuts that night?   was there an extra dousing of animal fat drizzled in for good measure?  or were the chefs just randomly hacking away?  I wondered if it was the latter after encountering some particularly unchewable, cartilaginous pieces of chicken on my tray.  Those pieces don't come from the breasts or thighs, folks!   \\n\\nI see at least 2 dozen reviews that exalt the praises of this place.  It's a fan favorite in the neighborhood.

It was a cool looking dish regardless.\\n\\nBeef Short Ribs ($11.00) - The short ribs were mildly cured before being cooked sous vide.

Safeway is to be commended to staying at this location.  Very tough site for a number of years.  And while I wish they had torn the old store down and started over again, the remodel from a few years ago definitely was an upgrade.\\n\\nThis is a comparatively small store and I prefer that to the megastores.  Just feels easier to shop.  Store is kept reasonably clean and well stocked.  Managers will order in just about any item they don't have in stock.  (I needed currants; they didn't carry but now made room for them.)  The checkers are a real step up from a few years ago.  The vast majority are both capable and friendly.  And when lines get long, as they do at all stores, I usually hear a call to open another check stand.  Greeters are friendly.  Wish there was no need for security guards, but at least most of the ones on duty now know how to communicate with shoppers and help create a pleasant entrance to the store.\\n\\nMaintenance has often been a challenge for the store.  Outside planters are once again planted with live plants, not the dead branches from just two years ago.  MLK and Ainsworth planter still needs attention.  There are some floor repairs that need to be tended to.  A well maintained store in combination with employees who focus on the customer can overcome many a complaint.  \\n\\nAll in all, it is clear that current management is stepping it up.  They want the store to be a neighborhood asset and money maker for the company.  And those are not competing goals. When the neighborhood embraces the store, it will be profitable.  I shop there frequently so that I can be part of the reason the store continues to improve.  I provide management direct, courteous feedback when in my opinion something falls short. I hope that many of the reviewers from years past are willing to give the store a chance to show them what has changed.  And if something still misses the mark, ask for the manager and provide constructive feedback!"},{"name":"Diesel Cafe","address":"257 Elm St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"I love their dark roast coffee and the baristas have always been kind.  \\n\\nI think the patrons sitting in the cafe are a bunch of fools hoping someone will post a Missed Connection about them on Craigslist."},{"name":"Saz√≥n","address":"1816 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"If I want a delicious, inexpensive whole in the wall this is where I go.

I usually like things really spicy but only order my hotness at a 4 out of 10 here. Everything is made fresh to order, which is huge for me. I can't stand reheated food. Just order your food from the friendly staff and wait for your name to be called to dig in. \\n\\nLunch for 2 is a bit pricey though, especially since there's no table service - about $35 after tip."},{"name":"Yuzu","address":"4130 SW 117th Ave, Ste H","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"I discovered this hole-in-the-wall place months ago and I absolutely love it.

I got a croque madame, which was good except they get an \\"F\\" on egg poaching. My egg was totally hard and it should be a runny yolk. Boo! Hubby got the poached egg coquette with creme fraiche and enjoyed it. Every pastry was well executed and this is definitely a place I would recommend and return to.

Olive and June's approach is (from what I was told at the restaurant) Italian fusion. The thing is, the appetizers where definitely showing refined ingredients and not necessarily Italian in origin. We tried the pork belly and  thought it needed an extra char on the surface as it had too much of the soft fat tissue. The farm egg was good but a bit bland. I actually had 2 entrees (yes, 2... I take my yelping duties seriously) which one of them was a pasta dish with Italian pork sausage...again, was good but nothing amazing or that could not be found in several smaller joints around Austin. We also tried the pumpkin ravioli and even though a bit sweet, it was pretty good. My favorite dish was the pork chop...I came in looking for original and great Italian food.

Meat was dry and since we got them to go, the tortilla was a soggy mess. Not the best combination. However, the next time we came back and tried the chicken nachos and they were on point.

I feel like maybe they've been told to keep portions exact no matter what.  I wish they'd just come out and say so one way or the other.\\n\\nAs someone mentioned, the salmon is cooked as it's ordered. I got chicken one time and salmon another time. Salmon is fantastic and goes well inside a Piada with grilled veggies, diavlo sauce and fresh veggies. The third time I visited I got the salmon again.

Strangely enough, my favorite is not their BBQ but their giant biscuit with honey butter and their fried okra.  The pork belly was greasy and didn't have that nice crisp to the skin.  The brisket was a little dry and fatty.  The short ribs have been inconsistent.  The problem is in the BBQ sauce or lack thereof.  There are 3 choices in jars on the table, none of them interesting:  traditional (fancy ketchup), Carolina vinegar, and haba√±ero. \\n\\nFor sides, I've had their black eyed peas, collar greens, mac n' cheese (ritz cracker crumbles on top), cole slaw (runny), potato salad (poorly seasoned) and carrot and raison salad (too vinegary).

There is absolutely no failure to perform policy that protects you. Make your own contract for vendors to sign. Add a stipulation about refunds.

BBQ, no less.  So last night when I decided I wanted BBQ at 8:30 at night, the boyfriend and I made sure that Sweet Cheeks was open and hopped in the car.  \\n\\nThe hostess who sat us was extremely friendly and our waitress came to welcome us and explain to us their meat and sauces within three minutes.  All their meat is Berkshire and are BBQ-ed only with a dry rub.  No sauce. The sauce is on the table for you to put on.  There are three options: BBQ (sweet), a hot sauce and a vinegar sauce.  \\n\\nI opted for the pork rib tray (1/2 slab) with the mac and cheese and the potato salad.  My boyfriend got the \\"Big Cheeks Tray\\" with pulled pork, pulled chicken and mac and cheese and the carrot and raisin salad.   \\n\\n My ribs were to die for.  The dry rub was fantastic and I only used a drop of the BBQ sauce, it really allowed me to taste the smokiness of the ribs.  They were a little salty (which I like).  The meat was lean and tender and I sucked every last bit of meat off that bone.  The Mac and cheese was served in a mug and was also amazing; creamy, cheesy, with little crunchy flakes, num.  Lastly, was the potato salad.  It was good.  It had little bacon bits on it and the potatoes themselves were good, but it was too vinegary for me.  I like my potato salad smothered in mayo.  \\n\\nMy boyfriend also very much liked his tray.  He put the BBQ sauce and some of the vinegar sauce on his meat.  Both the pulled chicken and the pork were great.  I had a bit of each and actually really liked the taste of the vinegar sauce.  He was not a fan of any of the \\"cold scoops\\", so he ordered the carrot salad just to order something but didn't even try it.  My mouth gets itchy when I eat carrots, so I didn't try it either.  \\n\\nMy only complaint was the bread.  It was just white bread as far as I could tell. I did use one of the slices to create a sandwich with the meat, pickles and onions like the waitress suggested, and the flavors together were really good.  However, I would have preferred corn bread. \\n\\nThey had a large and good selection of beers, all in whimsically named categories.  The atmosphere was fun, a little loud, but the tables and chairs and decor were wooden, homey and wonderful. \\n\\nThe ONLY reason I didn't give Sweet Cheeks a 5 star review is because the boy and I (maybe  naively) were expecting more \\"wow\\" from a two time contestant on Top Chef.  Everything was really, really good (in my opinion), but I guess we were thinking we would be blown away.  Regardless, Tiffani is doing a great job at Sweet Cheeks and I have found my new favorite BBQ joint."},{"name":"Milk Street Cafe","address":"50 Milk St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The 'salad bar in the bowl' is the best.

Overall, the food was good and we had a good time, but I feel like there are still kinks to be worked out in order for it to become my go-to place for BBQ.\\n\\nAtmosphere:  It is obvious to me that a great deal of thought went into the choices of decor, tables/chairs, and how customers would be served (on metal trays with jars to drink out of).  There is a definite point of view here, and I liked it.  The place is a little loud when it's crowded, but thankfully the music isn't cranked up to be heard over the din.  We could hear each other without yelling across the table.\\n\\nService:  There seemed to be an excessive amount of staff.  The restaurant isn't that big, and it felt like there was an army of people serving us.  In my experience, this can sometimes backfire and stuff slips through the cracks because everyone assumes someone else is taking care of it.  We had a server who was very nice but I think she was new.  She wasn't the best at explaining certain menu items.  She also didn't seem to really put much thought or care into us after (someone else) served us our dinner.  When she came over to offer to box up the remainder of my friend's dinner (she finished before me), my friend took the opportunity to order a butterscotch pudding.  I asked about the whitetrash holiday mess, and before I could decide if I wanted it, our server disappeared.  I had to flag her down to order it.  Then it took a good 20-25 minutes to get to me.  When it came time for the check, one of the hostesses (there were 3) eventually came over to take care of it.\\n\\nSide note:  There wasn't an explanation for a single thing on the menu.  Everything was listed by title only.  Most of the items are self explanatory, but there were some things, like the farm salad and whitetrash holiday mess that I had to ask about.  Also, the server had to explain the three sauces on the table to us because they weren't labeled.  This all seems silly to me, and a lot of work on the part of the servers could be avoided if the customer was given the information to read on his/her own.  Also, it wasn't until I read a response from Tiffani of another reviewer on Yelp that I really understood what \\"never ever\\" meant when it came to their beef.  I asked our server and it was clear she didn't know either when she haphazardly attempted to answer.  I do like to know when restaurants use all natural meats, and I feel better about paying a little more for real quality product.  Especially if that product is local.  However, at the time, I took a look at the prices and thought they were super high.\\n\\nThe Food:  Is good.  I ordered the two meat, two sides tray with pulled pork, brisket, mac and cheese and farm salad.  The salad was good, not overdressed and different from any other salad I've ever had.  The mac and cheese was awesome.  The only complaint I have about it is that it's served in a mug, so the ratio of creamy mac and cheese to crispy Ritz cracker-like topping is off.  I'd rather eat it in a shallower vessel so I could enjoy the topping with every bite.  The pulled pork was wonderful, lots of smokey flavor.  I tried the non vinegar, non hot sauce sauce.  I thought it was going to be sweet, but it really wasn't.  It definitely was unique and I liked it.  The brisket was a little fatty for me, but the meat was very good.  I liked the pickles on the side, though they are shaved super thin and I like mine a little thicker.  The onions I could take or leave.\\n\\nThe white bread slices really bugged me.  The concept of being able to make your own sandwich with the pickles and onions is interesting, but if I wanted a sandwich I would've ORDERED a sandwich.  Especially since the bread choices for the sandwiches are much more appealing.  I would've liked to see some cornbread or a biscuit on that tray instead.  I think it's ridiculous that the biscuits aren't free, actually.  They really should be complimentary at the beginning of the meal, and charging for them seems like a cheap move. \\n\\nThe whitetrash holiday mess was described to me as a half-baked brownie - gooey in the middle - with a peppermint marshmallow topping.  I took this to mean that the brownie would be warm.  Alas, it was not.  Maybe because it took forever to get to me.  It was also not gooey in the middle, though it did taste good.  The brownie was served in the same kind of mug as the mac and cheese, and again, same problem - the topping-to-brownie ratio.  This dessert is so close to being outstanding, but for me just missed the mark.  Too bad.\\n\\nI wish there were more choices for the \\"scoop\\" options - like getting two hots or two colds instead of one of each.  I also wish the choices for hot scoops included the appetizer options.  They sounded good!\\n\\nOverall decent, hoping the kinks work out."},{"name":"Wine 4 Oysters","address":"1957 S Alafaya Trl","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Nice quiet atmosphere, perfect for a date night.

Again since this was my second time I am not an expert yet, however, they were more than willing to add the extra noodles, therefore, I was happy. There is some seating inside.

The food here is solid, but unfortunately they either don't have air-conditioning or it was broken yesterday.  With the heat index over 100, this made our meal a little harder to enjoy.  Thankfully, our sweet waitress never let our drinks get empty.  Additionally, the food came out quickly, so we were able to eat and run back outside, where even the slight breezes were stronger than the weak ceiling fan and box fan at Chazz.\\n\\nBut our overheated experience aside, let's get to the food.  I went with the chicken plate (cooked Southern Fried Buttermilk style), which comes with two sides and a piece of cornbread.  At just under $10, this mountain of food was a bargain.  The chicken itself was a gigantic boneless breast, with a great tangy flavor from the buttermilk.  The batter was dark and crumbly with a great herb flavor.  Unfortunately, it was also very salty, so I had to pick most of it off.  Thankfully, it kept the chicken nice and moist.\\n\\nOut of my sides of collards and fried okra, the okra was on point, with a nice panko-like breading and perfectly seasoned.  The collards were just okay, but the portion was gigantic.  The cornbread was a little sweet, but incredibly dense.  I couldn't decide if it was good or not because it was just so heavy.  I think I would have loved it if it was served with a butter or syrup of some sort.\\n\\nIf I don't want to drive all the way to Busy Bee or Carver's, this is a solid substitute, but I may wait for the fall and cooler temperatures to make a repeat visit and hopefully add a star upgrade."},{"name":"Yuzu","address":"4130 SW 117th Ave, Ste H","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"I was beginning to think that Portland didn't have any good Ramen.

The bar, which I didn't sit at, was attractive and the seats had backs (a plus if I have more than one beverage).\\n\\nFood - My mother ordered the trout which was filleted at the table.  I hesitate to call it bland, but my mother loves bland food and she loved it. A good fish, if prepared well, doesn't need much in the way of sauce, but a little seasoning would have made it better for my palate.\\n\\nDrinks - I only had one drink, Lighter Shade of Pale, which was wonderful.  It was wonderfully balanced, not at all sweet and, the mark for me of a great drink, I could feel it in my head but was not overwhelmed by the slightly metallic taste of vodka. \\n\\nCons - \\nDecor - The decor is beautiful, but it is far too dark in this restaurant.  At 35, I needed a flashlight to read the menu; my mother and her friend were at a total loss as to how to read the menu.  The lighting also affected our waiters ability to properly filet.  A good many bones remained in the fish, a result,  I believe, of the lighting and not his actual skill. The bar area did seem to be more brightly lit, but I did not sit there.\\n\\nFood -I had the swordfish special at the waiter's recommendation. When I ordered it he told me it was small and I should consider ordering a side.  It seems strange that a restaurant would price and label a dish as a \\"Main\\" and then suggest that it is not really any bigger than an appetizer. However, I am not ever really concerned about small (for America) portions as long as the dish itself is well prepared and plated nicely.  The swordfish was not, however, particularly well prepared.  It wasn't bad, but in the final analysis it was a very small portion, plated without much inspiration and prepared without much finesse.  In another restaurant it would have been more acceptable, but at this price point, I just expect more. Another person in our party ordered the scallops.  She was served 4-5 somewhat sinewy scallops on a bed of fregola (a pasta that is similar in appearance to a couscous.)  \\n\\nIn sum: Atlanta is certainly not a food town, and so I set my standards accordingly; however, this place isn't worth a second visit for dinner.

The seasonal veggie bridies (basically an empanada-type thing) are also delicious for an appetizer, or as a small addition if you're planning to split an entree between two people.\\n\\nOne time, I went rogue and ordered the barley risotto with mushrooms.  That was a mistake.  It just doesn't taste like much of anything, and the mushrooms were weirdly too big (cut in huge circular pieces to look like scallops) and flavorless, with a rubbery texture.

That said, a craving is a craving, and I placed my order.  \\n\\nThe beef-lamb gyro plate came with rice pilaf, Greek-style salad, tzatziki, and hummus. I had politely declined the included pita bread. With a bottle of water, the total came to under $10. \\n\\nWhile there was a spit with meat slowly roasting away, mine came from a warming service tray, pre-sliced, and thus was a bit soggy. The flavour was a touch bland, with the sharpest notes being that of pepper and straight savoury saltiness. The meat-to-everything-else ratio was quite generous, but I would have been better served with better, more flavourful meat. \\n\\nThe tzatziki was fairly muted, with neither noticeable garlic nor cucumber, but the hummus was thin and soupy, as though it came from a can. The hummus, I couldn't finish.

The salad was fresh, which was pleasant, though, unfortunately, not enough to elevate the meal experience. \\n\\nIn terms of decor, I chuckled to myself as I pondered the absurd decorative artwork on the walls, reminiscent of those cliched corporate motivational posters, with the thick black borders, 'inspiring' photography, and single abstract noun in all capitals beneath - like 'COURAGE' or 'PERSEVERANCE.'\\n\\nSo, all-in-all, there are certainly far stronger, cheaper, more memorable (and more rationally decorated) places at which one might satisfy one's gyro cravings, but if you're stuck roaming the Fraser-and-mid-40s in absurd heat and the urge for gyros strikes, I wouldn't blame you for ducking in for a quick fix, just don't expect finesse or flair. \\n\\nIf there's a next time, perhaps I'll take my chances with that Thai chicken wrap."},{"name":"JuiceLand","address":"7329 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"My fiancee and I were visiting Austin (we're from SoCal) for the day about a week and a half ago.

This place was borderline life-changing.\\n\\nFriendly service immediately from when we walked in the door. (Really wish I could remember the cashier's name, but I don't remember.) We were staring at the menu and looking around for a while (side note: we fangirled over their wall of baseball cards). The cashier noticed we were taking our time and asked if we needed any help. So, I told her it was our first time in Austin, and therefore our first time at JuiceLand. She went through the menu and their juice/smoothie supplements with us, even giving us a poster detailing all of their supplements (ours to keep, still have it) and a to-go menu (ours to keep, still have it as well).\\n\\nFinally, we ordered. She got the Ta Tonka and I got the Percolator, with added peanut butter. Both were absolute blended perfection (agave water in the Ta Tonka was divine, and cold-brew coffee in an organic smoothie, the Percolator, is about is Austin as it could get for me).\\n\\nStill, the cashier noticed we were a bit run down as far as energy goes (our red-eye flight in had left us dead tired, and we hadn't slept all day). So she informs us of their selection of shots, which we were looking at earlier, and proceeds to bring us two FREE shots (these \\"shot cups\\" were like the Big Gulp of all shot cups) of yerba mate, which was their most highly-caffeinated shot on the menu. Complementary, no money, no questions asked. Did it as a favor to us. Not only did that get us both HOOKED on yerba mate, it cemented this place as the friendliest restaurant of ANY kind--juice bar or otherwise--that we'd ever been to.\\n\\nJuiceLand, you made fans of us.

They will forget things you've ordered. You have to keep reminding them. They will also make mistakes.

Just say \\"no thanks\\" that's totally acceptable in this type of restaurant. Say \\"yes\\" only to the cuts you like the most. My favourites are \\"Picanha\\", \\"Maminha\\" and ribs.\\n\\nThey offer a wider selection of cuts for dinner, but it's double the price, and, honestly, what really matters for me is the \\"Picanha\\" which is always available for lunch. So, my advice is: go during lunch time and prefer less busy days such as mid-weekday.

You can drink at any Old Chiago's and it counts. I thought that was pretty sweet. It makes you try new things and win a challenge that anyone can really win. But remember, your not doing this in one night, if you do, that is a challenge you certainly may fail. \\n\\nThe food is pretty good, however they have recently changed their menu and it has less things on it then the old menu. The old menu was everyone's favorite. My father was not very pleased when they did this, but he still goes there for the beer and service. Danika (spelling may be wrong) was the one working while I was there is last time and she is delightful. She is super sweet and always notices when your drink is low so she can get you a new one. Good job Danika, sorry if I spelled your name wrong! \\n\\nThe Sicilian pepperoni rolls on the appetizer section are pretty dang tasty. Lots of pepperoni flavor all up in your mouth gracing your taste buds.

A waitress was bringing one of the tables a beer. She did not acknowledge us as she walked away from the other table, but I figured another server would be around shortly. I must add the restaurant had very few other tables seated at the time. My wife saw the server sit down in front of a computer and shortly thereafter two others joined her and began having a conversation. We still had not received drinks or even a menu to peruse. As we were sitting two other groups walked in at which point we decided to leave after 13 minutes of waiting without any acknowledgement from the staff. We went to the Winking Lizard instead and are not planning on returning to the Harry Buffalo again. \\n  The main reason we decided to go there today was to try the new menu as their previous menu revision left much to be desired. I guess we will not if they'd made any improvements due to the complete lack of service. One of the main reasons we went there in the past was because their fries were amazing but they changed those from nicely seasoned straight cut fries to nasty, chewy and often times cold waffle fries.

I went in this evening for dinner with my boyfriend and we were both extremely excited since we both are BBQ entusiasts. We have been everywhere for real southern BBQ and we finally found a place that does it just right. Exactly right.\\nSince we both have big appetites, we started with the hush puppies AND the biscuits. The hush puppies were cooked perfectly with a moist center of corn bread that melted in your mouth. The maple sour cream dipping sauce that accompanied them was the perfect addition of sweetness. They were amazing. Now for the biscuits, well, they speak for themselves. The best fluffiest biscuits my boyfriend and I have ever had before. The honey butter was phenomenal and I seriously would go back just for these. We even took some home for breakfast in the morning. I suggest you do the same.\\nFor the main event, we ordered pulled chicken sandwiches accompanied with the farm salad, broccoli casserole, and the mac and cheese. The pulled chicken was smoked and cooked to perfection and the sauces on the table gave the best varieties of tastes that anyone would enjoy. The North Carolina sauce was tangy and sweet and so good that I almost asked to purchase a bottle of it for home cooking. The BBQ sauce was bold and rich and was a perfect taste for the hearty side of me. Both were delicious.\\nThe farm salad I could eat every day for lunch. The juicyness of the grapes and the crunch from the walnuts gave you exactly what you need and want out of a salad. Both the broccoli casserole and the mac and cheese were amazing and a perfect addition to mine and my boyfriends meals. I dont think I could ever pick between the two of them and will always order both.\\nNot only was the food perfect and exactly what we were both looking for, but the atmosphere is completely fun and entertaining, and the service from the host stand to the waiter and even the manager, who helped served dishes and checked on customers and their dinner choices, was superb. Nothing but friendly, inviting and fun, yet professional the entire time. I will always return to Sweet Cheeks Q and completely happy that I was satisfied throughout the entire evening. It's hard to find places that I would give 5 stars to in all areas of my dining experience.\\nRedbones what? Sweet Cheeks Q will always pull my meat. I'll be back time and time again."},{"name":"Copious","address":"520 S High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Special night out for us and wanted to try someplace new.

But it is something I plan on doing after Easter.\\n\\n[history]\\nEstablished December of 2003, power couple - Dominique and Stephanie, opened St. Honore Boulangerie (a cafe/bakery named after one of France's patron saint bakers).

In France, people purchase baked bread and patisseries in the market on a daily basis. At St. Honore Boulangerie, they want to invite that culture into downtown Portland.

This is the first Num Pang in the Boston area (via NYC), and I thought the food here was fantastic! If you like Vietnamese sandwiches, definitely try it. I THINK the closest places you can get these babies are in Chinatown -- not sure of any other such places in the Back Bay/Pru area. Num Pang's sandwiches are more upscale (and more costly) than the ones in Chinatown, but that's to be expected, and the difference is worth it IMHO. And it's nice to see something a little different -- distinctive -- in the mall.\\n\\nHot & Sour Chicken & Rice Soup was surprisingly filling and had a great kick to it -- just the right amount of spice with plenty of flavor. The little container of croutons was a really nice touch. It's not like Chinese hot & sour soup (which is a must-have whenever I eat Chinese food). I'd recommend this.\\n\\nGinger BBQ Brisket Sandwich was super tasty. The brisket was tender and not at all too fatty (a pet peeve -- brisket with too much fat). I'd get this again.\\n\\nTHE highlight was ... the Lobster & Pork Belly Sandwich (a short-term special, I'm told -- only for a few more weeks). This was the sandwich of my dreams -- a spectacular combo. I usually dislike pork belly (too fatty for me, in general), but this sandwich hit it way out of the ballpark -- really flavorful filling on nice crunchy bread with lotsa lobstah.\\n\\nGrilled Corn With Coconut and Lime (side dish) is another must-have. I can see developing an addiction to this. Don't be embarrassed if anyone sees you licking the sauce off the tin foil wrapper. They'll do it too, if they order this.\\n\\nCambodian Slaw (side) was the only thing I had that didn't thrill me. It was too spicy, had too much cilantro (this from a guy who loves cilantro), and it lacked any other distinctive flavor. Keeping in mind that this was their first day open, I'd want to try this again just to see if this is really how it's supposed to taste. [If you ever ate the Asian Slaw at the long-gone Uncle Pete's BBQ in East Boston and then Revere, you know what an unattainably high bar that set for this sort of dish.]\\n\\nCambodian Iced Coffee (seasonal beverage) will probably keep me up all night but had just the right amount of sweetness.\\n\\nKhmer Sausage (seasonal sandwich) is something that unfortunately didn't catch my eye until just before I left, so I didn't have a chance to try it. It is #1 on my \\"next time\\" list -- it'll be this sandwich, a side of Coconut/Lime Grilled Corn, and a small Hot & Sour Chicken & Rice Soup next time.\\n\\nThe staff was super friendly/helpful/professional, too, and the food came out quickly.\\n\\nHopefully the high-quality food and service will continue once the place gets better known and more crowded.

While advertised as house marinated, it seemed to be artificially colored (which I don't like and will avoid buying in stores). If it wasn't artificially colored, one wonders which ingredient results in this coloring. Nevertheless, the roe seemed firm and fresh (both taste and smell) and lightly spicy (I prefer a little more robustness of spice but it was sufficiently acceptable). It was tasty and flavorful although it would have been much better served with a little white rice and shiso. I'll have to check if they offer a mentaiko onigiri next time.\\n\\nI also tried the renkon hasamiage -- sliced renkon (lotus root) with shrimp paste that has been deep fried. Tasty and as expected; one of my favorite, go-to appetizers -- if an izakaya offers it, I'll usually order it.\\n\\nFinally, I had the kakuni ramen. The tonkotsu broth, the accompaniments, the stewed pork (which is melt in your mouth tender and slightly sweet -- excellent) and the chashu were all excellent. It's been a long time since I've had ramen and this hit the spot. The oddity, ironically, was the noodles. The noodles didn't look or taste like typical ramen noodles, fresh or pre-prepared. Perhaps it's a style of noodle from their particular area of Japan. But the noodles were straight and round - more like a thick somen.It was okay but different -- for ramen, I prefer the squiggly, flat edged noodles as it tends to capture broth better while slurping.\\n\\nOne small note -- while the shochu list is a little sparse (and unfortunately, partial to non-rice ones), the sake menu is not too bad and there are some nice ones from Niigata and other places.\\n\\nOverall, a good positive experience and I'm looking forward to going again someday and trying many of their other dishes.

Who jeopardizes their customers' well-being just to save a couple bucks' worth of ingredients?\\n\\nThe cake proper did seem unaffected. We took out the top layer just to be on the safe side and had a taste (we were hungry, you see). It was standard southeast-Asian bakery fare, that is, an incompetent regurgitation of old-school French patisserie, heavier on sugar and skimpy on butter. In the industrial-bakery realm, Meianna ranks (way) below Costco (whose cakes are actually surprisingly edible) and down there with, say, Freddie's. Another Yelp reviewer states that they have \\"tasty mouse cakes, with just the right amount of sweetness\\". As much as I'd love to see those, I recommend staying away from this place."},{"name":"Library Square","address":"300 W Georgia St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"Library Square Public is located downtown Vancouver, which is two blocks from Rogers Arena and BC Place, and across the street from the Queen Elizabeth Theatre. The location is outside the library, is very easy to find, but it's hard to park the car.\\n\\nI have been to Vancouver Public Library a lot, but I have never been to this place since this year my birthday. My fiance had dinner with the meetup group once and he brought me some leftover chicken wings, which was awesome. So, we decided to have my pre-birthday dinner there with friends.\\n\\nEnvironment: Since it was Wednesday night (Wings Night), we made a reservation before we came. 6 people for 6pm. We arrived on time. This place was not too busy. Inside the Library is like normal bars. Dark inside, Big screen TV, Calm inside, perfect conditions for me.\\n\\nService: since it's a little bit busy, we had to wait for a while to begin the order. The server is nice and friendly. I don't think they have many servers working that night. Every time we wanted something, we had to wait for a while.\\n\\nFood: Because of Wings night, we all ordered Wings special. Actually, this place had horrible Wings selection. There are only three flavors for Chicken Wings: Salt peppers, Sweet Chili and Hot. If you don't like spicy, your only option is Salt Peppers. We ordered all three to share. The chicken wings came out of the kitchen for a while, but they are well cooked, well seasoning and fresh hot. The most important thing is they are all very big, bigger than many other pubs or bars downtown Vancouver, which is awesome. After ate the first round chicken wings, my friends decided to order some french fries. We ordered regular fries and jalapeno cheese fries. The taste of fries is awesome, especially the jalapeno cheese fries.\\n\\nPrices: Even though it's wings special, this place still charge Chicken wings like $6 or $7. The fries are the same. It's very pricy. The taste was great. It's more important.\\n\\nIn summary, it's not bad. We enjoyed our wings night at Library Square.

Beyond this, the spinach to pesto ratio was off each time, what was once an irresistible opus of flavor in the center became too much cold spinach 2/3 times,with barely any cheese, and on my final visit too much room temp pesto. The condition of the establishment was progressively worse each time:stained walls, filthy microwave in which the worker heated my selection for ten seconds, lack of changing gloves with him working the register and making my bagel. Unacceptable."},{"name":"The Lobster Stop","address":"723 Washington St","city":"Quincy","stars":"4","text":"Good place to try if you are in the area.

It's not good to leave a restaurant when your belly feels like crap and there is nothing you can do to hurry the process along. Had to tell the story. Walked in with my 91 year old dad, we only waited 20 minutes and it was busy. Cool. We sat in nice rocking chairs and looked at the limited menu.When we were seated our order was taken right away.  We both ordered brisket, he the sandwich, me the plate. \\n\\nI had a really good view of the kitchen where I could see people moving quickly looking like they were really working hard. So I watched and then I watched some more. At the 20 minute mark I noticed that not one dish of food came out. I asked the hostess, she had someone check on our order and the report came back, we are up next, kitchen is short staffed. \\n\\nAt the 30 minute mark an appetizer went by us and then a very large \\"to go\\" order went by .Drinks were being served everywhere but no other food. Our waitress never appeared.  At the 35 minute mark I asked for the manager. He said the kitchen is very busy with many orders to fill, Well, yeah, every seat was taken, is this the first time? He told us our order is coming right out, and it did. 40 minutes for food that is not cooked to order. Duh.\\n\\nI wish I was warned. The brisket was not just fatty, it was at least 50% fat that could not all be cut away. I had never seen so much marbleized fat on brisket before. It was tasty but hit my stomach like lead. Left most of it behind. The sides were nice. Baked beans, Farmer salad but I did not go there for the nice sides. Our waitress finally appeared to clear things away so I asked if the brisket was always this fatty. \\"Well it varies but pretty much so\\".  I noticed in another review that the chef says brisket is supposed to be fatty. I never heard that rule, I grew up on it. Live and learn.\\n\\nAs we walked out the door we encountered 2 ladies shaking their heads. Evidently, while we were eating, a sign was put up on the door that as of 7pm the restaurant would be closed for a private party. And they had driven from Framingham. I wonder, was there really a party coming in or just trouble in the kitchen? It did not look like the existing patrons were clearing out any too soon.\\n\\nSo I am home, uncomfortable, after eating comfort food with a higher than average price point. Not for me."},{"name":"Josie's Pizza & Wings","address":"1225 S Hiawassee Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This is my favorite pizza place. Hands down.

I ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes because on a previous visit, my neighbor ordered this dish and when it arrived, the tomato slices were plump and looked perfectly breaded and fried with a generous portion of little shrimp.  I couldn't wait to try!  When ours arrive, they were super-thin slices and the breading had fallen away in many places.  They looked and tasted like they may have been prepared yesterday or the day before and the shrimp, what there were of them, had been chopped into tiny pieces.  It was a zero.\\nMy guest ordered the Porchetta Sandwich which I'd had on my last visit. Mine was wonderful. The bread was lightly toasted.  This time, the bread was over-toasted and HARD making it impossible to eat as a sandwich. \\nI ordered the Caesar Salad.   This was not a salad, let alone a $9.00 salad. A stingy amount romaine were sprinkled across the plate (as a chef, I wouldn't have let this leave the kitchen).  I found pieces of 'old', rusty-edged romaine in the mix.  Two little white sardines were draped across the romaine and there were a few VERY HARD croutons.  I could have broken a tooth on one of those croutons!  It was not a full Caesar salad.  And the dressing was extremely salty and did not have the flavor of a Caesar dressing.  \\nService, on the other hand, was excellent.  Our server checked in with us and even took the time to take a photo of us. \\nThe back-of-house was a a big disappointment.  It was as though the chef didn't 'show up' even though he may have physically been in the kitchen.  \\nThe first visit was good, probably would have given it 4 stars.

I am not going to knock it for that though, it's limited menu and posh interior fits the mode its type, but don't expect a cozy space. \\n\\nI love the interior of this new spot, fashioned to call-back the spaces original purpose. The entrance opens to a hallway nicely dressed with flagons and other upscale designs. The dining room is darker, with original red brick walls, posh black tables, and a cool magnet shaped bar that sit in the cut of the former theatre's gradient. At the base of the slope is a white lit kitchen alluding to the screen that once hung there. In cavities insets, where once movie posters hung, are impressionist oil painting of classic theatres. They have a projector casting movies on brick; they had a Three Stooges film on mute.  Although Edison bulbs are becoming cliche, their bronze sizzles color the space in a film noir cast. \\n\\nThe servers here are well dressed and attentive. No complaints here, although we were only one of two parties Sunday afternoon, so the staff wasn't busy. Our sever was friendly, helped with the menu, and was timely. \\n\\nFood, I'll start with a couple negatives. The water, poured out in a glass bottle, was warm and they didn't serve ice. My ice tea was pretty watered down, and this didn't change after multiple servings. So they have some things to adjust. \\n\\nFor positives I liked the pulled chicken sandwich I selected. It didn't blow me away, but for $10 it did exceed my expectation. The chicken was nice and tender with a juicy sauce. The cole salad topping was generously added, tangy, and fresh.

Sandwiches are not created equal here and that's a fail. Inconsistent food is unacceptable as far as I'm concerned. I met up a group of friends for lunch and we ordered the same sandwich but at different times. My friends ordered a little earlier and received their shaved Kobe beef sandwiches first. Their sandwiches looked awesome, and I couldn't wait to get mine. Well I was severely disappointed when mine finally came out. It looked nothing like my friends' sandwiches. The meat was brown and there was about half the amount of meat on mine (see the photo I posted if you think I'm exaggerating). I seriously thought that they brought me the wrong sandwich. I asked the server if my sandwich was the same as my friends'. Her reply was \\"yeah, it looks a little over done... did you ask for that?\\" I told I didn't and she reluctantly asked if I wanted to send it back. I thought about it for a second but decided it wasn't worth the risk if getting it more over done with even less meat. It seems pretty clear to me what happened: they were running out of meat and served me whatever scraps they had left. Another friend ordered the same sandwich at the sane time as me and his looked just as bad as mine. That's ridiculous - you shouldn't put out an inferior product especially when it's so obvious before the first bite is even taken. They should have come up to me to apologize that they were out of meat and offer me an alternative. I wouldn't have been happy but at least I would have understood. I certainly wouldn't be writing such a negative review. \\n\\nIn addition to the sandwich fiasco, the cashier gave us attitude which I didn't care for. We originally wanted the shrimp po boy but the cashier said \\"we're out of that... You can just order something else... it will be just as good.\\" No apology, no suggestions, just attitude. He also didn't ask for our drink order and seemed annoyed when we asked if we could have some water. And another thing, the server took another friends plate away before she was finished, leaving her quite sad. Overall the food was decent but it definitely isn't worth the price.

No myriad of items to select from as toppings and add-ins to your poke; Appa found a great mix of flavors and textures and packaged it into their signature bowl- if you don't like something in it, then request they omit it. Less is more, and Appa's does that excellent. Other than the poke bowls and sushirittos, they also have some tasty Korean lunch boxes and some not so great sushi rolls (rice was clumpy and bland, and the proportion of rice to fish was 4:1). Of the three poke places I've tried in Atlanta, Appa's wins by miles in terms of flavor, consistency, simplicity, and overall execution. Compared to other poke I've had (other than Hawaii), it may not have the higher quality ingredients that you'll find at places like Thunder guys in NYC or the sea of poke places on the west coast, but Appa's has an amazing philosophy that I didn't find other cities, and I hope that, as Atlanta's poke craze (it's been less than a year since the first official spot opened) grows, Appa's continues to improve and introduce higher quality cuts (would gladly pay $5-10 more for good quality tuna) and that others embrace their simpler philosophies and get rid of all the huss and fuss that hectic cities like LA and NYC have injected into poke and remember that at its roots, it should be something fresh, clean, simple, and filling for you to enjoy near the beach."},{"name":"The House Of Banh Mi","address":"511 NE 76th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Affordable, nutritious, and delicious! \\nMy favorite bahn mi in town! \\nI usually get a tofu bahn mi, it comes with all the fixings. \\nGreat for a quick stop on the go, casual and approachable.

I know its a week late but I feel it needs to be said. Also this review was created by my girlfriend and sent to the manager of the restaurant to which we have not received a reply of an apology or anything of that nature.\\n \\n\\"My boyfriend and I celebrated Valentine's Dinner at your restaurant last night and I wanted to share our experience.\\nWe had a reservation at 8:30pm which we then asked to move to 10pm which was accommodated then we showed up at 9:30pm and was still seated promptly.  Grade (1 to 10): 10 being the best! Especially being on a busy dinner holiday!\\n \\nOur ticket says our Waiter was Severo. He delivered our menus without a greeting/welcome. Upon pouring our water next, he did say Happy Valentine's Day and left. Asked for our wine selections - vary matter-of-factly. No offer of advise/conversation just dull 'what do you want'. We made our selections, he left. He returned with bread and our wine and asked 'Are you ready to order?'. So I tried to engage him and asked if he could explain the menu and highlight his recommendation or the most favorite dish. He literally paused bored-ly and said 'well we are selling a lot of this'. Nothing further. I continued to ask him several questions ... \\"are the bay scallops good?\\" ... yes. \\"What about the roasted duck?\\" ... Yes. Again nothing further. Now we selected this restaurant based on being one of the great French restaurants in Atlanta. We were hoping to fully get an experience that showed the romanticism/level of detail of the French cuisine.  At minimum, would have loved to have the ingredients explained - tell us about the dishes how they are prepared why certain foods are paired together. We should be so torn that every dish offered sounds amazing that we must return again to try the other dishes. Again, we received none of this. Not sure how many words the he even spoke to us. We blindly made our selections. We even asked him to pronounce our dish names in proper French which he said one word only of them. Again - just took the fun, excitement, culture right out of our dinner. We had to ask for more bread and our candle was out most of our dinner. At the end, I noted that all the other women/dates was offered a long stem rose as they were paying. I was not offered this and only upon leaving and at the door, did  a hostess offer me one. My boyfriend and I are an interracial couple and could not help but wonder if we were being treated differently? Other table receive far more attention and these little details were not over looked. Server Grade (1 to 10): 2 The person that brings out the food was actually more enthusiastic and polite in the two seconds we saw him than our Waiter.\\n \\nNow for the food - the saving grace of our entire night - was amazing! It was so delicious. Right at the expectations of a what dinner at the #1 French restaurant in Atlanta should taste like. Grade (1 to 10): 45!!! Again, we knew very little about what we ate (what was in complex sauces, where the ingredients where from, cooking methods used) but is was superior in taste, presentation and quality!\\n \\nOverall, that is what we are taking away from our dining experience. Amazing chef, very accommodating and attentive hostess not very good service. And actually for the price level and restaurant rating that Atmosphere carries, very poor service.\\nThank you for listening. \\""},{"name":"Gonzo Juice","address":"1104 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great, friendly service....

Walking in, immediately I knew the restaurant needs an update. The place looks old and requires some touch ups and cleaning. It had a weird smell in which I eventually got used too, however this may be a turn off for lots of people. I would not recommend this place as a date meeting to impress a special someone.

And even more than that, the food ranges from very good to superlative, with an average of excellent.  I found their Scotch egg to be a nice snack, but didn't knock my socks off.  But pretty much everything else I've had there has been amazing.  Their truffle-honey mashed rutabaga is spectacular, and their stilton mashed potatoes are scrumptious.  Yet they can even pull off subtle dishes like their scrumptious trout over potato salad with grilled asparagus.  I ravaged the entire thing and even felt great afterwards.  Then the dedication to Scottish brews is fantastic.  I didn't realize there were so many Scottish beers and ciders that were so stellar.  Last time there, I tried their Crabbie's (alcoholic) ginger beer, and it's fantastic and refreshing.  Like a \\"Dark and Stormy\\" in a bottle, only smoother.

This trip we had the calamari, it's great on it's own, light crispy, not greasy breading... but the thing that puts it over the top is the smoked tomato saltsa served with it.  We also had the oak fired pork tenderloin, which is fire seared to beautiful crust on the outside and a perfect medium on the outside... this comes with a zucchini corn cake that's just the right amount of sweet and perfectly moist.   The whole roasted fish and lamb shank are also note-worthy options on the menu.  The price is typical of Disney and celebrity chef owned places, but it's very much worth the price.

I usually go to the Clintonville location but Easton and Short North are also 5 star worthy. \\n\\nParking can be tricky on weekend nights even with the lot in the back. You order at the counter, get your own tea or soft drink (other drinks are made for you), find a seat and they bring your food to your table. I find this makes service here a bit faster than other popular restaurants. And while you wait they have a selection magazines to peruse. They will occasionally swing by the check on you but usually I get up to ask for a box for leftovers. \\n\\nThe food is always stellar. The cheeseburger is moan-worthy, but I almost always get the basil burrito. My kids love the pizzas, which are pretty tasty but not something I'd order myself. The chopped salad is really good too, a pleasant combination of sweet and savory flavors. The sandwiches are always great because their bread is to die for. I'm surprised their bread doesn't get talked about more, it is REALLY good. But the crowning glory in my opinion are the cookies. The peanut butter cookie is a religious experience.

If you're like me and not a Texan, go without the Wonder Bread and ask for their sumptuous biscuits instead. They are award winning. So I had to inquire about what was the dillio with the Wonder Bread so I asked  managing partner Brian Lesser who I had come to know from when he opened Saint and then Mini Bar. He said in the true spirit of Texas Barbeque, they serve the two slices of Wonder Bread because the Texas peeps like to make a sandwich by adding a little bit of their main course and their sides. I would have no part of this as this Yankee snob eats whole wheat bread and not that terrible white bread ;-) I had their half a chicken with farm fresh salad and mac and cheese. While I was counting the calories from the Mac and Cheese, which was off the charts delicious, I was salivating from the wonderful tastes of everything. Sweet Cheeks also has a boat load of beers from all ovah (had to toss in my Boston accent here) the US and the globe.

Came with a pickle and a bag of chips! I think the women said my fish sandwich came with chips too but I only got one with my lobster roll. I think she thought since it was all for me I wouldn't need two bags lol but I wanted the other so bad  that was my fat girl inside me talking. lol!

Would they be able to keep the intimate feel from their previous location (currently home to Harvest Clintonville), and would the expansion be good for business? Looks like the answer to both of those questions is yes. Partitioning the large space into a flowing set of rooms, one can have dinner, stop in for dessert, attend a music event, or hold a reception at Mozart's. The bright display of pastries, cakes and cookies remains temptingly near the entry, which is at once comfortable and open.\\n\\nMozart's serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. Definitely order a breakfast croissant for melt-in-your-mouth savory flavor. They have many options, from sandwiches to breakfast platters. Lunch and dinner options are varied, but once again, a suggestion - the weiner schnitzel is wonderful, as is their salmon salad.\\n\\nSave room, though - you can't talk of Mozart's without talking about their sweets. First off, they have the BEST ice cream in town. Sorry, Jeni's; sorry, y'all - but it's true. Vienna Ice Caf√© is the best. Second, cakes are their specialty and it shows. From almond-based to triple-chocolate Sonata to strawberry champagne, there is a cake that will become your favorite. Also - marzipan of various kinds. Cookies, plunders, croissants, cr√®me horns - you can find something to satisfy your sweet tooth. Their coffee is great as well, blended espresso drinks and coffee floats.\\n\\nThe Saha's are truly part of the Clintonville community. They give generously to the Clintonville Community Resource Center, and during the polar vortex of 2013-14, they opened up their banquet space for several days so kids and families could come in and have a day-off day-out, complete with hot chocolate and cookies. Every year on Mozart's birthday, they have a celebratory open house with proceeds going to the CRC. Looks like Mozart's is here to stay for a long time."},{"name":"Taboon Bistro","address":"5911 Turkey Lake Rd, Ste 102","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Excellent mediterranean food, perfectly prepared.

Over the next fifteen years, five more locations opened in the Washington, DC area. Less than ten years later, there are over 450 locations across the country. There are two in Austin: one in the Arboretum (where the Sharper Image used to be before its demise) and one in north campus.\\n\\nFive Guys prides itself on serving fresh, never frozen, beef and toppings, as there are no freezers. Another thing you will notice as soon as you walk in the door are the peanuts. There are boxes of peanuts throughout the dining room. These make for a tasty snack before and after your meal.\\n\\nThere are two sizes for the hamburger: the regular \\"Hamburger\\" has two patties and the \\"Little Hamburger\\" has one. Each patty is slightly less than 1/4 pound, so the Hamburger is between 1/3 and 1/2 pound. Every burger at Five Guys is cooked well done, but the patties remain very juicy. When I unwrapped my burger, it was suitably nice and greasy.\\n\\nOne thing I did not like about my burger was its assembly. It appeared to be very haphazardly put together and required me to take it nearly completely apart to put it back together. The photograph here was after I re-stacked my burger. I anticipated getting my fingers nice and greasy anyway, but putting the burger together made things even messier.\\n\\nThe most impressive thing about the Five Guys burger was the freshness and variety of toppings. Also, other than cheese and bacon, all of the toppings and condiments were included with the cost of the burger. I ordered my burger \\"with everything.\\" This included a small leaf of green leaf lettuce, several large slices of tomato, a bunch of thick pickle slices, grilled onions and mushrooms, ketchup, mustard, AND mayonnaise. All of the toppings were very fresh and their flavors came through even though there were so many toppings. I felt having all three condiments was a bit much as they soaked through the bun. In the future, I would stick with the one you like best (ketchup, mustard, or mayonnaise). Speaking of the sesame seed bun, it was relatively unremarkable compared to the rest of the burger, and it seemed undersized for the two patties it attempted to contain.\\n\\nA regular order of fries is probably enough for two people. Ignore the sizes that you see on the menu board. My fry cup was completely full of fries and contained probably only half of all my fries. The rest had overflowed and spilled out into my bag. I tried the Cajun variety and found them to be extremely over-seasoned. I tried some of the regular \\"Five Guys Style\\" and found those to be very crispy and tasty. I would only go with Cajun if you really love Cajun seasoning.\\n\\nCross-posted on my blog: Burger Austin - The Best Burgers in Austin\\nhttp://www.burgeraustin.com/2010/02/five-guys-hamburger.html"},{"name":"Brigham & Women's Hospital - Cafeteria","address":"75 Francis St","city":"Boston","stars":"2","text":"Now accepts Visa and MasterCard.\\n\\nOther than that, nothing to see here, people.

The beef roll was also a hit which Everyone at the table enjoyed. We also had panfried beef buns, potstickers and cabbage with pork noodle soup; all were good and worth having again.

Ordered through grubhub and got the pulled pork sandwich, brisket sandwich, and baby backs. I've eaten a ton of bbq in my life but this was the worst bbq I've ever had. It honestly blew my mind that they spent all that money building and prepping and this is the product. I've been so excited after watching them build the business and to see new things popping up around Tigard for food options. For starters the sauce had a horrible aftertaste almost like it was old and expired. The brisket was sliced with the grain instead of across the grain and it was just odd tasting. The pulled pork was moist but the taste was just ok. Pulled pork is easy to make. The ribs were perfectly cooked but the rub or smoke was so strong and off putting. And without a descent sauce to mask the taste. The Mac and cheese was just dry noodles with cheese taste. Literally no sauce. The beans were so dry and tasteless with a ton of dried up pieces of bacon. I honestly can't believe this is the product for 42 bucks. Yuck.  I read other reviews and either their friends or I just got the long day dried up leftovers on a Sunday night."},{"name":"Stauf's Coffee Roasters","address":"1277 Grandview Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Stopped in here twice today.

Not really sure how to grade something I'm used to but taste so different from it. Maybe the whole \\"extreme\\" thing is the reason why it taste different. Anyway, it tastes pretty band to me. Asked for a spring roll, got a fried roll. Funny thing is I expected a spring roll to be vermicelli noodles with shrimp and veggies, instead I got fried roll with veggies in it. I called over the waiter who blatantly rolled his eyes at me when I asked if they were spring rolls. He vehemently said yes but funny thing is that the other person who took our order asked if I wanted spring rolls or fried rolls. Obviously, I would assume that a fried roll served to me is a fried roll and a spring roll is what I was used to back home. Proceeded to eat that anyway which was bland and I asked for peanut sauce originally and having to bring me one because the original order taker forgot was probably the main reason he dislocated his eyes out of its sockets. Then we asked for water for all 4 of us and gave us 4 glasses 1/2 filled with water. Okayyy. Thanks. I think the lack of taste made us less thirsty so you don't have to serve us that much water. When we needed boxes for the bland food we're taking home to put some salt on, we asked for 2 to go boxes and 1 sauce cup. Obviously, practically all 3 rolls were untouched so why would we only need 1 sauce cup. The server proceeded to come back and gave us the boxes the 2nd time around with an unamused demeanor.

Note: WE WERE THE ONLY PEOPLE IN THE RESTAURANT FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE EVENING. For our main course I got the chicken. It was dry and bland. The artichoke tasted like pure vinegar. My husband said the pork chop was good, not great. And the truffle Mac and Cheese was pretty good but not worth the pain of the rest of the food. Our waiter was obviously more than ready to clock out and leave. He barely checked on us... note again that there were a few other tables (I think 3 at the most) at the beginning, then only us for some time, then one other table which was not in his section during our time here. Our bill was over $100 and I think it was a total waste of money. I'm so disappointed in the service, the food, and the fact that we wasted money eating here.

For appetizers we had the Gnuddi Fritti (amazing) and, unfortunately, the Misto Plate. I wanted the mussels but they were out. The Misto Plate was two deli meats and cheeses slapped on a plate with some lackluster ciabatta. Literally, they served provolone on their meat and cheese board. The waitress was nice enough to give us half off for an unknown reason (maybe she could tell we didn't like it) but she left the plate on our very small table for the entire meal, even when we said we were finished with it. For main course I had the scallop carbonara and my sister had the shrimp pomodoro. We both admitted to only wanting the seafood parts of each of our meals...I wish they offered a classic seared scallop entree on its own - the scallops were tasty. The worst part of the dinner is that our waitress didn't ask if we wanted dessert or anything else before she plopped the check down on our table. Cute atmosphere and interior, decent food, bad service. I probably won't return."},{"name":"South End Open Market","address":"375 Harrison Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"What a cute way to spend your sundays!

But before I arrived I called to place the order and asked specifically if he was near Malden station aka orange line. He said yeah yeah yeah took my order n arrived. Strike one; not the place I thought it was. But I still Paid for my meal, asked if there's garlic bread he said yes. Ok .. I go to one of the tables to dine in. And open the bag to see two hard as a rock triangles of this \\"homemade bread\\" which was honestly stale n old tasted moldy as well. So strike two; no garlic Bread given but this moldy bread. I look past it got for my Alfredo which is packed in tuberware wrapped in plastic n because the container was hot the plastic was melting smh smelt horrible. Like unwrapping one of those horrible school lunches that tasted like plastic because it was wrapped in it. Strike 3, for the plastic. I open the Alfredo it's like 3 maybe 4 large chunks of chicken on top of spiral macaroni. -.-\\" since when is chicken broccoli ziti served with macaroni .. Strike 4. I cut up the chicken looking past these former strikes I go for a bite. DISAPPOINTED is not the word. The word worst then being disappointed should be said, the pasta had ZERO Taste. Chicken plain, pasta plain and very blah, sauce which was more soup than creamy Alfredo sauce ... I tried to eat it but was completely disappointed I just spent 15.99 on trash. So I bring it up to the guy who took my order and tells him it has no taste ..... Can I get something else? He's instantly upset \\"bring it here! Idk what your talking about, what do you mean no taste?\\" So I explain \\"salt and pepper couldn't help me out this is horrible. And it's not even ziti but spiral macaroni. \\" he took the plate spoke to the workers in his language all this while another costumer is next to me waiting. The costumer admits to getting the ziti himself and claims it's good. I explain to him that it was too plain no taste what so ever. While we're talking a piece of the menu fell down! \\"What do you want?\\" Guy asks me agitated now, I was still deciding scared to try anything else .. I opted for the fish and chips 11.99. I've had better fish n chips to be honest but at this point I was starving and ate some of it there but then felt super uncomfortable and left. Moral of the story it could've been dealt with better personally I've worked in a pizza restaurant before guests aren't satisfied with food sometimes it happens ... Don't come here for the Alfredo. And quite honestly service sucks too. One and done for this guest here. Never see my face or money again good luck to ya!

Extra bread never came and he didn't check on us again until our meals had arrived and were nearly finished. We sat without water for all of our pasta course. A different person cleared our food and boxed up our pizza, which never returned to the table. I had to flag someone down and ask them to find the pizza about 15 minutes later so that we could leave. \\n\\nFood was okay. Edible, but nothing special. Bread was good. Cheese board was fine but certainly overpriced. Pizza was fine. Pasta was average at best. Undercooked and hard, not al dente.

What they serve is more like well-done roast without any seasoning. The sides taste like they have come out of a plastic bucket from Sysco, the bulk food/restaurant supplier. This place survives because it has a loyal following of local people who have been eating there since the 1960's. There are really nice people who work and run this place, and the people who eat here are good southern folks too but the food is pretty depressing if you are Atlanta food aficionado or if you have ever eaten and Fox Bros, Community Q, or Heirloom Market BBQ here in Atlanta.

I just had a great trip with friends visiting Boston, we wanted to have a happy ending by having a great dinner in this area. We surfed  the yelp, and founds this restaurant had great reviews, then we decided give it a try. However, this was the only drawback of our trip. \\n\\nThe food was good and came up quick, however, the service was the worst I had ever had. The server were rude and impolite. I was a server myself before, I would never treat and use that attitude to my customers. We politely asked them to changed our seats since it was chilly to sit next to the door. There were plenty of tables we could move to, they just denied in an uncomfortable way. We even asked before our food up. The door kept opening and closing the whole time, and we just couldn't enjoy our meal. \\n\\nThe worse part was the server automatically add 18% gratuity on our bills without noticed us. I understand for dinner and large group, normally we would tip from 18% to 20% if the food and service satisfy us. You have to plead with them to have it removed. The manager came by with a rude attitude I have never seen in any restaurant I went before. He thought we are going to pay without any gratuity. He used an arrogant tone by saying have you guys seen our reviews. Of course, we came because of that. I normally would not write any reviews after I went to any good or bad restaurant. However, this time I just can't let it go. \\n\\nI will never come back again and won't recommend any one to come to this unfriendly restaurant.

It was the perfect mix of chicken to cheese and wasn't too spicy of a buffalo flavor.  The soup itself was perfect for tomato soup.  I'm normally not a tomato soup fan but this was the perfect compliment to the sandwich.

Because Southern California has a large Korean population, there's a profusion of Korean restaurants, and thus we were fearful that we'd be unable to get good and authentic Korean food in Rip City.  This is an important feature of any place we live, as my wife is Korean, and we need our Korean comfort food!\\n\\nThankfully, Toji supplies everything we need - and we don't even have to drive to Beaverton.  We've been twice, and both times have experienced excellent barbeque options.  Most recently, we got the Ribeye combo, which had 3 or 4 excellent cuts of meat.  The meat was good quality and we had a sumptuous feast supported by myriad banchan (Side dishes).\\n\\nThey also make very good \\"deuk mandoo guk\\", or rice cake dumpling soup.\\n\\nToji is a grill-at-your-table type of restaurant, which is really the best way to have Korean Barbeque. As with most Korean restaurants, they bring lots of small side dishes along with the main dish, and their menu extends beyond BBQ to other Korean staples like Bibimbap and japchae.\\n\\nIf you're unfamiliar with Korean food, Toji might have a bit of a learning curve, but the wait staff can provide answers to your questions.  Korean BBQ is among some of the best eating to be had.\\n\\nAs with most food we've had since moving to Portland, the prices are a steal (compared with L.A./O.C.). Combos that would be $70+ in L.A. are $50, which means you can feed four or more people for beyond reasonable rates.
