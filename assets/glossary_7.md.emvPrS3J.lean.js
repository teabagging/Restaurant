The shrimp and lobster were so large they were hard to cut with a butter knife and I felt like I was chewing on a piece of a 3lbs lobster! And like in previous comments, it wasn't hot.

No, this does not expedite my wait. If anything there were double the amount of people in the drive thru because of this new addition!! I think I counted 13 cars in the drive thru. I was able to go in and get my food and leave before the person that was ordering at the speaker when I went in could get their food.\\n\\nI think the owner's name is Melinda....Mrs. Melinda....this was NOT a good idea.

Despite the good charring they gave my beef patty (correction: my handful of awkwardly shaped chunks of ground beef; I don't know if my food fell apart on the grill or what), it remained remarkably flavorful and juicy. Overall, not a great burger, but something I'd be willing to eat again.\\n\\nThey ran out of fries and subbed a generous amount of onion rings on my plate, which were pretty gross -- the standard frozen, out-of-the-bag type. The strawberry milkshake tasted pretty off, too; I kind of doubt there were actually any strawberries in it.\\n\\nThe interior of the restaurant is a bit rough, and it's clearly a work in progress, what with all the empty shelves at the bar and the unused restaurant equipment lying around.

I prefer combo sandwiches, which is what they call a sandwich here with two types of meats. Everytime I go here I'll order up turkey, roast beef, pepper jack cheese, lettuce, tomato, and onion with Russian dressing on their French rolls. That's my recommendation. Don't miss out on it. They also make steak fries here, though you won't get through a sandwich and fries alone, so only order the fries if there's someone to share them with.

If I was basing the review on food alone it might get five stars but the service really brings down the overall tally.  We decided to visit the restaurant on a Saturday afternoon and surprisingly the wait time was only  5-10 minutes.  We got a table upstairs in a small alcove with three tables. It was a tight fit but nothing unbearable. I am a vegetarian but the other three people with me are all meat eaters and part of the reason we chose the spot was because of the vegetarian options.  I was pleased but not overly impressed with the selection of meat free items, but any time there is more than one meat-free option I'm content. \\n\\nWe ordered:\\nFish Sauce Wings (I didn't try them but heard they were wonderful)\\nPapaya Pok Pok - vegetarian (this was my least favorite dish, they were supposed to bring the chilis on the side but they never did. I found it bland and uninspired. Maybe the non vegetarian version is better. Two people in our party did seem to enjoy it more than I did.\\nNeua Naam Tok flank steak salad - (again, I didn't try this but it got rave reviews at my table). \\nKhao Soi curry noodle soup - vegetarian (this was a good dish, it had flavor and the broth was delicious but the tofu and mushroom chucks were huge.  It's also not an ideal dish to share. They did bring soup bowls and spoons after we were halfway finished eating.)\\nPhat Si Ew noodles - vegetarian (this was a delicious dish).\\n\\nNow service... Water had black floating things in it, this was replaced fairly, quickly. The server took our orders right away, we ordered drinks along with our food but the food came before the drinks and we had to ask a second time for our drinks to be brought.  Also, two of us ordered the drinking vinegar, when I asked about the flavors he referred me to the menu and had me read the list of options to myself but as we were leaving the restaurant I saw on the blackboard they had quite a few flavors that were not on the menu. Since I specifically asked and even asked for a recommendation it would have been nice if the server had been able to list them for me and then given me a few popular flavors to choose from. I ordered pineapple, it was fine but not mind blowing. They also have RC cola and you are charged for each refill. When someone in our party wanted another cola after we had received the check the server wanted to take it back and add it on.  As I mentioned above things were delivered out of order. The drinks came after the food, the bowls and spoons came way after the arrival of the soup... The rice arrived cold but we ate it anyway.  It was really difficult to get our servers attention and after a while it seemed pointless to ask for things or remind him of items that were overlooked. \\n\\nI am glad that we dined at Pok Pok, the food was good but I've had better food and better atmosphere and much better service at better prices, elsewhere. As a vegetarian diner I would have liked to have seen a few menu items that were vegetarian in nature without having to alter them or feel like you were dumbing down the chef's original intent.  Bottom line, if the food had been as good as I expected it to be the service wouldn't have mattered I would have left just remembering the food and anticipating the next time I'd go back and what else I could try from the menu."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"This is what every bookstore should be.

THIS IS THAT RESTAURANT FOR OYSTERS.\\n\\nI really like seafood in general, but I was never a fan of oysters. I've tried a couple, but they always just tasted too fishy and the flavor didn't make up for the cold, squishy texture. But when I visited Boston, I heard that oysters are what the city is known for. I was pretty down to try one oyster just to say I tried one in Boston. One of my friends wanted to go Neptune Oyster because it has like a thousand more reviews and more tourist hype, but our Boston friend who was showing us around insisted that Island Creek was better and that all the \\"locals\\" highly recommended it. Oh, and another perk was that Neptune had like a two hour wait, but we got seated right away at Island Creek.\\n\\nWe started out with the Island Creek Oyster (? honestly forgot the names of all the oysters). They bring out a little basket of sauces so I put some jalapeno tabasco on mine. And then....dang....that first bite, my eyes opened so wide and I just knew my life would never be the same. The texture, taste, temperature, everything was just perfect. IT WAS SO GOOD YOU GUYS. I'm literally salivating right now thinking about it. \\n\\nMy friend and I also shared the lobster roe noodles which were LITERALLY HEAVEN. The lobster was so soft and there was some other kind of meat on it that was really yummy and soft and the mushrooms were bomb and the sauce was 10/10 and the noodles were perfectly cooked and......yeah basically, get the lobster roe noodles. \\n\\nI also tried a bite of the grilled salmon that my other two friends shared. It was aite. I didn't love it as much as the oysters and the lobster noodles, but I mean it was literally like one bite so I honestly can't judge it that well. \\n\\nWe got two more rounds of oysters, both were delicious but I can't remember what they were called. One friend got two of the shrimps and they were ENORMOUS. He said they were really good even though they were $4 each. I didn't try them only because I'm allergic to shrimp.\\n\\nWe went as a group of 4 for an early dinner on Thursday night. Looking around, we noticed that most of the people were dressed pretty nicely, business casual or above. We felt a little out of place in our sweaters and hoodies so maybe put on at least a button up shirt or blouse. Total bill came out to $120ish. I paid $35 for four oysters and half the lobster noodles."},{"name":"The Ivy","address":"3717 Roswell Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"This place is pretty cool.

She continued saying we \\"would not have enough time to eat\\" otherwise. Needless to say, this started our meal off badly which was unfortunate considering we were there to celebrate our upcoming wedding and honeymoon to Italy. \\n\\nThe food was okay...two of our plates were cold, obviously sitting in the window while we ate our starter. The waitress and busboy then interrupted our meal every 10 minutes asking if we needed boxes for the remainder of our food and proceeded to reach over us to grab plates.

We were not asked if we wanted another glass of wine, etc. \\n\\nAs we exited, our entire meal taking less than an hour, I politely mentioned to one of the other women that we had felt rushed and suggested they not tell customers to hurry.

Unobjectionable but unremarkable.\\n\\nI met a friend there last night for coffee and/or a light supper.  As it turns out neither of us ended up eating.  I could have, but nothing leapt out at me when I eyed the menu, and I had leftovers at home.  Good leftovers!  The food of the people sitting six inches away from us looked all right.  But nothing enticing.  If I'd been hungry I would have eaten something and it would have been all right I'm guessing.  But I didn't eat.\\n\\nWhat we did have was a chai (me) and a mocha (friend).  Verdict on both:  so-so.  The chai was a bit too cloyingly sweet.  I think my friend liked his mocha well enough.\\n\\nNeither of us were sold on the ambiance.The room is dark and cramped.   It was pretty full, and the tables are tightly squeezed together.  They have musicians come in for live sets which is nice but that means they have to shift the tables even closer together while people are seated.  I was also asked, first by a staff person, and later by a patron with a laptop, to squirm around in my chair and fumble for a power strip hidden in a corner behind me so that various things could be plugged in and unplugged.  Kind of weird.  \\n\\nThere's nothing specific I can point to that's off, except perhaps an injudicious use of space. And perhaps the price-to-experience ratio is a bit off -- $4.20 seems rather pricey for a large chai that was actually relatively small (but enough for me given the aforementioned heavy sweetness).  When you consider how cramped everyone was, I didn't feel it was money well spent.  The music wasn't bad, but it was loud enough to make conversation difficult ... always a trade-off with live music in a small space.  So it's worth considering beforehand whether your purpose is to talk or be entertained.  If you were hoping to talk ... you might be better off going at a time when they don't have live music.  Or go somewhere else.\\n\\nThe staff were very friendly, if a bit inattentive (we had to ask 3 times for the check).  \\n\\nLast night confirmed what I'd always thought about Cafe Luna:  it's okay, but never my first choice."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I went to this restaurant on the same night as a sox game.

Once at a table, it took fifteen to twenty minutes for a server to come by.\\n\\nWhile the oysters served were very nice, I have to say the selection was a lot smaller than expected. I mean this place has Oyster in their name. For starters I also ordered the fried green tomatoes- one of which was a red one :-/ The batter was a little too much and masked the other flavors of the dish. I also ordered the watermelon and cucumber salad. Very clean flavors and a helping of whipped ricotta that complimented the dish perfectly.\\n\\nNext was the lobster bisque- I would say skip this dish. It didn't have a good cream base and was sweet in the most unpleasant way. For my entree I order the Halibut which was very tasty and a perfect crisp skin. It was paired with \\"ricotta\\" gnocchi. These were just a little to heavy in my opinion to be ricotta. They were also seared which was really disappointing to me. Just not what I was expecting.

Sides were swapped, some weren't even brought out, different sides were brought out as replacements (how do you even mess up replacements??).  The manager came out multiple times to apologize, but the service never got better - every single step had multiple mistakes.  Even after the manager came out and talked to one of our guests whose food never arrived, it was brought out later and still incorrect. \\n\\nThen the checks came.  The manager was gracious enough to comp our entire meal by 50%, but just about every check that came out was incorrect.  We were double charged for some items, while some items were just plain wrong.  At this point, our close to three hour brunch ordeal had already gone south, we just paid the incorrect tabs and left.\\n\\nOf the eight people in attendance, only one person's order was correct, and five of the eight checks were incorrect.  The most mind blowing part was the manager had already come out to the table (twice), and yet STILL the mistakes kept rolling in.  While we appreciate the manager's courtesy in comping 50% of the meal, none in our group will ever return - it was not worth the hassle.  It's a shame, too, because their food - when correct - is quite good."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great place.

He was so nice that we decided to make sure we come back the following day.   On Friday, we went there at around 7:30, and we were told that the wait was about 20 minutes by the same host.  He then offered us wine while we waited with no charge as he recognized us from the night before.\\n\\nTheir menu is fusion style with items like sushi burrito and sushi burger.  The vibe of the place is casual and friendly.  Because my friend does not eat seafood, instead of sushi, we went for lemongrass chicken rice bowl and chicken hibachi noodles, and both were very tasty.  Ordered Edamame beans as appetizer and was served in a large bowl warm instead of cold.  The server was extremely friendly and accommodating.  \\n\\nOverall, we had a wonderful experience.

This was previously the location of Badayori which we also visited quite regularly. It was a sad time for us after Badayori closed its doors, so we were excited to hear about NoriNori taking over this space many months later. This is where we come for our sushi & sashimi fix. Unlike other buffets we have tried, NoriNori usually does a great job of keeping the buffet stocked up with everything. Like others have mentioned, the sashimi is not always cut neatly and sometimes just looks like a big mess. But the quality and freshness are very good so I put up with the little pieces. After many, many visits I still don't think I have tried every kind of sushi. There are just so many to choose from! I always get a couple pieces of the Uni shushi when it's available. There's no password to get it - just ask. They limit you to two pieces but I honestly could not eat more than that. \\n\\nBesides the sushi & sashimi, we gorge ourselves on the cold entree bar every time. Nearly every item is excellent with our favorites being the salmon tatake with cilantro pesto, beef tatake, and smoked salmon. The beef tatake seems a little inconsistent lately with widely varying thickness. It used to be super thin and very tender. Last weekend the beef was a quarter-inch thick and somewhat chewy. Also, the smoked salmon didn't seem chilled enough and was slimy and mushy in texture. I feel like the overall quality of many items is slipping over our past few visits. The hot entrees are where NoriNori really misses the mark. Badayori did much better. Out of everything on that side, I only get the beef teriyaki, which is usually cooked perfectly (perfect to me is medium rare). The crab cakes are gross, the fried shrimp lack the proper texture, and the tempura is embarrassing for a Japanese restaurant. The shumai is simply the worst I have ever had. I couldn't even eat more than a little bite of the mushy interior. Even a cheap buffet like Super Grand Buffet in Duluth has a much better selection of higher-quality shumai and dumplings. Over on the grill, I will grab a beef kebob or two but that's it. The beef ribs are dry and overcooked as are most of the grilled items. \\n\\nThe rewards program is a nice bonus at NoriNori. We each get a free dinner during the month of our birthday and we earn points towards something (I guess I haven't earned enough for any free dinners yet!). \\n\\nEven though there are a few things to complain about, we will still keep coming back. I think we get our money's worth in the sushi, sashimi, crab legs, and cold entrees. Like I said, the overall quality seems to be slipping and that's something we will have to watch on future visits. I knocked off one star for the hot entrees, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars."},{"name":"Fantastico Pizza 2001","address":"595 W Pender Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Woohoo!!!!

Certain old go-to standby places not far away (Oga's on Windy Hill and the Wings/Philly/Fried Fish place / hole-in-the-Wall next to the gas station [also on Windy Hill near North Park Place; both Korean run joints]) are just a bit TOO far from my office for a fast in/out lunch.\\n\\nVittles is almost too far as well but I decided to give it a try after reading reviews from other yelpers. The building is nondescript with a cheap sign. The place is busy at lunch but not slammed which can be a good thing or a bad thing. You cannot see inside the place after you park. When you walk in you get weird impressions right off the bat. \\n\\nVittles interior has the weird feel of an off-the-beaten path early 60s era old Atlanta souvenier shop (sorta like a Cracker Barrel early prototype) . There are two separate dining areas - one for smokers and one for non-smoking people (like me). The cashiers podium is near the front entrance. Vittles dining rooms are like stepping back into a time warp (one of THOSE kind of places; both dining rooms).\\n\\nAfter you choose which dining room you want to eat in, you order from a beat-up menu. And the servers are kinda scary -  like they might kick your ass if you give them any guff. But the food is straight up, no nonsense country cooking; great if you like the traditional old Southern meat-and-two style meals. \\n\\nMy lunch, country fried steak with gravy, turnip greens, mash potatoes (also with gravy), and a slice of texas toast was great. Sweet Tea was spot on perfect. Was it cheap? Not really. With tax and tip I paid slightly more than ten bucks. With this kind of lunch I like to stay under eight or under nine.\\n\\nBut I am glad I went. I like this place; however, I could not, in good faith, bring my mom or grandmother here. They would hate it on ambience (or lack thereof) alone.

A little later, it also occurred to me that being a rebel without a cause just means missing out on stuff. \\n\\nSo on a brisk and beautiful Tuesday morning, I sallied forth with the heater on and the sunroof open up the stairway to Heaven, or more precisely, MoPac to Heaven.

Who among us hasn't marveled over the selection of Waffle House songs in their jukebox, gazed jaws agape at the speed of the short order cook, or dry heaved in a corner booth at 4 in the morning while regretting being talked into those last couple of tequila shots? No? Anyone? Bueller? Bueller? OK, maybe it's just me, but the ubiquity of the Awful Waffle inspires more than just a little bit of curiosity. I mean, how DID it get started? Why are they all that shape and size? How did they come up with that number of hash brown combinations when countless engineers and full-on mathematicians I know couldn't replicate their numbers (More on that later.) In fact, how did a place called The Waffle House become known more for their hash browns than anything else? So yes, I was intrigued enough to head to Avondale to see the Waffle House Museum.\\n\\nUnfortunately, as I covered earlier, though the theory of a WH museum can't be topped, its execution is more scattered and dicey, ultimately smothering the whole experience. Why? First, it's not open to the public. Viewing is by appointment; the number is on their website. However, they've been holding several open houses, free to the general public, lately and that's how I got in.\\n\\nThere are two sections: the memorabilia room and the restaurant recreation. The memorabilia room is just that. Tsotchkes and relics of bygone eras, seats, old promo items, menus, mugs, etc. each lovingly labled, but with very little context. Then again, how much context does one need for \\"Cooks' Paper Hats Throughout the Years?\\" The founder's notepad designs for the first WH are also housed here, supplying the template for all future Waffle Houses. Well, at least THAT question was answered. But my other questions? Not so much. Then again, the memorabilia room is more homage than it is education; I doubt very much a curator was involved in the collection.\\n\\nThe restaurant recreation, though, is what everyone wanted to see. Yes, it's a complete restoration of the restaurant just as it looked in 1955 which, honestly, looks pretty much the same as they all do now. They thoughtfully supplied plastic food stuffs in all the right places and they encourage you to step behind the counter to play out your short order dreams. You can toast plastic bread, flip fake waffles. You can shoot faux-angry stares at fake drunks slurring orders at the counter. \\n\\nI admittedly spent more time playing back here than a grown man should.\\n\\nThe experience was cute, but, when someone asked me about it later, I responded, \\"Well, if you want to see the entire thing, it'll take about 10 minutes. I mean, hell, it's the size of a Waffle House.\\" You can spend more time here if you talk with the welcoming staff (including the nice, yet somewhat condescending marketing guy who assured me \\"Well, the Waffle House Board is mostly GA Tech engineers, so I'm sure the number of combinations they have published on the menu is correct.\\" Further research on my part has uncovered that they count as toppings THOUSAND ISLAND DRESSING, BLUE CHEESE, Tabasco, and Ranch frakin' dressing among their toppings. Really, Marketing Guy? REALLY?)\\n\\nIn all, I'm glad there's a Waffle House museum, and, if you've got an hour to kill (and it's open) give it a look. But to my friend Matt down in Orlando who wanted to plan a pilgrimage, you might be a little disappointed.

Their hot bar stuff consists of fried shrimp, mayo shrimp, crab cakes (which are mostly bread crumbs and fake crab meat), fried rice, all sorts of terriyaki, and tempura.

I remember when going to Finale was a treat, and I looked forward to sitting down and enjoying a nice dessert with friends or a loved one. Now, everything has gone down hill, the environment, the service, and the food.\\n\\nFirst of all, the service staff is absolutely horrendous.  Everyone seems to be fairly absent-minded, aloof, and no one seems to be happy working either.  I heard way too many complaints about patrons from passing waitresses while in the waiting area.  OMG it's busy on a Saturday night? NO WAI!!\\n\\nIt took us 20 minutes to get seated, which is totally fine, and the waitress at first seemed ok.  She almost immediately asked us if we were ready to order (after one minute...), to which we asked for a little bit more time.  When she came back we put in an order for the molten cake and the pecan tart as well as a flight of sparkling wines.  The wines were served promptly, and the deserts came out with in 10 minutes.  After the waitress  dropped the desserts off, that was the last we saw of her for almost an hour.  She literally forgot about us.  The entire restaurant turned over while we were waiting.  We tried flagging her down multiple times, all which were ignored as she walked by our table and checked in on other tables at least a dozen times.  I'm done with my food, give me my goddamned check, I don't know how much more obvious we could have made it beyond just getting up and leaving.  Finally the hostess came over and realized we had been waiting and trying to get someone, and she grabbed our waitress and informed her that we needed the check.  The waitress came over handed us the check without a single word.  Not a thank you, not an apology.  NOTHING!  YOU FORGOT ABOUT US, WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU?  We paid with cash and promptly left, a ruined experience.\\n\\nBesides the service, the entire restaurant looks like shit.  The tables aren't cleaned properly, and there are dirt streaks all over them, the paint is horrible and chipping away, and the mirrors which are prominently placed around the restaurant are disgusting.  If they can't keep the table where I eat clean, I can't imagine the kitchen.\\n\\nFinally, the desserts were actually the best part of the experience, which isn't hard to do at this point.  Molten cake was good, and pecan tart is good too.  The ice cream is actually really good, we had vanilla and coffee served with our desserts. \\n\\nBut would I ever go back again?

Sadly, this wasn't the case when we went here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. My boyfriend had read glowing reviews of this place and urged me to try it for dinner on Saturday night (even though I don't like fish, but I was willing to make a meal out of fried calamari and clams casino since he had his heart set on it). The line for dinner on Saturday was ridiculous, so we ended up going to Maurizio's down the block instead, and instead decided to try The Daily Catch for lunch on Sunday. This proved to be a wise decision. \\n\\nThe Daily Catch was advertised as opening at noon on Sundays, so we walked from our hotel and arrived in the North End a little before 11:30. We opted to pass some time in Mike's Pastry across the street with a tea and a cappuccino. By the time a waitress came aorund to take our drink order, serve it, and then get our bill, The Daily Catch's small dining room (about 5 tables, literally) was already full and a party of 6 was waiting outside for some food. We got on line behind the family and waited for a table for two to clear out, which was maybe 20 minutes. The mother of the family in front of us told us that the place actually opened at 11:30 for lunch. Oops. \\n\\nOnce a table cleared, the hostess/waitress came outside to get us, and we were immediately seated and given some bread. We looked up at the large blackboard on the wall and decided to go with the fried calamari, clams casino and an order of garlic bread. The waitress immediately told us that they had run out of garlic bread (how do you \\"run out\\" of garlic bread an hour after opening? Oh well, not a big deal), so we just went with the calamari and clams. I asked how big the calamari plate would be and she said that a \\"small\\" would easily feed the two of us, but as it turned out the small serving wasn't all that much. If that's all you're ordering and you plan to share, go with the large serving. \\n\\nThe food came out quickly, especially since the kitchen/stovetop is right there next to you. You literally feel as if you're in this woman's kitchen. It was also a very friendly atmosphere, where the older waitress laughed and joked around with the chef and the busboy. She quickly refreshed our basket of bread when we asked for more (just threw two fresh pieces on top of the old crumbs and the half-used butter packets already in the basket, but not a big deal), and got us two small, cold, glass bottles of Coke and opened them for us and gave us plastic cups. \\n\\nAs for the food itself ... honestly, I've had better. The calamari was fresh, but the pieces weren't very large and they were tasty but not phoenominal. The clams appeared to be smaller pieces of clam that were prepared and breaded, and then placed inside a clamshell for the presentation (be careful, they're VERY hot). Again, tasty, but nothing special. \\n\\nNow, I've read awesome reviews of The Daily Catch, so it's possible that we didn't care for it simply because we got two very basic, appetizer-style items instead of meals. I was just reluctant to go for a full meal because I don't really eat seafood and didn't want to waste $20 or so on an entree that I wouldn't finish. And again, the staff is friendly. But based on our experience alone (especially because it was such a long wait for food that we weren't really impressed with), I don't think we'd go back."},{"name":"Tapenade Bistro","address":"3711 Bayview Street","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"My wife and I had dinner with another couple at Tapanade Bistro during a recent visit to Vancouver.  It was a sunny, cool July evening.  Dinner on an outside patio across from the fishing pier in Steveston seemed like the perfect place for a Friday evening dinner.  Mistake!   Should have paid closer attention to some of the recent review on Tripadvisor.  Two of us chose the daily special which was smoked beef brisket done on a smoker located at the end of the patio.  The beef was dried out, chewy and tasted like the smell of burnt rubber.  Hard to imagine how they could make such a mess of smoked brisket.  I suspect they had smoked the beef a day or two earlier and re-heated it for serving.  Awful!  As our server cleared he asked \\"wasn't it great\\"?  The fact that only half the meat on both plates had been eaten should have been his first clue that it wasn't a hit.  I had manila clams with a spicy cream sauce.  Tasty.  Would have been very good if the clams hadn't been extremely gritty.  Our 4th had the vegetarian pasta dish.  Though it's a regular menu item, they were out of the usual pasta.  The substitute pasta was fine.  But it's strange to run out of an item on the regular menu.  The pasta and sauce was very ordinary.  Tasted like something out of a jar.  Our server was young and very inexperienced.  Knew virtually nothing about menu items.  Forgot our appetizer orders.  Seemed to keep forgetting us. Bottom line - a lovely setting.

The ribs are a bit crisp on the outside and melt in your mouth tender on the inside, truly a perfect contrast, its how I imagine Jesus' flesh would taste. The sausage is flavorful and has a nice kick with the jalapeno, when topped with Rudy's spicy BBQ sauce you have hit the pinnacle. Sides are optional and not necessary in my opinion, the creamed corn is a virtual heart attack in a bowl and the beans and slaw are...well, beans and slaw. My recommendation is bring an appetite and stick with the basics, meat, bread and sauce.

Now I don't mind a char on the pizza crust, but when Mo's pizza arrived at the table, the bottom crust was burned and most of the edges around the pizza were too black.  Also, I was disappointed in the taste of the pizza.  The sauce is not remarkable, the bacon must have been bacon bits because we could not find an actual piece, and the onions were barely cooked.  Compared with other pizzas in Seattle, the flavors were weak.  We told the server that we thought the pizza was too burned, and she smiled and walked away.  \\n\\nI also have to criticize the basic salad for $7.00.  It was just lettuce, a little red cabbage, and some cheese tossed on top.

At our request, we were luckily seated next to the kitchen window, tucked away from the main dining room, and were able to view the chef's team at work on a busy Saturday evening.\\n\\nOriginally, we wanted to do the 7-course Chef's Tasting, but I can't eat gamey meats and did notice that much of the courses offered on the tasting menu were also offered √† la carte.  The Chef was accommodating and would let us substitute the Elk main entr√©e for the Sirloin.  However, our helpful server suggested we could also build our own tasting √† la carte with wine pairings: immediate yes!\\n\\n1.  Scallop carpaccio:  Favorite!  I wanted to order a second round of this beautifully presented dish.  Fresh, amazing combination of citrus flavors with the pomelo and crunch with the pistachio.\\n\\n2.  Winter squash soup:  Pass.  It was fine, but not perfectly executed in taste profile to my liking.  A bit underwhelming, with a thin consistency and curry flavor that didn't blend in well.\\n\\n3.  Heirloom beets:  Delicious with another great combination of flavors with the meringue.  The beets were cut larger than I'd expect.\\n\\n4.  Spanish octopus:  Pass.  The octopus was cooked well, however, I didn't quite like the flavor of the dish overall; it was simply lacking.\\n\\n5.  Seared foie gras:  Yum!  If there was one dish I didn't want to really share, the foie gras was definitely it.  Delicious with a perfectly paired parsnip cake.  I really wanted this all to myself!\\n\\n6.  Squid ink risotto:  Amazing!  The risotto and gnocchi were the only two dishes we ordered in half sizes.  I wish we had ordered the full size of this dish instead.  Absolute perfection: I loved, loved the risotto.  The prawn was so fresh and tender.  I do wish there was more sea urchin present in the dish.\\n\\n7.  Sweet potato gnocchi:  Sweet.  Perfectly pan-fried: reminded me a little bit of dessert.\\n\\n8.  Chicken for two:  Perfection.  Although I knew this dish would be a bit much for our main entr√©e with so many preceding courses, we just had to!  I was craving a meal with a whole-cooked chicken, and this was the most perfectly roasted chicken.  The meat was tender, juicy and oh so savory; very excited that I have a whole chicken breast leftover.  Although perfectly crisp, the skin was too salty from the brine to enjoy.  We also ordered the Baby brussels on the side.\\n\\n9.  Double souffl√©:  Star of the show.  At this point, why stop at only one?  We ordered both the Chocolate souffl√© with vanilla ice cream and the Framboise souffl√© with chocolate ice cream, and do not regret it.  The most perfectly prepared souffl√© I've had thus far.  Between the two, the Chocolate was the definite winner, but the raspberry was unique and held its own.\\n\\nSo happy with our meal!  Ray, the head sommelier, was feeling particularly partial to Burgundy that evening.  He kindly offered us a complementary pairing with the foie gras.  We enjoyed six perfect wine pairings: Sauvignon blanc (favorite), Ros√©, Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Cabernet blend.\\n\\nOverall, the food was amazing and we had very nice service, as the last table standing at well past midnight.  The price point is appropriate.  French cuisine is meant to be spent over great company and wine.  Do not overlook this and make sure to take the time to order accordingly.

I went here with my girlfriend and a good friend for a nice night out. It wasn't, due to a series of extremely uncomfortable and malicious exchanges with the waitress.\\n\\n\\nThe good: Honestly, the food was pretty good (especially the rose lemonade!), and the place is beautiful. Credit where credit is due.\\n\\nThe bad: First, my girlfriend asked what part of North Africa the cuisine was from (an honest question since her roommate is from Tunisia and she was curious about the region). The waitress responded with a snarky: \\"All of North Africa! It's only the English that separated them - learn your history!\\".\\n\\nWe ordered entrees, and were soon brought pita and two small sausages, which we assumed were starters (like at many restaurants) and ate. Wrong! The waitress came back and yelled at us - apparently she had accidentally brought us two appetizers destined for another table. She then asked us why we didn't tell her we hadn't ordered appetizers. We tried to apologize, explaining that we thought they were starters. She brusquely said we would be charged for them anyways as this is a small family restaurant and they can't afford it. Despite being uncomfortable, we did not dispute this.\\n\\nWhen we were finished our entrees, the waitress seemed to be ignoring our table and in fact did not clear off our plates until after we had left.\\n\\nAbout the bill: We all had credit cards only, and the place is cash only. Fair enough, but when I expressed disappointment about this, the waitress decided to sass me in front of the entire restaurant, loudly and obnoxiously. I was outraged and brought up the fact she mistakenly brought us appetizers and then stuck us with the bill, and said I did not appreciate her attitude and that it was not helpful. This is when things got really ugly.\\n\\nShe comes up really close to me, points at me, and loudly exclaims: \\"YOU are a boy! YOU are disrespectful! I am an older woman! Pay and get the hell out of my restaurant!\\". She then sat in a corner and talked about us loudly and offensively to the other servers. In French. Which both me and my girlfriend speak fluently.

I was so excited to hear we were going to Island Creek because I heard and read good things. However, I wanted to love Island Creek Oysters Bar, I really did, but it just wasn't in the cards. I'll start with the positives:\\n\\n- Raw Bar: Unreal variety. I got a half a dozen (2 Island Creek, 2 Wellfleet, 2 Littleneck). I don't have many friends who love raw shellfish sooo hey foodies holla at me so we can go try out the other 10 varieties of oysters available there. They were sweet and so fresh and magically delicious.\\n\\n- Dessert: So I don't have pictures nor did I make note of the name of it and I also did not see it on the dessert menu online so it must've been a seasonal one. It was fried dough and ice cream. I do remember the brown/maple butter ice cream and it was magnificent. Really made the dish - we definitely wished there was more of that to accompany the fried dough.\\n\\n- Bread: The bread basket and the spread that i comes with is delicious. We tried to get more but that didn't really work out .... on to the negatives.\\n\\nOutside of these 2 things though, I was unimpressed with Island Creek as a restaurant given 1) the popularity (place was packed!) and 2) the price. The Boy doesn't eat seafood and found his Skirt Steak very average and despite popular reviews, I thought the Lobster Roe Noodles sounded good but the flavors just didn't pull together for me. Something in the sauce and the pecorino it gave it a kind of ... sour? ... taste. Just a tangy flavor that I wasn't about despite the overwhelming positive reactions on Yelp and the fact that it sounded so good on paper. The components - short rib, lobster, mushrooms - good individually but not together.\\n\\nFinal deduction of stars is also attributed to service. Plus points because they took my drink off the tab since I didn't like the cocktail I chose (very nice), but incredibly slow service ... considering we were seated RIGHT NEXT to the center island where they got all the utensils, sauces, and even the 'register' was. We asked for more bread that never came and it just seemed like servers were avoiding eye contact with us ... when we were so clearly trying to get their attention. I don't know if you're trying to give us our privacy or not do any disservice by not letting our own waiter serve us but .. it was kind of annoying. Our waiter did wish me happy birthday though - not after he checked my license, however - it was after he overheard us speaking about my birthday which i find to be the perfect example of how the service just wasn't attentive enough.

On top of that the windows were all open and it was WINDY.  Fun trying to eat whil trying desperately to keep my napkins from flying away. Then about 10 mins into my meal, the soda they served ran  out because their idea of serving a soda is filling a glass to the brin with ice and then filling in the gaps with liquid. i sat there looking out for my waitress for FIFTEEN MINUTES before she finally showed up again. None of the other waitstaff offered to help even though i was obviously in need of something. When the refill finally did arrive it was the same thing: 4-5 sips of soda in a glass of ice. The nail in the coffin was when the check arrived and i discovered i had been billed FOUR DOLLARS for about 3 ounces of actual soda. When i took issue with the waitress she said \\"that's the policy\\" despite having never been charged for a refill in 2 years of eating there and was completely unhelpful. \\n\\nSeriously.

Besides, they serve platters with banganoush (feels like pasta made from roasted eggplants with some traditional spices), hummus, garlic sauce (my favorite, feels like yogurt mixed with garlic). Everything is always fresh!!! and melting in your mouth.

While I would not normally consider this a dining destination, I enjoyed my visits while staying at the hotel for a wedding.  My first trip consisted of a few rounds of drinks with some friends.  I was shocked by the substantial list of unusual beers and interesting cocktails.  My girl friend and I were able to coax her boyfriend into ordering a strawberry brew for us to sneak sips of.  She doubled up on the sweets with the Carmel Bailey's-infused Snickers Martini for herself.    Both drinks were delicious.  My vodka and club soda was a bit strong, but at least I got my money's worth!   The bartender had been very accommodating and allowed us to linger close to an hour past the last call.\\n\\nMy second trip to One Bistro was for the wedding's after-party.   My friends and I started the celebration with several cocktails, but were disappointed that shots were not allowed in the classy bar.  As time went by, our hunger surprisingly returned, and we ordered some of their bar appetizers.  The crowd huddled around crisp Calamari Rings, which were accompanied by a Sweet and Spicy Dipping Sauce.  The crunchy snack was perfectly cooked, and the side marinade was a flavorful compliment.  The Warm Artichoke Dip, however, was loaded with cream and extremely underdone.  I prefer my dip to have more substance and less cheesy goo.  The bonus pita chips were stale, and the corn tortillas were an odd addition.  We were all happy to partake in the family-style snacking, but were only mildly impressed with the quality.\\n\\nOne Bistro is a low-key spot to enjoy drinks and a quick meal, but is only worth visiting if you are a guest at the hotel."},{"name":"Summer Moon Coffee - Buda","address":"316 N Main St","city":"Buda","stars":"4.5","text":"Give one star for the great coffee but everything else fails.

I bought the Pok Pok cookbook by Andy Ricker a couple months back after searching for a recommended Thai cookbook and I've even made the pork belly vermicelli clay pot dish at home. I was looking forward to trying the legendary chicken wings and although they were good, I think overall in the end I was slightly underwhelmed by our dining experience.\\n\\nAs we approached the restaurant, you could smell the delicious aroma of food in the air. It was a good sign. We arrived on a Thursday early evening, and I was pleasantly surprised when the hostess told us it would only be a 20 minute wait. We browsed the stores nearby (btw, LOVED the name of Appethaizing, the Thai restaurant across the street) and came back just in time for our name to be called. \\n\\nBefore coming here I hadn't realized that a portion of the restaurant was outdoor covered seating. There were heat lamps above us but they weren't turned on. As the night progressed my husband got chilly and uncomfortable. We ordered the chicken wings, papaya salad, pork belly curry with a side of sticky rice, and pork belly and shrimp vermicelli claypot (I wanted to see how my at-home version compared to the original). The papaya salad arrived first, and damn it is HOT. My mouth was on fire for the rest of the night despite filling up on water; it was very spicy. I ordered it despite reading other reviews that it was just only average and I should have listened, but I disgress. 2.5/5.\\n\\nNext came the much anticipated chicken wings. Delicious? Yes. Best wings I've ever had? Close, but I think San Francisco's San Tung chicken wings still come out on top. I enjoyed the mix of Pok Pok's sweet and salty wings, but I think the saltiness from the fish sauce was a bit too overpowering at times. Nonetheless, they were very meaty and juicy wings which I did appreciate. 4/5\\n\\nThe pork belly curry arrived after and it was a bit underwhelming, both in taste and portion. Husband said it reminded him of a Chinese type stew, which would explain why the taste was familiar to me. For the price ($15), I felt the portion was too small. 3/5. Even worse was the portion of sticky rice we ordered. At $3, I was expecting at least a small bowl, but it came in a little plastic baggie inside a small coin-purse sized pouch. We ended up ordering a side of jasmine rice, which actually did come in a regular bowl. \\n\\nThe vermicelli clay pot was all right. I liked how the sauce caramelized at the bottom. That being said, the noodle portion was also small; I don't think you'd be able to split this dish between more than 2 people. I would say try making this dish at home and you could get the same results. 3.5/5\\n\\nAgain, I realllly wanted to love this place but unfortunately it just wasn't mind blowing. Service was okay; our server took a long time to bring us our bill and change. The wings were probably the best part of the meal, but given that the recipe is available in my cookbook at home, I probably won't be in too much of a rush to drive back down to Portland. Good wings, okay other food, okay service, so-so value. Oh yes and parking is a nightmare; fortunately we only had to circle around the block once before finding a spot in the residential area.

I waited at least 15 minutes at the host stand before being greeted and seated, along with an appalling wait of over an hour for my food to be prepared and served.  Once the meal was served I never saw my waitress again and had to approach someone to receive the bill.  I was never offered replenishment of my drink or a refill of my water.  Food was prepared well and tasted good.  Dessert was skipped due to length of visit.  \\n\\nMy second visit was as a take-out dessert customer during the mid-week and mid-afternoon.  I had to endure a wait of almost 30 minutes for someone to wait on me at the to-go dessert section.  When I approached someone about the situation, I was told that they were extremely busy and that a person would be with me when they could.  I ordered the Boston Cream and it was very good.  \\n\\nOn my most recent, it was a Friday late night visit.  I arrived at 11:00 PM, well after the dinner rush.  My group of two was seated promptly.  During the next 30 minutes I observed a group of guests next to me attempt to get the attention of the wait staff no less than 5 times and were absolutely ignored each time.  The dining room was about half filled with most guests being in one large group.  The wait staff was moving around the dining room, but did not spend much more than a few minutes before heading off someplace out of sight.  After waiting 30 minutes without anyone coming to my table to even take a drink order, I decided that it was time to end my wife's suffering and leave.  Before departing, I felt obligated to both help the group next to me find some relief and to point out how appalling the experience I had.  I went to a staff member and asked to speak with the manager.  The manager came to greet me and identified himself as Jason.  I explained to him the experience I had and the trouble my fellow guests were still having.  I explained to him how disappointed I was in the locations performance.  I explained to him that I perform reviews in several different media outlets and he tried to offer me complimentary gifts or discounted service- both which I declined to maintain integrity of my reviews.\\n\\nOverall, I would HIGHLY recommend NOT visiting this location, unless you have plenty of extra time.

Another benefit is you can balance out your espresso high with beer, which they have on draft.

But more importantly, our waiter was willing to entertain his request to order in Mandarin, despite the waiter's proficiency in English.\\n\\nBut enough about my night, let's talk food. Dishes here are family style, meaning you get a big dish for everyone to share. A big bowl of rice is complimentary (another mark of authenticity). You can't come here and not get duck, so we ordered the roast duck, which was just $10.95. WHAT A STEAL! Just enough for two hungry guys to split. The duck was absolutely fantastic, but the juices at the bottom of the plate are KEY to the experience. Make sure you cover your duck pieces and rice with it, it's PURE FLAVOR. Oh, you're done with the duck and there's still juices left? HALLELUJAH!!! Fill your bowl up with some rice, and pour ALL THE JUICES and tiny meat pieces on the rice. Mix that stuff up, and get ready to scarf down the best god damn rice you've ever had in your LIFE! SO GOOD.\\n\\nWe also ordered the BBQ Pork Lo Mein, which was really good too. The bean sprouts gave it a wonderful crunch to contrast the softness of the noodles. And you could really taste the pork too!\\n\\nEating here tonight reminded me of China... it's pretty damn good.

No salt or ketchup needed. I had the double belgian waffle with fresh fruits of the day (blackberries, strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries). The thickness was regular and it was a bit crispy and a little on the drier side then usual. They gave plenty of fresh fruits which I love because other brunch places gives you a few pieces only.

It (oddly enough) reminded me of the chinese style squid balls. I liked it a lot, but I am not entirely sure if the strong flavor would suit everyone. I also wonder if the flavor would be better if it were dressed in red wine sauce instead of the classic red tomato sauce.\\n\\nThe fra diavolo had one small lobster, along with clams, mussels, calamari, and plenty of pasta. It was definitely very filling. The flavor was definitely on spot; fresh seafood with a hearty tomato sauce that wasn't too overpowering. My only complaint is that my lobster tail was just a tad overdone. The tail meat was slightly chewy (just slightly). Otherwise the dish was just about as good as it gets. \\n\\nI compared my dish to the full portion version on the table next to me. I feel that I got probably about 60-70% of the portion as the other one. Surely, if you can get two people to share, ordering the full portion version (which is now $76) will definitely give you the better deal. But for a plate with a whole lobster and tons of other goodies, $52 isn't a terrible deal (and certainly enough food for two people if they aren't looking to stuff themselves like I did).

I know that doesn't hold true for everyone and that plenty of people want to have thousands of books taking up entire rooms in their homes, but I'm just not wired that way.  I do read a lot though, so I spent some time looking at staff picks, doing some general browsing, and making mental notes of what to look into more to download to my tablets.\\n\\nAfter a while I went to find my mother who was browsing around for ancient hebrew books.  She had a stack of books that she was interested in.  This of course presented an interesting problem as we were on a road trip with little room in the car.  We still had several more days to go that would involve lots of camping, disc golf, and an increasingly dirty car that we would spend some nights sleeping in.  Not the ideal place to keep huge books.  The solution to this problem?  Buy one or two of the books she was interested here and order the rest from Amazon to be conveniently shipped to our house.  I believe she did get better prices on the ones she bought at Powell's, so that is a plus.\\n\\nPowell's does a great job at what it does...it's a huge, must visit tourist spot with an amazing book selection that you won't physically find anywhere else.

The inside of Luna is fairly small, and most people who live in the area all seem to like this place as much as we do bc it is literally overflowing on Saturdays and Sundays (even in the dead of winter, it's fairly common to see people huddled together out front waiting for their table). \\n\\nAs long as you can deal with that, the service (contrary to some of the other reviews here) has been generally excellent in my experience. We're often greeted by the manager (who may also be the owner, but sadly I've yet to ask), and despite crazy crowds we are usually seated fairly quickly (though that's also because it's usually just the fiancee and I, suppose if we came with a brunch army, it would be a different story). In fact, when we are kept waiting, we have often been given complimentary pastries to hold us over. Bonus points. \\n\\nAnd on that note, on to the food. Everything we've tried here has been excellent. The fiancee usually goes for the healthy wrap, and I, as I do at most brunch spots, go for the eggs benedict. I've also had sandwiches (the grilled cheese is particularly tasty). They also have a great fruit bowl, which seems like it should be easy, but it's surprising how many places just overload any fruit bowl with mushy melon + honey dew.\\n\\nBeyond brunch/lunch, live music in the late afternoon and evening, along with a good selection of beer and wine, is another reason to check out Luna.

There are two locations, one in Midtown and another in Decatur - I went to the Decatur one with a friend for a late lunch around 3pm. It has a decent location and decor inside is neat and fitting the Thai connection. We went there to eat sushi of course, so that might've been the mistake aha...\\n\\nAnyhows, we were super hungry, had bought a $22 Mint2 Lover's Sushi Boat experience for Two, which includes edamame, soup (or salad) and a two rolls of sushi (1 California & 1 Spicy Tuna) and 10 pcs of sushi and 12 pcs of sashimi \\"chosen by the chef\\". Seemed like a good deal...the price is supposedly $45 retail without coupon! The included miso soup was good but in a tiny rice bowl only 1/2 filled, the two rolls of sushi tasted bland and were barely 1\\" in diameter, the sashimi was chosen probably cause they are left over tiny pieces of meat...overall, cool presentation in the boat but not re-visit worthy.\\n\\nThe waitress we had was really nice though (she had a tattoo of Boston on her wrist), we did order 3 beers to drink total - they were super expensive at $9/bottle, omg! That is where they get you I guess...wow! Total came to $22+$30=$52 for two people for lunch! Too expensive for low quality food. Can't imagine if I paid full price...Yikes!

Plunged into brunch-related depression, we ordered orange juice and scanned the dinner menu with heavy hearts. \\"I really can't have any eggs benedict?\\" Roommate 1 wheedled when she returned. \\"No... I'm sorry.\\" \\"I was really jonesing for a good eggs benedict.\\" \\"Yeah...\\" \\"Okay, well, I think we need some more time to look at this dinner menu.\\" \\n\\n\\"Oh,\\" said our waitress. \\"We're actually not serving dinner yet.\\"\\n\\"So... we're too late for brunch and too early for dinner.\\"\\n\\"Right.\\"\\n\\"What kind of food are you serving now?\\"\\n\\"Salad.\\"\\n\\"Yeah...

After waiting outside for a few minutes and sharing our brunch horror story with the sympathetic owner, we were seated at an outdoor table and presented with a diverse list of breakfast delights that included the much sought-after (lobster!) eggs benedict. The Belgian waffles were also a hit, airy and delicious, and I'm pretty sure the seasoning on the home fries that accompany the egg dishes is a mixture of herbs and powdered happiness. Also be sure to try the cinnamon muffins (presented free of charge by the owner \\"just because you guys are so nice\\") and the made-with-real-chocolate milk. \\n\\nThe only things that keep Cafe Luna from attaining the coveted 5th star are the prices ($3 for a miniature side cup of fruit seems a little steep) and the somewhat inattentive service.

I tend to focus in the food, rather than the decor/atmosphere (unless it's horrid), but I'm finishing my martini, so I have a moment to spare . The inside is fairly modern....clean lines, minimal decor but with a lot of wood so it doesn't feel cold or univiting at all.

They opened up about 3 1/2 months ago, Max moved to the US from Israel about four years ago, and he plans on ramping up the interior sometime soon as he feels it's a bit too 80s. \\n\\nThe conversation I had with Max aided in the four star review, as he was an easygoing guy who seemed to take a lot of pride in his food. And let me say the food was really good. I got myself a pepargit on a Laffa. All of which was cooked fresh, the chicken and vegetables. I had garlic mayo and spicy schug as sauces, and they complimented the wrap really well. Overall, it was a very filling meal with pretty unique but authentic tasting flavors. There are a number of other items on the menu that looked great and will for sure be tasting. \\n\\nPS Falafels made fresh nightly!

I have always had great service here, so it doesn't really matter where you sit.  There will usually be a wait to get in, however - I find that a positive.

My Cuban sandwich tasted so odd and realized they put cheez whiz instead of Swiss. Once again she said they ran out of Swiss cheese and brought me this instead.

After weddings, 1st birthday (Dol) is the second biggest event in Korean progeny's life.  \\nAnyway, here is the bottom line for this restaurant.  We went there to try a couple of dishes from the party buffet menu.  They have pretty decent Korean BBQ and Seafood pancake is not too shabby, but everything else is mediocre.  Japchae was very salty and side dishes were equally lame.  You'd think they'd give us a better food to earn our business, but we guessed wrong.  My husband had Salmon Terriyaki and it was terrible.  It was cooked too long and the terriyaki dressing was yucky.  It's still much better than Jang Soo Jang in Burlington, MA, though.  \\nOverall, the place is a bit depressing inside and out.  The interior is very dark and it doesn't look great from outside either.  It's located in a strip mall.

It comes highly recommended from both the online community and by word of mouth.\\n\\nHere's a tip, you can make reservations.  Not sure how well the reservations work, but do be prepared to wait otherwise.\\n\\nTHE FAVORITES:\\n- Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings - I'm Vietnamese and I have to say these are one of the best variations that I have ever had.\\n- Muu Paa Kham Waan (rib-eye) - OMG, this is spicy, but it's good enough to fight the heat.  It's grilled rib-eye in a tangy fish sauce.\\n- Pork Curry in Ginger Sauce - this is a non-coconut milk based curry, but it is chalked full of flavor.  It is a bit heavy in ginger flavor.\\n- Coconut Rice - Great steam rice with lots of coconut flavor\\n- Water - Oregon tap water is great on it's own, but when infused with coconut flavor, it's excellent.  Note that this is free water, not coconut water, but rather water with coconut flavor.\\n\\nTHE LOWS:\\n- Papaya Salad - Lacked in flavor and I have had many variations of this dish, this one just lacked in the flavor dimensions.\\n- Pok Pok Roasted Cornish Hen - This one lacked in flavor, as well.  While the hen was moist, it needed more salt and aromatics.\\n\\nTHE OKS:\\n- Cha Ca La Vong (Turmeric Vietnamese Fish) - This is a pretty decent interpretation of a Vietnamese classic.  I like to wrap the fish in rice paper, here it is served over a bowl of rice noodles and greens.\\n\\nOverall, we had a great experience.  The service was friendly and attentive.  The portions I would say are a bit small.  However, the food is pretty authentic and for the most part - full of flavor.

Just when I thought I found all the cool places near my house, heres another hidden away. I only found this because I stopped at the Dr's office where my wife works so she could draw my blood. Which is 4 miles from my house. It was noon so we decided to go to lunch together. While she was tossing my tubes in the machine I was looking on Yelp. I didnt have time to read reviews but I saw this place was 1 mile away. I noticed it had very mixed reviews at a quick glance. But I was already off to a bad start. My forearms were leaning on a table in the lab area while I was looking at my cell phone and my wife mentions I may wanna wash my arms. She was just pouring urine in vials on this table.\\n\\nFu%@ing awesome!! Now I have pissy covered forearms (not literally). So lunch is already off to a bad start. It couldnt get any worse. Might as well try this place. So after a thorough forearm washing we were off.. \\n\\nI'm not sure how people find this place. In fact when I pulled in my wife said \\"I've never been in this shopping plaza before.\\" lol. Yes we have, a million times.. This place is just on the other side of Hurricane wings, First watch, ect. So we never knew it was there.\\n\\nThe place its self I say is 4 stars. But the service brought it up to 5 stars. The burgers are awesome, they had a big selection of beer if thats your thing. Dart boards, Pool tables, both inside and out. They have out side seating, a massive bar. But seating on the inside I could see getting crowded on a Friday or Saturday night. The Juke Box is a really cool idea. You simply download a app on your phone called Touchtunes. While you're sitting at your table you can use your cell phone to select songs on the Juke Box. I downloaded the app and had music playing before our food even came out. It's a nice touch being able to listen to what you want to through out your whole meal, and never actually having to get up and walk over to the Juke Box.\\n\\nThe service we saw was not the bad service I read about in other reviews. The cook (i think thats who he was) I noticed walked over to other customers and asked them how everything was. He brought our food out to us and asked us how we were doing as well.. Our waitress was Amanda. She was on the ball. I cant even count how many times she came around to see if we were okay. Super friendly too. \\n\\nOur bill was $38.55 for two burgers. Personally I think thats a little high for just burgers. BUt I did leave a $7 tip. So it was actually $31.55. \\nThen again these arent some 5 guys burgers that will send you off to the bathroom a hour later. I think hers was $14 and mine was $12, and drinks. \\n\\nI would definitely recommend.

After that they could have served me toast and accidentally set my hair on fire, and I still would have given Fife a good review.  If you don't want to read anymore, just know you should check out Fife, good food, excellent service, and a nice location.\\n\\nFife is located in a great neighborhood, Beaumont.  It was my first visit, being a 'Couv' resident.  I would suggest if you are making the drive to Beaumont, make it an early dinner, go an hour or so early, and walk along Freemont to check out the stores.  There is a pub across the street from Fife, that looked fun for a before or after dinner ale, sitting outside no less.  We went on a Thursday night, and something tells me if you are not living in the 'hood, a week night might be your best bet, as I would guess that this place is hopping on the weekends with locals.  We had no problem getting in, there were open tables during our stay, and it wasn't too loud.  This is a casual place, but comfortable enough that you could be little dressed up for a date night.\\n\\nBack to my ice bucket and white wine, to start the service at Fife was excellent, from the hostess who sat us (gave us the best seat in the house) to our server.  Our server was knowledgeable and was comfortable giving recommendations when we asked.  She recommended an excellent white Italian wine, and helped us choose our entrees when we were having a problem choosing between two.  All good recommendations.  I'll tell you about dessert in a moment.  Oh yeh, the wine.  The wine was served at the perfect temperature (not ice cold, almost at room temperature), so you could really taste it.  My concern after my tasting is that it was going to get too warm too fast sitting on our table.  Its been so long since someone has offered to put a bottle of white wine on ice, and I've just gotten accustom to having it plunked down on the table right after the server pours, that I have assumed they don't offer to ice it anymore, anywhere.  I was fretting over this (I realize I might need to get a life), and our server, as if she were reading my mind, asked if I would like the bottle in an ice bucket.  Thank you, Gods of the Culinary World, good service isn't dead.\\n\\nOk, I know I've obsessed over this small act of great service, so let me quickly say the food at Fife is very good and worth the visit.  The ingredients are simple, straightforward, and dishes are kept to just a few items.  No fancy sauces or multiple ingredient entrees to express some culinary imagination.  My party of 3 all ordered something different, and I sampled.  Tomato crusted cast iron chicken was very flavorful and juicy.  Rock fish with fava shoots and lentils was melt in your mouth.  I was originally going to recommend that we go somewhere else for dessert, but after the meal and on suggestion of our server (whom by now I worship) we stayed, and had something referred to as a Caramel Alfredo...something like that.  It was perfect, and one of those dishes I thought I would just sample then put my spoon down (you know, retain that girlish figure), but I just couldn't help going back for one more spoonful, which turned into 5 or 6.  Creamy, but with substance and a perfect light caramel flavor.\\n\\nPricing is good, and all dishes are priced about the same, give or take a dollar, so you make your decision based on what you want to eat, not on what you want to spend.  Fife is a repeat, and worthy of a visit from my foodie brother in San Francisco."},{"name":"MF Sushi Atlanta","address":"299 N Highland Ave NE, Ste K","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Check out my pics.

After our experience that night it became glaringly clear to all of us, who all work in restaurants, as to why the long wait. We headed to the Whiskey to wait. Service there was prompt and very friendly. We had a few rounds and the obligatory order of wings which were perfectly prepared.  However given there was 4 of us and 6 wings..well..y'all know what that leads to..the suspense of who was gonna go for the 5th and 6th wing was abound.. unfortunately so was the disturbingly loud, fast, and super whiny music trebling it's way through our attempts to suppress it. Ahhh-our table is finally ready at Pokpok...\\n\\nWe sat for about 10 min before our waiter came over-not cool. Maybe they do that on purpose assuming diners need xtra time to \\"ingest the menu'' when in fact, the long wait for a table inherently offers plenty of study time, and frankly most people who just waited an hour for a table are more than eager to get things started.   Anywho, the flavors,textures of all the dishes we ordered were awesome.However everyone agreed that everything was extremely salty.  Though Thai food is expected to be highly seasoned there is a difference between well seasoned and SALTY.  As someone who cooks professionally, I would bet that all the items are seasoned to order-which sometimes is not necessary if the components going into each dish are already skillfully seasoned, add to that a line cook with a heavy hand and you end up with screamingly salty final plates.  Bummer.  \\n    Another issue involving execution is that the ribs we got were all so pinch√©...very small and some didn't have any meat on them at all-just bone! Why would those even make it on the plate? Given some meat is bound to fall off during roasting, it is really up to the cook executing the order to ensure that the ribs they are cooking/plating actually have meat on them.   \\n   Saltiness and missing meat aside, the food we shared was flavorful -operative word: Shared.  Pok Pok's concept is Thai street food intended to be eaten by hand, shared family style, and tends to be very sticky: So, why so stingy on the napkins man? Eating sticky food with your hands, passing plates, serving yourself, and trying to grab hold of a drink all with the aid of one measly paper napkin?-no bueno.  None of us could believe, given their chosen concept, that they only give you one paper napkin each.  The stickfest was unbearable and our waiter never came around to give us more-finally got some from the bar.   Suggestion: linen napkins.   Another fundamental necessity that the food at Pok Pok totally demands yet the front of house staff totally failed to provide was adequate WATER.  For a place that knowingly serves spicy and possibly unknowingly salty food-ya gotta keep your people watered!  By the time we got sufficient napkins and water we were done eating-that's unacceptable.  We then proceeded to sit there with our table cluttered with dirty plates for at least 20 minutes.  No wonder it takes forever for a table at Pok Pok!  They don't clear tables promptly--total no brainer.  \\n     Still no sign of our waiter, and wanting desperately to be cleared, have dessert and to pay so we could move on; we had to ask the host to clear our table.  We also ordered via the Host the dessert (with a candle) that our b-day girl had spotted during our menu study hour.  About 5 minutes went by when stranger danger of a waiter finally cleared us and asked about dessert.  Trying to maintain the surprise element, I quietly told him of the dessert plus candle that we had already ordered.  Another 10 minutes goes by, still no dessert.   Completely over it, we flagged him down, asked him for our bill and asked him what was up with dessert.  He said they couldn't find any matches to light the candle. really?!?  Come on now..there are plenty of sources of flame in a kitchen or use one of the 50+ candles all over the restaurant! I gave him my matches and told him to keep them. When dessert did finally arrive, the ice cream was completely melted.  It had to have sat in the window the entire time. Why would you still serve that? \\n   After not enjoying our dessert soup, we waited another agonizing 10 min to finally get the bill and it was only after flagging him down again!  Payment was on the table within 30 seconds, but you guessed it..he never came back to collect it!  Another no brainer: If a guest asks for the check chances are they want to pay too! Wow.  \\n   As we eagerly headed the F out of Pok Pok, we passed multiple parties waiting for a table and couldn't help but remark that they all could have finished eating by now if only the staff at Pok Pok had a clue about how to provide prompt service and how to turn tables with expediency. All pretty simple stuff: They take way too long to take your order, way too long to clear you, way too long to bring you dessert, way too long to bring you the check and way too long to let you pay.

Despite loving food and trying new things in food I had never once had even the slightest interest in trying Indian food.  However, living near Thai Orchid and going there frequenly back when it used to be worth going to, I would see Amul India and think I should finally try it.  Well, one day I did and talked my wife into going with me.  Long story short, I loved Indian food and my wife hated it.  She didn't hate Amul India, just Indian food in general.  She is low on culinary adventure and lower on spicy food.  To each her own I guess, but I really enjoyed it.  The Chicken Tikka Masala was great as were several vegetarian dishes that we ordered.  Unfortunately, I cannot remember any of the names as I order by ingredients.  Dishes with peas and chickpeas were good across the board and the samosas are very nice too.  I have gone back several times for take out and the food is prepared quickly and the order has never been wrong.  Just a few weeks ago I went into the place foor lunch buffet and also really enjoyed it.  Got to try two new things (chicken dish similar to a very spicey sweet and sour chicken and a green pea based dish) Both were really enjoyable.  Now the truth is that I have never eaten at another Indian restaurant so I don't claim to know where this place rates.

I'm not vegan but do enjoy healthy eating from time to time, and Life Alive did not disappoint! \\n\\nFood: 5 stars. I had the Green Goddess, Demi-plate, and it was delicious! Greens were perfectly cooked- not over- or under-done. Tofu was in nice, bite-size pieces. And the ginger sauce - oh the sauce- had a slight spicy, tanginess to die for! I'd say I could make this at home but the dish was really perfected by the sauce, so I'll keep coming back. \\n\\nAmbiance: 4 stars. I didn't come here for fine dining so it met its goal.

In typical fashion I opted for a cranberry mojito.  It was great.  The first and third drinks were better than the second, but the only thing missing from the second was a bit of the fruit.  I felt that the rum overpowered the rest of the drink just a tad bit-- not even enough to complain about, but who really complains when a beverage is strong, yet still drinkable?  Certainly not I.  A friend got the Bulleit Manhattan, which looked great (I didn't try it), and then a lemon drop that filled the air around it with a very pleasant lemony odor.  The Bombay Sapphire and tonics were also perfectly mixed.\\n\\nOur appetizer was the gluten free Calamari.  It came out quickly and tasted great.  I really liked that the mini-squids were small.  I am not a fan of them being too large and overpowering.  I know it's the same exact thing, but something about the arms just get me.\\n\\nFor my meal I had the steak sandwich with a side of fries.  Talk about small victory!  I haven't had french fries out to eat in MONTHS.  It was like heaven!  The steak was nice and tender, cooked perfectly.  The bread was a tasty and very non-typical gluten free bun, and I wish I thought to ask about it. \\n\\nJust when I didn't think my  meal could get better, they offered a gluten free Creme Brulee.  Way better than birthday cake, if you ask me.\\n\\nOur waiter was AWESOME.  Aside from being personable and nice, he was accommodating.  This goes far when you have people with food allergies, and I wish a lot of the restaurants/bars that don't know how to do it right would take a lesson from the staff at Burton's.   All of our questions, no matter how mundane, were checked and double-checked.  Given the fact that we knew they took their gluten free menu seriously, this didn't come as a surprise.  \\n\\nOur service was also great.  Our waiter had a great balance of table presence-- we definitely weren't ever looking for him for anything.  He showed up at the right time every time, like there was a homing device on our table that let him know when our drinks needed refilling.  He was also very personable.  You could tell that he liked his job and was happy.  He had great conversation and was able to give a little of the joking around back to us.  I wish I remembered his name, because he was awesome.\\n\\nI will definitely come back here, and highly recommend it to anyone who is gluten free that misses the small comforts of being able to go to a bar and have a burger and fries, or who is looking for something a bit more sophisticated."},{"name":"Tapenade Bistro","address":"3711 Bayview Street","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"Awesome food and awesome service!

We recently had dinner the week after Christmas, and loved it, as usual. We had our honeymoon in Thailand, and I have taken Thai cooking classes for the last 10 years, and this is one of the few Thai restaurants I truly love in the US. \\n\\nOur favorites: the Vietnamese fish sauce wings--get them spicy, as they aren't Thai level spicy, just have the right amount of heat that way. These are always my favorite bites of the night.  The \\"Sii Khrong Muu Yaang\\" ribs were fantastic, and we especially loved the two dipping sauces that came alongside. The ribs weren't too fatty, and tasted great. The \\"Sai Ua Samun Phrai\\" pork sausage comes with a green chili dip and blanched vegetables--it works best if you make a little packet with a cabbage leaf, some green chile sauce, a piece of the sausage, and some vegetables. \\n\\nThe biggest surprise was the \\"Phak Bung Fai Daeng\\", or Red Fire Water Spinach. We asked our server for a suggestion of a good veggie side, and she recommended this. We loved the flavor, and it balanced our the meat dishes perfectly. \\n\\nAlso don't skip trying the Som drinking vinegars--they are unexpectedly very delicious. My sister had the black pepper, and I was very skeptical, but when I tasted it, was surprised to love it. It's the perfect mix of sweet and sour/acidic to go with Thai flavors and clean your palate. \\n\\nThe only miss this time was the \\"Khanom Jiin Naam Yaa Jay\\". It was a soupy noodle dish with curry sauce, but was a bit mild and neutral for our tastes--just didn't stand out with all of the other things we loved. \\n\\nMake sure you get there early for dinner to put your name in, as the wait can be very long, and they don't take reservations for parties less than 6.

I like the ambience and atmosphere there, inside it's like a saloon that's been upgraded and redecorated.  The outside seating is nice but it's way too hot and humid, and the tent outside is really cool too if you can stand the heat.  They had several appetizers for 1/2 off (or $4 each) and we btwn several of us we shared the fried brie (very good), roasted garlic (awesome), and fried calamari (excellent).  I had a couple of drinks that were also HH specials, but since I'm not much of a drinker I don't have an opinion on those. \\n\\nMy 2nd visit was a couple of Sunday's ago for their Brunch - - which is supposedly one of the best in town - - and it certainly didn't disappoint!  It can get quite crowded inside so I suggest getting there early or visiting a little later (after 1pm), and always expect people in lines for the great food.  \\n\\nThey had an assortment of eggs, pastries, sandwiches, kolaches, fruit, comfort foods, waffles, potatoes, jalepeno sausage, muffins, and my favorite - - smoked salmon (which goes fast).  It's hard not to try one of everything there - which I do not recommend - unless you're prepared to loosen your belt.  The service was pretty good - my drink was filled, but the brunch was self service.  Parking can be a drag during the busy hours since they don't have a private lot (street parking), but they do have valet (yeah, but that's 2 gallons of gas).  \\n\\nSo if you're looking for a good place to eat brunch w/ a crowd, or some nice deals on happy hour appetizers, I highly recommend checking out Moonshine Patio Bar and Grill!"},{"name":"Thuyen Vien","address":"Mills 50 1216 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Great food!

Once I finally placed the order for our water, it took another 10 minutes for them to finally bring us our water. Without lemons.

We stopped here on Saturday about 1pm  in search of  an \\"authentic\\" Greek restaurant, lke the sign out front says.  We typically go to the Corner Greek in Cambridge which is always good food but as we're on the N Shore, it isn't always convenient and the parking can be tough.  So after passing this place several times, we gave it a try.  First and LAST time.  No hostess at the desk when we entered, no sign telling you to seat yourself so after standing there waiting a few minutes, we  finally went and sat down in a booth. The wait service was slow, no smile from the server when she finally showed.  The menu read more like a Dennys or diner than Greek.  I ordered the Gyro whch I later learned was not lamb and beef like at Corner Greek, but pork.   Nothing on the menu saying what it was, and granted, I should have asked, but...And very dry, tasteless pork at that.  I can't eat pork so after a couple of bites and flagging the unsmiling server and asking, back it went and she then brought me a chicken gyro whcih was even more tasteless.   My partner had a turkey sandwich which he described as 'meh', with a shrug of his shoulders.  Described  on the menu as ' roasted turkey', it looked like pre-packaged deli meat from Shaws.  Menu lists both meals as \\"with fries' but I think we got about 5 fries each.  AND - the catsup was so watered that it flowed out of the bottle like milk.   Ugh.   Server never checked on us to see if we needed anything during the meal and while she wasn't rude or nasty, she was just going thru the motions (barely).  The place has terrible accoustics - the noise level is jarring.  The food is WAY WAY WAY too overpriced for the quality and this was a totally unpleasant experience.  Back to the Corner Greek it is, for us.  Way better food for less money.\\n\\nWould welcome recommendations for other (good) Greek restaurants in the North of Boston area that we haven't discovered yet.

I thought I was going to bite into a big fatty jelly donut sort of toast with berry goodness oozing out of it but it was just a sandwich, albeit a very good French Toast sandwich. Also, by mixed berry they really mean all strawberries with 1 blackberry (really, I only found ONE!). Granted, I just got half of a normal French Toast order but come on, 1 blackberry for 6.50?! I don't know if it was that delicious enough to go back for more but the presentation of the FT was very unique. The home fries were slightly too charred and overseasoned but it did me that saltiness to balance my very very sweet stuffed French Toast. \\n\\nDrinks: Cap was okay but my friend got the Pumpkin Spiced Latte that was perfectly sweet for me (she thought it was okay)!!! GAH! \\n\\nOverall, the food is good/okay but definitely NOT CHEAP. Sorry, I'm used to Hash House sort of deals where you pay 7-12 bucks for a meal the size of ones upper torso. I'll probably take out of towners to this place for a once in a while kind of deal (the atmosphere is cramped but nice and breakfasty) but its not what I would consider my personal go-to place for brunch. \\n\\nI feel bad for taking off 2 stars because its really not a horrible place and nothing is exceptionally wrong with the food/service.

Now...I've never heard of Thai meatballs. Or tried them.  But hey, we decided to be different and try it.  My advice?  Skip it.  Order the wings (which you DO have the option of ordering in the bar).  Soon enough it would become clear that I would probably just skip the restaurant and go to the bar for the wings in the future!\\n\\nFast forward to the restaurant: we ordered spicy fish sauce wings, papaya salad, and some Neua Naam Tok (spicy and sour beef dish). \\n\\npapaya salad:  This is definitely NOT how papaya salad should be.  One of my close gf's is Laos so I've spend a LOT of time with her family and ate a LOT of papaya salad.  I believe the flavor of papaya salad should be strong, spicy, the flavors should be balanced so you can detect each ingredient on its own if you try to.  This papaya salad was nothing like that.  I was dubious if there was even any fish sauce or shrimp paste in there!  This is ok if you just want a moist, crunchy side dish to eat with your rice.  But it's definitely not true papaya salad.  All in all, I found it to be pretty bland, however it did taste very fresh..\\n\\nNow..the wings!  Those were delicious.  I was real hesitant to eat something called fish sauce wings, because as other yelpers have posted, fish sauce is extremely pungent.  Usually I cook with it or in dipping sauces it is balanced with spice, lime, and sugar.  However...I dunno what they did with these wings but they were so good.  SO GOOD!  However...they weren't that spicy.

The weird thing is that people weren't forming a line, but more of a huge gaggle without any apparent order. A few minutes past opening (always unacceptable to hungry patrons), some employees came out and starting to take some names and gave some beepers out. It got more weird because not everyone got one and it seemed like people were ready to bum-rush the door because of the confusion. When they finally opened the door, it was almost as if the beepers and waiting list didn't matter since they were seating everyone as they went in (again, there was no real line so someone could get a spot you could have wanted).

I would consider myself a hummus connoisseur and this was a hit to me. \\n\\nThe cucumber tomato salad - 4.5/5 stars. On point on all levels. Acidic, fragrant, crisp, refreshing- everything you could ask for. \\n\\nThe rice - 4/5 stars. Fluffy, warm, aldent√©. \\n\\nThe Falafel - 4.5/5 stars. Really good, fresh flavors. Crisp, steamy, and fluffy all in the right places.  \\n\\nIn conclusion, I paid $15 for this plate. It would have been totally worth it if the meat was cooked perfectly, but... it wasn't. When I think shawarma I think juicy, hot, and succulent. This was dry, warm, and chewy.

I reviewed the Easton location and gave it 5 stars... but for the Bexley location - I have to break my own heart a little and only give it 2 stars... \\n\\nSo, let me talk about the location a moment. The parking lot terrifies me. There are two parking spots that are awkwardly located to where they back out into the entrance. It terrifies me that I am going to have someone back into me while I'm entering - I never park in these spots. The location is pretty standard for Piada inside but - I am going to be a little bitchy - the stone they cook the piadas on is cracked in two places. It looks terrible. It may not effect the cooking of a piada but it affects my opinion of the location - it looks like they don't care that it's cracked.\\n\\nNow, let's talk about the service. My last visit was a party of two and it was late and they were 15 minutes from closing. \\n\\nI accept that - but they had only 1 piada left to serve. We ordered two piada - and were told they could only make one - with no alternative offered. \\n\\nLiterally, the chef (well, he was in a chef's jacket) look at us with a blank expression and offered no alternatives to the dilemma of an order for two piada and only 1 available to make. We had to make the suggestion that we get a \\"Take Two\\" instead. \\n\\nThe kitchen staff seemed to be disorganized or distracted by the late hour - my order of crispy chicken wasn't begun when the chef placed it with them. My piada was very nearly wrapped with no meat inside at all - only by me paying close attention and stopping it from being wrapped prevented the mistake.\\n\\nI've been to this location a few times and have help off reviewing it in hopes that I was just visiting on an off day - but after this last visit - I see a pattern of poor management and lack of a culture focused on customer service. I hope this isn't going to spread to the other Piada locations - it'd be a crying shame."},{"name":"True Food Kitchen","address":"222 West Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great restaurant with the best ambiance!

Tossed with braised short rib, grilled lobster pieces, and oyster mushrooms, the noodles are succulent, soft, and bursting with flavor, while the short rib is moist, tender, and juicy. At $33 it is a pricey dish, but a memorable one. I have been in the winter when it wasn't in season, so it doesn't seem to be offered year round. Other dishes I've tried:\\n\\nClam chowder: delicious. A little less creamy than the chowder at Legal Seafoods. The bacon is a nice touch that adds a saltiness and depth of flavor to the chowder.\\nOyster slider: crispy, crunchy deep fried oyster in a brioche roll = two-bite perfection. Only wish it were bigger! \\nScallops entree: probably my least favorite dish. The scallops were well-cooked, but I tend to find the flavors too delicate for my liking.

By far the most \\"meh\\" dish I've ever had with a $17 price tag.\\n\\nCorn Cabbage Pancake - nice and delicious, reminds me of the croquettes you get at Guu restaurant, which are half the price.  It was very nice, but I felt overcharged.  I was really wanting to taste the umeboshi plum and shisho leaf, but could barely detect it in the mayo they whipped it into.\\n\\nBurdock Chicken - in house favourite.  I like a spiciness of it, the addition of kim chee.  I'm guessing the burdock was the thin slices brownish slices on the plate.  They added nothing to the dish which reminded me of something I could find a a local Chinese restaurant.  Nicely done, but not special to me.\\n\\nI will say desserts were their strong suits.\\n\\nCustard with Ginger Snaps - custard was reminiscent of creme brulee without the crunchy topping.  Two very crisp ginger snaps served with it that were the perfect amount of \\"snap\\" and ginger.\\n\\nAlmond cake - Rich pound cake like quality with nutty flavour, dense texture and crisp crust served with caramel sauce.

Growing up in SF Bay Area, it is mostly eaten at banquets and special occasions or at nicer dim sum places. It needs to be ordered in advance 24 hrs to make it correctly. The skin needs to have a sweet, crispy texture that crunches to the bite with a thin, succulent fatty layer between the rich, tasty, moist duck meat between a hot, steamed bun with scallions and hoisin sauce. My friend ordered it on  whim when we were there on New Years day. I told him it needed to be ordered in advance, but the waitress said ok. I thought no way they could have any, especially if you pay $28 for it. We got a duck alright, but I'm sure it was the regular roast duck. No crunchy skin, too fatty, with dry tasting meat.

Good job stepping up the customer service! \\n\\nI am normally a big fan of this place, but the service I have received lately is sub par. \\n\\nThe waiting process is the absolute worst. \\n\\nIf you get there and are waiting for anyone in your party, they will not seat you. I've watched countless people being seated before my party because we were waiting for one person (who had already given me their order as to not hold anyone up). What could have been an hour long lunch turned into two. No working person has the time for that on a weekday. \\n\\nIf you go during a peak hour, good luck. You will find yourself stuck in a crowd of people with a feeling of needing to push forward as to get the Hostess' attention. Other patrons push their way through the crowd of people to get their name on the list first (even if there is a line), making what should have been a 45 minute wait 1 hour +. The person at the Host desk should be trained to handle the crowd, but this is clearly not the case. \\n\\nWe are regular customers and have left twice because of the awful experience we have had while checking in. \\nOnce you are seated, the service is normally fine; however, good customer service in a restaurant starts when you walk in the door.

In common sense I expected at least the bowl of ramen which was not even finished is off from the bill or some thing. When the server brought the bill he said there was a small discount for the incident, and it turned out it was truly very small discount! 10% discount only from my husband's bowl! The bowl of ramen price is $12.50 and there was $1.25 discount from our total almost $40 bill!! $1.25!!!! We paid 90% of the price for the half eaten ramen with a foreign hair dipped in the soup! It almost feels insulting! Since I couldn't find anyone looked like a manager in the hall and didn't want to make a scene we just paid and left the restaurant.

Afterall, all the hype would have put my hopes up too high and set myself up for larger disappointment instead. Plus, being a meat lover, I've treated myself to several other well-known steak restaurants in Atlanta. But of course I still had to try this \\"best steakhouse in Atlanta\\" before I can make my own judgment. \\nFirst off, the service was very good. We figured we could order an appetizer, lobster fritter, first while we looked over the menu.   My thought was that it will come out a little after we order our steaks. Instead, it came out soon after, before we even had time to look over the menu. Talk about promptness! It was 3 fritters with a dash of sauce on a plate, perfect for the two of us.  Bread basket consisted of 3 different kinds of bread, an onion bread, multigrain, and I think focaccia bread.    \\nAnd then our steaks came.  When I took a bite of my cowboy ribeye steak, I knew I was in for a treat, it was heavenly. We had 3 sides (yes, we went all out that evening), creamed corn, mashed potato and steamed broccoli (no cheese). Jalepeno creamed corn was good and very flavorful. It was a little more on the salty side for my taste and was too salty when I ate it with my steak, but it went very well with both mashed potato and broc.  Mashed potato was creamy but not too heavy, simple just the way I liked it. \\nFor dessert, we split ice cream sandwich(es). There were 3 sandwiches, chocolate cookie with mint choco ice cream, red velvet cookie(cake?) with cheese ice cream, and choco chip cookie with banana ice cream.\\n\\nThe second time I went was with a group of friends and ordered similar menu except for one: Parmesan fried eggplant fries with spicy sauce, it's a must!"},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I don't usually write reviews after one visit unless I've had a decent sampling of their menu by stealing bites off of my friends' plates, but I scrolled through the first page of reviews here, and not one person mentioned the chicken fried steak. \\n\\nIt's the best chicken fried steak I've ever had!

The cocktail list looked fantastic, but unfortunately we abstained. I'm hovering between a 3 and 4 star review--ultimately going for 3 based on the overall cost, which I deem too high for the value. \\n\\nWe ordered (and split) 3 dishes, and it was more than enough for 2 people:\\n\\nDuck confit rolls: while I appreciated the effort to make their own wrapper, the dough was heavy and thick. This made them hard to eat without making a mess, as the dough was chewy rather than crunchy. Perhaps my expectations were off here, but I expected more spring roll and less...burrito. Taste was delicious, although I think a lovely spicy chili sauce on the side would highly elevate this dish. \\n\\nTom Kha: Very yummy, and this is one of my favorite Thai dishes. A little on the sour side for my preference, but really quite good regardless. My only complaint here is that I like a bit of heat in my soup, and this had none. I didn't ask for spice (have learned my lesson in that department at other, sadistic Thai restaurants), but the waiter never asked us about spice during our meal either. \\n\\nRed Curry with Beef: This is my absolute favorite Thai dish, and I was SO DISAPPOINTED that Pon Thai serves this without bamboo shoots! I felt robbed. They also serve this with vegetables that don't normally come in red curry. I have no idea what \\"traditional Thai\\" is, but the aggregate of my many red curry experiences tell me that bamboo shoots are ubiquitous and these veggies were unusual. This is a large portion (it better be for $18). My other major complaint was the beef itself--tough and chewy. And again, the dish wasn't spicy at all. No spice is offered on the table, either. Again, I didn't ask, so I'll take the blame for that. \\n\\nOverall:\\nGreat service (other than the spicy issue)\\nOK food\\nBad value, in my opinion\\nProbably won't be back, expect maybe take-out Tom Kha, medium spicy please."},{"name":"Counter Culture","address":"2337 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Terrific!

The calamari salad is a better option. Monkfish marsala was a strange dish, a bit too sweet for my tastes. Squid ink linguine alla Puttanesca with shrimp was... well, it lived up to its name (Puttanesca basically means \\"the way a whore would make it\\"). Puttanesca has kind of a murky, pungent flavor by default, but mine tasted a bit like dish water, and the shrimp were not exactly fresh. (Perhaps I have an unusually high standard for shrimp, considering my South Carolina upbringing, but there is no reason this place can't get fresh shrimp. Hell, they could walk two blocks and get head-on shrimp from Mercato del Mare.) The pasta itself was overcooked.\\n\\nAnd speaking of supposedly fresh seafood, why is it that the menu never changes? Supposedly there is a summer menu, but the first time I went was in August, and the menu has been the same ever since. The summer menu doesn't seem to be accessible from their website either. Very suspicious. There are never specials, as far as I can tell.\\n\\nI have a feeling that this place has been coasting on reputation for quite a while.

I discovered this place used to be Buns & Shakes, a place I had never visited before because quite honestly, I was scared to visit this part of Atlanta. But I couldn't say no to a $5 Groupon Now! deal so I took a chance. The food was okay. The place was okay. Not enough really to draw me back unless they did another Groupon. Even then, I'd have to weigh my numerous other options very carefully. What could they improve? Let's see...I had a bacon cheeseburger & fries, which was okay. A bit small for its regular price which was about $7. It tasted okay, average flavor, nothing really stood out. But for $7, I could go to Five Guys, get about the same, and it would taste way better and actually fill me up. But I suppose if you're in this area, you're on foot and there's no other options, then this will suffice. The music system is awful. Sounds like they are playing music from a boom box ala Radio Raheem style. I think the surround sound on my television has better sound quality. I saw a flat screen television there in a small corner. It was tiny and not turned on. If they get a couple more of those and actually put them to use, I could see maybe coming here to watch a couple games, maybe. The waitress (a sweetheart) explained they that are still so new, there's more menu items yet to be added and they haven't even had their grand opening yet. Another thing, the name includes bar & lounge, and it probably shouldn't unless they plan on getting a liquor license and actually serving alcohol as they currently do not. There really is no loung-y part to the restaurant, its more of a tiny cafe-like atmosphere. GSU is right down the street and if these new owners are smart, they will cater to that type of crowd, as students could be a constant source of revenue with some improvements in the overall dining experience. After eating, I was extremely nervous just walking back to my car, and this was 2pm in the afternoon on a Sunday!

On the website it says \\"Dont't forget about our Bottomless Mimosas & Specialty Bloody Mary's!\\"   (their typo, not mine for the word \\"don't\\")\\n\\nWhen we got there and reviewed the menu, it said only the Mimosas were bottomless. On the menu it also said the Bloody Marys came with either bakon vodka or pepper vodka. My friend got there before I did and had already placed her Bloody Mary order. I asked her what vodka she chose and she said that the server didn't ask her for her choice. When her drink got there I tasted to see if I was going to order one myself. Her drink was absolutely disgusting. I typically love Bloody Marys. I have had them many ways at many restaurants and up until yesterday, I never tasted a Bloody Mary I didn't like. Everyone tasted their drinks and EVERYONE thought they were gross! The 3 people that ordered the Bloody Marys told the server that they wanted something different. At that point, the owner/chef came to our table, (Jordan Wakefield, we didn't know that at the time) He was visibly irritated. He informed us that he had been making the Bloody Mary mix for 3 years and that he didn't want to take it off our bill. We explained that we didn't want him to take it off the bill, that we just wanted to let them know that it tasted bad and we wanted a different drink. He definitely didn't treat us like valuable customers. He removed the drinks from the table. Then, some of our party ordered the bottomless Mimosas. I have had countless bottomless mimosas at many brunch spots around ATL. These had hardly any champagne. They were so orange. The birthday girl had to send her meal back as well. Her eggs Benedict was overdone. Of course at this point, after the owner being irriated, the server was not going out of her way to be nice either. The rest of the table ordered drinks and we literally watched them sit on the bar for 15 minutes while the server was chatting with another employee. Food and drinks came SO SLOW. The place was NOT busy at all. When we got the bill, they took off 50% of the price of the Bloody Marys and they charged us 17% gratuity. I think it so tacky when a server does that. I used to be a server and another guest is currently a bar tender so we are good tippers. I always tip good, well over 20% even if the situation is bad because I know how it is in that industry. \\n\\nPros:\\nThe BBQ sliders were delicious. The meat was perfect. The \\"white sauce\\" on the table was so freakin good! I put it on my sliders and dipped my fries in it. The gator tail was very good as well.\\n\\nTip: try the BBQ sauces on the table before putting it on your food. The signature sauce is very smoky in flavor (sounds good, but trust me, it really isn't) \\n\\nIMO, this place does well because it's in a great location in Castleberry and there isn't a lot around there. It's very convenient to the dome. However, if they don't change their attitude and service, they won't get any repeat business. \\n\\nI guess we should have seen it as a red flag when we read on the menu that they only take take stuff off the bill if it's blatantly  cooked incorrectly. It said that people have been abusing the system. Maybe they should look into WHY so many people are sending stuff back. Maybe it's their recipes."},{"name":"Mango Mango Dessert Atlanta","address":"5177-A Buford Hwy NE","city":"Doraville","stars":"4","text":"I'm a fan of dessert, so I came here for some signature Hongkong sweet treats.

We were told that we'd have about a 30-35 minute wait and were given a pager.  We went to the bar and ordered sangria (we tried the cava sangria, which was okay, nothing to write home about).  Our pager was blinking the whole time we sat there, so we figured it would buzz or do something else after our table was ready.  After about 45 minutes, my friend checked on our table... turns out it'd been ready the whole time!  Apparently they can't estimate their wait times very well.\\n\\nWith dinner, we had the red sangria, which was significantly better.  (However, the brandy or whatever else they put in it negatively affected my friend the next day - watch out if you have an adverse reaction to wine mixed with liquor.)  \\n\\nFoodwise, the ceviche de salmon was incredible.  Absolutely delicious.  The cilantro and citrus were perfect with the salmon, and the caviar was a nice little touch.  The atun estilo tartaro (tuna tartare) was really great.  The filetito was so good that my friend, who normally dislikes filet, was raving about it.  \\n\\nFor dessert we had the Flan Lorena, which was a bit citrusy for my taste, but perfect flan consistency, and good when I thought of it as a different dish than my typical flan.

It is a large area and tastefully decorated, but as the night wore on the noise level became a bit much. Thinking about the decor, the ceilings are high, the drapery is sheer and mixed with hardwood floors. All very nice, but not much help in dulling the noise level. It did become difficult at times for the six of us to hear one another at 'appropriate' voice levels. Maybe it was just the night we were there, but the patrons were a bit on the older side. \\nDrinks were prompt and well made, appetizers were prompt as well.

I'm working late....well I don't know, a couple of hours?\\". I don't want to embellish, but I thought the cheap Julie Bowen knock-off hanging all over him was his wife. Who really knows?

Once I recalibrated my expectations and sat at our indoor picnic table, I took a look at the sticky laminate menu, presumably from leftover PBR. Surprisingly, there were choices other than burgers. Nothing overwhelmingly healthy (see the Cheese Head- a four sliced cheese burger which features a cheese injected patty), but I did order a delicious turkey wrap that had brie, apples, honey mustard, lettuce, and tomatoes.

They are quite salty, but I do still find them flavorful and delicious.\\n\\nDuring my second experience here, I went with three of my co-workers and we each ordered different dishes and shared. One of us ordered the cold noodles with fish (which reminded me of fried tofu), the curried noodle soup (which was probably the best of what we ordered), the Pok Pok special (a chunk of hen with papaya salad), an extra order of papaya salad, and I went with the boar dish.\\n\\nUpon receiving my boar, I felt insulted. It was a very tine plate of boar, about the same as or less than an appetizer's serving, with another large plate of an uncooked vegetable covered in ice. The joke of the table was how we paid $14.50 for mostly ice. I would definitely stay away from this item.\\n\\nThe papaya salad was delicious and I like the spiciness of it, but having to pay over $10 for a papaya salad in comparison to other restaurants that serve this isn't very ideal. \\n\\nThe curried noodle soup was probably the best item, but not fantastic. All the entrees were quite salty, and specifically the boar was very salty.  Even after splitting 5 entrees, amongst myself and three other women, we were all still hungry and went somewhere else afterwards (a place that serves fish sauce wings that were just as delicious).  My co-workers are Vietnamese and enjoy good Asian food, and it was two of my co-workers first time eating here. Neither of them were impressed and were actually pretty disappointed. One of them told me about another place that serves fish sauce wings. As we were discussing the saltiness of the food, and the small portion sizes, I looked around and noticed everyone in the restaurant except us was Caucasian. I only mention this to suggest to go out, and try the different hole-in-the-wall Asian restaurants.

I have had a note on my to-do list to 'Yelp Webbers' for at least a week, so here it is.  \\n\\nMe and my girlfriend just moved to SW Vermont Street, down from Webbers, and the nightmare intersection it sits on.  We stopped in one night to get a feel for the local restaurants.  \\n\\nThe waitress was the perkiest one I've ever seen.  The place was empty, but she was still cheerful as a TV character.  We ordered, and shortly got our order...which was not the special.  We had it, and it was great, 2 crispy ruben sandwiches.  We had asked for the one on the board outside, the BBQ special, but this was great.  The waitress realized the mix up, and knocked off  the price of one, which was nice.  \\n\\nWe have been there several times since for breakfast, and we are fans.  It is reminiscent of Gaffers on Barbur Blvd.  If you want stick to your ribs hearty food, this place is it.  Denny's be damned.  This is close, the staff is friendly, and the food is good.  We have not noticed a lack of quality ingredients.  \\n\\nI ordered a take out lunch, and the eggs benedict  was specifically eggs benedict with sausage gravy, not hollandaise or cheese sauce...and it was quite good.  \\n\\nThis is very much truck-stop style dining.  Don't dress up to eat here, and don't expect fast food.  They take their time preparing it, and serving it, and will chat at each table if they feel like it.  \\n\\nWebbers does feel 1970's, but so do most small town diners and restuarants I have been in, and considering it is right on the edge of Portland, I am really glad it is here. \\n\\nWhen we have a lazy Saturday or Sunday morning, and a hunger for some grub, Webbers will be our stop.  That first night, the waitress also brought us out a complimentary plate of BBQ ribs to let us know what we had missed by ordering the special, and pointing to the whiteboard...DAMN.   \\n\\nTry the BBQ.  Just do it.  Slow cooked, and not too spicy.  Busters BBQ on Pacific Highway is good, but feels kind of rushed, and cheffy compared to this, which was more melt off the bone, home-cooked, and sticky.  \\n\\nAlright, there's my 2 cents.  I'll check it off my list, and if I see any other place that catches my eye, I'll let you internet denizens know about it. \\n\\nLOCATION\\nIt is catty corner to the Dublin Pub, behind the Sesame Donuts.\\nOH- One more thing, like I mentioned, Webbers is right at that nightmare intersection where Scholls Ferry Road starts up Sylvan Hill, and Beaverton Hillsdale Highway and Oleson Road cross.  If you are coming up Oleson, turn into  the parking lot with Sesame Donuts, and Radio Shack, it pops you right at Webbers, rather than waiting for the onslought to turn left,then left again.

First off, I know I shouldn't judge a book by its cover, but I had my own stereotypes as to how this place would look. The name of the place didn't lend itself to being casual upscale so I was a bit surprised walking into the restaurant as to how different the vibe was compared to a Bob Loves Thai. It's got a nice, modern twist to traditional Thai decor (complete with a buddha of course). \\n\\nI had the Tom Yam Goong to start. The soup has a nice spicy kick and you can really tell the lemongrass was fresh. The portion size was definitely large enough for two people. \\n\\nI shared my main with my dining partner. We had the Yellow Curry Chicken w/sweet potatoes and a dish of eggplant. The dishes were tasty and the eggplant was very fresh. It didn't however come with enough rice for the amount of curry that came out. The curry:rice ratio was at least 3:1. I had to ask for a second bowl. \\n\\nThe service was by far the most disappointing. When we sat down, the restaurant was busy (we got there at 8:30pm), but not so crazy that the servers were running around like chickens with their heads cut off. My dining partner ordered an alcoholic drink and it took so long to get to our table that we had to remind ANOTHER server that it had been ordered. We looked over at the bar and noticed there wasn't a bartender on staff and the wait staff were basically making their own drinks. WTF? Also, nobody came by to check up on us shortly after our meals came out and even getting a glass of water was slow getting to us. \\n\\nThe kicker was when the bill came, I wanted to see how much the extra rice came out to. But as I was punching the keys on the credit machine, the waitress crumpled up the bill and took it away (WTF? x2). \\n\\nIf it wasn't for the food tasting good, this would have gotten a pretty low score.

Definitely give it a try!\\n\\nOyster sliders - $4 each but definitely worth every penny! It's super small but its a great way to get your appetite going. I loved the fried oyster and pickled cabbage combination!\\n\\nEast Coast Halibut - I personally love mushroom so I enjoyed the base sauce but if you don't like mushroom, you might want to stay away. The fish was cooked to perfection and if I weren't so full by the end of my meal, I probably would have finished the whole thing!\\n\\nLobster Roe Noodles - Strange taste to it. Very sour almost.

The first time was one quick drink, nothing notable to mention. \\n\\nThis past Friday we went as a group of 4, and explained that we would probably grow to about 8.  We were put in a booth, and the hostess said we could move a table or chair to the end if we needed to.  \\n\\nWe could very quickly tell our server Sam (female) was likely at the end of her shift.  Her body language and facial expressions were less than impressed, and for no apparent reason. She was breathing heavily when standing by herself at the ordering computer, long exaggerated breaths. \\n\\nOnce our group started to grow and a nice helpful young gentleman server offered to move a table over for us a guy named Mike, apparently the manager, got all worked up saying we couldn't do that, and couldn't even add a chair to the end of the table.  After a few minutes of Mike being really annoyed someone does move the table over for us.\\n\\nMy coworker finished her pint and then asked to order a half beer, meaning a glass instead of a pint.  Not unusual for a brewery to serve beer in a glass!  Sam seemed unsure if this was possible, it either is or it isn't! Perhaps she thought my coworker wanted a glass at Happy Hour price?  Not our intention,  my coworker just wanted a glass because she was driving and couldn't drink another pint. About 20 minutes later my coworker asked what was happening with the glass of beer and Sam responded \\"I haven't had time to see if that's possible\\", so my coworker was willing to order a small Lonetree Cider as that is one thing on the menu that is listed in glass size.  Sam had already walked away, talks to a the friendly young male server from earlier on her way back to the computer, we can tell they are talking about us (he is looking at us), with her looking extremely annoyed.  Then she goes to her computer to put an order in, is huffing and puffing, running her hands over her face, breathing heavily, in a wide open room where everyone is watching.  We saw her act this way at the order computer multiple times, in a wide open room where everyone can see! She comes back shortly after with a pint of beer and says \\"I tried to tell them but they poured this anyway\\" and her tone of voice and facial expression could have peeled paint. \\n\\nCan't say I'm surprised that Sam would act this way with a manager like Mike!  But honestly, my coworkers and I wanted to unwind after a long stressful week and it was really stressful experiencing the service we did, and I will be hesitant to ever return there."},{"name":"Sam LaGrassa's","address":"44 Province St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow.

Oh well. \\n\\nThe black pasta was VERY flavorful, the garlic taste was very strong, which was delicious, but it had a bitter after taste that we didn't really like (maybe from the pasta or the spices) and decided it wasn't our thing. \\n\\nBut the reason this place gets one less star it deserves was the service.

The guy at the window confirmed the wings were indeed spicy but I was too hungry to wait and let them make it over. I hiked over to a nearby park and sat down at some benches to enjoy the Thai goodness. Dang these are darn good wings. They are the full wing with the mini drumstick and the little tip so you get a lot of bang for your buck. And it was really red with little pepper flakes all over them so you could tell it was full of flavor. I braved the spiciness and just kept eating.

You come in, and this place is full with a ton of soccer jerseys posted on the walls and ceiling.  It is small but they use ever inch of space they have.  It reminds me of cafes we see in Rome as everyone is cozy next to one another including strangers.  Everyone inside looked like they were having a great time in conversation.  \\n\\nThe food was fantastic!  I ordered the bruschetta monferrina which is made with toasted Italian bread with saut√©ed mushrooms, pancetta, garlic, parsley, and white wine.  This appetizer is small, but just right considering their entree portions are somewhat large.  I actually like this version better than your traditional bruschetta with fresh tomatoes, basil, garlic and olive oil.  I'm a big fan of saut√©ed mushrooms so I was excited to try this version and I wasn't disappointed.  I highly recommend ordering it as it is light and packed with a ton of flavor.  The only thing they could have done was toast the bread a bit longer to really get that crunch on the bread, but other than that it was perfect.  I ordered the linguini squarciarella (Gino's favorite) and I loved it!  This entree is made with linguini pasta with stirred egg, prosciutto, onion, Parmesan, and black pepper.  This was rich and cheeeeesy!  If you are a fan of Alfredo sauce, you'll love this dish.  They also don't skimp out on the prosciutto either there was a lot in my entree. I would advise not to put any additional cheese on this dish.  They put plenty on it already and if you do, you're pasta will end up clumpy and sticky.  Not appetizing to the eye if you know what I mean.  This place is very busy during peak hours so if you're planning to dine between 6 to 8:30pm, I highly recommend making reservations especially if it's on a weekend.\\n\\nFor those of you who are vegetarians, they have great salad options as well as appetizers that are healthy and simple, but they are known for their awesome pasta and cheese dishes.

Of course (without looking) my boyfriend ordered a Coke and I ordered sweet tea. The server came out with my sweet tea and a can of Coke and glass of ice for the boyfriend. It wasn't until he finished his glass that we realized that there are NO FREE REFILLS on Coke. What? $1.50 for a can of Coke. So he had some of my tea. Sweet tea gets refills, but I was never offered. Meanwhile, we ordered our food and I asked for the (2) tacos. I asked if I could split them and get one chicken and one beef. The server looked at me like I was asking for gold-plated tacos, and told me no, I had to pick one or the other. So I got beef, and my boyfriend got chicken. (We'll show them!) \\n\\nAnyway, when they came out the presentation was okay, but the rice and beans that came on the side tasted like they came straight from a can and just got nuked in the microwave.

It's a little difficult to look at the whole menu at once and there are several options for each dish (bowl, wrap, plate).\\n\\nI had the Mystical Mountain salad, I am a raw vegan and asked to have no hummus or any of the vegetables or sauces that may be cooked.

The dressing and combination of vegetables and fruit was tasty. \\n\\nMy friend had The Seeker and asked for it in a wrap but was given a salad instead. If we didn't have this mix up with our dishes I think I'd give this restaurant 5 stars.\\n\\nIt was very busy at Life Alive, it was around 2pm and even with the blenders, music and people it never got excessively loud. There were a lot of families eating together, and students studying. The atmosphere is very earthy and artsy. There is seating upstairs and downstairs. When you order your food you are given a number to put at your table and the cashier will ask you if you are sitting upstairs or downstairs so I recommend scoping out the area first.\\n\\nI ordered a juice and a smoothie while I was here. I had the Life Alive (very tasty and the wheat grass makes it a little sweet), it was fantastic and at a fair price, $5.99. For a smoothie I had the Vibrance Alive and asked for Coconut Oil to be substituted for Maple Syrup.

The items are detailed and you pick your choices of tacos.  There aren't combo meals so you might instantly guess that the tacos are filling with the prices at about $3-$5 a taco.  I ordered the guac and chips along with the Democrat and some other taco.  You sit down and pick out your drink from the fountain.  They have natural sodas that taste exactly like the real thing.  They might be even better so fill yo drink up several times yo!  I did!  Anyway, so my Democrat was amazing.  There's seasoning all around that taco and not just on the meat which I love.  I can't stand a fish taco where the sauce you put on it is the only flavor and you're given this plain fish.  Blech.  My eyes rolled to the back of my head and I wanted more.  And more.  And more.  My other taco was excellent as well!  There were onions cooked into the meat along with cilantro.  Ermagerd!  SO GOOD.  The guac was excellent.  It is pretty green and all I could pick out was pieces of cilantro but there is a nice kick to it and might be too much for little kids but my 4 year old handled it like a pro.  There isn't pico in it so whatever they put in it is excellent.  The chips are disappointing though.  I wish they were fresh but once you take a bite into the guac, you sort of forget until you take another look at the basket of chips.  I'm pretty picky on chips.  I can't stand a place that just serves chips from a bag.  On the other hand, you need a thick chip to handle this stuff.  Also, the guac comes with shredded Mexican cheese on top and it gives a different flavor to it.  \\n\\nThis particular location has plenty of seating and even if it's so packed that there isn't any, I'm pretty sure no one would mind sitting in their cars for this food.  \\n\\nThe reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because my corn tortillas on my tacos weren't even warm.  They were room temperature.  They seemed cooked but still.  If the inside of the taco is hot, the tortilla should be as well.  I also wish it was cheaper per taco but people will pay the price for good food.

The cucumber in the salad was cut in long strings which honestly made it just super hard to eat and transfer to a side plate. The lamb was super tender and juicy with a great amount of fat on it - my fave! The veggies were okay and the potatoes were flavourful! Big portion and could have definitely shared among three people. All in all it was a good experience but the service could have been quicker and the overall feel of the restaurant was inauthentic.

I was hungry so I ate mine, but my husband barely ate half of his.  It was supposed to be eggs, bacon, etc. on a buttery roll (and it used to come on a croissant, I think)... what he actually got was cheap eggs and mediocre bacon with mayonnaise on a cheap white hamburger bun.  He sat and waited for me to finish my meal, during which time they offered to refill my coffee twice but never once asked if he'd like more hot water for his empty cup of tea.\\n\\nWe let the waitress know that we were extremely unhappy and she offered a lame apology while shifting the blame around as much as she could.

He said it was the best sushi he'd ever had, but he lives in Blue Ridge and Statesboro, so the bar isn't set too high.  I thought everything was great, too, and I've eaten at the best both here in Atlanta and in the greater Los Angles area, so there!.  \\n\\nThe oysters and crab legs are a waste of time.  Too small; don't stand in line for these.  I love the nigiri because I don't care for the texture of seaweed used in most rolls. Also, for those that complain about the limitations of the sashimi selection, try the nigiri and don't eat the rice.  Easy peasy.  \\n\\nMy next favorite (and it was a close contest) was the teppanyaki (they call it hibachi, but it's really teppanyaki like Benihana). I had the shrimp and sea scallop plus zucchini and onion, and they were cooked perfectly.  Seafood is easy to overcook, so these were a delight.  I added some ginger sauce from the \\"sauce selection\\" and it was overall divine. My brother liked a lot of selections on the \\"Hot\\" bar.  There were a few good selections on the \\"Cold\\" (salad) bar, too. I recommend the asparagus and cucumber salads.\\n\\nFinally, this place has the tiniest, cutest desserts I've ever seen (plus the Asian buffet standby of JellO), but you can try an assortment, so all's good by me.

Frozen or not, I thought the sushi and sashimi were perfectly moist and succulent.\\n\\nPS - It was a \\"slow\\" night (less than half full).  The majority was Asian.

I absolutely recommend their pepperoni and sausage pizza. Their sausage is sliced thin, spiced well and different than any other sausage pizza you can find in central Ohio. The thin crust is fantastic, almost giving it a potato chip like texture. The crust's thin build allows their red sauce to really explode. \\n\\nRubinos is an old school restaurant, only accepting cash and checks. They can be extremely busy on the weekends, so the best time to eat there is probably during the week. Their business has been a staple in the Bexley community for over 60 years, and people often say nothings changed since the day they opened. \\n\\nFor anyone who wants some damn good pizza, go here."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great place!

I don't like to eat at chain restaurants, especially when living somewhere like Austin where there's no shortage of wonderful places to eat, but having heard great things, and having friends who wanted to go, I gave it a try. Overall, the food was pretty good, but I likely won't return. Here are a few reasons why: \\n\\n1) I would not expect to pay $40-$50 per person (with drinks and an appetizer) at a chain restaurant unless it was maybe an upscale steakhouse or somewhere similar. There are many other great restaurants in Austin that I would much rather spend that much money for a good meal.  \\n2) Our cocktails were overly sweet (and took a very long time to make it to the table - we had our appetizer before we even got our drinks), and though they sounded really fresh tasting, they tasted a bit syrupy and not all that fresh.  And again, for the same price, you can get much better at some of Austin's local bars and eateries. \\n3) Though our waiter was very friendly and helpful in the beginning of the evening, he was not the greatest as the night went on. This is really what put me off and led me to write this review. Examples of things he did:  he was pushy about ordering a bottle of wine over just two glasses;  left the dessert menu long before we were finished eating our entrees; cleared plates and brought the check before I was even close to being done eating (and even though I had not yet answered whether I wanted dessert); came and asked us about the check as soon as I finished eating, and before we even had even picked it up to look at it. His pushiness was unacceptable, and was greatly irritating. I felt rushed and like we were trying to be pushed out, even though it was only 9:00 pm and the restaurant wasn't overly crowed.  It's largely because of our waiter that I likely won't return. \\n\\n\\nNegatives aside, the wine selection is decent, the hummus appetizer was good, my husband's Red Chili Noodles bowl was very good, and my Spicy Thai Curry was okay (it was a bit too ginger heavy). Overall, besides the negative experience with our waiter, the overall experience was okay, but I still am not likely to return."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Great decor, maybe a bit too great.

Our entrees were swordfish (prepared medium well) and scallops. The scallops were delish, but the swordfish had a rather bright pink blood vein running through which made it not terribly attractive.

This place violates multiple offenses from a cooking and service perspective.\\n\\n1. I have ordered both boneless and bone-in wings from this place. Both menu items lack the moistness that a true sauced wing should have, and at times have been under or over sauced. I understand that you're trying to make food in mass quantities but you're trying to do one thing you're known for--so do it correctly. For example, I ordered boneless Kickin' BBQ wings and my girlfriend ordered citrus chipotle bone-in wings. Both of our wings were dry and lost moisture from being overcooked to death.\\n\\n2. The \\"crinkle-cut\\" fries should honestly be called what it really is--Ore-Ida frozen fries thrown into a microwave. Wings Over has sold fries that wound up being soggy, super dry and, overall, just bland. \\n\\n3. Surprisingly, the burgers are tasty. They have, dare I say, a bit of a good char to them. But I am skeptical about whether they're using fresh or frozen patties and whether the patties are actually grilled.\\n\\n***Service***\\n4. The service is terrible. I've waited 2 hours for an order on a non-sporting event day, have not been given the correct sauce for my wings, not been given blue cheese or celery or my drink and on one occasion, was not even given my french fries and told by one of the workers that I wouldn't be getting the fries THAT I PAID MY MONEY FOR.\\n\\nThe redeeming (somewhat) part about this place is that when they DO get your order correct, the food comes in large amounts and is somewhat tasty.

After a rough start, my main dish was also terrible.  I ordered an eggplant dish and it tasted really bitter and the cous cous was not great given it's in almost every one of their main dishes.  My fiance's dish, the lamb chops, were decent, but definitely not worth $18.  Even after getting the scallops removed from the check, we still spent $45 (incl. bev and tip) and went home hungry.

I've come here twice now for birthday celebrations and have left underwhelmed twice. The best thing I've tried here are the oysters (surprise), but everything else has just been average. \\n\\nThe crispy oyster slider is tasty (loved the pickled vegetables) as an appetizer, but unfortunately the oyster was overly fried. For my main course, I tried the ICOB bouillabaisse which was disappointing due to the flavorless broth. It also came with a piece of crostini topped with crab meat? although this was very salty. At least the monkfish was cooked tenderly. My friend ordered the east coast halibut and complained the crust was over salted as well. I've also eaten the lobster roe noodles in the past, but that dish left me feeling too heavy with its combination of braised pork and lobster. \\n\\nBesides the food, the service also left something to be desired. Service was spotty in that it took about 20 minutes to flag down our waitress to place an order. However she did redeem herself later on in the night by keeping my water glass filled. I probably wouldn't come rushing back anytime soon though since I wasn't blown away by the food (or maybe I'll just be back for the oysters)."},{"name":"Smoke Ring","address":"309 Nelson St SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Great sides great meat great service!

Unfortunately, it wasn't a good experience. She ordered the puffy tacos, one w/ shredded chicken and one with ground beef. Her reaction was that the taco shells were too greasy and the meat lacked flavor and any spice. I had the fajita chicken salad w/ the Caesar dressing. It was a large portion, I'll say that. But I agree that the fajita chicken was very plain and a little tough. The salad overall was very basic. Nothing out of the ordinary. And at a $12.50 price point, not something I would recommend.

Swung by and went in (they do have a drive-thru, but not sure it's any faster and I like to peruse the menu when I step into a new place).  Got a Carne Asada burrito with pico de gallo and guacamole (the condiments are set and listed on the menu).  I think there was supposed to be cheese, but it wasn't totally cheese-y, in case you were expecting Taco Bell levels of yellow cheese.  As previously mentioned, the tortilla was kind of dry, I think it was griddled, briefly, to make it warm and pliable, and not steamed to make it moist and wet.  The burrito was chock full of meat, really like 90% meat and 10% other stuff.  The meat was pretty tender, chopped into small enough piece to make wolfing it down easier, highly seasoned (salty for my tastes), very peppery. I did get a giant piece of fat and grisle, but moved on, and that just lets me know it was an actual steak they chopped up.  There was just enough guac and pico to keep it creamy and moist in the interior.  I got a cup of the salsa verde (mildly spicy and green tasting, likely canned) and a cup of the red (hot! in a good way, also probably canned).  Overall, an OK burrito, it did the trick to stave off the hunger pangs, but not really high on my list of gotta get back there (maybe if you happen to be on the northbound side of OBT).

However, at the time, it wasn't funny. The meal gave us culinary blue balls. Never have I ever experienced such a high and a low in the same meal.

This offensive meal wasn't even tempered by a yummy side. His mashed potatoes were instant. What the hell? This isn't some greasy spoon diner, what modern day establishment doesn't make their own potatoes? Ugh. As for my meal, the char on the pork chop tasted like lighter fluid and the texture was rubbery. The mac and cheese was okay but it could have used some salt.

We ordered a large pepperoni and mushroom. The crust is so thin it's almost non-existent. I like thin crust, but Rubino's is too thin in my opinion. Cheese was applied very sparingly. We had some pieces that didn't have cheese on them at all! The waitress later told us if you want a normal amount of cheese you have to order extra cheese, which means you have to pay for the extra topping. That's how they get'cha. However, the pepperoni was tasty and the mushrooms were fresh instead of canned, which I appreciated. The sauce was actually quite good too. Seriously, I would buy their sauce canned for when I make my own pizza. \\n\\nIf the crust was a little thicker (think Donatos, not Adriaticos) and if they'd put a normal amount of cheese on the pizza, this would be great pizza.

At the time I'm writing this, they have a billboard at the corner of Northside/Hallowell that simply says \\"WE SMOKE PIG BUTTS AND WE CANNOT LIE.\\"  Upon passing this for the first time, I _knew_ that I would have to try Smoke Ring out, because anyone who could harmoniously merge barbecue with Sir Mix-A-Lot deserves a flyer.\\n\\nWhen I think of Castleberry Hill, I tend to think of awkward street parking, not enough parking, crumbly sidewalks and kind of sketchy at night, but I found Smoke Ring to be pretty conveniently located, easily accessible right off of Northside and MLK/Mitchell, with a quick dip off of Elliott St.  The restaurant is built into a mixed-purpose building with I suppose residences up top, but the bottom line is that the facade of the establishment is clean, modern and welcoming.  I felt very optimistic upon arrival.\\n\\nEntering Smoke Ring is a completely wooden-displayed interior, and for barbecue fans, there is instantly a smoky aroma that has already permeated throughout the place that I can appreciate.  Personally, I think there's something wrong with any barbecue joint that doesn't have a smoky aroma upon arrival.\\n\\nService was pretty quick, and friendly.  Either it's because they're still relatively new and people aren't hip to them yet, or that I was well ahead of the dinner rush, but regardless, it doesn't change the fact that service was friendly, our server gave recommendations and advice, and nothing too long at all to arrive to the table.\\n\\nOne thing I would recommend is to not bother going to Smoke Ring's website that's linked to via Yelp.  The menu on the site is comprehensive, and everything you see on it won't necessarily be available when you get to the restaurant.  The prices don't match up, nor do some of their options like the two-meat plate, or the make-a-meal-out-of-three-sides.  I had serious thoughts of getting bacon and bleu cheese potato salad upon reading the website, only to find that it wasn't being served when I went.  It's not that what they had when I went was terrible as a result of partially misguided information, but as a first-timer, I would've loved to have done a two-meat plate and tried multiple meats.\\n\\nA minor gripe, and not the reason why this place doesn't get a five-star from me.  I was still pleased with the options they did have available, and settled on the ribs, since I figured they would be a good barometer of their meat quality.\\n\\nTrue to their name, the ribs were full of smoky flavor and fantastically delicious.  Of a lot of the barbecue joints in Atlanta, I think Smoke Ring truly has the best smoked flavor in their ribs that I've had.  They've got a little bit of chew, which I love, yet they still rip cleanly off the bones.  They don't slather them in rub or sauce, and they're just as good naked and smoky, as they are with their sauces.\\n\\nSpeaking of the sauces, Smoke Ring's sauces I would say lean more towards Carolina style, as they're tangy and thin-ish, and not necessarily spicy.  Smoke Ring also has an interesting white sauce, that's hard to describe, but is still good, and has a lingering tanginess to it as well.  It went good with the ribs, but I would imagine it goes fantastic with chicken.  The restaurant's mission objective claims to want to differentiate themselves a little bit, and these sauces help that a bit, I'd say.\\n\\nAlthough the meat is the primary reason to come to any barbecue joint, I have to say that I was kind of mun on Smoke Ring's sides.  I like collard greens generally, but I like them more when they're cooked in pork juice or have fat melted into it.  I suppose when I saw it listed as \\"hock collards,\\" I expected it to have somewhat of a porky essence to it, but they turned out to be kind of, generic.  There wasn't a lot of flavor, no real tang to it, just kind of bland greens.  The three-cheese mac was better than the greens, but my personal preference isn't necessarily fond of the soupy shells kind of mac and cheese, although it's hidden by the slightly crispy layer of baked cheese on top, which that part tasted fantastic.\\n\\nPrices are reasonable, erring towards cost-efficient for the diner in my opinion, as a $13 plate is a satisfying portion of meat and sides.\\n\\nAgain, I hate to be the guy that breaks the string of five-star ratings, but I have to be honest when I say that I was underwhelmed by the sides.  The meat however, is the smokiest flavor in the city by my opinion, and is most definitely worth repeat trips, and I look forward to coming back to try their other meat options in the future.  Not to mention I really enjoy their location, convenience, decor, and a good showing of Castleberry Hill."},{"name":"Restaurante Jasmines 2","address":"6801 Airport Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Wow, Taco Salad had great flavor.

We passed on the waffles but enjoyed the strawberries, nuts and whipped cream for desert.  The kolaches are with the bagel table.  The eggs were tasty so try all the choices.

Every time. The pancakes had the same problem. The edges were soaked in oil and they tasted gross. The middle had more of a pancake flavor, which was good, but by the time I got to it, I had lost my appetite. Once, the pancakes were rubbery as hell, and so hot I couldn't touch them. I'm pretty sure they were microwaved before they reached my table. Whether they were or weren't, they weren't very good.\\n\\nI certainly gave them a chance to win me over.

The crowd was all-Caucasian, the dress code was a mix of casual and formal. We were in casual clothes. We got in, the place was at nearly full capacity but we were promptly seated. So far so good.\\n\\nAnd then it got funny. There were about 7 tables inside the restaurant and more outside. The two-seater beside ours was empty. There were 4 servers going back and forth passing by us. All of whom would look at each other, look at us, and totally avoid our table. All this awkward eye shifting went on for about 10 minutes while we were sitting there not being served. Then a server approaches us, tells us he's not really our server but offers us water because he saw we weren't being taken care of.\\n\\nAn older Caucasian couple walks in, gets seated at the table next to us and a server promptly appears to assist them. My friends and I look at each other.\\n\\nI'm not really sure what was going on. I can think of a few ideas:\\n\\n1. The servers just don't like customers of a different skin color?\\n2. The servers haven't seen Asians before?\\n3. There was some seating issue going on so the staff was confused on who our real server was supposed to be? I would say there's 15 tables in total, including the ones outside. That's a tough number to manage between 4 servers right?\\n4. We weren't wearing the right brand of casual clothes?\\n5. We didn't have the appropriate amount of bling and somebody at the door actually counts?\\n6. None of us went in brandishing an Am Ex Black card or saying \\"do you know who I am?\\"\\n7. Bistro du Midi is actually a secret society and we didn't say the password or offer the secret handshake at the door?\\n\\nI couldn't figure that one out to be honest.\\n\\nWe got served reluctantly, eventually. We stayed anyway, played nice, enjoyed the food (it was really good) and joked about being the undesirables.\\n\\nLook, we went into this place knowing that we'll have to pay for our meal and tip reasonably (which we still did). In return, we expected to be treated the same way as everybody else who go here, not like second-tier customers. Bottom line is, we can afford to pay. It shouldn't have mattered how we looked. Plus, since my crowd can really eat, we racked up two tables' worth of tab.\\n\\nHopefully, this is not a regular occurrence here. One of the friends who was with me has been here before and actually got good service. But what an uncomfortable experience.

Although I love the extensiveness of the menu and the inventive ingredients, Cafe Luna simply failed to impress for multiple reasons.\\n\\n1. How I waited: a dining experience starts from the moment you walk in. After I pushed past everyone to put my name in, I patiently alternated between getting jostled by people next to me and shivering whenever the door opened. A place this busy could definitely afford to construct a little buffer room to both alleviate the crowded waiting area and the chilly gusts. Also, I simply did not like how the host/owner kept on stalling us with little tidbits of information. It did not make me feel better to hear that our table was being set when I still had to wait 20 minutes after that.\\n\\n2. The service: this cafe is clearly a victim of its own success. Throughout my experience, I felt like I was waiting on the restaurant. The host, although obviously very busy, was curt and distracted, giving me a strange look when I tentatively gave my name. Although it was a cool that the servers had ipads, it slowed down the process as our server had to look through all the categories to find our choices. I would much prefer they had notepads, which would provide a lot more flexibility.\\n\\n3. The food: just alright. I had the fig and prosciutto benedict, my girlfriend had their hash, and we split their two choices of specialty potatoes. I liked my benedict, but that's only because I'm a huge fan of fig jam. Outside of the choice of ingredients, I wasn't wowed at all. My girlfriend liked the hash, however again, she's a big fan of hash. The potatoes were very disappointing. The Jalapeno flavor was simply a sauce poured over the potatoes, and while the ham combo was a little more impressive, the boring and bland breakfast potatoes were hard to get over.\\n\\nAll-around, a very disappointing experience at an expensive and time-consuming restaurant. You'll have similar food, albeit with less options, at your local diner. If you want a cozy, family diner experience with top-notch breakfast food, Mike's in the South End is a much better choice."},{"name":"The Nook On Piedmont Park","address":"1144 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Wanted to send my public thanks and sincerest appreciation to Natalie and the caring crew at The Nook.

After about 15 minutes and about 5 tries to flag down a waiter... ours was blantantly ignoring us i think... (no, i'm not being paranoid.. he would see me trying to get his attention and turn his back to us).. another waiter actually came over and asked if everything was okay.  \\n\\nWe said we were waiting for our duck and pork.  He went over to the area where they prepare it and bought us our plate.  The food was cold.  Not lukewarm... stone cold.\\n\\nNow, I have begged my husband for a month to go here (he's not a big fan) because I love the duck and pork and I wanted it to be at least marginally warm.\\n\\nAfter another 5 minutes of trying to flag someone down, I told the waiter it was cold.  He said, no problem, he'd heat it.  Now, I know he meant microwave, and i told him specifically I do not like microwaved meat (duck tastes all weird after reheating) and I did not want it microwaved.  I wanted it replaced.  The plate disappeared, I heard the microwave open, and about 4 minutes later (!) it beeped and our formerly cold meat was re-served.\\n\\nIt was rubbery, dry and pretty gross.  It took another 5 minutes to get someone to come to the table.  I explained the meat was not acceptable (frankly I wanted to cry because I had lobbied to come here for so long and really wanted to enjoy it and I know my husband won't agree to go for at least a year) because it was cold and then microwaved.  Our actual waiter wouldn't even come over to the table and sent the girl who just drops off the check.\\n\\nShe actually had the gall to look me in the face and tell me they cook and serve all their meats at room temperature.  I'm not an idiot and I think not.  First, you can't cook a meat at room temp and I've eaten it enough there to know they serve it quite warm and not cold enough for the duck skin to start to congeal as it was doing originally.  I would also think it would be against health code to serve meats at room temperature they way they do there.\\n\\nShe told us to go up and tell the story again to the manager at the desk and she might take it off the bill.  \\n\\nAt this point, I'm ready to leave and just frustrated.  \\n\\nAll I wanted was to replace the dish they forgot to serve with a fresh and hot plate, but they obviously didn't want to do that. \\n\\nI suppose I'm going to try First China now to see if their BBQ is any good but I'm not going there any time soon.

Unfortunately, I did not try any of their drinks, so I can't comment on that important aspect.\\n\\nAll these factors made it a great place to study for me -- except that the place was possibly too good of a hangout place.

The food was delicious and the service perfect. We walked in, and the downstairs was about 3/4 full. The hostess sent us upstairs, where the staff was waiting for us. We were seated by the window promptly. Upstairs was about half full. The waiter promptly came over and provided us drink menu's and a warm welcome. We ordered drinks, and warm bread came out. I ordered a drink special with vodka and fresh strawberries, and it was extremely good. It came in a cool carafe with a straw. \\n\\nFor appetizers, I ordered the chilled melon soup with crab, and my husband ordered the foie gras. Over appetizers, the manager came over and introduced himself. He was extremely nice, and talked my husband (jokingly) into taking me to Paris so he could compare the foie gras! It was a pleasant conversation. The chilled soup had plenty of crab and had a great twang, something I enjoyed. There was plenty of flavor with a few chunks (not too many) of melon for welcomed bursts of flavor. My husband thought the foie gras was extremely well prepared, with a perfect texture and taste \\n\\nWhen the waiter heard me debating about wine, he sent over the sommelier to assist with my decision. I decided to forego the wine and instead order dessert - a great decision! For dinner, my husband ordered lamb chops and I ordered the gnocchi with pesto and fresh goat cheese. The gnocchi was TO DIE FOR. Melt in your mouth good! The goat cheese blended nicely with the pesto. The lamb was cooked perfect - I don't usually enjoy lamb, and I enjoyed the taste and texture of this. We also ordered the potatoes dauphine, and they were wonderful - creamy, flavorful and absolutely delicious. For dessert, I ordered the most delicious chocolate souffle, and my husband ordered the cheese plate. He ordered port and an espresso, and I ordered tea. Cheese was fresh, and the toasted bread it came with was enjoyable. The souffle was wonderful - warm and delicious and truly enjoyable. And not overly rich - perfect flavor and texture. \\n\\nOne thing I noticed, which was an enormous change from last time we were dined at Bistro du Midi, was that our water glasses were never less than half full. The staff was great and attentive. Staff knew what they doing, and everyone walking around the dining room had a purpose. We weren't being rushed at all, but the food also didn't take forever to come out (which wasn't true the last time). \\n\\nOverall, I would absolutely go back to this restaurant. The price was more expensive than a regular night out, but not so obscene as to make this a once a year place. The entire night (keep in mind, we only had one drink each) was about $120-$140, and that includes appetizers, entree (plus one side) and dessert for both of us.   Price was absolutely reasonable for the quality of food and service we received. \\n\\nThe service was beyond great, and I would say this restaurant absolutely redeemed itself this time around. I would definitely recommend it, as well as visit again.

We ended up changing our plans for the day just so we can have brunch here. \\n\\nBefore I talk about the food, I must acknowledge the owner and the staff. Such kind and wonderful people. The owner apologized multiple times for the delay despite our reservation. Upon apologizing he also realized that we heard so much about the honey biscuits and thanked us for mentioning and kept them aside for us because they were running out. Through out our experience he kept on coming to us and making sure we were enjoying. And the three plates were on the house, courtesy of the owner. \\n\\nNow to the food.

It was missing something that I can't think of right now but it was good to try the combination. The owner brought us out his jalape√±o cheese sauce which went really well with the home fries. I think that's why I ended up enjoying my dish more. \\n\\nBecause I always need to have a sweet dish when I go out for brunch, I ordered waffles. Usually, I go for French toast but because the owner told us about their cooking process.

This is more of a seafood joint, and less of your classic Italian joint. If you're looking for cheese and meatballs, this is not it. You can find that at the other 98 place down the street. There are about 8 tables. We got paired with another Asian couple. The kitchen is 5 feet from you. Live lobster split. Garlic fried. Parsley chopped. You smell and hear it all. Sometimes simple is the way to go. We did the clams and calamari combo in red sauce and the scallops in white sauce. Excellent. I wish I could cook like this. All technique. Amazing technique.
