Immediately we were impressed by the complete lack of concern for one's own personal safety by an employee who blindly started to walk into the path of our vehicle to go out to his car.  Given the smarmy look on his grease-soaked face, we were certain that we were in for quite an experience.  Our hopes were quickly affirmed.\\n\\nUpon pulling up to the drive-thru window, we were greeted by a crackly voice speaking what barely passed for English (and as a Latino, I'm guessing the Spanish would have been just as appalling).  After confusing herself several times in the attempt to compile our order, we learned that this establishment had apparently run out of bottled water.  A bit disappointed, we asked for Dr. Pepper to find they didn't have that either.  Sprite was the agreed-upon substitute, sadly.\\n\\nIt was at this point that someone we can only assume was the team lead this day opted to intercede.  He quickly confirmed the first portion of our order, correcting a few mistakes along the way while his barely-intelligible counterpart continued to chime in over him.  While this would have ordinarily been infuriating for some, we assume that this Laurel & Hardy, \\"who's on first\\" style of order taking is part of this location's colloquial charm, as the team lead pushed onward with the order, unfazed.  Emboldened by this wave of progress, we asked for a Coke for our second meal.  We were promptly informed upon asking that Coke was not available either.  We settled on Cherry Coke, as none of us wanted to ask for mustard or BBQ sauce to drink for fear of being denied yet again.  After confirming the order verbally, we proceeded to the first window to pay.\\n\\nThe cashier took the credit card, swiped it, and returned it with as little ceremony or acknowledgment as one might give a potted plant.  After a few tense moments waiting for either verbal communication, a receipt, or perhaps a Neolithic grunt we finally asked if we should pull forward.  At this point the cashier waved us forward, which might have been the most human interaction this creature was capable of at the time.  Unwilling to press our luck at that window any further, we opted to pull forward and receive our food only to find that some of the items we purchased were not in our bags.  It was at this point that one of the party decided to get out of the car, go back to the window, and attempt to engage a humanoid of some sort to inspect the order and secure our paid-for food items.  Perhaps it was the shock of having been confronted personally by someone who wasn't willing to settle for sub-par performance, but the missing items were quickly retrieved and we were on our way.\\n\\nIf mediocre customer service and oddly frustrating interpersonal interaction is what you're after, please make this location your first stop!

It makes it super uncomfortable unless you're into that sorta thing. Also what's up with getting refills of water but only to get more and more ice? I was drinking 2 oz of water at a time. Yes, I would like another refill. And another. And another. Especially after your burrito verde aka burrito salt-ay. \\n\\nAh, the food...okay, I will say that it is very affordable. For four adults, no drinks, it cost us a little over $30? We ordered an enchilada plate, burrito verde, steak fajitas, and some other steak burrito thing. The plates were pretty lackluster though. Oh, and don't bother ordering a soda. It's $2.25 and there's a one-refill limit.\\n\\nOkay, I don't get why places do this. Wouldn't you make more money by charging someone $2.25 for a soda with NO limit on refills? Instead, seeing the \\"one refill only\\" text makes me not order anything and stick with water. It's not like I'm going to sit there and ask for 34 refills. Who knows, I might just ask for one refill but given how ridiculously salty the food is, I probably would've needed more. I don't know why this bothers me but it does. It's like when you go to a restaurant and they charge you for a side of some sauce that you were led to believe would be free.

The place is relatively small, but turn over is fast so we were seated in a fairly timely manner. \\n\\nIn terms of food, I got the Gantetsu Shoyu. I believe it was mentioned as their most flavorful ramen. While the presentation and ingredients seemed nice, the flavor seemed a bit lacking to me. The soup didn't taste like much other than pork fat and probably could have used some seasoning. The noodles and meat were similarly lacking in flavor.

Truth is though that at that point we were going to have to wait pretty much wherever we might have gone, and I'd been dying to try this place, so we got on the list (in retrospect though, getting on the list BEFORE going to catch The Blues Specialists at CC would have been the prudent course of action).\\n\\nAfter standing around out front for a few minutes, One of my brothers said: \\n\\n\\"What's this path around the side that goes out back?\\" - none of us could answer him, so he set about investigating.  \\n\\nHe returned a couple of minutes later and said \\"There's a pretty cool patio out back, and it's empty - let's just hang out back there\\".  \\n\\nMy other brother then said \\"If it shortens the wait, why don't we see if we can order carryout and eat it on the back patio?\\"\\n\\nWe asked, and the folks inside said sure, a carryout order will be about 45 minutes, and you are more than welcome to eat it out back - so we ordered our food, grabbed a couple of pitchers of Live Oak, and adjourned to the patio.\\n\\nIt was a little chilly, but we're yankees and that doesn't really bother us - and the truth is, sitting out back by ourselves made conversation much easier and more relaxing.

Like all of the others have stated, the service is absolutely TERRIBLE. A friend and I walked over there for lunch around 1:15p. We had to wait 20min to be seated and noticed they had couples sitting at tables for 6 and 1 guy had a table for 4 all to him self. After being seated, the waitress placed the menus on the table and walked away (didn't even take our drink order). 15-20min later another waiter came by after cleaning the table next to us, with the rag he used thrown across his shoulder (what is this \\"Alice\\" and Mel's Diner?!). He took both drink and our lunch order and he wasn't seen for the rest of the day. 10min later the waitress who sat us at the table ran up stairs apologizing and NOW ready to take our order. We advised her that the order had been taken and we didn't appreciate her slow service. She returned shortly with 5 drinks in her arms. No, not on a tray but clutching them to her chest and asked that we reach in and grab our drinks from her arms because she was delivering the others to another table. I told her to deliver those 1st and bring ours back by when she was done. I guess we pissed her off because it took 40min for one chicken calzone and a slice of pepperoni to hit the table. We wanted to leave but because we walked there and our lunch options and time was limited, we stayed (plus they had the NCAA tourney on the TVs). THE FOOD WAS GOOD, let me be clear on that but the service...YUK! No one ever came back to the table to check on us, I finished my soda before the food came, so I had to chew on ice with my meal. After eating, we waited for someone to bring us our bill, but it didn't happen. After 10min, we guessed at the price, left $15 on the table and walked out. The person I was with, wrote on the $5 bill with a sharpie \\"Your Service Stinks!!\\"\\n\\nI recommend this place to NO ONE!"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Voodoo Doughnut is sort of one of those landmark places you have to go to when visiting Portland. Just because it's featured on TV and tons of magazines. And since it is open 24 hours a day, you can get your doughnut fix any time of the day, for breakfast, lunch, dinner or just a snack. Lines can get considerably long at this storefront, with a velvet rope wrapping around the corner helping to form the sometimes long lines. While you wait in line, you can stare at the neon sign of Voodoo Doughnut and stick in belly.\\n\\nBut as soon as you near the entrance, try to peek through at the large menu on above the cashiers. You will get an opportunity when you make it in to look at the menu, but once you get up to the cashier, the staff dressed in their hipster clothes can be quite unfriendly and almost rude. If you take your time, they will look at you with impatience. It doesn't exactly spell out a very enjoyable ordering experience, but if find the menu just as confusing as I did, since they don't detail what each doughnut is (Triple Chocolate Penetration? Cock-N-Balls, Tex-Ass, Old Dirty Bastard, etc.) there are two spinning turnstyle counters by the front counter displaying all the doughnuts, so you can just point and let them know which one's you want. You can ask the staff to which they will give you the most unenthusiastic response ever.\\n\\nI wound up ordering a Triple Chocolate Penetration ($1.25) which is a normal-sized chocolate doughnut topped with chocolate frosting and Coco Puffs. It was good but far from impressive, just your ordinary chocolate donut with sweet chocolate frosting and Coco Puffs. There wasn't much to it and it was easily forgettable. However, I had a chance to try the O.D.B. ($1.75) or better known as the Old Dirty Bastard which was an outstanding doughnut. The O.D.B. is slightly larger than the Triple Chocolate Penetration and is topped with chocolate, oreos and peanut butter. The soft, almost to the point of creaminess peanut butter contrasted perfectly against the crunchy and crumbly texture of the Oreos. And then it was all tied in with that same chocolate frosting. Yum!!! The O.D.B. was leaps and bounds ahead of the Triple Chocolate Penetration, and I could have easily had another one if calories and me developing a gut weren't such a turnoff.\\n\\nAlthough I'm not a huge fan of doughnuts, Voodoo Doughnut's do sell some stellar doughnuts while others are sub-standard. It's a hit or miss. Although their business approach is fairly unique such as the Voodoo Doughnut and Cock-N-Balls, a fair portion of their doughnuts seem to simply consist of cereal or other such simple toppings which may suit many, but as far as the Triple Chocolate Penetration went, I was not impressed at all. Would I return? It's debatable. With an unfriendly staff and long lines, I probably would not. But otherwise, you can expect to find me there ordering a couple O.D.B.'s to go...."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Hey I really wished that I could give this restaurant more stars.

I will never let that person choose a restaurant again.  EVER.\\n\\nWhen you arrive, you pay upfront.  Then you are let loose in the chaos of the restaurant.  Children are running around like Lord of the Flies.  Dishes are crashing around you.  People are playing loud music from their cell phones.\\n\\nThen the food.  I'd much rather forget about the food but unfortunately my stomach won't let me.  Most of the food was fried and the fried food was all batter and no meat.  I bit into a piece of fried mystery meat and found there to be absolutely no meat inside (which may have been a blessing in disguise).  The food that wasn't fried was actually cold.  I didn't dare try the soup, but a cohort who braved the egg drop soup reported it tasted like cold dishwater.  I did wish to try the beef and broccoli but all the beef had been taken and a chafing dish full of broccoli only remained.  My coworker informed me this was par for the course.  And of course, you are treated to traditional Asian fare such as.... Fried chicken, jello, and soft-serve ice cream (with the machine covered in grease and filth).\\n\\nThe beverages:  there is a soda machine with Coke products.  You are afforded a small red cup that holds about two gulps worth of drinks. Then you have to walk across the entire restaurant to get a refill.\\n\\nThe service:  I don't believe they employ staff there beyond the person at the register and the people preparing food in the back.  Surrounding tables were covered in dirty dishes that were not cleared the entire time I was there, nor were dishes removed from our table once they were no longer needed.\\n\\nThree of the four of us that ate there were pretty sure we would be getting food poisoning later that day due to the filthiness of the restaurant and the poor quality of the food.  Two of us did experience adverse gastrointestinal distress later that day.\\n\\nBottom line:  Avoid this place at all costs.  There are many better places to eat in the area.

He loveD it. So when it is his night to choose where to get food, we end up here (probably about once per month). On this particular night a few days ago we had both worked long days, it was 9:40 at night, and cooking was out of the question so it became a Jack in the Box night. We drove there and I hadn't brought my purse and my husband realized the only card he had on him was one of our credit cards that had $13.18 available on it. This was no big deal because we had a few dollars in cash between us as well and our card is the kind that will take everything off of it and then tell the merchant \\"hey, ___ is still owed\\". So our total came to $13.80 and we're poised with our dollar waiting for him to ask us for another 62 cents but instead he tells us it didn't work because a receipt didn't print out like its supposed to when a card is processed. So we're trying to explain to him are you sure? Because it isn't technically going to \\"process\\" it on the card, we should still owe you some cents but you should have gotten $13.18. Nope. Impossible he says. He tries again and again and says its declined. So we go home to get my purse/our debit card and go back, but while I'm at home I log on and check my card statement and sure enough, there is Jack in the Box -$13.18. We go back and my husband shows the guy the transaction and the guy immediately turns hostile and starts telling my husband that he is trying to steal from them, he doesn't believe us, if it is, in fact, a charge from them it will drop off tomorrow but it is impossible that they got any money because of the credit card receipt that didn't print. After getting irritated with him for about a minute he threatens to call the police on us if we do not leave! We asked to talk to his store manager, not because of the stupid $13 at this point but because of this man's HORRIBLE customer service! Neither my husband or myself have EVER been treated that way at any establishment...food service, retail, or otherwise. It was insane. How did he get promoted? I soon found out! He gets his store manager on the phone who basically BACKS UP EVERYTHING HE HAS SAID. Is completely rude and says to come back in the following morning at 6am to talk to him in person. This is $13 in food, people. That we're being accused of trying to steal, when our bank statement on our phone clearly shows a pending charge from them.\\n\\nBrief intermission if you've made it this far and want to go get a drink or pee right now, haha.\\n\\nSo the next day comes, around 11 we're like hey remember that insanity last night, let's check the account and see if it has fallen off or is still pending. The freaking charge POSTED. Before freaking out too hard I called the bank to be sure and I was like \\"look is there ANY way this will be reversed or drop off at this point?\\" To which they're like uh no we gave them the money it is done on our end. So now I'm livid and we return to Jack with our bank statement showing that the $13.18 had indeed posted from the night before. It is the same little jerk manager as it had been and he STILL would not give us a refund or any food! He said we could have come in earlier that day and spent that and that we are trying to scam him! He asked why we didn't come in at 6am if we wanted this resolved? He ended with \\"I can't help you\\" before running into the back. We stood there flabbergasted. I know no one uses that word anymore but that is truly all I can think to describe it...\\n\\nWe get home and we're like ok, what do we do from here? They basically took $13 from us and then accused us of trying to scam them out of a few cheeseburgers? We felt kind of helpless. Like okay the store manager is a freaking jerk with 0 customer service skills as well sooo... I took to corporate! I messaged this entire story to them and they responded saying that they were escalating this matter internally and that we would get our money back. Within a few hours we had +$13.18 from Jack in the Box in our bank account. Not saying that I'm not grateful. Thanks for not letting this branch steal from us? Lol. But what about how ridiculously we had been treated? So I message the person from corporate I had spoken with that got the money back to us and said basically I'd just like a kind word to be spoken to us from anyone at all so that we can eat here again without feeling sour about it forever. So she's like yes of course, I have given the district manager of this location your information, expect a call within 48 hours.\\n\\nThis is where the story ends guys. It has been 4 days and we have not received a call. Can we just call it what it is... the food isn't good.

It warms your soul and your taste-buds each time. The noodles are also a perfect consistency and, I don't know how they do it, but their bamboo topping also doesn't have that bitter aftertaste that I dislike from bamboo. The pork belly is nicely seasoned and is so tender, it literally falls apart in your mouth. Add on a side order of the aji-tama and you have a perfect meal. I almost always get the Tonkotsu Kara Miso Ramen with aji-tama on the side and I leave satisfied each time. They also have combos if you're looking to take home lunch for the next day, because (let's be honest) you're going to be too full after finishing the ramen to eat anything else.\\n\\nPRO-TIP: Hokkaido is extremely vegetarian-friendly. All the soups are vegetarian-friendly. Just be sure to let your waiter/waitress know. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is pretty cool. When you arrive, the hostess and the team will loudly greet you with a friendly, \\"Irrashai mase!\\" before leading you to a table. I especially love that they give you little baskets to put your scarves and bags in -- this is so helpful if you have a lot of stuff and don't want to leave lying around. I love the decorative aspects of the place too -- it's very sleek looking and being able to peek into the the kitchen where you see pots of broth simmering away is super interesting. \\n\\nThe location is hard to beat -- it's very close to the heart of Harvard.

It's really sad that I as an African American don't feel comfortable supporting this black owned business in the future because of how the staff here treats their African american customers. After the experience we had that night we will not be returning until the following changes have been made. \\n\\n1) FIRE ALL DOOR MEN or BOUNCERS. They are charging men $20 dollars at the door for wearing any shoe that isn't a hard bottom. Two or three people from my party chose not to come in and celebrate with me because of this. One of the door men came and spoke to the all my people at the table after we had eaten, and he explained the reasoning for charging us $20 for wearing non hard bottom shoes and also stated that we had a choice at the door to leave or pay to stay, mind you this after we racked up a huge bill. No employee should be giving incentive to customer's to never come back. Valet $20 or Parking deck cost $10, plus $20 at the door if you wear nice shoes that aren't hard bottom, and be mindful that you haven't even ordered a drink or food yet. This is a hip-hop based environment, Jordan's and timberland's will forever be part of the Hip-Hop culture. Please wise up. I understand the parking situation is out of the Restaurants control, but you can end the $20 charge at the door.\\n\\n\\n2) FIRE THE BUSINESS MANAGER. How do you allow people at the door to take money out of your bottom line by allowing under paid bouncers to charge people at the door for a place that isn't even a lounge or a club. (P.S.  You cant say your restaurant is upscale, but your showing young thug music videos while he is talking about \\"eat on that booty meat\\" in his music). Mind you I enjoy Young thug's music and I support Hip-Hop culture to the fullest.\\n\\n3) FIRE THE LEAD WAITER. Had to wait almost 20 minutes to get the check, and mind you it was almost 1am and very little people were present. My girlfriend had to go request the check from the manager at the bar so that we could check out. \\n\\n4)FIRE THE HOSTESS's. There was a complete lack of organization concerning reservations. one lady said we had an reservation , then the other young lady said she didn't see us in the system. Mind you the reservation was made on Monday the 22nd of February, 2016.\\n\\n\\nIf you are an African American who lives in the Atlanta Area like myself, and looking to go to a upscale restaurant please try the following places instead:\\n\\n-STK\\n-FOGO De' CHAO\\n-DEL FRISCO's\\n-Ruth Chris\\n\\n*At least when I go to these places, i'm greeted with great hospitality and I always feel the service I receive is worthy of a 20% tip or more.\\n\\nI can be contacted via email at  DaylonBaker@Gmail.com if you have any additional questions or concerns about my experience."},{"name":"Folk Art Restaurant","address":"465 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Folk Art was a fabulous breakfast place.

The lamb curry was also disappointing. The delivery also took twice as long as they said it would, though I understand that is not always their fault (could have been a busy night).

I'm accustomed to this style of fish being gutted before cooking/serving so I was unpleasantly surprised that my first bite was a mouth full of guts. The fish is covered in a dark sauce and the lighting is pretty dim, so it wasn't overly obvious that's what I had scooped on my plate. I wish I had said something but I assumed such a high end restaurant knew what they were doing and I just wasn't savvy enough to get it. But that first bite kind of ruined the rest of the meal for me.  The steak was cooked beautifully but a bit ordinary. I was expecting much more for the king sized price. The sides were also pretty boring. I so badly wanted to love everything, especially since I roped friends into going with us.

You're like an irresistible love affair, doomed for failure, sometimes disappointing, but crimety! My number one craving. I shall call you... Elvira.\\n\\n\\"So why?\\", you wonder. Why the negative connotations on a four-star rating? Well, there are a few solid reasons that have deterred me from 5 gold stars, and I'm tempted to really rate out at a mediocre 3.5. Three reasons:\\n\\n1. Consistency is key. If you have posted hours up on the web page, I expect you to be open. Open like a virgin on prom night, damn it! I, like everyone, loathe disappointment. I gaily skipped up to your sweet doors on a Friday afternoon, and your cruel words to me were \\"CLOSED FOR MAINTENANCE.\\" Oh sigh. I get that shit happens, as does maintenance. You gotta do what you gotta do. And I'll give you props for generally having very versatile, available hours. Maybe I just have bad mojo. Either way, that sucked.\\n\\n2. Know what you can handle and staff/bake accordingly. Voodoo, you've been rockin' the doughnut scene for a long time. Nothing is fully predictable, but you should have some semblance of patron patterns, when you have rushes, down time, that sort of thing. I made a venture downtown from Beaverton JUST for your lovingly luscious sweet frosting. What I ended up getting, after parking ten blocks away and trudging through the cold to get to your doors.... Well, I couldn't get to your doors. There were literally about 25-30 poorly postured hipsters lined around the corner of the building. No. Effing. Way. I waited in line for fifteen minutes and the line moved forward 4 people. I double-checked to make sure there wasn't a special event or closure that caused the wait, and found nothing. Just another episode of disappointment and soggy shoes. \\n\\n3. I already forgot the third root of my woe, so lucky you, Voodoo! Only two strikes on your mark, which is much less than the many moments of glee and unique bliss you have brought me in the shape of pastries.\\n\\nThe vegan recipe has evolved much in the last couple years, and gone are the days of each doughnut base hinting at a banana flavor (which I personally didn't mind). Sometimes, when I eat the vegan versions of Voodoo's masterpieces, I have to do a double take and wonder if someone slipped me the wrong doughnut.\\n\\nYour product is of five star quality.

It makes for a better and friendlier experience. \\n\\nIf you happen to be in Portlandia, it's worth checking out if you happen to be an avid donut fan.

Before spending the big bucks on dinner, we thought we'd stop by at lunch time. \\n\\nWe walked down Pleasant Street and turned around, confused as to where we actually enter the restaurant. We backpedaled to the entrance of the Warwick Place Cafe (adjacent to the theater) and found a small entrance there that led into the restaurant. \\n\\nIt was dead. We didn't see any waiters, no hostess stand (which we soon learned was at the backside of the restaurant as the main entrance is off the parking lot), and there was no one behind the bar. The bartender was seated at the bar chopping fruit and another woman was eating on the other side. We asked, \\"are you open for lunch\\" and the woman eating answered, \\"yes, lunch isn't very busy for us!\\" We had another moment of confusion before realizing that she actually worked there and was just having her lunch. *Shrug* Makes no difference to me. \\n\\nSo anyway, we decided to sidle up to the bar. The bartender came 'round and asked if he could start us with drinks. We each chose a beer (pretty good tap selection) and then he brings over one menu. Just one. Apparently, we just got to share one menu between the two of us! \\n\\nSo JT decided on the filet sliders and I went for the toasted caprese.

Need to learn to read.\\n\\nThe plates came out quickly (too quickly IMO). With the restaurant so dead, I would think that you could take some time to make the meals as perfect as possible. JT's sliders were tasty, but nothing to write home about. I did not enjoy my sandwich at all. The bread wasn't on a true baguette (the crust was cut off and thus the bread was spongy and inedible).

Now, my issue is the wait staff. I've been a few times and I am not impressed with the staff. For the menu prices, wait times, etc. I expect better service and I haven't had that yet.

I thought we were getting the shrimp, little meat pies, and a pumpkin-looking bisque. We must have gone just as they changed over to a new menu because we got the shrimp, a mushroom bisque, and a strange little (emphasis on both those words) charcuterie-looking thing.

More fat than anything and little flavor. Desserts were good, the miner's treasure parfait was surprisingly my favorite (not too sweet or heavy) and the poison apple was also light and airy. For drinks, I got the Alchemy and hubbie got the Enchanted Apple, both of which were strong and good.\\n\\nCharacters: The Queen definitely stayed in character, but didn't engage with us despite my best efforts.

My favorite table is located on the mezzanine level, the Reid Table. You can reserve this room for a private party. I love this room because right now I'm so obsessed with watching The Crown and there are Warhol-like paintings of young Queen Elizabeth smiling at you across the Reid table. Speaking of Warhol, they also have a Warhol Room filled with more Warhol-like paintings. For all I know, these paintings might be originals. Who knows?? I didn't ask. \\n\\nFood exceeded our expectations. We started out by sharing prosciutto with fig preserve laid out on a wooden platter. Plenty for 2 people to share. The only thing I would advise is, if you order this, don't pig out on the warm rolls they give you in the beginning (even though it's really tempting to do so) because they will give you more French bread with this appetizer. For entrees, I had Grilled Lobster Tail Risotto and my husband ordered the 12oz Filet Mignon. My risotto was unbelievable! It was a HUGE lobster tail cut into halves. One half they cut into chunks to put in the risotto, and the other half was strategically placed on top of the risotto. It was worth a pretty penny. And you know what's also worth a pretty penny? That 12oz Filet. It was the biggest Filet I've ever seen and my husband enjoyed every bite of it. The wine list was extensive, and the description of each wine was pretty funny. It's nice to know they had a sense of humor while making the menu. \\n\\nService was most excellent. Liana was very knowledgeable, friendly, and very spirited. We had such a wonderful time until the 4-top beside us showed up. Ugh! One husband was so obnoxiously loud, you'd think he was speaking to the whole restaurant instead of his wife and their 2 friends. I looked across the table to watch my husband eat dessert with his right pointy finger to his right ear.....at Bancroft! That made me laugh. Good thing he didn't need to use that hand to eat the chocolate cake."},{"name":"The Bancroft","address":"15 Third Ave","city":"Burlington","stars":"4","text":"Updating my review - The Bancroft stole my heart, and is now one of my top-5 protein places. The meal top-to-bottom was incredible, the service outstanding, and the atmosphere both comfortable and elegant. \\n\\nI had to try the wedge again - what I'd raved about my previous visit - and it was equally as delicious. I could have used more bacon (isn't that always the way?), but it was well made up for with delicious fresh bleu cheese. \\n\\nThe skirt steak??? WOW. So flavorful, so moist! Truly amazing. The grits and chipotle butter totally made the dish perfection. \\n\\nThe filet mignon was also incredible, and although I thought to myself \\"steak sauce with my expensive steak?\\", I tried it... and loved it! Sparingly, of course! (You don't want to lose the flavor of your delicious steak in a steak sauce.) I'd agree with some previous reviews that by attempting to char the outside they seem to get the steak a tad over the requested temperature (assume resting is to blame).

Launderette does not take reservations, so you sometimes need to be patient and wait.  The inside seating area is a fun 50's modern diner theme.  It can get crowded and loud.  I love how they have made their outdoor covered seating area cozy, spacious, and nice.  They have so many space heaters outside, that even on the rainy, cold, dreary evening we sat outside comfortably.  They even provide blankets to wrap up in.  I preferred the outside seating as it was possible to have a conversation.  The service was fantastic and friendly.  \\n\\nThe menu is seasonal, and as other establishments focused on local, and fresh ingredients. Also, no surprise, the menu is focused on family shareable plates.  The portions and the price point per menu option don't always align well.  For example, the octopus was extremely small for the price, yet the branzino was a whole sized fish and a good value for the price.  The menu is hit or miss, there are some things we loved, and others that weren't so great.  The crab toast was heavenly, even if you can't eat wheat take a bite of the crab.  The crudo was fresh and tasty.  Yet, the charred octopus was chewy and tasteless (pass on this one!).  The brocolini was mediocre.  The Brussel sprouts were typical Austin style sprouts, but tasty.  The bucatini and chicken were OK.  The delicious dish that we almost didn't get was the whole branzino.  It was perfect to share for 4 people (with some sides), and delicious!  It was fresh, flavorful, and cooked perfectly.\\n\\nI think the desserts here are worth skipping.  You can get better desserts elsewhere.  I was not impressed.  They are also small portioned and divided for sharing.  The flourless chocolate cake was mediocre, I have had better.  The birthday cake ice cream sandwich, was very rich and too sweet.\\n\\nThe cocktails were delicious and well mixed, and priced well at about $11.  The wine list is pretty good.  I love that the beer is served in Laundrette specialized Koozies that you can take home with you.  \\n\\nOverall a wonderful evening with friends.  The menu is just not consistent.

It's not often that you could excited just about simple staple soups.  I was overjoyed to hear that they could make the Sesame Chicken Gluten Free with brown rice.  The chicken was definitely crispy and moist.  Everything I was hoping for.

My SO got almost the same meal, except for the Brunswick stew in place of kale. That was the only definite failure of the meal. It was thick and basically tasted like bottled BBQ sauce. Their pickles, which seemed to be made in-house were actually very good. We also enjoyed sampling the different BBQ sauces at the table. My favorite was the Memphis. \\n\\nService was fine.

You have the option of dining in or getting your food to go. Fresh to order is a quaint cozy restaurant, this location is inside Cumberland mall. If you choose to dine in, after you pay for your order at the register, you will be given a number to place on whichever table you choose to sit at and someone will bring your food to you.\\n\\nMy fianc√© and I have been here a couple of times and both times we dined in. Customer service is good, all the staff was friendly. The restaurant was clean, they make sure the tables are cleaned off shortly after customers leave. I have tried several menu items including the Tomato Mozzarella Panini, which was just ok, a tad too much cheese for me. My fianc√©'s favorite item to order is the Grilled Salmon Panini, the combination of toppings makes it a very tasty flavorful meal. He usually gets the chips with his Panini and I have ordered apples with mine. I have also tried the Blackened Lime Shrimp which comes over Asian Slaw the description sounded better than what the shrimp actually tasted like, it wasn't bad, it was just ok. Another small plate that I've tried is the Almond Crusted Seared Tuna. The tuna was cooked perfectly, seared on the outside and rare inside, some much more expensive 4 star restaurants can't seem to cook tuna correctly. The seared Tuna was decent, the sauce overpowered the dish, not the best sauce for tuna.\\n\\nOverall, I think this is a nice spot to come to if you are looking for a fast meal but don't want to ruin your diet totally. There are both healthy and not so healthy items , I love that there are so many options."},{"name":"Happy House","address":"4234 N Interstate Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Good quality Chinese food at an inexperience price, served with polite if sometimes curt proficiency by an experienced staff that clearly takes pride in what they do. I have had at least a dozen meals at Happy House and have never been disappointed. Each was promptly made to order and served piping hot. (I personally would like to see some of the veggies and mushrooms chopped a bit smaller.)\\n\\nThe extensive lunch menu is an outstanding value. Generous portions  beginning at $5.95. Soup, crap puffs and a spring roll are included, as is  a pot of hot Chinese tea. A great lunch for under $10. (And that includes the tip!)  If you want to linger and sip your tea, while pouring over your fortune cookie, no one seems to mind. Perfect for a rainy day.    \\n\\nAdded plus, the dimly lit adjoining dive bar offers drinks at low prices including a very drinkable house beer at $2 a pint. There is a pool table and state gaming machines as well. About a half dozen large hi-def TV screens show sports and CNN. Open until.10 pm, you can have your food in the bar, if you choose.  The bar staff is usually friendly, but they are on \\"Portland time\\" and not in any hurry to accommodate those who wonder in.   \\n\\nOverall, this place is the prefect alternative to the Mississippi Ave. hipster hang-outs on the other side of the 5 freeway.

Unlike Nava, King + Duke is not a Buckhead Life restaurant. It's a Ford Fry restaurant. At the time of writing this review, Fry's Atlanta restaurants include Beetlecat, Marcel, The El Felix, Superica, St. Cecilia, The Optimist, No. 246, and JCT. Kitchen -- all good to great Atlanta area restaurants. King + Duke is no exception and ranks up there with Fry's best. This food here is excellent.\\n\\nKing + Duke is known for cooking many of its dishes over open flame. There's an open kitchen in the dining room featuring a 24-foot wood-fired hearth that contains grills and a smoker. This is where all the good stuff comes from and where the chef's counter is located, available by reservation only. Despite the size and location of the hearth (smack dab in the middle of the restaurant), there is adequate ventilation and you will not leave smelling like cooked meat.\\n\\nThe restaurant is popular and always seems busy no matter what night of the week it is. Reservations are recommended. Book on OpenTable and earn free dining points. When the weather is nice, the spacious patio is the place to be.\\n\\nThe interior is nicely designed and aesthetically pleasing. The restaurant has a classic American literary theme -- think classy library with leather and book straps. The drink guide, which is many pages thick, is known as \\"the library book.\\" It contains quotes from various American authors. Decor on the walls include drawings of authors such as Edgar Allan Poe and Ernest Hemingway. There are two levels of dining inside. The second level has a private room which can be reserved for large groups.\\n\\nLike Fry's other restaurants, King + Duke's menu is regularly changing depending on what's fresh and in-season. Ingredients are high quality and most are sourced locally/regionally. Lunch, dinner, and brunch are served. I've only been for dinner where the prices run about $5-15 each for most of the appetizers and sides and $20-40 each for most of the entrees. The popular \\"King\\" ribeye, which weighs in at over two pounds, costs upwards of 90 bucks. It comes with bone marrow and is typically split among two people. Generally, I find the food here to be quite gratifying and hearty.\\n\\nMeals include complimentary bread service consisting of Yorkshire Pudding, which is an English dish that is similar to a popover made with egg batter. The pudding is prepared with white cheddar and served with butter. These delicate, flaky rolls remind me somewhat of croissants. Yum.\\n\\nThe Hamachi Crudo is terrific. This crudo (raw) dish is made with yellowtail that has been chopped into small pieces, mixed with a refreshing and delightful cucumber relish, and topped with a bit of cilantro. The fish and relish are served atop what the kitchen calls \\"dilly\\" chips. These are essentially thin, housemade potato crisps. They're good and addictive, especially with the fish.\\n\\nThe Roasted Mushrooms are amazing. This side dish consists of chanterelle, beech (shimeji), and hen-of-the-woods (maitake) mushrooms cooked with a rich, creamy, and incredibly flavorful bone marrow \\"butter\\" sauce. It's almost otherworldy. The mushrooms and sauce are served on top of toast with fresh thyme, dill, and fennel for enhanced flavor and aroma. I highly recommend this dish and suggest splitting it due to its richness.\\n\\nFor a dish that's both light and filling, try the Pork \\"Pot-Au-Feu.\\" This is King + Duke's take on a French beef stew. The soup is a clarified broth made from (what I've been told is) a natural chicken and egg \\"raft.\\" The meat is pork shank, cross-cut in similar fashion to veal shank in ossobuco. Vegetables served on top of the shank include carrots, cabbage, jalapeno, cilantro, and (I think) basil. The broth has mushrooms. Grilled bread is served on the side. The meat is tender and savory.\\n\\nThe Hudson Valley Duck is absolutely fantastic. I suggest ordering it medium or medium rare (I prefer the latter). The plate comes with a thick, meaty, bone-in duck leg and slices of duck breast. These are served over cauliflower and preserved, slightly tart and acidic, mushrooms in a French Bordelaise sauce. I believe some of the ingredients used to make the sauce include red wine, bone marrow, butter, and demi-glace. The duck is perfectly cooked, the leg skin smoky and crispy. \\n\\nFor dessert, get the Sticky Toffee Pudding. It's so good, the sommelier chose it for his wedding cake! It's a sweet, airy cake made with molasses and chopped dates. It's served in an apricot anglaise, which is a semi-creamy/custardy sauce. The cake is outstanding and rich.\\n\\nService is wonderful. Shout-out to Jaz.\\n\\nValet costs $2 and is really the only way to go as far as parking is concerned. The alternative is to self-park in the Two Buckhead Plaza parking garage which costs $8+ after an hour.

I did read the reviews and noted that while most people liked the food and service, some objected to the decor. We liked the decor since it was like coming home. Both my wife and I were reminded of the restaurant in the movie \\"Moonstruck\\". Anyhow, we were greeted and seated immediately. Our server, a nice lady who acted as if she was serving us in her dining room at home, was there immediately to take our drink order. We both ordered a house wine  and we were served  quite full glasses of very drinkable reds. Since we are watching calories, we did not partake of the very enticing appetizer choices and ordered our dinners. Our waitress brought out bread sticks (Soft and slightly garlic flavored) along with my Caesar salad and my wife's pasta e fagioli (Pasta fazool if you are Napolitan) both were very good. My entree was seafood Alfredo and my wife ordered eggplant parmigiana. As I stated above, we are calorie conscious so we intentionally ate only half so that we can enjoy our dinners again today.

I wonder if the place is ever busy, & if so, when? \\n\\nAfter perusing the menu, I ordered the tuna tataki & the shrimp hibachi. I requested the hibachi dish be prepared with minimal butter/sauce. I prefer it to not be drowning in sauce!! I was skeptical this request would be honored, as I've made it before at other places, only to have the order arrive as a side of protein/veggies with a plate full of sauce!! The order arrived ~15 min. later. And the bill set me back ~$30. A little more than I expected but I'm about to find out if it's worth it! \\n\\nMuch to my surprise, the minimal sauce request was honored & the shrimp hibachi was delicious!! One of the best I've had!! The tuna tataki's appearance was suspect - not the usual bright pink you'd like to see with sushi. I took my chances & tried it and found it to be very tasty. Now...I believe some of the seasoning may have been a disguise for less than fresh tuna, but they pulled it off. No complaints other than the appearance. Good casual sushi, convenient location, nice service.  I wouldn't mind going back to dine in & try a cocktail and maybe the pad thai. And maybe go during lunch hours for a smaller portion & cost.

I have been let down by so many pho places in Boston, but this place is good and definitely worth the trek. They have Chinese and Vietnamese food, and the chefs/waiters in the back were speaking Cantonese. I think the place is owned by Chinese/Vietnamese Americans, so the pho was pretty authentic (haven't tried other dishes yet). We got the shrimp spring rolls and Vietnamese coffee that were okay; there are better places in Chinatown and Dorchester for them. They didn't have housemade peanut sauce either, but their hoisin/sriracha sauce mix was pretty good. The pho though was delicious- noodles were chewy, broth was flavorful, and the beef was tender. My boyfriend got the Pho 99 Special, which was in a chicken broth that was less salty and had a piece of every seafood item you find in noodle soup. I liked that it had both pho vermicelli noodles and wonton noodles, which were also perfectly chewy and full of flavor. Both bowls were huge, and I was full for most of the day. \\n\\nInside the restaurant was a little run down, but that usually means it'll be pretty authentic lol. I think it's family owned, and prices were inexpensive, about $13 for a large bowl of pho.

The pieces of pork I got were so good. There was minimal fat and was cooked very well! We also tried the Takoyaki. It was different; the inside was a little too mushy overpowering the crunchy exterior. Also the sauce they put on top made the ball a little more mushy, but it was still pretty good. We should've made a reservation before, we ended up waiting for an hour before we were seated. The manager was super friendly, she gave us dumplings on the house for waiting.

Jinya is a little bit different from the rest in that it's actually a chain restaurant, I believe from Cali. Jinya is a small restaurant located in Sandy Springs. I went with six other friends during Jinya's soft opening and had a fairly pleasant experience. \\n\\n{FOOD}\\nI ordered the Jinya Tonkatsu Black (~$13) with an extra serving of Chashu (~$3). The presentation of the Ramen was great; there's dried nori (seaweed), pork chashu (pork belly), soft boiled egg, and some other toppings. Be sure to mix the toppings into your broth because the garlic seasoning comes as a topping and needs to be mixed, otherwise your broth will taste very bland. The pork broth is thick and flavorful once the garlic seasoning is incorporated. My ramen came with thin instead of thick noodles, which I prefer. Thick noodles are just too heavy and chewy. I was looking to my chunks of chashu pork. Unfortunately, they came cold. Yummy, but cold and not fatty enough. \\n\\nI shared two appetizers: takoyaki (~$7) and fried chicken (~$6). The fried chicken's texture was great, but the taste was bland. I think it would taste much better with more seasonings. If not more seasoning, at least pair it with a dipping sauce. You can get the Ramen combo for an additional $4 and they will give you a small salad and the fried chicken. \\n\\nThe Takoyaki (octopus/squid balls) were fabulous and was the highlight to my meal. I can say with confidence that Jinya's takoyakis are the best I've ever had in ATL. Much recommended!\\n\\n{INTERIOR}\\nThe restaurant is small, with a bar that can fit about 15 people, around five small tables that can be put together to fit larger groups, and outside seating. \\n\\n{SERVICE} \\nThe service was not exceptional, but I can understand because it was Jinya's soft opening and their staff was still in training.   Since some of the terms on the menu are in Japanese, I could tell our waiter didn't fully understand the menu. I asked for extra Chashu and he brought me Soboro, which is ground pork. When I told him that I did not order Soboro ground pork, he proceeded to say that Chashu is ground pork and Soboro is pork belly. Which is definitely wrong. Basically, he had reversed the meaning of Chashu and Soboro. \\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed my experience at Jinya. They could use some improvements, but for a soft open, they did pretty well!"},{"name":"Alchemy Caf√©","address":"625 Parsons Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"This is my 4th time here.

The hoof hearted cold brew in a can is really good as well. They carry premium drinks and sides, and I leave here feeling like I'm not a piece of garbage for what I just ate, granted, it's 2-3x the price of garbage fast food but if you are looking at this place on yelp that probably isn't your big concern. Can't wait to come back and try out some more of the menu!\\n\\nAnd I'm back. I've tried a few different bowls now and the jalape√±o turkey sandwich ($8.50). The sandwich was good, it wasn't heavy, not that anything is heavy here, but I didn't get much or any jalape√±o taste. The side of balsamic chickpeas was FANTASTIC. I'd eat that in way too large of a quantity if given the opportunity. The peanut butter energy bite was pretty bland but, all in all, I still liked it. The ingredients were interesting and seem nutritious so I'll call it a net positive purchase at $1.50. The a√ßa√≠ berry pomegranate amazon energy drink was awesome! 40 Cals, 7g sugar isn't bad and 150%dv of vitamin c. $3 is pricey but I'd get it again/ will get it again so they clearly price things pretty smart!

The tiny storefront disguises a big, deep eatery that holds a surprising number of tables.  The menu is extensive and contains a ton of dishes notably absent from many of the Vietnamese pho joints I usually patronize.  \\n\\nI was cheerfully greeted by the main server (owner maybe?) who sat me down and asked me (in a non-condescending way) if I needed any help with the menu.  I looked it over, and with 71 items staring me in the face, I asked him what his specialty was. he pointed me to the Banh Hoi Bo La Lop (beef la lop salad roll platter).  I accepted his suggestion and eagerly awaited a new SE Asian adventure.  While I waited, I took in the decor - clean, minimal, Asian, nothing worth writing home to Hanoi about. \\n\\nFirst to arrive was the bowl of hot water (for wetting the rice sheets), a plate with a bunch of rice sheets, and a bowl of sweet smelling nuoc nam (fish sauce with sugar and chili). When the platter arrived, I was immediately impressed by the amount of food I was getting for my $8.50. The platter consisted of a huge pile of lettuce, mint, and cilantro, a decent little pile of spicy pickled carrots and radish, a stack of sliced cukes, a plate of vermicelli noodles, and the beef wraps.  The beef wraps were about 1/2\\" thick by 2' long sausage shaped ground beef rolls with spices wrapped in greens, and cooked in a sweet sauce with ground peanuts.  There were many of them (I forgot to count how many, that's how excited I was to dig in!)\\n\\nHere's where the fun part begins.  To make the salad rolls, you dip the hard rice wrapper for a few moments (maybe 10 seconds) in the hot water, then lay it flat on your plate.  You next add a beef sausage, some lettuce, mint, cilantro, carrots/radish, and vermicelli, then wrap like a burrito.  By this point, the rice wrapper has softened into a very pliable wrapping material.  Once wrapped, you dip and eat.\\n\\nI have enjoyed this style of hand rolls at other Vietnamese places such as Tamarind and Saigon Pearl in Seattle, and have seen them on the tables at Pho Van, but never had ventured there in Portland.  When the head guy tells you that's the specialty, you gotta just go for it.  I was not disappointed.  \\n\\nThe meat was so flavorful - and the majority of the veggies were crisp and fresh (a few with some black spots, but I had so much extra it was easy to leave those).  These things are like thai salad rolls on crack and steroids.  Less noodles, more crispy veggies and flavorful meat.  Mmmm... I think what most impressed me, however, was merely the quality of the main meat part of the platter.  The salad rolls did not rely on any external seasoning besides the fish sauce, however that was not even necessary. The meat had such an intense and well-balanced flavor as to work a great balance from the fresh lettuce, mint, and cilantro additions.  I happily repeated the ritual (wet-pile-wrap-dip-eat-repeat) until the whole platter was nearly empty (and my stomach was more than full). \\n\\nI look forward to trying many of the other items on the menu: Com Tam (broken rice), Bun (a huge selection), and other Banh Hoi style dishes.

The place was beastly warm; even the people who usually complain about being too cold complained about the heat. It moderated (after an hour) when they opened some walls, but it was still hot and humid. \\n2. The service was confused, slow and disorganized. One of my colleagues ordered a cider and received the wrong one (which service staff denied). We proved it when I ordered the same cider, and my cider tasted different from hers. \\n3. Water was served lukewarm. We ended up requesting ice, which they brought in small glasses. Why they weren't serving chilled water without being asked (especially considering the heat), I don't know. \\n4. The place was loud. We couldn't hear the server list the specials due to the noise and her difficulty in projecting over the noise. My voice was hoarse the next day due to having to speak so loudly to be heard. \\n\\nFood ranged from brilliant to pretentious (OK...it was all pretentious, but sometimes its quality over shown that) to mediocre to purely strange.\\n\\nWe ordered 4 appetizers:\\n1. Burrata (mozzarella wrapped around goat cheese) which was fine if uninspired, but it was served with NOTHING to eat it with. No crackers or toast points or...\\n2. Deviled eggs, which were plain disappointing. They weren't deviled eggs. This is where pretension got in the way of the food. They were semi-soft boiled eggs, halved, face-down with their backsides slathered with mayonnaise like a babies bottom with lotion. They simply weren't what was advertised.\\n3. The octopus salad was nice.\\n4. Another dish (I can't remember the topping), served on toast, but swimming in sauce so the bread was soggy.\\n\\nFor bread at the beginning, they made the odd summer choice of providing a rich, sweet bread in the can - that really should be held to Fall or winter - and the seasoned butter was served on the bottom of an upturned can. Not terribly interesting and with very little butter.\\n\\nMy main was a duck breast, which was brilliantly cooked and seasoned. On receipt, one of my peers asked whether I had ordered the appetizer. He wasn't joking. This smallness was emphasized by the huge plate it was served on and the duck being placed off-center, which emphasized the emptiness (pretension). It also came with 6(!) green beans. Another colleague ordered the fish, which was similarly plated on a huge slab where it was pushed to the side, so 2/3rds of the dish was empty. Who thought this was a good idea?\\n\\nAnother couple of my peers ordered the pasta bowl, which was similarly small and seemed half potatoes. They were disappointed by the overuse of potatoes (or lack of pasta).\\n\\nThen there was the chicken special, which people liked. Unlike the other dishes, they received a large portion (half the bird) inelegantly presented in a dish with one clawed foot still attached?!\\n\\nFolks liked the (small portion, again) hanger steak.\\n\\nSo, overall: expensive (it cost us $82 each), mediocre service, noisy, hot, form over function (i.e., pretension over flavor), and small serving sizes.\\n\\nI would not return."},{"name":"The Paramount","address":"44 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"One of my favorite places in Beacon Hill - it is super casual during the day but at night it is a great place to sit down and have a relaxing dinner.

One of the worst restaurant experiences that I've had. I've had some bad restaurant experiences before, but I've never left an establishment just genuinely upset. \\n\\nI was SO sure that I was going to like The Optimist, and had been wanting to go for such a long time. I came here once for drinks, and the drinks are really good. They are creative and strong. Nothing to complain about there. \\n\\nBut I should have known that something was up when we called before we went, to ask if they had any available reservations or a wait time. The lady who picked up was so rude. She said she didn't understand us, and hung up on us. I was so shocked. I should have just picked somewhere else to go instead.\\n\\nUnfortunately, we decided to go anyways.  When we got here, the host told us to sit anywhere in the room with the oyster bar. There is the side room containing several booths/tables and the oyster bar, and then the main dining room. \\n\\nThe main dining room looks great, and that's where the bar is as well. But the side room was in terrible shape!! The booths were all stained, oily, and dirty. We looked at all the tables, and tried to pick the best one. They all had rough and dirty looking booths, and the tables had crumbs all over and were sticky. It looked like the inside of a run-down Burger King. \\n\\nThe server, who took forever to notice us, first apologized and said that the tables weren't usually like this. I hadn't even brought it up, but he immediately mentioned the dirty tables. On top of that, there was a candle at the table with a dead fly in it. That really made for a great environment. Not their fault, but someone should have noticed it and replaced it. \\n\\nWe decided on drinks (Prosecco and the Bronx Cheer cocktail), and they were great. We also decided on 6 oysters, 2 each from New Brunswick, Connecticut, and Washington. The NB oysters were the best, very clean and fresh tasting. The CT one was alright as well, but the WA oyster was kind of milky and weird tasting. I've had other Washington/West Coast oysters before, and they did not taste like that. I wasn't a huge fan of their mignonette sauce, I liked the St. Cecilia one much more (another Ford Fry restaurant). The saltines were made in house and were good.\\n\\nWe also got an appetizer of Fried Calamari. It was decent and quite alright, however nothing special. Seems like typical bar/tavern food. It just wasn't up to par with what I expected for an establishment like this.\\n\\nThe server was alright, just very slow. A lot of waiting to be noticed. The WORST part by far, is that I noticed they were seating a certain type of person inside the main dining room. And a certain type of person in the side room. There was no way that was a huge coincidence. I'm not going to go into detail, but I hope you can infer what I am saying. And it didn't have anything to do with the way we were dressed, since we were dressed very nicely. \\n\\nI honestly feel like as soon as we walked in, we were judged and placed into the other room. That room was honestly disgusting and no place to be eating in, while the main room was very nice. Maybe I would have had a better experience if I had sat at the oyster bar or the main dining room instead. But this left a terrible taste in my mouth. \\n\\nWe paid $70 for 2 drinks, 6 oysters, and an appetizer. Not worth the price at all, considering the cleanliness of where we were sitting and the rudeness of the staff. I would want to give it 0 stars, but I enjoyed their drinks and most of the oysters.

SMH"},{"name":"Scales 925","address":"30 Ivan Allen Blvd, Ste 125","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"If I could leave zero stars, I would. I planned a birthday dinner for my boyfriend at Scales because he had expressed on several occassions he wanted to try the place out, and I was sold at Lobster and Grits.\\n\\nPROBLEM NUMBER 1:\\nScales allows you to make a reservation from their website. I was planning the dinner for Friday night so on Tuesday, I went online and made the reservation for 10pm. I recieved a confitmation email and text message shortly thereafter. On THURSDAY at 12pm a young lady from Scales called me to confirm my reservation for 6pm. No ma'am my reservation is for 10pm, I have a confirmtaion and email and text message stating such. She told me they do not do reservatiosn for that late on Firday and that the kitchen closed around 10:30-11 (this is not true)  but that she would speak to her manager and call me back.\\n\\nOn Friday, I recieved a cancellation email for the 6pm reservation along with a link to schedule a new one. I followed the link and there were options fo as late as 11:30. I rescheduled my 10pm reservation and called Scales. I was told that my reservation would be honored this time due to a glitch in the system. I considered changing the location of the dinner at this point and should have followed that instinct.\\n\\nPROBLEM NUMBER 2:\\nTwo-three young in our party had to pay to ENTER. Were they wearing sweatpants? No. Fitted caps? No. Tall, 5x white tees? NO! However, one was wearing a pair of Jordans... along with a button up and a blazer. Nobody in our party was underdressed however, several decided they would not pay $20 to enter and missed the dinner. All could have entered ANY club in Atlanta in their attire.... but they had to pay a bouncer to get into Scales. Which brings me to the brotha in the white pants and leather vest. We asked this man over because he appeared to be a bouncer/doorman and could possibly offer some clarity as to why these nicely dressed young men had to pay to enter the establishment. According to him, Scales is an upscale dining experience and you need to dress as such. I beg to differ... they basically have BET uncut playing on huge screens.... yep, booty shaking and profanity all up through this \\"upscale\\" establishment. Sideways dresscode aside, this brotha was HNIC of unprofessional behavior. He was argumentative and in all honestly, a bit disrespectful.\\n\\nPROBLEM NUMBER 3:\\nAfter having a less than stellar beginning to our experience, the food arrived. It looked and smelled amazing. Not a single utencil at the table. We had to sit patiently fotr approximately 10-15 minutes with our food in front of us for some silverware... after requesting it from several people. FOOD WAS AWESOME.\\n\\nPROBLEM NUMBER 4:\\nWe requested our check at approcimtely 12am.... I mention the time to bring light to the fact that the restaruant was clearing out by this time.... Most definitley past peak business hours. We waited... asked the waiter again... waited some more... finally at about 12:20 I got up and asked to speak to a manager so I could get our check. Manager came over to the bar where I was waiting, I told him all about our experience, and he printed our check. He was even kind enough to leave out the 18% gratuity they add to all parties of 5 or more. FAR TOO GENEROUS!!! *INSERT SARCASM* And, yes I had to get back up to pay the bill.\\n\\n\\nI will not be going back to Scales unless and/or until they drastically improve their customer service. There is not a shortage of upscale restaraunts in the Altanta area, and while I do appreciate that Scales caters to a more urban crowd, I will gladly find somewhere else to spend $225."},{"name":"Folk Art Restaurant","address":"465 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place had a few issues with execution but overall, brunch was enjoyable.\\n\\nWe started with the sweet potato beignets.

Others had the patty melt, folks southern fried, bananas foster waffle, veggie sandwich, and cinnamon pecan sticky bun french toast. For the most part, the food was very good and the portions were substantive. \\n\\nThe folks southern fried chicken and biscuits was covered in a sausage gravy that was thick and flavorful. The issue with that dish was the biscuits, which were too hard to really enjoy. The sweet potato waffle had a wonderful flavor but it was quite thin. A nice piece of chicken topped it though so it was enough food for me.\\n\\nService was really good and considering the fact that they let 2 people in our party of 8 sit for a half hour occupying two tables on a Saturday morning during a torrential downpour without any hesitation, I can't complain at all about the hospitality here.

Here, mostly local high-end seafood is the standard but preparations that are unique and create the cuisine exciting drives a focus. One example of this was the octopus appetizer. Having tried this dish in multiple variations at first the pairing with pickled vegetables initially caused concern. The sweet sauce akin to southern pork BBQ however contrasted well with the sharp vinegar flavors of the veggies. A dab of mustard seed gave the impression that this dish was meant to substitute for a traditional charcuterie plate. The simple sounding descriptions but inventive execution didn't end there however. Another favorite was their version of a surf and turf, which consisted of a filet of swordfish resting atop some shredded beef short rib. This was the most savory plate and is one of their specialties. To elevate their oyster options they also make in house their saltines and hot sauce which in my opinion is not needed to enjoy but certainly added a unique twist.  Our bartender kept the evening flowing smoothly and even though I opted out of the popular holiday cocktails the classics I ordered were on point and true to form. I was also blown away they were able to secure a bottle of Hill Farmstead Saison which speaks loudly to their beer monger.

Again, a not very well-thought-out traffic pattern, but this time for people.\\n\\nWhat I ordered came just as I had expected. The waffle fries were good and I'm a sucker for Chick-fil-A's chocolate shakes.\\n\\nThe help also lives up to expectations for Chick-fil-A, the few staff members I encountered were personable and accommodating and rather enthusiastic.

We ordered three entrees: Fried Chicken, Seafood Melange and the special of the night, the Pork Chop. All three dishes were amazing and very well presented and prepared. I had the Seafood Melange and the shrimp and scallops were cooked perfectly! The pasta and sauce were delicious and packed with flavor. It's hard to explain but, it's clear every ingredient in every dish is there for a reason and adds to an incredible flavor. Lastly, we had the Suspension Cake and it didn't disappoint and was plenty to share with a table of four. \\n\\nI can see why this is voted one of the top restaurants in Atlanta.

The thing I loved the most was the covered outdoor patio where we could bring our pup to hang out with us!  And they have dog water stations - bonus!!\\n\\nThe service was great too!!  Friendly staff, but not over bearing.  My soy cappuccinos were perfect each day and they even made the little designs in the foam!  Makes my heart happy.  I had the Zucchini Migas: (Cage-free eggs* scrambled with tortilla chips, zucchini, oregano, garlic, onion, cheddar-jack cheese and a pur√©e of fresh peppers. Served with warm tortillas (whole wheat, flour or corn) and salsa. Add fruit or your choice of beans (organic red & black or refried black)one morning and the El Tipico: (Choose one: 2 cage-free eggs* scrambled or organic red and black beans and we'll serve it up with a homemade potato hash cake, chopped local tomatoes, shredded lettuce, salsa and warm tortillas (whole wheat, flour or corn). Great with tofu! Add fire (puree of fresh peppers) or cheese, . 50 ea.) the next.  Both were excellent & I subbed the tofu scramble.  \\n\\nYep super good stuff here.  I'm certainly a fan and wouldn't hesitate to come back next time I'm in town!!\\n\\nPS - you meat eaters won't animal insides here, but none of the meat eaters I was with missed it!!

When I checked the Yelp app it said 55-75 min wait (lol). FYI: You have to be less than a mile away from the restaurant to get on the waitlist.\\n\\nWhen we got to the restaurant, there was a waitress who was in charge of taking people's names down and calling their names when their table was ready. \\n\\nShe told me the wait would be 30-40 minutes and the app told me there were 25 parties ahead of us, so I already knew the wait was going to be longer than that. But whatever, we came and we expected a wait. \\n\\nGanko has the waiting part figured out and makes it very efficient. When your table is ready, the server will call your name (you will also get a text if you're wandering around) and ask you what you want to order. By the time you get to your table, the food will be ready.\\n\\nWe ended up waiting 1.5 hours and were starving by the time we got inside. \\n\\n-- The Food -- \\nI ordered the TanTan ramen (w/ 5 minute egg extra) and it did not disappoint! Broth was seasoned perfectly (bonus points for no MSG!) and was very creamy, but not super thick. I would compare the flavor to a mix of sesame oil and peanut butter (nutty with sesame flavor). Mine did not have that much meat (ground pork) and for $13, I think it should come with more. Egg was cooked perfectly. I didn't think it was too salty and almost drank all the broth. \\n\\nMy partner ordered the Shio 2.0, which is supposed to be a more pork-y, creamier version of the original. He wished there was more meat (just 2 thinly slices of pork) and said it tasted salty at the end. I tried some of his broth and I prefer the Santouka Shio over this one. \\n\\nMind you, it only took us 20 minutes tops to finish our food and I'm a slow eater!! \\n\\nThere are 5 seats by the bar and 7 tables, which can seat about 20 people total. \\n\\nService is very friendly and there is only 1 server working the whole place. \\n\\nTL;DR\\n- Ramen is pretty good. I recommend the Tan Tan and would try the Gankara Miso or Gantetsu Shoyu. \\n- Come at odd hours and hopefully the wait is not that bad? \\n- Food was not worth 1.5 hr wait, I would put it at 30 minutes. If the wait is more than that, go elsewhere."},{"name":"Grindhouse Killer Burgers","address":"1842 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Grindhouse is an \\"order at the counter\\" joint that offers typical burger joint decor and great food!

Fairly empty around 6pm on a Thursday. The restaurant seemed a little warm for my liking, but no big deal. We each ordered a glass of their Chianti. (Apparently with the groupon you have a $7 cap per  glass of wine, and there was only 1 for that price, so we had to pay the difference). We ordered the meatballs as an app, and they were good. Smothered in red sauce and topped with shaved parm. Not life changing but good. As for dinner, we could choose from any entree on the menu except for the pizzas. My husband ordered steak and veggies (additional charge). His steak came out good he said. NY strip, ordered medium. Again, good but not life changing. He did ask for his side of linguini to be on the side, and he was literally brought a plate full of linguini and sauce that could have been a dinner portion on it own. I ordered chicken copertino, chicken with ham and ricotta, mixed with a plum tomato sauce and linguini. It also was very good, better than I expected it to be. I could only eat half. The meals are served with french bread and a garlic/olive oil sauce. That I could have eaten by itself! \\n\\nOur server was friendly, attentive, but not overbearing.

Fantastic experience. I do have to mention, the restaurant is LOUD music wise, but the very patient, gracious hostesses allowed us to walk around and find the quietest spot. That said, although there is no true quiet spot, if you're willing to talk loudly, the atmosphere is great in every other way. The server at the table we ultimately chose (name was \\"Christian\\", I think) was friendly, present, and never intrusive. He seemed to be genuinely interested in our having a good meal and experience and was well versed on wing flavors and heat levels (reason we came!). The beer menu is amazing. For two people/28 wings, the portions were terrific. Everything is baked, not fried...and we are serious wing people so this was interesting. We agreed these were the top wings we have ever had, fried or baked. The hot scale is pretty mild; for a true hot wing person the 85 level we went up to would be easy. The manager came by to check on us about half way through our meals and stayed to chat a bit; a sign of a well-run restaurant and one of the reasons we will return. It was worth the drive for both our groups and we plan on making this our new mid point spot. If you live close to it, lucky you...I can't say enough about how terrific the wings are if you are of that mind :)  One last aside, I am usually a no meat person.

I'd heard a lot of good things about this restaurant and it seems to be very popular with other Yelpers.  The restaurant is located at 510 Piedmont and has it's own small parking lot with valet and on-street parking nearby.  We arrived before the valet, so we parked in the lot and waited until the doors opened at 11:30.  The hostess and server were both friendly and we had no problems with service throughout our meal.  The first course included deviled eggs, and seafood rolls.  The deviled eggs were savory, but was turned out to be our least favorite item that we ate.  Don't get me wrong, they weren't bad but we prefer a more traditional approach.  The seafood spring rolls were amazing.  Fried and served piping hot with a delicious dipping sauce.  I could probably make a meal of these rolls alone.  We shared an entree called a creamy siam which consisted of a stir fry with veggies, and shrimp/scallops.   Rice came on the side and was perfect for absorbing the incredible sauce.  We both thoroughly enjoyed this dish.  We also tried one drink.  My wife had the sangria which was one of the best that I've tried - less sweet, more of a boozy taste but not too much booze.  I had the Mai Tai which was outstanding.  Our last course was the pound cake.  OMG!  They give it a bannanas foster treatment, and add scoops of ice cream (please check out the photo)!  One serving is more than enough for 2, especially if you've had more than one course.  So sweet and satisfying!

My first experience left us waiting 45 minutes to be seated even though we had reservations. No apologies from the management. I thought that was most likely because they were new so I was forgiving. So, tonight, 3 months later, for my birthday dinner, we tried them again. I literally told the guy at the hostess desk to please not let us down and make sure they didn't leave us waiting this time - unbelievably, we waited 40 minutes or longer tonight before they finally seated us even though we had reservations. When I called the manager over to discuss, he had a defensive attitude. If you can't show humility to the customer when you don't get it right especially when you're charging astronomical prices for your food, and when you screw up time and time again, you might as well hang it up - there are plenty of other chop houses in Atlanta that have managed to get it right."},{"name":"Folk Art Restaurant","address":"465 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"First time.

If you're not used to waiting in line for things, well...it can get old. But thankfully buying donuts is not terribly time-consuming and it moves quickly. And yeah, the vegan chocolate donut I got was kind of whatever. Maybe it's because so many people hate on the Voodoo and I had subconsciously lowered my expectations.\\n\\nBut the feels don't lie. And whoa, the vegan cock 'n' balls was GOOD!\\n\\nI'm really picky about my donuts. The ones that are too airy and sort of stale and flavorless? Ick. The ones that are too dense and cakey? Yikes. The ideal donut strikes a balance between sponginess, pliability, density, and yeasty awesomeness.\\n\\nAnd the cock and attached cojones did just that. The shaft is a twist of a yeasty, dense but pliable donut goodness. The balls are the same material but they are full of a thick, viscous--imagery, right?--cream that is sweet without being too sweet. The chocolate frosting is absolutely finger-licking-ly delicious! The donut as a whole is sweet, but not completely overpoweringly so, and really just came together.\\n\\nIf it wasn't for the C&B, I'd probably give this place 2-3 stars, but that (plus maybe the adorable stained-glass anthropomorphic donuts around the outside of the building?

We saw Iris and another server that usually gets us in her section, but this time was different. This time, service was very poor, not the one that I am use to receive here. The person barely smiled, did not engage in a conversation like the other servers usually do. It was an uncomfortable silence while we decided what to order. Iris really sets the bar in this, she usually asks us questions and helps us decide what to order. This time we did not get any of that. After telling my family how excellent the service is, I started to feel embarrassed about the situation. I told them about how good the spinach dip is, and i felt that this time (maybe the recipe changed) was very watery and without flavor. The onion rings were burnt.

These include:\\n\\nFried chicken\\nMeatloaf\\nCatfish (blackened)\\nPork chops (fried and grilled)\\nBroccoli souffle\\nCheese grits\\nSpiced apples\\nWhipped potatoes\\n\\nI've strayed from my favorites of chicken livers, fried okra, collard greens.  Mary Mac's fried chicken is not bad.  The dark meat pieces are juicy and the skin is not overly crispy.  That can be a good thing if you prefer your fried chicken skin not as crunchy.  The meatloaf is delicious.  It's hearty and appetizing.  The blackened catfish is good.  You can also order the catfish fried or grilled.  When it's blackened, it comes as two long fillets, soft and well-seasoned.\\n\\nThe broccoli souffle is very good, but also very oily.  Eating the whole thing could make you feel a little sick.  The cheese grits have a thick consistency and are packed with flavor.

I love that!\\n+ Also, there are vegetarian ramen options!\\n\\n- THE WAIT/SERVICE:\\nExpect a wait, especially since you can't make reservations. The waits are reasonable compared to the other ramen places in town. We've had decent luck around weekday lunch (~10 min wait) and a Monday dinner around 6 (~20 min wait). They have this great text/mobile system where you can keep track of how many people are ahead of you. \\n\\nThe service is FAST and efficient. We got our food in 5 minutes flat after we ordered. \\n\\n- THE RAMEN (and other things):\\nThe takoyaki was beautiful and delicious - a healthy portion of fat, juicy octopus balls. \\n\\nThe tonkotsu miso ramen boasts a rich, but light broth. It was good enough for me to pick up the bowl and tip the broth into my mouth after I was done with the noodles. The pork belly has the perfect texture -- yummy and fatty but still has some bite to it. Add in mushrooms and scallions and you're gold. Make sure to add a soft-boiled egg for extra richness.\\n\\nThe goma miso is a must try if you're a fan of sesame (like I am). The broth is much creamier and richer and the ramen comes with a great hot sesame oil. \\n\\nThank you Santouka for finally bringing your excellent ramen to Boston so this girl can stop making pilgrimages to NJ and CA."},{"name":"Katana Teppanyaki & Sushi","address":"3345 Lenox Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Popped in with a party of 5 and left with happy tummies.

Great venue for a hang out with friends or family. OUTSTANDING services, DELICIOUS foods, BEAUTIFUL venue, and FAIR price for an upscale restaurant and HIGH QUALITY food.\\n\\nI visited 1618 Asian Fusion 3 times during their soft opening on October 4, October 13, and October 26. The menu changes each time with new items for each visit and every dish was GREAT.\\n\\nI don't provide review much so this is a rarity. I've confirmed this one is worth writing about with the multiple visits and trying lots of items on their menu.\\n\\nDishes I've ordered:\\nBar and Cocktails\\n1. Tropical Asian\\n2. Pink Coco\\n3. House Wine\\n\\nThe drinks were okay and tasty. You don't taste strong alcohol so heavy drinkers might not like it. Those who like fruity drinks will likely enjoy these drinks. The best part here is the price!! Can't beat it so keep those orders coming....\\n\\nAppetizer\\n1. Papaya Salad\\n2. Grilled Octopus\\n3. Grilled Lemongrass Duck Skewer\\n4. Wonton Soup\\n5. Tum Yum Soup\\n\\nAll the appetizers were good and I would order them again. The Duck Skewer and Wonton Soup were awesome! The meat on the Duck just falls off the bone like a good ribs and super moist. The Wonton Soup were an absolute delight. My daughter couldn't have enough and kept asking for more.\\n\\nEntree\\n1. Pho Brisket and Filet Mignon\\n2. Hu Tieu Saigon\\n3. Whole Roast Duck\\n4. Filet Mignon Pepper Steak\\n5. Imperial Crispy Redfish\\n\\nI recommend all the entree dishes above and you can't go wrong with any of them. The Filet Mignon in the Pho and the sweet broth (no MSG) is what separate this dish apart from the other pho places.\\n\\nThe Hu Tieu is a safe and fulfilling dish. It's quite good for an everyday food item. \\n\\n1618 Asian Fusion did a very nice thing with the roast duck where there's no bone except for the legs. That's so convenient and make it that much more enjoyable. I did used the sauce for more flavor  and wouldn't mind the skin being more crispy and crunchy (understanding there is a balance to prevent burnt). This dish was served with white rice and serve 2.\\n\\nOne of my favorites is the crispy redfish. As you can see from the pictures other uploaded, the dish was beautifully presented. There is so much good flavor packed into this dish, you don't need to use any of the side fish sauce that came with it. You'll need 3-4 people to finish up this fish or can take the leftover to go.\\n\\nOverall, I like the atmosphere and it's modern. On a night when there's no band (Oct 4) multi genre music is played in the background and provide a soothing environment. I experienced two nights with music entertainment, the Southsiders on Oct 13 and Kate Metz (7 yrs old sensation) on Oct 26. That's nice to support the local artists.

Usually I get the same thing each time with good service. However, my server today, Nhi, didn't even bother to write down my order and forgot to get my ramen added with the extra spicy request. Because of this, the flavoring of the entire meal was off and it just didn't taste right. She gave me a thing of spicy sauce after and didn't charge me for it but the ramen just tasted off - nowhere near as good as how it usually tastes and this was due to this server's carelessness. After dropping off the food, she never came back to check on us to make sure we were doing ok, and as a server myself I think making sure that your customer's food tastes ok after you drop off their food one of the most important parts of serving. My water was also never refilled by her and I had to ask another server for more water.

Noticed in store they had a ton of daily specials (or at least not on their menu online) of sicilian slices, too -- I think 4/7 were veg, and all looked really good.\\n\\nGot home, really happy with the whole order. Greek salad was more than just greens (yay!) and had tons of olives, which I loved. One note - it seemed pre-dressed, but I'm pretty sure that was just from the olives & pickled peppers, etc -- the house vinaigrette that came with offered nice additional flavor when added. Tropic Thunder pizza was an interesting blend of flavors, very sweet/salty/pickled with the little bit of sesame as a curveball. We're excited to see what the other unique combos are like too.\\n\\nMaybe worth mentioning we didn't get any napkins or forks with our order -- we actually really appreciate that bc we end up with so much disposable stuff from takeout and delivery that we don't need & it's usually terrible for the environment.

The restaurant was much bigger than I expected. The entire place had a homey feel, and the walls are covered in pictures of famous/important people that have enjoyed the Mary Mac experience. \\n\\nThe menu listed out reasonably priced southern cooking meals- each looking more delicious than the last. The main entrees are served with the customer's choice of two sides- again all the sides looked like great choices. All meals are also served with a basket of bread, the cornbread was my favorite. \\n\\nWhen you're ready to order you just write it down on the menu papers provided. I thought this was awesome, something I've never seen before. Also- if you are a first time customer, you'll get a special treat. \\n\\nMy delicious meal started off with the Fried Green Tomato appetizer, one of their most popular dishes. At first I was hesitant, since I had never even heard of this dish, but it was awesome. I would suggest this appetizer to any Mary Mac customers. \\n\\nI debated between ordering the Chicken Fried Chicken and the Chicken and Dumplings, but ended up ordering the Chicken and Dumplings when my boyfriend agreed to share some of his Chicken Fried Chicken. Both dishes were lovely. The Chicken and Dumplings consisted of shredded chicken and long flat noodle like dumplings in a soup broth- excellent. \\n\\nAs for the sides I selected the Mac and Cheese, which tasted like it came straight out of a southern gradmomma's kitchen. I also got the Spiced Apples, which actually turned out to be my dessert (and no, they're not actually spicy, just spiced with cinnamon).  \\n\\nMary Mac's is a great place to have a brunch party or grab a meal with friends and family.

It was essentially an overpriced fried chicken patty topped with a fried egg. No greens to lighten it up, no sauce to counteract the dryness.

The Hot & Sour soup was flavorless and NOT spicy in the least (my toddler asked to try it and I didn't think twice about sharing), and the consistency was thick and glutinous and rather unpleasant. The Hot Pepper Pork sounded intriguing (I was envisioning spicy shredded pork or the like), so imagine my shock and disappointment when I opened it up to find a bunch of weird fried balls in a cloyingly sweet \\"hot and spicy\\" sauce (it was neither of these). It reminded me of an unwelcome, strange, vaguely Asian twist on the Indian dessert gulab jamun (yuck!). Finally, I often order Triple Delight so gave that a try as well, but I was almost scared to eat it when I opened the container and was hit with a strong fishy smell (surprisingly, that shrimp ended up being the tastiest part of the entire meal!). Triple Delight usually comes in a savory brown sauce, and while this sauce was indeed brown, it was so overwhelmingly sweet that I couldn't eat it. Not a single thing in our order was edible, and my husband, who is the least picky eater in the universe, agrees with me on all counts.

If you are coming as a large group, maybe 5+ people, I would call ahead of time to reserved a table or come extra early just to be on the safe side (reservation availability depends/vary). \\n\\nWhat is Vietnam Cuisine famous for? \\nThe Bun Bo Hue or Spicy Beef Noodle Soup, which is very flavorful, , savory, and mouthwatering. Eating this dish reminds me of the city Hue in Vietnam, where the origin of Bun Bo Hue first started. The taste is exactly the same, making it #1 in Orlando, Florida by far! In addition, there is Banh Cuon Nong (Vietnamese steam rice rolls with pork, mushroom filling, served with Vietnamese homemade sausage), Com Tam Rice Platter (comes in with different options of meat), Bun Cha Ha Noi (charbroiled pork served rice noodles and herbs), and Cha Ca Thanh Long (special fish paste and marinated tilapia, fried, served on an individual grilled plate). \\n\\nOn a regular basis, I would order fresh coconut (extremely refreshing and sweet), fried egg rolls (golden, crispy, savory), Bun Bo Hue (**the taste of home**). Occasionally, I would also order the Banh Cuon Nong, Banh Uot, Chicken rice platter, fried rice, and the classic Pho (meatballs only). Though that may be, it all really depends on my mood and appetite for the day haha. Moreover, my dad always order their Cafe Sua Da or Vietnamese Iced Coffee and Banh Bao (steamed rice bun stuffed with meat and veggie filling) to go. My brother loves those buns (better than my mom's) since they are fluffy and smooth.  \\n\\nOverall, the foods here are great. My family and I enjoy our meals every time we visit. The workers are friendly. The environment is sociable and casual but can get loud with kids \\"singing\\" and adults chatting and gossiping.

The manager told me that they simply decided not to answer their phones because they were too busy and that she had directed them to do so. Upon looking around I saw that the majority of the tables were empty and there was no line at the counter so I don't understand how they could have possibly been too busy to at least answer their phone. The manager simply told me that she would not have waited on the phone that long and did not seem to think that there was any problem with neglecting their phone lines altogether. She was very unapologetic and told me that was \\"just how it is\\". If they do not intend to answer their phone, they need to have a message on their phone line that says so. We ended up ordering anyway and waiting in the restaurant and after all of that they got our order wrong.

That had to be among the freshest shrimp I have ever had. The scallops melted in my mouth like butter. Just a great dish. I had the whole calamari appetizer which was good but I think I prefer the cut ring version because of the extra crunch.

Granted it was on a weekend, but it made me uncertain I'd try again.\\n\\nThe second visit was during the week, so the wait was about 20 to 25 minutes, which I still think is a big drawback, particularly when you're hungry. They are nice about providing free coffee for those waiting, but it's still something that makes me reluctant to return. \\n\\nDuring my second visit, the music was again loud -- so loud (and the hard surfaces of everything in the place bouncing all that sound around too readily), the packed-full restaurant's clientele was all talking loudly to be heard over the music. \\n\\nMy dining mates and I were told right up front of a few items that they were out of. This was maybe halfway through their open hours, so it was not like they had run out of these items right before closing time. They still had 4 more hours of being open to go and they were already out of prime items. Which for a restaurant that is always this busy seemed an oversight of management.\\n\\nOne of my dining mates and I ended up ordering an alternate dish (because we could not get what we really wanted). Only to be told 20 minutes later -- and AFTER the chef had already prepared our meals -- that what we had ordered also had ingredients that were now no longer in stock and the chef had made substitutions. The staff had not warned us of this so we could make another menu choice. They had just made the ingredient substitutions and prepared the meals without asking our preference. AND expected us to take it and pay the full price for it, whether we liked those substitutions or not. With the substituted ingredients, the dish felt like a patched together medley, not something worth the price or the wait. And there was nothing at all special to its flavorings. We did not have the time to refuse those meals they'd done and wait for some other item we would have preferred as another alternate choice. So we went ahead and ate what they gave us. But we both felt infuriated that they would assume so much and leave us no choice. They did not discount the price of the meal or comp us anything, which would have been a decent thing to do when you take liberties like that. We weren't trying to be difficult or picky, but just eat something we both really wanted to eat!\\n\\nPlus, I ordered an additional dessert-like item that they got wrong. I had pointed the waiter to a dish a neighboring diner had and I'd described it at the same time (quite distinctly and clearly, I thought), so there is no way he could have mistaken what I was talking about, but the wrong menu item came. So then we had to wait another chunk of time for them to prepare the item I'd originally asked for. It was at least quite delicious, but all this just added up to a very frustrating experience. \\n\\nOne last thing -- we ran out of water maybe halfway through the time we were there but they did not replenish the bottle until right before we were leaving. Just a small oversight but still annoying.\\n\\nThey have some truly great dishes (if you can get them!) and wonderful condiments/extras they prepare freshly and with inventive flavor combinations. But the hassles of always having to wait, fighting to hear your companions speak, facing two rounds of substitutions and still not ending up with something you want to eat, plus having to pay full price for those items you don't want, makes me very wary about ever coming here again."},{"name":"Mei-Ling Restaurant","address":"434A Salem St","city":"Medford","stars":"3.5","text":"Very unfriendly counter service !

From the naming of their dishes (sighaara instead of samosa; mang-sho; moong dal) to their waitstaff, I felt this place was different from other Indian restaurants. There was no whitewashed chicken tikka masala here. But at the same time, this felt like Bengali cuisine without the flavor. More turmeric, more cumin, more ginger. All were needed. We asked for medium spicy, and got absolutely no kick at all. Perhaps this is to make the restaurant more palatable to non-Indian customers. If so, the strategy is working, because the place was packed and the reviews are great. We had the appetizer platter, which consisted of two singhaaras and three pakoras. Fish dopiazza, which is pretty much a fish fillet covered with yellowed onions. And the lamb biryani, which is cubed lamb cooked underneath a blanket of rice.

The bread was fantastic! It melted in your mouth. I opted for the Caesar salad, which was just okay to me. It was heavily dressed and the flavor was so-so. We had a roasted mushroom appetizer that was swimming in a rich sauce and served with toast points, roasted beets, crispy brussel sprouts, and another type of salad I can't remember.  I liked the brussel sprouts and the beets the best. The accompaniments to these dishes complimented the main vegetable well. They had a nice drink list but I had opted for wine.  Service was good, not great. \\n\\nI wasn't blown away, but certain dishes were very good and I'd come back for those. Actually the popover bread in itself is enough for me for me to return.

The food bins had mixed ingredients (veggies in the meat bins, beans in the veggies) and the entire area was a mess. Spilled guacamole, queso, salsa, you name it. \\n\\nSo anyway, I finally made it through (after waiting 20 minutes).

They did bring me a complimentary salad, that was alright, but I would have rather just not had anything at all.  The part that made me upset was that they had the nerve to charge me for my chicken.

It appears from other comments that they frequently get complaints on customer service. \\n\\nDonuts weren't the best.. But here's the problem. We took our box outside to enjoy our donuts and they were all squished, my kids.. So exited to see the donuts they just picked out.. All squished together. To me, that is flat out rude.\\n\\nI understand they are over priced most likely because they have been on TV how ever, ended up spending 19.55 on a box of one dozen donuts... Which we had to pay CASH ONLY for unexpectedly. Not friendly at all.. Very weird environment and workers.. also very dirty.

Two people on our group got breakfast sandwiches, and they kept raving about the bacon and how good the breakfast potatoes were. Lastly, the wings were great.

It was served with grilled bread (a couple of spots were completely blackened, but my half was fine). The flavors all complimented so well, and the cheese was smooth and fresh.

Most of the dishes were centered around this theme; several contrasting flavors, unique combinations. They were all discernable, you could taste each flavor, cascading from one to the next, not competing or crowding. The key lime pie was the exact same way. So many flavors. I liked it more than the chocolate. The desserts were $12 each. The price wasn't listed online, I doubt I would have ordered two if I had known.

It immediately brought me back to a classic New York pizzeria. A strong fume of pizza rolled out the door and made me start to salivate as the deli counter style pizza kitchen took over the ambiance. The place was packed with people standing at the chest high tables and wherever they could really to eat large slices of hot pizza. Dough was flying in the air and flour coated employees scrambled about to help customers and clean up vacant spots. It was perfect pizzeria atmosphere.\\n\\nI had to go traditional and got a slice of cheese and a slice of pepperoni. Despite the place being packed ordering only took a few minutes, and actually getting the pizza took only a few minutes as well. All the staff was nice and let us know that if we wanted a whole pie we could easily order online or call, and it would be ready in about 15 minutes, as we mentioned we were going on the sunset cruise the next day (we ended up doing just that and taking a whole pie on the cruise)\\n\\nThe pizza itself was really everything I was expecting and hoping for. The crust was perfect being firm but foldable with a slight oven char on the bottom. The cheese wasn't really oily and was in the right proportion for me being a huge lover of extra cheese. The sauce isn't overpowering or in large globs and complimented with the cheese in proportion not letting it slide off the crust. For the pepperoni slice I had, the pepperoni were done correct as well making the slight little cups with crispy rim with that tiny pool of pepperoni grease in them. \\n\\nIt was the perfect New York Slice, that I honestly would put on the same level with Joe's or Di Fara.

I did read a few Yelpers' comment before the visit. Some is very good and some point out there a few things for room for improvement. \\n\\nWhen I walk in on a Saturday night, I saw that the whole restaurant is packed. After I being seated, I waited about 5 - 10 minutes before greeted by a waitress. And waited about 25 - 30 mins for our food after I order. I would say since they just open, they may not have enough staffs just yet. But our waitress is very nice and quite attentive.\\n\\nNext up is the food part. I ordered the fried mushrooms, bowl of chili and some wings. The amount of batter that covered the mushrooms is just right. As you take a bite, you can feel the juiciness of the mushroom burst out. The bowl of chili tasted so so, the amount of bean overtake the overall taste of the chili. Highlight of the meal is the WINGS. The wings have the right amount of sauce coated on each wing. Crispy outside and juicy inside. I would said Woody's maybe will become my to go place for wings.\\n\\nOverall, I think the overall experience is good. No matter where you sit in the restaurant, you will find yourself surrounded by TVs. Given that they only open for a few day or so, there are still some room for improvement on the service speed.

The mine was crazy, out the door, and the wait was about 20 minutes. I'll start by saying our server was great. I loved the bread basket. The food was good, but I was not wowed. Based on how packed it was and how long the wait was, and the prices for pretty basic soul food, I expected to be wowed. Not saying it was expensive, it was reasonable, I just expected a higher quality. I got the catfish plate with Mac and cheese and okra, and I asked for it half and half (one fried, one blackened). They brought out the fried filet and completely forgot about the blackened one. It didn't come out until I had completely finished everything else.

The shredded cheese had a nice cheddar flavor and was mixed with flavorful diced pimento peppers and onion. The Fried Chicken (which Mary Mac's is best known for) was the star of the meal with tender chicken and perfectly crispy breading.

I feel like there was never a high-demand for the restaurant, so to remain relevant, they added this lackluster character dining experience. We had a reservation for 2 on a Thursday night at 9 pm and the restaurant was packed-- no longer the mostly-empty restaurant it once was.  At $55 for the three-course meal, it is pretty expensive, but slightly cheaper than most other character dining experiences on property.\\n\\nYou start your meal with pre-selected appetizers: shrimp cocktail, winter squash bisque, and a mini meat pie. I was so excited for the dining experience to being because all of the photos I had seen online looked amazing. Unfortunately as soon as they brought out the food, the disappointment began to set in. These appetizers are SO TINY! The soup was maybe two spoonfuls, each person gets one shrimp, and you could've put the entire mini pie in your mouth at once. Nothing tasted stand-out either: the soup was the best of the three, but none of the three really wowed us with any spectacular flavors. The soup & pie were also both so extremely salty that you didn't taste much else besides the salt.\\n\\nFor the entrees, we ordered the \\"A Stroll Through Nature\\" (butternut squash gnocchi) and the \\"Magic Mirror Slow Braised Veal Shank\\" (veal shank with mashed celery root). I will say the entrees were amazing. Both were also extremely salty, but they were also perfectly cooked & had a ton of other great flavors shining through. The gnocchi is a very heavy, rich dish, so I'd recommending ordering that with something else not as heavy. It has a very rich cream & cheese sauce smothered over perfectly cooked gnocchi and little chunks of butternut squash throughout. I can't recommend this dish enough. Don't let the fact that it's technically the vegetarian dish turn you away! Similarly, the veal shank was outstanding. It was cooked perfectly, fell right off the bone, and the slightly vinegar-y jus overtop perfectly blended with the mashed celery root. Both of these entrees were very large portions & we were so full after plowing through half of them, but they were both so delicious that we kept going back for more bites until both plates were clean. The entrees were the only redeeming quality of this meal & the reason they make it to 3 stars despite so many other shortcomings.\\n\\nThe dessert was another pre-selected miniature trio that consisted of a mini gooseberry pie, a cupcake stacked in a mini jar, and a \\"Poison Apple\\" (sour white chocolate mousse). These desserts, just like the appetizers, were unbelievably disappointing, especially after the amazing entr√©e round. The \\"Miner's Treasure\\" cupcake was a small bit of cake loaded up with frosting. You can get this anywhere in a Disney theme park, so it was lame that they would choose to serve this at a table-service restaurant. It did have a cute presentation & looked like Dopey (one of the dwarfs) because it was purple & green and hat a little dwarf hat on top (made of white chocolate), but alas it was just an over-frosted cupcake. The gooseberry pie and the mouse apple were both so strange. Both of these were so sour we couldn't eat more than a bite. The apple was especially strange because it was a sour flavor mixed into the white chocolate mousse.  Very unexpected, and not in a good way. Just like the appetizers, all of these desserts were unbelievably tiny. \\n\\nAs for the character meet-and-greet portion of the dinner, this too was a let down. Snow White, Dopey, and one other dwarf (I believe Grumpy) walk around to greet diners while they sit at their table. The Snow Queen is standing n the center of the dining room and you're supposed to go up to meet her mid-meal whenever you choose. None of the characters stopped at our table during our meal, and only 20 minutes after we had paid the bill & signed our names, did Snow White & Dopey come by. They still continued to ignore us until we told their character attendant that we didn't have a chance to meet them yet. This was annoying because 1) we didn't want to sit around at the meal for so long after we'd already paid and 2) the characters went up to every other table around us during their meal and just completely ignored us. Grumpy never came to our table. We then got up to meet the Snow Queen on our way out the door. I don't like how you have to stand up to meet the Snow Queen, because you risk getting in line to meet her when one of your food courses is placed on the table. Then by the time you come back from meeting, your food is cold. It also looks weird that there is a big line of people waiting to meet her in the middle of the restaurant most of the night.\\n\\nAll in all, I wish this restaurant never adopted this tactic to draw in more people.

She had the \\"Duck Fat Poached\\" Swordfish ($34), which came on top of short rib. Never had swordfish until this night, but I really enjoyed it. Apparently, swordfish gets dry when cooked which is why that poach it in duck fat after cooking it some. This fish was certainly not dry. The flavors and textures were really well together. I ordered the Grouper which came with sungold tomatoes, basil, and chilis ($32), which I got because our server recommended it. So glad I listened! The flavors worked really well together and it felt light and fresh. It had a citrusy flavor together, but I loved it. We shared a vegetable side, the Summer Squash ($10) which I enjoyed. Tasted almost pesto-y, which I will never complain about. Well cooked and flavored. \\n\\nDESSERT: It was a treat yoself night so we got three desserts. The first was the blueberry pudding cake ($8-9?), which was quite good. Moist, well flavored, had compote, with good presentation. We also got a strawberry ice cream ($4), which was very tasty, creamy, and strong on the strawberry flavor, which I appreciated. Last was the lemon pie ($8?), which was quite tart in flavor and thick in consistency. It kind of reminded me of a key lime pie, but more lemony. I liked it! \\n\\nSERVICE: Wonderful. Our server (I think her name was Caroline or Carolyn) was very friendly, very sweet, very attentive, and answered all of our questions. She knew her stuff regarding the menu and ingredients and was very thoughtful, such as remembering my friend had an almond allergy so was careful to point out all the items on the menu that had nuts. Great job! \\n\\nAMBIANCE: We got a booth table and got to look out into the restaurant. High ceilings and it feels very open, and you can see into the kitchen some. Nicely decorated -- classy but not over the top. \\n\\nOVERALL: The food is amazing -- both in terms of presentation and taste. Service is great. Ambiance is great. Great beer and wine list.

All the staff were polite and attentive and provided top notch service. Once my wife and I ordered our came out within minutes and it was delicious.

The smothered chicken was perfect is was crispy (even with the gravy on it) and juicy.

This past week I came in accompanied with my friend and ordered my usual Lobster Fried Rice and Seafood Spring rolls. At the end of the meal I had a lot of food left, more than 1/2 of my lobster fried rice and spring roll since I order two orders this particular night. There was a new bartender behind the bar also named David that packed up my leftovers. The next afternoon my mouth was watering to eat the remainder of my foot only to find that it was someone else 1/2 eaten food that was given to me. As we all know the prices of the entrees are pretty steep to not be able to enjoy your leftovers. I contacted the restaurant and was told the manager was out and to call back in 15 mins. I do so, to find the manager is still out and that they will have him contact me. Hours go by, and I contact the restaurant again. They informed me he received the message and would call me when he got a moment. I received a call at 11PM from the manager. 11PM!!! I would like to know where this is an acceptable time to call someone? He left me a message and asked me to call back. When I called the next day during an appropriate time I received no answer, no return phone call to my voicemail or text message. The issue has yet to be resolved. Let me further mention the night of my dining experience the valet carelessly left someone else keys in our vehicle and we were nice enough to drive 30 mins out of our way after arriving to our next destination to return them back to them.

I always like when you get to see what you're potentially ordering. The place only takes cash, though, and most of the donuts (for a single donut) range from $1.50-$3.50. I ordered the Chuckles doughnut based on the staff's personal recommendation.\\n\\nThe doughnut tastes like a Nestle Drumstick with its peanuts, chocolate, and caramel, but in doughnut form. It's a pretty delicious concept but poorly executed. The donut was rather dry and it seemed like the toppings weren't really fused with the donut but instead in its own crusted layer sitting on top. The donut also wasn't warm which made it taste even sadder. I will say I love their Voodoo Doughnut box packaging; the pink really stands out. \\n\\nBut would I ever buy a dozen for the box? Never.

There are usually at least two or three meat dishes, with tandoori-style chicken and chicken tikka masala taking center stage; I've also had beef and goat curries. Vegetable options almost always include the saag paneer (creamed spinach with homemade cheese) and aloo kopi (essentially a potato and cauliflower stir fry).

It can get kind of pricey if you're ordering a lot, but you'll wind up with leftovers unless you have a huge crowd.

Prices are excellent - you could make two meals out of one plate and most people seem to take leftovers.  Round this out with a nice dining room, good children's menu, cocktails and aggressively friendly free refills on soda and tea...and I wonder, \\"who could ask for more?\\"\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDo not be discouraged if you get the cold shoulder when you first come in.  It happened to our party of four and I worried that Mary Mac's was going to be a Titanic voyage...but finally one of the four people at the host station got to us (in the virtually empty waiting area) within 10 minutes.  Service changed as soon as we were seated, going from snotty  & slow to smooth & fast  immediately.\\n\\nThe waitress hands each diner a form.  It's so easy:  fill out what you want, pick 2 of the sides (from a list of about THREE DOZEN), add more sides for a mere $3 per, and give it to the waitress.  Your soul food meal will appear, miracle like, in maybe 10 to 15 minutes.  \\n\\nThis is a smooth operation.  \\n\\n The average price for a meal is around $11 - this includes two sides, a small serving of pot likker, and bread.  Seafood meals average about $16.  If you're like me and can't get enough side dishes, the price for the standard \\"vegetable plate\\"  (your choice of four sides) is only $10.  If you are a pop drinker like myself, a soda is $2.39 and they bring you a new glass when your drink is half empty.  My greedy pop drinking inner child loves that.\\n\\nThe food is very, very good.  No, it won't be your auntie or grandma's food...it can't be...but this is a good substitute.  I was particularly impressed with the fried green tomatoes.  They were the best I've had because:  they were pickled, the coating was crisp and they were fat!  Yum!  Praise for the sweet potato souffle is warranted - it was sweet and fairly light.\\n\\nThe fried chicken livers were very good - the coating was light and not too heavily seasoned.  The sign of a good fried chicken liver is tenderness...and these were very tender.  My children loved the fried chicken, but not the mac and cheese...I'd say it was my kid's aesthetic, not Mary Mac's preparation, at fault.  This is true soul style mac that is like a casserole that you can cut in squares...my kids are (unfortunately ) into the \\"orange stuff in the blue box\\".  Oh well!  More food for me!  Bring me another pop to wash it down!!\\n\\nThe dining areas are nice and harken back to about 50 years ago with the decor - imagine a large, nice middle class dining room in the late 40s, early 50s.  I found it very clean.  The Tea Room is actually made of a series of rooms - this is a big place!  There are several restrooms - ours was not in the best shape, but passable.\\n\\nNew soul places could learn a thing about ambiance from Miss Mary Mac's!!  Clearly, they have a lot of things ready to go in steam tables in the back.  Most places these days, you walk down a line with a tray, point to what you like - cafeteria style.  That's okay - but it sure would be nice to have a few more places that allow you to sit down and enjoy a down home meal the Mary Mac Way.\\n\\nSoul food enthusiasts should definitely go!"},{"name":"Sky Dragon Restaurant","address":"1538 Prairie Avenue","city":"Port Coquitlam","stars":"3.5","text":"The food here is always hot and fresh.

I mean everyone we talked to raved about it so how could we not go?!\\n\\nBouldin Creek is located in a cute neighborhood in the midst of many little shops. When we arrived it was about 1 p.m. on a Saturday and it was packed. There was only a 15-minute wait for brunch though -- not too bad.\\n\\nWhen we finally sat down, we realized how extensive their menu was. They offer many varieties of breakfast plates, salads, and sandwiches. They pride themselves on serving fresh vegetarian food made from scratch and are known for their tofu. Their tofu is actually locally made by White Mountain Foods.  I, specifically, wanted to try their tofu.\\n\\nOnce again, Zach and I decided to order the same thing. It is funny that out of all the things on the menu, we went for the same thing -- The Renedict. Zach also ordered a coffee and I ordered a rose lemonade.\\n\\nThe coffeehouse was bustling on this Saturday afternoon. It was eclectically decorated with red ceilings and yellow walls along with various unique lighting structures including a light made from a bicycle wheel. Artwork from a local artist was displayed on the walls.\\n\\nAfter a little time, our renedicts were served. As you probably guessed, this is a play on eggs benedict. It was tofu served on grilled ciabatta (open-faced) topped with baby spinach and locally-grown tomatoes. On top was their homemade vegan Hollandaise and it was sooo good. There were also slices of tofu bacon, which were surprisingly similar to regular bacon. The sauce was rich, the tofu had a unique texture and flavor, and the bacon was divine. I loved it all! On the side, I had organic red and black beans -- also very good.\\n\\nThe meal was huge and we were stuffed, but our waitress still convinced us to get a dessert so we took one of their brownies home with us.

The service and staff were prompt, nice and very helpful. Food was delicious and such LARGE quantities, drinks were amazing and OMGoodness, the dessert was divine! For more details:\\n\\nStaff: Everyone was very sweet and very helpful. I learned a lot about the different steak cuts, how to prep and cook them and they put up with all my questions :P\\n\\nFood: \\nFor the appetizers, we got the fried shrimp, fried green tomatoes and the chicken wings. I didn't try the shrimp but it was a crowd favorite at the table.  For the chicken wings, once again they were good but not phenomenal. They had a dry rub on them and I'm more biased for a sauce/glaze.The fried green tomatoes were alright, they were good but not the best that I have had. They were a little too bready but I love my carbs so I had no problem finishing them off. Out of the three appetizers, the fried green tomatoes were the least favorite of the group, not saying they were bad but compared to the other 2 these weren't as popular but they were my favorite.\\n\\nDrinks: When we first arrived, I was greeted with a melvin mule.. they used whiskey instead of vodka and I liked this new combo. The ginger flavor in there was just the right amount for me...some people felt it was too strong but I LOVED it. Once again, this worked out in my favor because my friend passed me her drink and I ended up with 2 :P. After the mule, I got their perfect margarita and once again didn't dissapoint. \\n\\n\\nEntrees: After the appetizers ,we got a choice of either soup or salad and since I had decided that today was going to be my \\"forget healthy and indulge myself\\" I chose the loaded potato soup. The soup was amazing.. it was thick, creamy, and full of bacon and potato flavor. Can't really go wrong with the combination. After the soup, I decided to go with the outlaw ribeye and IT WAS HUMONGOUS and the mac and cheese! pretty sure I could have eaten that for 4 meals and still have some leftover. The steak was juicy and perfectly cooked but I couldn't eat more than a couple bites as I had filled myself up with the appetizers earlier. The mac and cheese was rich, luxurious and perfect for my guilt free meal. Finallly, best part of the meal, the DESSERT: I got to try the strawberry shortcake and the chocolate cake/ice cream dessert (forget the name) The shortcake was delicious and reminded me of a tres leches cake, very moist and sweet and flavorful...but it was nothing compared to the chocolate cake dessert. That was a masterpiece..I have a giant sweethtooth and this dessert was perfect! You got 2 large slices of multilayered chocolate cake and 2 giant scoops of ice cream and all of this is covered in chocolate sauces...I still dream about it. The cake was moist, the frostings and the mousse filling were the right level of sweetness without causing toothaches and the ice cream combo was just heavenly.

When I politely said excuse me this has nuts all over it she simply said yes it does I'll have that remade. I was pretty appalled that a manager did not even come to the table and apologize when I literally could have had to go to the emergency room.

There's tons of cool stuff to look at on the walls, including a giant donut that's apparently been stolen on more than a few occasions. The music that happened to be blaring through the speakers during my 5-10 minute jaunt was some kind of cacophonous mess with thrashing guitars and Darth Vader on vocals, and the kids working behind the counter were so detached and disinterested, it was almost a joke. But hey - it's pretty much exactly what I expected. Apparently, every employee there is an ordained minister, and if you feel like getting married at the doughnut shop - you can! And within just moments, too!\\n\\nThe downside is that the doughnuts themselves leave a lot to be desired. Most of them taste like your standard grocery store doughnut, only with odd ball ingredients piled on top like stale cereal and Oreo cookies. They do get creative and their doughnuts will give you a bit of a rise, but that's about all. The penis shaped doughnut and the \\"Blazer Blunt\\" which resembles lit joint are just a couple of the comical creations that are undoubtedly fun to look at... but not as fun to eat.\\n\\nBeing that bacon is my weakness, I devoured their bacon maple bar... which is pretty much exactly what it sounds like. A maple bar with two slices of cooked, crispy bacon on top. It's no match for the bacon maple doughnut at Dynamo in SF, but really, what is? \\n\\nDefinitely glad I was able to squeeze this into my travel plans, but I did expect a little more from the doughnuts themselves, due to the massive amount of national attention this place receives."},{"name":"Union Oyster House","address":"41 Union St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Hello, \\n\\nMy girlfriend and I have been in Boston since Saturday and have gone out for almost every meal. \\n\\n#1 The meal was AMAZING!!!

My duck with the dirty rice and andouille sausage was just ok.  The flavor of the duck was good, but it was supposed to be medium well and it wasn't and it was also a bit too tough.

I was, however, disappointed that it only came with ground pork and not chasu slices (sad face). We also ordered the fried chicken appetizer and it was the size of an entr√©e! Sooo delish, but it is something to be shared with 2 or more people. \\n\\nOverall, everything was great. We came for Saturday lunch, and was seated immediately. The restaurant is fairly small, so I wouldn't recommend this for large parties. The service was also great, our server was super attentive. \\n\\nIt's a thumbs up, and I would come back again!"},{"name":"Rosie's Coffee Cafe","address":"2330 Sylvan Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Great little spot off the beaten path.

I guess the avocado was good. Also, there was a random watermelon slice on the plate, but chips are 2$ extra.

A perfectly central and equal driving place.  SO WHAT?!  I would have driven to Pflugerville to meet her if I'd know how horrible it was going to be there!  So here's why... \\n\\n1.  If you're a Mexican food restaurant and you screw up queso, that's already a bad thing.  Basically, I think that they took velvetta and melted it.  My 10 year old cousin has a better grasp of queso!  If you're going to pull the queso crap - at least throw in Rotel!  Nope - straight up cheese (should I say oil with coloring)?!  \\n\\n2.  Another bad sign is when your waitress comes back to ask 3 times \\"what did you order\\"?  Then she pretends in a baby sized restaurant that she can't see me trying to flag her down...really?  Homegirl had plenty of time to chit chat with all her fellow drag-butt co-workers that also had no sense of urgency.  \\n\\n3.  How do you screw up cheese enchiladas?  THEY DID\\n\\n4.  They also screwed up quesadillas - an equally easy thing to make.\\n\\n5.  I wanted the cabrito, but wasn't able to part with $19 - especially when most other things on the menu were under $9.  \\n\\nMy husband had some taco plate - all CRAP!  They also have tried to squeeze as many things on one table as possible.  Tables are too small for them to give us a Route 44 size complimentary water and our drinks, too.  \\n\\nLast, but not least...when have you ever gotten a Corona w/o lime served to you?

The counter is decorated with corrugated metal, and the walls are covered with various framed pictures and paintings and what not of cats.

The restaurant was spacious and had a good amount of tables. The restaurant was only half full so we got seats right away. We initially ordered a large braised beef flank and tendon with noodle in soup ($11.95), and marinated pork ear ($4.95). We weren't full so we added a large pork and vegetable dumplings ($9.00), which had 15 pieces. \\n\\nI was amazed at how big the large was, and you know it is big when they give you a ladle! I thought the noodles were excellent, they had the perfect chewiness to them. The beef flank and tendons were enormous. Tendons at many restaurants are often too chewy but not at this place. They were tender enough to eat without any difficulty. We concluded that a large might not be enough to split between two but might be too much for 1 person, unless you have a big appetite, then yes, go for the large. \\n\\nWe were a little disappointed at the marinated pig ear. My mom thought they would taste better if they were bigger pieces instead of serving them in slices. They weren't crunchy either so we didn't really enjoy the dish. We were also a little confused on the marinate part, the pig ears weren't marinated themselves but just had a kind of sweet sauce drizzled on top of them. It didn't really taste that good with the sauce. \\n\\nAfter finishing these two dishes, we were still hungry so we ordered a large pork and vegetable dumplings. We were provided with light sesame oil, soy sauce, and vinegar. Although we had to wait about 10 minutes for them, they came out steaming hot. The skin wasn't too thick and the meat filling was flavourful. They were reasonably sized, but not something we would get again next time.\\n\\nOverall, service was good. The server was confused when I asked her to take away the empty dishes. She thought I wanted to pack the soup to go. Space was limited since we sat at a two-people table.

Jen was our server and she was hustling Monday night. The back room was packed, but she had total control.

They were unbelievable! I've never been so happy covered in mustard based bbq sauce as I was while eating those wings. We only ate 1/2 of it knowing the ribs were coming. Each of us ordered the half racks and each came with one side. My husband had his with mac & cheese and I had mine with sweet potato fries. The ribs were smoked to perfection, smothered in South Carolina sauce, and the meat just fell off the bones. So good. So good. \\n\\nTheir beer menu is HUGE. 60 beers! You really need a good 5 minutes to look through it. My husband ordered a couple of Melvin Hubert IPAs while I started with the Passionfruit Hard Cider, then changed it up to Downeast Cider made locally in East Boston. I really enjoyed both. The passionfruit was delightfully refreshing, and the Downeast tasted like drinking apple pie.

Well we were severely disappointed! First I will start on a positive note. The meatball and cauliflower appetizers lived up to the hype but it went downhill from there. We ordered three pasta dishes to share. The duck one, Octopus and the anchovy pasta. All three were the saltiest  pastas I have ever had. Usually when a restaurant over salts something its a sign of cheapness or that the cook as screwed up a the recipe, as salt is used to mask the taste. We couldn't finish the pasta dishes as basically it was a plate of salt. When we told the waitress, in a polite fashion, she just shrugged her shoulders and informed us that is their style of cooking that they do at this restaurant and that we should have informed her to go easy on the salt. She also further explained that very salty pasta is from a certain region in Italy and they base their cooking on it. I had no idea their style was extra salty pasta or what region of Italy does this style, (I goggled it and come up with none lol!), so would not have considered asking for less salt at an Italian place before even ordering and knowing what the food is like. Still can't believe that the waitress expected us to know that they cook very heavy handed on the salt and that onus is on us to know that before even tasting any of their dishes???\\n\\nI still cannot believe people come here to eat their salty pasta. Its some of the worst i have ever had. Cooking my own at home out of a box and using a store bought pasta sauce would have been a great improvement over this.\\n\\nWe ordered the chocolate Budino for dessert and that was really good. My suggestion come here for the appies and dessert and skip the saltiest pasta ever to have been created.

Cooked perfectly and there is absolutely no way I could tell the difference between this plant burger and a real meat burger. Topped on it was a toasted bun, melted pimento cheese, and bacon. (What?

But considering how the night turned out, I probably would've been better off ordering that second burger and returning to my hotel.\\n\\nAs for this location, the bar staff was awesome and very friendly, even with the rush of people they were handling.

Anticipate a wait if you are walking in, but I definitely recommend using the Yelp waitlist feature! I was able to add my party of 2 to the waitlist from home and still arrived to Ganko Ittetsu about 30 minutes early (the estimated wait was 45-55 min). The place is conveniently located in Coolidge Corner, so there are a lot of shops to browse through while waiting.\\n\\nThe host was so friendly and energetic and also will take your order when your party is going to be seated soon. This allows for you to sit down and have your food before you in minutes! \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I both got the Gankara Spicy Miso ramen. The noodles are egg noodles cooked perfectly al dente and the ramen was garnished with two pieces of juicy chashu, some more ground pork, crisp bean sprouts, corn, wakame seaweed, scallions, a soft boiled egg, and a generous amount of sesame seeds! The broth itself was a slightly thick red soup that clung to the noodles, allowing for the perfect bite. Once I had finished all my noodles, I moved to drinking the soup. The sesame seeds and seaweed paired with the broth very well, adding a nutty and savory element. As much as I loved it, my boyfriend agreed it was delicious but found the broth and density if the ramen noodles  to be too heavy for his tastes. If you aren't big on hearty ramen broth, perhaps try a different ramen than the gankara spicy miso!\\n\\nI really do love this place, and the only reason I haven't gone as often as I'd like has always been due to long wait times. Next time I plan on going I will definitely make use of the waitlist feature here  on Yelp."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great pizza and in a beautiful spot near the center of downtown Austin.

I really wanted to love this place, but I can honestly say I barely like it. I visited this location two times: first was a couple months ago and I received such horrible service, and second was today and nothing has changed. My first visit I went in just to check the scenery out and get a vibe of the people and loved that it's black owned. I believe in supporting my community and anything that is indigenous to Atlanta. On my first visit I ordered a Iced Chai Latte and received it in a paper cup that did not compliment the beverage at all. Who drinks an iced beverage out of a paper cup with a lid you sip a hot beverage out of. The drink taste like water and had no resemblance of Chai. I kindly asked if it could be fixed and I was told no. The woman behind the counter was incredibly rude. She was about 5'4 with short cut hair that is brown with blonde highlights; she is probably in her late 40's. The lady acted as if I was bothering her and didn't want to make my Chai in the first place. My Chai tasted like her attitude, watered down and not Pleasant at all, and the look upon her face was as if she was disgusted and didn't want to be there. \\n\\nMy second visit was today and when I arrived there were two other people in the dining room. I placed an order for Shrimp and Grits and a dark roast coffee. It took 40 minutes for the Shrimp and Grits, and 50 to get my coffee. The two young girls were very nice and I appreciated their attempts at providing service, but they failed miserably; they couldn't keep up with the flow of people coming in. And to top it off, the woman that helped me on my first visit was sitting in the dining area, with her computer and paperwork, helping herself to all the food and beverage, but never once got up to help the girls out as they struggled to assist everyone that started to come in. I wonder if she is Rosie??? If so Rosie you are doing a poor job. Now on a positive note, the food is amazing. The flavor profile on the Shrimp and Grits was so darn good, but the poor service overshadows everything. Again, I really wanted to love this place and make it my neighborhood spot, but the service is less than par and the wifi is not good either. I still tipped well to show my appreciation, but two strikes?????? I can't go for three. My recommendation is they look into some sort of service consultant to assist with the service issues. But until then I won't be back. Tighten up Rosie. Oh to be a coffee/cafe and you don't offer real cream or milk for your coffee is quite a shame. The coffee is good, but paired with artificial creamer in packets, ruins the taste of the coffee. Again, Rosie Tighten up."},{"name":"MidiCi","address":"463 Assembly Row","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Vegetarian Alert: (Unlisted) Meat in the sauce.\\n\\nI went into MidiCi as a first time customer on a weekday.

The major flaw with this place is that EVERYONE wants a doughnut from here LOL which means that they have LONG WAIT TIMES!!! I have never seen people so willing to stand in line for doughnuts. With this visual in mind I decided I would wait it out until the line died down. I ended up waiting until 11:50pm to get in line because that was when the line was at least reasonable. Doughnuts here a pretty cheap compared to Blue Star which was what I noticed right away. No one walks away with only 2 doughnuts at this place. Every single person walks out with a box from Vodoo Doughnuts, they leave it to the imagination how many doughnuts they bought. Once at the register I realized that a box was fairly priced and I had to get 4 maybe 5 doughnuts. I ended up getting the Dirty Bastard which was a customer favorite and also decided to get the Mexican Donut. Both donuts were amazing!! They were super moist and soft and extremely filling. It was at that moment in time that I realized why people will wait to get their box of donuts. If you are in the area you have to try a doughnut from this place.

Mortadella Head sells Roman style pizza by the slice and as a whole pizza pie. I got 4 slices to sample, 2 reds and two whites; sounds like I'm drinking wine. If you didn't know, Roman pizza is a street food in Rome and you can find these types of pizza all around Italy. The dough is crispy and sturdy so it can hold a massive amount of toppings, but at the same time it's light airy in texture. These Roman slices are no joke. These slices are absolutely a meal on its own! You will not be hungry after a slice.

It too had tomato sauce and mozzarella. The garlic aioli was really tasty. I need that sauce bottled up. I'd used it as a sandwich spread it was so tasty.\\n\\nAs for the whites, I tried the Gomorra, which had garlic cream sauce, aged mozzarella, saut√©ed chicken, broccoli rabe, and Calabrian chili aioli. This was very flavorful, however l, I felt the rabe tasted a tad bitter. So that made me frown at it a bit. And last but not least, I got to taste the Pesto Chicken. With slices of fresh tomato, chicken cutlet pieces, pesto sauce and mozzarella, this was the least of my liking. I felt there wasn't really anything that stood out. I'm sure it's a favorite of many since chicken pesto is such familiar tastes for people. \\n\\nAs I've said before, these pizza slices holds a ton of toppings, while still having the ability to keep its shape, and manages to be light airy and crispy.

I like the batter a lot and think there's a perfect crust-to-chicken ratio. However, a couple of times the chicken has bordered on overcooked.

Favorite sides include the tomato pie (baked tomato souffle type dish with a crisco pie crust and cheese, good GAWD it's tasty!) and fried green tomatoes. The banana pudding is perfectly serviceable though nothing special, and after having some today, I kind of wish I'd gone for the peanut butter pie. \\n\\nI was most impressed with our server.

The poached egg was overcooked by about 30 seconds to a full minute as one yolk was slightly runny and the other was not runny at all. The lobster was cooked well and tasted fine.

We ladies (sometimes with our husbands) are very used to having dinner out at a variety of Austin restaurants, including fine dining establishments.  Before ordering we always inform the staff that we would like to receive separate checks.  Some of our friends prefer not to drink alcohol and some prefer to order a bottle of wine--a vast difference in the price of one's meal--so we choose to not split the bill and request separate checks.  The policy of this establishment is: \\" We do not offer separate checks; we take 4 split payments per each group but unfortunately our system does not split checks.\\"  Well, there were 5 of us, so there we were scrambling with calculators to try to figure out what each of us had ordered, along with the tax and the tip.

The service was excellent however don't try and eat here if you like to make changes to the items on a menu as they don't like to do that. Also if you have any shellfish allergies which I forgot my colleague does you might best be served elsewhere as even items from the land may have it in the sauce and see item above about any modifications being a no no here. The drink choices were great on the menu as was the choices of unique items that all sounded great. One of the most unusual was the roll made of Basil, ie like a veggie sushi roll. I had never seen that before but this was the time to try it. It was OK, which exceeded my expectations. We also got some of their Pot Stickers as well which were good, as good as any pot stickers. The food excels in the main course. I would have gotten the lobster fried rice, but having seen others it was more than my appetite that evening would accommodate.

The menu is quite extensive, and you really get to try a bit of everything as they give you an option of an appetizer, entree, side, and a beverage.  There is also homemade dessert (of course)!  The amount of food you receive is startling and almost crude because there is just so much of it!!  On quality and taste, most items are quite good, others of course are not as fabulous (we were interested in the \\"Hoppin' John\\", but that turned out to be kind of a dud).\\n\\nI ordered the blackened Catfish, okra, and broccoli souffle, and it was a very satisfying meal.  The fillets of catfish were quite meaty, and flavorful, nicely charred and the fish was tender.  The broccoli souffle and okra were great as well, but nothing extraordinary.  I actually really loved the bread (dinner rolls, including  cinnamon rolls) they served along with the meal.   I don't know what it was, but their bread is so delicious!   I sampled a lot of the other sides from my fellow diners, and also felt a bit underwhelmed with a few of them (the mac-n-cheese for instance, was creamy, but lacked flavor).  In addition, my bf decided to go with a full slab of ribs, and though it was an insanely large piece of meat, again I wasn't too impressed with the flavor and texture (after having Fat Matt's ribs, I fear nothing could or will compare).\\n\\nService was excellent, the manager and one of the waitresses ensured our food came out in a timely manner, and checked in on us several times with that winning southern hospitality Mary Mac's is known for (see pencil:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mary-macs-tea-room-atlanta?select=0jZVyCBm4unZddxurL3jHg#_gBQ7TUBTl4MfMO5i3K0og).\\n\\nOverall, this is a very special place that absolutely deserves patronage, if not so much for the food, but for it's rich history and attentive, kind service.  \\n\\n3.5 stars.\\n\\nP.S. - Don't forget about the \\"Mudbugs\\" (popcorn crawfish), they are tasty & crunchy!"},{"name":"Sushi Me","address":"3655 SW Hall Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3","text":"The worst experience I've had in a restaurant in years. I walked in, seated myself since no one was around even though the sign said to wait to be seated. No one ever came to take my drink or food order so I just eat sushi plates. The food quality was terrible. The rice was dry. The fish was not fresh. The variety was minimal. To top it off once I went to pay (I had to ask them to get me a ticket because no one came by to give me one), their card reader was broken so they were writing down everyone's information by hand and promising to \\"shred it after\\". They definitely should have been telling people before they started eating. They didn't even know what information needed to be written down.

One older lady was going around each and every person asking for money. I also saw many homeless pushing shopping carts around with only their belongings.\\n\\nMy main reason why one bad customer service experience can alter your thoughts of ever returning to the place of business. I had bought a few doughnuts and the cashier overcharged me a doughnut I never bought. When I returned after I left the store, I brought this to the cashier's attention. He was not apologetic at all and even had the gall to just give me the doughnut he had incorrectly rung up without asking to take the price off. I didn't want a $5 doughnut that I had no interest in getting. After having the manager come over and change the price the cashier never closed our box of doughnuts after we showed them we got charged wrong. He just stood there like an idiot waiting for me to close the box! No apologies whatsoever and just a plain ass! I know the lines are endless here, but if you keep treating your customers like that, you won't have many returning.

We were visiting from Los Angeles and sought out unique restaurants with Southern feel, and the promise of Asian Fusion with a Southern touch intrigued us.  A cute eclectic vibe as you enter, however, with no place to wait for a table inside, (we were dodging - as were they - wait staff).  However, they were super friendly about it and we ended up seeking a spot to stand around a corner where we discovered their refrigerated desserts (huge multilayered cakes you need to have explained to you - and worth the explanation and ordering!). Three of us shared a red velvet filled wonder after dinner, and Yumm!!  For dinner, we opted to share 2 appetizers and 3 entrees - Fried Green Tomatoes (the tomatoes were too hard), Lobster Wontons (ok), and a calamari we did not order was swiftly left on our table and the staff member rushed away.  When our waitress arrived we told her we did not order, and she took it away just as swiftly- we joked about who may have received it after it had sat on our table a bit.  The main entrees were Lobster Fried Rice (delicious!), Pan Seared Chilean Seabass (a bit too heavy with the sauce/egg, but good flavors).  The Fried Chicken we ordered never arrived, so we can't say we had our Southern touch.  We were really hungry after waiting, so we jumped right on it when the first two entrees arrived!  Waitress returned after entrees were eaten, and we let her know Fried Chicken never arrived.  She seemed perplexed, and said, \\"oh, ok,\\" as though agreeing with us.

We have tried a lot of different things on the menu over the last couple years, but yesterday our group of four  which was there for my birthday had the lobster mac & cheese, basil rolls, and Korean barbecue deviled eggs for appetizers. We ordered the lamb chops, fried grouper which used to be soft shell crab pri kingh (A delicious curry served inside of a pineapple with vegetables and rice), The crispy beef, and the shrimp and scallop pasta. I don't think I could tell you whose  dinner was the best because they were all fantastic. The service was also excellent. There was a mistake made where someone had asked for the other half of their entr√©e to be boxed up, and unfortunately the kitchen staff didn't realize and tossed it. The waiter came out, apologized, asked what we would want comped including just a whole new order of that to go, and it was no fuss or anything. That's the exact way that service should be. So all in all this is top-notch food with top-notch service.

McMenamin's Kennedy School is a massive elementary school turned bar (cluster of bars, really). I'm not sure how long the school has been closed but the building is very well maintained, albeit a little on the creeptastic side (as in, creepy and yet fantastic). They saved quite a bit of the original set-ups: there are shower stalls in the bathroom, a small movie theater (yes, it's in operation! You can see a movie here for cheap!), and long hallways filled with murals, paintings and trophy cases. It still looks very much like a school. If it wasn't for the tables outside the main entrance, I would've thought this was a legit, operating elementary school. \\n\\nWe stopped by for a quick drink on a sunny Saturday evening. After a brief walk around the property, we ended up going to the Cypress Lounge, which has a nice outdoor seating area and a cozy interior with a ceiling full of bright, colorful lamps. We also checked out the adjacent Boiler Room bar, which has a pool table and a shuffleboard, and a completely different ambiance than the smaller Cypress Lounge. The coolest thing they did was probably turn the old detention room into a speakeasy-style whiskey and cigar lounge. We also peeked at the pool (no one was there). I wish we had more time to explore more of the Kennedy School. We didn't order food (I don't think people come here for the food) and service was okay. \\n\\nYes, yes, yes, absolutely come to Kennedy School if you're in Portland! No, you won't find a clubby scene, but you'll find awesome places to chill with good friends."},{"name":"Woodys Wing House","address":"161 E Campus View Blvd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"I really wanted to like Woodys so I stayed away until some of the new restaurant kinks had been worked out. Today I really wanted wings for lunch and though I typically go to a different spot I bought I would give Woodys a try since it is directly on my way home. Called and placed a pickup order and was told 15 minutes which was perfect because I was exactly 15 min away. Went through the drive thru where you can purchase drinks (+1) Just for the drive thru. The wings were hot as in freshly cooked and the waffle fries were hot as well. I did not order nonbreaded wings but it was hard for me to tell if they were or not. I enjoyed the flavor of the chipotle BBQ but the spicy garlic sauce seemed greasy. The wings were good size, really meaty flats and drums. My biggest issue is that the wings were undercooked. They needed a few more minutes cooking. That ruined the whole meal for sure, I didn't even finish them. Also of note the ranch and celery were not included. Super disappointed.

We arrived and ordered drinks pretty quickly however it took the drinks forever to get to the table despite it being dead in the restaurant. When we received the drinks we decided we better order because we had no idea how long the food would take if drinks took 10 minutes. We ordered more drinks while waiting for our food and got them quicker this time and shortly after the food came.... except me and my boyfriend (we both ordered the Prime Rib). The waitress swings by looks at everyone else and how they had food look at me and my boyfriend and goes \\"OPPSS! I totally forgot to tell you we are out of the Prime Rib!!\\". I was shocked that after being at the restaurant for 30 minutes or so waiting on our food that she would not have remembered to talk to us or ask for us to reorder. Starving my boyfriend and I scramble to find a new order and ask for an appetizer as well (she promised the app would be right out). 10 minutes passed, we still hadn't seen the waitress again, and our food comes out with the appetizer. We decided to turn away the appetizer because the whole point was for us to have something to eat while everyone else was eating and at this point the rest of our party is pretty much done eating as we had just gotten our food. Just like my last review we also had issues with our waitress constantly running off from our table and us trying to shout orders out quickly or as she left us in her dust. We never got an apology from her about anything, we were not offered anything complimentary due to the error, and instead we again left this Ale House wishing we had not wasted the time or money."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"this place is a real tourist attraction and they have delicious doughnuts.

This restaurant is different, as the food represents a distinct style of cooking from a specific area. And it's really, really good. The seasonings and vegetables used here are delicious and fresh. I especially appreciate the use of fresh curry (Kari Patta) leaves, and the level of heat, which was noticeably warming but not overpowering. I imagine that some of the vegetables used had been previously frozen, but that's only because they use some veggies that are indigenous to the region represented here. I tried the channa masala, a rich and flavorful stew, the green beans with shredded coconut, mustard seed and turmeric, a potato dish that packed a lot of heat and a stewed chicken dish that I would return for alone. The gulab jamun was not swimming in the usual syrup that I'm accustomed to, but had been soaked in enough to syrup that it really didn't matter. Delicious. \\n\\nThe staff was helpful and friendly.

Since I'm Into fitness, this interested me. He made me a special Taco with generous slices of avocado, grilled pork, jalapeno, onions, cilantro, but without a tortilla. Instead, he made a special tortilla out of fried Mexican cheese. This was the dish I'll remember most. The combination of flavors and the hit of heat from the slices of jalapeno make you salivate the next bite and reach for your drink at the same time. \\nWe got to talking, and he told me that on Saturdays and Sundays, they offer Mexican breakfast dishes like huevos rancheros and more.

Fried Chicken ($12.50) 3.25 stars\\nApple Cobbler ($3.95) 3 stars\\nBurger ($9.45) 3 stars\\nChicken Tenders ($4.95) 3 stars\\nLiquid: Sweet Tea ($2.39), Cream Soda ($2.75x2)\\n\\nTotal: $49.35 w/tax\\n---------- - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\nTHE FOOD\\n* Macaroni n' Cheese and the Mashed Potatoes were the two items with the most flavor.\\n* Fried Chicken was nicely cooked, but didn't pack a flavor punch that would make me crave it again. It actually reminded me of the chicken served in the cafeteria @ Gwinnett Medical... which has pretty awesome food to be a hospital.\\n* Sweet Tea was a tad too sweet for me, but allowing the ice to melt down and a few stirs of the straw seemed to remedy that. \\n* Fried Green Tomatoes were golden and crunchy, but I must say the dipping sauce was a little strong. So I chose to eat them naked.\\n* Complimentary Pot Likker soup was tasty, but would probably not order it again.\\n* Other items ordered included, apple cobbler, chicken strips, burger and squash souffle.\\n* Friends thought their meatloaf & chicken dumplin's were very good and just ok, respectively.\\n     \\n\\nTHE VERDICT\\nI was neither blown away nor unhappy with any of the food that I sampled today. The history on these walls and southern charm makes it a solid choice. Looking forward to a return visit to try the much talked about Oysters and Shrimp!\\n\\n\\nNOTABLE MOMENT\\nOne employee noticed how enamored I was with the photo's of celebrities and decided to give me a tour of the non-celebrity photos. She showed me pics of the employees, some of which were part of two generations of family whom have worked for Mary Mac's Tea Room as well as several employees with almost FOUR decades of service (39 years to be exact).

The bacon was thick cut, and the maple flavor in the frosting really came through. It seemed like a good representation of the type of doughnuts they had there, and I think I made the right choice. Unfortunately, this was the only doughnut I was able to try because we were both full to bursting from food from the day. \\n\\nEveryone told me that Blue Star was the place to go for great doughnuts, and I'm inclined to agree with them. However, Voodoo's doughnuts are, on average, at a lower price point, and a better value if you don't want to spend $3+ on one doughnut. Yet, the other, more outrageous creations are about as expensive, including the cock and balls, and the actual voodoo doll shaped doughnut. The staff is really friendly and outgoing, and we felt right at home.\\n\\nThe creativity is there, and I truly think it's become sort of a representation of Portland in the long run. It's definitely on the odd side, and the staff really has fun with it.

The second time, we were seated inside at the elevated table, and I felt just as at peace.\\n\\nThe staff is consistently patient and willing to answer questions, despite how busy it can get. Because they get busier, I've had to flag them down for refills occasionally, but I don't mind because they always accommodate. \\n\\nThe food that I've gotten - the smoked salmon tartine and hummus tartine - has always been fresh, very filling, and beautifully presented. Both types of tartines were flavored so well. The combination of the dill cream cheese, olive oil, and salmon on top of bread was amazing, and after eating all of it for brunch, I was stuffed. I got the hummus tartine for $6 during happy hour, thinking I'd opt for something lighter. However, each piece of bread was stacked with hummus and a large chunk of avocado, so I felt pleasantly full (and for such a good price too!). I love how they have the sprouts on the sides, as the bitterness of the sprouts really added to the creamy, softer flavors of the rest of the tartines.\\n\\nMy friends got the Coq Au Vin, and for $10.50, they got very hefty portions and enjoyed all of it.\\n\\nMy only regret coming here the second time is that I fell in love with this place even more, but I'm leaving Austin soon.

It's literally a maze to navigate and it's much tighter than you think. It's crowded so you need to get there early if you plan on coming with a large party.

I didn't have high expectations considering how busy it was and on a game day but our girl was extremely nonchalant about everything. First, I asked could one of the small tvs be changed to a specific game twice... she said ok but provided no follow up. A response would have at least signified some effort. Second, we had a party of 8 and combined 2 tables and in doing so we ended up with a separate server for each table. Table 1 ordered first (at least 15 minutes before table 2) but table 2 got their food first and both tables pretty much ordered wings or wings & fried shrimp. Table 2's server came and replenished drinks and was able to order 2nd /3rd rounds of drinks while table 1 sitting there playing where's waldo for our server. She missed out on some drink sales. Our checks were also incorrect on table 1 but because our service was so slow we worked it out ourselves (thx cashapp). Due to our service experience, a 12% tip was left instead of 20% and this was the quickest followup service we received from our server all night. She swooped in so quick and read the receipts and then confronted the payers with mad attitude. Each explained with poise why they left the amount they did and it was based on service. Unfortunately, table 2's server was great and we could see her serving other tables but also making her rounds to each one as well so what's the other girls excuse? idk... 2 stars for this whole ordeal"},{"name":"Backlot Express","address":"351 S Studio Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Although we usually just play our quick service meals by ear, this time we made it a priority to eat here.

The chocolate-chip pancakes were probably the best part, the eggs over medium were cooked all right but not great, and the homefries were burned. Everything was on the colder side. \\n\\nWhat I found to be very annoying is that they can't open the bar until 11am (Town law). Since we were seated at 10:15, we couldn't order alcohol before or with our meals so we had to wait.

If you've never had pea pod stems I would highly recommend trying it! It's my favorite vegetable and incredibly nutritious. The shrimp with walnuts and salad dressing is typically called shrimp with mayo in other restaurants but if you say that here you'll end up with something else.

At 5:30 on a Friday the place was not busy whatsoever. The bartender took my drink order (lychee tini), and immediately resumed his previous activity, which was stirring some kind of a mixture in a jar, right in front of me. I figured it was one of the ingredients for my drink. 2 min went by and he is still stirring it and I'm getting impatient. \\n~\\"What is this thing that you are mixing\\" I ask.\\n~\\"Oh, it's this special blah-blah drink we make with tequila (which has nothing to do with my drink order).\\nWTF??

I'm a sucker for octopus so as soon as I saw it on the menu, I had to try it. The dish arrived with 4 measly tiny chewy horrendous octopus pieces on top of a whole bunch of tempura fried vegetables.

The manager had to come out to our table and pretty much impart on the fact that it isn't you who should ever be pleased here if you ever decide to dine at Poor Calvins but it is all about what the chef wants to do and the presentation, unless you are allergic. I hate potatoes. This is allergy enough.

The vibe is great, they fit a party of 10 on one table easily. We did call in beforehand to make sure they could do this. \\n\\nThe food is drool worthy you guys. I love ramen, and I was not disappointed. The spicy miso ramen was delicious - the broth had depth of flavor and had the perfect amount of heat to keep you coming back for more. Some people think that it's too salty but I loved it as it was. I tried my friend's shioramen and again the broth was fantastic. There is also a vegetarian ramen, which is wonderfully nutty in flavor; my friend who got it loved it. The broths are what make a good ramen, and they were all on point!!! Not to mention, the noodles had a perfect texture, the right amount of softness while still holding its bite to give you the perfect amount of chewiness.\\n\\nWhat you HAVE TO GET is the salmon bowl with the roe! You can get it as a combo with the soft-boiled egg and one of the ramen bowls! The salmon bowl was perfect in every way; the rice underneath was seasoned itself, and the roe provided those pops of accentuated saltiness to make your mouth water even more. The soft boiled egg is always a great addition, though I will say it's a little more on the hard-boiled spectrum (wish that yolk had been a bit runnier). All in all, this place gave me the ramen fix I've been craving since I've visited Japan! I am so pleased to have visited Santouka Ramen and plan on coming back soon.

I'll start off with the good parts of my visit. I was here as part of a group of 6. Our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and provided recommendations. The appetizers and drinks came out in a reasonable amount of time. We were pleasantly surprised at the portion size-- between the seemingly never ending bowl of calamari, Argentinan bread, and wine, I was pretty satisfied. The NY strip entree was also tasty. On to the terrible. The valet was completely understaffed for a Friday night, which made dropping my car off and picking it up an issue. They dont have a self-parking option, so valet is your only choice here. It was entirely too hot inside the restaurant-- it had to be at least 85 degrees on a hot Georgia summer night with no fans. I asked our server about it and he said that the a/c was as low as it could go. We were all sweating and fanning ourselves with the drink menu as we waited for our food. The entrees took a while to come out. I initially excused the delay because I'm sure everything is cooked to order, but I was completely turned off when 2 of the people at my table did not receive their food (brisket) until AFTER the other 4 of us had finished eating our meals. We received an apology for the delay but that was it. We spent a total of 3 hot and sweaty hours here due to the delays on the entrees. Again, it took a while for the valet to bring our cars around. When I finally got my car, the road was blocked by a semi truck! This road was the only way in or out for the restaurant and the brewery next door. A good samaritan ended up helping the semi truck back up without hitting any parked cars. Then she directed me and the cars behind me around the semi and the parked cars so that no one would get hit!

My wish that Atlanta finally has a legit ramen has come true!  Jinya doesn't top my favorite spot in LA, Tsujita, but it is by far the best ramen in Atlanta!\\n\\nJinya is tucked away in Roswell in the shopping plaza across from Whole Foods, next to the Gillard & Sons.  Close parking is a bit limited with everything reserved for Gillard... but plenty of parking in the shopping plaza overall.  \\n\\nInside, there's about 5 tables that can seat 4 people and about 10 -12 bar seats.  Outside there's about 5 more 4 seater and couple 2 seater. Oveall, small capacity so it's likely that you would have to wait, which is common for any true ramen spots. \\n\\nToday, we went in for lunch and there was a 30 minute wait for inside seating that we embraced the scattered rain and scorching temperature and sat outside.  Wasn't so bad overall, but definitely will try to grab indoors next time.  \\n\\nMy colleague and I both ordered the Cha Cha Cha and shared the crispy chicken combo.  With this combo, 3 pieces of chicken came out, piping hot and perfectly seasoned and crisp with a side of ginger salad.  Not sure how much the appetizer portion is compared to this but may check into that to get the best deal for the $.\\n\\nCha cha cha definitely leaves you with garlic breath at the end, but not so much raw garlic flavor unless you pressed fresh garlic that they offer to the bowl.  Other ramen places need to take reference to Jinya and how their broth had so much depth and flavoring.  It was thick, savory, and had lots of soul that one can tell that it was prepared with lots of love and care.  Broth wasn't so spicy but you can easily make it to your liking by adding their sauce, which was heaven and potent.  I think I added a bit too much as my tummy was not so happy with me afterwards but it's pure red pepper grinded with citrus juice.  It's kickin' and refreshing!  \\n\\nJinya ramen is totally worth the visit for the quality and amount.  You can add additional toppins to any ramen, but I feel that the order itself had plenty with lots of veggies, meat, egg, and noodles.  They definitely do not skimp out on anything.  Egg was perfectly cooked with oozing yolk and noodles had the best texture.  From the looks of it, noodles looked undercooked, but it was very deceiving when you bit into it and it was perfectly cooked.  It's a bit thicker than what I typically like, reminds you of yakisoba noodles, but it all paired well together.\\n\\nAlready have plans to come by with my friends to try other ramen, and can't wait!

I opted for the buffet because it's what he was doing and it just made things easy.\\n\\nIn theory, a mix of Mediterranean dishes--and pizza--would be right up my alley. But as I moved down the mostly Mediterranean part of the buffet, very little looked appetizing. In fact, none of it did. Shoved in a dark corner of the room, a lack of light didn't do any of these dishes any favors. And based on what my client said, they tasted about as good as they looked.\\n\\nHaving skipped that half of the buffet, I ended up grabbing a couple of slices of pizza, a spinach pie and some kafta (meatballs). Well, the pizza was flaccid and no better than frozen, the spanakopita was just a dinner roll stuffed with feta and the meatballs were overcooked (but they did have some decent flavor).\\n\\nWhat puzzled me most about this place is that I've eaten at two other Ray's over the years and the quality of the food has been pretty good. The pizza and calzones were about on par with Fellini's. So I'm not sure why the pie here was so blah.

Yeah, that's right. ALL OF PORTLAND. The locals know what's up, there are lines out the door for dinner all the time! \\n\\nThe 3.5 average on Yelp BLOWS MY MIND. It is unbelievable how incredibly ridiculous and petty people are. All of the negative reviews boil down to the criticism that the Xiao Long Bao are not *absolutely f-ing perfect*, or not *exactly* like Din Tai Fung, or not *exactly, perfectly* like what you get in China. This is Portland fools! It's not China! It's not DTF! It's still insanely delicious! Then these ridiculous people will give what is objectively a 4-5 star dish like 2 stars as some kind of petty punishment for not being *absolutely perfect*. You know what? They are NOT absolutely perfect, sometimes it's 4-star, sometimes it's 4.5, sometimes it's 5.0 amazingness...that's kind of the deal you accept when a dish is hand made from scratch...you get actual variation!

Does Voodoo Doll Have Something In His Pocket Or Is He Just Happy To See Me?\\n\\nIf you have never been to Voodoo Doughnut, give 'em a try. The original location is here in downtown Portland (Old Town), but they have shops in Eugene (OR), Denver (CO), Universal Studios Hollywood (CA) and Orlando (FL), as well as Austin (TX).\\n\\nThese photos are from our trip to the original shop in Old Town yesterday. As you can see, their look is quite eclectic, colorful, and retro, the menu a bit pornographic, and THE DONUTS ARE GREAT! \\n\\nMost doughnuts run between 75¬¢ (plain cake) to $3.25 with a couple in the $5 to $7.50 range. Dozens range from $14 to $18 unless you want to pick your own. They even have vegan doughnuts (hear that Jeni?), although I do not know how many varieties they have.\\n\\nTheir menu is a tad on the perverted side, with a Cock-n-Balls going for $6.50, a Triple Chocolate Penetration is $2, a Butterfingering is $2, an Old Dirty Bastard is $3, a Portland Cream (the Official Doughnut of Portland) is $2.25, and /or, finally, the Custom Cock going for $7.50, not a bad deal considering the fact that creating a doughnut that looks like a rooster is probably a very intricate and time consuming process. C'est la vie, after all, their slogan is: \\"The Magic Is In The Hole\\"!\\n\\nWe got a Bacon and Maple ($3.25), an Apple Fritter ($3), and a Voodoo Doll ($3.50). The bacon and maple was glazed and covered with maple icing with crisscrossed slices of fried bacon on top and it was OK, but the taste was a bit weird and not really my thing. The apple fritter was big and tasty, but it could have been much crispier in my opinion. And, last-but-not-last, the voodoo doll (see above) was also glazed, iced with chocolate, colorfully decorated to look like a perverted gingerbread man complete with a sugary confection erection (see photos). As Harry Carey would have said, \\"Holy cow!\\".\\n\\nThe only negatives are that you should have your E ticket ready (\\"E\\" does not stand for \\"electronic\\" - SoCal natives will know what I am talking about) because there always seems to be a line outside, sometimes with several dozen people queueing up to get in. They even have a serpentine setup for their line just like the ones at the Magic Kingdom. Finally, the cashiers are never particularly friendly, not quite rude, but seemingly indifferent to customers. I presume that after their 700th customer of the day, they could get a bit cranky, but there is NEVER an excuse for NOT treating customers with the utmost courtesy, friendliness, dignity and respect. They get a two BOMB deduction for the grouchy employees, otherwise, Voodoo Doughnuts would have gotten my PERFECT SCORE and a spot on CombatCritic's \\"WALL OF FAME\\".\\n\\nSo, march on down to a Voodoo Doughnut near you for an overload on your sensations' of sight, smell, and taste. The massive wall painting just across the street wraps this place up in a nutshell: \\"Keep Portland Weird\\". If you happen to go to the original location, tell 'em CombatCritic sent you ...

Let me tell you, this restaurant did not disappoint from our first course to the last. Upon sitting down we were served warm yeast rolls flecked with sea salt sitting atop a pool of luscious melted butter. They reminded me of Filipino pan de sal, only 10 times better!! This really set the tone for the rest of our meal. For starters we ordered several rounds of fresh oysters of different varieties. They were plump, clean tasting and fresh, served with mignonette and cocktail sauces. We also tried the roasted version with breadcrumbs and butter but they were smaller so instead of the 3 we ordered were given 4. \\n\\nWe then had calamari which were very fresh and light and crunchy, served with a green aioli. My son proclaimed it the best calamari he's had. We then moved on to a Spicy Kale Salad with chorizo, confit shallot and Parmesan. The salad was made with tender baby kale and had just the right amount of dressing speckled with salty hits of chorizo and spicy Calabrian chili. Next was She Crab Soup. My oh my! So rich and delectable with sherry, it was immediately soaked up with the shrimp toast on the side. My daughter rolled her eyes as she savored it's intense flavor and richness. One of my favorites of the evening! After watching the chef make Shrimp a la Plancha on The Chef  Show, how could we not try it? The shrimps were large and juicy and drenched in Arbol chili butter-sitting on top of crisp thick toast which was used for sopping up all the delicious goodness. Not a drop remained despite this dish coming to us warm rather than hot. Nevertheless its flavor made up for the lack of temperature. \\n\\nSince my son is not much of a seafood connoisseur we ordered for him the Half Roasted chicken. I was thinking $30 for half a chicken. Really? But after seeing him cut into the perfectly crisp skin and moist tender, and perfectly seasoned meat, his eyes wide with WOW, I could see why. Worth every penny! To end our meal we shared a blueberry pudding cake with hot buttered rum. It was everything its namesake made it out to be- warm, with moist crumbs and a scrumptious drizzle of creme anglaise and blueberry compote. My oh my. It was a most fitting finale to our meal.

Also the greens that they use are like mixed greens (not romaine lettuce), so the meal tastes a lot classier overall.

I don't mind waiting for food and I usually see it as a sign I'm in for a treat. We walked around the neighbor hood for a while then found some seats that were conveniently placed for waiting out front. It was really nice being able to sit on the restaurants \\"lawn\\" and drink Topo Chico while we waited to get in. It honestly felt like hanging out in my back yard.\\n\\nWhen we got in we were seated and ordered drinks.. large cheap mimosas are always a plus! I also tried the Bearded Lady specialty drink. It was Saki + Topo and some sort of peach flavor. It sort of tasted like a Bellini made from Saki. I absolutely loved it.\\n\\nFor my meal I had the Soul Food Plate, it came with Beans, Collard Greens and Corn Bread.. I added rice for 1 dollar. The food was amazing the collards were cooked perfectly and the Blueberry Corn Bread tasted like ambrosia that got handed down from Mt. Olumpus by the gods!

With its masterful combination of sweet and salty, crunch and porous yeasted dough, that doughnut is too sexy for TV.  I had high hopes for the notorious doughnut, and I'm no stranger to bacon with sugar, but this thing blew my mind.  The doughnut itself was fluffy with a good amount of pull, and the thick strips of bacon on top were perfectly crispy.  The maple frosting was dreamy, and with the salty porky top, the doughnut was downright indecent.  It was, I believe, the best doughnut I've ever had and one of the best things I've eaten, period.\\n\\nIt was worth waiting in one of the slowest lines I've encountered of late.  We showed up at 11 AM on a Friday and there were a couple dozen people waiting outside of the shop.  It took a good half hour to get to the front of the line, and when we did, we saw why.  The shop is tiny.  There was one person working the register and getting the doughnuts, a friendly and, I might add, very cute girl.  The place has a lot of character packed into its small space - there's voodoo kitsch and Voodoo Doughnuts merchandise as well as a chalkboard menu on the walls.  Doughnuts rotate in a display case by the register, and there are hundreds and hundreds more in the space behind it.\\n\\nThough there were several whacky doughnuts to choose from, we ended up getting pretty standard doughnuts other than the bacon maple bar.  Matt B. is a picky eater and went with a sugar cake doughnut and a cinnamon yeast doughnut.  I asked the cashier to pick my second doughnut and she recommended a simple blueberry cake doughnut.  All three of these doughnuts were great, though not nearly as memorable as the bacon maple.  The cake doughnuts had a nice dense, moist crumb and the blueberry had blueberries baked into the cake as well as cooked into the glaze.  Voodoo can do solid basics in addition to its more out there creations.\\n\\nI can't imagine that anything else in Voodoo Doughnut is as good as the bacon maple bar.  It is the proverbial Chuck Norris of doughnuts.  Voodoo was one of our last stops before meeting Michael K. in Seattle, and with great willpower, I saved him a few bites.  Hours later, when most doughnuts are well past their prime, Mike had the same slack-in-the-face dropped jaw reaction I did.  I am sad that I can't have this doughnut whenever I want, and any time I find myself Portland, Voodoo Doughnut will be a top priority."},{"name":"Pizzeria New York","address":"7950 E Broad St","city":"Reynoldsburg","stars":"4","text":"Best spot to get New York pizza in Columbus, OH!

Now, however, it has been added to the places I must return!  Being an early weekday lunch,  we were seated by a window. It's on the 52nd floor in downtown Boston and occupies the entire floor, so good seats are not hard to come by. But it fills up fast. The service was above par and we felt very special, indeed. We each ordered a glass of the house Chardonnay, which was very, very good. For lunch, we both decided on the Chipotle Chicken Cobb Salad. The salads were beautifully presented and absolutely delicious! The ingredients were fresh and generous, the dressing perfectly applied. We were provided with a lovely plate of bread, with a nice cranberry walnut as well as sliced Italian... and real butter. We were quite happy and satisfied with our lunches and our wine.

If you want a comfort meal, this is the place."},{"name":"King + Duke","address":"3060 Peachtree Rd NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Very nice atmosphere at King + Duke. Parking can get a little confusing though. There is valet available and also a parking deck. It's not immediately apparent if either are validated. Some of my friends parked in the expensive parking deck. When I saw the prices per hour, I immediately asked a valet attendant if it was validated. He told me that the parking deck is not, but valet service is. So I pulled my car back around and valeted.\\n\\nThe menu can also get a little confusing. It's not clear what is an appetizer and what is a main entree. In fact I'm still a little hazy as to which is which. Labels in the menu would be helpful. Our waitress was very nice and gave us a few suggestions. We ordered the Grilled Artichoke, Brussels Sprout Salad, Smoked Chicken Wings, and Maple Glazed Lamb Ribs.\\n\\nIt was my first time trying a whole grilled artichoke, and I have to be honest, I wasn't 100% certain how to eat it. The brussels sprout salad was not exactly what I was expecting. I thought it would be whole brussels sprouts, but instead, it came out looking like cole slaw. The lamb ribs were ok, as were the chicken wings. But for the price I would have wished for more.\\n\\nAnd finallly, for our main entree, we went bold and shared The King for $109. It is a 40oz tomahawk ribeye that serves 2-4. It was also served with bone marrow which was interesting. But again, I guess I'm not sophisticated enough, but I wasn't completely sure how to eat it. I guess you scrape the marrow out of the bone and eat it with the bread? The tomahawk was good, but super fatty. I estimate that 30% of the weight was lost to the bone and fat.\\n\\nWe also ran into an incident with the waitress. She was cleaning off another table and must've lost her footing and spilled some food on us. To her credit, she was very apologetic and it was just an accident. But it made me realize that the tables were pushed a bit too closely together, which limited her space to move about.\\n\\nOverall, the food was good and the waitress was very nice to us. We also had some bottles of wine and cocktails which were good. But for the price, I expected more. Added to the confusion with the parking situation and the menu, plus the incident during our visit, a restaurant that could easily be 4 or 5 stars is rated 3 stars based upon my recent visit."},{"name":"Ginger Root of Woburn","address":"486 Main St","city":"Woburn","stars":"3","text":"Good Chinese food!

Shuckers are knowledgeable of their oysters and are fast at what they do. \\n\\nJust be warned that they can be so busy at times that there will be a wait for the bar, and while their is a \\"to go\\" option it will sometimes be unavailable as the priority is to have enough to maintain the bar. They get shipments of oysters practically every or every other day if I do recall though. \\n\\nAnother thing to note is on their anniversary they have specials for reduced rates on buckets! So if you really like your oysters but have to maintain a budget and know you'll eat buckets to no end, wait for their upcoming 65th anniversary and splurge!

What can I say? It absolutely lives up to all the hype my friends have supplied, and turned out to be the perfect choice for celebrating one of our 40th birthdays! The restaurant somehow feels larger on the inside than it looks on the outside, yet it's divided into several dining rooms so that you always feel as though you're having an intimate eating experience.\\n\\nOur servers took excellent care of us and made several recommendations, much of which we took (to our delight, everything was excellent!) One of the benefits of dining in a group is the opportunity to try a little of this and a little of that, so I walked away with a good idea of the menu as a whole. \\n\\nPersonal highlights were the King, of course - a massive 40 oz steak that's served with bone marrow and other trimmings. I also adored the bread course, which isn't so much \\"bread\\" as a Yorkshire pudding popover. It was one of the most delectable things I've ever eaten, honestly, and is enough to bring me back to K+D in the future. \\n\\nMy Duke, a large burger, was yummy but underdone (I ordered medium, and several people asked me if I thought it was actually cooked. It was, but wayyyyy pinker than I like my burgers.) The fries are made with beef tallow and are especially delicious, as are the roasted carrots that my friend got with her meal. As far as dessert goes, the sticky toffee pudding was excellent and the perfect sweet way to end such a meat-heavy meal."},{"name":"The Friendly Toast - Burlington","address":"75 Middlesex Tpke, Ste 1015B","city":"Burlington","stars":"4","text":"Food is good but greezy overall for a quick stop at the mall I'd go again...cool ways to make comfort food better."},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I have to start this review by commending our server Lola. She was nothing less than amazing and I highly attribute our 5 star review to her. That being said, Poor Calvin's - one of the most rated places in the city of Atlanta, and yet I had never been! I actually tried to eat here once before, but it was a weekend and there was no parking nearby. The restaurant itself isn't located in the most comfortable part of town, so be sure to use the valet if you can - they work off tips and actually have a state of the art text messaging system to have your car ready by the time you leave. The restaurant interior is very cozy, with the entrance opening up into the bar area where a couple tables are situated off to the side. After you wind past the kitchen you end up in the main dining area. I really suggest making a reservation as seating is limited and it fills up even on weeknights. The menu is streamlined with a lot of interesting fusion options. We ordered the basil rolls, stir fried vegetables, and fried chicken. The sauce on the basil rolls was the real MVP of the appetizer. As for the mains, the fried chicken takes the cake. The meat was tender and the exterior had the right amount of crunch. What really set the dish apart was the lobster mac n cheese on which the chicken was delicately laid atop. It was a dream come true to eat this dish. There were also collard greens on the plate which were OK, but I am not a fan of collards so try them for yourself before making a decision. One thing unique to this dish was the flavor popping things for lack of better descriptor. They were almost like the flavor bubbles you can add at fro-yo places. Whatever they were they tasted phenomenal with the mac n cheese. Overall, I highly recommend this place as the staff is friendly, the portions are hearty, the prices are fair, and the experience is totally worth it."},{"name":"Leaf Vegetarian Restaurant","address":"1710 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"This is the best meal I've had all week.

I could see having a nice private event there. \\nOur waiter seemed nice,  but lethargic. He checked on us a couple times and didn't say much. You write your order on a piece of paper and the waiter checks back to collect the papers. That was different, but I bet it cuts down on mistakes. The free bread basket was good,  especially the cinnamon rolls. There were also cornbread muffins and plain rolls. I had the salmon croquettes with sweet potato souffle and cabbage. The croquettes were tasty, but I like my own better. Theirs had no onion or fresh minced garlic.  Now, the sweet potato souffle was the best ever! The cabbage was seasoned well and made in a vegetable broth. It was just a little to soft for me.  My husband had the fried catfish, collard greens, and macaroni and cheese.

This place is overpriced and over hyped.  I'm surprised this place has such high reviews.  If Katana were located in San Francisco, California, this place would be out of business already.  The GF and I walked in without reservations.  We wanted the full experience where the chef cooks in front of you and performs a show on the large grill.  We waited twenty minutes in order for a table to fill up.  When they realized no one else was coming, they were forced to seat us, leaving two empty seats.  Oh no!  \\n\\nI wanted to order the scallops.  But when I requested this as me entree, they said they were out.  I wish our server informed everyone of this when we were seated.

The protein is already expensive enough, yet Katana still feels the need to nickel and dime its customers.  \\n\\nOur chef was very nice, and at the same time entertaining.  He made the fried rice first.  The portion size for the fried rice was quite generous.  However, there was too much soy sauce.  It was very salty.  The next thing he cooked were the vegetables.  The whole table got the vegetable combo for $8 each, which includes a mixture of bok choy, mushrooms, and asparagus.  \\n\\nAfter the veggies were served, the protein was up next.  The GF got the lobster, while everyone else got salmon and chicken.  The lobster was prepared first.  She said it tasted rubbery, was drenched in too much sauce, and was overcooked.  She was extremely disappointed with her $40 entree.  Next up was the salmon, and lastly my teriyaki chicken.  The chicken was not only underwhelming, but frankly, inedible.  The biggest problem with the chicken was how it was prepared and cooked.  It was cooked directly on top of where the salmon was cooked.  The same sauce that the salmon was cooked on, was used to coat and marinate the chicken.  \\n\\nI am conflicted.  It is hard to say which was worse, how dry the chicken was, or the fact that the chicken tasted fishy.  I think the chicken tasting fishy wins though.  I am still in awe as to why he would cook the chicken on top of the same sauce used all over the salmon.  I wish he could have tasted how awful it was.  I forced myself to eat half of the chicken.

Since Sharetea opened next door, I decided to give Jinya another chance. \\n\\nI asked for a table for 4, which would have required a wait. There were 4 open seats at the bar, so we were seated immediately there. Not everyone in the party had to be there to be seated. Our server was efficient and got our orders quickly. Our ramen also came out quickly, so that we were in and out within 45 minutes.\\n\\nI went with the seasonal special, which I believe was called the Tokyo Tonkotsu Ramen, but don't quote me on it. It wasn't too bad, the egg was perfectly soft boiled and runny. The broth wasn't overly salty or rich, which is what I prefer. My chashu pork was a little cold, just as I had experienced the first time, but I know I'm just going to have to get over the fact that they refrigerate the meat and place it on my ramen without heating it up beforehand. I decided to also get the pork bun, which I had previously enjoyed at the Buckhead location. They definitely overdid it on the mayo bleh. The pork belly itself was cooked well. I could have done without the mixed greens. \\n\\nOverall, service has definitely improved, as well as wait times (at least, for your food order). The interior is still as small as ever so I would avoid coming here with a large group.

I'm not picky, I think I have the most generous and reasonable palate... but don't give me shitty food. \\n\\nSo a friend and I decided to celebrate our 4th of July here for dinner, turns out to be one of the best dinner choices ever. We started off with a Lychee Martinis and a Dixie. I like my drink a bit sweeter so you could guess right off which one I had. :) 2 plump lychees floating in my martini glass just soaking up all that goodness while I sipped. \\n\\nFor starter we had the mussels, the beef salad and the duck wonton. WOW. I was blown away by all three. Usually anything wrapped and fried in a wonton is usually lost somewhere in the black hole. You wouldn't be able to figure out what the hell you're chewing on, you can only assumed it's some kind of meat. Not with this one, you can taste and chew on the duck meat because there's so much stuffed into this little wrapper... it was super delicious.\\n\\nThe steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly on the beef salad. Accompanied it was some kind of marmalade (forgot), it was more savory than sweet but was so tasty. Now, the mussels... OMG, I didn't plan on stuffing my face with so much carbs, but I couldn't refrain from misbehaving. The buttery fried bread was dense, which was perfect to sopped up the lightly creamy garlicky soup. If I didn't know any better, I could have picked up the bowl and slurped it... but I didn't want to embarrass my friend and I wanted to come back again. Needless to say, the mussels were gone and so was my entire piece of bread. Honestly, I would have been happy if the Chef tosses some linguine into the sauce and call it a day.\\n\\nMoving on... the final dish was some kind of wonderful in my mouth. I wanted to give the Chef a big hug. The Squid Ink Pad Thai... I've never had squid ink pad Thai but I've had squid ink pastas before. It came with 2 skewers of 4 juicy tender baby octopus... The dish itself contains the black squid ink pasta, tender slices of squid garnished with Takuan (yellow pickled daikon) and caviar. I know it's fancy to have caviar but to be honest, there were so much flavor in that dish, the caviar was lost. I didn't think it needed it at all, but I do appreciate it. \\n\\nLastly, we tried the Suspension Cake and I wasn't too impress with it. There's a layer of red velvet cake stuffed with mascarpone cheese and passion fruit tapioca pearls. I didn't care for the red velvet cake but then the texture of the pearls bursting in my mouth - fun - but not indulgent as I thought it would be. It wasn't what I was looking for... \\n\\nThank goodness for valet parking because I would not feel comfortable parking down the street and walking to this place. I'm sure it's better during the day... that being said... I'm willing to make another 45 min. drive to dine here at least a few more times and I can't wait!"},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Food was great!

I desperately wanted to try this restaurant to the point where I came two different times. First time, it was Valentine's...so super packed and I did not have a reservation. I expected the long wait and was given an alternative, however, I didn't want to settle for the bar. The atmosphere is rustic, but still very formal. The floor plan is spacious; different sides of the restaurant = different views. We decided to wait a few, we admired the space, but ultimately left. We knew it'd be forever until we were seated and we were super hungry. Was a bit disappointed, but I understand the restaurant business, us not booking a reservation, and the typical rush of couples on Valentines. No biggie. \\nI came for my birthday the next year. Being that my birthday was on a Wednesday and we came right when they opened for lunch, the floor was empty & I got relevantly nice seating. Service was very poor though. Which was a disappointment being that they JUST opened back up for lunch about 30 minutes earlier. I had no appetizer. But I ordered the trout and it was SO. SO. SO. delicious. My partner had the steak and he seemed to love it; he ate it all. Being that it was my birthday, we told the waiter, of course. After our meal, he brings me a brownie with what seemed to be a still solidly frozen scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was distasteful and I could've done without it and without the unenthusiastic waiter I had. He seemed almost annoyed that he was seated, probably upon his own arrival for work.

She would drop off two checks and then get their payment and bring it back for them to sign or provide the change. I had to ask for my check twice, which is she had a more accurate system, would have avoided the confusion. She kept getting sidetracked by other customers.

I took my first bite and I thought \\"Well, this didn't taste right. Something was off.\\" After few more bites, I realized what it was. The salmon didn't have any flavor of the curry at all. Seemed like they didn't mix in the salmon when they made the curry. The salmon just taste like salmon without any seasoning or spices on it. \\n\\nSame with my DL food, his Pad Se Eew noodles was pale. There were not enough sauce on them. The fried tofu didn't have any flavor at all, we think that they didn't mix the tofu with the rest of the noodles & vegetables as well. \\n\\nOne thing that was spot on was the heat level. Our dishes were hot hot hot.

My son liked his pork chop but stated that the risotto was a bit bland and my husband felt that his burger was bland as well.

Once we were seated our first drinks came quickly and the waitress returned to ask for our food orders quickly but then our experience soured. Our party went for the special of the day, the Prime Rib, which they were out of and then the waitress told us how fatty the Rib Eye was and steared us away fron that too. Two more people showed up for our party just as our soups came. One of the new members of our party asked the server who brought our food for a Pepsi and soup and the lady looked at her and said \\"ask your waitress\\". It seemed rude but we shrugged it off. Our waitress floats over a few minutes later asks for the drink order for one of the new people and the same member of our party that was blown off by the last lady, was blown off again as I waitress stormed off while she asked for her drink. Our two members finally get their orders in once the rest of our food arrived and when they recieve their food one of our party asked for a drink and another asked for sauce. Shortly later the waitress arived with the sauce, put it on the table and then walks away as the person tried to tell her it was the wrong sauce. We flagged her down and she told the guy she was getting annoyed and he should have asked for the right sauce. I was shocked. A while later we had another member show up to pick up one member of our party and grab a drink. At this point one member had been waiting 20 minutes on a beer so the new member ordered a beer and reminded the waitress of the other beer we were still waiting on. At this point it was almost comical how bad this service was! We finally got the beers and at this point she was just getting obviously rude and no longer holding back to the point where she threw a straw on the table and was talking to us as little as possible. We finally got to the point where we needed our checks, she asked how to split our check and one member show their discount ID while the rest of us were pulling out ours but she was already gone again. She returned to the table with our checks and we all had our cards a discount IDs ready and she literally rolled her eyes and said something how we should have said something earlier and now it will make more work for her. One member of our party called over the manager to let him know of our issues after paying and he seemed like he could not care less.

Trouble is attitude, speed, and systems. This is one of those places where the the owner and staff care more about their internal systems than their customers. \\n\\nThe layout is silly: you enter, shuffle around the waiting customers, past the till, to a cramped line-up space. The menu is written on a distant wall, past the customers you've just jostled to line up. So far, every single staff person I've dealt with at the till has been unfriendly at best, downright rude at worst. Always very slow, usually require orders to be repeated more than once, often make mistakes. As in many cafes, orders given together are completed at different times, meaning you're not enjoying coffee at the same time as your companion. Food ordering is confusing, inconsistent labelling, never clear what needs to be prepared further rather than ready to eat (makes it tough to know what to order when in a rush). Generally quite unfriendly staff, amazingly slow barristas.\\n\\nThe other morning, I came in after 11 and asked if they still served toast and jam. The server said no. I asked for a croissant instead, but only ham and cheese were available. I asked for some plain bread, server sullenly said 'sure.'
