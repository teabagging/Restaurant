I don't like the pizza at this JNYSP location. \\n\\nI sat at the bar and ordered a pint of Miller Lite. I opted to add toppings to my $1 slices (mushroom on one and pepperoni on the other). The two slices came out piping hot but were smallish in size (compared to the JNYSP location near my office) and oddly oblong, stretched and distended in shape. \\n\\nThe oddly warped oblong shape of my slices was a little disconcerting. It seemed like they feel like that it is okay to sell you weirdly shaped pizza slices (since you are only paying $1 for them - not cool). One of the slices (or perhaps both) tasted like they were near (or on top of) a burnt piece of plastic or burnt cellophane. \\n\\nThe burnt plastic aftertaste can ruin a meal (much less a pizza slice). I have never had that happen with slices I have gotten from the other JNYSP location near my office..

However, the night was not worth the price of admission.   \\n\\nWe called the restaurant at 6pm on a Saturday with hopes to get a table on the patio.  We were told that reservations have been filled for the patio but we can come and wait for a table that were not part of the reservation list.  We hung out at the outdoor bar and got some drinks. After a 50 min wait, we scored a great table on the upper patio.  It took beyond an average amount of time to get our waitress to greet us and take a drink order, whatever no big deal it's Saturday...things are busy.  We then quickly placed some apps order with her, however before they arrived she came out and asked if we wanted to put in an order for food...hmm, ok, maybe after I get the food I just ordered, a little strange but whatever, right? Our apps came out, lettuce wraps and chicken wings, both were really good and our table had no issue clearing the plates.  We put in our food order next, I placed an order for the Earth Bowl and I was asked if I would like to add meat, so I did, chicken.  The food took beyond a long time to come out, but again, Saturday...the place was packed.  \\n\\nOur dinners arrived and I dig into my healthy option.  I immediately realize the chicken is luke warm at best and the vegetables were cold.  So to explain this dish, there is a cold tahini sauce on the bottom and hot grilled vegetables and tabouli on top, plus the hot chicken.  I was a little confused, so I asked the waitress, is this dish supposed to be cold...she said the sauce should be cold and the rest should be hot including the chicken.  I asked nicely if she could simply reheat the dish...no big deal, it would taste better reheated.  She took it away and my fellow table eaters just about finished their dishes when mine came back.  It was on a different plate and completely remade, however, the vegetable were still cold and oh, my chicken was missing.  I waited patiently for the waitress to come back and told her my dish was still cold and there was no chicken.  I was so annoyed I told her to just wrap it up and I will take it home.  This place is not cheap, the service was not the most attentive, and the drink mixing ratio's were all over the place.  But besides all of that where did my chicken go?  I was happy with just a simple reheat of the plate and food.  If you are going to throw my dinner in the trash and make me a new one...understand what was wrong with it.\\n\\nOur waitress came back and told us she took off the cost of the dinner, great except now I am leaving a restaurant hungry and disappointed.  After all this, we never saw the manager on duty perk up a little and address our table.  When a plate gets returned, it would be the first thing a manager should do is address the table and personally see it through the issue is resolved.  When a dish is removed from a bill, again it seems fitting to have the manager be alerted to just double check with the table why it happen and how to resolve the issue.  By not communicating with the kitchen and the manager on duty this is how restaurants start getting a bad list of reviews on Yelp and other sites.  This place does not seem about turning tables over,  I thought it was about providing a quality experience which includes food, service, and ambiance.  Unfortunately, the service and food were both not priority tonight.  \\n\\nWe all have choices which establishment we will be dining with, sometimes peoples expectations are way too high or have very small issues that turn into low ratings for little reasons.  I left the restaurant without eating my food, annoyed, and just wanting to not be there.  It takes a lot to get a customer especially me to that point.  Did I also mention, this is the first time I have EVER sent a dish back to the kitchen, EVER!  To say the least, I will not be going back to ReelHouse, too bad, I had such high hopes for this place."},{"name":"Trudy's North Star","address":"8820 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I hate giving this place one star because we've always had good service here but, it has to be done.\\n\\nWhen we first sat down at the bar, the bartender (Ryan I believe) approached us with the facial expression of a man wanting to eat our unborn children.

In a robotic tone he asked what we wanted then grumbled something under his breath after I ordered a top-shelf Mexican martini (god forbid!).\\n\\nOur food arrived in a timely manner, and was tasty enough but, the kicker was when we ordered another Mexican martini. He blatantly rolled his eyes then threw two cocktail napkins in our direction. \\n\\nLook, maybe he had a bad day or perhaps he was upset that his scruffy, lumberjack beard was slowly enveloping his entire face but, that's no reason to give horrific service like that.

Drelyse African Restaurant is the ideal place to treat your self to culinary exploration. You'll realize just how much the cuisine of Ghana and Senegal has to offer: spicy stews, crispy meat-filled pastries and an intriguing variety of starches. Some of it will look kinda-sorta familiar--a lot of Southern and Caribbean food draws heavily on the heritage of African slaves taken from West Africa. For instance, Jollof rice is clearly related to jambalaya and dirty rice. However, its flavors are distinct from its New World cousins; richly savory with black pepper, tomato and onion.\\n\\nI don't mean to convey that I am an expert on West African cuisine. In fact, this trip to Drelyse was our first real life experience with it (apart from a horrid peanut stew cooked by a well-meaning housemate during college); my previous knowledge was limited to the written word and the television. The warm welcome and patient enthusiasm of the staff at Drelyse is a large part of the reason why I say that  this restaurant is an ideal place to explore. We really enjoyed talking and learning from our server, the proprietress of the restaurant.\\n\\nWe started out meal by washing our hands; the proprietress poured pitchers of warm water over our hands into specially provided basins. Ghanian food is traditionally eaten with the hands; however, the restaurant happily provides utensils  for those who prefer them. \\n\\nWe dug into our meal: Sambusas (fillo-dough pastry stuffed with meat and onion--actually east African), spicy goat stew with fufu (a giant dumpling made of potato and cassava dough) and jollof rice with chicken. We loved everything, but the Jollof rice with chicken really stood out as our favorite. The chicken was shatteringly crispy on the outside and and succulent on the inside. Perfection. A delicious tomato and pepper relish added a note of freshness. The rice was toothsome in flavor and texture without being overly rich.\\n\\nWe accompanied it all with palm wine, a curious beverage that worked really well with spicy food. It reminded me of an earthier version of the Japanese soft-drink called Calpico. \\n\\nAll in all, we look forward to coming back and trying out other items on the menu such as beef peanut stew, fried tilapia and a rice and beans dish called waakye. I encourage you to do the same."},{"name":"Boma - Flavors of Africa - Temporarily Unavailable","address":"2901 Osceola Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"The other day I was getting my hair done, and my stylist, who knew my birthday had just passed, asked me what I had done.\\n\\n\\"We went to Boma for breakfast,\\" I answered.\\n\\nOrlando locals are pretty blase about Disney World, but mention Boma and nearly all of them will do as my stylist did and squeal \\"I LOVE Boma!\\"  I've loved Boma since the first time I went there over ten years ago, and when I moved to Orlando this summer you better believe that the first big occasion that came up, our wedding anniversary, was an immediate excuse to hit it up.\\n\\nLocated in the Animal Kingdom Lodge, Boma is a buffet-style restaurant with an African market theme.  It serves breakfast and dinner, and while dinner is fantastic my favorite meal is breakfast.  The usual suspects are there--breakfast meats, pastries, an omelet station,and, being Disney, Mickey waffles--so the less adventurous eaters in your party will be happy.  Me, I grab a plate and go to the right end of the line for the bobotie.  The easiest way to describe it is African crustless quiche with curry spices.  Next to it is pap, which is basically grits, and chaklaka, a spicy tomato stew with which to top the pap.  Next to these is the carving station.  If corned beef is being offered, GET IT, it's fantastic.  Don't forget the wood-grilled tomatoes and asparagus, either.  Even the mundane is good--my husband laughs when I bring my first plate back loaded with exotic food ... and tater tots.  As for dessert, go for the justly famous French toast bread pudding with vanilla and praline sauces, which goes perfectly with coffee.\\n\\nBoma's breakfast is actually one of the best dining deals at Disney--all you can eat for $25.  Dinner is $60 per person, and while I really do like the dinner buffet that's a little pricey for me.  Because it's so popular with tourists and locals alike, you do need reservations, and don't come here for an intimate meal because it's always packed.  Service is very good here, as it is throughout Disney, and the mention of a special occasion will earn you buttons and brownies decorated with Mickey ears--and, if you're lucky, light-up Tinker Bells.  I was lucky.  :D"},{"name":"Drelyse African Restaurant","address":"1911 Tamarack Cir","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"I will start this review by saying that I've been to West Africa and have had a lot of the dishes on their menu right from the tap.

The dinner portion is bigger and is $15.  The Fish and Chips is one of the restaurant's most popular menu items because it's simple and almost everyone enjoys it.  I thought the amount of fish and slaw provided in the lunch portion was a bit measly, though there were a ton of fries.  The fish, fries, and slaw tasted good.  Nothing extraordinary, but what you'd expect, which is a good thing.  Try adding malt vinegar on the fish for a different flavor.\\n\\nI've also tried the Shepherd's Pie ($15), which is made up of lamb, peas, carrots, mashed potatoes, and red wine gravy.  The mashed potatoes are actually prepared in such a way that they make up the crust-like, outer layer of the pie.  Overall, the Shepherd's Pie was very filling and satisfying.  The lamb had hints of gaminess, but it wasn't bad and to be expected.  The meat was tender and succulent and the dish generally had nice flavor.\\n\\nMeehan's brunch menu is served weekend mornings/afternoons until 3pm.  I'm not sure if it's served weekdays.  Brunch items are priced in the $9-13 range.  I've been pleased with brunch here as the food is tasty and the portions are generous.  Brunch item examples include eggs, omelets, French toast, pancakes, and \\"Irish\\" breakfast foods like bangers (sausages), rashers (bacon), soda bread, and black and white puddings.\\n\\nI've tried the Corned Beef 'n Hash ($9) which comes with chopped corned beef, green bell pepper, onions, carrots, hash browns, and two eggs.  I like to get my eggs poached.  The dish was served on a hot-from-the-kitchen metal plate served atop a wooden base.  The ingredients were seasoned and mixed together well and made for a hearty and filling meal.  I was told by a server this dish is one of Meehan's most popular brunch items.\\n\\nI've also tried the Smoked Salmon Bagel Sandwich ($12) which comes with smoked salmon, dill-whipped cream cheese, capers, red onion, lettuce, tomato, and a side of hash browns.  When I had this sandwich, stone-ground grits were substituted in for the hash browns.  The sandwich was big and delicious.  All of the ingredients were fresh from the soft, mildly smoky salmon to the crisp lettuce and succulent cream cheese.  The grits were fanastic as well, full of flavor.\\n\\nMy friends have ordered the Classic Eggs Benedict and California Omelet and were very pleased.  It's too bad the brunch menu isn't served all day.\\n\\nThe servers do a good job and are attentive.  The wait time for food is generally reasonable.  Of the items mentioned above, only the Shepherd's Pie resulted in an excessive wait, but I think it's because of that particular dish's increased prep time.\\n\\nKudos to Meehan's for showing off, at the front entrance, a framed Georgia Tech football jersey signed by coach Paul Johnson.  The pub also serves as a pick-up and drop-off point for free shuttles to Tech home football games.

When I pair a glass of wine with each course, I expect that glass of wine to be there before my food arrives not over half way through my dish.  Kind of defeats the point of pairing wine with your dish.  Same thing goes with espresso and dessert.  Maybe I'm being picky but I would expect better service from a place of this caliber.

I'd passed by several times and not paid the restaurant any attention until one day I was bored at work and perusing yelp.  I saw the reviews and decided we needed to give it a shot.  Last night was our first chance at a date night with just the two of us in a long time.  We arrived around 8:30 and were immediately seated.  We started chowing down on the house salsa and my boyfriend kept saying it was the best he'd had.  He said if the rest of the meal was as good or better than the salsa then we were going to have an awesome night and I agreed.  We both ordered margaritas and they were the best I've ever had.  He ordered the Sauza Hornitos margarita and I had the Raspberry one  We ordered Queso Salsa at the waitress' suggestion and I am so glad we did.  Yum! We also wanted to try the watermelon salsa, but they were already sold out.  We hope to go back soon to give a fruit salsa a try.\\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered fajitas and I had the chimichanga with shredded beef. The ancho chile demi glaze on the chimichanga was to die for!  The beef inside was so tender and tasty I couldn't stop eating it, even after I was full and ready to pop.  I also followed the waitress' suggestion to add some queso salsa to it was was really pleased.  We were absolutely in heaven.  The food was superb!  Neither of us came even close to being able to finish our entrees but we had to try the fried ice cream after the waitress described it to us.  She noticed how much my boyfriend and I liked the salsa so she packed some up for us along with a huge bag of chips to go home with our leftovers\\n\\nThe atmosphere was so relaxing and the staff was so friendly.  We were really surprised that it was not packed on a Friday night because Chile Verde Cafe is absolutely excellent.

They have lots of big and small tables and thought they could accommodate us within a reasonable time.  \\n\\nAt 12:30 pm it was pretty busy inside and out with patrons waiting for their number to be called.  I noticed that everyone was given a timeframe of 20 minutes.  Our wait ended up being 35 minutes, but again we had seven people.\\n\\nThis place has the old-school pushcarts style and I've only realized that I don't miss them.  Food is not often hot, the same food that isn't as popular goes back and forth between the aisles, your favourite dish may never come out, and if it does your neighboring table could swipe all of it and leave you with nothing (but they, it's fair game).\\n\\nThat's kinda what happened over dimsum yesterday.\\n\\nYou are able to order specific dishes that you want from the workers but it could take anywhere inbetween coming within 10 minutes or never at all.

I was blown away.  We checked in 30 minutes prior to our reservation and were seated about 10-15 minutes prior to our reservation time.  Much to my delight we were seated in the West Wing.  We had to walk through the ballroom to get to the West Wing and I was in complete awe.  I'm fairly certain my jaw was on the floor and my eyes teared up.  Talk about attention to detail!  The ceiling and chandeliers in the ballroom were amazing!  And the \\"snow\\" falling outside the windows looked so real!  As we were being led to the West Wing the Beast came out and walked through the restaurant.  The servers refered to him as \\"the master.\\"  The master walked by us and bowed on his way to the West Wing.  \\nWhen we walked into the West Wing I'm pretty sure my jaw dropped again.  The rose!  The slashed painting of the prince!  WOW!  And just as we got to our table thunder started rumbling and our hostess pointed to the slashed painting... when the thunder sounds the portrait flashes to the Beast's picture for a few seconds and then back to the prince.  Amazing!\\nOk, the food.  I admit I was here more for the atmosphere than the food but WOW was the food good!  I ordered the lemonade that comes with wildberry foam on top - delicious!  They brought us these amazing rolls before dinner that were so good we went through two baskets of them!  My mom and I both ordered the cornish hen; my husband ordered the steak.  The hen was cooked perfectly and full of flavor.  It was served with fingerling potatoes and a few spears of asparagus which were both good as well.  I turned to ask my husband how his steak was only to find he had devoured the entire thing already so I'm going to assume he liked his meal as well.  \\nJust when I thought it couldn't get any better our waitress rolled over a cart full of desserts.  Well, crap.  We're in trouble now!  So, as ashamed as I am to admit it after all the food we had already eaten, we ordered a chocolate cupcake, a strawberry cupcake, a lemon meringue cupcake, and a chocolate cream puff.  Yes, all of those delectable morsels made their way onto our table.  I was slightly consoled by the fact that my husband ate far more than I did, BUT once I had taken one bite of that strawberry cupcake I almost stabbed him with my fork when he tried to take a bite for himself.  That cupcake was phenomenal.  The chocolate and lemon ones were also very good but man, if I could only have one it would definitely be the strawberry!  My husband is the only one who ate the cream puff and he appeared to love every bite - he kept saying \\"you have to try this\\" while pulling it closer and closer to himself.  \\nAs we were leaving the Beast was greeting guests in his study so we stopped to visit and got our photos taken with him.  We passed by suits of armour on the way to the exit and they were talking amongst themselves.  Yes, talking suits of armour.  So cool.  And the stained glass wall right inside the front door that is an exact replica of the stained glass window at the beginning of Beauty and the Beast... it was incredible.\\nAll in all, they hit every detail AND provided excellent food while doing it.  It has been 4 days since we had dinner there and I am still talking about it to everyone I know.  We left the restaurant 5 minutes before Wishes started so we were able to watch Wishes between the two castles and we were right in the middle of the action - fireworks going off all around us!  It rounded off an excellent dining experience perfectly and made for an incredibly magical night at the Magic Kingdom.\\nIf you are a Beauty and the Beast fan, make a reservation for this restaurant - you WILL NOT be sorry!  But make sure you book 180 days in advance or you won't get in!  Some girls in line behind us at the check-in desk were trying to just walk in  and the manager told her \\"sorry girls, we're booked through July right now.\\"  I am so glad I plan in advance!

I called ahead to make reservations and when I arrived I was blown away to find our table decorated to the nines with Happy Birthday centerpieces, fun red tinsel, lit candles, and a Reserved placard.  The dinner was exceptional for my whole party and as a surprise ending, they brought out a cake my friends made and everyone sang me Happy Birthday.  They also took a picture of me blowing out my candles, and a group shot of our table.  Before we left they gave me prints of these shots, which turned out beautifully and had special birthday messages printed on them.  Wow!!!

Yes, the fire-roasted flavor was a solid nod to the \\"fornos\\" of the Old World, but I could have easily paid half and had a more fulfilled pie in Altamonte Springs. The family salad was tasty, but went quickly as the large pizza did not fill up our hungry party of three. Though the servers were attentive to our needs, they seemed rather annoyed we were not extending our dining experience by adding additional menu items to our bill. We wanted water, and I felt pressure to either get a soft drink or wine. \\n\\nThe decor was wonderful and made me miss Naples and la vita bella Italia, but it certainly isn't enough to really motivate me to come back and drop that much money on pizza and a salad.

The service as slow, even though the restaurant was not particularly busy.  We ordered a seafood tower, which did not strike us as fresh enough - the boiled shrimp, crab legs and lobster tail were rather dry and too chewy, and the tuna poke was comprised of sinewy, inferior cuts without enough marinade.  It was my son's birthday, so we ordered their signature lava cake and asked for a candle to surprise him.  It took so long to come that we cancelled it, at which point the waitress delivered it to the table without a candle, saying it was ready, and charging the full price of nearly $12 for it.

I consider myself pretty well versed in baked goods, so I felt the impulsive urge to backtrack and try one of these buns after being stumped. Manioc, or cassava, is a tuber used to create tapioca. This is used instead of wheat flour at Quejos. If you have had tapioca pudding or bubble tea with pearls, you can guess the consistency of Quejos cheesebuns: they are dense and chewy. While these aren't necessarily favourable adjectives when describing baked goods, the texture of these buns is unique and enjoyable, especially if you make a sandwich using them. Like many of the reviews here, I too recommend getting a bun with added flavours because these extra ingredients reduce the glutinous quality of the buns. I read online that poor quality manioc contains cyanide and can be harmful.

Neverland Tea Salon in Kits is another addition to the afternoon tea scene. With 2 birthdays in October, we had to try it out. They listed a gluten-dairy option for their Afternoon Tea Set at $37 pp, which was a real draw because one of our friends had dietary restrictions. And who doesn't want to be transported for an afternoon to Neverland? \\n\\nAs far as ambiance goes, it's quaint, bright and nicely decorated. However, the tea dining area is quite compact. People bumping up against chairs, handful of tables. Also, it was kind of loud with all the chatter and echoing in the open concept kitchen/dining area with exposed high ceilings. Not that I don't enjoy a lively atmosphere, but not when we signed up for afternoon tea with the purpose to enjoy treats and gab with friends. A tea salon is not a bistro. And that was the overall feel - more bistro, less tea salon. \\n\\nI am guessing because of the size of the room and small number of tables, they only had one highchair available. It was being used by another table, so our little one was not able to use one. This might be something to note if you plan on bringing a little one. \\n\\nThe tea selection was really good. We ordered the Neverland blend and Peter's Promise. Hands down we all loved Peter's Promise. Really good. Really good. Did I say really good. Peter's Promise. (Also we loved the little details and references to Neverland throughout - menu items, decor, etc). It was also nice that each pot did not have tea leaves. Ordinarily, we were worrying about steeping our tea for too long or tea leaves getting weak and needed refill. One unique feature was that their tea was brewed separately and refilled as needed. There were no leaves to worry about in our pot.\\n\\nNow to the food. The savouries (little sandwiches) were yummy delicious and generous portions - both regular and gluten free versions. We all liked the roasted veg sandwich the best. Mmm mushrooms. The scones with devonshire cream and jam were not as generous in portion (we only got a little one each) and a bit on the dry hard side. As for the gluten free version, it fell apart easily (as do a lot of gluten free products do) and they had a dairy free devonshire cream which was a bit like clumpy butter. The desserts were overall tasty. To be honest, this is where most of the afternoon tea places fail. However, we had a raspberry marshmallow square, chocolate cake (really dense and rich), and a chocolate cup with passionfruit cream and fruits. We all loved the chocolate cup. However, none of us were fans of the marshmallow not because it didn't taste good but because it was a marshmallow. \\n\\nOverall the service was pleasant and made us feel very comfortable. \\n\\nI would go back again if ever in Kits. However, for $37pp it is a bit on the steep side for the small portions. Definitely worth trying it out once."},{"name":"Amigos Mexican Restaurant","address":"6549 Perimeter Dr","city":"Dublin","stars":"4","text":"Had a chance to stop in today.

It houses two pool tables and a Williams pinball table \\"The Machine:Bride of Pinbot\\" (which is a solid table from the early 90's.) A huge dance floor is smack dab in the middle of this huge emporium if debauchery and  includes a stage that hosts karaoke Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday nights  as well as bands on the weekend. The area to the right of the stage is set up like a living room with couches, recliners, coffee tables, and a tv. Perfect for an intimate gathering of friends!\\n\\nThe down to earth staff, slow at times, make you feel like you're just rapping with another bar regular. As mentioned before, their hands are made of lead! A hint: if you're a video poker addict the machines pay out often due to high traffic.

Frasca is a small restaurant and so I'd made reservations weeks in advance.  We had an 8:15 reservation but they were running a little behind.  The host took our coats and offered us the wine/cocktail list to browse while we waited.  There are a handful of bar seats and if you're very lucky maybe you can score one.  After a few minutes we were led to our table and the waitress explained the menu in great detail.  It was a prix fixe menu of 5 different courses, although you could order individually if you didn't want all 5.  But why do that if you're going all out?  The prix fixe was $66/person and included a wide variety of foods.  I was surprised to see so many dishes with some sort of seafood.  In addition to our 5 courses we started with the Frico Caldo which was like a hashbrown with crispy cheese on top - oh I don't know, there is no way for me to describe how wonderful it tasted.  It came in 4 little triangles, just enough for our party.   All of our entrees were superb.  I thought the main standouts were the lobster gnocchi, the hamachi, the red snapper main course, and the beef shoulder main course.  Because I don't have much of a sweet tooth I ordered the formaggio plate for my dessert which had an extra $2 charge.  There were 3 cheeses - gorgonzola, something else I can't remember, and buffalo milk cheese.  I was really excited to try the buffalo milk - because I LOVE buffalo!  It was very mild, soft, and smooth.  The cheese plate included marinated grapes, a housemade red pepper jelly, and an excellent honey.  The other dessert entrees were good, but they didn't compare to the other courses.  The main standout in the dessert courses we had was an apple cider ice cream that was served with the carrot cake.  The carrot cake was nothing special, but the ice cream was outstanding.\\nAs you would expect the service is professional, attentive, and top notch.  The courses were served and empty plates cleared away at just the right moments.  The courses were not served in a hurry ... our dinner lasted nearly 3 hours, however those 3 hours seemed to fly by.  Maybe it was the cocktails :o)\\nSo if you are looking for some place to go all out and enjoy yourself with fantastic food, wine, and service ... definitely consider Frasca."},{"name":"Bagel World III Bakery & Deli","address":"323 Main St","city":"Reading","stars":"3.5","text":"Perfect if you're looking for a great place to get a coffee and bagel, or a tasty lunch.

Service is APPALLING. It is not only that the line is long. It is that the employees do NOT care and go as slow as humanly possible. I have waited in line there with only two people in front of me and it's still taken me twenty minutes to actually get to order, and another ten to get my food and get out of the store. The servers do not pay any attention to the food the other employees are making for other customers either. Because of this, if you order the same type of bagel as the person two people behind you in line, they will probably leave sooner than you, with your sandwich, as their server will probably steal the bagel that yours put in the toaster for you. I watched this happen to me TWICE the last time I was there, as we were all getting everything bagels. They also all speak to each other while they should be working, which normally wouldn't be a problem, but they will actually stop in the middle of making your sandwich to have a full, five minute conversation with another employee  and then they will ask you what you want on the sandwich literally 4 different times because they're too distracted gabbing away to pay attention for 20 seconds. They will also completely ignore the next customer in line for a good few minutes after they have actually managed to complete an order so that they can have an unninteruppted conversation. Meanwhile, if you're the next customer , you get to stand awkwardly on the other side of the glass partition and attempt to get their attention.

If you are from the Northeast, trust me and wait it out until you return home to get your Italian fix--this is coming from a full-blooded Italian-American who has travelled almost the entire Italian peninsula, lived there for four months in college, and still has relatives living over there. TRUST ME, the food here is NOT authentic.\\n\\nFirst of all, we came here with my aunt, who has a gluten allergy, and the manager told her that the only things she could order on the menu were gluten-free pasta with marinara and salad. Then she says, \\"Oh, there's also the cream sauce, which only has a little bit of flour.\\" My aunt was like, \\"No, I'm allergic to gluten. I can't have ANY gluten.\\" The manager shrugged and replied, \\"Some people eat it.\\" Um? Are those \\"some people\\" in fact...people WITHOUT gluten allergies, by any chance? When she got her pasta, it looked pretty revolting. It was clumpy, broken pieces of pasta, parts were mushy and other parts were uncooked, and apparently the sauce tasted like it came out of a jar. She declared it inedible and sent it back. So if you are gluten free, don't even CONSIDER coming here, they have nothing for you here.\\n\\nFrom my perspective as a gluten lover, the rest of the food was just okay. The fritto misto was super heavy. While I realize it is a platter of deep-fried morsels, the breading was just too much, and to be quite honest, I enjoyed my calamari from the Macaroni Grill at the airport more than I did Via Napoli's. The family-style salad was just a bag of spring mix with cheap olive oil and a hint of vinegar...and they charged us $35 for it. It made the Olive Garden's salad look like a culinary masterpiece.\\n\\nOf course, after all the rave reviews, what else would I order besides the pizza? I will admit that the pizza was the best thing I ate that night. The dough was prepared in an authentic style. However, the mozzarella cheese had zero flavor, which kills the whole thing, really, especially when ordering a pizza bianca as I did. If this is the best pizza you have ever had, my heart goes out to you.

First, the food was entirely mediocre. I had a vegetarian dish that had fresh veggies but was in just a bland watery sauce and with really dry tasteless tofu on top. My friend had a lemon chicken dish that was literally just chunks of fried chicken on shredded lettuce with a goopy sauce on the side. Our potstickers were greasy and bleh. But the real kicker was the terrible service-- my entree came out approximately 15 minutes before our shared appetizer and then it was another 15 minutes before my friend got her entree. So most of the meal was me eating uncomfortably while she waited. We never did get any rice (though they still tried to charge us for it). The free tea was nice but no refills. Grumpy waitresses when we complained (and the place was half empty). Also it's a total dive, which is fine if the food's amazing, but it's not. Oh, also, I didn't see any dim sum.

That and the fact that my family is from Taiwan and I still haven't found a Taiwanese place in Atlanta that I'm in love with yet.\\n\\nATMOSPHERE - 5 stars\\nThe decor is very American fusion, and much cleaner and prettier than you would find at a normal Asian hole in the wall restaurant. The space is on the smaller side, but I like that they have a range of different sized tables. There were a few booths that seat 4 people, 5,  6, a few tables for 2, and a large community table that seats 12. You'll also find that half the customers are groups of Asians, and the other half of customers are white. I feel like that's a pretty good ratio and what I would expect for a good Asian restaurant in the city. \\n\\nFOOD - 4 stars\\nThe food isn't as great as what you would find in Taiwan, and I think my own Ah-Ma (Taiwanese for grandma) would cook the dishes better. But when you go to restaurants anywhere, that's usually the case. So overall the food is pretty good and better than I've found at other Taiwanese restaurants in Atlanta. The only thing that prevents me from giving it a 5 star is the price - it is a bit higher than I would expect for traditional Taiwanese food. \\n\\nSalt and Pepper Chicken ($5.50) - Decent, but not great. The seasoning was just on the outside and the actual chicken was more bland and a little too dry. It also didn't crisp up as nicely. It felt like it had been sitting in the fryer for longer and wasn't flash fried. Regardless, it is still a classic appetizer dish that you should order.\\n\\nBeef noodle soup ($10) - Again, pretty decent. The soup is pretty deceiving because it doesn't look like there's enough, but there was more soup left at the end than noodles. I did enjoy this dish, since the noodles were nice and chewy and slightly fatter than noodles we use at home. There was also a good amount of beef in the soup. \\n\\nLu Rou Fan/Minced pork rice ($5.50) - Not as great as what my grandma makes at home. The pork juices were a little too wet, and so was the rice. The texture was in between congee and regular rice. If the rice were a bit more al dente and the minced pork had slightly bigger chunks, then it would've been better.\\n\\nPork belly bao ($4.50) - This was great! It isn't a big as the gua bao that you would find at Bento Cafe, but it is bigger than what you would find at Baohaus in NYC. The steamed bun was soft, and the pork belly was nice and soft and fatty. Beware, it contains peanuts! But again, a bit pricier than I would expect for a bao this size.\\n\\nIce Cream Bao ($4.50) - They deep fry the steamed bun used in their savory bao's, fill it with Jake's ice cream, and top it with crushed peanuts. This was very unique and I had never seen anything like it before. Brilliant and creative! \\n\\nSERVICE - 4 stars\\nThe waitress was pretty good at making sure we had our waters filled and that our food all came out. However, once more people started trickling in and all the seats were filled, there definitely was a delay in service from bringing us the dessert menu 10 minutes after she said she would, and also our checks. Other than that, she was great.\\n\\nOverall impression? Ah-ma's will be my go-to place for decent authentic Taiwanese food in the city, but I'm not sure how often I'll be frequenting it given its higher prices. Also, if you are an Asian in Atlanta, you'll very likely bump into people you know."},{"name":"Barley's Brewing Company","address":"467 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"This was my first stop after checking in the hotel.

From a co-worker I had heard there was a store that sold pizza similar to what I told him Wally's was like and lo and behold I found Dicarlo's.  I had tried to get Dicarlo's a few months ago but the store was closed (or no one answered the phone) but this time I was able to place my order for some pepperoni, mushroom and extra cheese.\\n\\nI arrived 15 minutes later and my pizza was ready to go.  There is no place to sit, inside or outside, so be prepared that this is takeout only..unless you do like me and eat a few pieces in the car while it's hot (which I'd highly recommend).  First of all this pizza is almost exactly like my favorite pizza from Cambridge.  It's cooked fresh to order with dough and sauce and then the toppings and cheese are added when the pizza comes out of the oven.  They call this West Virginia style I guess.  I call it \\"most delicious pizza ever style\\" though!  \\n\\nThe cheese melts just slightly in the box so you get the fresh cheese taste but also the melted taste.  As you can see from my picture when you ask for extra cheese you certainly get it.  It's a very high quality cheese and tastes full flavored and slighlty buttery and perfect.  A good cheese separates the average run of the mill pizza from the best and Dicarlos has fantastic cheese.  The pepperoni though here is certainly worth mentioning as it surpasses Wally's in both taste and size.  It's very slightly larger (thicker) and tastes more seasoned than any other pepperoni, save perhaps The Flying Pizza, that I've tasted on pizza.  The sauce is a tangy, sweet sauce, which I would have liked a bit more of.  The sauce was sufficient while eating the first few pieces in the car but by the time I had gotten back to the office and eat the last couple of pieces the breading had absorbed the sauce and it made the pizza slightly dry.\\n\\nAnd lastly, the actual pizza dough is superb.  It's very New York style like (which is maybe why I love this style of pizza) despite being cut into squares.  It's got a nice crispness on the bottom and is slightly more doughy in the middle.  It's slightly thicker than the Wallys pizza I'm used to so the pieces are more filling, but I don't have a problem with that.  The only downside is as per above, maybe get a bit more sauce if you plan to reheat some as the bread soaks up a bit of the sauce.\\n\\nAll in all Dicarlos is KICKASS pizza and while you may or may not think it's the best pizza in Columbus, you should try it as there's nothing like it in Columbus.  That's right, there are over 1,000 pizza places in this city and all the neighboring suburbs but there is nothing at all like Dicarlos pizza.  So if you're looking for something different and delicious I'd highly recommend Dicarlos."},{"name":"Jiko - The Cooking Place - Temporarily Unavailable","address":"2901 Osceola Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"We went here for our anniversary dinner.

After searching for reservations on the My Disney Experience App for over three weeks, I finally got a reservation for 4 for an early dinner (6:10pm).\\n\\nFirst, the entire restaurant is amazing. We sat in the main dining hall with the beautiful chandeliers and the snowing landscape. The West Wing contains the Beasts photo (changes from Beast to Prince every 12 minutes when the Enchanted Rose's petal drops. Look out for the lightning because that's when the Beast flashes through the painting.) The Enchanted Rose is also neat. It's a hologram rose in a glass cover and it rotates... very magical looking. The other room is the Music Box room. A life size music box of Belle and the Beast dancing. The room also features paintings and tapestries from different scenes of the movie. This is your most brightest room. Everywhere else is pretty dimly lit. Although we were in the main dining hall, the cast members will encourage you to visit the other two rooms and never rushes you. When you're done with dinner and only when you're done, you can visit the Beast for photos in the Library. =o) He's awesome. Oh and every 15 minutes, the Beast moves from the Library to the West Wing to greet his honored guests (and takes a short break). Make sure to clap as he loves a lot of attention (or at least that's what they tell you!) \\n\\nOn to the service and food. Since we wore our Happy Anniversary pins, they brought grey matter at the end with the lovely wording, \\"Happy Anniversary!\\" They also had a signed card from the staff which I thought was a pleasant touch. \\n\\nMy party had Braised Pork (Coq au Vin Style) and the Grilled Strip Steak. Both delicious and highly recommended. For desserts, Strawberry Cream Cheese Cupcake and The Master's Cupcake with the \\"grey stuff.\\" I totally recommend that Grey Stuff (from the song).

The first time i went here I brought some out of town friends after spending half an hour looking online at different menus.  One of my guests was vegetarian and the menu had some items she could eat but when we arrived we were told that they only serve cheese and charcuterie at night.  The online menu states lunch hours but does not make it clear that they do not serve all of the food all day. We left and went to Coal Vines. Strike 1\\n\\nMy 2nd visit was on a Friday night. We were given the option to sit at the bar or one end of the community table. I was with a friend that I hadn't chatted with in forever so we were hoping to catch up.  We tried sitting at the bar at first but quickly moved to a table once it freed up.  Sitting at the bar, we were right next to the tv which had basketball on.  I get it that it is March Madness but if I wanted a sports crowd I would go to a sportsbar.  There were two men sitting next to us that were obnoxiously into the game.  Even after moving to a small table they were still disturbingly loud.  This was worsened when someone decided to turn the music up to nightclub level.  The couple sitting next to us were also bothered.\\n\\nThis is not the environment or service I expect from a place that touts wine and cheese.

Then they ask if you are paying together or separate.  We are all AP's so we got a enchanted rose.  You order at a kiosk, which I don't love and apparently others don't either because there is a person stationed at every kiosk to explain/help with the process.  I ordered the potato leek soup and croque monsieur.  We then picked out a table, gathered our silverware, filled our drinks and sat down.  You set the enchanted rose on your table and then waiters roll the food out on carts.\\nThe potato leek soup was everything I wanted and dreamed of.  It had a nice delicate flavor, and the perfect amount of creaminess.  I hate chunks in my potato soup.  This soup is pureed and it was glorious.  The Croque Monsieur was also really good, but the bread was a bit dense for my taste, though it was very flavorful.  I would definitely come for lunch again, but I don't know if I would wait in that line again.  \\nThey have recently added breakfast to Be our Guest and rumor has it that they are changing the way they do lunch so stay tuned.  \\nI have also had dinner here.  For dinner you must make a reservation via the website or 407-WDW-Dine.  Be our Guest is the only place that serves alcohol in MK and they only have wine and beer.  At Dinner you do get your picture taken with The Beast, but no other characters are there.  For dinner I hate (surprise) potato leek soup and is the same at lunch and dinner.  For an entr√©e I had steak frites which came with this garlic sauce that was out of this world.  I asked for extra.  We finished up with cupcakes and some grey stuff.  I really enjoyed dinner, but it was very pricey for what I got.  Soup, steak, cupcake equaled $66 for just me.  I would just assume eat here for lunch, but then you gotta wait in line, so the question is do you want to spend more money or do you want to wait in line.  Either way, if you are at MK, this is a great dining option."},{"name":"FINO Restaurant Patio & Bar","address":"2905 San Gabriel St, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I was really teetering between four and five stars here, but to give less than five here is like complaining about gas prices on a road trip: you're having such a good time, why bother focusing on the negative?\\n\\nBesides the ample parking and upper-bunk locale, FINO comforts physically by being warm and sophisticated. You can actually *hear* the people sitting across the table from you, but you can't hear the drunks at the bar, the hostess on the phone or the cooks burning their fingers. Decor I hardly noticed because I was so enthralled by the menu.\\n\\nLittle baby tiny menus that make spacial sense on the table. Each item was described matter-of-factly with ingredients that made me curious and salivate at the same time (like Winona Ryder in Beetlejuice. I was 15 -- what can I say?)\\n\\nI wish I hadn't driven myself here, because I wanted to try each cocktail. I went with the Cedar Fever (I love a good, stiff shot of irony) and it was like listening to music by moonlight (I will buy you dinner at FINO if you know that reference!) I tasted some other drinks at the table, and there wasn't a loser in the bunch.\\n\\nMy entree, the steak, was pretty amazing. Well-cooked and served with beets (a childhood fave), potatoes and red onion jam, it rivaled many I've had and left others clearly in the dust (I'm looking at you, Justine's). The server was knowledgeable and recommended it; he took perfect care of the table.\\n\\nThe only thing less than perfect was my glass of Solitude (and I do loves my solitude). It really couldn't hang with the steak. As my table-mate put it: \\"if I'm having it at home, and I paid $11 for the bottle, it's pretty good. But I just paid $11 for a glass!\\"\\n\\nAnd that brings me to the other rub on this road trip in gastronomica: the price. I know I'm kind of cheap, and I am certainly willing to pay big bucks for a good meal. But FINO has priced themselves at a point for me that keeps it from being a regular spot and taking more of my money and makes it a special occasion place.\\n\\nI guess until I get more money for them to take."},{"name":"Wildfire","address":"94 Perimeter Ctr W","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I ate here solo on a business trip to Atlanta, however I am no stranger to Lettuce Entertain You establishments.

I am fine with communal tables, just wish they would tell you that when you make the reservation.

They're clearly aiming for a Euro-cafe character, but they don't push it too far. I've been coming since the week they opened and it's been great to see them develop their own personality.\\n\\nAs for the food and drinks, they do the basics admirably using high-quality ingredients, but go beyond that by featuring new and interesting items that you probably won't find elsewhere. For me, nothing warms up a rainy fall evening like their Almond Earl Grey tea. I take it as a sign of good taste that they seem to stay away from cloying \\"candy\\" drinks (the Caramel-White Chocolate-Marshmallow-Latteccinos you'll find at some other places).\\n\\nSide note: Kudos for always having at least a couple of vegetarian options, clearly marking which soups are veg., awesome vegan brownies, and soy milk options for drinks (standard these days, but still appreciated).\\n\\nOverall, Crema seems like a place run by people who truly care about great coffee, quality food, and creating a welcoming space for people to meet, hang out, study, or just sit and contemplate life over a steaming mug of one's favorite drink.

I got there before my co-workers and asked for seating for 3. The hostess looked around very dramatically for seating and told me it would be 15 minutes. There was a table that had about 6 empty chairs in it but I said nothing and told her I would wait. I sat at the bar and asked the bartender what local beer he would recommend.  He rolled his eyes and said \\"look at the wall and pick one, they're all good.\\"  Really??  Where does he think he is?? The hottest club in NYC at 2 am??  I don't think so.  I hang out in NYC and bartenders are more polite than this pretentious fool.  15 minutes later the rest of my party arrives and I let the hostess know and she looks annoyed and says \\"thanks for telling me, I'll let you know when we have a table.\\"  The table with 6 chairs is still empty.  10 minutes later the hostess seats us,  guess where?? Yes the communal table with 6 empty chairs! No one else sat in the other 3 while we had dinner.  Aside from the pretentiousness, the food and beer was very good and we enjoyed the open concept kitchen. The waitress was very nice and attentive and eventually so was the hostess. The food is a bit pricy for Portland though, $25 on average for entr√©e, but the local beer was inexpensive.  It's a cool place but they could lose the attitude."},{"name":"Taka Sushi and Passion","address":"4600 Roswell Rd","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"4","text":"I might give this one 3.5 stars but for going to round down to 3. My first experience at Taka was a bit disappointing for me, as I had been eagerly reading reviews from when it first opened as well as stalking their (curious) social media. I invited a client for lunch and of course hoped for the best, but what we got was mediocre - with some highlights. \\n\\nThe new Taka is located in the large strip mall at 4600 Roswell Rd, anchored by Sprouts on one end and CVS on the other. It's a large complex with a lot of retail and some residential; The Collection apartments are located in the back. Newly built and obviously designed to be a mixed use complex, it's highly walkable but there's hardly any parking. I was nearly frantic trying to find a spot. (Obviously this is not Taka's fault and I definitely don't blame them, just pointing it out!)\\n\\nWe were seated right away; the OpenTable reservation I made was unnecessary. There's some really nice outdoor seating areas, a smaller dining room and the sushi bar so lots of room to go around. \\n\\nService was unremarkable. Our waitress was very friendly but disappeared after taking our order. \\n\\nWe split: \\n- Seaweed Salad ($5): five bucks seems a little excessive for this but whatever. The portion was large and the quality was higher than I was expecting when I ordered it. Would order again! \\n\\n- Grilled Brussels Sprouts ($7.70): I hate to say it but these were completely disappointing... I didn't go back for a second bite. The sprouts were absolutely swimming in black pepper, rendering them inedible. We didn't send them back as we had so many other items to munch on instead, but probably should have if just to alert the kitchen. \\n\\n- Japanese-style Gyoza Dumpling ($7.50): again, wow at this pricing... $1.25 per dumpling just seems so out of line with other restaurants in the area...but I'm wondering if they're all this expensive and I'm just crazy?! [EDIT: OK there are some comparable places price-wise. But damn.]\\n\\n- CNN Roll ($15; spicy tuna roll topped with sliced red tuna): named for the red-on-red CNN logo colors. Standard and just OK. \\n\\n- Levolor Roll ($9.70; tuna, avocado and mango roll topped with sliced cucumbers): this is the kind of roll I was hoping for with my Taka visit! Creative, original, texturally complex, tasty AF. YUM. Definitely recommend this one! \\n\\n- Rainbow Roll ($15.70; eel, cucumber and avocado roll topped with tuna, salmon, yellowtail, shrimp, and avocado): another standard. Once again, just OK. \\n\\n- Eel & Avocado Roll ($9.70; eel, cucumber and avocado topped with a mountain of red tobiko): this one had the potential to just be another standard sushi roll but the mass of tasty, quality tobiko topping the eel roll pushed it over the edge. Really yummy, and I was impressed with the texture! It was also just beautiful. \\n\\n- Lobster Tempura Roll ($18; lobster tempura with asparagus, mayo and masago wrapped with soy bean sheets): another disappointment. For nearly $20, I expected this one to blow me away but from both a flavor and texture standpoint it was kind of blah. \\n\\nAll in all, I had hoped for a better meal at these prices. I could tell the ingredient quality was quite high, and maybe I just ordered all wrong, but when looking at the meal as a whole there were just as many misses as there were hits. I was impressed enough by the items we liked (seaweed salad, Levolor Roll, Eel & Avocado Roll) that I'd come back to try some other items, but not if I was paying."},{"name":"Villa Nova Ristorante","address":"5545 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Went to Villa for dinner.

The onion rings, all 4 of them were $3.49, really??  Who are you kidding and they were nothing special.  Cheddar's has a tower of onion rings for like $5.75 that is totally worth it.   The shake was okay, but not sure it was worth $3.99.

We had watched Julie and Julia the night before, so in maintaining the tradition came here. Alas there was no boeuf bourginone. Whatever: we had fun anyway. Some of us got the set menu, while I tried the duck pate and duck confit. The pate was delicious, the confit with cranberries and walnuts a bit too-Thanksgiving-esque for me. At home, my mom would have had the confit fried to a crisp and shredded, over rice and plum sauce: a Chinese take on it. Moving on. Bf's scallops with a cream sauce were amazing, and his dad's rack of lamb with mint jelly was amazing, too. For dessert, take note that creme de caramel is FLAN. Profiteroles were amazing--speaking as a non-profiterole lover; chocolate mousse was too intense for this chocoholic, actually just boring as there was no contrast! Bf's dessert of the apple crepe with Calvados was SCRUMPTIOUS; his sister also liked my creme brulee, although I found it lackluster. Ah well.

To start off, the hostess was incredibly friendly and sat us at a wonderful table that allowed us to sit side by side (some people don't like that- but I accepted her offer to do so). The staff was incredibly knowledgeable about their wine menu, as was our waiter with the dinner menu. Our waiter offered great suggestions for each course, and gave us helpful descriptions of how everything is cooked, etc. At any nice restaurant, you expect staff that is knowledgeable about their menus, but that isn't always what you get. Frasca really hit it out the park with the quality of their service... Not only was our waiter wonderful, but bread service came around several times (which never happens), as did the water (which also never happens). They were very attentive- always on top of our table with topping off our wine glasses, filling our water glasses, and checking on us (but it wasn't to the point where it was annoying by any means- also a plus). The four courses were spaced out perfectly, and considering they aren't the largest portions, having the four courses was the perfect amount of food, and we didn't leave painfully stuffed.\\n\\nNow, onto the food... Everything was cooked perfectly, and the presentation was very creative and professional. We always end up ordering the same things when we go out, since we have very similar tastes in food, so the nice thing about the four course menu is that you can try many options together. We started with the Prosciutto/Speck platter which was so fresh and delicious with the horseradish creme fraiche it was served with. A must try before your meal. For appetizers we shared the \\"Uovo Croccante\\"- a fried egg, with potato, frisee, and black truffle, and the \\"Pesce Crudo\\"- Hiramasa and shrimp (both raw) with cucumber radish and orange. Both had great textures, and the combination of flavors really complimented each other. I enjoyed the fried egg dish a little more, simply because of the way the egg was cooked- with a runny inside- and fried outside. For the Primi we went for the Beef cheek ravioli- with salsify, fonduta, and black truffle (A MUST!!!), and the \\"Zilkrofi\\"- a triangular shaped/ stuffed pasta- with Musetto, Prune, and smoked ricotta. Two completely different pasta dishes, but both were delicious. The sauces on both were incredible and the ingredients worked well together. I will definitely be back for the Beef cheek ravioli! For our main courses, I went for the Grouper- with Buckwheat, Horseradish, Cabbage, and Beet. Originally I was turned off by the beet (not my favorite) but the beet sauce was a wonderful compliment. The grouper was cooked PERFECTLY, and the top of it was very crispy and delicious. He tried the short ribs two ways- which was also delicious.  For our desserts, we went with the Panna Cotta- the blood oranges in it was the perfect combination, and the Chocolate Genache Torte which had an amazing caramel sauce, and was served with a side of a yummy gelato. They brought out our deserts with a big leaf on it, with \\"Happy Birthday\\" written in white chocolate, and whoever decorated it had quite the hand. It as beautiful!\\n\\nPoint being, the service was amazing, as was the food. I figured I would include what we tried from the current menu, incase anyone wanted to go try those dishes. It was the perfect Birthday dinner, from start to finish, and I didn't expect anything less from Frasca.

My friend order the lamb vindaloo and I had the chicken kurma.  The chicken kurma is my all-time favorite Indian dish.  I used to go to this place in Virginia that had what I thought was the best chicken korma ever.  The chicken kurma at Himalayas did not measure up to that.  It did not have the coconut flakes and the creamy texture that I liked so much about the chicken korma near my old place.  It was not bad though and it was definitely better than the vindaloo dish that my friend got.  I used to like eating vindaloo a lot before I discovered korma.

Another deduction for bread that came with butter? For a place that prides itself on authenticity I would have expected olive oil. \\n\\nWhen at Frasca, DRINK WINE.

I was coming from a wake with a group of friends from high school, no one knew anything about Waltham, but everyone was ready for beers and laughs.  I've had mixed results with brew pubs in the past because most brew pubs focus too hard on giving quirky names to mediocre beers and tired food.  Unfortunately, the menu was full of red flags.  The burger said things like \\"pork it\\" \\"veg it\\" and \\"blacken it\\".  This usually means the restaurant is covering their inferior burgers with veggies, spices, and yes--pork.  \\n\\nAnyways, we ordered a pitcher of summer ale, an Irish red ale, and an IPA.  The summer ale was undoubtedly half water.  This was not just light beer, but watered down dishonest brew.  It was like the Iran - Contra of beer brewing--either the brewers were in on the scam or too stupid to know what was happening.  Either way, they should be ousted.  The IPA and Irish Red were forgettable.\\n\\nMy girlfriend told the waiter she thought there was something wrong with the beer, and he told her it was a \\"light\\" beer.  Thanks Anheiser Busch, I can't wait to impress my dinner guests with sophisticated brewer's terms. \\n\\nThe food came out and my burger was bone-dry.  My friends ordered the pulled pork, which had also been sitting out.  We asked the waiter twice for BBQ sauce because he wasn't listening, and he brought napkins just in case we wanted to sop up what little saliva we had remaining in our mouths.  Also, the three-bean chili was dried out taco meat.  \\n\\nA lot of room for improvement here, it just seems like a place where the owners wouldn't eat or drink.

Well, that isn't true.. there are LOTS of authentic chinese and vietnamese places but since I'm allergic to soy sauce there isn't anything I Can eat at those places.  My husband and I (like everyone else in Portland) LOVE thai food!! There was an amazing place called Thai Esan Tasty a little further out that was just amazing but they seem to have closed down so we have been searching for thai places close to us for some time.  --If anyone can recommend some good ones let me know!-- So we were just driving by and saw Thai Fresh.... We got excited because it is super close to where we live, even though from the outside it just looks like a little bubble tea cafe or something.  \\nActually, it is quite a nice looking place.  It is nicely decorated and they have tried to give the place a little romance with the lighting and candles.  The people that work there seem to be the owners and were very welcoming and friendly.  \\nI ordered my standard: eggplant chili w chicken and my hubby ordered his standard: pad se eww w tofu, which were both about $1 less than other non-fancy thai places.  The food came out relatively quickly but we were both disappointed in the quantity.  In actuality, it was probably a standard quantity but the last place we went to was Authentic Thai on Division and we got a lot of great tasting food there.  However, the quality was also lacking.. I couldn't taste the pad se eww (soy sauce) but the hubby said the noodles were really bland and was also dissatisfied with the ratio of noodles to veggies... personally I would prefer more veggies than noodles but he's italian!! My dish was lacking in chicken and the eggplant was undercooked.  \\nThis should not discourage you from trying this place yourself...  I could tell that most of the people there were regulars even though the place has only been open for about 5 months... As for me I will probably keep searching....\\nOverall though, I recommend this place if you're from that area.. it is a nice place, and might even  be romantic at night!! At the very least, you'd be supporting a new, family owned business..

The original location is in Buckhead.  This location, La Grotta Ravinia, is located inside the Crowne Plaza Ravinia hotel in Dunwoody.  Ravinia is a beautiful hotel and office complex located on Ashford Dunwoody Road at I-285.  It's easily accessible.\\n\\nThe property has a gorgeous garden with several paved walking trails and places to sit and relax.  The garden is multi-tiered and has a fountain, small streams, bridges, and a pond.  It's perfect for a leisurely, romantic stroll after dinner.  Speaking of dinner, La Grotta Ravinia is open for dinner only.\\n\\nI had dinner here on a Monday night and the restaurant was moderately busy.  Most of the patrons looked to be hotel guests.\\n\\nThe inside of the restaurant is nice.  The decor is traditional and elegant.  Think sophisticated, candle-lit, tablecloth dining.  High ceilings, large columns.  The highlights are the open kitchen in the center of the space, where you can see the chefs at work, and the grandiose overlook view of the Ravinia gardens.\\n\\nThe menu is relatively straightforward and focuses on simple Northern Italian cuisine: appetizers, soups, salads, meats, seafood, and pasta.  Expect to spend about $12 per app, $8 per soup or salad, $20 per pasta dish, and $25+ per meat or seafood entree.\\n\\nI tried the following:\\n\\nAntipasto Alla Grotta - prosciutto, sopressatta, veal loin, baby portabellos, fresh mozzarella, roast peppers, and grilled vegetables\\nScallopine di Vitello con Marsala e Funghi - veal scallopine sauteed with crimini mushrooms, classic marsala sauce, and roast garlic mashed potatoes\\nRavioli di Vitello con Salsa di Vodka e Pomodori - homemade veal ravioli with shiitake mushrooms, fresh spinach, and vodka tomato cream sauce\\n\\nThe Antipasto dish is ideal for sharing.  I recommend one Antipasto dish for every 2-3 people.  It has a nice variety of delicious Italian cured meats, some mozzarella served Caprese style, and seasoned mushrooms, peppers, zucchini, and asaparagus.  It's not bad.\\n\\nUnfortunately, both veal dishes let me down.  The veal scallopine (flour-coated sauteed cutlets) tasted somewhat rubbery and bland.  I did like how the meat was thinly sliced and the crimini mushrooms and roast garlic mashed potatoes were tasty.  However, the marsala sauce didn't have much flavor.\\n\\nThe veal ravioli was more promising.  Six ravioli pieces were served in the bowl.  I liked how each piece of ravioli had a slice of shiitake on top.  The meat inside the ravioli was disappointingly dry.  The vodka tomato cream sauce was salmon-colored and, like the marsala sauce, quite subtle in flavor.  The clump of spinach in the center of the bowl was way too salty.\\n\\nTwo types of bread were served at the table (one white, one multigrain) along with olive oil and freshly grated Parmesan.\\n\\nService was so-so.  Three people tended to our table.  The young water-refiller did an excellent job.  The host/server was clumsy.  While taking plates from our table, he dropped used silverware into our bread basket.  While grating Parmesan cheese over the ravioli, a bunch of cheese fell onto my phone, which was sitting on the table, and he acted like it didn't happen.  Just a sloppy job all-around.\\n\\nOur primary server was professional, but he tried to upsell us soups and salads, and it look a long time for him to check on our table between food orders, the check, etc.  Both servers were quick to whisk away plates with food still on them, without even asking if we were finished.\\n\\nIn the end, the food and service leave more to be desired.  However, I did like the dining environment and the Ravinia garden is a huge plus.\\n\\nComplimentary valet parking is available or you can self-park for free in one of the lower levels of the underground parking garage.

The only way I can account for the unreasonably high marks on Yelp is to assume that the majority of the reviewers have either never had good Ethiopian food or have never had Ethiopian food outside of Portland.  Not to be a snob, but I have actually been to Ethiopia, and I have eaten at some of the best Ethiopian restaurants in the United States, so I know what good Ethiopian food should taste like.  It's supposed to be a full-palate flavor experience with melt-in-your mouth tenderness.  This was just horrible.\\n\\nWe were visiting Portland and decided to check out Queen of Sheba because they were listed under both \\"vegetarian\\" and \\"Ethiopian.\\"  Being vegetarians, our group went with the veggie sampler, which had many of the same dishes we've eaten at other restaurants around the country.  We also ordered some Honey Wine to celebrate our visit.\\n\\nWe knew we were in trouble when the waitress brought the wine.  If you've ever had Honey Wine before, you know that it is a lovely golden color with a somewhat thick consistency (since it's made out of honey).  What she brought was a thin, brownish liquid that smelled like your father's liquor cabinet and tasted NOTHING like honey wine.  In fact, I am convinced that she just poured some cooking sherry out of a bottle and tried to pass it off as Honey Wine.  It was literally undrinkable.\\n\\nNext came the food.  The injera was reasonably good--spongy and tangy, if a little hard.  The vegetable dishes, however, were almost unrecognizable.  The cabbage was barely cooked and resembled cole slaw more than the tender, melty Ethiopian cabbage I've come to love.  The potatoes and carrots were also undercooked (and underwhelming in flavor).  The lentils had way too much spice and not enough flavor.  And the greens were like eating out of the bottom of Oscar the Grouch's trash can.  I think I actually tasted mud in them--gross.\\n\\nThe only reason I'm giving this place two stars instead of one is the friendliness of the owners.  They were very welcoming; and when they saw that we hadn't touched the Honey Wine, they took it off our bill without our having to ask.  I think they knew the wine was pretty bad, and they realized that it wasn't fair to have us pay for it.  If only they had realized the same about the food.\\n\\nAs a final caveat, I did not sample any of their meat dishes, so I can't say whether this place would be worth a try as a meat eater.  Considering that they list vegetarian dishes as their specialty, though, I can't help but think that the meat dishes would be equally bad, if not worse."},{"name":"Zyka","address":"1677 Scott Blvd","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"Well, I am forced to think why people have such rave reviews when our experience was pathetic to say the least. This place opens at noon and we were probably the second to place the order. Place looked quite spacious and clean which raised our expectation since I had heard from a colleague that the place was good.\\n\\nWe ordered butter chicken, goat masala (Chef's Special), a naan and saffron rice. Order was ready in about 5-7 minutes which was quick for the dishes we ordered but that should have explained what was going on. Let me go by each item, cuz I really have a lot to say:\\n\\nNaan - Cold! Yes, they served us cold naan. I guess this will be the worst decision you'd make in kitchen if your clay oven (tandoor) is right in front of the service window. I went back to counter and told then that the naan was cold and the first answer I get: \\"We pre-cook them and the heat them up\\"...really? That's what you got when you have a live clay oven in front of me and the fresh naan is being made? Cook/chef some senior looking guy had a smirk on face and they took back the bread and gave me the fresh one. So that was a bad start but let's move on to curries.\\n\\nButter Chicken - I have cooked and eaten enough butter chicken to tell when a butter chicken is not butter chicken! This curry was not very hot (in terms of chili pepper) but was still full of spice load. A dark looking gravy which could be termed as sweet and mellowed version of Andhra Chicken...and guess what..it was microwaved. When you open a restaurant at 12 for lunch which has about 120 person seating capacity...I would guess you can hire a decent chef who can professionally prep/cook food vs. having large curry batches that you can microwave!\\n\\nGoat Masala - So this was chef's special and quite says a lot about chef and restaurant! A heap load of spices, chili and oil in the gravy. I get it...masala gravies are more oily than regular puree based gravies but more oily means what? Half of the inch above the gravy oily? This was a mess of a curry...none of the spices worked together. It just didn't come together for us and guess what - This was microwaved too!\\n\\nSafforn Rice - Probably the only thing that I don't have anything negative about. Rice quality was good and helped in pushing some of the curry down the throat.\\n\\nSo after this fiery experience we thought we should get some 'matka kulfi' to douse the fire. We chose Chicku flavor and the ice cream came in a clay pot. Now to provide a background on Matka kulfi...its an Indian icecream that is made in a closed clay pot by shaking a batch of pots in a big vessel or clay pot filled with ice and salt. Shaking replaces the churning done in traditional icecream machine that brings the creaminess. Contrary to all this...this was a liquid, probably made of ice cream pre-mix powder and then frozen in an open clay pot in freezer. It literally had icicles in every bite.\\n\\nIt pains me when a place boasts of all the awards it has got in past year but literally their 101 of Indian cooking were not in place.

My wife and I received a glowing review of the place from some friends a while back.  \\n\\nIt started off well:  short wait, pleasant service, enticing menu.  And they made one hell of a Bloody Maria (part of the brunch special).  But it started to slide quickly.  \\n\\nThe waiter admitted he was new; but seriously...  His job is to wait tables.  A showing every once in a while to say he hadn't forgotten about us would have been nice.  The chips vanished quickly and so did my tea under the heat of the salsa.  Alas, my tongue was forced to burn while I waited for refills.\\n\\nMy wife's Migas were dry and flavorless.  I don't even recall what I had, which proves how mediocre it was.\\n\\nAll of that was forgivable, I suppose.  I think the real clincher that puts Laredo on the Blacklist for me is their tableside guac.  I'm not really a guac snob, but I like it fresh and plentiful.  For $8 and made at the table side, you really expect a strong showing on both counts.  However, for said price, we received a single avocado prepared into guacamole with some other ingredients that were probably fresh at one time, but were fresh no longer.\\n\\nI'd put it above the tub-o-guac that you can get at HEB, but no where near the bar for high end.

Not fawning, not over the top I'll Be Your Best Friend And Culinary Sherpa For The Next Hour, but just, you know, \\"nice\\". On these occasions, I was glad to tip over 20% given the level of attention and overall menschiness of the wait staff. Enter Clyde Common. We had eaten here once before and the food was quite good, but not the point of this review. Tonight we had the great privilege of being served, as far as I could tell, by Conor Oberst, who apparently has quit his music gig and decided to try his hand at being a nasty waiter. First, I gave him the satisfaction of handing me my most unfavorite preachy snark about politely declining substitutions. That is, of course, he informed me, wagging his bed- head, unless it involved a food allergy. Yeah, O.K., I'm down with the substitution clause but what in God's name would it have to do with food allergies ? Does it allow you an out because a medical condition trumps a preference for which you are paying a 300% markup ?Who died and made you the Food Jesus ? Fine. I just  went ahead and ordered the bloody dish and decided I would pick out the chunks of stuff  for which I had stupidly  failed to get a doctor's note. Silly me. I ordered 3 appetizers, thinking that they would be staggered around the entree ordered by my wife. Not so. Mr. Bright Eyes arrives with all three at once , in my face, sort of Izzy's style. The tower of appetizers. Still, you say. No biggie. Chicken wings. Guess what I asked for. I hope your sitting down. I asked for Tabasco. Not Narwhal tears. Not hummingbird urine.... Tabasco. Hot sauce. As in chicken wings and ... anybody ?... HOT SAUCE. \\" We don't have hot sauce \\" says he of the two sizes too small snap button plaid shirt. \\" No hot sauce in the entire restaurant ? \\" I ask dubiously in an attempt to smack down some serious bullshit. \\"None\\" he says, and sashays off , no doubt, to a far less demanding table at which point I walk ten feet away to the bar where the bartender gladly hands me a whole bottle of the stuff. Check please. WTF ? It gave me no great pleasure to pay the bill with a 0% tip ( yes, I am aware that it hurts the entire wait staff ) but maybe this guy's co-workers will get the message that, until he is asked to headline down the street at the Crystal, or grace the cover of GQ, he might just want to consider how effortless and lucrative it might be to move from asshole to waiter."},{"name":"Pho Jasmine Restaurant","address":"714 N Killingsworth St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Good, solid pho.

Very weird. \\nWe had met 2 other couples, and it was early so the place was pretty empty, and we were all amused enough at the kitchy dance club we had all somehow deliberately agreed to meet at - we decided to stay for a drink. And speaking of - it was happy hour... from 5-10.... on a Saturday night. And the beers were like $2-3.

The Coffee Crunch donut was a cake donut and that honestly made me very disappointed; I wanted a regular yeast donut, the fact that it was a cake donut should have been listed. Regardless the donut was mediocre and forgettable. The half dipped chocolate chip cookie was fine, it was soft and had a good amount of chocolate but nothing about it said 'good cookie.' The quality of the treats that I tried where honestly grocery store quality to me and barely worth $5.\\n\\nThe space was very small, but nicely decorated (a lot if pink).

This occasion has left me with the decision to not return to Pink Pearl ever. \\nEverything was going very well till the bill came and we noticed that there may have been an accidental over charge. We know we only ordered and received 7 dishes but we're charged for 9. I asked very politely for the first manager to explain but he basically took the bill, glanced at it and proclaimed it correct. Ok, fast forward after almost 30 mins, 3 more different managers, literally a doz times rattling off what we actually ate vs the charges, managers numerously counting and examining empty dishes and plates (THAT was quite offencive in my opinion) and sometime in there (near the beginning) we realized one of the dim sum cart ladies triple stamped when it should have been only once, the last manager finally revised the bill very reluctantly and as if she was doing US a favour! (Don't ya just hate that?) We were kinda shocked how much they defended their position even when they couldn't deny there was ACTUALLY an error. Thus was not a couple-of-bucks-it's-just-the-principle thing. It was a more than $10 over charge and an experience that NO patron should ever be subjected to.

We were in Boulder early and we know there are sometimes open tables if you arrive as they open. We got there at 5:00, they don't open until 5:30. Someone saw us and told us to come back and they would have a table for us. They were more than accommodating. The service at Frasca is impeccable. Our waiter was the nicest guy ever. We were given a bit of white wine when we first sat, which was crisp and refreshing. Each item on the fixed priced 4 course menu is described with such tantalizing details we had a hard time choosing. We were brought a little preview appetizer of a delectable grouper cake (ball), a quarter size savory, crispy ravioli and a unique and delicious thimble of soup.  We were primed for our meal. The presentation of all 4 courses was really nice. The sizes are very small, but we knew this going in. The bread is excellent and they are generous with it. My antipasti course was the pork should with melon and bell pepper. The pork was formed into a square, interesting, but the taste and texture was that of canned meat. There were 3 little bits of pepper, and not sure where the melon was, maybe there was some bits in there, maybe it was in the sauce? There was some kind of fancy ground pepper on top that had a very strong flavor, like a smoky tequila, which did not meld well with the rest of the dish. My husband had prawns, head on, which is fine. When he pulled the head and shell off, black stuff glopped out. It was not deveined, because it was a whole shrimp, and maybe that is just the way it suppose to be, not sure, but it was not pleasant. I mentioned to the waiter that I didn't like my pork, and he was more than willing to bring something else, but I figured this was a one off thing. My next dish was Spaghetti with Peach, Sea Urchin and Red Onion. It was pretty good. I guess the sea urchin and peach was blended as the sauce, and there was not a lot of sauce, so it didn't have a real distinct flavor. My husband had the Octopus, Caper and Tomato Capatelli. His first bite had something gritty in it, which turned him off. When I tried his I thought it was pretty good, though there were only a couple of small pieces of octopus The capers were really good. We weren't planning on saying anything to the staff, because at this point we really didn't want to complain again. The person that delivered the food noticed that we switched, so we ended up telling them why. Next came the lamb with eggplant and green beans for hubby, and the quail with summer squash, lobster mushrooms and fingerling potatoes. The lamb dish was pretty good, with the exception of the eggplant, which was so bitter we felt like we needed to rub our tongues with a napkin. The quail was good, it sat on top of 3 little corners of squash and few pieces of under cooked potatoes and I don't recall any mushrooms.  Then dessert, I really liked my Panna Cotta with peaches. Very creamy and delicious. My husband hated his dessert, Pluot, Lavender, Lemon, Bee Pollen and Apricot Sorbe. It very sour, and not much sweet. We are maintaining our sense of humor throughout this meal, because it was not a special occasion for us and we are at a point in our lives where the money is not such a big deal.  I am sure I would have been greatly disappointed if this dinner was a special celebration, like it is for most people that dine at Frasca. Our waiter gave us a discount on our meal, which was really nice. He handled it very professionally. It was a weird position to be in. We were constantly checked on by all the staff, but it is really hard to tell people that are so nice that your $75 meal isn't good. I was planning on just emailing this directly to Frasca, but I couldn't find an email option on their website. So, I decided to post this on Yelp, because I think Frasca does need this feedback. I know they will take this feedback into consideration, because they are obviously working really hard to create an amazing dining experience.  I've been telling people for years that Frasca is the best restaurant in Boulder, I would like to be able to say that again.

Since the reservation was on the early side for dinner, I could understand that perhaps the bartender was finishing off happy hour with some favorite metal tracks, but it was LOUD, and continuous. Since we were dining with a party spanning multiple generations (including some older folks with less-than perfect hearing) we asked our server if the music could be turned down (we were literally shouting across the table to each other to be heard/attempt conversations.) The server seemed as though she would possibly like to accomodate us but didn't think she could, or just wasn't able to. She sort of winced and said something that I couldn't hear over the music. About three quarters of the way through our meal the music was changed to something a little more easy to dine/converse over. I'm young, I don't mind some abrasive music in my eating/drinking establishments now and again. But in a party consisting of half non-Portlanders who were highly anticipating the meal, the music put a huge damper on the meal. The fact that the server was unable or unwilling to accomodate our needs for a lower volume didn't really give a great impression to anyone in the party.

The second time I went in by myself. This time I was given the salsa with chips (Ah, yes, chips...that would have helped the first time around). I had the black bean burger but I don't think my server knew what that was. I asked him if the burger was made in-house or if it was a frozen patty, and he told me, \\"well, they are frozen here, but not kept frozen for very long.\\" I wasn't even sure what that meant, and I was starving, so I went ahead and ordered it.

We notified the host that we were on a extremely tight schedule and they were so accommodating.\\n\\nLocated inside the Animal Kingdom Lodge, the setting is beautiful, lightly dimmed and extremely romantic. We dined at the California Grill a couple of nights before and  Jiko exceeded California Grill in every aspect, hands down. Since it's a little out of the way for those around the Magic Kingdom and not nearly as popular as California Grill, Jiko was rather quiet, spacious, and calm as opposed to the abundance of people, kids, and ruckus at CG. \\n\\nOur server was courteous, knowledgeable, and quick to meet our rushed demands. We were celebrating our anniversary and she gave us a card as well as a glass of champagne. Very nice touch! \\n\\nAs our server noted, Jiko is a blend of African and Asian flavors with European style execution and you could taste and see each characteristic in the food. The bread basket was a great starter. My boyfriend usually steers clear of bread baskets but we ended up fighting for the last piece of bread. For appetizers, we ordered the flat bread and the crispy rolls - delicious and highly recommended. The crispy rolls were my favorite - very similar in flavor to samosas but with a tzatziki sauce so it was more light and refreshing. \\n\\nI had the duck breast and my boyfriend had the pork tenderloin. The meats were cooked perfectly, not overcooked like my fish at California Grill. Paired with the excellent wine recommendation, it was a great meal from beginning to end. My only complaint is that I hadn't given myself more time to thoroughly enjoy the food and the atmosphere. \\n\\nWe dined at California Grill, Narcoosee's, and La Hacienda at Epcot and while those were all great in their own right, Jiko is definitely THE best place for a couple to celebrate their something special.

At this point, did we have menus to even order from? No. Waiter comes by, \\"the kitchen closes in 10 minutes, you need to order.\\" Did we have menus at this point: no.

I had beef tongue (good), octopus (overcooked), raviolis with a creative mix of organ meats (good, but they brought me the wrong size)...and everything was overpriced for what you got.\\n\\nThe late-night menu looked intriguing, though.

At a whopping $13.. you would expect it to be pretty good and food coma inducing, and I normally order this dish every once in a while when I'm not in the mood for ground beef, or tortillas. It's an easy dish.. I could easily have made at home (See Rick Bayless salsa Mac n Cheese), but it just comes down to laziness. \\n\\nHowever, during this past trip something was off. I ate two bites and could tell something was majorly wrong. \\n\\nFirst off it was extremely watery... close to the consistency of soup. The Cheese is normally on the thicker side, but this was as if the noodles had not been properly drained. \\n\\nSecondly... There were these mystery stems and twigs in my dish. I get it.. probably from the peppers, but it killed it. I could have handled one, but it was multiple. Their prep team needs to keep a better eye out. \\n\\nLastly.. The dish tasted bad. It tasted like old seafood. I sent it back after two bites with my appetite gone... my husband grabbed a box and we left. \\n\\nNot even two minutes out the door I was running to a fast food joint for the restroom. I could only imaging what would have happened if I had eaten that entire dish.\\n\\nIt's not all terrible .. the server was prompt in letting the manager know, and the manager was quick to come over to us and compensate us with a gift card for a return visit.

Fortunately the dishes are cheap enough ($4 or $5 each) so that you can order a few things without breaking the bank.

I finally made it to Ah-Ma's today, and I was not disappointed.  \\n\\nI wanted to try almost everything on the menu.  I say almost because I don't eat a lot of seafood and the only dishes I didn't immediately want were the ones that included shrimp.  My lunch buddy is a non-meat eater, so we ordered separately.  I ordered the sticky rice, salt and pepper chicken, pork belly bao, and dirty bird bao.  There was no method to my order; I picked the first two items on the starter and bao menus.  \\n\\nMy friend ordered the pickled veggies and once I got a taste of them, I had to stop because I would have eaten them all.  One veggie was a spicy pickled cucumber and the other was a sweeter pickled carrot.  I loved them, and I only had two small bites of them.  My friend also ordered the tofu and shrimp baos; she preferred the shrimp, and I have to say that it was a pretty little bun.\\n\\nAfter my first bite of the salt and pepper chicken, I did my \\"happy food dance.\\"  I loved the crunch and seasoning; however, it's really salty.  That being said...  all chicken nuggets should be like this.\\n\\nThe steamed buns were cooked perfectly.  I enjoyed them both with a preference for the pork belly; however, I was wishing for hoisin sauce (sweet and salty) instead of the salty, savory sauce and dressings used. This is a matter of taste in that I prefer my pork belly with a little sweet to balance the salt.  \\n\\nThe sticky rice had a much more subtle flavor than everything else so it left the least impression.  The mix of items was tasty, but not as taste bud exploding as the pickled, seasoned items.  Also, I was apprehensive about it because I don't like shrimp, but with all the ingredients mixed together the shrimp didn't make much of an impact, so I was able to eat a good bit of it.  \\n\\nAs a note, although these are small plates, you can share them. I struggled to eat my food because there was a lot of it.  The price vs. quality/quantity is better than average at Ah-Ma's.  \\n\\nI also have to say how prettily everything is presented.  It tastes good AND it looks too pretty eat.  I almost hated to put my grubby little fingers on the steamed buns because they looked so perfect, but I did.  Kudos to their kitchen for turning out beautifully prepared food so quickly.  \\n\\nService was great and easy.  The wait was 20 minutes, but I expected that because of the size.  \\n\\nAh-Ma's closes at 3PM after lunch before opening again at 5PM for dinner.  I don't blame them for doing that.

Via Napoli hands down gets my vote as the best pizza I've ever had. If you're expecting a big NY slice or a deep dish cheesy Chicago style pizza you won't be happy. This is the real Italian deal. I've not been to Naples but have had pizza in the areas surrounding and the pizza at Via Napoli is just like eating it in Rome. I typically go for the very simple Pizza Margherita but their white pizzas are stunning too. The Carciofi pizza is so rich that I can only manage 2 slices before calling it quits but it is a fantastic white pizza. 1 regular sized pizza is enough for 2 people with a very small appetite but when I go with friends we typically get our own and take home a slice since 3/4 of a pizza seems to be the amount we can eat without feeling stuffed.\\n\\nBeyond the pizzas, their Arancini is outstanding with their fantastic marinara sauce on the side. For beverages, thei Acqua Frescas is outstanding and refreshing. It's pricey but worth it, Via Napoli is also home to one of my favorite desserts anywhere in the world: Gelato Frizzante. It's basically an ice cream float but the quality of the ingredients are so fresh and vibrant that I savor ever mouth/sip of it. It's the perfect dessert on a hot Florida day.\\n\\nThe dining room itself is a stunner and probably the most beautiful at Disney World, except for maybe The Living Seas restaurant (which has horrible food). Don't forget to look up at vaulted painted ceilings. It makes it hard to believe you're not in Italy!\\n\\nVia Napoli is such a favorite that my friends and I will just meet up at Epcot in the evening (we're all annual passholders) just to go to Via Napoli. They are usually booked up so reserve weeks ahead of time but if you go right when they start seating for dinner (4pm) or around Illumninations (before 9pm) they can usually squeeze you in."},{"name":"Jason's Deli","address":"1122 Gemini Pl","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"After driving past this establishment for a long time I decided to go with my family for dinner.

While I was riding my bike down S. Congress today I passed by not one, not two, but three crepe carts. How fortuitous! The food gods were speaking to me. But since when did crepes become the new cupcakes? Maybe I'm just behind the times. I stopped here because it's right next to the puppy adoption trailer.\\n\\nAt first I was leaning towards the panang curry crepe because that sounded really interesting, but ultimately the pork floss won me over because that sounded even more intriguing. I'd never even heard of pork thread before. The pork is dried so it's a bit tough but the flavor is amazing. The filling is light, really just a condiment for the crepe itself. Super soft and slightly spongy, in my humble opinion, these crepes are near perfect. They are also huge. But hopped on the satisfaction of feeding a week-long craving I indulged in a sweet crepe for desert. The mango/sticky rice crepe was good but not spectacular. The mango was under-ripe and sour so I think that was the problem. But the slightly-sweet sticky rice with peanut butter (I think that's what it was) was interesting. \\n\\nI like crepes because they're less greasy than tacos and way more fashionable than gyros. And it's easier to get away with bastardizing French food, which the owners here have taken to the extreme. But that's definitely not a bad thing.

I was really disappointed, since some of the other dishes did look better.  \\n\\nThis duck canneloni could have been a success with the addition of some prominent spices or herbs. I don't know why the duck tasted so bland and not like duck. \\n\\nI also tried a bit of the pasta di quattro (the one listed as 101 things to eat in Vancouver before dying). It was alright. It wasn't my favorite. Definitely had more flavour than the canneloni. But it's not my favorite. I think that is personal preference though--I feel like I've made something like that at home before. \\n\\nAll in all, the bread was my favorite part of the meal.  I think the next time I'd get the handmade pasta or the pasta with mushrooms.  Those looked amazing.  \\n\\nMy meal: Salad + Pasta + wine + tax & 18% gratuity = $34.00\\n\\nThe ambience was very nice for a date or something. The desserts sounded good, so maybe next time.

First stop, Komi Sushi. This place is far better than the reviews suggest. Sure, we didn't go during prime rush hour, which seems to be the reason why people dislike the service, nor did we order pho or ramen since this is a sushi place. \\n\\nAnyway, we ordered sashimi, nigiri, and maki... Two of the huge party platters, for 6 people. I'm torn because the sashimi and nigiri were excellent. The maki rolls were just alright, though, likely because they added honey mustard and Sriracha to the ones that came on the platter... Big no no! All that to say, I would absolutely go back with all this in mind. \\n\\nOur service was excellent, granted it was very quiet. The cost was very reasonable... Who can truly say they leave a sushi spot full having spent only $25 with tax and tip! (I can!!!)  Most importantly, the fish tasted very fresh.

I noticed that they have this genius batter for their fried foods, but it is devoid of flavor.  The fries/chips are very generic and bad. Today I got the burger. It was not a good one.  No seasoning, cooked more on one side than the other and served on an English muffin?!?! Wtf?!?! The onion rings were wondrous but alas not seasoned.  I want to like this place but it is across the board about 3-5$ more than it should be. Maybe I should rant about Atlantic station, but i firmly stand by my food comments for this place.

So this one is actually pretty decent, viet owned with a large selection, spotlighting seafood and dim sum items. It's gone a little down hill since it first opened but I was still fairly content with it. Also it's relatively clean and well kept, another plus. I would rather go here than shitty Todai anyday. The food here is decently seasoned and siracha is out available for use. In terms of dim sum, they have XL dumplings and for those that don't know, that's the soup dumplings. You kinda have to handle these delicately when taking one off the tray because they tear easily and you lose all the broth from within. Bummer. The XL dumplings are pretty decent though. \\n\\nIn the mood for some Chinese buffet action, this is a good pick for the west side.

The only thing we did not enjoy was the octopus appetizer- it was very sour and we sent it back.  I had their filet mignon, and it was even better than Artist Point!

Having eaten many a katsu in Japan I can attest to the general authenticness of the dish. Honestly it isn't entirely like a Japanese version of the meal, but I think it's better because it is has the basic Japanese components with a little northwest style thrown in with all the colorful and fresh greens. The dish is a perfect meal for summer when you crave meat as it has both hot (meat) and cool (salad) components.\\n\\nI'll definitely be coming back here a few times before the long lines start forming.\\n\\nOh yeah and they even have a dart board, but I'm not sure if you can borrow darts or if you have to bring your own."},{"name":"Sabrozon Fresh Mexican Restaurant & Catering","address":"17770 Pilkington Rd","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"4.5","text":"It was so so.

Seriously, gorgeous, stunning architecture! I LOVE the entire design... I really feel like I stumbled out of the real world and into the Beast's Castle.... \\n\\nTIP: This restaurant is fairly easy to get into if you have flexible plans.  Disney has a great app that lets you search and book easily.  The trick is to book exactly 180 days in advance OR check a few times a day, daily, the week before you are planning on going.  Reservations have to be cancelled at least 24 hours in advance or you are subject to a fee-- so a lot of people will drop their reservation during this time.  \\n\\nMy husband and I had a 5:30 reservation, so we checked in at the host stand near the entrance to the \\"mountain\\".  Here, we requested the main dining room.  (previously we've dined in the West Wing and the Rose Gallery).  They took my cell phone number and asked us to head to the castle and wait near the large castle doors.  There was plenty of seating and serve yourself ice water outside.  \\n\\nRight on time, someone came out and called our party name.  They walked us inside and and led us to our table after she explained the 3 different rooms, as well as where the Beast would be receiving his guests for photos.\\n\\nThe main dining room did not disappoint.  It gives you the impression it is nighttime, all the time, as the gorgeous windows are your eyes to the dimly lit outside...complete with snow falling...thats right, snow!  We had a fabulous server named Paula.  I told her this was our 5th time here, and we always get too full for dessert, so we were going to share an app, do soups and dessert.  We ordered the cheese and charcuterie board to start, as well as the potato leek soup and french onion soup.  She said she would put in the app first since the tables were kind of small.\\n\\nWe got our cheese and meats plate..and honestly everything was good, but it was rather small for the $17.00 price tag. They also served a bread basket with fresh butter during this time.\\n\\nIf you dine here, you have to visit all fo the rooms..they encourage everyone to walk around and explore!  We walked into the West Wing(which is my favorite after dining in all 3) and stayed for some thunder and watched the rose petals fall... it is SO cool.  Make sure you watch the torn photo of the prince/beast for a few minutes... it has a neat surprise.  The rose gallery is impressive as well, with some larger tables for bigger groups.\\n\\nOur soups came out and were fabulous as always.  The potato leek soup is honestly the main reason I come here.  Its SO delicious and they serve it during lunch time too.  \\n\\nFinally, the brought around the dessert cart with all of the desserts-- Ive only ever had the \\"Grey Stuff\\" and its my favorite... like a cookies and creme mousse on a tart.  Im not a huge fan of the tart part, but the creme is delicious!  Since we were celebrating my birthday, the server brought out a bit of grey stuff with a candle and a card signed by the Beast and Belle. So cute!!\\n\\nMy server was super personable and talked my husband into going to Hoop-De-Doo Revue later on this year with me :) \\n\\nThe Beast walks through the dining room about twice an hour....and let me tell you...its like a celebrity walking through. Everyone cheers.  Its so exciting(and Im an adult!!).\\n\\nI don't have any kids yet myself, but just the looks on the children's faces are worth the price of this restaurant.

They did not have anything available when we first walked up, but when we checked back ten minutes later they invited us inside. The place does look beautiful, and you walk across a stone bridge to enter Beast's castle. The decorating is magnificent inside, and waiting in the hallway by the suits of armor can be very entertaining. You make your food selections at a kiosk (or online) from a limited menu. The dining rooms are magnificent, decorated to the nines to emulate scenes from Beauty and the Beast. There is the main Ballroom, a \\"Music Box\\" room, and the Beast room, the last being a little dark but the most imagineered.

A basket of pastries was also brought to the table. One of the selling points of this place is that it is the only place in the Magic Kingdom that serves beer and wine. I was disappointed to find out that they only did that for the dinner service only. I don't need a beer with breakfast, but I thought they might offer mimosas or bloody marys.

I actually spent my birthday here and made reservations in advance. My mom and I stayed at the Animal Kingdom Lodge, so we walked down around our actual reservation time and were seated right away. We chatted with our hostess for a moment, who was from South Africa and had only been working for a few weeks; she was so sweet and it was nice to engage a little with her as she seemed slightly homesick. Our waiter was prompt and attentive, and we really liked him until he poured our wine...\\n\\nSo, here's my issue with Jiko and why I can't give it five stars. This is arguably one of the nicer restaurants in Disney and of course it has the price tags to match. There is an extensive wine list and I was excited to try many wines that aren't readily available outside of South Africa. I ordered a pinotage and my mom asked for a \\"buttery\\" chardonnay. We're aware that that isn't really a South African thing, but the waiter said he had one in mind. When he brought it out for her to try, it was basically the opposite of buttery and instead tasted like an unoaked chardonnay. As it was not her preference, she switched it up and ordered something different. Anyway, to the point, when we settled on the two wines we wanted, he poured... and stopped SO SHORT of what I would consider to be a normal restaurant pour. I thought it looked light, but I was sort of taken aback... our waiter then walked off, and I just sat there a little dumbfounded. My mom even asked him about it and he said that was standard. I looked at other tables and saw their wine glasses were definitely more full (even after drinking!) so I was irritated by that. I don't think it's right to have a light pour of a $16 glass of wine. Ridiculous.\\n\\nApart from that, of course the food was delicious. I had the beef short rib while my mom had the buffalo rib-eye. I told our waiter I didn't like carrots, and he subbed those out from the short rib dish for brussels spouts, which was a nice substitution.

I never would wear that if I'm going out. It was random and my friend wanted to take me here. Of course I do not encourage wearing such things in a nice place such as this and save that attire going to a dive bar or other casual establishments.\\n\\nI ordered the Thai Iced Coffee which I haven't had in awhile and it hit the spot. Then we ordered the appetizers Todmun and Chicken Satay. Todmun was a deep fried fish cakes with green beans, curry but you can cancel the super spicy with cucumbers and sweet and sour sauce. \\n\\nI've learned that if you eat something spicy and it's something you can't handle - never drink water. Find a sugar packet and put that in your mouth.\\n\\nThe chicken satay was tender and peanut sauce so good. It wasn't like peanut butter like other Thai places would serve.\\n\\nMain course was the Pad Thai which is much more filling and the Pasta Basil which was super spicy and let my friend have that one. I like a little spicy and I can't handle spicy to the point that my lips and taste buds go numb.\\n\\nFor dessert - I had sticky rice and mango along with coconut ice cream. I was real hesitant on sticky rice and mango because I never would think of sticky rice as a dessert. This dessert made me a believer of how good it can be.

Go for just one small plate and you will feel perfectly satisfied. Can't decide between the tagliatelle bolognese and the saffron risotto with garlicky shrimp?

This places works out great for a number of reasons. 1) With having to take my lunch hour usually around 7 or 8pm, I have never had to fight any sort of dinner crowd creating a longer wait for my food. The times I've went, I've never seen more than 2 cars outside and 5 people total inside. 2) They have drive thru. Currently their intercom is \\"out of service\\" so I have to drive up to the window and push a small white button that is attached to a piece of wood sticking out to call for service. 3) Their slow service inside results in servicing me quickly. I can roll through, order 5-6 tacos, and they area ready faster than anything I've ever seen. 4) Their food is just damn good. I usually get either chicken tacos or tacos al pastor, and they never disappoint. Plus they pack the necessities w/to go orders. Both red & green salsas, AND LIMES!!! I've done alot of togo orders at different places, and this is the first that automatically puts limes along w/your order. No need to ask, they are like Nike, they JUST DO IT     5) Their prices ROCK. They are not overpriced like alot of the mexican places here in Austin are. These people keep it real, being real cheap. I took my dad & bro to eat at a different location, and they thought there was a mixup and only charged for 2 people instead of 3. So yes, I've gone w/a $5 bill, and come out w/a hefty meal and change to go along w/it. Can't say that about too many places these days. 6) THeir menu is longer than some Harry Potter novels, w/so many choices to choose from. I mostly get either tacos or enchiladas, which are both good in my book. But a friend of mine has had their burrito, nopales, and other items, all to which he enjoyed as well.

Seriously I love this place, its a bit out of the way but oh so worth it. Great deals across the board but I really cant talk about their menu. I order the same thing every time : Breakfast special, brown, poached medium, sausage.... BOO YA. First off I really have to say I am a connoisseur of poached eggs and i cant stand when they are poached in a pot of water with vinegar, also medium doesn't mean give me soggy white uncooked embryo. They don't do either. Such a happy place mostly filled with people who haven't slept coming from a rave , long night of explicit drugs etc etc. Bon is a great fellow who does more than his share, and for the life of me i cant remember his name but the guy with the coin dispenser and what looks like a navy uniform is probably the happiest guy I have ever met in my life. I mean really, he doesn't work there, I hope to God he gets his meals comped even though they cost 3 bucks. He just chats you up chipper as a frog in heat and pours you coffee (which I don't drink but keep a cup handy to give to those who are with me just because I love the ole bastard). Well ranting as I do all being said Bons off Broadway is awesome. \\nFood= Good - Hearty Servings \\nPrice= If you and your 40 children came for breakfast it would only cost 140 bucks and that's only because ya better tip (Dammit people sometimes the service might seem bad but this place can turn over 100 people an hour easy) \\nService= See above... and a great attitude \\nIf you haven't been to Bons you had better. My best advice would be go on a weekday or Sunday at 9:30 because anything else and you will be standing up the block for a table (Which in my opinion is still worth it)."},{"name":"Pho Huy","address":"2755 Lougheed Highway, Suite 22","city":"Port Coquitlam","stars":"4","text":"Another cold wet day in the Lower Mainland and was craving something warm and comforting but didn't want to venture too far.

We were sat right away by the window and perused their lengthy menu.  I was going to have a Bun (vermicelli with different types of grilled meats) but I decided to go for their house Pho as this is my first time and wanted to see how they compare to the other Pho places.  (Side note: there's more Pho places than other Asian inspired restaurants in the Lower Mainland).  By the way, we got a free shrimp fresh roll for ordering a certain amount of food (Bonus!) \\nMy House Special Pho came right away. I was struck by the clearness of the broth and the amazing star anise (probably from the five spice) aroma.  I immediately dunked the raw beef and added a fresh Thai basil leaf, slice of jalapeno and squeezed lime to the beautiful clear broth.  My first large spoonful of broth didn't disappoint.  It felt like a big hug under a giant umbrella on a rainy Sunday!  The noodles were done just right; not too soft as I slurped it with that amazing broth.  The beef ball also had that distinct five spice taste while the tripe (a.k.a. Pho car wash) gave the dish texture.

Now, I have to back up and say that I've had other good experiences at the various locations around Austin. You will almost always find that the Burnet road location has very limited available parking. I went with a friend and her husband on a Friday night. We waited at the bar and got their classic Mexican Martinis. Took it to our table once it was ready, and the server's first question was \\"how many martinis is this for you? because i can find out\\" in quite a snippy tone. (For those who are unaware/living under a rock, Trudy's limits each diner to 2 Mexican Martinis because of the liquor content.) As I told my friends, he cut his tip in half in under a minute! Once ready to order, i chose the migas, but asked for them without jalape√±os (what can i say, i don't care for spicy!) and again the server endeared me to him by saying, \\"Well, it's an extra dollar to make them special, because they have to make a separate batch just for your food.\\" I said that i didn't mind, because i remembered their jalape√±os burning my mouth on a previous visit. Other than our food taking quite a while to be prepared, it seemed to taste good, and the chips, salsa and martinis helped tide us over until it arrived. Oh, did I speak too soon! Halfway through my meal, i started to feel very bad. Went to the restroom and thought i was going to be sick. Won't go into the gory details, but i couldn't eat or drink any more. took my food to-go, paid, and left with my friends. I was still feeling nauseous, and before we could even get out of the parking lot, we had to pull over so i could be sick. Twice. Once the migas evacuated my stomach, i pretty much felt fine. Got home and threw away my leftovers. In my opinion, i had food poisoning, and would guess that the eggs in the migas weren't cooked properly. Yes, I know, I should have let a manager know...but the whole experience left me with a bad taste in my mouth, no pun intended. \\nP.S.

The scene is a bit mature and the majority of the people looked to be late 20s and above - mostly 30-40s from what I've seen. Definitely not for younger crowds looking to rage and die of alcohol poisoning. It's right next to the Rogers Stadium and there is a casino in the same building as well. \\n\\nPros - the outdoor area was really well-designed with lots of great lighting and areas to sit and mingle. The crowd was sort of keeping to themselves and didn't bother anyone nearby or cause any scenes. No one looked completely drunk and causing trouble.\\n\\nCons - we were able to get in for free through a friend but I imagine the cover would be slightly higher than normal.

There are readily evident weaknesses in Buffet Palace's  offerings -- In theory, their trays devoted to steamed squid, sans any breading, is the stuff of legency; in reality, in try after try after try, the texture of their squid is decidedly 'off', which can only be attributed to age and quality.

Speaking of the menu, if you just walk in and order off the large menu boards, you are actually missing out on a large portion of what they offer. We had stared at the boards for several minutes and almost made a decision, when one of the associates came over and handed us the paper menus. Ultimately we chose items that were on the board, but it was nice to know there was a lot more. I guess the board is a \\"favorites\\" list, so it makes sense we were happy with what we found there.\\n\\nSo, I went with a half sandwich and cup of soup. This option comes with chips. I got the Santa Fe Chicken Sandwich and the Chicken Pot Pie soup. The sandwich was very good. I really liked the thousand island dressing on it. The Chicken Pot Pie soup comes with a small puff pastry on top to simulate the crust of a pie. It was a little difficult to figure out how to eat it, because it was too big for one bite, but I couldn't really break it up with my spoon. I ended up pulling it out and eating it with my hands! Anyway, the soup was fantastic!\\n\\nI also enjoyed some of the free soft-serve ice cream. They have chocolate, vanilla, or swirl, and you can put chocolate fudge on top. That was a nice little treat.\\n\\nSo, to sum up, ordering off the menu really redeemed Jason's for me after not really being impressed with the salad bar."},{"name":"FINO Restaurant Patio & Bar","address":"2905 San Gabriel St, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I was invited to dine at Fino for a friend's birthday. With a party of five, we were seated in a prompt manner but that was expected with reservations made. Take in to account: this place serves tapas. Now, with a party of five, being a birthday dinner with the bill not being a factor, we decided to try all of their tapas, a small plate, and the seafood paella. All of the tapas were great except for the marcona almonds. Not that the almonds were tasty, but four dollars for a very very small portion was kind of a rip off. The highlight of the tapas were the beef and pork panchitos. The duck confit cigars were excellent and the sliders juicy and cooked perfectly. However, expect to wait about 20-25 minutes for the seafood paella but they will serve you when orders are ready to encourage sharing so you'll be munching and before you know it, the paella will be infront of you.\\n\\nThe service was excellent. The waitor was friendly, witty, and very approachable. He even took the liberty of recommending that we skip Fino's dessert since my friend's mom mentioned that she made a cake for her son at home.\\n\\nThe ambiance was very hip, modern, and oriented for younger Austinites. On the other side, the dining spaces are small and can become somewhat crowded for bigger parties.\\n\\nOverall, Fino's was a good experience.

Outdoor tables cluttering the sidewalk at the first sign of sunshine after a too-long winter? Love it. Cute girls in fancy dresses on bicycles? Enchanting. Nice people who greet you on the street and remember you on return visits to cafes/bars/what have you? Warms my heart. That's why Beulahland is my default bar. It's comfortable with several booths and tables, busy enough for entertaining people watching (every other Friday ska night spectacle does not disappoint), and damn it, people are nice there. Sometimes it feels like a communal living room, with movie nights and music video nights and pub quiz and dance nights. And the drinks are cheap with a selection that seems to rotate with the season (really great hot drinks in winter, iced-tea-lemonade-related drinks in the summer...). I haven't been for a meal, but I vouch for the hummus plate when you're in the too-much-beer danger zone.

I hate to feel like I'm inconveniencing the busy staff by asking for anything additional like steamed milk on the side because we just felt like they were rushed and were agitated with requests for our milk steamed on the side with our high tea. The food is still cute and charming as it was a couple years ago when they first started. We opted for the grand tea service (there is a demo tea service which is a half order style tier from the grand service). The grand tea service comes with unlimited pots of tea which is great to try new flavours during your service. A tea seating is the standard 90 minutes and there is also a great little feature for little tea go-ers with the child tea tea menu which features more basic fare for the little one's taste palettes from the more complex flavours on the adult tea service.

They try to be all fancy but serve poor quality items. \\n2) I didn't go back until a few years later (again, just for the great view) hoping it would be better. It was brunch and I ordered a bloody mary. Worst Bloody Mary ever. Very watered down tomato mix and NO garnish. No celery, not even an olive or a lemon. What's fancy about that? My scrambled eggs were overcooked and so salty I could not eat them. Home fries were burnt black. Bacon was not cooked enough, really chewy and undercooked. The only thing edible was the toast, but they forgot to give me a side of butter. I've had better breakfast at Denny's.  The WORST part of all was that my server never came by to ask me how things were. When I got the bill and told her things were 'not as good as they could have been' she said \\"Well I'll just shoot the chef.\\" ????? WTF? I left no tip and vowed never to go back. \\n#3 a group of friends wanted to do brunch and saw Spice while walking and wanted to go in. I told them the food was not good but I was outnumbered. My croissant tasted like freezer burn. Service was slow. MENU LIES! BAIT AND SWITCH!!!! On the menu they offer a brunch special: buy one Mimosa/Bloody Mary and get one free. But it's a LIE. I ordered one mimosa and after I drank it they brought me another. BUT when the bill came I was charged for two. I reminded the server that the menu, in clear print, says buy one, get one free. She said, yeah they changed that because it was encouraging people to drink too much. People just want one but are getting two so they changed it.  WTF?? I heldfast and told her they have to value it because it's printed clearly on the menu, and she argued that no they stopped doing that. I told her I ordered the 2nd Mimosa because the menu suggested it would be no extra charge. She said no, they're just half off now. So apparently they charge $7 for a crappy mimosa! \\nBottom line: They are overpriced for what they offer and can barely cook an egg. Rude service.

We were turned away completely!  That's right, \\"We cannot seat you, sir\\".  Half of the restaurant was empty.  No suggested wait of any length, no crowd of patrons waiting for a table, offered nothing but a seat at the bar for dinner? I can't explain it, I'm just passing it on.  I'd love to know why, but the moral of the story is that you'd better book a reservation here because apparently you have literally NO chance of getting a table otherwise.  We've walked in several times before with no wait, and it's not like they are in the all star \\"too busy for you\\" category just yet.  We went to 34th Street Cafe instead, where the food gods worked their magic on an unbelievable meal, but that's for my next review.  \\n\\nThat said, we like Fino.  Interesting food, great mixology behind the bar, and a couple of personal \\"bests\\".  The cheese plate offers my favorite cheese, Petit Basque, and my favorite meat, Serrano Ham, conveying it instant \\"Best\\" status. They have like 6 small salads on the menu, but they really just need two or three.  Their version of the typical \\"dinner\\" salad, with avocado and a parmesan crisp, was one of the best I've ever had for something like a \\"dinner\\" salad. They also had a butter lettuce with Marcona almonds and maybe manchego that was really innovative and really good, and when was the last time you said that about a salad?  Not sure but it might be on hiatus now.  My point is who needs six salads when you have two that are so tasty they are worth mentioning here?  In other words, I'll probably never get to salads #4-6 because the first ones are too good.  Not a bad problem to have as a restaurant.\\n\\nI like the paella, which they do really well, but I think the seafood version would be better than the \\"Hunter's\\" aka no seafood version I had.  A mix of both would be best, according to me and my aunt Nina from Seville.  They have a variety of small plate tapas that we've sampled, consistently demonstrating excellent flavor, balance and originality.  Bravo to the chef.\\n\\nThat leaves the drinks.  We came in late one evening for a drink at the bar (small) and the head mixologist, who could have given us the \\"we're about to close\\" treatment, instead provided a knowledgeable and entertaining insight into the variety of specialized booze they've got hanging about the place.  The Vieux Carre is outstanding, I can say I tried the chocolate bacon one and it did not suck, but more importantly, they know their way around a cocktail here.  \\n\\nSo that's why we like Fino.  If there are truly no tables for walk ins any more, then perhaps they are getting the recognition they deserve.  If not, get on over there and try some of their goodness before it's too late."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"3640 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I have heard so much about this place, so I finally had to try it. Between me and my three companions we decided to each get something different so we could share's first I thought they served just biscuits with bacon, chicken or sausage but they have a nice variety to choose from in case you are in the mood for something sweet or salty. We tried the Reggie, biscuits and gravy with sausage, biscuits and fruit, biscuit with jam and a sausage, egg and cheese biscuit. All of the food was amazing! The chicken on the Reggie was juicy, tender and tasted good with the egg and bacon. \\n\\nThe Belmont location only has about three tables so it is best to get the food to go instead of waiting around for one to open up.

When my coworkers and I talk about where we are going to have our Chinatown lunch outing this month - I always recommend Xinh Xinh! How could you not? \\n\\nBy far one of the most responsible restaurants in Chinatown to respect vegetarian wishes. When you order the Vegetarian Pho (one of the very few places that actually has veggie pho) they immediately ask you if you want Veggie Broth or Beef broth. You don't even have to tell them you are vegetarian! I love how on-top of it they are. \\n\\nAlso another bonus for vegetarians and even non-veggies alike is the lemongrass tofu. Soooo yum! If I could get this every week I would! I recommend getting it with the whole spring roll set up - so you can make your own spring rolls, you'll have enough food for leftovers believe me! I've also gotten the tofu hot pot - again delicious but it's mostly tofu, so if you're craving protein it's the way to go. Otherwise I would prefer less tofu and instead more veggies. \\n\\nMy friend recently got the lemongrass tofu vermicelli and she said it was one of the best meals she has ever had in Chinatown. And she's not even vegetarian. \\n\\nI have to admit their drinks are risky. I've ordered a few drinks just to try them - once the hot lemon something, which tasted like salt water. So be careful! If you want an authentic Vietnamese drink try it out, but you might not be as open-minded once it's served!   There veggie spring rolls aren't anything special though, so I would skip that and go straight to the meal.\\n\\nThey can't do many bubble teas vegan because the mixes are already premade but the mango and pineapple one can be made with coconut milk, and are very yummy! \\n\\nThe only complaint is that it gets really crowded during lunch time. The tables are pretty squashed together to seat everyone - if you come with a large group you might not get seated for awhile. Twice I have bumped my head hard because the tables are in weird positions like in corners with sharp edges.

Their anpan also happens to be the best I've found in the city, with generous, smooth, fillings and a touch of sesame on the outside of a big, fluffy, perfectly browned, bun.\\n\\nIchiban is most often compared with the much larger chinese bakery, Golden Delight, which is a few streets away.\\nTheir fresh strawberry cakes are on par with each other (Golden Delight has a bit of an edge there,) but I prefer Ichiban's other flavors, such as blueberry and mango, to Golden Delight's, which tend to be greasy. Ichiban's are lovely, subtle, and yet you can taste what flavor it is, rather than guessing from the color. \\n\\nComparing the cream cake rolls, I prefer Ichiban's for the following reasons:\\n1) I really like their rainbow roll cake, which includes slices of every flavor of cream roll they carry so I can try everything. (sometimes not available)\\n2) Ichiban's roll cakes have a greater cake to cream ratio than Golden Delights, which I prefer, \\n3) Golden Delight typically sells their cake rolls and slices of cake rolls frozen solid, requiring a person to thaw them out before eating, rather than Ichiban which sells them chilled and ready to eat. \\n\\nIchiban's pork steam buns are also amazing and perfect for a simple lunch or snack. They do not carry as many filling varieties as Golden Delight, but Ichiban's pork buns are still my favorite, stuffed to bursting and fluffy from the microwave. (they also tend to sell out quickly, so be warned)\\n\\nBecause it is such a tiny bakery, they often have a limited supply, so go early or call if you want something special. Take cash, since the $10 credit card limit would fill a huge bag with goodies, as everything is so cheap. I hope they find a new location so they aren't overshadowed by Belle's, but definitely stop in if you're in the area."},{"name":"Sugidama Soba & Izakaya","address":"260 Elm St, Ste 106","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"A japanese noodle shop that offers a good amount of variety.

Enter buywithme.com - woohoo!\\n\\nA friend from NYC had said she tried it and it was \\"good for Boston, run of the mill in NYC.\\"  Pfft!  Well, okay, except for her suggestion that NYC's food scene trumps Boston's (hey, we're trying here ok?), she was pretty much right on.\\n\\n1.  Atmosphere - REALLY lovely!  Quiet, calm, warm-enough, friendly service, lots of parking options.  Dining room isn't too big but also not cramped and the acoustics are great.\\n\\n2.  Menu - I could use some more options, and maaaaybe a little more food on my plate for the price, but those are my only complaints.  Oh wait - they only have 2 desserts listed on the menu, and they were out of one (the pumpkin custard).  That's a little rough, especially when your only other dessert is \\"Durian custard\\", which is basically a bed of flavored rice with a little durian (extremely fragrant) cream on top.  It was weird - fine - we at the whole thing - but plan to go elsewhere for dessert.  Oh!  One cool thing though is that instead of a bread basket you get little sticks of pepper and celery with a chive dipping sauce.  It was super good...I just wish there had been more...seeing a trend here?\\n\\n3.  Food - My friend had the arugula salad and the eggplant pasta.  I had the tiger shrimp appetizer and the duck breast.  She loves the arugula salad, and while she wasn't a huge fan of the sogginess of the eggplant, the pasta was excellent!  I tried it too and completely agree - mmmmm great flavors and perfect texture.  My shrimp was awesome, though 1 more would have made it better (there were 4), and the duck breast was tasty.  The fat on the duck was a gross texture so while I understand why they left it on for flavor in cooking, I don't really get why they didn't cut it off for plating...but I don't eat duck that much so who knows.  The flavor was great, but I would have loved for it to come with some kind of vegetable.  It was just duck with a topping on a bed of what I think were passion fruit chunks.  Delicious, but a little lacking.\\n\\n4.  Price - Pretty decent.  A little more food would have been good as I've mentioned (a few times, eh?), but for an app, entree, tea, and half a dessert I think my total came to about $25 or so?  \\n\\nI'd say try it - you could love it, or it could be a place you're glad you went and may or may not return."},{"name":"Mike and Lill's Black Sheep Pub & Grill","address":"5 Central St, the other day","city":"Peabody","stars":"4","text":"I've gotta say, I really want the Black Sheep to succeed!  I just moved around the corner from this place right around the same time it opened.  It clearly has a lot going for it, and clearly is owned by people with good taste, though there are a few things I would encourage the owners to improve upon to get my business (and others' business) on a more frequent basis.  \\n\\nI can't complain about the ambiance - fairly basic with a touch of off-beat elegance; there is a clearly defined \\"black sheep\\" theme that can be seen in the black-painted woodwork, the quirky artwork on the walls, and the general eclectic modern-meets-old-fashioned style of the place.  Kind of reminds me of the Fat Cat in Quincy, which has a similar type of feel/theme, similar menu, and similar attention to detail.  Makes me wonder if the two are in any way affiliated, or if maybe the Black Sheep was inspired by the Fat Cat.  I also can't complain about the service - I've been served just fine both times I've been here, despite whatever growing pains this new place might be experiencing.  Granted, the place was fairly empty both times I've been here, which is a shame considering what it has going for it.\\n\\nThe food here is delicious for the most part, and the beer selection is decent.  That being said, you get good quality on both fronts, but at the same time, even for what it is, most things seem to be priced about 1 or 2 bucks higher than what you would expect for this area.  For example, beers seem to run $6.50 or $7.00 per draft, even for the more commonplace micro brews - prices you might expect in downtown Boston, but not so in downtown Peabody, which isn't really a major destination with it's limited parking and general lack of much else worth visiting.\\n\\nHonestly, food alone, I'd give this place 4 to 5 stars.  For appetizers, I've had the stuffed quahogs, a favorite food of mine, and they were very tasty, though they seemed a little steep at 10+ bucks for 2 not-so-huge pieces.  Another time, I had some kind of Greek/Mediterranean meatball thing that was also delicious but again, a little steep for the small portion.\\n\\nThe sandwiches that my girlfriend and I have had here were a decent value for the level of quality and preparation that went into them - they make a Reuben, I recall, that rivals any other place in the area that I can think of.  When it comes to other things, I've tried the prime rib, which was nicely cooked and very juicy, though a little bit on the smaller size for $19, compared to prime rib I've had elsewhere.  Nevertheless, it was decent quality (like most other things I've had here) and the mashed potatoes and butternut squash tasted just like mom makes 'em (a good thing).  Comfort food is prevalent on the menu here, as this is the type of place that takes that concept and raises it to a higher level.\\n\\nMy girlfriend ordered the mac and cheese with steak tips last time, and the steak tips that I ate (as leftovers!) were AMAZING - really juicy even after re-heating in the microwave and as tender as they get!  The downside: the mac and cheese itself might be worth the chef's revisiting the recipe; even when it was first served, the cheese ran overly thick, and this thickness could not be even remotely returned to a creamy state as reheated leftovers.  I'm sure that quality cheese went into the stuff, but the texture was just way overly prone to congealing and my girlfriend wasn't able to eat more than a couple bites (it was like trying to eat butter with pasta stuck in it).  I would recommend the chefs looking at the aforementioned Fat Cat restaurant's mac and cheese, which is central (and very popular) in their similar menu.\\n\\nOverall, it's a great place that's worth a try - a place that has an eye on quality and style, despite it's foundation on simplicity and comfort/pub food.  The prices are slightly high, which may not exactly fit the local demographics and may ultimately limit the amount of business they might otherwise be able to bring in.  Still, I have no doubt that this place is on the right track with their concept, and they will surely iron out some of their kinks and hopefully be successful in the long run!"},{"name":"Villa Mexico","address":"296 Cambridge St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Although its strange, a mexican place in a gas station, this spot has some good food.

A lot of the food (see: raw meat) is undercooked, which is a health hazard. The sashimi is still frozen in the centre on arrival. Some of the pork I was eating was raw in the centre. The rolls are inconsistent in size - sometimes you get large rolls and sometimes smaller ones of the same kind, but you still pay the same price. The sushi rice is not fresh. It's often mushy and chewy, which makes the nori disgusting on the roll.  They have obviously switched to cheaper ingredients. I would not be surprised if this place failed a city health inspection for Food Safe.\\n\\nTheir signature winter california roll used to be $4.50, and now it's $6.50, when it's just a california roll with scallop and Japanese mayo put on top. \\n\\nI asked for my udon soup noodles to be substituted with soba noodles due to a food allergy, and they charged me an extra $2 for this change. There's no justification for this. \\n\\nEach time the waitress came to our table, she ran away before I could even open my mouth to make requests. The service was VERY poor. We waited 30 minutes for our meal, when all we ordered was soup and some rolls. \\n\\nThis place used to be a gem in a Burnaby, now it's no different than any other Chinese owned sushi place.

The restaurant is basically empty inside with some people eating outside. \\n\\nWe ordered: clam ceviche, prosciutto and melon, French toast, and BLT egg Benedict. French toast was amazing! It's fluffy inside and crispy outside. The cinnamon whipped cream was pretty smart, too. Prosciutto was pretty decent, but the melon had no flavor. I've definitely had better ones which the melon is very sweet and compliments the prosciutto well. \\n\\nClam ceviche is mediocre if not worse. I kept getting small pieces of shells in my mouth, and the dish doesn't have the kick that ceviche dishes usually have. I had to almost dump the whole cup of cocktail sauce on top to make it work. Eventually I got sick of spitting shells out of my mouth, so I stopped eating my second ceviche. Egg Benedict was also pretty mediocre- Definitely not worth the price. My boyfriend noticed that the \\"freshly squeezed\\" grapefruit juice was actually produced on 9/26. Today is 10/7. \\n\\nOur server was amazing. He was professional and funny.

The veggie eggrolls were about what you'd expect, but good and crispy and yummy with not only their sweet and sour sauce but also an unexpected, tasty hot sauce for dipping.

The original price still looked too high for ice cream. And I'm not a fan of most of their flavors. \\n\\nSure, they're being innovative with their flavors. Then again, I don't like it when my ice cream actually taste like sweet potato than ice cream.

I'm pretty sure their traditional ice cream flavors like vanilla or chocolate taste awesome. But you feel compelled to always go for their weird flavors when you're at Morelli's.  I guess paying $3 for a tiny scoop of vanilla isn't worth it. \\n\\nI give it 3.5 stars, but I'll round it up to 4 stars because I liked the flavor I picked, and because of the Scoutmob coupon dropping the price to normal levels."},{"name":"Sweet Carrot","address":"1417 W 5th Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Its a simple place and has a very neat look to it.

Health food it's not, perfect American southern fare it is. FYI - the gravy is out of this world. Ask them to top thier hashbrowns with some gravy, wow!

The best part about this buffet was the three different kinds of hummus with accompanying flatbread.  I kinda feel cheated, for while meat-eaters definitely get their money's worth at this buffet, vegetarian options are lacking.  They had a couple of soups that were vegetarian, but of course they contain cornstarch.  The tabbalouh salad is good, and the desserts contained a variety of options.  I think the buffet could have benefited from the inclusion of an ice cream machine (although that is not African, but then again, I don't think brownies and cookies are traditional African fare.)  The fruit was also plentiful- I remember strawberries, pineapple, and cantaloupe.  But really, don't pay for this buffet if you are a vegetarian.  The main entree in this buffet is meat, meat, meat.

Because it's my go-to I'm going to review the Big Cali Burrito.  \\n\\nSTUFFED rice, organic refried beans, two different types of cheese- it is the best prescription for hunger.  It also includes sour cream but I always opt against it.  Some tex-mex places under or overcook their rice but Lime Fresh cooks it perfectly every time I've been.  Same  with the ORGANIC refried beans- perfectly cooked and not too crispy.  The Big Cali is definitely the way to go.\\n\\nThe staff is always very pleasant and greet myself and my girlfriend with a smile and offer a menu.  When we order they always offer an upgrade to get Guacamole with your order for an extra cost.  Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.  If you do, however, rest assured that you won't regret it.

It's a bit inconsistent but there are some high points.\\n\\nThere's plenty of seating and seldom a wait.  On Sundays, they have a brunch that is very popular.  There's also a separate bar area for those  who wish to have a couple of drinks before dinner.\\n\\nThe salsas that they bring to the table before the meal are good.  The chips are usually fresh and warm and the bus staff keep the bowls refilled often.\\n\\nThe main courses can be a bit inconsistent.  A few months ago, it seemed like the dishes like the enchiladas were more flavorful and better prepared.  The corn tortillas used for the enchiladas taste like they're store-bought and not fresh.  Some of the problem is that the meats in the enchiladas is better quality that typical Tex-Mex and a little underspiced.  One of the things that makes traditional Tex-Mex more flavorful is the fattier meats and the amount of spice used in preparation of the meat.  The sauces on the dishes could also be punched up a little more to add more flavor.\\n\\nIf you go for lunch, be aware that the lunch menu is smaller portions- even on weekends.  This generally means 1 enchilada instead of the usual 3 on the dinner menu.  You can, however, request the dinner portions any time during the day.\\n\\nThe saving grace is the desserts.  They are awesome and very decadent.  If you get the Mexican Brownie, plan on splitting it- it's a very generous portion of hot, rich fudge brownie with nuts, a butter sauce and ice cream.  The flan is a custardy flan that is quite good.  The Mexican Apple Pie is also a good choice.\\n\\nServers tend to turn over quite often.  A few favorite servers have come and gone.  On one trip, a large family was at the table with their toddlers.  After they left, there was a pile of food on the floor from where the children had thrown most of their meals onto the carpet under the table.  The family did not apologize and apparently left a minimal tip.  The waitstaff took it all in stride and worked together to clean up the disaster and prep the table for the next inconsiderate suburban family.\\n\\nLike so many downtown locations, parking can be a problem.  Lot parking and valet are both avaialble for 7 dollars.  It's in the warehouse district, so good luck on finding street parking on the weekend.  \\n\\nOne criticism of the restaurant:  I don't know why it is that televisions have to be placed in restaurants these days.

Your not gonna see or find this place driving by unless your looking for it! Once you do you will be amazed! \\n\\nKeep in mind this is INTERIOR Mexican food! I can see how some might be nervous once they look at the menu but this place has SO much to offer! If Tequila is up your alley take a look at there menu! Over a dozen quality tequilas and and amazing margarita list. Keep in mind I consider Patron to be the well water of Tequilas, its made by Paul Michell for God's sake! \\n\\nWe ordered the guacamole and salsa to start, both were made table side to order and both were amazing! Margaritas were amazing, I had the cucumber cilantro and a guest had the avocado Rita! Yes, weird but very refreshing! We also had the queso flammado, spelling is way off but my hands were full and I forgot to write it down. Another amazing appetizer that you know was not at all healthy for you but you couldn't stop eating it! \\n\\nWe ordered the \\"mantajeta' dish which was spicy as all get out but the flavors or onions, roasted tomato's, chorizo, chicken and beef were so amazing you couldn't stop eating it. And the presentation was amazing! It came out in a cast iron pot that was heated so it litter ally sizzled throughout our dinner. \\n\\nThe Asada steak which normally a flat iron steak was incredibly flavor full! Marinated to perfection and accompanied with seared green onions, limes and cilantro we cleaned our plates and begged for more! \\n\\nGreat atmosphere!

Don't get me wrong - the food was still as delicious as ever! But our waiter had essentially no personality (forgivable - we can't all be dynamos), and the one thing I couldn't get past: the bathrooms (both of them) were absolutely disgusting. Urine all over the toilet, seat, floor. I would've assumed this was just because of some terrible customer, but alas, the doorknob was sticky, there was no soap in EITHER dispenser, and it was clear that this was the bathroom the employee that was serving us had JUST COME OUT OF. \\n\\nI want to look past this... so I'm still giving three stars for the food.

I've been there on weekdays and it's very quiet so you can easily find a table. Definitely was busy on the weekend, but I still found a spot and there was a short line at the counter.

They look like they're enjoying their job and will always make sure you are satisfied with your meal. \\n\\nThe food is always very satisfactory. The pasta is homemade and comes in appetizer or entree portions. I advise going for the appetizer portions because the entree portions are not that much larger. The sides are very simple, yet wonderful. The wild mushrooms and broccoli rabe are both to die for. The most memorable entrees I've had are the hanger steak, the duck, and the swordfish (only seasonal, unfortunately). The pork belly is also mouth watering!\\n\\nLast but certainly not least is the Warm Toffee Pudding. Oh my god. Do not pass this up. I repeat DO NOT PASS THIS UP. You will regret it.\\n\\nAlthough 62 is on the pricier side, it is easily worth the money. Do yourself a favor and give it a shot! If you're feeling extra nice, take someone there and they'll be forever in debt to you!"},{"name":"Sugidama Soba & Izakaya","address":"260 Elm St, Ste 106","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"My GF and I stopped by on a Tuesday night after hearing about this place from a few friends.  Upon entering we immediately noticed the decor.  Cool contrasting pattern on the wood flooring and a large mural on an accent wall.   They asked if we wanted to share a table but we opted for the bar at the end.  I have issues sitting with strangers.\\n\\nI wanted to try everything, because I'm a fatass, but my GF can't eat as much as me so I had to narrow down my choices.   We got some yakitori - kalbi, squid, and a chicken wing.  They were all good.  Nothing out of the ordinary though.  Just good.  I'm a meat lover so I could sit and shove meat sticks down my mouth all dayyyyy hngggg.  We also tried the fried baby octopus and hamachi kama for apps.   I liked the fried baby octopus but the other half just thought they were decent.   Our hamachi kama seemed slightly overcooked.  \\n\\nFor sobas, we tried the Sukiyaki hot soba and the hot soba with duck (I rarely remember the names of the things I eat).   This was my first experience with soba and felt that it was just okay.  And the reason really isn't that it was bad; it's just that I am a pho and ramen kind of guy (loaded with extra meat).   The broth was tasty and rich but the whole meat to noodle ratio was too low for me.  I also felt like I wanted some veggies in it.   If you've never tried soba, try it out once.  If you like soba, most likely you'll like this place.  I'll stick to what I like.  \\n\\nFor dessert we tried the green tea cheesecake with green tea ice cream.  Good stuff.  I like the green tea cake at Gyu-Kaku much more though.  After finishing dessert my fatass of a GF wanted to order mochi too.   I waved down the waitress and she came with the check before I could tell her we still wanted more food so she ended up giving us some mochi on the house.  That was really kind of her.  \\n\\nAll in all, definitely check the place out if you're in the area.   If I'm in the area next time I'm going to try out some other meat sticks, cold soba, and sushi."},{"name":"Crema Cafe","address":"27 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"The atmosphere is cozy with lots of students studying.

That being said I am always looking for something a little bit closer to compliment my lazy side. I am lucky enough to have found King Wong on Division for Chinese (amazing), but I hadn't found Thai, until we drove by this unassuming little store front. It had me at Thai Fresh. Most Thai places live and die by the quality of their ingredients, and if this place is bold enough to put FRESH in their name, it must be at least fresh. So we tried and were rewarded with reason number two. The food is simple, well balanced in flavors, affordable, and fresh! I haven't had a dish yet that blew my mind, but I have had several curry cravings satisfied (mmm...leftovers in my fridge). Reason number three is that the wait staff does seem to have some sort of ownership stake in how this place does, and are incredibly kind and appreciative of your business.

It is more like Mcdonalds style but in more local relax and free environment. You have to order at the cashier before you find a table to sit. You get your own water, forks, knives. You clean your table after you eat. So, if you have always been a cheap tipster, you at least would not feel bad. But.. tips are still encouraged for people who will wash your dishes.\\n\\nThe food\\nI tried the Pine State club. It was great. Everything on my plate was really good. The fried chicken was the champion. They fried it to the perfect level. Crispy outside and tender inside. The saltiness of the meat were also perfect. I really recommend this one. Do not go with the basic biscuit and ham and cheese. Trust me !\\n\\nThe Location\\nThe location could be a bit turn off in the morning and afternoon because of the parking. The street parking might be full. Bus might not be as convenient. So, that is the only thing.\\n\\nThe atmosphere\\nto be frankly, it is not that comfortable.

As soon as I got back to my place, I wish I had eaten it at the restaurant.  The steaming broth was close to being no more. The broth hit the spot especially on a chilly day. The portion was a lot even for a glutton such as myself. The 4 stars I am giving is mainly for the food I had ordered. Service was okay.

Unfortunately World of Beer Lamar is the first bar where I encountered some weird xenophobia for the first time in my life. It feels surreal typing this and I'm literally shaking my head about this whole situation, but the bartender held on to my passport for 15 minutes and questioned me, looked for stamps (?), and finally gave it back saying only Texan ID-holders and American passport-holders are allowed to order.  For a moment I thought ordering here entailed going through a Chris Kyle Theme Park Ride in a way: you get your passport scrutinized more than it would be at the American embassy in Kabul, and then ultimately you get sent away with your beer. I really appreciated this comedy routine until it appeared the man was actually serious! Either this bartender had never seen a passport before or he wasn't aware there's countries that exist apart from the USA. I'm really not exactly sure what his angle was, but unfortunately I suspect it was some kind of powerplay, that, in his case, ended in grabbing my girlfriend's purse and holding it upside down so that all her money fell out. Luckily for all of us that's when he just walked away from this social disaster and someone else took over. All in all I felt very embarrassed through the whole thing and so did my girlfriend. We're both well in our 30's and we're rocking some serious crowsfeet so it couldn't have been an ID thing. I know that bartenders can have a bad day and I'm totally accepting of that; it's different though when they're getting their rocks off antagonizing you based on where you're from. Obviously this man doesn't comprehend what \\"World\\" in \\"World of beer\\" stands for. It leaves a foul taste about an otherwise decent enough joint.

The awful disgruntled woman who answers the phone seems to think that her job is not to simply take my order and fill it, but that she gets paid to insult and demean her customers. You'd think she'd have realized by now that customers buying their food is the key to making them money. She doesn't seem to get it.\\n\\nSix months ago, I ordered for my coworkers over the phone. I had no complaints about the interaction with this terrible woman until she interrupted my order. She told me that I couldn't get a soup and sandwich combo with a panini. In the middle of her sharp tone barking corrections at me, I told her to forget the entire $50+ order and I hung up. \\n\\nToday, I was again forced to hang up in her face. I have since learned this beast's name is TINA. My workplace submitted an online order. My order was kind of weird, so I called to confirm. She is again correcting me rudely, this time telling me that I placed an online order wrong. But she received it and is looking at it, telling me the place I put my orders was wrong. She adds, this'll be extra, that'll be extra... I told her that'd be fine, I just want a correct order. \\n\\nI had a feeling this was still going to get messed up, so I called again to double check. She rudely interjects that no, that's not what I had requested. The order had already gone out, and I was forced to accept my delivered incorrect meal that I was charged extra for. \\n\\nThe delivery woman did not speak much English, so she couldn't help to resolve the problem, which is okay, because this is not her fault. She brought with her a copy of the online order receipt, which had items crossed out in black sharpie but not deducted from the total. I wrote on it and sent it back to her, after photocopying it for myself. I wrote to TINA to refund what she had blacked out, and to take back this wrong sandwich. \\n\\nNow, my only weapon against this dingus woman is for my entire workplace to never order from there again. I want her to see this review and change her stupid idiotic ways. She can't run a business like that.

It was too dark and we wouldn't have been able to see the food and presentation as well. We started off with mussels and French onion soup as appetizers. I only tried the mussels. It was enough for a meal! The portion size is very generous. It also includes toasted bread. I forgot to take a photo of the appetizers. I drank a glass of red wine (shadow of the beast) very good. Nice deep red. I ordered the lamb dish- medium rare. It was excellent. Then came dessert. The grey stuff, of course! Again, excellent. I was finally surprised with more grey stuff and a birthday card from Belle and the Beast. Our waitress was very attentive and personable. Dinner was excellent and I'm so glad it was because it could be a long while before we are able to snag reservations again! We dined here with the dining plan. We only paid for the appetizers.

I wasn't terribly keen on eating here, but the kidlets were desperate to see the inside and since the trolls at the bridge won't let you inside the castle without a reservation I made my way to the gate-keeper. After being told it would be a 30 minute wait, we were granted a pager and allowed to stand on the bridge. After a few minutes, luckily much shorter than the promised 30, we were unceremoniously escorted to our table in the main dining room. They clearly attempted to recreate the experience of the ballroom in the movie, but the ceiling is much lower and as a result the effect doesn't carry through.\\n\\nThe room is very dark, and each table has a battery-operated tea light, which doesn't help much. We really thought the red napkins tied into a rose were a neat touch.  \\n\\nI knew we lost our server's attention right out of the gate when I ordered water, no apps (sorry-but I'm on a budget!).  From then on we never saw him again. Our food came unusually quickly, as in less than five minutes after putting our order in. The table next to us, who'd clearly arrived long before us, were shocked as our plates were unceremoniously dumped on our table. They obviously were pushing to turn our table over fast. The pork chop was undercooked and the cornish hen was no better than Publix's rotisserie chicken. I really liked the mac & cheese side dish and we enjoyed the chocolate pastry. \\n\\nKids had a good time, and in the end that's all I really wanted. Had I known better I would have held off for lunch service.

While obtaining the reservation for the day that we wanted was relatively easy (by booking it 180 days in advance) something has always come up that has required us to move the reservation. We both love Disney and Beauty and the Beast is my favorite Disney movie so we kept re-booking our reservation for birthdays, anniversaries, etc. in hopes that we could actually make it. I can definitely say it was well worth the wait!\\n\\nWhen we arrived for check-in there was a little hiccup with the computer so it seemed our reservation was MIA but thankfully someone had enough foresight to print a hard copy of the reservations for the day (which we were luckily on). The feature that notifies you via text when your table is ready is wonderful. After checking in we were able to go off and browse in the nearby Bonjour! Village Gifts store which kept us cool while we waited.\\n\\nThe cast members at Be Our Guest really work hard to make the experience as immersive to the theme as possible. Once your reservation is confirmed (by calling back to Mrs. Potts to notify her of your arrival) and you receive notice that your table is ready you proceed to the entrance where a cast member greets you with a light up Lumi√®re for you to carry as you're escorted through the castle to your table. You're given a quick tour of the layout which is helpful. We were seated in the Grand Hall which is really quite beautiful. Instrumental music from the movie plays lightly throughout the castle and the lighting is soft which helps add to the ambiance. Periodically throughout the dinner service Beast will make an appearance which I imagine is quite enjoyable for children that enjoy seeing characters. The little details are what I truly enjoyed, like the napkins that were folded to look like roses. I can't speak for the West or East Wing because we didn't venture over to either of them but Grand Hall does get a bit noisy - par for the course given its immense size.\\n\\nAfter reviewing the menu online I had a rough estimate of what we'd spend on the meal and we actually came in $20 less than what I expected which was a pleasant surprise. For people that complain about the quality of the food in comparison to the price paid they seem to forget about the total experience that you're paying for. Yes, we came to eat dinner but we also came to enjoy the theming. We didn't come expecting Michelin star dining but as with most of Disney's higher priced dining experiences - the food was quite tasty! The portion sizes were quite generous and we actually struggled to finish our food. \\n\\nAll of the wait staff is wonderful and very personable. We thoroughly enjoyed the conversation we had with the manager that stopped by our table to wish us a happy anniversary. After we finished dinner our waitress rolled over the dessert cart and what a treat it is! The \\"Grey Stuff\\" really IS delicious! The manager sent over a complimentary little dessert for our anniversary which was really sweet.\\n\\nHaving thoroughly enjoyed such a magical experience we are both already looking forward to our next visit!"},{"name":"Sabatino's Italian Kitchen","address":"242 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Arlington","stars":"3.5","text":"With all these great reviews, I thought this place was going to be awesome but it was far from it.

We went for dinner or a Monday night around 8 PM and were pretty disappointed. \\n\\nThe guys started out splitting a plate of ribs which they described as \\"okay\\". The girls split the Fried Tortilla Chips appetizer with guacamole and the Pepper Jack Spinach Dip. The chips were warm tortilla chips served on a plate, the guacamole was great, and we're not too sure of we were brought out the correct dip. It was definitely cheesy and good, but we didn't notice any spinach. \\n\\nWhen it came to main meals, my friend's meal didn't make it to the table along with the other dishes. After a while of us waiting, our hunger took over and the rest of us began to eat rather than continue to wait for our friends meal to be ready. After we were more than halfway through our meals, our server came by to see how we were doing. We explained that our friend's dinner hadn't arrived to the table yet. The server was polite and went to go check in the kitchen for a status update on the meal. When she returned she apologized and said there was a hold up because something was wrong their fryer. A while later the meal came out and it was not the correct meal she had ordered. We asked to return what was brought out and have the original order made and packaged up to go because by this point the rest of our group was finished eating. Major disappointment and made dinner a bit awkward. 4 of our group ordered BBQ and none of them liked it. All 4 of them are super easy to please and usually eat anything in front of them, including food they've accidentally dropped on the floor first. They explained that the BBQ was dry, lacked flavor, and overall were just upset they had spent money on it. They doused it in the squeeze bottle sauces (I believe a sweet and a spicy sauce) and said the sauces were good but the meat was not. I was the only fortunate one to order a meal and enjoy it! I ordered the Angry Samoan burger cooked well done. It was really good! However I feel like most people don't go to a BBQ spot and order a burger.\\n\\nService was not always attentive however everyone was nice and polite. They ended up taking our friends late meal off of the bill which we all really appreciated.

We were pleasantly surprised!  By the way, we are not Thai aficionados by any means, nor do we claim to know what's authentic and what's gringo.  We just know if it tastes good or not, and we say it tasted pretty darned good!\\n\\nFirst, let me say what others have been saying, just to reiterate: Although the address is on Congress, the restaurant is actually on 7th Street, half a block west of Congress.  If you look on Congress, you'll walk or drive up and down the block a thousand times and will never find it.  \\n\\nAs for the ambiance, I found it very pleasant.  The walls inside are stone.  It looks kind of like the inside of Clay Pit, in case you are familiar with the stone walls inside that restaurant.  The waitresses were very friendly and the service was fine.   We went on a Friday night and the place was fairly full but we were able to get a table without waiting.\\n\\nWe started with shrimp Thai Passion rolls for appetizers.  They were yummy, with the peanutty dipping sauce.   For my entree I had the Thai Passion Noodles with Chicken (combination of hot noodles and chicken with cold crispy bean sprouts and cucumber).  It was great.  I really liked it and am already thinking of coming back to try it with shrimp.\\n\\nThe hubby had the Panang Curry with Chicken (which included fresh green beans and green peppers).  It was delicious as well, and came with a side of steamed rice.\\n\\nThe serving sizes were large but not insanely so.  We ate all our food and were quite full, but not so full as to regret it.

So tastewise I don't have any complaints.\\n\\nAnd ambiance, yes, it's a lovely looking room.  Their bathroom is a work of art, as well.\\n\\nWhere Joey's really falters is its service, especially at dinnertime.  Also, their entire hierarchy of duties is a mess.\\n\\nWhen I tried to make reservations when they first opened, I was told that they didn't take any reservations.  I shrugged it off.\\nWhen I made reservations recently, I was told by the person answering the phone that she wouldn't be able to take the reservations, but that she would have to tell the manager and he would call me back.  I left her all my information (name, date of reservation, time wanted, how many people) and waited.  I guess I must have missed the phone call, although it stumps to me to think of how come she can't take the reservation herself.  I have never heard of such a policy, especially not from a casual dining establishment.  Pretentious, much?\\n\\nNow, last night I think is the last time I'll ever try eating here.  My family came in at 6:20 pm and asked for a table for 4.  There were 2 groups of 4 already waiting in the waiting area.  The hostess checked with the dining room and then told us that we would have to wait 15-20 minutes.  We said okay.\\nAt 6;50, my mom went up to the hostess and asked how much longer.  Our 15 minutes suddenly transformed into FORTY-FIVE ADDITIONAL minutes!  I should note at this time the waiting area was starting to get kind of crowded.  The hostess told my mom that we'd only been there for 10 minutes - um, excuse me?  When my mom said, no, we'd been there for nearly half an hour, and at that time she had told us a much shorter waiting time, the hostess said \\"no no no, I said 45 minutes.\\"\\n\\nNow, I double checked.  My mom heard 15.  I heard 15.  My brother heard 15.  My dad heard 15.  Can you really tell me that every single one of us got it wrong?  And she checked with the dining room!!  Don't insult my intelligence by pretending that \\"15\\" sounds like \\"more than an hour.\\"\\n\\nWhile this whole thing was going on, servers with menus were coming out and trying to figure out who was \\"party of 3\\" or \\"party of 2.\\"  I guess they don't use this thing called \\"names\\" to identify the parties by?  What kind of messed up system is this?!\\n\\nI looked inside the dining room, and there were about 3 tables for four people that were still sitting empty.  Are these reserved?  Are these people late?  If they're half an hour late, don't you usually void the reservation?\\n\\nAnyway, my previous okay experiences were totally negated by the pretentiousness that my family and I experienced most recently, and I wouldn't bring any of my friends to Joey's on Broadway.

The pork chop was only flavorful on the outside where the seasoning was. Other than those areas it was like eating a big hunk of flavorless meat. Macaroni and cheese was not, as cheesy, as I would have liked it to be but it had more flavor than the pork chop. Surprising the grilled asparagus was really good. I think, that was my favorite part of the whole dish. My mother had the braise pork, which came with mushrooms onions carrots and bacon and also a cauliflower pur√©e. She enjoyed her dish; she said the braised pork was very flavorful but could've did without the cauliflower pur√©e. It wasn't seasoned enough. Last the kids meals. My sister had grilled steak with String beans and carrots. Her steak was a good size to be from the kids meal.  It was also very tender. My brother had chicken tenders skewers, with mashed potatoes and Zucchini. He seemed to enjoy it even though he didn't eat much. \\n\\nFor dessert I had the grey stuff, of course. The grey stuff made up for my meal, it was everything you could imagine it to be. I would go back just for dessert. My brother and sister both had the tropical fruit creampuff. They enjoyed it. I tasted a small piece of it and there was a funky aftertaste to it. I wouldn't recommend it personally. My mother had the strawberry Cream cheese cupcake. Which was every delicious. \\n\\nMy family agreed be our guest would not be on our reservations for next year.

In total we ordered several: pulled pork, porchetta, Korean barbecue, grilled cheese, and salmon dill. I didn't get a chance to eat the Korean barbecue one, but the other four were delicious, exhibiting a real talent of the sandwich designers on flavors that mix -- both traditional combinations and somewhat unique new combinations. The bread is somewhat toothy, but not so hard/tough that all the fillings squish out when you take the first bite.\\n\\nThe two most impressive points of the four sandwiches I tasted were:\\n- That salmon is fully cooked, but oh so tender and moist that I believe it could only be done by sous vide, or else they must have a monumental culinary secret on their hands. (Mental note: next time I'll need to go in person to watch how they prep this fish, and see if I can recreate it at home!)\\n- The pulled pork itself is mixed thoroughly in BBQ sauce, and is free of the intrusive tangy sour notes that I find overpowers most pulled pork sandwiches out there. Ditto the slaw: definitely tastes like slaw, but without the strong acidic overtone. I can only describe it as if all the flavors were slightly \\"tempered\\"/melded better. If you like that traditional strong tang in your pulled pork, this ain't for you. But I abhor it, and this sandwich was the best BBQ pulled pork I've ever had, bar none. \\n\\nI won't go into more detail about all the other individual sandwiches' flavors and mechanics, but when I'm in the area again (I don't live around here), I will definitely be visiting again!"},{"name":"East Wave Asian Fusion","address":"60 Luckie St NW, Ste C","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"This place disappointed me.

I kind of wanted that one but the price wasn't anywhere and I ended up deciding a plain old bacon cheeseburger would be best.

I had to rip off a piece of the leaf lettuce because it was not good. \\n\\nThe burger was pretty average, but like I said it tastes better than anything McDonald's has to offer.

The food was very much above average, hot and flavorful.   We started with the Cheese fondue and Bruchetta and both were generous for 4 people to enjoy and the cheese in the fondue was had a nice smokey flavor to it.  I had the  Grilled Chicken Penne and it was a very nicely spiced dish had good fresh Roma tomatoes and chunks of grilled chicken.    They had a wine special called \\"Random Reds\\"  for $15.00 to move some low selling bottles.   I don't normally get a bottle of wine since my husband and friends are not really wine drinkers, but at $15.00 it was too good to pass up.

It was a 2003 from St Joseph's in Canby and after letting it breath for a few minutes it was thoroughly enjoyed by my friend and I.    I see in some reviews below they talk about slow service.   This was true last night, but the server did advise us and apologize about it.  But since we were here more to listen to Barbara we did not mind the wait.

I ordered the homestyle bean curd and the spicy sauteed string beans - my sleepless dining companion the pot stickers and the chicken chow fun.  \\n\\nDelivery was speedy and courteous, and the price was reasonable - about $35.00 for our order, plus tip.  \\n\\nAnd the food - well?  For delivery food at 1:00 in the morning, I don't think I can really complain.  \\n\\nMy chief beef with Lucky Star is that they seem to use frozen vegetables in their stir-fries (I came to this conclusion based on the suspiciously regular green beans and the many waffle-cut carrots).  With fresh vegetables so easily available and so easy to prepare, this seems a little absurd.  \\n\\nOn the other hand, their portions are unstinting, and the quality of the proteins (meat and tofu) and the sauces was really quite good.  The chow fun was not quite well-blended enough, with the end result that some of the rice noodles stuck unappetizingly together into a sticky goo.  But the brown sauce - oh, the brown sauce.  The tofu was chewy and scrambled-eggy, the way good fried tofu should be.  I only encountered one piece I considered undercooked - not bad.  \\n\\nThe pot stickers were the celebrities of the evening - maybe I was just delirious with hunger, but their succulent fried ends haunt me even now.\\n\\nAfter doing all the damage we could, my friend and I still had plenty of leftovers - I ate the chicken for lunch the next day, and the tofu and beans for lunch for two days following.  Curiously enough, the food was MARKEDLY improved by its time in my refrigerator.  After two days, the green beans had that perfect wrinkly texture; they tasted deliciously of their sauce, which, to my surprise, was actually spicy. The tofu had a richer flavor.

But I thought to myself that it's good to try new things and I'm glad I did.\\n\\nHowever, there were times where I wanted to question or protest something but I didn't because I did not want to cause a scene of some sort.\\n\\nI remembered my first meal here and I thought to myself that the broth was really good....a little too good. So good to a point where I was literally drinking the broth using my spoon (and I don't normally do that and it was rare for me to do so that I had to take a second look at myself and what I was doing) after finishing the noodles. It wasn't until I left the restaurant that I joked to my friend that they probably put MSG in their broth. She smiled and kinda agreed. It left me wondering...\\n\\nSoon after my first meal, I came back with different friends on different occasions (sometimes to introduce the place, other times with the same friends). I've had a couple of unhappy small incidents since then. One time I wanted to put my backpack on a chair and the waiter told me that I couldn't do so. I said that I didn't want to put my bag on the dirty floor. He looked down and said \\"sorry.\\" It didn't look like he meant it and seemed like it was his own rule to the restaurant. He needed the chair for another customer but the restaurant was not even full at the time (probably at 65% capacity on a weekday). Afterwards, I thought to myself I should have told him/suggested to him to get a chair from the other tables in the restaurants. But it seemed that he was mostly lazy and wanted the chair closest to me instead of carrying it from the far end of the restaurant...only less than ten feet away. I was pretty pissed that I had to put my backpack on the restaurant floor that looked dirty and rarely mopped. \\n\\nAnother small incident that would be good to note is that I think only two people per table can pay with a card. And there is obviously a minimum.  Be sure to tell the waiter to split the check if possible before ordering and know what the minimum is. They are pretty picky on that. At some point, I could have sworn that they don't even follow their own rules. (Ie. if, say, minimum is $8 for card, bill was $12 and they said they can't accept cards because its not high enough)  I forget what our total bill came to during that visit which is why I guess they could only take two cards and not from all three of us. Also they don't take American Express.\\n\\nIt wasn't until my last visit here that I brought two more new friends to the restaurant.\\n\\nThey said they both enjoyed their meals and the experience went without much incident. As we went to a desert place afterwards, both of my friends, who are healthy and not allergic to anything, said that they both felt a dry throat, slight tingling sensation and/or a possible slight headache. I had to agree with the dry throat and slight tingle as I felt it too. We drank water as a small remedy. \\n\\nThe final test would be to bring my parents in to try out the restaurant food to see what they would think as they are more sensitive to certain ingredients in the pho broth. I would value their opinion more in these cases.\\n\\nOther than that, they do have terrific broth but terrible service.

Not sure I'd order it again since it seems to be a bit of a rip-off.  The butter chicken was pretty good - it seemed to be a safe, but solid choice.  I didn't think I'd like the korma, but it was actually pretty decent.  The samosas were good.  The naan was quite delicious and probably the star of the meal.  Our mango laasis were good, but definitely a bit warm and liquidy (probably the drive home's fault).  \\n\\nOverall, it was good, but it seemed slightly expensive for the amount and quality of food that we got.

The frosting was great, the cookie underneath was really hard, so that was a bit of a let down. But I wasn't too mad about it, since I was so full for dinner anyway.\\n\\nOccasionally throughout dinner, the Beast makes his rounds through the various dining rooms, and then on your way out, you get to have a photo op with him in his study! As I understand it, the Beast is only there during dinner, so that was a fun treat.

There's something about Happy Lamb that was super satisfying and made us... well, happy. \\n\\nI came here with my boyfriend and our good friends on a Monday night. It was rainy, cold, and literally the perfect night to get hot pot. It was about 7 pm and it wasn't crowded at all. The place was clean and wasn't too stuffy. We were greeted and seated right away. My friends and I looked over the menu, it was huge. They do suggest each person gets 1 protein each and about 2-3 side dishes. I liked that they give you suggestions for portion size, because knowing my boyfriend and I, we would over order like no other. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I ordered the beef combo plate, the meatball combo plate, and scallops. We also ordered the mushroom basket, watecress, bok choy, and a plate of udon noodles. A waiter came over and asked if he could get our broth started. We ordered the spicy one while we got the other half as vegetarian for our friends. It was nice to get that going and then figure out what we wanted. After putting down all our choices, we handed it to our waiter. The portion sizes are done so well. The food comes out pretty quickly as well. Make sure you keep track of everything you get, we realized we were missing some tofu, but once we told the waiter he grabbed some and brought it right over. We had so much food, they brought out a tray to put next to the table to leave some stuff there. \\n\\nThe spicy brother is NO joke. The amount of chili's and spices in the broth are a little much. We almost couldn't handle it, and in the end got them to add more of the original broth to our spicy one to help cut some of the spice. It was still insanely good. I wouldn't recommend the getting the scallops, they were hard to fish back out of the pot. The bok choy was great and so was the beef platter. \\n\\nThe vegetarian broth comes with some sauces on the side to help season it a little. Anytime we were running out of broth, I just asked one of the waiters to fill it up or they would come by and ask if we needed some more. \\n\\nThe food here was good, and I thought well proportioned. We couldn't finish all of our side dishes and were stuffed by the end of it. The place is clean (huge plus for me, no sticky floors or anything) and the food is fresh and tastes amazing. Service is friendly and not too overbearing. There is also street parking in front and down the road. We parked about .25 miles away, so it wasn't too bad.

I should've stuck with it, though, because the meatballs were really dry and heavy (and they charge you extra for those, for some reason).\\n\\nThe guy who was making my bowl added way too much sauce, making the entire thing way too sour and uneatable. Then they were out of some of the garnishes that I wanted (mind you, that was at lunch time, so you'd think they'd be prepared).\\n\\nIn conclusion, I just spent $12 for something that I cannot eat because it just does not taste good.

We were seated in the main ballroom which, though beautiful, is very noisy. Very. Noisy. The other two dining areas were much quieter when we walked in: the West Wing (which is smaller and is Beast's torn-up lair) and the East Wing, which was empty except for one table (so I can't believe they said they had no available reservations for that evening).\\n\\nOur server, Patrick, was extremely friendly, but he did seem quite busy. Our table of 8 was surely one of many large tables under his supervision, which caused service to be kind of slow. It was hard to grab him for drink orders or refills, but he had such a good attitude and was sweating his poor bum off---I'm sure they were just understaffed for what's supposed to be the least busy week of the year. He did leave us with an inspiring pep talk for the kids about their futures, which I thought was wonderful and sweet.\\n\\nThe menu has interesting, expensive choices like rack of lamb (my husband's choice) and pork tenderloin (my choice). Both arrived just above lukewarm, which was a little off-putting, and another family member's steak was overdone (and the server corrected that immediately). The tenderloin was good, the lamb was sweet and not gamey, and I heard rave reviews about the (properly cooked) steaks. The kids had slightly more interesting choices than in the rest of the park, but they still ordered macaroni and cheese (disguised as Beast Casserole) and grilled cheese. Dessert arrived on a cart, and the choices are cupcakes, mousse, cream puffs, and the Gray Stuff (it's delicious---don't believe me? Ask the dishes! And, yes, our server made sure to say that. So I tried it. And it was delicious). But if we hadn't been on the Disney dining plan, I sure would have thought the meal was overpriced. The receipt said the two adults (each with an adult beverage) and two children in our family cost just over $100 with tax.\\n\\nThings seem very regimented here. Only AFTER you finish dining are you allowed to visit with the Beast (even if there's no line---you MUST wait until you're done eating). You're also permitted to visit the West and East wings to see the magical rose and the large music box with Belle and the Beast.\\n\\nSo while it was busy and noisy and not quite as majestic as I'd hoped, we did have great food, a sweet server, and a few swell photo ops. And at the end of a long, hurried, tiring week at Disney, that's pretty much all we could have hoped for."},{"name":"Cantina Laredo","address":"201 W 3rd St","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Cantina Laredo is a run of the mill type of Mexican food joint.

They have wheat crust, so I took that option. \\n\\nI also figured we could order one of the stuffed crust individual pizzas to share - I had to see what the hype was all about. So we ordered a carnivore's special (pepperoni, beef and sausage) as well. \\n\\nWhen the pizzas came out, I was pleased at the just right size of the individual pizzas we ordered. They are about the size of a small dinner plate so it's a perfect portion. My thin crust blanco was good - the crust was crispy and the pizza was not greasy at all. It was supposed to have garlic on it, but they went easy on the garlic which was a bummer. \\n\\nIt's rare that I like the deep dish style, but there are a few places that get it right and Mangia is one of them. The crust was not too thick but it held up to the layers of meat and cheese. The sauce was excellent - I don't like tomatoes so I generally dislike red sauce,  but this was good. It was the perfect amount of spiciness that was complemented by a slightly smoky yet sweet tomato goodness. Eating my half of that individual pie left me wanting for more.\\n\\nOh and before I forget, I drank Live Oak Pilz with my pizza.

The Last 2 Visits, they have really blown it. So let me tell you the Good, the bad and the Ugly. \\n\\nIts Tuesday Night, a Beautiful Night and I make reservations for 7:15. When I get there it is very busy. I am not the only one who has decided to come into Boston on such a wonderful Night in June. \\n\\nI check in and ask if we can sit in the empty table outside. I am told if I want to sit outside it will be a long wait. I say that's okay, I would rather just sit down. They tell me it will be 15 minute wait. No worries we head into the bar. We sit at an empty table. A few minutes later, the cocktail waiter informs us, if we want drinks we will have to go to the Bar our-self and order them. He was much too busy to do his job and wait on us.\\n\\nWe open up a tab. 3o minutes go by and we are still waiting for our table. it took 45 minutes before our table was ready. I am so glad I made reservations to have to wait 45 minutes. Given I made reservations 30 minutes before we arrived. Why did they even take them.  I will tell you why its greed. Its a sign of a very poorly run restaurant. This restaurant is much too expensive to be doing this. 3 people dinner and drinks, was over $250.00. They should have never excepted my reservation for 7:15 when I called in at 6:45. They knew then they were much too busy. Its one of the many reasons why I am giving them a one star rating. But read on....\\n\\nOur table is finally ready, we ask the Bar Tender for the Tab. We have to wait. You know why, the cocktail waiter who was much too busy for us, had to bring the bill by. He was looking for a tip. Did I say Greed. The Management and now the employees. \\n\\nWe sit down at the table. We ask the waiter for an order of mushrooms and Shrimp cocktail, also some bread. He forgets all three. We have to ask more than one. Can I say really BAD service. \\n\\nWhen we finally get the shrimp cocktail, they are over cooked. For such an expensive meal, this is very disappointing, \\n\\nWhen I talked with the people who seated us. They did not realize it was going to be so busy.

Five minutes later my friend's lunch was getting cold so she reluctantly started eating. Another five minutes later my sandwich finally arrived and it was stone cold.  The beef was gristly, without flavor, and wholly unappetizing. The baguette had been toasted but I don't know when because it was cold and there was nothing crisp about it.

My wife mentioned it when someone came by to ask how it was and he was polite and apologetic, and said that happens because of the syrup but it helps the strawberries keep longer.  Fruit rotting is nature's way of telling you to not serve them; prolonging them and reducing the quality of the fruit because of preserving them, especially at a diner like this, is a bad idea.

The concept of sharing plates (while not to everyone's tastes) gelled well with me. Take note that a couple of the small plates were, in fact, exceptionally small. We had ordered a salad of snow peas and pickled strawberries that was so tiny that it's almost impossible to share (despite the waitress saying it would be fine between 3).

If you like a sweeter sauce, you'll really like this pizza. If not, I think you'll still enjoy it as the crust and pepperoni was very good.\\n\\nThe beer selection was decent.

How I adore the pain and pangs you bring. Beauty and the Beast being my favorite Disney movie when I was a little girl (Belle was the only princess who loves to read, which made bookworm me really happy), it is, of course, with deepest pride and greatest pleasure that I made it a point to dine at Be Our Guest. I was particularly excited that dinner here is never second best, purportedly (I am looking at you, Lumiere!).\\n\\nThat was what I initially wanted to do, but I only found out about their popularity two weeks prior to our visit so I was not able to secure a dinner reservation. But no sirree, I simply could not abide with the thought of going to Disneyworld and never setting foot into the castle so we went to lunch instead. The line was long and we waited for almost two hours to be seated. (It sounds so horrible, but since I ended up getting quite a lot of funny pictures posing next to the gargoyles and suits of armor, it passed by quicker than one would imagine.)\\n\\nThe system goes like this. You wait in line and then you order from the kiosks and get a rose buzzer (which I thought was a really neat touch) before you find yourself a seat. Your food would be then brought to you by a waiter donned in stockings and breeches, much like Lumiere and Cogsworth looked like when they finally became human. You are then welcome to explore the castle at your leisure (well that is what we did and no one came to chase us off). And the castle is really truly beautiful with the Rose Room which is darker but has the Beast's Rose in prominent display; the dining room with its elegant chandelier and gorgeous ceiling; and the library with wonderful paintings of Belle and the Beast. It was a delight for this big Beauty and the Beast fan!\\n\\nThe food was so-so in my opinion. We ordered the Croque Monsieur, the Tuna Ni√ßoise Salad, and the Braised Pork. While it was refreshing to have these options while at a resort, the Croque Monsieur is nothing special, the tuna in Ni√ßoise Salad a tad too salty, and the braised pork was alright (Lumiere would most likely turn his nose up at the fare). But they are not too expensive by resort standards and the portions are decent. Really, the selling point of Be Our Guest is the Beauty and the Beast theme. \\n\\nFor being able to say \\"I dined at the Beast's castle,\\" I am a major fan!

We each got 3 and found that to make a plenty filling meal. We both liked the pork belly pastor. My girlfriend also liked the cochinita pibil, which I skipped as it packed a considerable heat punch with the habanero sauce.\\n\\nThe one negative we experienced was the uncomfortable seating.

We had our first date here, and returned 2-4 times a month, usually on a Tuesday or Wednesday.  We were (are still, I suppose) on the preferred seating list.   \\n\\nWe'd gone long enough to understand the ebb and flow of the quality of service at Trudy's, which follows the school year - early in a term, a lot of the staff is still getting used to the job, later on things are closer to clockwork.  We get it, it's cool - and what the heck, they made us feel like valued customers so we kept through the bad as well as the good.\\n\\nNo longer.  Management is another issue, and management is not random - it's deliberate policy on the part of a restaurant and can not be shrugged off.\\n\\nYou see, neither of us can eat corn chips.  After a waiter once suggested the idea to us when we told them this, nearly every time we came to Trudy's for the last three years we ordered the queso especial with spiced beef - but with celery instead of corn chips.  Celery's healthy, and can scoop salsa and queso as well as corn chips or better.  The waiters would tell us that we were referred to as \\"the celery people,\\" and more than one waiter would put the order in to the bar for the celery as soon as they saw us.  Once in a while, if nobody remembered us, we wouldn't get it just as a change, but for the most part we were getting it every time.\\n\\nIt was no problem, week in and week out, month in and month out - except on one occasion on a Saturday, when we were informed that the bar manager had decided to charge us extra for a \\"salad.\\"  We raised out eyebrows at this the one time, but figured that it wasn't worth making a fuss over.  That was over a year or so ago, and that was the only time we were ever charged.  We shrugged it off as \\"one of those things\\" and went back to enjoying Trudy's as one of our favorite haunts.\\n\\nRecently, we went again on a Saturday.  And we made out usual order - and after a few minutes the bar manager stormed over to us and (in a voice full of attitude) informed us that the celery that the restaurant had was for drinks and we would not be served it.  \\n\\nWell, fine.  You won't serve us anything, then - we got up and left immediately.  After 3 years as loyal customers, getting the same appetizer nearly every time, it is simply unacceptable to be told that the restaurant has a food item but are no longer willing to serve it to us.  Especially when it's an item that can so easily be bought cheaply at any local market.  Please - celery is a precious commodity?\\n\\nIt would be one thing if it were the restaurant policy, but after three years it is clearly just an insect up that one manager's rear.  And we can not know when she'll be there filling in for somebody - so we can't go any time and know that we won't have to wait to be seated, sit down, order, and then have to leave.\\n\\nYou might think this is a small thing, but it is our dietary requirement, and is not at all trivial to *us*.  You know, the customer.  The loyal long term customers who suffered uneven service for years, because we felt like despite it all we were still values.\\n\\nGood bye, Trudy's.  Have fun with your jackass of a Saturday bar manager, she has lost Trudy's two very good customers, and all of the friends we can convince to avoid you.

We started with sweet potato fries that came with a spicy ketchup sauce, pretty good. We also got the mussels which were also quite good. For an entree we got the Chilean sea bass and the Grilled steak tips. The sea bass was cooked perfectly. It came with a sweet potato puree that was an amazing complement to the fish. The steak tips were perfectly seasoned as well. 5 stars to both dishes.\\n\\nNow for the drinks. (I will use the same to words I've been using - amazing and perfect). At $8.50 you will get your money's worth and more. After we ate our food we went to the bar. Noon is a mixologist and a very good one at that. Her drinks were so inventive and unique. Both of us got the U-Sizzle, which started sweet but had a nice spicy kick to it. I also would highly recommend the Noon-O-Roni for gin lovers and the Autumn Breeze, which was a very sweet and warm cocktail. \\n\\nThe overall experience was great. The decor was warm and inviting. You can tell they put a lot of money into making it nice. The service was also top notch.

I went here even before Guy \\"my restaurant can't possibly be bad and it's all an NYT conspiracy against me\\" Fieri did a cover on the joint. \\n\\nSome of the dishes I remember well are:\\n\\nXialongbao (juicy pork buns) - firmer and not as juicy, the pork is leaner and thus not as fatty. It is a healthier feeling xialongbao for that reason.\\n\\nSzechuan green beans - tied with Ginger and Chili and Banana Leaf for my favorite places that do these in Vancouver. Spicy and salty with an aroma of ginger to them, they really do a dance on your tastebuds. Something that not even talented performers on rotating poles can manage. \\n\\nDan Dan Noodles - standard, hearty and good - the sesame chili base they use is lighter than in other restaurants like Lin Tea House or Northern Delicacy, but the noodles made here are also a touch fluffier so that they absorb more broth. More soupy noodles = goodness. \\n\\nVegetable dumplings - wonderfully fresh and packed to the brim with mushrooms, greens, and lotus roots, these serve as a great palate cleanser since others are right, the food can be quite salty or spicy to the palate. These were a great accent to...\\n\\nYunnan Rice Noodle Pot - their dish that suits my palate (which favors Cantonese cuisine the most) best. Amazing broth that is light with a clear fresh fish taste and a hint of ginger is ringed with lightly boiled seafood, cilantro and rice noodles. This is one of their best dishes in my opinion and a big surprise since most of the dishes really strike the palate.\\n\\nCat Ears - wonderful, soft dumplings like gnocchi in a savory broth that is also consommeish like the Yunnan dish, but with more of a pork flavor. They always sell out by the end of the day - I wonder why!\\n\\nThe three main problems with the restaurant is the lack of space (not really their fault), the lack of desserts or sweet fruit at least to finish the meal (which isn't that easy to resolve since this is Chinese food), and the head waitress. She is very abrasive in many ways but can be kind (I think she gets the brunt of stress managing the restaurant) but the food and other staff more than make up for it. Surprisingly, they manage to serve the whole restaurant of ~30-40 well with just 3-4 servers. Perhaps the most efficient restaurant I know in that respect.\\n\\nDecor is okay, and you can see the cooks tossing the food at the back.

Note that there are not really any scenic views from the restaurant.\\n\\nOn our last visit to Boma, we had a short wait when we checked-in for our 5pm meal.  \\n\\nBoma is setup with 3 different stations: desserts on the left, salads in the middle, and meats on the far right.  The line for the meats is always the longest, but it moves rather quickly.\\n\\nI was on vacation and ready for some serious eating, so started with the meat line. Salmon, steak, large ribs with Korean BBQ sauce, chicken and our highlight: bobotie, a South African dish.\\n\\nBobotie is a curry-based meatloaf with egg and has an incredible taste.  Recommended.\\n\\nThe rest of the meat dishes were ok. Good meats, but nothing really stood out.\\n\\nThe fufu is tasty, and is basically mashed yams.  I also had a red curry sauce that was excellent, I think it was the mater paneer or perhaps the chakalaka.  The Pap  (South African cornmeal mush) is also delicious.\\n\\nI looked at the salads and most were cous cous-based.  I tried one, but nothing special.  I was looking forward to the seafood stew, but I could tell the seafood had been sitting out too long, and the shrimp was a little too soft.\\n\\nThe desserts are quite good.  Boma has a nice spread of bite-sized goodies.  Boma is known for its Zebra Domes, and they are very tasty.  Note that there is alcohol in the domes.  I also enjoyed the Kenyan Coffee Tarts.  My daughters favorite was the cassava cakes...she even went back for more.  My wife liked the bread pudding.\\n\\nOne of the things I liked about my last visit to Boma was that they offered wine flights.  I ordered the red wine sampler and was able to taste a good variety of reds.\\n\\nI would normally give Boma 5 stars, but the meats on our last trip were a little lacking and I do remember them being better in the past.

The Mexican martini has long been one of my favorite cocktails and when I home in Austin (only twice a year) I always make it a point to meet friends there. A trip home to Austin is just not complete without a Mexican martini.  It's essentially a tequila-based drink (much like a very strong margarita on the rocks), served in a martini glass with a salted rim, green olives and an accompanying shaker filled with more refreshing, delicious, ice-cold martini to pour into the glass. Order an extra dish of olives, and thank me later.\\n\\nMy parents have heard me go on and on about this martini for years, and my dad asked to be treated one. So I took him and my mom there on Thursday around 3 PM. Going at that time was a mistake! The host warned us that Trudy's only served appetizers and drinks at that time. What?! Nowhere on their menu does it say there the full menu is not served all day. My parents were pretty disappointed. We had been looking forward to this meal all week!\\n\\nI warned them that the food in general wasn't very good anyway, so perhaps it was for the best. I feel like Trudy's just drowns everything in quesos and sauces and spiciness. Not a fan of spiciness, I feel like all the food tastes like burning. I usually only order the Ensalada Grande with beef fajita.\\n\\nWith limited choices, my mom and I chose to split the Texas Star Nachos with beef fajita. They were just average nachos: half-tostada shells with melted cheese, beans, sour cream, guac, lettuce, tomato, and pickled jalapenos on the side. My dad ordered the Poquito Flaguities (about the dumbest name ever) which were described as chicken tenders. Not chicken tenders at all! They were actually seasoned chicken wrapped in a flour tortilla and fried, much like a chimichanga. They were served with queso, guac and ranch for dipping. I am so glad that they turned out to be delicious, or I'm pretty sure that my father's experience would have been ruined, after not getting to order off the regular menu.\\n\\nI suppose if I'm going to recommend only the Mexican martini there, then it's fine to go on a weekday from 2-4 PM.

Shrimp tacos were alright too, nothing special.  The ceviche comes with fried plantains, and was pretty tasty, but was a bit too salsa-y.  Another signature of Papagayo that I usually love is the guacamole cart they push to your table when you order it, so they make it fresh in front of you.  I think that's a unique Papagayo staple, however this location does not do that.  The guacamole wasn't that spicy and also was under-seasoned.

I think that the stuffed pizza at Mangia follows a similar formula because one piece feels like a whole pizza.  This is the reason I don't let myself eat here more often.  \\n\\nBut I'll let you in on a little secret - every time I travel for work, I either get a piece on the way to OR from my destination.  I mean, I feel like a weirdo buying food at the airport when I come home, but I am drawn in by the siren-song of stuffed pizza.\\n\\nAnother interesting tidbit about Mangia: on Valentine's Day they make heart-shaped pizzas.  The idea is awesome and cute, but the wait for one of these things (which need to be ordered well in advance) can be quite daunting.  Well, one Valentine's Day me and my beloved ordered a heart-shaped pizza.  We picked it up and took it home only to find out that it was not the pizza we ordered.  After calling and nicely explaining that they had taken the wind out of our pizza-eating valentine's day sails, the manager not only made us a new one for FREE but also delivered it himself to my house which, for the record is NOT in close proximity to the Guadalupe location.

I thought the food was good. I had the yaki soba which I thought had quite a bit of different flavors to it. I wouldn't call it bland at all. \\n\\nWe were lucky enough to be seated with space between us and the neighboring party, but I suppose I could see slight discomfort with the seating arrangements (long, bench-style seating/tables).

What's the best way to judge a Vietnamese sub establishment? You order the Classic Vietnamese sub (assorted cold cuts, pate, pickled vegetables, cilantro, jalapeno & house aioli). \\n\\nMy judgement: The bun could have been crispier (preferably more toasted), larger in size (especially if I'm paying $7) and more moist (don't be afraid to utilize the house aioli). \\n\\nThe Vietnamese style coffee I ordered was literally a shot of caffeine and extremely strong. However, there wasn't much in my cup. I'd say 4/5 of my cup was ice and the remaining bit was coffee. I even had trouble moving around my straw. (This was my second drink choice as they had ran out of the acclaimed avocado smoothie).\\n\\nThe second sub I was able to devour was the BBQ Roasted Duck (juicy roasted duck, scallions, pickled veggies, cilantro, jalapeno & hoisin sauce). \\n\\nMy judgement: If you're not a vegetarian or vegan, ORDER THIS SUB. Again, the bun could have been crispier, but the innards of this masterpiece is worth every penny. Ever had Peking duck? It's almost like that, but in bun form. \\n\\nFinal thoughts: \\nDD Mau is a promising little sandwich shop. Their popularity can only go up from here just as long as they keep improving themselves. I'd love to give them a 4-star rating, but they need to be a little more consistent in drink portions and sandwich sizes. The buns, I've noticed, are - at times - cut into odd lengths, and the Vietnamese coffee volume may also vary."},{"name":"Clyde Common","address":"1014 SW Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I came here for for a quick lunch that was tasty and that's just what I got!

We ended up liking the rice noodles the best, which, with the sauces, made for an interesting mix of chewy and crunchy.\\n\\nFor dinner, we both ordered the Essence of Tuna cooked medium-rare (while normally we'd try two dishes, we both were in the mood for Tuna and it looked awesome). The fish came out cooked to perfection, resting on a bed of rice with the dish split between two sauces-- a ginger-type sauce and a thicker, creamier wasabi-flavored sauce.  A wasabi fan myself, I thoroughly enjoyed both the rice and the tuna in the wasabi sauce while my fianc√© preferred to mix the sauces together. We also ordered a side of asparagus, which was really the only disappointing part of the night: it came in a bath of melted butter topped with breadcrumbs and no real seasoning.  While the asparagus were crunchy (it seemed like they were blanched) the butter was just a bit too much.\\n\\nThe service was attentive throughout the night, our water was regularly filled, and we had no problem getting  the check. \\n\\nTL;DR: Would go back, but would recommend several other places in the area over Chart House.\\n\\nPositives: Very cool venue; entrees and appetizers seemed well-thought-out; reasonably-priced wine with a good list.\\n\\nNegatives:  asparagus seemed like an afterthought; unclear if clientele intended to be tourists or locals."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"3640 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I had nothing else planned for our Sunday in Portland, except experiencing Pine State Biscuits.

It was still warm and that is enough to justify the price.  I was there just before the noon rush. They were actually nice (and smart) to put the bread in a paper bag, with the plastic bag in the paper bag, so that the bread would not get soggy. That way, i could put the bread in the plastic bag when the bread was cool enough. Good idea! Anyway, this pepperoni bread was enough to make me go back at some point.

Something about it - from the Corona salt & pepper shakers to the bucket stuffed into a hole in the middle of the table - makes me think 'Jimmy Buffett' and I'm not much of a fan.\\n\\nService (**): I can't really complain about the particular waitress because the lack of tips gives any person in that position less of an incentive to please the customer.

Best if you just pick up your food rather than dining in, the place doesn't seem very clean anyway. They do participate in ubereats, grubhub and other food delivery service you may think of.The food is good, albeit a little on the visibly oily side. \\n\\nOne thing I look for in a Chinese food restaurant is whether their fried rice is no frills and plain or if it actually has vegetables. This place is the former, which is unfortunate seeing as it's not cheap Chinese food for what it has to offer. At 14$ for a dinner combo it's quite pricy, especially seeing as the dinner combo choices are minimal. You have 5 \\"different\\" choices and two of them are Sesame Chicken and General Tsos Chicken which most places use interchangeably. If you want an appetizer, which I usually want, your meal alone will run you 17$. As someone that doesn't cook, eating from this place will add up rather quickly, especially if you want delivery and leave a decent tip. The food now was good, but again, I saw a layer of oil floating over the sauce underneath--that wasn't pleasant. I ordered the Mongolian beef and it was really good. But seeing that I dropped over 17$ for that and potstickers, I noticed that the portions weren't big at all. This is coming from someone that can hardly finish a big mac, fries, and a drink. The combo comes in a three compartment Styrofoam container. Rice is scooped into both compartments and the rest in the larger third. None of it is full where you would look at it and say \\"wtf, this is amazing, feels like college all over again!\\"The fried potstickers were okay, a tad bit underfried and rather steamed-like. The eggroll was perfectly fresh. The wonton soup I ordered was a bit salty, but a few ounce of Deer Park fixed that right up. \\n\\nWhile I was pleased with my meal it was a little too expensive for the food that I got. $13/14$ range would have been more adequate.

We also got steamed rice cakes, which were very unusual - a thin layer of steamed rice dough topped with crunchy meat bits.

You get a pile of leafy greens, skewers of meat, and heaps of vermicelli and shredded root vegetables, as well as dry rice sheets and a warm bowl of water to craft your rolls on the spot.

Five star.\\n\\nTaiwanese Noodles: Decent but not 100% the same. We expected to have some minced pork with noodles but we hardly saw any in the dish. The braised egg was overcooked on its egg yolk and not flavorful enough. There were some wheat gluten which is weird cause we don't normally have wheat gluten in noodles.

They recently added a cardamom currant snickerdoodle that's really yummy. The scones are delish, and there's nothing better than the ginger lemonade on a hot afternoon. Thank goodness we don't have to go to Au Bon Pain anymore!! I'm really looking forward to trying their bread baked on premises. If it's anything like the rest of their creations, it'll be divine!

I eat exclusively Paleo and have done so for over a year. The food I make at home is far better than what I enjoyed the evening I tried this cart. I had chicken tenders, chili, and muffins. The tenders were under seasoned and over cooked. Bland and dry, and slightly burned on the outside. The chili was fairly devoid of any flavor. The muffins had far too much salt and far too little of anything else. People have complained about the portion sizes, but I must admit, given the quality of the food I was eating I was really quite okay with there not being more of it.\\n\\nPaleo cuisine has to involve creativity with flavors and seasonings or else it's quite hard to enjoy, in my opinion. The cart owners could do far more with herbs and spices. With the thousands of Paleo recipes and flavor combinations that are possible within the Paleo structure, I find it hard to understand why the items served were so incredibly dull. \\n\\nThat said, I agree with the statement that the gentleman working at the cart was by far one of the nicest people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting, and the cart itself was absolutely adorable.

Surely, such places will promote other myths of the Southern Breakfast.  There is hardly a grille or truck stop or diner between Little Rock and Portland that is not guilty of the following culinary untruths about what makes the Southern Breakfast:\\n\\n1.  Massive quantities of food\\n2.  Flavor=Salt\\n3.  Flavor=gratuitous grease\\n4.  White gravy is bland and gluey\\n5.  Biscuits are heavy, lardy, tough or either soft or hard to the touch.\\n\\nHappily, Pine State has maintained its innocence of all these crimes against decency (unless one orders beyond his consumption competence). \\n\\nTo be sure, misplaced Northern transplants and other Southerners born motherless will spend nigh on a decade of adulthood perfecting their biscuit making skills.  A good biscuit is not hard to find in its motherland; but, it is not at all easy to make one.\\n\\nI arrived ravenous and so secretly hoped PSB might be guilty of the first myth.  I ordered the Reggie Biscuit Deluxe, a monstrosity of the first order, for which I have only myself to blame.  Heaped high the RBD is fried chicken breast, bacon,  cheese, and a fried egg smothered in white gravy.  Served as a sandwich, it was a bit clownish, but the generous gravy eliminated any illusion that it should be picked up with the hands, for which I was both relieved and grateful.\\n\\nBesides the improbability of this dish as a sandwich, everything but the cheese (an unnecessary culinary offense) was impeccable.  The biscuit was wasn't heavy, nor hard, nor soft, but baked high and light and lovely.  The gravy wasn't gluey, bland, salty or greasy but peppery and, I believe, born of sausage drippings as it should be.  The bacon was cut thickish and cooked crisp and made its presence well known to the eye and tongue. The chicken was fresh-hot, moist inside and lightly crisp all around. Even the egg was right in just the right ways.\\n\\nAlas this reviewer, snobbish and jealous, and a bit defensive for his region, can find no real complaint besides the annoying cheese slice, which luckily didn't manage to really detract.  So, after many words I find myself speechless but for words of praise.  Served unstacked and sans fromage, it would be the gourmet hotel version of those delectable, divine blessings which grace the table of any proper homestead spread  proudly beneath the rebel emblem.\\n\\nJust another note.  I went to  Pine State today, a rainny Monday around 1:40pm  twenty minutes before closing, expecting the crowd to have passed.  I was so wrong.  It went from utterly full to impassibly standing room only within ten minutes.  Granted, the place is small and easily overwhelmed, but every dude with a beard within a mile seemed to need to be there simultaneously.

Overall, most of the flavors are quite smooth.\\n\\nPricing:\\nKids - $1.70\\nSmall - $3.38\\nMedium - $5.85\\nLarge - $7.25\\n\\nYou can add cones for $1+ (extra for chocolate dipped cones) and brownies for $2.50.  Toppings such as nuts, candies (Oreos, M&M's, etc.), and regular toppings (hot fudge, caramel, chocolate syrup, etc.) are 50 to 99 cents each.  Morelli's also has a variety of sundaes starting at $3.95 and up, ice cream cakes ($45-55), milkshakes, and frappes.  The menu also features some \\"Celebrity Chef Creations\\" (sundaes) by Woodfire Grill chef Kevin Gillespie.\\n\\nThe servers are friendly.  I think it's funny they have you sample the ice cream with real silverware, but when it comes to actually eating your purchased ice cream, you have to use flimsy plastic spoons."},{"name":"Buffet Palace","address":"12570 SW Center St","city":"Beaverton","stars":"2.5","text":"My husband likes this buffet better than I do, but I always find food I like and leave with a full belly! We have been here a few times. While I always find food I like, I also run into some really gross stuff here. I don't mean gross as in frog legs (which were actually tasty when I tried them), I mean gross as in \\"tastes like the sea captain's toilet\\" or no taste at all. The beauty of a buffet, however, is that you can just not eat what you do not like. \\nI like the sushi, most of it is California roll style, but the couple times we went for dinner they had nigirisushi and some pretty fresh sashimi. I also like the General Tsao's chicken and the various steamed treats they have. \\nMy 20 month old daughter eats well and we have noticed the high chairs are fairly clean. \\nThe restaurant seems to be a little grimy around the edges, though. It is a busy place, but I really wouldn't mind seeing someone sweep or vacuum under the tables between customers.  The floors look like they need a good deep cleaning, maybe the walls as well. At least the tables and seats are clean, as well as the food areas.\\nOverall, an ok place to eat. The price is good for the variety and the fact that it is not some greasy fast food crap."},{"name":"Rontoms","address":"600 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Went here for a casual drink. It wasn't super busy but it took almost ten minutes for someone to take my order, and k had to flag them down to get any acknowledgement. After a long wait for my drink, they closed out my tab immediately and never returned to check in on me. The waitresses never even looked in my direction. My drink was just awful, it tasted just like cheap gin on the rocks. Definitely not worth what I paid. I can forgive a bad drink, but completely ignored by the waitresses too? \\n\\nTo their credit, the interior was lovely and had great ambiance. Maybe hire more servers so waitress can do their job properly?"},{"name":"Jiko - The Cooking Place - Temporarily Unavailable","address":"2901 Osceola Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"The place is so nice, the staff was even better. They recommended a perfect wine pairing. I ordered the Lamb Two Ways and my wife ordered the Braised Short Ribs. Both were so delicious we cleaned our plates. That is saying a lot for my wife whom RARELY finishes a meal. The lamb was so tender and I could probably say was the best I've ever had. The Taste of Africa was ok, I was glad to try it, but would probably get something else in the future.

My family is from Mexico and I lived there as well, this food is authentic, real paisa food.  I had the steak (asada) tacos and they were good.  My friend had the Carnitas (pork) and loved it.

I had only tried two dishes when visiting from out of town - fairly \\"fatty\\" overall, but very good flavor. I  had the green curry with tofu. Overall very good, but would have appreciated more vegetables. The tofu was deep fried - not really necessary with such a rich curry base. Fried veggie rolls also greasy - but it's fried food, so to be expected. I would try again, but look for slightly lighter fare."},{"name":"Best of Szechuan","address":"15930 SW Regatta Ln","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3","text":"Ugghhh. Very difficult to land on a decisive number of stars for this rating. Like Oregon's weather, I've found the food and service @ BoS decidedly schizophrenic, w/ wild swings on either end of the continuum, in the all-important categories of taste, quality, and timeliness.\\n\\nConcerning their strengths, Best of Szechuan has a rather large and robust menu, featuring items not frequently found @ other Chinese/American eateries--- like rabbit, frog, fish morsels and intestines, lamb, flash fried flounder, salt/pepper oysters (and prawns, and scallops...)... you get the idea. As another Yeep for this place pointed out, the menu is similar in volume and breadth to the nearby \\"Taste of Sichuan\\", which had already earned my highest ratings before I discovered this place (BoS). Are these two restaurants owned/ran by the same folks...?\\n\\nReiterating the weaknesses of BoS, the main problem is one of inconsistency. Every place can have an off night every now and again, yet based on my visits here it's split right down the middle: sometimes really good, sometimes not so good, and with super slow service, to top it off. This place has the potential to be as lovely as Taste of Sichuan, I believe, only I'm not too sure I care to keep giving them more and more Mulligans until I find their sweet spot...."},{"name":"Blue Star Restaurant","address":"11 Corinth St","city":"Roslindale","stars":"3.5","text":"Great place to get breakfast, everybody is nice there, the food is always good.
