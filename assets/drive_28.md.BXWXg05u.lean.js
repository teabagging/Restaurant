We asked for the shrimp on the side (not an allergy, just a preference) and were accommodated without question.\\n\\nFor dessert, we got two. The other had chocolate in it, so I didn't have that. But I did like the mango and rice pudding dish with one note - the mango was so frozen that it was still crystalized. Maybe a little softer would have complimented the rice pudding more. Still, delicious.\\n\\nNot cheap but very good.

If you're a spice fan, simply add spicy meat to any broth. (I recommend it!)\\n\\nMy only issue--which isn't truly an issue with the food--is the size of the restaurant. It's nestled right beside a grocery store. There is a waiting list at the front register which may take a while to get through during busier hours.

Apparently they are more used to customers who come in and buy a single donut to go with a cup of coffee.

The salad was a typical mixed greens salad, but with avocados, grape tomatoes and chicken (it did not have as many ingredients as listed on the menu).  The sea bass was delicious- cooked just right (not overcooked) and the sauce complimented the fish very well.  Even at a half portion, it was very generous.  The dessert- a trio of cakes that was weirdly absent of any real chocolate (only white chocolate and some chocolate flakes on 2 of the desserts)- was disappointing though...cute in presentation but weird in taste.  Though I liked my meal, it was a mixed bag from the rest of my table- some liked theirs and for some it was not great.\\n\\nThe restaurant is inside the Renaissance Waverly hotel, diagonally across from the Cobb Energy Center.

It's nearly impossible to find, in case you haven't noticed.  \\n\\nI've had lunch and dinner here twice each and it was pretty good.  I think La Costita is especially great for happy hour, which is what I'm mostly basing my rating on, but as a family-owned restaurant, it does a good job of keeping locals content with typical American-Mexican cuisine.  In other words, I wouldn't take my Aunt Isabel here for a meal, but it satisfies the need for a Margarita and maybe a hot chimichanga after work.\\n\\nRight off the bat, they get 3 stars for happy hour.  I revere 3 things in any Mexican restaurant that claims to have a happy hour, judging on the following:\\n1) the Margaritas were divine, perfectly mixed every time!  I may very well dream about them;\\n2) the chips were probably not homemade, but they were huge, warm, and very crunchy;\\n3) I have very high standards for salsa, but their (extremely mild) salsa was pretty good for a restaurant, and it comes in a carafe!  It was cold, fresh, and tasted great after a few drinks.\\n\\nThe fourth star is a combo for service and price:\\n4a) Our waiter was one of the best I've ever had.  He kept our drinks coming with a sense of humor and friendly attitude (and even a little flirtation!), replenished our chips and salsa, and even let us borrow his lighter!  \\n4b) The happy hour prices were good.  I had 2 blended margaritas and my husband had 3 beers.  The total came to $25.\\n\\nSo I suggest you check this place out for summer happy hour, but keep cruisin' around if you want spectacular, authentic Mexican food.

I was impressed immediately with the wonderful paper napkins and the sturdy cutlery.  DH said that he  could use the napkins to change the oil in our car.  \\n\\nThe recorded background was tastefully selected and easy to listen to.   A sample of the gumbo was brought forward, as requested.  It was too hot for my tastes, but DH liked it.   So instead, I chose the beef brisket with cole slaw and corn bread.  DH had fried chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy and cole slaw - he raved about how good it was.  Likewise, the taste of the brisket was devine.  Not since I tasted Calvados and ice cream in Normandy have I been so suprised by a taste:  the spread for the biscuits is a butter/honey/whiskey blend.  Yum!  There was even a suprise in the bathroom where an old-style Boraxo powdered hand soap dispenser was in use.  \\n\\nOur waiter offered to box our leftover and return them to us - which he did, in a nice bag.

Although known for their burgers and the available craft beers, there's one thing on their menu that made more of an impact on me than their staple menu items.\\n\\nThe Place (4 out of 5) - Hopdoddy's is located in a stretch of Downtown Austin, TX where you can usually find people walking around, getting some shaved ice at a corner store, or enjoying the live music at some of the other restaurants nearby. However, as part of this strip, Hopdoddy's is dishing out delicious burgers, savory milkshakes, and refreshing beer and alcohol. There are a few Hopdoddy's in the area; however, this one is fairly decent sized with a little outdoor seating right outside its front doors. When the place is busy, you can expect to have to navigate yourself carefully so you don't run into anybody, but for the most part, it's definitely tolerable. Parking can be a bit of a pain, but if you are able to navigate yourself to the parking garage located right behind Hopdoddy's, that will probably be your best bet. In addition to their bar and their main dining room, they also cater to customers via a \\"to-go\\" window that happens to be located in the back of the restaurant. Doesn't seem like a big deal, right? Not for the most part, but when your \\"to-go\\" line is spilling out the front door, it just adds to the crowd that's already dining inside or at the bar. Again, it's not THAT big of a deal, but just expect to see more people than you normally would if you happen to come in here on a weekend, a hot day, or any busy day for that matter. There's plenty seating at the bar if you're able to snag a seat and if you're there for the main dining hall, they have everything from table tops, to tables, to booths. They definitely have a nice space here to accommodate for all types of parties and group sizes.\\n\\nThe Service (4 out of 5) - The service was nothing to write home about; however, it wasn't terrible by any means. The hostess was very prompt to greet me, and they even had a few line barkers that would venture out to the overflowing crowd lining up out the door to let them know what they needed to do and to apologize for the wait. Everyone had a smile on their face and seemed like they were genuinely happy to be there, enjoyed working together, and having fun. For me, that kind of treatment and attitude goes a long way especially if you expect people to wait in the Texas heat for some food and drinks.\\n\\nThe Food (4.5 out of 5) - The part I've been waiting to get to and for a reason other than what you may think. Everyone knows Hopdoddy's is known for their burgers, which I am a definite fan of. For my burger of choice, I went with the Llano Poblano. A perfectly cooked (for my liking) beef burger, with applewood smoked bacon, pepper jack cheese, seared poblano peppers, and a chipotle aioli. The burger had well-balanced flavors; the saltiness of the bacon, the sweetness and little spice the poblano peppers gave, and the subtle bite you get with the pepper jack cheese, and the creaminess of the aioli really rounded out the burger and definitely made it memorable. The STAR however, and is something I still think about to this day, is those darn green chile queso fries.....listen, I don't care what burger you get, get them all, they're great...all I care about is that no matter WHAT you get, you MUST get the green chile queso fries! First and foremost, I'm more of a skinny fry kind of guy so let's get that out of the way. If that's not your cup of tea, then you probably won't be raving about these as much as I am. The fries were perfectly cooked...and I mean perfectly; they had the crunch and the snap when you bite into it that's just so satisfying. NEXT, the dang green chile queso...I don't know what they put in this besides the obvious, but they must sprinkle some highly addictive narcotic in here or something because it is SO delicious and you'll just find yourself dipping fries back into it without even thinking. The green chile queso has a slight kick to it, but more importantly, it's so delectably smooth. I not only found myself dipping my fries in the queso as intended, but I may or may not have found myself dipping my burger in there too....don't judge me. \\n\\nOverall (4.5 out of 5) - Hopdoddy's is a great place to come to escape the Texas heat, indulge in a cold refreshing adult beverage, take part in a their delicious burgers, and more importantly experience the joy that is their green chile queso fries. It has a certain atmosphere to it that's enjoyable to most and welcoming to all and you'll definitely find yourself catching glimpses at other people's food and drinks as it gets served to them. The next time you're near an area with a Hopdoddy's and want some good eats, I can't help but recommend paying a visit...I know I'm looking forward to my next one!"},{"name":"Navarre","address":"10 NE 28th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Food was good...hallibut, bread with fruity oil, braised greens, fois gras, and a few other less memorable items.

Every time I go home to my parents, its now a must stop for me to pick up some Brats and Bahama Mamas for dad to grill up.  The Bratwurst is easily the best I've ever had and I didn't even have it served in the restaurant.  I can't even describe the taste adequately.  A sweeter tasting kind of brat (compared to a Johnsonville) with great flavor when prepared in beer (as instructed by the restaurant).  The Bahama Mama is their take on a Met type of spicy sausage.

With options limited due to the holiday but seating and parking limited even at 8:30pm when we arrived I can only say that what followed, in all ways, was nothing more than average and overpriced.\\n\\nBilling itself as a \\"modern caf√© elegantly designed to evoke the Parisian sentiments of Chef Thierry's native France\\" I have to say the d√©cor at Thierry was quite nice from the exterior and on entering we were greeted by large globe lights suspended from the ceiling like tear-drops, wood tables, plethoric displays of chocolates and candies, and large display cases filled with nicely arranged items all around - all of it very much like Fauchon Paris but minus the charm and the quiet as espresso machines hummed and the jam packed caf√© presented a veritable shouting match of couples trying to be heard. \\n\\nUndeterred by the cacophony and with a single two-top that seemed to be clearing my aunt and I approached the counter while my mother and sister procured a table and with a request to \\"just order whatever you like and we'll share\\" we took to the task of making our selections - four pastries, four macarons, and three drinks that would be prepared, plated, and poured quite quickly and left to our own balancing act and navigational skills to return to our table through the 2-3 inch spaces between tables.\\n\\nBeginning first with a trio of beverages my first taste of Thierry would be an awful one in the form of the single worst Americano I have ever tasted - a double shot that one could have added a half cup of sugar to and still found profoundly bitter, acidic, and unpalatable - a drink so bad that I actually returned it for a refund and opted for water instead.  Fairing slightly better, my sister's $9 Bailey's and Coffee at least acted to temper the acidity with the smoothness of the Bailey's while my Aunt's $7 Liquid Drinking Chocolate would prove by far the best beverage of the three with subtle fruity notes coming through on the palate and light caramel tones detectable on the tongue of a glass so large it was easily shared by the four of us and would have likely been far too much for one.\\n\\nMoving on to the pastries we started with a quartet of macarons in the interesting flavors of Pumpkin, Chestnut, Gingerbread, and Key Lime Macaron but unfortunately whether it was due to the late hour or to their method of preparation each was far too pasty and gummy to be truly memorable save for the Chestnut which tasted every bit its namesake with light notes of smoky sweetness and a creamy filling that tasted like chestnut pudding condensed.\\n\\nMoving on to the larger composed desserts and knowing my mother's love of lemon I ordered her a slice of the Lemon Tarte and although generally not my favorite dessert this version would actually prove to be the best thing we had all night at Thierry with the light lemon curd providing plenty of sweet to balance the sour and a light milky mouthfeel that complimented the buttery shortbread crust.\\n\\nMoving next to my selection, the Baba Savarin I was part surprised and part disappointed in this presentation for largely unrelated reasons.  Beginning first with the pastry, a well crafted baba with a spongy interior soaked to the core with simple syrup juxtaposing light and mild cream, the dish got off to a great start but where it lacked was largely in my expectation - the expectation that a proper baba should include at least some note of liquor while this particular version seemingly had none, instead adding just a touch of nuance with hints of citrus and a touch of candied tangerine.  Good, sure.  $6 good, not even close.\\n\\nFor the final tastes of the evening - both chocolate and ordered by my sister and aunt respectively - the \\"Chocolate Trio - white, dark and milk chocolate mousse\\" and \\"Chocolate Succe - hazelnut meringue, chocolate mousse and 70% chocolate ganache\\" would both prove to be alright but somewhat expected - the first a sort of mousse layer cake with various cocoa tones throughout and a crisp chocolate tuille atop and the second something like an unfrozen Klondike bar replacing the ice cream with meringue and the same mousse as the trio.  Respectable, but nothing to write home about when the bill came out at more than $60 to sit four people at a two top while listening to the girls next to us gossip about facebook."},{"name":"Lake House Bar & Grill","address":"315 N Highland St","city":"Mount Dora","stars":"3","text":"Really good food, beverages, and atmosphere, but service is either really good or really bad.

The dining room is very cute with tables that are old and look like going to grandmas.  \\n\\nI ordered the 3 PC Chicken Tenders ($12.99) with the fixins.  I had three large pieces of white meat that were coated and cooked to perfection.  My sides were mac & cheese, green beans and roasted yams with red pepper jam and served with a biscuit. The sides were fabulous.  My husband ordered the 3 PC Fried Chicken ($9.99) dark meat with green beans and bread pudding for his fixins.  \\n\\nScreech to a halt! The chicken was the tiniest pieces of chicken I have seen out at a restaurant.  Frankly the chicken leg looked as small as the drumstick of a chicken wing.

In fact, I plain lived it for the last year or so driving around various places in the US trying to track the best ones down.\\n\\nOverall, I love the branding and concept of this place. It's hip and fresh, yet maintains a traditional Parisian feel at the same time. I also like the Top Table group affiliation; I've been a longtime fan of CinCin and West.\\n\\nAfter 4 visits to Thierry's, however, I have to conclude that the atmosphere doesn't back up the product. Plain and simple, the macarons were not that great. They look cool, but the cookie is far too chewy and in some cases, the buttercream too heavy. For a local macaron, Kitchening by Carly (though more expensive and harder to find) blow these out of the water. Even Meindhardt's and Thomas Haas were much better. I would say the only macarons worse than these are perhaps the Urban Fare ones. The other thing is that for nearly $2 a pop - close in price to a much bigger cupcake - I think high expecations are valid. Macarons are not a cheap hobby.\\n\\nMacarons aside - as I believe these are hard to get right anyway - I will go on record to say that the croissants were most disappointing. For a french place, I don't understand how hard it is to make an awesome croissant! Thomas Haas croissants and pain au chocolat are a gazillion times better. Croissants at Thierry's are a slightly crumblier version of what I consider the god-awful Safeway one. And believe me, I've had plenty of croissants in my lifetime...and I regret to say that STARBUCKS (!!!) the leader in awful pastries, has a better chocolate croissant! They taste just weird and too buttery-, almost with a rubber like taste. I strongly believe Thierry's & their team are capable of creating something better, so I will give them the benefit of the doubt and hope they upgrade these ASAP. \\n\\nThe french pastries were probably the highlight, surprising for me, as as for someone with a sweet tooth, these aren't usually the desserts I go for. The triple chocolate cake was nice. The hazelnut-filled in solid chocolate was alright, though the chocolate was a bit heavy.\\n\\nThomas Haas remains king of this concept in Vancouver for now. The latte was better at Haas too, along with everything else.

The empanadas were great according to my boyfriend, just ok for me, and the fried plantain were lacking salt. We tried a few more plates and I found them all a bit underwhelming, overall. I liked the yuca fries the best. The Orinoco mojito was refreshing, and our server was awesome. Really attentive and friendly, but not invasive at all. Would definitely go back for the overall experience and curious menu, but would try an entree next time.

I typically don't complain about service, I just tip and move on and don't come back to the establishment, but when everyone in my party is making comments about how long it's taking, and making jokes about whether or not the server will be back it's not just an issue I'm facing.  I asked to speak with a manager about the issues I was facing and rather than getting with her employee privately she forced me to confront the server to explain why my party was dissatisfied. I've worked in the service industry and this has never happened at other restaurants.

The wait staff was attentive to their tables, but a smile here and there would do them some good.  I think it's due to their pace of the restaurant, but  it would definitely improve the experience.  This is not to say they're not friendly.\\n\\nI had two cocktails during my experience:  The Cream Soda and Apple Cinnamon Martini.  The Cream Soda didn't taste like a cream soda, but it was good (carried a consistency of a White Russian).  Little before the meal ended I ordered the Apple Cinnamon Martini.  It was a delicious drink that was smooth going down.  The drink was light on the palate and its aroma strongly reminded me of warm apple cider.  I would recommend this drink before the meal, as it is light and would be buried by the heavy food items on the menu. \\n\\nI ordered the Onion Rings as an appetizer which were tasty and perfectly fried.  My burger was the rBQ which was very delicious.  The meat was tender, and its natural flavors were not buried by seasoning or that common burger grease.  The bun was buttery and lightly toasted.  Unlike most burger buns that look like they were sat on at some point, these buns were nice and spongy.  The combination of meat and bun gives an enjoyable experience to each bite!  Along with the burger I ordered the tempura fried okra.  It was a perfect combination!\\n\\nThe other person in my party ordered a Krispy Kreme milk shake.

Seems like a great place to bring kids.\\n\\nIf you come here for burgers and beer, and have kids with you, you'll probably be pretty happy. The burgers are good - not as good as Tabor Tavern or Stammtisch, but pretty good. It's a pre-formed patty (clearly not hand-made, but that's OK). It was cooked medium, and was just a good, basic, juicy, greasy wet burger (even the lettuce was wet). Bacon was nicely done. The burger is satisfying, and goes well with the short but good draft list.\\n\\nThe \\"Burnside\\" meatball sandwich... not so much. The \\"meatball\\" was a slice of square patty, definitely more like a piece of meatloaf. It was firmer in texture than meatloaf, but nowhere near as flavorful as the burger. It was very garlicky, garlic was the dominant taste, and came slathered in mayonnaise on a sort of a ciabatta kind of roll. It was OK, a one-and-done, wouldn't miss it if we never had it again.\\n\\nThe fries were advertised as 'truffle fries', but also tasted heavily of garlic and salt. Basic shoestring fries with a heavy dose of the garlic and salt. Not greasy, which was nice, and good, but nothing memorable.\\n\\nThe place was very noisy because of a lot of kids there. Most of the tables seemed to have kids (this was a Saturday at lunchtime). It was a little hard to carry on a conversation because of the noise level.\\n\\nOverall, it seems like the ideal place to bring kids, and maybe even specifically designed for that - most menu items had a choice of 'small' and 'full' size. If you have kids to take out and feel like a burger, PDX Sliders will do just fine.

The DC got an old standard - eggplant parm, declaring it \\"very good\\" with the main quibble focused on the eggplant still having its skin on before frying. \\n\\nMy dish, called \\"involtino di vitello al sugo\\" was a delight, two rolled fork-tender cutlets stuffed with ham, mozzarella cheese, asparagus & roasted red peppers and smothered in red sauce. This dish was a steal @ $19 and just yummy! \\n\\nInteresting tidbit of info: the owner's brother owns Il Faro in Medford Square. I much preferred Serena to Il Faro based on a visit a number of years back. \\n\\nIMHO, North Shore foodies should consider adding this place to their rotation of red sauce style Italian.

My normal go-to was fully booked for the weekend, and after pouring over Yelp reviews I settled on Trattoria Di Monica and made a reservation for 6 on a Saturday night.  We got there a little early and were seated right away at the window which was great.\\n\\nFirst impressions:  Cozy, but well laid out restaurant, and the staff were really attentive and nice from the moment we walked in.\\n\\nFor appetizers we started out with the house bruschetta, the meatballs and a caprese salad.  Everything was okay, but nothing stood out as particularly amazing.  The meatballs were small in size (about 5 or 6 come with one order), though the sauce was delicious.  The bruschetta was a bit dry and a little boring,with just some basil and big pieces of tomato on it.  The caprese salad was solid, and the mozzarella was really delicious.  Of the 3 I'd probably only order the salad again, and maybe shoot for one of the other appetizers.  \\n\\nFor mains my brother and his girlfriend each had a special: scallops with bucatini in a spicy plum tomato sauce, and spinach ravioli with chicken in a pomodoro sauce.  I had bucatini allmatriciana off of the regular menu.  When the food came out I couldn't believe how small the portions were (this is compared to other places I've been in the North End) for the price.  This was really my main complaint with the experience.  The food itself was delicious and the homemade pasta was fantastic with the sauces.  My brother's ravioli were really flavorful, but we were all left quite hungry after finishing.  Each dish was $20-$26 which I think is average for the North End, but from my experience with other restaurants in the area I was expecting a lot more.\\n\\nThe total bill came to just over $100, which wasn't bad for the North End.  \\n\\nOverall, while the staff were friendly, the entrees good and the appetizers passable, I will probably opt to find another place to dine where I will feel more satisfied at the end of the night."},{"name":"Koji Osakaya","address":"1000 SW Broadway, Ste 110","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"I've been luck enough to meet Mr. Koji and his wife.

Bukhara is a bistro-style Indian restaurant in Jamaica Plain, on Centre Street, which is arguably the coolest part of JP. JP reminds us of home (Northampton), with its vibrancy, diversity, and eclectic opportunities. \\n\\nEveryone has a Place, or everyone who wants a Place should have a Place, and Bukhara is ours. It's where we go to feel peaceful, connected, and normal.\\n\\nWe love to sit in the front window, just near the big wooden statue of\\nBuddha and the great gold elephant with its trunk upturned. Bukhara staff members bring us lentil crackers (dal) and hot towels, and we usually get the dinner special for two, which is four courses for forty-five bucks: Mulligatawny stew, meat samosas, a tandoori meat platter, naan, tea, and two entrees - usually chicken tikka masala (mild for one of us, hot for the other) - followed by two desserts (coconut sorbet in a coconut shell for one of us, Mango Mulba sundae for me). \\n\\nThe tandoori platter that comes with the non-vegetarian dinner special for two is comprised of chicken, shrimp, and two meats that I assume are beef and lamb; it's all so tasty that I haven't stopped to think about it until this moment. The plate is so fresh from the tandoor (oven) that it sizzles from the kitchen to the table, and for several minutes afterwards. The chicken (murg) tikka masala is flavorful and creamy. The samosas are always very good, and are served with a yogurty green sauce that is very tangy. Just about everything comes with fresh lemon slices to squeeze upon it, which I really like.\\n\\nTheir decor is lovely and unpretentious. One painting on the wall is of four women playing parcheesi in a courtyard; another is of a man smoking a water pipe. The ceiling lights are hung with domed white cloth strips. A tall glass tube filled with silk orchids and water stands next to the huge Ganesha on the bar. Tapestries hang on the opposite wall, and for dinner there's always a candle on our thick resin tabletop full of embedded lentils, grains, and other beans as if trapped in amber.\\n\\nWe've eaten more dinners there than lunches, but their lunch buffet is really reasonably-priced and has a good selection of at least ten main offerings, plus tea, salad, and lentil stew. There are often babies and small children eating with their grown-ups. There are also groups of people coming in; I think the biggest I've seen was ten. The atmosphere at Bukhara is vibrant yet comfortable, and we find it good for quality alone time where we can't do anything but unplug our brains and focus on one another."},{"name":"Phoebe's Diner","address":"533 W Oltorf St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I had the brisket eggs benedict and it was the best eggs benedict i have had so far!

So Gusto is located close to our house.  One evening we decided to ride our bikes to a new place we hadn't been to and decided on Gusto since we had driven by several times and it is fairly close to our house.  The weather was gorgeous and we really wanted to sit outside.  There were tables open inside right away, but we decided to wait until an outdoor table to open up.  The area is pretty small so we ended up waiting about 30 minutes, which was fine because the outdoor area was nice, tastefully decorated, and comfortable.  They were playing an old Elvis Presley record, which I thought was nice and interesting.  \\n\\nThis is where anything nice I have to say about this place stops.  The menu is small and pales in comparison to just about every other Italian eatery I have been to on the planet.  My husband and I ended up getting a drink each and splitting a salad and a pizza and it ended up costing us $50!  The food was ok, but really nothing all that special.  The salad I would have to say was the best part as the mozzarella cheese was melt in your mouth delicious and the heirloom tomatoes were tangy and delicious.  The pizza was ok, but as I said above nothing extraordinary and definitely not worth the prices they are charging for it.  My husband tried to order us a dessert to split and although our waitress acknowledged him, she brought our check instead.  So we just paid and left.  The staff seemed friendly enough, but friendly in that \\"I'm at work so I am going to plaster a fake smile on my face and pretend to care that you are eating here\\" sort of way rather than in an interested, I really care what you think of our new pricey eatery sort of way.  Anyways, I may be being unfairly biased about this place.  If I had read the reviews or gone online to check on the menu and prices before we went I probably wouldn't be reviewing it as harshly as I am, but I also probably wouldn't have chosen to go there and eat to begin with honestly.

They had quite a few flavors and some really unique ones like green tea, lychee, and lavender. We got a small box and created a sampler pack because my wife and I don't always agree on what flavors we like best.\\n\\nOne thing I'd say, though, is don't eat them right away. We sat in the shop and had several and thought that they tasted too cold. The refrigerated unit they sit in made the creme in the middle too hard and dulled the flavor a bit. We enjoyed them, but when we tasted a few later that night after they had been out for a while, we noticed that the flavors were much more pronounced. Still very subtle, but before they had no taste, and now little hints of the flavor came out.\\n\\nWe tried two other place's macarons on this trip, and these were hands down the best of the bunch, but I'd recommend them only after they had a little time to get closer to room temperature.

The food was fresh and could tell it was just made being it was super hot and didnt taste as if it has been sitting out. My bf had soul sister which he liked as well. I will say the waffles taste good even without syrup they have a semi sweet taste to it. The staff was friendly so that was a plus. I wilk say the drinks were kinda pricey considering the size. I had Mary mint monroe which wasn't all that great, very minty which was expected but, not enough coffee taste for my liking. Maybe I will try a different coffee drink when I return.

For what it is, I think Barley Swine is perfect. They have a very sufficient wine list and no full bar but it's a great date place or a wonderful spot to take a foodie friend.

Tables are definitely awkward, as in, you can't actually get your knees under them, but the atmosphere was nice. The server explained the ordering system, and I tried to clarify that they would in fact separate checks - he assured me they would. I'll come back to this. \\n\\nWe ordered carafe (after carafe) of mojitos and they were quite tasty. My S/O and I decided to share the rotisserie chicken and get sides (including tortillas) and made our own tacos. That was plenty for us, and at about $20 for both of us, was reasonably priced. The chicken was good, flavorful and moist, the sides were pretty average, but we just had the black bean salad and brown rice. The hot sauces were really good, as was the guacamole that we had as a starter. Everyone seemed to enjoy their tacos, with the pork belly getting the best reviews. \\n\\nNow to the checks. It was in fact all brought out on one check. He expected us to split the bill (either by item or amount) and we all know how that goes. Needless to say, it took about 20 minutes to attempt that before we just split it evenly (which of course doesn't come out \\"fairly\\"). They definitely need to start splitting by seat - this practice may be a carryover from coming from NY, where check splitting is less common, but it personally drives me crazy. \\n\\nOverall, I would go back, but only for drinks and snacks - also not a place to come if you are super hungry because it can add up quickly!"},{"name":"The Painted Pin","address":"737 Miami Cir NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Excellent atmosphere, cold drinks and beautiful women.

Lot's of parking a few steps away from the entrance which is great considering the area. The place looks gorgeous and the atmosphere is well done. Set up is nice with a pretty big bar and separate dining area. It being new everything looks clean, let's hope that is consistent over time. \\n\\nLooking over the menu, I was already planning on what to get the next visit! Lot's of great looking entrees outside of tacos, enchiladas, fajitas separated by the type of protein it features (chicken, steak, seafood). Every time I try out a new Mexican place, my go to is fajitas. We weren't hungry enough for appetizers so we snacked on the chips and salsa. The chips were warm and crispy which was great. My ONLY complaint about this place was the salsa was a little too watery in my opinion. Which makes scooping the vegetables harder. \\n\\nHad the house, strawberry and passion margarita with the gf and thought it was great at a fair price. Not to sweet or salty like the surrounding franchise Mexican places which my gf and I are fed up with. After drinks and meals, you are left so thirsty and dehydrated.  I believe they dropped their margarita prices based on some other reviews but not 100% sure. If so, Joe the business manager is listening to his customers based on his attention to this website. \\n\\nThe chicken, steak and shrimp fajitas were AMAZING. Everything was all perfectly cooked. The peppers and onions surrounding it were on point. The rice, beans, sour cream, lettuce were all high quality and fresh at a fair price. Again, not crazy salty like other places, leaving you feeling good after you go. The waitress and Sal the manager were attentive and nice. Nice to see a manager help his staff with stuff like packaging left-overs or taking away plates and not just asking customers if everything was OK. I'm no restaurant owner, but I'd think that is a valuable asset in a manager. \\n\\nGreat experience overall. Will definitely be coming back, hopefully during a time when the band plays! This might be our go-to place for Mexican if everything carries over in the future.

(Probably). \\n\\nWhen you're in Portland, please just skip the 30000 hour wait outside Voodoo and just come here.

They do have better cake donuts than regular donuts, so keep that in mind. \\n\\nMy best friend and I came here EVERY DAY during out 4 day visit here, and we both LOVED it. The Orange Olive Oil was my favorite. Let me try and describe this beauty. First off, don't judge a book by it's cover, the appearance is a little unassuming. It's not the flashiest donut on the stand, but it's by far the best. (Yes we did in fact try almost all of the donuts offered while we were here). It perfectly spongy and delicate texture wise, with a wonderful kick of orange powdered sugar on the outside. The flavor is to die for, it's not too sweet, but it's got a nice distinct good olive oil taste that matches perfectly with the orange flavor. You can totally taste that they're using the best ingredients. \\n\\nOther than that, all the donuts were good. I liked the Passion Fruit Chili as well, but it does have a very strong almost fake passion fruit flavor (passion fruit is just like that). I have nothing bad to say about a single donut here. \\n\\nThe store itself is super clean, the decor is cute and the wait is never too bad. Our worst wait was on Saturday morning at about 8am, the line was out the door. But it only took about 20mins total from the start of the line to getting out donuts. \\n\\nOverall, I would make the trip back to Portland just to have these donuts again.

By the time someone that worked there was able to bring flatware the food was even colder. Upon addressing the cold food the waitress asked what she was supposed to do about it. Purchasing a decent bottle of wine, I have an expectation of the server to pour it and make sure the glass stays filled until the bottle is empty. Let me tell you, do not have any expectations of this behavior. As she also attempted to take the bottle of wine while it still had half a glass. All in all, take your money elsewhere.

The steak was delicious and well seasoned without being too salty; it was juicy, tender, and drizzled in an amazing steak sauce with a dash of sweetness.  The steak sat on a bed of really good mashed potatoes, which had chunks of potato scattered throughout.  As a whole, I was quite delighted with this entree.  I always order this medium rare.

The fried chicken was perfect - crispy on the outside, succulent on the inside, and lightly seasoned so that the sweetness of the maple syrup could cut through the savoriness.  Surprisingly, this did not feel too heavy and the syrup was not extremely sweet. \\n\\nshrimp and grits - 4 stars.  creamy and buttery grits, with Cajun spicy jumbo shrimp.  Lots of flavor, and mildly spicy.\\n\\nBBQ chicken pizza - 4 stars.  This is tasty and very similar to the BBQ chicken pizza at California Pizza Kitchen.  CPK's has a better (sweeter) crust.  Solid.\\n\\nEggs benedict - 3 stars.  This is a classic eggs benedict, but the egg was nearly fully cooked, and the hollandaise sauce was minimal.

When I arrived at BJ's there was a hockey game on all the TV's, but it was the Canadian game.  I asked for the USA game to be put on the TV and they put it on one small TV.  The last time I checked I was in America.  If they want to watch the Canadian national team play, move the restaurant to Canada.  The food was ok.  I asked the server to 86 the tomato's on my burger and guess what, the burger came with tomatoes.  It is the attention to details that would get this place a higher ranking.  Well that and playing the USA hockey game on TV at a bar in the greatest country in the world, USA!!!  I guess when USA plays this Friday, I will take a road trip to Ontario to see if I can watch them play there.  Actually, I don't have to worry about that, as USA plays Canada.  I guess we know which team BJ's will be rooting for.  Here's a hint, they go by America's hat.  In case you don't know what that means, here's another hint.

The noodles were a surprise and like nothing I've had at other local ramen places; it was rather thick and chewy, which I personally wasn't the biggest fan of. The bean sprouts were nothing special, just like in any other ramen, and the broth reminded me very much of chicken noodle soup. The beef was a fun extra and added just the nicest amount of texture. However, the crowning achievement of the ramen was absolutely the pork belly. Soft yet still retaining itself, not too much on the fat, it was absolutely fantastic. So all in all, very nice service, a good bowl of ramen with some fantastic pork, all at a good price (my bowl was 9.50 for a very filling portion).

My girlfriend previously wrote a review, but the owner's total lack of customer service and threat to sue us as strongly motivated me to write my own review.  \\n\\nAs we arrived, the restaurant staff were stood outside chatting.  It became apparent why when we entered a completely empty restaurant at 7pm on a Friday night in busy Park Ave. I should have gone with my gut feeling and moved our reservation to the busy and lively Braccia Pizzeria next door.  \\n\\nThat's first impressions out of the way, now let's talk about the below average food and service. I ordered the Zucchini Carpaccio for an appetizer $10.  When it arrived our server immediately offered salt.  I said to our server I should probably try the dish first to ensure it does not need any salt.  I'm so glad I followed my advice, as the zucchini was borderline salty.  For the main, I ordered the Snapper Poache - it was posted on the special's board $35.  I asked the server how it was presented and he told me it was a broth based dish served over fish, potatoes and vegetables.  When it arrived the server to my surprise poured out white broth into a soup bowl and served it to me leaving the overpriced snapper in the crock pot.  The end result was that I was left with a watery, tasteless broth to spoon up while the snapper was going cold and dry.  I could only stomach half of the broth, so my server came over and served my overdue fish.   As I expected, the snapper was cold and dry and the 3oz filet was not worth $35.  The overall presentation of the dish was hideous and lacked color - it was the whitest dish I have ever seen.  Unsurprisingly, we skipped dessert and asked for our checks.

The restaurant is conveniently located just a few minutes away from the 66 bus stop. Despite the short walk, I was sweating from the blazing heat and had expected to enjoy brunch in an air-conditioned Breakfast Club. Unfortunately, the heat wave continued when I arrived; I was shocked to find that there is no air condition at all. Not even a fan. As I was entering, a women loudly exclaimed that she was going to faint as she walked out the door, with her partner chasing behind.  I could definitely see why she was gonna faint. The restaurant was packed which contributed to the heat. Fortunately, I was greeted by a cup of ice water, which I refilled twice during my visit. My other friend had four cups of ice water, which he had to constantly ask the waitress to refill.\\n\\nFood wise, I ordered a Traditional Eggs Benedict, which included 2 poached eggs, English muffin, Canadian bacon, hollandaise sauce, and potatoes. I was slightly disappointed with my first poached egg since it was slightly overcooked. I love my Eggs Benedict runny!  But my second egg was cooked perfectly, with the yolk running out as I cut across the egg and muffin. I do wish that there is consistency with the poached eggs as my friend's eggs were both overcooked. \\n\\nWe also shared a Nutella Strawberry Pecan French Toast (6 pieces), which is actually off the menu. The Nutella was added on for a small charge, but they put a decent amount of Nutella on the toast. It tasted good, but nothing too special. \\n\\nOverall, the food was good. However, the heat was just unbearable as we were eating. Even with ice cold water, I was sweating, with sweat dripping down my forehead and legs. I think the Breakfast Club is a great place to have brunch during the cooler seasons, but not the summer.

Too much cilantro sounds perfect to me.  \\nI was in the mood for pozole and did a search on here and thought i'd give it a shot. If you're into a red pozole, I give this one a thumbs up. I was amazed that it had more meat than hominy  like a lot of places serve it up.  \\n\\nI specify red because places like the defunct las manitas served a white pozole and you could add chicken (more like hominy bath water IMO). This is chili powdery pork goodness, with limes, shredded cabbage and diced onions on the side. They also brought it out with some whole tostadas to crunch up in it instead of hot corn tortillas, much to my delight. I know lots of supposed authentic experts probably prefer it with rolled up corn tortillas but I like it like this.\\nI also had a scrambled eggs and barbacoa taco cuz I can't resist barbacoa. A lot of places can be hit or miss on the barbacoa, mostly because sometimes the barbacoa can be gamey.  Their barbacoa hit the spot.\\nLike a few others, I had excellent service...until that final \\"do you have everything you need?\\" question. I think it depends on the waitress.

A nice list of wines to try and our waitress was fairly knowledgeable of the offerings and able to make a few great recommendations based on what we said we were looking for.

Next up, they have a basket with a couple different kinds of rolls, green beans with bacon, mashed potatoes, and soups (the potato is great!). The hot bar has a sampling of all their homemade sausages: garlic, Bahama Mama (hot and mild), mets and brats. They have a really delicious stew with sausage, peppers and pasta. On the opposite side they have mac and cheese, fried chicken, kraut, red cabbage and German potato salad. There's probably more I'm forgetting but this is what I come for! I have had the lunch buffet ($10) and it's just as good but there was no fried chicken. Which is fine with me because I come to eat my weight in sausage and potatoes and cabbage, lol. We have tried the pretzel nuggets too. The portion was huge and they were super soft and  tasty!   I've never tasted anything at Schmidt's I didn't love.\\n\\nYou can't leave without trying a cream puff. They have vanilla, chocolate and peanut butter (my favorite) year round and there are seasonal flavors too. The puff is just a standard cream puff but it's huge! HUGE! It's every bit as big as a softball. The filling is super yummy and if they told me it was made with homemade whipped cream I wouldn't be surprised.

We ordered paneer naan, samosas, the lamb vindaloo, and the Baingan Bhartha. I was nervous about the heat level, so we ordered medium heat. I've eaten lamb vindaloo at other restaurants where I could not handle the hottest one, but to my surprise the medium wasn't as spicy as I wanted. The waiters came over asked if I liked how spicy it was, and after telling them I was expecting it to be spicier they offered up to switch out the dish (which was half eaten already) for the hotter one. So I must say the service was excellent, and the food was awesome. I definitely would get the Baingan Bhartha, an eggplant dish, again.

It has a 4 Star review on yelp and frankly, I can't understand why. I almost gave it 2 stars because the service was good. The gentlemen with the steak kept coming back out quickly. Unfortunately the quality of the food kept it at a one.\\n\\nI'll admit I tried cutting corners and saving money by coming here instead of Fogo De chao or Texas de Brazil, and I wish I wouldn't have. The meat had no flavor. I was little dunking my pieces of meat in the chimichurri sauce from the buffet. Some pieces were also severely over cooked like the lamb, the lamb unfortunately was not edible.\\n\\nOh, and the buffet - No. just no. The beef in brown gravy and the chicken with vegetables were edible, but the rest of it - not really. The sodas here are also poured out of 2 liter bottles. In my experience, any restaurant that uses 2 liter bottles for their sodas is probably not gonna be that great.\\n\\nSo with bland over cooked meat and limited options (that weren't that good) on the buffet I gotta say nope, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.

I've never had a meal at Navarre when I and my co-diners didn't have at least one all-consuming OMG OMG OMG experience.  Last night it was the halibut.  I swear, I think my friend from Canada was going to cry when she took her first bite. It was that good--perfectly cooked and topped with a superlative garlic sauce. Everything else was delicious, too (we had purple beans with cherries, radishes with french butter, steak, and crab cakes), but the halibut was manna.  \\nTo drink I had to try a glass of the Pink Floyd pink wine.  Apparently, The Floyd recorded an LP in a French vineyard, and that's where the wine is from.  Since I love (old) Floyd, and had just been listening to The Flaming Lips version of Dark Side Of The Moon on the drive over, it seemed fitting to give it a whirl.  Sadly, I didn't care for it, so I switched to the red wine my friends were guzzling by the bottle.\\nI don't usually order dessert at Navarre (although I always ogle the baked goods at the counter), but last night was a special occasion, so we opted for one chocolate mousse and four spoons.  The mousse was perfection, and topped with a huge plop of real whipped cream.\\nMy only complaint with Navarre is the noise level.  The place was slammin' last night and I wound up putting in one ear plug just to buffer it a bit.  But noise is a common gripe for me when dining in this town.

I was also impressed that it gave me a 20 minute \\"your food will be ready\\" notification as I had ordered several entrees and dessert.\\n\\nI had a few errands to run, so I actually arrived about 35 minutes after I ordered, and was met with a blank look from the hostess.

All spectacular. The Boy and Yelp have yet to disappoint me. Unfortunately we got here too late for the breakfast but all my fault. It's hard to get up early on vacation. \\n\\nThe ambiance was retro but classy. Very hipster. The waitress and waiter were very friendly and accommodating. We got seated towards the back. We didn't have to wait long to get our order in. Everything came in good time. It was a no-rush attitude in here and I dug it. It was a place I could just chill, relax, chat up the waiters & waitresses and not feel rushed to leave. Nice vibe. \\n\\nAs for food, they have 3 dishes that they serve all day and luckily for The Boy, Fricasse was one of 'em. I'm a vegetarian so the menu was a bit more limiting than some of the other places I've been to. I did have a good handful of choices, though. I haven't had grilled haloumi cheese in such a long time so I chose Les Boulettes despite the olive & rosemary sourdough. I hate olives. \\n\\nLet me start with reviewing the food and then finish my review off with our drinks. The Boy has been here several times and loves the Fricasse. I'll take his word & the word of other yelpers on that. It certainly looked delicious.\\n\\n As for my food, it was quite good and quite filling. There were 4 large pieces of sourdough with different toppings on each. The haloumi cheese was as good as I remember.  I like to eat the best part last so it's the taste I remember the most. I took a bite of this and immediately saved it for the end. For those who don't know, haloumi is like a saltier mozzarella that tastes much better when it's warm. The marinated shredded carrot salad was sweet and refreshing. I am not a huge fan of tabbouleh and often leave it untouched when I eat at falafel places. But this was one of the better ones I've had and I ate the entire thing. The hummus came topped with a cucumber tomato mixture, if memory serves correctly. It was a perfect light lunch on a relaxing weekday afternoon. \\n\\nNow, lets get to the star of my experience...the lattes. I like lattes. I love coffee. I like all different types for different reasons. Sometimes I'm in it for the taste. Sometimes I'm in it for the kick in the a$$ it gives me. I don't like it too sweet but I do put a little raw sugar and milk into my drinks. I'm not a huge fan of strange things in my coffee or espresso but everyone was raving about these drinks ... including the boy ... so I just had to try one. I fought my better judgement and went for what I thought would be the strongest and the most interesting. I don't really like fruit + coffee mixed together so I dismissed the raspberry and opted for the lavender soy latte. He got a white chocolate pistachio mocha. \\n\\nI took one sip of that lavender latte and I instinctively let out this loud moan of pleasure. Not to be dramatic but I'm positive time stopped for just a moment. I'm sure I startled some people around me...or maybe they're used it by now? If I were to taste this on its own, I would not be able to tell it was lavender. I wish everything lavender tasted like this. It was all I could do to sip and savor and not chug it like I really wanted to. It was just so damn good. I don't want to go on and on about it because I think plenty of people already have and it's really making me upset that I'm so far away from it. I'll just end my rave there.\\n\\nWe came back the next day after brunch (my last day in vancouver) JUST for this lavender latte. I went on an epic journey for an HSBC bank because I needed cash (turns out Google Maps needs to update their information) and even though we walked for probably an hour, my heart was set on getting this lavendar latte so we continued our trek there. We made it with 15 minutes to spare. The waitress remembered us and welcomed us back. My eyes were wild with longing. All I could think was lavendar latte lavendar latte lavendar latte. I was half panicked when she said something about them closing in 15 minutes. I didn't hear what she said the first time and barely understood the second time. I felt like a babbling idiot and just wanted to reach out my hand and shout out \\"LAVENDAR SOY LATTE GIMME!!\\" Luckily they were still serving drinks & waffles.

Ya know, where they eat like worms and stuff. Ok, ok. I never really thought it would be that bad. But, well. Alright, I guess I have no excuse.\\n\\nFortunately, last year a friend of mine forced me at gun point to try Sarovar. As I looked over the menu, all my skeptiscim melted away. This looked fantastic! Chicken, beef, rice, I could do this! And it was so delicious. Since then I've also tried Star of India on Andreson Ln and found it to be just as tasty. \\n\\nFinally I was ready to try some fancified Indian food at the highly revered Clay Pit. \\n\\nI met a date (or friend?) for dinner here on a Wednesday evening and we were seated right away. It was just the right amount of busy; plenty of people but no wait. \\n\\nThe interior is an aesthetically-pleasing, elongated room, chock fulla' good feng shui. The waiter was friendly and promptly brought us the Indian equivalent of chips and salsa, while we looked over the menu. (It was basically a basket of over-sized crackers that you could break up and dip in two different sauces - whatever it was, it was delicious!)\\n\\nThere were so many promising choices on the menu that I had a bit of trouble making up my mind. I already knew I was going to have to come back, so for my first visit I decided to go straight for the curry. There are many currys to chose from so I went with \\"everyone's favorite,\\" the Tikka Masala, medium spicy, over chicken breast. I also put in an order for a bowl of the spicy Mulligatawny Soup, described as 'delicately spiced vegetables, apples & chicken breast with a hint of lemon.' My friend-date, a Clay Pit enthusiast, had also ordered the Tikka Masala, only mild.\\n\\nThe soup was absolutely savory with just the right amount of spice. When he brought out our entrees, he seemed sure which was which, but we ended up with each other's anyway. Oops, I thought, as I was already enjoying his mild curry. When I switched over to the medium spice, I was glad I didn't go any spicier! The Tikka Masala is a tomato-based butter cream sauce seasoned with herbs & spices, and it's damn hard to resist. I poured it over white rice and devoured as much as I could. By the end of the meal I could already feel my digestive system trying to figure out how to process all that spice. Now I know why he went for the mild... \\n\\nSo, yeah.

Some of the best dim sum we've ever had. The turnip cakes were particularly nice, and I love sweet tofu, and theirs was good, served in its own container. The items we had that were not on the dim sum menu (things that were brought around on trays) were okay. The pea shoots were far better than the spicy tofu, in my opinion. There was only one sour note. There was one item on the carts that we had never seen before, so of course, we tried it. It turned out to a type of shrimp toast, I'm guessing, but steamed. The toast layer was, according to my husband, very blah. It came very late in the meal, and I was too full to try it.\\n\\nService was nice. There was one sullen manager, but he was prompt when asked for things. And they took our tea order immediately (hurray for chrysanthemum tea!). In fact, two people asked after our tea seconds within being seated.\\n\\nParking is heinous. There are less than ten spaces, I think, in front of the restaurant, and they were full at 10:30 when we arrived this morning. And you can't park on 38th. Residents only. So we parked on Gladstone. Could be worse, I know, but...\\n\\nAnd it's not cheap. Even with the discount (which was marked on the bill as ten percent, in English and in Chinese, but numerically was only five percent), it came out, including tip, to more than $50 for the two of us.

Heard so many great things, so today the wife and I took the trek out to East Austin to come grab some tacos. They're really fast about making the tacos and having them out but its clearly freshly made.\\n\\nWe tried the fish taco, an al pastor, and two migas tacos with a watermelon agua fresca. Gotta say these are really good. The migas particularly you can tell they make it with a lot of pride - freshly fried tortilla strips make a world of difference in the tacos. The egg and avocado play backseat to that in a nice textural medley. Add some of their smoky salsa and you're good to go. Hard to believe something that good could be vegetarian.\\n\\nThe fish taco is also pretty good - rare to have a non-fried fish taco, but it tastes clean, not too salty with the cabbage providing the crunch. The al pastor comes topped with avocado too - not used to that, but it has definite smoky notes. I wish there was a bit more charring on the al pastor though - it tastes more strongly of braised pork shoulder than it does with the crispy edgy bits that I've come to love on it.\\n\\nAgua fresca comes in a big gulp type cup and it's fresh as can be. Not too sweet and about as refreshing as it gets especially as Austin approaches summer.\\n\\nThat said, great as these tacos are, contrary to what some other reviews say, they're not actually all that big.

So I suggest calling them before coming and putting your name on the wait list if you are sensitive about the waiting duration. \\n\\nFor people not accustomed with the Ethiopian cuisine, it is a unique culmination of centuries long influence from Mediterranean, Arabic and the indigineous African tastes.

This is our third visit, and each time we have had concerning encounters with incompetent valets (disorganized, leaving key fobs on the tires of cars instead of a lock box), unprofessional employees, and management that seems indifferent to our concerns. Last night, a group of us decided to give it another shot (because, like many other reviewers, we do love the atmosphere and the games that are available here - it should be a fun place!). \\n\\nDerrick, the \\"security\\" guard at the front desk, was immediately off-putting with his affect towards us. We didn't know the dress code, so some of the guys in our group of friends wore hats. But hey, that's easy enough to fix, they can take them off. Right? No. He proceeded to tell us that the guys couldn't wear shorts (not in The Painted Pin's policies per their website), and that one of the ladies couldn't enter due to the leather leggings she was wearing, because his perception was that they were \\"athletic wear\\". \\n\\nWe tried to reason with him, and asked to speak to a manager. He told us that we \\"could call the manager\\" and refused several times to give us his name. He told us that we \\"needed to leave before he got physical\\" (mind you, he said this to two WOMEN), and that \\"we could tell management, they don't do anything anyways\\". He was unreasonable, unfriendly, and what's most concerning, very aggressive.\\n\\nNeedless to say, we escalated it to the manager, Jessica, who was very attentive and reassured us that she would discuss the interaction with the employee. We can only hope that it is truly addressed with him so that no one else has to have such a degrading experience. I wish I could say that we will return to The Painted Pin, but this experience really seals in the fact that is a poorly run establishment that offers an environment for their employees to treat patrons badly."},{"name":"Gurkha Himalayan Kitchen","address":"1141 Davie Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"We went here last night, just walked in, had really good food.

I ordered peppers, onions, and mushrooms with hardly any mush or onions with many pieces just cheese.  Aside from that, the pizza has an amazing taste without a doubt which is what infuriates me bc that's why people put up with all the bs but where do you draw the line?  Wasn't even gonna bother writing anything here simply bc it probably is a huge waste of time since the ownership probably doesn't care given the overall attitude allowed and people love their pizza willing to put up with whatever shitty service comes their way.

The al pastor was full of meat but ultimately pretty unwhelming and lacked the punch of spice and pineapple that I'd expect from an al pastor taco (I also bit into a piece of bone, which was unpleasant). Al pastor are my favorite tacos and these don't beat any al pastor that you could find inside of a carneceria that serves food. The Migas Poblanas was big and tasty and would make for a nice, quick, breakfast. Overall though, this didn't seem like anything out of the ordinary when it comes to a taco truck, I'm not sure I understand the hype.

If you're a beer-drinking sports fan who doesn't mind mediocre food, this is the place for you. The menu is hit or miss (mostly miss). I've had potato skins at this place that taste like they'd been waiting two years in the deep freeze before being exhumed, microwaved to within an inch of their life and then coated in a layer of cheddar before being presented to me as edible foodstuff.\\n\\nThe tvs are often louder than they need to be - even for a sports bar - making group conversation somewhat challenging. The beer selection is decent, as is the service, but without a fresher, more predictable and well-prepared meal, it's difficult to make an afternoon or night out of going to the Tavern. I recommend eating before you go, and just planning to share some drinks while you watch a game with friends.\\n\\n4/20/13 UPDATE:\\nI keep trying to give this place a chance, hoping it will get better.

I ordered the ahi tuna, because I'd identified it in the past as being one of a few items on the menu that I could count on being fresh. Problem was, I couldn't. When our food arrived, the salad under the tuna was quite lovely, fresh and tasty. The tuna on top, however, tasted like it had been sitting in the walk-in for over a week before they crusted it with old sesame seeds, waved it over a hot pan and served it to me. Our server was kind and lovely (I've NEVER had a problem with service here...just with food quality). She took the fish away, but let me keep the salad to munch on while I waited for a new piece of fish. While I was waiting for it, I realized I had probably made a mistake letting them cook me a second piece of fish, since it wasn't the preparation that was faulty, but the age/quallity of the fish. Sure enough, when tuna steak #2 arrived, it was as awful as the first. The manager did take $5 off our final bill, charging me only for what a green salad would have cost,.

Have you guys not had GOOD Ethiopian food or are your taste buds that bland from all the bland food you eat on the daily? This food (I had veggie platter and some fake vegetarian tibs) was sub par to that of actual good traditional, authentic Ethiopian cuisine. There was a lot of Heinz tomato sauce used in just about everything. After spending x amount of years living with a chef, you start to taste the ingredients individually. I was not impressed. I'm assuming based on their clientele they've dumbed down the spicy factor as well because nothing was to the extent of hot as it should have been. That alone killed the experience for me. The water downed heat/spiciness. It wasn't terrible but it was not worthy of a five star rating which I'm seeing as a trend here. And comparing it to Desta? Hands down the best, most authentic, and traditional Ethiopian food is at Queen of Sheba. Star quality, full bar, love traditional Ethiopian music/performances.

Inherently not a bad thing, but I had figured the point was variety, as each sandwich is inspired by a different chef. But I guess they just gave each chef a box to work with, and every box had the bacon wrapped in gold leaf with 10000 bonus points for use.

Santarpios pizza IS NOT the same as Reginas and before you say that they are how can a pizza where the toppings go on first then the cheese and THEN the sauce be the same you are mistaken.  Some people think that the service is terrible but that is what I liked about the place. we didn't see a menu but we knew what we wanted.  45 Minutes for a cheese pie?  That I have a problem with. Oh and they only have one size.  The cheese and sauce are good, but what ruins the pie is the dough.  WAY too chewy.

Simplicity and perfectly thin, steaming hot, delicious pizza. There's no need for fancy decor, the pizza is what you come here for. Or the skewers that are cooked over an open BBQ pit right behind the bar. My personal preference when coming here is to sit at the bar. It allows for you to meet some new people and you never know when it'll turn into an excellent dinner experience with a stranger. \\n\\nPizza is thin and crunchy, with a variety of toppings to choose from. My personal preference is mushroom only, but I've had the pepperoni and it is perfect with the pieces getting just crunchy enough around the edges. If you order the meat skewer you'll get it served with bread and cherry peppers. My recommendation? Split a pizza with someone and a skewer or two. Best of both worlds! \\n\\nBasic bar service with some hard liquor, various bottled beer and white or red house wine. Order a carafe and enjoy the evening. The prices are really reasonable and the food is simply fantastic. \\n\\nThis is an old school place so they only accept cash. Expect to wait on a Friday or Saturday night. \\n\\nOne of the beautiful things about this place I noticed? While in this day and age most people are glued to their cell phones, not one person in this place was when I dined there the other night. It has a family style atmosphere and makes you actually want to put your phone down and have a conversation.

Now, onto the food...there was quite a large amount of entrees to choose including donut sandwiches, brunch items, and dessert donuts. \\n\\nI ordered El Diablo and the Dirty Harry which was more than enough to feed my sister and I. El Diablo reminded me of a somewhat spicy egg benedict dish. The donut was really fluffy and my sister thought it was spicy (I couldn't tell). The flavours of the dish didn't leave an impression on me except for the fluffy donut. As a coconut lover, I was super excited to try the Dirty Harry. However, I couldn't take more than one bite because the sweetness was overwhelming. The donut holes were fluffy though. \\n\\nI sampled a few of the other dishes and I did like the chicken fried steak one. The meat was tasty and juicy so if I come here next time, I would probably stick to this part of the menu. With the Freedird and donut pudding, they were also quite sweet and I couldn't eat it.

This incident just caught me on the wrong day. (Also- I LOVE the ponce/old fourth ward location and have never had any issues over there). \\n\\nI asked pleasantly if they could ice one of the herbal tea bags for me.  Places generally do this, but I know it's kind of a pain, that's why I ASKED FIRST.  The lady says yes, tells me to pick my tea (displayed near the register) and goes to finish the drink she is making.  As I wait for her to finish another lady comes up and says \\"We have an iced green tea already made, if you'd like that.  It's really good.\\"  Nice and pleasant.  I ask if it's caffeinated, because I really can't handle caffeine past around 11 am and it's after 3.  She says yes, slightly caffeinated.  I hesitate, clearly uncomfortable, I hate putting extra stress on service industry workers (being one myself) and am trying to decide if I should just do a decaf coffee.  But it's 90 degrees out today and if possible I'd like something cold.  I ask very sheepishly if it would be alright to still get the herbal tea bag iced.\\n\\n  \\"..... Um, yeah, that's fine.\\" She's visibly irritated and has become borderline rude.  I know this tactic because I have used it myself as a server, so maybe this is karma coming back to haunt me.  It's used to let the customer know that they are inconveniencing you, to try and make them feel bad.\\n\\nI tell her it's alright, I will just go with the green tea, and hurry to put back the tea bags.  She gives me some explanation about how it makes inventory more difficult and takes longer to steep (which of course it does), but that she'd be happy to do the caffeine free if that's what I want. Yes, I am sure you're HAPPY to... that's why you turned on the snootiness.\\n\\nIf it's putting you out, making things difficult for the employees, holding up the line (there was none), just SAY NO.  I would not be offended to be told that they only have one type of iced tea.  For God's sake.   I just can't abide passive aggressiveness.  Not over a stupid cup of iced tea.\\n\\n\\nLike I said, a pretty minor incident, and maybe she's just been icing too many tea bags today and can't handle another one, I don't know.

It had layers of flavors. \\n\\nI am always a huge fan of eating avocado toast to start off your day and their avocado toast was very satisfying!

Ask for the 'Special pizza' which is Sopressata with banana peppers and eggs. It's not on the menu, but it's a perfect combination. We've had pretty much every pizza on the menu from Buffalo Chicken (good) to Clam (good but not my thing) to the mushroom with eggs (AMAZING). \\n\\nThey also often have a featured special, and they are always great.

The bread is freshly made (you can see the workers rolling out the dough and grilling it over the fire). Bread had great texture and was lightly coated in olive oil. The falafel was good, not the best I've had (a bit dry), but did taste better with the additional toppings. It seems like you can add as many toppings as you want- which is awesome, except their portions of babaganoush was a bit sparse. I'll definitely go back for the food. It might not be the best Isreali falafel place, but its tastes good enough and everything is obviously freshly made and tastes that way. \\n\\nSecond is the wait. I'm always willing to wait for great food, however by the time I reached the counter, I felt that a reason for the long line was a result of inefficiency. Being that this place literally just opened a few weeks ago, I hope the management will smooth things out. Currently it works very similar to Subway: you (finally) get to the counter and you place your order (minus the toppings). Then, you scoot on over to another line, where the guys behind the counter assemble your order with the specific toppings. This is where the delay is because there are a variety of options (great), but I noticed many patrons were asking a bunch of questions since they weren't familiar or just kind of mulling over which things to add. There is a placard once you reach the counter that describe the ingredients, so I would suggest patrons to read this first, and have their decisions ready to go. Assuming Yalla continues with its current popularity, I would hope ultimately when you place your order, you also order the toppings so the workers can go ahead and start putting together the order (which really takes only a few min scooping into pita/bowl). This is how Taim (one of the most popular falafel places in NYC) run and the wait is perfectly acceptable.\\n\\nOverall, I think this place is worth a try (maybe not worth the long 30 min wait time). I'm definitely come back to Krog Street Market, but will probably check out the other  eateries (they looked good) first before returning to Yalla."},{"name":"Hooters","address":"209 Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"Boneless wings sucked.

Mooyah is A-OK, but after a recent excursion to a direct competitor near campus, I'm bumping them up to four stars.  The \\"Hi, Welcome to Mooby's\\" chant greets everyone that walks in the door, slightly annoying if you're trying to enjoy a leisurely lunch, but whatevs.  I always opt for the smaller burger size, but it always seems endlessly messy... grab lots of napkins.  I really like the toppings are free style and they certainly have a lot to choose from, you kind of have to know what you want when you go in.  I dig the fries.  On my first visit, they were a little oversalted (esp. after my partner decided to add more, without tasting them first), but greasy, tasty goodness nonetheless.

Unfortunately, it took me just that long to get back down to Orlando AND be able to visit this place and I'm very happy that I did. I had my plan set-get off the plane, pick up the rental and drive straight to the Coop for breakfast. Unfortunately my plane was delayed and we weren't arriving until early afternoon, but fortunately it was Thursday and they served breakfast all day! It's a good 20-25 minute ride from the airport but it was worth it. \\n\\nI debated between sticking with the tried and true chicken and waffles or something else but I listened to my craving and also ordered a side of collard greens. The set-up is relatively simple, the food is hot, the atmosphere is relaxed and the sweet tea is delicious. Since it was the middle of the week and the middle of the day, it was fairly empty-maybe 3 tables of customers so I had my share of seats. I opted to sit in the back room, just because the main room had bigger tables (to sit 5 or 6 easily). Condiments on the table (hot sauce, ketchup, syrup, tabasco) and the drinks were self-serve. They also had self-serve to-go containers, which was helpful because I didn't finish half of my food. \\n\\nOnto the food-the chicken pieces were huge. I ordered a leg and a thigh, very flavorful. Funny enough, the chicken looked very crispy (almost hard) but it wasn't at all. The waffles were melt in your mouth delicious and the slice of watermelon served with it just topped it all off (and it was very sweet!). The collard greens were a bit flavorless...they definitely used smoked meat as you could see the bits throughout the greens, which I loved (honestly not sure if it was turkey or pork). But, the greens just lacked seasoning...that's ok though, I know how to doctor up some greens-added some butter and hot sauce and they were a bit better. I contemplated getting dessert because the individual banana pudding in the jar looked irresistible but I held off, just in case I got full...and I did. \\n\\nService was very pleasant and it honestly felt like you stopped by your friend's house for a quick bite to eat and relax. I really enjoyed the atmosphere, especially being from NY-I can truly appreciate a southern restaurant that does both food and atmosphere well.

Crabcakes were all crab and no filler, while calamari were lightly breaded and incredibly soft and tender.\\n\\nMains:\\n* Four of us got their signature dish: Miso-Maple Sablefish (aka Black Cod, though Sablefish sounds better and is technically the correct name) with sake-braised leeks and mashed potatoes with chives and bacon.  Fish had nice sweetness but was not overly rich like miso butterfish you might find at other places.  It still had soft, mild texture like sea bass. \\n\\nDesserts:\\n* Key Lime pie had this amazing coconut-flavored cream that really played well with the tart lime flavor and sweet, cookie-crumb pie crust.

The pizza is just hands down the best I have ever had. I drive from Beverly, MA to go here and fight the traffic and parking and wait in line without complaint. They only sell pizza and grilled lamb and sausage. You can get the lamb and sausage as a single lamb, single sausage or a combo lamb plus sausage and these, like the pizza are out of this world. Pizza is just one small size but priced right and well worth every penny. Thin crust with a secret tomato sauce.\\n\\nNote: They just opened a new location on the North Shore in Peabody on Rt. 1 (where Bennigans used to be). It's been mobbed since they opened two weeks ago but we finally got there this past Friday. We arrived at about 5:15 and waited 15 minutes to be seated. It's bigger than the East Boston location and they have larger tables which is really nice. It's quieter as well but I do miss the gruff (mostly male) waiters at the East Boston location some of those guys have been working there far as long as I have been going. Anyway back to the Peabody location. The pizza here still needs a little work. I found the crust was a bit thicker than the Boston store and it was not as thoroughly cooked. I love the bit of crunchiness that I am used to from Santarpios. Our pizza also came out warm and not really hot. We could basically eat it right away instead of having to wait a while. I think this might be due to the fact that they are still super busy and super crowded. I am hoping that the pizza will get better as things get settled there. The pizza tasted delicious by the way it was just the temperature and the texture that were different the taste was still as good as it gets. We also ordered the lamb which was no different from the Boston location and was delicious as well. Maybe knock off half a star for the Peabody location for now."},{"name":"Punjab Palace","address":"109 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"First things first: phenomenal service.

This was better. I've always loved asparagus but it was if I'd just discovered this vegetable and its ridiculous goodness. Normally I avoid bread but was delighted to have some available to soak up the last molecule of the soup. The halibut was probably the best version of this fish I've ever tasted, and it's my favourite fish. From the amuse bouche intricacy of mushrooms, from crunchy to incredibly smooth, the chef used texture in the most intriguing way I've encountered in my serious pursuit of exquisite cuisine. Halibut is usually a solid, meaty fish but this time, blended with bean puree, sauce vierge and other levels of  complexity between liquid and solid, it made me aware of my favourite fish in a new way.

The veggie plate also included collard greens, salad, and shiro. All three weren't bad, but I've had better. There were decent portion sizes including the injera. I also had the vegan spicy tibs. They weren't bad, but nothing exciting that I would want to order again. I am not sure which item it was that I ate, but something had a LOT of salt in it as I experienced some significant water retention issues immediately afterwards.

I am a fan of Top Chef and was rooting hard for chef Richard Blais all through the season since he was our hometown boy repping the A.  I am a big burger fan and I was excited to hear about Blais opening up this burger boutique.  I finally made it over there with my Dad on our way back from the Masters and I was treated to some things that I don't usually like flipped in a way that had me hungry for more!  I generally am not a fan of mayonnaise or ketchup, but the homemade romesco ketchup and smoked mayo were outstanding, especially the mayo.  I was dipping my fries in it it was so good.  The fries were fresh cut and really good, as they should have been for $3 a la carte.  The first time I was there I went with the Tartare Burger and it was crazy good.  I love beef tartare and this thing was just perfect.  So perfect I even ate it with the little pickled onions and I hate onions normally.  The second time I went I had the Southern Burger (country fried burger - yep, you read that right -, pimiento cheese & green tomato ketchup) which was also very good, but the Tartare Burger is still the standout for me so far.  We also tries the Krispy Kreme milkshake (made with liquid nitrogen for weirdness) and that thing was about what you would expect liquid doughnuts to taste like.  Overall, a great experience and my girlfriend proclaimed the Bacon Cheeseburger she got as the best burger she'd ever had so you gotta love when the food makes the lady happy, that's for sure.  The decor is really cool and the food matches the environment, both in taste and presentation.  Although everything is a la carte, the prices are reasonable as well.

The appetizers were actually quite good and it was a good start....   the salmon flat bread was great, mussels were cooked well, poutine was delish... calamari was good.... it all seemed to appear like we were going to have a great meal.   I was with a large group and I do understand the complications with serving a large group.  However, the wait staff should know when specials are limited in quantity.   Several of us at the table ordered the special.  Approximately thirty minutes after we ordered our meal we were told they were out of the special.   Not cool.  Five minutes after we ordered that might have been ok... but 30 minutes... really?!?  Once our main courses arrived I noticed every single plate ordered (salmon, scallops, cod) were all served on a bed of beans.... not exactly creative.   If the beans were outstanding I might understand why they plate as such...  but the beans were horrible.   Undercooked.... not much flavor... boring and bland.   I ordered salmon, what one might consider a safe bet in Vancouver, however it was as dry as a bone under the Phoenix sun in July.  Horrible.   I would have sent it back but I was with a large group and just ate what I could off the plate.  One of my coworkers did not even eat his as it was just way too dry.

My first reaction was, \\"What the #$^(#$ is this $#(&#($?\\"  Now, I'm giving this place 5 stars, and making it one of my mandatory stops when I drive through Austin.  I've come a long way, baby.\\n\\nFirst, let me clarify:  I love Mangia's stuffed pizza.  Somewhere along the way, they decided to also try to make a thin-crust pizza, but it is horrible.  Sure, there are some goofy specialty thin-crust pizzas like BBQ chicken with County Line BBQ sauce, but they aren't much better than Papa Johns.  Stick with what Mangia does best:  The stuffed pizzas.  Also, I have seldom eaten-in at any Mangia location, so I cannot speak to the serivce, etc.\\n\\nOn this last visit, I ordered a medium Veggie and a medium Mangia Mia (my favorite) stuffed pie with whole wheat crust.  To go.  About 35 minutes and 56 bucks (!) later, I had my beloved Mangia Pies.  For this review, I then evaluated the 3 critical parts of the pizza:\\n\\n1.  The crust.  Unlike a previous reviewer, I have never gotten a soggy crust from this Mangia location or any other (I've only ever really gone to this one and to the one on Lake Austin Blvd.)  The crust was wheaty, crispy, crunchy, and flavorful.\\n\\n2.  The sauce.  Mangia has a great, flavorful sauce.  Even when I first tried Mangia and didn't appreciate it, the sauce caught my attention as exceptional.\\n\\n3.  The toppings (fillings, in this case.)  Mangia makes a really great veggie pizza.  The veggies are fresh and crisp, but cooked right.  I wish that they put tomatoes on top like the do the Mangia Mia.  I love the Mangia Mia too (basically their \\"everything pizza,\\") and they have great flavorful sausage.  Their spinach pie (their signature pie) is great, but I only get to have that one when I eat there without my wife, because she doesn't like spinach.  Basically, any one of their specialty/signature pies is great, like the carnivore, and the one with broccoli (I forget what they call that one,) etc.\\n\\nI may not be the best judge of thick-crust (Chicago style?) pizza, since I've only ever been to Chicago once.  While I was changing trains (or transferring planes at OHare.)  For a grand total of 4 hours.  However, I know a good and tasty pizza pie when I eat one (even if it takes a little getting used to for a thin-crust pizza snob like me,) and Mangia serves up some tasty stuffed pies.  A little expensive, but very tasty nonetheless."},{"name":"Phoebe's Diner","address":"533 W Oltorf St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Thankful for such a wonderful place to end our visit with our daughter Kelsey.

She was a trip and a half and so much fun to have as our waitress for the evening.  She was delightful and made helpful menu suggestions and friendly enough without being intrusive. Unfortunately, it sounds like she only works on Fridays.\\n\\nThe atmosphere needs a little bit of work - it seems a bit sparse inside and looking for an identity.  The space is on the smallish side, and it did get louder as it got full, but no so as you couldn't watch TV or talk to your friends.\\n\\nThe food.  We ordered:\\nCrab Fritters\\nVodka-Beer Battered Fried Pickles with Dill Ranch\\nFried Oysters with with Sweet Bell Pepper Drizzle and Remoulade\\nBraised Short Rib with Turnip Green Flan and Butternut Squash\\nGrilled Shrimp with Angel Hair\\nCrawfish √âtouff√©e over Cheddar & Poblano Grit Cakes\\nBrussels Sprouts\\nGreen Beans\\n\\nMy items were the pickles (OMG, I wish I could classify this has a fritter I am such a fan), the oysters and the short rib.  After a couple of hours there, we had ordered 3 (maybe even 4) orders of the pickles - these were the best item of the night with the shaved Brussels a close second.  The oysters were delicious.  I loved the combo of the remoulade and the peppers; the oddity was the varying sizes of the oysters. Some were must larger and some were the small, sweet ones.  Weird, but they were all delicious.  As for the short rib, the meat was succulent and falling apart.  It was so tender, I could have eaten my weight in it.  My friends will tell you that if a short rib or pork belly is on the menu, odds are I WILL order it.  The turnip green flan was amazingly good, but so tiny in comparison to the dish.  What was not written on the menu was that it also came with the butternut squash - wow, sweet and caramely.  WOW.  I wanted more.\\n\\nMy only other complaint, sort of, was when I first got there.  The \\"host,\\" I guess, was confused by the need for a table for 5 people. He looked around no knowing where to put us (I was by myself).  He offered to put 2 tables together, then changed his mind. Next, he said he would pull up a 5th chair to a 4-top. I explained we would be eating, and possibly a lot, and that the tables weren't big enough.  He then suggested a booth and pointed me to one. I walked to it and realized the booth seats are not glued or nailed down - so the other tables had smushed all together so that no even Barbie, herself, could sit in this booth he was offering.  So I asked to take one in the back instead.  He was confounded.  I walked to the back and it took him at least 5 minutes to bring me an extra chair.  It was a little off-putting, but he made it right and I think ultimately understood my point.\\n\\nThey need a little work, but the food is great.

We called at 7:30 and they gave us $10 off for the delay, so that was nice.\\n\\nThe Meal:\\n\\nFor an appetizer we got chicken egg rolls. First bite revealed that they were still a little frozen inside. After a minute in the microwave, they were now warm, but without any flavor. Also they were a bit too stringy for my tastes. Neither of us finished it.\\n\\nWe also got \\"beef on a stick.\\" The first 3 of our 4 pieces were pretty good, a little bit too much spice and not enough teriyaki flavor, but good nonetheless.

It was absolutely disgusting. \\n\\nWe got an order of tangerine chicken to split. It smelled ok and the chicken was absolutely drenched in the orange sauce - just how we like it! But the flavor of the sauce was disappointing. It was make-your-nose-run spicy and the conventional orange-y flavor was almost non existent. This was definitely a let down, but I was still optimistic that I would get to enjoy the food at least a little. But we quickly realized that the quality of the chicken itself was terrible. It was overly chewy and wet with fat and grease. In many cases a piece did not even contain chicken, it was just the gross, soggy, tasteless breading with nothing left inside. We each ate maybe 5 pieces or so before we threw the rest out.\\n\\nThe highlight of the meal was the rice. Excellent white rice, they really know how to use a steamer!\\n\\nNeedless to say, I then made a trip to Publix for some real food. This was a disgusting meal that I wish I hadn't spent any money on.

It was friendly and had a nice atmosphere, although the seats in the sexy window booths were strangely shallow and high -- I'm six feet tall and my feet were dangling uncomfortably.  But I generally liked the decor. \\n\\n For food we ordered the mixed green salad, the vegan spinach and sweet potato ravioli, and the special chicken and broccoli. \\n\\nI wasn't impressed, particularly for the prices ($8 salad, approx. $20 entr√©e -- for lunch).  The salad was nicely dressed, and beautifully plated, sort of wrapped in long narrow slices of English cucumber garnished with tomato.  The problem was that the garnish vegetables all appeared to have been cut a day or two before, and were dry and somewhat withered.  Not appetizing to eat.  Also, there were some rotten bits in the mixed greens -- which are hard to pick out I know, but at a restaurant like that they should be able to do better. \\n\\nThe entrees were good but not at all amazing.  The ravioli were tasty, topped with some sauteed swiss chard and a surprisingly good crunchy mixture of dried carrot and onion.  However, the sauce they were swimming in was mediocre and kind of ruined it.  I think it was some kind of fancy carrot and tomato puree, but the flavor and effect was basically like Campbell's soup.  I really think they should do a lot better for $18.95.  \\n\\nSimilarly with the other dish.  The chicken was well cooked, and the meat was very flavorful.  It was accompanied by some okay, but unremarkable and undersalted mashed potatoes, and a decent light gravy.  There were more of those crunchy carrot things.  The broccoli was just plain steamed, in large chunks, no dressing of any kind.  I know it's healthy and all, but this dish was pretty dull. \\n\\nI like the idea of Rafiki but I wouldn't eat here again for my dollar.  Maybe if it cost half as much.  \\n\\nI would consider trying the bar for a cocktail, but it annoys me that the cocktail menu has not a single price on it.

See, the seating at BS is limited, meaning if you're not at the bar you're crammed into a 6-top (Actually 3 bar-height 2'x2' tables pushed together) and you're elbow to elbow with people you don't know.

He halfway attempts a comment about how if I'm religious or something, I say its nothing to do with religion, its just respect of those around you. A stunned silence follows for a few minutes, and Yankee Boys' friend says something to him, folds his napkin, gets up an leaves, followed by Yankee Boy, who looks at me when getting up and tells me I was out of line, I tell him HE was out of line, and he tells me to \\"GO F*@K MYSELF\\", at which point I remind him of what a classy Yankee he is as he walks away (sorry if you were the guy on my left, you probably got that in your ear). \\n\\nNothing like an expletive filled exchange with dining mates to soothe your troubled soul, creating that special memorable ambiance, and enjoy the rest of your evening.

Most certainly not a bad thing.  It was a nice starter to the meal. \\n\\nPork belly: With curried, deliciously peppery eggplant puree, cous cous and slightly sour  crisp pickled peach.  The pork belly was sweet and tender with a slight crust around the edges, and on the sides of the plate there were also tiny grape tomatoes that burst with sweetness when you bit into it.  I loved getting a bit of the pork, puree, and crisp peach in one bite. \\n\\nQuail: With duck liver dirty rice, charred leek, and hoe cake.  The quail was delicious with bits of dirty rice that spiced it up a bit and brought down by the sweetness of the hoecake. \\n\\nLamb: with tomato, basil puree and fried chickpea cake.  The chickpea cake was ethereal--crisp on the outside with a featherlight interior. Lamb was perfectly cooked, pink on the inside and balanced perfectly with the freshness of the basil puree.

In the mid-90s, some of my friends worked here while we all were students in high school. We used to hang out here and have fun. This always has been the closest Subway location to where my family has lived in Longwood since 1989. While I no longer go to it nearly as often as I did in the 90s and between 2000-2005 or so, it still is perfectly fine to go to every once in a while.\\n\\nWe had subs from here several months ago. Mine was very good. I usually just order the Veggie Delite or Veggie Patty sub. Never had a bad one at this Subway or any other. Might have to check out this store's breakfast sometime soon. The Subway near Princeton/Edgewater made some good breakfasts for me a few times. I'm hoping that this one will, too.\\n\\nYou have a lot of better lunch options nearby, as Luna's, Thai Delight, La Fonda, Papa B's and more small businesses are very close to, if not neighbors of, Subway. However, going to Subway once in a while is something I like to do.\\n\\nMy main issue with Subway is that they no longer do that stamp program. I would be here A LOT if the stamps still were used. Not sure why they discontinued that. Oh, well."},{"name":"Uno Pizzeria & Grill","address":"280 Huntington Ave.","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"Chicago pizza is familiar and very reliably good.

That's enough cue on how hard it may be to get their attention every now and then. Like any packed dim sum place, it can get pretty frustrating to get good service.\\n\\nPricing is very decent in respect to the portion and, well, okay quality. It's obviously not as fresh or high quality as the steamed to order dim sum restaurants, but it definitely does the job when $30 is all your budget...for two...woohoo.\\n\\nThis place reminds me of the dim sum restaurants I love going to every weekend at Monterey Park in LA.\\n\\nFor what it's worth for average price and quality dim sum, four stars it deserves.\\n\\nTip:\\n\\n- Accepts Visa / Mastercard\\n- They have a tiny parking lot in front.

We put in for an appetizer and then, as for every other time we go out, my husband meticulously checked each menu item for \\"bell peppers\\". A side note: he doesn't eat these but often, menus don't indicate whether or not a dish has them, as they're part of a sauce or a side, etc.\\n\\nOur server Mark, after we mentioned this to him, patiently and diligently went back to the kitchen to check each of my husband's choice dishes to see if they had peppers and, to his own surprise, found out that every single one of them did. Instead of giving up or telling my husband to just \\"pick them out\\" (which servers have told us before), Mark proposed a specific dish and told us that the kitchen could substitute out the bell pepper sauce with another sauce that my husband mentioned he loved.\\n\\nFast forward to the food: everything was delicious. We absolutely destroyed our chowder fries, which were crunchy and perfectly balanced the creamy chowder and melted cheese. Then, the moment of truth... my husband tried the concocted dish and loved it!! If he hadn't been full from the fries, he certainly would have cleaned the plate. My dish, the baked scallops, were perfectly cooked and the cream sauce was delicious.\\n\\nOverall, not only was the food amazing, but the service was above and beyond what we would have expected.

My friend is gluten free, so we checked in with Yelp to see some popular gluten-free spots.  This restaurant came up at #1, and is well deserved of it.\\n\\nI booked a mid-afternoon reservation just in case, but we were pleasantly seated when we arrived a half-hour early.  The place is smaller than the exterior and the website led me to believe, so I would definitely suggest booking reservations in advance when possible, just in case.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is in a very nice neighborhood, and atmosphere inside matches the outside.  We were seated towards the back at our request and a server was quick to give us menus and take drink orders.  We were there early, so the dim sum menu was available.\\n\\nAll the meals were clearly marked as vegetarian, or allergy-friendly meals.  My friend has a gluten allergy, so this was a big plus for her.  When we ordered our food, we notified the waitress of her allergy.  She came back a few minutes later stating that one of sides we ordered (sweet potato fries) was fried in shared oil, thus not exactly gluten free.  We were VERY appreciative of the waitress checking on this for us, but I think maybe that should have been noted somewhere on the menu.  Gluten allergies can be tricky: I know people that shared oil doesn't bother, but in the case of my friend, this would have been an issue.\\n\\nOverall, the food was fantastic.  We certainly enjoyed all of our meals and everything was tasty and delicious, though I did take exception to one item in particular:\\n\\nWok-roasted Chinese sausage + caramelized onion omelet - Delicious.  The omelet wasn't dry, and the flavors were great\\nFresh rolls - My friend enjoyed them, but they had WAY too much cilantro for my liking.\\nBraised pork belly stuffed bao - I think after one bite, this survived about 3 more seconds at the table.\\nThai ginger chicken with rice vermicelli - Very refreshing for a salad.  This also had cilantro, but it was a good balance.  Not too much, not too little.\\nNasi goreng with pork and pineapple, fried egg - By far, the best item we ordered.  We felt bad not being able to finish it, it was that good.\\n\\nFor drinks, we were given an ice cold pitcher of water when we were seated, and we had one glass each of the Shanghai Sake Sangria (which came in two flavors, and we were allowed to try before ordering).  Very delicious.\\n\\nOur waitress was also fantastic at not bothering us every ten minutes while we ate.  We ordered drinks and food, and let us be until we started looking for her.\\n\\nOverall, definitely a 5-star experience.  I don't think too much cilantro in a fresh roll warrants a 4-star rating.  Great service, great food, great atmosphere, and a great location.

He was pretty happy with his food, and I was absolutely shocked with how much pasta was on my plate. The food itself was ok, the pasta was indeed special, but the sauce was a little scarce and \\"dry\\" as if the pasta had been rolled around in tomato sauce but not really cooked with it.\\n\\nDesert consisted of some decent gelatto (not great, although the presentation was interesting), and chocolate cake.

Then you've got PDX Six Seven One. Food from Guam. Basically chicken, rice, flatbread, shrimp or pork items. Being that I'd never had the food, I deferred to the guy running the place and he suggested the cold chicken salad called Kelaguen Mannok. It had chopped grilled chicken, green and yellow onions, grated coconut, chili peppers and lemon juice. I got it with flatbread called titiyas. He also gave me a side of some soy based sauce called Fina'denne' (soy, lemon, chilies and onion). The food was simply delicious and just perfect for a hot spring/summer type day. The chicken may have been grilled but it tasted like it came fresh off of a rotisserie. It wasn't really spicy at all but the chilis and the onions along with the slivers of coconut all meshed together harmoniously.

It takes some time to look over everything, including descriptions, as there are a lot of unique food items, such as their sushi which you can only find some at this restaurant, as well as their specialty sushi that tastes like a burger, and a burger that tastes like sushi.\\n\\nFor lunch, we ordered The Arnold Hamandeggar, which is a juicy half pound beef burger with cheddar cheese, black forest ham, fried egg, applewood bacon, cowfish sauce, and a choice of side. It usually comes with a side of house fries, but we decided to try the sweet and spicy thai cucumbers. They were ok. I did like the juicy burger though.

I found it difficult to just bite off a piece at a time, instead of having to eat the entire piece, without it completely falling apart. So that was disappointing.\\n\\nOverall, though, the service was very good. The waitress took the time to explain the menu to us and checked up on us often.

The reminded me of nann but with a twist. At first, I didn't know how to eat the flat bread with its condiments. We learned we eat they by wrapping them in the flat bread. I was apprehensive about eating raw onion, but it was all right with the flat bread. \\n\\nWe also ordered dolmeh as an appetizer. I didn't care much for it. \\n\\nThe dessert was decent.

We had a coupon from 'half off depot', and I was really excited to present this adventure to them. We had the lamb and veggie plate to share. And I ordered the raw meat! I'm always one to try other cultures. If that's how they eat it in Ethiopia, then that's what I want. It was a little alarming to my fiance when the waitress said to me, \\"Good Luck!\\" I think they were quite surprised that I ordered such a daring item. My fiance? She wasn't quite so accommodating. But to my pleasure and surprise, my daughter was. She LOVED the raw meat, To be fair, it was VERY fresh beef. Very red and marbled with very little fat. To me, it was sushi. It was served with a spicy dip and the bread staple, Injera, This is the fork and spoon of Ethiopian food (since there are no utensils).\\n\\nWe really enjoyed the feast before us. I ordered a Martini, but I'm not sure they were up to date on mixing drinks. But that didn't matter. Our waitress was amazing in helping us understand this culture and the food we were about to eat. And the owner came out to see who this white guy was that was ordering raw meat. He was very gracious and a wonderful host. \\n\\nHonestly, we couldn't have had a better evening. If you are a gastronomer, and love a food adventure, you MUST try this place. The comments about entering through the castle, which we did, are true. But if you go through the door that says \\"Restrooms\\", You will find an Ethiopian Market and the 'secret' spot of the Ethiopian Atlanta cab drivers. It was an incredible experience and I can't say enough about it. Go!

I went to East Boston for the first time  as a friend of a friend was having a beirut party.  My bf kept pushing Santarpio's so we agreed to order and pick it up.  (Cause they don't deliver!)\\n\\n1. They only make one size of pizza, medium.  I don't like that they don't have large but I do appreciate that they don't trick you and call them large.\\n2.  The pizza is really crunchy.  The crust was a little harder than I like.  \\n3.  The cheese and toppings were slipping and sliding right off.  They didn't cut the pie into consistent slices so we had to get out a knife and try to hack through the tough crust.  It was kind of a mess.\\n\\nAll in all, while I agreed that the pizza did have good flavor, I would not call it the best pizza in Boston, or even great pizza that I would order again.  I'm from a really Italian town in the NJ/NY area so it takes a lot to impress  me -- and this place didn't do it.  \\n\\nThis is the weird part though.  We ordered Domino's after (which I have always looked down on).  I enjoyed the Dominio's MORE than the Santarpio's, which was surprising and sad.  I think I'd order from them before I'd get Santarpio's again.\\n\\nOh, and the whole kitchen thing is weird.  The guys were nice to me but surly to my boyfriend.

At further inspections the white fish was brown. The manager took my meal off after offering me something else that I declined and discounted my husbands so we only paid half on his meal. The bathrooms were trashed and the place over all wasn't the cleanest. We will not be going back to baby A's ever.

After sitting for 25 minutes I had to go up to the counter to tell one of them that we were ready to order. Bad sign. I watched another family leave without ordering - they arrived just after us and I wish we had done the same thing.

Ultimately, I felt like while there was a lot of potential, it was all lost due to inexcusably poor execution. Most of the proteins were not cooked properly (i.e. either over cooked, or not long enough to render it tender), and most of the flavors were very dull and fell flat. Perhaps I'm jaded by having lived in NYC and LA, but the best meal of this genre I've had was actually in a suburb of Minneapolis - at Travail - for a lot less money. They should be able to get it right in Austin, but there seems to be a lack of skillful judgement with the chefs here.\\n\\nScrambled egg, broccoli, goat feta, pine nuts\\n- Before we ordered this, a dining companion joked that it sounds like something we could make at home. Sorry, but I don't think we could make it as bad as they did. It tasted dull. No excitement. A vapid start.\\n\\nChickpea fritters, sesame dressing, sweet potato\\n- It seemed like they were going for an Indian pakora/samosa hybrid here. Hell, the inside tasted like a bad samosa, with a very mushy texture. Same for the exterior; mushy does not a fritter make. \\n\\nPork belly, chili, citrus, popcorn\\n- The pork belly was cooked at a too high temperature and not long enough, making it fibrous instead of melting-tender like it should be. Really, who can't cook pork belly properly these days? The chili and citrus flavors went unnoticed. They neglected to mention the lackluster foam on top.\\n\\nBeet salad, pistachio, fennel, frisee\\n- Thank god the beets were properly cooked . But the sauce smeared on the plate could have used more brightness. Another meh dish.\\n\\nCorn battered pig face, pickles, deviled egg\\n- Guess what? It tasted like a corn dog, and not in a good way. And the last time I cooked pig face, it was rich and gelatinous from all the connective tissue. Somehow, their pig face was more like a dry pulled-pork. The pickles and deviled egg were pretty much what you probably make at home.\\n\\nScallops, spicy pork cheek, curried sweet potato, raisin relish\\n- Once again, the small scallops were overcooked to the point of being stringy. Seriously, do they have their C-team chefs working on Thursday nights or what? You've got a circulating water bath and high BTU burners and you can't properly cook a scallop??\\n\\nChili braised monkfish, cumin carrot, black bean mole\\n- Yet again, very overcooked monkfish. Come on guys, for this price, get your chefs to stop smoking weed on duty and pay attention to the temperature. WTF?\\n\\nFor fear of further disappointment, we declined to continue on to dessert.

Def a unique taste, but if you're gonna go greek, i'd rather get a real gyro or something.  The lamb is really, really great though.\\n4) Mushroom Shroom -- wow!

The habanero peppers don't play though, so brace yourself with some water... by the end of this burger my mouth was semi- on fire.

My friend and I got the lamb rangoljosh and lamb korma.  You'd think we would have tried to be a bit more diverse in our ordering, but those were what we first set our eyes on, and we just stuck to them.  The lamb in the korma was tender and moist.  The sauce itself was very fragrant with the almonds and pistachio.  The rangoljosh was a nice change from the creamy korma, even though its lamb felt a bit more dry.  We also got the garlic and onion naan and palak paneer naan.  I think we could have done without the latter actually.  As good as it was, it turned out to be a bit heavy to eat with the curries.  It was something that would have tasted better to be eaten on its own because it was already very flavorful.  I ended up doing that but then I just did not have enough stomach space to eat more curries with rice!\\n\\nThe service was really good.  You could tell it was supposed to be a more posh place, but the staff wasn't pretentious.  We did have a few miscommunications, but they all worked out.  When I asked our server for recommendations, he offered the curried mussels and also automatically put in the order for us.  It was probably because we looked interested, but realistically we weren't going to get it just because we were not hungry enough to eat it.  He politely cancelled the order with no fuss when we asked him to.  When I ordered the palak paneer naan, we got the jalapeno cream cheese instead.  Not sure how that happened, but he put in the extra order of naan for us, and also let us keep the mistaken order.  Too bad we just simply did not have enough stomach space for that much food.  Because we had good conversations going throughout dinner, we stayed a lot longer than we should have on a Friday night.

something to do with tolls, and tumbleweeds of garbage raging down the street on trash days... but this time, on a whim, my coworkers and i took what may very well be the greatest team-building off-site of all time. on wednesday, december 30th, around quarter past twelve, with a line just forming out the door, on a mofo of a cold day, we had arrived, and waited patiently for a table.\\nthe scent of grilling meats upon finally busting through the entryway of a legendary, yet fairly still \\"in the know\\", eatery... was slowly-close-your-eyes-and-inhale intoxicating. the scent was only matched by the decor: walls covered with best of boston plaques and boxing paraphernalia. \\nthe hostess, a short woman who undoubtedly can throw a right hook that would knock my husband out cold (note to self), seated us at a booth near the door, and within seconds, we had ordered a combo plate of grilled lamb and their homemade sausage, as well as three diets and (don't tell anyone) a bud. there was a bit of a wait for the food itself, and we were told that this was due to a hockey team of thirty people seated in the other room. no matter- more time to take it all in. plus, as the waitress noted, our sausage and lamb had arrived in due time, and we enjoyed our \\"little suttin suttin\\" immensely. that sausage is killer. again, homemade, smokey from the grill, which was situated not in the kitchen, but directly across from us and next to the bar, and just peppery enough to make things interesting, it was gone in seconds. the lamb was just as good, pink in the middle and equally as satisfying, though in the end i think i took more than my share of that chewy, savory sausage. do not come here without ordering the combo plate, or at least the sausage.\\nwe ordered two pizzas for four people. 1) the works with anchovies. don't be afraid of anchovies, they're good, stupid. 2) sausage, peppers, mushrooms. the pizzas took a little bit of time, and we were told that normally they take about twenty minutes. i stared voraciously at the condiments on the table, the most notable being hot pepper flakes, and parmesan cheese - both contained in little baby food jars with holes cut into the metal top, a nice touch. oh the waiting, the unbearable anticipation building. \\nand then our pizzas arrived. a thing of undisputed beauty. santarpio's pizzas are unique for a few different reasons, if you haven't already done your homework. first, the crust is thin and can get sloppy when weighed down with wonderful toppings... except for that cylindrical tube of crunchy goodness that lies along the circumference of the pizza. the dough itself bakes up crunchy on the outside of said tube, and light and chewy on the inside. it is bready and substantial, delicious with the smell of a well-worked oven. second, the mozz cheese is laid out on top of the sauce and toppings, as opposed to other pizzas which scatter whatever veggies and meats on top of the dairy. this technique seems to impart more flavor on the crust, and meld all tastes together beautifully within each bite of pizza, as if the ingredients are steamed and baked into the entire meal. though this is all personal preference, in terms of toppings, i think that the quality of the pizza emerged a bit more clearly within the pie with only sausage, mushrooms, and peppers, but i was torn. i am clearly also a sucker for pizza with the works. we demolished both pies, but the memory lives on.\\nman, i could wax poetic forever on these pizzas. when i came home and triumphantly declared my venture to my bigger half, he sulked off in sadness and jealousy, secretly planning his own virgin run to santarpio's. for those who have had it, they crave it, and for those who haven't taken the plunge, i can only urge you to head toward the airport and cough up those damn tolls. all i can say is, new york, we have a pizza which is not yours, it's not better, it's definitely not worse, it's unique, and you can't have it. and those are words i never thought i would write down with self assurance. santarpio's, you are my new pizza crush, and i can't wait to see you again. ::kisses::"},{"name":"Brown Bag Deli","address":"898 Mohawk St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"We stopped here this evening because we wanted something different.

The fav apps was the spicy lobster and tuna.  So delish - we could have stopped there.  Onto salads.  Wedge was really fresh and huge.  Several of us ordered the filet mignon - they were all severely undercooked.  We all ordered medium, and in all cases they were virtually black and blue.  They tried to fix, but throwing filet back on the grill just kills it.  So my lesson learned is to order the ribeye which was cooked perfectly and melted in your mouth.  Sides of potatoes of each kind, the au gratin was the best, and spinach, creamed spinach was super rich. Dessert was the bread pudding.  Enough for 4 to share.  Same with the chocolate cake.

You can tell the batter had hot sauce in it (think, tobasco/crystal's hot sauce). Do I think it's worth the price? No. You can definitely do better, people.

For those of you who don't know, Gus's is a Memphis transplant, the original in a small town outside of Memphis.  It has, IMO, the *best* fried chicken I've ever had.  So when I found out that a location opened up in Austin, it seemed like a natural first stop.   \\n\\nNow sometimes, you remember something being awesome, and then you have it again, and you've built it up in your head so much that you can't help but be disappointed...not so in this case.  \\n\\nThe meal starts with some piping hot fried pickles.  Probably the only disappointing parts of the meal were a. The ranch was not fresh, but packaged ranch, and b. the lack of catfish on the menu here.  The pickles were well battered, mostly sweet with a nice bite to them.   Add a 16oz Lone Star to it and the bachelor party has begun (I couldn't remember the last time I had a beer during lunch on a weekday - damn, it felt good)\\n\\nThe pictures everywhere won't do the chicken at Gus's justice.  It has everything you want in a fried chicken (as long as you want it spicy).  The skin is perfectly crisp, but doesn't crumble when you bite into it.  The skin has a nice bit of cayenne to it, but the real spice hits when you bite into it.  The meat, always piping hot and perfectly cooked.  But it's the spice of the actual meat that sets it apart from other fried chickens.  There's a perfect underlying heat that lingers and is what makes Gus's stand out.  It can't be explained.  And it's a well-kept secret.  People have tried to replicate, and thankfully, I have a fiancee who is on a never-ending quest to find the perfect fried chicken recipe.  We will try some of the internet copycats, and will see how close they come.  \\n\\nPics and more from my trip to Austin up at:\\nhttp://eatinginchicago2014.wordpress.com/2014/05/19/austintrip1/"},{"name":"Rangzen Tibetan Place","address":"24 Pearl St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Great lunch spot in Central Square.

We waited at our table for 15 minutes without any service. When the waitress finally approached us, she asked us if we'd need menus. We had never been before, so of course we said yes. She didn't have any on her so she had to go find them. She gave them to us a few minutes later, then didn't return for another 15 minutes. We tried to get her attention, but she kept dodging us. I even stood up and said \\"excuse me\\" and she kept walking. \\n\\nDuring our wait, we noticed our waitress talking on her cell phone in the back of the dining room near the kitchen off and on. She then put on her jacket and grabbed her purse, had a few confrontational words with another waitress, then left the restaurant. 10 minutes passed by before the other waitress said she'd be taking our orders and confirmed what we were waiting on, and said it would be out quickly. We were told an additional 3-4 times it would be right out. Well over an hour after sitting, our \\"BBQ\\" plate was delivered to us, and it was the wrong item. The waitress claimed that it was what I had ordered, but it definitely was not. Another 10 or so minutes went by and FINALLY our single pizza arrived. 1.5 hours to make a single pizza.  No apology was made and no comp items. No wrong was acknowledged at all. Awful. Worst service I've ever had in a restaurant anywhere on Earth. \\n\\nThe Food:\\nI live in Boston and I'm from New York. I've eaten in NYC, New Haven, and Chicago. I consider myself a pizza connoisseur. The pizza is ok. Decent zesty sauce. Cheese was burnt to hell, as was the crust. Not the best pizza I've ever had, not even in Boston. Better than the convenience store pizza I had in Canada a few weeks ago, but that's about it. Thin burnt cracker crust loaded with grease. Our sausage BBQ plate was ok. The jarred cherry peppers were probably the best part of the whole meal. \\n\\nVerdict:\\nNever waste your time going here. I waited days to write this to fume my anger about the service so I didn't write just another pissed off review...but really this place is terrible. Good Ol' Boys guido Italian joint by reputation that just doesn't earn its reputation in a service based industry.

They have too many customers and not enough time to make the burgers so they rush the grilling process, and in that process the meat, so tender and tasty, loses a lot of its allure. I ordered the Primetime and the beef tasted like it was meant to be premium but got cooked too quickly and lost its edge over typical beef. The texture attested to its high end origins (well the price too), but the flavors got overwhelmed by the toppings. Not that I'm complaining about truffle oil (damn, that's good stuff) and brie (really, one of the best things to melt on a sandwich). But the beef made me sad, especially after a 45 minute wait to order and eat.\\n\\nIf they opened the place in a slightly out-of-the way place like South Lamar, I think the quality could improve greatly just by lowering the temperature of the grill a little and taking their time to make every burger count. The ingredients are all there, but they've let the need to keep up with the demand take away from the quality.\\n\\nI'd only go back if I was here on a date so we could talk lots while we wait ;) Eh, maybe that's the point!"},{"name":"Verde Cocina","address":"524 NW 14th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Went to Portland recently on vacation and ended up eating Verde Cocina three times!

Second trip - pizza was not burned. This is an adventure worth trying. It is a throwback. Pizza is an \\"8\\" but the experience is like visiting 1965 all over again. Limited menu - that is part of the attraction.\\n\\n\\nFirst Review\\nW-a-a-a-y overrated. Environment is old-time italian pizza joint: wooden booths with no padding, tattered menus, and overworked waitress. Just like the old neighborhood I grew up in -  I actually liked all this, very homey. \\n\\nNegatives...My take is they used to have an old coal brick-lined oven (waitress confirmed this) and now they overbake the pies in gas heat to get the same texture of coal-brick-baked. Problem is nothing matches that flavor and texture. The pie was burnt in parts (all pies were) and cracker crunchy, not soft at all inside crust like a brick oven would do. \\n\\nPie arrived with limited toppings: not enough (but good) sausage, could hardly see any mozzerela cheese, and very saucy. I think most of cheese was parmigiana (and quite salty). I would try again for the atmosphere and ask the pizza not be in as long."},{"name":"Desta Ethiopian Kitchen","address":"3086 Briarcliff Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"So after what I suppose was my less than ecstatic first review, I was contacted by Ashenafi, the owner of Desta, with an invitation to return for another try, on the house. I, never one to turn down a free meal (but no, seriously, I do appreciate when restaurants care enough to listen to their customers), decided sure, why not.  \\n\\nThis time, without billing issues clouding my reaction, I can actually give a review of the food! Between the six of us, we got The \\"Works\\" Fir Fir, Fish Tibs, Lamb Tibs, Beef Tibs, and the Veggie Combo. I know, we're fatties. My favorite, by far, was the FISH TIBS. It was seasoned with just the right proportion of spices to salt to garlic (flavor: check!), and the tender tilapia flesh was seared just right (texture: check!). The Works was good too, but dauntingly copious (...I suppose it IS called, \\"The WORKS\\"). I think the FirFir overwhelmed the Kitfo though--I like to be able to really taste my raw meat--so I would recommend going with the straight up Kitfo or Kitfo w/ Collard Greens instead. The Vegetarian Combo is worth getting as well because there are so many different things on it; you can't go wrong with good-tasting variety. \\n\\nMy two criticisms of the night: 1) One of my friends, AR, is allergic to gluten. According to many reviews, including some on the restaurant website, Desta's injera is made with 100% teff flour (i.e. gluten-free), but apparently this is no longer the case... = Unhappy AR. 2) A minor one: I don't know what's more authentic, but I prefer my injera warmer than room temp. \\n\\nThe service this time was impeccable (probably because they were paying us special attention, but still, everyone was genuinely nice). They gave us the option of a communal plate (...unfortunately, it was still difficult to share across the narrow rectangular space; the plate-area to table-area ratio is just too great), and they let us taste generous portions of the two different Tejs before making our choice (mild is better if you don't have a painfully sweet tooth!). \\n\\nIn the end, I'm still not convinced that I prefer the modern, first date-y feel of the place,  but I appreciate the restaurant's efforts. I understand the concept they're promoting, and I can see how it might be amenable to some. It's just not my style...or maybe the patio-seating would a better choice for me ;P.\\n\\n+1 star for the Fish Tibs (recommended by the house, Thank you!)\\n+1 star for caring.

The tabouleh is good, much better than at Nuba. But the portions seemed small for the money, and you're out of luck if you're vegan, with limited choice if you're a vegetarian. I ordered the Libanais and I don't eat eggs, so I asked if they could sub something else for the egg. The first suggestion I got was bacon!

We were excited about the happy hour specials: 1 buck a shuck oysters and 1 dollar peel and eat shrimps. 12 of each please!\\n\\nThey must have misentered our order because we ended up with 24 oysters instead of 12. \\n\\nThe oysters were fresh and delicious, but 24? That's a shitload for 2 people. I was feeling queasy by the 5th oyster. \\n\\nThe peel and eat shrimp were REALLY disappointing. They had been overcooked and were super chewy and BLAND. The dipping sauces served with them were pretty abysmal as well - some kind of mayo sauce, a liquidy version of a cocktail sauce, and some orange marmalade. \\n\\nNext up, I ordered a Cobb Salad and a mango California roll. The guy ordered the lobster, lobster mash, and creamed spinach. \\n\\nMy salad came out fine, and his food came out all right. They even accidentally brought out an order of clam chowder that we had to politely point out to them was not ours. \\n\\nHowever, they forgot my sushi. \\n\\nAnd they never even acknowledged that we ordered it. \\n\\nHis lobster mash was pretty good - in fact, the lobster mash had more lobster meat in it than his actual lobster entree. And the creamed spinach was soupy and overly creamy. \\n\\nI think the wait staff at Coast needs to get it together. Instead of walking around, schmoozing with their friends, they need to work on getting orders right and maybe even greeting their customers when they sit down.\\n\\nThe table next to us did not have a server come by their table until 20 minutes into their date.

There are several items on the menu that are amazing, unfortunately they can take a while to make, so it's not convenient to order these at lunch time if you are in a rush, which is why I've always eaten the buffet.  Their saag paneer (spinach) is also wonderful.  Another one of my favorite items is their malai kofta (vegetarian meatballs) - Paneer-stuffed vegetable rounds simmered in an onion curry with shredded coconut; they are unlike any I've ever had.\\n\\nThey also have great selections for Happy Hour.  The curried mussels are divine!  I will not eat mussels any place else, they simply do not compare!

We were able to try lots of different things that we never would have ordered and even though we did not like everything served to us, we were all full and satisfied by meal's end.\\n\\nWe had an early dinner and the restaurant was about half full by the time we were done.  Service was attentive but not bothersome.  Our server noticed that we had eaten hardly any of the salted parsnips with butter, so she comped the price of the bread and butter that we ordered before the meal.  It's always nice to be treated fairly without being asked. :)\\n\\nNavarre is a small place, but the high ceilings help keep it from feeling stuffy.  I wore a shirt and tie, but my friends with short sleeves and tatoos fit right in as well; it is Portland after all.\\n\\nOverall, we were very happy.  I can't quite give Navarre five stars because I didn't enjoy everything I had, too many pickled items and too many turnips and beets.  That being said, I would definitely recommend Navarre to others and I will go back.

I ordered an Italian sandwich and a drink at what my receipt says was 1:14. By 1:45 I still hadn't received any food so I went to ask for my money back as I had an appointment at 2. The man I spoke to at first said he could box it up to be to-go instead, which would have been fine, but the food wasn't ready so that wasn't an option. So I waited a few minutes for the manager to come do the refund. She was apologetic and said they were short staffed, but then she could not get the register to work to give me my refund. She kept saying she \\"understood that I was upset,\\" almost like she was trying to calm me down... which was weird because I hadn't said anything really. I work in customer service too, I get that some days everything hits the fan. It's cool, I just don't wanna be charged for a sandwich I never get.\\n\\nAfter waiting almost 10 minutes on a refund with no success, I just had to walk out as I couldn't miss my appointment.

Barley Swine is rooted in tradition, but surprisingly progressive, worldly and modern. \\n\\nA few tiny anecdotes about the experience, places where I got a quick giggle! I love that the receipt at the end of the night is akin to a build it yourself monster shopping list- FACE, ANKLE, HEART, etc. I was completely set on the fact that the forks have a tiny mouse and cat on them (see for yourself in pics). I also love that they keep their spices in the dining room. We went around 9PM during the week and the wait time was an easy fifteen minutes. I wasn't even done pre-assaulting my taste buds at Lick with ice cream when our table was ready. That's one thing I've taken with me from my childhood...YOLO- have ice cream before dinner always. \\n\\nThe bf and I ordered eight dishes and a dessert plate. We totally pigged out, but that seems apt for Barley Swine. I was happily full around plate six, so I think their plate number suggestion is pretty spot on. One of the biggest testaments for the food that night is that I enjoyed cilantro.. a lot, like \\"seeked it out on the plate\\" enjoyed it and I've usually found it very off putting and strong.  Highlights of the best dishes were:\\n\\nPoached Grouper- Revelatory is the first word that comes to mind with this dish. Pickled butternut squash and pulled bbq tamarind pork on top of thai poached grouper was just so playful and turned on it's side three times to get back to where it started deep down the rabbit hole. \\nPickled Shrimp- Fried shrimp heads! Nothing else needs to be said. \\nPig Face- This was so texturally fun!\\nRabbit- This dish made the entire night for me. The pair sitting next to us got it before and I overheard one say \\"this is fucking good\\" and the other kept chewing and grunted favorably.  I immediately regretted giving my boyfriend the bigger rabbit belly schnitzel piece at first bite, but when I saw how his eyes lit up eating a part of the loin I gave him the rest of mine. The terrine was super delicate and sweet and lightly gamey. \\nLamb- The lamb sausage was like the best kebab in the world. \\nGoat Heart- This was a special and I was so amused by it the entire time eating. It was an outdoor barely grilled goat heart sliced on falafels with curried eggplant puree and grilled figs with balsamic. These were the best tiny falafel I've ever eaten and I was surprised to find them here! I could have eaten a bowl of them like popcorn.\\nStuffed Pig Ankle- Crispy and a meat sensation. The home made hot sauce was like an awesome Frank's hot sauce. \\nDoughnut- This was fun and not too sweet. It was so much better than the desserts at Uchiko. The whiskey marshmallows were delicious and the fermented chili and mint leaves are what made the dish different and delicious for me. It's much more like a sweet last course than dessert. \\n\\nI love this menu and this concept. Why does any one restaurant need five different beef or chicken dishes? They should just do whatever is best and right at that time, since ingredients are not static. I was iffy about the communal seating, but I think it really makes you focus on the food and discuss it. It's too hard to have a really intimate conversation, but it makes you feel intimately closer to the food and good people cooking it.  I can't wait to see if the next menu lives up to the bar I've set for Barley Swine!"},{"name":"Sea Level Oyster Bar","address":"94 Wharf St","city":"Salem","stars":"4","text":"Food was excellent!

They have a ton of meat options (lamb burgers, bison burgers, veggie patties) and then numerous cheeses, veggies and buns. \\n\\nI went with the Llano Poblano: (angus beef, roasted poblanos, pepperjack cheese, avocado, tomatoes and chipotle mayo).

I tried it and was repeatedly told there were no seats.  Not willing to accept \\"No\\" as an answer I picked up the phone and was given a reservation for four without hesitation.\\n\\nMyself and an additional party of three dined together one day last week.  Myself and Partner-in-Dine1 (PID1, 2, or 3) arrived before PID's 2 and 3.   The Hostess seemed not to have my name down in their reservation book.  I had called earlier that day to make a firm reservation.  She never actually said anything.  It was asking my name the second time and then, asking how it was spelled that clinched it.  A couple of minutes of waiting in the lobby and another person asking for the name of the reservation.  I began to worry they had not written down the reservation.  It did not seem over booked.   Ultimately, the staff figured it out and PID1 and I were taken to our table.\\n\\nIt was not as far from the Jazz band as I would have liked.  Mostly, because I am just not a Jazz fan.  The band was quite good and the singer was excellent.\\n\\nWhile PID1 and I waited for 2 and 3 we decided to order the 'savory bread pudding'.  Neither of us had a clue what that meant.  Well, we did KNOW that it sure wouldn't be sweet.  But neither of us had ever had such a thing.  As the cook in the family I had never even seen a recipe or thought of making a savory bread pudding.\\n\\nOH                            MY                          GOD!  \\n\\nOur server placed a creamy mushroom gravy covered perfectly square cube in front of us.  We looked at each other, grabbed our forks, and gently waded in.  The pudding was soft yet, not mushy. It was firm enough to stand up to our forks.  I think the moment we both had the flavors melting in our mouths did we look at each other with eyes wide open in surprise and excitement at the wonder we were tasting that we knew it would take a Herculean effort not to devour it in an instant.  Instead, we forced ourselves to take our time.   PID 2 and 3 finally arrived.  Lucky for them we exercised enough fortitude that there was some of this wonder left for them to try.  Drat them.  PID1 and I would have been perfectly happy to decimate this dish.  I admit I licked the plate.\\n\\nI am not a huge fan of garlic, mashed potatoes.  So, I asked our server, who was attentive and fun, if I could have a small taste to decided.  Not a problem.  It was actually one of the best garlic mashed potatoes i have had.  I SHOULD have tried the mashed yams before I made my side choice of fries.  Again, I have never tasted yams this good in my life!  None of us had.  Unless, we go again we may never experience that again.  So, we will just have to make a point of it.\\n\\nPID 1 and 2 ordered the Rib Eye steaks with the mashed Yams.  All the steak dishes came with green beans.   I ordered the Filet Mignon.   The Rib Eye's were HUGE.  While they were cooked perfectly they were set before the wrong person.  Not a problem.  PID 1 and 2 just switched the dishes.  We all like our meat pretty, well, meaty.  Red.  Definitely, red.  PID 2 just likes her meat a little less red than PID 1 and me.\\n\\nThe green beans were perfectly cooked.  Cooked for a moment to keep them sweet and crisp and served in butter.  Plain, simple, perfect.\\n\\nPID 3 ordered the pasta and seafood.  There was a large number of very large shrimp, small scallops, and other fish in a creamy sauce.  It was delish!\\n\\nNow that I have raved about the great side I will let you know there were a couple of downsides.\\n\\nThe first real downside was the chairs.  They are red short velvet, high backed chairs.  The tops look like the rounded humps of a valentine heart.  We joked about the Queen of Hearts waiting to take off our heads.  The chairs had been sat in a few times too many.  The seat cushions were nearly nonexistent.  This made sitting a bit uncomfortable.\\n\\nThen, there was my filet.  I had ordered it \\"rare-medium-rare\\".  I wanted it red not quite raw, but, not entirely bloody either.  It came to me well done.  I brought it to the Host's attention and he whisked it off the table with great apology.  The only fault I have about the service is that the Host was a smidge over chatty.  Otherwise, perfectly attentive.\\n\\nBy the time my corrected filet came out PID 1 had already finished his meal and PID 2 and 3 were trying more valiantly not to finish theirs until mine arrived.  I felt a little pressured to rush.  But, I chose to enjoy my meal.  I was a little disappointed that the steaks were not more well seasoned.  Basically, the steaks were au naturel.\\n\\nWe forced ourselves to order two different desserts.  There was very little room in our stomachs but, for dessert and the expectation they would be as good as the rest of our dinner we caved.   We shared the Warm Pecan Pie ala mode.  I am afraid I cannot remember the other dessert.  I DO remember they were both wonderful.

Best Indian restaurant in town, hands down. Yeah, okay, it's kinda overpriced; you're paying for the ambience more than anything else. On the other hand, I haven't had cheaper Indian food that even holds a candle to Bukhara. I'm willing to subject myself to the extra expense if it means my Indian food craving is satisfied.\\n\\nSo why only 4 stars? CONSISTENCY.\\n\\nTheir spiciness levels are wildly different depending on who's cooking. As a general rule, Bukhara's medium is mild, hot is medium, and very hot (not even offered as an option on the menu) is hot. I always order very hot. 75% of the time it's just right, and the other 25% of the time it's so spicy I can't get my mouth to stop burning for a half hour. I wanted flavor, not torture!\\n\\nAlso depending on the cook, you can end up with saag paneer that tastes more like tomato than spinach. In order to preserve my opinion of Bukhara, however, I avoid ordering delivery when I think the Tomato-Happy Cook is on duty. (Roughly Sunday through Thursday nights. I've clearly had too many opportunities to analyze the trends.)\\n\\nWhen Bukhara is good, though, man is it good! My personal favorites are the murg tikka masala -- actual white meat, no stray bones! -- saag paneer, and onion naan/kulcha. Their naan is probably their strongest point. The garlic naan is too oily and garlicky for my liking, but regardless of which flavor you prefer, the bread is always fluffy, never crispy/overdone. Bukhara has cooking naan down to a science, I'll give them that much.\\n\\nThe weekday lunch buffet is a great way to try everything they have to offer for $9.95 a head. I've sampled lots of dishes and can honestly say that none are anything less than good, even if they're not what I would order on the regular. No matter what kind of dishes you go for, Bukhara does it well.\\n\\nI will greatly miss Bukhara when I move out of their delivery area in a week. You will keep me frequenting JP until the end of my days."},{"name":"Thierry","address":"1059 Alberni Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Got a hot chocolate here. Not good.

Coming here on sunday nights after 10pm used to be a summer ritual before the bills started racking up and I have to eat ramen for the rest of the week. All jokes aside, its actually pretty cheap if you come sunday nights after 10pm since its half off on (select) sushi. The price is good but the sushi itself is good as well. I always get the philly cheese steak because it has steak in the sushi with melted cheese on top. Their makis are usually pretty good too, the spicy salmon maki has a good crunch to it and that adds a bit of texture to the food. \\n\\nThe lights are usually dimmed so you cant talk bomb (selfies) pictures of your food without putting the flash on. But it adds a nice atmosphere to it, theres also a DJ sometimes but when I went they just played the Olympics. But I swear most of the time they have a DJ there blasting some lit tunes. Its like you're at a club, but your sitting down, not sweating, socializing, and eating good food with good company.\\n\\nThe service here is better compared to the one at Wollaston as well.

The text informed us that our counter seats were ready. When I'm not dining alone, the last place in the world I want to sit is at a counter. Hell, even if I had been eating alone, I would have done so begrudgingly (and only if really hungry). So, I texted back and asked if it was OK if we waited a little longer for a table. The response was nothing short of wonderful. \\"Sure, we can do that! It should be another half hour...\\" Wow! I'm so used to high demand places acting like they are doing you a huge favor to seat you where you want (or NOT seat you where you don't want). It's just been my experience lately and I suppose I may have a chip on my shoulder about it. But this was such a breath of fresh air and will make me a forever customer.\\n\\nThe restaurant is loud and bustling, but it's a celebratory atmosphere, with people who are in love with their food. Can't beat that. Soon we were right there with them, as plate after plate arrived: the scallion pancakes (crispy/salty delicious), the BEST bok choy I've ever had, the so very transcendental tofu stirfry with slippery noodles (texture fest! And an extremely pleasing flavor) and crispy spring rolls that I devoured so quickly, they were barely even there. What I loved about these is all that swiss chard complicating things and making them better. Loved. Loved. Loved.
