There were two other females in the kitchen that tried to offer some suggestions, but the rude lady kept interrupting them saying \\"we don't do that\\".

However, that being said the fact that Pip's are all made to order is what makes this establishment so damn good. The doughnuts are hot, crispy and fluffy all at the same time when you get them which only enhances the individual flavors. For example, the salt sticks so much better and the nutella starts to melt making it all the more delicious. \\n\\nI tried all the flavors, and I have to say the Dirty Wu followed by the maple Bacon were my top two favorites but in reality all of them were pretty good and had something to offer.

The tip was already included on our final bill, yet the signature form still included a space for an additional tip.  We pointed this out to our friends from the UK. Those who don't pay attention to their bill will likely overtip.\\n\\nThe place was definitely crowded with people who want to try the restaurant. Our wait for 1 hour, 20 minutes to get a table. Once inside, the layout seemed very haphazard and ineffective for the staff. The restaurant is very loud with a combination of drunken adults and screaming children.\\n\\nThe coffee wasn't even warm, much less hot. Iced tea was very weak. My milkshake was warm and runny.

I usually see three places- Pollo Asado, Mozart Bakery, and Hello Chicken.  It's funny because I will be having a conversation with a friend and I just drift off, staring at Hello Chicken.  On Saturday, The anticipation was killing me, so we left, and crossed the street (which is fun if you are a pedestrian in slippers IMO) and went in.\\n\\nFor a Saturday afternoon, the place was empty, but spacious.  It looked like it had the same setup as the restaurant before it (I can't remember the name though, I just remember the dirty lobster tank inside the doors- which is now gone).  It is like each table almost has its own partition.  The tables are large, I think good enough for a UYE (hint, hint Daniel B).\\n\\nWe got seated, and looked at the menu.  One side is regular stuff, and the other side is lunch specials.  Now, mind you, it seems that the lunch specials only run Monday-Friday, which also means they only sell boneless chicken Monday through Friday (part of the specials).  Maybe this is why it was not crowded on a Saturday afternoon.\\n\\nThe menu is almost family oriented as well, which is good for families or groups of people.  For $19.99 you can get diff types of chicken with a few sides that serves 2-3 people.  They also have a $49.99 option which can feed 3-4 people.  There is also a la carte options, along with chicken wings, topokki, rice, noodles, pancakes, and even Shin ramen.\\n\\nFor me, I saw they had tacos @ 3.50 a piece, so I got one chicken, fish, and bulgogi taco.  They also have a tofu one, but no thanks.  I got a side of Shin ramen for shits n giggles.  The server was very friendly too, I did not catch her name.\\n\\nWhen the food came out, I was impressed.  The tacos were a decent size (with flour tortillas FYI), and each taco tasted unique, but had a nice crunch to them.  The fish was great too, something I was almost skeptical in getting.  The three tacos did me in, as I had trouble finishing the Shin ramen.\\n\\nWhen it was time to pay, the ladies were very nice and waved goodbye.  It gave me a warm feeling inside.  Since this place sells Korean fried chicken, I would really wish that they would sell the boneless option on the regular, because I am really curious (I mean, it was great on the taco!) as to how it stands alone- and I don't like eating at places during lunch rush if I don't have to...  \\n\\nThis is a solid spot, I think it worth checking out at least once!

We parked in the orange parking garage ( they had two, orange and Lime) and it was free. what I liked in the garage is, it will actually tell you if the level you choose has any open spots as they have sensors at each parking spot so you don't waste your time driving around the garage endlessly. we visited this mall in offseason, still, it was crowded in the evening. \\n \\ncoming to the mall, I guess it was for me, For folks that don't want to actually go to Disney World ( i spent 3 days in Universal) but want a little Disney in their lives, Disney Springs satisfies that. it will take you about 5 to 6 hours to get around the site. \\nThat's if you wander into each shop. With a massive Lego store to Disney Marvel and star wars stores,  Beauty shops and high-end Disney clothing shops. I liked the coke store though very much.  This is not an outlet store complex so expect prices to be higher.  The sprawling promenade features 4 distinct neighborhoods, The Landing, Marketplace, West Side and Town Center--built around bubbling springs. \\n\\n\\n There are tons of restaurants (and plenty of them also have nightly entertainment. some even have a 21+ after hours, which I really like) and there are things to do for kids and adults. Rainforest, Trex is the most popular one. there are plenty of attractions for visitors like us\\nI love the layout as well because it's not too small or big and you can't really get lost. If you're a photographer like me, there are a lot of areas to take colorful photos.  At night, there are several entertainers and that's also fun to see all the creatives come out and it's fantastic that it's not extra to enjoy their work. There's a hot air balloon that takes riders straight up in the air that looks like it would provide a great scenic view.\\n\\nThere is also a bowling alley and AMC Theatre. It is very vibrant and full of energy. Near the Boathouse restaurant and bar, there was a DJ playing the best dance music and the crowd was rocking.  I do appreciate what Disney Springs had to offer. The welcome club has employees who solve your queries in quite effectively. they were very courteous when we enquired about the bus to the boardwalk. It's really low key and people are just shopping and having fun. No lines of humans waiting to get on rides, no exorbitant admissions fees; just the ability to hang out in a Disney-themed shopping district, eat, drink, and have fun. \\n\\nI took the bus ( behind coke store) to Disney boardwalk. you can ride the bus free to any Disney resort and parks. Great place to shop and fun til you drop!!"},{"name":"The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium And Savory Feast Kitchen","address":"Universal CityWalk Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt, but after speaking to the manager, Pedro, about our service and following it up with an email to Universal, with no real response, I just can't do it anymore.\\nOur waitress took forever and forever to come to the table.

I mean, freshly baked donuts is just one of the great joys of life and Pip's has it down to an art form. I was super looking forward to trying Pip's (barely made it to the airport for our flight) but it was worth it. There was a huge line out the door when we went (with good reason) and the line moves slow (made fresh to order) but stick around and eat them right away to get the best flavor. Nobody likes an old donut. They offer a free dozen donuts if you come within a week of your birthday so we were able to score on my husband's birthday. They are small so get 2 of each flavor to try everything!\\n\\nNUTELLA & SEA SALT: Self explanatory right? Nutella is good on everything so this was no exception. The dusting of sea salt didn't really do much for me since Nutella overwhelmed everything else but it was quite delicious. \\n\\nLEMON CURD (pear and Meyer lemon, almond, cardamon, vanilla, nutmeg): This one didn't taste as good mainly because the lemon curd was just so sour. I generally like lemon curd too! This was was just way too acidic and probably my least favorite one. \\n\\nRAW HONEY & SEA SALT: Another pretty self explanatory combination. Raw honey and pink himalayan salt. You can't really go wrong with this duo. The only thing I didn't like about this donut was the fact that the donut didn't really absorb the honey and kind of melted off the donut so I wasn't getting a huge burst of honey flavor. \\n\\nCINNAMON & SUGAR (raw organic cane sugar, cinnamon): This was delicious! But honestly how can you go wrong with cinnamon and sugar! It's an iconic combo for a reason and it was really tasty. \\n\\nTHE DIRTY WU (cinnamon/sugar, raw honey, Nutella, sea salt):  This donut was named one of the 12 best donuts in America by Huffington Post and with good reason! This was our favorite donut out of all the ones we tried. Absolutely mind-blowing and definitely one to order again!\\n\\nCANDIED BACON (house made candied bacon maple jam, maple syrup): I personally did not like this donut as much but I'm not a huge fan of candied bacon to begin with. My husband liked it but he also likes anything with meat so it made sense that he would enjoy this. \\n\\nThe only thing that I would change about these donuts is maybe changing up the batter for some of the flavors.

It was still slightly overcooked but I got it right after they brought it out from the kitchen so that could explain why it wasn't as overcooked as my previous one. My husband also agreed that the lobsters really varied in quality. He had a couple decently cooked ones and some really overcooked ones. I guess if you were unlucky with your draw, just line up and get another one in hopes of getting a better quality lobster. The turnover is pretty quick with the lobster trays so chances are you  could end up with a non-overcooked lobster. I definitely agree with others here that this place isn't really good for its quality of food and it's more for quantity. With tax and tip, the two of us walked away paying 90 bucks. This place is more for people like us, first timers that are curious about how all-you-could-eat lobster places are like but not worth a second visit."},{"name":"Maya Indian Bar and Grill","address":"33 Tuttle St","city":"Wakefield","stars":"4.5","text":"So glad we found this place!

The prices to me are also on the low end for how much food you get on your platter and the quality of the meal. \\n\\nTo start I ordered the empanada, which was crispy, flavorful and had the perfect mix of sweetness in the shell and sour with the lime. We split aguadito (which is a chicken soup with rice and cilantro) and it was definitely enough for two people to split as a first course or one person as a main course. The dish brought me back to the meals my parents made as I was growing up. \\n\\nAs a main course i ordered the pure con asado ( a beef stew of the sorts with mashed potatoes and rice.)

Not sure how or why that's happening, and I've only received an apology for it once. They also said they upsized my queso for my wait (they didn't). \\n\\nThe burritos are decent. They're warm, and have anything you could want on a burrito on them - tomatoes, onions, beans, rice, steak. Salsa and queso are an extra charge, so I definitely don't like that. And as many times as I've tried to like the hot sauces here, they're just not that great.

We don't get to Portland often. So far, it's been once a year. We always try to eat at new-to-us restaurants, especially when it's in an area we aren't always in. So when we came to Portland this weekend, we ate at three new-to-us restaurants for four of our meals, and made sure we stopped in to Blue Star on our way out of town. They didn't disappoint the first time, and they definitely did not disappoint this time.\\n\\nThis particular shop is super cute and clean. Still loving the decor and layout. The gals working the counter were very nice and left us alone until we came to a decision on what flavors to get. There wasn't a line this time, since we were there early enough in the day, which was also great because they weren't sold out of any flavors yet. It was difficult to not buy one of everything. We ended up with a couple Mexican hot chocolates, a couple blueberry bourbon basils (a favorite from last time), and the Valrhona chocolate crumble, Meyer lemon and key lime curd, orange and olive oil, and the apple brandy crumble. Every single one of them were awesome. I can't pick a favorite. I thought I absolutely loved the orange and olive oil... until I had the apple brandy one. I'm about to go have a Mexican chocolate one, so we'll see if it's the new favorite.\\n\\nI cannot express how much we love Blue Star. In my last review for the other shop, I'm pretty sure I mentioned how Portland's other famous doughnut shop has nothing on Blue Star, and I am happy to reiterate. I'm glad to see that Blue Star still seems to be doing well and I hope that maybe one day, their success will bring them to Seattle/greater Seattle area. I (and my waist line) would be in some serious trouble if they ever made it to my specific area - which I know won't happen - but being able to pop into Seattle for a fix would be phenomenal.

Perfect location for all the sites in Boston!  We were in Boston in late June for a Red Sox weekend and this is the hotel selected by the Red Sox Destinations group.  Due to an early flight, we arrived at the hotel at 9:10am thinking they would store our luggage until that afternoon.  To our surprise, our room was ready and we checked it within minutes!  I requested a high floor and they put us on the 38th floor (the top floor), corner room with beautiful views of the river and the city!  The hotel is less than a mile from Fenway and very centrally located to the North End, Boston Commons and all the sites.  Literally hundreds of restaurants and shops within a short walking distance.  Our room was perfect for the little bit of time we spent in it.  I asked the housekeeper for extra shampoo since there were 3 of us.  She left 10 bottles of each toiletry item and towels galore!  The revolving doors are automatic so it was interesting to get in/out of them.  If you didn't pay attention, you will go around and around.  Yes, I admit I did that lol.  The valet service guys were awesome and called us taxi's within seconds of walking up.  One gentleman suggested we take a luxury private car vs a taxi back to the airport for only $30.  It was less than a taxi and much more luxurious!\\n\\nFood note:  the hotel has a breakfast buffet restaurant which is quite expensive.  One day we grabbed sandwiches at the Starbucks on the 2nd floor.  Everybody had the same idea as us because the line was incredibly long.  There is an awesome Star Market across the street - like a Whole Foods or Fresh Market with lots of prepared foods.  Duck Boat Tours start from here too which was very convenient!"},{"name":"Lamberts Downtown Barbecue","address":"401 W 2nd St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"It's a solid BBQ place with excellent atmosphere and drinks.

It's just so outdated now. Like, nothing is the same -- except, of course -- the things that really matter. \\n\\nSo do me a favor and go read my old review and tell me I'm funny (lie to me if you have to). And I'll update you here with what's going on at HCT.\\n\\nI still hate Joe. He's still this beautiful human (both inside and out) who is doing good in the world, and delicious Nashville-style fried chicken is his vehicle for doing so. Joe's employment model is all about giving folks a second chance to re-enter the workforce when most companies won't. That alone is worth five stars.\\n\\nBut then there's the food. It's so delicious; it'll make you hate Joe too. You'll hate him for bringing such joy to your life that I guarantee you'll crave on a regular basis. Even though HCT has moved from a pop-up in Olde Towne East to the shining jewel of the North Market, the humble menu is mostly still the same: delicious Nashville-style fried chicken, with varying cuts and degrees of hotness. There's even a \\"cold\\" version if you just want good ol' fried chicken that's not spicy at all. Sides are mac and cheese and coleslaw, and dessert is a salty and buttery banana pudding (that is legit perfect). You can round out your meal with the always-free sweet tea. Homemade ranch is available for chicken dipping; it might sound weird, but trust me on this one. And this just in: they now have UNSWEET tea too so you can cut that southern-sweet tea a little bit. \\n\\nSeating is long community benches, so if you're looking for an intimate space or if you think you're too bougie to sit by strangers -- this might not be the place for you. If you don't have stranger danger, it's really fun to make new friends and bond over your newfound delicious chicken joint.\\n\\nHere are a few quick tips to hopefully make your HCT experience even better:\\n+Check their social media accounts before making the trek to the North Market. They keep it updated with how many meals are left each day!\\n+Weekends are going to be the craziest, obviously. You should try a weekday lunch instead!\\n+There's a Yelp check-in offer for FREE banana pudding!\\n+Don't forget to get your parking validated and save yourself some $$$. \\n\\nHaving a meal at Hot Chicken Takeover should be on everyone's must-do list.

The coffee machine was not in the room but fixings were, one of the phones didn't work, the clock didn't work and the TV had a busted/shattered screen so also did not work. We even had to buy our own toilet paper. One of the beds' mattresses was still in the plastic wrap so none of the bedding stayed on. It was very uncomfortable and noisy. I called the front desk 4 times over two days and left messages trying to get one pillow. They finally answered the 4th time I called and I was told they were out of pillows. I told them all the things listed above and all they offered was a new phone. The property grounds has a lot of potential but the property itself is run down. There is a large courtyard but the pool and hot tub were not working (prime summer season) so we couldn't really utilize anything but the outdoor space. There is mold on the corridor walls, the elevator in the West building didn't work most of the weekend and our bathroom had mold too.

I called in advance to make reservations but they said people are seated on a first come first serve basis, so just a heads up on that !\\n\\nMy first impression was that the service was pretty good.  The server made recommendations on what was popular on the menu, and always checked up on us to see if we needed anything -- which was almost too often that it got annoying.  It's good to follow up, but not so much that it feels like it interrupts conversation to that extent!  Perhaps it was because more than one person was checking up on us, it felt a little overwhelming.  \\n\\nNow, onto the food.  I got the Vancouver Breakfast and my friend got the Toulouse.  Both of us were quite impressed with the sausages, which are made in-house!  I'm normally a \\"bacon-only\\" type person, but after tasting these sausages I'm a little more open minded! The onion jam was a little bit weird.... maybe it's because it looked a lot like fig jam and what I thought it would taste like didn't quite match up with what it actually tasted like.  Oh well!  I still finished it all.  haha.  The toast was pretty over-toasted and almost too hard to chew.. and coffee was just okay, nothing special. \\n\\nOverall I thought it was a cute little place, but I don't know if it's worth the drive out again.

With 5 locations in Vancouver and a massive menu of all your favorites, you can't go wrong!\\n\\nI'm loving the renovations they finished just in time for the holidays, super colourful and a little more modern but keeping the Asian look and feel. The food is just as good as ever too! Loved their cocktail menu, tried the Red Lotus Lychee cocktail that was slushy and even had a raw lychee on top! We started off with the Kerabu salad that they split for us, so refreshing and jam packed with flavours. Then for some appies, we had my 2 favorites, Roti Canai and Chicken Satay. The sauce they use with the roti is out of this world, it's so amazing, you need extra for sure! Gimme a tub of it!\\n\\nFor dinner with tried some new items. The seafood Gulai was a delight. Full of scallops, prawns, mussels, clams and more! The sauce was perfect, a concoction of tumeric, tamarind, galangal, lemongrass, ginger and my fav, coconut milk. Mmmm perfect over some coconut rice! We also tried the pineapple fried rice that came in a fresh pineapple which was fun and exciting! Another suggestion that is my fav there but we didn't have this night is their Mee Goreng, one of my favourite noodle dishes from my trip to Malaysia years ago. Mmm so good. Lastly for dessert we tried the deep friend bananas, mmm a typical dessert that never gets old.\\n\\nMy suggestion would be, make a reso and order the chefs choice 11 course meal. Ya you can get the other smaller course meals but why not just go for the 11 course? Try everything! You won't be disappointed with their authentic flavours!\\n\\nThey have 5 locations across Vancouver, from Broadway, Kits, Robson, Denman, and Davie.

Prices seemed to be reasonable for some things and expensive for others. I had a sore throat and wasn't feeling great, so I decided to order the ox bone soup with potato noodles ($9.95 CAD).\\n\\nThe ox bone soup is known in Korean as sul lung tang. It is boiled to the point that the broth is clear and a milky white. The soup arrives unseasoned, so you add salt and pepper based on your preference. I liked the soup as it was just what I needed to fight my sore throat. The meat inside the soup though was a bit on the tough side. The soup could have used some green onions on top, but none were provided.\\n\\nWhile banchan (side dishes) is usually offered when you are eating at Korean restaurants, I didn't receive any. I think it is because I ordered soup. For the entrees that do include banchan, they only give you a few sides here whereas other places may give you 5 or 6 items.\\n\\nThe service left something to be desired. Basically my interaction was limited to when I made my order and when I got my meal. It was a busy evening though, so I guess it was understandable that they might not have had time to check on how we were doing.\\n\\nI would rate this spot about 2.5 stars as I had a so-so experience here, but rounding down since the food portions were minimal and service was inattentive."},{"name":"Jersey Mike's Subs","address":"1489 Polaris Pkwy","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Traveling cross country it was difficult to find a Jersey Mike's on my route.

She's the kind of person that can read a crowd and she knew we were snarky, a little crude, and a ton of fun. She made a damn-fine cup of coffee (in the most adorable tea cups) and served up some wonderful conversation. Sometimes you can feel like your server is hovering but we adored having her all to ourselves for awhile.

Sorry folks, you can't have it both ways. Combining fine dining reserved seating style at a bar in a non-fine dining atmosphere simply breeds resentment and attempts to maintain order in an atmosphere hat inherently lacks order. While the hostess is directing people to the bar to grab a drink as they wait for a table not yet ready, the bar ought to be available. That aside, the bar team was wildly unprepared for the surge of customers and were unable to service both customers at the bar and put drinks out into the dining area for servers. Multiple parties both seated at the bar and standing were never able to place orders with the bar tenders. In fact, one gave me a creepy smile yet failed to actually take an order as he turned away and continued to ignore customers waiting to place orders. Two not goods: Not good to not serve customers efficiently and not good to take reservations at a bar. It is just that after all - a bar.\\n\\nA bar back does finally offer to serve beer and wine. Unfortunately, the focus of the two extremely overwhelmed fellows is on the dining room and not the patrons before their own eyes.  \\n\\nThe food has a consistent theme throughout every dish from raw selections to vegetables to meat: Its all very bland. The dishes lack punch. From a couple of guys who certainly know how to make good food, this is extremely disappointing.\\n\\nA raw bar order of King crab ($23) brings two bites of crab. Russian style dressing served as dipping sauce steals the show.\\n\\nAlso sampled, the Uni ($11) is smallish and has approximately three unspectacular bites. The inside of the fresh urchin is mixed into a watery mess with crunch and mustard seeds. This presentation is a travesty that undermines the sweet, richness of the delicacy that is used so well in the pasta at Coppa. \\n\\nThe raw bar menu also includes periwinkles, razor clams, oysters, shrimp, poke and other offerings.\\n\\nThe grilled avocado - a half avocado in the skin with sunflower seeds and creme fraiche, lime. Interesting idea but not tasty - mostly lime flavor and well, avocado.\\n\\nSilver corn with Marrow and bonnito. The only noticeable flavors are bonito and corn. Parmesan is apparent in stingy gobs but not available in taste, nor are \\"aioli\\" or hot sauce.\\n\\nThe Manti ($14) is an ravioli filled with tasteless meat and topped with garlic red pepper butter and sour cream. Both sour cream and butter are completely absent in flavor. For a dish with Moroccan origins, I'd imagine taste buds would be inspired. Not here.\\n\\nMatzoh ball ramen is a bowl of thin, watery, chicken broth poured into egregiously overdone noodles that have been cooked into mush. The matzoh balls themselves are dense and slightly sweet. No saving this wreck.\\n\\nThe Texas style beef rib has virtually no beef flavor and is overpowered by smokiness - it's not natural smoke flavor. It's added smoke flavor. Almost as if the cooked meat has been dosed with liquid smoke or placed in an electric cold smoker for a few minutes before being sliced off the bone. The meat is tender but true BBq this dish is not.\\n\\nService upon being seated is efficient and polite. The recommended 2-4 dishes per person seems to be about right. \\n\\nThere's no reason the travel to this Central square spot that can't seem to locate the spice rack. The menu sounds inspiring, the food is visually stunning but the taste profiles are unabashedly monochromatic."},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"Visiting our daughter and family in Austin Texas we decided to have dinner at the famous Oasis  restaurant on Lake Travis.

The food is in the Tex-Mex style and is casual but very good. Not the best, but very good. The place was really, really crowded. We waited an hour for a table for 8It was also quite noisy and quite hectic. There is indoor as well as outdoor seating. I'd say the place probably seats somewhere between 800 and 1000 people at a time spread across many balconies. Service was hectic as well. The deal here is the view. You just cannot beat the view. The place is built like a eight or 10 story castle hanging off the side of a mountain with fabulous eclectic artwork spread everywhere throughout the facility. Music is playing constantly and the place is really hopping. This is a great people watching place. They have a huge multi story parking garage adjacent. The prices are a little high but fair.

Shocker! haha he did good for once. We came here for Monday brunch, it was quite close proximity to where we were staying. 5 mins drive! \\n\\nThe place was cute and very cozy as we were walking in. Nice and toasty since it was extremely chilly and windy that day. A gentleman greeted us and sat us down within minutes. And our waitress took our orders swiftly. I got the Geraldine with queso fries while he ordered the Mister T. Both dish did not disappoint. Very tasty for both. The Mister T sandwich was very crusty and extra crispy with the fries inside. The wagyu was slightly cooked too well done for my taste but nonetheless good overall. His salad was kinda lifeless but not bad. Too much greens for me. Haha but oh my, The Geraldine was huge! Literally one of the juiciest chicken sandwich I've ever had. They didn't overkill my chicken. Very moist and tasty. Loved the bacon strips on it. I wish they had used lettuce instead of spring mix. It was just so messy to eat with leave falling everywhere. The queso fries were savory and delish. Extra crispy fries and bacon drenched in queso? Definitely can't go wrong with that! \\n\\nOverall, food was great. Service was amazing. Everyone checked up on us and our dining experience went smoothly. In n out within a hour.

Old seafood smell waiting for you at the door, oysters were a joke, the guy behind the bar didn't even know what fish was in the sushi and the crawfish was cold and flavorless. Crab legs and corn were probably the two best things here along with lobster claws. Then you would have to make several trips for at least one serving of crab since all of the pieces seemed to be meant for kids 10 and under.  I got tired of eating before I got full and now I'm actually sitting at home with an irritated stomach. Save yourself the $50 and just go to red lobster instead.

And even though we found no restrooms, we were able to relax for a minute in comfy overstuffed chairs and enjoy complimentary ice cold water. I agree with other reviewers that in spite of the cozy feel, the space is not optimized for seating, and I'm sure most guests are forced to stand while waiting when the Welcome Center is busy. I noticed some kind of portable battery vending machine in the corner but people were crowded around it... good to know those are available if I need to replace one of mine in a pinch.

The weather yesterday was crazy and it was finally chilly enough for my pho craving to set in. I called around to a few different places to ensure they had vegetarian broth and this place quickly confirmed (yes, Yelp said they had it but I gotta make sure). My friend and I trekked over there and immediately grabbed a table, despite the fact that the place was almost full. We obviously weren't the only pho addicts whose craving set in with the nippy weather. \\n\\nThe waiter was very attentive and took our order right away. We each got a bowl of pho and we split the veggie spring rolls. Everything came out so quickly! Either that or I was distracted by the Cavs game being on. Pretty sure it was quick as hell tho. \\n\\nThe spring rolls were delicious and obviously fresh af. I LOVE peanut sauce and the flavor with theirs was on point, it was just a little runny. I prefer when it's thicker and really sticks to the roll instead of just running off. \\n\\nNow, the veggie pho wasn't terrible but it definitely wasn't my favorite. The broth could have used more flavor, it sorta fell a little flat. I added some hot sauce and what not to give it some oomph but it was weird that I even needed to add salt. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the tofu was great. I'd say my main complaint was that the veggies were cut up so small that I had to spoon them out instead of simply using my chopsticks. I even questioned as to whether or not they were fresh because they didn't look it. I like it better when I can actually pick up the piece of carrot or celery or bok choy. My friend on the other hand, he ate the entire bowl of his and said it was fantastic. I'm realistic and I know that veggie broth can be more difficult. \\n\\nI may be back, but I'm definitely going to continue to search for the best vegetarian pho in Columbus."},{"name":"The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium And Savory Feast Kitchen","address":"Universal CityWalk Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This is my husband's and my first visit and will be our last visit.

The food looked amazing on the website and the desserts and milkshakes out of this world, so I was looking forward to an incredible chocolate experience, but it reality it was a huge letdown.  First of all they do not take reservations, and after navigating the Citywalk parking lot and entrance and running through the crowds in the rain, we arrived soaking wet at 6:30 pm to a jam packed entry, only to be told the wait was at least 90 minutes. Since I was determined to experience chocolate nirvana, we decided it would be worth the wait and when we received our text at 8:05 that our table was ready we ran back to the restaurant only to stand behind the crowded hostess stand for another 20 minutes until someone finally took us to our table upstairs and sat us behind a large black pillar.  The place was jam packed and it was obvious the staff was overwhelmed.  We watched as the servers delivered incredibly over the top milkshakes and desserts to the tables around us as we waited another 10 minutes before our server took our drink order and handed us a menu.  We both ordered a cup of French Onion Soup of which the broth was delicious, but lacking the golden topped bubbly crusted melted cheese oozing over the sides.  Instead, it was topped with a lackluster square of Swiss(?) slightly melted cheese, which had none of the visual appeal of their desserts.  We also ordered the mushroom gratin appetizer which was tasty, but was served without any accompaniment at all and we ended up having to eat it by the spoonful out of the dish as the server never brought us any appetizer plates.  For our entrees, my husband ordered the brisket meatloaf, while tasty was nothing out of the ordinary.  I ordered the gnocchi which were very doughy and not at all like the perfect pillows of potato perfection I was expecting, and the sauce tasted like burnt butter and did not match it's menu description.  There were thinly shaved bits of chicken in the dish as well, but the whole dish was very disappointing.  But then again we were really here for the desserts and after watching they vast array of incredible concoctions pass our table I decided on the flourless chocolate cake with nutella ice cream which turned out to be disappointing as well.  The ice cream was creamy and yummy, but the cake, while it had the intensely dark chocolate flavor I was looking for, was not as dense as others I have had, and felt somewhat undercooked.  My husband who is a big dessert guy and was tempted by the peanut butter milkshake, did not even bother to order anything for dessert as he was not impressed with the rest of our dinner.  And to make things even worse, I ordered a cup of tea along with my dessert, and when it finally arrived at least 10 minutes after my dessert was delivered to the table, it was in one of the smallest cups ever, and after another 10 minutes, my husband had to find a manager to bring my cream and sugar which I requested when I placed the order.

His name was Bill and he was also the one making my hot and fresh breakfast sliders with sausage egg and cheese. It only took about three minutes but it was worth the wait. The short wait that is. Even the other person who brought my food was smiling and happy to serve. The food was fresh and hot.

I can't get enough.\\n\\nSo when this place opened up, I figured I'd give it a shot since it's closer to town. Verdict: The meat is just as good as the original, but the ambience is lost. You can't duplicate the experience of sitting outside with a beer and live music.\\n\\nThey added weird sh... stuff... to their menu, like something flambe and spring green something or other... they have fish dishes, steaks, etc... stuff that the original wouldn't dream of.

I've been going to Quoc Huong for years and wanted to compare. \\n\\n=  Ambiance is a bit of a hole in the wall in a small shopping center on BuHi just north of Clairmont Rd NE.  \\n\\n+  I decided to try their popular pork and also chicken banh mi loaded.  They both looked scrumptious!  Their chicken was a little bland and a little dry even with plenty of pickled veggies.  It came with a raw jalape√±o slice that when I bit into shot a little bit of flame into my mouth.  Their pork was a little better because I added Sriracha and rice vinegar when I got home.  \\n\\n+. Service was prompt.  When you walk in their order counter is about 3 feet from the entrance and there was a short line.  They were fluent in English (compared to Quoc Huong) and took less than 5 minutes for my sammies!  \\n\\n+. My two sammies cost $7.  Lee's has different prices for dine in vs. take out. If you buy 5 then 6th is free but you are limited to 2 varieties of banh mis.  Their price is slightly higher than QH but still very fair.  \\n\\n+. Parking is shared with other retailers in the shopping center and was able to park on the side.  \\n\\nOver all, I still prefer Quoc Huong's chicken banh mi the best and their picked veggies have more flavor.  However, Lee's pork banh mi is better than QH's. Bread-wise, they are about same for me.

A cold, dreary Saturday in fact....with the breath smoke and everything....hoping we'd be the only fools to be out.  WRONG.  \\n\\nWe rolled up on a really nice expanse of property.  A separate gift shop barn that we sped through to get to the action...a huge barn with a bar and music.  I'm not gonna lie...I hadn't eaten all day so if they didn't have food we would have turned around and left in minutes, Hangry Bear demands it!  But we were pleasantly surprised to find they did have a small selection of food (for now, restaurant due to open soon), including a burger, which always tames Hangry Bear and would help soak up the onslaught of booze we were about to (ahem, continuing to) consume.\\n\\nTreaty Oak now produces just about every type of liquor you would need.  Bourbon, gin, rum and vodka...so pick your poison.  I started with their grapefruit gin drink which is premade but was really strong and tasty if a bit sweet for me.  I then switched to the ole standby of vodka and soda while hubby enjoyed his usual bourbon and coke.  We easily found a spot at a picnic table and enjoyed the Bob Wills sounding, rockabillyish slide guitar duo that were playing.  LOVED those guys. Brother Shaw's Texas Swing Revival was perfect for the scene.\\n\\nThe burgers came out fast and were delicious...nothing crazy weird about them, just plain ole juicy cheeseburger.  And the place filled up, with couples, tour bus crowds, dogs, toddlers dancing and what I think was a bachelorette party that squealed and laughed to the rafters with their party games.  \\n\\nOverall, it was just a damn happy place to be and I bet, once we are officially ensconced in this 'hood, you will find us there often.

My mum and dad were in agreement, so we made a booking for a late dinner. \\n\\nFor drinks, I asked for the non-alcoholic \\"Hibiscus High\\" and then for our appetizer, we had the BBQ calamari, with my main being the Tonkotsu Ramen, my dad got the Shoyu Ramen and then my mum got the Bibimbap.\\n\\nSo starting with drinks, my glass had so much ice, when I had specifically requested light-ice. I drank it but I felt the true taste of the drink was super diluted down by the massive amount of ice. For the BBQ Calamari ($9), I found the hoisin sauce was too sweet for my taste. I didn't like it on the calamari and if was to return, would ask for that sauce to either be served on the side, or omitted all together. My mum too found the sauce too sweet for her taste. The crushed peanuts were a nice touch, but I'm not sure what they honestly added to the dish, apart from being a nice garnishing touch.\\n\\nAs regards our Ramen dishes, I loved the pork belly that came with the Tonkotsu, but if I was being impartial, I have tasted much better and richer broth prior. The Lake meadow egg was a knockout and I reckon worth paying to even get an additional portion. My Dad found his Shoyu to be overall very robust in taste, with a good serve of the chicken, but he had paid for an extra serve of veggies - and it didn't really look like his veggie to noodle + broth/ chicken ratio was significantly higher. \\n\\nWith my mum's Bibimbap ($18) we had requested another serve of pork belly or vegetables instead of the bulgogi (we don't eat beef) and also requested the julienned ginger to be served on the side. Mum got a delicious bowl of miso soup with this main but she found her veggies disappointing. There was just really carrot and that was mainly it. Also her rice was too crunchy - almost to the point of getting burnt. And the julienned ginger was just omitted all together - it didn't come on the side as requested.\\n\\nIt was an overall pleasant meal, but based on the items we ate, none of us are rushing to go back anytime soon. It might have behooved us to instead get some sushi instead, since that is what is in the title of the restaurant and the subject of a lot of previous glowing Yelp reviews. I might return, just to see if the sushi lives up to the hype, but I wouldn't get any of the menu items I chose during this visit. \\n\\nYelp 191/ 2017\\n(9 more to go to achieve 200 new places reviewed on Yelp this year!)"},{"name":"Zaftigs Delicatessen - Brookline","address":"335 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"My boyfriend selected this place after browsing Yelp.

My boyfriend ordered the empire poached eggs and I, the stuffed French toast. The french toast was too soggy...probably because it was stuffed with soggy/mushy bananas. The empire poached eggs were not anything special...perhaps the best part was the 2 free plates of bagel chips. \\n\\nThe atmosphere was very loud--I often found myself talking SO loud because of the competing voices.

Some of the busses do not take you directly to the parks but you can take a bus and from the resort you can take the monorail. It does take about 1 hr of your Disney experience but parking at the theme parks are about 17-20$/ day.\\n\\nOverall, Downtown Disney is enjoyable if traveling with kids or want to walk around and just relax.

I've had Nashville hot chicken before and know the heat level can really knock you over, but we just wanted some good tasting chicken with a little spice to it.

The only thing I would say is the price is slightly steep for it, but at least they don't rack you up for an additional few $ per person for tea and if you get the meal you get mac and cheese and slaw. Everything was well done, tasted fantastic, and got rave reviews even from the Kentucky Fried Chicken snob among us (and no, KFC is not what she bases good fried chicken on).

Besides cannolis, they have a giant selection of other baked items in the displays underneath the counters but it is quite hard to see all of it if it's busy(which it almost always is).

We were seated in a few minutes. Service was a little slow, so be ready to flag down your waiter when you want something. \\nWe tried a couple appetizers, one sushi roll and two entrees. Everything we had was really good. The beef negimaki was tasty, but the sauce lacked something. The shrimp tempura roll was pretty standard. The calamari was done karaage style, so the breading was better (lighter) than traditional fried calamari. It didn't need any sauce. That was the best out of the three appetizers. \\nThe miso soup is included and it was good. My bibimbap was tasty. I ordered it with extra veggies but I'm not sure it came out that way. Seemed pretty basic, so the gochujang sauce was helpful. I loved how the rice got super crispy in the bowl. It was one of those hot stone bowls and it just kept cooking! I should have chosen an extra egg. The peppered steak was the best dish. Really nice, choice cuts of steak, prepared to your liking. Very good. And the Brussels sprouts that came alongside were awesome. \\nFor drinks, we had the Japanese whiskey flight, beer and green tea. I must say, they have quite the Japanese whiskey selection. The craft beer we ordered was so tasty. But the tea was disappointing. I expected a tea pot, with the green tea steeping. Instead, I got a mug with a tea bag in it. Anyone can serve green tea in a bag!!! And then you only get one cup! What a rip off. They need to change that. \\nWe skipped dessert. Parking is on the street so good luck there. Bathrooms are clean. Overall, a good experience. But I wouldn't say this place is traditional for Japanese. There's a lot of fusion on the menu. And hey, I ordered a Korean dish! Lol.

We had dinner in the North End one night and decided we just had to take the (Dramatic music queue) 'Great Cannoli Challenge'.  To be fair,  we got the same flavors at both places, traditional and chocolate...although there were lots more choices at Mike's. We walked to a park and eagerly dug in. First the traditional, with the most amazing crispy shell and not-too-heavy filling. Wow is this a good cannoli, but the star of the show for me was by far the chocolate cannoli. The filling was a light and airy whipped chocolate mousse. It was delicious and the moment I tasted it I instantly regretted not getting one to go for later. I reluctantly had to share it with 3 other people.  Mike's was our winner - it was unanimous!  Thanks for the fun Mike's, Modern, and the city of Boston!"},{"name":"Bamboo Wok","address":"2432 Sand Mine Rd","city":"Davenport","stars":"3.5","text":"Best Chinese take out in the area.

We came here Sunday morning, but the wait was too long so we decided to make reservations for Monday morning. Come Monday, we were seated right away. We ordered the Wild Salmon Hash ($16), the Kid's Pancake ($3) with bananas and chocolate chips ($2), Mini Breakfast ($5) off the kid's menu, and the Daily Special of made from scratch blueberry pancakes ($4.95)(half order). \\n\\nThe Wild Salmon Hash was an excellent order! The salmon hash was creamy and delicious, and came with lots of good pieces of salmon plus potatoes and leeks. The two eggs were cooked perfectly and the wheat toast was not bad. Since we were sharing, they split the order onto two plates, which we appreciated. \\n\\nThe blueberry pancake was also delicious! There were plenty of fresh blueberries throughout the pancake and tasted really good with the syrup. \\n\\nThe Mini Breakfast is a good value for kids. It comes with scrambled eggs, bacon, half a slice of wheat toast, and potatoes. \\n\\nThe Kid's Pancakes comes Mickey Mouse shaped and is a good size for kids. Although the chocolate chips were good, we didn't know the bananas were cooked into the pancakes as well. Although we like bananas, w didn't quite like the taste of the bananas in the pancakes. \\n\\nAlthough the food was good, the service was so so. Maybe because they were busy, but our server took a long time to come to our table, take our order, and then the wait for the food was REALLY long. Plus every time the server came by, he seemed in a rush to leave. He even sped through the day's specials so quickly, I had to ask him to repeat it later when he returned to take our order. \\n\\nOverall, Mother's is a great breakfast spot in downtown Portland for brunch.

I tried to order the spicy lobster roll, my ultimate favorite, but was told they had to discontinue it because something about the vendor changed and the new vendor didnt have the same quality so they decided to take it off the menu and that made me respect them as a whole to ensure quality remains priority. Our server was pretty busy serving some tables and running the bar, maybe they should have someone separate to run the bar because she was a little too busy to maintain her tables properly, not just ours but surrounding tables noticed as well.

We ended up drinking so much water  all night .\\n3) Other food selections were limited and very dry up and did not look fresh at all . \\n4) The service : our server was really nice and he was personable. We liked him . But the people who served Lobster acted like they were superior and they were passing out Lobsters for beggars. I was standing in line for one and when it was my turn , this guy picked up a lobster and tossed it on my plate, like he was annoyed.

I patiently waited. He continued to talk some more and finally without looking at me, he tossed that lobster on my plate and continued talking .

Other than exposing the personal and experiential limitations of the speaker, it only serves to remind me that the secret to happiness may be simple: lower your standards, and keep telling yourself there's nothing better out there.... which may also be the best relationship advice for your single friends ;-)\\n\\nAt the other end of the hype spectrum would be this assertion from Mike's pastry shop: \\"expect lots of company\\". What an understatement! This fine pastry shop is mobbed by people as if Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10 cheats were being leaked to the players of the game - which, once upon a time, used to be a wholesome form of entertainment. \\n\\nMy point is: it's a circus out here! Nothing I've seen in NYC or SF compares to the scene in here. The line (stretching a few blocks) may move fast, but it is chaotic inside and detracts from the overall experience. Just getting to some display cases requires you to elbow or practice your drop and slide skills, so that you can be seen, let alone served.\\n\\nI liked the (pre-filled) cannoli, but was not wowed. The chocolate cream version was an absolute waste of calories. The classic was better, the largest cannolo I've had. If size matters to you, then this might be the best you'd ever have! The shell was crisp, held together well (not flaky) but one could taste the fact that it was fried. The ricotta was smooth (not a hint of graininess) but a bit too sweet - even for me.  Given the size and sweetness, eating a whole cannolo after dinner at a nearby restaurant in North End, would make a gladiator proud. Battle hardened that I am, I went on to the Chocolate Florentine cannolo - and found that (due to the texture and nutty, toffee-ish flavor of the Florentine to complement the filling) to be the best version at Mike's. I was so raptured that I kept ignoring the 'No Entry' sign my stomach kept flashing after every bite!\\n\\nThe cookies, not the cannoli, would be the reason I prefer Mike's to Modern. The green dessera macaroon, pistachio nut macaroon, and the cruccanti crushed almond macaroon would be amongst the best macaroons I've had - even if the double 'o' agent cookie does not rule my heart the way the French macar'o'n does. The slight resistance offered initially by the crisp outer shell which slowly makes way for a deep, satisfying, and moist chew is the kind of magic that Harlequin romance novels can only hint at!\\n\\nI would think that macaroons are a clear sign that size does not matter. The satisfaction achieved from the smaller nut (almond/pistachio), as compared to that from the predictably bland, though larger (coconut), macaroon should give one pause for thought. \\n\\nSee: all the relationship issues in life that one grapples with - can be answered by dessert.

So Jessica goes in and leaves her name with the maitre d and he tells us there is a 40 minute wait for table for 2 but to check back with him in 30 minutes.  I like this guy and I can tell he cares about his customers.  To not have to loiter saves us time but guarantees us a table.  Logistically this helps the company not have a ton of people creating a fire hazard even if it generates attention.  Someone has thought this out.  So in the meantime, we ordered drinks from Starbucks, walked over, drank them and walked back.\\n\\nFlash forward 30 minutes later.  We return and even though there are still two couples ahead of us, neither show up back in time so he seated us.  Shortly after someone brought us glasses of water and menus.  Jessica ended up ordering the Apple and Vermont Cheddar Omelette while I went with the Mediterranean Omelette.  Jessica liked her dish and said the interesting thing about hers was the crunchiness and texture of the apples in each bite.  She also had a bagel with cream cheese and jam that she swears by.  My omelette was a delicious combination of spinach, black olives, and goat cheese.  I opted for the Rye bread and it tasted delicious whether we Orange Marmalade or the Grape Jam.  Both dishes were also served with potatoes and fruit.  Sherri took care of all the food and the service was wonderful.

I ordered the small personal size pizza special for 5.99. And it was the best small pizza I had ever had since moving into Austin from N.Y. one month before. Needless to say NY has some of the best pizza you can find on any block you on without complaining about eating a bad slice.

But.....\\n\\nUpon returning 1 month and 1/2 after promise pizza turned into pizza day...\\n\\n(to sadly put it it) The PROMISE that i was receiving before hand would NO LONGER be my PIZZA DAY. Once the transitioned was complete. So were the ingredients. Did I mention the customer service went down hill? You could immediately see all the red flags shown when a new owner or new management takes the reigns. And we're not speaking of GOOD ownership here. To shortly put it, the partner (turned owner) is not customer service friendly. That guy should be in an enclosed room with chair, desk , and computer dealing with the accounting side of things.

One was the special Molsen draft that they claim is only served in Canada and at Le Cellier. I have no idea if that was just crafty advertising or not, but it was a pretty good beer. Now for the food.\\n\\nThe meal began with an order of poutine fries and cheddar cheese soup. Both were excellent, but those fries were the star..

Well, is kinda like taking chances to try Peruvian food crossing your fingers that this time its better. Once again we though that it was the only Peruvian restaurant in town and we keep going there thinking that there were not more options. One time we commented to the owner Susanna about other Peruvian restaurants we went to like in Houston and San Antonio and we got the shiftiest remark from her about her competition even though those are located in other town away from her restaurant. That was not nice let alone professional from her side. \\nThe 2 last visits were our last:\\n1 months ago my husband as usual tried among other dishes the carapulcra and he was trowing up all night and was sick to work next day. We though that it could be something else and we let it go but 2 weeks ago, I tried the ceviche and I started to feel sick and also trow up all day and feel really bad for like 2 days. We went to the doctor and yes, apparently it was the food. \\nI called and ask to speak to the owner Susana to let her know about this last 2 incidents that made us so sick but after 2 messages left with the person whom answered the call, the owner not anyone called us back although I asked whom was the person or persons cooking during those day and if they were Peruvians, well I found out that they are not Peruvians working there nor cooking, except the owners but they don't do the cooking. I was shocked to know that and now I understand why the food sometimes doesn't taste like it should. \\nWe also noticed in one of our past visits previous to us getting sick that one of the male cooks after lunch hours was cleaning the bathrooms without cloves and them going back to the kitchen still without cloves. Aghhh seriously? That moment we though of course that he could washed his hands in the kitchen which still aghhh gross and maybe that's why people get sick eating there. \\nWe will never ever come back, sorry Susana but your lock of integrity among your competition and for not following up to phone calls about your customers getting sick for eating are your restaurant it's a very bad way of doing business. \\nAnd yes there are other better Peruvian restaurants in the area which we tried and the taste is wow completely different plus the authentic Peruvians people are cooking them. \\nBe aware of going to this restaurant, if you want to eat popular taste this is the place to go but if you really want to try good Peruvian good please don't cheat your self look in austin south, central and round rock you will be amazed. \\nWe traveled to peru 2 times now and we can tell the difference in the taste and quality. \\nOh by the way most of Lima Criolla reviews are from their friends, family and related people around their owners circle as we had being informed during a get together at a lat√≠n/Peruvian event. \\nWe do not recommended this restaurant for lock of integrity, professionalism, service, cleanses and so so food."},{"name":"International Roti House","address":"3703 Covington Hwy","city":"Decatur","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm addicted to doubles!

TWO AND HALF?! That's 10 PM! We grabbed a drink inside Krog Street Market and sat down to wait it out- fully expecting it to take no more than 1.5 hours- but lo and behold, they were true to their word! We probably didn't leave dinner until close to midnight, which is crazy. Another time we went on a Sunday evening, again at peak dinner time and again with 6 people, and we were again told it would be over two hours! Thankfully this time we were able to coerce the hostess to seat us a bit quicker, and it should be noted that we've passed by here since the Buckhead location opened and it's seemed sort of empty? \\n\\nAnyway, the food and drinks are the reason they can continue to quote such long wait times. First things first, their margaritas are so delicious- they taste fresh and sort of strong (but in a good way) and just like a margarita should taste. They have a great selection of beer/wine, as well, although their liquor drinks seem to steal the show. \\n\\nTheir chips and salsa are, predictably, incredible-- perfectly seasoned and always freshly fried! For dinner, I've had the sopa de tortilla and the ensalada de la casa with chicken, which may not sound like much, but both are amazing.

And I saw quite a few people (and there were quite a few people) also order the cannolis, so clearly it's a winner winner chicken dinner. But it was just too rich for my taste, and I ended up giving half of mine to my cousin, and then I chowed down on some of the other things that we bought (including three different cakes, and a fruit tart).

They are SUPER generous with the toppings and it's great for when you just want an aggressive amount of pizza. Crust is nice and chewy with a crisp golden texture on the outside. I've found the staff, especially the people working at the counter, to generally be pretty nice. The cleanliness is hit and miss--sometimes it's pretty good, but sometimes there's food bits on the floor and tables are left in-bussed. If you order ahead, the quoted times tend to be a little longer than your average pizza place--they generally start at 25-30 minutes and go up from there depending on how busy they are. \\nI would have given them four stars, but I had a customer service issue tonight that makes me wary. I placed an order and was quoted a 30 minute wait time. I noticed that there were several large orders so I didn't think much of it when 30 minutes passed and I didn't have the order. At 40 minutes, I checked with the guy at the counter. He told me that whoever was making my order left (?!?)--watching the prep staff talk, it looked like maybe my order had been lost somewhere. A woman who was working in the prep area let me know that I could either have the food made now, or she could refund me. I asked if I could get my food and be refunded or have some sort of credit/compensation for the fact that my order had been lost, and she told me that this was \\"[her] manager's policy\\" to either give a credit/coupon OR make the food, but if she made the food, I would be paying full price, despite the mistake. Eventually she let me know that she would make the order and give me a credit for next time, but not to expect this ever again, as this was not the manager's policy. She was kind of rude/unapologetic about the whole thing, but my bigger concern was the fact that Flying Pie's manager apparently has no interest in making things right if the staff makes a mistake. I'm not too interested in giving my money to businesses that take a \\"too bad, so sad\\" approach to problems, so I thought I would let you know in case you feel the same way.

I can understand problems with the kitchen, I can understand slow service, and I can understand being out of a key ingredient to a specific dish. But when all 3 of those things happen during not a very busy lunch hour, it ends up with a bad review. First, we ordered almond chocolate bread. Which was delicious, when it came 35 min after we ordered it. The waitress said the computers to the kitchen weren't communicating, and the order got lost... fine, BUT- you are a server and your job is to check on people. In the 35 minutes we waited for that bread and butter, she never once checked on us. She walked by us multiple times as she helped other tables around us, but she never stopped for us.  Then, when I finally had to go ask some other waitress to take care of us, she came back and told us about the miscommunication.  We finally got the bread, and then about 10 min later we got our food. Two Waldorf salads and a chicken breast. The chicken breast was lukewarm, and the salads were very lightly dressed and seemed like the end of the lettuce instead of the nicer leaves. Come to find out, when we complained about the lack of dressing on the salads, that they were actually out of the dressing for that particular dish. Which is something we should have been informed of, so that we could have gotten anything else. But we were so hungry (having been there for nearly an hour) we just ate the food anyway. \\n   The manager kindly listened to our complaints, comped our bread, and gave us a discount on the whole meal. But honestly, if I lived here and could come back- I wouldn't. The food wasn't good enough for bad service, and the service wasn't good enough for me to give mediocre food a second chance."},{"name":"Metro Diner","address":"946 W Mitchell Hammock Rd, Ste 1220","city":"Oviedo","stars":"4","text":"Great place.

We decided to make it our spot for dinner and headed that way after making a reservation. The host made sure to let us know that they were very full and that we should probably sit at the bar. The restaurant was more than half empty. We politely declined and waited for a table. He didn't seem thrilled by this. \\n\\nOnce we were seated we enjoyed the decor and ambiance upstairs. The booths were roomy and and the lighting was nice. The complimentary cornbread was actually very good. We decided to order the sausage platter, broccoli, and waffle fries. \\n\\nWe were confused when our \\"platter\\" arrived and it was two sausage links for $25. The sausage was good but not $12.50/link good. The broccoli was so beyond meh. My husband couldn't do more than one bite. They had a strong chemical smell coming off of them. We had to have our server take the bowl away immediately. The waffle fries were on par with a famous fast food chicken joint that isn't open on Sundays. And at quadruple the price, not worth it. \\n\\nWe left hungry, disappointed, and confused at all the recommendations for this place. I don't think anything could make us come back to Lambert's.

The pork was awesome, large serving of noodles. Also, broth to noodle ratio was perfect.\\nCucumber Salad: Probably my favorite plate of the night. The cucumbers are served rolled up like sushi rolls, and they have spicy, diced red peppers & feta on top. It was also served over some type of spice that was to die for. Super refreshing plate! I enjoyed having this in the middle, was almost like a palate cleanser, ha.\\nSwordfish: Usually my issue with swordfish is it tends to be somewhat dry, compared to other fish. But this was perfect. The taboleleh on top was awesome! \\n\\nAll in all, this place is great. Our server was so kind and helpful.

It splashed all over everyone in the area. My four year old son had huge amounts of chocolate milkshake all over his face, hair, shirt, and shoes. But for some reason no one except the girl who dropped the shakes seemed apologetic about this. The manager and the waiter of the table next to ours made a huge fuss over an adult lady who had gotten milkshake on her clothing, but not a word was said to my little boy who was upset about his sticky face and ruined clothes. Obviously accidents happen, and I felt sorry for the girl who dropped the milkshakes....she was genuinely sorry and seemed so embarrassed. But an apology or some sort of compensation should have been offered to my son who was sad about his ruined/stained clothing and having to spend the rest of the day with sticky skin.

The hostesses were friendly and conversational, and our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu and about other things Disney and worldly. \\n\\nWe ordered some drinks, specifically the magical star, and our entrees were the famous chicken and waffle and the lobster thermador burger.  The drinks most definitely weren't skimping on the alcohol and tasted delicious.  The glow cube is an interesting selling gimmick that was fun to look at, but only for so long when set to the pulse setting.\\n\\nThe food portions were absolutely massive.  The chicken was boneless and was served atop a single, giant waffle.  The salty and sweet flavors complemented each other so well, and the overall entree could have easily been split between two people with both parties being left full.  The lobster thermador burger was visually pleasing and excellent to the palate.\\n\\nAbsolutely nothing bad to say or to knock at the Grand Floridian Cafe.  10/10 will recommend and come back to dine again!"},{"name":"Vespaio Ristorante","address":"1610 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We celebrated Valentine's Day (Buon San Valentino Sunday),  February 14, 2010 at this upscale SOCO (South Congress) restaurant.   Overall, we loved the restaurant, service and food.  Highly recommended.  One half star lost for feeling a little rushed as they tried to push through as many customers as possible on valentines day.  One half star lost for a little too much oil taste on the sea food.  \\n\\nWe enjoyed the Chianti Classico - San Fabiano Calcumala 2006 ($12 per glass).   A Tuscany wine with a church on the estate which dates to 867 AD,  The church is dedicated to Pope Fabian, one of the first Christian martyrs killed in the Coliseum.  \\n\\nOur antipasto choice was a just made mozzarella ovouni, pereronata, baby arugula with serrano ham served beside two wedge shaped pieces of focaccia bruschetia ($12).  It was very good.  The focaccia was really good, the cheese ok and the ham very nice.  We liked the combination and recommend it.  \\n\\nFor her entr√©e Dona ordered the vegan special, mista di verdure, a mixed vegetable plate.  It consisted of a serving of roasted acorn, spaghetti squash, parmesan roasted tomato, grilled proccolini and black truffle mashed potatoes ($20):   Dona loved the combination both taste and presentation.\\n\\nI ordered the grigliata mista di mare (seafood mixed grill).  It was three separate offerings, an oak fire grilled red snapper with green olive tapenade, a crispy jumbo lump crabcake with gribiche aioli and a spice rubbed speckled trout with peperonata over creamy yellow polenta and garlic-chili rapini ($40).

They were so greasy, the entire paper they were served on was drenched. I tried a bite, and they were also slightly cold. My husband ate them all, but I think he was just hungry.\\nDinner- I had the tavern burger with fries. Again, greasy, greasy, greasy..my bun was almost too slippery to hold on to, and the fries were swimming. The burger tasted OK, but I asked for it not to be pink, so it was burnt around the edges. Asking for it non-pink just may have been my mistake. The fries were OK, but I couldn't even come close to finishing them because they were so greasy.\\n My husband had the Spicy chicken sandwich and caramelized Brussels sprouts. The only thing spicy about the chicken was the full red pepper stuck on top of it. It was cooked well, but had absolutely no flavor, and again the bun was super greasy.

He assured me I wouldn't be disappointed. John must've shared that I was from the west coast, because when they opened, the two cashiers asked if I was the girl all the way from LA. They were very welcoming and just as excited as I was for me to taste the chicken. I wanted to try a little bit of everything, so John came from the kitchen and let me customize my order. He was awesome! I ordered a boneless breast, two drumsticks (both hot), mac n cheese, slaw, banana pudding, and mixed the two teas. While I waited for my order, John brought me out some leftover off the menu spicy sauce they had from an event and told me it was the good stuff. Special treatment! I didn't have to wait more than a few minutes and my order was ready. I knew after the first bite, I wouldn't be taking any of it to go.

Full star for services!\\n\\nTaste:\\nHonestly, the ambiance is that of a strip mall Italian restaurant.

Maybe you are looking for a nice vegetarian meal or a completely stripped down vegan feast. Parma has you covered.

See yourself getting out of the car and then entering a quasi-classy Italian bistro. Like, an Italian Restuarant Strip Mall type bistro. Definitely not the one Billy Joel was singing about in the 70s, but classy none the less. Parma has done a nice job creating a warm feeling for their patrons. They have a nice fire pit in the middle, a good bar, and even a mozzarella bar. This place can be good for the commuter looking for a tasty meal on his or her way home from work, a date night, or a family night. Know they do seem to get extremely busy so they are not always a super quiet place if you are looking for that. You may want to call ahead for wait times if you have kids on the weekends.\\n\\nOverall Experience:\\nI am a big fan of Italian food and have always enjoyed my dining experiences at Parma.

I'm actually not much of a pecan pie person at all, I've always thought it was just ok, but I had to settle on Petsi's Butter Pecan Pie because by the time I arrived in the late afternoon, several of their other kinds/flavors of pies were gone. They make many different kinds of pies (also scones, muffins, cupcakes, cookies, many different sweet treats, coffee--hot and cold, etc.) and are open early, at 7 a.m. I believe, and once those pies are gone for the day, you're out of luck. They have 3 different sizes of pies (if I'm not mistaken), from a small 5\\" personal pie, a \\"medium\\" and a \\"full size\\" pie. Since this was my first time here, I decided to try out the 5\\" personal pie and a slice of the blueberry (my daughter wanted a peanut butter cookie, which she liked a lot). The blueberry was very good as far as blueberry pies go. Good ratio of blueberries, not overly sweet, nice flaky crust. Then I tried the Butter Pecan and was instantly blown away. I can't express enough how good this pie is. Hands down one of the best pies I've ever tasted. Again, let me reiterate, I (and my family) am not a pecan pie person at all. I love pumpkin pies and mixed berry pies, etc, but have never been a fan of pecan pie. Petsi Pies made me a fan of their pie. It is excellent and well-made, good consistency, flavorful, just the right amount of sweetness, perfect amount of pecans, very tasty, buttery and flaky crust, just overall an EXCELLENT pie. I let my kids try it, they too, were loving it as much as me. I went back in and bought two more personal pecan pies. Absolutely loved it. Then I went about my week in the Boston area and I couldn't get this pie out of my mind. I just had to come back before I left. So, on our last day in town, I took the \\"T\\" (Boston subway) back to Petsi Pies and tried their \\"Bourbon Chocolate Pecan.\\" This pie was a bit much for me, it was very rich and the chocolate overwhelmed the pecan pie flavor. I have to be honest and say that I didn't finish it. My kids also tried their \\"Mississippi Mud pie\\" and a brownie. Again, too rich for me/us, chocolate overwhelmed that pie as well. The brownie was good (I snuck a bite from my kid). We also didn't finish that little pie either. Perhaps others will like them (if you're a big chocolate lover), I (and my family) just found them a bit too rich and overwhelming. None of this is a knock on the pies, they all still tasted like quality-made, from scratch, good, flaky crusts and all. It's just a personal preference. We ended up getting a large Butter Pecan to take home and absolutely loved it. I can't recommend this place (and the Butter Pecan pie) enough, they make quality pies and have good, friendly service.

I read talk in the threads from SD transplants about how they cry themselves to sleep about not finding a SD burritorium here in Portlandtown. Hey, I can understand missing something you can't have no more. I wish I could get some Ivar's all up in this piece but the way is shut. I gots to travel to get that manna. Skipping ahead, I found myself in Milwaukie this night when large red lettering introduced itself to my retinas and unignorably said \\"RIGOBERTOS\\". A talk thread concerning this very entity sprang to mind. So I says to myself, I says \\"Self, go see what it's all about and stop mouthing the words that you're thinking right now. It looks bad.\\" My lips came to a screeching halt as did my car, forgoing my usual right hand turn for a hasty left and subsequent madcap right toward the parking lot. \\n\\nSo many choices on the menu. I was tempted to get tacos because that is my preferred Mexican food delivery vehicle but I thought to myself, I thought \\"Self, you gotta get the burrito to know what they talkin' bout. You want to KNOW, right?\\" So I greenlit a carne asada big burrito, as goes the vernacular. Remuneration was expected only in the form of $4.99. I obliged. I received a massive burrito casually, even glibly, handed to me. It felt cocksure, like they know this hombre in the drive-thru is about to get rocked like a burritocane. I admired this presumed swagger. I drove off, back to my domicile to give it a proper once over. It feels heavy and turgid. \\n\\nAs I drove, I posed a question to myself, I posed \\"Hey self, do you think this is filled primarily with meat? It's so massive and dense. They'd be losing money if they sold a mostly beef tortilla-wrapped parcel for what is legally allowed to be described as 'under 5 dollars', unless you had some kind of vibe you gave off at the drive-thru speaker that coaxed them into providing you with an abnormal size burrito unavailable to the general public and we both know you're just not that fly.\\" No, it's the same burrito everyone with $4.99 and an appetite for Rigoberto's burritos gets. Stupid brain, typically overthinking it. Take a cycle off, brain. ONE. \\n\\nLet's get down to brass tastebuds, shall we? It's just meat, guac and salsa, as described by others. Aside from being  a tad too salty for my tastes, it was pretty great. The quality is there. The meat was tender, succulent and omnipresent. I'm not a huge guac fan but it's growing on me and didn't put me off one bit. It was just the saltiness that impeded perfection. I'm sure others wouldn't shed a tear (provided they can spare the sodium) over it. Honestly, it's probably more of a 3 star in terms of flavor with the extra star being for how high quality the meat was. Also, I'd have to try their tacos before I can make any adjustments to my king-maker of a star rating. \\n\\nThis visit was about incorporating some SD into my being. I get it. I see how your world works now. We are all one. And that means I can use \\"our\\" car tonight kbye."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"CASH ONLY.

It screams fun and sweets. We decided to make it a go and eat here, despite the extremely long wait time for dinner. Overall, the ambiance is fantastic with a Steam Punk and industrial theme. However, the crowds are tremendous. The entrance to check in is mixed with the line on the left for milk shakes, and the people trying to get to the candy store on the right. It's overwhelmingly loud and chaotic. The menu is very elaborate beginning with a back story of Dr Toothsome, which is fun to look at. We decided to order a bunch of appetizers as our meal because many looked good. We had the Crab & Artichoke Dip, Pork Belly Sliders, Avocado Bruscetta and the Chocolate Stout Chicken Wings.  We also ordered the Warm Chocolate Almond Bread but our waiter forgot to give it to us. We would have forgotten too if we didn't double check the bill and see we got charged, so always check your bill. The dip was great, very cheesy and tasty. Avocado Bruscetta was good, you definitely must like avocados because they had large pieces. You could really taste the chocolate stout in the wings. It almost tasted like teriyaki sauce. But the winner for all of us was the Pork Belly Sliders. The bun is a pretzel and as weird as chocolate bacon sounds, it adds an interesting sweet and savory flavor to the slider. My husband also ordered the Grilled Teriyaki Salmon but they messed that up and brought him the Sole. However, they quickly corrected that so that was good. For dessert, we had the Waffle Bananas Foster, Strawberry Cheesecake Shake, and the Red Velvet cake. All very rich and thick and after a big meal, you almost just want to hold off and wait till you digest everything. But the shakes so beautiful to look at and tastes so good.

The restaurant building situated higher than the parking lots. There are 2 steps leading to the order area. The 2 steps are different in height , the top one is much higher than most of the normal steps anywhere. So I did miss the step and landed my knees and later the whole front of my body on the ground. There were 2 people that were eating at the table on the right came rushing to help me get up. The restaurant with the glass windows surrounding the working area. There were no way that the employees that were working inside would not see or heard what was going on outside. Non of them came and offered any help. So I went on to the ordering window and informed the guy ( I would like to call him a gentleman but he did not deserve it) what was happening, i was not angry , there were no sorry or even asking how I was doing. After i ordered the ice cream which was my lunch at 5 pm. Non of them asked about the incident or if I need any medical help . The good Samaritan was the one that got me the napkins to wipe my bloody knees. I did understand than I missed the unusually high step but for non of the people who worked there showed me the very unkind and cold hearted being is very sad and disgustingly disappointed.

Oh Lord do I love thee! Went here for a work dinner while visiting Austin and if I had known what wonderful dishes were coming my way, I would have starved myself the entire day so I could have eaten more. \\n\\nWe started with the fried green tomatoes topped with a light crab salad. I wasn't feelin' the mayo so I \\"donated\\" it my crab salad to my friend Olivia and munched on the delightfully crisp fried green tomato. I've never seen the movie, but if this is what its like, I'm going to Netflix it when I get home! Our other appetizer were a big plate of delicate pork ribs that were served with a spicy buffalo sauce. Not a fan of buffalo sauce so I passed, but my friends seemed to enjoy them.\\n\\nNext we had a wonderful chicken that I ate with the house BBQ sauce. Mmmmm mmmm good! The chicken was cooked perfectly (moist and crispy) and wasn't over salted. I gobbled down my entree with yummy sides of mac n' cheese, greens (which looked like kale, but I could be wrong) and asparagus. The mac n' cheese was so good that we had to order another side to share. What I enjoyed about the dish was that it was made with extra large pieces of elbow macaroni that capture all the cheesy goodness inside of them. It was also very nice how the cheese on top was cooked so there was a wonderful slightly browned crusty layer. I will dream about that mac n' cheese for at least the next two weeks. \\n\\nDessert certainly didn't disappoint as this may have been the best part of the meal! We had tiny deep fried half moon pastries that were filled with peaches and served with vanilla ice cream, as well as chili chocolate pudding pots. I still can't decide which dessert was better because I kept alternating my spoon between each one. They were both so amazing! Seriously perfect. If God made a man who was the fusion of both of these dishes, I'd stalk him and kidnap him.

They do offer you coffee (that you still have to purchase) while you wait though.\\n\\nMy favorite thing to get is the Northstar Burger. It's made with black beans, brown rice and beets. It comes with cheddar cheese, kale, tomato, and pickles with a side salad. Healthy and absolutely filling! I can never finish my burger in one sitting. We also tried their biscuits and gravy that's with their house made spicy gravy on top of buttermilk biscuits, but it's not too spicy. It's not heavy but definitely heavenly!! \\n\\nAlthough it can be a wait, it's definitely worth it and moves pretty quick. You can refill your coffee by yourself at their coffee station.

The jackfruit was slightly spicy with cashew sour cream and pineapple salsa to sooth the heat. The texture was similar to brisket. So my tastesbuds were expecting barbecue. But it was spectacular. The cauliflower we my favorite! The texture was just like ground beef. Last but not least, the mushroom taco. I thought it was black beans so I unintentionally suspended disbelief and it was delectable. I could have eaten 20 of them! SO flipping good! \\n\\nI also tried the Avocado Salad and that was my VERY VERY top pick! The lime and cilantro flavor was perfectly paired. And the chunks of tomato, onion, and avocado were game changes. They changed the flavor of the salad. I could live off this stuff! \\n\\nThe last dish I tried was the relleno filled with chorizo. It was spicy and crispy but I couldn't get enough. The cheese sauce was so robust. Full of flavor. Unlike any other vegan cheese I've tried. And the Pico de Gallo was ultimate heaven.

Our waitress was very friendly and even helps out in the kitchen, making the yummy concoction that we dipped our bread in. I dissected every ingredient so I could make it at home. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer. It was huge, but I'd rather have a smaller portion because we barely made a dent in it and it was on the pricey side. The calamari was also very chewy and not very crispy on the outside. I wasn't crazy about it. Other than that, the food was great. Portions were large, and my chicken parmigiana was very tasty. We kept wishing we were locals and had a kitchen to take our leftovers to. We ended up having to leave half of our meals because we were so full. \\n\\nMy friend didn't like how the bill was split. The waitress brought us a calculator and let us write the amount we wanted to put on each of our cards, rather than doing separate checks.

I'd heard they had great service and wonderful food - especially their pork chop. We were a few minutes late so we had to wait a bit, but it wasn't long and the ladies who were seating folks were all very friendly. We were told our waiter would be right with us. That was when things started to go wrong. It took our waiter quite a while to get to us so that we were really thirsty. Also, when I made the reservation, I'd checked the box that I had some dietary needs (can't eat sugar, and I was looking forward to getting a dessert after dinner).  I explained that to our waiter [we'll call him \\"Bob\\" - that's not really his name] and asked him to tell the chef and we ordered our drinks and an appetizer.\\n\\nIt took a long time before he came out with my daughter's Shirley Temple. He didn't have my drink, so he brought me water. He said that my drink was still being made. So I drank the water. Our appetizer arrived and it was pretty good. After another 10 minutes he brought my drink. I asked him about a couple things on the menu because my daughter has special needs and cannot eat everything. I thought the ravioli would be easy for her but it came with a pesto sauce, so rather than get her something that she wouldn't like the taste of, I asked him to bring us a sample of the sauce. He looked shocked and kind of rolled his eyes. I said I didn't want to order it if she didn't like the sauce. He seemed really irritated but said, \\"okay.\\" Several minutes later, he showed up with the pesto sauce. It was just too strong for my daughter. Bob said, \\"good thing you tried it!\\" Yep, that's what I thought.\\n\\nSo, my daughter got the meatloaf with mashed potatoes. She told him that she wanted the mashed potatoes to be really hot. He said, \\"of course.\\" I ordered the pork chop.\\n\\nNow, the restaurant was full, so I expected a wait. But people who came in after us got their dinners before we did. Bob was really busy and he was zooming around to his different tables, so it's not that he was just standing still. But I couldn't catch his eye. Finally, he stopped back by to see how we liked the bread. I asked for just plain butter because the house butter had honey in it - tasted great but not good for me. Again, he acted like he'd never heard of such a thing! And, again with the eye roll. He came back with 4 little packets of butter. \\n\\nOur meals arrived - they were delivered by other wait staff. My daughter's potatoes were barely lukewarm. My much anticipated pork chop was hockey puck tough. I took one bite and was chewing away and  my daughter asked me, \\"What's wrong, Mom?\\" So I tried another bite, thinking maybe, hopefully, the rest would be great. Uh, not happening. So I pushed my plate away and waited for Bob so I could tell him. He was missing in action. When he finally showed up, he said, \\"Is everything wonderful?\\" Sorry, Bob. I said my daughter needed fresh, hot potatoes and he could take my plate away. Again with the rolling eyes! I was really feeling like we were the only people who'd ever asked for any changes to the menu. Gosh. Our fun, special evening out sure wasn't fun. Or special.  Bob said, \\"So what do you want?\\" I said, \\"I'll probably need to look at the menu again.\\" -- Got the menu, decided I just get the French Onion soup. The soup and fresh potatoes arrived together. They were marvelous! Yay!\\n\\nAfter eating, I decided I'd like to have tea. Couldn't get Bob's attention, so I asked one of the hostesses to get him. - Bob showed up, said, \\"sure, no problem\\" and headed off to the kitchen. Unfortunately, I think someone had to go out and find a well somewhere - there wasn't one close by, apparently, because it took another 15 minutes to get the tea. By this time, I didn't want dessert [never saw the chef to talk about a sugar-free dessert anyway], we just wanted out of there. Next time I saw Bob, I told him I needed my check. \\"Sure.\\" Then he went MIA again. I drank the pot of tea. Still no Bob. He finally stopped by with plates on his arms from another table, \\"everything good?\\" \\"The bill?\\" \\"Oh! Yes! That's right.\\" Right. Time went by, no bill. No Bob. So I asked someone else to get me the manager. \\n\\nThe manager got to me before Bob and my bill. I gave Bob the Disney gift cards to pay for the  meal. He rushed off. I continued talking to the manager. A couple minutes later, he tapped her on the shoulder and said he was having trouble. She excused herself to help him. Bob went to his other tables. The manager came back and said that something was wrong with his computer (or whatever they use) and that there'd be no charge.  She was lovely and offered to get us desserts to take home but I just wanted to get out of there.\\n\\nFINAL TAKE: The Hotel is lovely, the Cafe is lovely, and I've heard that the food is good. Some of it is for sure. I think it just wasn't our night. But I'm not interested in trying it again anytime soon. Most of it is due to Bob."},{"name":"Ray's on the River","address":"6700 Powers Ferry Rd","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"4","text":"I loved this place..

You can tell the broth was slowly cooked for hours. They have their homemade chilli which packed a great punch! The meat was melt in the mouth! Absolutely the best in my opinion!

Yuck.  \\n\\nWell, when I heard my beloved Northstar was opening a location at Easton, I was furious.  I bitched and moaned to anyone who would listen.  And maybe I held a few people against their own will.  I boycotted this new location for months.  My Northstar had sold out, and I was pissed.  Well, I somehow got dragged one day for lunch, and now I've been 8 times.  I need help.\\n\\nReview:\\n\\nThis place is beautiful.  Like breathtakingly simple and beautiful.

The bartender, Gareth, asked me to cash-out early while I was still eating since the bartender shifts were changing.  I obliged, leaving a 22% tip.  As I reviewed the bill more closely a few minutes later, I noticed a $7.50 \\"service charge\\" on the bill and, at that time, thought it was some sort of Orlando / tourist-type tax, which is common in FL.  The more I thought about it, I decided to ask the manager, who said a 15% gratuity is automatically added to the bill, but the \\"employee policy\\" is to inform the customer of this automatic tip and the customer can adjust the tip accordingly.  Gareth did NOT notify me of the automatic 15% tip.  Since I was the ONLY customer at the bar at the time, I believe that Gareth knew exactly what he was doing and intentionally cheated me - getting away with a 37% tip.  The manager apologized and said he would speak with Gareth, but that does not leave me feeling less cheated.  I will not be going back to a restaurant where I can't trust the employees.  Hopefully, this review will put future customers on notice of the unethical practices of some of Se√±or Frog's employees."},{"name":"Uptown Pasta","address":"2108 Main St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Fantastic!

Both the kale and granny smith apple salad dressings are a bit too vinegary. The apple salad was actually almost soggy with dressing. The kale held up better and the dressing was more fitting. \\n\\nTheir wings and fries are great! The wings have enough meat and the condiments are perfect. I believe their sauces are house-made. The ranch was thick, creamy, and seasoned well. The buffalo sauce could use a little more heat, but was good. We ordered the superfreshiam sauce (a blend of all of their condiments) on the side and ended up asking for extra. It's a slightly buffalo-ish, creamy, vinegary sauce. The waiter described it as having honey mustard and BBQ, which I don't doubt, but those aren't the primary flavor profile. The sauce is a bit thin, so I'm not sure if it would stick well to the wings, but it should definitely be a side item.

Not sure why, but the quality/quantity of the food for the price point has been noticeable, which makes me sad because I have always enjoyed coming here for either dinner, appetizers, and drinks. As an example, the last time I was in after work, I was alone, sat at the bar, and ordered one roll, unagi, and a martini. The roll was a basic California roll, but that's what I was feeling, and when arrived within literally four minutes of me ordering it, I knew something was up. It clearly had been pre-made because it was super cold, solid, small, and frankly even the rice seemed old. The unagi came later, and while it was tasty, the pieces were very small. Next up, the martini. I've only ever had beer here before, but sitting at the bar and having had a rough work week, I decided to amp it up. The martini, which wasn't even a specialty one, just plain vodka, came in the smallest martini glass I have ever seen and I was charged $12 for it. This was the kicker for the evening.

I'd heard great things and it did not disappoint. I highly recommend making a reservation because we waited over 90 minutes to be seated but the food was worth it! The theme behind the restaurant is that Penelope left her family to tour the world, when she returned she found her family had left her. Her family left a note saying they were in search for her and they'd know to find her wherever the best chocolate in the world was. So Penelope built a chocolate factory to bring her family back home. The restaurant even has Penelope and her robot friend walk around and visit the patrons. Beware, Penelope seemed to have suffered some serious side eye on this occasion. She was also more interested in talking to servers than she was to her visitors. So don't rely on her coming to see you.\\n\\nWe started by ordering 3 milkshakes. Sometimes these can take a long time and rightfully so when you see them, so we ordered them ahead of time. Our server told us there was about a 30 minute wait for them but 2 of them came out in half the time. I got the ChocolateX5 and it was incredible!!!!!! Chocolate milkshake with chocolate whip cream, chocolate pieces and strawberries on top. These are massive milkshakes that come in to-go souvenir cups. I seriously wanted to finish it but couldn't! Sadly even though our waitress had recommended the third milkshake to my friend, she had forgot to put the order in and it didn't come out till our meal was almost over. If you're just interested in the milkshake, they have a quick service bar in front where you can order one without sitting down to eat. \\n\\nFor appetizers we ordered the chocolate almond bread with caramel butter (bonus! It's only $3), roasted Brussel sprouts and kettle chip nachos. Sadly our server told us they were out of the bread. Our Brussel sprouts with jalape√±o mayo were so good! I really enjoyed the shredded pork and cheese sauce layered on the chips. 3 out of 4 of us ordered the chicken bourguignon. The entree is enough for two meals! Two chicken breasts, super yummy gravy, mushrooms, mashed potatoes and asparagus. Yes the chicken was a little dry but I still thought it was delicious. The gravy is a great compliment. My other friend ordered breakfast for dinner, because that is an option here!!! Who doesn't love breakfast for dinner? Seriously the menu is intense because it has a little bit of everything. It was around the middle of the meal that we noticed another table getting chocolate bread. So we called the waitress over and she admitted they weren't out after all and some had just come out of the oven. This is a must get here! It's like a warm chocolate muffin with chocolate chips inside. It was delicious! \\n\\nThe food was incredible! I loved everything. The service could have been better. Our waitress seemed out of it. She even apologized and said she was still on vacation mode....despite that I can't wait to go back. Oh and our 3 milkshakes, 3 appetizers and 4 entrees only came to $110!

A young woman answered the phone politely and I explained the problem. She asked me to wait while se found someone who could help me. A guy came to the phone who said his name was Thomas.

I explained that we did not live near the restaurant and did not want to have to drive all the way back. We thought we would just put it in our oven because this was what we had planned on for dinner. He asked if we could bring the pie back tomorrow- Thomas is not a very good listener. My husband could tell I was frustrated and offered to speak with Thomas to try to come to a solution. Thomas claimed he was not only a manager but a partial owner. He explained that we needed to return the product to show him the problem in order for him to give us a partial refund.

Go have a coffee and a sweet before flying out at 8 PM, that's what. My fiance was flying as well (different destinations, but similar flight times), so we headed over to Cafe Intermezzo for a snack.

After taking it all in, we both ordered Cafe Intermezzo lattes (lattes with sliced almonds, cinnamon and cocoa powder) and a slice of the seven layer chocolate torte, at our waiter's suggestion (it was his favorite).\\n\\nAnd holy moly, what a combo! The cake turned out to be just a little too rich for us to finish, but it was still throughly enjoyable and the coffee was very good as well - almonds was an interesting addition to the latte.\\n\\nThe best part was our waiter was efficient in getting our order, getting it to the table and getting our bill taken care of as well. So even though we were a little pressed for time (I always like to get to my gate before boarding starts), we had a nice, leisurely little break in Cafe Intermezzo before the holiday craziness set in.\\n\\nP.S.

The location is really great to start. It's not in the heart of downtown but close enough to get to things by either walking or taking an uber. They have a great valet system which lets you park your car for the day ($30/day) with the option of leaving the garage as many times as you want...that means not having to pay each time you leave and enter. The lobby is beautiful and big so even when they are busy with check-in you don't feel cramped. They have the bar on the second floor which serves up really good and strong drink...also their wings are great. Some people complained about the elevators but I actually liked them. We never waited longer than 2 minutes and I like that with these elevators, it limits stops between where you are and where you are trying to go. My favorite feature of this hotel is that it is connected to the mall, which in turn means it's connected to almost everything you could need for the weekend. The mall connects to the grocery store and restaurants, the convention center and even a church! If you come to Boston in the frigid winter months you could do a lot of exploring by just using the mall as a cut through to avoid the cold winds outside. It's also a pick-up spot to a lot of guided tours throughout the city. The bathrooms were clean and the staff was very nice. Breakfast isn't included but there are a lot of great places nearby to check out. Highly recommend Eataly in the mall.

Most ramen shops serve beer only. \\n\\nWe had plans to snack throughout the day and go to a few breweries so we just ordered the appetizer fries and the spicy miso ramen. \\n\\nI was looking forward to the curry sauce on the fries, however, the sauce lacked flavor and the cheese curds did not fully melt (I guess much like a traditional poutine). I read reviews indicating the fries were over battered; however the battering was the only enjoyable aspect as it made the fries very crispy. \\n\\nAs for the ramen, for $15, the portions left something to be desired. The noodles were skinny (I prefer thick chewy noodles), the broth was not very spicy and for a miso base, I expected something with more mouth feel. I usually love drinking the broth but had no desire to for this dish. The pork was tender and it tasted like a fattier cut. Pieces were small.

The service was quick and efficient.  After a quick bite, we went over to the tasting room for the tasting.  2 of us had the bourbon flight while others had the gin and wine flight.  The flights are only $10 and you get a pretty generous pour.  I really like the ghost hill bourbon as it is so smooth!  After the tasting which we all enjoyed, we sat at the bar and started ordering some of the hand crafted cocktails.  The ghost hill old fashioned was AMAZING!  I think it's the bourbon that made it so smooth.  My friend who didn't like bourbon ordered one after tasting mine.  All of us ordered different cocktails and we all enjoyed it.  After so much drinking, we head back to the Alice restaurant for a proper meal.  They had replenished the sold out brisket by this time so that was great.  The brisket was great but the corn bread and mac & cheese was even better!!!  You can get great BBQ almost anywhere in Austin but it's the sides that makes the difference.

Me and my friends went there for my 21st birthday only because we got outve work late and it was the only place we could find that was open late enough. We only went there for the bar- the restaraunt was completely empty the bar had about 5 people in it (2 groups) and was dead quiet. Walking in was a little awkward and and the bartender (Cindy) was rude off the bat, she didn't smile and acted as though we were annoying for asking her, the bartender, to make drinks. One of my friends forgot her I.D (shes clearly 23) and so only ordered a coke. I had 2 drinks my guy friend had a shot and I went up to order him another one and she said no because I already had 2 drinks, I pointed to my friend and he said they were for him and she just argued with me until I walked away confused. Then Cindy comes up to our table and says if we order more drinks shes gonna need to hold on to one of our debit cards- even though up till then we had paid in cash. I was just like okay I guess it'll be easier to make a tab and I just gave it to her. A little later more friends came and one more didnt have an ID. It was about ten minutes till last call so a few of us went up to get our last drinks and left our old drinks at the table. Our other two friends stayed at the table because of course without IDs they couldnt order anything. In the middle of our order Cindy rushes from behind the bar, takes two half full drinks from our table and dumps them out without a word. We were all like wtf? Honestly she was just so rude the only reason we even went to a Chinese food place and not a bar was so my boyfriend could come in without an ID and sit with us. She was just being so rude even though she knew it was my birthday. It was annoying but I guess seeing that one person wasn't 21 she had the right to take our drinks. I ignored it because I wasn't going to make a scene and grabbed my last drink and was ready to go. Cindy then comes up to me to tell me my debit card was not working because their internet had shut off. I tried to use their atm and that wouldn't work either. The two other tables as well as some people from my table had all paid with cards and noone had any cash left on them. She told us to wait till she got her manager. We waited for the manager to come out forabout 25 minutes and when he finally did he said that we had to go home and that they were going TO KEEP OUR DEBIT CARDS TILL THE END OF THE WEEK! We were all like um no? One couple started flipping out and to what I'm sure was Cindy's surprise, my friends and I were calming them down. I had asked where the nearest ATM was so someone could go there and they wouldn't answer. Some people were saying they were going to call the police and the people who were yelling grabbed their cards and left without paying. After that the manager decided he was going to photocopy our IDs, take our card numbers and have us sign what we owed. Finally we got our cards back without an apology or anything. When someone asked if we could get something for the inconvenience they said we could come back friday and get a free drink, why they didn't just deduct a drink from each bill I don't know but I will NEVER go back there again, free drink or not I don't need the attitude."},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"I had to give one star to write a review... how does this place even stay in business?

I judge the dim sum here to be above average for Chinatown, but not the best. My favorites were the clams cooked with black bean sauce, Chinese meatballs, and noodles. I love seafood and the clams were nice and juicy and they give a decent sized portion. Everyone at the table loved the noodles so much that we got it twice. The classics like the Hao Gao and Shai Mai were also good. For dessert we got the Tofu Pudding in sweet water, which was the right texture, but not sweet enough for me. The only thing I wasn't really a fan of was the shrimp egg roll, it just didn't taste crispy or fresh.  \\n\\nThe Service - A+ on the service, it's really hard to find a Chinese restaurant with good service, but they pulled it off.  The servers were really on top of clearing dirty dishes from the table. My biggest pet peeve in dim sum restaurants is when the push carts take forever to get around, but they were all very fast and efficient and were able to explain the food items to my non-Chinese speaking friends.

I've mostly stopped getting wings or chicken fingers other places because it's like having orange pop when you're used to freshly squeezed juice made from Florida oranges shipped this morning.\\n\\nFor the meat options, I prefer wings or drumsticks, and as far as spiciness goes, warm is hotter than your standard medium (but not overwhelming) and hot is strong without giving me instant gastro-regret. The mac and cheese is usually great, the slaw is crunchy (Though really...I've never come across a slaw that I loved. Am I biased against slaw? Or is there some secret slaw recipe out there waiting to rock my world? These are the things I think about.) but unremarkable. Get the banana pudding as well! If it's not made with actual raw bananas, it sure tastes like it is. Often barbecue/wings joints make their pudding from powder or with some other shortcut, and it leaves the final product crazy sweet, neon yellow, and just kinda okay but nothing great.

The Empire Eggs were SO GOOD. It's their play on eggs benedict, but instead of your typical English muffin, the poached egg sat on a crispy, thick potato pancake. I love it when restaurants change it up, and use something other than an English muffin on their eggs benedict, like a biscuit or in Zaftig's case a potato latke. The latke was also topped with smoked salmon, and really well made Hollandaise sauce, with a side of fresh fruit and homefries. The whole dish was super tasty. My boyfriend really liked his specialty sandwich too, filled with corned beef, pastrami, beef tongue and mustard. He really liked that how he could taste the different flavors of each meat, and was surprised that he enjoyed the beef tongue, which was really tender. The french fries that came with his sandwich were also really, really good, super crispy and I probably ate more of them than he did haha :D. \\n\\nWe also ordered the Zaftig combo, which is a great starter to share and try a mix of their popular items! It came with a cheese blintz topped with fruit, potato pancake, meat knish and sweet noodle kugel. It was a really nice combination of some sweet and savory appetizers to try, and I think I liked the blintz and potato pancake the most (same one that came with my entree). \\n\\nPlus, our waitress was really friendly, nice and often checked on us to see how we were doing and if were enjoying our meal.

It seemed to be pretty popular given the weather and timing. We were hoping to take advantage of their happy hour, but after sitting down in the dining area, we were informed that the happy hour menu is only available to the bar area. Keep this in mind if this is your intent!\\n\\nWe ordered two of their cocktails: the Prickly Pear Mule, and the Ichigo Collins ($12 each). The Mule was definitely the better of the two (the Collins was pretty sweet), but I wasn't very impressed by either. I've had better versions of both of these for less money--these were lacking some of the flavor from the mezcal and tequila that I typically enjoy.\\n\\nWe were given two cute little cornbread muffins to start with a side of butter for free. The cornbread muffins were probably my favorite part of our meal. They came out warm :). I do think they could have warmed up the butter a bit since it was slightly hard to spread on the muffin.\\n\\nFor our meal, we got the brisket, the baked Mac and cheese, and the heirloom carrots and avocado salad. Of the three, I think we enjoyed the Mac and cheese the most, but it isn't my favorite that I've had in Austin. The brisket was solid but our favorite brisket in Austin is much cheaper than this (and we are given more there!). The carrot and avocado salad was okay, but the carrots were slightly underdone.\\n\\nOverall, if you are looking for an upscale bbq restaurant, this seems to be the place to go. However, I would definitely recommend other bbq places before this one. In my opinion, I think Lambert's is slightly overpriced for what they are churning out.

That doesn't make me a very great prince...\\" \\n\\nAnd he was overcome with sadness.\\n\\nIt's an old debate in Boston: which is better: Mike's or Modern? While Modern is much smaller and also lacks the extensive selection at Mike's, each pastry shop has its legion of supporters fervently swearing a blood oath of allegiance and rubbishing the other. For everyone going blue in the face chanting \\"Mike's a tourist trap\\", there is the red blooded rebuttal of \\"Modern isn't enough bang for the buck\\". It is truly a face-off of two heavy weight champions slugging it out for supremacy in the vibrant North End. Now, trust yelp to complicate the picture by bringing up a third option: Maria's.\\n\\nI was intrigued to see that Maria's rated higher on yelp than both Mike's and Modern. After walking for a long time through rocks and snow I finally came upon Maria's, only to open the door and see a picture of the founder of Modern Pastry hanging on the wall. Upon inquiry, I learned that Maria had purchased this shop from the Picariello family (that runs Modern) in 1982, and a taste of the cannolo suggested a very similar recipe.\\n\\nIs your message getting across?\\n\\nThe answer to that would be a resounding YES for Modern, as it is crowded most days of the week with a line snaking out the door (however compared to Mike's this is mainly due to poor set-up which makes things move slowly), while one can calmly walk into Maria's and be served immediately, and with greater enthusiasm and courtesy! \\n\\nModern (tied with Maria's) makes my second favorite cannoli. I prefer their version far more than Mike's (even if I love the Florentine cannoli at Mike's). As each cannolo is filled on the spot, the crust stays crisp, dry, and quite flaky. Their filling is fantastic - it is lighter than Mike's and not too sweet or as smooth, instead allowing the grainy texture and citrusy flavor of fresh ricotta to come across cleanly. Even though I stick to the classic version, I've also liked the chocolate cream cannoli with almond flakes. \\n\\nModern also makes a very good Cassata cake, Torrone, and Ricotta pies (even if Maria's makes an excellent version too), and it would be advisable to stick with Italian pastries and avoid the brownies, cupcakes, and cookies. Amusing to note that the category is described as \\"American Classics\\" on their website, when it would be more aptly titled as a component of that group, sold under the name of: \\"Flat Tires\\".\\n\\nThe table service at Mike's is a clear advantage over the indifferent, and at times rude service that you get from the staff at Modern. I was surprised to hear a server mutter under her breath, but audibly, to an elderly gentleman that she couldn't be bothered to clean the dirty tables as she was busy attending to customers waiting in line!!!\\n\\nUltimately, whether you gush enthusiastically about Modern, Mike's or Maria's - it is mainly because they have tamed you. An ordinary passerby would think that your rose looks just like the others, but it is the time you have devoted to your rose that makes it so important. After all, \\"What is essential is invisible to the eye\\"...

The food was good enough to go back, but we had a pretty lousy experience overall.  My brother and I used Yelp to locate a good place because we are both in from out of town, and were not really impressed.\\n\\nWhen we walked in we waited 10 minutes at the host stand with servers/staff walking right past us without saying anything and actively avoiding eye contact.  As former busboys/servers/bartenders/bar managers we assumed that they were swamped although it didn't look all that busy.  \\n\\nAt the 10 minute mark someone in the line behind us told us they had heard that they stopped serving the dining room after lunch (on a Saturday?!?!) but the bar stayed open.  Let's be clear, another customer told us this, and then we found a single seat at the bar to share (I was on a pretty tight time window).  We stood at the bar for 5 minutes before being greeted with \\"You can stand there, just not in the service well.\\"  Perplexed and confused (the dining room and restaurant seemed upscale but the lack of service/ decency was confusing) I asked if we could order drinks and food, to which we received, \\"sure, give me a minute.\\"\\n\\nNow, we had unlocked the mystery, and been given permission to stand, fantastic.  My brother ordered a drink, and I ordered a lunch option off of the lunch time bar menu.  The service was rushed on the verge of rude, and the drinks took a long time.  \\n\\nI was hungry, frustrated, and felt that we were being punished for something we didn't know we had done wrong.  That was all before I watched my food sit in the window for ten minutes.  I had nobody to tell.  I recognized my chicken, collard greens, and cross-cut fries.  I longed for them.  Yet, they didn't come. \\n\\nI finally grabbed someone walking purposefully with a unique uniform shirt (assuming a manager/assistant manager) and asked if I could have my food that I'd seen in the window for a while now.  I'm sure I was a little bit hasty, but was careful not to be rude.  To his credit, he had the fries remade, the collard greens re-plated, and asked for a more presentable piece of chicken.  He also graciously listened to my brother and I as we explained that the eye-contact-avoiding method of informing customers of the unusual dining approach was not very welcoming.\\n\\nThat said, the food was good.  Not great, but good.  The house bbq sauce is yummy, the fries were tasty, and the collard greens hit that soul-growl spot that makes you feel like youre home, even if they were never once served in your actual home.  That said, the re-freshed chicken had not had the opportunity to re-warm (after presumably being smoked then chilled) and was COLD on the inside. \\n\\nYes, we were visiting from out of town, but no, I won't be going back and don't recommend it either.  All things considered, we went to upscale barbecue to get good food with good service so we could enjoy our limited time together.  The end result was sharing a bar seat, grumbling about weird mid day schedule crap, and borderline terrible service, and almost as bad customer service when it was all said and done.

Located in Little Italy section of Boston, when you're walking down the street, it's a wide selection of stores that sell everything from gelato, to cannoli, to Italian food to baked goods.\\n\\nTIP: Modern Pastry is one side of the street while Mike's Pastry is located a few steps down on the opposite side of the street. \\n\\nWhen I walked into the store, the end of the line was already at the door frame. Glancing around the store while waiting in line, I can see the baked cakes, cookies, cupcakes, macarons, tarts and other items in the glass display cases to the left side of the restaurant where the line has formed. To the right side of the restaurant, the front half of the shop is for patrons to eat and drink and just enjoy themselves, while the counters are all the way at the end against the end wall. I spied a little \\"BAR\\" sign pointing downstairs to the downstairs of the shop which surprised me against the far right hand side wall towards the middle of the shop.\\n\\nAs you check out the goods, a lot of thoughts are going through your head to make a decision now what to get. Once you make your selection, they put everything in a box and wrap it up with a red and white colored string.\\n\\nEverything was awesome here and I have to agree that everything that we selected to try was on point and delicious. The cannoli here in comparison to Mike's Pastry is that there really isn't any (apple to apple comparison). Each is actually quite different in terms of flavor and texture which makes you appreciate each shop's version of the cannoli. The texture of Modern's filling is that is it more thin paste and creamy custard flavor (kind of reminds me of an Chinese egg tart custard almost) than compared to Mike's. Additionally, not just the texture, but also in terms of flavor, taste, and even the shapes of the cannoli (Mike's being more of a tube shell and Modern's being more of a trapezoid shaped shell). \\n\\n1) Fruit Tart: perfectly sweet consistency and good assortment of glazed fruits on top; mouth-watering good\\n2) Creme Br√ªl√©e: actually one of the better creme br√ªl√©es I've had where the custard is a nice smooth texture and it just makes you lick your mouth from the flavor. Deep dish custard where the thin layered burnt sugar on top is just right\\n3) Cannoli (Plain shell, vanilla filling topped with pistachios and almond on each side): the vanilla filing is semi sweet taste with a light thick creamy texture; paired well with the pistachio and almonds.\\n\\nOverall, everything was excellent and I would recommend everyone to have a try!"},{"name":"Douce Diner","address":"1490 Pemberton Avenue","city":"North Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"So I've been driving back and forth every week and now they're open.

Yes, it's got fewer drunk undergrads than other bars on campus, but that is more of a function of the price of beer at Mahoney's, and not the atmosphere there.  Apart from the coloured glass and ornate wood, there isn't a heck of a lot around to make the place seem warm.  Of course, there are plenty of TV screens to watch the game, so at least that is there for your attention.  However, the beer is somewhat expensive for students, and the location is far enough away from civilization to not deserve the trip from off-campus.\\n\\nAs for the food?  My dish this past weekend was a breaded chicken burger.  Sure, it was a full unprocessed chicken breast, but the way it was cooked resulted in one of the more disgusting chicken burgers I've had in a while.  The reason for this?  The batter was the exact same as would be used for fish n' chips.  Thus, the result of the burger was a mayo-covered fishy chicken mess, which was not a pleasure to finish.  The only saving grace in the food was that, like any decent pub, the fries were good.  A good backup plan!\\n\\nOverall the place was OK.  After a shift change in our servers, we didn't get served again until we practically grabbed the new one to get the bill.  But the lasting impression of the place should be in this:  If you want to get a side of yam fries instead of regular fries, it will cost you $2.50 more.

Barra, Joesph and many others working on Sunday the 29th of October truly made us feel like family.

The florentine ricotta cannoli uses the same cookie base as their florentine cookies which is lots of butter and sugar, easy on the flour. What you get is a toffee like cookie shell that holds a fluffy ricotta filling. MUCH MUCH better than the original cannoli. I don't see why people have not caught onto this and I hope that this review will lead them to it. But hey, it's Boston and that probably won't happen.\\n\\nAlso try the Crucanti.

There are desserts and ice cream options for the end, that's if you still have room for more!  I recommend the lobster bisque soup upon request, it is not offered as a self serve option, but an item you request from your waiter/waitress (included in the buffet price).  You are only allowed one lobster at a time, and if you only want a lobster, you do not have to wait and go through the long line again (that goes through the whole buffet), just walk over to the lobster section with a new plate and acquire your next delicious Crustacean of a meal!

There's a line here for good reason!\\n\\nMini donuts made in their own signature flavors and different types of Chai, they have Chai flights here. The mini donuts are made-to-order and since it was my first time here and in OR, this place came up as a must-visit. \\n\\nDecided on two of each flavor; \\n\\nDirty Wu - Cinnamon sugar, nutella and honey ... this donut is a mixture of the three they serve here. It's like a love child of sorts. This has a lot going on, but it's good.\\nNutella & Sea Salt - Can't go wrong with Nutella, lightly drizzled on top of the donuts and sea salt is used to accent the sweetness and provide some flavor contrast.\\nCandied Bacon Maple - Smokey bacon that's candied with maple, the saltiness of the bacon went well with the donut but with it was a touch more sweet! \\nRaw Honey & Sea Salt - Really subtle flavor of honey and the sea salt brings out more of the sweetness. More on the plain side, but for those looking for something not overly sweet and more natural.\\nCinnamon Sugar - Raw sugar is used here, so texturally the sugar is more apparent, good balance of cinnamon and sugar. Great classic.\\n(Seasonal) Lavender Berry - Hands down my favorite of the bunch, deliciously sweet, slightly tart and subtle floral lavender flavor. I could eat this jam concotion by the spoon. May I please put a request in to have this be jarred and sold?\\n\\nThe donuts are more like cake donuts, super easy and fun to eat because of their size. They were served up quick, piping hot out of the fryer, moist and not too greasy or dry.\\n\\nTo wash the donuts down I had an Iced Smokey Robinson Chai that had smoke, cinnamon, clove and vanilla infused into it. I thought it was a bit too smokey for my taste, as if I was having Chai while standing next to a campfire. So the smoke was overpowering the other flavors. I would probably opt for something without smoke next time.\\n\\nService is fast and the cashiers were informative and kind.

During the two visits, our group tried several of the burgers, all were great.  The burgers were good quality meat with thick bacon strips(those that had bacon).  They come with a good portion of fries.  My daughter tried the chicken bercey.  It comes with a few pieces of asparagus and mashed potatoes.  The asparagus was a bit peppery and she didn't like it.  However, She loved the rest of the meal so much the first night, she ordered it again the second.  The second night, they put more sauce on the dish and it was a bit overpowering for her so she didn't finish it, but ate most of it.  I had the flounder one night and I thought it tasted wonderful.  The dish was a bit peppery, so you must like pepper.  It also had quite a bit of oil so it was not as healthy as many fish dishes would be.  The fish was sitting on top of great tasting potatoes and served with a good portion of tasty green beans.  We also had the Brie appetizer.  The Brie was breaded with a croissant-like breading and warm.  The did not take off the crust of the Brie which is how I like it.  So this wasn't my favorite.  That appetizer also came with some of the chocolate bread.  All I can say is it tasted exactly as I expected it to (which wasn't bad, but also I didn't like it).  Friends of ours tried the flatbread pizza and liked that.  \\n\\nThere was a character with a thick English accent that made her rounds during dinner.  It added to the fun-spirit of the restaurant.

The brownie, the chocolate extreme (can't remember the exact name) and the red velvet.  They were all very good. You could tell they used high quality ice cream.  The extreme chocolate was all of our favorite.  The brownie on top of the brownie Sunday was a bit grainy so we didn't eat it.  The red velvet tasted a lot like cold stone's cheesecake ice cream with some mix-ins.  The shakes are very large and even my teenage son with the bottomless stomach couldn't finish one after a meal.  I'd suggest one shake for 3 people if you can share.

Cheese blintzes aren't usually my thing - I usually find them off-puttingly sweet (that might not be adverbable). But this might have been the best cheese blintz I've ever had - not too sweet, in fact a little tart? Pretty great. The noodle kugel is what I want in a noodle kugel (my family makes ours sweet and with golden raisins, so I loved the mixed dried fruit). The latke was good: thick, crispy on the outside, good flavor. The potato knish was the weakest of the four, in my opinion. Not because of the flavor. The flavor was good! It was too blonde - underbaked. The dough was white - it need more baking or frying - just more cooktime. Every table gets some bagel chips and cream cheese, which I will NEVER say no to (they were awesome). The service was good (if a little scattered; they were pretty busy at around 8:30 on a Thursday night). Overall, it was good. And I'd go back.

I am new to Portland (moved here 6 months ago) and I have worked in the restaraunt industry for 15 years, mostly fine dining.  While I love this city, the one thing it lacks is good customer service just about anywhere you go, especially restaraunts. I notice the small details that make great service and Howard and the rest of the staff here has it. Howard took the time to enthusiastically explain the menu, periodically checked on us, and cares about our experience. I watched Howard take the time with his other customers too to explain, talk to, or attend them. I also noticed the other staff serving food from the left, and clearing from the right, holding glasses correctly when pouring or pouring without even needing to touch the glasses, food was served hot, and everyone looks like they work as a team. Even if your food sucked (and it doesn't), I would come back just for the service.

We were really impressed. Service could be a little faster though.\\n\\nTorched Hop opened April 2016 in the old Old Spaghetti Factory (https://bit.ly/2ShWMqO) space on Ponce in Midtown. You can park for free in the Camden Midtown Atlanta apartment parking garage. The entrance is on Penn Ave NE. If you can't find parking in the garage, then you'll have to park on the street which is metered.\\n\\nThis is a great neighborhood brewpub that teeters on the 4/5 star line for me. In addition to brewing their own beer on-site, there's a restaurant with good food (definitely above-average food for a bar/pub), games - board games, video games (Nintendo 64 with four controllers and many games to choose from), bocce, shuffleboard, Jenga, and more, TVs, and three levels with different spaces to eat, drink, and hang out. It's similar to Ormsby's in Westside, but I think the food and atmosphere here are better. As far as atmosphere goes, it's relatively spacious and comfortable and the place has a more polished, refined, and stylish look to it when compared to most other bars and pubs in Atlanta. It's a sit-down place.\\n\\nThey have 20 rotating taps, about half of which consist of house drafts. For house beers, they also sell growlers and to-go cans, the latter at the host stand. Outside of that, they sell a wide variety of both local and non-local beer (bottled and canned), spirits, cocktails, shots, and wine. Full bar.\\n\\nFood-wise, the menu could be described as modern American pub grub. They have a nice assortment of shareable small plates ($4-16 each), from lemon pepper wet wings to Asian-style steamed buns (bao), salads ($6-14 each), burgers and sandwiches ($11-16.50 each), pizza ($14-15 each), entrees ($12-14 each) like fish & chips and bangers & mash, and desserts ($4-6 each) such as \\"unicorn puke\\" (cereal treat amalgam) and ice cream sandwiches.\\n\\nWeekly specials include:\\n* Burger Monday - burger, fries, and house draft for $10\\n* Taco Tuesday - $3 tacos (rotating selection)\\n* Wing Wednesday - 12 wings and house draft for $12\\n\\nWe stopped in for dinner on a Tuesday night and the place wasn't too busy, which was nice. The Taco Tuesday tacos were a mango-habanero marinated chicken taco with pico de gallo and cilantro slaw and a crispy avocado taco with gochujang (spicy Korean sauce) and kimchi slaw. Here's what I tried:\\n\\n* Sweet Mother of Cherry (6% ABV, 12 oz, $6) - fruited kettle sour\\n* Roasted bone marrow ($10) - chimichurri, sourdough\\n* Kale salad (large size, $9) - dried cranberry, candied ginger, pecans, avocado, citrus vinaigrette\\n* Roasted duck steamed bun ($4) - \\"dope\\" cucumbers, eel sauce, bonito mayo, togarashi\\n* BBQ pork bun ($4) - pickles, slaw, BBQ sauce\\n* Pretzel-bourbon bread pudding ($6) - hazelnut ice cream, chocolate chips, caramel sauce\\n\\nI'm not much of a drinker, but I did find the Sweet Mother of Cherry to be a delicious sour. The sourness really hit me at first, but overall, I thought it was an enjoyable and quality beer (coming from someone who doesn't really like beer).\\n\\nMost of the food was outstanding. The bone marrow and the kale salad were among the best bone marrow and kale salad I've had anywhere. As soon as the bone marrow hit the table, the smell of the garlic from the chimichurri made my mouth water. Their chimichurri was on point and the amount of bone marrow and crunchy sourdough toast was generous. This is a rich app/shareable with excellent flavor. Well done.\\n\\nThe kale salad was terrific with clean and fresh ingredients all around. The game changer was the candied ginger. I thought those were unique and they really enhanced the salad, pretty much taking it to another level. Another highlight was the citrus vinaigrette. It tasted wonderful, zesty, and it wasn't overpowering. A fantastic salad for sure.\\n\\nI was somewhat disappointed in the buns. The steamed buns themselves were harder and chewier than I would've liked. They weren't as soft nor as fresh as they could've been, but then again, I wonder how many of these things they sell on a Tuesday night. The roasted duck bun tasted kind of funky. Part of it had to do with the bonito mayo which I think is what gave the bun a distinctively fishy taste. I thought it was interesting how they used togarashi, a Japanese red chili pepper spice mix that I normally sprinkle on top of ramen, in the bun. Not sure if it made a noticeable difference.\\n\\nThe BBQ pork bun fared much better. It basically tasted like a pork BBQ sandwich, but in an Asian-style bun. Not bad.\\n\\nThe pretzel-bourbon bread pudding was phenomenal. A definite must-order. Everything about this dessert was great. The highlight for me was the bread pudding. The taste of pretzel was subtle. The consistency of the bread pudding is where the pretzel was more noticeable; not as soft and soggy, holds up better. The flavors - hazelnut ice cream, caramel sauce, bourbon - just melded perfectly together.\\n\\nThe staff was friendly and cool."},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I went back in 2016.

I'm severely intolerant to lactose (dairy/milk products) so some creativity and knowledge are needed. \\nThat said, this is 2019 and Portland's culinary landscape does suggest that Mother's kitchen should know how to address my condition without compromising the spirit of its dishes or the overall experience.

For both, the kitchen's idea of substitution was to bring the dishes out with a bowl of bbq sauce.  The same one for both. The sides were supposed to be potatoes/vegetables. Again butter was a main ingredient. The substitution was French fries and green beans. Very reasonable I thought, but they had to prove me wrong. Both were so salty, neither my wife nor I were able to eat any of them. Literally. Our lips were burning from trying. \\nTo say that this place is over-hyped would be an understatement.

So today was the day Greg M and I went.  At first I was a little concerned that there was an incredible line and it was probably 30 minute wait to get to order.  Someone handed us a menu and said we were not in danger of not having chicken.  We were about 80 people in line and they had about 250 pieces of chicken.  Don't think I wasn't contemplating having Greg stand in line and I was going to the front and remind people of their new year's resolutions that they didn't really need more then 3 pieces of chicken so there would be enough But I decided to let fate take it's course LOL.  \\n\\nSo the first thing I was impressed with was the atmosphere.  They were hopping and staff and customers alike all seemed very happy.  Everyone talked to each other and the wait time passed quickly.  The folks in line behind us also liked my idea of policing the chicken orders!!  \\n\\nSo we ordered and found a place in the picnic tables and made some new friends in the process (great idea on the tables)   I am a total wimp and ordered mine cold and Greg M ordered the mild.  We're both not spicy people haha.  So he thought the mild was going to melt his face off. \\"I can't feel my lips\\" was his response.  My cold was nicely flavored.  Next time I will opt for the bone in as I think they have more inherent flavor.  Not their fault I chose boneless.  I did the Ma's Mac n Cheese and Ma's coleslaw.  WOW WOW did I say WOW?  The mac n cheese was to die for!! It was obvious that it's homemade I actually got a piece that had the crust on the bottom where it caramelizes (ya'll know what I'm talking about)  delish!!!  The pickles were top drawer as well.  I will ask for extra pickles next time LOL.    \\n\\nOK so now for the piece de resistance or the tour de force if you prefer the coleslaw!! Oh M to the holy G!!!  Anyone who knows me knows that I am beyond picky about coleslaw!!! I do try it at most places where it isn't from a can or cardboard carton.  I've tasted coleslaw from every mom and pop restaurant I've ever been to and most are not eaten I just can't abide the flavor.  I had an open mind and positive thoughts for HTO slaw!!  It was beyond amazing!  It was the perfect shred on the cabbage and the vinegar based sauce was not creamy!!!  OMG so tasty perfectly balanced flavor.  I can't remember the last time I had coleslaw this good.  The real quandry is do I order double slaw the next time and slight my carboliious mac n cheese?

The interior of the restaurant is beautiful and perfect for an intimate meal or fancy meal with your family. Our server was very nice and even brought me another drink when she noticed that I wasn't loving what I originally ordered (the Montreal 75). She brought me a Magical Star cocktail complete with a multicolored glowing ice cube. It felt like I was a having a rave drink for lunch and it was amazing. \\n\\nNow to the food. Omg. Get the filet Mignon with mushroom risotto!!! It is so good! The steak is melt in your mouth tender and pairs perfectly with the risotto. I also enjoyed the Canadian cheese soup with their complimentary bread basket. The pretzel bread was my favorite! My boyfriend ordered the NY strip steak with the Larder appetizer and also enjoyed  his meal as well. The larder appetizer is very meaty and could be a meal by itself. For dessert I ordered the Maple Yukon bar, which was fine but my boyfriend's warm pecan-brown butter tart was awesome! \\n\\nGiven that this is a signature restaurant this was far from an economically friendly meal. This lunch was worth 2 credits on the Disney dining plan and would have been over $200 out of pocket. The entrees are Disney size and shareable so you could save money by sharing.

The inside of the cafe is nice decorated and the service overall was good. The food for the most part was tasteful, we started with the daily soup special, which was some type of cheese soup and it was definitely good, probably my favorite part of the meal. We also ordered the Artisanal Cheese Offering to accompany our wine. This was a bit disappointing, although others may think its good. I'm a bit of cheese snob and have had a lot of great cheese and this just didn't live up to my expectations. We left most of the cheese on the tray.  My entree was the Artisan-made Spinach-Ricotta Ravioli\\nTuscan Kale, Seared Alba Mushrooms, Shaved Parmesan Cheese, Herb Pesto-Yogurt Sauce and Warmed Tomato Vinaigrette. Overall I thought my entree was pretty good, my only suggestion for this dish is that it lacked sauce/flavor. I know it came with a vinaigrette but it left the raviolis to be a tad but dry. The filling of the raviolis was pretty good though."},{"name":"Pip's Original Doughnuts & Chai","address":"4759 NE Fremont St, Ste C","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"You can't beat fresh donuts.

It was good - not the best I've had, but also not the worst. Although they sell copper mugs in the gift shop, this is served in the same plastic cups as the other drinks. We then did a group tasting - I much prefer to have spirits mixed than as a sipper/shot, so it was just OK (but clearly the product is great as their cocktails are great). I then got a green cucumber drink (can't recall the name) and it literally looked and smelled like something one would get a JuiceLand. It was delicious.

I always make a mess as it is a bit of a windy location, I spill, eat heartily and having a beard makes it even more fun. This is located in the parking lot of a convenience store and a car wash. Make sure you do not block the entrance to the car wash so others can use it. If you want bones in your menudo, ask for them and also ask for spicy everything! :-)    .

If you are looking for non Disney gifts you can shop for shop bath products at Basin, jewelry at Alex and Ani, bags at Coach, and clothes at American Threads to name just a few. Even though these are not primarily Disney Stores they still have offer a few Disney items. \\n\\nA one of a kind experiences you can have at Disney Springs is the virtual reality experience at The Void: Secrets of the Empire. You pretend to be an undercover rebel Storm Trooper who tries to get a valuable artifact to the resistance. It takes VR to the next level. Other unique experiences are riding in a hot hair balloon or riding in a vintage Italian taxi or Amphicar.\\n\\nI love walking around Disney Springs. While I did spend money at The Void and a few shops and food stops I didn't spend an exorbitant amount. A lot of the things we did didn't cost anything at all like window shopping, posing for pictures, looking for hidden Mickey's and people watching. It's a great way to get the a little of the Disney experience without actually going to the parks."},{"name":"Karma - Concord","address":"105 Thoreau St","city":"Concord","stars":"4","text":"Really good sushi.

With so many good coffee spots nearby, Timbertrain made the decision very hard and in the end, the atmosphere and great taste made me skip other spots.  \\n\\nTimbertrain is in the heart of Gastown and sits in a really nice heritage spot.  The place itself is quite minimalist with only a graphic engine on the large window catching your eye.  They had a great playlist with Jimmy Hendrix being the front and centre... not too chill for a morning but then again, it helps to get your ears and brain working in the AM.  There's a lot of tables to sit when I was there but it was a 8 am weekday.  I think it gets busier.  The place is comfortable as it has a lot of warm woods and comfy seating.  The pour over bar is really great as it looks like almost a science lab with it's clear glass and brass accents.  I really like this spot.\\n\\nIced Cappuccino - Timbertrain broke the spell.  After drinking probably 4 really disappointing coffees in Vancouver, this one was the one that made me go 'waaaaiiiit... Vancouver can actually pull a great espresso shot and this tastes so good!'.  Turns out they can also do it consistently!  This one was full one flavour and not diluted with the ice or almond milk in it.  You have that rich creamy taste just helping you cool off from the insane heat.  4.5/5\\n\\nFlat White - Ohhh yes... thank god for this.  Woke up early one morning and needed a good cup of coffee.  Timbertrain was it.  This was incredible... great balance with the milk, microfoam just right, and that rich flavour hitting me.  The notes of brown sugar and candied orange came through... their tasting notes were not just an fanciful thinking.  It was real.  4.5/5\\n\\nVancouver downtown coffee scene has a lot of options but my absolute favourite has to be the consistent good flavour of Timbertrain."},{"name":"Disney Springs","address":"1486 Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"One of the best free places to go.

The food here is good, but not great. If you're craving pho, it'll fill that void, but it won't blow your mind. With the cold front, it seemed like the perfect weather for pho so we decided to try this place for the first time. \\n\\nWe were immediately greeted by a friendly waitress who was knowledgeable when asked questions on ingredients in certain dishes. The service was fast, as we ordered food to go and waited at the counter for no more than 10 minutes. She asked if she could get us water or anything to drink as we waited, which was a nice gesture but we declined. \\n\\nI ordered a large pho without meat and my husband ordered bun (vermicelli) with pork and spring rolls. The pho was good and flavorful, but the amount of noodles was disappointingly skimpy. Other places usually include about twice the amount of noodles, which would have been a more appropriate portion based on the amount of broth that comes with the large size. I was still hungry after finishing everything, which is usually not the case at other places. I don't even eat that much! Maybe they have better portions for those eating in? The other thing that they could do better is to include whole jalape√±o slices. They include about 5 small pieces of cut up jalape√±o, which is pointless because they leave out all the seeds...how does one customize their spice level without the most important part of the jalape√±o? As for the bun, the sauce was just mediocre and the meat was cold...not even lukewarm like it was once hot that then cooled down on the drive home. I did like the spring rolls that came with the dish since they were flavorful and crispy. But that experience was partly ruined by the fact that I witnessed the cook pick those up with his BARE HANDS and place them on various dishes, among other items for other dishes. I'm sure there are way worse things that occur at restaurants behind closed doors, but with the kitchen in plain view of customers...at least use gloves?!? \\n\\nWith all that in mind, I don't think we'll be back.

Upon my arrival in Austin, I went straight to this hotel, only to be told that although I had booked and paid for my $300/night room a month ago, they were out of hotel rooms, and were giving me a \\"living room\\" that didn't have a bed, just a pull out couch. I was perplexed. I mean, is not the SOLE purpose of a hotel to provide beds to people who are traveling? \\n\\nEven more annoying, the couple who checked in after me actually got a real room. Why did they bump me? Because they knew they already had my money? It was shady. \\n\\nIf anyone has read my other reviews, they will know that my biggest pet peeve is being lied to. The manager of the hotel had told me that the pull out bed was memory foam, so it wouldn't be too uncomfortable. When I sat down on the pull out bed, it was clear that wasn't true. I could feel every spring, and no foam. The bed was so uncomfortable that I woke up with horrible hip and neck pain. Since all of the sheets had fallen off over the course of the night, in the morning, I was able to actually see that the mattress was not a memory foam mattress. \\n\\nPlus, I had a hard time staying asleep because my room was close to the elevator, and I heard every ding.\\n\\nThe front desk woman who had to share with me the bad news was polite but just kept repeating \\"This isn't my fault.\\" Making me feel guilty. I have to say, I wanted to yell and scream, but didn't and kept a very level head (I thought). Her tone made me feel like somehow I was in the wrong, when, I had booked my room long ago, and in fact, already paid for it, and in fact, for some crazy reason expected a bed. \\n\\nI'm sure that for people who actually get beds not near elevators, this is a lovely 4 star hotel, with gorgeous views of the river and downtown Austin.

We ordered the following:\\n\\nPho Boi - Just your standard pho with beef shank but everything in the bowl was perfect. Broth was rich but not overly so, noodles were fantastic and I'm sure they are made in house and the beef was perfectly marinated and cooked. This was the best dish by far. \\n\\nSpicy Bread Sticks - These tiny baguettes with pate were what caught our eye on Instagram. Unfortunately, they didn't live up to the hype. The bread was good but the pate itself was meh and there was nothing to balance out the strong flavor of the pate. Wouldn't get this again. \\n\\nSpring Rolls - Very competently done but nothing special. Just average. \\n\\nService was fast but all the servers seemed to be very abrupt and somewhat rude. Prices are quite high too, the pho was $14 and the spring rolls were $8 for two rolls. Parking is on street and free. \\n\\n\\nTl;dr Pho was great but prices are high and service lackluster. Better options available in the area unless you're really craving pho."},{"name":"Superica","address":"99 Krog St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"If you take away one thing from this review, it's this: there are way better places inside Krog Street Market, and if you're craving Mexican food, there are way better places around town.\\n\\nNow with that being said, Superica isn't bad. I just always end up only coming here because others want to, not because I'm a fan. Let me put it this way: I don't mind eating here, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go.\\n\\nFood: The main thing about their food is the portions are pretty big, especially for their fajita plate, so you WILL get full, which is nice. Last time I came here I wasn't too hungry so I had the sopa de tortilla (chicken tortilla soup) and it was good, but could've used more seasoning. Their salsas and chips are pretty solid. Don't expect anything authentic, it's just tex-mex.\\n\\nDrink: We ordered a bottle of wine that was reasonable for a restaurant and was actually pretty good. Don't know much about other stuff like the stereotypical margaritas or anything though.\\n\\nAmbience: It's a pretty decent vibe, cool patio area to people watch, although there's not much else to see as far as views go since it is Krog street, but a good patio area for summer. I would say you can have a decently dressed up date here or just come in jeans and t-shirt and you'd fit in regardless.\\n\\nPrice: Definitely overpriced for me. The food is solid but the prices they charge are too much for the quality compared to what you could get inside or closeby.\\n\\nService: We had about 7 people at our table last time I went and our server was awesome. She handled everyone's order and didn't put a foot wrong. Can't speak on wait times as when we got there a few friends had already grabbed a table.\\n\\nAll in all, this is a solid but overpriced place. Bang average in my book. Can't speak on the drinks.\\nAgain, I don't mind coming here, but I have yet to find anything on the menu or about the spot that would make me go out of my way to go."},{"name":"Disney Springs","address":"1486 Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Awesome place to check out while at Disney.

It's solid, but don't expect inventive techniques or dishes with the price you pay. It's basically overpriced brunch/breakfast, but you get consistency for that price. \\n\\nThe New York Style Bagel with Cream Cheese... I opted for everything with the bagel such as the smoked salmon etc. It reminded me of the deconstructed Nova Lox from Einstein's Bagel, but this one was tastier of course, but it still reminded me of an expensive Nova Lox. So yes, for 19 dollars, that's what you are going to get. \\n\\nThe Eggs Benedict was good. The egg was cooked perfectly, and the Canadian bacon on it was right on the money. Oh yeah, since we are talking about money, it's 24 dollars for an eggs benedict, which you can get for half the price at egg harbor or some place. The dish is great, and I can't say enough good stuff about it, but it's an eggs benedict. The ingredients alone shouldn't cost 24 dollars, and I hate it when hotel restaurants or restaurants in general do this (charging arm and leg for something simple and done everywhere). \\n\\nSo moving into high tea. I know this is Atlanta, and it is not London. However, I felt for the price I am paying, it should be better. When I was getting high tea in London, I felt overwhelmed with the tea selections. So many blends, original flavors, different origination, etc. The choices were amazing. My tea selections at Astor Court fit in a box of jars. My choices were underwhelming and rudimentary. Also, the selections, I felt focused more on the sweet side, and it might be because it's trying to cater to people in Atlanta. Who knows, but I just felt it lacked other essential varieties. \\n\\nThe treats with the tea were good, but they did not blow me out of the world. I felt it was about above average, but then again, I might have been in that mood where I was disappointed with the tea selection that the treats became victims to my mood. They are not bad at all, and very good. Fluffy finger sandwiches, brittle to moist sweets, to savory bites, they were all good. It could be that these were the saving grace from the tea. \\n\\nOverall, I want to try other high tea places in Atlanta and see if I can find something better. Comparing my experiences in London with high tea and brunch everywhere else in the world, I was not blown away. However, I found Astor Court to be a good standard to start from in Atlanta."},{"name":"Cruzteca Mexican Kitchen","address":"5207 Brodie Ln, Ste 125","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I've been here probably a dozen times (sorry for taking so long to write a review)..

(This place is probably bumpin late night as well but I doubt I'll ever find out.) Had to be reminded this essentially is a hotel bar - that said, 4 stars. \\n\\nThe deets: Came here on a Saturday around 6 (cuz we are old) and there were plenty of places to park. We chose the back wall (under the actual roof, by bar) since it felt like they might be running A/C (can't imagine that utility bill but it felt much cooler) and it was pleasant. Once the sun crested we moved out to the \\"grass\\" (spoiler alert: it's fake) and lounged on the couches. It looks just like the pictures: bright and fun, but larger, and more segmented areas than I thought - a good idea with such a large footprint. I'd give the decor a 5 star. Once you take everything in (and take pictures if you are into that; my husband remarked, \\"this place is very Instagram-able\\"), it's a nice spot to sit back and relax with your party and/or people watch. Lots of younger (20s I'd guess people here) but also a few randoms given that it's attached to the hotel. Oh, and a couple of dogs. We became pretty engrossed in the epic Jenga game with the tower that was literally taller then a the people playing. They also have cornhole, shuffleboard, foosball, chess.\\n\\nWe used our Yelp app to score a free street taco and both the pork and brisket were just what the doctor ordered. (We had resos downstairs and didn't want to spoil our dinner.) I tried both frozens. The prickly pear was sweeter than I would have liked, but ok; an intense flavor, but almost like a mix. The watermelon one everyone had (with the Everclear floater: Bad Life Choices) was also sweet; it tasted just like a jolly rancher. For a drink that states you can only have two, I was disappointed, in fact, neither drink seemed that strong (for $11, I have certain expectations, just sayin). The paloma type drink (Shots Fired) however, was excellent. My husband drank a number of the white sangrias and they were unusual and tasty. I might come back, but would pick Happy Hour for sure. \\n\\nGiven that we rarely go out, this place was a treat, although primarily for the eye, then the palette."},{"name":"Le Cellier Steakhouse","address":"1510 N Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"My family and I dined here for lunch yesterday and we really enjoyed it.  I have been to Le Cellier a few times, but it has been a few years as it is not the easiest location to get a reservation.  The restaurant is small and has a great reputation as one of the best places to eat at Epcot.  My husband and son ate here a few months ago and my husband kept on about how amazing it was, so I decided I needed to go back.  \\nFirstly, advanced dining reservations are HIGHLY recommended.  This restaurant is small and popular.\\nWe went for lunch and were promptly seated at our reservation time.  Most of the tables are 4 tops so if you are a large party it may be more difficult to get a reservation.  Our server was super friendly and attentive.\\nFor lunch they had a $55 pre fixe menu that included the cheddar cheese soup, choice of sandwiches and choice of dessert.  I seriously thought about getting this, but Le Cellier is famous for their steaks and that is what I wanted.  \\nBread service is complimentary and includes and incredible pretzel bread that far surpasses the pretzel bread in the Germany pavilion IMHO.  It is served with a maple butter that was also incredible.  My husband ordered the cheddar cheese soup which is a staple at this establishment.  It is so popular that you can find it at the Canada Food and Wine booth every fall.  The pretzel bread is especially good dipped in this soup.  My husband made the mistake of letting my son have a bit of the soup.  My son loved it so much that his daddy did not get it back.  My son ate the whole thing!  He loved it!\\nI ordered the 8oz filet.  It was cooked perfectly, but could have used just a tad more seasoning.  My husband had the ribeye which he enjoyed as well, but he didn't care for the butter it was served with.  He said it was sweet and didn't go with the steak.  My husband isn't into sweets at all so he should have asked for the maple butter on the side.  \\nFor sides we had mashed potatoes with truffle cream which were very good.  I only got about 2 bites because my son devoured those too.  We had fries which were nothing special.  Finally, we had the four cheese mac n cheese which was incredible.  It was so delicious.  I will order this every time I come here.  It had a soft cheese on top and just a dash of bread crumbs.  The funny thing is I ordered it for my son, but he gorged himself on the soup and mashed potatoes so more for me!\\nFinally, for dessert we had the strawberry trifle.  It had panna cotta, strawberries and ice cream.  I really enjoyed it.  It was light and refreshing.

I did not get to try the dine-in experience, as we ordered our pizzas to go, so this review is purely based upon the food quality. \\n\\nAt the moment, I'm rating this as the best pizza that I've ever had in the city of Orlando, bar none. It is absolutely exquisite, decadent pizza. What makes this pizza so phenomenal is the freshness of it. From the toppings all the way down to the dough, they seem to use only the freshest of ingredients because it tasted that way. It tasted homemade through and through, almost as if they made all of their pizzas from scratch.\\n\\nTheir clam pie pizza is one of my favorites. It's topped with clams, cheese and sauce. They also leave a lemon wedge on there in case you want to add a different flavor to the pizza.

We were intrigued by the thought of all you can eat crabs & lobster, however the food was disgusting! By the looks of the menu, one would think there was a spread of any type of seafood you could thing of. Don't be misled. The food was dry & bland, no seasoning whatsoever. Once the crabs were cracked open, I found little meat inside if any at all! The salmon was dry & over saturated with butter. I had planned to just order a meal off of the menu instead of eating from the bar; they only have about 2 items that you can order from the menu, shrimp Alfredo or 8 fried shrimp. Both meals were $30 each. For that price, you might as well order the buffet for $50. The chicken strips from the buffet tasted like they were fried in fish grease, so who knows how often they change the grease. They do have about 6 different flavors of ice cream, however the station was not monitored very well. There were underaged children, with no adult supervision, playing in the ice cream. They were mixing the different flavors together. So sad to say, I couldn't even enjoy the dessert. The best part of the whole meal was the mango sangria. Overall, our experience was terrible. After spending $70 for one buffet & one sangria, I went to Culver's for a decent burger. I've never known anyone to leave a buffet still hungry.

Like a commercial says, \\"Hey, they don't give us 2 stars for nothing!\\" \\n\\nI live only 3 miles away and WOULD NOT recommend this place to anyone living in town or visiting Austin.\\n\\nThe OASIS is a collective of restaurants, bars, Ice cream shops, and specialty gift shops.\\n\\nTHIS REVIEW PERTAINS TO THE MAIN RESTAURANT CALLED \\"The Restaurant at The Oasis\\".\\n\\nMy son and I arrived at 8:45 pm on a Tuesday evening for a summer dinner of just appetizers -- this was July, 2019. -- just recently. We hadn't been to the OASIS for nearly four years because of our last experience. We thought we'd give it a second chance and see if it had improved since our last visit in 2015.\\n\\nIT HASN'T....\\n\\nWe were told we would be seated in about 20 minutes because the kitchen would close right after 9:00 pm. The host said generally speaking the wait for a table is 40 minutes, but because we arrived just before 9:00 pm we'd be seated faster. She took my phone number and said we'd get a text when the table was ready.\\n\\nThe restaurant was moderately busy with many groups and couples already leaving when we arrived.\\n\\nIt was the only restaurant at the OASIS that was open despite all of the signs in the windows of the shops, bars, and other restaurants saying they were all open until 11:00 pm weekdays in the summer.\\n\\nTo our surprise the entire complex was dark and closed - abandoned really -- even when it said they were open. \\n\\nThis was just a regular week night too.\\n\\nWe sat inside the restaurant and waited for a text but it never came. \\n\\nAfter 50 minutes of waiting and noticing the entire restaurant was clearing out we asked why we hadn't been seated.\\n\\nThree of the young 20 somethings at the front desk were just chatting and getting ready to close down. Their response was \\"you didn't get a text?\\" And I replied no. They then said, \\"it's not our fault\\". The kitchen was now obviously closed.\\n\\nWe left immediately and went to another restaurant on 620 that was willing to seat us.\\n\\nAround Austin the OASIS is well know for sloppy service and generally poor tasting meals. If you want to buy just their alcohol and take in the view then fine, but drinks there are expensive too.\\n\\nI would not recommend this location or the restaurants here to anyone. The view of Lake Austin is great, but everyone in Austin knows this place is terrible. They don't care.

While we were there waiting for our desserts, we were observing the food they had available on the line and browsed their menu.\\n\\nAfter enjoying the delicious desserts, we decided to go back the next day for lunch. Mmm mmm good. I had a veggie plate consisting of macaroni & cheese, greens, green beans, and yams with a corn muffin. This is the 'bite your hand off if you put it over this way' type food. Seasoning was great and the quantity was great. I only finished half of my plate and had the rest for dinner. One coworker had fried whiting and another had fried chicken.

Upon arrival be certain to check out the \\"Gift Shop: Tasting Room.\\" Inside you will find lots of neat trinkets and novelties available for purchase. More importantly, walk up to the bar counter area and get some small tastings of their variety of spirits: Bourbon, Vodka, Rum, Gin...some very interesting barreling techniques that provide complex and amazing flavors. You get 3 small tasting choices out of 7 for a mere $10. My husband and I decided to share and we quickly decided what our favorite was. You can buy a bottle and consume on premise if you desire.

Next, KFC isn't meant to be a snack. Don't go looking for a 2-piece and a biscuit. Instead, you get a half or whole chicken plus some big @$$ tater wedges.

Thankfully we had a reservation well in advance, as even on a Sunday night it was packed.\\n\\nWe were both pretty hungry, so we decided to split several dishes:\\n\\nBLT lettuce wraps (4.5 stars): This was our first and one of our favorites of the night. This dish was pretty large and had several ingredients to add together, but the best one being the lamb bacon--man was that tasty!\\n\\nBlack pepper popovers (3 stars): Not the most exciting dish and the popovers were pretty cold--I was hoping they would be warm. I think this dish had a lot of potential, but just fell flat for me on flavor.\\n\\nCharred avocado (2.5 stars): This dish was just odd as the ingredients almost gave it a bread-like flavor--and not in a good way. Maybe the avocado was not really ripe? That's my best guess.\\n\\nSilver queen corn (3.5 stars): I had high hopes for this dish, but have to say that I was a little bit underwhelmed. While their was a mix of flavors and the texture was good, I felt that the general flavor was pretty bland.\\n\\nSwordfish (4 stars): This dish was very good and cooked perfectly, though I felt that the mint really overpowered the flavor of the fish. I would have loved to have seen the fish paired with the harissa and then maybe a side salad with the almonds and mint to accompany.\\n\\nBurger (5 stars): This dish has gotten a lot of hype and rightly so. It's not the cheapest burger in Boston/Cambridge, but it may be the best I've had so far. It is not huge in size, but it definitely packs a punch in the flavor department--definitely a must order.\\n\\nChocolate chip cookie dough (4.5 stars): So simple, yet so perfect.

There are several other options for dessert, but do yourself a favor and choose this one.\\n\\nWe also shared a couple of drinks with my favorite being the ode to pablo--though the donkey punch is pretty cool, served inside a grapefruit.\\n\\nOverall, this place is a great addition to the Cambridge food scene.
