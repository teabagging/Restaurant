Nothing to boast about which is very disappointing seeing as this restaurant has placques on the wall claiming to be one of the \\"best restaurants\\"...yada, yada, yada. The fact that it is in strip mall doesn't bother me too much. What I didn't find appealing was the smell of cleaning products as you walk into the restarurant. The good thing we were seated pretty quickly so the smell didn't last too long. My main concern about this experience was the customer service and restaurant policies. I had a question about the 5-course special and right off the top, the server told me that it would be 3 hours from start to finish because they were busy and that the entire table had to participate otherwise it wasn't option. Alrighty then. Next we ordered appetizers - fried mushrooms and bruschetta. The mushrooms were salty and the presentation left something to be desired. The bruschetta was a little better. I had asked the server if I could order a caprese salad. He said no. They don't make it. So I opted for grilled romaine, which I regretted immediately after I ordered it. Gordon Ramsey would be ashamed (all I kept thinking was him ripping a chef for \\"grilling\\" a salad and what a stupid idea that was). Amongst all thehub bub of wine and mushrooms, I had asked the server for more bread and he pretty much scolded me and said no he's busy serving our salads. My husband and I looked at each other like \\"oh shit\\". Which was ashamed as the bread with olive oil and parmesan was the best thing of the whole night.  As a main entree, I had the Linguine Luci Johnson, which was okay. Not bad, not great.  All in all - it was an okay experience. I was almost thinking we should've went to the Pho restaurant next door. The customer service was sub par, the atmosphere was so-so and the food was okay. I am always willing to forgo atmosphere and customer service (to a certain extent) as long as the food rocks!

Are they delicious, yes, are they nutritious, not really, does delicious rhyme with nutritious, yes.  The patties are always cooked to perfection (if you don't ask it will be a juicy medium rare). The buns are sweet but not over the top in sweetness. The toppings always seem fresh and never piled on to the point that your burger ends in a colossal mess. \\n\\nSo why is this not number one?

I tried the octopus, but I didn't like it.  The other three people at our table who tried it liked it.  The zucchini fritters were just fine, but nothing to write home about,  The giant white beans were the highlight of the meal, in my opinion.  The giant white beans were covered with a delicious sauce and tasted like a delicious bean stew.\\n\\nMain dishes ordered:\\n\\nLamb with round potato like things - I was told that it was delicious\\n\\nHalibut with tomato sauce - I tried this dish and found it to be okay.  The fish tasted very fresh, but the dish lacked spice and was bland.\\n\\nArctic char with wild mushrooms (I and one other person in our party ordered this dish) - After reading the wonderful reviews, I was so disappointed in the entire dish.  The char (like the halibut) tasted very fresh, but lacked spice.  I much prefer steelhead trout.  I LOVE wild mushrooms, but they were doused in a nasty vinegar sauce that completely canceled out the deliciousness of the mushrooms.\\n\\nSome kind of Greek root soup - It looked pathetic and it contained the same nasty mushroom sauce as my char dish.  This dish received no love at all.\\n\\nTuna tartare - I didn't try it, but the person who ordered it sounded as though she were about to have an orgasm while eating it, so I'm guessing it was pretty damned good.  It was the most beautiful dish of the night.\\n\\nSpanokapitas - No complaints and no raves.\\n\\nThe donuts were delicious, but the blueberry thing we ordered had some sort of weird spice - maybe anise.  Our server told us that some other people had made the same complaint, but after our waiter consulted with the chef, he returned to our table to tell us that there was no spice other than blueberry.\\n\\nOur server was wonderful.

I've had some really good ceviche during my time in South America and this unfortunately did not compare. Not to mention that ceviche in Peru is typically served with A LOT of red onion.

They would have been better had they been dipped in some sort of sauce or something after being smoked.  The resulting finish on the wings was very dry and there was an abundance of \\"flaky\\" seasoning which would break off on its own in your mouth.

This helps endow Hopdoddy with that trendy must-try mystique which apparently makes it a real pain in the ass to visit during peak hours when lines can be out the door. \\n\\nLuckily I went when there was no such line and so was served fairly quickly. Their quirky upscale burger selection is congruent with the clean modern d√©cor, both of which are top notch. Basil pesto, salsa roja, and truffle aioli are just a few of the unorthodox accoutrements that decorate their burgers and you can even customize (for an additional fee) with things like avocado and bacon. While the truffle fries are also very tasty, they weren't some paradigm shift in potato cuisine. They are just tasty fries, period. \\n\\nThe milkshakes on the other hand turnt it up. I'm reminded of the scene in pulp fiction where John Travolta has to know what a $5 milkshake tastes like. After trying it...\\"That's a pretty f***ing good milkshake, I don't know if its worth $5, but its pretty f***ing good.\\" Well this milkshake is worth five dollars, and honestly eclipses the burgers. While I'm not confident in saying that hopdoddy's is the best burger I've ever had, it's certainly the best milkshake, and in all earnestness I think the owners should consider expanding their milkshake selection and renaming the establishment Hopdoddy Milkeshake Bar.\\n\\nIs this place often packed? Yes. Is it a little touristy? Yes. Are you going to pay more than at P. Terry's?

Sure if it's not going to be much longer. 1 table left around us that has already eaten.

I was lucky enough to sample a piece of the Chicken as well (the serving size was more than ample) and I have to admit the chicken was just as good, if not better than the Lamb.

And the menu has a hundred items on it, no descriptions, and no pictures. \\n\\nTruth be told though, everything at Myers Chang is available at a lower price at any of the many Chinese restaurants in town (just ask them to use less oil, I'm sure they'd comply) and they would do just as good of a job making it. Actually, you could make it yourself; the dishes are extremely simple to make (I tried about half the menu, and the more \\"exotic\\" items, at that)."},{"name":"Yard House","address":"825 Battery Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"This is some great food right here!!! We went on a Friday night around 6:30pm and surprisingly it wasn't packed. I have heard so many good things about the Nashville chicken so I decided to give it a try. I also ordered BBQ baked beans as a side. Needless to say, my meal was phenomenal. The chicken breast was very tender and include a hot honey sauce on the side for dipping. The chicken also came with sweet potato pancakes which were amazing! You could taste the cinnamon and nutmeg too. It was great by itself and didn't need any syrup. The beans had a kick of spiciness that I enjoyed as well. To end my meal, I tried the mini peach apple cobbler which was just enough dessert for one serving.

It was the first time I'd heard of this place, and coming from Nashville my BBQ standards are pretty high, so I was a little skeptical coming to a place I hadn't actually researched on my own, but when at SXSW you kind of just roll with the punches, and the spots that still have food after 2pm.   We arrived and there was a bit of a long line, I saw a couple items already marked off of the board, so it was basically down to sausage, turkey, and my favorite part of food group; brisket.  As we were going through the line, we observed the merchandise selection, tee's to hot sauce, the added bonuses were really the fact that you could buy drinks while going through the line before getting to the buffet of side dishes offered. We all grabbed our beers, and prayed that there would still be brisket on the list by the time we got to the carving station.  Just as the words, \\"I hope they don't run out of brisket\\", passed my lips a gentleman walked up to me and my friend to let us know we would more than likely be the last two getting the remaining brisket of the day. Naturally I smiled with glee, because that was pretty much the only way I was going to be able to have a real opinion on this place.    We got to the buffet of sides, and to my delight, the offerings were as southern comfort as you could get, collared greens, to peach cobbler, if you could think of it, they seemed to have it.   At 1.98 a serving size I grabbed the green beans, collard greens, corn bread and peach cobbler so I could try the basics I passed on the beans because they just looked like Texas style pinto, no offense to the Texas beans, but I favor my beans baked and sweet.  We got down to the carving station, the way the pricing worked was set by the pound 13 for the sausage and 17.98 for the brisket. I was with a bunch of guys so I knew I would only have to get what I was looking for, and I could nibble on their plates being that they had everything on it.  Most of the boys grabbed all three remaining meats, I opted for the fatty side of the brisket at about 2 or 3 slices and a sausage.  My tab at the end with the beer was around 30 something bucks. A bit pricy for a plate with no ribs on it, so the my thoughts were this food better be killer.  \\n\\nWe sat down at the community style tables in the dining hall, the fully stocked utensil station was right next to us. Everything was neat and tidy, you can tell that they focus on not just the food but the environment, in making sure things stay clean, a plus when dealing with a festival like crowd.   I went straight to the task of eating, first thing I tried was the sausage, smokey, with a little heat, nice little burn where the fire hit the casing, nice and juicy on the in side,  gave me an indication that the pit master knew what they were doing with the flame.  I tried the brisket next, it pretty much melted on my tongue since I got the fatter side of the meat, however the leaner portions were still just as tender, everything was well seasoned, cause for a good few, \\"wow this spot is really good\\" statements.  I heard the boys raving about the turkey, I'm not a huge turkey person unless it's cooked at my uncles house, I am probably not going to eat it, but I was finally convinced when my friend just stuck a piece of turkey in my mouth before I could argue with him about it.  The turkey hands down was the best turkey I've had next to my uncles, and the best of the meats I had on my plate. It was moist, smokey, the seasoning used absorbed into the meat, it melted in my mouth like the fatty side of the brisket did.  I was highly impressed and tempted to get back to the carving station just to buy a slice of my own.  The sides I had were all great as well, nothing completely stood out except for the peach cobbler to me, granted my standards for collard greens and green beans especially have to measure up to my favorite spot in Nashville, Martin's BBQ, they were close however, I think the collards were my favorite.  The peach cobbler was everything a cobbler should be, buttery flour based crust and peaches cooked down in cinnamon, sugar, vanilla and whatever secret ingredient your granny taught your mother to put in that makes it tastes like it has crack in it.  Whomever Terry's grandmother is, is a genius.  It was perfection.    All and All I can give Terry Black's 5 stars because everything measured up to what I find great about BBQ joints, the service staff at the carving station were really friendly, it was clean and organized at the self serving stations, and the food was really solid, especially that turkey.  Though I found it to be a little pricier than spots I am used to, it was worth it, and you do leave completely satisfied wishing you could take home a bit more.  I would definitely go back, especially knowing that I won't have to wait 3 hours to get a plate."},{"name":"Pearl Hot Pot","address":"7154 Sperling Avenue","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3","text":"Love it here!

The ginger taste wasn't too overpowering and overall the bok choy was cooked very well. 5 stars because I love a good dish of veggies\\n3) BBQ lamb ribs--I don't particularly like lamb, but thought the ribs were pretty good. They were seasoned well and very flavorful without being too overpowering. The meat was as tender as I expected lamb to be and the presentation of the dish was very nice. We got six ribs, which was decent sized. 4 stars\\n4) Szechuan dan dan noodles--this was my boyfriend's favorite dish, and I have to say it was pretty good.

Tasted great with the arugula. I had also order the lavender latte which was the most popular drink. I was not a fan of it, very light taste to it and not hot enough for me. The small pancake was the highlight. Light, crispy and fluffy. Also there were not your traditional dipping sauce, I had the caramel, white chocolate, and mixed berry. All three was very flavorful, the most appealing sauce to me was the white chocolate mixed in with the berry. \\n\\nOverall it was a good experience and a great lunch or brunch spot. It was not the best but definitely worth a try. The service was good and took their time to explain what I wanted. I dont know if it was good enough for people who have waited over 30 minutes, but in LA I would definitely gone to another location."},{"name":"Babica Hen Cafe","address":"15964 Boones Ferry Rd","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"4","text":"Best in my opinion for lunch (breakfast is popular here but be prepared for a longer wait)-- usually no wait during lunch hour and service is consistently good.

As you can see from some of my photos , me and my wife ended up having a hard time choosing what we wanted because we had so many good options. They even had cakes with gold foil dressing on top. While that was too big for us , what we did end up having was a couple of cappucinos presented in best manner possible ie i have seen such presentation only on TV and it was that good. The cappucino itself was smooth and well done. We also had a couple of pastries that i am having a hard time even pronouncing or remembering the name as it was the first time i had come across pastries with such unique name and it was called something on lines of suisse cake and was of course of french origin apparently. It is the cake with yellow color icing a chocolate stick dressing on top and i personally had a chocolate cake with a silver foil dressing on top and it was actually dark chocolate (really ) with cake base on inside and i actually found that the best way to eat it was to invert the cake and eat it. And finally to macaroons, this place and vancouver in general had some of the best macaroon flavors i had tasted in a while and in this place i came across a unique jasmine flavored macaroon that was  a delight to eat. Subtly flavored with not overpowering jasmine flavor, it seemed to hit right balance between flavoring and retaining essence of macaroon taste one would usually expect and that to me was sign of a cafe that knows what its doing.\\n\\nWould i recommend it , ABSOLUTELY!!! without a doubt and batting an eyelid i would.

The lounge area is intimate with low lighting, floor pillows, and murals filling up the entirety of the walls.  The hookahs were clean and high quality.

The $3 corking fee is minimal and you'll still pay way less than drinking at a normal restaurant... and drinking your favorites too!  \\n\\nTo be fair and honest, the night was not all flawless and rosy.  In fact, the lounge was double booked for two different birthdays.  Not only was it super crowded trying to fit my 15 plus with another group, things got awkward when it came to singing Happy Birthday.  The other birthday girl's friends started singing and mine joined in... yelling happy birthday dear ALICIA to many dirty looks from the other party.  That was embarrassing, and not only did my friends steal birthday girl's thunder, apparently her name was Akeisha so the other group then reprimanded us for mispronouncing her name.

When a bartender or server walks right by customer and doesn't even look their way, it's the worst sign to a customer.  The bartender was friendly but my Coco Refresher was a huge let down. Not limey and no ice. We had to flag her down a lot, even to cash out the check. She was not unpleasant or completely inattentive but I couldn't say in all honesty that the service was good. \\n\\nThe bar was half full and the restaurant was half empty.   The guy bar manager was there and probably training our bartender, didn't see him making many drinks but heard him socializing a lot and dropping a lot of F-bombs (in that loud, annoying voice no less) which I just don't get.  YOU WORK THERE! THERE ARE CUSTOMERS HERE and you can't stop sprinkling your boring, loud story with F-bombs.  Very, very bad.  \\n\\nSo it was an enormous let down.  The food was still good but everything else matters just as much and just about everything else was awful. Maybe it was the night. I'll give them that. But these babies behind bars need to learn to work just a little.  I get the socializing, totally but the swearing for all to hear, is just such an unbelievable turn off.  I'll go again and I hope it's a little different.  I would recommend it, with caution."},{"name":"Bijou Cafe","address":"132 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"A Portland Classic.

I have now had three meals here inside of two-weeks and I have a good idea of how the place runs.  While the history of burgers is shrouded in mystery (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger#History), there is no doubt that the food has come a long way. Blais' latest incarnation, though not entirely unique , is inspiring and opposite the drove of gastropubs that are all the rage.\\n\\nFlip is a restaurant with a lot of good things going; however, there are a plethora of inconsistencies and kinks that need to be worked out to prevent this place from chewing itself up in all of the buzz.\\n\\nI have sampled nearly everything on the menu and found the shakes to be interesting, the sides to be intriguing, and the burgers to be very \\"Blais\\" and very inconsistent.  Contrary to popular belief, and their own website misinformation, Richard Blais is not the chef.   That title goes to Mark Nanna, who worked under Blais at h2s' Home.  That aside, the menu is a complete Blais' concept, and it shows!\\n\\nAt its' core, this is a burger joint.  The sides and shakes make a difference, but people go here to try the the Po Boyger, not the tempura rutabaga, though it is tasty.  The menu reflects the creative simplicity of the food and the decor.  Before you jump out of your seat after reading \\"simplicity,\\" hear me out.  The menu is focused - and in that respect it is simple.  There are seventeen burgers on the menu, if you count the Burger of the Day special, and they sit defiantly opposite the sides, joined in the middle by the shakes.  The cute trick here is that you have to flip the menu upside to read it in its' entirety. This works great in person, though not so much on the website (more on that later).\\n\\nThe patties are not quite sliders, but not quite full grown either.  They are constructed out of everything from mushrooms to shrimp, fit neatly onto the buns, and come topped with a variety of sauces, vegetables, and cheeses.  They are pre-set, so while you do not have the option to mix and match your own toppings, it works better as I'm sure people would be intimidated by the number of nuances.  Blais and Nanna do a great job with the flavor matching; however, they fail on their ability to execute a consistent experience.\\n\\nPerhaps the biggest failure is in the cooking temperature.  While I tend to be somewhat lackadaisical in my acceptance of the terminology, I do know the difference between medium, medium rare, and medium well.  I cannot say the same for Flips' kitchen.  Though the waitstaff will not ask you how you like your burgers (all are supposedly medium), they will generally accommodate requests.  I asked for my steak tartar burger to be well done.  While the humor in the request was not lost on anyone, I was summarily rejected.  Thank goodness!  You're best to disregard cooking temperature and focus on texture and flavor.\\n\\nRan out of room - rest on blog"},{"name":"Babica Hen Cafe","address":"15964 Boones Ferry Rd","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"4","text":"Having been back twice now, I really stand by my original thoughts - but here's the thing: it's better than that.

Mimosas for the adults, fresh juice for the kids...a good time all around.  Have a latte - they're fabulously subtle.  Really, one of Lake Grove's gems.\\n\\nIt's seriously difficult to be honest here - I don't want our new favorite place (which, I suppose, is already many other people's favorite place) to get so popular we can't eat there...but as such, I have to say they're pretty awesome and as such deserve some recognition.

Everything we tried was delicious.  We had sausages in pastry rolls, sundried tomato and brie pillows with berry sauce, meat pie (mmmm), crumpets (not at all an English muffin I learned), scotch eggs (sage and onion sausage wrapped around a hard-boiled egg), baked bean bag (heinz baked beans in a pastry bag), tuna melt on Jackson's white bread and more.  We could not get enough.  The kids were happy with their meals as well.  I had Emily's Tour of England myself (could easily have served two) which provided me with extra to take home.  There are fun British signs and chotchkies throughout the restaurant.  Displays on one side provide a British mini-mart with candies, chocolates, take-home crumpets and other delicacies.

Two sunny side up eggs, one french sausage, one chorizo and on the side was toasted foccacia bread. I drank a raspberry/caramel coffee (which had real raspberry seeds in it!!!) very unique and appreciated. \\n\\nMy partner had two waffles (yummy but ... not good bang for buck as they were pretty small roughly around 3 inches in diameter) with a side of caramel and dark chocolate. \\n\\nOverall very good dining experience, service was good but not great ( this is excused as they were very busy) but washrooms were clean and well maintained. The restaurant played some good classic rock guitar music, nice art on the walls. The waiter could not tell me if the art was local or not, that is OK though. The cutlery was clean and no water stains, and were wrapped in paper. The place looks like it was originally a loft of some sort. Worth checking out the place. \\n\\nWe spent a little over $30 for our meals and drinks. Overall good experience but a wee bit pricey for brunch. Really should be reserved for those days you don't mind spending a bit more money for quality. But not an every day experience. \\n\\nA quick note about washrooms, I would highly recommend that you also check out the facilities at any restaurants you eat in. Reasonably clean washrooms, hand towels (or dryer) and adequate soap. As well as clean toilet, floor and urinal is a sign of a good restaurant. I am a stickler when it comes to cleanliness and restaurants, nothing ticks me off more to have a washroom with no soap or ways to dry my hands.

So my fiance and I came here on a rainy sat. night hoping to grab a seat at the bar and have a bite to eat and some drinks. The bar was more crowded than expected (good  for them!), so we put our name in up front for a table to be safe. The girl told us \\"i'm thinking its around 30 mins\\". Holding my rain jacket and standing awkwardly in a tight space behind people who had seats, we are now well into our 2nd cocktail with no seats appearing to open up. I decide to check on the table since it's now been at least 30 mins. Me: \\"Hey are all those empty/dirty 2-tops around the bar part of your reservations system or are they part of the bar area? They've been like that since we got here.\\"  Hostess:\\"sometimes they are part of the bar but tonight we are full with reservations so we are using them for reservations\\". OK.... another 20 mins go by and those same tables are all still dirty and not being sat. My back was starting to ache for standing in a tight spot for  an hour and I was starting to get tipsy since I didnt expect to wait over an hour to have a bite to eat when I was told 30 mins. Finally- my back ached so badly we just sat at the dirty table to finish up our cocktails and ponder where else we should go for dinner. Within a minute or two a server came over to clean the table and serve us and didn't ask any questions. The other two dirty tables were still that way after we ate and left.  If you are fully committed on reservations and not taking walk-ins for tables, then fine. But tell me that before I wait an hour+(instead of 30 mins), dropping $50 at the bar with no possibility of getting any area to eat on the horizon. On a positive note: the bartenders and servers were all very attentive and the food we ended ordering once we sat was decent.

The nightmare parking situation! I don't know when all these people came who say \\"Parking was plentiful\\" etc. I live in the area, and I can tell you, parking is a problem almost every time I go there (usually weekdays), mainly because of the crowds swarming the yoga studio next door.

Okay to get pie, banana pudding and cobbler as your sides. Cole slaw and potato salad were okay, but the other sides were very greasy looking and not appealing. Beef ribs were too fatty, our dog loved the bone though we should've asked for a refund. Didn't get brisket because it looked too fatty, just tried sausage, rib and turkey. There's ice cream, too. \\nWent there last week early evening it's not for daily visits and yes it's very overpriced. There was an incredibly gracious older gentleman playing guitar that amazed everyone, but it was so hot everyone kept going outside then right back in due to the high temperature. Played authentic country blues what a nice surprise compared to the stock CW radio that was on when we got there! There is an inside stage type corner area, so perhaps music will be indoors once they get comfortably settled in......opened just a couple of months ago so there's lots to improve. Service pretty slow at cash register and maybe once they get more cashiers hired they'll  use the other registers. $2  & $3 iced beer, not sure if that's HH or regular prices.\\nThe overall prices were way too high for casual serve yourself cafeteria dining, Bill Miller sausage is at least twice as good and all the side dishes cost less and taste better than here, the turkey was about the same. This would've been a 1 star review without the veteran finger picking, slide guitar and amazing vocals. So if you've got $$$ to spare it's worth a try, but you might want to wait a few months for this place to hopefully refine and improve. They're definitely raking in plenty of money and they're smart enough to hire decent musicians so maybe Black's will break the curse of this location.

Now, take my review with a grain of salt, as I am not Texan and have only been to a handful of other top-50 BBQ places in TX over the years: Salt Lick, Stiles Switch, Blue Ox, Valentina's, J Mueller's, La BBQ, and maybe 1-2 more. But, of that list, this place had the best brisket AND the best beef ribs. The people were friendly, and I went for a late lunch on a Tuesday, so there was no line. That being said, about 200 people were eating there already, so it is clearly a hopping place even at \\"quiet\\" times. I tried two side dishes, as well as the cornbread, but we do better sides and cornbread in Tennessee. This place is all about the beef. My only two issues, which are quite minor, are 1) that the BBQ is a little salty. You definitely need to eat it with bread, slaw, or something to cut the salt. But that's pretty standard in my book, and I'm just splitting hairs and looking for anything they could improve upon. My second \\"beef\\" (pun intended) is the price: $115 for 2-3 peoples' worth of food! In TN, BBQ is poor man's food. Clearly, this is not the case in TX. Still, the brisket was so orgasmically good that I will relish any opportunity to come back to this place the next time I'm in Austin.

A good fit for a first date or small group. What you would generally imagine from an Italian hole-in-the-wall, however, in further inspection, the details were wrong.

We weren't expecting a free desert, but there was never an extra mention of \\"Happy Birthday!\\"\\n\\nAt the end of the day, I wasn't happy about my meal.

There wasn't much sesame going on, but whatever they sprinkle on the cucubmers was actually pretty tasty. Not much other flavoring besides that.\\n\\n*Spicy Brussels Sprouts- WOW!

I've also had their curry rice, and though the owner told me they don't make their own curry because they used to but so few people order it now, it was actually pretty good. \\n\\nThe place itself is pretty fun, though. They have a good sized space with an area that has a large TV where I've seen people playing Wii, and they occasionally have DJs in that area, too. They also have loads of flat screen TVs playing sports, and a good sound system.

I've been going since it opened and finally visited for the new pre fixe tasting menu.  At first, I was kind of bummed about not being able to control my meal and its cost, but after trying the new way, I'm a fan!  Nothing better than a tasting menu where you can sit back, relax, and EAT.  We tried a beer pairing which I'm not sure is the most bang for your buck but the beers did pair perfectly as expected.  You do not get a beer with every course so it's not a pairing like that.  The meal started with a complimentary glass of sparkling wine and ended with a dessert like no other.  Not going to go dish by dish because it changes all the time.  Another difference in the \\"tasting menu\\" from other restaurants is that you don't get your own plate.  You still share almost all things like the old Barley Swine.  I personally love this because I always go with my favorite folks like my spouse or best friends.  I would probably not love this if I had to share with someone who was sick or I wouldn't actually drink after.  Just something to expect!  The service is stellar every single time.  Dinner is $70 for 12-13 courses and a beer pairing is an additional $30.  I believe the wine pairing is an additional $50.  Go, make a reservation if you can, and enjoy!  I've never made a reservation there and have never had to wait.  Guess I've gotten lucky!  The Horseshoe Lounge is always open for some beers while you wait though.

I decided to meet one of my friends at the new location for lunch.  It took almost 90 minutes for us to grab our \\"quick\\" lunch.\\n\\nHere is what happened.  I ordered the cobb salad and clam chowder soup.  He ordered the house salad with a spinach pizza.  When his pizza came, it was an artichoke pizza.  They had to bake him another pizza, which took forever.  I was eating my lackluster cobb (maybe my least favorite cobb ever) and feeling bad that he was without anything for so long.\\n\\nWhat really annoys me is that it was the waiter who rang in the order wrong and the manager knew about all of this and did not even comp my buddy's meal.

Then for years after I never tasted any more Cochinita Pibil until I vacationed in the Yucatan. Again I was floored by the flavor combination of slow roasted pork and tangy bitter oranges and ground achiote seeds. And duly impressed by the achiote's ability to dye whatever it touched red. \\n\\nHappily I eventually landed in Cherrywood, and discovered that a short stroll away El Chilito serves up an excellent Cochinta Pibil, taco or burrito, tasty and guaranteed to authentically stain your fingers red. Their tomatillo pork is also excellent, tangy and uplifting. For that matter the barbacoa, carne asada, carne guisado, and picadillo are all very good. Even their fish tacos are good, and I usually don't like fish tacos. And as others have said before me, their breakfast tacos are phenomenal. \\n\\nBut be clear, it is just a joint, not a restaurant, and as informal as it gets. You order at one outside window and pick up at another when your number is called. The only seating is a covered patio with crappy old lawn furniture and some fans and too many hipsters. But never mind, you go there for the FOOD, which is scratch made, and cheap and delicious. The staff is cheerful and there are great horchatas and Mexican Coca-Colas (made with cane sugar, not \\"high fructose corn syrup\\") and paletas, Mexican style frozen desserts in flavors like guava and mango. \\n\\nPlus, and I'm not sure why so many reviewers are confused on this point, they do serve beer (currently Lone Star, Tecate, and Shiner Bock on draft) and wine if you are eating on the patio, and they often have a pretty tasty sangria available. \\n\\nFor what it is, it's excellent."},{"name":"Schmidt's Sausage Haus","address":"240 E Kossuth St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Two words for you: cream. puff.

It was the perfect size, not too big but not slider sized either, and it was obvious that the chef took his time plating the food.  It was almost too pretty to eat!  I quickly got over that thought and proceeded to cut my burger in half.  As soon as my knife cut into the burger, the condiments were all over my plate.  To say that they over-did it on they ketchup is a mild understatement.  Other than the fact that I looked like a kid fingerpainting with my food, the burger itself was quite satisfactory.\\n\\nMy dining companions had eaten at Flip before and had great experiences.  They enjoyed their orders - the Corned Beef Burger for David and the Po Boyger for Joel C.  They each had shakes which they really enjoyed.  David had the Krispy Kreme shake and Joel C. had Nutella and Marshmellow. What's not to like about any of those things?\\n\\nWe all split an order of fries and sweet potato tots.  Normally, I love all things sweet potato.  I am a carb junkie and eating sweet potato lets me delude myself into thinking it is health food.  The fries were excellent.  Crisp but not killed, with the perfect pinch of salt.  And now, the Tot.  How I wanted to love thee!  I took one bite and it was an explosion of grease in my mouth.  Had I not been in public and taught better by my mom - I would have (discreetly of course) spit it out into my napkin and chug water to rid my tongue of the greasy film.  Instead, I forced myself to swallow it.  Bad idea.  I felt gross for the rest of the evening.\\n\\nOverall, aside from the Tot, my experience at Flip was a great one.

I love this place! This Bartaco in West Midtown is very close to my home with exceptional service and food! Upon entering the restaurant it was apparent that even on a Wednesday night there was a full crowd. The interior was lovely with very cool baskets as lighting fixtures. The hostess at the front door was very cheery and even offered a choice between a table or a booth, she also took the dirty dishes off our table as well which was a very pleasant surprise! Love seeing hostesses care about their guests even though they aren't serving them, themselves. (little things count)  The booth we were seated at was cozy and the fill in yourself ordering slips were fun to use. Our server Natale was very attentive and was sure to explain how the ordering system worked since it was our first time dining there. As a starter we ordered the guacamole with chips which were phenomenal! The guacamole was very zesty with lime and the chunky avocados were to die for. The chips were large and round, perfectly salted.  I decided to go for 2 chicken tacos, and a sesame ribeye. Bartaco does have to option to sub for flour tortillas instead of corn. My boyfriend ordered a chicken bowl. The tacos were amazing especially with the guacamole. The speed of service was executed very nicely with the tacos. Unfortunately, the chicken bowl didn't make it to our table in time to be eaten with my meal so I ended up having to give my boyfriend one of my chicken tacos. When the chicken bowl did arrive it was decent. The ratio of peppers compared to the chicken and rice was extremely over done. I would definitely recommend getting the tacos over the bowls! Since we did have to wait so long for the chicken bowl our server took the initiative to comp the item, which was very professional on her part. Prices are extremely fair for the quality of food that is received. The food was wonderful but the service was even better! This will definitely become one of my go to spot for dinner!"},{"name":"Ramen Ryoma","address":"10500 SW Beaverton Hillsdale Hwy","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4.5","text":"Service was a little disorganized but the food was tasty and arrived in a timely manner"},{"name":"Whiskey's Food & Spirits","address":"885 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"Patronizing this place is akin to culinary prostitution, as you will be literally paying to get screwed. I am forced to give a minimum 1-star rating due to Yelp's system, where I want to give it a .7 stars.  That rating is based on the fact that the bar is at least enclosed in a safe structure presumably up to code, and that there is oxygen available to breath.  I will not be returning to this place, which is ok.  With food, you need to experience the \\"bad\\" sometimes in order to really appreciate the \\"good\\".\\n\\nPlease keep in mind as you read the following review that I pride myself on being a patient customer, with an above average ability to perceive other causes of a negative experience.  \\n\\nTo begin, the waitress (who appears to be the same blonde staff portrayed in another Yelper's review) was aloof and running around the bar area like it was a crazy night and packed to the rafters....the reality is that it was 1:30pm on a Saturday and mildly busy.  Either she is inexperienced, had a bad morning, or plain old \\"don't give a **** because they're all tourists anyway\\" due to being near Newbury St.\\n\\nThe service, being centered on this staff, suffered because of her presence.  I saw several other patrons rolling their eye or becoming impatient as the barkeep floundered around.  Her attitude was bad and conveyed that she doesn't know square-one about customer service.  To boot, an owner-esque woman came to help the barkeep at some point and she gave off an aura being bothered to help.  Either way, it didn't help the situation.\\n\\nOur food came late, taking a half hour for honey-buffalo wings and were cold.  The waitress actually offered to put in a new order for us, and then never followed up with us to let us know.  Our time was tight, so we ate the cold wings and asked to cash out.  As we were leaving the new wings came out and the barkeep acted offended that we didn't want them.

Instead of apologizing and fixing the issue, she argued with us. 'The sauce is baked into the pizza.' We tore the pizza apart to show her, no, there is no sauce and the deep dish pizza promises cooked delicious tomatoes. She then took about 10 minutes and came back with an ice cold cup of ice cold chopped salad tomatoes. Again, never apologizing for our completely ruined dinner.

The bbq beans are so good though, like seriously i can eat a medium order of those on top of all the food i order, funny thing is i hated them back in grade school but the ones at gus do not disappoint. If you're sensitive to spiciness like i was, make sure to get the white chicken, the white chicken is a lot less spicy than the dark meat and it still is very moist if you're worried about that.

Once you finally crack the inside of the restaurant, you receive a table number, and then and only then can you order food (and drinks, etc.) from a cashier. Alongside the wall near the cashier is a soda fountain and condiment bar. Make sure to try all of their ketchup varieties! When you sit down at a table, you get ANOTHER server who can take any extra orders (I think) and will bring your food and handle refills. It took us about 40 minutes to be seated, and another 15 to get our food. \\nThe chief reason I'm giving Hopdoddy's 4 instead of 5 stars is that I remember the serving system better than I remember the food. The food IS delicious, but anything would be after waiting that long. I had the burger special, which had bourbon bacon jam and arugula. It was yummy, but overwhelmed by the bourbon bacon jam. My husband had the Classic burger, and we split an order of truffle fries. He found his burger very, very, juicy, to the point that it became hard to eat. The bun basically dissolved. The truffle fries were yummy, but not overwhelmingly delicious enough to merit the cost. I loved the parmesan bits at the bottom more than the fries. \\nIn short, despite the complicated ordering system and long wait, it's a good restaurant if you can spare the time. I can't wait to go back and try more burgers, and perhaps a shake this time!"},{"name":"Dr Feelgood's Pub","address":"20419 SW Tualatin Valley Hwy","city":"Beaverton","stars":"2.5","text":"what a skank hole of a bar. Atmosphere is nasty, drinks suck and the help should be shoved off to Gitmo. Last time I was in there played a little video poker. I won 5 bucks, no big deal.

You know when you have good service when your waiter/waitress pulls up a seat and actually talks and answers any questions you have, especially being our first time there. Always attentive to us and asking if we needed anything, filling up drinks and bringing more chips and salsa out without us having to ask.\\n\\nOrdering our first Purple margarita we were informed they do a drink point system to garner the limit of drinks since they're drinks have big kicks to them. The purple ones were 2 limit which was the least and we knew why when we each took a sip. Bobby wanted to see our face with the first sip and asked us to take one lol. But these were the best, balances out the flavor and wasn't too strong of alcohol were you can smell it. We also shared a mango margarita which at some places some fruit flavored were too syrupy and rich, not the case the alcohol was able to balance the taste and was just overall a good drink.\\n\\nTo the food, the chips were fresh and crispy, which I almost always base how meixcan food is by trying their chips out, the salsa was ok just average at best. I ordered carne guisada and the wife got puffy beef tacos which we shared both plates as always. I tried the famed carne guisada at Cura's in Austin but was dry and not really good at all. \\n\\nWas scanning for carnitas or pollo con queso didn't saw either so again tried my luck with carne guisada. The menu states it has gravy on it which I thought it meant \\"sauce\\" because some places have different meaning of the two. Nope was actual gravy, tasted like a Mexican pot roast or stew. Wasn't digging it but since this is a Americanize Mexican restaurant my plate probably determined that. The charro beans which found out is a staple here in central Texas is one of my favorite sides now and they were awesome, the rice was ok not as good as I eat at other places.\\n\\nWife's puffy tacos essentially was a fried tortilla puffed out from the oil and was pretty true to its name . Needed to eat it easier with a fork...again I know this place isn't best for authentic Mexican food but for others want to know this is how these dishes turned out.\\n\\nOverall as stated before this place seems to be known best for drinks and drink specials, they earned a margarita customer and someone who'll ask for Bobby if he's waiting or just hop up to the bar and see if he's bartending. Highly suggest him to request to wait for you, him and the margaritas makes this a 3 star rating alone."},{"name":"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers and Brews","address":"5043 Tuttle Crossing Blvd, Ste 205","city":"Dublin","stars":"3","text":"Red Robin has become one of my favorite burger spots.

Select a Fish (we tried the Sea Bream, DH Loved this, I thought it was ok) .

Don't get lost in the hustle. And don't order anything fancy like coffee or gin and tonic because they don't have it. The staff, primarily comprised of East Boston locals with heavy accents, can't help but exude an air of offhand sarcasm, so don't be offended. If you want water, you have to ask for it. If you want extra hot peppers, you might get them ten minutes later from a begrudgingly busy waiter. However, once you realize it's an Eastie thing, it's easy to see the gruff nature of the servers in an unexpectedly charming way. After going to Santarpio's once a week for a few months and tipping well each time (once our tip even warranted a hug), it's safe to say that you'll get more attention, longer conversations, and quicker service. On a side note, they don't deliver and they don't take reservations, but take-out is available for pizza only.\\n\\nFood: 5/5 Pizza snobs rejoice. The pizza at Santarpio's is simply the best in Boston. It's so good that I never get anything except the Italian Cheese Pizza because I don't want anything to detract from the oven-charred, thin, cornmeal crusted pie loaded with gooey, greasy cheese, and ample amounts of the hot, well-seasoned fresh tomato base that is cooked in-house. Santarpio's builds their pies with the toppings on the bottom, so don't have a heart attack if you don't see the sausage, mushrooms, and peppers on top of the cheese. The meat isn't marinated in an elaborate blend of seasonings, but the huge hunk of Italian bread and hot peppers compliment the charcoal-grilled meat's natural flavor. The food is simple, traditional, and delicious. I wouldn't change a thing. Plenty of vegetarian and meat friendly options. No Gluten-free crust substitutes available.\\n\\nAtmosphere: 5/5 The smell of grilled meats and savory pizza fills the dimly lit, no-frills, noisy interior. This fourth-generation family run pizzeria heavily exudes an old school vibe. Photographs and memorabilia from the early 1900‚Ä≤s adorn the windowless wood paneled walls, the jukebox plays everything from Aerosmith and Frank Sinatra to Akon and Lil' Wayne. If you're looking for a laid-back place to get authentic Italian pizza, this is the only place to go. It's a great spot to take out-of-towners because it's near the airport and imparts a unique, cultural experience.\\n\\nPrice: 5/5 You can easily get away with a two person dinner for less than $30.00. A large cheese pizza (the only size available) costs less than $10.00 (and easily feeds two hungry people), drinks range from a dollar or two for soda to $15.00 for a bottle of wine, and barbecue items (steak tips, lamb, homemade sausage) are less than $8.00 each. What I love about this place is that the quality of the food- always fresh and delicious. The East Boston location only takes cash, but there's a cash machine conveniently located in the back of the restaurant. The Peabody location accepts all major credit cards.\\n\\nParking: 5/5 Street parking is available on Chelsea Street and there's a small parking area to the left of Santarpio's (East Boston). The streets aren't metered, so parking is free. Just remember to bring cash for the airport toll on the way home (if you're heading back toward Boston). For public transit-goers, take the Blue Line and get off at Maverick Station. Then walk about 6 minutes down Chelsea Street and toward Porter Street. Santarpio's will be on the right about a block before Porter.\\n\\nRecommendations:\\n\\n-Italian Cheese Pizza\\n\\n-Italian Cheese Pizza with Hot Peppers\\n\\n-Single Homemade Sausage with Bread and Hot Peppers\\n\\n-Single Steak Tip with Bread and Hot Peppers\\n\\n-House Red Wine\\n\\n-Bottle of Budweiser"},{"name":"Les Faux Bourgeois","address":"663 E 15th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I'm breaking my self-imposed rule of not reviewing a restaurant before I eat a full meal there, but breaking it for my lovely experience at Les Faux seems worth it.

I ordered the braised ox tails with mashed potatoes, fried green tomatoes, and collard greens.  While my hubby and the roommate both ordered the fried chicken with miscellaneous sides one of which included the mac and cheese.\\n\\nMy oxtails, greens, and mashed potatoes were delicious!  I had never had fried green tomatoes before, and although I thought they were well seasoned, thought maybe they were too soggy?  But maybe that's how they turn out since the tomatoes are mostly water anyway.  I tried my husbands fried chicken and both the room-mate, husband, and myself agreed that it was good, but way to greasy (you would take a bite and the oil would dribble down your chin!  The Mac and cheese, was also not that memorable as it didn't have a lot of flavor.\\n\\nAlong with our meals the server brought some warm cornbread, which was really moist and sweet YUM!  And although the restaurant was packed, and our food was taking a bit of time to prepare the server was super attentive, and kept bringing us drinks and cornbread.\\n\\nAnother thing you must try is their desserts!  On our visit I tried their red velvet cake which was cream-cheese-a-licious! And my hubby and room-mate both got the yellow cake with chocolate frosting...it tasted like Betty Crocker, but there's nothing wrong with that... especially when the price was so great!\\n\\nThis place gets a four star review because of the professionalism of the server, sheer quantity of food for under ten bucks (seriously, I didn't have to cook the next day for anyone in the house), and the endless combinations you could make.  Also, the fact that they had ox tails on the menu...yum.  You just don't see that ANYWHERE, except at my mother's house (we're Cuban by the way...90 miles south of the southern most part of the US)!\\n\\n**One thing I find funny is that as I check out their website today, the flash video has pictures of wine bottles and wine glasses...This restaurant is owned by the church next door, and does NOT serve alcohol (including wine) so don't be mislead!  The flash video also has a few pics of the interior of the restaurant...I don't remember the place looking anything like this, so I think the flash video is a template...lol  I might update this review if I find out differently as I am meeting some friends there for lunch tommorow!  But as far as the decor is concerned, the restaurant has a few tables and quite a few high backed comfy boothes.  The walls are painted a sunny yellow, and everything looks brand-new/clean, but very plain and generic (the opposite of the food).  \\n\\n*Also, be aware that you have to pay at the cash register up front, which does accept credit cards, and there is also a take out portion of the restaurant that is completely closed off from the rest of the dining room, you wouldn't even know it existed unless you spotted it from outside  :)"},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This bbq joint knows how to really get down.

Definitely did not live up to the hype of reviews/Zagat rating. Pros: Inexpensive, large portions. Cons: Uncomfortably small and hot, food was just meh. It's tiny, which isn't a problem if it's a spectacular place, which it isn't. Went in early August at 7 PM and the open-air infrastructure made it uncomfortably hot inside when a breeze wasn't coming through. We were seated 6 inches from the next table, which is not extremely uncommon at restaurants in this neighborhood but it had better be goooood to be worth it. My husband had a much-anticipated zucchini floweret appetizer, which we'd had in Italy and hadn't seen on a US menu since. Instead of it being light, delicate and baked, it tasted like deep fried cream cheese stuffed zucchini. Really heavy and greasy. I had the marinated veggies, which were a huge plate but again, felt greasy and heavy on the oil. No impressive flavor whatsoever. I liked that they incorporated olives, though. Our main courses were similar in quality. Unimpressive pasta. They say all pasta is made on site, but I wouldn't have known. Over cooked, bland sauces. My shrimp was well-prepared along with the asparagus, but the sauce was virtually tasteless on the night's special dish. My husband was excited for the cheese and prosciutto-stuffed veal, which he said was tough. It was served on a bed of fettuccine with red sauce that may as well have been Prego. Again, not bad, just not impressive. Even the bread was just ... ordinary. We ate at Guilia's in Cambridge a few night earlier and left raving about everything. Try there if you're looking for great Italian."},{"name":"Ron's Restaurant","address":"8869 SE 82nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"I have been to Ron's restaurant a few times, and have always a great experience.  I find the wait staff are always attentive even when busy.  They are also very conversational when given the opportunity to do so.  Regardless of the topic of conversation, if you need someone to gently reassure you why your life is full of regret and shame, they are up for the job!!!! Or if you need to share about the pitiful events of last night, which consisted of copious amounts of cheap vodka, unforgivable stupidity, crying uncontrollably because you have \\"connected\\" to the song Outside by Stained by listening to it for 3 hours consecutively, and finally projectile vomiting all over your kitchen counter due to borderline alcohol poisoning.  They will always non judgmental toward your failures as a human being, because they probably don't care, and neither do you.  This is just my assumptions though, I just order my food, and stare at wall blankly, because I'm pretty sure my personality disintegrates day by day, although there is a good possibility I was never born with one.\\n\\nThe food is delicious, and they like to place an emphasis on breakfast, which Is arguably the most important meal of the day, but lunch is pretty badass too.  Very vegetarian friendly as well.\\n\\nI believe this place first opened in 1986, which is the same year that the band Poison released the song \\"talk dirty to me\\".  So needless to say this business's interior decoration is a little on the \\"we don't give a shit\\" side.  I don't think this should discount any stars though, this place is a restaurant, not the fucking Louve museum.  From being open for that long this place has probably seen some shit.\\n\\nI've noticed that a lot of elderly people like to eat here. It's probably because they must offer some type of senior discount.  I group senior citizens into two types of people.  The first group is generally nice, understanding, insightful, and well educated, but occasionally odorous.  These types of people handout life advice like skittles, and chances are you probably fucking need it.\\n\\nYOUNGER ADULT: I feel like I lack the motivation to be a productive member of society.  I'm 36 years old, and still live in my mother's basement, I have very poor work ethic, have very little, almost no relevant life experience, I am very poorly educated, I struggle deeply with grasping the basics of common sense,  I also have no respect for others around, and generally fear and hate things I A. Can't do and B. Don't understand.  I also blame everybody else, but my self for all of this.  I am in desperate need of life advice from an older person to possibly begin to rectify this shitshow of a life I have created for myself.  However, chances are I won't be able to absorb any information you pass down to me because my unfathomable stupidity.\\n\\nSENIOR CITIZEN:  Well shit, I don't know what to tell you at this point.  I would tell you to pull yourself up by the boot straps but, you are 36 years old and can't even tie your own fucking shoes.  It's a god damn shame, that I put in years of military of service, and over 45 years in a blue collar industry to create a ridged backbone for this country, only to have it quickly destroyed by a younger generation that can only be described malignant philistines.  \\n\\nChances are their reply is going to be a lot more eloquent, and without all the profanity.  The 2nd group of senior citizens are generally really bitter, and stupid.  It's amazing they have lived to such an old age.  Generally they are the type of people that stumble through life destroying every meaningful relationship before they begin to form, only to leave a trail of emptiness and loneliness in their wake, but chances are they are too dead inside to feel anything but apathy and confusion.\\n\\nAt this point, if you have read this review to this point, which I doubt you have, good for you I really don't care.

As an unabashed sandwich fiend I feel I can say with some confidence: it wasn't good. \\n\\nTo elaborate: I had \\"The Benny\\" and my partner had the \\"Elephants Walking on Eggs.\\" Both sandwiches were created by more than competent chefs, so what was lost in translation I can't say. Mine was described as having a spice-rubbed grilled chicken, though boiled chicken breast served cold would have been more accurate. The only flavor came from the mayonnaise (good if you like mayo, but since when should mayo carry a sandwich?). The other sandwich was essentially a plain omelet on a baguette with a sad-looking side salad. \\n\\nThis was made less forgivable because sandwiches were expensive, $12-13. On the upside they were big. Really big. So, you might not like your sandwich very much but at least you can eat a lot of it! That's better, right? \\n\\nThough I'm not one for conspiracy theories I'm increasingly convinced that all Newbury/Boylston St. restaurants share one very boring underground kitchen.

OK, so it's not much for atmosphere and ambiance, and it is a little hard to find, but this is definitely a place to come for wonderfully prepared German food. The big attraction is a nice assortment of schnitzels and their extremely tasty dill pickle soup.  Tonight, our waiter described to us their four \\"specials of the day\\" and they sounded really tempting.  My friend and I decided to each have one of their specials which included a cup of the soup.  My special was Swiss style chicken with Swiss cheese fondue sauce on top, spaetzle, carrots and spinach.  The breaded chicken breast was tender and grilled perfectly, and the spaetzle was tasty with a good texture.  Totally delicious!  My friend's special was a combination of half of a pork weinerschnitzel and a grilled bratwurst with spaetzle, sauerkraut and carrots.  She thought it was perfection.  Oh yeah, another big attraction here is their fabulous housemade desserts which includes several types of cakes and strudels.  Since we were so impressed with the specials of the day for dinner, I got their special DESSERT of the day which was a slice of strawberry tart made with fresh strawberries and whipped cream.  \\n\\nWow, Otto & Anita's was terrific from the soup in the beginning, through the entrees, to the great dessert at the end. . .and all for a very reasonable price.

If you're hungry at all, maybe order two burgers, as they're kind of small (maybe 4 oz each). Everything is well executed, however - I last went with a group of ten or so people and we all liked what we got, and a few of the diners are generally pretty picky. The food is very reasonably priced, even with a-la-carte sides. I sampled each of four burgers - veggie, lamb, something with bbq sauce, and the butcher burger. Their ketchup is good, and I normally don't care for ketchup as a condiment. They have a few twists on mayo that are good too.

We had been talking this place up for years and how good it would be, yet we were shocked by the turn out. The menu had plenty of options most ranging in the $13-$20 range. Since price is never our main concern, it made the most sense to pay a few extra bucks for the buffet in order to sample all of the options they had. Unfortunately, the choices were quite limited. Most of us guys enjoy sausages grilled with nice char marks, however their meat selection was all boiled and lacked taste. Our group expected the Bhama Mama to have a lot of spices and heat behind it, but we found the meat to be bland and comparable to all of the other selections. As for sides, the buffet had a few limited options but mostly you are buying it for a few links of boiled sausage. \\n\\n3.) Dessert and Beer- Beer selection is different but pricey. Selections come in large sizes, which is great, but overall the beer could be much better. Dessert is all about the cream puffs. They are large and good, but NOT GREAT.

I think the main reason I can't give it a 5 is that it lacked that intangible 5-star restaurant feeling that overcomes you as you leave, the When-can-I-come-back-because-this-place-is-so-amazing feeling. I didn't get that Orinoco. I get the feeling some people get that, but I didn't. I think if the restaurant were quieter and maybe the seating a little cozier (I heard everything the people on either side of me were saying, even the conversation about S&M), I may have felt that."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"A different kind of donut...\\n\\nThis review is for those not in the know- mainly out-of-towners.

I enjoyed everything about it - from the intimate ambiance, to the communal seating, to the farm to market fare.  Barley Swine is everything you want in a dining experience.\\n\\nWe decided to go to Barley Swine after work on a Friday.  They don't take reservations, but we thought if we got there at 6:30 (they open at 6:00) we would still be able to beat the crowd.  What we didn't realize is how small the restaurant actually is.  There is only seating for about 45 or 50 people at a time.   When we arrived at 6:30, there was an hour and a half wait, which was disappointing, but the hostess offered that she could call us when our table was ready, so we were able to grab a drink at the many local establishments within walking distance (Horseshoe Lounge, La Feria, etc).  In the end we only waited an hour, which was a pleasant surprise.  That being said, if you go to Barley Swine, expect a wait, but know that it is well worth it.\\n\\nOnce seated, the waitstaff was extremely knowledgeable - I was amazed at how they could recite every single dish with such precision, even though there were sometimes over 10 ingredients in a dish.  Our waitress was also very helpful in making recommendations, both for drinks and food.  \\n\\nThe menu is not very extensive, but don't be fooled!  The menu suggests to order 3 dishes per person and I would definitely agree.  At the suggestion of our waitress, we ordered one of everything on the menu between our party of 4.  We were able to get a good taste of everything on the menu and definitely left feeling full.  The chef's at Barley Swine somehow have the ability to make food that I would normally snub (beets, scrambled eggs, pork belly) feel sexy.  Some of our standout favorites were the spiced goat, cauliflower, lime, green garlic and Scallops, brussel sprouts, peanut, grapefruit.  The desserts are not to be missed also.  \\n\\nThe food at Barley Swine was wonderful and the dining experience was even better.

Not the best ever, but good with the perfect amount of spice and also strong...  Two of us had the Elephant Walking on Eggs sandwich, which was very good - sort of like an omelette with goat cheese on a fresh, slightly crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside French baguette.  Very filling.  This was the closest thing to breakfast on the menu.  It's a lunch place.

It's around $4 but you can get 2 extra tortillas and make 3 out of it.  Think the Don Juan but not full of starchy potatoes and more ingredients.  I know the owners are from NOLA and I want to try their food but haven't as of yet.  They do have a great beer selection on draft and pretty reasonable prices to match.  I think they even have a happy hour too.  Also, do yourself a favor and try to Cuban con leche.  That was easily one of the best coffees I've ever had in my life.

If you like chicken and waffles you will like the fried chicken doughnut.  It is sweet, salty and has a little kick (if you add some of the Frank's hot sauce they provide).  The Meyer lemon was a solid doughnut with the filling being closer to creamy than the standard lemon jelly.  I also got to try a taste of the glaze that they used on the blueberry, bourbon basil doughnut and it was awesome.  I will try that one later.\\n\\nThe dough really excels this place as a bakery which is based on a brioche dough.  It is a little eggy but is also light and airy.  The texture almost reminds me more of French pastries than donuts.  Which is probably why I can justify paying more than I would have originally thought a doughnut should cost.  I read a review that said that a dozen of these doughnuts would be around $30, but unless you are trying to really impress a group I don't see this as a standard stop to buy in bulk.  Though if you do that often I would like to be your friend.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is pleasant with tile and stainless steel this is a very open feeling bakery.

The store is small but has a really cute aesthetic. There were only a few people in the store since it was a weekday lunch, so no wait! I had heard that some of their flavors were really good so I was excited to try them out. I picked the blueberry bourbon basil and passion fruit cacao nib based on what other friends who had visited Portland recommended to me. I asked the cashier about other popular flavors and he said the lemon poppyseed and orange olive oil. While I was debating whether or not to get a third donut, he was kind enough to say he'd throw in the third one for free. So nice!! I chose the orange olive oil one. These gourmet donuts aren't cheap but are beautiful-looking and delicious. My friend shared with me the creme br√ªl√©e donut, which is the most decadent but delectable donut I have ever had. Totally lives up to the hype!!"},{"name":"Phara's Mediterranean Cuisine","address":"111 E North Loop Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"What? These types of places exist?  As a non-native Austin-person, I'm just amazed by how creative and cool owners can make their restaurants.  I came with a friend and the decor and atmosphere on the inside was exceptional. The ceiling had cool small lights and despite it generally being a Mediterranean restaurant; they had a lot of Egyptian-type art with Pharaoh's and other hieroglyphic-type things hanging on the walls.   The inside was actually relatively quiet and gave it a cool/chill ambiance with the lower lighting to enjoy your meal.  \\n\\nThe food was good; I'd give this part the 4/5.  The appetizer sampler is a good way to get all the different things if you enjoy all of hummus, baba ganoush, grape leaves and Tatziki sauce/yogurt.  They provide you rolled up thin-pita to have it with these items.  For the meal, if you're into tasty food; definitely get the Lazeez-versions of the meat as they cook it in this well-seasoned, mildly spicy tomato-like sauce in which they've placed multiple other spices.  My friend got the regular version of the meat (the chicken kebaab) and it was good, but not exceptional.  The lamb lazeez was definitely my favorite dish.  In both of these dishes, however, there seemed to be too much Tatziki sauce for the amount of rice/meat that they were giving; I didn't end up finishing my sauce; but the rice was a great complement to soak up the Lazeez-sauce.  At 8 o'clock, the belly dancer came out who didn't do as much belly dancing as she did ass-shaking; but whatever; it was amusing none-the-less.  Would definitely come back here again!!"},{"name":"Sea Level Oyster Bar","address":"94 Wharf St","city":"Salem","stars":"4","text":"Went here for lunch over Memorial Day weekend.

A greasy spoon/pizza/gyros joint that serves scary egg sandwiches is not in the running). \\n\\nWe have had two breakfasts so far and both have been fantastic.\\nThe fresh squeezed juice comes in a glass so big it seems big enough for two.  And a bargain at only $3.00.\\n\\nI have so far had an organic cheese (with mushrooms added per my request) omelette and the next day the mediterranean (feta, spinach, mushrooms and something else I can't remember...maybe tomato?) and both were fabulous.   The toast was perfect and the potatoes were delicious with just the right amount of onion and pepper to give some flavor without overwhelming.  My husband got the breakfast burrito one day and a veggie scramble the next and he was pleased with both.  \\n\\nThe coffee came in massive cafe mugs and was really spectacular.  \\n\\nThe second time in, we ordered a short stack of pancakes as an extra to share in addition to our egg entrees.  It was two massive pancakes that we barely got more than a few bites into.  Their pancakes are whole wheat and pretty thick - very hearty.  If you are looking for thin, pasty tasteless flour (think Denny's) pancakes do not go for these.  They are hearty enough for a lumberjack.\\n\\nTo sum up:  Rafiki is so very welcome in this neighborhood for breakfast options!  Their coffee bar makes it easy to order fast for a breakfast sandwich or scone and having lots of tables to sit down and eat a real breakfast is heaven for the locals.  I can't wait to come back to try a lunch or dinner.\\n\\nIf you are looking for something simpler like just a scrambled or fried egg that comes with the usual (home fries and toast) the prices just can't be beat.  I think a 1 egg breakfast is $2.50,  2 eggs $3.25, and 3 eggs $3.90.  \\n\\nNext time back, I will try the french toast.\\n\\nOnly thing I wish they would consider is having some kind of veggie sausage like a morningstar farm breakfast \\"sausage pattie\\" product.  Those things nuke up fast and take up little space in a freezer.   If they are truly committed to  conscientious consumption habits and vegetarian/organic menu selections, they will make that a part of the breakfast options and we will always go back!\\n\\nWelcome to the neighborhood Rafiki!"},{"name":"Phoebe's Diner","address":"533 W Oltorf St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Phoebe's Diner is such a great spot for breakfast and brunch!

Even before I moved to Atlanta, I knew FLIP existed because I'm a huge Richard Blais fan. \\n\\nWe finally stopped in last night for our first real experience at FLIP. We'd been there twice before- once for a quick pumpkin milkshake, another to try for dinner but it was a 1.5 hr wait. No thanks!\\n\\nA quick call to FLIP beforehand let us know there'd be no wait for our party of 2, but that doesn't mean they aren't busy! We did get immediately seated at the bar that sits in front of the kitchen pass. It was really fun and entertaining to see the masterpieces be created.\\n\\nAside from the fun experience, there wasn't much to the food itself. If you just like a normal burger you'll feel really stupid here. Each burger has a unique twist- whether it be a non-beef patty, interesting toppings, or it just looks pretty. As a burger connoisseur, I struggled to find something familiar. The best I could find was a bacon cheeseburger, that I ordered medium.\\n\\nThe burger was definitely medium-rare, but it wasn't that big of a deal. I just didn't think it was that great. The patty was tasty, but I didn't care for the FLIP sauce. I couldn't taste the bacon and the cheese was barely melted and looked like a Kraft single. I've definitely had a better burger at Taco Mac. \\n\\nNow before you get all pissed off, I think my issue with this place is that I don't like the gourmet burger concept. If you are a burger person, you just need to know this place is gourmet first, burger second. \\n\\nI also ordered the vodka-battered onion rings. They had a perfect, light crispiness to them and the onion didn't pull out when I took a bite. But they were so bland!! I mean, almost no flavor. I felt stupid requesting ketchup to go with it.\\n\\nService wasn't the best. It took a while for our server to make her way to greet us and then another 5-10mins for a coke. The burgers do come out FAST though, especially if there's no one else waiting for a burger before you (the people next to us must have gotten their burgers 5 minutes after they ordered!). They turn the tables quick making this a super-fast experience.\\n\\nI wasn't a fan of the atmosphere either. Weird music + tons of people = really loud!! It's certainly a place to be seen and feel cool, but it's just not my style.\\n\\nWe got away spending $30 for 2. There are lots of other places where I'd get a better burger for less.

We never saw a manager, an owner or even the person responsible for making or decorating the cake.  We were told that our design picture was no problem for a cake topper, but when it came to put the designs we wanted on the sides of the tiers, they were completely incompetent and couldn't even figure out how to get the right size for the design we were providing electronically.  It was awful.  They were very disorganized, and several times we were left to wait for long periods while they went off to do some task or other.  My wife and I were embarrassed for them.  Incidentally, although we put down a deposit, we plan to return tomorrow for a refund of our 1/2 down and will pay a $25.00 cancellation fee which was never discussed, but is in the contract.

The menu is always changing, so I will just say get the tasting menu and take that culinary joyride, because it's worth every single penny. We've done it with and without the wine pairing and it's spectacular either way. If you're feeling extra hungry or just in for a small bite and want to order of the regular menu, I always recommend the pig face carnitas, snapper ceviche, and whatever dumplings they have on the menu....literally all of it gets in your mouth and you start to do one of those involuntary happy food dances in your chair. Yeah, this place isn't cheap but it's also one you won't forget. I've spent the same in third-rate restaurants in Austin and felt deeply disappointed but Barley Swine is one I never regret! If you're on a budget, go during their Happy hour (5-6:30) and get half price bottles of wine and a few things that are almost fast-food prices and you've got zero excuses. What makes a 5-star place for me is the food first and foremost, but having excellent drinks, service, and ambiance takes it to that next level and they're all here! Every server we've had there is as passionate about great food as we are and everything on the drink menu has been stunning and as complex and flavorful as the menu. My only complaint? WHY haven't they re-opened a location in South Austin?

To me, each pizza place should be unique in taste, which is why La Mamma has become my delivered pizza of choice in Allston. Any good pizza restaurant should be rated according to overall quality, variety of toppings, price, delivery hours, speed, and fee, and, seeing that I'm from the Midwest, friendly drivers! I just wish La Mamma offered rewards for loyal customers; I would certainly fit the bill.\\n\\nOverall Quality. It's simply melt-in-your-mouth good. The sauce, the cheese, and the crust all arrive fresh and hot. And, more importantly, the taste is consistent. When I order from La Mamma, I know exactly what's coming my way. They simply don't have \\"off\\" nights.\\n\\nVariety of Toppings. Since moving up to Boston, I've discovered my new love, and her name is Ricotta. I get ricotta on each and every pizza from La Mamma. One, they absolutely don't hold back (see my picture) and two, it's delicious plain or with meatballs or with egg plant. Each combination adds a new layer of satisfaction and utter mouth-stuffing bliss.\\n\\nPrice. It's cheap. Like, really cheap for Boston. A large 16\\" cheese pizza starts at $9.00, and the ricotta is only $2.00 more. An $11.00 pizza that tastes this good? I'm still trying to figure out how they get away with it, but hey, I'm not complaining!\\n\\nDelivery Hours, Speed, and Fee. I wish La Mamma would extend their hours to 2AM, but I guess that's my incentive to stop drinking earlier and get my order in by 1AM! I've always ordered through Grubhub.com, and even during peak delivery hours on weekends, La Mamma always beats the delivery time estimate, usually between 30-40 minutes. And, delivery is FREE, so tip your driver extra generously.\\n\\nFriendly Drivers. Many people may not care as much about this or simply overlook it, but I do not. I've had drivers from other restaurants practically throw my order into my hands and sprint away, without any \\"thank you\\" or \\"have a good night.\\" Not at La Mamma, though. Every driver has greeted me with a smile, thanked me for my order, and wished me a good night. Considering I am often one of their last deliveries (I'm keeping them working longer), I truly appreciate this.\\n\\nOther than the above, it should also be noted that drinking beer makes me crave pizza. Seeing that I heart beer (Sam Adams, you just get me), I've ordered from La Mamma at rather questionable hours at least 15 times. I like to think of eating pizza as my tried-and-true hangover cure. La Mamma, my head and stomach thank you for existing."},{"name":"Buffet Palace","address":"4608 West Gate Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This please is the best buffet I have ever eaten at.

They changed the prices just by pasting papers/stickers over their old prices on the board so I find it kinda tacky.  Not sure if this has changed since my last visit though.

They've done a real good job cultivating the kind of place where you want to stay hang out even after your works done.

To survive in this area, you've got to live up to some expensive tastes, and since its opening, it's gotten some good reviews by food critics.\\n\\nThe tipping point was when my boyfriend tried out their latest food & beer pairing event, and said that all the food was good, even though it had coconut in it (he can't stand it, unfortunately missing out on most of the great Thai food that coconut has to offer).\\n\\nWe started off with the Hot & Sour Soup with sablefish & turmeric ($16 for 2 people) to ward off Leo's cold. The soup was enough for us 3. We were warned not to eat the hot pepper, which Leo actually did at the beer pairing event. So do not do! The little pepper flakes kept hitting the back of my throat in a choky way, but other than that, the soup was an awesome blend of hot, sour, and sweet. The sablefish was nice and tender, and despite the strong herb that was in there (dill?) it was a nice blend of Thai flavours, and even served in the traditional metal bowl.\\n\\nWe shared a plate of vegetarian Pad Thai ($13), which I'm glad they had on the menu. You can't have a Thai restaurant without Pad Thai. This is one of the best Pad Thai dishes I've ever tasted, though when I kept eating and eating, I realized that it's because they mixed traditional pad thai flavours with something new that I can't put my tastebuds on. All the ingredients listed on the menu are what's usually included, but I'm sure they added some secret ingredients to remix it.\\n\\nI went for the vegetarian version of the mussaman curry ($17) which is usually served with a lamb leg.  This is not the typical red or green curry - reddish brown in colour and perfect on top of white rice, it was good, but not the curry I'm used to, so I might try something else instead of this next time. Would have been very nice with eggplant, which I usually like in my curries.\\n\\nI would have loved to eat some dessert to sweet up our spiced palates too, but we were just too full, and even had enough pad thai for brunch the next day.\\n\\nPeople looking for the fast Thai food service might find this place too expensive compared to the hole-in-the-wall type places that you can find in our city via word of mouth, but for the Kits environment and to try a modern twist on traditional Thai cooking, Maenam is your best bet. Make sure to make resos on weekends, and take advantage of their full bar - they have a nice cocktail, wine and beer list too."},{"name":"The Cowfish - Atlanta","address":"4400 Ashford Dunwoody Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The Cowfish is actually much better than I expected.

It took about 30 minutes for our food to come out, and when it did, the manager was the one bringing it out. He made sure there were no cucumbers in my lunch and substituted the side with cut apples.\\n\\nFor how the food tasted, it was great. The Philly roll from my bento was fresh and well-made. The mini burger that comes with the bento was pretty pink throughout the meat. It was most likely undercooked. The sweet potato fries were nice and crunchy and tasted great with soy sauce as a dip. The cut apples were nice and sweet, but I ended up not eating them all when I found a dead gnat floating under the bottom apple slices. The edamame were basic and were salted.\\n\\nThe service... was very slow. We waited 45 minutes for our server to refill our drinks and he only passed by our table to check a few times overall.

I had the tagines breakfeast, of which I scooped up every last drip of goo from the platter with the foccacia.  I generally think breakfast dishes are easy to make, but incredibly difficult to excel at, which this did in abundance.\\n\\nThe taste in that dish - though savoury and strong - had delicate nuances that can only come from using fresh real incredients and making it by hand (I don't know the sourcing of the murguez sausage in the dish, but it as well has flavor nuances lacking in high-volume factory made stuff). \\n\\nService was fine but I wouldn't care if it wasn't because the food was that good.  When I'm in town over the breakfast hour again I'll be back.  I travel the conitnent and have a hard time finding breakfasts that good.

We arrived at the restaurant at 6:00PM when the doors opened (highly recommended) and made first seating with no waiting.\\n\\nThe food presentation is small plate so if your measure of a good meal is how much food the arrives in your entr√©e, you'd be better off going to your favorite $9.99 all-you-can-eat buffet.  However, if you want to experience exquisitely prepared dishes - each an amazing collection of tastes, then you are at the right place!  \\n\\nThe menu sports roughly twelve items - just enough that a group of four or (as in our case) a motivated party of two can try each item on the menu.\\n\\nWe elected to sit at the bar so we could watch the activity in the kitchen.  This proved to be well worth the price of admission.   I have never seen such dedication to ensure that every plate becomes is its own picture of perfection. \\n\\nEach kitchen staff member has a specific role in the preparation of dishes which occur in menu item specific waves.  For example, all Chicken fried chicken egg, grilled sweetbreads, hay grits, mustard are prepared and served to all patrons who have ordered it.  Then the Scallops, brussel sprouts, peanut, grapefruit. Then the Wagyu brisket, coffee, barbecued beans, slaw. And so it goes...\\n\\nThe result is nicely timed servings of unforgettable food pairings which arrive at your table within seconds of preparation.  The time between plates is just long enough to exchange your \\"Oh my God that was marvelous!\\" rants with the rest of the table.\\n\\nSo, the food is amazing...what about the staff and service?\\n\\n- Front of the house - excellent - she stopped by three times to check on us and  chat us up.\\n- Barkeep - excellent - although he alone was responsible for the liquid fare of all dining patrons and all people waiting, he managed to never \\"appear\\" busy and was conversant with us throughout our meal.\\n- Wait staff - excellent - attentive and highly knowledgeable regarding the menu. Our server was always at hand whenever we needed anything.  \\n- Kitchen staff - Consummate professionals in action - If you enjoy cooking, the \\"show\\" is nearly as satisfying as the cuisine.  These guys bring 100% to the line.\\n\\nThe bottom line...\\n\\nFive stars...for originality, execution, quality and service.

As we were leaving the waiter asked how everything was and I told him just FYI my burger was raw and I showed him. I said I didn't want a discount or a new burger I was just letting him know so they can keep an eye on the cooks in the future. He apologized but then said that they \\"take rare and med rare very seriously\\" there and that that's what med rare is supposed to look like. He said that other places may serve it pink instead of cold/red and they're giving you incorrectly cooked burgers. In other words, they are right and I am wrong. Or ignorant of what a properly med rare burger is. One of the two. I said if you look at this, it's raw, and showed him a particularly raw piece. He reiterated that I just didn't realize what med rare is. Ok, whatever. He gave me a chip for $5 off next time. \\n\\nAnyway, the parts of my burger that were cooked were okay.

The giant pile of smoky chicken was in no small part what inspired me to visit their location in the Pearl. I think what I like most about Verde Cocina is their commitment to offering vegetation as a supplement, substitute, or simply the substance of each and every dish, according to each diner's dietary preferences. In other words, the lines between vegetarian, pescetarian, omnivore and carnivore are appropriately blurred here, without any gimmicky compulsion to state so explicitly.

I settled on the fritto misto for appetizer, and then a mixed green salad, followed by a steak with asparagus. Instead of the potatoes that were served with the steak, I opted to substitute the risotto.\\n\\nThe fritto misto was a delight! Batter fried seafood, like shrimp, and calamari were perfectly fried and accompanied by a red sauce, which I did not try, and an aioli, which was wonderful. The salad, on the other hand, was sort of meh - nothing special, but not bad. Thus far, the service had been adequate, and equal to the task of recommending and suggesting ways to navigate the menu for my dinner.\\n\\nHowever, when my entree came out, I had asked to substitute the risotto for the potatoes. It had been ages since I've had a decent risotto. When the server brought my steak out I found it to be delicious, perfectly cooked to the temperature I had ordered, medium-rare, and the asparagus were perfectly cooked. However I noticed that the substitution I had asked for had not been made by the kitchen. I am not sure whether this was the fault of server negligence, or kitchen negligence. Either way however it was not what I had ordered. When I questioned the server, she immediately went back to the kitchen to correct the mistake. Understandably, it took a while for the risotto to come out of the kitchen. However when it was served, it was very starchy and not very appetizing. I took a few bites and gave up.\\n\\nI finished up with a fresh peach crostata with a dollop of vanilla gelato on top. And, of course, coffee.  The coffee was good, fresh, and strong. The crostata was also quite good.\\n\\nAll in all, the dinner wasn't a complete disaster. In fact, except for the misstep with not substituting the risotto for the potatoes with my aunt Ray comma it was quite good.

I also enjoy that you can get the waffle fries, which area seasoned (my boyfriend calls them \\"criss-cross fries\\").

Now onto the whole reason we went to eat at this restaurant.... The Paella, it was basically chicken and rice. Small portion for two at the price of 40 dollars it was served in a small frying pan. There was hardly any seafood in my seafood paella. 4 prawns, and a couple of pieces of shrimp and calamari. The taste was good, but it was not a paella it was chicken and rice. My boyfriend ended up adding the remaining pieces of our seafood from the appetizer to the paella. It was pricey, and we left disappointed. The ambiance and decor is very nice, as well as the staff but I would not recommend eating here if you want a decent meal.

Still can't make up for these wings though. I've never ordered or seen anything like this before. They really need to use a different brand. I probably should have asked for it to be comped off my bill but it's an airport bar after all so I was managing my expectations. It's my own fault for being hungry at lunchtime, I suppose.

Not to mention they have King Car Iced Tea!  For those from Guam, you know what that means!\\n\\nI really enjoyed the BBQ chicken.  For those unfamiliar with Chamorro food, they may try to compare it to teriyaki or southern BBQ which would not be an appropriate comparison. It is a bit sweet, tangy, and spicy perhaps due to its soy sauce base, other secret ingredients and open fire BBQing.  All those flavors make for a vey delious chicken.\\n\\nThe coconut vegetables side was very delicous and added a bit of contrast to the BBQ chicken and red rice.  \\n\\nThe tatiya was great.  In the past, the tatiya I have had was heavy and very, very sweet - more of a desert.  I don't know what Ed does but the tatiya was light and finished sweet.\\n\\nThe lumpia was cooked fresh which made it delicously hot and crispy.\\n\\nThe red rice was okay.  It was a plus that it wasn't greesy, which red rice usually is because of the fact that it is cooked with bacon and/or butter which lends to red rice's unique taste, but it lacked that taste that differentiated red rice from white rice.\\n\\nOverall, the experience was great!

It was also a bit more expensive than other indian places I've been to, not much, but enough that I noticed. \\n\\nIt was a nice enough looking place and the staff were friendly to me and gave me water while I waited for my food.

One of them is the North End. When I was in Boston, there were a couple of times when I followed the red brick road better known as Boston's Freedom Trail to see the North End. \\n\\n  Just like many of the fascinating neighborhoods and points of interest that make Boston a first rate city, the North End is full of interesting facts. Established in the 1630s, it is Boston's continuous oldest residential community. The North End is the Little Italy of Boston featuring the City's best bakeries, Italian restaurants, pizzerias, and coffee shops. \\n\\n   When I met up with the Freedom Trail in the North End, I caught it from Commercial Street at the northwest corner of the district, then followed it south toward the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway where we got off the red brick road and explored the cobblestone streets and thoroughfares of the neighborhood. When we stepped on the Freedom Trail in the north side of the district, we were on the hilly part where Copp's Hill Burying Ground overlooks the water. Walking east of it, the trail headed down a hill where we met up with the Old North Hill. As the topography flattened out the historical sites rose. The further east and south we walked we passed one historic landmark after the other. After the Old North Church there was the Prado/Paul Revere Mall, then there was St. Stephen's Catholic Church, the Paul Revere House where Paul Revere said the famous words \\"The British are coming,\\" North Square, the Moses Pierce Hitchcorn House which is the oldest brick townhouse in New England (Wikipedia), and the historic brick storefronts lining the two commercial streets Hanover and Salem. \\n\\n   As a student of urban planning the red brick road did lead me to Oz. The 0.36 square mile district bounded by Commercial Street and the Charles River to the north, Atlantic Avenue and the harbor to the east, the Rose Kennedy Greenway to the South, and Washington Street to the west was a sensory overload of historical architecture, city planning, and restaurants. I enjoyed exploring the pedestrian friendly streets that give the pedestrian precedence over the car. There is only one signalized intersection which is the crossroads of Hanover at Parmentar in the south area of the district. My favorite experience was following the narrow cobblestone streets bordered by Victorian lamp posts, red brick tenement buildings dating back to British rule to one of the most famous Boston pizzarias: Regina's. When I explored Boston's Little Italy I felt that I was in a city within a City. Away from the quiet narrow streets, I explored the jumping Hanover Street peeking into the windowfronts of art galleries, coffee shops, Italian delis, pastry shops, a gelato shop, offices, bars, and the occasional chain store. The southbound walks on Hanover and Salem Streets took in the Boston skyline across the Greenway. \\n\\n   The North End of today is a different one from the 1950s to the early 2000s. The removal of the elevated I-93 expressway has had marvelous effects on its connectivity to the downtown. In the pre Big Dig Boston there was an ugly elevated expressway that separated it from the downtown. In the post Big Dig Boston, you can get on the Freedom Trail cut through the Greenway then end up in the Haymarket Farmers Market and Government Center. In our case we picked up a cup of Peet's Coffee that we drank in the adjacent Greenway. The Greenway has also added much needed parkland in the built up North End. \\n\\n  The North End is one more reason that Boston is great. No matter where you follow the red brick road in Boston it will lead to experiences and adventures paved with gold. \\n\\nReviewer's note: I will soon be reviewing the points of interests and places that I visited in the North End."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Went here for the first time today to celebrate my husband's bd.

The many Yelp reviews it had showed it to be a really good place for a meal.  Unfortunately, it fell short of the hype with lackluster and frankly boring entrees.  The restaurant has a rustic atmosphere, which I liked.  However I found the room to be a bit too hot.  I was not sweating, but it was a bit uncomfortable.  The staff were friendly and did not rush my table at all, which was a definite plus.  Portions were generous, tapas were larger than I expected and not one of us finished our dishes.  This may have been because, in part, no one really enjoyed their dinner.  I had the lasagna, and while it wasn't bad, it just wasn't very good.  My brother had spaghetti and meatballs and we all agreed that the meatballs were rubbery and bland.  To top it off, this was our most expensive meal in Colorado yet, and our least favorite.

On my trip to Vancouver last year for my birthday my friend and I decided to grab brunch. Thank goodness for Yelp. Started browsing around for brunch spots nearby our hotel and came across Cafe Medina. As soon as I saw WAFFLES I knew immediately I had to try it out.\\n\\nThe Cafe was fairly close to our hotel, The Four Seasons. Within walking distance and plenty of sights to see on the way over. The place can easily be missed seeing as how it's a pretty low key small joint on a non-busy street. \\n\\nWe got there around 11 and the place was packed. Then again, there weren't many tables or stools in the first place. Although it was packed like a sardine can, we were still seated promptly after entering the establishment.\\n\\nThe menu is super simple. Waffles, drinks, and maybe a handful of entree options. Because it's so simple it makes it easy to narrow down what you want. Honestly I prefer this over a menu that offers everything AND the kitchen sink :p\\n\\nWe ordered the Paella and two waffles (should have ordered more waffles now that I think of it). The paella was delicious and flavourful. It came with a baked egg, chorizo, orzo (I think it was orzo) roased vegis, and avocado. It was really a good mix of flavours and textures. The orzo/rice was nicely cooked. It made for a good bed for all the roasted corn, peppers, and water cress which gave a nice crunch to the dish. The avocado also makes a great addition to this dish by adding a soft, cool, creamy texture to balance out the \\"crunch.\\" Lastly add the chorizo and you get a syphmony of amazing flavour combinations in your mouth.\\n\\nOn to the waffles. Now I would like to consider myself a waffle connoisseur (okay maybe just a fanatic) but seriously I've tried waffles everywhere I've gone. So you could only imagine my excitement when I saw waffles on this menu. The type of waffle they serve at Cafe Medina is a Li√®ge Waffle. A sweeter waffle used mostly for desserts or sweet treats. I personally love the li√®ge waffle because for me the crunchy sweet exterior with pillowy soft interior is a dream come true lol. We topped off our waffles with a mixed berry compote. It was sweet but not too sweet since the waffles are already slightly on the sweet side. No syrup needed. Seriously super delicious. \\n\\nAs much as I wanted to give this place a 5 star review the service was a bit lacking and rude at times :[ Had to ask several times to get our drinks refilled and when they came to give us the check they slammed it onto our table. Not cool. Not cool at all.\\n\\nOverall food was GREAT service not so much. If you're near by or vacationing it's well worth a try.

Since we had the food delivered and did not go inside, my review is only based on the quality of food and not the service or the restaurant atmosphere itself. \\nI ordered the Sunshine Salad, which had grilled chicken, strawberries, feta cheese, avocado, pecans, and a strawberry vinaigrette dressing with a side of garlic flatbread. All I can say is that salad is clearly not this location's forte.. The chicken strips were so dry that when I opened the box I thought that they had put french fries on top of my salad instead of chicken, and the taste was not much better. The avocado was also clearly not fresh and the discoloration and almost pickled taste they had proved as much. After picking both the chicken and avocados off, I didn't have much left to work with but it was edible. The flatbread was nothing noteworthy. \\nMy boyfriend got a the Angus Cheeseburger with fries and it was good and seemed to be prepared the way he ordered it, again nothing spectacular. The fries were seasoned well and were probably the best part out of what either of us ordered.\\nFor the price I wasn't expecting anything fantastic, but I definitely think there are better breakfast/lunch options out there for a similar cost.

Okay not to be rude or anything..what the hell is this crap?! As fillings, both flavors had whipping cream and a piece of fruit inside. Really?? At least flavor the whipping cream or something? Or maybe even a ganache? Any home baker could have easily made that-- bake some macaron shells, slap on a piece of fruit with some whipping cream and voila! You get Thierry's macarons. The texture was chewy and the outer layer was not crispy at all. I felt like I was chewing on a chunk of melted hardened sugar. The mint flavored macaron was some what \\"ok\\".

My Greek veggie crepe was accented with some added feta and mushrooms, which was a delicious addition to their melted Mozzarella cheese, tomatoes, black olive tapenade spinach and Greek yogurt sauce . The Santorini (Marinated Chicken Breast, Feta cheese, tomatoes, cucumbers, spinach, Greek yogurt sauce) and Monaco (Marinated Grilled Chicken Breast, Goat cheese, pecan nuts, dried cranberries, mixed field greens & Balsamic Glaze) were also enjoyed and proclaimed delicious. I wish we had room to share a sweet crepe, but we were full.

Whats more interesting, the bar is not interested in pretending they were not a church at one time, but have instead build their designs around that idea. \\n\\nFrom the main sanctuary, to the choir room, to the balcony that overlooks the entire bar, BoMA has a certain, interesting air about it. The place intrigued me for the different take that it had on the entire bar experience. Many art galleries that I had been to took a high culture wine and cheese approach to their showings. BoMA has forwarded this, by offering a full bar in with it.\\n\\nThe clientel that I found myself surrounded by were either the young professionals, or the young goth-types. Perhaps it was the oxymoron of drinking in church that attracted them all.\\n\\nI wasn't a big fan of BoMA, mostly for personal reasons. Furthermore, the art, I found, was on the border of urban and/or postmodern.

The bartenders provide plenty of T & A for the gentleman (or ladies) who are into that sort of thing...\\n\\nOne beer turned into four and with the help of one shot of Jameson, we were feeling good and having fun.  Though, when Pete's buddy asked for four car bombs (a shot of Baileys dropped into half a glass of Guiness and chugged quickly), we were told that they don't serve them because they are a \\"real Irish bar.\\"  Ummm...ok...whatever.  We did decide to order some apps at that point and we got the steak quesadilla and some wings... the wings were good and the quesadilla was surprisingly tasty, and quite large.  Anyways -- Double P and I went outside for a menthol treat and as we were walking out, I let the bouncer know we were heading out for a smoke and he acknowledged me and said, \\"Cool.\\"\\n\\nFive minutes later, we were walking back in when the bouncer asked to see our ids... we got them out and handed them to him, only to be told that he \\"couldn't let us back in.\\"  I kind of laughed because I thought he was joking... he wasn't.  He told us we were too intoxicated to enter the bar and that we were stumbling... I started arguing a bit and in an attempt to lighten him up, I said, \\"This is not me drunk.  I get WAY more wasted than this.\\"  He said that he had already asked us to leave once and that if we didn't go immediately, he would call the police.  The dude wouldn't even let us go in to close our tab... he had someone bring the cc slip over to us to sign.  PS it was 4:15 at this point.... we had been there just over two hours -- so I averaged two beers and half a shot per hour, plus the food.  Yeah.  Totally inebriated.\\n\\nGive me a break, Whiskey's... here is why I will never enter your establishment again... \\n\\nA. It's St. Patty's weekend.  You are going to see way worse drunks than a 30 year old married couple hanging out with other 30 year old couples.\\n\\nB. Our buddy who we met there had been drinking since 8am.  Seriously.  He set his alarm to wake up and drink.  He couldn't form sentences but he wasn't asked to leave.  Way to be accurately discerning, Bouncer.\\n\\nC. You are not a hotspot or even that cool of a place.  And, this is Boston.  I think I can find a million more Irish bars who don't call themselves \\"real Irish bars,\\" it is just understood.

The potato pancakes were good and such a unique and truly German side dish. For dessert had to try both the chocolate cream pie and the German chocolate cake. Both were very good!

I wanted to LOVE this cafe. I was drawn to it by its beautiful exterior and its rave reviews. Its just too bad, that things didn't work out between the two of us... \\n\\nFinally saw what all the fuss was about. Went here on a Tuesday and it was packed with 50-year old men marking their territories on the outside, and the inside littered with mainland china immigrants and pre-pubescent teenage girls. To all of you people who say that this place has 'great ambiance' you must be on LSD or some drug so great that it distracted your ears from picking up the annoying foreign chatter from all the tables. Or your eyes must be seeing such great images to distract from you seeing the mounds of teenage girls taking endless pictures of their macarons, then taking turns to take pictures of each other and talking about the next persons facebook status. And then there was that asian couple sitting at the table next to us who couldn't keep their hands to themselves, literally almost knocking over the table between them as they were sucking faces. This is not my idea of 'great ambiance'. A dog park has better 'ambiance'. \\n\\nDue to the fact that there was no dessert selection, I went with the e'claire and a cappucino. The e'claire was inedible. I'm no connoisseur when it comes to these things, but even an untrained tongue could tell you that they were not suppose to taste soggy. The cappuccino was the worst of the whole experience. It was so acidic and bitter, that even as one other reviewer had stated that 'half a cup of sugar wouldn't allow it to be palatable'. I'm sure fresh dirt would've tasted better. \\n\\nAnother pretentious addition to Alberni St. And to the person who says he frequents this cafe every other day: I hope you're not there to prey on the underage english-illiterate girls.\\n\\n2 Stars for the immaculate design."},{"name":"Summer Shack-  Cambridge","address":"149 Alewife Brook Pkwy","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"I wish there was a 3.5 stars, because it's a bit better than \\"just OK\\", but I'm not sure if I'm a fan either.

We went, and were surprised - in a good way that they have huge tanks to store their fresh! seafood, and in a bad way - their decor is quite, should I say, out there. It looks like a renovated factory, a family restaurant √† la TGIF, a random seafood restaurant on the highway of a in-the-middle-of-nowhere town (well, it is randomly near route 2), and semi-cutesy/sophisticated. I can't make any sense of it. It's just...odd. Also, the outside does look shady. I don't know why they chose this location.\\nWe ordered oysters, which were amazing. I've eaten oysters at several places in and around Boston, and gotta say the oysters here are only behind Neptune and East Coast Grill. The grilled clams with garlic butter sauce was really good as well - most of the clams were cooked perfectly (not chewy), and the sauce is a revelation. They had this really good butter for the bread as well (they said it was just Cabot, but they whipped and seasoned it themselves. The butter has the smell of fresh milk, which was unusual for me). \\nThen there was the crab chowder with dark rum that tasted between a chilli and a tomato soup for me, and I didn't like it at all. And the clam chowder was good, but nothing to write home about. The clam in this clam chowder was also chewy. \\nSo there you have it.

The reason Santarpio's has been in business since 1903 is that they are widely considered to make some of the best pizza in Boston.  In fact, they are a multiple time winner of Boston Magazine's Best of Boston award for traditional pizza, and they have been inducted into the Boston Hall of Fame.  Santarpio's Pizza is popular enough that they have a second location in Peabody, Massachusetts.  This location offers parking that the Easton Boston location does not, but I doubt it has the same authentic feel and can't promise the accents will be as thick there.  \\n\\nThe inside of Santarpio's in East Boston has a fair amount of seating and pictures of celebrities dining there decorate the walls.  Their menu simply consists of pizza and a few barbeque options, plus beer and wine.  They offer carryout for pizza only and do not deliver.  If you are staying by the airport, it may be an easier walk than drive, especially since they don't have parking.  Be sure to hit up an ATM if necessary before visiting Santarpio's in East Boston though, because they only accept cold hard cash.  \\n\\nSantarpio's pizzas are 14 inches, and our group ordered a couple; one sausage and pepperoni and one meat lovers (which is essentially is just sausage and pepperoni plus ground beef).  The nicely seasoned sauce may have been my favorite part, and they are generous with its layering above the cheese.  The perfectly browned cheese was also very good, and the meats were flavorful, especially the somewhat spicy homemade sausage.  My only complaint would be that the crust was a little too charred and crunchy along the edges for my liking.  I think this may have just been because our pizzas were left in for too long though, and not necessarily the way Santarpio's always cooks their pizzas.  All said, I would be happy to return to Santarpio's Pizza during another visit to Boston, and I would likely just ask that the crust doesn't get too well done."},{"name":"Otto & Anita's European Restaurant","address":"3025 SW Canby St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Excellent meal, good portions, a wide selection of desserts and kid friendly.

I have a very soft spot for dessert and this place did not disappoint.  The only thing is it can be pricey but the quality of the dessert, portion and how you feel when you have your first bite is so worth it.  \\n\\nI paid much more for Miku's green tea dessert and the portion was so much smaller, so I don't think this is out of line at all.  I had the chocolate marquise....OMG! This had crisp parline, chocolate mousse, salted caramel and hazelnut dacquoise, a perfect combination of smooth, crunchy, and silky all in one bite.  It's rich so you wouldn't be able to finish one by yourself, unless you want to, like I did :) Also got to enjoy the hazelnut pithivier, and this was flaky, crunchy and the best part was that it wasn't too sweet, well balanced so you can have it for a morning snack or for breakfast.  And onto the last one I tried which was the mango coconut tart.  Perfecto to offset the richness of the chocolate marquise.  It's sweet and tart at the same time and the crust was crispy and buttery perfect.  I got a gift box of 12 macaroons from my friend and it was $27.85 for 12 so they are not cheap but so worth it.

The 45 minute wait wasn't so bad, and once we got inside (gorgeous interior with a high, industrial ceiling), the wait for the food itself wasn't too long. \\nI ordered one liege waffle with milk chocolate lavender sauce, and the fricasse. The waffle was a bit disappointing, for its size and price the eating experience should be heavenly, but it wasn't. The exterior was soft (I wish it was crispier, for a textural contrast at least) and the waffle wasn't warmed up or anything. However, it was satisfyingly chewy, and not overwhelmingly sweet on its own (that's where the sauce comes in). My sauce was great and you can taste the lavender, but my friend's white chocolate pistachio rosewater sauce-- the rose didn't come through as strongly. \\nThe fricasse was okay, nothing spectacular, and (I'm sorry) not really worth it if you have to line up for an hour to taste it. The braised shortrib wasn't at that succulent melt-in-your-mouth stage yet, but the grilled focaccia that comes with it is a definite winner for sopping up the sauce. \\nSo overall, I'm satisfied since there's nothing wrong with the food, but there's also nothing mindblowing/memorable about it either.

The 5 course dinner was a little over $100 for a couple. Everything we received was delicious. (I will include a picture of the menu in my review) I especially liked my dining partner's lobster bisque - it had huge chunks of lobster in it! I also really liked how tender my filet mignon was. However, everything was just kind of lukewarm. The flavors are good and the dishes are well executed but it wasn't anything to write home about.\\n\\nAs other Yelpers have said, Nine18 is inside the Grand Cypress. It overlooks an expansive golf course. The interior is slightly small and is a bit strange; half the room is elevated with the dining area being the lower half of the room. The place was also pretty empty in the evening. I'm not sure if this is due to the restaurant trying to space out reservations or because the listing says \\"closed\\" on Yelp. Only about a little less than half the place was full at \\"peak\\" time (8PM-ish) even though our initial reservation request of later evening was denied. \\n\\nUpon sitting, we were offered free glasses of champagne as well as delicious bread/butter. The servers were very attentive to us but were kind of awkward(?) at times. I'm not sure how to explain it.  They weren't very inviting? And felt kind of cold? I think it may have had to do with us being significantly younger than the other diners. Our courses came out right after the other - it was well organized and we never had to wait long periods of time for our food. Everything was plated well. I do wish that the crumbs on our tablecloth were \\"sweeped\\" after every course since it got pretty messy from the bread, but that's just me being nitpick-y. At the end of the meal my partner and I got to have a really great conversation without feeling rushed.

So is the burger. Wings are ok, but for fifteen cents, they can be pretty lousy and I'd still be satisfied. \\n\\nI remember back from when I was in college that Whiskey's has some good fruity mixed drinks (shut up, you drank shit too when you were 21). When my friend recently tried to order one at 1 am, the waitress sassed at him and told him he'd be having beer instead. It made me laugh. It might have pissed me off normally, but I wasn't in Whiskey's at 1 am because I was sober and serious.\\n\\nDude, seriously: Whiskey's is ON MY WAY HOME FROM ALMOST EVERYWHERE ELSE.

Great coffee. Cool staff. 15 beers on tap (stone ipa, realale coffee porter, etc.) great sandwiches but even better breakfast tacos. Can get a little greasy at times but overall a really great hangout study place!"},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I've yet to meet a dish I didn't like at Myers + Chang. Pouring over the menu, making a decision on what to eat proves difficult, as nearly every item jumps out at me. A melange of Asian cuisine, the spicy, sweet, salty and crunchy elements are scattered throughout the tri-fold paper menu, one of the many down-to-earth elements of eating a meal at Myers +Chang.\\n\\nThough I'd venture to say that if you're a pork lover, you're apt to enjoy anything served with it on the menu, but stand outs for me are the Pork Dumplings (full and meaty, with a bit of kick and a nice, crispy char on the underside) and the Triple Pork Mushu Stir Fry (if not a bit on the salty side, is loaded with chinese sausage, pork loin and bacon and served with a side of mushu sauce, and buns for sandwich construction). The Sweet Potato Fritters packed a nice crunch on the outside, giving way to a soft, sweet inside with bits of Chinese sausage. For fish, the Tamarind-Glazed Local Cod was well-prepared; the fish was moist and sweet, and the Jicama salad beneath served to cut through the glaze with a little acidic zing. My favorite on the 'dim sum' section by far is the Singaporean Black Pepper Prawns. The tender prawns slathered in spicy black pepper sauce weren't a far from the flavors of the traditional Black Pepper Crab I enjoyed in Singapore last summer. \\n\\nBeyond satisfying and well-priced food, the service here is beyond fantastic. The welcome is always warm and prompt, with multiple people greeting you and making sure you've been taken care of and ave what you need. The seating, while it may not always be prompt at this busy restaurant, is handled very well, is the hostess will continually update up on your table's availability. Once seated, your server will undoubtedly be attentive, helpful with menu decisions and ready to explain the concept, dishes or ingredients. At no time did our server push us to order more, nor rush out when when we finished our meals. Sitting at the counter, the chef made light conversation as he breezed through a busy Saturday night, and the line cooks all thanked us for coming in to the restaurant, as did nearly every server, bartender and hostess we passed on the way out. The first time I ate here, I thought it was a fluke, but no, it happens every time.\\n\\nFinally, dessert. Don't skip it. After consuming your dinner, you're going to want a palette refresh after all the glazed/salty/spicy dishes you just consumed. If I may direct your attention to the Frozen Vanilla Bean Parfait. Remeber those amazing orange creamsicles you eagerly purchased with your allowance from the ice cream truck on a hot summer day?  Now imagine them all grown up, a heaping square of vanilla-bean ice cream, topped with a bright and tangy orange granita (Italian ice) and fresh orange slices. A delicious, light and refreshing trip down memory lane.\\n\\nReturn visits to try even more of the menu are certainly in order, though when dinner is complete I will again choose the Frozen Vanilla Bean Parfait as long as they serve it and follow it with a pot of their Ginger Lemon tea."},{"name":"Rangzen Tibetan Place","address":"24 Pearl St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Pros: Love the look and feel of the place. It is cozy, and the decor and architectural details feel very Tibetan. Psel phaley and tema soup (lentil soup) were decent. Staff were nice.The dipping sauces were fine. \\n\\nCons: The main purpose of my visit was to try their momos. I did not like the momos at all. I am not familiar with Tibetan cuisine so my dislike is probably caused by my expectation of a Nepali type momo, which is quite different. Nepali momos are smaller, are made of a thinner wrapper, and have a more flavorful  interior. Plus, I was not expecting such big pieces of mushroom inside the dumpling - I don't like mushrooms. I also tried shogo numtak (deep fried thinly sliced potatoes) and Tibetan tea. The shogo numtak was tasty but too greasy. The traditional Tibetan tea was too salty for me :(. I had a hard time reconciling the fact that my tea was salty and not sweet. I should have gone for the Darjeeling tea. Not sure if I will go back. \\n\\nI think if you try this place out without an expectation that the food will be similar to other types of cuisine in South Asia (e.g., Nepal, India), you will probably enjoy the food more than I did."},{"name":"Gaucho's Argentine Cuisine","address":"2037 SE Jefferson St","city":"Milwaukie","stars":"4","text":"Food was awesome.

I love that they have a check-in deal when you check in on Yelp. Unfortunately, I was told this time that each table can only redeem one deal ( a free soft drink)....which is tough because you would normally come as a group....I don't see the fine print for that either...Anyway, besides that minor glitch, the service is still very courteous and fast. They are very accommodating for our little people. \\n\\nThe green tea cold noodles was delicious, chewy but wasn't really served on ice like I expected."},{"name":"Phoebe's Diner","address":"533 W Oltorf St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Lovely diner! I wouldn't even call this place a diner because the quality of the food at Phoebe's was above average and everything was so freshly made. Great atmosphere and customer service. The only downside was the fresh toast we had seemed a little unevenly soaked in the rum batter so there was a strong rum taste in the French toast but it may have been a mishap and other than that everything was excellent. We started with the South First Tots and Deep Fried French Toast and then had the Badass Bacon and Eggs and The 04' Platter. Both entrees were uber delicious and huge portions compared to a lot of other brunch places in Austin. The price was also very reasonable for the amount of food we received. Definitely will be coming back to Phoebe's for breakfast and/or lunch!"},{"name":"Las Tortas Locas","address":"5841 Roswell Rd NE, Ste 5","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Having moved here from Texas, I am pretty tough on \\"authentic\\" Mexican Restaurants in the Atlanta suburbs.

Took it as a great sign that we were two of the few gringos crowding in for lunch.  Every work crew and soccer team in the area was here for lunch. And what a lunch!!  Fantastic food. Quick service. (It's counter service with a condiment bar). Ample portions. Very affordable. ($17 for more food than the 2 of us could eat). Small but comfortable place. A couple of patio tables.

Two large injera pakcakes were included which was more than enough to finish both dishes. The chicken was very tasty but I was really surprised that it came with only one chicken leg and one egg. I fished around in the 'curry' sauce for more but that was it. It was also fairly oily and spicy so if you're not into that then avoid it. The lamb dish consisted of stir-fry sized strips of lamb. Period. That's all it was -- just meat. No vegetables or gravy or anything. The meat itself had a decent taste but was tough. My girlfriend found the chicken too spicy and the lamb too tough so she didn't eat much other than the egg. I was able to polish off the remainder of both dishes without leaving a scrap left over. So I would say the portion size is small.\\n\\nI'm guessing this food is authentic Ethiopian food so I was happy with having the chance to try it. The prices were high for what you get. I think this place could be improved if there was a sampler that gave you a bunch of things to try for a decent price. Otherwise the portion size should be increased so that you don't feel like you dropped $50 for a chicken leg, an egg, and a small bowl of tough, fried meat.\\n\\nI think this restaurant has a kind of identity problem, trying to be authentic but having high prices. If the owner wants to go upscale the place should reflect that kind of atmosphere. I will say that the owner was nice and the place was very clean. But it's not fancy. I could have spent more than $80 had we ordered drinks and another dish."},{"name":"Preference Noodle House","address":"4854 Imperial Street","city":"Burnaby","stars":"4","text":"My friend and I ordered the chicken nuggets, Taiwanese beef noodle, and a chicken stir-fry noodle and we couldn't have been any happier with it.\\n\\nPrice point was great for all of the items and they all seemed lighter than their counterparts from other restaurants.
