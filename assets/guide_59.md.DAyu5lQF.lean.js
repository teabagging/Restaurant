Don't get me wrong, this place was still good, but it wasn't GREAT, like how I imagined. \\n\\nFood: \\n1) Danish pancakes: very interesting, instead of being flat and round, it was in a shape of a ball, topped with powdered sugar and served with jam and syrup. It had the components of regular pancakes but it's disguised in a different shape just to spice things up. I enjoyed a different presentation, but the taste was just so so for me.\\n \\n2) Fish fillet baked scramble(??): I'm sorry, my memory escapes me, I just remembered it was a baked scramble with bits of fish in it, but I don't remember the intimate details. It's mainly because I didn't really enjoy the dish. I found it largely tasteless. No impact on my taste buds. But I must say, FANTASTIC presentation on the food! The scramble came on a mini iron skillet and the handle came with it's own mini oven mitt. Aww, so cute. Yes, it was. It also came with some home fries or potatoes, which I'm not a big fan of potatoes. \\n\\nService: \\nVery nice and friendly. No complaints here. \\n\\nAmbiance:\\nIt's small and quaint. Very loud and busy. It's difficult to even carry on a conversation with a person sitting across a small table from you.

When we arrived, the downstairs hostess had her head down and appeared to be asleep. It took two tries to wake her. Our waitress was very polite, brought everything out in a timely fashion, and apologized when we got up to find her and ask for lemons. As a general statement, I was a bit surprised that most of the staff was not dressed in a way that would reflect their menu prices. To me, high price = high class = professional uniform and appearance.\\n\\nAmbiance: olde world tavern feel with yellow lighting (upstairs). A bit hard for the eyes to adjust to, but not troublesome. The upstairs was quite loud between guests walking through, the staff talking amongst themselves, cleaning tables, etc. I was hoping for a more intimate dinner experience, but this was not exactly it. Downstairs, the oyster bar was consistently packed, with both diners and gawkers, with lots of picture-taking. If you're like me, there's nothing comfortable about tourists cramming in around you, taking pictures of you slurping oysters.\\n\\nFood: complimentary cornbread with Cabot butter served for starters was very tasty. I ordered the Lazy Man's Lobster (a special) and my fianc√©e (!!!) ordered shrimp ravioli. My dish, akin to a casserole, was big hearty chunks of lobster meat baked with cream, sherry and breadcrumbs in a dish; it also came with a side, I opted for new potatoes. Jamie's dish had both shrimp in the ravioli and was also garnished with whole shrimp and vegetables. The lobster casserole was VERY rich and buttery, I ate about 1/3 of it before realizing I really needed some acidity to cut through the richness (hence the lemons). In my opinion, their heavy use of Ritz-like breadcrumbs took away from delicious, velvety lobster. Thankfully, there was a lot of good quality, perfectly cooked lobster, which helped with the price sting.\\n\\nPrice: Dinner for two without drinks (before tip): $68.

They are very vegan and gluten-free friendly which is a huge bonus as well. My personal favorites are the Basil Portobello Sandwich, Kale Caesar Salad and Tomato Bisque Soup. The Basil Portobello comes on ciabatta bread which is insanely good although I have also gotten it on the gluten-free bread which I think is a very good alternative. Their gluten-free bread tastes better than most I have had and did not have a strange texture which is commonly an issue. The sandwich is loaded with roasted Portobello mushrooms, roasted red pepper, arugula and a delicious herbed cashew cream that reminds me of an herb aioli. The Kale Caesar salad is crazy good. The Caesar dressing is vegan and tastes AMAZING. It is served on a bed of kale with lemon roasted chickpeas, carrots and cashew parmesan. I have had this salad at both locations and the one at the Grandview location is much bigger and more nicely presented. They also have rotating soup specials. The one I have tried is the Tomato Bisque. Their soups are always vegan and gluten free and this soup was some of the best (vegan or not) tomato soups I have ever had. It is creamy and very well-seasoned. I have also tried a few of their grab and go options. The first thing I tried was the quinoa fried rice which was phenomenal. It had all the flavor of fried rice with none of the guilt, it doesn't get better than that!. I have also tried their banana maple pecan doughnut which is vegan and gluten free. The doughnut was definitely a bit dry but I still really enjoyed the flavor, it is difficult to make a gluten free doughnut taste good so I give them props! Overall, I really enjoy Alchemy for their food options, however, if you are looking to get a smoothie or smoothie bowl, I personally prefer Zest."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Soggy ass pizza didn't replace it with better Pizza.

I love to drive but when I have to go from point A to point B I am on a mission. .. no unnecessary stops. . .rest stops are for pusses.  When I heard about that bat-shit astronaut who threw on an astronaut diaper so she could drive across country, I didn't think that part was so crazy. . I thought it was genius. .. in fact, I wondered where I could get me some of those (as a civilian I can't, and I don't think I could con LouLou into wearing one so that idea is out the window).  \\n\\nSo my exhausted food freak self showed up at Andina on a Friday night.  I drag my road weary carcass to this place, sitting at a middle of the room two top weaving back and forth in my chair because I still felt like I was driving.   Note to restaurants who place lone diners in the middle of the room:  Just don't - people stare and then freak if you make eye contact like you're going to want to sit in their laps and share their meal. . . be kind and hook a girl up with a nice two top banquette in a corner. . thanks.  \\n\\nSo, yeah, I was tired.  But I was determined to have a nice meal.  I ordered a lovely glass of wine and a bottle of Pelligrino.  The place was hopping and LOUD.  So loud that I couldn't hear any of the serving staff.  I just smiled and nodded a lot.  My server described specials to me. .. it was like being on a cellphone with someone driving through a tunnel. . . I caught bits and pieces but no real words.  When the food runner brought me my quinoa bread and described the dipping sauces, I was dying to ask if their was quinoa in the bread or if they were using quinoa flour but just didn't have the where-with-all to shout above the din.  The bread was good but the dipping sauces were amazing.  It was sort of like playing Top Chef.  I'd taste a sauce and try to guess what was in them.  I know one had passion fruit in it. . .it had the nice acid from the fruit mixed with a nice punch from chiles.  There was a jalapeno mint dipping sauce too that was delicious.  \\n\\nThe food is Andean. . hence, Peruvian.  They break the menu down into two sections. . one is called Piqueos which are Peruvian tapas and the other menu they call \\"Novo-Andean\\" Platos.   I saw a few main courses pass by. . they looked large and cumbersome.  Since I was dining solo and not accompanied by G.T., my partner in crime, I wanted to order some Piqueos so I could taste as many things as possible.  The great thing about the Piqueo menu is that you can get three different sizes - pequeno, mediano and grande. .. so if you have a lot of people in your party everyone gets something. . I loved this idea.  I ordered all platos pequenos.  \\n\\nI had: Tortilla de Patata y Aioli de Aji Amarillo, Pimiento Piquillo Relleno, a Cheese plate, Musciame de Atun, Chicharron de Langostinos and a Causa Solterito.\\n\\nIt sounds like a lot but the portion were perfect.  My favorite was the Causa which is a cold potato dish. . the potatoes are feather light and spiked with lime. . this one was covered with a green bean and cheese salad.   That description doesn't do it justice. . it is just simple and plain deliciousness.  The Langostinos were fried with a quinoa crust and the huacatay (Peruvian black mint)-peanut sauce was so good I wanted to drink it.    The Piquillos were also very, very good.  The only clunker was the Tortilla... it was fine but I think the server should have told me it was only ordinary because a girl only has so much stomach real estate and mine was sort of wasted on that.  The cheese plate was very good. . .the cheese portions sort of tiny though. . they served it with membrillo cubes and toasted corn that was like homemade corn nuts.  I loved them!  The tuna loin was great with an amazing avocado/tomato salsa.  \\n\\nI wanted to try the ceviche of green mango and prawns but I was full and I was tired.  I just wanted to get to my room and go to sleep.  Since I didn't have the Gastronomic Titan with me. . I almost skipped dessert but once they put the menu in front of me, I perked up a bit. .. but as I sat there contemplating putting more into my tummy I just couldn't do it.  I was done.  I asked to take home two Alfajores and one each of their selection of three \\"Trufas Peruanas\\" or Peruvian truffles.  \\n\\nI was so tired when I got back to my room that I put my desserts away and went straight to bed.\\n\\nThose Alfajores were the best version of that cookie I have ever had.  EVER.  The truffles were good too, one was yellow hot pepper with spiced citrus peel in dark chocolate, one was anise in dark chocolate and the last one was passionfruit and apricots in milk chocolate - that one was my favorite. . if you've never had passionfruit with milk chocolate, try it sometime. . it is a perfect marriage.

The large fans, made to look like propellers, provide a nice cooling breeze in the Florida heat. \\n\\nThe seating outside, where we chose to sit, was directly across from the Star Wars Jedi Academy.

I mean, you can't screw up pancakes, so they had that going for them, but they just weren't very good.

I choose not to review them because it makes me sad on the inside. My friend Liz cried out in anguish last week when I told her the most recent ramen place (not Jinya) I went to was terrible. She said, \\"how many more dollars do we have to sink into disappointing ramen?!\\" I told her the day will come when we find a good ramen place. Something that's almost as good as Shin-Sen-Gumi Hakata Ramen in LA. Is Jinya the coming of the ramen that was promised? It will have to be Azor Ramen'hai for now. \\n\\nI stopped on by this past Sunday to grab a spicy miso ramen with pork chashyu bowl combo! The broth was plenty (many places around town have been really skimping on the broth lately) and the noodles were perfect. I really liked that you could add your own toppings as well! Definitely add in pork soboro to any ramen that has pork chasyu. It's ground pork and it's amaze. The miso makes the broth on the salty side so ask for extra broth to kind of water it down a little. They will also give you fresh garlic and pickled ginger if you ask. \\n\\nThe pork chasyu bowl was great too. Good amount of rice (one cup or more) with copious amounts of chopped up chasyu with light soy sauce topped with fresh scallions. I really liked that they offer these combo options. I get to eat my ramen and take some to go and eat the rest of my side order! \\n\\nAnother thing that is very magical about their noodles, it didn't bloat into massive strands when I went to go eat it for dinner. I was solidly impressed. \\n\\nIs Jinya the Prince that was Promised? Only time will tell but for now, it is the best place for ramen in ATL. BAR NONE. \\n\\nPSA: THEY DO NOT DO TO GO.

Have you ever been to an actual bakery before? This one ain't great and frankly I'm baffled by the reviews here. \\n\\nThe decor is amazing. The people are lovely. The cases are full of beautiful things, but each thing I've tried has been expensive and disappointing. I've had the cream cheese blueberry muffin,  the chocolate hazelnut tart, the lemon pastry, and a caramel latte and I wouldn't recommend any of them.  :(\\n\\nThe muffin I got was super dry and crumbly. When Amelie's first opened they brought some treats to my work and included a muffin, and that one was really tasty.  I'm guessing since they have so many offerings that each one doesn't get made daily,  which doesn't fly with baked goods, and I'd hope a bakery would know that. The one I bought and the one they brought were night and day texture-wise and I'm kinda mad I spent $3 for that downer of a breakfast. \\n\\nThe lemon pastry was also clearly old, as the texture was again all wrong.  Instead of being crisp and flaky, it had the softness of a Publix turnover. I would assume from my experience that they maybe don't bake these things in house, and possibly get some frozen? \\n\\nThe choco hazelnut tart was the best of the things I got, but yet again the texture wasn't right.  The crust was very bendable and chewy,not at all what I expected from a tart.\\n\\nI was really looking forward to my latte, but it too was an expensive mistake.  Not as good as Octane nearby, and not even as good as what I make at home. \\n\\nAs usual, I really wanted to like this place but they made it really difficult. I am more than willing to spend major bucks on baked goods (ask La Calavera) but it's gotta be worth it.

These guys know what they're doing. \\n\\nAfter a bit we were approached by staff and asked if we would like to sit or continue to hang out. We decided to start getting to the food. We opted for an open booth where we could get a little closer to each other ;) The mood lighting and candles are nice. Definitely a good date spot. \\n\\nOur server was immediately at the table, and she gave us a brief rundown of the place and what was on offer for the day. We put in an order of a dozen mixed oysters and some charred octopus. After a bit a runner returned with the octopus and a bonus watermelon crab salad. Ohhh man, they were both excellent. The octopus was tender and had these great charred bits, and the watermelon salad had an unexpected spicy kick that I found tasty and creative. Afterwords the oysters came out, and my girl and I had a fun time pretended to understand the nuances of regional shellfish. Around this time I think I made the comment that I was really happy where I was at the time. We were in a good spot enjoying good food with good company in a good atmosphere.

I ate the whole thing despite my attempt not to. It didn't even need butter.\\nCLAM CHOWDER - the best in town.. or anywhere for that matter\\nBOSTON SCROD - we had it blackened, which was a little spicy and delicious\\nLOBSTER ROLL - a legitimate amount of lobster in here.. no messing around.. and it was served on a french roll that was just the right amount of crispy\\n\\nSeriously, everything was delicious.\\n\\nThe wait time can be long.. expect to wait at least 45 minutes.  The set up is a bit strange with narrow staircases and many rooms, but that's because the building is so old! It just adds to the history and charm. You have the option to dine in the bar area if you can get a table (first come first served) but it's not the full menu.\\n\\nIt is a bit pricey, but isn't any quality seafood establishment?"},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"How did I go from destroying delicious brisket at Le Barbecue to eating Vegetarian? I guess this trip to Austin has made me weird after all\\n\\nHaving vegetarian family members means that once in a while you have to suck it up and enjoy something they want, hence my trip here. I've often joked that it's not fair for a vegetarian restaurant to not have any meat options whereas meat restaurants have vegetarian options (this doesn't amuse vegetarians though...)\\n\\nAll jokes aside this place is awesome. I walked away feeling as satisfied as I would have anywhere else. The spicy pesto sauce is probably one of the best condiments I've had in recent memory. I ended up going with the veggie burger (I kept it basic) and it was fantastic. I wasn't daring enough to try the \\"Fakon\\" as it's sacreligious to fake bacon but it didn't need it. The Patty itself was a good size and had plenty of toppings (I added avocado as well). \\n\\nThe vegan ice cream - vanilla ice cream made with coconut milk was pretty decent too. A bit sweet but definitely interesting\\n\\nOverall I was pleasently surprised by this place. As someone who doesn't frequent vegetarian spots, I was shown that they can be satisfying.

Our fourth diner had the best dish of the evening which was a salmon over beans and greens-still a bit saltier than he'd prefer.  \\n\\nOn to the worst dish which was the one I selected as it was highly recommended by our server- the braised short ribs with carrots and mashed potatoes.  The presentation was great, then as I put my knife into the short rib I knew I was in trouble-it was tough and hard to cut. Each piece was loaded with gristle which I kept gnawing, jawing and spitting out until I finally surrendered.  My friend gave some of her salty roast chicken and I ate that along with my taters and carrots.  The server apologized and my meal was comped which was all fine and dandy but I left feeling cheated out of what could have been a delightful experience!

Finally at 8:17 we were seated... at a table meant for 5 people. We brought up the small size of the table to the waiter, who brought over the manager. The manager struggled to lie and say they always sit parties of 7 at that size table, but a couple of us have been there before and know that is simply not true. We were physically touching each other- and we aren't large people. Finally he admitted that the other large party before us was supposed to leave a half hour earlier but were lingering. We pointed out that our issue was how late we seated, and he did not even say the word \\"sorry\\" once. We decided to fully leave and go somewhere else. When we handed the host the coat check tickets, it took them a full 8 minutes to bring the coats. Where were they keeping them, the basement?

Alas, a relatively minor complaint- no complementary bread. This is always a disappointment the rare times encountered  at a nice Italian place. 4 slices of the *Pane Con Oliva Ed Erbe come on a plate for $3. They are rather good, made fresh with herbs and olive oil- but still. \\n\\n*Arancini del Giorno (Osso Bucco Sauce) were good, crispy rice balls; though rice inside was mushier than ideal and could have used a little more flavor. *Burrata was superb; creamy and milky with a more firm shell. The heirloom tomatoes were invitingly leaking with flavor. \\n\\n*Ravioli del Giorno (Ricotta + Mushroom + Sun Dried Tomatoes) was swimming in a delicious cream with freshly shaved cheese; tomatoes were perfectly piquant. *Fettuccine Nere (served with scallops but I added shrimp) was fresh, but to be honest I have had better fresh pasta. The scallops and shrimp were some succulently scrumptious seafood, though! \\n\\n*Osso Bucco fall off the bone tender. The sauce is good enough to be drinkable. The flavor infused itself beautifully into the meat. The bone marrow was a delectable bonus. *Artichoke Hearts are attractively oversized; cooked well as they were tender, but the balsamic was overpowering. *Pollo Parmigana breaded expertly, though the  fillets could have been a little more moist. Served with a small side of fresh linguine in marinara sauce. \\n\\nAs a delightful finale, we had a classic *Tiramisu. And they did it well. Dulcet, fluffy, moist.

My friend had a lobster roll and as I'm not a fan of the crustacean, I only had their fabulous buttered brioche!  I was salivating when the bar chefs were toasting several and they kindly gave me a roll.  Definitely carb worthy...so good!\\n\\n=     Price is on the high side.   \\n\\n=     Service was friendly but scattered.  We were seated right away at the bar and ordered sparkling water to start.  Here, the wait-persons walk around outside of the bar and tend to you but they aren't assigned to specific seats / customers.  It took 3  more requests with 2 different servers before we got the water!   Also they missed a flatware setting, a napkin and serving spoons for the condiments.  We had to wait and flag them each time.... Sloppy and annoying!  They did better with cocktail orders as the waitress had to go to the main DR bar and was prompt.   \\n\\n=    Parking is garage $5 for 3 hours, $3 for valet and street (limited).   I opted for self park.  Be sure to display the ticket on your dash as we saw several cars with boots.  \\n\\nOver all, as with other Ford Fry restos, you can count on them for ambiance and drinks.

My rationale is as follows:\\n\\n- I *really* need to eat more vegetables. If nothing else, I need to diversify away from rice and pasta (though I seriously heart  them).\\n\\n- I also need something that is light and cleansing. So no beef, pork or even chicken, for that matter.\\n\\n - I ran the 5K today, so anything less than a healthy meal is not an option.\\n\\nI decided to give this place a try, since this place had good reviews (in particular, Tami's review), so I made my way down to downtown and got off JW Dobbs. As I made my left, I recognized that I been on this street before (since it wasn't too far from my place of work) - in particular, with my attempt to run a few miles from and back to my job - right in the middle of the summer day.\\n\\n*Flashback: a few months, walking back to work.\\n\\n\\"Crap, it's frickin' hot. . . . dang, this neighborhood is sketchy. . . whoa, I think I'm melting . . . wheeee. . .\\"\\n\\nOkay, so it wasn't a positive experience.\\n\\nAnyway, I didn't expect it to be in the sketchy part of down. I had thought that it is probably up ahead in the gentrified part of down, but that was dashed to pieces when I passed Jackson. I parked, looked around for something like a gathering of urban pioneers that would indicate the location of this restaurant. Failing that, I took my laptop from my car (which is fair unusual for me to do, but I don't trust the area enough to leave it in there) and walked east. \\n\\nLooking at the windows, after passing by the boarded up thrift store, I found the place Then I walked in. ..  actually, almost stumbled in like a poor traveler just getting out of the blizzard and look around a bit.\\n\\nThe interior is a complete contrast to the outside. The tables. . . were not regular restaurant tables, but stylish dining tables (well stylish to me - what do I know about tables?). Silverware are in the jars for people to pick out after ordering the food. There are paintings on the walls made by apparently local artists, which adds to the charm, me thinks.\\n\\nOrdering the food was fairly straightforward - you walk up to the counter, pick out your items and then head over to the table. \\n\\nFor the food, I ordered the following (which turns out to be a mistake, in retrospect).\\n\\n- Georgia arugula salad with bucheron chevre, table grapes and sliced green apple\\n\\n- Grilled(?) tofu sandwich with avocado mousse  and heirloom tomatoes, with a side of pink eye peas topped with orange.\\n\\n- Carrot juice.\\n\\nThe carrot juice came first. It was quite tasty - I can tell that it was freshly made and didn't came from some container. Then the salad and the sandwich and I went right to work.\\n\\nThe salad I wasn't expecting much except to be good,  but the bucheron chevre (which is apparently some sort of cheese) really tempered the peppery of the arugula and made it a lot more pleasant to eat (maybe peppery is not the right word - help me out, guys), which elevates it to excellent.\\n\\nThe surprise is the sandwich. I was expecting the tofu to be quite tasteless, but it had flavor - almost meaty, in fact. And pairing the avocado mousse as the condiment made it a pleasure to eat.\\n\\nSo by the time I was done, I felt quite cleansed. Light? Not so much. Apparently, I forgot that the laws of physics still applies to vegetarian foods well, so I was quite stuffed (I think I surprised the host when I finished both dishes - I think her exact words were \\"amazing\\". I don't think I stunned my hosts since I was 12, when I once ate 8 plates of spaghetti).  Fortunately, it didn't last too long - when I went inside the car and away from peoples' ears, I let out a nice dignified burp (which, come to think of it, is the reason why I don't eat too much vegetables - dang things give you gas).\\n\\nIn short, it was my first complete vegetarian meal and I loved it. That said, I probably should order just a single dish next time - I don't think I need to freak the hosts out with my overwhelming consumption. :D\\n\\n*If you are wondering what was I talking about, message me."},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Very yummy, like home cooked food!

This restaurant has an Indian buffet every day of the week until 3 pm. It was around 1:30pm when we walked in and there were only 2 other people eating. A gentleman, I assume one of the owners, sat us right by the window and filled our glasses with water and told us to go right up to the buffet to eat. That was the last we saw of him our entire meal. The buffet was on the smaller side from what I'm used to. The major offerings were naan bread, basmati rice, chicken tikka, chicken tikka marsala, saag paneer, curried vegetables, a chickpea dish, a daal dish and American iceberg lettuce/salad. They did have some spices/sauces, none of which were labeled. The meats were very tender but had no flavor. The saag paneer had 1 piece of paneer in the whole tray and the spinach was very watery. The naan bread was light and fluffy, but the rice was hard and dry, no aromatics.The biggest flavor I got was salt. We drank down our water pretty quickly and no one was around to even ask for a refill. A food pick-up service kept calling out from the main counter to get someones attention while we were there as well. Finally a woman came out, towards the end of our meal, to help him and then a few minutes later the original gentleman returned. We ran up to ask for water to be refilled and our plates to be cleared. We paid at the counter and left full, but feeling bloated from the salt. In my opinion, fair price at $13 for the buffet but the flavor and quality were just not there. Of note, there is only street parking in the area and we had to walk 5/6 blocks to come here."},{"name":"The Ocoee Taco Company","address":"40 Taylor St","city":"Ocoee","stars":"4.5","text":"Excellent food.

There is a large list of free veggie add-ons. Next time I will order the burger more well-done so maybe it won't be quite as soft, but the flavor is great. All of the burgers come on a soft, buttery classic bun that isn't too thick and compliments the burger well. It collapses some when it's wrapped up to go, but the prettiest burgers aren't usually the tastiest anyway. Their sweet potato fries are the best I've ever had. They are not sweet at all.

It's too powerful and throws off the taste of whatever I'm eating . \\n\\nHowever this second visit is why I am choosing to one star this establishment. \\n\\nMy friends and I had a reservation at 7 PM. Only one person was there at that time. They said the other two would have to arrive no later than 7:15 or the table would be given away, understandable. However, when we walk in at 7:15 and the party is complete and you still give away the table anyways, really? What was the point in all of the dramatics? Literally rushing my friends along to get there and still we were not seated. The front of the house employees are very rude. Snobby and come off as to put themselves above everyone else. A black women literally got within inches of my friends face as she was clearly upset over the situation and it was also her birthday. But no care in the world. We were told we would not be serviced because we offended the short black man in the front in some way. So STORY TIME: my friend turned to me and said \\"I come here every week and they aren't the friendliest but the food is good, they could be assholes sometimes.\\" Low and behold the little short black host at the front turns around and says \\"oh okay so since I'm an asshole I guess I will just tend to my others tables\\" and when my friend said excuse me? He said we offended him and we won't be seated at all! Okay sir, first of all, you work as a host in a small restaurant, I'm pretty sure you have been called worse. But it's nice to know that ease dropping made you feel good about not servicing us. You MUST have thicker skin man or that industry just isn't for you.

First we arrived promptly for our reservation and were told the only seat available is at the bar with a 10 minute wait. This place is $45 a plate, I should get a table with a reservation,duh. It's gets better, the bar seats where right under a vent that alternatively spewed molten hot air or tundra cold AC. My gf and I took off and put on our jackets 3 times, this was Russian sauna level temperature changes. I could forgive all of this with excellent food. Nope, not close. Quality of duck was fatty with haphazardly strung lawn shavings strewn about the plate, not seasoned whatsoever. The cabbage was burnt to a crisp, we're talking Pompei here. Next was a dumpling that honestly was very good but in a deep bowl that made it a rescue mission to retrieve. The shrimp was unseasoned on top as if they forgot to add it until the last minute. The fish was also just terrible, literally ate a third of the food served and I eat anything, like garbage disposal level indiscriminate. Please save yourself the trouble and avoid this place at all costs, you're better off at McDonald's."},{"name":"Union Oyster House","address":"41 Union St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Damn this place is so good.

We were told there would be a 30-45 minute wait. After waiting for 45 minutes, the host came and told us he could seat us but we would have to hurry up and be up from the table by 830pm because of reservations. He said he would give us a minute to think about it. He walked away. He comes back a few minutes later and says he needs an answer immediately because he is about to give the table away and we have to decide now. Never in my life have I ever felt so mistreated and disrespected in an establishment. I understand restaurants have reservations but they should also allot time for walk in patrons. If  there was no room at all for any one else outside of reservations, we should have been advised to dine elsewhere.  This was my FIRST TIME AND MY LAST TIME ever coming to Poor Calvin's.

My friend had their exclusive Sam Adams beer and he said it was fine, not great, just fine. \\n\\nHowever, I would like to compliment their cornbread. The moment you sit down at the table they bring over warm cornbread and it is delicious! Because I was disappointed with the food we ordered, I ended up eating three pieces of cornbread.

I would come with my parents on a regular basis and loved it.  Yesterday was their anniversary, so we made a trip back.  They had a coupon from restaurants.com they wanted to use.  \\n\\nWhen we walked up, they had a pasta special of $9.95 for any of them.  They also had $10 bottles of wine.  Since I was driving, I didn't have any, but my step-dad and step-sister shared a couple of bottles.  : )  Not a bad deal.  \\n\\nOnce seated, our waitress came by for drink orders and asked if we were interested in appetizers while we were looking at the menu.  They ordered the calamari.  And this is where my 3 start rating begins.  \\n\\nAs stated in previous reviews, I don't know how their table system works.  Don't get me wrong, our waitress was very pleasant.  But she was covering tables all over the place.  We waited for quite a long time to place our order.  So long actually, that our appetizer came out and we still had not ordered!  And the place wasn't packed.  The outside tables were full with about 5 tables with guests inside.\\n\\nI don't eat seafood, but will try a bite if someone else gets it.  The calamari...not so much.  Most calamari come out looking a particular way, but these were closer to being full sized onion rings.  We were all suprised that they weren't the small little rings and none of the \\"squids\\" (as we call them) with the little legs.  And some had been over fried. \\n\\nThe salads were fine.  I upgraded mine to the antipasto, which looked really nice when it came out.  I ended up eating most of that and ate very little of my dinner.  Their bread has always been great.  We used to buy it from them to take home.\\n\\nFor dinner, I ordered the gorgonzola chicken.  It sounded really great on the menu.  My mom almost changed her order to get it, too.  Would I get it again?  No.  The chicken was on the dry size and the sauce....?  Pasty... I don't even know if I'll eat my leftovers.  I should have stuck with my norm and gotten the marsala.  But you have to try new things, right?\\n\\nMy step-sister got the marsala and loved that it had so many mushrooms.  My step-dad got the piccata and finished the whole thing.  And my mom had the lobster ravioli, but couldn't really taste the lobster in it.\\n\\nAnd now back to service.  By the time my meal arrived, I ran out of water.  I haven't had that happen in a restaurant in quite some time.  I finally had to ask.  And once we were ready to go, we sat quite a while longer.  We still needed boxes, but our waitress went to the tables around us and back outside again.  She did wrap them for us, which was nice.  Our bill also came without the coupon being applied even though we turned it in when the meal started.  And she didn't forget about it because she gave it to my step-dad and said the coupon had been applied (but it wasn't).  The manager had to void it and do it again.  \\n\\nOverall, an average place now.  I miss how great it used to be.  If you want a deal, get on their e-mailing list.

The chicken sandwich was incredible- it's actually a Diners Drive In's and Dives recommended menu item. The flat top Mac and cheese was also very good. Since it's cooked on a flattop, it has all the burnt cheese and the most amazing flavor. I'd highly recommend both of these items."},{"name":"Zesto - Atlanta","address":"377 Moreland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"So I had been wanting to hit up Zesto since I first moved here and I must say, I totally dig this place.

I opted out at first until I tasted my boyfriends and got the idea of what kind of German beer I would like. Turns out I am not that much of a fan of German beer. Not their fault, but I have never been anywhere where I can't try the beer first. Silly. \\n\\nOur server was very full of herself. She was ridiculously pretty and it felt like she knew that and made it work for her. She asked us right away whether we would like a drink. We hadn't even looked at the drink menu. \\nThen she came back one minute later. Really? Pace yourself lady. My partner ordered a beer and it came out right away, but we needed some time for food ordering. She seemed a bit annoyed that we were taking our time. I could care less that she was annoyed. This was our experience. \\n\\nWhen the food came out, it all came out, all at once. Ridiculous. We ordered five plates total. When she brought out the first four, I commented that we would like to eat slower than this and that I hoped his entree would be awhile. She shrugged her shoulders and said she had already put the order in, as if there was nothing she could do. It was a main entree, I am sure they could have paused it. \\n\\nThen at the end of the meal she started being more pleasant. I saw that for what it was. Milking us for a good tip. Sorry Lady, but I view the whole picture and you got 15%. The boyfriend wanted to give her less, but I wouldn't have that as I used to be in the industry. \\n\\nI won't ever go back."},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I went here for my birthday. My friends and I got the lobster macaroni and really could've just stopped there because it was so filling. But I wanted more than just an appetizer so got the seafood omelet. It was decent. My friends LOVED the fried goat cheese. I suggest making a reservation because this place is kinda small and gets booked up. I was ready to just go and wait for a table, but one of my friends had been there before and advised against that. She said it would be a really long wait. What I really appreciated was that they still sat us even though my friends got there an hour after our reservation (got stuck in traffic due to Pride) and they were closing in a half hour. The server explained that normally they wouldn't. But I can't remember why they allowed us to eat. AAAAAND they gave me dessert! We shared a delicious red velvet parfait. I don't know if this was complementary because my friends paid.

Upon arriving home i noticed my chalupa had chicken on it not beef. I also noticed my receipt was not given to me. I returned to the restaurant and went back through the drive thru. I told them what happened and ask for my receipt and a refund. I was told they had already remade my chalupa and I asked for my receipt and when I got home I noticed the bag had 2 chalupas not 1 and they both had sour cream AND the receipt was for an order that was not mine. I called the store and asked for the franchise owners information. I was laughed at so I hung up and did a google search and found the information. I called multiple times and nobody answered so I filed a formal complaint with corporate."},{"name":"Flanagan's Pub","address":"3001 Reynoldsburg New Albany Rd","city":"Blacklick","stars":"4","text":"Yummy!!

I've heard so much about it in my 10 years in Atlanta, but only recently stopped in to give it a try and I wish I hadn't. I'm giving it three stars because it wasn't necessarily bad, it just didn't live up to the hype: it's not southern food, it's cafeteria food. Flavorless cafeteria food. The atmosphere is lackluster and service wasn't great either. I'm so confused as to why people like this place. I had the ribs with Mac and cheese and fries... all of which were sooooo basic.

The server should spend his time learning to recognize this and not even bring it out rather than spending time explaining to me that it was not his responsibility and not his fault. I ate a couple but couldn't bring myself to continue. \\n\\nHe proceeded to take the clams off the check but not the oysters even though they were in the same pool of water and told me he had to speak with his management to do so.  I said I'd be happy to speak with his manager but he said that wouldn't be necessary. Ok.  \\n\\nGo to Neptune's or any other raw bar in the city instead of this historical establishment.

I should start with the positive- my meal was exceptional. I had the tofu fried hash, which was a savory mix of hash browns and fresh vegetables with a fresh pesto, eggs and deep-fried tofu strips. It was excellent and unexpected. She had the two-egg, with eggs, hash browns, toast and an excellent blackberry jam. We also shared the grilled macaroni and cheese, which is a must-have and was very tasty. The mimosas were good, but the Bloody Mary was exceptional- spicy and the perfect ratio of tomato juice to vodka. Although my food was nearly perfect, the experience was lessened somewhat by a number of issues. First, we had schmuck seating- at the bar top at the front of the restaurant near the hostess station. It felt like we were sort of slotted there while others enjoyed the charming cafe atmosphere in booths, and I feel our weird location made our friendly waitress forget about us at times. Second, while my food was nicely timed, her food was stone cold, which is not a good look for hash browns and eggs. I usually don't care about these small details, but cumulatively, it detracted from what could have been a near perfect brunch."},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"This was my first time at this establishment.  My partner, and our daughter were very much impressed when we arrived at this restaurant.  Although the wait was an hour due to last minute changes with our reservations. I must say the bartender's were very much on point, the drinks were out right FABULOUS. My family and i were once again blown away by the lobster mac & Cheese.  Our entrees consistented of the LOBSTER FRIED RICE.  Presentation was fist class, the taste was a bit spicy, yet every bite was delicious going down . I have no negative thoughts on the server. The service was very in depth and positive.  What needs to be improved upon i would say are the cleanliness of the bathrooms. Very disappointed with the conditions  . Otherwise i would highly recommend this Restaurant for the dining experience"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"If you are visiting Portland then Voodoo's is a must.

The AC was really working well which was great. \\n\\nWe ordered the knots as a app. I must say they were not great. Very hard and in our case dry. They were also very chewy. We got a large pepperoni which was good but my and kids would not eat till the ranch we asked for was served. They changed servers mid meal so we did not know who to ask for help. We wanted to share the last piece but could not find server to get a knife to cut it. Finally got the dullest one in Austin which trashed the slice. \\nAll of this a little aggravating but when the check arrived they added 20% gratuity to our order.

My food came out i ordered the salmon croquettes flat top cooked with green beans and mac n cheese. The salmon and mac n cheese we're really good. Those green beans came out of a can with no seasoning. i mean at least some salt and cook em in smoked turkey.  I didn't eat them but they did give me a extra side of mac with no problem.

The chicken was above average but nothing I would recommend to anyone else. The cream corn was good. The Mac n cheese though was easily the worst Mac and cheese I've ever had and I love Mac and cheese. I don't know what these other reviews praising it are talking about but the order I received was over cooked elbows with a strange squishy almost foamy layer of cheese like substance. No flavor. And water at the bottom of the bowl which I can only assume is from the elbows not being properly strained. It was absolutely disappointing. I ordered the peanut butter pie at the beginning of the meal as you order everything on a sheet that you write on. But after sitting in front of an empty plate for 20 minutes with no service I just asked for the check when our server came back to our table. I'm sure the food here was great at some point and it's possible I ordered the wrong things or that there was some level of inconsistency but this experience was disappointing enough for me to write a review which I rarely do just to try to spare another tourist the trip out here. If you're looking to eat overpriced average-ish food at a museum then by all means. Just know what you're walking in to.

I couldn't quite remember what our server's name was, but he was not the most pleasant to be around. I could tell he wanted to get our orders in as soon as possible, even though we came in during slow hours, and wanted to avoid talking to us as much as he could and I could not figure out why. Granted, my mother and I were not dressed in our Sunday best like some of the other customers, seeing as I just got out of class and she was running errands all day, but that should be no excuse. \\n\\nWhen we finally got our food (we ordered the smoked salmon tartine, ahi tuna salad, and the coq au vin blanc), the presentation was beautiful and the portions were well-rounded, but in my opinion, the taste was underwhelming.\\n\\nGreat place to experience maybe once if you're a sucker for aesthetics, but I'd personally never come back."},{"name":"by CHLOE. - Back Bay","address":"399 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I've only tried the banana nut bread here and it was disappointing.

Not realized it was a dairy-free establishment, I asked for tzatziki sauce on my kebab and instead got tahini sauce.  When I asked about the discrepancy, the guy at the counter insisted that tahini (sesame paste) is the same thing as tzatziki (cucumber yogurt sauce) which they are not.  When I asked if my kebab came with a side, the guy taking my order responded with, \\"A side of what?\\" as if I'd asked a ridiculous question.

We had heard we'd be waiting a while to be seated, but we must've walked in at the perfect time as we were seated immediately.  My only caveat to this place and haven't been to the one in Buckhead, but it was a very small, tight place as stated in previous reviews.  If they expanded it a bit more, that would be awesome so not only would be it more comfortable, but it would allow more room and people to fit and lessen the wait line...\\n\\nSERVICE = GREAT (seated right away, and upon putting in the order, food arrived in no less than 10mins).\\n\\nFrom the menu, I ordered a seaweed salad (see picture below) as I'm a big fan and it was great if you like it.  It had a good crunch to it and was well portioned; not too small or much.  Thereafter, both my wife and I ordered the \\"Spicy Creamy Vegan Ramen\\".  We both eat meat, but asked our waitress what's a great ramen dish if you will, and she highly recommended this as everyone who works there eats meat and prefers to get this item from the menu.  We gave it a try and it was fantastic.  It was served with thick noodles (if you prefer to have them on the side, they can accommodate) and an assortment of vegetables.  It had a great kick to it (not spicy at all, probably a 2.5 on a 5 scale) but it was great.  I'd recommend this ramen for sure.   \\n\\nFOOD = GREAT (fresh ingredients and plentiful --- you'll be full).\\nIn regards to ambience, it was okay.  It didn't blow me away, but it did have glass mirrors on the wall which I thought was cool; and a decent amount of seats at the bar.  I wasn't impressed as it was tight, but not bad terribly bad.

I did also have a roll of spicy tuna and asked them to make it crunchy. The tuna was chopped up so it was mushy - a HUGE pet peeve of mine. maki rolls should be made with fresh sliced chunks of fish to give it a firm texture.\\n\\nFor who don't know, to make rolls crunchy  they add fried crushed tempura batter which gives the roll a nice crunch and texture.

We ended up ordering the New York Steak (2), Hangar Steak, kid's flatbread quesadilla and Mac N' Cheese and broccolini for the sides.  The portion sizes were small, especially the Hangar Steak, which was cut up into small bite-sized pieces.\\n\\nAfter I bit into my New York Steak, I quickly forgot about the portion size as my steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The Mac N' Cheese and broccolini were excellent as well.  My wife liked the flavor of the Hangar Steak but was unhappy with the portion and the lack of salad served with the steak.

I made her aware of the menu politely and she adjusted the price. After she put all of my items in it got quiet. Usually they tell you your total or ask you to pull forward. She didn't say anything for roughly 3 minutes so I continue on forward. I get to the window, she looks at me I hand her my card, she swipes it, gives me my food and that's it. Literally not a word or a smile...a hello, and still I don't know my total. I'm a pretty relaxed individual so I didn't make a scene but I'll never eat at this location again. I'm super big on customer service and they dropped the ball. Her name tag said Eriona (lovely spelling, I would have told you if your attitude wasn't terrible) but the receipt printed out as Naliyah.

It's a real savior to our future that these places while reinvented live on where other developers would have torn them down. \\n\\nThis space in particular is one of my favorites.  Their Edge Field complex being one of the most diverse this is a close second.  There are several bars, a full restaurant in the middle, movie theater, outdoor courtyard, salt water soaking pool, rental spaces and of course actual hotel rooms amongst the old classrooms that line the hallways.\\n\\nIf there's a wait at one place you just meander and explore until you find another.  They have open license throughout so you can take your drinks with you wherever you go.  The theater is super affordable and plays a mix of adult and kid films.  The soak pool also affordable but limited hours since guests have priority and a cap of capacity.  They have created an amazing place that people love to come to whether for the night or just for dinner.\\n\\nThe only big limiting factor is that it has become so well known it's hard to get a table, or a place in the queue for soaking or even get a drink sometimes.  You can order food in almost any of the bars which is nice but service takes a while in all places and the food is good but not ground breaking.  You come here for the environment, the energy and to get a little lost and enjoy the journey.  So if you have the time or means I suggest coming at off hours and being flexible with how you spend your time there, enjoy what's available and try new things.\\n\\nI won't give away my biggest secrets here but if you do some research and live nearby you can find times and spots that aren't as overrun.  Having friends stay here when they are in town is a treat as well as they get special hours privileges as well.

They have a lower level that looks like as if you are walking in the city of Lima Per√∫. They have beautiful Peruvian handicrafts all around the restaurant. Our waiter was very nice and accommodating. A cool thing I noticed was that all the servers knew how to pronounce all of the dishes and drinks correctly. Looking at the menu it was pretty hard to pick something since I have eaten it all. Some of the plates were changed a bit to make it look more fancy since it is a fancier restaurant.  I decided to order \\"Seco de Pato\\" in English means \\"Dry Duck\\" but trust me it's not. It was delicious and the presentation was beautiful and they even had the small lemony onion and tomato salad that is always served with it.

As soon as we sat down, we were greeted by a lovely lady named Tammy. Super friendly environment! Nice choice of domestic beers on tap and in bottle. The assortment of wing flavors were top notch! Prices are superb too! We got 30 wings and three different flavors (no upcharge on mix and match flavors either!) and an order of onion rings. They offer bleu cheese and ranch for dipping. We chose honey mustard, medium buffalo, and Parmesan garlic. The medium were not as hot as we expected but we were also playing on the safe side. The Parmesan garlic were loaded with Parmesan and garlic flavor. The best by far was the honey mustard! We devoured it up! No wings left on that plate. We asked what sauce they used and they MAKE IT! Where else can you find fresh made sauces?! The wings themselves were crispy and meaty. They don't drench the wings in greasy either. Most places you go will make them a soggy, greasy mess. We tanked over half our wings between the two of us (took home 11 out of the 30.) You walk up to pay after eating and the cashier was awesome.

In addition, I have much experience making pizza from scratch. Let me tell you:  I cannot comment on the other items in their menu, but Brooklyn Pizza's pizza margherita (I had mine with mushrooms, basil, garlic) is an admirable and exceptional attempt at this classic pizza.  It is thin and crispy, but does have a slight chew. Delicious of course (especially with the added garlic!) Within the last 20 days, I have visited this place three times, each time incredibly satisfied.   The third time being their best pizza of the three. The pizza chef was a young man, he did an amazing job. It is so nice having a local pizza place that knows what a good pizza margherita should look like.  Also during those last three visits, the pizza chefs placed fresh basil on top of the finished pizza when I arrived to pick up my order. That's so awesome and it's how every pizza should be finished - with fresh basil on top. I look forward to ordering from here for the foreseeable future."},{"name":"Frank","address":"407 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Here's the thing, this place might have amazing food but I'll never know.\\n\\nWe specifically chose this location because my boyfriend has extreme allergic reactions to gluten, soy and dairy, and we had read on the menu that Frank offered gluten-free options that sounded delicious. It's super-hard for us to find places that he can eat without getting sick from cross-contamination and such, so we were delighted and picked Frank for a Sunday lunch. \\n\\nUnfortunately on Sundays until 4 PM, Frank ONLY serves brunch, and they don't give you the option to order anything else off the menu until 4. Not even for someone with dietary restrictions. \\n\\nThe staff were VERY rude. The hostess was snotty and she and the other hostess were actually standing and gossiping loudly about one of the waitstaff when we walked up. They were complaining about how the waiter didn't like how they were seating their tables, etc. We were disappointed about the brunch menu but I asked if anything on the brunch menu was, or could be altered to be, gluten-free. The hostess stared at me, rolled her eyes and said she wasn't sure but she thought so. I asked if she could make sure because we didn't want to eat there if not. She pointed me to someone else, I don't know if they were a head waiter or a kitchen manager or what. The person informed me that no, there was absolutely nothing on the brunch menu that could be made edible for my boyfriend.

In fact, I was uncomfortable for the majority of the time. \\n\\nUpon arriving, the hostess told us she would be with us shortly so we sat down as she attended to a couple who was waiting before us. We were then ignored by her until we walked back up to the hostess station at which point she finally acknowledged us again. \\n\\nSo...that was a weird start to a weird experience. \\n\\nOnce we were seated, a woman (not dressed like any of the other servers) came up to our table and attempted to memorize our order. A few minutes later, she returned and \\"clarified\\" a few things which were all totally wrong. \\n\\nSurprisingly, our food came out correctly and, a plus, promptly. \\n\\nWe both liked the oatmeal, and I enjoyed my eggs Benedict and grits. My sister ordered the Huevos rancheros which she didn't like (see attached photo: they looked terribly unappealing)...but we did not ask to switch them out--which I'm now regretting. \\nShe also ordered the truffle cheese fries as her side and just asked for them sans truffle oil (so basically, cheese fries...simple right?) and was given plain fries? \\n \\nOur server was short with us and wouldn't wait for us to finish a sentence before walking away. \\n\\nProbably the worst thing that happened was when I asked for 2 cups of iced water (they give you water with no ice when you arrive and never offer to refill it). \\n\\nShe comes back with 1 cup of just ice that had someone's old lemonade in the bottom of the glass. That was the point at which I was completely disgusted by the entire situation. \\n\\nI mentioned it and asked for it to be switched, and she snatched the glass from be without a word and came back with the two glasses of water I'd initially asked for (at which point I was hesitant to drink because of the old dirty cup I was previously given)...but no comment from our server on the bizarre situation. \\n\\n\\nI could definitely see myself enjoying the beautiful atmosphere with a different server, sans the dirty cups and sub par huevos rancheros. \\n\\n\\nUpdate: So I went again today to use the other Groupon I had purchased before it expired (apparently you can't return groupons anymore--I tried) and the experience was much better with a server named Rachel who was attentive, never let our waters go empty, and was friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, and accommodating. We finally got our cheesy truffle fries minus the truffle ha ha. And no dirty cups, yay! \\n\\nI noticed this time that the people clearing and setting tables were wearing the uniform that our previous \\"server\\" had been wearing....I still don't get what that was all about but I had to update my review to say that Hamilton's does offer good service, if you get an actual server! Ask for Rachel and you'll be taken good care of. \\n\\nThe food is genuinely \\"meh\\". I have to say, both times o was underwhelmed.

Ventilation in the restaurant needs to be improved. Neither of our waiters introduced themselves beyond one stating to ask the \\"big silver back gorilla looking dude who is Michael Jai White's cousin\\" for my refill. Shaved calamari was so overcooked the texture was most similar to chewy pork rinds. Hubby said the flavor with the sweet glaze on top of the calamari reminded him of Captain Crunch cereal. The smoked salmon chips were overrated. I don't like what tastes like salty tuna fish over burnt potato chips with a sprinkle of chipotle flavor generally and I most certainly did not enjoy it at Two. The sweet water brined chicken was extremely lackluster like something I could have gotten for half the price at a truck on the side of the road and the Mac & cheese accompaniment was too salty and watery. There was an actual pool of water in my dish. Hubby found his pork shank bland and dry as well and the thing we enjoyed most was the broccoli and cheese. Their most impressive thing we tasted was broccoli... With... Cheese. Saddening to be deemed one of ATL's best culinary displays when I would not return for a free meal with free open bar.

Another impressive detail is about the elevator direct from street level to the restaurant, so you don't have to go through 2 sets of escalators in the busy retail area.  I have given 3 stars for the food because we were expecting 3 options for at least appetizer and main course, but there were only 2 options for each course and only 1 dessert is available.  The food itself tasted good; however, the main course of tuna tataki served on a bed of green salad was served cold and of what it looked like an appy portion.  On a cold winter January evening, we would prefer a warm main course.  The dessert was very simple with 2 scoops of mocha ice cream in puff pastry with caramel sauce.  All these were good for $30 3-course menu, but it did not give us the flare of what this restaurant menu should look like.  One last comment for the staff who bus our table, she scrapped leftover food from one plate to another plate in front of my friend.

There was only one waitress working but she was very friendly, and polite. I ordered a mushroom and cheese omelette, which came with homefries and toast. The homefries were big chunks of potatoes that were seasoned perfectly. My daughter had stuffed french toast with strawberries and bananas and whipped cream, and that was delicious too! I even got an iced coffee to go which was perfect, since most places just brew hot coffee and pour it over ice and it ends up coming out watered down, but this was creamy and sweet.

I wanted to bring up some additional points:\\n\\n-It can be easy to miss when driving by! It's just west of Longbranch Inn. The building next to it basically hovers over it, and the parking lot that used to be right next to it is gone. It's now just street parking. Drive slow, prepare for street parking (not a big deal unless you're used to that lot that was there).\\n\\n-The interior would work well for dates -- it's kinda romantic and when it's darker outside it will be more so, given the candles they have on the tables. The interior has definitely improved from Dandelion's -- I take the lack of children's games and furniture as an improvement, but that's because I'm cold like that.\\n\\n-They remodeled the patio and it looks quite nice. \\n\\n-They have some statement on their menu re: ethics of what they serve, something about their social responsibility. I was too hungry and too in need of wine to read it, but I think it would be of interest to others who share concerns about local/organic produce, etc. \\n\\n- A large portion of the interior is comprised of loooong picnic-like (albeit expensive-ish) tables. The other tables are mostly two-seaters. So, I'm wondering what happens when you have multiple larger parties here, and they're sharing these long tables. I know this is done in other restaurants, in other countries, in other galaxies, but I'm wondering how it's going to work at *this* particular restaurant, with *this* clientele, in *this* location in Austin. My concern is: not well. If you're planning on going with several friends, keep this seating situation in mind! We had 3 people so sat at one of these longer tables. \\n\\n-The management is new, and the service is...developing. They are still unsure about the register and how to split payment, they aren't really smooth with taking orders, etc. It might be shaky for a while.\\n\\n-They are getting their draft beer service up, possibly by today. Right now, it's just bottled beer.\\n\\n-The sandwiches are HUGE and you might consider splitting a sandwich and a salad with folks. Or ordering multiple sandwiches for the group to share.\\n\\n-The ham sandwich was good, but not mind-blowing.

We went to the bar, closed the tab from the self service area and told one of the bar tenders that we are moving and will need a waiter/waitress. A few minutes later, I once again told one of the workers at the register that we are looking for someone to place an order with.\\n\\nDuring the next ~45 minutes or so, the place had gotten pretty quiet and we were one of only a few taken tables left. The waitress who was serving our area (younger girl with dark hair, purple/red streaks and many tattoos) kept walking past us over and over again and completely ignored us time and time again, even after we tried making eye contact with her. What made matters worse is that she kept walking over to the fire pit area right behind us to converse with a patron she obviously knew. This must have happened at least 6-7 times. After literally 45 minutes, we tried to stop her one of the many times she walked passed us. We asked her if we could order drinks. I had never seen the kind of look she gave us. She was obviously annoyed and upset that we dared talking to her. After two of the six individuals started placing drink orders, she started walking away, right as the second person was in the middle of placing the order. He had to get up and almost \\"yell after her\\" to make sure she got the order. The rest of us were not even able to even attempt ordering something. \\n\\nShe came back about 10 minutes later without any drinks and said in a rather confrontational voice that \\"we still have not closed out the bar tab and how she can't serve us until we do so\\". We pointed out that we actually had closed it out a while back. She just gave us another dirty look and walked away without saying a word. She was back another 10 minutes later and confirmed that we were right, without acknowledging anything about us waiting for as long as we had, her being wrong, or anything else. She brought the drinks and once again took off before we had a chance to blink. 4 out of 6 of us were still with no drinks.\\n\\nWe started talking a little and could not help it but to seek out a manager, as we have never experienced this kind of treatment anywhere. I literally felt like we were \\"smelling\\". \\n\\nWe went to the front and spoke to a woman with glasses who told us she was the manager. We explained the whole situation. She seemed baffled, but went ahead and apologized. She proceeded to come over to our table herself, take our order, bring water, etc. She also sent over a male waiter we had not previously seem to check on us and make sure we were OK. In the mean time, we could see the manager passing by our original waitress many times. The waitress was standing near the register and leaning against it, since she did not seem to have anything to do. It did not look like the manager said a word to her. I really hope that she chose to not say anything to her because she did not want to make a scene in front of patrons. She could however have called her to the back or pulled her aside, as I do not believe that having a conversation like this after the night is over is as effective, since the waitress could simply play ignorance, etc. Despite the fact that the manager provided good service herself after being spoken to, I really hope that she did not take the easy way out and never ended up speaking to the nasty waitress. If that is indeed the case, the manager needs to find another job.

The restaurant was just as I remembered it -- popular, packed, and loud with live music and retractable patio doors that open up to reveal the beautiful downtown Atlanta skyline. The most notable difference this time around was the existence of the Atlanta BeltLine Eastside Trail, which runs directly next to the restaurant. This has meant more exposure for Two Urban Licks and more reason to dine here (direct access to the BeltLine).\\n\\nA few things I failed to mention in my original review: This is a cool looking restaurant with multiple bars/counters and various sections of seating, indoor and outdoor, on two levels. The artwork (e.g. painting) and decor (e.g. wall of potted plants) are large and impressive. The center of the restaurant has an open kitchen of sorts with a flame rotisserie. When we dined here, the furniture was definitely showing its age. Our tabletop had marks burned into it from various dishes over the years. The restaurant opened in 2004.\\n\\nReservations are highly recommended. Two Urban Licks is on OpenTable so book your reservations for free on there and earn dining points that can be used towards discounts at any OpenTable restaurant in the future. Despite having reservations, we still had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. I believe this restaurant is (complimentary) valet parking only. I don't recall any self-park spots nearby.\\n\\nHere's what I tried this time around:\\n\\n* Pork Belly ($14) - crispy pickled cauliflower, lentils, tikka masala\\n* Salmon Chips ($14) - smoked salmon, chipotle cream cheese, caper red onion\\n* Burrata ($18) - Pearson Farm peach jam, basil, hazelnuts, toast\\n* Prime KC Strip ($40) - wood-grilled, charred escarole, toasted hazelnuts, brown butter vinaigrette\\n* Bar Steak ($26) - wood-fire-grilled, green beans, wild mushrooms, herb whipped potatoes, chimichurri\\n\\nThe pork belly was good. It was nicely cooked and not too fatty nor greasy (as far as pork belly goes). I liked the crispy, charred exterior and the pickled cauliflower provided a nice contrast of flavors.\\n\\nThe salmon chips were disappointing. I think they may have been sitting out too long before being served to our table. The salmon meat was shredded and served atop potato chips with the other ingredients listed above. The chips were stale/soggy and the salmon was dry and not flavored enough. I think they messed up on this one because one of my friends (and dining companions) said they were better the last time he had them.\\n\\nThe burrata was yummy. It's hard to mess up a good burrata (fresh mozzarella and cream). At Two Urban Licks, they serve their burrata spread over toast with a peach jam and other ingredients. The work of spreading the burrata is already done for you so all you have to do is cut up the pieces of toast and cheese and eat. Creamy, fresh, and flavorful. Recommended.\\n\\nI found the steaks to be a bit underwhelming, the bar steak more than the KC strip. The KC strip was decent, but I guess I was expecting a steakhouse-quality equivalent. This is not a steakhouse. I had my strip cooked medium rare and it came out closer to medium well. The steak itself was nice and thick, lean, with a decent beefy flavor. The brown butter vinaigrette was much needed.\\n\\nThe bar steak was supposed to be cooked medium, but came out a medium rare to rare. The steak was simply too \\"tendony\\" and chewy. It also didn't help that our table was wobbly so when we were cutting into our tough steaks, the table annoyingly wobbled for everyone. Despite the disappointing bar steak, its sauce and sides were quite tasty. All of them.\\n\\nService was fine. No complaints there.\\n\\nWhen the weather is nice, sit on the patio. You should try to request it with your reservation. They have heat lamps for winter months."},{"name":"Roxy's Grilled Cheese","address":"1205 Market St","city":"Lynnfield","stars":"3.5","text":"We went today and it was busy today and there was like no seats.

Then we waited for a painful 30 minutes only to get something we did not order. After communicating to our waitress that she gave us the wrong food, she seemed a bit confused and went back to the kitchen to sort out our order. It turned out that the kitchen somehow thought all of our order had been served (maybe to someone else's table but definitely not mine) so they had to place our order again. I didn't complain knowing this was a new restaurant and people were still in training. So I sat there and waited hoping everything would be Ok. WRONG. after about another 15 minutes, we finally got our Beef Skewers, but instead of 4 skewers and 3 sauces as specified on the menu we only got 2 COLD skewers without any sauce.

It is really to die for, with razor thin gherkins, capers, and a little quail egg in the half shell on the side. Beautiful and delicious. Other standouts include the Tomahawk Ribeye, the polenta, which is the best I've ever had, hands down, and a delightful creamed spinach with a sunny side egg on top. The oysters are excellent as well. Even the bread is a standout. In addition to the food and service, the skill and knowledge of the bartenders is outstanding As good as Drink in my opinion. In fact, the best bourbon cocktail I've ever had can only be had at the Bancroft. Try the Wooden Teeth if you like bourbon. It's not always on the menu, but they can always make you one.

Which was sad because it probably would have been delicious if it weren't for the initial screw up. \\n\\nThe next time I came during dinner time as well, and ordered the Autumn Enchiladas. It could have been good, but the sweet potatoes were way too crunchy and not cooked well enough to be inside enchiladas. The arbol chili sauce made it even worse. I did not finish this plate and went home hungry. I also tried the South Austin Stir Fry which was better but not great enough to order again. \\n\\nThe most recent trip I ordered a cup of the tomato basil soup and the Chick Pea 'Chick'n Salad sandwich. The soup was far too chunky and the sandwich was inedible. It was overwhelmingly balanced with too many onions and celery and nothing else could be tasted. I took one bite and threw it away as it was a pick up order. \\n\\nThe only redeeming factor was that the Garden Nachos with veggie chorizo. I've had it twice recently and it was just as good as the first time. Even the meat eater loved it and devoured it. These nachos are a meal in itself. I really want Bouldin Creek to be better for lunch/dinner options. But as you can see I have tried many times and will have to resort to never getting anything but breakfast here. Stick with the breakfast as it appears they can certainly get that right.

Honestly.\\n\\nThe menu has several delicious apps including lobster wontons, seafood spring rolls, chicken and pork dumplings, and fried goat cheese. We opted for the basil spring rolls because we're mainly non-dairy and it seemed pretty safe. They were yummy and consisted of fresh veggies, soft skin rice paper, curry mustard sauce. It's NOT cooked, so if you're looking for a more \\"traditional\\" roll, I would opt out of the aforementioned. There are also vegan apps such as the fried green tomato.\\n\\nFor the entrees, the mister ordered the lobster fried rice which looks divine (look up pics), and I ordered the pad thai tiger shrimp and scallops (which came served in a pineapple and DID include pineapple chunks in the dish,) however if you're like me and don't like hot pineapples, you can just remove them. They did add a zesty flavor to my meal though, I can't even lie.\\n\\nThe drink menu is excellent. If you're a henny girl and hennything goes, then I would suggest trying the grape smash (which sounds like it could be something you got out of Ray Ray's basement party) but it honestly elevates your taste buds (see my pictures for review.) The sangria is also REALLY good. Next time I will be ordering a long island that is served differently than anything I've seen lately.\\n\\nI honestly can't wait to go back.

I think I probably said that at least 3 times while here and for somebody that never goes out of his way to eat a slice of bread, I was awed by how delicious a piece of bread could be.  Crusty and soft, oily and grilled and just ridiculously flavorful.  Oh and the burrata you're supposed to dip it in is sublime as well.  Coming here with an adventurous group is the way to go.  Sample anything and everything you possibly can and if you don't think you'd love it, just do yourself a favor and try it anyway because I'll just let you in on the hot tip that it will be fantastic anyway.\\n\\nWe sampled the fried oysters, burrata, chicken liver pate, beef tartare, Aleppo prawns, octopus, brussels sprouts, the mussels, beef tenderloin, plancha burger, the sticky toffee pudding, hazelnut layer cake and the apple pie.  And more bread. and a Bird of Paradise cocktail.\\n\\nThere honestly was not a single bad dish of the bunch for me, and considering liver is about as close to anything that I will say I dislike, this was even pretty good.  The beef tartare was out of this world delicious light and fresh tasting, the oysters were heavenly, the burrata flavorful, briny and great, the prawns were very tasty, the brussels sprouts were ridiculously addictive and up there with Uchi and Uchikos sprouts as my favorite ever, the mussels were very enjoyable, flavorful and no funky mussels like I seem to get occasionally, the burger was jaw droppingly flavorul, moist and amazing (bacon is ground into the mix) and the beef tenderloin was really juicy, medium rare and enjoyable but surprisingly one of my least favorites due to how ordinary it seemed in comparison to the bold and creative flavors of everything else.  We shameless hoarded our dirty plates to scrape what liquid remnants we could from them with more bread.  I'd never experienced it before, but apparently you can be embarrassed by how delicious you find something and the ensuing lengths you will go to to take full advantage. \\n\\nThe desserts were all equally good in my opinion and I would have a hard time picking a favorite of the three we tried.  I'd say the apple pie was the table favorite, but I'd lean towards the sticky toffee pudding or hazelnut layer cake.    My Bird of paradise cocktail was enjoyable, but I wouldn't say it's a must try, however.\\n\\nThe ambiance of Launderette is super inviting and bright with large windows letting in lots of light.  The fact that its next to a gas station in the middle of a residential neighborhood just adds to the Austin charm.

The presentation of the food is very southern themed and all in little sep. dishes perfect if you are one of those people like me who hate food running together.  My rating score is sole based on food taste.  This is the area where the restaurant lacks deeply.  I am a southern Alabama girl, so soul food was cooked 2-3 times a week in my home.  Today we ordered the fried fish with corn, fried green tomatoes, and collard greens.   The corn was just okay but I had to consistently pull strings out of my mouth. The fried fish was average. The fried green tomatoes had no taste at all and was battered with what seemed to be breadcrumbs.  The slices were a bit thick and were pointless to eat.  The collard greens were very bitter and had no meat taste.  They seemed to not have been cooked long enough and without any real taste.  As hungry as I was, I could not eat them. From my family, I tasted the Mac n cheese - which was up to standard, the dressing - just NOT RIGHT.. Wrong, wrong, wrong, the black eye peas - lacking flavor, liver and onions - tough and tasteless, and the cabbage which was steamed with straight water only.

I have visited steakhouses all over and I can say that The Bancroft is a fantastic establishment blending an uniquely different steakhouse atmosphere with edgy decor that suits the innovation of the menu and cocktail offerings!\\n\\nThe Bar:\\nThe rectangular bar greets you as you enter the room.  It is lively with seat-back chairs lining the bar along with high top tables and soft seating creating a  warm, living room type atmosphere with a fireplace and a few TVs.  The bartenders are pleasant and knowledgeable of the fully stacked bar.  Don't come expecting to order a Bud Light, craft beers are on the menu along with many creative cocktails and wines.  \\n\\nThe Atmosphere:\\nMost steakhouses are lively with parties celebrating birthdays, a big work deal, reunions, anniversaries or just a special date night out.  Even from a private room; the open layout allows the sounds to carry so you can have your private conversations without feeling like you are exiled or in another restaurant entirely.  The wood tables and juxtaposition of classic art, modern art inspired from the 70s era Warhol period  create the vibe.  You will also see wood; but, not your traditional dark mahogany wood of many steakhouses with waiters in white jackets matching the white table linens; these waiters are less staunchy, younger, and don't need to de-crumb your table because the owners want you to see the walnut tables and feel comfortable in their place.  The staff is friendly, helpful, and well versed in the menu and drink options.  \\n\\nThe Food:\\nSimply put, it is as good as it gets.  With produce and meats locally sourced and prepared, everything from the shrimp cocktail and oysters are fresh.  The salads are available light such as a plate of arugula dressed in a vinaigrette, or a beautifully presented beat salad, traditional Caesar or a wedge with blue cheese.  The crab cakes as a starter are light, flavorful, and not packed with much filler and the steak tartare is excellently prepared.  The meats are over the top.  For two adventurous eaters with an appetite the tomahawk steak is heaven.  The steak au poivre is highly recommended as is the bone in fillet.  If you don't like red meat, no worries; try the blacked salmon, the ahi tuna steak or the crusted haddock.  For sides, the polenta is a must try as are more traditional asparagus, Brussels sprouts, and creamed spinach.  \\n\\nIt will be hard to save room for dessert and if you haven't at least try an after dinner port, cocktail, or coffee.

They seem to be keeping up with the hit list fairly well. Thinking about buying a new game? Try it out first! Have a game but haven't learned how to play it yet? Stop in and they will teach you!  All of this for a $5 library fee and you can stay as long as you like.  You pay for everything at the end with a credit card. They do not take cash so keep that in mind. It makes for a nice Saturday or Sunday with friends. Of course you could stay home and do the same for free but with 100+ games I am sure you will find something new and exciting that you don't already own.  Did I mention, they will teach you how to setup and play.\\n\\nThe decor looks like a typical basement out of the 70's with mismatched chairs and tables.  It adds to the ambiance in my opinion. They have a selection of beer, mead, wine and specialty pop at moderate prices comparable to most bars. I've had beer, mead and pop so far.  All have been good.  I highly suggest the ginger ale! There are also snacks like pretzels, cookies and the like along with some coffees. I've not had any of these so can't speak for them.

This a small intimate space for dining, probably not much larger than the food truck they use to occupy, so I was met with crowded locals waiting in line.\\n\\nThere were only 5 tables in the restaurant, so if you don't grab a spot quick, you will be baking in the hot Florida sun on the patio, or taking your food to go.\\n\\nIt's clear this is a true mom and pop operation and while there seemed to be a skeleton crew to handle the lunch rush, they were so sweet, hospitable and attentive.\\n\\nI ordered a carne asada tortas and three carnitas tacos.  We shared chips, salsa, guacamole and I grabbed a horchata as my beverage.\\n\\nThe salsa was a nice mixture of cilantro, onions, tomatoes and chunks of avocado.  I personally am a fan of chunkier, less watery salsa but I forgave the consistency for the mere presence of avocado in the mix.\\n\\nThe guacamole tasted good and had fresh chunks of onion and cilantro mixed in, but I would have loved to taste a hint of black pepper and ground cumin.\\n\\nMy tacos and tortadas were good, but here is my disclaimer when eating any type of ethnic food.  I expect flavor. I need it and I want it. Both dishes were fresh, there is no doubt about that, but the meat had no piquancy.\\n\\nWhen I come across this problem, especially at restaurants with Spanish cuisine, it's hard to tell if the issue comes from a trepidation from the kitchen, that they might be afraid of rocking people's palettes that can't handle it, or they just don't have the time to marinate or season meat. Either way, it's really hard to rave about any meal that leaves my stomach full but my taste buds feeling like they were left out of the whole meal. There were quite a few sauces on the table lending themselves to a range of mild and tongue tingling hot as my brother-in-law experienced, so you can certainly add some flavor to any dish with those.\\n\\nMy horchata was a tasty and refreshing alternative to soda.\\n\\nI would really love to see the Ocoee Taco Company take a step back from the rush I'm sure they have felt from moving from food truck to brick and mortar and find their happy medium of serving guests and meeting demand, while being a bit more organized in the front of house and really focusing on bringing flavor to the back of the house.\\n\\nI'm always an advocate of local businesses, especially when they are run by such sweet and hospitable people, so I will be back to check on things in a few months.

Tea choices were good, even if tea water was not hot enough to sip away for long. Sandwiches, while 'all' tasty had minuscule amounts of filling, leaving me desperately wanting more savory! The deserts looked pretty but, with the exception of one cookie, they were horrible (stale cake, runny bland pie filling, strange/watery dark chocolate in a shell).

It's a pretty polarizing place.  I agree with most critics who say the donut itself is rather ordinary.  You never get one hot (like Krispy Kreme when they come right off the conveyor) and the base unit can be greasy, as I experienced during my last visit to Portland.  I also concur that the people behind the counter leave much to be desired...rude, and downright obnoxious.  That said, when the base unit is combined with the other ingredients, some surprising stuff can happen.  I'm generally not a fan of donut creativity--but there were a couple donuts in their selection that were great flavor combinations.  Others were absurdly stupid combinations of anything they could find in a grocery store that will stick to a donut--just for the sake of having a donut that's \\"different\\" from other donuts.  I think the popularity of Voodoo--and their success is due more to the novelty of putting breakfast cereal on donuts than the quality of their baked goods.  That also being said, on a good day, many of their fritters and donuts are at least as good as the best donuts in the US.  On my last visit, I took the Texas-ASS donut challenge--attempted to eat their gigantic glazed donut (the equivalent of a dozen) in 90 seconds (I think).  Took me 120 seconds to complete (no prize) and it was actually a very good glazed donut, despite its novelty size."},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great Coffee, Interesting Staff, Parking Lot, Reasonable Prices, Locally Sourced Food.\\n\\n4 - stars in my book!\\n\\nI suggest the mushroom fajitas.

We took a party of 3 there last night because the menu looked great,  but the problems just kept stacking up and up. \\n\\nFirst a \\"medium\\" burger came out obviously very well done. Odd for a place that prides itself on medium-rare burgers. I'm not one to complain about things like burger doneness except when a place is building their business on doing something well. The burger was replaced, but the 2nd one came out without the listed toppings on the menu which seemed strange, but I was HUNGRY and didn't want to send it back again. \\n\\nThen a bun on another burger was obviously stale .... pretty terrible actually. It was replaced with another, different kind of bun. \\n\\nOn to dessert... the creme brulee was the consistency of milk. The custard obviously had not been cooked and/or sat out for a long time perhaps? I'm confused how this could happen.... I know it's not an \\"easy\\" dish to prepare, but shouldn't a restaurant be able to do it?  \\n\\nThe second try on the dessert was just as bad.  Third try they brought a different dessert. \\n\\nAnd then the checks came....  first we were double charged for the overdone burger, and when that was fixed, the sides were on the wrong check. Then once we thought we had figured that out and sent the checks back with the credit card, the receipt came back with an amount that made no sense... was about $15 more than the total of the bills.  \\n\\nIn the end we must've had 15 different checks/receipts, etc. on the table and while the manager came over to check the overdone burger initially and agreed that the food had problems, not once did they offer to take something off the tab or offer something else. For a restaurant that is attempting to establish itself in a new city, I would think they would be a little more apologetic/helpful.\\n\\nI did feel bad for the server.... she was mortified by all of it. \\n\\nThere's no way I could convince any of us to go back to this place. There are too many other great places in Columbus to get burgers. I would have felt a lot better if the manager had come back after everything continued to spiral out of control at our table to apologize/offer coupons/SOMETHING. As it is, I think she wrote us off after we complained about the burger overdone. \\n\\nThe good things:\\n\\n- My Bulleit Bourbon mixed drink was only $5 which seemed reasonable, so maybe this would be a good place to drink? \\n- The sauce for the sweet potato fries was delightful.\\n- I liked the Brussels Sprouts and the craisins with them were a nice touch."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Food is decent, but the quality has gone down over the past few years.

I'm glad I went with this choice, it was exactly what I was craving. The pepperoni was nice and crispy without all the excess oil! (Yay!) Their cheese is a house blend and it was good, but it didn't blow my mind away.. seemed pretty ordinary for non pizza chain standards. The basil complimented the entire pizza giving it a refreshing balance, definitely getting this again! The crust was what sold me, it was thick enough to enjoy it, but it was also light enough to where you didn't feel bloated. It was probably my favorite part of the pizza! My husband ordered the Cannonball pizza, he said it was great but he would probably opt out for something less greasy next time.

Minimal if any decor. There is an open sort of kitchen area at one end where servers get drinks and side dishes. A door seems to lead into the further back area where food is prepared. \\n\\nService\\nFairly standard Korean-style. Friendly but not overly so and not too much attention once the food is brought out, although if you ask they'll bring anything you need including extra banchan (side dishes) at no extra cost. There were two middle aged ladies working who were efficient. \\n\\nFood\\nThey have a fairly expansive menu with lots of things to try. We tried the fried dumpling appetizer which seemed pricey at about $8 though you get a decent number (about 8) of the dumplings which were large. These were hot with a tasty filling, but it was hard to tell if they were freshly made in the restaurant. There was suspicion they might've been frozen dumplings. Then we had the stone pot bibimbop and the LA style kalbi. The stone pot was hearty with lots of veggies though not a ton of meat. It didn't really have much flavor on its own, though. The kalbi was very good; it came out sizzling and was very tender. You get a fair amount though it is pricey.  Sodas are from the can thus not refillable, but you can order iced tea which has unlimited refills. The meal was served with about eight different side dishes including kimchi, fish cake, radishes, spicy cucumber, and more.

These aren't your standard Americanized dishes of sweet and sour pork, fried rice, and broccoli beef. Instead, XLB gives you tender Shangai soup dumplings and soft Taiwanese style steamed baozi packed with tasty fillings like pork and cabbage, hoisin duck, or mushrooms and chives.\\n\\nI am lucky to live within walking distance of this area, and a recent sunny Saturday found us at XLB's doorstep. The decor of the interior is beautiful with traditional Chinese lanterns dotting the ceiling like stars. Gold-painted Chinese zodiac symbols pepper the walls and your eye is drawn to a painting on the backwall of Gordon Liu, a martial arts star of the 1970s and 1980s.\\n\\nMy only gripe with the ambiance: the same indie-hipster soundtrack that plays in almost every trendy Portland restaurant was playing here. I wish that XLB offered modern Chinese music instead. It would complement the decor, lend an air of authenticity, and make the place stand out in a very crowded sea of hip Portland hang-outs.\\n\\nBut the food is why we really came. The boyfriend and I ordered three dishes to share between the two of us:\\n\\nXiao Long Bao - XLB's signature dish that the restaurant is in fact named for. These Shanghai soup dumplings are filled with seasoned pork, ginger, garlic, and stock then wrapped in dough.\\nBeef Ho Fun - a Cantonese wide rice noodle stir fry with beef and bean sprouts.\\nFive Spice Popcorn Chicken - deep fried bite-sized chicken pieces tossed in five spice powder and served with crispy thai basil.\\n\\nThe Xiao Long Bao was simply amazing. Our order arrived with 8 dumplings to share and it was all I could do to not place another order. The warm soup oozed out of the tender dough. I quickly learned to pop the dumpling into my mouth all in one bite rather than slice it into pieces first lest I lose any of the rich, savory filling on the plate. A small bowl of vinegar with shaved ginger for dipping the dumplings provided a perfect compliment to the slightly spicy and incredibly flavorful pork soup filling.\\n\\nThe Five Spice Popcorn Chicken arrived in a generous portion for sharing. The chicken was nicely crisped and spicy on the outside but tender and perfectly cooked on the inside. A spritz of juice from an accompanying lemon wedge and plentiful crisped Thai basil leaves added extra flavors. I haven't had much experience with Chinese five spice, but I loved the multitude of spicy, sweet, and savory flavors in this. I would absolutely order it again.\\n\\nThe boyfriend ordered the Beef Ho Fun because he is not a dumpling fan, or so he claimed at the time. (Yet he devoured half of the Xiao Long Bao and wanted more.) This beef noodle dish was just okay. The beef was overcooked and a bit chewy and the sauce had too much soy in it for my tastebuds. I recommend sticking with the dumplings.\\n\\nOverall, I loved XLB. I will definitely be back for more Xiao Long Bao and I intend to try some of the baozi next time as well. And since, as I said, it's walking distance from my house, XLB can count on me as a repeat customer.\\n\\nTip: The space is small and doesn't offer a ton of seating so it gets crowded at traditional meal times. If you don't want a long wait for a table, either go early or late or grab some food to go. Note that the the Xiao Long Bao is not available to go."},{"name":"Rosie's Coffee Cafe","address":"2330 Sylvan Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Today was very different.

Up until yesterday, the food has been pretty standard. I've been vegetarian for a few years but just transitioned to vegan a few months ago and was planning on navigating the menu by ordering a bean burrito. But, lol and behold, the waiter sets down a vegan menu with 3 items on it. They offered a vegan taco with brussel sprouts, carrots, vegan cheese, et al, a vegan quesadilla with quinoa & green beans & a vegan taco salad. I was skeptical at first because a lot of restaurants simply don't get the vegan thing right. But I decided on the quesadilla and...OH MY GOODNESS! It was the BEST vegan dish I have EVER had at a restaurant! The quinoa was pan seared with garlic and the vegan cheese was melty & PERFECT! It was 5-star restaurant good. Who ever the chef is at this establishment, kudos to you & thank you for adding this dish to the menu! I told the server how great it was and he said he enjoyed it as well and he wasn't vegan. Being a Chef Ramsay fan, it says a lot when the server has tasted the new dishes and can give their experience of the meal.

So this place moved into the old Chili's Building, which Hacienda Real promptly repainted Bright freaking ORANGE! But they still haven't gotten a decent sign put up, so you will have to just hope you are at the right place, which should be easy because as I mentioned it is bright orange. We were seated as soon as we walked in and they definitely did some remodeling, there is a really cool tile work all over and some very interesting light fixtures.  \\nThey seated us and brought us water, chips (fresh and homemade), salsa (very good) and some coleslaw with beans that was actually super tasty! Our waiter came over and got our drink order, checked my ID and made a comment about my height listed on the id. Def could have done without that. You would think I was a short guy or something, but on the contraire, he actually seemed to think he was taller than I was and implied I had lied on my id.  Whatever, it just is not the best way to get a decent tip or retain diners, enough said.   \\nI had the Carnitas Pork Burrito which came with usual rice and beans. My little lady enjoyed the Chicken Enchilada and Tamale combination.  Yeah, it came with rice and beans too.  They brought her out the wrong food, she was eating the enchilada realized she was never going to find any chicken inside it.  The waiter promptly grabbed the extra cheesy enchilada with no chicken and whisked it away only to return with the proper food immediately.  This means that someone grabbed the wrong food and ours was left sitting in the window, no sweat, just one more thing that reflects quality control, if nothing else.   \\nThey had some good Guacamole, nice and fresh and well seasoned.  The Tortilla's were fresh made and the taste reflected the freshness in the both dishes. The Chicken was a tad bland but fairly moist and my Pork carnitas was so hard in places that I had to spit it out. Overall there were definitely some areas that need improvement. But the food is fresh and decently well cooked and place is clean and staff is fairly friendly, pretty much what you would expect."},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Went tonight with my girlfriend and another couple expecting to be wowed at a new hot spot based on the great Yelp and OpenTable reviews.\\n\\nStarted by entering an empty restaurant whose decor is reminiscent of most well-appointed Chinese, Thai, or Japanese restaurants in the area. Our waiter immediately asked how we had heard of the place, which struck me as strange.\\n\\nThus began a night of inaccurate, poorly timed, and awkward service. Two orders were served incorrectly, our waters were topped off constantly (not more than a quarter empty at any time, usually a plus, but this was excessive and bordered on intrusive), and food was described in flowery, adjective-laden (inaccurate) flurries. \\n\\nThe food was slightly better than the service, but not an improvement over any number of neighborhood Thai restaurants. The fusion did not manifest itself in any of our dishes. I would not pin the adjective \\"unique\\" to anything on the menu.\\n\\nThe amuse bouche was a fried mashed potato ball that came out soft and cold.\\n\\nThe crispy beef tasted more crispy than beefy and the chicken in the Siam chicken suffered the same fate. The basil infused jasmine rice lacked even a hint of basil. \\n\\nThe basil roll was the only highlight with a delicious curry mustard sauce. Again, though, barely an improvement over most local Thai restaurants.\\n\\nThe proprietor stopped by at the end of the night and we were, again, asked how we heard about the place. When I mentioned the positive reviews, the proprietor acted surprised -- strange, as no restaurateur would ever deny knowledge of justly-earned positive reviews (quite the opposite, in my experience).\\n\\nThe place certainly wasn't my worst dining experience, but it was far from special, suffering from being way over-sold by its wait-staff and (potentially sponsored) internet campaign. It played a dangerous expectations game and lost. Honestly, we felt duped."},{"name":"Holy Taco","address":"345 1st St","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"3.5","text":"I came in one night for a drink.

We're huge nerds and Kingmakers seemed like a place built for us:  games, drinks, and revelry in general.\\n\\nKingmakers is definitely a little different than your typical bar.  First off, it's clean and well-lit, primarily to accommodate the board games themselves, which often require a little bit of reading, even if it's just reading dice or a card or two.  Secondly, it's definitely family friendly.  The owners were hosting an 'art day' for kids while we were there, with a handful of little kids occupied, creating new 'masterpieces'.  I don't have an issue with that, primarily because the kids were interested and definitely well-supervised.\\n\\nLike most bars, though, there's a cover charge.  At Kingmakers, it's a flat $5 fee, which gets you in and grants you access to their sizable board game library, which sits around 500 titles.  The games themselves range from old classics like Risk or Monopoly, to newer hobby games, including some of my favorites, Sentinels of the Multiverse and Arkham Horror.  Further, the games are organized quite well, with small labels showing how many players a game can carry, what kind of game it is, and what ages might like it.\\n\\nKingmakers has a reasonable array of drinks, with several beers and a handful of wines available, as well as a series of independent bottled sodas.  I do hope that Kingmakers gets a full liquor license sometime soon, as the possibility of well drinks really would open up the possibilities there.  Board game themed mixed drinks?  Yeah, those would sell like hotcakes, I don't doubt.\\n\\nKingmakers does not, however, have hot food in really any sense.  They offer jerky, a few offerings from the Krema Nut Company, and cookies from a local bakery.  Again, a few hot appetizers could go a long way towards bringing in an extended clientele.  But, as is?  Still pretty cool.\\n\\nI'm not in Columbus as much as I'd like, but with the right crowd of gamers, Kingmakers is absolutely a fun destination.

Guess my glowing review is long overdue.\\n\\nHao-Q is truly a neighborhood family restaurant and if you eat here more than once, Hong (the busy, pretty lady greeting guests and processing payments at the front) will probably remember you and offer to get you the same order you had last time.  She knows all of her regulars, whether from dine in, take-out, or delivery, and I've heard her patiently handle a call-in from an elderly customer who was clearly hard-of-hearing, steering him to the spice level he preferred and never becoming flustered with the need to repeat herself a few times. I love that kind of service, and that earns 2 stars.\\n\\nIf you like Vietnamese food, go to that part of the menu. All the pho & vermicelli dishes are great. If you're craving Chinese-style, you have options there, too. On the Chinese side, these would be what (at least in my understanding) are sort of classic \\"Americanized\\" recipes, but they are executed very well, without too much grease and in huge portions (so you have a great leftover lunch the next day, or maybe can split one entree for 2 at dinner).  We seem to stick to Chicken Lemongrass (with extra veggies added) and Jalape√±o Chicken (again, with extra veggies added) - the spice level is always perfect, the sauce never too oily, and the meat of very high quality, so no weird gristly bits. 2 more stars.\\n\\nSoup is pretty much my #1 food group, and the soups of Hao-Q are all tasty and generous in portion. I've tried and liked every one, but I always come back to the crab asparagus ($8, supposedly serves 2).

First bite was into an onion, ugh. I really dislike onions, so I started to gag enough to upset my stomach.\\n\\nI feel like they did it on purpose. The whole meal was suspect. I also ordered some chicken fingers with honey mustard, but the cup of honey mustard was only about a third full. And with the portion of Chili 5 way being tiny (in a smaller container than I remember, and still only half full), it just seems like it was intentional. She also handed me my chili 5 way on its side by putting it in a bag small enough that it could only fit on it's side, so when I pulled it out it made the small portion very evident since it was all squished to the side. I'm very polite and order in a very clear manner, so I can't imagine why they would do it on purpose, but one would have to be really bad to mess up like that on such a small order, and after I confirmed it a second time.\\n\\nAnyway, the reason I felt the need to confirm it in the first place is because they've messed up my orders so many times. Very often it's the onions in my 5 way chili, so I always check that. Other times they forget the cheese on the cheese fries, or put something on my burger I ask not to. Sometimes they just forget an item altogether. If I was lucky enough to get a receipt, I check it to see if I paid for the item they missed, if they did then I go inside so as to not wait another 20 minutes in the drive through, and get them to fix it. The whole point of the drive thru was to avoid going in, so that sucks. They usually forget any silverware and napkins or any ketchup/salt I ask for on the side.\\n\\nThe only time I've been inside this location was also terrible. I went in to avoid them messing up my largish order, so I sat at the counter to order togo. She took my order quickly, but it was literally over a half an hour before I got my food or drink. Long enough that I dozed off for a few minutes and woke up still wondering where my food was. The person who took my order was nowhere to be found, so I had to track down a manager who had my food started then it seems.\\n\\nI love Steak n Shake, but this location is absolutely terrible at order accuracy in the drive thru, especially if you aren't ordering things exactly as they come by default. I literally don't think I've ever gotten it completely correct, which resulted in me coming here less and less, and now I'm swearing it off. If I want Steak and Shake I'll drive to the one near Fashion Square.\\n\\nAlso there is something really weird about the Spicy Chicken sandwiches here at this location. When I order it here it's always really tough, like unchewable tough, and on multiple locations. But when I order it at any other location it's really delicious. Maybe it's old meat? Maybe they order a different quality meat here? I don't know."},{"name":"The Berry Tavern","address":"2 High St","city":"Danvers","stars":"3","text":"I've ordered lunch from here twice now and they are extremely nice.

We waited about 20 minutes but we were ok with that. There is a coffee bar/ bar to order whatever while you wait and their matcha iced latte was the bomb dot com. Someone stole my drink the first time they made it so they happily made another lol. Anyway, I had a really unpleasant encounter with a server/busser though. I was trying to find where to put my empty glass (it's super crowded and not much space to wait or signage tbh) and this guy walked past me and clearly saw I was looking around for a spot. He walked by and I went to the bar and set it on what looked like a bar mat for dirty dishes. Apparently it wasn't and he had been watching and went right over grabbed it and said\\" that's very bad\\". Lol. I told him I didn't know where to put it and I'm sorry and he said \\"yeah next time just leave it wherever\\". Lol again. If he was watching me seeing I clearly needed to put a dirty glass down he could have told me where to leave it instead of me putting it in the wrong place and getting shamed for it. It was really rude to say the least. Our server and hosts were great though and the food I got was delicious even had it later that day too!

The exposed brick, painted animal busts, and wood paneling on the contrast walls were all super hip but also sleek and simple. \\n\\n   We started with drinks, all of which sounded delicious but we settled for the Grape Smash (one of the only Hennessy cocktails I've ever seen on a menu, and I've seen a lot of menus) and my friend got the Sun Spot, a SPICY delicious tequila cocktail, that I later ordered for my second round ÔøΩ? The grape smash was really really delicious.  Despite it being grape it reminded me of Henny and apple juice but like a genuine apple juice/cider with pulp.  It was strong but also refreshing. The sun spot has a pepper floating in it, so you know what you're in for.  It's a savory cocktail with lots of spice but a citrusy brightness at the forefront that masks the tequila. Sip it S L O W L Y, because the spice builds up!  \\n\\nFor food we started with the calamari which was incredibly tender for fried calamari. The breading was heavy but cooked so well it just flakes off the rings. The dipping sauce is a great addition! Then we got the tiger prawn pad Thai and the fried chicken for entrees and GIRL. To get two things from such vastly different worlds of flavor and to have both of them be so delicious we were honestly like \\"why is there not a Poor Calvins in Chicago!?!\\" \\n\\nThe pad Thai had 4 huge prawns which were perfectly cooked and super tender, juicy and delicious.  The pad Thai noodles were exceptional and the sweet sauce gave some relief to the spicy drink but also a great contrast to the char on the shrimp. The fried chicken comes with the lobster Mac and cheese and also collard greens.  I never like anyone's collard greens except my mothers but these were delicious!  They weren't  over cooked and mushy (common issue) and they weren't drenched in vinegar (again, ew!) they were delicious, not too soupy, and very flavorful. The lobster mac and cheese was decadent but not overly rich and greasy.  Lots of different fun pasta shapes which gives it character and large tasty lobster pieces for flavor!

I had the massaman curry with tofu, and it was fine, but I'd put the spice level at a zero. In addition to the typical dishes you'd expect to see at a Thai restaurant, they also have some unique menu items, so this could potentially be an advantage if you're looking for a lot of menu choices.

It was a rainy 2nd Sunday, and I was looking for a place to hit up before checking out the High Museum. This was the only place besides Starbucks that wasn't too formal. \\n\\nI ducked inside and was welcomed by the owner. He told me they have soup, so I ordered the chili. I was about to order a large croissant, but he actually advised me that there was going to be a piece of bread that comes with the soup. In my mind, I thought the bread might be just a dinner roll so I dismissed it. But since he brought it up, I got carb-conscious and sheepishly backed out of ordering the croissant. \\n\\nHe was so right. A piece of bread came with the soup, and let's just say--it was the star of the show. The chili paled beside that bread's amazing flavor and became no more than a dip to show off the its outer crunch and inner cheese ooze. It was like a grilled cheese sandwich in a stick form. So good. It was so big it did fill me up and balanced perfectly with the soup. Anyways, end bread rave. \\n\\nBut I was impressed how the owner just knew I should enjoy my meal this way, and stopped me from wasting money and carbs even though it would've profited him. Highly recommend getting whatever soup is there; it's the cheapest meal option and will not disappoint.

However next time I would probably go with another protein base because I didn't enjoy the smoked salmon as much as I thought. It felt out of place and slightly overwhelmed the dish. As a decorated food ninja, I also managed to try the spaghetti carbonara, which was my favorite bite of the night because it tasted absolutely sublime! \\n\\nHeads up: The pizzas are big (about 12 inches diameter).

The waiter was very helpful, honest, and had a sense of humor. Second time, service wasn't as good. \\n\\nBoth times, I got the Chicken ramen. And I really love the noodles and the broth. It is delicious and hits the spot when I'm craving ramen. However, the second time, the seasoned egg (added as extra) was cold in it. The chicken was also cold in it. It just felt off and like it wasn't fresh. The first time, everything was hot and seemed like it had just been prepared. \\n\\nWe also got the Cha Cha Cha ramen and it was really oily but the fresh garlic that it came with complemented the ramen so well. It is a must-try for garlic lovers. You get a small dish of fresh garlic and you can press your own garlic into the ramen. \\n\\nThere is a decent-sized lot for parking, but you may have to drive around for a while to find a spot since this plaza is so busy. Best part of the location is the Share Tea next door. Go there for dessert or while you are waiting to be seated at Jinya. \\n\\nOverall, I think this place is good. Just somewhat overhyped.

Anyway I ordered the smothered chicken, greens, corn bread and I believe yams. My partner had fried chicken and a couple sides as well. I would go back just for a few of the sides as they were pretty tasty. I wouldn't go back for the rest.

The prices seem very reasonable as well for the amount of food and great quality.

So many looked good that I asked if I could also create my own flight after finishing the one on the menu. Our waitress had to go check if that was possible, which seemed weird to me - if they are offered by the glass and you also offer flights, then I don't see why you wouldn't be allowed to just choose your own wines for a custom flight. Eventually they did let me, so points for that. \\n\\nOverall I tried the Kiwi Pear Sauvignon Blanc, the Strawberry White Merlot, Exotic Fruit White Zin, Green Apple Riesling, Strawberry Watermelon White Shiraz, and the Black Raspberry Merlot. My husband and I both loved the Exotic Fruit Zin best, but the Strawberry White Merlot was my close second. We'll definitely be back to try some of the other ones I was eyeing - Coconut Yuzu Pinot Gris and Pink Moscato in particular. They also have ice wines and ports, which look intriguing to me as well. \\n\\nThe bottles are pretty affordable to take home, starting around $12 for some of the fruit ones, though it makes $7/glass look way too expensive in comparison. They do have Happy Hour with $5/glass, and Wine Down Wednesdays with 5 tastings of a pre-selected flight for $5 too. Ladies night on Wednesdays also has $5 glasses of wine and 1/2 off flights, so I think we'll go during some of their event hours next time. They also offer a fun option to create your own wine which would be great for a party or special occasion.

Before ordering our meals, we spent about two minutes giving an award to another officer in attendance, and we all clapped.\\n\\nImmediately thereafter, I was confronted by an intense, unfriendly woman, who identified herself as \\"the GM\\" of J. Liu.  She told me she wanted \\"no more speeches\\" during the remainder of the dinner.  I asked her why, and she claimed because she did not want to disturb the other diners in the bar, of which there were few.  She had the bearing of a bouncer and was unsmiling and disrespectful throughout our conversation.  I decided not to challenge her because she seemed very angry, and I was afraid she would throw us out of the restaurant before we ordered our meals.\\n\\nToward the end of the meal, I approached the GM and asked her if she would allow our guest of honor to spend about three minutes thanking his guests and offering comments about his career.  \\"Would that be a problem?\\" I asked.  \\"Yes,\\" she said severely,  \\"That will be problem.\\"  She then scolded me for making dinner reservations in the restaurant instead of reserving a party room.  She made it clear that she was forbidding our honoree from saying anything to the table.  She offered no courtesies or apologies, and acted as though we were worthless.  By that time, we were the only diners in the bar, and no one would have been disturbed by the few words our honoree was prepared to offer.\\n\\nI was offended by this treatment.  So, I asked her to provide the name and address of the owner of J.Liu so I could write a letter of complaint.  She refused to provide that information and, instead, gave me her card.  \\"Send it to me,\\" she said.  \\"And I'll pass on the letter.\\"\\n\\nI quietly informed the guest of honor that J.Liu would prohibit him from speaking to our table.  So, this humble man walked around the table and discretely thanked each person, individually, for coming.\\n\\nWe were dignified and properly dressed.  We were not loud.  We were respectful to the staff.  We all paid our bills.  Nevertheless, J.Liu treated us like we were trash.\\n\\nI told the honoree's spouse about the conduct of J.Liu, and she was appalled.

I follow them on instagram (you should too) and read up on the reviews like I'm studying for a final at food school.  Chef  Matthew Jennings and his team do everything well.  And they do in an artistic, innovative, and logical sense.  Except the logic that Team Townsman has is not like my logic.  It's some sort of genius food logic that I admire endlessly.  \\n\\nFirst off - the staff are the bomb.  Every single person that we encountered was smiling, casual, and welcoming.  Our waitress Bree helped us through the menu and struck the perfect balance of giving us time to sit and enjoy but also visiting us at the perfect time.  Every time.  \\n\\nWe sat at the crudo bar which was awesome.  As some say - it's a tad awkward because there is nowhere to rest your feet or legs.  But honestly you soon forget all about that as you watch the entire team get down to business cooking, cutting, slicing, and stirring their asses off.  Good Lord they work hard.   It really gives you perspective to see the hard work that goes into keeping a restaurant in business.  \\n\\nFood - we were very lucky to taste 8 items from the kitchen.  We started with tuna crudo which was a special and it paired perfectly with rose.  Get this if you can.  We followed with a charcuterie.  The boards are an absolute steal at $18; it comes with biscuits, a selection of pickled vegetables, fried pickles, and a family mustard recipe that is sweet & spicy and to die for.  We also had the crispy shishito peppers and, as you may have seen online, the bonito flutters and dances before your very eyes as the flavor molds into the dish.  This is definitely a good sharing option and you can keep it on the table all night because the flavor gets even better as it cools.  The kitchen sent us a nice surprise of pressed watermelon topped with lardo and mint.  Wow - salty, juicy, sweet, and savory.  perfection.  \\n\\nFor round 2 we went with the pullet egg, sparrow carrots, BBQ duck breast, and the mussels with frites.  That duck with the strawberry sauce is a flavor party in your mouth.  It was my favorite hot dish of the night and I'm still dreaming about it.  The carrots are a great accompaniment.  \\n\\nokay - hang in there because I know this review is long but dessert is coming.  And the pastry chef at Townsman was recently named the best pastry chef in Boston.  For good reason.  First of all - service starts with brown bread that is wonderful, and the biscuits on the charcuterie are flaky, buttery, and sexy.  Then you get to dessert.  The menu dares you to try everything.  So obviously you try almost everything.  The olive oil cake is served with olive ice cream.  I don't even like olives in my real life.  But in my Townsman life I love it.  And the strawberry cheesecake ice cream is unreal.  Again - I don't even like cheesecake.  But I like ice cream!  The chocolate semifreddo is smooth like pudding, but textured with pistachios and nuts.  The candy cap ice cream is not what you would expect it to look like.  it sits on a bed of syrup and has a crispy oatmeal hat.  Last but not least we had the special which was a watermelon sorbet which is served with a tiny glass of rose to pour over.  \\n\\nGet yourself to Townsman.

It was sleek, warm, and modern. \\n\\nOur server was attentive but got a little held up at times because he was also tending the bar. (No problem). \\n\\nWe started off with the ahi tuna cups, short rib, cheese plate and the brussel sprouts. \\nThe tuna cups were pretty good, but I was expecting them to be a little more tasty. My girlfriends thought they were on point, though. The short rib was tasty, but nothing out of the ordinary. The cheese plate was delicious and a great size for the four of us. A fine selection of cheeses, some jam, and nuts. Then there were the brussel sprouts...wow! Why didn't we like brussel sprouts growing up? Seriously, these things were phenomenal. Parmesan-y, garlic-y, and overall drenched in goodness. \\n\\nWe also were overindulging in the wine selection which included some half off bottle for happy hour. Our server was caught up at the bar so he missed asking us for a last drink-he was great though and still gave us a bottle half off after the happy hour ended- this was great and made our night! \\n\\nFor dinner I split the Asian Salmon BLT with a friend. I thought it was fine; nothing new to my taste buds and not bad at the same time. My friends got the Bahn Mi which they said was not comparable to the traditional sandwich, but they liked it. The fries which came with both meals were tasty and the sriracha ketchup made them that much better. \\n\\nA strange man began to come up to the window at the end of our dinner and was harassing us and proceeded to come into the restaurant and was seated near us. He continued to make weird gestures and say inappropriate things to us. \\nLuckily my friend and I found the manager and he saw what this man was doing and he quickly escorted him out.

I came here for the first time for a company dinner and again for drinks with a coworker. Both times I left highly underwhelmed. (Is that a thing?)\\n\\nThe first visit wasn't very memorable, and I was focused more on the company and conversation than the food. I recall the tacos being good; I also recall being stunned at the fact that the tacos cost $4.50 a pop and didn't even come with sides. I suppose the prices are typical LO fare, but tacos are supposed to be quick street food and the price is meant to reflect this. Sides like rice or beans are an additional $4 a pop, which is just insane. They also messed up our reservation, although service was good after that. \\n\\nThe second time, two of us popped in for a round of margaritas (or two) and a snack. We sat in the bar area, and after the first round of orders, were ignored for two hours. We had to ask for absolutely everything after waiting to see if any of the staff milling around would notice us - water, a refill of water, a second round of margaritas, food, more water - no one ever stepped up to ask us if we needed anything else or to refill our empty glasses. The high school food runners were more attentive than the server/bartender! The margaritas were fresh-squeezed but had far too much simple syrup, and even though I requested directly from the bartender that the second round be less sweet (yep, had to order drinks directly at the bar after being ignored for so long) they showed up just as sugary as the first time. The ceviche we ordered to snack on was decent, but the portion was a ramekin smaller than the palm of my hand (and I don't have large hands, people) with maybe three prawns chopped up. \\n\\ntl;dr Holy Taco is wildly overpriced with inattentive service, decent food in small portions.

Bite the head off of one of the pickled jalape√±os in the basket and pour that spicy juice on top before you bite in and you'll be pleased that you did. Fried in peanut oil allowing for a tasty high heat to keep the flavors and juices in but make a happy crisp on the outside. The breading is peppered and seasoned beautifully to give it an amazing taste.\\n\\nThe truffle Mac & Cheese is also divine. A true hearty heavy Mac and you'll love it. The truffle oil adds a nice touch to the flavor profile. The serving is enough to eat all alone not as a side. So if you're with a group get one to share between two or even three people. \\n\\nThe Mexican corn on the cob is a surprise.

The chicken is filled with all the flavor of Peruvian food. I have only tried Pervian food one other time but the flavors are amazing.  The cilantro rice and Black Beans compliment the chicken well and the salsa just enhances the flavor exponentially!! Seriously the combination of the salsa and the Smokey flavor of the chicken was incredible.  Inka Chicken took simple dishes and combined them to make the flavors compliment eachother well.

Between the history, the variety, and the quality (both of service and the goods), this is one of the finest businesses in the McMenamins Empire.\\n\\nEvery time I walk through the doors at the Kennedy School, I feel like Ebeneezer Scrooge visiting his childhood school with the Ghost of Christmas Past (except in this scenario I'm not cranky and I'm being escorted by the Ghost of Drinking Lots of Beer). This was an actual functioning school for about 60 years prior to McMenamins taking over in the late 90s. The halls still proudly display photos and other artifacts from the mid-20th century schooling days.\\n\\nI'm really into the number of spots to hang out here. You can honestly think of a night at Kennedy School as a single-location pub crawl. Have dinner at the courtyard, go to a movie in the theater, get a quick drink in the honors bar or smoke a cigar in detention, then play some pool or shuffleboard in the Boiler Room. And just like most McMenamins joints, the 3-6 happy hour applies across each room and restaurant. Oh, and did I mention you can stay overnight? In a classroom?\\n\\nI see some previous reviews commenting on the poor quality of McMenamins food. I hear that. It's fine, but maybe not worth what you're paying at many locations.

Don't expect gourmet, but expect good food and great drinks.\\n\\nI've never spent the night here, so I can't speak to the hotel experience.

Apparently the location we went to was the iconic, more popular one, but we were lucky for two reasons -- one, the line was only 15-20 minutes (definitely not as long as it could be), and two, we found parking RIGHT in front of the doughnut shop.\\n\\nWhile we were waiting, I was able to take multiple pictures of the \\"Voodoo Doughnuts\\" sign and see the doughnuts being made and decorated in the back window. For those who don't know, VD is famous because of their extensive doughnut menu, and for the fact that they're open 24/7. So, if you get a doughnut hankering at 3 a.m., you know where to go. This location, however, is also notorious for having long, winding lines. I was grateful that we didn't have to deal with any of that on a typical Saturday night around 8:30 p.m.\\n\\nBecause I perused the VD menu before coming to the shop, I had a general idea of what I wanted. The only improvement I would suggest is actually having the contents of the different doughnuts somewhere on the menu. There are just SO many flavors to choose from that only the different doughnut names are on the menu ... but you don't really know what's in them, unless you know what you're looking for. The revolving doughnut display cases are aesthetically pleasing, but you also don't know/can't see the names of the doughnuts in there. Having actual descriptions of the doughnuts somewhere may help speed up the ordering process for VD first-timers. But our cashier was more than helpful in answering our questions and helping me to solidify my decisions.\\n\\nMy friend and I ordered a few doughnuts for ourselves, as well as for some of our other friends. Here's what we ended up including in our stash:\\n\\n\\"Old Dirty Bastard\\": The ODB was the doughnut that I was absolutely waiting to get, as it features my favorite combo -- peanut butter and chocolate. This raised yeast doughnut came topped with chocolate frosting, OREOs and peanut butter. It was just as glorious as I imagined it to be. The creamy peanut butter drizzle was delicious and paired nicely with the chocolate frosting (though I am never opposed to having more peanut butter),and the doughnut itself was completely covered in the crushed OREO cookies. This treat was love at first bite and was one of my favorite doughnuts from the variety we ordered.\\n \\n\\"Miami Vice Berry\\": We ordered this doughnut for another friend who usually opts for fruitier flavors. It featured a raised yeast doughnut with vanilla frosting, blue raspberry powder and pink sprinkles. The friend we ordered this doughnut for said that it reminded him of a birthday cake--in appearance, not flavor--and that it tasted a little more dense than the \\"Dirt Doughnut\\" with OREOs. He still really enjoyed it and said he would order it for himself again.\\n \\n\\"Dirt Doughnut\\": This was one of the \\"plainer\\" doughnuts that we ordered, as it featured a raised yeast doughnut with vanilla frosting and Oreos. We brought this one back for another friend who REALLY loves OREOS and prefers vanilla frosting over chocolate. He said the doughnut was light and the vanilla frosting paired really well with the generous chunks of OREOS on top ... almost like the perfect cookies 'n cream doughnut.\\n \\n\\"Marshall Matters\\": I ordered this doughnut (one of several) for myself and I was pleased to see that it was generously coated with M&Ms. It just featured a plain cake doughnut topped with vanilla frosting and mini M&Ms. I probably would have liked the doughnut better if it were coated in chocolate, but I liked the sweet lightness of the vanilla frosting, coupled with hearty crunch of the candies in every bite.\\n \\n\\"Memphis Mafia\\": I didn't get this doughnut because the cashier told me that it definitely sported a strong banana taste (it consists of fried dough with banana chunks and cinnamon sugar covered in a glaze with chocolate frosting, peanut butter, peanuts and chocolate chips on top). However, the featured doughnut of the day was very similar -- it was a molasses doughnut in the same fritter shape, covered with a cinnamon glaze and chocolate chips. I did decide to order one of these, and I'm so glad I did, as it turned out to be one of my favorite doughnuts from our stash. It was heavier than some of the other doughnuts and it was definitely larger (and more expensive) because of the apple fritter-like shape. There also seemed to be more frosting on this doughnut, but I have an extreme sweet tooth and didn't mind the added sweetness from the heavier frosting and the chocolate chips. If this doughnut is ever featured again, I would order it in a heartbeat."},{"name":"Ploy's Thai Food","address":"7309 SW Garden Home Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This was pretty good Thai food.

I felt like I needed to write this review due to the incredible service I witnessed during my meal. My experience was overall filled great service and pretty good ramen, but the staff's attitude is really what makes this a 5 star.\\n\\nFirstly, when being sat at a table, your waiter will yell out \\"irasshaimase!\\" which will be repeated in unison by the rest of the staff. This does a good job of setting a positive atmosphere. For me, my server was Bilby, who promptly greeted my party with a smile on his face and a standard introduction of greeting us, telling us his name, and asking if we had been here before. After giving us a few minutes to order he came back in an average amount of time to allow us to find something to eat. I ordered the Spicy Umami Ramen under the tonkatsu section of the ramen tab on the menu, which was very easy to understand and had some helpful pictures of recommended items. \\nHowever, while we were ordering, the table next to us, which was rather close due to the cramped tables, started to make the most ridiculous commotion amongst themselves. This family had decided to create the biggest mess and continued to ask Bilby, who also was waiting them the most ridiculous questions such as, \\"is the egg raw?\\" When it was clearly soft boiled and completely safe to eat as an over medium fried egg. But Bilby kept responded very politely and with a smile on his face. His professional attitude kept shining as the family started to ask for Togo boxes for the massive amount of small dishes and ramen that they ordered. Bilby swiftly begin to box up all the food for them only to be stopped by the father who demanded that his daughter be given fruit which wasn't on the menu, along with their ice cream that the family asked why it hadn't been brought out at the beginning of the meal for some otherworldly reason. While most waiters would be pretty much fed up, Bilby, with a smile on his face, brought out ice cream and a free popsicle for the girl who wouldn't stop crying who never got taken outside by the parents. While this charade went on and on Bilby kept a great polite and professional attitude. To make this worse, these people were foreigners and didn't leave the poor guy a tip. \\n\\nNormally, I would not go into such detail on good service but it was so outstanding that felt the need to highlight his incredible tolerant and exemplary service to the most difficult of food service customers. So, if you happen to get Bilby or any of other of the great staff at JINYA, just know you're in for a solid dining experience. \\n\\nOkay, now that that is cleared is up and noted, food here is great. The slightly non-traditional Japanese ramen noodles are perfectly al dente, broth is complex in just the right way with appropriate spice levels of chili flavor. But, I wish there were chashu pieces included without the need to pay for more. And, perhaps there could be more bokchoy included in the bowl to provide a little bit more veggies to the dish for I feel as if two is a bit weak. I did order one kaedama because I was starving at the time and left very satisfied! \\n\\nOverall incredible display of service by our waiter Bilby and good ramen!

My previous experiences have always been good, and a friend of mine had a craving for it so I was excited to head back to one. \\n\\nFirst off, the wait was about a half hour for a table of six, which on a Sunday night is understandable.  The waiting area was pretty roomy and had seating so that was nice.  After sitting down finally, the waiter came and was incredibly friendly. No real problems whatsoever.  The problems came more from some of the food.  \\n\\nI ordered the whiskey glazed sampler, which consisted of ribs, boneless wings, and fried shrimp. The wings were definitely the best part. The shrimp had the tails still attached, which can be annoying when you just have the urge to just pop the little things in your mouth.  The ribs were petty tasty though.  The other appetizer sampler was a little bit of a hit and miss too.  The boneless BBQ wings and the mozzarella sticks were a big hit at the table, but the loaded potato skins were a bit dry for most, even after a large helping of sour cream with it. \\n\\nOur dinners were the main reason for the three stars though.  I myself didn't really have a problem with my BBQ chicken salad, other than the fact that it was a huge salad but they weren't very generous with the amount of BBQ ranch dressing that they first gave me.  Luckily our waiter was very accommodating and brought out plenty more of it. \\n\\nOther complaints around the table included a salmon dinner that really didn't have too much salmon considering it was 17 bucks.  A chicken and fettuccini Alfredo where the Alfredo sauce was way too runny. A Parmesan crusted chicken that was slightly burnt on the outside, fouling the taste of the breadcrumbs a bit. And the occasional long wait for a drink or two.  \\n\\nWe ended up trying a couple desserts.  The donut cheesecake was good.  A bit disappointed that it was just an average tasting cheesecake with just two small donut holes skewered into it with a toothpick. Maybe me expeditions were just a bit too high and I've been spoiled with all the inventive milkshakes and giant sundaes I've been seeing on most menus lately, but the choices seemed pretty lackluster.  The Oreo dessert was tasty, but the best had to be the brownie.  It came with regular vanilla ice cream but the brownie was so warm and indulgent, and the spoon went through it like butter.  Really great dessert.  Could have been dressed up a bit more, but I highly recommend it.\\n\\nOverall it was a pretty average experience. Not amazing, not terrible.  Hasn't sullied my opinion of Friday's for me (I still usually enjoy their food), it just may be a while before I stop by one for a meal as there are so many other cool places to try in the Orlando area."},{"name":"Santouka Harvard Square","address":"1 Bow St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"So many ramen options in Boston nowadays, and I'm happy to cast my vote for Santouka as the best ramen place in Boston and around!

Parking is available in the back. \\n\\nThe menu is just as small but fairly understandable given how new they are. I would like to come back once they expand their menu. Maybe when they have an alcohol license and some gyoza?\\n\\nI ordered the miso ramen and had expected to taste miso. Unfortunately it was mostly sesame. Don't get me wrong. Sesame oil with noodles is hella delicious, but not exactly what this place was advertising. My friends ordered tantan men and they too tasted mostly sesame. It was a bit of a disappointment for us. \\n\\nAside from the broth, the noodles, eggs and pork were delicious.

The interior looks pretty similar, but has some new greenery and art hanging. The place was filled up which is always a good sign. One of the things that we love about this spot is that it feels intimate even when all the tables are full! The space is bright, homey, and inviting. \\n\\nNow let's talk about THE FOOD! \\n\\nEVERYTHING on the menu was good. We decided to share so we could try a bunch of items. This is hands down our new brunch spot. Not only is it affordable, but the servings are generous and DELICIOUS!! \\n\\nOn Sundays, you must have a Caesar, right? It was so good that I had to order a second...seriously one of the best Caesars I think I'd ever had. The spice ratio was perfect (hello horseradish!) and it had all the fixings. \\n\\nHashbrowns, hashbrowns, hashbrowns! These were the perfect side to many of their dishes. They were SO crispy on the outside but still soft on the inside. They also added a secret ingredient - Parm cheese. How can you go wrong?!\\n¬†\\nThe breakfast sandwich comes with a sausage patty, which had the perfect amount of seasoning. The exciting part of this sandwich was the hashbrown INSIDE the sandwich. It gave the perfect crunch! Definitely the ultimate hangover breakfast choice. \\n¬†\\nThe next dish lived to its name . \\"The Classic\\"  came with a couple pieces of sourdough toast, scrambled eggs, and bacon. YOU GUYS, let's talk about this bacon. It was crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle, with a subtle hint of maple sweetness. The portion was also very generous for this dish! \\n¬†\\nI love myself a good Hash, so I was very excited when I saw two options on the menu.The veggie option had a good helping of veggies which were seasoned to perfection. The corned hash was delicious too! It came with one poached egg but I would recommend that you order an additional poached egg OR a side of hollandaise that you can pour all over that goodness.\\n¬†\\nSpeaking of hollandaise... DA-YUM. Everyone knows you can't have Bennys without the hollandaise. The colour of the sauce says it all. Vibrant orange = damn good farm eggs!  What I really liked about the Bennys is that they weren't overly rich! It's a very solid breakfast choice!\\n¬†\\nFrom Savoury to Sweet!\\n¬†\\nThe french toast was delish! The key to this dish was the perfect texture of the bread. The crunch ratio was PERFECT! The homemade berry compote was juicy and flavourful. The serving size was generous for this dish.\\n¬†\\nNow my favourite dish (and the one I was expecting to like the least). This was an absolute surprise! The chia quinoa bowl was unreal. Not only does this bowl satisfy the sweet tooth without eating a boatload of sugar, but it's HEALTHY! The flavours of this dish blew my mind: creamy, coconut, roasted walnuts and  with a refreshing dollop of that yummy berry compote. I will return again and again just for this dish alone. You need to add this to your list.\\n¬†\\nThe service was great! The food was even better! We will be back."},{"name":"McMenamins Kennedy School","address":"5736 NE 33rd Ave.","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Last Friday I went into the Gift Shop to see if barrel aged coffee was still in stock ends up they were out.

Absolutely agree if you live anywhere near here or are visiting near Atlanta you must go!!! I took my wife here for her birthday, the host Jim graciously wished her a happy birthday as we walked in and stamped a HAPPY BIRTHDAY! On her menu, that we got to keep! We ate a lot and still wish we had more stomachs to fill up;) \\nThey have complimentary rolls with melted butter and fleur de Sel on top, soft and airy delicious perfect rolls, the best I've ever had!\\nWe then started with the salmon crudo, great presentation and portion. With jalape√±os,lime, local peach and a bacon crumble finished with fresh basil. It was light feeling even though it was a rich piece of salmon with bacon! Good textural contrast between the crisy crumble and the delicate fatty fish. The lime's acid kept it from being too rich and the jalape√±os were just enough spice.\\nWe had shared next the calamari, I don't order calamari normally because I don't like greasy rubber bands! However with the rave reviews of the restaurant and the garnishes listed on the menu(I Love Aji Amarillo) I had to try. The calamari was super tender on the inside with a crispy not greasy really well seasoned flour outside. Served with an Aji Amarillo creme fraiche sauce, toasted peanuts and fresh cilantro to garnish was great!\\nNext we enjoyed the octopus man was it good! It was glazed in a spiced honey which to me felt real southern and I loved how the salty caper remoulade, with the pickled carrots, and mustard seeds really brought the whole dish to a successful composition. They finished the tender glazed octopus with fresh parsley which added a very needed herbal fresh component to the strong and assertive flavors on the plate!\\nAs far as entrees go I was extremely intrigued when I read \\"DUCK FAT POACHED SWORDFISH, short rib, kohlrabi, horseradish\\"\\nHonestly I hate swordfish, and I've tried it many times because I didn't think suck a magnificent looking creature could taste so bland and dry all the freaking time. But until tonight that has been an absolute truth, unfortunately! \\nHOWEVER TONIGHT MY LIFE HAS CHANGED!!! THIS DISH IS REVOLUTIONARY IN ITS SIMPLICITY YET COMPLEXITY!!! The chef had the audacity to put swordfish and short rib on the same dish! A heavy hitting unctuous beefy meat, next to a usually dry fish. But let me tell you the swordfish undoubtedly wears the crown as the king of the plate! It's meaty tender juicy insides perfectly poached for 7minutes in rendered duck fat placed on top of shredded braised short ribs and a creamy kohlrabi pur√©e, lightly marked on the grill for a kiss of smoke and beautiful cross hash marks. They finished with microplaned fresh horseradish root, parsley and dill! The dill was unexpectedly well placed flavor component for me! \\nMy wife enjoyed the snapper dish, another great recommendation from our server Kasha, who let me mention now, was very gracious, honest, and timely with everything we needed, she also was FIVE STAR WORTHY in our opinion. Perfectly pan seared skin on crispy snapper over grilled corn with saut√©ed mushrooms and bacon with walnuts. I tasted a bite and know I would have been extremely pleased had I ordered this as well!\\nBefore dessert I had used the restroom, and noticed as I finished washing my hands there were no paper towels, I was a little surprised how everything at this restaurant was beautifully thought out! Everything from the clean welcoming looking raw bar with fire oven, the white painted brick with the wood accent wall. The marvelous bar whose lights around the rim reminded me of a movie theater banner. To be left standing there with wet hands opening a bathroom door. As I stepped out of the bathroom there was Jim with the key to his utility closet checking all the bathrooms to make sure that they were up to par. He apologize greatly, knowing the bathrooms needed to be checked and the timing couldn't of been better.

The decor of the restaurant was great and that was the only thing that was good.  We had a party of 12 people which they couldn't accomodate and we have made the reservation prior.  So they sat us at two separate tables and we had yell across the floor to each other.  Half of our party got there at 8:15 - we waited for our waiter for 20 minutes just to get our drinks.  then we waited another 25 minutes to get our drinks.  The rest of our party got there around 9pm.  They waited another 30 minutes to get their drinks.  We asked our waiter to bring bread and butter while waiting for our food.  Waited 45 minutes for that - he told us that the bread was baking in the oven.  when the bread finally came in it was cold.  when we asked him why, he told us that it's a special kind of bread!  A couple of people in our party ordered their wedge salad.  They use hearts of romaine lettuce for their wedge salad which is no big deal but the parts they use are the parts that people throw away (the inside of the romaine lettuce).  the salad leaves were bitter.  they forgot to put tomatoes on my salad and when i asked him about it, he brouhgt me tomatoes in a little dish for me to add them to my salad.  If I am paying $8.00 for a salad, I expect the chef to fix my salad in the kitchen.  $2.00 extra to add chicken - don't waste your money.  they bring you 5-6 pieces of chicken lunch meat that won't even make one circle of the lunch meat.  At 10:30 at night - we still didn't have our food.  We asked for a manager - she said that they will push our food in front of the line and that's after 2.5 hours of waiting!  The whole party said that after the service and the food we have tasted so far we just wanted to leave.  The restaurant management staff refused to discount anything due to the lack of service.  And wait for this one...  they made us pay $20.00 in gratuity for the service we didn't even get.  They were rude, totally unprofessional and i can guarantee that they will not be open for a very long time - the same fate awaits them as Von Jazz.  We didn't evey get an apology, they ruined our night and I have never been treated like this in my life the way they treated us, expecially for such moderately expensive restaurant located downtown Columbus.  I am definately reporting them to the BBB and even considering about taking them to the small claims court.

A piece of yellowtail in a very spicy sauce. You can either eat the yellowtail and then shoot the sauce or just shoot the whole thing. This was good, but you have to enjoy spicey. If I go again, I would skip this to focus more on sushi and sashimi. \\nKatana platter - 10 pieces nigiri. This is ten pieces of the chef's special for the evening, so it's always changing. The menu indicates no substitutions, but when we indicated that we didn't eat beef (wagyu was on the menu) they made a substitution without a problem. The fish was fresh and delicious. What really sets katana apart is the presentation. Beautiful stone dishes, edible flowers, carefully rolled rice. These guys understand that we eat first with our eyes. $35\\nSashimi platter- 15 pieces of sashimi. Again this is chef's choice, but you can make requests. We had yellow fin, blue tail, salmon, etc.  The blue fin was a spiritual experience. Again, the presentation was so nice we enjoyed this twice-once with our eyes and once with our mouths. \\n\\nThis is a real sushi bar with chef's who care about and are good at what they do.

We do this at a every restaurant  we eat at. The hostess told us she would but only because they weren't busy and that they reserve larger tables for larger groups. Either do it or don't do it, but acting as though you are doing me a favor is always off putting. At great restaurants, hostesses have always smiled and taken us to the table requested.

The interior is an old southern house with memorabilia on the walls. The space is massive in side, but however, parking is limited. Don't park in the street next to the place or else you will get a parking ticket. \\n\\nI wanted to check it out due to the hype, but however, what I found out was that it's a southern cuisine place with nothing special standing out about the dishes. \\n\\nCorn bread is dry. Really dry and tasteless.\\n\\nWhat I had with group was:\\n1. Fried crawfish\\n- It's a fried crawfish and nothing special about it. It's done right, but nothing special or unusual style is added to it\\n2. Meatloaf\\n- It was ok. I didn't notice anything special in the ingredients. It's very basic and I didn't notice any rice, veggies, or etc. except the green veggie type. It was quite heavy though and dense. \\n3. Chicken Dumpling\\n- Small bowl and very dense dough (dumpling) and not enough chicken, however good seasoning \\n4. Shrimp and Cheese Grits \\n- Heavy but good and a lot of cayenne or paprika  powder\\n\\nThe sides:\\n1. collard green\\n2. fried okra\\n3. steamed cabbage\\n4. mac and cheese\\n5. Brunswick stew\\n6. rice with gravy \\n\\nAll the sides were nothing out of the ordinary\\n\\nOverall, I thought it was a bit overpriced for the food you get. The dishes were around 12 to 15 dollars, and it's definitely something you can make with 8 dollars or so. The dishes stick to the traditional southern hearty meals, but that's what you get. If you expect them to display some special culinary skills, you should go to J.C.T. Kitchens and not Mary Mac's. This place provides staple southern food and sticks to the tradition. However, I just wouldn't pay 12 to 15 for these meals because literally, I can just go to Kroger or Publix and buy some ingredients and make them myself. \\n\\nThe food is heavy because of the butter and other fat the cook uses for the dishes.\\n\\nIt's one of those one time places where you don't need to keep going back but you go for the experience or to say you were there."},{"name":"Rosie's Coffee Cafe","address":"2330 Sylvan Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I'm giving two stars so that the owners read this.

It was about as big as a kid sized serving at McDonald's. Also, why do bars insist on making drinks with sour apple mix? I ordered an appletini and instead of using regular apple pucker, it was sour apple mix in a glass that wasn't a martini glass.

We'd been many times before, stopping often particularly when it first opened, thanks to the tvs and cheap beer that make it the closest sports bar to Tech campus.\\n\\nThe food is all decent, especially when you considering that this is college food.  But I've yet to find anything truly special.  Speaking of special, they have two everyday special combinations: $4.50 for a slice of cheese and a house salad, and $5.50 for a slice of any specialty pizza and a greek salad.  This is usually what I get.  That and some of the garlic knots.  But for some reason, I was thinking that a sandwich or something new could be good and opted for the Gyro with beef.  Now I know a good gyro is lamb, not beef (or chicken, the other option), so I should have known better than to order this, but whatever.  And actually the top portion of the gyro was good.  But by the time you got to the bottom of the pita, there was some kind of sauce that tasted like sour cheese... so  just ate the top part.  The side salad is a good portion, but it's mostly iceberg with peppers and onions.  The vinaigrette comes in little cups on the side, making it easy to tell that it's a home-made red-wine and herb vinaigrette.\\n\\nThey get points for draft beer, tv's, hookahs, cheap pizza.   The lose points for flavor and service, since it can get busy and they can easily forget about you.

As I checked over my shoulder constantly to make sure I wasn't about to get stabbed and mugged, I headed into the place because its not like I have a lot of options to use the restroom in the middle of no where downtown Boston. \\n\\nI order a few beers and a peperoni pizza.  Let's see if the basics do the job.  \\n\\nPizza was fantastic.  Very greasy but VERY VERY good.   Then again maybe I was too drunk to notice it wasn't the greatest ever.   Which I found out the next day to be true.  Atmosphere alone was worth it.  Nice bartender who thought I was overly drunk and lost was nice to me.\\n\\nDay 2 (insert Law & Order remixed by Skrillex (keep in mind I hate Skrillex's wump wump crap ass music): Bar was lively, but not TOO lively.  Good mix of people in here eating and drinking.  A group of about 5 were sitting at the end of the bar and my friend and I sit down to have drinks near them about two seats away.  Then \\"The Douchebag\\" sits down next to me.  I'll get back to him later.   So my friend and I are having a conversation just bs'ing and having our first round of drinks debating on getting a pizza or something else.  That was when the \\"The Douchebag\\" next to me just joins in our conversation as the creepster had been listening in the entire time like he was a part of the conversation.   Well, as to not cheapen this review any further I pounded down 3 more beers just suffering listen to this douchebag ramble on about how I'm an A-hole and all this other stuff.  Finally the bartender starts paying attention and kind of gets the guy to back off but at that point I was ready to leave.  So we did and I may go back one day.

Food is pretty decent, salmon entree is a little overpriced, however thats a diff story.  I should've taken heed as to what other cooks were mentioning about the Owner \\"Frank\\" and how he treats his employees.....i brushed it off and thought nothing of it.  Give everyone the benefit of the doubt so to speak.  I heard stories from the other cooks, but didnt believe it.  However last sunday, i worked there, great teamwork from everyone, food is leaving the kitchen headed to guest in great times.  \\"Good ticket times\\" we'd say in the kitchen.  Upon approaching close, I did what every cook should do, clean your station, flip your empty pans, restock them that sort of thing.....trash, sweep the floor......you get the point.  At 3:05 i asked the Owner Frank for my things so I could leave \\"which they keep in a locked closest during your shift\\", this guy went absolutely ballistic upon for my things so i could leave.  He insisted that i didnt do my job correctly or i didnt help the team enough, so i calmly asked him to go ask the other employees and this is damn near after he cussed me out and im still being humble, he refused walked into his office, came out 1 minute later and yells have a nice life as im sweeping the floor.  I was completely befuddled and shocked to the point where im thinking to myself whats going on here.  And low and behold i finally understood what the other cooks meant, this guy is emotionally unstable and rude as they come as an owner as well as in the back of the house.  Actually does talk to his employees like shit, treats them like shit and if you dont agree with something the guy says, all hell does in actuality break loose !!!! Shocking, i know.  Last but not least, you should treat people how you want to be treated and not yelling at them, talking down to them like their a piece of crap.  If people knew the way this guy talked to his kitchen staff, you'd walk the other way......no one deserves this treatment, people already have enough on their plate to deal with.  I hope this guy \\"Frank\\" changes his attitude and work ethic and learns to treat his kitchen staff with respect,  this is the worst owner/ manager ive ever dealt with in my entire career as a line cook.

Great NY style pie with perfect crust that has that great combination of crispness and chew that makes great thin pizza. Their sauce is fantastic, with a slight sweetness but a great flavor of Italian spices. Their prices are a little higher than most other places, but the best pizza in Austin is worth the price. We started with a small Caesar salad that ended up being large enough for us both to share. It came with two of their hot, tasty garlic knots. Yummy. \\n\\nThe pepperoni pizza we ordered was simply perfect. It was cooked perfectly and even at the end, when it had cooled off, it was still the best pizza I've had in Austin. That is the true mark of a great pizza to me. If it is still delicious cold, then it is a great pizza.

Initially, our plan was to just grab a drink at the bar since there is no required minimum there, however, the bar was totally full.  It worked out well though, as there was a live jazz performance in the dining room, which was a lovely setting for a nice visit with old friends.  I ordered the bananas foster cocktail which was as decadent as it sounds.  For dinner I ordered one of the main salads featured on the menu.  The ingredients were fresh and high quality, making it a nice light option.  I went with a lighter option for dinner because I knew I was going to be ordering the Boston cream pie for dessert.  When in Boston, I felt I must at least try one cream pie.  The dessert was wonderful!  The plating was beautiful and it tasted just as good as it looked.  Our server was friendly and accommodating.

Honestly, they're doing it quite well.

Here's how it works: the wine is poured from kegs, no joke. \\n\\nWhen you order what would be a glass of wine, you can choose  a 1.5 glass option, 3 glass option, or 5 glass option. So, if you were to order the 5 glass option to share, it would come out in a carafe. Make sense? \\n\\nThey highly recommend their bottle list, though.

Breaking the yolk sack, I allowed the yellow to runneth over the the hash mix.  I requested the hash be extra well done for that crispiness; overall this could not be compared to the traditional corned beef hash though.  If you ever had skillet type meals where the quantity of potatoes overwhelm everything, this would be similar.  Small bits of ham and roast beef mixed in didn't a ton of flavor.  However, with the addition of the beets, the nutty toast and the egg yolk, the dish as a whole satisfied the morning hunger.  A 3.5 star if I had to put a rating to it.\\n\\nSwedish Hash but with Smoked Trout instead - same as above.  Could not tell much of a difference as the trout did not stand out as expected.  More meat, please!!\\n\\n√Übleskivers (Danish Pancakes) - these round pancake balls come with two sauces to choose from: their housemade lemon curd, lingonberry jam (what Swedish place don't have lingoberry, right?), syrup or housemade applesauce.    These babies we treated as a breakfast dessert; the round spheres are similar to doughnut holes in appearance.   The outer browned crust is slightly crispy with the inner core hot and fluffy.

I love ramen, and I have tried a lot of places around Atlanta to find the best ramen and in my honest opinion, I GENUINELY believe that Jinya has the best ramen in town. I am so lucky to have found this place about a year ago through a friend because I have been hooked ever since. This is my go to spot and this is why. \\n\\nFood:\\n I come here almost once a week because it is that worth it. They have a vast selection of menu items ranging from ramen to their rice bowls and salad, and everything is delicious! I mostly come here for ramen, and I have tried many of them on the menu including the chicken ramen, tonkatsu spicy, cha cha cha ramen, the sprouting up, and the creamy vegan. I love that the ramen bowls are completely customisable with the thickness of the noodle, and they even have veggie noodles for a gluten free option. They have a ramen specifically for vegans and it is so creamy as the name suggest that I order it many times myself. I have also venture out to try their buns and appetizers and desserts. The Jinya bun is a must try, it is made with sliced cucumbers and tonkatsu meat wedged in a bun, and it will melt in your mouth. The brussel sprout tempura is also a good way to start off your meal. I would recommend coming during their happy hour, where specific items are a few dollars cheaper. They also have an alcohol menu with sake and beers. I like their food because they are consistent with their quality and as I said, I come here A LOT. However, I am not a huge fan of their blockpops, i tried the green tea pistachio and the ice cream was already melting before I started eating it. Not worth 4 dollars, I would stick with the mochi ice cream.\\n\\nAmbiance:\\nThis restaurant is located in a busy shopping plaza in the sandy springs, so parking is not always easy, but it is achievable. As you would expect from any chic spot in town, this place doesn't have ideal amount of seating especially during their peak hours around lunch time. I would say they have about 5 tables, and the bar seats around 8-10 people. They do offer an our door seating area as well. Normally when I come here, the typical wait time is about 20 minutes, and I will receive a text when my table is ready.They don't take any reservations, so walking in is your best bet. The only downside to this is that sometimes the restaurant does get over crowded, and it gets very stuffy while dining, but it is the only downside to this place.  They waitstaff is always attentive and pleasant, especially Kelly, who happens to be our waitress many times. \\n\\nOverall, definitely try this place out if you love ramen as much as I do, this is seriously one of the best places in Atlanta. 5/5 would recommend to anyone!!"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Voodoo Doughuts is super hyped up no matter where you go.

We went for lunch and the menu is a bit overwhelming because there are so many things that sound good.  I seriously felt anxiety when trying to choose a drink because they have a damn good cocktail menu!  I settled on a vodka cocktail called Strawberry Fields that was made with ginger beer and strawberry preserves and it was so tasty and refreshing that it was difficult not to just suck it all down at once.  We shared a \\"piggies in the blanket\\" app that was awesome.  They were wrapped in a perfectly soft yet crispy pastry and served with a delicious creamy whole grain mustard sauce.  I love patty melts so chose the 10oz patty melt.  It was good but I didn't really taste the 1000 Island on it- and I'm a sauce person, I want everything smothered in sauce.  So I think next time I'd ask for an extra side of it.  I chose the flat top mac & ch for my side.  It was so good!  It reminded me a bit of Stouffer's (and I mean that in a good way) but had a crispy cheesy bottom to it that just put it over the top.  Incredible!

Also, this should have a triple dollar sign rating, since you can't eat there and have a drink for less than $35 (the set menu alone, from which you cannot deviate) is $30.\\n\\nWe made a reservation and got really pumped to try this place. I was a big fan of Somnio's creative cuisine that was the predecessor of Lenoir. I'm kind of anti-reservations only places, but I was hoping they'd make it worthwhile. I showed up and was the only one there beside the staff, but I was still seated in the worst table in the place--right by the door,  in a dark corner (yes, this is possible) also by the kitchen. I think to myself they might have some VIPs coming later, but alas, there were always empty tables throughout the evening. Whatever, my date arrives and we're just anxious to try the food. \\n\\nSo we see the menu, which we didn't expect to be quite so expensive, but again, we're excited about the food. We generally share a set menu and add a course or two when we go out, so when it came time to order, we recited our choices...only to be told by the waitress that sharing wasn't allowed and we would each have to order a set menu. Maybe that should've been a cue, but we stayed and added an extra two courses. \\n\\nThe food was okay, but I don't know that it was worth $10/dish or $30/meal. Maybe I would fork out $10 for one dish if I wasn't forced to order three. I dunno. For us it was just okay, though. For the price and the reservations only thing, we expected some damn good food, but we've had better (for much cheaper, including drinks) elsewhere (Eastside Showroom beats Lenoir hands down). It was good, but not damn good. \\n\\nThe waitress knew we were sharing, but when courses came out that required separate cutlery, there was only one set per dish (i.e.,  one spoon for a pudding dish and one fork for a cheese plate). Even at high end restaurants, I've never had that happen. I wasn't sure if we'd offended her, or if it was just an oversight. (Not $60 meal service in my opinion) My cheese plate dessert was a bit disappointing...three slivers of cheese, one by two inches, with a half-teaspoon of grapefruit confitre and five specs of nougat. \\n\\nWe left pretty disappointed, and surprisingly hungry, considering we'd finished everything (so I guess six courses wasn't enough after all). I was hoping for someplace we could bring guests, but I doubt we'll find reason to go back. In the end, I felt like the food was actually creatively comparable to Somnio's, but for twice the money."},{"name":"The Friendly Toast - Burlington","address":"75 Middlesex Tpke, Ste 1015B","city":"Burlington","stars":"4","text":"This place is just amazing.

We were looking for a new place for a bite to eat in the area and Alle Amin popped up with great reviews.  We figured we'd give it a try.  \\n\\nWe walked to the building and saw the African market facing the main street, and then found the \\"restaurant\\" down the side street.  There were a few tables, but nothing really resembling a restaurant.  For some reason, we walked inside anyway.  A little girl was having her dinner and said her mom would be out of the bathroom and would help us soon (too much info, but what do you expect from a little kid).  Out walked a lady, dressed in her Somalian clothing, and told us, in very broken english, that she had goat, chicken, or spaghetti.  Seeing as one of those things was not like the other, we ordered goat and chicken.  \\n\\nMind you, we were not offered a menu, there's a TV on up above, a little girl is eating, and to the left is a an open doorway leading to another room.  You feel like you're in the poorly built added on room in the back of some strange house.\\n\\nWe learned that the woman is also the cook and the mother of the girl.  The girl would help and bring us our dishes.  We asked her for water and she looked into the cooler and said they didn't have any water, only pepsi.  We said we'd take tap water, that was fine.  They brought us out sambusas, a kind of pastry filled with veggies and chicken.  Those were actually quite good.  Then they brought out lettuce with sliced onion.  From the reviews, seems like people think this is a side salad.  There is no dressing or anything on it.  It is actually meant to be eaten with the main dish.  From our observations of the one other guy in the room, he was taking the lettuce with his hands and grabbing the meat and rice and eating it all together.  \\n\\nThe goat dish was fairly large with a good amount of meat. It all came on the bone so you had to pull it apart, almost like ribs.  The chicken was very seasoned and tasty as well.\\n\\nAfterwards we felt like we were far too used to American culture for this place.  Everyone eats with their hands.  This really feels like you're in Somalia, and you may feel pretty uneasy while you're there.  As someone pointed out to me, that is their culture, which is fine, however as this is far from your average Portland dining experience, that's what these reviews are for.  But the food is meat was good and they surprisingly take a credit card.  I am very confused on if they actually have a restaurant license at all, as I did not see one anywhere.  It certainly seemed the standards where far from what the city would require a public dining business to operate under.

I was embarrassed that I had made reservations here since we all had nothing good to say about our meals. My friend salmon parchment entree had the worst presentation, the seafood paella had limited seafood and no flavour either.

In short - the food worth the price but not the wait\\n\\nFirst - weekday breakfasts - as a Beacon Hill resident, I enjoy having a homey place in the neighborhood where I can stop by after a morning run for eggs, toast, black coffee, and the paper. The place is usually never crowded weekday mornings, and the food is good enough to make it an overall very pleasant treat. \\n\\nHowever, I will never understand the long lines on the weekends. The lines are super deceptive - you think you are almost at the food, because ta only a little bit out the door. Little do you know that the line snakes around all the way inside the store, back down the counter, before you pay and take your food. At least an hour's worth of waiting, hoping, anticipating - all for pretty mediocre food.

I've been hearing about this place for years and it's nearly perfect. Cool nautical, beachy theme for some of the freshest seafood. Here's what I had:\\n\\nVarious oysters: We picked a few from this list. Some of the favorites we had were the Katana Bay and Komo Gway. I think the choices change from time to time, but these were both delicious. I really enjoyed the homemade saltine crackers that I'm going to try making some myself at home.\\n\\nUni: This was listed under the \\"Opportunity\\" category on the menu. This was a little unexpected because the uni appears to be mixed with some other ingredients and is served on a top of a fine potato chip that closely resembles a Lay's potato chip. The taste was pretty amazing because the uni is creamy. 3 of these for $9 makes you feel like this is some super fancy Superbowl party snack. While this was a unique twist with uni, I think I'm still a purist at loving uni on its own at a Japanese restaurant.\\n\\nGrilled octopus: Served with a miso yogurt sauce and some pickled bokchoy, there are tons of flavors to this, but it was overpoweringly salty. I suspect that the octopus was given a little more salt in addition to the old bay seasoning that was already put on it. I had a hard time eating this because of the salt but the texture of the octopus was perfect. It's not the best octopus I've had but I'm thinking it might have been just an off day for this dish to be SO salty. I would try ordering this again.\\n\\nMonkfish: I had this as my entree and it was served in a broth with mussels and squid. I really liked this. What really drew me into it was the additional seafood. Mussels were cooked til they're soft and creamy and the squid shape was almost in fine chewy noodles. The monkfish was cooked just right. If you've never had monkfish before, it's often been referred to as \\"the poor man's lobster\\" and it's exactly that: a soft, chewy texture. \\n\\nShishito peppers: Life changing. I loved this side and it was generous as a side portion. They are surprisingly sweet brought out from a slight acidity added to the peppers. I know these peppers as \\"Korean peppers\\" where sometimes you get a surprise pepper where it's spicy. Delicious. I would definitely order this again.\\n\\nBasmati fried rice: There are some pieces of fish in here which make it a bit salty and there's some smokiness to the overall flavor. Not a bad side to get if you want something a little more filling. \\n\\nKey Lime Trifle: This was a cute little dessert with very intense key lime to it. Honestly, it's a bit too small/shallow of a dish to see the layers to it, but the flavor is all there. Key lime pie taste in the form of a little trifle. \\n\\nI would love to come back. $2 valet + tip, but worth it. The service is great and maybe it's just me with the attire here, but I thought people were dressed a little too fancy for how casual The Optimist's scene seems to be.

He even gave my friend and me free samples of their classic powdered sugar beignets. Superb! Puffy, crispy, but soft on the inside, and a GENEROUS heaping of powdered sugar on top. Larger than I expected, too! Three would be a steal for $3.50. They also do 6 for $5 and 12 for $9. YUM! Will be bringing friends back to get some.They also offer other toppings for their specialty sweet beignets ($2.99 ea.) - nutella and strawberry, nutella and banana, and honey almond (which I will be going back to try sometime in the near future!). \\n\\nThey have breakfast egg beignets as well, $2.99 for 1 or $3.99 for 2. Challah bread, too! And cupcakes! Oh my goodness, I want to go back and eat everything.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the pastrami and I ordered the chicken breast lunch beignets. I was not expecting a savory beignet to be so delicious! This is not just a fried piece of dough with meat stuffed on the inside, but it is like...a fried gourmet sandwich. The beignet is a large square and the meat, spring mix, havarti cheese, are put inside and the beignet is folded over into a triangle (like a beignet taco?). There is a crazy delicious white sauce poured over everything inside, making this a little messy to eat, but SO YUMMY! I asked Dmitri what the sauce was made of, and he merely replied, \\"A special sauce. A special sauce for special people.\\" \\n\\nSo there ya go. Come try this trailer so you can be special too!

I've been to every restaurant and they all have their specific good and bad points.  You can tell alot about how one of these restaurants is going to be by the specific environment of the location it is in.  Leaf is no exception.\\n\\nAs far as overall food quality and taste, Leaf gets 5 stars.  They don't have that big of a selection, but what they do have is very very tasty.  The one thing that sticks out in my mind that I have had there was this pistachio/carob/avocado/blueberry tart thing.  I know it sounds like an awkward combination but it was probably the best desert I have ever had. \\n\\nNow to the negative.  It's just too prissy for its own good.  I know it's Pearl Street in Boulder and they try to pitch it as an upscale vegetarian place, but it just doesn't really fit the scheme of the genre all that well.  I think it intimidates potential customers too.  If Leaf could downgrade its image a little bit and not come off as so posh I wouldn't hesitate to give it 5 stars, and I'm sure they would do alot more business.  Do you hear me Leaf?  Stop trying to cater to the condescending pricks that probably won't like your food anyway and \\"downgrade\\" to the not so phony crowd.  Get some beer on tap and dim the lights a little bit.

Beer wort?   Hard to say.\\n\\nRhinelander is essentially a bar with liquor, wine, pub food, and a few German dishes thrown in for good measure.  I came here for lunch late last week and despite being mid afternoon, the restaurant was busy, with quite a few young kids in the crowd.  Upon entry, I was greeted by a hostess who offered me seating at the bar, a table, or a booth.  I opted for the booth and the booths are huge.\\n\\nMy Mexican waiter appeared shortly and I placed an order for a cup of soup and \\"mashers and bangers\\".  I probably ordered that dish in part because of its whimsical name.\\n\\nWhile waiting for my food, I took a look around.  Underneath the German flags and TVs, the interior wood was a cherrywood color.  The wood finish was scratched and scuffed up.   The (German) music volume was very low.\\n\\nThe lentil soup was the best part of the meal - good seasonings, plenty of lentils, carrot, and a bit of sausage.  Dawdling behind the soup came the mashers and bangers.  Resting atop a small bed of mashed potatoes were three plump sausages, surrounded by saut√©ed cabbage and onion.  My waiter also brought out a tray with three mustards:  sweet hot honey, Dijon with white wine, and whole grain Bier.\\n\\nI'm glad they brought the mustard, because I didn't really care for the sausage flavor.  Not sure what the spices were, but they may have contained nutmeg (I think the potatoes might have been larded with nutmeg too).  Also, the sausage seemed to have been prepared by boiling.  However, the mustards nicely balanced the sausage flavor.  I gather Gustav's sells their mustards commercially because the ingredients were listed on the mustard bottle labels.  I can tell you the Dijon white wine mustard was blazing horseradishy hot.  Puzzlingly, the label did not list horseradish as in ingredient.\\n\\nI especially liked the browned saut√©ed cabbage in my dish.  I'd never had cabbage prepared this way before.

We had the yuca fries, the yuca flavor was fine the yuca itself wasn't prepared well thick woody fibers were still attached. You couldn't even bite through the fibers we had to pull them off. Half the order was done to a cooked potato consistency the other half was crunchy not cooked through. Next some tamales filled with cheese, these were good. My husband had the lamb leg over rice & frijoles this was pretty good. I had the duck leg over cilantro rice with a passion fruit sauce. I love duck and the duck itself was prepared well, the rice tasted very pre-made and there was so much passion fruit sauce it overwhelmed the dish. \\n\\nNow remember it was our anniversary well Of all the available tables they stick us next to this post/vertical shelf thing where they keep the water pitchers on our other side was another table so close we could hear their conversation.

It just wasn't our taste as it was hot and had a hot chili flavor. The pigs in a blanket were by far the best part of the meal. I highly suggest everyone order them! They are so good and crispy! \\n\\nThe four stars is for the service. We were there around 3 o'clock so they weren't extremely busy. However, we didn't get any drink refills on our waters the entire time we were there. Also, we waited a long time for the check before I went to the counter and had to ask for it.  Another thing is that the restaurant is very cramped. I get that they probably need as many tables as possible when they're busy, but they have a table so close to their counter that people are in the way if they are having to stand at the counter for any reason AKA to ask for the check when the waitress disappears.

The food is expertly prepared and exceptionally presented, the interior is a far cry from the dilapidated dive bar that once occupied this space, and the service is southern hospitality at its finest. As a resident of this neighborhood, I'm thrilled to have a restaurant of this caliber within walking distance.\\n\\nFood: Poor Calvin's specializes in Thai and American fusion - although the \\"fusion\\" aspect consists more of Thai and American dishes on the same menu rather than as components within the same entree. Menu offerings include everything from pad Thai and curry to fried chicken and meatloaf. During my visit, I opted to start with the Po' Dip, an East Asian cheese dip with tahiti and ground cashews served with toasted pita, fruits, and vegetables - the flavor was excellent. For an entree, I opted for the fried chicken, which was served over mac n' cheese and sauteed vegetables. The chicken was perfectly cooked and crisp, and the presentation rivaled what you'd expect from a Michelin rated establishment. Unfortunately, the mac n' cheese was less memorable and lacked the creamy texture I've come to expect from such a dish. For dessert, I tried the candied apple, which was a light and welcomed change from the standard options you typically find elsewhere in Atlanta.  \\n\\nService: It was essentially a two man show - Calvin was working the kitchen and making the rounds throughout the restaurant, while James was single handedly managing the entire front end. Both were friendly, accommodating, and eager to please. \\n\\nAtmosphere: A great deal of effort has gone into renovating both the exterior and interior of the space - aside from the Guinness Pelican still plastered along the backside of the building, it's hard to believe that this space once housed O'Terrill's Pub and its infamous robot wielding, gun shooting owner. The new ownership has transformed it into a sophisticatedly modern space - the restaurant features separate interior dining rooms, as well as an exterior wrap around patio lined with french doors that overlook Renaissance Park. The dress is casual and the clientele is urban - the establishment is very gay friendly. \\n\\nCost: Reasonably priced for the quality and quantity of the food offerings. Lunch entrees are $7-$9, dinner appetizers are $5-$8, soups are $5, salads are $9, full entrees are $11-$16, and sides are $4. All major credit cards are accepted. \\n\\nOther: Poor Calvin's is located on Piedmont Road in the \\"SoNo\\" district of Atlanta - it's adjacent to the Civic Center and directly across the street from Renaissance Park. Hours of operation are Monday-Friday, 11AM-2:30PM and 5PM-10PM, and Saturday-Sunday, 5PM-10PM. Very limited parking is available in the restaurant's private lot - additional parking is also available along nearby side streets.

First, I booked thinking I was going to be staying in an old school converted into a hotel.  I was wrong. I was placed into the \\"English wing\\" which is all new construction of very small rooms.  \\n\\nThe key wouldn't open the outside door, I had to walk around to the other entrance to get in.  Then to hallways, had weird red lighting which were hard to see in.  The rooms had the same odd red light bulb, making it required to have the ground level curtains open to have any light in the room. \\n\\nThere was no TV in the room, which seemed very odd.  The room was also missing the coffee pot, I had to get dressed and go to the lobby to get coffee in the AM.  \\n\\nThe shower was very small, only one towel per person was provided.  I'm not a big person and the shower was too small for me.  The head of the shower was placed so high and the shower was so narrow, I couldn't get the water to hit my body without standing with my nose on the outer wall.  \\n\\nParking was a huge problem, hotel guests were banished to a lot at the far end of the property.  This seemed like it was more a flop house for drunks than a fun get away hotel experience.  Hotel guests were clearly second served, the public using the facility had priority. \\n\\nWhen I checked in, I wasn't told I would need reservations for dinner, and being unfamiliar with the area, I didn't know it was a popular location for locals to hang out.  Dinner wait was over an hour at the main restaurant, no priority for guests, and I was told to check the Cyprus room, which also had no seating.  I ended up stuffed in the corner of a dark, downstairs bar at the boiler room eating Pub food.  \\n\\nThe Boiler Room bar was noisy, dark, and the service was terrible.  The appetizer came at the same time as the meal and no one checked back to see if I needed anything further.  The food was expensive and there wasn't much of it.  The green salad I ordered instead of fries was hot, and soggy from being left too long under the heat lamp.  Not to mention, it was half the size of the burger.  I left the pub still hungry, and thirsty, as my water was never refilled the entire meal. \\n\\nAt 2:00 AM, the drunks wandered out of the bar towards their cars, noisy and not caring that there was anyone asleep in the hotel.  As they had priority parking, they were walking right next to my room, talking, laughing, and making as much noise as they wanted to.  Another group came through about 2:15.\\n\\nThe only way to get the heater shut off in the room was to totally shut it off with the power switch, so I had to sleep the entire night with no heat, as it was so noisy itself that it would have been impossible to try to sleep through. \\n\\nI was surprised by how many children were running the hallway when we left dinner.  They were rude, and pushy, there were several groups with their parents, running, and no one, especially the staff was around to keep them from knocking people over. \\n\\nThe is a soaking pool that came highly recommended.  This is not for hotel guests, it's open to the public.  I didn't want to sit in an overly large hot tub with half dress unshaven individuals who clearly had been using some type of drugs before they entered the facility.  Last I knew marijuana was legal in Washington, but not yet in Oregon, these individuals must have lit up then headed across the border.  It was clearly disgusting and unclean.  The odd thing was, everyone, men/women guests/public shared the same locker room which didn't even appear to have a shower to wash in before going into or coming out of the pool. \\n\\nThe staff were a bunch of young hipsters who were just getting paid to be there and really didn't have much to do with the guests having a positive experience."},{"name":"Joy Wok Healthy Chinese","address":"7331 SW Barnes Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm sure a lot of you have noticed that there's not a lot of Chinese food in this town.

Our waiter decided to write down our card information without our consent. He came back to tell us the card machine was down. We did not feel comfortable with our information being written down.

I was very excited when I heard about Jinya coming to Atlanta. Finally, the perfect ramen I wished for is in Georgia. This isn't the best ramen I have ever had, however it is definitely the best in Georgia. I thought after my ramen ventures during my trips in L.A and NY, I'd get discouraged to have ramen here. While the only other options we have in Suwanee and Doraville, they aren't amazing like Jinya. I came here twice in less than one week and plan to return if I'm craving ramen, which is frequent because I love hot piping bowls of noodles. \\n\\nCha Cha Cha Ramen: This is definitely for garlic lovers like me. I enjoyed every bit of this (without bean sprouts) and ordered it to be spicy and with a side of seaweed. The chashu is melt in your mouth and very tender. The noodles are thick and perfect. \\nAdding the Crispy Chicken + Side salad combo to the ramen entree for $4 more was a nice choice. The crispy chicken was really flavorful and crispy. Generous portion size for these as well. The side salad was refreshing to eat at the end of my meal. \\n\\nJinya Buns: I can't ever get enough of these Japanese buns when I visit ramen bars. They're like a must before you eat the noodles. These were packed with the right flavor for the chashu and the buns were fluffy and slightly sweet. \\n\\nSprouting Up Ramen: My boyfriend got this and said it was pretty good. He didn't get spicy, but topped it with the sauce and seasoning they had at the table. I also tried a little bit of the broth and I thought I was good as well. It comes with brussel sprouts, onions, egg, chili oil and is served with thick noodles. \\n\\nTonkotsu Spicy: Got this during my second visit and the pork broth is good. I had to order a side of seaweed and a egg since this bowl didn't include those items. I definitely ordered spicy, which isn't bad at all. \\n\\nThe downside to Jinya here in ATL is that inside is very cramped. So most likely if you come during peak dinner hours and weekends you will be waiting. A lot of seating is outside, but idk how that will work when the harsh winter comes. I wish they had a bigger shop, only about 3-4 people can wait inside and majority of the times, outside is the main option to wait. I'm hoping they'll come near Duluth or downtown ATL.

If you're going to serve spaghetti noodles instead of yakisoba or udon noodles, at least prepare the spaghetti al dente so the noodles are not squishy. Also, our bill for two dinners and two sodas was $39.57. Way overpriced if you're not going to offer yakisoba noodles! Did I mention that the noodles were spaghetti yet?!

What I said in my previous review still holds true but I wanted to share my second UOH experience with you YELPers. I returned to UOH with my one and again we got lobster but this time got a 10-pound lobster. I reserved the lobster and a table with great telephonic difficulty. I spent literally 20-plus minutes on the phone with UOH and with much confusion including being on hold for over 10 minutes only to be forgotten about by the person who went to go check if they were able to reserve/obtain a lobster. I had to call back and had another person who went to go check but said they \\"are not allowed to reserve lobsters\\" after I was initially told by an other person in the kitchen that they were able to do so. I spoke with five people en todo. This lobster rez was no easy task but worked out eventually as we did ultimately receive this yumski Big Boi. My baked \\"ba-day-da\\" was teenie and not cooked properly. Hard/uncooked in the center and wrapped in aluminum foil and merely warm-ish. Surely just hanging around in bulk mass with other similar fellow non-QAed potatoes for the day. The cornbread is dry and crumbly AF. No bueno. Caveat: Do not expect a fine dining atmosphere. UOH is chaotic and (un)civilized as a Friendly's. Patrons being loud as can be and families with toddlers and so on. The bus boy was amusing -a bull in a china shop and clumsy as Gerald Ford. The dood was hammering chairs together and dropping dishes in the dining area and spilling things. The lobster was great/killer/banging/on point/off the hook and big enough to make Andre the Giant feel as though he belongs in midget wrestling.

The new restaurant 1/2 Roll caught our eye so we decided to try it out. It used to be Itadakimasu Izakaya, one of our go-to places for Japanese food but unfortunately, they closed down. :( Anyways, we were eager to try out its replacement.\\n\\nI was unimpressed with their menu. It was all black and the font was unappealing. There were very few pictures, making it difficult to choose what to order. Nothing really caught my eye, to be honest. The cool thing, though, is you can order half rolls, which is 3 pieces instead of 6 if you want to try different kinds of sushi. Eventually, we decided on 4 items.\\n\\nThe first was Takoyaki. I thought it was actually not bad. It had a crispy exterior and the inside was smooth and very hot. It didn't have very much filling, however.\\n\\nOur second appetizer was the Asparagus & Bacon, our replacement for not getting to go to Zakkushi XD . It was pretty meh... Nothing special about it. The bacon was a bit tough.\\n\\nWe ordered the Las Vegas Roll, which was one of their specialty rolls. It had prawn tempura, avocado, cucumber, unagi, and yam tempura outside. The flavour was good but there were lots of bones in my unagi... which is something I'm very nit-picky about! :(\\n\\nLastly, we had the Salmon Oshi Sushi, as recommended by other reviewers. The first few of pieces were quite good. It had a nice smoky flavour that wasn't overpowering. However, after eating a couple more pieces, I wasn't a huge fan anymore. The sauce on top became too creamy and it needed some sort of acidity to cut the richness. I also had some scales in my salmon sashimi, which was another huge disappointment.

From the moment we hit TX we started seeing Cheddar's but had not eaten at one. So when friends in Orlando suggested that we meet at Cheddar's we decided to check it out. We understood they didn't take reservations when choosing this location as the meetup spot. However, the service we received from beginning to end left much to be desired and most certainly leaves zero desire to return to any Cheddar's ever. \\n\\nWhen my family & I first arrived, we let the hostess know the approximate number of guests we would have, according to the list I had. The restaurant's policy regarding group seating leaves much to be desired. We had friends driving in from Tampa and working nearby, but coming in at different times. I had no way of confirming when everyone was going to be there. It just became very convoluted, but since this was the meetup spot, we decided to hold out. The initial interaction with the hostesses already set an underwhelming expectation of what was to come. Presumably, they were just following orders as their manager was also there projecting the same level of \\"service\\". Then again, experience comes with time and having a teenager (18 yr old), with limited PR skills, greet clients does not transmit a professional ambiance.\\n\\nOnce my guests were there we waited an additional 10 minutes, so about a total of about 40 mins, which from what I've read seems to be the norm.

From the time we sat down to the time we order to actually getting our food was about another hour at least. My family and I arrived at 6:45pm, were sat down at 7:30pm and left at 9:45pm, not because we lingered, but because that's how long the whole process took. I understand it's not fast food, which is great. However, it seems the kitchen did not anticipate it to be that busy on a  Thursday night. For a restaurant that seemingly has a following, one would think that they would have the staff to handle the orders. \\n\\nOne positive point I will give this location is that the mashed potatoes were on point.

Today, my boyfriend and I were in the area and decided to stop in and try Lee and Rick's finally. From the outside the place looked pretty neat. It's shaped like a boat. The inside was fine and there were a lot of people happily eating oysters which I took as a good sign. \\n\\nMy boyfriend doesn't eat oysters so we decided to just sit at a normal booth and order other items. He ordered crab cakes and I ordered stuffed flounder and New England clam chowder. \\n\\nThe chowder arrived first. It was pretty good, but a bit watery compared to other places. When the flounder came out, it looked good and huge. I began eating it and it had a good flavor and was nice and flaky. Then I got to the middle. It was hard to cut and once I cut off a piece and popped it into my mouth, I realized it was nearly raw. I scraped the stuffing off the rest and saw the whole center was severely undercooked. I opted not to eat anymore. My boyfriend offered to share his crab cakes with me but I had tasted them and didn't care for them either. Way too much batter. \\n\\nI did let our server know about my fish. She asked if I wanted to get something else, but I declined. They didn't offer to remove it from the bill or anything. \\n\\nI know this place has been around a long time and perhaps I should have just stuck with oysters, but figured they would give the same attention to their other menu items.

It's like walking into a bubble of hospitality that seems alien to a lot of other places in Austin.\\n\\nThe fixed price (or the prix-fixe if you're feelin' fancy) menu itself consists of the current offerings segmented into courses with a corresponding theme - Field, Sea, Land and Dream, and a well-chosen beer and wine selection. We were told from the very beginning to select three menu items, in any combination we'd like, and they'd bring it to your table.\\n\\nThis is the part when my brain said...\\n\\nHold.\\nThe.\\nFreakin'.\\nPhone.\\n\\n... you mean I could have three meat courses without feeling weird or awkward, embracing my nature of CARNIVORE SUPREME without being given a raised eyebrow or an admonishing scowl?\\n\\nYou just won major points, Lenoir.\\n\\nGranted, I didn't order three meat dishes... just two. The first dish I chose was the much-lauded butternut mole tortelli. I don't know what kind of moon-sugar-spun-of-dreams that they put in that dish, but for fracks sake, it was like eating unicorn smiles dipped in sunshine.\\n\\nThree dishes, any combination. It's a beautiful thing.\\n\\nThe next dish after the magical first was a wild hog terrine. It, too, was delicious. It's about time someone found a good use for all those crazy-ass wild hogs roaming Texas. Every ingredient perfectly synced with the last. So much so that the lady' kept stealing bites... but no matter... she shared her rabbit with me, so we're square.\\n\\nThe final course for me, however, fell a little flat. The roasted gulf shrimp with upma polenta. The polenta and other pieces of the dish were great - but the shrimp tasted too gamey, if that makes sense, like shrimp frozen and thawed a few times. It skewed the overall dish and isn't something I'd order again.\\n\\nThe rest of the dishes I sampled, whether stolen from the lady or my own, were all A+, would-do-business-again.\\n\\nThe dessert the lady chose, the dark chocolate chiboust, which I'd initially stated I didn't want to sample, quickly became a game of \\"Who's Spoon is the Fastest\\". \\n\\nAs we were wrapping up, the owner stopped by our table to inquire about our meal.

The interior is also lovely with a spacious and homey dining room, where was pretty full, but I didn't have to wait long to be seated. I was served mini cornbread muffins and dinner rolls. The cornbread was decent, but not anything to write home about. \\n\\nUpon being seated, I was given a menu and paper to fill out with my order. It took me quite awhile to decide what to get because there were so many wonderful sounding entrees and sides. I finally narrowed it down to the fried chicken or the chicken pot pie. I asked the waitress and she commented that the chicken pot pie was really good, so I decided on that. As for the sides, I knew I wanted the sweet potato souffle but couldn't figure out whether to choose the mac and cheese or vegetable and cheese souffle. \\n\\nThe waitress saw that I was having a tough time so she actually allowed me to sample both so I could make a decision. I went with the vegetable and cheese souffle. I thought that the mac and cheese was a tad watery and not particularly flavorful, while the vegetable and cheese souffle was amazing - Incredibly cheesy with plenty of tasty and fresh corn and zucchini, all cooked in a delicious crispiness. \\n\\nAfter I finalized my order, my food came really quickly - I was quite impressed by that! Everything was piping warm and delightful looking. The chicken pot pie had crust on top, as well as plenty of sauce. The filling was pretty good with peas, carrots, and celery, but there definitely wasn't enough chicken. While the vegetables and chicken were very tender, I thought the filling could have used more seasoning. The crust was yummy, but difficult to get off the sides of the dish. \\n\\nMy favorite side was definitely the sweet potato souffle, which is like a sweet potato mash and came with a good amount of melted marshmallow on top. It was absolutely delicious and had a dollop of cinnamon, a dash of nutmeg and sweet syrup. \\n\\nEven though I was quite full after my meal, I had to try the peach cobbler because how can I not when in the south (for my very first time, I might add). This dessert was very good, with a ton of golden sweet peaches, their juices and some crust on top. It tasted so good: refreshing and not too sweet. I also added some of the leftover marshmallow fluff from the sweet potato souffle between my last bite of peach and crust, which was soo delectable. Peach cobbler with marshmallow should totally be a thing! \\n\\nThe service was wonderful and the waitress definitely displayed some southern hospitality. She was patient, kind, friendly and even let me sample a couple different sides so I could make an informed decision.

Once a children's school the McMenamins Kennedy School has been converted to what I would call a  happening. You can stay overnight here because it is a hotel. You can watch a movie here because it is a movie theatre. You can host a wedding or special event here because it is a wonderful point of entertainment all in and of itself. You can go here for a soak as there is an outdoor soaking tub surrounded by tropical plants. There are multiple restaurants and bars so you could consider it these as well. My point is that this establishment has so much to offer you can spend the whole day here, and then sleep overnight! \\nMovies are top box office hits just out of the big Regal theaters. A show is around $3 and you can sit on a comfy couch and get lunch served to you! Multiple restaurants inside and out offer American food. They serve their own beer (the Ruby is the best). They have a few bars. Some with cigar smoking like the converted Detention room and some larger with multiple levels and more games like shuffle board inside the Boiler Room bar. Bring a swim suit and enjoy the soaking pool if you are a guest staying overnight or for a small fee if you live in the neighborhood!! \\nOh...and they also have live bands performing throughout the year and holiday events for the whole family.

I did not even have to add salt - which is rare when it comes to eggs. \\n\\nWe self parked, which came to $12; however we were not sure how the valet system worked, and were both cashless so were unable to tip.

I have to admit, though, that I felt a bit underdressed when I arrived at the threshold and even asked Stephanie, the hostess and bartender if shorts were okay(I was quick to notice the dress of the wait staff, white linen tablecloths, and black cloth napkins) She was amused and made me feel at ease with the attire.  We were quickly handed off to our server, Kirk who seated us near the back of the restaurant.  The ambiance was strikingly soothing; with candle style lighted lamps along the walls and interesting art canvasses for sale over neutral tapestry.  You may or may not feel as though you are transported to Germany or France.  After Kirk provided us with the specials of the day we were handed off to our waitress for the evening, Ally, who arrived to take our order.  I was very impressed with her professionalism, courteousness, helpfulness, and very easy going personable attitude.  I chose the Bistro Salad, Duck Gnocchi,  and for dessert I had the French Silk Tart.  The salad comes with a sweet balsamic vinaigrette and walnuts and cranberries.  Very delicious.  I did not meet the Chef, but now I wished I had, because I would have certainly thanked him/her.  The bread served before, but at the same time with the salad was paired with a olive oil dip, but this was different than what I've experienced before.  There was not just garlic or pepper, but pur√©ed tomatoes and it complimented the bread very nicely.  I could have stopped with the salad, but then the entr√©e was upon me and it was a burst of palate tantalizing flavor that I enjoyed.  There were too many of the doughy potato rolls than I could eat, but that was fine as soon the dark chocolate whipped pie was upon me and it was one of the best pies/tarts I've had in a good long time and it pains me to say that I could not finish it. Ally encouraged me to take the rest for later, but I could not eat another bite, if I wanted to.  They change deserts, but hopefully it is available when you stop in because it is \\"to die for\\". Great place to eat and reasonably priced. Surprised it wasn't reservations only!

There was always inconsistency with prices for our usual drinks and getting charged for drinks we didn't even order.  Our last visit was due to a coworker being accused of not paying her tab when in fact she did.  She cashed out on a lottery win, tipped the girl VERY well and closed her tab.  Decided to give it another go, and still had the same issue.  When I asked for an itemized receipt, she refused to give me one and since my bill was higher than it should have been, I tipped accordingly.  After being ridiculed by the bartender to other patrons, she walked over with an itemized receipt.  Convenient right?? Which was incorrect, AGAIN.  I was charged mid shelf for drinks that I didn't ask for and drinks I didn't order.  First and foremost, I'm not required to tip so being pointed out like that for the entire bar to see was inappropriate and uncalled for.  I tip well when I get good service and my server is friendly.  If you won't give me an itemized receipt, then this is what happens.

I mean, where else do you find doughnuts topped off with Fruit Loops and chocolate-drizzled Oreo chunks? Once you get past the initial giddiness most of them are actually kind of disappointing though. The Voodoo Doll, for instance, while cutely decorated, is really just a normal raspberry jam doughnut underneath. The Diablos Rex, under the guise of such a badass name, is just a chocolate doughnut with red and white icing/sprinkles piped around in a gimmicky pattern. The pretty purple doughnut, upon further inspection, is a plain doughnut with purple glaze and purple sprinkles. The supposed lavender and grape flavors weren't very strong. The one doughnut I did really like was the bacon maple.

The fish was not even fresh.  The result... strongly fishy tasting lemonade you eat like soup.  About 3-4 full spoonfuls worth.  Really bad.  Fish in lemonade.  What a joke. I also tasted an alternate 2nd course... a flavorless, gritty, baked acorn squash dish...served chilled cold with zero flavor other than the feta cheese crumbles which seemed out of place.  Then before the main course, we each received a 2 1/2\\" corner of bread which was crispy on the outside and tasted just like fryer grease.  Main course:  about 3oz of supposedly Waygu flank steak... only It had no fat or flavor and was tough.  Worse, if it did have any flavor, it was completely covered by the buffalo wing sauce it sat in. Ridiculous.

The dirt doughnut was too sweet, with icing and oreo, and the ODB was basically the dirt with peanut butter drizzle. I would prefer Krispie Kreme or Top Pot doughnuts over these.\\n\\nI liked the vibe of Voodoo, it seemed very trendy and Portland-y. I also think maybe Voodoo has created its own hype?

But I do know what I like.\\n\\nThe benefits of having gluten-free friends is finding places like this.  After seeing Christine A check in here a few times, and seeing her review, I immediately wanted to try it.  I'm not the biggest fan of PF Changs due to the, well, the PF Changiness of the place.  It never seems like the kind of place I should wait 45 minutes for a table.  But what they have going for them is consistent food, and a fairly extensive gluten free menu.  Many \\"Chinese\\" places we've thought of going, we don't bother with because we grow tired of asking if certain items could be done without gluten and get blank stares, or hear as a reply \\"Well, almost everything we make does contain some sugar...\\"  *sigh*\\n\\nWe've only had a few of the menu items.  The last time, I even asked for MINE to be made GF so my wife and I could share.  They make it clear which of the dishes can be done gluten free, and which can't (talk to them, it's not actually written on the menu).  And you can hear the instructions being made to the kitchen, and we've never had any issues with my wife's gluten allergy there.  The Chicken Delight is very tasty.  The veggies always seem very fresh, and cooked well but still crispy.  Esp. things like broccoli that can, at other places, be overcooked and mushy, or almost raw.  In my lemon chicken (not sure if that can be GF), the pieces were large, and mostly chicken (not mostly breading).  And I've seen Errol down an entire large bowl of the pho here, so that must be good as well.  Seems like they will work with most reasonable requests to adjust a dish for us.\\n\\nNo, we don't really throw our trust totally in the hands of the young lads they have as wait staff here.  Yes, we are far more forgiving than some that they can sometimes be distracted, and get off task until redirected by Hong Q (the 'person at the hostess stand who takes the to go orders').  Hong is actually the wife of the owner, or else I would recommend that PF Changs, or any high end place in town steal her for her front of house skills.  Yes, we did drop the name of Christine A to Hong, and have received wonderful service every time we've been.\\n\\nThen we learned they could do sesame chicken (my wife's fave dish) gluten free.  When we picked my wife up off the floor, she hesitantly ordered it, almost in fear that it would be disappointing.  But it was EXACTLY what she wanted.\\n\\nIt's your local neighborhood place where they get to know you.  Even though we live a bit more up MoPac than Far West, we are happy they adopted us as well.  And they do one hell of a to go business (though we always eat there, if only to watch the Hong show).  \\n\\nPOSTSCRIPT:  As I write this, my phone flashed \\"Christine A has checked into Hao-Q\\", to once again get her fix for the Hot and Sour Tamarind Soup.

If you sever it, the two lobes start operating independently which can sometimes lead to split-brain.  Split-brain is like having two people in one body.  \\n\\nThe left arm will grab walnuts and the right arm will fight the left arm for the nuts.  One leg might try to dance while the other one kicks a 4-yard field goal.\\n\\nBut usually, one lobe will dominate the other.  \\n\\nTop of the Hub is split-brain and its dining lobe is clearly the dominant one while its bar lobe is a loser.\\n\\nThe hostess and waitress were quick and friendly.  We had a reservation, which you should consider making no matter how small your party, so we were seated immediately.  Almost right away, we had menus.\\n\\nFor starters, I got the duck confit pappardelle and Miss K got a raw tuna and avocado plate.  Duck confit is tender duck meat cooked low and slow in oil until it falls apart.  Add any flavorful meat to a pasta with some sauteed veggies and you're ready to rumble.  I loved the bits of chopped carrot and onion in the sauce but not as much as I liked the duck which was so soft it was hard to pick up.\\n\\nMiss K then had a seafood salad as her entree and I had the lamb shank on a bed of polenta.\\n\\nThe lamb shank was cooked perfectly but could have used more seasoning.  Luckily, the fresh taste of the meat itself carried the dish.  Mixed with the polenta, it made a satisfying mouthful.  \\n\\nI still prefer the duck pappardelle but I'm biased towards both pasta and duck over polenta and lamb, respectively.  If you like either of those, you should order the lamb.  It was so satisfying, I couldn't finish it.

It would be easier to convince TSA to let you carry a bazooka onto the plane than it would be to get refills at Top of the Hub.\\n\\nAll three bartenders seemed like their minds were anywhere but on the job.  If you've ever known someone who obviously has a dark secret but denies it when you ask, that's what I'm talking about.  Was the manager a hard ass?  Were their wages shitty?\\n\\nWhatever it was, it was enough for them to pass by our empty glasses several times without so much as a glance in our direction.  We weren't there to get liquored up but I don't think you should have to wait for more than five minutes for a refill.  One bartender served a grad student next to us the wrong cocktail.  Impressively, she struck while the iron was hot and asked for a \\"poor grad student discount,\\" i.e., pay for my drink, incompetent fucker.\\n\\nHe reluctantly agreed and I was totally on her side.  Human error is completely understandable in a hectic environment but the bar was half empty.  No bartender worth half his salt should have gotten that drink wrong or ignored us.  The strange part was that he didn't care that he got the drink wrong or that he had to buy the girl's drink.  When the energy for your job is dead, that's when you might have to move on.\\n\\nHopefully, they were just having an off night.  But just in case they weren't, let me tell you how to get their attention.\\n\\nLean forward a little bit and look at their faces.  \\n\\nThis method capitalizes on the natural human instinct to know when you're being watched.  I learned that from a Navy SEAL who was trained never to look directly at a target through the scope of his sniper rifle.

Even though I was sitting quietly at my stool, I was psychologically in their space . . . and they knew it.  It took all of two seconds for them to ask me if I needed a refill.  I feel sorry for anyone who was getting shitfaced that night because it was probably not going as they planned.  \\n\\nAs for us, we just wanted to enjoy the view and sip a couple of cocktails so, in the grand scheme of things, it wasn't that big a deal.

Then walked around to the front entrance where we were immediately asked how many were in our party and then seated in the \\"Atlanta Room\\". They have several different quaint rooms for seating which gives a southern home dining feel. \\n\\nThe wait for the food wasn't long at all and I was excited to try the suggestions our waitress had given. We tried the famous fried chicken dish which the portions of the sides were larger than the chicken breast. The chicken breast was fried too hard and the mac and cheese was tasty but oily. However, the potato salad was delicious it actually tasted like my grandmothers.  We also tried the Salmon Croquettes that were fried, they were good but the texture seemed more like tuna croquettes (seriously). I enjoyed the crispy fried okra and the turnip greens and the cornbread. \\n\\nThe service was awesome and everyone was so friendly. I did love the southern hospitality but they have to do a little more research on soul food cuisine and some of the herbs and flavors that make the dish. \\n\\nAnyway I'm no chef I just grew up on soul food so I know how to cook it and how it should taste. \\n\\nOther than that, its definitely worth checking out! If nothing less you will get a chance to meet some pretty awesome staff and if you have never tasted soul food you won't be so quick to judge it!! \\n\\nThanks everyone, enjoy!"},{"name":"Katana Teppanyaki & Sushi","address":"3345 Lenox Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place is really good.

We were sat right outside the kitchen, however it wasnt too noisey so not a big deal. Majority of the staff was young, clique-type girls who were chatty and slow moving. Our server (never said her name), greeted us promptly and took our drink orders and brought a draft list for us to check out.  We ordered a beer & a couple of appetizers. The onion rings werent bad, but the thousand island style sauce didnt quite go with them. The mozzarella sticks were amazing! Came with what seemed as a really nice housemade marinara. My husband ordered a burger & I ordered the Fried Chicken Sandwich tossed in their honey Garlic sauce. Both were delicious!! One thing offputting was a server braiding her hair at the server station.

We really like the butter chicken and Tikka Masala and of course the naan breads, though I wish they had better sauces for the naan.\\n\\nThe service just suuuuckkks.....no seriously, there is one waitress in particular that just really cant seem to figure it out. She is awkward, semi engaging (which makes it worse) doesn't seem to understand what you want and will actually argue with you when you tell her what you want. We ordered a 40.00 bottle of wine, had a couple of glasses then asked for it to be corked so we could finish it at home, she was adamant that it could not be done and told us we would have to leave it or finish it. After 15 minutes of talking she figured it out and corked it for us. Just when we thought the drama was over we asked if she could split the bill, nothing complicated just right down the middle. She said we needed to take the bill and figure out what each would pay and right it on the check with a check mark next to each item........are you kidding me?? She was not and refused to do anything else. Guess who did not get a tip and lost our business.\\n\\nThe other thing that has lost me as a customer is the portions.

Sure, the interior decor is aesthetically pleasing, but the food was just average, with the exception of the duck, a notable standout.\\n\\nThe bar area is crowded.  It has way too many tables wedged into too small a space.  And the acoustics give Andina the ambience of a Greyhound bus station, with lots and lots of noise.  \\n\\nOur waitress was patient enough with me to take the time to consult with the chefs to find out what dishes did not contain cilantro or could be at least prepared without cilantro.  As it turns out there are only about three out of a couple dozen dishes that do not have cilantro.  \\n\\nFor appetizers we ordered the pulpo (octopus) and ricotta cheese-filled yucca.  Ignoring the cilantro mashed potatoes that came with this appetizer, I found the octopus cooked to a nice doneness with a tad of crispiness,  but was bland.\\n\\nThe cheese yucca reminded me of those breaded cheese sticks you can get in a pub.  No real flavor except for all the salt.  The dipping sauce was salty and bland too.\\n\\nFor entrees we ordered the duck and the rack of lamb. The duck itself was excellent.  It had a nice barbecued flavor and crispity skin.  However, the cilantro rice and vegetables side dish was gross, really greasy.\\n\\nThe rack of lamb dish was a disappointment.  The entr√©e came with two slices of lamb that had only skimpy bits of meat.  Yet, I would say the flavor of, what little lamb was there, to be good, especially the red pepper glaze that was kind of but not exactly like a mole.  I liked the salad greens that came with this dish.  They were cleverly wrapped in a little crispy cracker that had the texture of a fortune cookie.  But I absolutely did not care for the circular potato & cheese thingies that came with the lamb.

The sauce that came with it was delicious as well - a spicy mayo that added a nice tang.\\n\\nI ordered the miso sablefish and husband got the lamb sirloin. Both were very good dishes. The sablefish was a bit on the salty side (I guess it was soaked in the miso sauce for a bit longer than it should've been), but the vegetables that came with it were fantastic.

The lamb was great - seasoned well to bring out the natural flavours, and came with a fantastic scalloped potato that I pretty much ate half of.\\n\\nOverall, the place is nice and the patio is a definite sell.

Nobody was ever in that restaurant Nicholas's, I went to that place also and it is packed with lines down the street. Every time I went there in the past, there was maybe 1 person in there. Portland is not cool anymore. It got sold out or taken over. Blame the tv show portlandia."},{"name":"McMenamins Kennedy School","address":"5736 NE 33rd Ave.","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I have to tip the hat to Lulamae for letting me know about this place.  It's a hotel, it's a brewery, it's a restaurant, it's a movie house.  Despite the variety of offerings, Kennedy School has pulled every one of these things off very well.  As the name implies, the building used to be a school.  The whole school concept is carried out in the artwork, the guest rooms, the restuarants, etc.  Even if you stay elsewhere, the pubs are worth a visit.

You see a stray dog near the front door and think to yourself, \\"RUN!  You could be tomorrows pork ribs!\\"  Well, wonder no more, I went in and took a bullet for you, the masses of Yelpdom.\\n\\nFirst I balked at the door when I saw only $5.75 for lunch and that included a beverage!  CHEAP!  I thought to myself, \\"Where are they cutting costs?\\"  However, I have a duty to Yelpers and Yelpites and soldiered in, paid my money and dutifully set about planning my attack of the hot trays!\\n\\nPot Sticker?  Don't mind if I do.\\n\\nNoodles?  Nah, they want you to eat the noodles and fill up, haha, go pick on someone dumber than me, I'm on to your tricks!\\n\\nFried chicken?  Well sure, if you can't make fried chicken how good is your chinese going to be?\\n\\nBBQ Pork?  Definately! \\n\\nMandarain Chicken?  Just a little of the sweet tangy stuff.\\n\\nGeneral Tsao's Chicken?  The dish I live for, alas it looks like every other poor excuse for the dish but I try a little.\\n\\nEgg Roll?  Why of course.\\n\\nI went and topped off a too small glass of diet cola and went and sat down to examine what I had picked.  It actually looked pretty good.  Smelled good.  Carefully, methodically I took bites and examined each new dish.  One thing that really caught my attention was the pork ribs, little two morsels of pork in a light sauce.  I took one initially, went back for two more and then finally grabbed about four more.  \\n\\nThe final analysis is that this place is a very suitable lunch destination.  It is fast if you want it to be, slow if you desire and the selection is extensive.  You can color me surprised.  I'm not saying it's the best chinese in Portlandia, just that it is acceptable fare.  Especially for the price."},{"name":"Jersey Mike's Subs","address":"227 Sandy Springs Pl NE, Ste 102","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"I love Jersey Mike's. It's my favorite sandwich chain. Here's the thing, I have never seen anyone make a sandwich so fast in my life. The lady that made my sandwich literally took care of a line of 6 people flawlessly, by herself....BY HERSELF in the time most people take to make 1 regular Italian Sub. I'm not even exaggerating.  As I write this, I'm watching her lead a team of two other gentlemen (They started just after I came in at 11:45) and they must gotten 20 people out the door in the last 15 minutes! IT's unbelievable! I would come here again just to watch her make a sandwich. Honestly, I nearly asked her if she wants to open a franchise one day. She's that good. She should be working for corporate and teaching everyone else how its done."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Had a company dinner here in one of the there private rooms.

Nothing too special. I have been here multiple times and here are the ones I like: \\n\\nMaple bacon: tastes good, if you are into things like that \\nVoodoo doll:is a good one for people who like raspberry filling\\nTriple chocolate penetration: for the chocolate lovers\\nCock-n-balls: which is and should be used for bachelor and bachelorette parties alike\\n\\nOverall it is a predictable place which is part of the external image of Portland, so is usually part of the food pilgrimage that people make to Portland, and there is nothin bad about it. I just think that there are better donut places that are doing some nice experiments with donuts that seem more attractive and fun to me. \\n\\nAll said and done. This is the place to be at 2:30am after you are done partying and drinking, and now want to eat something.

Ashley (who also serves here) recommended the rose, and I'm so glad she did. It was light, crisp, and so refreshing on a lovely summer night.\\n\\nThe music was a folky trio called Tiger Alley, lead by two amazing women whose voices mingled beautifully throughout the quaint backyard space.\\n\\nDefinitely give this spot a try.

This was our first character reservation to start our vacation.  When we entered we were seated at a very nice table close to the wicked queen who had not arrived.  Our waiter visited us promptly and spoke about the restaurant and took our order.  Our drinks, which were delicious came out quickly and soon after followed by our appetizers.  We enjoyed all the apps except the chicken terrine, not good at all.  We could not get over the texture and look of it.  They really need to replace this with something else.  The mushroom soup was delish, a bit salty but still very good.  The shrimp app was tasty as well.  Our main dishes were very good as well.  I had the sorceress land and sea which was very tasty.  My husband had the stroll through nature which he completely finished.  My daughters got the Mac and cheese which was soooooo good and cheesy and the other had the Royal prime rib roast which was perfectly cooked.  Then ALL the desserts came out.  The miners treasures, poison apple and the fairytale gooseberry pie were all great!  Then they brought out the hunter's gift to the queen which was a cool ending to our dinner.  Here is my only gripe and disappointment about our experience.  This is supposed to be a character experience, and it was, with Snow White, Grumpy and Dopey.  BUT, and a really big but, the Queen never arrived.  We were told she was held up and wouldn't be back until later that night:((((. They gave us complimentary photos in front of the book instead but that didn't make up for missing out on the best part of the character dining experience.  So maybe we'd do this restaurant again, maybe."},{"name":"Laurelthirst Public House","address":"2958 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Mama Julie makes the best quesadillas in Portland!
