Everything we ordered was as desired and the service was excellent-- attentive and professional. The fish was fresh, the prep classy-- creative but not overwhelming nor distracting. We had tempura veg, steamed gyoza, a show-stealing sashimi sampler, a ton of homemade tamago, a veg roll, a spicy tuna hand roll and a spicy salmon hand roll. I might be forgetting something...oh yeah, the friend green tea ice cream :) mmm. (still might be forgetting something)\\n\\nWell, anyway it's the best sushi we've had thus far and we've been to most of the top Yelp spots in the Boston area, bar Fish Market. Highly recommended. Will definitely be our go-to spot. \\n\\nThank you New Ginza."},{"name":"The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium And Savory Feast Kitchen","address":"Universal CityWalk Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This is my third review. As someone that lives in Florida I love going to fun restaurants and expanding my plate if you would. To be fair this is my second time here and I hate to say this but it was a really underwhelming experience. Our waiter was. Ice but seemed to be a little direct and took a very long time to get our meal and our check. I think the main complaint which seems to fall right on with other people's complaint is the food was cold. I had 2 other people and my spouse with me. I had the truffle fries side salad and the chicken. The fries were the hi light! My spouse and his father had burgers which again were cold and not properly dressed according to simple instructions. We did get a lot of ranch, I mean who doesn't love it. My ver close friend who is a leader in an unnamed establishment was extremely underwhelmed in regards to her BBQ flat bread and hummus and pita side. The chips seemed to be stale. I don't understand why the manager came over and said if we need anything let him know because when I did let him know he just said oh sorry. \\n\\nI also let the waiter know it was my spouses anniversary and I wasn't expecting anything free but was told I could buy something spectacular. All I got was him basically slamming the plate on the table with Happy Anniversary for a chocolate cream br√ªl√©e I ordered. I was so embarrassed and felt awful.  What can I do at this point was just smile and thank everyone for their gracious attempt and pay our bill and get out.\\n\\nHonestly I love the Mexican place sooo much and wish I had gone there instead. We wasted almost 100 dollars for another disappointing experience which is not bad because we frequent a lot of other restaurants. \\n\\nTo wrap it up I'm not going to say anything super negative because it may be your thing. Just know don't expect any accommodation if it's your b day or Anniversary like Disney does if you come here. This is a very busy atmosphere and it seems like it's just eat your food and get out! \\n\\nI love Universal but I will never come back to this particular restaurant. I suggest the many other wonderful options available! \\n\\nThank you for you hospitality and graciousness once again but at the end no matter how many gimmicks and charades you may have it all comes down to food and service and it was definitely lack luster.\\n\\nPass this restaurant and try the other amazing ones available trust me this is a true disappointment especially because I think of my childhood favorite movie with golden tickets in the candy bars!\\n\\nNo golden ticket for me!"},{"name":"Pip's Original Doughnuts & Chai","address":"4759 NE Fremont St, Ste C","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Not the biggest fan of chai, but I can appreciate when it's well done.

At the close of my meal it was necessary to give my butter covered hands a really good cleaning.  I am not overreacting when I say that the condition of the men's restroom was shockingly bad.  Just as bad as a run down gas station at the end of the day.  Even the soap dispenser was a disaster.  A wall mounted foam soap dispenser, the push mechanism was cracked and jagged, and the entire thing was covered with blackened soap scum.

The exterior architecture and design of the restaurant is absolutely amazing. Definitely 5 stars for that. The 2 hour and 20 minute estimated wait time? Not so much. My friend and I had been dead set on trying Toothsome ever since we found out it was being built. Even so, the wait time really tested my patience and commitment. We told ourselves that we would leave after an hour of waiting. We had actually decided to call it a night after waiting a little over our time limit, but luckily for Toothsome, we received a text saying our table was ready right before we did.\\n\\nWe asked for first available seating so we were seated outside and didn't get the full experience of eating in the dining room, which was fine. We did get the most amazing waiter that I've had at any restaurant in a while (here's to you SIRAJ!!). Siraj made sure that our experience was a great one and I take my hat off to him because keeping an upbeat and charismatic demeanor in such a hectic restaurant as Toothsome has to be difficult.\\n\\nI started off with the pork belly sliders which were really great. The chocolate covered bacon on top perfectly complimented the pork belly and arugula in the slider itself. I honestly think I could have eaten the bacon alone and still have been happy. \\n\\nFor my main course, I had the shrimp and lump crabmeat macaroni. For the record, this is NOT traditional mac & cheese with seafood added. It was an amazing dish, but the cheese sauce tasted more like a slightly spicy B√©chamel sauce. The dish could've used a little bit more sauce, in my opinion, but I'm a bit of a sauce fiend. It was still absolutely phenomenal. I wish I could eat it at least once a week.\\n\\nI was pretty full by dessert time, but there was no way I was leaving this place without trying something sweet. I went for the Chocolate x5 milkshake and had a brownie substituted for the whipped cream, strawberries, and chocolate spirals that usually comes on top of it. Siraj was able to make this happen for me (as I said, he was amazing) because I couldn't decide between the brownie milkshake and the chocolate x5. The result was absolute chocolate heaven in my mouth. Unfortunately, I could only finish less than half of it before my stomach made me slow my roll.

It's a lounge, but  they serve French food from the attached Chez Vincent. It's better for drinks and dessert than dining. The chairs, as people have mentioned are comfy, but not the best for sitting in to eat a full meal. The food at Chez Vincent is excellent, as is the service, so I suggest going there for dinner and going to Hannibals for cocktails. They have amazing desserts, and the souffle will blow your mind.

I have always loved the restaurant, even as a kid growing up in Houston.  When I got engaged this year, I knew immediately that I wanted Pappasito's to cater my wedding.  And they did an even more amazing job than I ever could have expected.  It was so simple for me to print the menus from online & decide what I wanted, then I called the office & made the order way in advance.  Juliet is the manager of the department and handled my order, my questions, all my changes & planning.  She...is...AWESOME!!!  She answered all my questions clearly & easily, was so easy to work with.  Then we got to the walk-through two weeks before my wedding at the venue with my coordinator there, & she really saved the day.  She was able to quickly walk through our venue & work easily with my coordinator to find all sorts of good places to set up an appetizer table, the bar, & the dinner buffet, like it was just second hand to her.  Best part was, she realized that I had ordered ceremony chairs separately & she offered to have her staff set up their rental chairs downstairs for the ceremony, then move them up to the reception room while my guests had drinks, & SHE called my rental company to cancel my chair order so I could get refunded!  And she kept offering set-up services for her cocktail staff to do for us, like set up our flowers, etc. but my coordinator was able to do a lot of that set up for me.  Point being, Juliet was eager to help out & proactive in informing me of what her staff would be able to do for us.\\n\\nCome to the wedding day, and the Pappasito's staff was amazing.  They set up the grill outside, on site, then brought the food in to the buffet table.  Everything looked amazing!  The staff came around & served our guests drinks and cake since we had to set those up in a separate room downstairs while we ate upstairs.  They took care to give my husband & I a couple plates of food first at the start of the reception, and more importantly, brought me a margarita!  I saw them dutifully cleaning everything up towards the end of the evening & breaking everything down.  They were all so sweet, they really made it a wonderful event!\\n\\nOh, & the quality of food is always amazing!!  That's why it's always been my favorite restaurant.  We chose to have beef & chicken fajitas with all the fixings and cheese enchiladas.  And must have chips, queso, and salsa--that's a given.  The coolest thing was the avocado bar where guests could get half an avocado filled with the salsa of their choice which includes shrimp ceviche or corn & black bean salsa or habenero cream sauce.  Mmmmmmm!  And the margaritas were excellent as always.  I happily lived off left over chips & salsa for a week, best chips & salsa ANYWHERE, EVER!\\n\\nSo I could not have been happier & I already I knew I made the best choice for catering.

Their super congenial waiter knows it by heart and even had us taste a great barolo from the menu, but it's even better if you know what you're looking for; we picked a Barbera: one of the cheapest wines on the menu, but probably one of the best, as the waiter raved later.\\n\\nAfter the wine came the appetizers or contorni/antipasti: we had their risotto balls (suppli) which were delicious and homely, their shisito peppers and their comforting polenta.\\n\\nFor primi piati: the second and most important reason we're so impressed by Vespaio. The first dish we tried was the Eggplant Parmesan pasta. Though we wished there was more eggplant, it was a very refreshing, light and floral tomato pasta. The second dish was the Butternut Squash ravioli, which was nothing short of divine; the ravioli melted in our mouths with a delicious sweetness and the taste of the flavored oil remained until hours after dinner.

Had to ask for more honey-lime dressing for the slaw.  \\n\\nServer did not bring out our food, bus tables or refill our drinks.   Others did that for him, yet he added a 20% gratuity for himself, since we were a party of 7.   How nice for him!   When I complained about the slaw and the gratuity, he became indignant very quickly.  The other half of our party asked for his manager.   \\n\\nWe explained we weren't informed of auto-gratuity for parties of 6 or more, the portion sizes were way too small for the $, and the slaw was dry cabbage.  Manager was very helpful and understanding - made up for lazy service.

However, luckily - reservations were had for New Years Eve.\\n\\nWe arrived on time and were seated quickly and the service was pleasant and attentive.  The menu was specifically made for the evening and our table ordered 3 different things along with a crab bisque. \\n\\nThe crab bisque had great flavor but was lacking any crab bits or shrimp to give it a bit of texture.  Some soggy mini croutons were strewn into the bisque that added bursts of buttery flavor.\\n\\nOur entrees were the Lasagna Alla Bolognase (which is on the regular menu and good as usual, a pasta dish with scallops (delicious albeit it seemingly a bit buttery after several bites) and some mezzaluna which were simply amazing.  My dish was a special rissoto with caviar and lump crabmeat and frisee.  I found the dish to be very salty - possibly due to the amount of caviar that was in the dish. The crab meat and frisee seemed to help cut the saltiness, but there wasn't enough to help with the entire dish.  Interesting concept, but was not one of my favorite Vespaio dishes.  \\n\\nWe did have an odd part of the evening when the manager came to thank us for coming into the restaurant.  It was nice, except for the awkwardness of the conversation since it was clear that the intent was to move us out so they could bring in the next guests.

The patty was not cooked medium and it was tasteless too. Dry and overly chewy I just smiled and washed it down with my drink. The waffle fries were not hot or fresh either.

I brought some clients by to try it out last week. Having only seen a few pics on Instagram, none of us really knew what to expect. \\n\\nThe interior is pretty spacious, with large family-style booths. The hustling waiter told us to just seat ourselves and we grabbed the table closest to the door. I'll admit I didn't spend much time looking around so can't really give any helpful details. \\n\\nThe menu is really interesting; they offer a large variety of items from tacos to dumplings to a variety of rice / noodle dishes, but obviously the standout is the Hello Chicken - a platter of flavored fried chicken and giant potato wedges meant to serve 2-3 people.  \\n\\nWe decided to split the Kimchi Bulgogi Quesadilla with Fries ($8.99) and the Half & Half Fried Chicken ($19.99). \\n\\nThe Kimchi Bulgogi Quesadilla was exceptionally delicious. I would order this again hands-down. Portion was great as an app for three hungry people but would be a satisfying entree as well. The fries are delicious, Checkers-style crispy fries and are served with gochujang on the side for dipping. \\n\\nI could not believe the massive platter of chicken that came out for the Half & Half. There had to be two entire chickens and a couple of pounds of potatoes on there! I enjoyed both the flavors we tried - Sweet & Spicy and Soy Garlic, but we finished every bite of the Soy Garlic, including the random bits of fried crispy chicken skin left on the plate. \\n\\nOverall, everything we had was tasty - but super heavy. I think we'd like to see a few lighter options on the menu. next time I'll probably try to one of the bento-style lunch boxes or bowls, so I can get some veggies in there as well."},{"name":"Cafe Intermezzo","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy, Councourse B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I had a few hours to waste during a layover and I was delighted to find this place.

I am a big fan of atmosphere and this place has it...I LOVE the sun and that is really why you go here.  If you don't love the sun blazing down on you then there are lots and lots and lots and lots and LOTS of umbrellas to try to shade you.  Which kinda ruin the view.  All the umbrellas are another view in themselves but not the view I go there for.  \\n\\nBut why does one go to a restaurant?  For food and drink of course and this place sucks in all aspects of food and drink.  Sorry guys.  Even the margarita, a necessary staple for an establishment centered around sitting in the sun viewing the lake, was awful.  I am pretty sure it was nothing but watered down sour mix.  And I even upgraded to a premium margarita!  The only food that I have had there worth eating was the crispy chicken sandwich which was super spicy and actually flavorful, unlike anything else I have had there.  \\n\\nSo do I go again?  Yeah, sometimes when I have visitors.  Because it is still a great view.

During the shuffling of orders they completely forgot about the lobster tail, however we were not charged. They were willing to waive the fee since it's only $5.50, but we paid anyway.  We found a seat and started eating our treats while waiting for the lobster tail. Everything was so tasty. The portion size was huge!

The house salad was just a garden salad, and their bean salad was fine, but I don't consider them salads, I consider them succotash or a mess of beans. Their soups are tasty, probably my favorite items on the menu. The sandwiches are flavorful but overpriced. The much raved-about guava sandwich is just some cheese and guava paste between two pieces of white bread one tier above Wonder brand, and the other sandwiches didn't have much more than that. I feel like if I'm paying $6-$9 for a sandwich, I should be getting better than something that I can make in 5 minutes with Market Basket ingredients.\\n\\nThe espresso is fine, but one thing that Starbucks doesn't do is charge extra for putting their espressos on ice. And really, no power outlets and no bathrooms? Seriously?? Is this how they do things in Spain? Just because you call it European doesn't make this acceptable.

I'm sure the store broke all sorts of maximum capacity laws. \\n\\nI had in mind to buy one cannoli. Raymond, from Everybody Loves Raymond, seems to love it when his mom makes it, so I thought I would! Then, I saw a black and white cookie. I love Seinfeld (usually relates everything in my life to it) and remember the episode where Jerry bought a black/white cookie. I knew I had to try it. I also saw a yellow cream puff. No show tied to it... just wanted to try it! I bought all those plus an oreo gelato for my bf. All for $12. Not too bad. \\n\\nWith only a handful of tables, it's hard to find a spot to sit at.

I really enjoyed the hazelnut cannoli. It was super sweet and the shell had a nice crunch to it. The black/white cookie was moist. The icing tasted like icing on a donut. Chocolate and vanilla icing... no complaints here! The yellow cream puff was good, but I'd probably not get it again. The pastry was a little too hard and not soft enough.

I had the chicken tacos, and my boyfriend had the flautas/quesadilla combo.  Both were delicious.  Is it the best mexican food I've ever had?  No, nor do I have any clue as to its authenticity.

In fact the service was impeccable throughout the meal. \\n\\nWe ordered cocktails, the wild boar ribs and hummus appetizers. The cocktails were good as were the ribs.

For the main course I had the brisket which came with some pickles and my companion had the chicken along with the broccoli and mac and cheese side dishes. \\n\\nAs with other reviewers I think the brisket was fine but not as moist as I've had at other places. The chicken was pretty good but my companion said she likes the chicken at Whole Foods better. \\n\\nWhat really faltered were the side dishes.

After you sit, staring, like Indiana Jones stared at the Chachapoyan Fertility Idol, you make your first incision. If you haven't panicked, then well done. You can begin to enjoy.

The standard style is English muffin, egg, monster cheese (so named for the nocturnal beasts that roam Coolidge Corner, picking off unsuspecting tourists, I can only assume), and Canadian bacon. My friends each get a slight modification: bagels, and Bill asks, \\"May my cheese please be cheddar?\\" Yes, Bill. Yes, it may. The sandwiches were artisanally crafted. The meat was salted just the appropriate amount to balance out the cheese. The default mode of egg is over easy -- I would recommend getting them cooked just a bit more, to avoid over-gooification. Alternatively, Bill ordered egg whites, which seemed to also work.\\n\\nPro tip: it doesn't open until 8 am!

The server recommended this. I had no idea what it was and had low expectations but turned out to be my favorite dish. It's a dumpling with meat inside and a little bit of sour cream on top. These tiny things have so much flavor. I could probably eat 2 plates of these myself.\\n\\n- BLACK PEPPER POPOVERS : my least favorite dish. 3 small popovers (hollow patries) with Wagyu Steak tartar. Tartar is raw beef, so just be aware if you're not into that. Whatever the tartar was seasoned in, it had wasabi mixed in and I don't like the taste of wasabi at all. Even if the wasabi wasn't there, the dish is still eh. Youre eating cold raw beef, with a tiny bland Popover. Pass.\\n\\n- CHARRED OCTOPUS : literally the most tender octopus I've ever had. This was amazing. It's one giant tentacle. The end of it is charred and crispy, and then really soft and tender as you go up to the meaty part of it. Comes with potatoes, onions, and vinaigrette. Only thing I didn't like about the dish was the vinaigrette. Its drizzled a bit on the bottom of the plate but I didn't like it with the octopus.

This place is a feast for the eyes! Outside it looks like a Willy Wonka-esque Chocolate Factory!\\n\\nOnce inside there's an amazing waiting area/chocolate shop and the over all theme transitions to Steam Punk. So many pretty colors - macaron after macaron = a full rainbow. Handmade/painted chocolates. You could spend half an hour alone just looking around - and maybe that's the plan because you most likely will have to wait.\\n\\nInsert Pro Tip here - if you are staying at one of the Premium resorts here and you show them your room key you can get priority seating (seated sooner than others) - here's the catch though - if the wait is only 20-30 minutes it doesn't apply - if it's close to an hour or longer it applies - still no reservations though.\\n\\nWe only waited twenty minutes- a host escorted us to a table and joked around with us. The kids opted to take the factory elevator instead of the stairs. The dining room is two stories and the walls are all video screens with images of behind the scenes at the candy factory; pretty clever way to hide what goes on behind the scenes.\\n\\nOur waitress, Jordan, was very perky and helped us with some menu selections. We got a bottle of wine to start (Argentinian Malbec under $30) and although it had a screw cap which I couldn't sniff (lol) it was really good stuff. As an appetizer we had the Brussels sprouts with lime and ancho chile powder = addictive and delicious.\\n\\nI was really excited to order a Nicoise Salad - one of my favorite dishes but was a little disappointed when I got it. On the positive side the tuna was cooked nicely and the dressing was good. On the negative side a lot of the ingredients were pre chopped and not many of them. There were barely any green beans and the pieces I fond were small - I felt like a kid who had his Mom cut his food up for him. I also got half a hard boiled egg - I kept looking around the dining room to see who might have gotten the other half. Did I mention my one sixth piece of tomato? My wife's Chicken Bourgignon was flavorful but again the sizes of the sides/garnishes were small.\\n\\nAnd of course for desert we had to get a couple of the $12 milkshakes. Admittedly they are big, beautiful and overloaded with sweet excess. I found the quality of the ice cream to be lacking and the sour cream flavor in the Strawberry Cheesecake one just weird. I also noticed some rather large air voids in the shakes.\\n\\nThe food I'd rate 3 stars - throw in a fourth star for atmosphere, cool costumes and attentive staff.

It was getting late but my hosts decided to come here even though they were closing in less then an hour. You would expect walking in to a restaurant 90 minutes before closing on a Monday for the staff to be rude or annoyed but just the opposite. The service was impeccable. Our waiter went above and beyond for us even though we were the only diners by that point. \\nThe hostess gave us a cozy booth overlooking the water. We started with :\\n-The Colossal Shrimp cocktail, which comes out smoking on ice. It made a great little video. It came w/4 huge shrimp which was so sweet and house made cocktail sauce which blew my mind. \\nNext up was:\\n-Goat cheese pimento fritters w/a jelly sauce that just makes these worth ordering. Plus don't you have to order pimento cheese your first night when visiting the south? I think it the law\\nNext was:\\n-Maine Lobster Bisque which tasted great, I only eat Maine Lobster but the claw I had atop my soup was overcooked but the bisque was amazing but too filling for one person. \\n- for the Maine course 3 of us ordered the steamed Maine Lobster 2 they had pre cracked but I wanted to get right in there and crack it all myself, since I've spent so many summers in Maine and that's what you do. It appeared I had more meat in my I cracked  lobster the others. Aside from that it was so sweet and cooked just how I like it. My mashed potatoes were also so creamy and unique. \\nThe other diner ordered \\n-the scallops over lobster risotto. I tasted it and it was ok but I don't care for scallops in general but she adores this dish and gets it every time.\\nWe had no room left for dessert but gave in to temptation. \\n-the creme br√ªl√©e was classic perfectly cracky \\n-the hazelnut cake was a surprise from our waiter and it was much appreciated and delicious. \\nMy friend who I love is so annoying and only want caramelized bananas, not a menu item, but the chef made them for her anyway. She loved them and ate every bite. \\n\\nI couldn't finish my diner and asked to bring half of it home. The waiter obliged but I never got my leftovers, they never came out.

I overlooked the fact that they gave us the wrong topping,  even though there were only three toppings, and took a big bite of the small pizza. Not impressed whatsoever. For half the price I could have got a frozen pizza, which would have tasted the same if not better.\\nSo let's look at the service. On the positive side, the waiter refilled our drinks in a timely manner. However when we were ready to leave after an expensive dinner the waiter was nowhere to be found.

I was a frequenter of there and Hunan and Jasmine Tree and Uncle Chen and Shanghai Noble House, most of which are gone now.  It was a very quiet and relaxing sort of place to go eat dinner, as any good Chinese restaurant always is.  I hate to admit that I am old enough to remember going there many times in the 80s.  I think their time has passed.  But, they must be getting enough customers in order to stay open.  The last time I went there it was somewhat disappointing.  For some reason, the party I was with wanted three different chicken dishes and although they were different menu items, they all tasted pretty much the same.  Anyhow, I'm glad they're still open but I think they need to do something drastic with the menu.  Offer some new stuff or put a different spin on the place.  Most restaurants like this have owners who kinda gave up long ago and have the attitude of 'if it's not broke, dont' fix it.'"},{"name":"Kona Grill","address":"11410 Century Oaks Ter","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been to the Domain many times, I've eaten at Jasper's a handful of times, the Daily Grill, even CPK. But I walk past Kona as if it doesn't exist. I honestly didn't even know what was on their menu until I went there. After an exciting shopping trip a girlfriend and I needed a few cocktails and she said they had reverse happy hour - sooo okay! It was about 7:30, maybe 8? and if you want to sit outside you can seat yourself. If you give me that option, I will be that person who possibly takes up the 5 person table with only 2 of us. Whatever! We were there to celebrate! \\n\\nBefore looking at the menu we we ordered drinks, like all places now they have a list of \\"skinny/low calorie\\" margs. Any restaurant that has the name \\"Grill\\" in it I can generally assume if there is a decent skinny marg available I should probably go for it. I spent all summer on a spicy margarita kick and I don't see it slowing down anytime soon so I asked the waiter if the bartender could turn then margarita into a spicy one. He wasn't sure what I meant, but the bartender did. He/she muddled some jalapeno pepper or what not in there and it made that watered down margarita taste fantastic. (I know it would have tasted watered down otherwise because A. It's a \\"skinny margarita\\" and B. My friend got her first one sans the spice) \\n\\nAt some point after ordering/receiving food the manager (I think that was him?) came over and asked how the margarita was and talked about how he had just come from the Houston location. Nice guy - kept his conversation minimal. Same with the waiter. He could tell we were there to gossip/chat/be female/drink margaritas and barely touch our food and he didn't seem annoyed by the fact that we took up such a huge table by ourselves. Even if he was annoyed, he didn't let on. \\n\\nSo you ask why 3 stars? Well, eventually one does have to eat. The place is called Kona Grill. People (per Yelp at least) rave about their happy hour/sushi yatta yatta so I didn't think it was so far fetched to order the Potstickers/Miso soup as my meal. I have had a lot of potstickers in my time. I find myself annoyed, often by the entire Austin area's lack of good Asian food of any kind. I should not have let this be the time where I thought maybe I'll find a good pot sticker. The menu said it was one of the \\"fave\\" items and described it as pan seared chicken and vegetable dumplings. This may have been the case, but it was like someone took hamburger meat, let it dry a little, shoved it into a frozen dumpling then sealed it back up and put it on a pan and served it. yes, they looked pretty all golden brown on the outside. But what was I eating? I have no idea. My friend had a pizza, it looked good. I don't know - just seems weird to order a pizza in a place like that but now I know why. I mean I guess if you are shopping at the Domain and you need a place to go it's not half bad or too expensive.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, nice to not be bothered by a waiter, he recognized we were sitting around having girl chat for 3 hours and just wanted to have a few drinks. Don't know why there is any hype about any food that comes out of that kitchen. I'm sure there are 10 other places in a 5 miles radius where you can get just about anything on their menu that would taste better. Don't get the dumplings.

The noodles weren't what I imagined - thin, stringy clear noodles.  The others enjoyed, though.\\n+ Duck Sub:  Marinated Carrot * Cucumber * Cilantro * Asian Pear * Pickled Raisins * Japanese Mayo.  I am never an order'er of duck ... I had a slice of this Sub and it was really, really tasty! Impressive.  And LARGE.  \\n+ Avocado Salad:  Grapefruit * Watercress * Lemon & Olive Oil.  In my Top 3 of dishes here!  I'm not counting the Edamame or Olives ... Those were mere appies.  This salad was DELISH, fresh, tart.\\n+ Pickled Beets & Egg:  Japanese Mayo * Radish Sprouts * Panko Bread Crumbs.  Let's put it this way, my girlfriend that does NOT like beets, LOVED this.  This salad was AMAZING!  Again, part of my Top 3.\\n+ Rock Cod Ceviche:  Chili * Lime * Sesame Oil * Cilantro * Pea Shoots.  Top 3.  I want to eat this everyday! Every. Day. Tangy. Spicy.

Two others at our table who ordered the Prix Fixe with salmon enjoyed their meal, one who ordered a steak was unimpressed as his steak was overcooked and tough. Overall the food was nothing memorable. \\n\\nOn a side note, I really dislike websites that pop up music in the background. I'm there for their menu and location information. I don't want their favorite music shoved at me. Especially when I've already got MY favorite music playing."},{"name":"Waterloo Ice House Southpark Meadows","address":"9600 S Ih 35 Frontage Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Food is ok, breakfast is good, service is so-so but the patio and the playground next to it is amazing.

When we got there(17 of us), we had a section on the 1st floor sharing the room with another party of 12 people.  This party was extremely loud, overbearing, and ignorant to the fact that there was another party present.  We asked to be moved which at first  they said no but we were extremely dissatisfied so they offered to move us to the basement forgetting that we were with a man in a wheelchair.  We were stuck.  Moving on we tried to listen to the waitress with the specials and were informed that they had no calamari or clams casino which were 2 of the 6 appetizers to choose from. We considered leaving but where can you go with 17 people?  At 3:45 I finally asked if we could order drinks.  Very unorganized wait staff and very demanding table behind us.  We order, our food comes, one meal not what we ordered, the other was specially requested NO mushrooms and it was smothered with them.  The pasta sides took another 10 minutes to come and we weren't offered any different choices.  Penne only!  Really?  We were in the North End weren't we?  Food was average. Nothing great. So we asked for the desert menus and were told we were not allowed to have coffee or desert because there was an event at the local sports arena.  How can you not tell us that in September when we booked a birthday party?  We asked to talk to the manager and the waitress came back saying my dad could have coffee and desert but just him!!!!  We asked again to speak to the manager but he wouldn't  come out to talk to us.  We requested the bill, paid the amount with a 20% tip to the staff which got the brunt of our anger.  \\n    I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. Poor food. Poor management.

Someone at my table was pregnant and thus tried to avoid the raw items on the menu. Before you think \\"why was she at a sushi restaurant then?\\" you can just stop there. There are cooked items available (rice included), so there's absolutely no reason why she shouldn't be able to eat there. As such, her husband asked to have his spicy sashimi don separated so that his wife could share the rice without it touching the raw fish. It's something that he's done before at the same location so he didn't expect what occurred next. \\n\\nThe server (it wasn't really his fault as he was just the messenger) notified the husband that they couldn't separate it. Having said that his wife was pregnant and that he had done it before, the server then went back and asked the back-end again to see if it was possible to split the don. He came back and his response was to order sushi rice separately, then order the sashimi separately. \\n\\nSo essentially, they couldn't split the don if you bought it. But if you want to buy the fish and rice separately, you definitely can.

However, Remy promised me that I wouldn't taste the cheese. \\n\\nI also ordered scrambled eggs, Turkey slices and orange juice - which she informed me is always freshly squeezed. Once I picked up my breakfast and headed back to the hotel, I was instantly pleased with how the breakfast was packed and everything separated. I tasted the orange juice and it has got to be the BEST orange juice I have ever had in my entire life! Not only was it fresh, it was also sweet and I literally felt like I had the actual fruit in my mouth! The pancakes were fluffy, soft and uterly delicious!!! (Remy was right, I absolutely did not taste any cheese). The turkey slices were seasoned to perfection and there was also freshly sliced bananas in my pancakes. To top it all off, Northstar gives you 2 slices of the most delicious bread you will ever taste. I am beyond satisfied with this restaurant and will be ordering again before I leave. So happy I found Northstar!"},{"name":"Lee's Bakery","address":"4005 Buford Hwy NE, Ste C","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Great place! Cheap, great quality and large portions.

We had eaten here once before a couple of years ago and we're not overly impressed. \\n\\nToday's experience was much better. The service was friendly and efficient. They came by several times during the meal to refill our coffee and tea. They even came by after we had paid the bill. This was refreshing as often you get ignored once you've paid. \\n\\nWe had three dishes, the gyro skillet, the bacon skillet and bacon & eggs. The eggs on all the dishes were nicely cooked including my wife's poached eggs. The bacon on the eggs & bacon dish was cooked crisp as requested but the hash browns were under cooked for us. I don't mean to indicate that they were raw but just not nicely browned. \\n\\nBoth skillets were large enough for a teenager or to share. We took half of each home to reheat. \\n\\nThe one big slip up was the sausage gravy. It was tasteless and cold. The gravy was ordered on the side and they didn't use a warm dish so it cooled the gravy off quickly. \\n\\nThe big hit of the meal was the biscuit. They make them there so they are fresh, light and airy. Probably the best biscuits in the Beaverton-Hillsboro area. Definitely better than the biscuits currently being served at Biscuits. \\n\\nThe one minus is that they only have little packets of generic jelly which doesn't do them justice. But they do give you a big spoon of soft butter for them. Stay with the butter and honey unless your a fan of Smuckers. \\n\\nOverall the place wasn't good enough to make it into our regular rotation of breakfast establishments but good enough to back ever few months. \\n\\nIf you're in the area and looking for an inexpensive breakfast you can't do better in Beaverton."},{"name":"Tijuana Flats","address":"13651 Hunter's Oak Dr, Ste 107","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Yo I ordered this expecting it to be amazing bc of the reviews and it was ASSS.

Both lovely, but hard to even compare it to our entrees. For our mains, we decided on a complete family style approach. We ordered the brisket, pork ribs and the new(er) short rib dish. Our sides included the brussle sprouts, Mac n cheese, and green chile grits. \\n\\nI was blown away by the short rib dish. I've enjoyed the brisket before but this was really fantastic. The meat was tender and juicy and so flavorful. Brisket, the old stand by, was excellent on its own but I enjoyed their spicy barbecue sauce with them. Personally I wasn't as crazy about the pork ribs but the rest of the guests seem to really enjoy it! \\n\\nOur sides were just as enjoyable. The Mac n cheese is some of the best in town but beware- it is decadent. The brussle sprouts added some nice greenery to the plate and had a good crunch. Now, the grits, my boyfriend, originally from New Orleans, just loved. But for the three Yankees sitting at the table it wasn't our favorite. I liked the flavors but not the consistency. \\n\\nThe dishes were also served with an apple slaw that I really loved! Such a fabulous and light compliment to the heavier flavors. We also got the pickled cauliflower and onion and something else. Tasty but not my favorite thing. The three sauces are Always great additions to the meat. I love their spicy sauce but the mustard is pretty great too. \\n\\nAfter such a great experience I'm sure we will be back soon to enjoy some Fancy Barbecue. Many thanks to Hugh for being so on point last night."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"4615 N Lamar Blvd, Ste 307","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"The burgers were amazing.

I would rate this restaurant as a solid \\"4 stars,\\" the meal and overall experience were all good, and certainly in the upper half of sit-down restaurants at Disney World, but it also did not have enough of a \\"wow\\" effect for me to rate it \\"5 stars.\\" Here's a breakdown of our meal and overall experience so you can decide:\\n\\nFood: Highs and lows. The menu is very strong, but the dishes are so large and filling (on a whole) that it's impossible to try very many at one meal unless you have a large party. We started with the bread and some \\"signature\\" (as in, unique to La Cellier) glasses of wine and beer. All were a tasty way to whet our appetite. Next, we ordered the \\"porterhouse for two,\\" which comes with an absolutely HUGE steak (28 oz I believe) topped with fried onions and accompanied by two sides. While they suggest the brussels sprouts and mashed potatoes, you can actually choose any two sides (called \\"enhancements\\") besides the lobster, and we opted to replace the potatoes with asparagus instead just because they seemed lighter. \\n\\nEven with ordering two veggie sides, we could barely finish our entire meal, and we both eat a lot (and stopped eating that day at around noon in preparation for our 7:30pm reservation). Certainly, the porterhouse is a good value for the price. The steak was cooked perfectly and tasted good (but was not the absolute best I've ever had either). The accompanying peppercorn (\\"au poivre\\") sauce was really good, but the \\"b√©arnaise\\" sauce tasted like little more than cheap ranch dressing; it was probably the biggest disappointment of the evening for us. To make matters worse, the asparagus was also covered in the same ranch dressing (\\"b√©arnaise\\"), which made us not like it very much. The brussels sprouts, on the other hand, were really, really yummy; charred just right and covered with a sweet maple topping.\\n\\nService: On point, perfectly attentive, and very knowledgeable about the menu. We had to wait about 15 minutes after our reservation time to be seated, but that was ok with us.\\n\\nThe restaurant: a very cozy, upscale ambiance. Comfy tables and more than enough room on the table. The only think we really did not like was the bathrooms: they were in desperate need of updating. Otherwise, nice.\\n\\nAll in all, a fun meal in the Canada pavilion of Epcot. While there are other restaurants we like better at Disney, this one is in the upper third of all of the ones we have tried, and is a must for steak lovers!"},{"name":"Modern Pastry Shop","address":"257 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Frozen foods.

I've been drooling over Rockmill's instagram photos since it opened, and we finally went for dinner and brunch this week. The space is beautiful -- it's matched the industrial, exposed brick feel with warm wood tones in its seating and tables. We sat in the open upstairs on a quiet Tuesday night, which would be a fantastic space for a small event, like a graduation or engagement dinner. Service was warm and friendly, not the fastest, but still attentive. But really, the food!!\\n\\nDINNER\\n- Beet & cheese salad: Refreshing and delicious marinated beets, lettuce, almonds, and super addictive Cloverton cheese. Doesn't skimp on beets or cheese, either.\\n- Veggie toast: Rotating special, and this week was loaded with arugula. My friend seemed to really enjoy it.\\n- Spicy chicken sandwich: I'm a spice wimp, so the kitchen was kind enough to deconstruct the urfa mayo, spicy honey butter, and chili oil from the chicken for us. Honestly, it was just the chili oil that was too hot, so we slathered the other stuff on. The chicken was AMAZING, perfectly fried and tender and juicy on a brioche bun. The zucchini-pickles are delicious, too. Get this, for sure.\\n- Branzino: A pan-fried white fish, hearty but still delicate, smothered in salsa verde. Really well cooked and flavorful.\\n- Cheesy biscuits: The cheese flavor isn't super strong, and the biscuits are more like soft scones than flaky biscuit, but it's still a yummy treat, especially with that not-too-spicy honey butter.\\n- Brussel sprouts: Less crispy because they pile them on top of each other, but incredibly sweet with a kick of mustard. I wish they would spread them out for maximal crunch out of the oven, but great flavor.\\n- Beer list is from Rockmill Brewery, and there are lots of interesting options, including three saisons that rotate seasonally!\\n\\nBRUNCH\\n- Egg sandwich: SO good! Fried egg with a little runny yolk on a buttery toasted bun, with plenty of arugula, cheese, sweet bacon jam, pickled onion, and dijonaise. That bacon jam is the star, full of crunchy bacon bits and really tasty.\\n- The poached egg on top of a cheesy biscuit is beautiful -- but the sharp cheddar taste (which wasn't as present in the dinner cheesy biscuits?) was overpowering.\\n\\nThere is a happy hour until 6:30 on weekdays, and the deals for drinks are better than those for food (think small plates/sides -$1 or so).\\n\\nI am so so pleased with Rockmill's ambiance and food quality, and I really didn't think the prices were unreasonable for Columbus-trendy. I will definitely return to try the rest of the menu, especially the brioche French toast and the desserts!\\n\\nOne small note for our server from Tuesday night: When someone orders wine and there's still a sip left at the bottom of the glass, don't clear it without asking!!!!!

It is served in a plain shell (so as not to detract from the more subtle hazelnut favoring) contains a hazelnut flavored filling with chopped up hazelnuts as the side toppings.

It is currently 2 Meal Points on the Disney Dining Plan, and considered a Signature Restaurant.  We traditionally choose Le Cellier for Lunch (due to the fact that it used to be only 1 Point for Lunch, but this has since changed... but lunch just became a tradition). Traditionally our Family chooses the Deluxe Dining Plan when we travel.  It gives you the most bang for your buck. Each member of your party gets 3 Dining Credits Per Day of your stay (but you can use them however, and whenever you want)  To me this offers the ultimate flexibility.  It also gives everyone an Appetizer, Meal, and Dessert allowing you to maximize your samplings in the various restaurants.  We are foodies, and a huge part of our Disney trip is around the amazing restaurants.  Food is all part of the experience when you travel in my opinion.  \\n\\nThe Magical (Pros):\\n\\nThe restaurant transports you into a Canadian Wine Cellar.  It's dark, cool, and makes you feel far from Sunny Florida.  The bread served on the table here is delicious (especially the Pretzel Bread) paired with the Maple Butter.  Be careful not to fill up on this though.  You will still need to get through an Appetizer, Meal and Dessert if you are on the Deluxe Dining Plan. \\n\\nFor Appetizers I would recommend the Cheese Soup (made with beer), and delicious, or going for the Poutine Fries.  Both are salty creamy goodness.  \\n\\nthe beer menu is great here as well... I traditionally like to try new beers when traveling, and you can get some pretty strong brews in house.  Great to wash down the Appetizers.\\n\\nFor the meal I have tried multiple items, and I can't help but keep going back to the Filet with Mushroom Risotto.  It is by far the best item on the menu for flavor.  I rarely have a single bite left, and if it wasn't odd I would probably lick the plate.  This filet is that good, but the Risotto is what completes the dish for me.  \\n\\n\\nThe Wicked (Cons):\\n\\nI may be in the minority here, but I don't find the desserts here that appealing.  They are ok, but I think there are far better desserts around the park and resorts.  For me this is the least exciting part of the Canadian experience.  Nothing is bad, and I have tried almost all of them, but nothing has the WOW factor either. \\n\\nTime is another con.  As is the case with most Signature Dining experiences they tend to take awhile.  It is nice to get out of the sun and heat for awhile (why we usually choose lunch), but lunch at Le Cellier can be a 2 hour experience for a family of 4.  If you aren't at the parks from the gate open until the last firework falls like my family this could be a major blow to your day.\\n\\nIn the End:\\n\\nIf you are a meat eater, and love beer this will be a great treat.  For me this is arguably the best restaurant in Epcot for overall food quality.  If you are on the Deluxe Dining Plan this is a no brainer.  Just book well in advance.  Every year we feel sad for families who walk up trying to get into the restaurant without reservation's... having that happen has to be 1 in a Million so book early!"},{"name":"Grand Floridian Cafe","address":"4401 Floridian Way","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Dined at the grand floridian cafe for  lunch and dinner on separate occasions.

We found 2 seats at the bar and proceeded to order the following:\\n\\n(1) Salmon hash - my husband ordered this dish and it was tasty! salmon scrambled with fluffy scrambled eggs, with some sauce lathered into it. If you like cooked salmon, this dish is for you. the dish also comes with toast, and my husbanded added an order of 2 eggs, over easy. yum! 4 stars\\n\\n(2) Mike's special scramble - i ordered this dish and it was very good as well. scrambled eggs with all the fixin's. this dish comes with a side of toast and roasted potatoes (tasty!) :) 4 stars \\n\\n(3) Orange juice - fresh squeezed OJ is the best in the morning, just pricey though. \\n\\n(4) Bloody Mary - my husband ordered this, it seemed like a popular item and he enjoyed it since he likes tomato juice, lol. I am not a fan of bloody mary's typically...\\n\\nWe ate our meal quickly and service was reasonably fast - glad we were able to squeeze in a quick breakfast near our hotel that Saturday morning! :) yummos..."},{"name":"Zaftigs Delicatessen - Brookline","address":"335 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"I went on a recommendation from the Hotel staff while I was in Brookline.

The price ($40/person) was more reasonable compared to Four Seasons and a friend that's been before also had good things to say about her experience at Astor Court.\\n\\nI tried to call (404.563.7799) but was directed via their voicemail to make my reservation online at https://www.opentable.com/astor-court-atlanta\\nI made sure to book my reservation about 3 weeks out from the actual date to ensure a spot. I needed to make changes to my online reservation but did not want to loose my spot due the size of my party (8 people for the original reservation) so I called and left a voicemail instead to add a person. I was also impressed the week of Astor Court had someone call and confirm my reservation and asking if there were any special requests/allergies besides the 1 gluten-free guest I had included with my online reservation. There was no additional charge for the gluten-free option which I was very happy with. I had a friend who is allergic to mangos so that was good to mention to Astor Court.\\n\\nCouple girlfriends and I arrived a few minutes earlier to check out the hotel and take pictures on the pretty stairs as girls like to do. Once it was time of the reservation (2:30pm), I checked in with the hostess which was located on the second floor from the main lobby. They took us to our seats right away.\\n\\nWe waited a few minutes for the rest of the party to arrive and our server and his assistance started telling us a bit of history regarding the afternoon tea tradition and what teas they had to offer. We sniffed each and every single option and at the end picked what we wanted. There was also a good selection of caffeine-free teas to choose from as well. Everyone gets one personal pot with one choice of tea but unlimited hot water refills.\\n\\nAfter we picked our teas, they brought us each our individual pots. We were served scones first. My gluten-free option had coconut and chocolate chips which was different from the regular fruit scones. Scones are always heavy but while they're hot and fresh, I couldn't resist and ate both of mine. While we were still enjoying our scones, they brought out the trays with all the goodies. I got my individual tray as mine was gluten-free. The rest of the trays had 3 people's portions on them.\\n\\nOverall I would say I had a great time enjoying my first afternoon tea at Astor Court. The service was great and the treats were delicious. My friends and I were also able to enjoy a relaxing afternoon eating, drinking, and chatting. $40/person might be a bit over priced but I think it's the fancy set up and the great service that is part of the St. Regis name. They also auto gratuitied since we had a large party. I would recommend going for any special occasions or if you just want to try it out.

After a couple missed opportunities and not knowing the hours I finally made it today. The result: 100% worth it and I'm already planning a return. \\n\\nShowing up late was a blessing and a curse, as I missed the usual line, but a few chicken options were out. I was already dark meat inclined, so I ordered that, with a \\"warm\\" spiciness (as opposed to cold, hot, or holy). That was it. Sides included, a drink included, and I picked up a dessert of banana pudding just to get the whole experience. I like limited options.\\n\\nI easily found a seat at the long communal picnic tables, which gave the whole thing a very fun, jovial feel. A few minutes later my name was called, I grabbed my box, and dove in.\\n\\nThe chicken was killer, and was hot (although I'd go hotter next time) but in a very flavorful way, not simply the burn of capsaicin. Warm, moist (extra dark meat style moist), sweet, and even a little bit cinnamon-y I got all the notes I'd heard about good Nashville hot chicken having. The sides more than met the same standard, a nice cooling cole slaw and a rich and creamy mac and cheese. I even scarfed up the traditional white bread underneath the chicken, soaked in delicious spicy chicken juice. Even a traditional sweet tea to wash it all down.\\n\\nThe dessert I got on a whim, banana pudding not being a usual favorite of mine, but wow was I wrong. Rich banana flavor, a super dense cream, and just the right amount of texture from crumbled cookies (I think the traditional Nilla Wafers) really rounded out the meal.\\n\\nLook I want to tell you to go, for your own good, but for mine I want you to stay away.

Mike's and Modern are right across the street from each other. Just like the rivalry between Philly Cheesesteak establishments, Gino's and Pat's, it is dead intense. In my opinion, both pastry stores have their distinct strengths that attract loyal followers.\\nI came on a Saturday afternoon and the line already formed outside the store. After about 20 minutes wait, I got inside and was absolutely excited to see beautiful pastries on display and could not wait to try their legendary cannoli and other pastries.\\nThey have all kinds of chocolate truffles, Italian chocolates, wafers, home-made cannoli, cupcakes, cakes, fruit tarts, biscotti, and bread. I ordered 2 mini cannoli, 1 chocolate biscotti, one chocolate almond bar and a chocolate covered strawberry all for $8! I am so delighted by the price because in NYC that would have cost me more than $15 easily.\\nSo, after trying their cannoli, my judgment is that their cannolis are truly the best! Unlike Mike's Pastry or any other cannoli I have tried, Modern's cannoli is crispy on the outside and ultra soft and fresh inside. Fresh squeezed cream does make a difference! The other pastries are great too and their chocolate biscotti is full of pure chocolate. On the other hand, Mike's Pastry definitely outshines Modern in terms of variety of pastries and desserts (they have gelato too!)

They had just the right amount of cherry flavoring in the pastry portion and the fresh cherry in the middle was just sweet enough to not distract from the overall flavor.\\n\\nAnd when I discovered half of my lady's leftover lemon cannoli in the box and ate it (with her permission of course), my knees not only buckled but my eyes crossed.

Similar to TLV, the Crazy Cuban has kept the majority of Quiznos' build-out the same, including some signage.  The restaurant is located on the ground level of a two-story restaurant and office building at the corner of Windy Hill Rd. and Powers Ferry Rd.  Same complex as Mellow Mushroom.  I stopped by here for lunch yesterday with four others for the latest Cobb UYE (http://www.yelp.com/events/marietta-cobb-county-lunch-uye).\\n\\nThe Crazy Cuban's menu needs some serious work.  The menu is located above and behind the counter and open kitchen.  It's dim and hard to read.  The type on the menu is tiny!  Not only that, but many changes have been made to the menu in Sharpie marker -- prices added, crossed out, item descriptions revised, etc.  It can be a little confusing.  Fortunately, if you're reading this review, I can break it down for you.\\n\\nThe restaurant serves 8 sandwiches.  They are:\\n\\n1. Classic Cuban\\n2. Traditional Cuban\\n3. Media Noche\\n4. Mojo Pork\\n5. Ham & Cheese\\n6. Turkey & Cheese\\n7. Veggie\\n8. Grilled Cheese\\n\\nFrequently asked question: What is the difference between the Classic Cuban and the Traditional Cuban?\\n\\nAnswer: In addition to Cuban bread, mojo, ham, pork, Swiss cheese, mustard, and pickles, the Traditional Cuban *does not* have lettuce, tomato, onions, and jalapeno.  The Classic does.\\n\\nThe main difference between the Cuban sandwiches and Media Noche sandwiches is the bread.  The bread used for Cubans is crustier and crispier than the softer, sweeter bread used for Media Noches.  Both sandwiches are warmed in a hot press before serving.\\n\\nEach sandwich can be ordered as half or whole.  Most of the half sandwiches are about $4, while wholes are $6.  Sandwiches can be turned into combos for an additional $2.24, but I'm not sure if the combos are worth it.  Combos include a bag of chips and a fountain drink.\\n\\nChips include plantain chips, but the chips are separated into two sections: (1) $2.00 \\"standard\\" size bags of chips and (2) $1.00 miniature size bags of chips.  If you order a combo, you have to grab one of the miniature-sized bags.  The bags are tiny.\\n\\nSides include white rice, black beans, and salad for $2-3 each and dessert flan ($2.50).  Canned/bottled beverages include Cuban soft drinks like Materva and Ironbeer (not really beer nor root beer), $1.85 each.\\n\\nI had the Classic Cuban and a can of Ironbeer.  The Classic Cuban was pretty good.  The bread is an important part of the Cuban sandwich and I think they got it right.  The loaf was delicious - crispy and buttery.  The sandwich was loaded and overflowing with shredded lettuce.  Very oniony too.  If you don't like spicy food, watch out for the jalapenos.  They're fresh and are served chopped.\\n\\nI thought the quality of the meat was OK.  The slices of ham weren't overly salty, which was good.  The melted Swiss cheese and mojo sauce were what really made the sandwich savory.\\n\\nIf you like soda, try a Materva or Ironbeer.  I can't describe the flavors in those sodas other than to say they're sweet and kind of fruity.  They're definitely not like Coke nor root beer.  Despite the name, Ironbeer does not contain any alcohol.  Ironbeer boasts \\"Original 1917 Flavor!\\" on the can.\\n\\nService was good.  It was a two-person operation: the cook and the cashier.  Sandwiches were made-to-order and served up very fast.  Atmosphere was very casual and low key.  The interior doesn't look much different than a stripped-down, reoccupied Quiznos store.\\n\\nI give the Crazy Cuban sandwich and service 4 stars, but the menu and prices 3 stars.  While the Cuban was good, I didn't feel like it was the greatest value.\\n\\nRandom observation:  They have a foosball table here, oddly placed near the beginning of the ordering line."},{"name":"Petsi Pies","address":"285 Beacon St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"A+ Petsi Pies is the most adorable and tasty bakery.

Ordered The New Yorker Specialty Sandwich with French Fries.\\n\\nQuality\\nZaftigs Delicatessen is your classic Jewish deli, with focus on breakfast specials and deli sandwiches. I arrived for a late lunch and decided to go with The New Yorker Specialty Sandwich with a side of French Fries. The sandwich comes with 12oz of hot pastrami and corned beef, Swiss cheese, and Russian dressing on rye bread. I asked for extra dressing and it is definitely necessary. Overall the sandwich was good, but it could have been much better. The amount of meat is excessive and it is partially on me for ordering it. The bread is probably the best part of the whole sandwich, which gets too overwhelmed by the very salty meats. I ended up taking off a good deal and found it much more enjoyable. I also found that while the corned beef was great, the pastrami was just okay. The French Fries that came on the side were average, but still helped provide some contrast to the sandwich. I also liked the pickles, but way too many came out for just one person. Again I take blame for going with this monster sandwich, as a more reasonably proportioned sandwich would likely have been better.\\n\\nQuantity\\nThe New Yorker Specialty Sandwich is ridiculous in size, with too much meat to comfortably eat, and more pickles than I would eat all year. I feel like I would have enjoyed everything more with reasonable proportions.\\n\\nValue\\nI get that it is a massive sandwich, but I would have much preferred a more reasonable sized one at a cheaper price. At nearly $17, this is not a place I would want to visit frequently.\\n\\nAmbiance\\nZaftigs Delicatessen is located in Brookline right in the Coolidge Corner area of Boston. Found at the end unit of a strip of stores, the restaurant is a very large space. When you enter they have a take-out area on the left and the rest of the space is full of tables and booths. The take-out area is primarily for sandwiches and pastries and there is an adjacent bar seating area near it. However, when it is busy this area will also be filled up. The rest of the dining area is very casual with comfortable booths and tables. One thing that you cannot miss is the great artwork you will find all over the wall. Awesome eclectic pieces that capture the spirit and roots of the restaurant. During my visit no music was playing in the background, so it was impossible not to overhear all the nearby conversations.\\n\\nCrowd\\nI remembered how busy this spot got on the weekends from my time in Boston, so I decided to check it out for weekday lunch. It was still very busy with every table taken and a short line for take-out. They were able to quickly clear off a small corner table for me and I was seated within five minutes. If you come on Saturday or Sunday brunch expect at least an hour wait. It is a family friendly spot and one that both locals and visitors flock to.\\n\\nService\\nEven though the restaurant is almost as busy during the week, they don't have the same staff ready. Despite a simple order it took a long time for my sandwich to come out and I had to call over a different waitress when I was ready to go because my girl had disappeared.\\n\\nParking\\nStreet parking in the busy Coolidge Corner area can be tough, but there is a large public lot less than two blocks away.\\n\\nExtra\\nWhile I can see why so many people enjoy Zaftigs Delicatessen, it was just okay for me. I thought the food was decent, but could have been better. The less than perfect service and the near constant wait leave me wary to return."},{"name":"New Ginza","address":"63-65 Galen St","city":"Watertown","stars":"3.5","text":"We found this place because the place we usually go to is closed on mondays and we were thrilled.\\nWe didn't know what to expect and my wife is a very picky eater so I was nervous for recommending this place despite it being close to our house.\\nWe got there and tjhe decore is great, very cute, not too big and very pleasant.\\nThe food was rediculous, sushi so fresh it tasts like the chef went and caught it out back before making it.

He insisted I try it immediately instead of waiting until another visit.  It passed my test!  I really enjoyed it.\\n\\nThe d√©cor is fun and fresh, but it is just a small joint in a strip mall, so it won't blow you away.  The seating isn't very plentiful, but we also visited when a large (~15+) group had a bunch of tables pulled together and that sort of made it rough for anyone else to sit as comfortably as they normally would.

When I finally sat down with a sky-high anticipation of the glorious and copious amount of food that was supposed to come, I quickly realized that my night was definitely not going to go as planned. Why? 2 words: fickle flame. The so-called grill seemed to be nothing more than some lazy ass lighter without enough fuel to sufficiently cook a flimsy piece of meat. Now, try picturing yourself sitting among 9 other ravenous vultures, all of whom are also staring dagger eyes at the same piece of meat on that so-called grill. I get the idea of natural selection, but I'm not about to carry out my caveman-ism at an AYCE in the land of politeness (aka Canada), thank you very much. Since my unintended seating spot was at the head of the table, I was also in the way of the wait staff's foot traffic.

After my first round of sushi, and their BBQ beef short rib I was impressed with how their marinated their meet and the qualify of both the meat and the fish. They were also not traditional in serving you a lot of random side korean dishes. I always found this somewhat wasteful as I would like maybe 2 or 3 of the 8 small dishes, the rest would go to the trash. Here you actually choose which side dishes you like, and how many. The spicy tofu was really tasty and a good side dish to have with the short rib. For $24 CAD (about $18USD)  this place is a steal. Price, quality and service, all 5 star.

The sounds of waiters barking orders, the trolleys of steamed dumplings and riceballs clattering up and down the aisles, and the smells are always overpoweringly delightful. The best way to enjoy this is with a group of people, so you can share as many small plates as possible, and pick off your friends food.\\n\\nThe best items here are the pork shumai, a fettucinie wrapped pork dumpling with veggies and god-knows-what-else. I'm never sure what it is, but it is just so amazingly good I don't even bother asking. There is another, longer, whiter beef dumpling with soy sauce, which is just as good and not as fatty. A simple shrimp dumpling is nice as well, and they come 3 big ones to an order.\\n\\nAs for seafood, the shrimps come heads-on, so you know all the flavor is definately still in that shrimp, ripe for the sucking and the eating. The chicken feet are even really good, filled with that nice chicken flavor right on the bone. \\n\\nThe rice dishes are all pretty good, but the best are the ones wrapped in a banana leaf and stemmed, it comes out sticky and full of flavor. For a party of 11, the total price came out to around $20/head, which may sound pricey, but we must've had 30-40 plates of food, and the pricing syestem is so hard to figure out. It's a card that gets stamped when you pick out what you want, which is a big of a pain because the card is in Chinese, but an order is never more than $3 per item, so its a cheap gamble, especially when the freshness and flavor of the food is top notch."},{"name":"Le Cellier Steakhouse","address":"1510 N Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Finally made it to Le Cellier!

The problem that can and did occur on the chocolate covered Modern cannoli is that when they fill it and are in a rush there is often a section that doesn't get filled in the middle of the cannoli - a big disappointment when you cut it in half!\\n\\nMike's has the disadvantage of having already filled cannoli that, as a result, generally aren't as crisp.  However they are larger, and their thick chocolate coating keeps the shell of the cannoli crisp.  Participants also approved of the extra chocolate chips on the sides.\\n\\nI hope my scientific tendencies bring just a little bit of brightness to the world - enjoy your cannoli!"},{"name":"Mandarin Cove","address":"111 SW Columbia St","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"I've been to this place over 10 times and I still can't get enough of it when I visit Portland.

Out of all three areas, I definitely like the Marketplace the best; it's where the huge majority of the shopping is and, IMO, totally trumps California's Downtown Disney in many ways.\\n\\nOf course the marketplace has my favorite store, Disney's Days of Christmas, but there are so many more. Once Upon A Toy, for example, is an absolutely fabulous store decked out w/ oversized Hasbro toy decorations. Plus, this is the ONLY spot now to pick up a build-your-own Mr. Potato Head w/ a whole mutha truckin' sheet load of exclusive Disney parts and accessories. Ever wanted a Buzz Lightyear, Tinkerbell, or even a Cruella Deville Potato Head? U can get 'em here. (Note: when Engineer Toys was around in the original DCA in California, they used to offer this. Similarly, the Five and Dime in Mickey's Toontown used to as well, but I guess they thought Californians had some deep-rooted hatred towards a dress up potato w/ no pants who originally used to be an avid smoker.)\\n\\nOther notable stores include Team Mickey (sports clothes and accessories) and a Disney design-your-own-t-shirt place (which is pretty neat over slightly pricey in the \\"fracts of life.\\" Florida's World of Disney store is more or less like California's; it appears bigger due to the different layout but has more exciting and salvatory decor. The Lego Store is way more boss, but the small children gather here like some unholy brick builder coven- making hourly sacrifices of their parents money in order to appease the Minifigures.\\n\\nThe sweet shop located in this section of DTD, Goofy's Candy Co., is really neat, but I still think I prefer California's Marceline's. There are also some restaurants located here w/ more in the West Side.\\n\\nOverall, I say that WDW's DTD Marketplace is a wonderful way to lose money...and time...and, if you're surrounded by a gaggle of screaming children for too long, your sanity, but all in a good way."},{"name":"Antonis Restaurant Diner","address":"10765 SW Canyon Rd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"Antonios is a gem that most people would drive by without a second thought.

It's practically a desert but my son can't go there without ordering it for his meal. Then there is the shakes. I have tried probably 6 or 7 and each is unique and delicious in its own right. Be warned, just one can fill you up so quickly you don't even need dinner as well, so I recommend coming here as a snack in between parks, as there is a separate area just for them. We have often gotten a shake and taken it to the hot dog hall of fame in Citywalk for a complete lunch. Finally, the service here is outstanding.

Just my opinion. \\n\\nIn regards to the food, I think that the frito pie has so far been my favorite item. Now mind you, I've only been for happy hour. This most recent trip, we had their green chili queso, which was actually really good. Their chips are a little thicker than most tortilla chips. I also ordered the boudin fritters. They were just ok. It was really my first time to try any sort of boudin balls and I think maybe they're just not my thing. Boyfriend had the One Meat Barbeque Plate with chicken. I thought the chicken was amazing. It was smoky and so flavorful. For drinks we both ordered Palomas. They kept disappearing way to quickly. Against our better judgement, we ended up ordering confetti cake for dessert. Yum.\\n\\nI forgot to mention that our waitress was really great.

We had no problem finding parking at dinner time on a Saturday. We decided to sit outside as I was not fond of trying the metal chairs inside. The outside patio was perfect: high back wood chairs, lots of shade, a nice breeze, and a small stage for music on Fridays. \\n\\nThere were four of us: me (GF & Foodie who cooks a lot a home), husband and a friend who would eat just about anything, and Mr. Picky. Mr. Picky is in his 40's and has just learned to like beans. Yes, he has just learned to tolerate eating beans. This is how picky he is and we had to keep reminding him to go on a \\"taste adventure\\" at Umami Mia. As he ate, it was hilarious to watch his facial expressions (kind of like watching a baby try new foods). He had to keep reminding himself that he wasn't eating \\"pizza\\". He was right. The average American's definition/schema for pizza is more akin to Frank & Angie's or Homeslice. Attempting to compare Umami Mia to Homeslice is comparing apples to oranges. \\n\\nThere is a rather large drink menu (specialty mixed drinks, wine, craft beer). Most ingredients are farm to table and/or made by Umami Mia. There is a regular menu and an entirely separate gluten-free (GF) menu. (Thank you for including the GF menu!) Pizzas are 12 inches (about the size of the GF menu/mat) & we ordered 3 between four people and still took four pieces home. \\n\\nAdult Italian Soda (Cherry) - I had very high expectations for this drink. It was strong (which I love), but a bit watery and I couldn't taste any cherry. I would have liked more carbonation and a bit more cherry flavor. 3/5 stars for this drink.\\n\\nThyme Will Tell - The thyme seemed to be there for the scent because it had a lovely smell when I lifted the glass to my lips. The drink itself was Umami Mia's (very strong) version of a whiskey sour and I LOVED it! It was quite sour. 5/5 stars for this one!\\n\\nFresh Mozzarella - (I was so hungry I forgot to snag a picture of this!) A nice, light, fresh, and savory appetizer. 4/5 stars for this one. \\n\\nHere Piggy - I only took a small bite of this as I'm GF, but the bite that I did take was pretty darn good. This one was the closest to a traditional meat pizza of the three we ordered. We did not think the carrots would go well, but they did. Mixed with the entire pizza, it just added some crunch. We did not taste the carrots separately. We did get the bacon, tomato, and blue cheese flavors. The blue cheese added just a bit of tang to the overall savory flavor. Husband & Mr. Picky don't normally like blue cheese, but they liked this pizza. I think it was that the blue cheese did not overwhelm the rest of the pizza. 4/5 stars for this pizza! \\n\\nMean Green - I only took a small bite of this as I'm GF, but the bite that I did take was amazing. I LOVE citrus and would never have imagined it would work on pizza.  5/5 stars for this pizza! I would really like this flavor included on the GF menu. I was kind of disappointed that I couldn't get the same variety of flavors from the regular menu on the GF menu. Do certain flavors only work on the regular crust or the GF crust? \\n\\nProsciutto & Mission Fig (GF) - Savory (prosciutto), sweet (fig), and crunchy (crust & arugula) all at once on GF crust. Thank you Umami Mia for slicing the figs thinly. (I've had a similar dish at some swanky place in the Dominion and they served it with whole figs. I took one bite and there was juice all over the darn place. It was so annoying.) This pizza was VERY rich and it only took a few pieces for me to feel full. As others have commented, I was VERY impressed with their GF crust. I would even go so far to say that this is the BEST GF crust I have EVER had. (I've had GF crust in my travels across the country, made my own, used Udi's, etc.) Sorry, Smart Flour (available through Austin's Pizza), but you can't compete with the bubbly, crisp homemade crust of Umami Mia! 5/5 stars for this pizza!\\n\\nYes, this place is a bit pricey for the average person/family (four people, three pizzas, several beverages and the tab was $100). However, the interesting specialty drinks, craft beers, and the awesomely unique umami flavors are TOTALLY worth the tab! I honestly don't see the point in even offering the generic flavors (cheese, margherita, etc.) as one can get those anywhere else and even make them at home. I say, if this place is going to specialize in umami flavors - go \\"whole hog\\" and have ONLY umami flavors on the menu. They could offer a small/separate \\"picky eater\\" or kid menu if they want to keep marketing this place to families with children. My friends and I definitely plan to go back to this place.

We recently visited Atlanta for a few days from Florida and Strip Steak and Sushi was highly recommended to us by a family member for great food and ambiance/music.  We went there on a Saturday and LOVED the food!  It was a bit overcrowded, but the food was amazing...So much so we came back the next day for some sushi.  You would think with this, I would be writing a great review right....WRONG!!!  \\n\\nHere's where this place failed us miserably...When we decided to go back for dinner the second night, the place was empty so we figured we would pretty much be in and out.  We sat at the sushi bar and ordered drinks, appetizers, and a regular entre.  Our waitress took forever to come and take our order and when she finally did, she did not show any interest in being at work much less serving customers.  We get our appetizers and we still have no drinks.  We are done with our appetizers and WE STILL HAVE NO DRINKS!!!!  After about 20 minutes, I ask the waitress where are drinks are and her response was \\"It's not me, it's the bar\\" with a slight attitude.  I then look over at the bar and see two bartenders behind there, one of them laughing and joking with the manager and socializing together.  I walk over to the bar and explain to the manager that I have not received my drinks and it has been at least 20 minutes.  He picks up my ticket and says they will bring it over to my table right away.  So basically this \\"manager\\" was distracting his staff while there were tickets that were ringing in that were not tended to?  Ok...it get's better.  The manager then brings us our drinks and says verbatim \\"I gave you guys a heavy pour\\"!  HUH??????  Now this is where me, as the paying customer got upset.  Mind you I am a caterer in the food industry for close to 20 years.  It's one thing to dine somewhere and consume poor quality food...if you don't like the food then you can always go to other restaurants in my opinion.  But the frustrating and unacceptable part when you're dining is POOR SERVICE.  There's no excuse for this.  Management is trained to insure the customer receives a great dining experience and leaves there facility content and happy.  This manager obviously did not care about the people that dined in this restaurant.  \\n\\nThe \\"manager\\" got nasty and rude when I explained to him that I felt it was unprofessional of him to socialize with the staff behind the bar while we were sitting at our table drinking tap water waiting for our drinks for 20 minutes and his best line was \\"I gave you a heavy pour\\"????  Once I spoke my mind he got irritated and upset and asked us TO LEAVE!!!!!!!!!!  I was shocked!  I've never in my 20 years experience in Food and Beverage ever seen such poor management in my whole career! Instead of diffusing our horrible dining experience, he's ego got the best of him and he acted inappropriately and nasty!  When he brought security (YES SECURITY) to remove us from the restaurant, I explained to him I will not leave because after 20 minutes and paying for our drinks, I'm going to drink it!  Long story short...He refused to give me his name...he refused to give me the corporate phone number...and this corporation will never see our money again!  An official complaint was filed with us to corporate and if they want their restaurant to succeed than I hope they get rid of him and hire someone that really appreciates his job especially in this rough economy!\\n\\nIt's sad because their food is quiet good, but the menu is expensive and if you plan on dining here expect crap service!  I agree with one of the reviews here...This place won't last long with managers like him with huge egos running their facility.

The owner was soon nice to me that he offered me some of the dishes to try. Which I did. I'm enamoured by the food and the Customer Service. \\n\\nJerk pork and chicken brought me back to my country. It was tender and just right.  I tried the CONCH soup it's delicious the meat was tender and it had the Jamaican spiciness that gives it a signature. GOAT soup. Never thought it was possible, though I wouldn't have it again it was good and warming a delicatessen in Jamaica. The DUMPLING  balls are a big fried ball of though, which are heaven specially while they are still hot.  The OXTAIL was nice and off the bone tender. Very good flavor, I'm saving the best for last the CURRY CRAB... this is something I want to eat at home while watching a movie.... these are whole pieces of crabs legs and all.

About a half an hour went by and more tables were sat. An hour rolled by and we watched every other table around us get their food including people who were sat after us. An hour and 30 minutes goes by and I finally ask the waitress what's going on. About 10 minutes after that we ask for our food to go and it comes our shortly after.

I said to hold the mozzarella.  It was supposed to also come with basil but I didn't taste any. The balsamic dressing was too thick - I know they are trying to be fancy but it was just too much. For a salad you need it to be a little loose otherwise you can't spread the dressing around and some pieces of spinach are doused while others are bare.  I also got a side of brussel sprouts. You aren't supposed to get those as a separate side (they typically only come with the chicken dish) but a lady next to me asked for it so I asked too. And after serving her they couldn't tell me no!  They were delicious - a little charred with some olive oil and perfectly cooked.  \\n\\nMy friend got the mussels and said they were ok.  I used the bread that came with it to try out the coconut broth - it was ok. Definitely could have been a better flavor - more curry sauce or something.  My friend said since mussels can be fishy sometimes you want a strong broth or sauce to go with it and this was too light.  I agreed with my bread dipping trial.\\n\\nThe bartender (cute short hair blond lady) was really friendly and helpful.  She was also very attentive.

At 7:30pm the whole place was almost full.  For warm nights they have 2 tables outside.   It's just pricey for  a pub.  My salad was $9, my friend's mussels were $11, and the brussel sprouts were $6.  Plus the wine was $7 (which was a decent price).\\n\\nI wish they would add more vegetarian and vegan options.  They did have some vegetarian risotto dish on the menu but I didn't ask if it could be vegan. Usually risotto cannot be.  So please add a vegan dish so I don't just have to eat salads and side dishes\\n\\nI will certainly be back - I imagine this might become a popular joint for me.\\n\\nAlso props to them for hanging the fire fighter helmet on the wall as a tribute to the firefighters that died in this location there 3 years ago during that terrible fire."},{"name":"Spoke Wine Bar","address":"89 Holland St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Everything that I wanted on a cold summer evening.

When we arrived we were told that it would be a 60 to 90 minute waiting time for us to get into a Bay. That was fine because it was a weekend evening. We sat down at a table in the restaurant portion and figured we would eat first - it took 30 minutes to receive our first drink which was weak and overpriced, and 75 minutes before we received an appetizer. Main courses came 15 minutes after that. We end up waiting 3 hrs before getting our bay - twice as long as we were told.  Management and staff was generally friendly and nice as they were clearly embarrassed and under trained for high-volume. Service while we were golfing was much better but inside was a total nightmare. It is clear that they need more bartenders and more kitchen staff.  Too many customer service and greeters standing around with nothing to do while the kitchen and bar was understaffed and completely unorganized and under-prepared."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I've only had the canolis and the boston cream pie here which were both incredible!

I'd prefer less of them and add some slaw.  Which I know they have because the Fish and Chips is the other meal and it came with some innovative cole slaw.  The Fish and Chips were good and worthy of mention but with many other entrees calling my name - and the burger, having me call its name, probably will be taken out of the starting rotation.  The bar is not too large (about 10 stools) but so far been able to get seats.  Service is friendly and quick.  The crowd has always been friendly and talkative.

Awful.  Terrible.\\n\\nThe service was terrible.  We ordered a couple beers and a couple menus as we were hungry and in the mood for bbq.  We  received a menu and the check.\\n\\nOkay, no big deal.  After that minor snafu, we sent the check back and ordered the meat sampler with pork ribs, brisket and meatloaf as well as a pulled pork sandwich.  For sides, we had the mac and cheese, mashed potatoes and red beans and rice.  \\n\\nEvery single item was bad in it's own way.\\n\\nPork ribs - well, they served us beef ribs, which is a pretty big mistake in and of itself...but even judging the beef ribs on their own, they were poor.  Underdone, not even close to tender.  I'd guess they needed 3 more hours on the smoker.  And that's not a good sign when you can make decent ribs in 3-4 hours if you do it right.  The taste of the dry rub might have been good, but it's tough to tell when you're chewing on ribs with the texture of shoe leather and taste to match.\\n\\nThe meatloaf was okay, aside from the fact that it was slathered with some sort of salt based gravy straight from a jar.  Not a ton of smoke flavor, but the meat itself was tasty enough I guess.  Not great, not horrific....but the gravy was almost indescribably salty as can be and just tasted...processed.  Bad.\\n\\nBrisket was flat out awful.  The worse I've ever eaten.  Corpse gray in color, probably 6 hours from being done.  Zero smoke ring, zero smoke flavor, zero dry rub...there was absolutely nothing going on with this item.  Tougher than Chuck Norris.  This was a really terrible piece of meat.  Honestly...worst brisket I've ever eaten in my life.  \\n\\nThe pulled pork was wet...as if they'd poured luke-warm water over the sandwich after it was finished.  Again, no smoke flavor and no dry rub involved.  Covered in marginal cole slaw.  The bun was okay.\\n\\nSides were bad too.  Cole slaw out of a jar, tasteless and soggy.  The red beans and rice had some taste at least.  A bit of spice and a ton of cumin, but that was nearly the only thing with any taste.  The mashed potatoes were poor with the aforementioned salt gravy covering the potatoes.  Red beans and rice were possibly the best thing we ordered.  Heavy dose of cumin, but at least they tasted like something.  Mac and cheese was decent.  Pretty uneventful, but it was okay.  Oh, the cornbread was pretty strong.  Honestly, if everything measured up to the cornbread, I wouldn't be writing this review.\\n\\nI could go on, but I won't.  I'm going to take a shower and brush my teeth.  \\n\\nTerrible.  Seriously.

I like to compare it to its Mass Ave. neighbor, Christopher's (they have eerily similar menus):  Cambridge Common is less expensive, is a better space with better service, and has more TVs.  The only demerit is for not having Buffalo Tofu (Christopher's has it) and having a less than stellar house made vegetarian burger (the black bean burger leaves something to be desired).  Otherwise, this place is a great reliable option for the Porter/Harvard area.  It is also a great place to bring visitors with differing palates, there is something for everyone."},{"name":"Red Cap Garage","address":"1035 SW Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Oh Red Cap, how I love thee. No, seriously, if it was legal to marry my bar I would walk down your drunken aisle. \\n\\nI'm straight, but all are accepted at Red Cap (unless you're a feminine wash product, then stay away). I started going there just to visit a friend, but had such a great time I couldn't stay away. \\n\\nThe boys are sweethearts, the drinks are amazing, the prices are good. You've got Boxxes next door for extra fun, Fish Grotto to get tasty dinner, and a lovely outdoor patio to enjoy the upcoming summer. What more could you ask for? Oh yeah, yummy bar food, great music, and incredibly nice staff! \\n\\nEvents occur on various nights, Portland Idol (like American Idol) on Thursday, a show of some sort Friday (haven't been there for it yet), and it seems like some great party on Saturdays. Last week was Tag-a-Fag (highlighter & black light party) and this week is Mendy's Big Gay Prom, if that gives you any idea of how much fun is had on Saturdays. Tuesday night also has an amazing after-10 drink deal, but I'm not giving away all the secrets, you'll have to go find out about it for yourself. \\n\\nOverall, it's hard NOT to have a great time here. The boys are the best around, and Davy make a mean Gummy Bear! Actually any drink he makes is delicious, so be careful not to overdo it.

It's not quite sure if it'd rather be a Deli, a Diner, or a Semi-Casual, moderately priced Restaurant. The menu ranges from Deli sandwiches and Jewish staples (Matzoh, Latkes, etc.) to some American comfort foods. But within it's eclectic walls, and through it's eclectic menu, there is plenty of good to find. \\n\\nThe place is popular. This much is obvious, for if you've ever went to Zaftig's at a given meal bracket, there's usually a line. The maximum time I've ever waited for a table here was only about 20 minutes though, so they can artfully move people through. Is it worth the wait? Depends on the duration. Zaftig's is awesome, no doubt - I've enjoyed every meal I have there, but if the wait were an hour I'd find someplace else. As stated, however, the waits have never been overwhelming in my experience. \\n\\nThe food is solid. The Latkes are awesome, but are thick - so if you're in the mood for a thinner, crispier potato pancake you may find these a bit daunting. They're crispy, though, and heavy and hearty on the inside. They are pretty expensive, but they taste good and are quite filling. The homestyle foods, such as the meatloaf, mac and cheese, and pot pie - are all very substantial, tasty, and simple in a good way. \\n\\nZaftig's, because of it's popularity, seems to receive pretty polarized reviews here on Yelp. Is it necessarily a must-stop place? Not in my opinion. But is it solid enough to warrant it's popularity? I'd say so. If you're looking for a 100% authentic New York style Jewish Deli, you're better going to places that specifically cater to that. Somewhere in Zaftig's 'jack of all trades' aspirations, that feeling and focus was brushed to the side a bit. But the qualities that they've gained from that stance are strong in their own right, and offer what amounts to a good (to very good) dining experience."},{"name":"Grand Floridian Cafe","address":"4401 Floridian Way","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"A hidden gem in WDW??  Could it be??\\n\\nI didn't have any intention of going to GFC at all during our last visit.  I'd planned to make a reservation for a restaurant in Epcot, but then I remembered that I wanted to see the gingerbread house in the Grand Floridian hotel, and if I dragged my mom all the way out there from the Yacht Club, she'd kill me.  So I made dinner reservations so I'd have the excuse to go there.\\n\\nOur waiter was cordial, but not friendly - I can't remember his name, but he was from Austria.  Not the Disney service I'm accustomed to, unfortunately.  My mom and I both had the French Onion soup (delicious), and my husband and my aunt had the Caesar salad (nothing special, they noted).\\n\\nFor entrees, everyone ordered the Surf & Turf Burger except for myself, as I'm allergic to lobster.  I decided on the Shrimp & Grits.  Good, but overly salty, which was ironic because the burger was underseasoned, according to my husband.  My mom enjoyed the burger though; it may have been because my husband didn't want the grilled onions on the burger, so it lacked that extra flavor.\\n\\nWe all split the dessert sampler, which was really good except for the fruit tart - the pie dough base was too sweet and too hard.  It would've been so much better had they used puff pastry.\\n\\nA very typical hotel restaurant ambiance, but with surprisingly decent food and decent prices.  Choose the GFC if you want a quieter dinner that isn't all hustle and bustle trying to shuttle people in and out as quickly as they can.  Bonus: if you're sitting towards the back of the restaurant, you can catch the Magic Kingdom fireworks!"},{"name":"Crawfish Shack & Oyster Bar","address":"2013 Wells Branch Pkwy, Ste 106","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm from Louisiana and basically don't trust anyone to boil my crawfish, so we ordered a sack of 31 pounds (live) on Tuesday and picked them up on Saturday from the Crawfish Shack. The crawfish were ready to go when we got there and were 75 cents cheaper per pound than they were at Quality Seafood. Quite a savings. \\nWe asked for a boiled crawfish to try while we waited to pay and it was quite a strange boiled crawfish. Regularly $6.95 a pound here (unheard of in southern Louisiana!), it was boiled then covered in a thick butter and onion sauce over the shell. Yes, a sauce. Over the shell. Perhaps some people like that, but no real Louisianians that I know would expect that in a boiled crawfish. Just a boatload of Zatarain's seasoning, onions, lemons, lemon, celery and salt.

It was cheaper than other places and ready to go when I arrived."},{"name":"The Living Room","address":"101 Atlantic Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I came here on a Saturday night for my birthday and was very happy with the decision.

This time we sat at the bar and were able to experience the more lounge-y room. We sipped our tasty martinis and listened to the DJ, it wasnt the best music selection, but still a great time.\\n\\nI think the reason why I like this bar so much is because it's actually a classy place, as compared to some other places in Boston that try so hard to be upscale yet fall short.

Though the name of the restaurant is in Yiddish and the menu features Jewish delicatessen staples, I see no reason for this phenomenal brunch place to meet the expectations of those wanting Zaftig's to purvey purely authentic Jewish food, or to keep kosher. Come to Zaftig's primarily for the Jewish-themed food, absolutely--must-tries include the potato pancakes with smoked salmon, the matzo ball soup, the sweet blintzes, and the ridiculously huge and tasty corned beef sandwich on rye--but try as well their less-\\"faithful\\" foods like the banana stuffed french toast, and if you get it with bacon, no one's going to kick you out of the restaurant.

Shake Shack is great, and quite comparable, Smashburger is also great, Jake's is ok, Red Robin isn't really my favorite (but fine in a pinch), and Five Guys (a bit above average). BurgerFi has the signature of placing a \\"stamp\\" into their burgers, a cool accent. The restaurant interior on March 18, 2016 was much different than a previous reviewer posted, it was clean, and not anywhere near dirty.

The entire interior was very modernized and the staff were all very happy and friendly. They have burgers (obviously), hot dogs, custard, and more. Nothing takes too long and everything is delicious and tasteful. Perfect for a quick food stop in the area. Less than 5 minutes from VFW Parkway, Dedham, Newton, and very close to other large areas.

The last 6 months this particular location has gone down hill with the quality of the food and service. I understand that errors happen especially with pick up orders. The first incident was the wrong order completely. My daughter ordered enchiladas and when we got home and opened our boxes she received nachos. Now that generally wouldn't be an issue for most people but they were fully loaded and she is allergic to half the items on top. My daughter called and spoke to the manager Ryan. He offered a credit of $5.00. A little while after they hung up she received a call back from Ryan. He said that he pulled the receipt and that we made the error and that the nachos were a better deal.  \\n\\nWe called in our order tonight since we were running errands in the area. My daughter ordered bean and cheese nachos, queso (the Phillip's Special) chips and salsa.  We got home and her nachos are fully loaded - even after she asked for everything on the side; she did not get chips and salsa. They served the queso in a tall cup which made it difficult to eat without pouring it out. If you're getting the special, ask for it deconstructed or regular queso. \\n\\nI called and spoke to Ryan and advised of the issues. He offered a credit, essentially, which would be fine if I could trust our food will be correct. \\n\\nWe have overlooked wrong order on dine in, and previous to-go orders, and always went back to give them another chance. To be honest, if I were to check CC receipts, we go to the Burnet location at least 3/4 times a month between Grub Hub and pick up orders, which why this last trip has been so disappointing. \\n\\nI will say, the servers are ALWAYS courteous and Becky (the bartender!) is always super nice. When our food is correct, it's always GOOD, I just wish that management would correct the errors and not make me want to take my business elsewhere."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This place is a little overrated.

The menu basically consists of sandwiches, salads and wraps, with a pasta dish and salmon dish thrown in for good measure. Prices ranged from about $15-$25. I had the turkey and havarti sandwich and really loved it. It came with either a side of fries or cucumber salad, which was a nice option. The salad was okay but I could have gone without it and been very pleased (and full) with just the sandwich. The sandwich consisted of roasted turkey breast, Danish havarti, tomato, avocado, watercress and roasted pumpkin seed-arugula pesto mayonnaise on sunflower bread. I feel like the sandwich was very thoughtfully crafted to create the perfect combination of flavors and textures. I loved the creaminess of the avocado and the pesto mayonnaise was so delicious. My friend's chicken wrap also looked good. It came with a red pepper hummus that she said was very tasty.

Our waiter was quick and attentive, brought our drinks and took our orders fairly rapidly. We split some of the beignets, which came with orange marmalade something or other. They were fresh, light and powdered with sugar. The orange marmalade sauce, which I thought would have added a lot to the beignet, didn't actually add that much.\\n\\nI got the mardi gras as my main entree, but they forgot to give me the english muffin that was supposed to come with it. They give you a lot of homefries too, and those were very good. Not greasy, not too salty and nice and crisp. The omelet itself was very imbalanced. The sweetness from the crawfish was at times overpowering and the andouille sausage, which I expected to be the strongest flavored ingredient, didn't taste like anything. I also realized they didn't add milk to the eggs for the omelet to soften it or any type of pancake batter to fluff it. Well, the problem with that is then you can a relatively crispy edge, tougher omelet. Sure, dairy deflates it a bit, but rather not be needing a knife just to cut my omelet instead of my fork.\\n\\nOn top of it all, I paid probably close to 1.5 times what I'd pay at Ihop for an omelet.

How many places can you say you can hear great music, enjoy great drinks and have a bite to eat inexpensively? \\n\\nWe have been numerous times, most recently to watch Randy Rogers, Jason Eady, Carter's Chord, and Eli Young Band perform.

They also added port-o-nasty-potties to help with the limited bathrooms. \\n\\nThe Pro's: \\n1) Cheap live music; great bands. \\n2) Several outside bars (accepting cash/debit/credit). \\n3) Fairly inexpensive drinks. \\n4) Decent food. \\n5) Play-area for the rugrats. \\n6) Free parking (in the field). \\n7) Police. \\n8) KVET- FREE MUSIC SHOWS \\n\\nThe Con's: \\n1) Parking: $10 to park semi-close to the entrance; or park in a vastly large field with one way in and out for free. \\n2) Over-crowded venue: the place always sells out and is JAM packed; they could stand to open it up more. \\n3) The new VIP table-areas leave very little walk room. \\n4) Standing-only; good luck trying to take your own chairs. \\n5) 'Occasional' less-than friendly staff and promoters; constantly id'n even if you've stuck with the same bartender the entire night and are wearing a wrist-band.

We are major foodies and eat sushi about once a week back home in Boston.   The interior was small but nicely decorated.  The bar itself was made of ice and the hundreds of vodka choices was impressive.  They have about fifteen infused vodkas that they create in house..we had the coconut and the brown sugar pineapple and they were both awesome. The bartender was super friendly and knowledgable and took the time to explain the different vodka options to us.  We ended up sitting outside because it was pretty air conditioned inside and it was a beautiful night.  The chef greeted us and sat us.  The waitress was pleasant and offered some suggestions of rolls to try out.  We ended up getting three amazing rolls..the mango, the BBQ eel and one with spicy tuna asparagus and ponzu sauce ( can't remember the name).  All three were beautifully prepared and were all so unique and different from any sushi we have eaten.  The chef is a true creative master.  He came out to check how everything was and later gave us a crab rangoon dessert( sounds nasty but it was amazing) on the house.  The sushi is not cheap but three rolls will leave you more than satisfied and it is absolutely worth the money.   I would highly recommend this for someone looking for a unique dining experience and isn't just looking for an ice bar to get smashed at.  We were told that at night it turns more into a club ( we were there around seven for dinner) so maybe there is a different crowd there then...but we were thoroughly impressed and left with our Tummys and curiosity satisfied :)"},{"name":"Perfect Pizza","address":"8145 SW Nyberg St","city":"Tualatin","stars":"3.5","text":"We tried perfect pizza for the first time and were very please.

I tried dipping the fries in some of the sauces that came with the dish, which was fun.\\n\\nSalad - Skip it.  Just a garden salad with italian dressing, and it didn't seem very ethnic at all.\\n\\nPlantain - Very good.  Served with a dipping sauce that is sweet.  I'd suggest sharing an order of this for dessert.\\n\\nChicken combination - I think that this is what they are known for.  It was OK, and the chicken had several sauces to dip in.

When I went back this time on my second jaunt to the North End, this time after having lived in Boston for a year, I was one crucial fact wiser: I knew not to order the cannoli. Of course, I was taking my friend from Chicago, so I insisted that she order it instead. Just to live out the North End dream. \\n\\nOne thing I realize about Modern Pastry that it is a place with wonderful atmosphere. In a North End packed with lines (ahem, Mike's pastry anyone?), it's the only place where you can actually sit and order and people aren't standing around waiting to take your place. When it's 8PM on a Saturday night and you need a sweet fix with a few friends, Modern Pastry is the perfect place. Of course, my old criticisms still stand: the dessert is definitely not French pastry-chef level material. But then again, a year of living in college and outside of my mother's kitchen has dramatically lowered my standards, so I do concede: the desserts are pretty damn good. \\n\\nMy friends and I ordered the Napoleon, the Creme Brulee, a Lobster Tail, a Cannolli and a Dark Chocolate Turtle. Then, we realized that this wasn't Thailand and when the desserts came out in their huge portions, we were a little taken aback (but not defeated). It was the lobster tail that was the shocker: a gigantic, head-sized flaky piece of pastry chock-full of ricotta cream, it was an amazing, beautiful thing to see and an even more beautiful thing to eat. \\n\\nThe night was filled with laughter: my friend from Chicago finally experienced the same cannoli disillusionment that we all go through on our first visit to Boston, and my dark chocolate turtle was so chocolatey and caramel-y that I nearly couldn't finish it, but it was so good that of course I did. The lobster tail was tackled by 5 people and it was still a challenge, but it was the most delicious challenge I've encountered in a while. The creme brulee was too sweet and the napoleon was delicious but not spectacular. I realize that coming from a place where I had the kind of desserts my mother made, it's impossible not to be disappointed. But I've shifted expectations, and I now eat food for the experience and not solely for the taste: and that's what makes Modern Pastry worth going back to - the experience of the huge lobster tail, the friendly service, the seating atmosphere.

I got a half order of the salmon hash with a side of apple sausage (but they never brought it out) and the bf got the Bennys Chicken. We also ordered the crispy french toast and the breakfast nachos. We got half orders on everything that was possible. \\n\\nThe salmon hash was good! I loved the salmon flavoring in the potatoes. It also came with a toast and an egg. The the Bennys chicken was also very good! The chicken was marinated well and it was nice and crispy. The french toast was alright...it didn't have much flavor. The texture was very grainy (I didnt like that but my bf did). I think it needed some sort of fruit compote instead of just plain syrup. The nachos were the worst. It was very salty and it was smothered in dried cheese and grilled onions. \\n\\nOur total bill came out to be around $49 for 2 people. Some of the foods were good and some were not. Half orders were the perfect size so we were able to try more dishes. The service was alright...everyone was bustling around and we sat right next to their water station/cashier so it was a bit noisy. Definitely didnt like the cramped tables."},{"name":"Burgoo Bistro","address":"1100 Burrard Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"This place was amazing.

We had a group of 7 and we got our table within five minutes. Perhaps we were lucky and it was just good timing. Our server was James, who has been with the restaurant for 8 years! So he literally gave us the scoop on what's good/great and what is so-so.  We had Irish Nachos and Fried Raviolis as appetizers. They were a hit. The food here is wonderful: portion is size is NOT mondo big--just perfect. I don't like eating at brunch places and feeling like I am in a food coma afterwards.   A majority of the ingredients/food is local and is very fresh.  The setting is a mix of old/new/funky with chandeliers everywhere and lots of windows for natural light to come int. The service was fun, entertaining and impeccable.

When we saw the BBQ in the name of the restaurant, our tired eyes lite up like the cylon in the battlestar galactica. \\n\\nThis is a neat little place with outdoor seating. We elected to eat outside next to the fire pit. I started with some kind of blond beer. For awhile I could not understand why I ordered a blond......I don't do blonds. I like my beer dark and sweet. I finally realized it's because of the cute little blondie hostess with the cute little dress. For some reason, I had subconsciously associated the hostess with the beer? Could that be possible? \\n\\nAnyway, this was some fancy BBQ that tasted pretty good. It wasn't spetacular or exceptional. The fries were the best. I fully enjoyed the fries. The BBQ Pork Ribs were also better than the briskets. Briskets were a bit dry. I don't think this is the BBQ I have in mind when I think about Texas.\\n\\nIt was a good meal overall."},{"name":"Kona Grill","address":"11410 Century Oaks Ter","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Just because this is a chain restaurant in Austin's swankiest mall doesn't mean there aren't ways for normal people to make it their own.  You *could* come and eat a regular meal here.  It would probably be a pretty good meal, but it also probably would not be anything you wrote home about.  You would eat Asian fusion in upscale-but-not-stuffy surroundings, and you would drop anywhere from $15-$30 per entree, BEFORE drinks, appetizers, dessert, tax, or tip.\\n\\nOr, you could come for the happy hour.\\n\\nHappy hour at the Kona Grill runs from 3-7 pm M-F AND they have \\"reverse happy hour\\" from 9-11 pm M-Thurs (also 10 pm - 12 am on Fri-Sat).  During happy hour, they have a selection of drinks for dirt cheap, and a pretty wide selection of appetizers, pizzas, and sushi rolls for 1/2 price.  \\n\\nFrom the happy hour menu, I've tried the calamari, the spicy tuna roll, and the garlic shrimp pizza.  The calamari was good, especially the sauce that came with it.  I also liked the tuna roll - it's not Musashino, of course, but it's pretty tasty and fresh and, well, it's half price.  The pizza was quite garlic-icious, which I appreciated, although I wished the crust had been cooked a little more, as it was a little bready for my taste.  Not the best pizza I've ever had (far from it, actually), but again - half price goes a long way towards convincing me to like something.  For five bucks, it was a pretty substantial proposition.  Add a drink or two in the mix, and you've got yourself a pretty satisfying meal for not too much cash.\\n\\nYou have to sit in the bar to get happy hour prices.  It is LOUD.  It is crowded.  There is a bit of a scene.  The service isn't overly friendly, but it's reasonably attentive.  \\n\\nBut - they have some nice outdoor seating and pretty solid food and drinks at great prices.  Browse the shops either before or after you eat, and you've got yourself a nice, upscale evening for a person with a normal-sized budget."},{"name":"Damons Restaurant","address":"3 Cambridge Ctr","city":"Cambridge","stars":"2.5","text":"I love having Damon's nearby.

There is also a large fridge with drinks and plenty of sweets and chips on the counter. Only gripe is that the hot food can be salty and a salad, hot food and drink can get expensive. \\n\\nDon't forget breakfast- eggs, toast, bacon, sausage, cereal."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"A remarkable bakery in a remarkable neighborhood.

The food is so flavorful, I haven't ever tasted any Thai food that comes even close to the level of delicious this establishment offers! The family who runs the restaurant is so friendly, welcoming, and warm. The atmosphere is casual but very clean with an upscale feel. We usually order take out but have eaten in a few times. We took some friends here once from out of town and they said they can't eat at their local Thai restaurant anymore because it's too bland comparatively. Considering how delicious the food is I don't believe their prices are unreasonable at all. Depending on your meat choice the dishes run between $12-$18 which is about the same you would be paying at a chain restaurant where everything is pretty much frozen and cooked in a microwave (if you've ever worked at a chain restaurant you know what I'm talking about!)"},{"name":"Topgolf","address":"9295 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I have mixed emotions about my experience at Topgolf.

After the 40 minutes was up, she went back up to the counter and the lady advised \\"I cant give a time\\". We decided to sit in the bar area and wait. No one came to help us. We had to chase down a \\"waiter\\" to come serve us. Our bay was ready before our 1 appetizer was ready, so they transferred the order to our bay. We walked over to our bay which still had people there and one of the helpers said \\"were gonna have to transfer you to somewhere else\\" At this point I was ready to go home. About 3 minutes later the group of people standing around left and we got our bay and didn't have to transfer. The service was better once we were playing and our pretzel platter was amazing.

So I figured why not, I've never had a cannoli before. \\n\\nWhen my boyfriend and I arrived, it was absolute chaos. I'm usually not picky about things like this, but there was NO line, people were literally shoving to get in and out of the store, and the workers made no attempt to stop people who were cutting in line. This is in addition to the fact that there are limited seating areas for people who have purchased their pastries and are eating it within the cramped store. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and figured if this many people were scrambling to eat these, they must be pretty darn good. \\n\\nAdmittedly, I had a hard time deciding what to get because of their huge variety of cannolis and pastries. When we finally made it to the front, my boyfriend and I ordered the chocolate ricotta and the Oreo cannolis. The worker taking my order was slightly rude and seemed in a rush to get me out of the store ASAP, though understandably so as the place was packed. \\n\\nWhen we opened our box of cannolis, they definitely looked like they were worth their value. I may have never tried a cannoli before, but I've seen them, and these were at least double the size, and stuffed to the brim with filling. With regards to the taste themselves, I tried both my chocolate ricotta and Oreo cannolis, and I personally don't care too much for either of them. They were definitely crispy and rich, but I found them both to be more of pure sweetness than flavored. \\n\\nAs such, I'd have to say that from personal preference I didn't really like the cannolis that I tried. That being said, I may come back to try a different flavor or a different pastry, but definitely during a less busy hour."},{"name":"Nutty Brown Cafe","address":"12225 Hwy 290 W","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Have been patronizing the Nut  since they opened up over six years years ago.
