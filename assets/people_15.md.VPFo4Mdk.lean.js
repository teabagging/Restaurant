Its been awhile since I was impressed by the food and service the rest was bonus.  \\n\\nI'm a big fan of Cafe Medina, its my go to place for brunch, but have never tried Chambar until now, and sad to say I've been missing out.  While reading reviews and recommended by friends I knew it was time to try Chambar.  I was really scared to come to a place like this with a big party.  I reserved a table for 11 for my birthday, reso was for 5:30 on a holiday Monday with a limit of 2.5 hours.  \\n\\nThe drinks menu:  I heard this place had a great selection of imported beers and tasty cocktails.  I'm not a beer drinker but the selection looked impressive and the guys and gals in my table loved it.  Me on the other hand tried the Pineapple Express and a glass of Wynn's Cab Sauvignon.  \\nI'm a sucker for anything with pineapple it was delish and wine went well with dinner.  \\n\\nThe food: In numerous occasion I've heard nothing but good things about the food and I had to try the \\"moules and frites\\" \\nI stared with a green salad, nice light dressing really enjoyed it.  For main I ordered the highly recommended moules and frites congolaise- mussels with tomato coconut cream sauce, it was a generous portion and yes it was yummmmy!  The sauce was very rich, chunks of tomatoes or onions (it was a little dark to see what I was actually eating but it didn't matter) and lots of mussels.   And it came with really good pomme frites with a dipping sauce.  My husband ordered the Tajine d'aziz a l'agneau which I tried and wow it was amazing, at first we thought it would taste \\"different\\"  with honey, figs, cinnamon and cilantro but that flavors just worked well together.  And the more you eat it the better it tasted, I felt like I was in Morocco.  The rest of the table was speechless (always a good sign when it comes to food).  \\n\\nAmazing Service!  Where do I begin, 1st taking a large party, surprisingly a lot of smaller establishments in downtown don't take larger parties over 6.  They allowed us to bring a birthday cake (brownie points),  one of the couple in our party came really late and yet they received there food at the same time as the rest of the table, every 5-10 minutes someone came by just to check up on us without being annoying, water lots of water I love places that refill water like its goin out of style.  Our main server was super nice, only thing is we didn't know her name.  2.5 hours go by fast when having fun and eating great food, but we never felt rushed at all. \\n\\nThe ambiance is nice comfortable yet modern and edgy, the feel of a high end restaurant without feeling too stuffy ie no white table cloths here.  When you walk in, you are greeted by a large bar and a view of the rest of the restaurant.   The expose brick gives it that downtown feel and the lighting yes a little dark makes it feel intimate.  Our table was in the middle of the room which I really liked but still felt like we had a private function.  \\n\\nI would defiantly come back even just for drinks but I'm a fan of the food.

It's air conditioned so it's not that bad.  What makes this place a nightmare is it's one of the few places that you can just walk into without a reservation, sit in A/C and just generally not be sitting outside in the hot sun.  What this means at Disney is that everyone and their mother is going here during the middle of the day.  They are holding seats like they are a party of 28 when there's only two of them and they will shank you for them too.  The food is stadium food.  So you know it's super high priced but it taste like it was prepared with taste not in mind.\\n\\nWhat's the plus side of this place you ask?  It has A/C and it looks like you are sitting in Pinocchio's Haus.  That's about it.  I ate a few lunches here and avoided being shanked by mom's holding sections of the seating area for the colony of people they brought to Disney with them.  It's like the bus scene in Forrest Gump where no one want's to let him sit down.  I tried the italian hoagie, the chicken fingers and the salads.  Everything is plain and boring in taste.  They give you plenty of free sauces at the dressing tables and I was loading everything with dressing, mustard and ketchup to get taste.  While paying about $35-$40 everytime for 3 people.

For $15, you can get 5 small plates and a cocktail.  Each plate is $3 during happy hour, so this is basically discounted food + a free drink.  Items on the regular menu include cooked fish, sushi rolls, sashimi, nigiri, and udon noodles.  Parking is either valet in a lot off of Cheshire Bridge Road or self-park in a lot off of Piedmont Road.  The ambiance is nice but extremely upscale.  There are well-maintained private rooms in the back of the restaurant, where you can dine on the floor with a large group.\\n\\nHighlights: Food was excellent overall.  My five small plates were the fried calamari, the beef kushiyaki (skewers), the salad with salmon skin, a spicy yellowtail roll, and a spicy tuna roll. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the calamari came in large pieces and was lightly breaded.  Served with fried vegetables, the calamari was tender - not seasoned a lot, but it came with a dipping sauce.  The beef kushiyaki was also tender and came with a sweet sauce.  Two skewers per order are served in the happy hour plate.  Both of the rolls I had were delicious.  If you're hungry, a few rolls are probably the best deal.  There's also a seafood roll and a bunch of vegetable rolls you can choose from.  The salad was a great complement to the other 4 dishes - the salmon skin was served in crispy strips and came with a tasty ginger dressing.  Service was great.\\n\\nCritiques: I had a very positive experience at happy hour - no complaints from me for this restaurant.\\n\\nOverall: If you're looking for a happy hour that doesn't involve hot wings, tacos, and pitchers of cheap beer, this may be the place for you.

Maybe the spot is cursed or something because the concept is good, but there is nothing behind it.\\n\\nWe almost didn't stay to even order because we were sitting there for what seemed forever before we got any service.  Sorry that doesn't cut it especially when the restaurant is next to dead.  The waiter (if you want to call him that) must have had radar on me because I was about to stand up and go just when he came over so I sucked it up and decided to stay.  I had the hamburger which was served with chips for $8.00.  I don't mind paying $8 or more for a hamburger that is large and tasty and served with a real side dish wherein I will be full for more than three seconds.  This burger unfortunately was tasteless and reminded me of the hamburgers that your drunk friends throw on a grill at 4am but you are so wasted and empty you don't care that you are eating what resembles a hockey puck.

We stopped here because the menu looked promising, but everything that came to the table was a mess. The kitchen was either out of a lot of ingredients or was just sloppy in their use; salads that were supposed to have almonds showed up with peanuts, a pizza that was supposed to have artichoke hearts and prosciutto had one or two tiny bits of each (I noted none but the other person sharing the pizza said he detected them in one bite). Pastas were undercooked--not al dente, just plain crunchy--which is more remarkable considering that the two pasta dishes arrived at the table a good ten minutes after the two pizzas, with no explanation from the waiter. Pastas were also unredeemably bland, so much so that we didn't finish either. And somehow, in spite of the brick oven that Mast is so proud of, the pizza crusts were soggy and unappetizing. It was possibly the worst Italian food I've had in Boston.\\n\\nAs for the non-food experience, the ladies' room was a mess, with no paper towels, multiple toilet paper rolls on the floor, and one plugged toilet (this on a night when the restaurant was only half full); when I mentioned to the hostess that the ladies' room needed attention, she gave me an apologetic look, but I didn't notice her tell anyone else or take any action for the duration of our visit. And back at the table, a blob of tomato sauce that should have been wiped up when the dishes were cleared remained on the table, even when the waiter had to actively avoid it when putting down a glass. \\n\\nI am being very generous in giving Mast two stars, and that is based mostly on the bread served before the meal (must be baked somewhere else), and the fact that the waiter was very good about refilling our water.

I would recommend it to people who maybe aren't huge fans of Indian food but want to try it.  Also, their menu specifies whether or not dishes are vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free, which is nice.  The service was great, the staff was very attentive and nice, and the prices were fair.  Our waiter even brought us free dessert because he mistakenly didn't bring us the 2nd appetizer we'd ordered.  That was cool.\\n\\nLike I said, it doesn't suck.  The food is just not awesome.  I'm not saying I know what \\"real,\\" \\"authentic\\" Indian food is or anything, but I have eaten at my fair share of Indian places and expected to taste some similar richness and flavor at this one...I was pretty disappointed in that way.\\n\\nSaag Paneer is one of my favorite Indian dishes usually, so I ordered that and my boyfriend ordered my other favorite Indian dish, Chicken Korma.  Both of these dishes are typically rich, not just in heaviness and cream, but also in flavor.  At New India, there was hardly any flavor in either one.  The Korma tasted like a bowl full of heavy whipping cream with some chilis thrown in just to make it spicy.  Pretty much the same thing with the Saag.  It was very heavy and full of what seemed like fresh spinach, but severely lacked flavor.  \\n\\nOn the plus side, both dishes were very spicy hot, which we like.  However, they were not labeled as such on the menu, so if you don't much care for spicy food, definitely your waiter about your dish before you order.  The veggie samosas were delicious and also very spicy, and they were fried beautifully.  The sauces they came with were tasty as well and seemed freshly made.  The lime soda was very fresh and natural-tasting and the chai tea was very spicy and yummy.\\n\\nSo overall, this place was disappointing for me--a huge Indian food fan who was craving the flavors I know and love--but would be fine for people with dietary restrictions or limited Indian food exposure who are down for some spicy ethnic fair.

There are sushi and an appetizer. The appetizer was cooked tuna with onion zuke. The flavor was a refresh to the palette, but the sushi is extremely disappointing. The nori on the geoduck, anago and Aburi tuna was soaking wet, the shimaaji looks fresh but the taste of it was a lil bit off. The tuna was aged which is tender and full wif flavor. But then there was a huge mistake, the kanpachi belly has a bone fragment in it, its a huge mistake for a taisho(sushi head chef) to left a bone fragment in a piece of fish. The uni is not fresh and it tastes a bit fishy. Other than that, taisho washed the hokagai in order to defrost them faster, which is another huge mistake to do, it washes the flavor away. All I can taste on the hokagai is the cheese and tobi.ko on the top of the sushi. Some of the sushi rice was a lil bit too dry, which indicates the rice anything other than fresh. Another thing I would like to mention is that taisho was using a chef knife with a yellow handle. Not saying that I look down to sushi chef not using yanagi knife but throwing fish and knives around shows that the chef does not have a good attitude, even the chef cut the salmon and anago into perfect shape doesn't help to convince me the chef is great.

The dining room is fairly small and your neighbors are pretty close to you. Their is a small bar area with about 4 stools that you could sit at and have a meal. It is also pretty loud in there during dinner. Their popular dish is the adobo pork and it was quite tasty. There was one unidentifable item  (if you don't have the menu to reference) that came with the dish ( I can't remember what it was) but it was not palatable. The papas con queso empanada was wonderful. It was a flaky shell with what resembled airy whipped mashed potatoes with cheese on the inside. Deelish! The beet salad that accompanied it could use a presentation makeover. It literally looked like beets plopped out of a can and layed on its side and sliced thinly and placed on the plate. It probably would have been more appealing if it didn't look like it just came out of a can. The fried plaintains were lacking a lil something. The tropical iced tea was not as refreshing as it sounded on the menu. It was a red cloudy drink that was not sweet at all. The desserts all looked scrumptious. The chocolate cake was quite the treat. The sleeper hit of the night was my mocha at the end of the meal. I was sold when I read it was made with mexican chocolate and it was so pleasing. I woke up craving it and I'm NOT a coffee drinker. The waitress was concerned enough to come back to our table several times to confirm our orders since it was loud and she didn't want to get our order wrong..which I thought was nice of her..but here's a helpful tip: WRITE IT DOWN! so you don't have to come back 3 times to confirm.

It had a huge diverse crowd which is always fun, both for meeting others and people watching.  I would assume that there were probably 1/3-1/2 students to 2/3-1/2 professionals so you have a young demographic at this place.  \\n\\nThe two negatives I have against them are the price of the drinks and the wait.  I think they need to increase the size of the bar to serve the amount of people and charge what they do.  I should have gone downstairs for a drink (downstairs bar was empty), but was told I may not get back up.  If I was able to do that then I would not have had this complaint.  The price, at $10/drink seems a little steep since there was nothing too special about them, but it also isn't crazy high so I am not complaining too much.\\n\\nThe obvious huge plus about the place is the large rooftop area.  There isn't much of a view, but you can see some nightlife around you as well as be outside.  The air is a little stagnant with all the large umbrellas open, but its still an expansive rooftop bar with some breathing room.  This looks like it would be a great place for a weekend lunch outside.\\n\\nAdvice to patrons:\\n - keep group size from 2-8.  This is not a place to come solo and any more than 8 and your group will be too large to slip into the open spots.\\n - have a drink or two at home or somewhere else before coming here.  It just takes a while to get a drink and you will want to spend your time outside, not waiting in line.  \\n\\nAdvice to staff:\\n - consider increasing size of bar upstairs.\\n - consider closing some of the umbrellas once the dinner crowd is gone and the bar crowd show up.\\n - train bartenders to pour drinks a more consistently.

Many times it serves as a first introduction to Austin, as it was to me the first time I came to Austin many years ago. I was back in Austin for the first time in years, and a visit to Austin would be incomplete with dinner at the Salt Lick.\\n\\nWeekends at the Salt Lick can be insane. Even with a large amount of available seating, we still had to wait an hour before being seated.  The restaurant has a very outdoor Texas family style feel to it, perfect for ordering what they do best: Family Style BBQ. This allows you to eat as much beef brisket, sausage, pork ribs, potato salad, beans, and cole slaw as your stomach can handle, and you will want your stomach to handle to the point of discomfort. The meat is delicious with an excellent smoked and moist flavor. I tend to equally enjoy the brisket, ribs, and sausage and can't get enough of them. All 3 will melt in your mouth and have you craving more. They have 2 kinds of BBQ sauce -- regular and spicy -- and both are quite tasty and complement the meat very well.\\n\\nI tend to find that many Texas BBQ places overdeliver on the meat and severely underdeliver on the sides. The Salt Lick is no exception to this rule. You do get cole slaw, beans, and potato salad with the Family Style, but the truth is that they are fairly forgettable. They aren't bad but they just aren't great, so I find myself having a taste of each just to round out the palette, but I focus on the meat. Part of me wishes the sides were tastier, especially the beans and potato salad, but at the end of the day it allows me to get refills of just meat, and I have no problem with that at all!\\n\\nLike many of the original places in Austin, the Salt Lick has expanded to many more locations (including the airport in Austin and Dallas), but nothing beats the original location. The ambiance, the drive to get there, the monster smoker and staging area for the meat, the large picnic style tables--this is what makes the Salt Lick a true Texas BBQ experience. You may have to wait, but I find that the service is quite good and consistent once you are seated. The Family Style can be a bit pricey at just over $20 per adult , but it is only $9 for kids under 12 and free for 3 and under, and if you really prepare yourself you can eat a lot. And pricey or not, the quality is tremendous, and combined with the ambiance, it is well worth it.

The entertainment is great. They have Irish dancers and singers that sing both modern bands like Oasis and Mumford and Sons and traditional Irish drinking songs. The music does make the place pretty loud, but it's worth it to not talk for a bit and watch the performances. Sometimes people even get up and dance and it makes for a really fun atmosphere without anyone being too drunk or obnoxious.

The parking can be quite challenging depending when you come.  So I would do valet parking. We were seated immediately because we were joining a large party out back by the lake. It's a very nice view. We ordered a pitcher of the passion fruit margarita. I think it was a pitcher of juice instead. We waited quite awhile before our server came to take our order; I guess the he was quite busy. I ordered the blackened fish taco and chicken taco. I was not impressed. It was bland in taste, not very flavourful. Next time, if there is a next time; I will just stick with a glass instead  of a pitcher and not order the tacos.  The atmosphere is great though.

My Son ordered the grilled chz with bacon, he didn't even finish it because he literally could not chew the bacon. The only positive thing I WILL say is when they finally got the order right the chicken was good. Then when we pointed it all out our server got defensive and tried to act like we made out because they gave me a piece of chicken and biscuits to go.

The Nau Num Tok was really good and I was impressed that they seemed to use decent quality steak and cooked it very nicely.  It looks like there is a nearly identical version of this dish (larb) that just has chicken instead of beef if you don't eat red meat.  I doubt it is as good, but maybe.  I would definitely get this again.  The Thai spring rolls were pretty tasty as well.  I also tried the Tom Yum soup, which was decent but not great - I've had better so I probably wouldn't recommend it.  \\n\\nI had some of a few different main dishes as well.  The basil chicken was decent, but that dish isn't usually my favorite.  I also had a shrimp dish that I cannot remember anything about so it must have been just so-so.

The food was interesting but no where near my favorite in Cambridge.  So many more exciting options are available and more affordable elsewhere.  I could excuse all these mistakes if the food was on par but sadly it also fell short.  The dessert was also below average with an undercooked pie first.

I took my parents here after reading some reviews.  I have an unfortunate history of making them wait forever in line whenever I pick a restaurant, and this place was no exception.  However, Mike's Pastry is just a block away so I suggest having someone wait and then having someone make a cookie run to tide you over.  The place is very tiny, so you may be waiting up to an hour.  We got lucky and only stood for 20 minutes. On our way to our table, the hostess asked what was in the pastry box.  We offered her a cookie and she happily picked through the box for one she liked while we were sitting down.  I was already sold on the character of this place.  As per the suggestion of the group ahead of us in line, we ordered the house special with wine and an appetizer. \\n\\nBefore the meal, a few notes about the character of this restaurant.  Don't go here expecting a quite or romantic meal. It is tiny, the waitresses shout at the busboy from anywhere in the restaurant, and you may get the back of your head elbowed a time or two.  I thought it was great, it felt like being inside their kitchen rather than being at a restaurant.  But, this may not be your style.\\n\\nWe started with the calamari appetizer.  It was very fresh tasting, not chewy at all, and had just the right amount of breading.  The house special is a mixture of lobster, calamari, clams, and shrimp over linguine.  Get it with a bottle of wine for $10 bucks more. The wine (normally $15 a bottle) was fantastic for the price.  I would have been thrilled to come home with a $15 dollar bottle this good from the store, let alone to have it be $10 in a restaurant.  The seafood plate itself was huge.  We had to do some serious rearranging to get it to fit on the table.  Remaining calamari was moved to a bread plate, the bread basket was balanced on top of this, etc.  My favorite part of the entree was the fresh tasting pasta.  Nothing makes a meal like being able to tell the pasta was rolled out that day.  The seafood was all delicious and fresh.  My favorite was the scallops. my mom's was the shrimp, and my dad's was the lobster.  If there was one downside, I thought the Giacomo's sauce was a touch runny and would order a thicker or different one next time (of the choice of 5).  Not enough to knock it down a star though.\\n\\nThe total bill including for appetizer, a bottle of wine, a huge entree (the menu board says its for 2, but we were stuffed on what we ordered), and a very generous tip was $100 for 3 people.

Stylish and modern yet cozy inside.  The kind of interior that makes you want to relax and stay awhile.\\n\\nHawaiian Poke tuna reads more as a tartare to me but it also reads delicious no matter what name it goes by. Fresh dice of tuna accessorized with sweet white onions, sesame and a kiss of spice. Raw is always a great way to start a meal in my opinion and this is certainly flavorful but delicate enough that it won't blow out your palatte for the rest of the meal.\\n\\nA not to be missed dish on the menu is a customer favorite (including me) is the ginger soy glazed fried calamari. The calamari for people that don't even enjoy calamari.  It will put you under its spell at first taste.  It's a tough act to follow as far as starters go. Chose your following dishes carefully or just throw caution to the wind and have two plates of it and dessert! It's crispy, flavorful and all around a show stopper. \\n\\n \\n\\nWagyu Beef Carpaccio is another raw starter option.  Standardly adorned with capers, fried, shaved asiago and crispy shallots to add some texture.  There is a creamy dijon sauce but it's not entirely necessary with such buttery tender beef.\\n\\n \\n\\nSauteed Cobia was a bit overcooked but the star on the dish is not the fish but rather the risotto it rests upon. To me the absolute best preparation of risotto is with corn and lump crab. This one does not disappoint. The crab is generously studding  the perfectly cooked rice and the corn adds nice sweetness and texture.  Nice buerre blanc type reduction to finish the dish. \\n\\n \\n\\nSea bass I found overcooked also but wow!!---the forbidden rice not only is striking visually but it tastes fantastic and soaks up the lemongrass buerre blanc!\\n\\n \\n\\nFor the vegetarians the grilled eggplant lasagne is  a nice option. There are pasta sheets here but also eggplant for a meaty texture. Nicely seasoned and served in a bowl with toasty cheese bread. \\n\\n \\n\\nThe not-to-be-missed entree without question is the elk tenderloin. Get over the fact that it is elk and order it. The tenderloin is mild, cooked to perfection and incredibly satisfying as you expect red meat to be.  Another fantastic side dish here, I am seeing a pattern of the sides getting as much attention as the main star of the plate. This side is perfectly cooked sweet potato gratin.  The whole dish is finished with a flavorful raspberry mustard sauce. I find this dish absolutely craveable!\\n\\n \\n\\nFor dessert when you first actually see  the chocolate bread pudding it looks like a brownie topped with ice cream. The ice cream in this instance is vanilla and the whole dish is finished with caramel. I found the pudding lacking in flavor and perhaps was expecting it to be denser because of the brownie-like appearance.  I can't recommend it.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe apple cobbler is an all around winning dessert!  It's served in an individual ramekin with a flakey crust top and incredibly delicious and complimenting cinnamon ice cream. I could have this as a last supper dessert and not even miss my chocoholic ways. \\n\\n \\n\\nBanana foster waffle sounds like a nice idea but it misses the mark a bit. Bruleed banana pieces are on a plate with an uncrisp waffle and banana ice cream that isn't particularly flavorful.  I would pass on this and get the apple cobbler instead. \\n\\n \\n\\nReally great attentive service and beautiful atmosphere will keep me coming back along with a select few dishes I have been day dreaming about since I ate them!"},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"I love this place.

It wasn't quite what I had expected. We arrived around 1pm.\\n\\nHaving never been here before, I was trying to take everything in and decide what sandwich I wanted. They definitely had a TON of options though the specials menu on the back wall helps during the busy lunch rush. The gentleman taking my order seemed a big aggravated that I couldn't make up my mind. So, be prepared to know exactly what you want when you order; from the bread, cheese, toppings and sauces. Oh, and you literally have you yell. There was a sign warning me about that, but I didn't know how literal it would be taken. I was taken aback since it was my first time being here and I ultimately got not sauce since I didn't have time to read and decide. I guess the words to use are chaotic and unnerving. When experiencing something new, I can be an introvert and having to scream an order I'm unsure of made me uncomfortable and trust me, I'm no stranger to trying new restaurants or venues. Just look at my other reviews from living 8 years in Houston, TX. \\n\\nAt check out, they use an iPad and once again, I was taken off guard when he rotated the screen around and it prompted for a tip. I have no problem leaving a tip, but it felt forced. Ultimately, our two sandwiches with chips and drinks and (surprise!) tip, cost us about $23. \\n\\nDid I mention they also charge extra for certain toppings? Don't get me wrong, the sandwich was good, but I have had better and cheaper from a sandwich shop right here in town in Dublin GA.

The Salt Lick.\\n\\nIt's obvious that the Salt Lick is a brisket and sausage shop. The brisket is tender, just a little smoky and a decent enough representative of the style. Not superb and without much bark to speak of, but definitely better than average. \\n\\nThe sausage, on the other hand, rocks my face off--mildly spicy, and soft and tender on the inside without being greasy. I think the sausage is their stand-out item. \\n\\nThe ribs, however...meh. Wildly inconsistent, with fatty pieces being moist, smoky and tasty and others being completely dry, chewy and bland. If I had ordered ribs alone, this would be a two star review. They're that disappointing at times. \\n\\nThe original sauce is FAR too sweet, but the spicy variant is fabulously tasty. It's not very spicy, but that faint kick adds just enough to take the overwhelming taste of DIABEETUS out of your mouth. \\n\\nThe side dishes were superb (especially the beans!) and the desserts were tasty. I love that they have blackberry cobbler in addition to the peach. It's tart, it's tangy, and while cobbler isn't my favorite thing, I'd gobble this up in a heartbeat (if I had been able to stomach much at all by the end of the meal).\\n\\nThe $20 all you can eat deal is fabulous if you eat like a hoss. They just kept bringing more and more plates of food, one after the other. For me, though, it seemed like a bit of a waste, only the individual plates weren't enough of a break in price to justify ordering one. So, it's priced a bit like a tourist trap, too. \\n\\nIt's BYOB. Bring what you'd like. There's a little store on-site, but my wild guess: it's probably a bit pricey for convenience's sake, too.\\n\\nThis is kind of a neat place since the pits are all open to gawk at and they've got outdoor music on the patio playing while you wait (and wait, and wait--given that this was F1 weekend and die touristen were out in force), but the barbeque just isn't spectacular. Service once you get a table is awesomely quick, but...everyone knows about the Salt Lick, so you're going to wait. And wait. And wait some more. \\n\\nI keep wavering back and forth between giving this three or four stars. The sausage, the sides, and the atmosphere are all exceptional. The ribs just aren't very good, and the pricing (save for the \\"I can eat an entire moose by myself\\" special) is very tourist trappy. It is what it is, though. Need somewhere tourist trappy that's not half bad? Here you go. It's a spectacular place for groups if you don't all mind coughing up $20 a head for the all you can eat deal."},{"name":"Row 34","address":"383 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I received exceptional service from Row 34 tonight.

I watched as they finished up the space and prepared to open.\\n\\nOnce it opened, I can say that it was completely worth the wait! \\n\\nLocated on Cabot Street in Beverly's quaint downtown, Tartine showcases a beautifully renovated space with white marble countertops and a color scheme that invites a lot of crisp natural light. The staff behind the counter are awesome and willing to give a stellar recommendation if you're torn or in a pinch. \\n\\nI make my way to Tartine daily and thoroughly enjoy each visit. The coffee is amazing and reminds me why I drink coffee in the first place; each sip is a reminder to my taste buds about how I fell in love with caffeine! I've sampled just about everything on the menu and all are wonderful. The Tartine, the eponymous name of the restaurant, is an open faced sandwich on artisanal bread with a side salad (or soup!). The portion is generous and the flavor combinations range from savory to sweet. Fig and goat cheese; ham, cheese, & cornichon; smoked salmon and herbed cheese spread; smoked trout mousse and micro greens; Brie, pear, honey, and walnuts; hummus and roasted vegetables; and mozzarella with tomato. The side salad is fresh + light with a nice vinaigrette tossed lightly on top. The soups are made fresh daily and they're amazing! Seriously, they're GF and dairy free and full of the most comforting flavors; they are served in a large round bowl with two slices of bread with a nice pat of butter. So simple and yet so filling! \\n\\nIn addition to Tartine sandwiches they have breakfast offerings, dessert, pastry, Belgian sugar waffles, quiche, soups, salads, desserts, and a selection of Belgian beers and wine.\\n\\nThe owners are knowledgeable about the beer selection and serve your choice in the appropriate glass with a side of cheese as an accompaniment. I've explored a few of them and my choices were quite mellow, but there's a wide range of styles with varying ABV content, which is available to see on the selection board.\\n\\nThe Belgian Chocolate cake is to die for, so if you're a dessert person then this cake is for you! It doesn't look fancy and it might fly under your radar but packed within each bite of this simple cake is off-the-chart chocolatey goodness! It's rich and satisfying to say the least and paired with a macchiato it's heaven on earth! There are also cookies and lemon cake available and both of those are worth while too--the lemon flavor is courtesy of the lemons and juicer they have in house. \\n\\n\\n\\nIf you're looking for a good food, good coffee, a nice atmosphere, and great service, then stop by Tartine and enjoy the experience!

Prices seemed to be a tad higher than other brunch places but it is also a little more fancy. We got there right after they opened on a Saturday and the place was already 1/3 filled. They have fresh juices AND Kombucha!! \\n\\nThe servers were all very good and our main server even went out of her way to bring us a little special mini-dessert with \\"Happy Anniversary\\" scrolled on a chocolate disk! \\n\\nThe only thing keeping them from 5 stars was the music- it was WAY louder than it needed to be and very obnoxious.

The broth is chicken based with pork infused miso paste. It is very creamy and delicious! The noodles are perfectly cooked and go very well with the broth and the scallion in it. The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars was that the pork meat in the soup is torched, which creates a slight burnt taste that I didn't particularly like.

Saturday night, prime dinner time, the North End - the odds are stacked against us. Still, the weather was beautiful and so we did not mind the walking we had to do to find a place with less than a half hour wait. Terramia was a tiny little gem tucked away from the chaos of Hanover. We walked in and asked if there was a wait for two and one of the staff, Gabriel, told us that he might be able to fit us in. Within two minutes, we were ushered into the small, quaint space and seated in the middle of the dining room. The candlelit lighting was just right and it seemed as though the tables around us were enjoying their time. Gabriel was our server and helped us navigate the menu, informed us of their specials for the evening, and then assisted us in choosing a wine. The bread was nice and crusty, however, we wished it was a little bit warmer. For some reason it just felt cold, not room-temperature, but cold. I ordered the pappardelle bolognese and my friend ordered the ravioli aperto. The bolognese was a little bit sweeter than I expected so the pepper was much appreciated. The wait staff checked in on us regularly and were really attentive to us. I still want to try out the other restaurants in the North End, but overall this was a good experience.

It is one of the the best burgers I have tasted with flavor combinations that my taste buds had yet to experience. The JapaJam has a lightly sweet Japanese tomato jam under the all beef burger.  Then it is topped with jack cheese, a fried egg, tangy Japanese BBQ sauce with the slightest hint of vinegar and onion strings. The bun was soft and of good quality. I found a hiding place where I could devour this beast like a HANGRY heathen. The food was so delicious that I ate it embarrassingly fast and I must say that I have never been so happy to have egg on my face!\\n\\nToday I returned to Yum√© Burger for their soft launch at Hops & Grain. I ordered the Oishii burger which is a tempura whitefish with wasabi slaw and Japanese tartar sauce & pickles. The creamy slaw, tartar and pickles perfectly complimented the crisp fish.  They use Hops & Grains beer in the tempura batter and the Oishii pairs well with their Kolsch.\\n\\nI tried both the hand cut fries with sesame salt and without. The sesame salt fries were decent but just not my thing. I preferred the regular finely cut fries with the pink sauce. You can order a dipping sauce to accompany the regular hand cut fries to include Japanese BBQ sauce, wasabi mayo and pink sauce. \\n\\nThe burgers  (which also includes chicken katsu and Oishii menu items) are a good sized portion and priced pretty well at $5.55. They also offer discounted combo meals.\\n\\nEric Silverstein, also owner of The Peached Tortilla, greeted customers and sought out honest feedback.

Some of the negative reviews here have had complaints that seem to be about aspects of the pizza that are traditional.  It is a good representation of a Neapolitan pizza.  It is not a NY style pizza, or an American style pizza. It is not meant to be a showcase for how many toppings you can put on it, or to be huge, and filled with extra cheese. It is to be a balance of toppings so that all shine, and it is about the size for one hungry person to eat, so buy accordingly, and the crust should have a nice char.

I'm very amazed at how horrible this was. Me and my mother decided to get dinner, mind you it was about 8:25 and we didn't leave till about 10. We got there and sat down, when the waitress had come over we already decided what we were going to have. We both had water with lemon, fried pickles for an appetizer, my mother got a chicken quesadilla and I got the NY sirloin with broccoli and salad. Mind you, the steak was $20 which isn't bad for 14 oz, but in this case it's awful. The salad was the first to come out, (as expected) and after I had eaten it, me and my mother waited for the pickles. It took about 20 minutes for them to come out and they came out without the dipping sauce. Beforehand, we had heard our waitress apologizing to her other customers for the manager's and kitchens actions. After eating the pickles, the waitress came over and told us the food should be out soon (the kitchen was backed up). After waiting another 25 minutes the quesadilla came out (only two pieces were eaten in total). I was still waiting for my steak. About 2-3 minutes after waiting it came. I did not get a steak knife and I was left to cut with a butter knife. I cut the steak open (which I ordered medium rare) and the inside was completely raw. Not one bit cooked! So I sent it back to the kitchen, it came out about 7 minutes later and I cut it open once again, this time, the outside was completely burnt and the inside was still very rare. After refusing to eat this we got the check. The manager had come over to apologize and explain. Her name was Judy. She had only taken off the steak, (which she should have) but I also think she should've given us more of an offer. She offered us a free appetizer for the next time knowing damn well we weren't going to return. She told us they had only TWO cooks on the grill. Two cooks is not enough for a restaurant that size. This was 1 of the 3 experiences (years apart) that have been absolutely terrible. I have never been so frustrated and angry with a restaurant in my life. I will NEVER return here and I recommend nobody goes here. I would give it 0 stars if I could. However I do wanna add in that our waitress was absolutely wonderful.

We sat in the patio area when we could finally snag a table since it was so packed! There were still plates and cups from the previous group, so we stacked them and placed them aside so the staff would notice them and take them away. We waited a good 15 mins for our server to finally come by. By then, we already knew what we wanted to order. Our server had a tablet to take drink and food orders. It seemed complicated though because she had to keep scrolling up and down to find certain items. It took longer to order our food and drinks than waiting for her to come to our table. Since we knew it was going to be a while, we all ordered two drink each. My cousin and I shared their pepperoni flat bread which was $10, and the carne asada tacos, which came with 3 tacos and a side of chips, sour cream, and two containers of salsa. The menu isn't huge, but seemed good for snacking and sharing with groups.The setting was nice and modern with a nice view of the Moda Center and the fountain in front of it. Our drinks came out to us shortly after wards in the order that we placed the order. Our flat bread came out about 10-15 mins later. The flat bread was nothing too special. It was just a thin crust rectangular pizza. It didn't taste horrible, but nothing out of this world. We waited forever for our tacos. It was literally about 45mins to an hour after placing our order, is when it came out. They had to prepare more meat. That's understandable, but almost an hour? Can I say the tacos were worth the wait? Not so much, but we were hungry, so it was good at the moment. The cocktails tasted like juice. I barely tasted any alcohol in mine. Luckily we all ordered shots as well. Maybe they had a short of staff that night, or maybe there is just no organization. I wish my experience was better, because it seems like a great hang out place!

My husband went to Antico without me when it opened (aw shucks..) with some friends and said it was absolutely delicious!

Now I was really looking forward to my visit...!\\n\\nWhen I finally made my way over, we went there early before the rush around 5:30pm.  There was no one in there eating. Whewhoo.

Other than the family style table,  you only have the eat and run style bar located along the walls.

The taste was really delicious, just like I remembered.  I was disappointed though, because for some reason our pizza was like soup in the middle?  We couldn't pick up the slice because the fresh tomato sauce was making the dough soggy and fall apart.

Finally after what was close to an hour, we received our food. I ordered pierogi and my boyfriend ordered a kielbasa on a roll. Our sever did a drop and run, put our food down and left. No apology at how long it took, no \\"can I get you anything else?\\" I look down and my pierogi is swimming and oil, I've gotten it several times before and it never looked like this. So I poured the oil on to my side plate to make the meal edible. My sour cream accidentally slipped into the oil that I was pouring. I tried for about 5 minutes to get someone's attention (server had still not been back to check on us). Another server was passing by and I said \\"excuse me\\" she literally gave me the \\"one second finger\\" and kept walking.

My BF and I sat at the bar in the back and started with ordering a few cocktails. They were fine, but nothing to write home about (in my opinion, better cocktails are found next door at either The Independent or BackBar). We then ordered a few small plates; the roasted parsnips, fries, brussels sprouts and grilled corn (side note: the vegetarian options at this place are minimal). The fries came out quickly, which was great since we were hungry, but they were nothing special. Next came the brussels spouts and parsnips. The parsnip dish was great, albeit a bit on the small side, but the brussels sprouts were terribly undercooked and almost inedible. So sad. What's more sad is that the grilled corn we ordered never ended up coming out.  We found out when we got the bill, that the order for them had not even been put in, humph. But by this point, we were so disappointed in the lack of attentiveness from the bartender (the bar was far from, packed, so we both found this a bit odd), that we didn't even want to argue or wait around any longer. We just paid the bill and left.\\n\\nI then went to brunch here with a bunch of friends yesterday, and just like before, was not impressed with the food and was appalled by the service. I started off brunch with the bloody mary, which was fine, but again, nothing to write home about, and very small for the $10 price tag. I ordered the mushroom toast, and was again, not impressed with the size of the dish nor the flavor. The best dish at the table seemed to be the chorizo omelet, but everything else was bland or mediocre. But it was the service that really made this experience horrible. We were one of only a few tables outside at brunch on a nice day, but even so, the waitress was no where to be found after our food came out. We had a hard time getting any wait staff attention to order more drinks, or ask for a side of butter to be put on toast.

Oysters are always fresh and in abundance, last time I checked, there was not a full bar (Mass has it's quirks with getting a full liquor license) but they do carry a great selection of the \\"off the beaten path\\" beers and wine. \\nThe main dishes (while the menu is not huge) are always executed perfectly and change slightly with seasons. \\nEvery time I am in Bean Town, I always try to pop in. \\n\\nOh, btw, reservations are hard to come by :) so the trick is to come right at opening or 5 minutes before and dine at the bar area to beat the dinner reservations rash."},{"name":"Antico Forno","address":"93 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Food was amazing.

Every place makes it slightly differently and Sawasdee has come up with an excellent combination of ingredients.  \\n\\nI've also tried the pad thai here before and that was also done well.

This restaurant has received glowing reviews and we had waited six months for our reservation for our party of four.  It is difficult to even write this review because we had hoped that the restaurant meal would please us and we try to be supportive of Portland restaurants, which we think are generally excellent.  My husband and I have spent the last week and a half speculating on what must have happened.  Were the chefs on vacation?  Are they resting on their laurels?  Are they not doing well financially and now cutting corners?  That would explain some of our disappointment but not all.  For example, the service was as disappointing as the food.\\n\\nWe dined there on Saturday, January 16th and the meal was built around Central Thailand cuisine.  Although the food of Central Thailand might be unexceptional, it must be better than this.  (So far we've loved all regional Thai cuisine that we've sampled both in the US and in Thailand.)\\n\\nThe appetizers, especially the Miang sum-O (little wraps of fish, pomelo, shallot, chili, lime and ginger that reminded us of Miang Kum) and the Kanom krok (scallops, lemongrass and coconut cream served in a crispy rice cup), were good and the meal looked promising.  However none of the remaining courses lived up to the promise.  The soup course of Dungeness crab, green curry mousse, basil and kefir lime was flavorless.  We were excited about the salads, based on the description of their ingredients and we all love Southeast Asian salads, but they just didn't have the zing of the salads we love. The one with Wagyu beef was particularly disappointing because the so-called Wagyu beef (domestically produced, if I remember correctly) was not flavorful and was so gristly as to be inedible. Not at all like the Wagyu beef course we recently had at N/Naka in Los Angeles.  We chewed for a bit, then spit it out.  Why put Wagyu beef culotte on the menu as one of your ingredients if you can't cook it to at least mimic the flavor and texture of real Wagyu beef?  \\n\\nThe main course trilogy was a mackerel dish, a pork jowl dish and a shrimp curry dish, all of which compared unfavorably with our local Thai restaurant two miles down the road.  Bland and unexceptional.  Dessert consisted of two puddings, one slightly smoky, one just bland.  They were less than unexceptional.  We didn't eat either one. \\n\\nWe ordered the matching wine pairings as well as cocktails before the meal.  There was not enough time allowed in the two-sitting time frame to enjoy the cocktails so if you must go, I'd recommend foregoing the cocktails.  The wine was not paired well with the food in my opinion.  I always order wine pairings and have never before been disappointed in a restaurant's choice.  This time I found the wines to actually conflict with the food, so ended up drinking the pared wines before and after the courses and drinking water with the food!  It was really disconcerting.\\n\\nThe servers were pleasant but unprofessional.  Once my food was taken away before I had finished and twice both mine and one of our fellow diners' wine was taken away before we had finished.\\n\\nAll in all, I'd suggest saving your money and going to Pok Pok, where the food has never disappointed us."},{"name":"OB's Cafe","address":"74 Billings Rd","city":"North Quincy","stars":"4","text":"the air conditioning was on. the service was terrible. the cheese omelet had some sort of cheese whiz in it. the fries were cooked in old oil giving them a metallic flavor. the monte cristo wasn't even coated in egg - it had dried turkey, ham and god knows what on it. not sure why yelpers like this place. in fact, the service was sooooooooooo bad, i did something i've never done before - i left $1.50 on a $15 tab. my norm would've been four or five bucks. ugh. twenty bucks WASTED."},{"name":"The Lower Depths","address":"476 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I think this place is great!

Genius!\\n\\n2) The pork ribs were excellent.  A little sparse on the meat, but excellent flavor and you can get more (see #1 above)\\n\\n3) The sausages were exceptional.\\n\\n4) The house sauce had great flavor and went well with everything\\n\\nCons:\\n5) The brisket was dry.  Perhaps we caught them on a bad day, but to me this is a cardinal sin.  I use brisket as my BBQ measuring stick.  Most places can do it but only the cream of the crop can do it really well.  I was a little disappointed.\\n\\n6) The habanero sauce was really mild.  Sure, I like really hot foods, but my Mom could have eaten this without batting an eye (she hates hot food, just for the record).  Even adding the table pepper sauce didn't do the trick...bummed\\n\\nAll in all, however, this place rocks.

The voucher was good for two appetizers, two entrees, and two desserts.  The menu offered both staple items and seasonal items.  They start you off with some bread and breadsticks with butter.  The butter was so hard it was almost impossible to cut some and spread it on the bread.  They should let it soften some.\\n\\nFor the appetizers, we got the salad with candied nuts (yum) and the mussels (meh).  The mussels were a bit tough for my taste and needed more garlic.  For our entrees we both got the angus filet, but at different temperatures (they ended up switching our orders but that's OK).  It was very delicious.  Cooked very tender and good seasoning.  Also, comes with garlic butter on top. Surprisingly, along with the entrees we got steak fries, marrow, and asparagus with hollandaise sauce.  All of it was great.  The marrow was perfect for dipping the fries in.  For dessert, we got the smore ice cream sandwich and mango sorbet.  The  mango sorbet was divine- tasted just like mango, didn't seem artificial at all.  And they give you 3 ample spoonfuls.  The smore ice cream sandwich was also good, but the placement of the marshmallow on top was not wise.  It kept sliding around on top of the ice cream and was hard to cut.  The cookie bottom was bit bland.  The b/f ordered Texas margaritas.  They were surprisingly small for $11.50.  \\n\\nSo I don't think our voucher was really processed correctly.  It actually didn't cover our food costs as it should have. There was also some weird extra fee that showed up on our bill that didn't make any sense- a payment fee or something.  But being that they didn't charge us for the last margarita we ordered, it ended up being around where we should have been.  So we didn't complain.  But I'm still pretty upset they screwed that up. We coulda got shafted,\\n\\nOther than the billing issue, service was OK.  Took our waiter a long time to get to us initially.

In my experience, the crust is usually over cooked and sometimes so black that it is inedible.  The toppings are good (great variety) as well as the cheese, but the sauce leaves something to be desired.  Also, by the time the pizza gets to my apartment it is always soggy and floppy.  I will assume this is because of the time spent in transit, but I would still like it to be semi-crisp by the time it arrives.

The waiter listed off the night's specials so fast that I only processed a couple of words. Our calamari was served in about 5 minutes and we tried our best to slow down the dining experience and relax. This wasn't too easy as the eager diners waiting in line outside had their noses pressed to the window examining our every move. Our main courses came before the calamari was even finished, our wine glasses were refilled every time we took a sip, and you could feel the eyes of the wait staff pressuring you to eat/drink faster. As each person finished their plate, it was immediately cleared, again pressuring the others to eat faster. Although I must admit that the food was delicious, I was forced to eat so fast that I barely even remember what anything tasted like. After paying the check, we still had 1/2 a bottle of Chianti left. I think if it was legal, the waiters would have told us to take it to go. The second I stood up to put on my coat, the table was being cleared, new plates and silverware were being thrown on the table, and I was essentially being pushed out the door.

The menu has been squeezed to half its former size.  The wait staff seems squeezed to serve more tables faster.  The prices have crept up in some areas and not others, but the overall effect is a deeper bite on the wallet.  But most importantly, the food has lost that creative zeal that made it exciting.

Aquitaine is good enough for grabbing quick bite to fill oneself up, but offers mediocre quality.\\n\\nOur online reservation (done a week earlier) could not be found, but we did not have to wait. Initially we were placed on large long shared bench where tables almost touch each other so anyone can listen in to a conversation. We had asked for more privacy in the reservation so we asked to be relocated to a booth (they also have loose tables in middle) and got the booth after some hesitation of staff. No 'of course, we need to make up for reservation hitch'.\\n\\nThe menu was much too limited with much less choices than even a neighborhood restaurant or bistro would offer. The Aquitaine Dedham carries a lot less dishes than its Boston counterpart.\\n\\nThe mussels appetizer had delicious sauce to dip in, but there were way too few of the mussels. No other restaurant serves that few. \\n\\nWe asked for a second helping of the nice warm baguette we initially got, but the waiter (after first saying a strange 'I'll see what I can do',) failed to find more baguette and came with croutons instead (after we had to remind him of our request).\\n\\nAn appetizer salad with breaded goat cheese was super, very fresh. \\n\\nWine glasses are expensive here ($8-12). \\n\\nThe fries I asked with my sole meuniere entree were terrible, too brown, soaked with fat and also with water from the fish as the amateurish cook wrongly put the sole on top of fries instead of as a side. The fries were also little thin,  not really French which are large. Even then, McDonald's fries are better than these. \\n\\nThe sole was not well spiced if at all, mushy and not flat as it should be, but stacked on a wet bed of green beans and fries. A true sole meuniere should taste buttery, but it did not. The dessert profiteroles were much too thick, but the warm chocolate sauce with vanilla ice cream helped compensate that a bit.\\n\\nOur wait staff was friendly, but the waiters (not only ours) were way too rushed (running around instead of walking and interrupting our sentences when ordering), making us uncomfortable, rushed.\\n\\nThe place was also too noisy with inappropriate sports TV and rap music.Therefore not recommended for a romantic evening out.\\n\\nAll in all we spent about $125 for 2 people, including tip.\\n\\nAquitaine cannot compete with the much better quality and service (for the same price) of its nearby competitor Isabella's in Dedham.\\n\\nIt is unfortunate that this is now the second newly opened restaurant in Legacy Place in Dedham that fails to meet even the minimum expectations.

They have the nice char and smokey flavor in it. \\n\\nOne thing I didn't realize the first time I went there is that the ramen comes with little or no veggies. So plan to add them to your dish if you are a veggie lover to your ramen. \\n\\nUsually there is a wait to go in this place. Plan on waiting at least half and hour. Put your name in and go to the bar next door for some drinks.

We started off with the chicken empanadas..the empanada was perfectly cooked and crispy on the outside just like it should be. The chicken was perfectly cooked but had an excellent flavor...mmm garlic. Thei next dish was the traditional arroz con pollo. Definitely not their best dish, the chicken was overcooked and dry whle the rice was mushy. To top it off, the traditional Cuban flavors were nonexistent. Normally you expect to experience that O-moment when those Cuban flavors hit your palate. Alas I did not have the moment. However, their Plato Comunista was decent. The yuca was excellent.

Ok, so firstly, \\"Dedham?!?\\", you say?  But if you've got a car it takes about as long to get yourself to whatever snazzy establishment across the city as it does to hop on the highway and end up at this Aquitaine, just seconds off the exit from 95.  Get yourself a designated driver and enjoy the night.  And secondly, \\"surprisingly enticing\\" = LL Bean + huuuge Whole Foods + Apple Store + Merrell + cinema + JP Licks + PF Changs... all built like a California mall instead of a northeastern-style strip mall -- you get the point: surprising. Not an Applebees or Dress Barn in sight.\\n\\nNow, on to the restaurant itself.  Atmosphere: French, pleasant; obviously constructed without being blatently fake (think of their sister restaurant Gaslight -- and if you haven't been there, free parking on Friday & Saturdays in the South End -- take 'em up on the offer).  Marble bar with built-in lights is a nice addition.  Tables with paper table\\"cloths\\" and semi-circular booths add to the the French image.  Food is delightful and appropriately priced -- we can personally recommend the fondue appetizer and mushroom tagliatelle and tuna entr√©es.  House wines are well-chosen for popular appeal (we, ahem, tried both) and priced (like the food, appropriately) at $6.50 a glass.  We loved our waitress, Kat, and our bartender, Kevin, who helped turn what could have been a 1.5-hour visit into an exceptionally relaxed & fun 4-hour evening.\\n\\nAll-told, I think the Aquitaine group constructed a really great restuarant.  It's worth a visit, even though it isn't on the subway, because it's a blatently nice restaurant, and because someone seems to have decided to construct a little up-scale chain store oasis in a suburb that, technically, borders Boston.

He didnt wash his hands, and the adult in the kitchen who he was helping did not seem to think twice about that either! I am guessing that all the fans of this place are fellow delivery orderers.

I was hoping to see how it measured up to my family cooking. See, my father's side of the family is Cuban and I've been lucky enough to grow up and have my abuela and mother (who was taught all the tricks by my abuela) cooking all sorts of yumminess for me. My sister and I also do a bit of Cuban cooking, but we're more Vegan/Veggie friendly when we do it! No ham hocks here! \\n\\nNow, I didn't come here with the expectations to be blown away. My dad had been here before and told me it's not exactly really \\"authentic\\" Cuban. I've also heard it from other Cuban friends that live up here; it's more a mix of different Caribbean style and Cuban food . And I'll agree, there are lots of things on the menu that you would never find in a Cuban kitchen or restaurant in Miami. But aside from the tostones being a bit dry and lacking in salt, everything was ok. \\n\\nI was disappointed we were limited to ordering either breakfast or sandwiches at the time we dined. They only serve from those menus on weekends until 2pm. Meaning no platos for me. I wound up ordering the Elena Ruz sandwich and  a papas con queso empanada to split with my boyfriend. I would give them another star alone for having Ironbeer on the Menu, but it's kind of spendy being $2 for a 12 oz can. It looks like they've got a pretty good Happy Hour menu, and the brightly colored building would be enough to cheer up anyone suffering from SAD. It might not be what I've known growing up, but I think it's worth a trip when I've got a craving and not necessarily in the mood to stretch my tiny kitchen beyond it's limits for some garbanzo frito or arroz amarillo."},{"name":"Nakato Japanese Restaurant","address":"1776 Cheshire Bridge Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Getting to the point.

A chicken breast is coated and fried, then laced with your choice of hot sauce and placed on a nice-sized burger bun. It is topped with smoky slaw and garlic herb aioli\\n\\nNormally, my instincts would be to get the \\"XXX\\" sauce, no questions asked. But here, I was on a mission for the most flavor possible, especially if the ball was in my court to determine the hot sauce. So I merely tried their XXX sauce, which the owner said had a mixture of four spicy peppers, including the habanero.\\n\\nThe XXX was spicy, but not the spiciest thing I've ever had. That was confirmed when I was told there were no ghost peppers or extracts in the XXX. For me, all I could really get was smoky heat and a bit of spicy heat. Not much flavor here, and frankly, that XXX sauce would be inedible to many -- either because of heat or off-putting flavors.\\n\\nThe \\"Hot\\" sauce was milder, but had better flavor. This sauce also uses habanero peppers, but at least it sticks more with a traditional, tangy hot sauce. For flavor's sake, I went with the Blazer with hot sauce, and the aioli on the side.\\n\\nThe chicken -- fried and cooked to order -- was very good. The breading gave the sandwich that great fried chicken crunch that a ton of people love. Unfortunately, that breading also easily pulled off, and seeing that was just unappetizing. I'm not sure if they do the flour-to-egg-wash-to-bread crumb deal.\\n\\nAs far as the seasonings go, the spice was there, but again, not too overpowering so I could enjoy my meal. The smoky slaw worked here because I picked the tangier hot sauce (and not the XXX). Had I chosen the XXX, I know it would have been smokiness overload. The bun was room temperature to the touch, although I saw it was toasty on the inside of each half.\\n\\nThe aioli was quite successful. It had a nice, creamy texture; the garlic just pops in your mouth and works so well with the herbs.\\n\\nCackalack's also makes their own pickles (put in the sandwich as well), and I felt that was pretty successful. The pickles retained a good crunch and picked up some slight tang from the pickling. I guess I'm just so used to the bold flavors of dill pickles that these pickles were just ordinary to me. Kudos to Cackalack's for at least making their own, though.\\n\\nI got awesome service from Stephanie Barcelona, one of Cackalack's owners. She answered all my questions regarding their three sauces and gave me samples of the sauce upon my request.\\n\\nAnother thing: I would like to see more variety in sauces from Cackalack's. Something more than mild, hot, and XXX for the adventurous eater like myself.\\n\\nThe portion justifies the $7 price tag, but I think I would enjoy a smaller sandwich. It's not the size of the food that lures me, it's the unique tastes and great flavors that bring me back. Here, the flavors were just OK, so I'm pretty hesitant on returning. While I certainly appreciate Cackalack's going to great lengths to make great homemade food, in the end, Cackalack's basically serves their take on a spicy fried chicken sandwich."},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"My wife and I stopped in on 11/16/12(a friday) around 5:15ish.\\nWe got a table right away, but the place was pretty packed.\\nIt was warm, bordering on uncomfortably hot.

This place is apparently popular for their buckwheat pancakes so we had to try it. We also had their special soup that day which was butternut squash (my fav) and we had their beet toast. The soup was so good! It was one of the best butternut squash soup I ever had because it had good flavor and you can taste the squash. The beet toast was surprisingly good too. I was amazed how the vegan cheese crumble on top actually tasted like goat cheese! I also really enjoyed the taste and texture of their gluten-free toast. I ate the pancakes last and it was amazing! Soft and tasty! It was my fav compared to the toast because the beet had this strong pickle-like taste which takes time to get used to but my bf loved it a lot. \\nOverall, a very good place to check and try out!

I tend to think of a sports bar. Some tv's playing some games, a nice casual feel and a fair selection of cheap to moderately priced - slightly less than healthy food. \\n\\nMy sister had a long layover in Orlando last night and asked us to come up and meet her for dinner. Wanting something more than what we could get from the food court, our selections were pretty limited - but we found McCoy's which is located upstairs in the Hyatt. \\n\\nBeing so tucked away, there were very few people there. In fact, we stood around at the entrance for a good minute or so before someone noticed we were waiting to be seated. \\n\\nWe've been to a lot of hotels and hotel restaurants over the years - including ones calling themselves \\"blah-blah bar and grill\\". This one felt like one of the slightly \\"fancier\\" (and I hesitate to use that word) restaurants versus a bar and grill. \\n\\nBut decor aside, it would be the food and menu that really define what this restaurant is. It's an interesting mix. You can choose to order from a sushi menu or from the standard menu. The sushi menu looked alright - nothing really caught our attention, but we really weren't in the mood for sushi. The standard menu looked and sounded vaguely interesting - offering a little bit of something for everyone. Angus or kobe burgers, pasta, seafood, grilled eggplant sandwiches, salads - you were pretty well covered. \\n\\nI ordered the shrimp linguini, while my sister ordered the crab cakes and my wife decided to get the travelers combo (or something like that) - a combination of 3 appetizers. She chose some potatoes, a shrimp cocktail and a grilled cheese.\\n\\nWhile we waited, we ate the free bread and butter. At least, we ate the bready part of it. This was the definition of a crusty bread. It looked and felt more like a biscotti than a piece of bread.\\n\\nThe food came out pretty quickly - a particularly good thing in an airport. Starved, we dove in. My shrimp linguini was decent, but unremarkable. It was surprisingly less greasy/oily than I expected it to be. It was pretty flavorless though.\\n\\nMy sister enjoyed her crab cakes and asked for a bit more of the dipping sauce. The waiter asked if she meant the jalapeno remoulade. She was unsure - the dipping sauce she had been eating was not spicy at all - and she doesn't like spicy things - surely a jalepeno remoulade would spicy, right? He brought some more out, and it was the same sauce she had been eating. \\n\\nEveryone has probably ordered a giant appetizer plate at some restaurant for dinner at one time or another. Get them at some place like Perkins or Friendly's or Friday's, and you'll get a big plate full of food that is more than enough food for a few people as a meal. That's what my wife was expecting here.\\n\\nThat's not what she got. Instead, there were three tiny little plates - the size of tea or coffee plates. The shrimp cocktail came in a glass barely bigger than a shot glass. The potatoes looked like they were deep fried potato skins, not a plate of roasted potatoes. The grilled cheese looked like toast meant for bruschetta. And when she was all done with it, my wife was nowhere near full.\\n\\nWe asked for the dessert menu and the waiter brought around a big cart with a display. I figured it was a fake setup like Texas de Brazil has, but the waiter made a comment when he showed us the chocolate covered strawberries that sounded like, \\"we have three left\\" as he pointed to the three in the display.\\n\\nAll in all, this was an unoffensive, but ultimately disappointing experience. The service was acceptable, but the waiter seemed a little \\"out of it\\" when he was talking to us. For the price, however, this was not a good deal. The prices were bordering theme park prices and unfortunately, so was the quality."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"This past weekend, I had some friends in town from Dallas who wanted to go out for barbecue. Being the reasonable man I am, I was adamant we go to Lockhart. Being the completely-out-of-touch-with-reality man that I am, I forgot that it was Sunday and Kreuz's was closed, and Smitty's was closing early. Having already had Black's not so long ago, my friends and I decided to make the trek out to Driftwood to try Salt Lick, mostly because of the great reviews on Yelp, partially because my friend had plotted out the longest, most scenic drive possible to our destination. \\n\\nWhen we arrived, it was complete bedlam, but I am assuming that is the norm for them. We debated on family style, but ultimately ended up just ordering for ourselves. I had the ribs and brisket, sauce on the side, and I will point out, that I am not a brisket snob, as so many of my fellow Texans. But I do know a good meat, and this was only so-so. It was a little dry, save for the singular end piece I received, and benefited greatly from the addition of sauce. This seemed to be the general consensus in our group, save for our driver, who ordered the chopped brisket sandwich, which was slathered in sauce, and frankly delicious. The ribs I received were moist, had good bark, and were rich in flavor. From what I could tell, one other member of my party received some rather dried out ribs, which to his palate were a little lacking in the taste department. I was (and still am!) rather impressed with the sauce, we actually ended up taking all of our left over sauce home and have been using it on various things throughout the week. Tangy, just thick enough, and not overly sweet, exactly the combination I want out of barbecue sauce. The potato salad was surprisingly better than most barbecue joints, which are usually totally lacking when it comes to sides (see my review of Danny's). Their bread was quite excellent, a much welcomed upgrade from your average slice of Sunbeam, apparently they bake it themselves, which is a definite plus for me. The blackberry cobbler was tasty, it is obviously rich in essential corn syrups, as I happened a glance at a huge jug of Karo sitting by the order window, but I still strangely enjoyed it.\\n\\nI did not have a chance to check out their winery, but that is on my list for next time, if there is one. The atmosphere here is one of the main reasons I would go back, and by atmosphere I mean, of course, the BYOB. All said and done, if you're just looking for a nice afternoon out, I'd recommend Salt Lick as a place to bring a group, drink some beer, and eat some meat."},{"name":"Rocco's Tacos & Tequila Bar","address":"7468 W Sand Lake Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is pretty rad.

It just seem like it was broiled in the oven. It lacked seasoning. I also requested for medium rare but the temperature of the steak was more towards medium- medium well. I can definitely make a better steak at home. Especially because this was Ruth's Chris, I also had higher expectations. \\n\\nFor dessert, I got to try the creme br√ªl√©e and cheesecake.

The Bisque tasted good, but every other spoon had a bit of shell hidden in it that i had to pull from my mouth.   I wish i could find a place that served a meaty Bisque like the Soup Nazi in NYC.  The Scallops seemed ok, but i wasn't sure what to do with the clump of lemon grass that littered the top of the meal.  The Risotto was too salty.  \\n\\nMy wife ordered the Filet Mignon, but was told about 15 minutes later that they had sold out already.

Open only a week or two, the restaurant was packed when we visited. Unfortunately, although the decor is beautiful, it didn't include acoustic treatment, so the dining room was at a deafening level--enough that my companion and I had to keep repeating ourselves, even though we were at a small table for two.\\n\\nThe food also passes muster. I've never been a huge fan of Norman's at the Ritz Carlton, but I thought three of the dishes we had here were better than anything I've ever had there. \\n\\nThe Caesar salad was enlivened by some lemon zest, a trick I will try at home.\\n\\nChaufa \\"Aeropuerto\\" was an Asian-influenced fried rice dish with grilled octopus and sausage. The octopus and sausage were just okay, but the rice flavors were wonderful. This is a large starter, but would make an excellent side dish.\\n\\nThe fried cornish game hen was excellent, like a wonderful fried chicken, and served with good collard greens and mac and cheese.\\n\\nThe only miss was the duck breast that our waiter highly recommended. It looked unappetizing, and the \\"mole\\" sauce bore no relationship to a true mole, overpowered by odd tasting herbs.\\n\\nThe third aspect of a good restaurant is the service staff, and the place was certainly heavily staffed. But our waiter was in way over his head. Upon taking our order he told us he'd \\"try to get the wine out as soon as he could,\\" as if this required some Herculean effort. Apparently it did, as it didn't arrive until we were almost done with our first course. Someone should also mention to him that you present the bottle before opening it, and you don't fill the wine glasses to the brim to save yourself a trip later. And had we not anticipated his failure to pace the meal, I'm pretty sure our entrees would have arrived before we'd even finished that course.\\n\\nManagement seemed involved, so perhaps this will be corrected as they adjust staff levels. \\n\\nOverall I'd say that if you're in the area and want good food, 1921 is worth a try, as long as you don't plan on having a conversation during dinner."},{"name":"Sweetish Hill Bakery","address":"1120 W 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Negative stars.

It could have been fate. Or, it could have been a fortuitous google search. But whatever compelled us to go to The Porter in 5 Points last Tuesday night, I am forever grateful for it. \\n\\nWe walked in and were given the option to sit bar or booth. As magnificent as the bar looked (and miles long, I might add) we were there for food as well as drink, so we picked booth. Our hostess led us back for what seemed like ages, the bar looks small from the outside but there is plenty of seating in the back. The atmosphere was very cozy and the lighting was fairly dim, perfect for a cold night in a local bar. Various sundries lined the shelves, as did cases and cases of beer.\\n\\nOur server was great! He gave us an overview of the menu, which can be kind of overwhelming due to the incredible selection of beers. Thankfully (and probably strategically) each item on the menu is paired with a suggested beer, so that made it easier for us to order. I'm fairly certain if there was a beer or ale you wanted, this would be the place to find it. Seems they also had quite a bit of vintage beers as well!\\n\\nThe menu items seem to be in almost constant rotation (just judging from the paper it was printed on!) so the items we saw in the restaurant didn't match what was advertised online, but some of them were just under different names/descriptions, like the shrimp and grits. We ordered the mac and cheese with asiago and pub cheddar and it was, no doubt, THE BEST mac and cheese I've ever had. I don't even know how to  put it into words. So gooey, so creamy, so tangy with cheddar and beer and asiago. Definitely a contender for best mac in Atlanta. Wow. After we topped that off, we ordered fish and chips and the brisket sandwich, both of which were delicious and paired perfectly with our brews. Quick note: I'm not really a beer person, so I just trusted the menu to guide my choice and it was awesome! I got a really nutty and rich beer with my fish and chips and it was awesome! My fiance got a sharper pale ale with his brisket; again, perfectly paired. \\n\\nIt wasn't crowded at 5 Points when we went, so we were able to park on the street, but I imagine parking may be more difficult during their busy hours.

It used to be known as Lan's Restaurant but the previous owner sold their business and new folks moved in and call it Saigon Pacific. I've been going to Lan's for years and the menu at the new joint is essentially the same but just a little smaller. Their Pho noodles are so so, I've had better but its not what they are known for. Go for their lemon grass chicken or lemon grass pork chop. The former can be ordered with rice or as an entree. The entree is what we usually get, $10.95 gets you 3 large chicken thighs that is well marinated and grilled to finish. The lemon grass pork chop is another fav dish of ours. Their roll dip is larger than most places and is reputed to be one of the best. Its filled with meat, seafood, some glass noodles and spices, deep fried and served with their sweetened fish sauce. I've been to quite a few Vietnamese places but their roll dip (spring rolls) are still the tastiest imho. On rainy days, I'll go for their curry chicken rice noodle soup.

A few of the dishes were both delicious and unusual--a super fresh scallop dish with pear and herbs, a salmon jawbone in chili sauce, a slow-roasted cod with wild mushrooms. Others were odd and less flavorful--a pork confit with tough skin on the top. Some were fine but just not that interesting--the final savory course was beef with beef tongue, and was good but unremarkable. Desserts didn't quite come together. Mine was a bland apple pancake with a bit of pine nut butter and goji berries. It was pretty doughy and tasteless.\\n\\nThe big disappointment, however, was the service. Throughout, our server was brusk, rushed, and mechanical. We asked her about a wine pairing for the tasting menu, and she wandered off without giving us a direct answer. We ended up paying more than we probably would have for a bottle for a couple of half carafes of wine because we didn't feel like navigating the extensive winelist without a guide. At the end of the meal, she did this robotic and strange \\"happy birthday\\" to my husband in exactly the same way, at three separate moments. \\n\\nWe wanted to feel a lot more coddled and cared for, on a special night when we were dropping $400+.

Love that depth in flavor. Flour is ... very floury and sweet. i guess it is very much tailored to the American palate, not bad but I'd prefer baking with more adventurous flavors. \\n\\nI'm a huge fan of quiche, and savory pastry. Flour is a fail in that category. The filling of the quiche I had at flour on multiple occasions are more of a curd consistency. Nothing close to the authentic Lorraine variety, which is my favorite. I doubt they blind bake the pie crust pastry as it is always awfully soggy and inedible. Recently being at a party where the host ordered a few of their quiches, which it's super nice to have warm and savory choices other than sweets all the way, I don't see one single person picked up a piece without making a mess (filling too runny and curd like, crust falls apart) and at the same time nearly no one ate the crust (or more of a mushy dough) which is a shame as a thin crispy pie crust can be so good.

We have all usually had great experiences there, at the restaurant in front of Marcus Cinema. We arrived around 12:15pm and waited half an hour to be seated even though more than half of the restaurant was empty. Nobody told us they'd be with us shortly or even acknowledged us. There was a couple also waiting that came in after us, and they had the same issue. When we got seated, the waitress just sat the menus on the table and walked away without saying anything or taking our drink orders. About ten minutes later we got to order our drinks. When the shakes got to us they were half melted. Mine was in a to-go cup (I had not ordered it to go, and the rest of the shakes were in glasses.), which means less shake, and that was disappointing. We also found that mine had a bunch of sprinkles and other sundae toppings stuck to the bottom of the cup, which oozed all over the table. One of my friends found that his shake had a substantial amount of fudge all over the side of the glass.

The main problem is that most of tables/stations are located in one room. Each table at Kobe is located in private room, which makes the experience better. Also, Nakato doesn't let you pick your steak. The menu will read steak and chicken, steak and shrimp, etc. As a rib-eye guy, I have a problem with being charged $20+ for either flank or NY strip. Kobe will have Rib-eye on the menu for about $18, or you can get Filet's, strip, etc., your choice. In addition, being a Sake fan, I found the Nakato sake was pretty expensive.

Pizzas I have had have been fantastic. The thin crust is always that right type of crispy want with the Italian style that allows the toppings to shine.

It has this perfect combination of spicy and savory from the little red peppers and spiced meat.\\n\\nValue (5/5) - The Pizza is a little bit more expensive than your standard carryout type place, but compared to other specialty or high quality pizza places it's right in line but everything else about it is so much better.\\n\\nEnjoyment (5/5) - Everything about this place is basically Gray.

We hav ordered some salads, breadsticks, soft drinks, mocktails etc. Here starts the movie, the lady who served us, goes by the name Liz, was very rude in serving. Very means \\"VERRRY\\", not just \\"very\\". She is just throwing the food on our faces, not at all gentle in serving.  And when we asked her to serve slowly, instead of apologizing she said \\"IF YOU DONT WANT TO PAY FOR THE FOOD, I CAN UNDERSTAND IT\\". I mean SERIOUSLY?! did she seriously say that? Is that the way a waitress talks to the customers? That's such a racist comment; we immediately complained to the manager Becca and she tried to mend the situation, assigned a different waitress for our table who was a very kind old lady. Also Becca was ready to waive off the bill for us, but after being insulted in such a way by Liz we weren't at all ready to accept the manager's courtesy offer. Even if we weren't insulted that way, why would we want to eat for free? We are not beggars, we have our own self respect. When we asked Liz for a second serve of Salads and Breadsticks, she acted as if she is doing us a favor (fyi the refills are free). I am not blaming the entire OG for such incidents but definitely such waitresses. BAD SERVICE WHEN IT COMES TO THE QUALITY OF FOOD (or) A MISTOOK ORDER CAN BE ACCEPTABLE, BUT HURTING PEOPLE'S FEELINGS BY MAKING RACIST COMMENTS AND COMMENTING ON THEIR FINANCIAL STATUS (which is none of their business) CAN NEVER BE JUSTIFIABLE. We even asked Liz to take her words back, but she was arrogant and rude to even acknowledge that. My best suggestion for OG is that they should train their employees more properly, they should give them situation based training, teach them how to act and what to say in different situations. Whatever she said was Unacceptable. She should always remember this very old and famous business rule that \\"Customer is God\\" whatsoever. \\n\\nOne star review to this OG branch bcoz Becca, The Manager, though she was kind to us, refused to reveal the real full name of Liz, she indeed told that her name is on the receipt and left the spot, but it isn't.\\""},{"name":"Rocco's Tacos & Tequila Bar","address":"7468 W Sand Lake Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Great atmosphere.

Still, you get a lot, and everything is very fairly priced. My braised pork shank was massive, and the meat fell effortlessly off the bone, but the flavor failed to pop for me. Same goes for the sweet potato mash in which the shank was nestled. The iceberg salad I had to start was similarly one note despite a litany of ingredients, and the tasso ham hushpuppies, while tasty, disappeared too quickly. I'm probably most disappointed that I was too full by the end of my less than impressive meal to have a slice of sweet potato pecan pie for dessert. In retrospect, I really should have gotten a slice to go. Oh well, we all make mistakes, and I might even be willing to give Estelle's another try to make up for theirs."},{"name":"Street","address":"3407 Greystone Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The wife and I spontaneously selected this place for our anniversary dinner.

My favorite BBQ in Texas. The meat has great flavor, but what separates them for me is the sides in particular the potato salad and coleslaw. Normally I pass on these two items any where else, how they're not your typical variety.  The Cole slaw isnt sitting in puddle of it's own milky juices getting all soggy, instead it's crisp an refreshing. Sesame seed and apple cider vinegar make for a more Asian take on coleslaw and its great. The potato salad is similar in that it defies your soggy potato salad pre conceived notions. Its got a hint of mustard and a tender but firm texture. The one side that's not amazing is the beans, they're just average.\\n\\nI also love their signature BBQ sauce, but be warned very high in fat but....if you're at salt lick, live a little and indulge.\\n\\nLastly, they still allow byob, but they also have their own brand of wine and name brand beers so no need to bring the cooler."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"We went to Craigie after hearing rave reviews from our friends who had their burger for brunch.

The tradition involved going out with my yoga classmates right after class to eat something bad for us.  The usual cuisine of choice was Mexican, but the tradition was also known to involve omelets, pancakes, veggie burgers and fries, gourmet chocolates, macaroni and cheese, chicken and cappuccino.  Since relocating back to Atlanta and finding a new yoga studio where my new classmates didn't really seem too into this post-yoga splurging, I abandoned tradition and always just drove straight home to eat whatever healthier food I had in the house.  Until today, that is.\\n\\nToday in yoga class, I was pretty proud of myself for even making it there since I was tired and maybe still feeling some of the residual alcohol in my system from the night before.  I have to tell you, I am probably not the ideal yogi; I often set my intention to just make it through class and I usually spend all of shavasana thinking about what I am going to eat after class.  Well, I did make it through class today and, since I was feeling pretty pleased with myself for this, I thought about the Irwin Street Market during shavasana - sort of a little treat.\\n\\nI had passed by the Irwin Street Market on my way to and from yoga class many times before but had never stopped, so I was excited to check it out today.  Six mini cupcakes and a grilled cheese later, I think I may have found my new post-yoga class tradition!  \\n\\nIt's a very comfy, cozy place.  There are several different vendors there each with their own little space.  I immediately headed toward the Sweet Pockets section where the cupcakes lived.\\n\\nSweet Pockets had eleven flavors of cupcakes on display and I chose to try six of them in the mini size.  I have only eaten two of them so far but they were very good - the strawberry wawa had a strawberry filling and strawberry buttercream frosting, and the cookies n' cream did taste just like cookies n' cream ice cream.\\n\\nAfter procuring my sweets, I ventured to the Delectables counter where they have soup and make sandwiches, salads and smoothies.  This is also where the Jake's ice cream is.  I saw a lot of things on the menu that sounded good but I settled on the Three Cheeses sandwich with the side of black bean salad.  The sandwich was basically a grilled cheese sandwich but with tomatoes and pesto (it said \\"basil\\" but I think that was the overly simplified version of it - it was pesto).  It was very tasty and I inhaled the whole thing.  I took it to go and one side of the sandwich (the pesto side) did get a little soggy, but I really think that would not have been the case if I had eaten it there.  The black bean salad was very good, too.\\n\\nWhile I was waiting for my food, I explored the store and also the little rooms where you can eat your food if you are dining in.  There were little tables spread throughout the rooms as well as sofas, chairs and books.  It looked like a really fun place to hang out, with food or also just with a coffee.  I also checked out several of the vendors and they had interesting things - fresh flowers as well as skin care and lots of little gift items, cards and candle-type things.  There was a fun variety of stuff to look at.\\n\\nSo, in conclusion, this is a fun little market with good food and it will soon become a regular post-yoga stop for me.  Old traditions die hard."},{"name":"Daisy Garden Restaurant ÈáëËèäÔøΩ?142 E Pender Street","address":"BC","city":"V6A 1T3","stars":"76","text":"2012/11/22 8:12"},{"name":"Reuben's Deli","address":"57 Broad St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I had read all of the yelp reviews of Reuben's before heading there for lunch today.

Both have their own in ground pits and staff.  We decided the eat at the newer side which used to be only for large parties for rental, but over the years became its own restaurant.  The seating capacity has doubled with new addition.  The outside waiting area has also been changed a little bit with an addition of a small stage and a person selling popcorn.  Truly this place is even more of a tourist site.\\n\\nFortunately the food has not changed and the service is still excellent.  However like all other restaurants the prices has gone up bit this is the new reality.  The brisket has always been a little dry for me and the sauce always did not go well for me.

Persons under 21 are not allowed near this place.  A county officer is present to make sure the rules are enforced. Unlike the restaurant next door this place does take credit cards. To taste wines it about $1 per tasting and the more expensive the wine the less they give you.

Like other Yelpers, I first found out about Flour Bakery from FoodTV's \\"Throwdown with Bobby Flay.\\"  In one episode, Bobby Flay challenges Joanne Chang to a \\"sticky bun throwdown.\\"  Joanne's sticky buns won, and I can understand why.  These buns are absolutely amazing!  The brioche bun is heavenly moist and soft.  Crushed pecans are added to the brioche before being rolled up and cut to pieces for baking, so that each bite contains that crunchy pecan goodness.  The caramel \\"goo\\" syrup covering the tops of each bun completes this savory sticky indulgence.  Whether or not you are a fan of sticky buns, Flour Bakery's sticky buns are a must try!\\n\\nAlthough Flour Bakery may now be famous for their sticky buns, they truly excel in other delightful treats.\\n\\nIf you are a fan of banana bread like I am, you must sink your teeth into Flour Bakery's moist banana bread filled with walnuts!\\n\\nThe cinnamon cream brioche is brioche topped with creme fraiche and cinnamon sugar.  It looks similar to a danish, but in no way does it compare to Flour Bakery's cinammon creame brioche.\\n\\nAlthough the brioche au chocolat may be my least favorite, it is still delicious.  I felt that the brioche was a bit dry and the ratio of brioche to chocolate was high.  Since I've only ordered this once, maybe I just got a \\"bad\\" one.  That said, I wll certainly give it another try.\\n\\nThe meringue cloud is a chewy airy sweet treat filled with chocolate or almonds.  Although I've had better meringue clouds, Flour Bakery does a very good job in making them.\\n\\nThe sandwiches are a bit pricey, but it is totally worth every thing you pay for.  The bread is seasoned with a blend of herbs and spices making every bite sensational.  Although I've only had one of their sandwiches (Roasted lamb, tomato chutney, and goat cheese), I am willing to bet that all of the other sandwiches are just as good or better.  The sandwiches I plan to try next are the \\"curried tuna salad, apples, carrots, golden raisins\\" and the \\"grilled portobello melt, pesto, mozzarella, and tomatos.\\"\\n\\nService (10/10) = The people who work here are full of energy and cheerful.  Their cheerfulness certainly goes a long way in terms of making the customers feel welcome, happy and satisfied.  If you really want to get sticky buns, you can call in ahead of time and have them hold some for you.  Actually, since the sticky buns are so popular, I suggest you do so.  The first time I went to Flour Bakery, they were sold out at 10 AM.  I was so disappointed, and did not have the time to wait for the next batch.  Before going back the second time, I made sure I would get my sticky buns by calling in to reserve some. \\n\\nAmbiance (9/10) = The place is very clean and spacious.  Tables are spaced out nicely and the baked goods are displayed beautifully.  I really like how their menu is written on a chalk board, giving the place somewhat of a homey and neighborhood friendly feeling.\\n\\nOverall Opinion = If I lived a lot closer to Flour Bakery, for sure I would get hella fat!  I just finished competing in a bodybuilding competition, and Flour Bakery is already doing a pretty good job of fattening me up.  This place is just absolutely amazing and I wish I could come here every morning for one or two baked pastries and a nice cup of hot coffee.  I also find it funny that there's an Au Bon Pain (ABP) around the corner.

It can get crowded, but the tables have room to navigate.\\nFor dinner try the vinegar popcorn as a starter- deliciously hot and light. The burger is best in town (according to my husband). Brunch is a must do as their biscuits are mouth watering and require no butter or jam to make them yummy, although the homemade strawberry jam is awesome. The pancakes are flavorful and filling, but don't leave you with the feeling you have an anvil in your stomach when you're done.

With 3000+ reviews for this place, I guess there is not much I can add, but here is my opinion.  The hype around this place makes it difficult to not expect perfection, and the drive  to get here will make you think, \\"This has got to be some amazing BBQ, because no one in their right mind would ever want to drive out here otherwise.\\"  Personally, I feel it's a bit overhyped, but it is still solid BBQ. Here is my breakdown:\\n\\nRibs: 4 stars- Good ribs.  Big, smoky, porky, succulent pig.  Only problem is you only get one on their 3 meat combo plate, which is not nearly enough.\\n\\nSausage: 4 stars- Nice bite on the outer casing, great flavor.  Nicely seasoned, great sausage.\\n\\nBrisket:  3 stars-  I am really picky about my brisket, and this was really a mixed bag.  Some bites were tender, moist, smoky with a great beef flavor.  But a lot of it was tough and bland.  I don't know why there was such variation but it was definitely a low point for me. Lockhart has spoiled me forever when it comes to brisket.\\n\\nSauce: 3 stars. This is probably just a matter of preference.  This sauce is completely unique, and not the traditional tomato based spicy Texas BBQ sauce I am used to.  It is more of a thin, yellow honey mustard sauce.  It is really pretty decent but it is not my favorite and because it is such a distinct taste it can overwhelm the flavor of the meats.\\n\\nSome final notes- I would order your sauce on the side to appreciate the meats on their own.  I would also be sure to get the Habenero sauce, as I thought it was tastier.  I personally don't feel like the sides should be taken into account when judging BBQ, but these were really awful. Dry potato salad, horrible beans, and mediocre slaw.  The homemade bread was a nice treat though.  In the end, this place is worth a stop at least once in your life."},{"name":"Omni Austin Hotel at Southpark","address":"4140 Governors Row","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"We were a little worried after seeing the bad reviews.

My excitement started to turn towards skepticism when I entered the restaurant and was bombarded with top-40 hip hop and EDM - it was completely out of place for a ramen place and reeked of trying too hard to appeal to hip young Allston residents. Still, ambiance doesn't matter nearly as much as food, so I put my reservations aside and ordered a bowl of Paitan ramen. \\n\\nThe meat was acceptable, but the rest of the soup was terrible. I quite enjoy the satisfyingly thick and chewy noodles that every other ramen restaurant in the area offers, and was rather surprised to discover that the noodles here were thin and comparatively mushy - especially odd given that this is the only ramen place I recall eating at where the menu explicitly states the noodles are cooked al dente. Instead of a rich and savory broth, I was presented with astoundingly bland and watery soup that offered little purpose aside from being a vessel for the other equally unimpressive ingredients. I have had ramen at six or seven different locations around the city and this was by far the least flavorful - and this is including places where ramen is just one offering on an extensive menu as opposed to what the place specializes in. The servers were friendly enough and the pork, as I've said, was acceptable so I'll give this place a charitable two stars, but you'd be better off eating ramen pretty much anywhere else ever.\\n\\nI also find it interesting that the latest two five star reviews - one of which does nothing short of fellating the place, and the other one being mostly an incredibly condescending rebuttal of a recent bad review - were written by Yelpers who only have that one review under their belts.

We had a bit of an error at the kiosk which allowed us to score 4 Fast Pass tickets for a ride or Haunted House of our choice. \\n\\nTo my surprise, the park was quite the opposite of Disneyland offering beer, cocktails and booze of all varieties everywhere. We opted for some Kamakaze shots out of a vial, then a blood bag full of red jello shots. You can purchase a souvenir glass for $10 and refills are $7. We had fun and drinks all night. \\n\\nYou can download apps for your phone that will show you the wait times for each ride and attraction, so we could easily pick our new haunts.  The first house was Penn and Teller's House since it had the shortest wait, then we were off to the next one and the next one. Some were just so long, almost 2 hours of waiting. Thank goodness the park stays open until 2 am. \\n\\nThey have costumed characters that roam around the park and scare you and it seemed that I had a target on my back.

My dad loves the place. I do not. The first time I found the food excessively rich and not particularly imaginative. Given the price it probably would have been between three and four stars. This particular review is for their New Year's dinner. Yes, it's a little late. I had other things to do. \\nSo here's the deal. New Years is pure bank for restaurants. They know exactly how many plates they will sell, they charge a premium, and people are generally in a good mood. It's a night to bring in the money: amateur night as we used to call it. \\nBut here's the problem. If you are going to charge  $160 a person you should be able to come up with a more original menu and enough food that your customers don't leave hungry. This ain't exactly cuisine minceur. So what the hell's the deal. So here's a small (pun intended) example: Sashimi of Hiramasa had, I kid you not, less than 1oz of fish (my guess would be 1/2); the prosciutto and chicory salad took advantage of it's being a salad to almost not be there; the scallop dish had...one scallop (not joking); the veal cheek rye gnocci were laughably devoid of veal cheeks (did you guys underestimate how many people were going to order it?). I literally could not find (or taste) any veal cheeks in the dish--and that pissed me off because I LOVE veal cheaks; the beef dish was no more than 2oz and completely uninspired in terms of flavors (I would have taken the halibut but that sounded uninspired as well and I wanted to taste the boudin blanc); the yuzu vacherin was the size of my rather small thumb and completely tasteless. \\nSo the food was completely utterly uninspired. OK, most people aren't going to be bothered by that. As I said, it's New Years. Nobody cares. \\nWhat I do care about, and what smacks of a deliberate attempt to abuse the consumer, is the fact that a $160 meal (that, for four people with tip was $1200--the most I have ever paid on one restaurant check!) left me not only vaguely hungry, literally clamoring for something to eat. I got home and made myself a large sandwich. The meal I just had at Zahav in Philly cost exactly 1/4 of what I spent at Craigie's and it was 100x more fun, interesting, flavorful, etc. \\nThe only thing I am grateful for is that I didn't take the wine pairing: for an extra $70 a person they were pairing wine and beer (yes) with each dish. The pours I saw were less than 2oz. So somewhere around 12oz of wine/beer for $70. So that would have been close to $300 for our table. I would expect at least two bottles + of wine for the table at that price. \\n\\nSo here's the reality. You are leaving people like me (and my dad, a regular customer) with a bitter taste in their mouth for a few extra dollars. Food and wine costs were not your primary expense. For a couple of thousand dollars, you would have left your customers satisfied and still have gotten that usual New Year's benefit. Those few dollars with have come back to you down the road in good feelings. Instead, you chose to rip your customers off and you lost me for ever, and I have serious doubts my dad will be back either--and that's some serious money right there. \\nLike I said, I have not found the food at Craigie's particularly interesting or good...just excessively rich. But to actually go out of your way to take advantage of people is no joke and they should be ashamed of yourselves for that."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"All I have to say is PHENOMENAL!! I surpised my husband here for dinner on his 30th birthday, and it was everything we imagined it would be and more. We had the first seating and when we arrived a few minutes early, the line was already out the door. We were seated after a few minutes (I highly recommend making a reservation). We were seated in the room to the left, which seemed to be a bit quieter than the room containing the bar. Our server was wonderful! She was friendly, attentive and guided us in all of our decisions.

I am not a huge fan of pork, and after letting the server know, the chef was able to accommodate all of my courses. It was an incredible meal! Our first course was three small bites consisting of octopus rillette, bass tartare, and razor neck clam. All were cool and refreshing with a nice taste. Our second course was Spanish mullet tartare on a walnut puree topped with chopped walnuts and pomegranate seeds. This course was sweet, salty and just delicious! Course 3 was seared blue fin tuna on a spinach puree, with crones, celery, and Manila clams. Words can't even describe how delicious this dish was, and all the flavors worked together wonderfully!  The fourth course was Pigs Blood whole wheat pasta with boudin noir pork ragout, which my husband loved. Since I preferred to not have pork, my fourth course was presented as Spacatelli with pea shoots, carrots and spring peas. I have to say, the pasta was some of the best homemade I have EVER had! Our fifth course was venison leg, matsuke mushroom, and baked apple, beet, pork and venison sausage. The venison was tender, slightly salty and cooked perfectly..slightly rare. Our intermezze was maple sorbet with oat crumble and olive oil, and was the perfect thing to cleanse our pallet before our final course was presented. Our dessert was served as mocha mousse with cocoa nibs, caramel ice cream, and chocolate cookie crumble- out of this world!!!

But, I could care less for the thick starchy fries. And the salad had too much frisee to my dismay (I HATE frisee). The dressing was pretty good. What else did I have? Oh yes, pig tails. Mmmmm. It's all about the sauce though. There's no reason to use pig tails, instead of any other type of meat. And we got a side of brussels sprouts roasted in duck fat. I LOVE brussels sprouts, and I also prefer my veges soft rather than crunchy, but these were way too soggy. I also could not distinguish anything different about roasting in duck fat.

I wished they used fresh garlic for the sauce though rather than bottled.  The music was great up until 11pm or so.  They mostly played salsa up to that point.  Around that time after we were done eating, one of the barmaids asked us we were going to buy the $30 shots or bottle, otherwise we had to give up our table.  I asked if we could just spend $30 on drinks of our choice and she said no. Bad attitude and service on her part.

Tacos were craved, and so it was to a place called Jimmy Hula's that I was brought to.\\n\\nThe very first thing I noticed was the sheer lack of parking at the establishment, in general.  Ultimately, we had to park in the adjacent Tilted Kilt's parking lot, leading me to wonder if we were going to get booted or get in some sort of trouble for it.\\n\\nEntering the restaurant is kind of like entering a Margaritaville or something, but way more relaxed, and mellow.  It's not the largest establishment there is, but there appeared to be a decent amount of seating, as well as a bar that could seat maybe like 8-10.\\n\\nOrdering is done at a counter to which the food is then brought to your given number.  At around $4 a taco, I did think they might have been a hair on the pricey side, but when the food arrived, and I saw just how stuffed the tortillas were, I could kind of justify the price.  I ordered a Voodoo (fish) and a Pipeline (pork), and they were both fully stuffed tacos.\\n\\nOverall, I found the quality of the tacos to be pretty much, three star quality.  They may have been stuffed to the gills, the amount of garnish kind of took away from the flavor of the proteins.  Especially in the Voodoo, where it was mostly taking bites out of lettuce and mango salsa with hints of warm fish.  Between the two tacos, the Pipeline Pork was the superior.\\n\\nThe queso was pretty good though, as Jimmy Hula's serves it thick.  I don't like quesos that are too souped down, and have a high risk of dripping all over you.  Positive points for this.\\n\\nBeer is cheap, and as an Atlanta resident, I like seeing that they serve Sweetwater.  There are times when I want to be adventurous and try new beers, and then there are days in which I just want something I know I like, and go with that.  It was the latter kind of day when I visited Jimmy Hula's, and I was glad to see Sweetwater on tap.\\n\\nOverall, three stars is pretty sufficient on how I felt about Jimmy Hula's.  The prices aren't egregious, the beer is comforting and cheap, and the food was just okay.  Bonus points that the car wasn't booted or towed next door.  It's however a comfortable setting, which there is something to be said about such, and I might not seek this place out again, but at the same time, I don't think I'd really object if someone driving decided to stop here either.

The modern African decor  is welcoming and was the perfect setting for a foray into Senegalese cuisine. The medium-sized menu includes about seven apps, three salads, and nine entrees. If you are a vegetarian or vegan, your options are few, and in fact there is not a single meatless entree on the menu. However, we had called ahead, and they assured us that they could prepare a few things without meat. Our waitress didn't know this, and had to go ask the chef. She was friendly, but we had to be a little insistent. \\n\\nThe food was good, except for the ubiquitous orange sauce. We started with the spring rolls, the grilled shrimp, and the fish rolls. The grilled shrimp was excellent except for the orange sauce drizzled over top, like Thousand Island dressing with cayenne. The sauce was somewhat disappointing because it's such an amateurish touch, a bit of Applebee's by way of Africa. The entrees were tasty as well; we had a huge stuffed lamb shank, a beef kebab, and a lamb stew minus the lamb. Generally speaking, the dishes were on the spicy side.\\n\\nTeranga is a lower priced option in a sea of over-priced restaurants. For four of us, with many drinks, the bill came to around $100.  It's nice to have a chance to go out in the South End and sit in a soothing atmosphere but then not have to pay through the nose for it. \\n\\nThe owners were there the whole time and were gracious and welcoming.

Secondly, for the price we were paying, the service was underwhelming. The hostess could not care less about hosting, and the waitstaff were mixing up the allergen options on the menu. Oh, and if you look younger than 30, they will probably just assume that you won't tip well and give you poor service because why would they take the time?

The Edgewater has a multitude of regular, devoted customers who come in again and again (we can count on seeing a good number of certain people a minimum of once a week) because they love our food.

I consistently hear great feedback on our delicious quesadillas and our *amazing* boneless sweet and sour wings.  Our traditional menu items (especially our Mega Burrito and Pulled Pork Burrito) are consistently well received.  In the mood for something a little less traditional?  Our chimichanga (easily our most popular dish) has a rich and creamy, slightly spicy white sauce on it instead of the red sauce that a lot of other places use.  Beef fan?  Our Carne Asada probably wins out for my personal favorite dish on the menu.  And, if you're in the mood for something new, our specials and soup selections are constantly changing; at the moment, we have some great salmon specials, and I'm really looking forward to our head chef bringing back some of his mouthwatering cold soup recipes in the summer (I'm obsessed with both the gazpacho and cold cucumber dill soups).\\n\\nAlso - don't forget to check out our weekday lunch menu for thick, juicy burgers, wraps and pizzas, along with most of the regular dinner items.\\n\\nIf you're still put off by some of the negative reviews, consider this idea: don't like too much cheese?

We carried out, and they did seem to wait until i got there maybe to slide it in the oven, but that wasn't an issue, it was probably less than 4 minutes from when I walked in to when I walked out, hot pie in hand. The atmosphere inside was busy, probably not the best place to take a group of 6 or more (group tables, as many have previously mentioned), but everyone was in a good mood and the place smelled amazing.

The whole pie was topped with some freshly julienned basil.\\n\\nWe picked up the slices, and the crust had that really good Neapolitan texture that you would expect. After folding it over and biting into it, the first thing that hit me was how well the crust held the heat on the ride over-about a ten minute drive, which led me to realize that tons of little bubbles were living in the crust, holding in all that nice warm air. Taking a bite, the flavors all just seemed to come together; the creaminess of the cheese paired very well with the salt in the sauce; the basil gave it that lift of freshness and the crust had the right amount of chewiness that you would expect from the development of the gluten. That pizza didn't stand a chance.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR: Miles above any commodity pizza, relatively quick service, excellent and well developed flavor, surprised it was in ATL and not the Northeast.

San shan soup I've not had before but the description sounded good and it was.  It was a soup with lots of pieces of chicken, egg, snow peas, and baby corn in it.  Yum.

In all my searching their were only two other restaurants I found that were more expensive than Cragie on Main but Cragie on Main had the best reviews I've ever seen so I choose that. I reserved a 9pm low top table and it was a beautiful corner booth. I think literarily the best seat in the house. We parked on the street and arrived 10 minutes early. The checkin woman seemed a bit overwhelmed with constant phone calls while also managing checkins. My only recommendation is that on holidays they might need one person dedicated to just phone calls. We sat down and ordered a cocktail and our waiter enthusiastically greeted us. He discussed the wine pairing menu to compliment our 5 course meal. I wasn't planning on it but we decided to try it for a change. The waiter didn't pressure us at all which was great. Each course was simply amazing and full of several flavors. There wasn't a single food item we didn't like. My only regret was getting the wine tasting as while I imagine any wine fans would love it, we would have been quite fine without it. Mostly, because we talked with each other all dinner so we were drinking very slowly and got back logged on glasses of wine. The night seemed to fly by, but I think that's because we were having such a great time as we realized we had actually been there for just over 3 hours after looking at the clock. The only real downside is the cost. At 300 for two people, plus 100 for wine tasting, plus 2 cocktails, plus 20% tip you can see how it adds up to potentially your most expensive dinner you may ever have.

That being said, I guess you wouldn't be surprised if I told you that this has remained as my go to dish!  Although I've remained loyal to that dish for the most part, there have been a few occasions that my curiosity has gotten the best me and that I tried their sushi as well as the Thai Noodle. No regrets there, the sushi was fresh, tightly rolled and reasonably priced.  \\n\\nThe Thai Noodles were among the best that I've had, it hit the spot for sure, could definitely order it every other visit.

One last thing to note they did have someone playing the piano (I think he came around 11:30) and it was really nice, not loud at all and we were sitting right next to the piano.

There isn't a lot of great ethnic food where I live so I wanted to find something exotic. When I said Pambiche to my friend, a Latina, she said \\"yes!\\" It's a large building, on the corner of a lively intersection, painted in bright pastels as if it was really in Palm Beach. We easily parked on the street and made our way over but the place was packed. As the weather was nice, the list for outside seating was very long and for inside seating only slightly shorter.\\n\\nWe probably waited 15-20 minutes and took a table inside. Though they look out on the patio, the inside seating just doesn't have quite the same appeal. But the service was quick and within minutes, we were sharing a mojito and snacks. The waitress was not terribly good with recommendations but we each found something good to order. My friend got a fish with a coconut sauce and I got a Cuban stew. Moments after getting our food, our neighbors got theirs -- a delectable looking garlic shrimp and avocado number that made us both gawk and say aloud with envy, \\"What's THAT?\\" \\n\\nNeedless to say, our food paled in comparison to what we could only imagine the shrimp and avocado dish was. Maybe it's because it was a hot night and I needed something more summery but the sweetish stew with root vegetables wasn't doing it for me. My friend wasn't knocked out by the fish either though it was moist and well-prepared. We made a decision on the spot to return for the shrimp. \\n\\nNext day, we came back for lunch. The shrimp dish is different at lunch. Not as many shrimp and you have to order the avocado on the side. It ends up being a bit spendy for lunch -- better to get this dish at dinner. But it did not disappoint, it was quite spectacular. Even more spectacular, however, were the happy hour dishes. Small portions of appetizers like cheese and spinach empanadas for $2-3.

You love them all but in different ways.  I like BBQ and while not being a fanatic I feel I've had my share.  Being in Austin for the Thanksgiving holiday what better way to prepare for a day of feasting than with an evening of .....feasting.  The Salt Lick is definitely worth the trip to the outer boondocks of Austin.\\n\\nFirst off be prepared, it is a cash only establishment, though with a thoughtfully placed ATM on site.  You don't need wads of cash though as the family-style, all-you-can eat dinner (ribs,brisket, sausage, beans, coleslaw and bread) is only going to set you back $20 per person.  It's also BYOB so you aren't going to get socked with a bar tab.  For your $20 you are amply supplied with platter after platter of very good BBQ served up by a friendly and attentive wait staff.\\n\\nI found all the meats to be very tasty although the \\"spicy\\" variety of sauce at the table was pretty calm.  The ribs were what you would expect from a seasoned pit - tender, juicy and full of smokey flavor.  The brisket was very good, not fatty and still tender.  The sausage while tasty was not outstanding.  Overall the experience was very good and as I mentioned earlier, well worth the trip.\\n\\nBe ready to wait to be seated but ample diversions from a Kid's Ranch to live music in the courtyard (not to mention your BYOB) makes the wait unnoticeable.\\n\\nI enjoyed the experience and would go back next time I hit Austin."},{"name":"Stone Soup Kitchen","address":"584 Woodward Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Stone Soup Kitchen is the cutest little restaurant with the cutest little name  in the cutest little neighborhood (Cabbagetown).\\n\\nThe food is made with fresh ingredients and love.

I guess because it's not inexpensive, and it's been getting lots of great press. WHen I read the \\"outstanding\\" reviews, I don't doubt those reviewers. But I also trust my own palate, and my knowledge of what is possible with the ingredients being used. So my conclusion is that this place must be inconsistent...because not only was my meal just not very good, neither was that of my dining partners. My vegan mushroom/walnut 'sausage' with beans and parsnips was meh...the parsnips were too-long-in-the-cold-storage chewy and floppy, just roasted and laid on top, clearly no one had tried them recently. I enjoy parsnips. I get that they can get that way, that's why I go to a fancy restaurant - to pay kinda big money to have top-notch produce well and inventively prepared. Or at least just well prepared. My friend ordered the hangar steak which was PERFECT; the sides that came with them were rye berry and rice, and sauteed kale with preserved lemon, both I was excited to try/eat off my friend's plate...I LOVE kale in many, many forms, I LOVE grains both hot and cold, and yet these were just not good, neither of them. It was almost shocking to me. There was no flavor at all to the rye pilaf, not the slightest speck of rye flavor, the kale was disappointing.....it was just an odd shamble of mostly disappointing tastes and flavors. Combined with the odd presentation of some dishes (ie a grape 'pudding' that literally looked like something I used to make in 2nd grade, with apple slices stuck in and a limp piece of lettuce on the side - and not an adorable trendyperky little lettuce leaf, c'mon! You were highlighting the lettuce farmer that night, this was not a stellar presentation!) \\nI feel kind of like a bad person for even writing this. I love everything about what the restaurant represents (well, maybe its a little overly pretentious in some areas but that's par for the course), the local food focus, the intimate space itself is both lovely and adorable with awesome decor, the staff seemed like really nice people, eager to please and quite knowledgeable, the service at some points was verrrrrrry slowwww, and in the wrong places (ie, not well paced if that was the intention) but I get that can be hard to manage. I just feel SO disappointed. So, I'm chalking it up to them really and truly taking local/seasonal fare to heart. Because our meal felt exactly like what a New England household during Colonial times would have been like - end-of-winter veggies that have lost their luster, pasta that kind of just sits in the bowl like it was dished out from a cafeteria line, the make-do scrappiness of trying to get a meal on the table and just waiting it out for springtime when we'll all wake from our winter turpitude and care about what we eat again. (that steak though, stellar. But non-meat eaters---huge disappointment) ONE EXCEPTION: the more classic desserts were well made and really delicious. So was the non-alcoholic cocktail. \\n\\nI actually agree more with the 2 star rating, but feel so guilty I just threw an extra star in there to feel better about myself. If it weren't kind of a pricey place I would go back during a different season, and give them another try. But, there are a number of consistently really good farm-to-table restaurants in this area in the same price range that pay more attention to the flavors of their vegetable dishes, so I probably won't take a chance on this one again.

So, we get there and check in with the host. This place was packed. The tables are pretty close together so if personal space is your thing this may not be the place for you. When the yelp app alerted me my table was ready it actually was! Technology gotta love it. I ordered the shrimp and grits and OMG they were amazing! None of that tail on shrimp laziness. Tons of shrimp mixed in with creamy grits and spicy, creamy sauce of goodness. Needless to say I killed it. The wife had the salmon croquettes. They were good too but a little heavy on the breading. We got a waffle to split because why not end breakfast with a little dessert? The waffle was so good! It comes dusted with powdered sugar and a dollop of butter. The flavor of that waffle was amazing. The only thing that wasn't exciting were the scrambled eggs with cheese.

We drove by in times past without noticing Black Cat until Yelp friends Sherry S, Douglas C and Sandra W wrote reviews to tip me off to the Latin food delights, welcoming interior and friendly service.  Open for lunch now and a convenient stop in traveling from Portland to Bend, we went in to find we were the only two diners in the place for the entire hour we were there.  Have to wonder what's up with that for this top notch place.  If it were in Portland proper rather than the cusp of Gresham it might be full of people.  We loved lunch and sometime when we're back in the area we will be eager to try dinner.  \\n\\nMENU / PRICES\\nThe two sided lunch menu is abbreviated from the larger dinner menu and some items find a different format at lunch.  As example mole enchiladas at dinner are mole sandwich at lunch.  Prices run from about $6 for appetizers to $10 for lunch entrees.  Not only are prices reasonable, the serving sizes are very generous.  We had leftovers to take away and reheat at home.  We wanted to save room for dessert, all made in house by the talented chef and only $6 to $8 in price.\\n\\nFOOD\\nThere are probably as many mole poblano negros as there are Abuelas and the version made by the chef here was delicious.  A perfect balance of toasted chiles, chocolate and maybe a touch more pronounced in cinnamon flavors than some others. It  had the kind of subtle chile heat that makes your temperature rise as you eat it and as a big fan of moles, I mean that as high praise.  Offered on the menu as sandwich filling, I asked if I could get tortillas instead and the kitchen was happy to oblige with the mole served in a bowl and a basket of tortillas to let me \\"roll my own\\".\\n\\nThe tortillas were so good, a bit yellower and coarser textured than most.  I asked the server if they were house-made and was almost disappointed to have him answer that they were.  Had they been purchased elsewhere I would have been wanting to know where so I could buy them in bulk to take home.  Excellent.\\n\\nMy husband was delighted with his choice of braised and shredded pork tacos (de Conchinita)  in a spicy and barely sweet sauce similar to barbecue and with pickled red onion.  Three to the order, they were served with a green habanero salsa on the side.  The server cautioned restraint with the habanero salsa and good thing hubby took the advice seriously.  Wonderful salsa but even for a heat seeking demon like my spouse, a little was enough.\\n\\nBlack bean and chorizo soup is available by the bowl and only two bucks if ordered with an entr√©e.  We shared a bowl of this soup and it was outstanding for Latin flavors and seemed to have just a hint of lime and a sprinkle of cilantro stems on top, in sort of Cuban fashion.\\n\\nWe opted for two of the house-made desserts.  One to share there, a key lime pie that was delicious and served on a graham cracker and ground nut crust, and  Alfajores, Peruvian cookie sandwiched with dulce de leche, to take home.  Comparing the cookies to those at Andina, which may be the best Alfajores we've ever  had, these were bulkier and less our preference.  There was also a unique panna cotta on the menu served with caramelized peanuts and a dense chocolate cake served with vanilla bean ice cream, both of which would be options for us next time.\\n\\nVALUE\\nLunch for two including two entrees, a bowl of soup and two desserts was under $35, with enough to take away to be dinner that evening.  Great value.\\n\\nSERVICE / AMBIANCE\\nService was top notch.  The server knew the menu, could answer questions and make recommendations and extended warm hospitality to make us feel like welcome guests. Charming.  The ambiance is bright and sparkling clean with a fountain in the middle of the room and theme appropriate Latin music on the sound system at the right level to support conversation. Seating at booths or standard height tables.  Lovely. \\n\\nTHIS N THAT:\\n\\n1) ACCESSIBILITY:  Accessible parking.  Level in entry and throughout.  Lots of standard height table seating. \\n\\n2) PARKING:  Large lot with more than ample parking.  Try finding that in Portland restaurants!  \\n\\nWhat are you waiting for to try this place?

We came during the week, so it wasn't that busy nor was parking a big issue.  However, I have seen how terrible the parking can be on the weekend.  Valet parking is available, but basically your car will end up on either side of a small street.  Creates a big hassle.

I took a bit of time for our servers (yes, we had two) to get to us, but throughout the night they did a wonderful job.  They were very attentive.\\n\\nOn to the food.  You can order tapas or plates here. I opted for the tapas.  I ordered 1) papas bravas 2) hanger steak and 3) asparagus.  The potatoes were pretty good- you don't get as many as you would get at Eclipse di Luna though.  The hanger steak was good, but was a small portion, and I very much disliked their black truffle sauce.  The asparagus was \\"hairy.\\"  You know...when they grill and the tips get fuzzy.  Apparently, people like it that way...my friend tells me so, at least.  I am not one of those people.  I cut off all the tops and gave them to her.  \\n\\nWe also tried out some dessert- the crepes.

I got the soup & half sandwich special - short rib sandwich & lobster bisque. The sandwich was alright, but the lobster bisque was simply awful. It tasted off, slightly sour as if it went bad and it smelled funny. I had three spoonfuls of it before I decided it was probably not a good idea to continue eating it. The food did not impress me and I left disappointed. \\n\\nThe second time I came here was about a month later, and this time it was the service that was bad. Granted, it was a busy Saturday night around dinner hour, but I was appalled by this experience. The BF had ordered a beer right when we sat down, which never came. We were also not given bread & butter, and every other table was given it...which generally would not bother me, but in the grand scheme of things I was not pleased with our service that night. Our server essentially showed up to take our order, checked in with us once while walking by, and returned with the bill at the end of the meal. Which by the way, had the charge for the beer that was never brought out. When we tried to flag him down to remove the charge, he was no where to be found and we had to get another waitress after waiting for five minutes.

Nothing special. \\n-Bistec De Pollo Empanizado $10.92: this was my lunch entree. Generous portion. This lightly breaded chicken filet came with yellow rice, beans, and fried plantains. The star of the entree, the chicken, was not flavorful. It was very bland. I asked the server for a sauce to accompany it, but she suggested the Creole Cuban sauce, which was meh.  An okay entree. \\n-Arroz Imperial $13.25: my sister got this as her entree. Yellow rice stuffed with shredded chicken topped with cheese and served with a house salad and tostones. This dish was better than mine. The main focus of the entree, the rice imperial, shined. The house salad was a spring mix topped with strawberries and feta cheese. It was served with a strawberry vinaigrette dressing, which was delish. The tostones was okay-- had a sauce to dip it with. \\n\\nSERVICE: We were greeted with smiles entering and when being seated. After our order was taken, no one came to check on us to see if we wanted refills or anything. I literally had to wave down a server 3 times during my experience. Yes, that's to get to-go boxes and the check as well. It wasn't too busy; about 4 other tables.

Since then, the entire Universal Resort has changed, and it's much, much better. LOVE the new parking garages and walkways leading to CityWalk. Universal Studios has updated many rides, added lots of new attractions, but still falls short of the magic and fun of Islands of Adventure or Disney's Magic Kingdom.\\nOne huge upside for me- the last time I was at the park, there were about 6 rides, all of which had a minimum one hour wait. There are now about twice the rides, and the longest I waited in line was 30 minutes for the Disaster! ride. AWESOME.\\nWas bummed they replaced Back To The Future, but The Simpsons ride was a lot of fun, and it was cool to check out the Kwik-E-Mart next door. They still have the DeLorean and Time Train from BTTF on display, and time it right and you can meet Doc Brown! Twister is fun, but not overly amazing. The Mummy ride is AWESOME. The Rock 'N Roll Roller Coaster is the fastest, most fun ride in the park, hands down. T3 Show- excellent. ET and Jaws? The only two rides remaining from the original- still fun. Earthquake has been revamped and renamed to Disaster! Fun exhibit, although a lot of the scariness has been taken out of the ride itself. Jimmy Neutron and Shrek 4d are also a lot of fun for both kids and adults.\\nOverall, I was very happy to visit Universal, since it had been so long since I had last been. The wait lines were hardly anything like they used to be, so I actually got to hit virtually every ride in a half a day. Lots of shops, restaurants, and shows available for kids and adults. Look for tons of characters walking around to sign autographs and take pictures. I met The Simpsons, Doc Brown, Scooby Doo, and Spongebob Squarepants without even looking! If you're a Florida resident- try buying your tickets online and get a huge discount, or go for the annual pass for only 150 bucks. Will pay for itself the second visit! I had a lot of fun, but for me this park simply didn't measure up to Islands of Adventure or Disney's Magic Kingdom. I recommend buying the park hopper pass, so you can do both parks, or at the very least stay for a weekend, and spend a day at each park and hang at CityWalk, so you can take in everything Universal Resort has to offer. I'm definitely not a hardcore Universal guy, but I enjoyed myself and since I have the annual pass will definitely be back, although I will spend more time at Islands than Universal."},{"name":"Counter Culture Frozen Yogurt","address":"6705 W US Hwy 290, Ste 610","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"The best yogurt I have had in Austin.

Nothing notable. \\n\\nFood: the charcuterie plate components are tasty and in decent supply. The fig jam was delicious,  as was the bread and the cured meats.\\n\\n My wife and I ordered mussels and a spaghetti dish to share. The pasta was fresh, I think their pastas are made in-house, but the clams in the spaghetti were few and far between.  Maybe a total of six in the entire dish. However,  let's give this plate the benefit of a one-time mishap and not count the missing parts against it. The benefit given, I cannot understand why the dish was drowned in oil. \\n\\nThe mussel appetizer came with most mussels intact and surrounded by buttery broth which made a great dipping sauce for the bread. The dish is not unique in any way, but is a good value.\\n\\nA separate note on bread is necessary.  There needs to be more bread served with the charcuterie and with any dipping dishes. There is nothing more discouraging to a diner than having to ask for more bread over and over, while watching the dippables and spreadables get stale. With the margins which restaurants charge on alcohol,  ordering one beer will cover unlimited bread for the evening for even the most indulgent. \\n\\nOverall: this place is fine. Nothing special at all. \\n\\nSuggestions: the name is Salty Pig. Run with the pork theme! Put pork shoulder or pork knuckle on the menu.

We have made our reservation with open table, specifically mentioned that there would be two adults and a baby and asked for a spacious area. From looking at their photos, we thought it was a high end restaurant where people would enjoy wine quietly but we were wrong. Okay this is totally fine. Count that in as our mistake. It was my birthday and I felt like I was being treated like a dog. We had a reservation at 5pm and arrived there early so we sat on the right side of the entrance waiting while reading the menus. The lady at the front door confirmed our reservation and asked us if we were going to keep the stroller with us and we said yes and she said it was fine and just wanted to see where she could fit us in. She then asked us to move to the left side of the entrance where we could hardly fit in the stroller. We asked to be seated inside instead because it was windy and chilly but she said she could turn on the heat for us. I mean how do u keep the wind out with the heater? Is the heater a new tech from CES? Then we tried another person after a minute who helped taking reservations and he said he couldn't fine my name on the reservations list, so he had to talk to her. After the talk, she said to me \\"oh, so you don't want to sit there anymore\\" I was thinking quietly \\"hey, we never wanted to sit there, u pushed us to that corner. The smallest area in the entire restaurant!!\\" Even the right side was more spacious. We were then taken to the far end of the restaurant which was so much better. She even asked us if we could finish before 7:15pm because that was when the next reservation was. I was thinking quietly again \\"we would finish before 6pm\\" and we did. (for people who have babies must know that we are lucky if we can sit for more than 45mins) The food was top class I have to say but the service was terrible. We are Asians with a baby. I am not sure if Chambar had discrimination against people other than Caucasians or if it had discrimination against the baby. If Chambar does not welcome babies, please specify this clearly on open table or upon reservation or Chambar could have phoned me and at least make up some excuses so we could find somewhere else to eat. I would give this restaurant a second chance next time without the baby but my husband was very mad that he said he would unlikely to go back to the restaurant because it ruined my birthday. The restaurant probably doesn't care but think about the reputation this lady has ruined. There are lots of rich Asians in Vancouver who enjoys wine and alcohol. I hope this review serves as a warning for Chambar to give the service a second thought -- key to translate Chambar into a bigger business. Food 5 & Service -3. Please work hard to bring service to a 5 star level and thanks for the miserable experience. It will probably help us give a second thought on our next reservation with another restaurant.

Cheapest omakase I've ever had too. \\n\\nI seriously went back and forth on whether to write this review or not. The reason not being I didn't enjoy my dining experience, but rather the opposite! I thoroughly enjoyed the food so much that I had to come back the next day! It's the best kept secret for one of a kind sushi experience. \\n\\nKappo only has 8 seats so plan accordingly. So if they open at 11, you should get there 30 mins to an hour earlier. Our first time there was on a Friday night. We were driving from Tampa and we didn't get there until 4:15 and they graciously sat us even though they were about to close to prep for their omakase dinners. About their omakase dinners, you can only make reservations through their website. Unfortunately, they are booked solid until March. There is no phone number so you can't even call them, but when you are there you'll see why. \\n\\nNow onto the food and dining experience. Kappo is like a popup restaurant within East End Market. East End Market has a community kitchen in addition to the community garden where they grow produce used in their food etc. The kitchen is for prepping items that require an oven etc otherwise, everything was made at Kappo's shop.\\n\\nJen, the pastry chef who trained in London sat us and gave us the daily menu. Each day there is a different menu dependent on what fish or item is fresh that day. Luckily uni also known as sea urchin is always in abundance! Mark and Lo are the sushi/food chefs. Backstory on Mark, Lo and Jen is that they all met at the University of Florida and have been friends ever since. \\n\\nThis isn't your typical sushi restaurant with California rolls or lots of maki rolls so don't come thinking you can get a Volcano or Philly roll here because you won't. There are only about 15-20 items in total each day. Omakase 8-10 piece selection is available everyday and very reasonably priced compared to other omakase I've had at other places. Omakase for $39 is a great deal! Now if you are wondering what omakase means, it is translated to 'Chef's choice\\". Meaning you leave it up to the chef to concoct whatever dishes. With omakase, you aren't only paying for the sushi, but also the experience. There is no rushing when it comes to omakase. Order sake or beer then sit back and watch Mark, Lo and Jen get to work.\\n\\nWe wanted to get the full experience so we ordered a few items in addition to the omakase. We ordered the scallop uni truffle, a 1/2 dozen skookum oysters, 1/2 dozen Kumamoto oysters, and Foie gras of the sea. The oysters were deliciously dressed 3 or 4 different ways, but my favorite was the kumamoto oysters. The foie gras of the sea wasn't really foie gras though. It was actually monkfish liver hence the phrase, \\"fish of the sea.\\" The monkfish was good, but I would have preferred real foie gras! Now the scallop uni truffle was amazing!!! There was so many elements within each bite. Uni is one of those sushi items that you would never order from a place where it's usually not busy because it's probably not fresh. In Kappo's case, however, that's not a problem because they incorporate uni in a lot of dishes. \\n\\nOmakase! Let's talk about that..Have you ever watched an artist at work? Well that's how it felt while we watched Mark do his thing. His body movements as he sliced, diced, or torched and prepared each dish was rhythmic like. Every piece or item he made was like, WHOA! We were served three different uni's-japanese uni, Maine uni and Santa Barbara uni. My favorite has probably got to be the Japanese uni. Oh I forgot we also ordered a chirashi bowl. I would rename it the whole kitchen sink bowl because there were so many items in it from salmon roe, uni etc.  It was very filling and thank goodness we saved that for the end. \\n\\nDessert-Jen's turn to impress us. We had starfruit sorbet with meringue I believe. It had nice tartness from the starfruit. The next day we came, we were given three different flavors of ice cream. Black sesame ice cream was my favorite of all. \\n\\nEverything was so good that I didn't want the meal to end. Did I eye my sister's and other's sushi in case they didn't want it, maybe:)\\n\\nSo after reading this review and you aren't rushing to eat here then you are seriously missing out! I'm already thinking of making plans to go back for their omakase dinner."},{"name":"All Asia Bar","address":"334 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"Good prices on drinks.\\n\\nA bunch of wacked out drugheads."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"some local family members recommend the salt lick while we're visiting. we got there around 8pm so there was no line. food came out quick. bbq was ok. tasted like bbq i can get at home. sides were only ok too. portions were good sized. the most delicious thing i ate was the peach cobbler. it was 5 stars delish!"},{"name":"Barcelona Inman Park","address":"240 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"A 5 star rating is few and far between in my book, but Barcelona may be a new favorite in my world of Atlanta foodie goodness.

Let's start with the service. The people who work here are fantastic. The servers know their food, beers, and wines.  This is no easy task with the wines and beers continually evolving with new and unique options. If you ever need help figuring out what goes well together, they will be able to help. Or if you need more specifics about a dish, they are always more than happy to provide more information. Most of all, you can tell that everyone really enjoys working there. For me, that is what makes the dining experience so enjoyable.\\n\\nFood- The menu is superb. You truly can't go wrong no matter what you decide to go with. A huge reason why is that the restaurant go to great lengths to insure their seafood is as fresh as possible. The raw bar always has a great list of oysters, crudos, ceviches, and more. My personal favorites include the Tuna and Fluke ceviches. The kitchen is also packing a punch from starters to desserts. One thing they do better than anyone else is the smoked seafood. People usually skip over this part of the menu, but that would be a big mistake. The options are incredibly unique and flavorful. Personally, I am in love with the smoked bluefish p√¢t√©. Other must haves on this menu include the lettuce cups, cornbread, any fish entr√©e (just had the Hake last night and I was blown away), broccoli raab, mushroom casserole, and the butterscotch pudding.

No one else in Boston has a beer list with as much diversity, quality, and uniqueness as Row 34. They sport phenomenal local breweries like Trillium (located next door) and bring in other incredible beers from around the world.

The tiniest piece of cheese you've ever seen on a plate.  Or 5 tiny slices of house-make Chorizo (which was tasty, but not nearly as flavorful as the chorizo I can buy in most of the better local supermarkets).\\n4) they act like crostini are made of gold and that four pieces, for a table of four people, is enough - even though you've ordered 4-5 dishes that should come with it.  We are talking about slices of french bread with the tiniest bit of olive oil.  Don't be stingy on something this cheap.  I don't want to eat pate, jams, or cheese directly with a spoon until I am somehow satiated.\\n\\nI love the idea of this place, but they need to step it up on all of the above."},{"name":"Sea Thai","address":"3812 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"On my first visit, got chicken Pad Thai to go.

I got the beef steak kebab with basmati rice and hummus. My dining companion had some sort of stewed lamb shank with herbed rice and lima beans.

Shelved to the left were an array of homemade soups and drinks, giving Stone Soup a Mom and Pop elan. Dining tables align the right wall. I shimmied into a tiny booth with the grace of a water balloon being pushed through a banister. What a sight I was! The waiter, patient and lumberjack-ish, recommended a few items, but I found myself distracted. He need only place himself on the menu and I'd never endure another Kashi sunrise again! Careful deliberation led to a breakfast sandwich of gently scrambled eggs, jack cheese, and Canadian bacon on a honey wheat English muffin. So, yes, I pretty much ordered an Egg McMuffin, the difference being that at Stone Soup I wasn't also funding an evil clown. \\n\\nPeople, that sandwich was a MARVEL! You'd never think a mere egg concoction could achieve nirvana. No diminishing returns, each bite trumped the last. Pearls of butter and cheese cascaded down my chin and congealed upon my windbreaker.

I would like to say it is more like a 3.5. I have been living in Canal for about 3 years now and my boyfriend and I decided to treat ourselves to a night out. We remembered seeing this place a couple times when we went to pick out cupcakes at Fantasy Cupcake. We thought it looked like a nice upscale place to eat in a small quiet town. We parked around back and entered through the back way. It was a little confusing to find the the hostess stand because we did not see the hostess. The stand was a tiny desk on the other side of the room with no one at it. We waited for about five minutes for the hostess to appear and to greet us. Granted it was busy and a Saturday, but I feel it did take awhile to be greeted and have our names taken down. We could have left within that five minute wait. Once we got our names taken we walked around and looked at the wine selection. My boyfriend was impressed with the selection and said that prices were not too terrible. We waited for about 30 minutes for a seat. Within that 30 minutes we overheard a couple that entered after us talking about leaving because they were never greeted and they stood there waiting for about 15 minutes. Not a great first impression in my book. Now...on to the food. AMAZING. I am so glad we waited! Like one person said before, I am not sure they know how good their food really is! My boyfriend ate the salmon and he kept raving that it was the best he ever ate. Our server was very helpful and pleasant. She joked with us and made us feel welcomed. I was not impressed with the decor and this goes into my rating as well. It was like they wanted to be upscale, but just were not there yet. The pictures blended in with the wall color and it was just very...blah. I liked the separate eating areas. The one by the bar seemed very family friendly and the one in the room seemed more romantic. The menus were very amateur. They were print outs from the website.

Therefore, what is about to be said in this review applies only to this particular Burger Tex on Airport Blvd. \\n\\nThis is the only Burger Tex that I have ever visited where I had a bad experience. First off, the burgers do not taste like those at the other locations. For one, they're saltier and greasier. I ate my burger at 2:PM and it was so salty that I still feel dehydrated. The prices are the same as the other locations, but the quality is so much worse that the burgers seem overpriced. \\n\\nThe absolute worst part about this location is the Korean manager/owner/man running the show. He takes orders at the register is openly rude and speaks very bad English. When I asked a simple question about the menu (\\"Is the portabella mushroom burger a beef burger with mushrooms or one big mushroom?\\") he responded very abrasively by loudly demanding which burger I wanted to order. While I was waiting for my order, I heard him berating his employees, but I couldn't understand the reason. \\n\\nAlso, THIS PLACE DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO SPLIT BURGERS WITH SOMEONE ELSE WITHOUT PAYING EXTRA. There is a sign next to the register that states this, as well as other reviewers of this place that show this.\\n\\nTo give you some visual evidence of how this man thinks, I have included pictures of the signs he posts at the register.\\n\\nMost burger restaurants, especially in Austin, are friendly, but not this place.

It's just a pity my wallet and my waistline can't afford to go there more often. My memories of my first meal there are excellent ones, but vague, so I'll just focus on last night's meal.\\n\\nIt was my boyfriend's birthday. We wanted to have the pig's head for two, so I made sure to specify that when I made the OpenTable reservation. A couple of days before our reservation (they were closed the day before), I got a call to confirm, and the person I spoke to said that they had the pig's head in stock, but that she'd double-check the day of, to make sure we'd get what we wanted. She did indeed call back the afternoon of our reservation to say that yes, they had it. Nice!\\n\\nAlthough we wanted a nice cozy table for two to celebrate his birthday, both my boyfriend and I were intrigued by the idea of coming back sometime to sit at the counter surrounding the open kitchen, whose high energy and beautifully controlled chaos were attractive and exciting.\\n\\nThe waitress who served us was already aware of our desire for the pig's head, and immediately recommended the pig's tails as an appetizer. Granted, that sounded like Too Much Pig (and technically, it really was), but we couldn't resist the idea of literal nose-to-tail (or vice-versa) dining. We also got a riesling as recommended by the waitress. The bread that came to us shortly before the appetizer was good--made by Iggy's--but not anything to rave about. The pig tails were crispy on the outside, tender-fatty on the inside. They were perfectly accented by the nuoc cham, peanuts, and cilantro, which added an exotic note and a brightness to the rich meat and made it sing. The riesling did, indeed, pair perfectly with the richness of the pork and the southeast Asian flavors. \\n\\nThen came Mr. Pig. Please note--this is actually HALF a pig's head, not a whole one. It does not include tongue or brains, but does include an eyeball. It was accompanied by little pancakes (as for Peking duck), a boudin noir-hoisin sauce, and a pumpkin sambal, which was basically a salad of bean sprouts and pumpkin and herbs with toasted sesame oil and chili. My boyfriend took the first crisp square of scored pig skin, and I knew instantly I'd brought him to the right place. It was pork heaven. The meat was impossibly tender. The fat was meltingly soft and luscious. I'm someone who generally hates the texture of fat on meat, but this all seemed to blend into this sumptuous deliciousness that was irresistible. The skin was not at all tough or hard to chew, but was crisp and crackling like well-cooked bacon. So was the ear. I offered my boyfriend the snout, because it's a fairly cartilagenous piece, and I don't like that texture. He enjoyed it. We split the eyeball. After all that cooking, you couldn't really distinguish its texture from that of the meat and fat around it. The flavor was somewhat metallic, not unlike liver. Not at all unpleasant. The waitress was impressed with our fearless and enthusiastic deconstruction of Mr. Pig.\\n\\nDessert was whole wheat crepes with Macoun apples and butternut ice cream. The nuttiness of the whole wheat flour was perfect with the sweet apples, and the butternut ice cream had a wonderful salted-caramel note to it that tied everything together beautifully. It was autumn on a plate, complete with the ice cream as a farewell to summer. Delicious. When she brought the check, the waitress also brought a couple of nuggets of almonds held together by milk chocolate, a delicious last bite.\\n\\nThe service was wonderful. The waitress was extremely knowledgeable and attentive, and much more approachable than the staff in some other fine dining establishments. Her enthusiasm for the food and drink was obvious in how she described it, and she seemed genuinely happy about the pleasure we took in our meal. The energy of the place just seemed perfect. I felt like I was in a place where everyone and everything was working beautifully together. That sort of thing come through in the overall atmosphere of a restaurant, and can make the difference between a good experience and a great one. I look forward to coming back here again, to taste some of the other magical-sounding non-pork-related dishes."},{"name":"Taqueria Villanueva","address":"281 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I moved to Portland from Phoenix, Arizona.

We tried the cod fish croquettes once and they were a bit soggy for our taste but that's just us. If you are in the mood, the mango milk shake is  very good and I don't doubt lots of calories but enjoyable both as a drink and a dessert. \\n\\nDon't really have much familiarity with Cuban cuisine but the sides that come with the entree are also very complementary - by this, I mean a nice blend of salad crunch with the small amount of cabbage slaw and also, on some dishes - some lightly pickled beets. These typically bring just the right amount of acidity to the dish making the whole dish very tasty and thoughtfully put together.\\n\\nA few days ago, I ordered the stewed pork that comes with black beans and white rice and the sides noted above.

This was my first visit to the Winter Park location. The strip mall location is very well done on the inside. I got a couple of my favorite entrees to go (as I typically do at Indian restaurants). I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and Paneer Korma. The chicken tikka masala was below average, but edible. The Paneer Korma was not. I tried to eat some of it, but I ended up throwing it all away. I don't know how else to describe the bad flavor, but that it tasted old. The 3 pieces of paneer that were in it were tough and chewy and the sauce itself tasted very bad.

By the third piece, it was killed twice.  The asparagus was hard and tasteless.  The string beans were basically ok.  I returned the chicken dish.  Now waiting for a substitute.  The substitute was decent. By the way the way waiter's name was Greg.  The waitress was cold. The manager passed by to take the dish back but was in her own world.

No waiting for your name to come up here as usually the Karaoke VJ is the only one bold enough to sing. \\n\\nI don't ever order food here, but my friends do and they seem to like it.(Then again they're all college aged!) But the Pearl does nickel and dime you for things like a little ranch which you would think would come standard with chicken or mozzarella sticks. I don't really know who goes to a bar for the food.

So how does it stack up (more on that in a minute)?\\n\\nFood: I've been twice and have enjoyed everything on the menu my wife, friends, and I have ordered.  The burger, fries, popcorn, pretzels, hush puppies, fish n' chips, and reuben sandwich are all VERY tasty.  A friend got the mussels and was a little disappointed with the portion size.  That being said, our opinion on mussels portion size was based on our trip to Belgium in 2008 where they give you a pretty massive portion for like 15 euros.  Since the mussels are an appetizer and it's the US, the size is probably right on.  I did think the fish for the fish n' chips could have been a littler bigger though.\\n\\nDecor: Not overly or under impressive.  It feels like a cool place to hang out at with friends, so it gets props form me.  Make sure you head to the back where there is more seating.\\n\\nBeer: Any place that has La Chouffe on tap gets an A+ in my book.  A good selection of micro, Belgium, and other beers in both tap and bottles.  The prices are also reasonable.  They serve many of the beers in the proper glassware, but not all.\\n\\nService: LIke the decor, I'm not overly or under impressed.  I've had good quality service both times I've been.  My beer glass rarely sat empty and our servers were nice and prompt.  This isn't fine dining and I'm not a service snob.\\n\\nPorter vs. Brick Store:\\nFood - Brick Store.  While everything I've ordered at The Porter has been good, the menu is a little limited.  I'd like to see more options with The Porter menu.\\n\\nBeer - Porter.  This was a tough one for me.  I think what pushed me over the edge was price.  Orval at the Porter was $9.  Not cheap, but it's $11 at Brick Store.  Other beers served at both placed tended to be cheaper at The Porter.\\n\\nDecor - Brick Store.  While the decor is similar, the Brick Store feels like it's better quality (booths feel sturdier, etc)\\n\\nService - Push.  Both are just fine by my standards.\\n\\nOverall - Push.  I think it really just depends on how much time you have and we're you're at in the city.  The Porter is a little cheaper and has less wait time (never waited the two times I've been).  The Brick Store is a nicer overall package, but the prices are a little higher and the wait is longer.  If I'm taking some out of town company, I'd probably take them to the Brick Store.  Otherwise, likely the Porter.

Garlic bread was mediocre to be honest.  Maybe we would have a better experience without getting delivery but I shouldn't think it should be all that huge of a difference.

Top notch place post-5 o'clock to take the edge off. Given the welcoming din of patrons engaged in what I'm sure must have been spirited conversations on matters great and small.\\n\\nReally appreciate the decor, which is stylish without being pretentious. Winning mix of forest green carpeting, swatches of cut glass along the sides, and dominant mahogany table settings. \\n\\nIf you're too worn to a frazzle to care about going the whole nine yards in business casual dress don't worry about it. I called in advance, and Mark told me that he's seen millionaires stop by wearing cut-offs and flip-flops. This being uber-casual Austin no real surprise there. \\n\\nWhat was really neat about my dinner was it was proof that even when you splurge there is a way to be suitably health-conscious. More on that in a sec. The waiter made his task of laying out the various delicacies look effortless. From the day's fresh catch list to the prep technique of the steaks to the daily specials he looked right at home. Even shared with me his recommendation of the mahi-mahi, his professed favorite selection since he started working there.\\n\\nFor openers I went with the lobster and crab bisque. Immensely full-bodied. Fantastic way to warm up your gullet. While it's true such choice might seem more suited for the two or so weeks when the temps around here are more conducive to a need for something to stilt bone chill, I found it a hearty pleasure that I prize because it isn't one of those \\"I eat that everyday\\" offerings. It came to the table with a dreamy pull apart loaf of sourdough bread. \\n\\nHaving had admirable experience in the past dining on this particular seafood item I leaned towards a pecan-crusted trout served with lemon butter sauce as well as a smart medley of vegetables, in this case asparagus spears, carrots sprinkled with black pepper, and mashed potatoes. So in other words you get a tantalizingly flaky trout paired with Vitamin C, the greens Mom knows you could always use more of, and one of the all-time great comfort foods. To say the least, I was impressed.\\n\\nImpressed successfully made its transition to awestruck when my dessert arrived. Due to its reputation I insisted on trying the vanilla creme brulee. What flair!! Put aside any guilt feelings you might have upon settling in to the smooth, creamy indulgence. It comes complete with strawberries, blueberries, and at least one blackberry. Where its friends got to I don't know but still I did see and later devoured the stag member of the team. See what I mean? You can have sumptuous and sensible in the same meal!\\n\\nWhat I wish I didn't have to work so hard to obtain from my server was water. Given we're heavy into drought season, that's a big no-no. The area of tables surrounding my booth wasn't so crowded that he couldn't have paid a bit more attention to my empty glass. That cost the restaurant a five-star rating. \\n\\nOverall, I say McCormick & Schmick's is ideal when the flavors of the sea beckon. I'm certainly hooked."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"A little disappointed in The Salt Lick this second time around.

Dinner was good, but given we waited for almost an hour to receive our wine and beer next door and did in fact wait for an hour to finally be seated, the restaurant is not, in my opinion worthy of that kind of wait.  Certainly waiting for a table is part of the Portland foodie culture and should be expected; however, for those kinds of restaurants that merit the long sojourns in their bars, lounges, etc (e.g., Ox, Toro Bravo, Pok Pok, Ned Ludd, Screen Door) the food is exceptional and worth the delay.

Sure, everything in the dish was poor quality, but it all made the \\"this-is-terrible-for-me\\" feeling all the better.  Sometimes it is good to kick back and enjoy fried corn tortillas stuffed with C-grade ground beef and topped with processed white and yellow cheese mix; just not everyday.  But it is also not everyday that you get your fried \\"taquitos\\" in a delicious salty, soupy, flavorful broth.  The hearty tomatillo broth that the roll-ups were drowning in paired perfectly with the blandness; it tasted a lot like a really good and spicy chicken tortilla soup.\\n\\nEnough about the drowning flautas.  The torta here is pretty solid, though the meat offerings could use some tweaking.  The bolillo roll was soft, nicely grilled, and it was smeared with a light layer of refried beans.  It also provided a mound full of fresh tomato, onion, and lettuce.  The meat fell flat; it was dry and had no flavor.  I ordered Adobado chicken and Al Pastor, but they both tasted similar--like nothing.\\n\\nScreaming Goat puts up some pretty good not-so Authentic Mexican eatin', but it sure is good.  And it is not too expensive either; the tacos may run a bit high at $2.50 a pop, but the drowning flautas can definitely tide someone over for about $4.25."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"We came to Salt Lick on a very, very rainy weekend, and maybe that's why there was no line?

Side-wise, we ended up with the coleslaw (awesome) and the potato salad (also great). I think the beans were actually the best option but in an attempt to be healthy I didn't order them so I could just focus on the meat.  Bread and pickles were available upon request, which was nice.

I was taking my children out for lunch and figured this would be a perfect time to reminisce over a hot dog from my youth.  When we arrived, the line was moving extremely slow even though we were the third people in line (out of three).  At one point the cook came out and said to the cashier, \\"I don't need to be coming out here every five minutes!  Who else doesn't have their order?\\"  Two men at a table said they had not been served yet.  The cook returned to his post and our turn was next.  The woman explained that she was brand new and apologized.  No problem.  She was very nice about it.  We ordered the #5 and a kid's bag with a mustard dog.  The cook yelled, \\"Did you want mustard on that?\\"  I said, \\"Yes, please.\\"  Then I ordered a Chicago dog, a plain hot dog and a small fry.  We sat down and when our number was called, my son grabbed the tray.  Our small fry was missing and so was the chili burger from the #5.  I went to get it and another woman was in front of me getting her order fixed.  The employees seemed confused and the cook was not happy.  The woman in front of me asked if the cook was the manager and the male employee said he (cook) was.  The woman shook her head and said, \\"Sheesh!\\"  I got my two items and sat back down.  I unwrapped the \\"plain\\" dog to discover there was mustard on it.  I went back to the counter and told them.  The cook heard and said, \\"She said she wanted mustard on it!\\"  Then he chucked it in the trash can and wrapped up a plain dog.  (If you are keeping track, I had ordered one mustard dog and one plain dog; they both ended up with mustard.  I had considered keeping it anyway but it was for an 11 month old.)  Needless to say, this was an extremely uncomfortable experience and I couldn't wait to leave.  The manager seemed to be in a foul mood and was taking it out on the employees in front of the customers (and even getting on the customers.)  That is very unprofessional.

I had been once to the bar only and thought it was such a fun experience that when I had friends coming in who wanted to eat at Disney Springs, I quickly booked us in.  I was looking forward to it so much that I had scoured the menu before hand and made sure that I was crazy hungry when we arrived.\\n\\nThe first thing that bothered me is that they sat us at a table where we had NO view of the entertainment. Why does a restaurant like this even HAVE tables with no view of the stage, considering that most people probably go at least partially for the entertainment. If I ever go back, I will certain make sure that I request a table that can see the dancers. The server told us that the dancers would come to the back and perform. We were there for 2 hours and they did not so the only time we saw them was on our way in, and on our way out.\\n\\nThen as  we were ordering, we were told the soup of the day was beer cheese. Yes! We all wanted it. Then it turned out that it was not. The soup of the day was actually split pea and ham. NO! None of us wanted that. To make up for it, they comped an order of \\"truffle fries\\" The fries were served in a cone-shaped dish. The top layer tasted somewhat of truffle and had cheese but as you ate further down, they were really just fries - and soggy ones at that.\\n\\nAlong with that came the drinks - which were delicious and the high point of the night. I had a red ale that was perfect and my friends got a couple of mixed drinks that they really enjoyed.\\n\\nAnd then came the entrees. Of the four entrees we got, two (the Heavenly Ham and the Steak) were considered to be really good by those who ordered them. I got the mussels - my favorite thing in the WORLD.  But here's the thing with mussels.... they taste like the sea and don't really soak up much flavor as you cook them. They are still going to taste like mussels. What makes mussels so amazing is that they are usually swimming in delicious, garlicky, white wine broth that you eat with the mussels and then sop up with bread when the mussels are gone. These \\"drunken\\" mussels were totally DRY. There was no delicious broth - so I just ate mussels that tasted like the sea and tired desperately to run them around the bottom of my bowl, hoping that a little of the delicious \\"drunken\\" broth they had been cooked in had dripped down and I could get a little flavor. Also there was an unopened mussel in my bowl - meaning it was already dead when they cooked it. That should have never made it out the kitchen door. \\n\\nMy other friend ordered the Boaring Burger and he and his wife both agreed that it was too dry to eat. He left about 2/3 of it on his plate.\\n\\nWhile we found the food less-than-stellar, I think had we been able to enjoy the entertainment, we would have overlooked it and my two-stars would have turned into four. But the combination of mediocre food and zero entertainment just left me feel bad for insisting that we go to Raglan Road in the first place.\\n\\nI may go back again on my own but I doubt I will ever risk taking out-of-towners here again.

This is one of my favorite appetizers, but these were over stuffed with iceberg lettuce, little basil, and little to no noodles nor bean sprouts.

I've been to some restaurants where the scallops tasted and had the consistency of a boot.  Not here.  My bf had the filet mignon which was melt in your mouth, smack ya mama good.

The food is good to excellent.  There is basic American fare with a few more eclectic dishes thrown in.\\nOn my most recent lunch visit I had the Cobb Salad which I've had on a number of occasions here.  It is served with grilled chicken and is really quite good and one of the healthier options on the menu.  \\nMy friend had one of their signature pizzas...this one included slices of prosciutto and she said it was delicious.\\nOther options include an assortment of burgers, sandwiches and salads.  There are heartier entr√©es like baked haddock, chicken piccata, fish and chips, steak tips and BBQ baby back ribs. They have truffle fries on the menu which I recommend trying...they are delicious.\\nThere is a reasonable appetizer menu as well.  In the evening stopping by with friends for a cocktail and a couple of appetizers can be a fun thing to do.

I'd normally say to just get your pie to go, but I found that Antico pies never really hold up well to being in the box and will be soggy by the time you get home, even if home is a block away in home park.

Let's just say that my husband and I have become....well, coffee elitists because of their coffee. We have a french press that we use daily and got tired of the same old crap at HEB so we started ordering coffee online at Mozart's. They packed up a few bags and would mail them to us so we wouldn't have to drive so far away. We ran through their limited selection fairly quickly so we looked for a new local place to get our coffee from who would also ship (Trianon being another favorite of ours didn't seem to be able to deliver). We settled on Austin Java and what a huge mistake! This review isn't for Austin Java so I'll save you the details, but in essence we realized how superior Mozart's coffee actually was and how we never took them seriously before we tried to find other coffee providers. Their beans are oily and earthy, without the bitterness. A pound of coffee is only around 7.00 which is cheaper than what HEB carries. They will also grind it for you if you want, but we always wait to grind it until right before we make it. \\n\\nMozart's is always where we take out of towners to see a bit of Austin.

I think overall the park looks dated and very 90s, but this place is perfect for toddlers.  He had more fun than in the Magic Kingdom's Mickey town.  You can't compare the two.  Disney will always be more beautiful because it's so nicely painted, shiny, and has beautiful topiary and landscaping while Universal's shrubbery looks sloppy, but for the play areas alone it was worth the $178 2 adult ticket prices.

You try Sunset, of course the line is out the door. You drive to the Roadhouse in Brookline, but no, there's a 1 hr wait and no room at the bar. You think to yourself, \\"Gee, I should open a bar with decent american food and lots of beer choices in the Allston Brighton area, 'cause clearly there's a healthy audience for this stuff.\\"\\n\\nAt this point, you and your sweetie have stopped talking to each other because you're SO hungry, that you know you'll just start bickering for absolutely no reason whatsoever except for the fact that you want food. You wonder why you didn't cook baked penne with broccoli like you had planned.\\n\\nYou drive to Coolidge corner, determined to find food. You remember that there's a Korean BBQ place that you and your sweetie went to LAST time you were in this situation (starving on a Saturday night). Sure enough, Yasu has tables open, and quick and friendly service. You crack open your Sapparo, eat one of the steamed dumping appetizers, and instantly feel better. Soon you're \\"cooking\\" your combo plate for two (with beef, pork, chicken, and veggies) and wrapping the contents up in lettuce leaves along with some of the side dishes.\\n\\nYou realize that you love your sweetie again, and all is right in the world. You take your time, enjoying another beer and the heat of the grill (because it's like -19 out). The waiters know you are relishing your meal out, and they bring the check only once you look their way and make the international squiggle in the air sign.\\n\\nNow that is what I call a satisfying Saturday night dining experience, well, at least once we got to Yasu. Sure, we weren't DYING for korean food, but we were VERY hungry (esp since one of us is on a reduced calorie diet at the moment).

This isn't the case. They only offer one bottle of red and one bottle of white half off, so hopefully you like the bottles they chose and it's limited quantity.  The deviled eggs were decent - you get 5 with one order. The bacon creamed corn was extremely soupy rather than creamy, but still very tasty.  We all had some BBQ pulled pork dish which was good but definitely not top 5 in Atlanta. \\nIt was a good bar food spot to cross off our Atlanta food checklist but probably won't be going back.

This is Portland, so bundle up. They seem to have problems with routing waiting traffic outside, as there are a bunch of signs asking you not to block the sidewalk. But you can only wait on the sidewalk. Hey, Pambiche, you should probably figure this out. An disgruntled employee kept shouting for people to get out of his way. To summarize the wait: it's cold and grumpy.\\n\\nPambiche is a tiny and cute cafe inside. The waiters were very friendly. We tried the croquetas and Cuban micheladas to start, which were both really good. The Cuban michelada has soda water and more lime in it than your traditional michelada.

We'll soon see if my 4 star rating goes up or down.\\n\\nMy GF Lisa and I briefly visited Acitron last Saturday night at 9:30pm, right after we had eaten some really wonderful Thai food directly acroos the street at Sweet Chili. We knew that Acitron was fairly new, and we wanted to scout it out and see if it was worth going there sometime soon.\\n\\nThe outside of the building looked very nice and inviting, so we first peered in through the large windows to see how it looked. It's a medium sized setting, with nice tables and chairs and a lovely ambience. We walked inside and spoke with the Maitre D' for about five minutes, leaving with a To Go menu in hand.\\n\\nDuring our 5-minute talk with the Maitre D', he told us that Acitron is very different from most Mexican restaurants in that it's got an upscale menu that features very fresh ingredients and careful preparation, using a tasty variety of flavorful chili peppers. He stressed that it's not at all your typical Tacos & Burritos kind of place.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Lisa and I were remiss in not taking a peek at the To Go menu before we left because, when we got home, we saw that it listed the names and ingredients of their dishes which sounded absolutely amazing. And, although their prices appear to be slightly higher than your typical Mexican restaurant, they seem to be quite reasonable given the higher level of quality and creativity.\\n\\nWe actually can't wait to try Acitron in full for the first time, and we know that this will be very soon because we live only a 3-minute walk from the restaurant and Arlington Center and it's cornucopia of fabulous restaurants. And, just in case you haven't yet eaten at Punjab (Indian), Sweet Chili (Thai), and Tango (Argentine) in Arlington Center, they're all the best in the Boston area in their respective cuisines.\\n\\nNow, you might think that Lisa and I are very partial to these establishments simply because they're located right in our back yard so to speak. But, I can assure you that Lisa and I eat out often and have tried a great many other similar places. We're just lucky that all of these places are so close, and that their very high quality is attracting an even greater number of terrific restaurants.\\n\\nSo, I'll get back to you soon to let you know if my full review matches my pre-review.

Many people read yelp to get an idea of the food/atmosphere they might encounter.  And with that kind of criteria, that is how I'm reviewing this place.\\n\\nPros:  If the New Orleans style decor is your thing, then this place is authentic from wall to wall.  From her website (http://nubianqueenlolas.com/), she has different pics of the interior.  It now has alot of Obama portraits, Christian images, and random sports team paraphernalia.  The cajun ice tea is a sweet blend of ice tea, pineapple and peach/mango juice.\\n\\nCons: The food is just not very good.  Dishes are either served in a styrofoam cup or plate.  The gumbo contains bones/cartilage/you name it.  For the most part, the food was \\"Cajun\\" thanks to Tony Chachere.  The tables are rather dirty as the scraps from previous diners are often left on the cloth table mats.  Your hair, clothes, and skin will smell of the oils because the circulation is horrible inside.  The gumbo, et toufette, and po boys were all $11+.\\n\\nMeeting such a humanitarian like Queen Lola is an honor.  She has a great personality, friendly, and seemly genuinely interested in you when you walk in.  And my review of this place is no knock against her and what she does.  But for the food and atmosphere, this place ranks among the worst.\\n\\nBang of Buck: 2/10"},{"name":"Pambiche","address":"2811 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Worth the wait.

So of course I Yelped/Googled it, entered the address on my phone's GPS, and played navigator for my Dad, who was driving.  We got off the 35, and my family entrusted their tummies and lives to me and my Droid, not questioning why it seemed we were only driving on rural routes in the middle of BFE...

I ordered coffee and water and let her know I needed a minute. She disappeared without so much as a pleasant \\"no problem take your time\\". \\nBefore placing my order I asked the waitress for her recommendation between two options I was considering. She said \\"they're both pretty popular\\"....literally that was it. Ok.....I'll go with the Crab cake Cavallo no English muffins please. She didn't seem to understand that I did not want the English muffins (this is a Benedict kind of dish). I confirmed I was aware of the structure of the dish and did not want English muffins. \\n\\nMy food arrived in a timely manner, she asked if I needed anything else and then she disappeared...for a really long time. Long enough for me to taste my dish which was beautiful but entirely too fishy and not lump crab meat as described on the menu. Now since this was my birthday breakfast I couldn't just let it slide. Also I felt like I needed to let this waitress know it was not up to par for her future recommendations. I was also able to finish my side of potatoes and half of my grits before said waitress returned. I sat there and waited, and waited and waited. Finally she came over to \\"check on me\\" but it was one of those 'I'm sure you're fine so I'm not even going to fully stop'. HOWEVER I stopped her and simply said \\"These are quite fishy and I'd like to order something else.\\" She brought the menu, I ordered the other option I asked her about initially and off she went without as much as an acknowledgement otherwise. I noticed 4 of the 6 other tables she was tending to in my section all received their food before my second attempt came out and they each had looks of abandonment by the waitress. By this time the consumed grits expanded and I was getting full. FINALLY my dish arrived (again nice presentation) and the portion I ate was delish. It even came with a new order of potatoes (because obviously I need more carbs).\\nTo summarize, service was SUB PAR, food was AVERAGE but has the potential to be REALLY GOOD, price was as expected ($10-13 seafood entree).

Also, to encourage you to stay in line and when get up to ordering, they give you a hummus dipped falafel to keep you happy. I've tried a few things from here, the chicken, lamb, and kufta wrap. All was very good and my favorite is the kufta, which reminds me  of the steak you get in a sub, only it's lamb. It's great that they put falafel in the wrap, as well as your choice of meat, which sets them apart from a lot of shawrma spots.

There were three girls at the front counter to take orders, but only one seemed to be actually working. Not sure what the other two were there for--it certainly wasn't for looks. So we stood behind a large group who were ordering while the other two register-watchers just looked at us. When the only one that seemed to be actually working got finished, she took our order. She defintely wasn't friendly, but at least she took our order for a margherita pizza with sausage. Don 't even try to order an additional topping. Apparently, that's a major no-no. And you should know that, her look seemed to say.\\n\\nThe front room was filled, so we opted for the back area (even though it was hotter there). Pizza arrived very quickly but, unlike some of the others here that think that's so cool, we could see the pizzas were basically ready to go and just had toppings added as almost an afterthought. The additional $5 for sausage was one of the biggest rip-offs in this city. Each slice had one, yes one, lone piece of sausage on it. \\n\\nThe pizza shows up in an overly-large baking pan. No plates, silverware, nothing. If you want a drink, you can buy one of those teeny-tiny cokes or an even tinier orangina for over $2 each . Because the place is so crowded, so hot, and the pizza add-ons like red pepper flakes are so spicy, you definitely need something to drink. Not knowing this, we just said we wanted water (not bottled). What we got was a small plastic cup, stacked on the table, and access to a sink, which had lukewarm water. Yuck.\\n\\nThe pizza was okay. We've had better. The outrageous price made it even less desirable.\\n\\nEyeing the homemade desserts in the front case, I decided I'd take some home. Hoping for something reminiscent of Little Italy, I approached the now-customerless front counter where my three favorite girls waited. As I stood there, alone, two of them opted to continue their conversation and totally ignored me (which is hard to do, as I was standing directly in front of them). I patiently waited. They continued to ignore me. The third one (again, the only one that seemed to be working that day) looked at me but pretended to be busy. Meanwhile,out of nowhere a customer walked up to Girl #3 and immediately ordered a pizza. I guess I just wasn't pushy enough. Seeing my disbelief, Girl #3 said, \\"I'll be right with you.\\" At least she acknowledged me. The other two still couldn't be bothered to end their titillating conversation. \\n\\nI ordered three items from the dessert case: one cannolli, one nutella biscotti, and one fanlike cookie w/creme inside. After charging an incredible $9.50 to my credit card, I went home with some blech desserts that weren't large enough to share. Don't bother wasting your hard-earned money.\\n\\nI am just not sure that it's worth the hassle, horrible service, ridiculous prices, etc., for this pizza.

We then had the kashk-o-bademjan, which involved baked eggplant, olive oil. yogurt, and other fine things.  It was like an amped up baba ganoush and was delicious.  For the main course, I had the lamb shank.  Exactly as advertised on the menu, it was falling-off-the-bone tender.  So.  Good.  It was served with an interesting Persian rice with lima beans and fresh dill.  My wife had the chicken kabob, which I found to be tender and tasty.\\n\\nAll in all, I would say that if you are going here to feast upon a fine skewer of meat, you will not be disappointed.  The spices in the dishes we had were certainly present but not overpowering.  I tend to like a little bit more spice myself, but to each his or her own.

I'd like to come back to try more things on the menu (if I can tear myself away from Toro, that is)."},{"name":"Sweetish Hill Bakery","address":"1120 W 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"The best bakery in town!

I came here on a date with my hubby. It was super crowded here. I heard good things about this place, so we decided to give it a try. When we went it was very loud and not much space. It might be a bit overrated, but the pizza we ordered was really good, and I enjoyed watch the pizzas being made. I think the experience alone is worth trying at least once. I don't think it is the best place to bring kids though.
