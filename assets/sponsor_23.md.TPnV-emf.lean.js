I think the \\"manager\\" was just having a horrible day and decided to take it out on customers (simply based off of S K's review). I had a few friends over today, my friend called and ordered wing dings and a large pizza. Simple enough right? Terribly TERRIBLY wrong. I received some version of wing dings; un-breaded, tasteless with a side of buffalo sauce and celery...apparently something called \\"Fresh Wings\\" (which aren't even on the online menu). \\n\\n I've been ordering from this place for about 15 years now and I've never ordered Fresh Wings...whatever they are. I called and told them about the misunderstanding and asked them to please send out the correct order. The girl I was speaking to asked me to hold and proceeded to explain the situation to the \\"manager\\" and said to her, \\"well then you talk to her\\". The manager picked up the phone obviously already irritated and essentially told me I was wrong, she was right, I ordered the wrong item and it's an extra charge for the wing dings...then demanded I send the other chicken back with the driver. She said all of this while scoffing, laughing,  and joking with the other employee. The phone disconnected. I assumed the connection was lost and went outside. I called back and heard someone pick up and deliberately hang up. This happened several more times. Honestly after a long day I just wanted some damn wings, and a beer and not have to deal with kids that are having some sort of power trip at 10 pm. I asked for a manager and before I even finished the statement she belched out that she WAS in fact the manager. I asked for a higher up and she stated there is no one else in charge. Now, Charlie's has been a main staple in Dorchester since my school girl days at St. Marks across the road...I highly doubt that the owner would simply hand over his business to a young girl who's only been there for two months! \\n\\nAfter being yelled at about how wrong I was by the manager (who had taken the order) I explained a room full of people heard the order being placed, so maybe it was just a bad connection or maybe she may have misheard? Nope. I ordered incorrectly apparently. I simply asked her to send out the correct order and she nastily replied it was an extra $5. That was fine with me, but in my experience, most establishments will send out a new order free of charge after a misunderstanding. She obviously needs a course in management, or perhaps just a lesson in the common courtesy of not berating or belittling customers? I don't think that's too much to ask for. I will NOT be ordering from here again until they hire better staff. Based on the other reviews I'd say the problem is the staff, not the food! ..(although I did order a Greek salad a month ago which arrived without feta cheese or olives...what?)"},{"name":"Dairy Queen","address":"5605 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"You need to fire your nasty manager and how someone who knows how to speak to people instead of bullying vulnerable people.

You can also ask for spicier salsa but it's very spicy. I like spicy but it's like really spicy. I usually have to mix the spicy and regular salsa together.

I prefer it over 5 Guys."},{"name":"Bakersfield","address":"733 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I've been looking forward to this place opening for months, and I finally ended up going tonight.  I was disappointed!  It was... y'know, okay.  It wasn't a bad place, but it wasn't what I'd hoped, especially after all the reviews on here that I'd read.  As a disclaimer, I have a need for exactly two types of Mexican cuisine: authentic, and Tex-Mex.  I don't think this place does either particularly well; for my money, I prefer Cuco's for the former and Surly Girl for the latter (though SG has a different sort of spin on Tex-Men, I found their tacos more flavorful than the ones I had tonight).  I ordered a meal fairly indicative of what I get at a lot of Mexican places -- queso dip, two tacos (one fish, one veggie), and both the house and the premium margarita.\\n\\nThe drinks: The house one was decent.  It wasn't some syrupy mess from Friday's; it had fresh juice in it and was noticeably sour, and reasonably strong.  Not bad for $6, but nothing to write home about, really.  The second one was, I thought, less memorable in flavor, seemed smaller, and cost twice as much.  Neither were large drinks, but the second one was getting downright conspicuous.  I don't usually worry about bang-for-buck with booze in restaurants, but $12 for a small, just-okay margarita is... questionable.  \\n\\nThe dip: It was baked, so that was pretty cool.  It also had a really hearty texture that was very different from normal queso dip, which I personally liked a lot.  Though it tasted fairly cheesy, I found it on the bland side.  On the other hand, their chips were good, and both of the salsas they brought out were solid -- especially the mild (I'm actually quite into spicy food, but the mild salsa had an interesting, almost cucumber-like flavor to it that made it really good in a refreshing way).  I'd have liked the other one to be spicier, though.\\n\\nThe tacos: All-important, for this kind of place.  And the highlight of the meal!  But that's not saying much.  The tortillas were pretty solid; not stiff or too mealy like some soft corn tortillas can be.  The veggie taco was alright.  I ate it.  The fish taco was actually good; the citrus slaw ended up being pretty flavorful and as a person who doesn't like red onions, I liked them in this taco.  That said, I liked it, but I didn't love it.  It immediately brought to mind Surly Girl's pulled pork tacos with a similar citrus slaw, and though they aren't fully comparable, I preferred them to Bakersfields's.\\n\\nYeah, it was alright.  Damning with faint praise and all that.  I think I'll return once more to check out a couple more of the tacos and their guacamole, but I found my entire experience extremely forgettable.  Honestly, I don't really get why so many frequent Yelpers are giving this place glowing reviews.  I often agree with them about local hotspots, but not here."},{"name":"Thai Passion","address":"620 Congress Ave, Ste 105","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Botulism. That was the word coursing through my mind earlier this week. Forty-eight hours later, we're all good, aside from a bit of nervous indigestion.\\n\\nSome history:\\nHad biz lunch engagement at TP (hmmm... could be relevant acronym here) on Tuesday. Upon ordering appetizer soup, our guest suggested shrimp as the ingredient of choice. I countered that that's not the route i'd choose, as a friend had once been victim of a vicious bout of shell fish poisoning (years ago, gifted from a similar type establishment... but felt not appropriate dining subject). So, we settled on the chicken, ordered main course --i chose E1 TP Noodles, chicken (of course)-- and got down to biz babble.\\n\\nOkay, here we go. About 1/3 way into E1, i bit into something that tasted remarkably like a cross between Tender Vittles (yes, i know the flavor first hand; another story) and Dawn dishwashing soap. Swirling the suspicious ort around my mouth --and haphazardly swallowing (!!) a severed bit-- i spat the remnant into my soup bowl... and lo... and behold... was a bit of pink, \\"undercooked\\" (ok, \\"raw\\") yardbird. {Insert Darth Vader-esque \\"NOOOOOOOOOO!!!\\" here}\\n\\nSweating. Skittish. Pissed off. I push the remainder of the meal away. Can't f-ing believe it! I even drank an E-mergency before setting out today... thinking better safe than sorry since it was cold and it's flu season and we're going to public place and all those germs and stuff and and... Raw Freaking Chicken has invaded my person! NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!\\n\\nSo now comes the part where the waitress comes over to collect our plates, bowls, assorted bits. Suppressing the notion to put her in a headlock, i quietly point out that my meal contained \\"undercooked\\" (f-ing RAW man!!) chicken... pointing to the offensive piece of quivering flesh left in my spit cup. \\"Ahh... sahwie,\\" our waitress says, and rambles off.  Uh, ok, no problem, happens right? I can man-up and deal with the double-end runs for a couple days, a bit of fever, trembles.\\n\\nThen we get the bill, and of course E (-bola) 1 is still charged to our meal. 'Bout that time the rest of my party takes on the matter and asks for the charge to be stricken. \\"Ahh, okay.\\" Funny thing is, is that the manager then comes out, asks, \\"Ya, you want to talk with me?\\" and we mention the chicken thing, and get another, \\"Ahh... sahwie\\".  Hahahhahahahahaha!!!! I feel much better, thank you.\\n\\nAnyhoot, like i said, it's been 48 hours and aside from a gaseous performance carried out in my lower internals, all seems fine. Can i get a big \\"Whew! Amen! Hell Yeah!\\"?  Will i ever ever eat at TP again?  Sure, but i'll definitely be ordering the shrimp :P"},{"name":"Wine Bar George - A Restaurant & Bar","address":"1610 Buena Vista Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"I recently tried the new Wine Bar George in Disney Springs for the first time. I think this is a welcome and much-needed addition to the restaurants on offer at DS. \\n\\nI really like the concept, and the wine selection is extensive, diverse, and interesting. I love that you can create your own wine flights by the ounce, and the \\"Rare Pours\\" section of the menu is ingenious. We tried like five or six different wines from all around the globe. I love wine-tasting, and to be able to pick and choose which wines I want to taste is invaluable, and just fun. I have particular tastes when it comes to wine, so this really suits me. \\n\\nOur server was really friendly, helpful and efficient. The hostess originally brought us to a high-top table with barstools, that our 5 year-old daughter just wouldn't really be able to sit at, so we asked for a different table. She took us right to another table, no problem. (And without taking us back downstairs to the hostess stand like the long trek at Tiffins we had to make twice, only to be seated back at the table I asked for in the first place.) \\n\\nThough this table was better, it had bench seats on either side, with no backs, so of course at some point our daughter flipped backwards off the bench on to the floor. The seating options aren't great here, though they do have some regular chairs, we didn't happen to get any of them. They have sacrificed comfort and practicality for aesthetics and trendiness, but it does have a cohesive ambience. \\n\\nThe small plates and desserts we tried were all delicious, and arrived very fast. Some before we even got our wine, but it was all nicely prepared. We had the fried macaroni  and cheese bites, the burrata with tomatoes, and the porchetta-spiced pork cheeks. I really enjoyed the polenta that came underneath the pork cheeks, and although the pork cheeks were quite tender, they are very unctuous, so if you don't eat a lot of meat, or aren't a pork super fan, I might recommend something else.  Along with the olive oil cake and key lime pie for dessert. My only criticism would be that the food menu have a few more choices, maybe three or four more dishes on offer. It was very brief. Though the skirt steak and the wine-braised chicken sounded great, it was just too much food for two adults.

I visited during an off hour in mid morning, still the place was packed. And it is loud, really loud. The folks behind the pastry case sure seem lackluster too, as though they aren't so happy to be there. And I can see why with the angry manager standing over them looking down glaringly!!! Yikes!!!

I mention the pastries because there weren't many options on the bread wall (maybe they sold many before my arrival?). I chose a Kouign Amann, but it took some time for me to find it. Why? Because their Kouign Amann's look nothing like the delicious beautiful pastry from  Brittany. These pastries are one of the most special things you'll ever eat, think of a beautifully laminated buttery yeasty dough with a crisp outer surface and a delicate interior crumb with a nearly soft sugar butter center, and this all shaped like a folded up rose. Sounds incredible right? Well, that isn't what you get here at St. Honor√©. I don't know who made these, but perhaps they need to go back to pastry school? Because whatever it was that I ate, it was decidedly not a Kouign Amann. It actually looked more like a botched attempt at a biscuit.

I don't frequent Park Ave much, and almost never on a weekend, but if you're new here, resign yourself to walking a few blocks and perhaps looking up obscure parking ticket laws on your phone so you can trick yourself into not worrying your car will be towed away while you eat.

I also ordered a biscuit and jam, which overall wasn't the best. The biscuits they use are very crumbly and fall apart as you eat them, which I personally don't like. The jam was rather flavorless, but was made of real berries, which I did in fact appreciate. Finally, I ordered an egg and cheese biscuit with a sausage patty, which I enjoyed the most. They use the same biscuits as before, but it seemed to hold together better in this sandwich. It could have been improved by the addition of a slice of cheese, but overall it was a very good sandwich, with a nicely seasoned patty.

Sometimes curry is difficult to gauge whether it will be either too sweet or too spicy. This was perfect! Definitely would be my go to dish. They serve the chicken in big chunks.  At first, I was worried it would be hard to eat without being messy but the chicken was so so SOFT and so were the potatoes. I can tell they had enough time in the curry.

We came here at about 7 PM on...a Sunday? I'm not sure but it wasn't very crowded. We walked through the inner dining area and it was DEAD. No one was seated and it was very empty. I was a bit worried but when we went out to the patio we saw that this was where the party was at so that was comforting. \\n\\nDrink orders were taken promptly and then menu analyzing commenced. They specialize in Mole, which is a chocolate based sauce for most people but there's also a milder pumpkin seed one as well, called Pipian. There's usually 20+ ingredients in mole so it's quite a specialty and pretty hard to find. With the waiters recommendation, I got the pork that was roasted with pipian sauce and my boyfriend got the Al Pastor. \\n\\nI loved what I got. The pork was very...carnitas like in the unctuous and grease crisped way. It broke apart easily, was deliciously tender, and my mouth is totally watering right now. The sauce was flavorful and nutty. Not very pronounced but just a good blend of flavors. It came with a metric f***-ton of food though. Rice, that wasn't really seasoned (meh), refried black beans (totally made up for the rice), and the usual pico de gallo/salad plate decoration. I was stuffed when we left and the price, for what I got, was fine. I think it was around $14. \\n\\nI am detracting a star for the bummer rice. Rice, especially Mexican style shouldn't be bland!

Just keep in mind that during prime lunch hours there may be a long wait so it's best to arrive a bit early or even a bit later. \\n\\nPart 2- This is a note to management. The job of a server is to take the tables order, refill drinks and attend to any needs/problems the table may have. As I was dinning I witnessed servers running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Bringing bread/water, bussing tables, running food and resetting. It was ridiculous. At one point I almost got up to help. A server needs help and is not a one man show. I saw two separate tables get up angry looking for their server. It's not their fault. There should be runners and busboy's. This would not only help turnover time but would make customers happy.

Chronically and habitually understaffed. The store is so cheap and incompetently managed that they even refused to fix card readers at the register for months, forcing customers to insert cards and pull them out three times before they would work. This location is little more than an overpriced bodega. They will customers line up 20 deep for the self checkout line and still not open a register. Their saving grace (though still not a reason to shop there) is that the workers are friendly and grin and bear it like it's nobody's business.

On the other side, there is a periodic chart of different cheeses.  Great conversation starters.   My husband went with \\"The Sweet Heat\\" even though he dislikes cole slaw. I went with the Truffle Melt with havarti, truffle oil, arugula and black pepper. We decided to split an order of the truffle oil fries with rosemary.  We placed an order which was brought to our table. My husband actually enjoyed his sandwich. Mine was good as well with generous pieces of arugula but very rich. I could barely eat half.  As for the fries, they were very disappointing. Overdone to the point of almost burnt if they were left in the oil any longer. I had a few but my husband ended up finishing.

The combination platter of Beef Koobideh Kebob & Barg Kebob was just ok, thankfully the rice was pretty good, but not worth $20. And the salmon kebob came out on a platter as a whitish fish that resembled salmon, but made me think perhaps it was farmed. The description said skewered with tomato, oninos and pepperoncini, but the tomato was a half tomato that was barely warm, certainly not grilled, and nothing had been skewered. The eggplant and tomato mash was the best thing on the menu. The service was not horrid, but really also not up to par, and the water glasses were plastic.

Wonderful Steakhouse with impeccable service, outstanding food, and wine! Our dinner started with the grilled octopus, which was very tender and incredibly tasty. We then ordered a crab cake which to our delight didnt have any batter, but had huge lumps of crab--divine! The last appetizer we ordered was two lobster bisques as both my husband and I LOVE lobster! We just cant get enough of it. The bisque had good flavor but didn't have as much lobster in it as it usually does. I should point out that our server, I believe his name is Mario was outstanding! We explained to him that last time we were there everything came out all at once and we didn't get to enjoy so he waited to take our entr√©e order after we finished ALL of our appetizers which gave us plenty of time to get ready for the main course and to drink our bottle of wine. For the main course my husband and I split the 32 ounce wagyu bone in ribeye and for the sides we ordered the lobster mac & cheese along with the Brussel sprouts. The ribeye was seasoned perfectly and melted in your mouth. Both sides were fantastic! As if that wasn't enough food, our waiter surprised us with dessert for our anniversary. Such a sweet touch.

This location is highly convenient to my office. 2). The food was ready quickly despite the lunch rush. 3). The overall flavor of the duroc pulled pork sandwich was delicious. The bread (on the top) was just the right amount of both soft and crusty. And the pulled pork was tasty, tender, and cooked properly. \\n\\nThe Cons: 1). The pork wasn't pulled well, so there were still large wads of connective tissue/fat throughout, which had to be picked out. 2). Perhaps this one is partially my fault, because I asked for extra pickled carrots on my pulled pork sandwich, but the juice (from something?!) soaked through both the bread and the container. Thus, rendering the underside of the sandwich an inedible, mushy mess. It immediately fell apart in my hands when I tried to lift it out of the container. Luckily, I had taken the sandwich back to my office, so I extricated the filling and ate it with a fork (using the top bread as a giant crouton). If I'd been planning to eat in the restaurant, I'd probably have had to send it back, which is the worst. \\n\\n*This is doubly entertaining though because the prior time I visited this location, I ordered the grilled shrimp salad and asked to add pickled carrots to it (I really like pickled carrots!), and they said they couldn't do that. The salad itself  was $14 for pretty much just mixed greens, a little Thai basil, a couple pieces of bell pepper, and five shrimp ... which tasted fine but wasn't thrilling. Pickled carrots would have definitely helped.*   \\n\\nI've eaten plenty of banh mi, and while this Cambodian-style sandwich is slightly different, they involve the same general ingredients and I've never experienced this issue before. All in all, just okay. I'll probably be back eventually because our choices are so limited, but my expectations will be adjusted."},{"name":"The Lobster Stop","address":"723 Washington St","city":"Quincy","stars":"4","text":"Went to the Lobster Stop for dinner the other night.  Before I even mention anything about the interior, I'll talk about the place itself and location.  It's in a traffic circle, but off to the side so bit hard to locate.  Secondly, the parking lot is tiny.  If you come during busy hours, you may have a difficult time finding a spot.  \\n\\n\\nOnto the inside.  Small place with a few tables.  Has a mom and pop feeling to it.  I ordered the single lobster roll with fries, wife ordered the same with some fried clam strips and buddy ordered the double.  The single lobster roll is $14.  The double is $23.  Now, I know what you're thinking.  A double is too much food.  Au contraire, the lobster rolls are on the small side and I would say most people can probably eat two.  The caveat is that the amount of fries you get is quite vast.  Everything came out to about $70.\\n\\n\\nOnce we ordered, we went to pay with a credit card and they had mentioned that there was a 4% fee for the credit card.  Weird.  That was a first for me.  Just a fair warning to everyone paying with a credit card, you will be charged an additional 4%.  I know credit card companies charge vendors to utilize cc's but most companies themselves understand that that's the cost of business and don't translate that directly to the customer.  Maybe the do indirectly by raising the prices slightly of the merchandise.  Again, not a big deal but definitely eyebrow raising.\\n\\n\\nThe food itself was good. Lobster rolls were fresh and tasty.  The clam strips were also really good.  My only knock was the size.  Very small lobster roll.  Approximately the size of a hot dog within a hot dog bun.  With the amount of fries they give you and the side of clam strips we ordered, it was enough.

Seeing it a stone's throw from my address in the Burnet Road area is similarly intelligent because the Allandale neighborhood is lousy with family units and also has an embarrassment of eatery riches, the latest parking point for New Orleans-style snow ball puvreyor Sweet Caroline's being one of the latest examples. However, a food joint is only as reputable as the fare found inside. I admit I'm not amongst the first to go skyrocketing with excitement when I hear a natural food restaurant has popped up. That's because of a concern I'm sure a lot of other foodies carry with them wherever they go. Said concern is, \\"Will the taste of the food be sacrificed in the name of being an organic product? Will I enjoy what I'm eating or will I plop it into the wastebasket within a half a minute and try to purge the misadventure from my mind ASAP?\\"\\nMy first visit to JuiceLand has given me no reason to think the staff could care less how tasty the grub is. Not only that there's ample indication the whimsy element has spread from those other two locations. The pale green interior dotted with sturdy wooden tables and even sturdier metal chairs with just enough of the engaging layers of well-worn rust alerted me to my entrance into a temple of \\"treat the body like a temple instead of a chemical toilet\\". I was smitten with the fruit in a bowl aesthetic. \\nOn your way in is a fridge containing highly nutritious beverages and the food portion of the menu. There's a lot to like about the Clean and Soba Noodle Bowl. No limp strands here. The entire dish smacks of farm freshness. You want your noodles to have enough body but not so much texture that you sense the chef undercooked them just a smidge. Bathed in sesame oil the noodles have a delighful zip about them. Edamame soybeans, a nutritionally savvy heavyweight were the soft go with the flow component of the meal. Unlike the noodles you want these beans to offer up as little resistance as possible. To my relief the advertised red peppers weren't liberally scattered. Some eateries don't know when too much spice is truly too much. The shittake mushrooms fit nicely in the chewiness department with the noodles. Although I couldn't see any tagalong skin on these 'shrooms their presence always makes for that much more of a nourishing entree. As for the kale I'm happy to say it wasn't lifeless. Again I tip my hat to the freshness. A small portion is just a hair under $3.95. The manlier large runs you $5.95.\\nFrom the dizzying assortment of smoothies, agua frescas, and fruit drinks I plunked some dinero on The Home Run smoothie. This consists of fresh apple juice, strawberry and banana. Having had a Jamba smoothie a time or ten I'd like to express my gladness at how not overly filled up this drink left me. More energy focused on the purest health benefits. What a sparkling treat! \\nIn order to get the full soup to nuts experience I strive for in all my reviews I took a dessert from the \\"grocery wall\\" as I'd call it. Ronnie's Real Foods, one of their inddulgence + health = good profit margin distributors is to be commended for creating cookies that don't prompt an immediate revolted reaction. Paramount players in their chocolate chip cookie are rolled organic oats, organic maple syrup, and organic semi-sweet chocolate chips.

I am not understanding the hype for this place.  We had 6 dishes and a dessert, all of which were bad in their own wonderful way, so it wasn't me just ordering one bad dish, because 7 dishes makes it hard for me to think we got that unlucky with a all menu.  \\n\\nI am going to put about as much effort into writing this review in depth as they put into making my food last night.  So, you will see some detail, but it will be missing a thing or two here and there.  \\n\\nFirst problems encountered were a tip hound waiter that somehow conveniently recommended all of the most expensive dishes, and also waited for you to order something before stating whether it was still in stock or not.  Next, we had two appetizers one was called, \\"glorified fish sticks\\" by one of the people we were dining with, and the other had uninspired dipping sauces and wet sloppy onions on some of the bread, that was somehow too sweet, while the another type of bread was tough, with the third being a bit too salty.\\n\\nNext to the main courses.  Bad pizza, with an odd yet barely present flavor, but was still probably the best of the 4 mains.  Ravioli that tried for something great, but missed the mark by a ways.  Then there were noodles with braised pork that seemed like someone was high when they thought it up, as the sauce and noodles (somewhat overcooked) mixed with what seemed more designed for a Hawaiian dish pork just did not work out.  If they were to make a Hawaiian dish with that pork, I would probably enjoy that, though.  And, then we had the lamb belly which I was excited about, which did carry the lamb flavor I was hoping for, but was over seared on the outsides to the point it was hard to cut, much less eat, and the accompanying sauces were a disaster when paired with the flavor of the lamb.  Throughout 3 of the 4 dishes, pizza being the odd man out, a consistent theme was that they had way too much salt.\\n\\nFinally the dessert.  Ugh, it was terrible.  We tried the caramel popcorn pannacotta, which you have to give them credit for trying something different, but then quickly remove those points for the chocolate mousse that tasted more like Jell-O chocolate pudding than chocolate mousse that was on top of this.  The pannacotta consistency was not there, it was too soft.  And finally,the caramel popcorn addition was too salty, and the flavor just did not work with the Jell-O pudding mousse and the poorly done pannacotta.  This was probably the biggest failure by Renata for the evening, and unfortunately it was the closing taste.  \\n\\nThis place was crowned way too early for best restaurant of Portland, and it sucks, because I loved the story behind the creators and how they got here.  It was a let down, and the name of French Laundry should be completely redacted from any future communications, because it set expectations that were not met by any form of closeness.."},{"name":"Ssam Burger","address":"2072 Defoors Ferry Rd NW, Ste F","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Based on all the positive reviews, including some from my trusted buddies, we decided to give it a try. Boy! we were really underwhelmed. The concept of fusion burger is great, but the execution was not. \\n\\nI ordered the Saigon burger, which I thought it has a identity crisis. I wasn't sure if it's a burger with bahn mi fixings or a bahn mi with burger patty and burger buns. I feel like it lacks something to tie the two cuisines together to make it a real fusion burger. As for the taste, it was good. The sweet potato fries is definitely not the best I've had. The fries were cut into different sizes so some pieces are crispier than the others. The glaze on the fries was not evenly spread....so some fries were just tasteless. My dinner companions felt the food was just ok as well.   \\n\\nOn the other hand, I really like the lotus chips - thin, crispy, earthy taste, and unique.

Technically it's not even a restaurant, but a Mexican market that also happens to have a deli case filled to the brim with piping hot, freshly prepared items like tamales, gorditas, chicken mole, and pork carnitas. Prices are criminally low (especially the excellent deal that gives you 1 lb. of carnitas, a package of 24 freshly made corn tortillas, and a 1/2-pint of salsa for only $10.99 - enough to feed 3-4 people easily). The carnitas are amazing - tender and flavorful, with just the right amount of heat - and the pico de gallo is the best I've ever had. Never mind the chips; I found myself eating it straight out of the container with a spoon! Also quite good are the gorditas; flavorful round, doughy tortilla pockets stuffed with your choice of chicken or pork and topped with salsa, cilantro and cheese. At $1.99 apiece, a trio makes for a hearty, filling (and cheap) lunch. Yes, the location isn't the greatest, but the folks lined up outside the blood bank have never personally bothered me before.

This was the only quick thing that happened the entire evening.  \\n\\nThe standard at the Continental is that starter/appetizers are brought around generously prior to your meal.  They walk around with their famous Continental Popovers and Corn Fritters with Cherry Sauce.  On the table they always bring over Cottage Cheese Dip, Bean Dip and a basket with crackers.  These items are always what you tell everyone about because it makes the meal fun. \\n\\nHowever on this holiday visit the girl with the a full fresh basket of steaming hot popovers walked right by our table and didn't offer us any until she was making her way back to the kitchen about 15 minuted later and we received cold popovers.  \\n\\nAfter approximately another fifteen minutes the fritters came by and the woman passing them out gave each of us one lonely fritter??? Geez it was already about 5:30 and all I had on my plate so far was a cold popover and one lonely fritter, what the heck??? \\n\\nObviously all the cottage cheese and bean dip was gone long ago.  Finally the waiter came back to take our order at which time I requested warm popovers and additional fritters. The fritters did arrive about 5-10 minutes later.  However the popovers didn't arrive.  It was about 20 more minutes for our waiter to come back.  I do understand it's a holiday and this is a huge restaurant, but it was our holiday dinner that seemed to be dragging on and on and on.  \\n\\nFinally I spotted a girl carrying a basket with hot popovers, I actually waved and called her over so we could enjoy some hot popovers which were as always very good while hot. \\n\\nSo now we were reaching approximately 6 o'clock when the waiter finally came back to finish taking our order.

Apparently the person who was taking the reservations guaranteed something that was not available, because the waiter returned and informed us that no legs were available. We took this information in stride and proceeded to make our order.  \\n\\nNow the wait was on.... 6:30....7 o'clock.... A few more fritters and another round of popover... 7:30 yes one hour from order has past, the waiter saying he was sorry each time he went by our table.. boy he must have been covering a huge section because we were there a long time...\\n\\nFinally our salads arrived, a basic garden salad nothing fancy, some iceberg lettuce,a tad of shaved carrot, a lonely grape tomato and one slice of cucumber which looked as if it sat out a while. \\n\\nI'm not sure what was happening, we barely tasted our salad when the side dishes started to arrive???  \\n\\nIncluded with the meals were all the sides, served family style.  The sides were comprised of Whipped Potato, Maple Glazed Potatoes, Butternut Squash and New Peas.  All of which were decent. \\n\\nI gobbled down the last bite of salad just as the main course arrived,,, This was a little confusing, I waited..waited,,,, and waited some more and now they were bringing everything over so fast as it was like a race to make room on the table, very unprofessional.  \\n\\nAnyway, everyone in our party decided on either the Fresh Roasted Turkey which was served with a Chestnut Stuffing or the Roast Prime Rib of Beef au jus which is an Aged Beef slowly roasted.  I opted for the Prime Rib and it was huge, tasty and cooked perfectly as were all the Prime Rib that came to the table, however they all had way to much fat on them compared to normal. I also had a chance to taste the stuffing as we requested an extra side so everyone with the Prime Rib could taste some. Only had one mouthful of the stuffing, it was just average. The sliced turkey was moist and tender and tasted great. \\n\\nI believe we left approximately a few minutes before nine.  I was happy to be able to spend all that time with family, but wish the food would have not been served so sporadically.  I wish a manager had come by to at least apologize for our service. it would have been a nice gesture. \\n\\nI will return for the Famous Baked Stuffed Lobster which looked and smelled fabulous.\\n\\nI give The Continental a Solid 3 Stars"},{"name":"Ola Gifts Cafe","address":"112 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"Walk in for a coffee and breakfast, see a sign for \\"peanut butter and banana sandwich,\\" and ask for that.

You are still more central to most Austinites, and a fun place to get some delicious sushi, but your service and price made me take off my rose-colored glasses for a while. \\n\\nThe service here was acceptable, at best. We arrived at 9 pm (an hour before closing) feeling like we knew what we wanted and could get in and out in an hour. It wasn't very busy, but it took several minutes for the hostess to come to the front. She sat us, and we were greeted, got our drinks, and then an eternity later, we finally got to order. I was frustrated because it was close to closing and I didn't want to be there past closing (I have weird anxiety about this - it makes me feel so rude I want to melt into my chair and die). \\n\\nBefore our food even came out, she came over to tell us it was last call. I think it was 9:30. So, you can see where the problem is here. 9:30 and still no food, but I am expected to know if I want any more. Great. \\n\\nFinally, we get our Sashimi Moriawase (sashimi for a group and bowls of rice if you want), which was not as beautiful as some other places I have seen it in um, cedar park cough Soto. I was a bit disappointed, but all in all it is an amazing value for fresh fish and you don't have to make any decisions. I was incredibly impressed by the albacore, wow! Best I had ever eaten. I actually never had liked it much before.\\n\\nMy biggest problem of the night was that the server didn't tell us what the types of fish were that we received. I feel like that is the cardinal rule of sushi. I even asked her to come back and tell me, and she said one of them and walked away. I was pretty bummed!\\n\\nWe also got the Road Runner roll, which was WOW one of the best rolls I've eaten ever. Musashino really kicks ass with their sauces.The road runner is perfectly spicy, and very stunning because it has black squid ink rice with habanero caviar.\\n\\nSo food-wise, I was a happy camper. Except that while eating said food that took so long to get to me, they started closing up shop. We weren't even the only ones in there. They were sweeping, talking loudly, doing receipts, and even the kitchen staff walked through with cigarettes in their mouths to go smoke outside. One of these offenses may not rub me the wrong way, it was just the sheer ignoring of the fact that we are still trying to enjoy the $100 of food we ordered. \\n\\nAlso, we didn't even get any water or service after the bill was dropped off with our last roll. \\n\\nUgh, it's so disappointing, but there are just so many great sushi places in Austin, and when I'm dropping $100 on food, I have a certain expectation of service level. I ended up feeling a bit remorseful and that I could have spent my money better elsewhere. \\n\\nSo, service was a 2 (for the level of restaurant this is) and the food is still a solid 5. That leaves me with a 3.5, which I round down because of the high prices.

Technique really matters here because they will char the noodles before adding it to the gravy. (Lazy places will just boil the noodles and top it with the gravy) It's usually really hard to find any Chinese restaurant that will make the egg sauce because if they don't quite make it right It will turn into soup! We order the combination which comes with chicken, barbecue pork, shrimp, squid, and scallops.\\n\\nAnother favorite of mine is salt and pepper shrimp in its shell. Not too salty here and just perfect to have with rice. I usually have to tell them to make it a little extra crispy though which makes eating the shrimp and the shell better! If you don't like the shell, You can order it with no shell or even the calamari is just as tasty.\\n\\nWe tried the peking duck here before which was good for its price and portion size but we were a little disappointed because rather than very thin crepe like pancakes for peking duck that are traditionally served, these were a little bit thicker and almost resembling a tortilla like texture. \\nThe duck's first course is all the crispy skin comes out on a plate with a side of cucumbers, scallions, and hoisin sauce. \\nThe second course is where all of the duck meat is saut√©ed with assorted vegetables."},{"name":"Noodlebox","address":"1867 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"consistently tasty food, big portions, cheap price = win ! \\n\\nI usually come to this place for lunch since it is close by, everything in their menu is in the $8-15 range and comes in big bowls, so you always have leftovers :) Everything on the menu has variable spiceness and choice of veg/meat/fish, so its highly customizable, and they'll work with you if you have food allergies/specifications.\\n\\nThe only negative is the seating , they have a lot of space, if they only had it laid out better, i'm sure more people could fit.

The timing can be all over the map.  However, today, a staple of Southern Americana came (back) to the Portland metro area.  Chick-fil-A opened a new store in Clackamas and, while the last one was in the food court at Clackamas Town Center when there was an ice skating rink there, this one occupies the site across the street where Chevy's Mexican Restaurant used to be.  \\n\\nThe store is a nice one and, with its brickwork and trellises, looks like it could fit in quite well in the burbs of its hometown Atlanta.  Incidentally, College Park, GA is really its hometown.  (College Park is where you may very well be picking up your rental car, parking your car on a long-term basis, or getting some \\"shut eye\\" if using ATL airport).  The interior is large and airy, with ample space around the counter area and with a vast seating area.  The interior is also slightly rustic, harkening minimally to Cracker Barrel, another native of the South.  Maybe they're \\"kissin' cousins.\\"  Let's not go there.\\n\\nMoving onto the food, it's boilerplate Chick-fil-A and it has seemingly remained unchanged. That's a good thing.  Mostly, it's about the chicken sandwiches, which come in different forms.  For healthier fare, I prefer the grilled version, which also costs a little more.  Then, I had to sabotage its healthiness by ordering it \\"club\\" style, which includes Colby cheese and bacon.  The waffle cut fries have a good, lighter than usual \\"potato-y\\" taste and differ from those of Carl's Jr., which I also find to be good.  True to their Atlanta area roots, they feature Coca Cola products.  Thankfully, they do carry Cherry Coke, which I like, and had mixed with Coke Zero.  With all that said, the chicken patty in my burger was tender and flavorful, thus almost perfect.\\n\\nThe employees taking the orders and attending to the seating area were very polite, but then I find that employees further out in Clackamas, Washington, and Clark Counties tend to be more polite in fast food locales.  I'm withholding the 5th star because, while it's not \\"as good as it gets\\" in the realm of fast food, I'm definitely a fan, having eaten at the Chick-fil-A in Peachtree Center in downtown Atlanta some 2 or 3 times a week when I \\"rode the rails\\" (read MARTA) there.  The other thing is that, for this very typical trio, it's priced about a third of the way up between regular fast food and a chain operated \\"fern bar,\\" but then Chick-fil-A is better than most fast food.\\n\\nTo commemorate Chick-fil-A's arrival to Clackamas, I came up with a brief jingle for the occasion.  Here it is:\\n\\nSouthern folks often greet others with a twangy \\"hey\\"\\nBut I say, \\"Hey, today is a fine day,\\n'Clacka-fornia' got a brand spankin' new Chick-fil-A,\\nAnd you can see it from Clackamas Town Center across the way\\""},{"name":"Winflo Osteria","address":"1315 W 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Meh.

We were already there and hungry so we decided to stay, and I'm glad we did!\\n\\nWe got the Red Miso Ramen with chashu as the choice of protein and also ordered the soft boiled egg, as well as the Black Garlic Ramen with chashu and soft boiled egg.

Very flavorful, not very spicy, noodles cooked to perfection, and included a lot of my favorite toppings. Black Garlic was also good, but didn't have as strong of a flavor as the Red Miso.

Hands down my favorite breakfast on Disney property and each time I go (at least 5 times or so), I fall in love even more.  \\n\\nFirst, the drinks... \\nKouzzina serves the BEST bloody mary I've ever had.  They use a little cucumber and it makes the drink SO refreshing.  I would drink these all day if I could but I'd rather enjoy the rest of the park. :) One or two at a time is my limit.\\n\\nAlso...the french press coffee...heaven.  It's widely known that Disney coffee at counter service places is vile and horrendous.  However, all sit down restaurants brew fresh coffee.  Kouzzina uses Greek coffee in their french press and it's delicious.  It is strong though so just warning you.  But Greek coffee is supposed to be strong.  I usually order a whole pot for myself and then ask for a to go cup so I can bring the rest into the parks with me.  \\n\\nNow onto the food....\\nMy favorite breakfast meal is the orange blueberry whole wheat granola pancake.  OMG delicious.  It's one HUGE pancake always cooked perfectly, served with bacon or chicken sausage.  There's a ton of blueberries in the pancake and the orange flavor isn't too overpowering at all.  Just a hint of zest.  Very filling and amazing.  The chicken sausage has a great flavor to it as well and goes good with the maple syrup served with the pancake.  \\n\\nThe American breakfast is the typical two egg meal, always a good choice.  I always ask for the kalamata olive bread, even though there's usually an extra charge for it.  YUM.  The turkey sweet potato hash is also delicious.  The hash is unique since it's sweet potatoes but it's not overly sweet.  The stacked breakfast is also a great option, it kind of combines everything together.  \\n\\nService has always been amazing, whether I'm dining solo or with a big group of friends.  The head chef when Cat Cora isn't there is the sweetest woman ever.  When she found out my mother and I were Greek, she quickly came over and started talking to us asking what we thought of the meal.  Very friendly! \\n\\nLast time I had dinner was a few years ago so I'll save that review for January when I have reservations.

They have something for everyone.\\n\\nFirst- our group came to Throw Nation primarily to Bowl- with footballs- by throwing them. Not your father's NFL or even Aunt Maude's Saturday afternoon Bowling For Dollars. This was much better.\\n\\nI attached a photo of the rules of the game, but if you're lucky you'll have the amazing \\"Ang the last Axe Bender\\" (AKA Daria) to guide you through the ins-and-outs of the game. She was great! Basically you throw a football at the pins to try and knock over as many as you can. The pins are actual, full weighted bowling pins- so they won't topple over in a close call or at the surprise gust of a mighty wind. \\n\\nBut here's the catch- during the game, if a pin is knocked over for any reason it's fair game and stays down. So if you accidentally knock a pin over because you tripped on a Canadian team mate- it counts the same as if the opposition knocked it over. If the opponent throws the ball and it bounces off the wall, your leg and then topples three pins on the back row- they count. We learned that one the hard way, but our team finally won the last of our three matches. We left the playing field with a smaller slice of what pride we came in with, but really success is just playing this game here.\\n\\nWhat's going on at the far wall when you arrive is what this place is really known for though- the axe throwing. Think Grizzly Adams meets James Bond for drinks, shaken- not stirred- and they bring three friends each. What you get is an opportunity to throw axes at targets, score points and feel like your life needs much more plaid in it, all while contemplating the max possible length of your beard.  There are even axe throwing leagues for those who catch the fever- and believe me, the fever was for more than just cowbell.\\n\\nWhich brings up a good point- you sign a waiver as soon as you arrive. Trust me, you should, because while throwing things like axes, footballs and other items can be fun- word on the street is it can also be somewhat dangerous.\\n\\nThere is a menu with pizza and other items, local craft beers, domestics and a full bar. But as the sign says- no liquor for those who are throwing axes. Sounds like a good rule to have. \\n\\nThere are TVs and projection screens to make sure you don't miss a pitch, play or match. But- here's a tip: if you're throwing an axe, forget about the TV and just try not to scalp your cousin Ricky. \\n\\nThey do take walk-ups but honestly you're better off looking on the website and locking in a time to go- it can get busy and you don't want to show up and miss out on the fun.\\n\\nThere are some cool shirts for sale too! (Why didn't I think to have axes added to the American flag to replace an occasional stripe. Genius.)\\n\\nOk- you've heard me now make a plan to try Throw Nation yourself.\\n\\n+ Great games\\n+ Food and a full bar\\n+ YOU GET TO THROW AXES!!!!!\\n+ Fun, active and likable staff members (Like Ang the Ace Bender, who's name was actually Daria, and she was awesome!)\\n+ Plenty of space and tables\\n+ Ample parking\\n+ Reservations available online to make sure you and your friends/family/targets get to play when you want.\\n\\nAnd I guarantee you will leave with at least one great story to tell.

Their burgers come in two sizes - small and regular. The regular one is less than $4 each. I love everything about their burgers. The bun is perfectly toasted on the inside, nicely covered in light mustard and/or mayo. The patty is very well cooked and well seasoned. Today I asked for the patty to be cook well done and was a bit afraid it would be dry, but they pulled it off nicely. The edges were a bit crunchy without losing the juiciness of the patty. Tomato slices in burgers tend to be soggy and soft from the heat of the patty, but the tomato slices here are so fresh that they're crispy every bite you take. Pickles always add a nice flavor and provide the right tartness which bind all other flavors nicely. Their fries are regular cut and very crispy.

But I thought I remembered Taco Cabana being decent. Maybe it's just this location that is so awful. I've been there three times, and the service and food got progressively worse. First time they gave me a beef fajita taco instead of chicken. It was more like flaky beef jerky.\\n\\nMaybe a couple months later, picked up a quesadilla and they asked me to pull past the last window, without an explanation. I was confused, but pulled up to the specified line and started waiting. One after one, the cars behind me get their food and start flashing their lights at me to leave. I had to pull around the other side of the building, and was completely lost until the alley door opened and a girl ran out into the parking lot to give me my food. Well, she walked. If they want me to pull out of the way due to my food not being ready, maybe the drive through should be two lanes so people can actually pull around?\\n\\nThird and last time, ordered two chicken fajita tacos, and I think the dude ordered two beef. The guy at the drive through window started handing us quesadilla boxes and drinks instead. His friend corrected him, and he handed us another bag. We pull into the parking lot just to check and make sure, and of course, it's a completely different meal with chips and something else. They were giving everyone's food to the wrong people. After parking, going inside and exchanging bags for a second time, we go home and sit down for a movie, opening up... four beef fajita tacos. Not only was that wrong on the third attempt, the beef was so dry and terrible that it hurt going down my throat. Contrary to my being, I threw everything away. This is god judging me for getting dinner out of a drive through... other than P.

I have never lived near one and whenever I am in a city with a Piada, I have to stop.  It's by far my favorite counter service restaurant of all time!  Please come to Orlando!!!\\n\\nUsually, I use Piada as a Cheat Day indulgence.  It's basically a walk-the-line build your own Italian Burrito (or bowl) place with a few other options.  If it's your first time, I recommend ordering a Piada where they place the large round Piada dough on a hot griddle and it gets all warm and bubbly.  Next, it's on to adding pasta (Yes please), protein (the sausage is my favorite), sauce, and other toppings.  Don't forget the pancetta!\\n\\nIf you're hungry, this will probably suffice.  If you like to stuff your gut till you can't move, then add on a side of calamari with peppers!  The breaded hot peppers are worth it on their own.  Also, you can get a piada stick, meatballs, garlic dough, etc.  Grab a menu at the front so you can see all of the options.  The big board isn't all that helpful in all of the other goodies!\\n\\nOn this visit, I was being a good boy and decided to try a salad with all of my favorite Piada toppings (except the pasta and spicy sauce).  The salad was amazing with the lemon basil dressing, chickpeas, chicken, pancetta (I remembered), olives, cucumbers, and whatever else you want!\\n\\nI'm pretty sure this is the original location where it all started so they may have other items here not available in other stores.

Hands down, it was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant/bar in Portland, OR. \\n\\n(skip down to the *asterisk* part if you want to skip the set-up!)\\n\\nWhen you walk in to the bar, there is a sign-up sheet where you put your name and number of folks in your party. There were two people ahead of us on the list. Ok, that's fine, we're patient people, we expect a wait on a Saturday night. On the sign-up sheet, it requests that you wait outside, and sates something to the effect of, \\"We will work our hardest to seat you as quickly as possible.\\" I kind of make eye contact with a pretty blonde server (like, she obviously sees us but looks away to attend to other things at that moment) and think, \\"Ok, she sees people are waiting, we'll just wait outside.\\"\\n\\nWe wait for about 15 minutes, and by then we have seen two parties of 2 leave.

She was just going to continue to let me stand there and ignore me.\\n\\nI asked her if there was a manager on site. She again REALLY did not want to respond to me, still giving me icy dagger eyes. I asked again. She finally said something like, \\"there's the bartender over there\\" nodding over to middle-aged, overweight brunette woman. The same bartender that has very obviously been doing everything in her power to pretend we didn't exist. We had tried getting her attention earlier when the table was opening up.\\n\\nThe bartender ALSO gave me the most icy stare-down and ignored me.\\n\\nAt this point, I am laughing with incredulity. I again expressed my frustration to the server, explaining how I have been in the customer service industry too, I have worked at restaurants, I understand its stressful, but you just CAN'T set up a system for seating and then ignore it...and then treat people with such rudeness! She mumbled something like, \\"well that group is going to grow larger, so they need that space.\\"  I just laughed and said, \\"OK, well I'm going to write a negative review on Yelp and make sure everyone I know hears about your horrible service\\" and left.\\n\\nIf a restaurant chooses the all-for-yourself seating method, that's fair game. But, don't pretend you have a system for seating and then act like the customer is crazy for expecting a seat when it's their turn.\\n\\nI will never step foot inside this establishment again.

I have stressed that we are happy to return the not gluten free pizza as I cannot eat it, and that we only want to receive what we have actually ordered. I have sent an escalation to corporate but want the public to know about Mali and the frequent mistakes this location makes for such an important specification. Be careful if you have a sensitivity to gluten, more than once our pizza has arrived NOT gluten free and then Mali who unfortunately my husband and I have had to deal with on more than one occasion does not listen and discriminates against people with gluten intolerance. Never have I spoke with someone more ignorant and impatient as this man. He actually refused to deliver to us because of my gluten intolerance and concerns for the repeated mistakes that are being made. I am disgusted with how he has treated us on more than one occasion when all we have done was try to ensure we've received the correct order.

It is really overpriced and you do not get what you pay for! The meat is no where near the quality of where it should be, no marbling and the pork belly is cut super thin and at 20$ for an add on plate you should receive more than 10 thin slices. \\n\\n2. Kalbi meat is short rib meat and what came to our table reminded me of thick flank steak that was poorly cut because it was cut extremely thick. \\n\\n3. The meat sets are poorly balanced. Example for set A you will get thin meat, bulgogi and some Kalbi for 30$ which feeds 1-2 people and then for set D you get everything in set A but with added kalbi and more beef which is supposed to feed 1-4 people at the price of 75$. So as a rational eater we figure we should get set D as opposed to buying 2 set A's for 60$ because we might not get enough and D is pre-calculated to feed more people right?\\n\\nWrong.\\n\\nEven though we got the more expensive plate less came to our table. We actually had to order more raw meat on the side.\\n\\n\\n4. This place is so convenient being right smack dab in Hawthorne! I like how clean it is and how the menus are easy to read. \\n\\n5.

We recently tried Dip Dip and spent $300 for two of us to barely eat a very bland hotpot.  This hotpot is full of flavor and sippable!  We spent $45 to eat tonight.

Yes! Wine Bar George lived up to the hype and I am SO thrilled that it did! Since this place opened at Disney Springs, I've been dying to try it, and I now believe it'll be on the top of my list every time I come back to Walt Disney World.\\n\\nLet's begin with the obvious. Wine Bar George has quite a selection of wine. Now I know that there are other places like this one (where the wine menu goes on for pages and pages), but there's something rather special about Wine Bar George. The menu goes on for pages and pages and pages and pages, and the variety is so intense that you can order anything from a $7 glass of wine to a $2,000 bottle (yeah, no joke). Granted we didn't feel like doubling the cost of our vacation, so we went for the cheaper wine ($12-$20 per glass range), and we still weren't disappointed. Regardless of your price range or taste buds, the Cast Members here know their library well, so I recommend asking for their suggestions (and giving your price range) if you feel lost in the many choices.\\n\\nNow for the not-so-obvious. The food at Wine Bar George is incredible! The menu is tapas style, so it's easy to rack up that bill with food (and we did), but we were not disappointed at all. Meatballs were at the top of the list for me, complete with a delicious red sauce, polenta cheese, and herbs. Next on my personal list was the burrata, served with fresh mozzarella cheese (homemade... you could tell), tomatoes, and basil atop grilled bread (my mouth is watering writing this as I think back). Next was the chicken skewer platter (topped togarashi and Asian slaw). We ordered seconds of all the above! We also ordered the crispy Mac & cheese bites, which were also delicious but for me tasted closer to something you might get from your local franchise (think TGI Friday's or Applebees). Still, the quality was much better and the food significantly fresher, so I have no complaints.\\n\\nGeorge, whatever you're doing my friend, please keep it up.

I'd read the reviews here and on Open Table, so we were prepared for very small portions and high prices. Had the food quality been good we would have had no complaints, but three of the five dishes were essentially flavorless and only one of them was accurately described on the menu. There was literally no flavor of hazelnuts whatsoever in the cauliflower with hazelnut cream and microplaned hazelnuts -- they were totally absent. The only flavor on the dish came from the lemon zest -- it wasn't even salted. The salmon that was supposed to have a horseradish crust had flavorless breadcrumbs on top and minimal flavor from what appeared to be a lemon buerre blanc. The winter greens salad had no dressing on it and we told one of the waitstaff who took it away, but he didn't ask us if we wanted a replacement. The sauce under the confit potatoes (confit means slow cooking in fat, but these potatoes were clearly boiled in water as they had no flavor on their own) was quite tasty as was the bucatini. The wine was, as expected, terrific and the restaurant is beautiful, but we won't be back. Lake Oswego needs great restaurants and this one could be if they provided value for the money.

I loved it even before it moved to their new location years ago. I am incredibly crestfallen that Musashino no longer opens for lunch even though most of their old lunch menu is included with their current menu. Make sure to arrive right when Musashino opens at 5:30, because seats are gone quickly. \\n\\nTheir fish is always so fresh. A quality that is vital for sushi to be tasty. The quality is apparent if you order their omakase. Even though the price tag is hefty, you will eat like a king. I took my boyfriend for an omakase as a congratulations for being accepted into dental school back last spring, and I sure am glad to have had some of it. The fish provided from the omakase was tender-more so than the fish they provide when you order sashimi from the menu. The wasabi was freshly made too given the texture and the vibrant taste of it when you put a teeny tiny amount in your mouth. Even the ginger was at a completely different level compared to the conventional ginger they usually give.\\n\\nOutside of the omakase, the sushi at Musashino is still solid. There's a reason why the Tyson, owner of Uchi, started the earlier part of his culinary career at Musashino. Like the review below me, my mother also had the pleasure to work with both of Tyson and Smokey (Musashino's owner). The sushi rolls are wrapped flawlessly and are creative. No way that you'll have the roll falling apart when you pick it up with chopsticks. As a fun fact, Musashino is also the only sushi restaurant I know of that incorporates squid ink with their rice. \\n\\nIn case I haven't tempted you to go to Musashino enough, you should really try their tempura ice cream as your dessert.

We arrived around 4:45pm and had no problems with parking, but by 5:15pm the place was nearly full. I noticed valet was also parking cars in the general parking area, so that makes parking difficult as well.\\n\\nWhen we walked in there was already a line to the door of people waiting to check in, but surprisingly it only took around 15 minutes to be seated.\\n\\nWe were greeted immediately and our waitress went over the regular menu as well as magical dining. Some restaurants look down upon you if you're only there for magical dining, but we received excellent service. Definitely one of, if not, the best service experiences I've ever had. We had two managers come over to our table as well as multiple servers. Our water glasses were never less then half full and we were checked on just the right amount of times without it feeling over bearing.\\n\\nBread was brought out for the table. It didn't look like much, but it was addicting. The butter...oh the butter. Both loaves were fresh right out of the oven. We had two and were offered another one, but we had to stop, lol.\\n\\nWe started with the caesar and seasonal salad. Both were amazing. The croutons on the caesar were hard on the outside, but soft on this inside. My BF got the caesar which I preferred over mine, but both were very good.\\n\\nWe both went with the filet for our main course. We went with medium rare and were advised they cook their steaks more on the rare side and boy was she right. Even though the filet was more rare than I like, it was delicious. We both agreed it was one of the best steaks we've ever had. They top of the filet is charred and topped with an incredible seasoning. I finished mine so fast my BF was amazed, lol. The potatoes which accompanied the filet were amazing. They have celery mixed in and just the right amount of butter.\\n\\nWe each ordered a different dessert so we could try both offerings on the menu. I didn't read the chocolate mousse option correctly because I thought it was a cake, but when I took my first bite I was hooked. You could really taste the high quality Belgian chocolate. The strawberry cheesecake was just as good. We did end up switching because I knew he would prefer the chocolate dessert, but we both had our fair share of each.\\n\\nThe ambiance, service and food was spot on.

Way to pad the bill.\\n\\nFrom the breakfast/brunch menu, I order a fried egg and some black beans & grits on the side.  The fried egg comes welded to a chalupa shell, swimming in broken yolk and some watery greenish sauce that makes the whole undercooked mess so nauseating that I can only attempt a couple of bites.  The grits are a congealed orange blob that is formed to the bowl, which the waitress says is because they're mixed with cheese.  Good thing for the black beans.\\n\\nI'm giving them two stars because my son liked the cheese enchilada from the kids' menu, and because the building itself has a pretty interesting vibe, given the high ceilings and outdoor patio.

My husband left the restaurant saying - I wish I would have been mugged to loose 50.00 tonight rather than spend it on \\"dinner\\" there - at least that would have come with a great story to tell.  \\n\\nSo here's the deal.  My daughter ordered a sushi - she said it was ok - given the option of Kogen in powell, Meijin in Westerville, or Shushiko, she reports all of their sushi is by far better than Chandra's.  \\n\\nI ordered what was referred to a skinny chicken - grilled chicken with a honey glaze, steamed broccoli, and orzo pasta with spinach.  What was brought out to me was chicken so hard I couldn't cut it with a knife with a ton of overly salty brown sauce, certainly not honey, topped with raw tomato, two sprigs of asparagus, and a small amount of orzo pasta with yet again raw tomatoes.  Perhaps I got the wrong dish, but certainly not what I thought I ordered.  At 13.95, I would have enjoyed licking the bottom of a shoe just as much.  \\n\\nMy husband ordered.  He ordered beef broccoli dish, and has never left a plate full at a restaurant in the seventeen years we have been together.  However; this was a first.  He was able to eat the fried rice, but had to stop eating after about half of his dinner.  \\n\\nThe service.  We were greeted by a very friendly and nice server.  So our hopes were \\nquite high for a wonderful experience at this establishment.  However; we found the place to be about half full and the employees appeared overwhelmed.  To say the service was slow would be a complement.  It took over 40 minutes to get our dinner from the time we ordered.  Thank goodness for iPhones cause my seven year old would not have been good if I hadn't ordered up a netflix movie for her to watch while we waited.  We had our drinks refilled without the ice being replenished, so after the first glass our drinks were all warm.  When offered dessert, my seven year old declined and said if it's anything like that food, I'd rather eat what's on fear factor.  Its good to have a since of humor in situations like this.  Thankfully, she said it quietly, but nonetheless truly brutal honestly.  \\n\\nEven if we were invited back for a free dinner we would pass this was such a bad experience of food quality and service.

It's sort of like what you increasingly see at McDonald's outlets these days, but also not terribly different from an authentic Japanese experience where you'd order from a vending machine. This can get a bit cumbersome as you might have to wait behind folks who are bewildered at all the choices or are just slow with technology, but at least there are several machines to accommodate the crowds.\\n\\nThere are several options to choose from for each menu category, whether ramen, poke bowls, apps, or drinks. I opted for the tantanmen mazemen and a side of fried pork gyoza. Each were very satisfying and worth the spend. The noodles came without broth, but coated with a rich, savory sauce. As if this weren't enough, it was all topped by a runny egg yolk and a small helping of ground pork. Stirring everything together made for a yummy noodle bowl that I couldn't stop eating once I started. This would be filling for most, but of course I had to get greedy and try the fried pork gyoza. It came with a delicious aioli-like sauce and was also super, super delicious. \\n\\nService was also extremely fast and efficient, and all in all this is a nice way to get a fusion-inspired ramen fix in a slightly upscale yet mostly casual setting.

Attending a new restaurant right when it opens won't yield the best experience, so we scoped just the menu and decided we'd try it in a few weeks. But it looked promising, especially since they had a GLUTEN-FREE menu.\\n\\nI wound up going with co-workers which meant that I tried a lot of the menu. The atmosphere is great for local diners who want a casual atmosphere for drinks after work and tourists who want a Boston experience (by which I mean a trendy place with good food that is not intimidating). \\n\\nI like anything that's finished with Prosecco so I tried the Pearfection. It was perfectly light and not too sweet. Good way to start off the night. (Served in a champagne flute to give you an idea of what you're getting for the price.)\\n\\nFor apps we tried:\\n- Trio of Spreads: 2/3. The truffle goat cheese is the highlight and the white bean dip is good. The artichoke tapenade lacks flavor, a problem with a few of the dishes as you'll see.\\n- Shrimp and Grits: incredibly small portion with tiny shrimp and bland grits. Skip this. (For the best shrimp and grits, head to Oceannaire or Back Bay Social Club)\\n- Spinach and ricotta farmhouse dumpling: no idea what this was supposed to be. What we got was a green dough ball. No flavor and too dense. Skip this too.\\n\\nWe also tried a bunch of pizzettas (as if that's a separate course) and all of them had the same problem: the crust wasn't thin or crispy enough so the dough filled our mouths more than the toppings. If the crust were more like a cracker, I would recommend the Nova, which is like a bagel with lox (big smoked salmon fan here).\\n\\nMuch to my dismay as a Yelper, my table of 12 wound up with only two entrees:\\n- Chicken Francaise: spicy in a bad way - too much garlic. You couldn't taste anything in this meal except for garlic. And the chardonnay-lemon sauce wasn't enough to cut through the massive amount of garlic in the dish.\\n- Carmelized Day Boat Scallops: everyone seemed to enjoy these good, but there wasn't much enthusiasm about them.\\n- Creamy Polenta (side dish): less flavor than the shrimp and grits. Polenta and grits need butter and lots of it people!\\n- Mac n cheese: good, but with the mac n cheese explosion in this city, there's better out there.\\n\\nAfter reading my review, it may seem like I didn't like the place, but honestly I want to go back.

Our server was named Rebecca and she's very knowledgeable about the menu and even understand how to help me order when I wanted my takoyaki and fatty pork extra crispy/grilled. Ramen was hot and we ordered red miso ramen and it was perfect amount of spice. I normally would get spices in addition if the broth wasn't flavorful enough but this place hit the spot! I looked it up on yelp and glad I made a good decision. The soft broiled egg was cooked to perfect. I've been to many ramen places where the egg is over cooked or not really \\"soft broil\\". Fatty pork and pork belly was crispy and hot and I've definitely eaten it as some places where it's served cooked but chilled and practically still refrigerated cold then add to ramen, which makes your broth cold or cool faster. Everything was good in terms of price and parking and ambience. One advise though was on the restroom because it is narrow hallway into the restroom.  Perhaps to be careful and always alert for potential safety hazard because the dirty dishes are put away there in a cart so it can get wet or dirty if there's spill and because it's narrow for one person use; hallway can get backed up so check with staff first if it's empty. The restroom inside though is clean so that is good in terms for cleanliness and sanitation.\\n\\n***Update 3/10/19*** I LOVE this place so much, that I came back 2 days in a row and brought 13 people back this time. I have to say I am very happy to personally have been greeted by the owner and again, staff is very very welcoming. They welcome everyone at each table with a heartwarming smile and genuine service. Comes to check on you periodically, refill your water and the atmosphere is just very lively here. I tried the black garlic ramen today, some of our family preferred red miso because the flavor and spice and some tried vegetable ramen. I like that the vegetable ramen broth is also very flavorful and I heard a lot of slurping sounds across our 3 tables. \\n\\nOwner is very very kindhearted, hugged me, shook my hand and she read my review! She came by to make sure everyone was good with their orders and the wait time was not long at all. Time is essence in cooking to keep food quality fresh and temperature just perfect, their cooks mastered this. I had time to wait until all bowls arrived and taken pictures then ate and broth was still hot!! I was given hot sauce on the side but I barely used any for the black garlic ramen. I will say this that not everyone likes garlic, perhaps some must have an acquired taste. Gyoza was ordered by other tables, I didn't get to try but the looks and speed of the plate being empty, like as soon as it sat down the table, it was GONE. I'm sure it was crunchy and delicious. They do have icecream for children and he did enjoy that vanilla icecream with a pretty big serving and two pockysticks, couldn't take photo because the kids could not wait! Owner treated me a plate of takoyaki, it was super crunchy and sooo hot! I popped that like a ball in my mouth and every bite was crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside. Best thing is the inside is filled with octopus, you know you're scoring a good deal 6 pieces for $6!!! \\n\\nAgain quality 5 star, price is affordable $10-13 per ramen bowl and plenty options to how much you want to add. Be sure to check in and write comments to score those free toppings, I personally recommend their soft broiled eggs!

Parking is a breeze, no need to valet unless that's your thing. We had a reservation and were promptly seated. I don't think a reservation was needed because there were no other diners except people at the bar. I found it interesting that there were so few diners for dinner. \\n\\nOur waiter, Kyle ( or Carl?) is a waiter they should keep. Professional, attentive, and patient. He added to the classiness of the restaurant.  He was very helpful in explaining the menu. I ordered the tempura lobster tail, the batter was so greasy that I left it off and just ate the lobster meat which was succulent.  I should've just ordered the regular lobster tail. \\n\\nHere's where things got a little underwhelming. The bread that comes with the dinner tasted stale. No butter could fix it. The kitchen moves extremely slowly which would be understandable in a packed restaurant. We were the only diners unless they had a private party in a room somewhere. My husband ordered the New York Strip and he didn't eat the whole thing because it was unseasoned. I tasted it, a good cut of meat that was so bland, I was surprised because the restaurant has steak in its name. There wasn't even a sprinkle of salt. For the cost, the steak should be mind-blowing. \\n\\nI ordered the Georgia Wild Shrimp in Angel Hair. The butter and white wine sauce did not hide the lack of seasoning in this dish. The shrimp were fresh and the pasta was done perfectly but it was all so bland. Some crushed red pepper might have help.  Overall,  the food wasn't bad, it's just for the cost, it really should have been more flavorful.

A lovely loaf of warm, sesame-crusted bread arrived at our table with delicious, freshly whipped butter. We also ordered their lobster bisque, which was incredibly creamy without being too rich. The huge chunks of delicious Maine lobster were greatly appreciated--just when you assume you had the last bite of lobster, another huge chunk was found swimming at the bottom, which is the best surprise ever!\\n\\nOn to the  main meal. I ordered a prime 16 oz. ribeye with the chateau mashed potatoes, and my husband ordered the dry-aged ribeye. Both were cooked to absolute perfection, with an amazing peppercorn crust, seared to the perfect little crunch. The dry-aged steak definitely had the funkiness/earthiness, almost blue cheese notes that packed an amazing flavor punch. My ribeye was melt in your mouth good.

Although the options are limited, it's more than enough for the options and definitely worth the price. \\n\\nWe ordered a rice bowl, which cost us and extra dollar, but it definitely helps makes the meat less boring. There's a small table for sauces you can go to and grab some for your table, so take that to your advantage, because some times, the sauces help the meat taste a lot better. They serve you side dishes for free so ask for more if you run out! My favorite is the pickled radish, it tastes great with the beef, rice and dank sauces. \\n\\nOnly thing I'll say is that the quality of the meat isn't excellent or anything, but it's what you get for AYCE at that cheap of a price. I've only been on Thursdays, so I can't speak for the other days, but it's definitely crowded, hot and sweaty because of all the other college students coming to enjoy AYCE as well. So don't be surprised if you have to wait for a while before getting seated.

The veggies were over cooked and seems like it was prepared way ahead of time and just added to the bowl when ordered. The sauces that it came with was interesting. However, I added sriracha to my bowl and it made everything better! :P The sandwich was delicious. The pork belly was nicely marinated.

That being the case, and there being a set menu for the night with limited options, you'd think that it wouldn't take all night to finish a meal.  Unfortunately it took nearly 2.5 hours to complete our meal, and were frequently sitting around for 20-30 minutes waiting for the next course to arrive after we'd finished the previous one.  Our waiter was nice and I don't think he was at fault at all.  We had a clear view of the kitchen and everyone in there looked to be working really hard, so I really have no idea what took so long.  The few tables around us seemed to have the same experience, with many people looking around with increasingly frustrated expressions.\\n\\nAs for the food, nothing really stood out there either.  The steak tasted like a grill rather than beef, and the texture of the grilled lobster was rubbery and chewy.  There were several other items, including the wheat tagliatelle with mushrooms  and the shrimp risotto, but all of them left an impression of \\"meh.\\"  I suspect that we just caught them on a bad night because of NYE, since there is so much Yelp love for this restaurant.  It's hard to believe though that this would explain dish after dish being underwhelming.  I also can't blame the slooooow service on NYE, since we were there so early ahead of the crowds.  It's puzzling.\\n\\nLoved Parkside the one time we visited that establishment, and was expecting to have a similar love for Olive & June.  It didn't happen.

Yum. Let's have a moment of silence to respectfully worship their signature bier cheese....it's that good.  The onion rings were also heavenly. We indulged in the liter size Hefe Weizen, a truly delicious beer that goes down quite smoothly.\\n\\nEven on a Tuesday night at 7 pm, the place was jam packed.  The live music was great fun, people were dancing and singing along, raising beer steins in the air.  One of the musicians led the room in singing \\"Happy Birthday\\" to everyone celebrating their special day.  We were seated right by the stage and I will say the music was way too loud if you have any intention of holding a conversation at your table....definitely not a first date destination. But if you're with good friends and just want to have some fun, the music and atmosphere is definitely like one big party.\\n\\nI can be a picky eater and there are times when I look at a restaurant menu and only one or two entrees look appealing to me.  This was not the case at Hofbrauhaus Columbus, where I had a very hard time making a choice from so many very appetizing selections.\\n\\nMy chosen entree was their take on the Kentucky Hot  Brown - smoked turkey breast and Black Forest ham served on a potato pancake, topped with Swiss Cheese, our tomato, smoked bacon and.....of course....more bier cheese.  This was an absolutely fantastic dish that I would definitely try again. \\n\\nMy dad had the Bauern Schnitzel which he absolutely loved.  Our vegetarian friends at the table enjoyed the Kasespatzle (noodles topped with bier cheese and lots of onions), the creamy coleslaw, and red sauerkraut.  Another friend had a large salad which arrived sans the salmon topping but the waitress very swiftly brought out a freshly grilled piece.  Everyone loved their food.\\n\\nI ordered a piece of their layered chocolate cake (supposedly made with five different kinds of chocolate) for my dad and the server kindly found a birthday candle in the back to make it festive. The cake is very rich and worth the calories. \\n\\nOur server was very friendly and efficient, and earned major points in my eyes for being able to hear her customers over the loud music.  At no point did the bustling atmosphere seem to distract her.  She earned a very generous tip for her upbeat attitude and professional service.\\n\\nMy only real criticism would be about the attitude of the young woman at the front desk acting as hostess.  Her face was frozen in an absolutely lifeless expression and acted as if she did not want to be there.  When I told her that we would be a party of 7 altogether, with the four others arriving at any minute, her response was \\"We won't seat you until half of your party is here.\\"  I said, trying to have some humor,, \\"There are 3 of us here already but we don't have the half person....\\" (half of 7 being 3 1/2, right?)  The hostess stared at me like I was speaking a foreign language and again repeated her statement that she wouldn't seat me until half of my party was there. I said, \\"I know, I heard you the first time but if you want half of a party of 7, that would be 3 1/2 people and that's impossible, so can't you seat us with 3?\\"  She just continued to stare at me and another female employee, who was watching this awkward exchange, leaned in with a smile and said, \\"We can seat you with 3\\" and her expression indicated she understood that the hostess was being quite rude (or at least being deliberately dense).  At that moment, our fourth person came over from where she'd been waiting at the bar and the stoic faced hostess said, \\"Oh alright, I did not know you had a fourth person already here.\\"  Wow.  I wonder, how does one  say the word \\"stupid\\" in German?!  That unfriendly employee should NOT be on the front line at the restaurant as she makes a very bad first impression.

His deli chef is a super nice guy.  We've spent hundreds of dollars there buying all sorts of products from them.\\n\\nSo why did I only give them 2 stars?  For two reasons.  First, Pete kept saying that he will increase the selection of meats in a couple of weeks.  Well, it's been a few \\"couple of weeks\\" now, and the selection is still slim.  Second, we went in to buy ground veal the other day.  The deli chef said they are out of ground veal and Pete can ground some up for me.

So I walked over to Market Meats on W. 4th, who's also out of ground veal, but quickly offered to ground some up for me on the spot.

I hadn't had high expectations for this place, but was startled by how good everything was. I mean, lentil soup typically isn't anything to write home about, but this was surprisingly tasty. The crab cakes were crab-rich and just lightly fried, very delicate and flavourful.

We went at 7pm on a Thursday, and did not have to wait at all to be seated in the downstairs dining area.\\n\\nMy overall experience was a mixed bag, and here are some reasons why:\\n\\nThe good:\\n\\n-Unique atmosphere with live music and what I assume is a close to authentic German beer hall feel. It's a lot of fun.\\n\\n-Ample parking at the Grandview Yard parking garage.\\n\\n-The beer and food pricing is very reasonable. A 1 liter (~35 oz) jug of their Hofbrau lager was only $8.86. Their giant pretzel appetizer was $9.49. Their sausage sampler was $14.99.\\n\\n-The beer is pretty good. With that said, their lager is a typical European lager. Much more bitter than a typical American lager like Budweiser. This is a good thing, as I prefer Euro lagers to American lagers. If you hate bitter beer though, you might not like their lager. I assume their Hefeweizen isn't quite as bitter. Hofbrau beers are available in bottles at your local grocery stores... it might be a good idea to try one before you go and order a 1 liter jug.\\n\\n-Guys will probably appreciate the outfits worn by the waitresses here. Ladies however may find this annoying.\\n\\nThe bad:\\n\\n-Their food isn't as good as Schmidt's. It's not bad overall, but if you don't think the food is amazing after downing a liter of beer, you're probably never going to find the food amazing. The pretzel was good. The sausage was so-so. The saurkraut was straight up not good as it wasn't sour at all... maybe it got too mixed in with the mashed potato, but the saurkraut tasted a lot like the mashed potato..\\n\\n-The service still has teething issues. Our server completely messed up our check when splitting it. This was a quick fix however. I expect service to continue to improve as this is a new restaurant. \\n\\n-The beer hall seating is probably too loud to have any meaningful conversation. So this probably isn't a good choice for a date. Also not so good with kids.  \\n\\n-From what I've read on other reviews, the wait time here can be insane. My experience was fine since I didn't have to wait, but if I had to wait 1 hour to eat here, I'd probably be more disappointed.\\n\\nEdit: I had previously mentioned that I felt my beer was underpoured.

The first time was about 2 years ago with a group of girls and I was very impressed with the food and service.  We sat by the windows and ordered mostly pasta dishes and wine.  Overall I was really impressed with the food-everything was fresh and flavorful.\\n\\nThe second time was about 3 weeks ago and the experience was overall negative.  My friend had just moved back to Boston from Florida, so a group of us went here on a Tuesday night to catch up.  I suggested it because I had such a great experience the first time, and thought it would be a great place to have a nice dinner and a few drinks.  They seated us in the back by the kitchen which was not ideal, and the surrounding floor area was dirty.  The waitress came over to take our drink orders and we decided to split a bottle of wine between 3 of us.  She asked for IDs but when she got to my friend who had just moved, refused to even look at it and declared rather rudely that they do not take out of state IDs (she still had a FL license).  We asked if this was a restaurant rule and she said it was.  I would have thought \\"fair enough\\" and moved on but here's where it got confusing- a few minutes later another waitress came over to help with the bread/drinks and started rambling something about how it had to do town \\"blue laws, etc.  I found this odd as the other waitress had told us it was a house rule and she was clearly telling us something completely different.  I grew up in the area and have never experienced this before.  Considering we are all in our mid-twenties, it was a Tuesday night, and we were looking to split 1 bottle of wine between 3 people, we hardly looked suspicious.  I was mostly upset with the way the two waitresses handled it rather than the fact that my friend could not drink wine.  \\n\\nOur food then took forever to come out and when it did, was not very impressive.  We all ordered pasta dishes and it was nothing special.  I wonder if they have changed their recipe/chefs/both since the last time I had been there, as the quality was not nearly up to par. I agree with someone else on here who said the bread was nothing special- tough, dry and flavorless.  \\n\\nYou may have an entirely different experience if you get different servers, but don't expect the food to blow you away.

There's a guitarist, keyboard player, drum player, and a vocalist (usually female).  It's best to make reservations in order to get a seat closer to the stage or you will end up sitting in the back,, or possibly not even getting a seat because the limited seating.  There's a $5 cover charge and a $15 minimum purchase, but who can complain about that when you're enjoying the smooth vocals and musical notes all night long.  There is a good selection of authentic food items on their menu, as well as a list of cocktails and wine.  I have yet to sample the food except for the Pecan Bread Pudding, which is to die or.

My favorite is still the Enchiladas de Pipian, but there are so many wonderful looking things on the menu that I have to squeeze in a new experience once in a while.  \\n\\nWent on Friday night and our group decided to start with the QUESO GRINGO. Mmmm good.  A subtle hint of sauteed onion and/or shallots.  White cheese . . . creamy . . . delicious.  \\n\\nI decided to try the CHILE EN NOGADA.  The menu says the sauce is served cold, and thank goodness it's not.  Mine arrived a little more like room temperature.  For me the problem is that a cool sauce on top of (or under) a hot dish just immediately drops the temperature of the hot food, which is not my preference.  The sauce seemed a bit gritty and not as creamy as I would have liked, but it was tasty.  Not my favorite, but glad I tried it.\\n\\nI guess that I just didn't get my fix on Friday night, so I had to go back on Sunday afternoon and order the ENCHILADAS de PIPIAN.   Ahhhhh.  Now I feel better.  Also ordered a ToGo plate for my son.  He selected the ENCHILADAS de CARNITAS.  When I asked later if it was good, he said, \\"Yeah, it was good.  No, it was VERY good.\\"  He wants to try the ENCHILADAS de JAIBA next time.  \\n\\nAnd don't forget to order a couple of their delicious frozen margaritas to enjoy with the chips and award winning hot sauce.  \\n\\nAlso, if you're going on a weekday, they often have Groupon Now deals ($10 for $20).  Even if you're alone, you could probably order your meal and one to go.

Lure is one of only a handful of seafood restaurants in Atlanta. Located in midtown next to South City Kitchen, you can easily miss Lure and walk right past it if you're not looking. The building itself is beautifully built and designed with a rustic/cabin feel but with modern elements. We made reservations the same day but there were only early reservations available at the high tops.\\n\\nThere are quite a few things on the menu with tapas type dishes for the appetizers (including both cold and hot options) and a healthy number of entrees for you to choose from. We went with the alligator gumbo and the octopus/pork lettuce wraps to start. The alligator gumbo was delicious but a little soupier than I had expected. It has some spice to it but not overpowering. The lettuce wraps come with about 6 \\"leaves\\" and you add to it some flat rice noodles, octopus, pork and sweet chili glaze. It's a fusion of Asian flavors that made it a winner.\\n\\nFor entrees we had the lobster roll and the swordfish. The swordfish had some Asian influence as well that was light and nicely complemented the fish. Swordfish can be dry but this was nicely done. The lobster roll was delicious but nothing surprising there... hard to mess up a lobster roll. The desserts here were the stars however. Although we ordered the coconut tres leches cake, we were given the chocolate layer cake which was actually excellent. The fried crullers are a must (a hybrid of churros and fried donuts) and are served with a berry jam. \\n\\nThis was a decent experience and while the dishes were delicious, I'm not sure I was surprised by any of the main entrees. The dessert, however, definitely deserved some attention and I might even consider coming here just for those. Parking is a challenge here although they do have valet. Parking across the street is $15 serving both Lure and South City Kitchen. This is a dressier place and while I don't think they enforce the dress code, you'll look out of place even if you come in with shorts or a t-shirt."},{"name":"NY Bagel & Deli","address":"5001 Gateway Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I saw NY Bagel & Deli in my neighborhood being built before it opened and was very excited to see how it would turn out.\\nEver since it opened up I've been going here everyday for a quick, top quality and cheap delicious meal.

I politely reminded our waitress that we were still waiting for the Escargot, and she abruptly informed us it would be out shortly. About 15 minutes later, our waitress returned with our entrees.

We are talking wrapped around the building, out the door slammed.  Late night Cook-Out runs are one of my fondest memories of college.  Honestly I would ask their peanut butter fudge milkshake to be a bridesmaid one day if it were socially acceptable, but man this Cook-Out is cray.\\n\\nAll that said, Cook-Out is well worth the wait and then some.  It is to the Atlanta fast food scene what everyone's favorite Antico is to pizza.  The hotdog, Cook-Out style, is uh-maze-ing.  Seasoned fries, hush puppies, or a quesadilla for a side?  Don't mind if I do!  Perhaps you fancy a burger with coleslaw or a barbeque sandwich instead?  Also an option!  It's open until 4:00 AM and the amount of food you get here for dirt cheap is not even funny.  The best part though - 40 flavors of handspun milkshakes!  Aside from Cook-Out, I don't think I've had a milkshake anywhere else in at least 20 years.  I don't really even like milkshakes, but the milkshakes at Cook-Out are out of this world good, especially the peanut butter fudge.  I will admit that I have strayed once or twice to the mint Oreo, peanut butter banana, and eggnog, but every time I realize my sin and go back to old faithful, my beloved Cook-Out peanut butter fudge milkshake.  \\n\\nFor those who are lucky enough to have experienced Cook-Out before, it's not the standard two drive-thru lines, possibly an old Checkers setup that you're used to.

Other ingredients are sourced from Central Florida's small organic farms.\\n\\nThe Design and Decor of Primo is a Mediterranean setting, with the earthy colors of wood, stone and copper. There is an ambiance of colors as green, gold, amber, and rust offer an elegant, but casual atmosphere through the soft textured wall coverings, carpeting, window treatments, and fabrics. Special details include Venetian light fixtures, a mosaic entry, and an exhibition kitchen that creates a warm, yet sophisticated dining experience. \\n\\nHere are a few examples of Chef Kelly's master culinary skills that you will find on display at Primo, Orlando Grande Lakes.\\n\\nSlow Cooked & Grilled Octopus with lima beans, artichokes, calabrian pesto, 'nduja sausage and smoky potato chips.\\n\\nCold Smoked Tuna Tartare with tonatto sauce, confit tomatoes, mint, sesame oil, bottarga, crispbreads.\\n\\nFarmer Salad primo lettuces, garlicky levain croutons, house cured bacon, soft poached whisper creek farm egg, white balsamic vinaigrette.\\n\\nSquid Ink Linguini  made with\\"Frutti Di Mare\\"calamari, jonah crab, rock shrimp, clams, charred pepper, tasso ham, pimenton crumb.\\n\\nSaut√©ed Scaloppine of Pork Saltimbocca in a sage infused mushroom-madeira jus with prosciutto, spinach and roasted garlic mashed potato.\\n\\nCaramello with a caramel pate choux-caramelized hazelnut gelato and toasted caramel marshmallow."},{"name":"Island Fin Poke Company","address":"1450 Tuskawilla Rd","city":"Winter Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"Always great service, fresh food and plenty of options to build your perfect poke bowl."},{"name":"Osaka Japanese Steak House","address":"3847 Lake Emma Rd","city":"Lake Mary","stars":"3","text":"As mentioned in other reviews this is a poor man's Kobe.

I'm highly disappointed with this place, I was very excited to try it based on the menu and reviews. I pass it everyday to and from work, but I must say I did not feel welcome here. I haven't felt passive aggressive discrimination like this in a long time.\\n\\n The experience started at valet, I pulled up at the front door and waited, valet sat in his car and stared at me for a minute or two so drove around to see if there was self parking, there was but it was way too far to walk in the rain in heels. I drove around and stopped at valet again. He finally got out of his mustang and said \\"I'm sorry, I didn't think you were dining here\\". I drive a fairly new nice car, at first I didn't really think anything of it. I went in and sat at the bar adjacent to a bartender with short brown hair, she didn't even acknowledge me, walked back and forth twice before saying \\"someone would be right with you\\". A few minutes later the other bartender, short with blonde hair stopped by and immediately asked if I wanted to start with water, no offer of a drink, just water. I requested bottled and it was delivered. Another few minutes went by and the bartender with brown hair asked if I would be eating, I said yes and she tossed me a menu and kept it moving. The menu literally slapped down on the counter as she walked away. It wasn't even like they were busy, I was one of maybe 6 people. A long time later another bartender or cocktail server, black curly hair, came behind the bar and asked if I'd been told about the features. She explained the bone in filet and wagyu steak. I ordered a cocktail from her. Next the brunette approached me again and said \\"are you ready?\\", I told her I was still deciding if I wanted to eat here. As I sat with my drink I just got more and more turned off and disappointed, I paid my tab and went further down the street where I felt welcome. Not sure if I'll return, I feel bad leaving my review based on my bar experience but it was more than enough to think twice about coming back.

Meianna is the only one that I have visited. It recently opened up a Seattle location on MLK in South Seattle recently which piqued my interest.\\n\\nThe Meianna in Portland is located in Fubonn Shopping Center which is the largest Asian mall in Oregon. It is a bit depressing to visit though since many of the spaces here are vacant.\\n\\nThe bakery which is across from Fubonn Supermarket is rather small, but it does offer a lot of goodies. They have items like breads, cakes and pastries. Though some of their offerings are a bit different from the usual Chinese bakery assortment.\\n\\nThe pricing here for the breads and pastries is quite good. Cheaper than Seattle area Chinese bakeries and you don't need to pay tax here either. I tried a couple items from here including a pineapple and sweet potato bun. The pineapple bun was okay, but the sweet potato one was really delicious.\\n\\nThe one thing that makes me give a three instead of a four is that some items did not seem that fresh and soft when I was picking them out. Particularly the breads which felt a bit hard. Though I think a quick zap in the microwave would make them just like new and out of the oven. A counterpoint to the freshness point was that the sweet potato bun kept quite well in fridge. It was nearly a week since it was bought, but it tasted great when I consumed it.\\n\\nFound Meianna to be pretty comparable in quality to the Seattle area Chinese bakeries I frequent.

As I walked in the hostesses were very attentive and escorted me to the table. Our server went through the menu in detail and had great customer service. \\n\\nWe ordered many dishes as it was a big group. However, I will focus on the dishes I tried. I started with a beef carpaccio which was very delicious thinly sliced beef, salad on top with an aioli drizzle. For my main course I went with the braised short ribs. The dish was layered with mash potatoes, carrots and peas, one piece of short rib and a nest of fried onions. The beef was very tender, everything was seasoned perfectly. You wouldn't have though it would be filling but you'd be wrong. For dessert we ordered Del's Delight. I highly recommend saving room for dessert. Delicious, melt in your mouth molten cake with ice cream. I'd go back just for the ice cream. \\n\\nAfter dinner the birthday girl and a few friends stayed to have a night cap at the bar.

However, Little Sheep seems to fall short. The broth is ESSENTIAL to the hot pot experience. If you don't have a broth that is delicious then you're already being set up for a bad time. Little Sheep has little variation when it comes to broths: Regular, Spicy and Tomato (which I believe is the vegetarian option). The spicy well, isn't much different from the regular. It's actually the SAME BROTH but loaded to the max with peppers, making it especially hard to eat. Again with little variation. The broth here could use some improvement. However, I really liked the ordering process where you are provided a sheet with HUGE selections items and you can choose if when you want them to come out; during the first phase of your meal or second, or third. Little Sheep is AYCE so this works well when you don't have a lot of table space. We came here with a large party of 7 so it was definitely a challenge to accommodate us with only 1 burner and such a small table. I believe the table we had was the largest that they had. Not sure though. It was a battle fighting with space and other dishes on the table while eating. The quality of the meats, and noodles were great but it was just difficult to enjoy the meal overall in such a cramped set up. The broth being sub-par did not help either. I definitely would give Little Sheep another chance, but not until they offer more options with the broths."},{"name":"Sushi Boat","address":"21900 Willamette Dr","city":"West Linn","stars":"2.5","text":"Another new addition to the West Linn Central Village.

My guy even gave the salmon roll a try so I was duly impressed. For those not into sushi, they do have a small selection of bento boxes and fruit bowls.

I think sweet chili sauce should be served with every meal.  \\n\\nSmall selection of beer (Asahi, Kirin and Sapporo), wine, sake and sodas. The prices ranged from $1.50 - $3.00 for the standard items. Chef's special rolls were in the $6 - $15 range. The servers were very sweet and prompt. Nice place for a casual lunch or dinner.

There is a focus on offering \\"healthy\\" ramen with organic ingredients. One notable offering is bamboo charcoal ramen for instance. The menu consists of numerous varieties of ramen and a selection of sides.\\n\\nI decided to try out the shoyu ramen ($9.55) and the pork rice bowl ($3.30). The ramen was good, but in a different way than other bowls of ramen I have had. It was the total opposite of a rich bowl of tonkotsu ramen. Although it is healthier, it still had flavor. The pork in the ramen was good, though I have had better. Same thing with the noodles, good not great. It wasn't quite the right level of chewiness that I like.\\n\\nThe pork rice bowl here is also a bit different from the typical version. I quite liked it because it had ingredients like lotus root, carrots and strips of dried seaweed. You can actually feel good eating this dish because it is nutritious. Quite honestly, I think I enjoyed the pork rice more than the ramen.\\n\\nEating ramen at Motomachi was a nice change from the typical bowl of ramen, but I wouldn't give up on the tonkotsu.

With one of each of the sauces, and  ordered a side dish and got offered a soup or salad . We opted with the salads .  When the food arrived the medallions were no bigger than a chicken nugget and they were undercooked so had to send back. The mashed potatoes were average and the Caesar salad was soggy and has smushed tomatoes in it . (I've never seen tomatoes in Caesar  salad  but that's beside the point ) if your going to add them atleast don't have them smashed threw the salad. Overall such a disappointing dinner . Then we get the bill and we see we were charged 14$ for salad?!??? We informed the waitress that we were not paying for that since before they changed the menu it was included in the meal and we were not informed that they were a separate charge since we were offered soup or salad we figured nothing changed .

Here are a few reasons why.\\n\\nMargaritas:  The Original margarita is the best margarita we have had anywhere and for 6 bucks the best bargain around.  Always potent (usually need to stop at 2) and always tasty (no sickly sweet and sour mix).\\n\\nService:  All the servers there are really friendly and attentive.  Having said that the front room always gets the better servers so we try to sit in there when possible.  Servers are always willing to share recommendations and have never failed us yet.  A number of them also recognize us by sight and even if we don't have one of our regular servers they are sure to make sure whoever our server is that night knows our likes. \\n\\nFood:  I've always been satisfied with what we've eaten. We tend to stay away from the combo platters and order something specific and have always found it tasty.  The Pollo Colichi is one of our favorites and something we never would have tried if not recommended to us.  Also, remember to ask for mushroom salsa. It is not on the menu but just ask and they will bring it.  I am not even a mushroom fan and I love it.\\n\\nKid Friendly:  Kids are always welcome and cared for at 3 Margaritas.  Everyone acts happy to see the kids and not annoyed that they are there. Besides their normal spicy salsa they also bring a mild salsa to the table for the kids. I don't know why more places don't offer a mild salsa for small children.  My son eats it up by the spoonful.  They have also been careful to alter dishes when needed to handle my son's dairy allergy.\\n\\nThe Louisville location is our favorite followed by the orchard location and then the 120th location.  For whatever reason we haven't had much luck with the 92nd ave location.  It may be a chain but each location is owned by one of the children of the original owner so it is still a family restaurant."},{"name":"Hale Pele","address":"2733 NE Broadway","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"We have visited this bar for special occasions and have really enjoyed it in the past.

Visiting this tiki bar has always been a treat for the very special occasions, so having a server ruin a special night was more than frustrating. \\n\\nShe was cold, rude, naggy, and gave off judgmental vibes. If this was not her intentions, then she is truly not fit for a customer service position and shouldn't be working at a tiki bar. We were perfectly polite and maintained throughout the whole evening so there was absolutely no reason for her attitude. It wasn't busy either. \\n\\nSomething else to be noted, we requested a particular drink at a particular strength (which you pay extra for) and she strongly recommended a different strength. We had come specifically for certain drinks and were by no means intoxicated for her to be suggesting something different than we requested. When we declined her suggestion, she seemed offended. The drink she brought us (in which we have had before) was not the strength that we had asked for. It was obvious she hadn't respected our request. \\n\\nWhile I totally appreciate a bar and it's servers being on top of monitoring quality experience and alcohol consumption-we gave her no reason to be concerned. And furthermore, we have to pay for the extra strength! \\n\\nImmediately, upon entry of the bar, our group got a bad vibe from her and tried to ignore it. However, after our experience, we were honestly being discriminated against from the beginning.  I've seen similar reviews on Yelp and I wonder if it's the same server. I won't say names but she is the brunette with bangs. \\n\\nIt's unfortunate because we have really enjoyed this bar. As someone who frequented Trader Vic's when it was around, finding this bar has been a treasure.

To be honest with you since they have the standard pricing that all Kobes have, that makes it a pretty fair deal for all you're getting.\\n\\nThe wait!  Oh boy....we've all seen it.  You drive by a Kobe and there are 30 people standing around outside and you're thinking...never gonna do that.  We found out that if you join their app rewards program that kids eat free on Tuesdays....well that's a game changer!

The last time I was in that building was in the early 90's when there was a place called Burtucci's (or something like that).

We got a dude tonight.  He couldn't catch the shrimp in his hat, dropped the egg by accident, brought out the wrong food for many of us and really the worst part was that he didn't do much of a show at all.  The table behind us had another guy that had them all rolling.  This is par for the course; they can't all be the best show of your life.\\n\\nConclusion is on the food.  I don't eat eggs, so they make me fried rice and I get first dips pre egg mix in.  It was good as always is but not too heavy on soy, which is a good thing.  The veggies were amazing....however, the steak and chicken.....ehhhhhhhh.  No flavor at all.  It happens from time to time but for $25-20 each, it should be tasty.

Do you realize that what you're basically saying is \\"Help, I can see poor people!!!\\"? The \\"UnSafeway\\"? There's nothing unsafe about this store, you guys are just so uncomfortable around the working poor and/or homeless that you imagine your safety is being threatened when it isn't.\\n\\nOne reviewer said this is \\"The single worst grocery store I've ever set foot in.\\" Are you twelve years old? Have you only been in four grocery stores, all of them in Beaverton or Clackamas? Get real, people. This is a fine store, tirelessly serving my working-class neighborhood, and treating the local homeless community with some degree of compassion, giving them easy access to castoffs from the deli and bakery, only to hear hipster transplants who grew up in the 'burbs and are having their college-age brush with poverty complain that the parking lot makes them sooo uncomfortable. \\n\\nI love King Neighborhood, and our Safeway."},{"name":"Shaking Crab - Boston Common","address":"140 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I've had better Cajun food in the city, I had 1 lb of shrimp with potatoes and a side of rice.

The wine list is extensive and the options by the glass are unheard of. Most of the world's influential wine regions are adequately represented. Prices are quoted for 6 oz glasses and full bottles.  BUT, you can customize a tasting menu out of anything on the menu to suit your tastes. Simply divide the glass price by the number of ounces you want. I recommend minimum 2 oz per tasting.  Every bottle is injected with inert gas (like argon) to preserve freshness between service. Great system. \\n\\nI put together a tasting of chianti riserva, Nebbiolo, and Termpranillo at a very reasonable price. My wife splurged on the Ruinart Champagne.

This caught my eye and I had to give it a try. They weren't fully ripe so it gave a slight crunch factor. The marinade on the al pastor is on point and loaded with flavor. My plate had to weigh at least a couple pounds and be easily split into two meals. Portions were more than generous for the money. As for my burrito it tasted awesome as well, had the al pastor with corn and mango salsa. Keeping it simple sometimes goes a long way. \\n\\nOverall a very solid place to grab a burrito and more.

Although, we were visiting from Hawaii, so we are definitely cold weather wimps.\\n\\nMinus one star because the guy who was actually torching the marshmallows was not very friendly.

Extraordinary views of Boston, lots of options to eat, drink, and even dance! But, the past few years it has gone way done. A great opportunity for the new restaurant to make its mark!\\n\\nThe wait: Crowded on a beautiful Friday evening with an 1 hour and 20 minute wait for outside. While we waited for any table to open up, we ordered a few glasses of Vanderpump Rose (by the glass it's pretty pricey) and enjoyed the weather, views, and company.\\n\\nThe service: Since they did just open, I am giving them a chance to get the service up to full speed. On a side note: (1) server took forever to greet us (2) our drinks took forever to get to the table (3) she needed help to open up a bottle of wine (4) she barely checked back on us after brining over entrees and appetizers (5) seemed a bit overwhelmed\\n\\nThe food: Here is where they deserve 5 stars. We ordered the shrimp cocktail, delish and very, very fresh! I ordered the Grilled Sea Bass, was extremely tasty, although one piece was undercooked which I sent back, and they remade me another one. My friend got the Tuna, which was also very good! Applaud!!!\\n\\nThe bill: Definitely a pricey place, but I guess you pay for what you get; overlooking the Marina and ocean views. A cool spot to bring anyone who is out of town.\\n\\nThe ambience: Beautiful decor, with high ceilings, and indoor trees that have lights wrapped around them. Gorgeous gold and brass lights that look like they belong in a Venetian magazine!\\n\\nOverall: Highly recommend checking out this new restaurant that graced Marina Bay just over a week ago.

The environment was really well done, which made getting settled at our table relatively easy.\\n\\nNot only was this visit at the end of our day, it was also the last day of our vacation which meant we were used to the high quality of Disney food and service throughout the WDW Resort.

By the time the waiter came and took our drink orders, we were ready to order our meals as well. Adding to at least my husband's frustration was the fact that they were out of artichokes - which meant that all of the pizzas he had picked out for himself weren't able to be ordered. Thankfully, he does enjoy pepperoni pizza so he just joined in with the one that our friends had ordered. With that - the waiter was off to get our drinks and bring us some bread & oil.\\n\\nFor my drink, I ordered the vodka lemon drop. I wasn't really in the mood for wine, and the refreshing crispness of lemon sounded just about perfect. I was not at all disappointed when the drink was delivered. It was definitely refreshing, was ice cold and not at all watered down. I made sure to nurse this delicious libation throughout dinner because I'm sure it was deceptive in its non-alcoholic tastiness. Our friend Laura ordered a bellini, and the boys split a pitcher of the Italian beer (made specially for the American restaurant - talk about knowing your audience).\\n\\nSoon enough after enjoying some bread and booze, the pizza came out. The first thing that struck me was that everything looked delicious... and the size of the pepperoni pizza that came out to our table. I don't remember what the word for it was on the menu (the online ones I could find called it a \\"half-meter\\" - the menu did not say that) - but the darned thing was HUGE.\\n\\nGigantic Pepperoni Pizza... for three? Maybe times ten...\\nI had ordered the Pizza Margherita because every review I had read about Via Napoli raved about it. People had said they were expecting one thing but then got this awesome pizza that was surprisingly tastier than they thought it would be. I will say that when it was placed in front of me - it certainly looked like it was going to live up to its reputation. The sauce looked good, the mozzarella was melted perfectly, and the basil was in good proportion to the cheese and looked fresh. I was ready to dig in.\\n\\nI picked up my first piece and was ready for that wonderful thin crust crispiness that I have grown to love on my pizza... and was met with a relatively soggy center crust. The sauce was warm, the cheese was tasty and the perfect consistency, and the basil lent that subtle hint of flavor that brought the flavors all together. But my crust... huge let-down. Because I enjoyed the overall taste and the outer crust was cooked perfectly - I did eat the whole individual order that I had requested. However - I was totally let down by the bottom layer of crust and knew, in that moment, that there was a huge difference between me and the people who had written the numerous reviews I had read singing the praises of this pizza.\\n\\nThere's something about growing up in a heavily populated Italian-American area of the country that lends itself to great pizza existing in plentiful amounts. This means that to be competitive, pizzerias must perfect their craft and get the crust perfect. Even on a thin crust pizza, the base crust has to be crispy in order to sustain the sauce and cheese and inevitable grease that develops when the cheese & toppings are cooked. Since thin-crust style pizzerias are seemingly on every corner up here and the biggest players are Pizzeria Regina, Sal's, & Papa Gino's - all known for their great crust, near-perfect sauce and all some of my favorite places to get a slice or two - I know what I like in pizza. And a huge requirement for me is a perfectly crisp non-burned crust that can hold up to the goods on top of it.\\n\\nVia Napoli, unfortunately, fell short in this area.\\n\\nAfter we ate, Steve confessed that he had heard similar feedback on the pizza. He just felt bad because I was so excited to try it that he felt badly when he heard it... so he didn't mention it. I'm glad he didn't because if nothing else, reading about this pizza did get me in the door of the restaurant. I did truly like the atmosphere, the menu had tons of selection and yummy-looking food, the drinks were delicious, the toppings were spot-on, and once our waiter came over he was attentive the rest of the time we were there. All of those things in mind - I would absolutely consider eating there again on a future visit to the park.\\n\\nI would just NOT order the pizza."},{"name":"Bon's Off Broadway","address":"2451 Nanaimo St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I'll only go here for breakfast.

So then I tried the Sicilian pizza, thinking that must be Bostone's specialty. Again: Fine. Nothing special.\\n\\nWhat brings this down to one star is the service sucks. It takes a while to get your food, because they warm the individual slices in the oven, but they don't do a great job of that. My Sicilian slice was literally COLD when I got it home. I live less than one block away from Bostone. Why did I have to wait 5 minutes for them to heat it up if they were bringing it barely above room temp?\\n\\nThere was also the memorable occasion when I ordered a pizza with pepperoni on it, and waited about 30 minutes in the shop for it (all of six feet away from the guy who took my order). I finally asked for an ETA and was told they'd run out of pepperoni. Since the cashier couldn't remember if I'd been the one who ordered it, he didn't want to say anything to me. So I guess the burden was on me to finally get pissed off about the long wait and ask, so they could substitute something for the pepperoni and finally start making my pizza. WTF?

Unfortunately for us we left displeased for two reasons:\\n1) bahn mi was made of different bread than we receive at Ha VL. It was still good but not as good as the original. I know, I know... Big deal right... Maybe they ran out of the normal bread and had to substitute....this leads me to my next complaint \\n2) THE TURMERIC SOUP WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. The first thing we noticed was that the color was more of a clear broth with a large pool of oil on top. The next was that the noodles were white and not the yellowish orange color we usually receive. The oil on top turned out to be hot pepper oil that overtook the flavor of the soup. The meats were different and it appeared to have less in it. The soup was horrible(compared to what we hold as standard)  and my wife and I left about halfway through our bowls. \\n\\nWe won't be going back for Turmeric soup again.

Made reservations same day for an early Saturday dinner. Arrived a few minutes early and were seated promptly. The restaurant was empty with the exception for one other larger party that was being seated as we walked in. The space itself quite pretty. Classy without being stuffy, and well spaced out so you don't feel cramped. I have dined at the Whistler location a few times, but I have to say this location feels much more chic.\\n\\nAll that being said: our server, however, was no where to be found for quite some time. He walked right by our table a number of times, checking on the large party beside us, without even making eye contact or asking us if we wanted something to drink.\\n\\nWhen our drink and appy order was finally taken, it was slow going to get anything on the table. We were ordering off the regular menu as well as ordering wine, so I was a little annoyed that we were being continually passed over by our server. \\n\\nThe appy platter is my absolute favorite. I know the items change depending on what the kitchen has, but this time around it was meh. The marinated mushrooms and bocconcini was delicious as usual, the prawns we over cooked and rubbery. I think they had probably been sitting for quite some time. We both ordered the lobster carbonara and were both disappointed. Although it was a pretty good sized portion, there was very little lobster in the servings. The sauce was a decent carbonara, creamy and buttery - just a little on the salty side for my taste. I will point out that our server did not do a quality check, nor did he ask if we were ok for drinks until we were ready to order our dessert. \\n\\nWe finished the meal with a tiramisu which was average as well. \\n\\nAll in all, I think the poor service killed the whole the experience.

Our drinks took 30 minutes to arrive, well after we had started on the appetizer (east meets west tuna) which for $16 was extremely underwhelming. 20 minutes later entrees arrived however plates had never been cleared from the appetizer. Runners had no clue who ordered what and placed food incorrectly all around the table. We then waited another 5 minutes to be given steak knives, which were thrown on the table. The waitress did not wait for us to cut into the proteins in order to ask if things were made to our liking but instead tossed the knives and ran away. Of the 4 main courses ordered, only 1 - mine - was cooked correctly. The other 3 were sent back to the kitchen for the following reasons:\\n\\nPrime Rib (captains cut $35.50) - end part of cut was served and was entirely fat\\n1st Filet Mignon (ordered medium $34.99) - was entirely rare, bloody and cold in the center\\n2nd Filet Mignon (ordered medium well $34.99) - cooked medium rare with cool center and mildly bloody\\n\\nAfter 15 minutes of sitting there awkwardly and not having the server come back to check in on us my fiance walked over to the hostess and asked to speak with a manager. We then waited another 15 minutes for her to arrive. She looked approximately 20 years old and overwhelmed, but was apologetic and removed the 3 dishes, leaving me to eat my dinner alone. Another 20 minutes later dishes arrived and instead of serving new filets, the chef just tossed the old cuts onto the grill and re-served them - gross. Both filets again came out under cooked but every one was so famished at this point they ate what they could (edges and the side of mashed potatoes). Upon explaining the situation to the manager when she came back to ask about the food (as the waitress did not check on us)- we informed her that we were celebrating our new engagement and we are disappointed with the service and the food and were feeling less than special - we were promised to be taken care of. After lava cake dessert (which was served without entrees being cleared - again gross) the bill was thrown onto our table by the waitress (who never asked if we were ready for it or needed anything else) and to our amazement only had a $50 comp. REALLY?! $50?! We sent back 3 dishes, I was left to eat my celebratory dinner alone, we were on edge and upset the entire time and in response only 1.5 dishes were compted?! Unacceptable.\\n\\nThe whole experience was unbelievably terrible and instead of being a memorable and special occasion my engagement dinner was a nightmare and something I hope to forget. \\n\\nPlease do not give a place like this your business as they clearly do not really care about their customers at all."},{"name":"Happy Lamb Hot Pot","address":"485 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I would give 4.5.

Well, I can honestly say I was very pleasantly surprised by Spoleto's food as well as its ambiance. At it's core, it is a quick bite restaurant: flash cooked pastas, toppings thrown in a pan and heated, all mixed together, and served. Meals ready in 5 minutes or less. However, the sauces were delicious and the mix-in options were (relatively) fresh. Lots of vegetables - mushrooms, zucchini, artichoke hearts, onion fresh or saut√©ed, meats - sausage, ham, bacon, and more. To start, you had the option for your pan to be coated with olive oil or pesto; I was pleasantly surprised that the pesto did not have an up charge. I chose to upgrade to the gnocchi, knowing full well this is risky because poorly made gnocchi can ruin a meal. It was partially cooked before being flash boiled and they knew exactly how long to prepare it so it came out well cooked. Your meal comes with 6 freebies mixed in but I opted to add 3 additional mix ins which costs a whopping $1 (very reasonable when some places charge $1 for cheese on a burger!). The disappointment I had was the meat options. I also splurged for the prochiutto, which I was disappointed to see came directly from a package; not even the guise that it had been procured in a fresh-sliced fashion by going to the back to obtain it. They had four sauce options: marinara, Bolognese, Alfredo, and pesto.  They allowed us to mix and match, I opted for the \\"creamy pesto\\" mix of pesto and Alfredo. Even with all these upgrades, my meal came to $14 (cheapest option with no upgrades starts at $9). The servings could have been slightly larger for the price, but ultimately it was well made and left me feeling satisfied. If ever in the mood for pasta with a group of people with varying tastes, would definitely visit again.

I'm so happy to find a place that serves really good hot and sour that's not too soy saucy, too sour, or too thick without me actually having to make it at home myself. If there's something that I think Ah-Ma do well that I can comment on, it's the flavor. It's true for the hot and sour and definitely true for the Beef Noodle Soup. Both dishes were done really well in terms of delivering the complicated layered flavors without one element overpowering the dish... and none too greasy! it's too often that I run into an establishment that will make the beef noodle soup either too greasy or too bland... Ah-Ma's? probably the best I've had in America. It's authentic in flavor and the noodle is fresh and chewy.

Though you feel like you have been transported back to a different time, they are using hi-tech applications in the purchasing and food delivery. Dined during lunch time, and found the food to be quite good, with many healthy options. Do expect very long lines upon entering, but once inside things do tend to speed up with the use of the numerous order stations.  Since this place is quite new, the long lines might be there for quite some time.

We had reservations for a year! That is how crazy this place is for dinner. I think lunch is slightly easier to get in for, but dinner was just amazing! We checked in and we were about 15 minutes early because we wanted to do the walk up and look at the entryway! The bathrooms were with the theme and were decorative and clean. This place is extremely nice, but people tend to wear whatever they were walking around in the park that day so you won't feel out of place in shorts and running shoes if you feel so inclined. The Beast randomly walks through the ballroom and around which is amazing and turned me into a 5 year old. The decor is just amazing! Cherubs on the ceiling, massive chandeliers, and gorgeous chairs, but I did miss the expansive library! :-)  We had Salvador (Sal) as our waiter and if you can ask for him, I recommend it. He was one of the best, most personable servers that I have ever had. He made the experience. He was fun and happy , gave great recommendations, and never let my drink go empty. He was running around the entire time we were there so he meant business. He is just kick ass to be honest. Waiters can easily make or break an experience (check out my review of Fulton's in the same week lol) so I was just really happy with Sal. We got the meat and cheese board along with some rolls that came to the table. The rolls were destroyed (both baskets that came). They are like bolillo rolls and were really yummy! We also ordered the \\"cool guy glasses\\" with our sodas. They light up chalice with a castle border! It is so fun and I suggest it to anyone young or young at heart. We all got them. All of us ordered the strip steak with pommes frites which is just French for French fries and I cleaned my plate. The steaks were\\nCooked to perfection. 3 well-done and 1\\nMedium. It was just wonderful and made me cross my eyes! Oh, and our napkins were tightly wrapped roses! You also get to meet the beast and take pictures after your dinner which is fun! Anyway, I will come back because dinner was delicious with no hiccups. We also got dessert and of course, we ordered the grey stuff because we asked the dishes and they said it was delicious. It was okay, but nothing to write home about. It is more of a fun experience to order it and be able to interact with Beauty & the Beast. As always, with Disney, I was really impressed with all the details and fun elements that go into the theatrics of the dining experience. The only thing that made me mad was the one table next to us. They talked about work, business, the office, and how expensive everything was...the entire time and spoke fairly loud. Then they would look over at us to see if we were interested in their conversation. Why does one go to Disney and talk about work the entire time?

We were excited to see that there was a band setting up in the front of the restaurant when we first arrived. Our server told us that they would be performing \\"very soon,\\" which wasn't true since the band never got around to performing even after the hour and a half that we spent at the restaurant. The service shifted from being mediocre in the beginning to frustrating towards the end of the meal. The food at the buffet table tasted days old and seemingly microwaved, and the meats were poorly seasoned, overcooked and too salty. I wanted to really love this place, and I would if the food and service were significantly better, but after my experience, I can't say that I will be back.  \\n\\nWhen we finished eating, our server was inaccessible; she was chatting with a coworker for quite some time with her back facing us, far from the dining area. We needed to get our check, and it took us at least 15 minutes to get the attention of another server, who appeared irritated that she had to attend to a table that she wasn't assigned to. All we wanted was our check so that we could pay for our meal and leave. After the time we had already waited to hand in my credit card, I watched our substitute server go around to several different tables and then retreat into the kitchen for 10-15 more minutes before she finally came out. I had to approach her at the counter to remind her that she still had my card and that I hadn't yet been given the receipt to sign. Turns out, she hadn't even run my card through, and there were no apologies given for the inconvenience or for forgetting. As soon as we signed the check, we were beyond antsy and bolted for the door.

We weren't impressed with any of the appetizers we tried, but the pizza itself was fantastic. (Though we have since learned to ask them to cook it a bit longer because otherwise the fast pace can mean they sometimes pull it out a bit too early and the crust is too soft.)\\n\\nThe problem is, I wouldn't necessarily say the cost is worth what you get. I don't mean to imply that the pizza is of poor quality by any means, and it's certainly the best pizza you will ever get at Disney World (just... don't order the room service pizza... ever), the pizzas are on the small side and VERY expensive. One is probably good for two adults to split, but if you have more people than that, you're going to need more pizza. A large basic pizza is thirty bucks! Similarly, their drinks menu is mostly limited to really, REALLY expensive domestic beer or EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE cocktails, so it's not really a place you can relax and have a few drinks at with your dinner if you don't want the bill to skyrocket.\\n\\nThe bottom line is that while the food is very good, it is ENORMOUSLY expensive, but perhaps even more importantly, ENORMOUSLY noisy and busy for the classy Italian vibe it's trying to pull off. It's worth trying if you don't mind the cost and must have pizza, though please note that while sometimes they open up a quick-service window, in the past the pizza they serve there is NOT the same pizza you would get if you sat in the restaurant, so caveat emptor."},{"name":"Kiku Sushi","address":"4986 Kingsway","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3","text":"Have ordered delivery from here more times than I can count.

There's hummus and some sort of vinaigrette reppin' the savory side, and sweet potato and apple slices reppin' the sweet. I don't like alfalfa sprouts much, but this sandwich makes them okay in my book. Especially when there's avocado involved, which I love any time, any place, any sandwich.\\n\\nCrema has two other vegetarian sandwich offerings, the Thai Peanut and its grilled cheese. \\n\\nI loved the gingery, spicy and peanut flavors of the Thai Peanut sandwich, but felt like a key ingredient was missing. The baguette was good, and the crunch of the spicy napa slaw, peanuts, and some other sliced veggies was nice. But if there was something softer to balance out the crunchiness, something like slices of baked tofu, the sandwich would be even better. But the good flavors are already there.\\n\\nThe grilled cheese is good, and stands out from other grilled cheeses out there in that it uses Gruyere.

The rest are two-seater tables. Secondly, the staff there seem to all speak Japanese or some kind of English with a foreign accent. Finally, as a testament to Japanese efficiency they will prepare your order extremely quickly since the sooner you eat, the faster they can get you out of the door so the next diner can stuff their face with a delicious yet affordable meal. Therefore, don't take your date here for a long romantic dinner unless you want to make the Japanese very angry. \\n\\nI personally really like their Japanese curry rice. It's definitely more strong, thick and spicy (in a peppery way) than most curries that you've come across.

We made plans to go here a few weeks in advance so made a reservation through Open Table.  When we got there (had an 8:30p reservation) the place was pretty dead.  There were plenty of open tables and we were seated right away in the dark back corner of the restaurant.  Let me just emphasize, DARK.  We literally had to take out our cell phones to read the menu and we are young!  I cant imagine that older patrons would even be able to read it.  The darkness of the place only got worse as the night went on.  By the time we left it was basically dark in there.  When we went to the bathroom on our way out the lights were literally off. I'm not joking when I say that we couldn't see inside the stalls in the ladies room.  It was actually a little scary in there by yourself.  Not cool.\\n\\nAnyways, back to the rest of my review...The restaurant itself was pretty cool.  It was hip and trendy while still being casual which was nice.  Our waitress came over right away and asked for our drink order and said she would be back in a few minutes.  While she was gone, another waitress came over and asked for our drink order.  They seemed a little confused and disorganized but eventually we ended up with the second waitress.  She was very nice and attentive but a little strange at the same time. \\n\\nThe menu includes a good selection of small plates as well as a few entrees.  We decided to have a few small plates as our appetizers and then have entrees.  The small plates were delicious!  We got the pork belly, homemade potato chips and the  fried oysters.  All of them were very good and the portions were good sized even for small plates.  For entrees we got the WowBurger,  boneless fried chicken and the ribs.  The WowBurger was less than wow but good.  However, the two of us that ordered them asked to have them cooked medium and they were basically raw and barely warm.  Unfortunately, it took a few bites to realize just how under-cooked they were since it was so freakin dark in there!  Both of us complained and asked to have them cooked more so they took them back to the kitchen.  The manager came over to apologize which was nice and told us that they were going to cook us up brand new burgers and to save room for dessert because it was on them.  When the burgers came back they were the same ones we had originally (our few bites missing, same buns, sauce still on them, etc.) but were cooked a lot more and were pretty tasty in the end.  I'm sure they would have been a lot better had they been cooked the first time around.  When it came time for our free dessert, we weren't given a choice and ended up with a Nutella tart which was decent but nothing to write home about.\\n\\nOverall, this place was mediocre. I'm not sure how long they have been open but they certainly don't have their act together yet.  Seems like it has some good potential but they have some work to do before I would ever go back there.  If I did go back, I would stick to the small plates."},{"name":"Colosseum Pizza","address":"107 12th Street E","city":"North Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"This is simply the best pizza on the North Shore, and perhaps all of Vancouver.

I've had far worse dining experiences in my life but this place is not good, don't let the positive reviews fool you!  Anyone with half a palate will appreciate reading this first.  \\n\\nThe Good:  This place is located on the newish Market Street in Lynnfield which is becoming the place to be in the North Shore.  There's plenty to do around the restaurant and the actual interior of the place is bright and pretty clean.  \\n\\nThe Bad:  Oh boy where do I start!?  Well there's nothing like sitting down to start a meal and having the waitress start the conversation with \\"Sorry we don't have our liquor license yet so we can't serve beer and wine\\".  Lame!!!!  I especially can't stand when I ask a server what they recommend and they say \\"everything\\".  I sure as hell wouldn't recommend what I got to anyone!  So what did I get?  I got the ginger chicken udon.  The entire dish was blah.  The ingredients tasted cheap, and the cuts of chicken were not good.  They reminded me of one of the chinese chicken combos you could get at the mall for 5 dollars.  We also got the deep fried duck dumplings which tasted like they were thrown in the microwave and then served to us, they were edible but nothing to get excited about.  My friend got a soup, I can't remember which one but the broth tasted like hot dishwater, no flavor at all.  Our waitress was ok, we waited a long time after getting served to get the check.  She was nice enough, but was a young kid and lacked the experience needed to be in that role.  \\n\\nOverall:  My review is really for one and a half stars but that's not an option.  This place has a lot of competition in Market Street with Yard House, Kings, WholeFoods, Legal Bar, Panera, El Pollo Loco, etc.  They're busy now but I expect this place to struggle in the upcoming months as people realize every other place in Market Street is better than this one."},{"name":"Crema Cafe","address":"27 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"After a hefty dinner, we strolled.

Overhyped\\n\\nGetting \\"in\\"-  we kept checking for open reservations for about a year and were excited to finally get one after daily persistence on disney's awful website. When we arrived the workers were turning away people who had no reservations saying they were all full, (luckily we had a reservation). Upon entry we first noticed  an abundance of open tables, including an entire room that was EMPTY! So strange that they make people wait so long to eat here - maybe it's to build hype! \\n\\nOn to the food... Potato leak soup was watery, the Chicken Proven√ßals sauce was tasty but chicken was dry, the Braised pork was underwhelming, kids fish was overcooked and fries were soggy, kids \\"brochette\\" was a huge hard hunk of chicken on a stick yuck! All of the items were typical conveyor belt offerings which is what Disney is famous for. I also made the mistake of ordering my kids fruit punch after the waiter said it was a beverage option for them (so I assumed it was included in their meal) and was then charged $5 a cup because it's a \\"speciality drink\\". The ONLY reason I gave this absurd underwhelming dining experience 2 stars and not 1 is for the desserts which were pretty yummy and unique, we had the gray stuff and strawberry cheesecake cupcake. \\n\\nIn regards to the atmosphere - the main ballroom was under-decorated (except for a strange ceiling mural of un-cherub like creepy baby angels) and the tables are basically pushed on top of each other. The other dining room has the \\"magic rose\\" and slashed curtains and pictures, the third room has a statue of Belle and Beast and had a ton of tables available - this was the room that was completely empty. The restrooms are typical cheap disney and the lobby is huge, but offers no chairs because they want you to wait outside in the heat for some reason. We tried to wait in the lobby and were chased out. \\n\\nService - our waiter was strange and he also did not mention up-charges (like the fruit punch). My main problem though was how SLOW the service was! We got our soups right away but our main meal took at least 30 minutes. With 2 cranky kids the waiting was no fun.\\n\\nTheme- the restaurant is called \\"Be Our a Guest\\" however there was no \\"Be Our Guest\\" song playing or nothing to tie the namesake to the experience. Where was Luminere? Chip (the teacup)? Or even an appearance by Belle would have been nice. Beast walks in the ballroom every 20 minutes when they announce him and then he goes to his little area where you can get a photo with him before you exit. \\n\\nPrice- $160 bill! Overpriced as usual.\\n\\nIn conclusion, my recommendation is to avoid this restaurant until the hype wears off, if you really want to dine here.

I was not disappointed (in the reviews), and have no plans to return to Spice.\\n\\nStarting with the positive, though: the location can't be beat, and there is a nice ambiance inside.  We were in the private room in the back with wine bottles all along the wall.  The service was adequate (though there were over 20 of us at the table) and  the appetizers were tasty - the steak quesadilla actually had some spiciness to it.  Drinks were brought promptly and refills were offered.  The lobster bisque was excellent.  Up to this point in the meal things were going well and I thought that maybe all the poor reviews were flukes.  Then I got my steak.\\n\\nI had ordered the 16-ounce ribeye (medium rare) and was expecting a nice thick medium-rare cut of meat since Spice advertises itself as a \\"modern steakhouse\\".  What I actually got, though was medium-well to well-cooked steak that was so thin it almost looked as if it had been butterflied.  It was if it had been sliced lengthwise into two halves along its long axis.  When I cut into it there was no trace of red and I did not notice any juices.  It was well-marbled, however and the fat made up for some of the lack of juiciness on the inside.  In addition to being too thin and too well cooked, it tasted as if it had been covered with enough salt to raise my blood pressure several notches.  One of the others in our party had ordered the 6-oz fillet mignon and it too was overcooked.  Several others ordered the chateaubriand special and theirs seemed to be cooked to perfection."},{"name":"Xinh Xinh","address":"7 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I came here without that high expectations but was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food. \\n\\nI tried the Bo bun hue (no. 30) and the pho dac biet.

Portion size was just right - not too much noodles but generous with the other ingredients. I don't think this place uses (if at all) much msg too. \\n\\nOnly reason why I am giving this place 4 stars is because my pho did not come out piping hot. This is probably because the ingredients were simply assembled in the bowl without preheating and topped with hot soup that consequently cooled down quickly.

And delicious food at that.\\nI've been to Ah-Ma's twice now, all within the time span of 1 week. They've only been open for a few weeks now. The first time I tried the salt and pepper (fried) chicken nuggets, which were perfect. Nice breading, very flavorful. Also got the pork belly bao and beef noodle soup. The pork belly bao was delicious and about $4.50 which is pretty standard. FYI, I get annoyed when I order pork belly bao at a restaurant and it's only mediocre because that is a lot of saturated fat I'm putting into my belly, so it better be good! However, this one was totally worth it. Of course, it's the traditional Taiwanese version so it had pickled veggies and a sprinkle of peanut dust. The bun was soft and warm. \\n\\nThe beef noodle soup was a tad on the pricier side ($9) for what I'm used to, but then again this isn't Buford Highway; the rent in Midtown has to be higher. It did not disappoint. The broth was excellent and tasted like a lot of work and hours had been put into it. The noodles had a nice texture and soaked up all the flavor. The beef was tender. Portion size was decent.\\n\\nThe second time I visited, I tried a few new things, including the shrimp wonton soup, the fried pork ribs soup, and sticky cup rice which are all smaller portions and priced as such. The shrimp wontons and sticky cup rice were pretty good and felt like comfort food. The fried pork ribs I probably liked the least. I don't think serving it as a soup really worked in this instance. \\n\\nOur table wanted to order the beef noodle soup (this was at lunchtime), but it wasn't yet ready due to a very busy dinner service the night before, we were told. However, several minutes later, right after ordering we were told we would order it after all which was exciting. This time the noodle soup didn't come out as good. The beef wasn't as tender, the broth wasn't as flavorful as the first time, and as a result the noodles were more bland. I think maybe they just hadn't had enough time in the pot. I would definitely still give it another shot. We wanted to try rabbit salad but it wasn't available, as another yelper mentioned. Also, sadly, the chili pig ear is being taken off the menu due to low popularity (I'll eat it though!).\\n\\nService is great and attentive. We were told they were thinking about making Ah-Ma dinner service only.. I really hope it stays open for lunch and dinner because I think the demand is there for lunch! In any case, Ah-Ma's is a highly desired addition to midtown's Asian food scene, which is severely lacking. (P.S.

We told the hostess our name. \\"Are you sure you put it under your last name, what's your first name?\\" she asked us. We were sure it was under our last name. She couldn't find it either way. She then mumbled under her breath that \\"some people mess up the reservations when they do it online because they select the wrong date\\". I corrected her, we HAD NOT placed our reservation online... we had placed it OVER THE PHONE about 3 hours ago. She made a sigh and sent us on our way with another hostess to the 2nd floor to be seated. I was upset, she really thought we hadn't made reservations but we did! \\n\\nUp the winding staircase and onto the 2nd floor we sat at a table by the window. One seat was booth style and the other side of the table was a normal chair. The menu was mostly seafood (as to be expected for a restaurant on the ocean) and I noted that ALL of the appetizers contained some kind of seafood. Ironically (I suppose) my mother and I hate seafood. She decided on the Prime Rib and baked potato ($28.99) and I decided on the Chicken Marsala and Garlic Mashed Potatoes ($19.99). We were reminded by our waiter of their signature Lava Cake ($9) and that it would take 30mins to bake if we decided on it. We later did decide yes, to splurge on the Lava Cake. \\n\\nThe food was very good, prime rib was tender and pink while the chicken marsala was just right and had lots of mushrooms on the side (my favorite). The Lava Cake appeared after our meal and honestly tasted just as good as a boxed Betty Crocker dark chocolate cake mix.

We came a little before 7 and the place was a bit empty. We thought, oh, guess we didn't need to make a reservation. As the night went on, it got busier but I'm sure you'd still be able to have a seat. They have a rather large space. Good for groups. \\n\\nMany items on the menu sprung out to me as most of them have unusual ingredients that you would not normally see around. I'm always up to explore and tantalizing my taste buds. \\n\\nWe started off with the Albacore Tuna Ceviche (3.5/5 - $15), in a tuna stack form. At the bottom was what tasted like potatoes, and some bacon bites (I assume). Not exactly sure what the bluish purple thing is since there's no prominent taste nor texture. It just blended in with the potatoes. I'd assume it's blue corn? In the middle are two tortilla chips and topped with two slices of tuna. The same layering is stacked on top. So you'd get more that what meets the eye. Tuna was good and I liked the textures in the different layers. But it's hard to eat them all in one bite and I think it's missing some umph. Maybe some spice or some citrus notes would help. \\n\\nWe then decided to get two mains to start as they told us this restaurant is tapas style and order some more if we felt needed. But don't worry, two mains plus the ceviche filled us up pretty well. For mains we had:\\n\\n-Bison Short Rib (3.5/5 - $21): You get three pieces of these. Presentation was not the best. I think the plating was a bit sloppy and thought they would fix it before bringing it out. Especially in the dark lighting, this dish didn't look too appetizing. At the bottom, there was a biscuit of arepa I believe. I tasted cornmeal. On top was the short rib bone in. The meat around the bone was succulent but the rest was overly dry. There was also too much sauce which did not soak into the meat to give it flavour. I really liked the addition of the chimichurri and jalapeno on top. That gave the dish a refreshing kick after having a heavy bite of the arepa and prune jus.\\n\\n-Pan Roasted BC Sablefish (3.5/5 - $24): Initially I wanted to sub out the pana fritas for yuca fritas. I love yuca fritas but pana fritas just sounded like fries. Our server convinced me that the pana fritas were the perfect pairing for the sable fish. It's a bread-pudding like cake at the bottom and goes well with the coconut cream corn. Indeed it was. Loved the coconut cream corn. Loved the texture of the pana fritas but the sablefish needed a pinch more salt. Oh and of course there was black garlic was smeared on top of the creamed corn but there was no pungent taste. It was almost as if it wasn't there. Great for those who hate garlic breath but still want to be healthy through garlic consumption. \\n\\nDidn't see any drink that really excite me but one of our servers passively wanting me to order one so I succumbed and ordered the first drink on the menu with strawberry infused port (3/5 - $10?). I like port and wanted something fruity so I hoped this drink would do me well. It was ok. Not exactly what I wanted. No strong port flavour and the strawberry was very subtle. I did hinted that I wanted to customize my own cocktail but didn't get much of a response so I guess they don't that here?"},{"name":"Taverna Yamas","address":"7500 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Not very good.

The menu looks great and because it's the holidays I thought it would be a good opportunity to get the special coffee blend Barney's makes called \\" Santas White Christmas.\\" It was a little busy for a Sunday brunch as one would expect but we got lucky and a table opened up almost immediately. \\n\\nA server verified they had Santas white Christmas and put the order in for me. So far so good. A different server delivered my coffee, it smelled amazing but is soon as I tasted it I knew something  was different. It was overwhelmingly sweet -No big deal I would just get a server to make me another without sweetener, here's where the problems began. \\n\\nOur server was nowhere to be found, I had to flag down the original guy that helped me to ask him if putting sweetener in the coffee of the day was standard of care to which he replied, \\"no.\\" It turns out that my server had not actually given me the \\"coffee of the day\\" but had instead given me a REGULAR coffee with some kind of weird syrup that made it smell like Santas white Christmas. \\n\\nSo original server number one corrects it & our food orders in and we're waiting... and waiting and waiting. It's a busy day so I guess expecting a long ticket time is no big deal - the open kitchen is cool looking, cool environment, nice day... \\n\\nSo after a LONG ticket time - here comes our food, the Egg Scharshook... cold (it's not supposed to be) and my Avocado Toast with a side of two sunny side up eggs. Not a complex order, but one of my sunny side up eggs is broken, it's all over the place making it more like \\"runny side up.\\" The thin layer of avocado over my bread was not able to hide the fact that my \\"toast\\" was NOT toasted at all. And then there were some old alfalfa sprouts sprinkled onto it - not impressive. \\n\\nMy kids superfood Asahi bowl was OK I guess. Altogether with tip I paid 45 bucks for cold eggs & NOT toasted toast and the wrong coffee. I waited an incredibly long ticket time and upon bringing these issues up to the server I was told, \\"some people prefer Avacado toast UN-toasted it's just a matter of preference I guess.\\" None of the other issues were addressed. I won't be going back. It's too bad, it's a cool little joint that LOOKS like it should've been awesome.

The small sized soup was quite big too.   \\n\\nI had to find out when I went home and I looked at my photo at my unusually tasty charred garlic toast.

The texture of the pizza is very light an airy, as opposed to the compactness of the slices at Pizzapalooza or Umberto's, which is wonderful. However, it does not particularly blow me away in terms of flavor. About a year ago, I swung by and grabbed a slice of cheese to try and the sauce was light, and a bit too delicate to impart much flavor, the cheese not particularly flavorful on its own, feeling more like an adhesive for the ingredients. Today, I had a slice of artichoke pizza, which I had the same sensation. It felt like I was having artichoke bread. Not a particularly bad sensation, but it doesn't taste like pizza to me. Perhaps I am too jaded by Umberto's caramelizing the cheese to a rich brown, but the cheese is just not brought out, like an afterthought, and the sauce was a little... tart for me rather than sweet, the tartness coming out in the aftertaste. Ah, now I remember... that tart sauce taste is reminiscent... of a slice of Ellio's frozen pizza growing up. Le sigh. I wish I could remember the names of the particular places I've had flavorful Sicilian pizzas, a place in Hadley, and another in Providence at different events (rather than going to the restaurant itself). Bostone's is great in texture, but the sauce and cheese just do not do it for me. The amount of artichoke was fine, though it was a little overdone compared to the flavorful and lightly done artichoke pizzas at Sweet Tomatoes (though that is Neapolitan).\\n\\nAs for the service and the appearance of the place, it's fine. They heated up my slice and it was mostly hot with a few cold spots (but there were only 3 slices of the artichoke left... I should have known better), the facilities clean and the variety of slice display venerable, but... that sauce and cheese just gets stuck in my mind."},{"name":"Wayfinder Beer","address":"304 SE 2nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Excellent beer and food.

Other than that it was a great experience.  The two people I was with loved their chicken enchilada and chicken burrito and both cleaned their plates.  The rice served with the dishes is really good if you like a little spice.  Better than On the Border's which has bland rice.  I had two house margaritas which were strong and very good if you like tequila.  I will definitely be going back.  Next time I'm trying the guac which they are famous for."},{"name":"Potbelly Sandwich Shop","address":"10515 N Mopac Expy, Ste 300","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Great place for a quick bite.

The place is pretty hip and nicely decorated, modern, unlike many traditional Vietnamese restaurants. We didn't have to wait long at all because we didn't mind sitting at the bar. I ordered the chicken pho and my friend ordered the tofu salad. I also ordered a salad roll to start. When the salad roll came, I noticed a super long strand of black hair inside the roll. I'm surprised the waitress (who was not who we originally ordered from) didn't see it. I told her and she apologized and said she'll bring us a new one. When our mains came, I realized that it was the beef pho that they gave me instead. I politely told the waitress who took my order at the bar that I had ordered the chicken pho. Instead of being accommodating, she actually turned red in anger and started arguing with me that no, I had not and that she even double checked with me. I tried to be nice and said oh maybe because it's loud in here and maybe I didn't pronounce in Vietnamese correctly, we misunderstood eachother. She said in a very rude tone, no they don't sound alike. Might I add this server is not Vietnamese herself, but Caucasian. I got tired of going back and forth with her and was quite taken aback by her attitude. I asked if I can have the order I wanted, she said fine, and said very rudely, take your chopsticks off. Even my friend who is also normally very easy going as well could not believe her rude attitude. Later the manager came over to apologize for the salad roll and said it's been taken off the bill for me. He was very friendly and I appreciated that he did that. I was going to tell him about the rude incident before I left but the server did come back to apologize afterwards, maybe because she saw me talking to the manager. However, her apology was not for her bad attitude, it was about the hair in the salad roll, and afterwards she seemed much more attentive. All in all, the food tasted good, but I still was unhappy with how the waitress handled the situation, I've never been treated like that at a restaurant."},{"name":"Chile Verde","address":"4852 Sawmill Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Wow.

Even months before my trip, reservations for table service dinner were already filled. The next best thing was to come for lunch for quick service dining. Ken L. and I came for lunch a little after the restaurant opened. The wait wasn't too bad (compared to waiting in line for rides). You order from kiosk and find a seat in one of the three rooms (ballroom, Beast's room, and library). The food is then delivered to you via the rose shaped tracker or your Disney magic band. You also get real utensils. It's like table service at quick service meal price. \\n\\nThe food was pretty good for lunch. Using my quick service dining credit, I ordered the Tuna Ni√ßoise Salad (Warm Seared Tuna Steak, chilled Green Beans, Potatoes, Olives, Roasted Bell Peppers, Tomatoes and a Hard Poached Egg), a cream puff for dessert, and ice tea. Ken L. had the Braised Pork (Eight Hour Slow-cooked Pork with Mushrooms, Onions, Carrots and Bacon served with Mashed Potatoes and Green Beans Jardiniere), strawberry cream cheese cupcake, and a bottle of water. \\n\\nBe Our Guest is a wonderful addition to the Magic Kingdom.

Sandwiches on Demi tea were delightful in taste n enough for one person. U can ask for ur milk or cream hot which I did. $25 for demi tea per person is little over the top but u got to pay the price for being in above an average tea saloon.

This also means that when I finally managed to get your attention and you direct me to the order window, it wasn't appreciate that you commented on how hard it must be to read both the sign below and above the winds that said order. My flat stare should have been an indicator our interaction was going south fast.

It was the best Long Island that I'd ever tasted.\\n\\nOnto the food - I tried my best to taste everything, since this is a cuisine I'm trying to become acquainted with. I started with salads, dips and breads. I especially enjoyed the black olive hummus with pita, the cucumber salad and the mixed greens with mango vinaigrette. I wasn't a huge fan of the curry pasta salad.\\n\\nNext I moved onto meats and sides... The chicken was amazing, my favorite by far. I also enjoyed the beef, which was nicely cooked and seasoned. The salmon was the best salmon I've ever had and I'm not a fan of seafood. As far as sides go, it was hard for me to go back for seconds. I tried everything, but most of the flavors just didn't work for me. I did enjoy the stewed tomatoes and onions. The food was creative, it just depends on what kind of flavors you go for.\\n\\nI didn't try the soups, but my boyfriend did and he actually enjoyed them - Particularly the seafood one.\\n\\nThe dessert was the BEST part of the entire meal.

The crust comes in both thin and thick, both of which are quite tasty.\\n\\nAlso, you should know, since this is Disney, it's quite expensive for pizza/Italian.

I got thai iced tea...way tooo sweet and $4?! WOW. that's like almost double the price from DK, where it's like 2.50-3$ and it tastes good there. My mom liked the pho soup..she says it's very.... \\"clear, simple\\" but i prefer flavorful ones. I think i'll try something else...oh she likes the noodle because its really soft and different than other pho places...but they need more AC cause it's one heck of a hot day!

That is, until I realized one of the supposed fusion components was Indonesian.\\n\\nIt turns out the proprietors are ethnic Chinese originally from Indonesia (Surabaya, to be precise), and have a small but solid selection of Indonesian dishes.  Both the Indonesian fried rice and Belacan fried rice are solid comfort food dishes.  The beef rendang is not the best I've had but we're in Columbus after all, so I'm not going to be too fussy.  The real star of the Indonesian menu is the fried chicken, accompanied by a curry tofu soup, rice with the traditional fried garlic on top, and a accompaniment of pickled cucumber.  Plus their homemade sambal.  It's that sincere attention to detail that stands out - a simple dish that is served exactly like you would have it in Southeast Asia, not even skimping on the garnishes.\\n\\nI haven't yet tried the Chinese portion of the menu, but judging by the two large groups of Chinese undergrads from OSU that were eating here, I can only assume it's pretty good.

Well, the rice was perfectly cooked, and tasted just out of the pot, unlike some restaurants (which shall remain nameless!) who serve crispy bits to you. The meat and beans were perfectly cooked too and the veggies were crisp. Once Future Lawyer, who also goes by \\"Mr. Condiments\\" got done loading his burrito up (he even asked the guy at the counter to bring him some additional) with sauces and salsas he concurred with my food findings. \\n\\nToday was my second visit in under two weeks, and I have to say that it's going to become my go-to for all things Fresh Mex. Although it cost me $11.00 for a bowl and a drink (my only fault with the joint), the food is legitimately fresh, hormone free and the service is always with a genuine smile. Any business that has happy employees means they are invested in their staff as much as the products they serve, and that scores major points in my book."},{"name":"Bakersfield","address":"733 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Food and drinks are great!

I'm not saying they need more, but I think whoever buys the beer for them is a bit of a neophyte, because the election lacks depth at times. \\n\\nI was a little put off with a bit of attitude I got on one visit. I'd been there twice and sat at the bar.I got service no problem and didn't think anything of it. On a third visit I sat at the bar the woman at the bar seemed flustered. Then the manager or owner who was working the register said that I was supposed to order and pay up front.  OK, if that's how you want to roll, I guess it's cool, but I felt like they were perturbed that I didn't know better. I kinda felt like an ass, but when I think back, they're the asses. They decided to put in this bar, with seats at it. That usually implies that you can sit at the bar and open a tab. I sat at the bar twice before and there was no problem because the people working those days were restaraunt pros who know how to take care of customers.  They realized that it's just as easy for one of them to run my card at the register.  Rather than making me feel like a buffoon, they never even tipped me off that I was crushing the groove of the whole Sweet Carrot universe. They adapted. They overcame. They made me feel like coming back, at least until the food truck staff was on duty. They aren't pros. They looked at me like I had stomped on a basket of kittens on my way int he door. \\n\\nSo, for now ya'll get 3 stars. My advice is to swing both ways. It's not just for my benefit, but yours as well. You see if I sit at the bar with an open tab, I might have three or four beers. I might order another menu item. If You force me to pay upfront I will drink one beer, and I won't order any extras. \\n\\nIf you insist on your silly food truck mentality of having people pay upfront, then you need to stop sending mixed messages.

Delicious, slightly spicy gravy.

We are both experienced cooks with a perhaps higher than average exposure to a wide spectrum of food and techniques. \\n\\nWe started out with a couple of dirty, filthy martinis...this place is supposed to be one of the hotspots for cocktails in this town. The martinis were neither filthy nor dirty. The were, in fact, among the least satisfying martinis we've had in Portland. Strike One. \\n\\nWe were seated at a communal table, fine. The two couples next to us were probably mid-20s dudes, more on them later. Fine. We were handed menus and a glass of water, but no server appeared for nearly 10 minutes. Not good.\\n\\nWe ordered a starter of broccoli raab with a soft boiled egg. It was quite good, though I'd rather have the raab served at least luke warm, not cold. The flavors were good, in any case. Fine.\\n\\nOur entrees came out rather quickly: the so-called rack of pig turned out to be a bone-in pork chop and C's pappardelle with beef sugo looked good at first glance. Fine. But, when she began to eat it, and upon closer inspection, the pasta turned out to be way too thick---gross in the original sense of the word---and very gummy and chewy, with none of the lightness and delicacy fresh, house-made pasta should have, truly verging on nasty, and a sign of a pasta amateur. (I'm certified as a pasta maker from one of Bologna's most prestigious pasta schools...we roll the stuff with a rolling pin to paper thinness, about 25% the thickness of CC's leathery noodles.)  The sugo was unbalanced and a bit too sweet, C said it was also a bit too salty, but I didn't detect this in the few bites I had. My description would be: BLAH. So what???  It was not impressive. My opinion. Strike Two.\\n\\nMy \\"rack of pig\\" was served nicely cooked on the exterior, but nearly raw in the center, I am not sure the center was even warm. This is a big no no with pork, even today's safer meats, and if it IS CC's way of serving it, they should offer the diner a choice of doneness levels, just like a steak. I've cooked tons of pork, eaten tons of pork, and NEVER been served something I would have to classify as barely rare. Bad move, kitchen. The flavor of the dish was fine, but nearly raw pork just won't do. Unfortunately, we waited 15 minutes for the dish to come back out of the kitchen. Strike Three. \\n\\nThe waiter, at some point, asked the routine \\"Is everything ok?\\" question. We, well, C replied immediately with her concerns about the pasta being way too thick, way inedible. I chimed in at this point, and then we addressed the nearly raw pig. The waiter agreed this was a faux pas and offered to comp us desserts. Fine. But while we were merely responding to the waiter's query (something almost no one ever  does beyond the mechanical \\"fine\\"), the fellow sitting next to me decided, with his 25 years of wisdom and experience, to tell us to lay off the waiter! \\"It's not his fault about the food!\\" Now wait, the waiter asked us a question about the food, and we decided to be honest. Is this really a problem, folks? Come on, we understand the waiter is not responsible for the food, BUT, he was our liaison with the kitchen, and we were not happy with some of the food, so, we had, in our opinion, a responsibility to let the kitchen know about it. Maybe, just maybe, they might pay attention. Or maybe not. Fine.\\n\\nThe desserts arrived. One, a \\"baked alaska\\", was quite yummy, we both agreed. But, a pineapple upside down concoction was mediocre, even bland, and could have come from Costco. Strike Three Point Five. \\n\\nMy opinion: I doubt I would return.

I've traveled around Italy and can honestly say the homemade pasta was as good if not better than many top  restaurants on the Italian coast. I had the lobster ravioli with shrimp which was so yummy I forced myself to save some to bring home for lunch today.

That worked out perfectly for my husband and I since we want variety when we go eat.  We've also tasted the spaghetti bolognese with just meat sauce.  Spaghetti was cooked perfect al dente, and the meat sauce was rich, meaty, and just the right amount of acidity.\\n\\nThey have been in business in this location for over 40 years (in their Deep Cove location for just as many too!)... they must be doing something right!  We've only been there twice, and each time the service was top notch.  The owner lady is so nice and so accommodating to our son's dietary needs.  He has a severe gluten allergy, and she went out of her way to make sure the puree of leek and potato soup was not made with any flour or wheat ingredients.  He loved the soup, and no hives afterwards!  She has great recommendations if you're unfamiliar with the menu.  (Note to parents:  We had to bring in our own booster seat both times - no high chairs.  Leave your stroller in the car or at the door.)\\n\\nAnd they deliver!

I moved to Austin in 1992 and I always lived central.  But, I bought a house four years ago at Parmer and Mopac, so I have resigned myself to the fact that I am now a northie.  Ouch.  Is this really a suburb?  It takes me 10 minutes to get downtown with no traffic.  I work on East Oltorf and eat lunch at the many excellent south Austin one-of-a-kind restaurants.  But, I suppose I have to admit that sometimes I don't feel like driving into town and would rather eat/drink closer to home.  \\n\\nSo, on a Friday night when I had to make a trip to the Home Depot at the Arbor Walk, I spotted this new place called Mighty Fine Burgers, Fries & Shakes.  Never heard of it before, but I love a good burger, so decided to try it out.  Here is the scoop:\\n\\n--This is a new restaurant from the owners of Rudy's.  See:  http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2007/10/15/daily19.html\\n--The menu is short, but distinguished.\\n--It has the feel of Rudy's (long tables with red and white checkered tablecloths and the same ordering method).\\n\\nThe best part of this place is the crinkle fries.  They aren't fat and mushy--they are thin and crunchy and perfect.  And....omg, they have sparkle on the table.  Is this heaven?  Sparkle heaven, yummmm.\\n\\nWe got two 1/4 lb. burgers with cheese and jalepenos, plus two orders of fries, one fresh squeezed lemonade, and one IBC rootbeer for $17.  Seems a little pricey, but I suppose you would pay more than $10 for the same meal at whataburger.  And it was pretty damn good.\\n\\nNext time, I'll try the shakes.  They don't serve malts, just shakes.\\n\\nSo, as far as I can recall, they only have 9 items on the menu:\\n1. 1/2 lb. burger\\n2. 1/4 lb. burger\\n3.  Chili dog \\n4. Crinkle fries\\n5. Shakes (made with blue bell ice cream--either chocolate, strawberry, or vanilla)\\n6. Bottled soft drink\\n7. Fountain drink\\n8. Fresh sqeezed lemonade (regular or strawberry)\\n9. Chips\\n \\nGotta admire them for keeping it simple. They also have this amazing hand sanitizer machine that is like a spa for your hands right there in the restaurant.  \\n\\nSo, bottom line, I am a northie (ugh, I need to learn to embrace my northiness), and this is a pretty good burger with outstanding fries AND sparkle."},{"name":"B.GOOD","address":"50 Northern Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"B good is amazing and never fails to disappoint.

Whether it was because of the bad restaurant we had just escaped from or the drink itself, this was the best margarita I have every had.

This beer literally tastes like someone brewed a tasteless ale, then tossed in all of the discarded beef brisket from a BBQ joint. Now, normally, this sounds like it would be delicious (read: bacon beer), however when the beer has stale notes of raspberry and cherry, the combination is disastrous. This was the first pint of beer EVER that I literally could not finish. Stephanie should be ashamed of herself, whoever she is.\\n\\nHops Explosion IPA: Uhh, where are the hops? For a 90+ IBU beer with a name like that, you'd expect your face to be punched in with plenty of bitterness and hops flavor/aroma. I think they should change the name to \\"Hops? IPA\\". While this beer wasn't bad, it just was not good. Even if it were not supposed to be an IPA or a hoppy beer in general, the taste was completely off, imbalanced, and tasted like it came out of dirty tap lines.\\n\\nMoody Street Stout: Okay, I will admit that this beer was really good.

Broadway in the old Uprising Bakery location. The decor is consistently charming throughout with antique furniture and quirky decorations that make you feel like you stepped into a storybook. I found my fluffy pink chair to be a bit too low for our table (since all the furniture is purposely mismatched), but otherwise enjoyed the atmosphere quite a bit.\\n\\nMy gf and I came for lunchtime tea and sandwiches. It wasn't too busy or noisy on a weekday late-afternoon, but note that the location can get crowded. I was the only man in the entire place for the duration of our visit. Neverland does seem unabashedly geared towards female customers, but I have no problem with that. The extent of my self-consciousness came when I tried to cram my plump sausage link of a finger through the dainty handle of the teacup.\\n\\nTea is sold by the pot ($3) with no hot water refills. The larger pot will net you approximately 2.5 cups of tea for you and your \\"Wendy\\". After that you'll need to select a new variety from their illuminated treasure box / briefcase that displays the different teas. It's a cute touch. Maybe tea was what was in that briefcase from Pulp Fiction. \\n\\nWe tried the darjeeling tea and also the Neverland special blend. The latter seemed to contain vanilla and peppermint so it was much sweeter and functioned more as a dessert tea.\\n\\nSandwiches were around $10-12. My gf had the breakfast sandwich with egg and tomato and I had the fig and brie sandwich. Both were competently prepared and tasted good. Mine was a tad on the small side. Her's appeared much bigger by comparison.\\n\\nI enjoyed my lunch at Neverland and would recommend it to locals. It's a fun place to go for a date or an out-of-the-ordinary meal.

I've never had any issues with the place and always left quite full and satisfied. Be prepared to consume some major carbs.  The food here is good but some dishes are more mediocre then others. The one and only dish I truly care about is their Xi'an Cold Steamed Noodles. $8 gets you their home made soft chewy noodles, fantastic sauce, and with a splash of shredded cucumbers and bean sprouts. I come to notice that my parent's generation isn't too fond of the whole cold noodle experience but that's their loss. You will notice off the bat that their noodles of superb quality. The entire dish screams out for attention and makes you wanting more after licking the bowl dry. There's a slight spice kick from the garlic-chili sesame sauce but nothing you shouldn't be able to handle. \\n\\nThe beef rolls (wraps) $8 is also very popular. They cut it up for you, so it's a great dish to share or to pair with the Xi'an cold noodles. This last visit, we ordered the Sichuan Cucumbers $8 as our \\"green\\" dish. A little pricey for just cut up cucumbers in my opinion. I probably won't be ordering this one again. If you're expecting that tangy, spicy cold cucumber dish that you find at many Mandarin/Taiwanese restaurants then you're going to be disappointed. Pricey and bland. \\n\\nFrom my recollection from previous visits, the XLB \\"Xiao-Long Bao\\" and their Sichuan Beef Soup Noodles (both $8) were decent. I do recall not caring for their Dan Dan Noodles. Can you guess the price for that dish?\\n\\nService has always been good. The Xi'an Cold Noodles are always a must if I stop by.

I'm there with 4 friends. We're outside sitting at a table when the umbrella partially collapses and hits someone in the head! I immediately get up to alert the staff, and a woman staffer, who obviously witnessed the situation from inside, (maybe the owner,) brushes past me to, [what I initially thought was] to address it. When she gets to the table she doesn't express any remorse or concern that someone was hit by the faulty umbrella. Even as we tried to explain that someone was potentially injured, she doesn't care the least bit. She interrupts us to simply tells us to move to the other table, (which we were in the process of doing). She then begins to close the umbrella while we were standing beneath it gathering our things, again almost hitting us with the umbrella. While doing this, she blames it on \\"people\\" who keep putting the umbrella out (it's obviously happened several times before), and she seemingly postures herself to place blame on us for sitting there. 10 minutes later, I go in to have my cup of water replaced that was lost in the shuffle. She argues (as if I'm not standing there) with the African American cashier that I approached about the refill. The cashier advocates for me by saying \\"he already had a cup, he just needs a refill..\\" In other words, the woman wanted to charge me for another cup. I could see the disgust on the cashier's face, as if to say \\"lady you're being totally  ridiculous.\\" \\"The whole time, the non-African American woman is looking at me, (but not looking at me) with this look of quiet disdain. I return later to have my water refilled again, and again she gives me this disapproving look... My party had previously ordered coffees, pastries, and iced beverages, so we were definitely paying customers. This apparently wasn't enough to earn us an apology for the umbrella nor a few refills of water... As I said before, this treatment is easily dismissed as the result of some other motivation; poor customer service, overworked small business owner, etc., but it was very clear to me that there was some personal unstated motivation that reeked of  \\"regardless how much money you spend with me, I am predisposed to offer you subhuman respect.\\" \\n\\nAll too often we offer a pass to this kind of behavior. We tell ourselves it's their problem not mine. My wife loves (loved) this spot, but today they lost the patronage of 5 customers behind the actions, (and lack of action) of one of their staff.

Their prix fixe menu makes sampling every course affordable. For $23 you can choose from salad Lyonnaise, soup, or pates maisons, followed by a option of three entrees, usually with a few fish dishes and a veal or pork. I had the Ruby Trout with raspberry sauce and it literally melted in my mouth. The fresh baguettes that kept magically appearing at my side made sure not a drop of sauce was left on the plate. Then when you think you can't eat any more, you must choose again between a rich creamy chocolate mousse, silky creme caramel, or the uber-french wedge of brie for dessert. Owned by long time French expats, who don't make you feel too terrible for mispronouncing everything on the menu, it's atmosphere is very laid back for easily the best French food I've eaten.

I understand mice are probably at other restaurants I've been to...but I've never ever seen one while at an establishment.

It was pretty delicious with the perfect pesto-to-cheese-to-chicken-to-bread ratio :). My friend got the pulled pork and liked it -- it wasn't too messy or overly covered in bbq sauce which she enjoyed. I got the sweet potato fries and she got the regular fries. The regular fries were way more flavorful, so I think I'd recommend those over the sweet potato fries.\\n\\nI would have given a much higher rating had I not seen the mouse, and probably would have gone back to the restaurant, as well.

However, the presentation and the spicy dressing added to the bland crab cakes. http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/advxl0MmatGaVZoiQKGV1g?select=cTbbgYg9eXy142uCUdRH8A#k4jG5TNwQOORikUokSQDYw\\n\\nI had the Spicy Tuna Sashimi Salad ($15). There was no spice or marinade to the tuna sashimi at all, which was okay I guess because I had full tuna flavour. The tuna was endless, truly endless, because each time I thought I ate it all, I dug a little further into my bed of fresh greens and there was MORE! I wish there was more dressing and flavour but overall it was a light salad with TONS of relatively fresh tuna sashimi. http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/advxl0MmatGaVZoiQKGV1g?select=cTbbgYg9eXy142uCUdRH8A#Muy1LK685e77QwLZxNr4OQ\\n\\nMy boyfriend had the yummiest entree of Wild Salmon & Crab Hash ($20). The crab hash was really delicious because the crab was so apparent and tasty - I guess that's where our crab went from our crab cakes. The salmon was cooked perfectly, being flakey, soft and rich in flavour. The side of vegetables was great, especially the rich and beautiful purple beets. Along with some rie and an interesting yellow hollandaise-like sauce, it was delightful. http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/advxl0MmatGaVZoiQKGV1g?select=cTbbgYg9eXy142uCUdRH8A#ShLVxiAAP-3TMnZunRa8qA\\n\\nWe ended our meal with the Deep Dish Apple Pie ($8). It wasn't very deep but it was good nonetheless, especially with the vanilla gelato. \\nhttp://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/advxl0MmatGaVZoiQKGV1g?select=cTbbgYg9eXy142uCUdRH8A#l0Qlz1yfQhd4U40PVsMzaQ\\n\\nOverall, the food was well presented and tasted good, but a little pricey. However, the best part of the meal was the service. Our waitress was so so SO friendly and attentive - I'm not sure if that was because we were the only ones there besides from one other couple. Regardless, it was a breath of fresh air to receive such great service.\\n\\nI also came here for their Lunch Speical (Rice bowls for $10.99 or more). The Buttered Chicken Rice Bowl was really rich, flavourful and had a pretty good match to taste. I wish they had real naan instead of just pita bread though. http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/advxl0MmatGaVZoiQKGV1g?select=cTbbgYg9eXy142uCUdRH8A#2o2Uhb2emcWh3S9Rs7u_HA\\n\\nMy boyfriend had the Spicy Chili Thai with Chicken Bowl ($10.99). It was supposed to come with noodles but they didn't have any so rice was substituted. He really like it because it was actually spicy! http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/advxl0MmatGaVZoiQKGV1g?select=cTbbgYg9eXy142uCUdRH8A#HUfRTNiW579NUZeS3nk-mA"},{"name":"Clyde Common","address":"1014 SW Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"We stopped by for Happy Hour on a Monday on our way to catch a game at the Moda Center.

I invariably get the duck pate. \\nClosely followed by an entree, the menu offers three choices, which change daily. Most recently I had Truitt buerre rough (Trout in a red wine butter sauce). I swear, the Sous Chef deserves a raise! The sauce was was delicate and savory, with a subtle fruitiness.

The texture was creamy, and yes, the little kick of spice was nice, but they were lacking in dimension.  They could have used a bit of extra-sharp white cheddar, in my opinion, or at least some SALT.  Totally bland, for all the hype I read about them. \\n\\nMan-friend had the Reggie DeLuxe, which looked like a heart attack on a plate.  A deeeeelicious heart attack on a plate.  I didn't try any, but he said it was pretty good.  \\n\\nStumptown Coffee:  always a fan.\\n\\nService: nothing to shout about.  I assume everyone working that morning had a raging hangover.  It seemed like it.  But hey, they were functional.\\n\\nBONUS: If you get there before 10:30 am, Triple Nickel lets Pine State customers use their picnic tables out front.  Great for summer - winter? Probably not so much.\\n\\nOver all, pretty okay.  I took a star off for the bland grits and blander service, and a star off for the inflated price.  Our breakfast was $20, which just seemed too high for what is essentially a one-trick pony take out joint."},{"name":"Crema Cafe","address":"27 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Most unique and flavorful sandwiches I have ever had. I ordered the Sweet Potato and Crema Grilled Chicken Sandwiches, and both were so filling and delicious. Sweet potato is probably my favorite vegetable, but I've never had it in a sandwich. The Sweet Potato Sandwich was absolutely bursting with flavor from the strangest but most pleasantly delicious combination of powerfood ingredients - sweet potato, avocado, green apple, hummus, sprouts, and vinaigrette on wheat bread. It was a huge sandwich and I could barely fit it into my mouth, but it was to die for. \\nThe Crema Grilled Chicken Sandwich was so savory with chicken for protein, avocado, and a cotija cheese-corn spread on fluffy potato bread. The cheese spread was creamy and the avocado added an hearty, earthy taste to the sandwich. \\n\\nI came here with a friend for Sunday lunch and seating was packed on both floors.

Jerry is a great cook and prepares many meals, in a small space, in a short period of time. Wes, is a great bartender and is also a jack of all trades.
