Post experience Nathan T's review was much appreciated and I wished I'd read it before coming in.\\n\\nFirstly, the positive reviews regarding the drinks and food are accurate as they are good and the atmosphere is also quite ideal as coffee shops come.\\n\\nHowever, we inadvertently ruffled some feathers when we walked in with a partially finished Starbucks drink.  The plan was to settle in and snack and caffeinate further. After purchasing a cappuccino and sitting down we were accosted by the manager who approached our table and sternly stated in the quite room that we were not supposed to bring outside drinks into the establishment. She was quite forceful and tense in her body language.  We didn't respond verbally to this public shaming but tried to get back to reading not knowing at this time that there is a sign on the door stating the same.  Unfortunately, we were allowed to by a drink before this conversation so our plan was to finish it then leave.   In under a minute, this time from across the room behind the counter, she yelled that we were to leave since we didn't dump out our drink (this was not specified in her previous statements).  We were dumbfounded.  At this point clearly she was angry and we felt it was best to just leave. I made a defensive comment leaving saying how other places don't have similar policies and her livid response was to say how offensive it was to bring Starbucks into their shop and she would get the owner to yell at us if we didn't leave.\\n\\nAfter leaving frustrated I tried to call by phone to smooth things over, as is my nature.  The manager picked up and I identified myself and I asked to speak with the owner who came on the line saying we 'brought Starbucks into one of the best coffee shops in Portland' and then hung up on me.  I tried to call back several times to simply explain that we weren't aware of their policy and that some kinder customer service would go a long way. I politely asked for their names to humanize the conversation but didn't succeed.   I was yelled at some more and hung up on several more times by both manager and owner who threatened to sue me for harassment. I did not call again and don't plan to do so or to support this business if possible.\\n\\nTo the owner and manager: I sincerely apologize for breaking your rules.\\nPlease take a deep breath in these situations in future and don't assume the worse of people. We make mistakes sometimes.  We would have appreciated a kinder approach to the situation Ex explain policy and ask that we follow it in future.\\n\\nThe situation was complicated by allowing us to buy our drink before approaching us regarding the infraction. It was just a mess. We didn't know we were in the wrong and then everyone felt awful when it was over.

My husband got the wrong side dishes with his meal. I had to ask for a steak knife for my filet, and the filet was very underdone-so I had to send it back. I got it back fine but the steak wasn't seasoned. By this time, I had lost my happy feelings about our dinner out. After dinner, we asked for coffee. The coffee was burnt tasting like it was very old. My husband sent it back saying it was undrinkable. During this time, no management rounded to ask how our experience was.

So I ordered a burger that looked great in the photo, but when it came it was luke warm, tiny, and spend 21 on this burger and acai smoothie. The staff were kind of roudy and loud, but I was super disappointed. I didn't want to eat the burger at all but paid so much for it. So I ordered the protein burger which looked and sounded scrumptious, but the reality it was a tiny room temperature piece of burger, dallop of guacamole (was suppose to be avacado), small piece of bacon, cheese was average size and everything was so small that the cheese overpowered the meal, and the kale was shredded and I think had rocks in it and was dry. It was pretty terrible."},{"name":"Noodles & Company","address":"100 NW 10th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Ok I need to give my little disclaimer first, I'm rating this establishment 5 stars for what it is, a quick casual place to get some decent food! Now on to the review...\\n\\nThis place executes a cool concept, and they execute well. Obviously the menu is noodles, but they have several different cuisines so no matter what you're in the mood for, you can usually find something here to suit your tastes. My favorite is the truffle mac & cheese, and the pan noodles are actually very good! I hate to say it, but to me they are actually better than many of the same noodles I would order at an Asian restaurant! \\n\\nMy other praise would be the service. Despite paying fast food pricing, you really get excellent service, they bring the food out to you, and insist on cleaning up! They also decline tips, which is all about maintaining their casual environment but these people really do deserve to be tipped!"},{"name":"The Sausage Guy","address":"49 Lansdowne St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"No trip to Fenway Park is complete without buying either a pre or post game sausage and pepper sub.

It's creamy and delicious with just the right amount of mushroom kick to it. If you go here, you must get it. Trust me. You'll thank me.\\n\\nNow I love going to Artist Point for many reasons, not just the portobello soup though admittedly that is the main draw. Artist Point is situated off the back lobby of the Wilderness Lodge. The Wilderness Lodge is one of my favorite Disney hotels to stay at or visit with its rustic feel. And at the holidays with all the decorations!? Forget about it!\\n\\nUsually the service is something to rave about, as well, but on my latest visit, our server was a drag. She seemed annoyed we weren't ordering more and just generally seemed a bit crabby. It wasn't ideal when I was dining at one of my favorite places at Disney World. However, the hosting staff was very friendly.\\n\\nPutting her lovely attitude aside, our food was delicious and my friends and I had a good meal but it didn't blow our minds. As mentioned, the soup. Yes. Do it. I then got the Pasta Appetizer as my main dish for $16. For my tiny tummy, this was the perfect meal size for me filling me up without any leftovers. The pasta is changed up seasonally but when I went it was a Farm Egg Pappardelle with Wild Boar Bolognese, Alba Mushrooms, Aged Cow's Milk Cheese, and Greens. I was in love with every ingredient and it all went together quite well.\\n \\nI'll continue going to Artist Point on each trip to Disney because the food is delicious but hope they can get service back to what it once was!"},{"name":"Tuscan Kitchen - Seaport","address":"64 Seaport Blvd","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I will not be returning to this restaurant.

I liked the broth a whole lot but everything else was just OK. The noodles tasted buttery but very soft, the pork belly was inedible (all fat) and the corn was off putting and neither of us understood why corn was in it.

It's a nice restaurant with generally good food, and the servers are genuinely nice people.  The prices for a few of the dishes are slightly more than what I would expect to pay, but I guess that's to be expected for this type of establishment.  My only other complaint is that the flatbreads, though delicious, are often incredibly crunchy, which detracts from their appeal.\\n\\nOne of the great things about The Wine Bistro is that somewhat larger groups can be accommodated pretty easily.  I have been for both lunch and dinner with groups of anywhere from 6-10, and we have never had a problem.  There is a long communal table at the front and another at the back, and if the weather is nice, tables outside can be placed next to one another to allow for larger groups.  Likewise, having been there alone on a few occasions, I can say that the place is perfectly comfortable for the lone diner.  I have sat at the bar alone and even been engaged in conversation by other lone diners there -- nothing creepy, just friendly conversation.  One elderly woman who seems to be a regular once struck a conversation with me, as did a guy around my age on another occasion.  So, whether you're in a group or alone, The Wine Bistro is a perfectly great place to eat and drink.\\n\\nWill I be back?  Yes, of course!  It's close to me and it's a great restaurant.

The guy that worked there said it was about a 4/10 spice but I would probably say between 6-7. I didn't taste the coconut but maybe I was too hungry to notice.   I am glad the food was good because I was thoroughly pissed to go to a fast casual restaurant and be pressured into leaving a 20% tip on the iPad type devices at the register. Not that I don't tip... but I find this tacky. I'm paying $10 for a rice bowl so it would be nice if a tip was already added. It has just gotten to the point that between 10% sales tax and 20% tips I'm feels no nickeled and dimed to death. Like other reviewers I found the guy behind the counter to be seemingly uninterested in me and not real friendly. Kinda relieved to hear it's not just me. I frankly think the guy was not an hourly employee but rather a partner and I don't feel the need to tip in that situation. The sauce did a lot to appease my hard feelings.

But the patio area was dreadfully hot and stuffy on that particular afternoon. The plastic curtains were all down, and even though there were ceiling fans, they were rotating soooooo slowly they didn't serve any purpose at all.

It's small and unassuming and when you walk in it feels like you stepped back in time to the \\"Godfather\\" era, but all those things make it so interesting and a great conversational piece. The food is just as authentic as the setting and super delicious, as is the wine! The waiters are so sweet and friendly and attentive. They even brought us out a special treat, free of charge at the end of the night. We will definitely be returning. AMAZING!  We visited on a Monday night so the restaurant was full but not crowded and we didn't have to wait at all. I doubt we would ever try to come on a weekend for a place of this size because I can imagine having to wait forever even with a reservation. \\n\\nThe only reasons I didn't give this place 5 stars are \\n\\n1) The parking was a little sketchy.Since it's a small (really small) place, their parking fills up fast but they allow you to park in the neighboring restaurants or business' parking lots. The problem is, none of the neighboring places lots are very well lit and I remember feeling sort of uneasy about the area especially since there are a lot of strip clubs within a few miles which means unsavory characters could be lurking. When we pulled up I almost didn't want to get out because it just looked so scary.They also have a guy who patrols on his bicycle and controls the parking situation but he was just as scary!  LOL. Had we not seen all the RAVE reviews we may not have gotten out of the car. So glad we did though.\\n2) The portion sizes were wayyyyyy too small for the price. Alfredo's is mighty expensive and that's fine especially for the quality of food, wine,atmosphere and service BUT the portion sizes are too small to be charging that much. I tend to get full very quickly, usually I won't even order an appetizer at most places because I won't finish my food. But at Alfredo's my companion and I EACH ordered an appetizer, chewed on several pieces of garlic bread, had our entrees, shared a dessert and have a few glasses of wine and I STILL didn't leave completely full.

We were about to order sandwiches when we were told the kitchen was closed because everyone was working on holiday orders.  We could only order from an already pre-made selection.  I asked if they were hot, the lady said yes.  We ordered Honey, Napoleon and Izba cakes.  For appetizers we ordered various pastries (2 Pirozhkis and 2 Cheburekis).  The Cashier/Server packed everything in a grocery bag without asking me if I wanted to eat it there.  I asked for water.   She then asked if I was eating there and I said yes.  I noticed the packed food was lukewarm so I asked her to warm up the pastries.  I asked for forks for the cakes.  For everything she asked how many.  She could see that we were 4 persons.  Did she really need to ask.  Could not she just give us 4 cups of water and 4 forks?  I definitely could tell she didn't want us there.  I stayed because I was hungry, I really liked the cakes and I was looking forward to the Russian sandwiches.  However, my expectations were shattered due to the very rude service we received.

The tuna poke was also great, although in my opinion the pieces could be a little larger so they're easier to pick up with chopsticks. Next I had the amberjack sashimi. Sashimi serves as my bellwether for the rest of the meal, and this place rocks the sashimi. The pieces are so fresh you'd swear the fish was swimming just hours earlier.

I'm sorry baby, come back, let me explain.\\n\\nGreen Dragon Ale House has a lot to like:\\n\\nA vast selection of beers, many made locally.  If there is one thing that brings joy to my heart, it is trying beers that I have never tried before.

You know I only tell you these things because I love you and I want to help you get better:\\n\\nAs other reviewers have mentioned, it is cold inside the Green Dragon Ale House.  If you come anywhere from late fall to early spring, dress warm.  Everyone in my party had coats on and we were still chilly.\\n\\nThere's not really much in the way of ambiance.  Particularly if you are on the bar side, it feels like you are sitting inside of a big brewery, which you are.  The ceiling is high and beside your table you will share room with stacks of beer kegs.  While not necessarily a bad thing for those casual stops, I would not take a date here.\\n\\nIf this were the only place around with good food and a great beer selection, I could be more lenient, but Green Dragon Ale, you are just one contestant in a large beauty pageant.\\n\\nTake some alone time;  find out who you really are;  invest some energy in making Green Dragon the best Green Dragon you can be; when you warm up a little and start serving your own beer I'll come back and check on you."},{"name":"Antique Table","address":"2 Essex St","city":"Lynn","stars":"4","text":"We have been regular customers since this restaurant first opened and have introduced many people to it.  As they expand to other cities, this facility has been ignored.  Despite having left messages about broken seat backs, they are content to have local customers dine looking at broken chairs.  Maybe Lynn is too \\"inner city\\" to deserve the new tables and chairs they are buying for the other restaurants!  Last Friday my wife and I went for dinner.  The manager who knows us and greeted us nicely said that there was only one table for 2 ahead of us.  We waited at the bar.  They were so understaffed that we couldn't even get a glass of wine at the bar - the few servers were running back and forth.  the whole time we waited at the bar there was an empty table for 4.  Maybe a reservation.  After a second table for 4 opened up and we were not seated after ten additional minutes - now a full half hour - we walked out.   We went to Salem and dined at another Italian restaurant (not the Salem Antique Table) and had a delightful meal with good wine for less than we typically spend at the Antique Table.

I was a bit confused by the name at first until I learned that it stood for Most Valuable Pho. As things turned out, they had to change their name at the request of their landlord (because there are other competing tenants that also serve pho)... hence their new name... \\"Little Minh's\\".\\n\\nUnlike some other old school Vietnamese restaurants, the interior is a bit more modern with a spacious and bright layout with red walls, a large bar counter, and lots of attentive waitresses. Their menu offering, when we first visited, was a bit limited so we decided to try some of their appies on our first visit. The Most Valuable Roll ($5.50) sounded like it was interesting with pork, prawn, vermicelli, bean sprouts, and deep-fried. I was kind of expecting the whole roll to be deep-fried but this actually turned out to be a deep-fried spring roll stuffed inside a prawn salad roll. I'll admit that this was an interesting combination but I would probably stick to ordering the individual items instead in the future.\\n\\nOur next dish to arrive were the Deep Fried Wontons ($7). These hot and crispy dumplings were pretty good but a bit oily (which is kind of to be expected since they're deep-fried).\\n\\nWe also ordered their Chicken Wings ($11) with traditional pepper and fish sauce. These turned out pretty good. I mean, they're not in the same league as Phnom Penh chicken wings but who is? I think I would have liked it had a bit more fish sauce flavour to the dipping sauce.\\n\\nI returned the next day for lunch because I really wanted to try their Banh Mi but, for some reason, they only served them until noon (that has since changed). First, however, I ordered their Spring Roll ($2) which is the same thing that you can find inside the MVP roll. A nicely deep-fried and crispy spring roll.\\n\\nThe Banh Mi ($5) that I selected had cold cuts, pate, onions, cucumber, carrots, daikon, and jalape√±o slices inside a beautifully crusty roll. I really appreciate that crunch you get when you bite into a banh mi and all of the crumbs go flying all over the table.\\n\\nThe following week, I decided it was about time that I tried one of their noodle soups... so I ordered the Bun Bo Hue ($13). This dish only comes in one size and it's a pretty hefty size with generous amounts of thinly sliced brisket, flank, and Vietnamese ham along with thick, round rice noodles. It also comes with hand-made pork balls which I thought were the best part of the dish but were decidedly small. Although the broth was a bit spicy, I thought that it was a bit lacking in terms of lemongrass flavour.\\n\\nWhen we returned for a revisit in early May, we ordered their regular Salad Roll along with a Custom Vermicelli Bowl ($14.50) where we picked the grilled chicken, grilled pork, and spring roll. I found the meats were grilled up pretty good and there were plenty of round, slippery, vermicelli noodles on the bottom of the bowl.\\n\\nWhen I returned in June, their old MVP signage appeared to have been completely replaced with their new name \\"Little Minh's\\" and their menu was updated as well (their banh mis are now available past noon). So I ordered the Grilled Chicken Banh Mi ($6.50). As with my earlier visits, the banh mi was pretty good with a nice crusty French roll which was filled with freshly grilled chicken meat, cucumber, pickled radish, pickled carrots, cilantro, pork pate, and Vietnamese mayo.\\n\\nPork Belly on Rice ($17) is one of the main entr√©es that I tried on their menu. While the thinly sliced pork had a nice crispy skin (think of Chinese-style roast pork), the meat itself wasn't too tender. It's a relatively hearty portion size and served with a sweet and spicy sauce.\\n\\nSome days I just crave for a banh mi... I noticed that they had a Beef Brisket Banh Mi ($6.50). The slight variation on this banh mi is the use of thinly sliced beef brisket.\\n\\nOverall, a good addition to the area."},{"name":"Joe's On Juniper","address":"1049 Juniper St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I am giving Joe's on Juniper this rating for a reason.

I layed the bread on some napkins and began my feast.  The salad (mostly lettuce) was chilled, but, not fresh.  There were a couple pieces of tomato and cucumber, but, they had no flavor.  Parts of the lettuce were brown, and, it was all drowned in a vinegar & oil concoction. \\n\\nThe Gyro meat was greasy and dry.  Way greasy for Gyro meat.  It had a flavor of beef which tasted more like those steak-ums, but, not quite as nasty.  Makes me wonder what kind of beef is pressed into their lamb/beef mix.  I was not happy with the salad or the meat.  It was just MEH overall.  As I was eating and moving things around in the bowl I came across some strange white substance that was hidden under the meat.  At first I was like WTF?  Upon further investigation I determined it to be the end product of liquid fat returning to its solid state.  \\n\\nNot sure what's going on here with the Gyro salads.  From the presentation and experience I had, I would bet the salads are pre-made days in advance and kept in the fridge.  As for the meat and the lard on the bowl?

Just wanted to address that the server was a little slow with the service, which is normally fine since in this area there is no rush to go anywhere. However,  my friend only had a 45 minute window to eat because she had to head to work and informed the server. By the time the food got to our table, we had to wait for a to go box and immediately pack it in a rush. They were also missing one side when we suggested another side they had to check but they were out of it too. After my friend left, the server thought she ran off on the check but I told her I was paying for hers then she was very apologetic which made things ok with me however, a status check on the order could have prevented this. To address my friends concerns, we saw multiple order after us and got their meal immediately 10-15 minutes. We had nothing complicated just fried chicken.

The menu is a bit strange - a mix of Latin-Vietnamese fusion with a sprinkle of Portland (\\"tacos\\" with lettuce wraps. Ugh.)  Simply looking at the menu, I didn't have high hopes.  But when the food came out (ordered the squid with sausage and a side of white rice), I was blown away by the subtle flavors of the sausage, fried squid tempura that was light and not oily, and the magnificent sauce.  The rice was cooked to perfection with the subtle sweetness.\\n- Decor.  The decor is beautiful and aesthetically wonderful to look at while drinking/eating.   But like the menu, it seemed to be confused.  It looked like a bar in Havana circa 1920s.  However, there's a strong Vietnamese theme to the place.  I suppose, if I tried really hard, I can visualize Saigon 1940s.  Even the font of the restaurant exudes Havana.  \\n- Music.  Great mix.\\n- Lighting.  As someone that's been in the hospitality industry for a long time, I feel as though many PDX restaurants don't pay attention to the lighting simply because they don't care about ambiance.  The lighting here was perfect - dim yet not too dark.\\n\\nCON\\n- Waitstaff.  This seems to be the problem with many wonderful Portland restaurants.  Restauranteurs and chefs (and the rest of the BOH) pour their passion into a remarkable place only to have the FOH dilute the magic.  There wasn't a hostess.   When we walked in, no one told us if we needed to be seated or we could seat ourselves.  We had to hunt down a waiter and ask.  The bartender and waitress were a bit .... Bleh.  They lacked passion.  This place is sexy from the decor to the food.  But as the waitress said when referring to making cocktails, \\"... It's just about making it look pretty and tasting good.  It's not chemistry.\\"  Sure, that's the basics.  But if you ask a chef, mixologist, foodie... There's so much more to dining... To life... than making it look pretty and tasting good.  A person that loves the pleasures of eating and drinking is looking for an EXPERIENCE.  We want to drink a cocktail that has nuances and subtleties.  A creation that entices all of our senses.  Personally, I don't particularly want to drink or eat something that wasn't created with intention.  Might be a bit extreme but if you truly love food/drinks... You can taste if something was created with a purpose.  This is the thing that separates people that cook for a living vs. chefs.  [Check out SUPERBITES or AFURI if your'e looking for an experience that will transform your life.]\\n\\nAll in all, it was an interesting place but I have no need to go back, despite the delicious food.  The waitstaff is always the deal breaker for me.  They are the middle person between the BOH and the customers.  It's such an experience to dine/drink with a staff that commands respect simply because they know what they're talking about, enjoy what they do, and enhance your experience as a customer.  Otherwise, what's the point?  Might as well just have a self-service station."},{"name":"Cathay Pacific Restaurant","address":"111 Hancock St","city":"North Quincy","stars":"3","text":"Terrible Chinese food!

The combination of the taste complimented each other.\\n\\nFor entr√©es, we ordered the braised beef shortribs in Punjabi style curry. Hands down one of the best curries I've had.

It was so delicious I had to order another one (no shame)! The almond rice pudding is a  great alternative if you do not want something too sweet or heavy. The pudding was refreshing.\\n\\nQuick tip: A glass of milk costs $4 at Vijs so for people who are not good with spicy food, note..the milk is overpriced.\\n\\nOverall experience here was awesome, service was great and definitely will be coming back again to try their regular menu!"},{"name":"Suerte","address":"1800 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Had an amazing dinner Saturday night!

A quick search on Yelp found the Olive Garden restaurant close to our hotel in Altamonte Springs.  An Olive Garden close to Orlando should be on top of its game since the Olive Garden parent company head office - Darden Restaurants - is a few miles away in Orlando, FL.\\n\\nWe were not disappointed.  Luckily a table was available promptly and Naome, our delightful waitress took our orders for drinks.  One slight disappointment was that no Florida draft beers were available so I opted for Yuengling, which at least used to be a craft beer in the not too distant past, and they do have a brewery in Frorida.  We chose the Stuffed Mushrooms as an appetizer to share.  These are baked with clams and several cheeses and are delicious.  Our breadsticks were delivered at the same time and the combination was delightful.\\n\\nFor a main course my wife ordered the Ravioli di Portobello.  This is ravioli filled with Portobello mushrooms and topped with a creamy cheese and sun-dried tomato sauce.  I ordered the Cucina Miai, a concept where you choose a pasta - I tried Wheat Linguine - then add a sauce - mine was five cheese marinara - finally finish with a topping - I couldn't resist the Italian sausage. \\n\\nWhile we waited for the main course to be prepared we enjoyed the mixed salad with lots of added Parmesan cheese, that is part of every meal at Olive Garden.\\n\\nOur food was tasty and filling, we enjoyed the meal a lot. I enjoyed a glass of Robert Mondavi Cabernet with my pasta and the bill, including tip was $64 for the two of us.  We paid our bill using the Tablet that is on every table and received a copy of the bill by email.  The tablet is about the size of an iPad and can be used to order desert and drinks.

My friend whom I dined with had recently eaten at Vij's prior (at the older location). Prior to our dinner, he attested to how good the food was but after the dinner, claimed there was a significantly noticeable difference.\\n\\nMy overall impression is that if you remove the hype, it's a decent, but not memorable experience. But then you add in expectations based on Vij's great reputation, the price point, the wait and so on, and it's a very different story.\\nThe space is warm and service is excellent. His front of house staff are extremely accommodating. I really appreciate the attention to detail and simple business sense in making things like complementary snacks available to guests while they wait, and not requiring you to order bread and naan separately. There were some issues in my service that night, but I was dining late so find it completely understandable.\\n\\nThe menu is very interesting. The cocktail list, while not my personal preference, is still very creative.  The actual food is where things fall short. \\nI found that almost all of the dishes that we had lacked the depth and complexity of flavours that I'm accustomed to in Indian food. \\nIt's a subtle difference, but the end result is the food tastes a little main stream, and lacks authenticity. It's a little like food for the masses. \\nThere were amateur mistakes as well like not salting dishes enough, and then there were frustrating dishes like the goat curry having a total of roughly 3 ounces of actual meat in it with green peppers that just didn't work.  \\nOut of the various dishes we ordered for dinner for four guests, there was not a single dish that we all enjoyed and almost 1/3rd of the food wasn't finished... and as a group we have healthy appetites. It just reflects how underwhelmed we were.  \\n\\nSummarily, I find this is an average restaurant. It didn't live up to expectations and I personally feel like I could have easily spent my money elsewhere for a much more memorable meal."},{"name":"Yebisuya","address":"6035 Peachtree Rd, Ste A-105","city":"Doraville","stars":"3.5","text":"Very traditional Japanese Izakaya restaurant.

I ended up ordering the Curry Shrimp (all entrees come wth rice and peas and cabbage), which was a very tough decision. If you're in the mood for seafood, keep in mind that all of their seafood dishes takes about 15-20 minutes to prepare. So I would highly recommend enjoying one of their fresh patties to help ease the hunger pains as you wait for your food to come out.  \\n\\nHands down their patties are THEE BEST I've ever tasted. The crust was the highlight of the patty, it had the perfect golden brown color and the right amount of flakiness. The curry shrimp was definitely fresh, just a tad bit too salty for my liking.

I got the Bacon Jam burger and the toppings were quite tasty. \\n\\nI liked the decor and theme of the place too.

If nothing else, order the Mac & Cheese skillet. Soooooo super yummy. For that alone, I'll return. And to order some drinks.  Also, my BF ordered their broccoli and cheese soup, which was also divine. Maybe I just really love cheese though..that's probably it. Everyone else at my table ordered burgers so I didn't get to sample much else of the menu. But what I had, I enjoyed. Nothing mind-blowing, but a million times better than any boring chain sports bar. \\n\\nThis is definitely a cool spot to hang out with friends. Reasonably priced, yummy food with a selection that is a little more creative than average, but basic enough to satisfy anyone. They also have board games that you're welcome to play at your table, which I like too.

I'm not sure their location will support this as it's a bit off the beaten path. We went to enjoy a couple beers after work, so for the casual drinker, the first thing I noticed was the price per ounce is high. If you just want to taste a little of a lot of beers, maybe, but if you just want a pint, you could easily pay $8-10 a pint for a beer from ABW or PHP. The self service I can see working if you know how to pour a beer and it was also nice to not have to wait on a server to order food at one of the many kiosks they had around. So then instead of servers they have people around to run food and pick up glasses. We accepted the inflated price of the beer thinking that all the extra costs associated with food runners were part of the higher price per ounce. But at the end of the evening, there's a 15% service charge tacked onto your bill. So four beers split between a couple (and no where near full pours) ran us over $40 where it would have been half that somewhere else. It's pricey. I get it, they are new and I hate writing reviews while they are trying to iron out alll the kinks, but they are so overpriced for what you get. This review only serves to let others know before going in that you're paying a lot for the novelty. Maybe they'll make adjustments.

The vibe going here is very relaxing and inviting. The color scheme is red and black and they have a huge painted mural of random anime and Japanese art. The store isn't very big with only about a dozen tables. However I just love the decor and vibe here \\n\\nMenu - as the name implies the main cuisine is ramen dishes. There is about 8 ramen dishes and then an assortment of other items like appetizers, tempura and don bowls. Not a very big menu but that's ok, stick to your guns. They do hit some of the main items for ramen like sukiyaki, tonkotsu and chashu. So not a big variety but a decent menu focused almost solely on ramen. \\n\\nService - came in around 1:00 and the place was empty aside from a couple in front ordering. There was a young Asian girl working the front and she was really friendly. She had a good demeanor and a good attitude. She spoke well and was very polite. I was also greeted by another Asian gentleman about halfway thru my meal to make sure everything was good.  So the people I interacted with were pretty cool and gave great service. They even bus your table for you, which always makes me feel bad because momma always says to clean up your own damn mess. So when I asked where do I put my dishes the gentleman said he would get it I was like are you sure? He was yeah. So I made sure to clean up and organize my table before I left. Super chill and friendly peeps \\n\\nFood - if some place says they have a signature dish i will always get it. Because if cant get your signature dish down then you probably cant make anything right. So I ordered the Kanji Ramen (pork bone and soy broth, chashu, wood ear mushroom, corn, nori, bamboo, ajitama egg, garlic and green onion).  The bowl is a pretty generous bowl of stuff. Obviously the ratio is mostly noodles and then the other ingredients. So I mix everything up and begin to chew down.  The broth was very nice.  It was a flavorful and savory broth that wasnt overly complex. A lot of people complain because they are used to a very robust and complex kick to the face. But this was a great savory broth that was simple but tasty. The menu says 3 pieces of chashu but I got way more than that. Which was awesome as the chashu was really good. Nice and flavorful and still tender and moist. It had a great taste. The other veggies were a nice compliment to the whole. Corn was sweet, bamboo crisp and mushrooms tasty.  It was definitely a nice ramen dish. It does come with 2 sheets of nori but I didn't see the use or necessity for it. I sure some people know why or how to use it (I mean yes, I know, eat it) but i feel like it was meant for something in particular. Overall this was a solid dish. I see some people saying bland but that might be because alot of other places use alot or spices and spicy ingredients. So that's what they are used to. But my dish was a great savory and tastey dish. \\n\\nOverall - I love the ambience of this place. It's very homey and just feels nice. The menu is simple but sticks to what they know best.

Rice was not typical chinese fried rice; more of a dirty wok taste. Crab rangoons were strictly cream cheese. Chicken wings were a 4 out of 10.

But first, a protip...\\n\\nPro-tip: Don't use Suerte's online booking. It rarely shows any availability. Act like human contact doesn't scare you and pick up the phone. Not only were we easily able to get a table on a Friday night, but there were 3 or 4 vacant tables around us as we ate. It's a hot restaurant, but not that hot, apparently. \\n\\nOnto the food. The suadero tacos are good. Really good. But so are the duck tacos. Personally I thought the nice punch of citrus put the duck tacos in the lead, but my wife felt like the duck was still too rich.\\n\\nWe were again split on the tetela. The wife found it to be incredibly well flavored, while I felt like it was a bit bland. Disclaimer: I had this immediately after the suadero tacos, so my definition of \\"rich\\" might have been badly skewed.\\n\\nWe all agreed that the chips with lentils/yogurt was a bit of a disaster. Not enough chips, and the ones that were provided were fragile and snapped off before you could get any condiments. \\n\\nNow credit where credit is due, Suerte doesn't lean on the \\"drown it in cheese\\" ethos that a lot of $4 taco places do. They really seek balance in each dish, like the chile watermelon broth in the ceviche, but if I'm honest,  it doesn't always work. \\n\\nSpeaking of balanced, I thought the drinks (Nada Paloma and the Don Dario) were very well executed, but the wife found them to be incredibly sweet. \\n\\nNow, culinarily speaking, there's nothing wrong with swinging for the fences and missing. But the trip really nose dived with our server. Our group of 7 was there for three hours, and the last hour it was readily apparent that they were trying to boot us out. I get it, prime time on a Friday, but there were two empty tables to either side of us. When we reviewed the bill, there were a few extra drinks on the tab that no one ordered. Boo.\\n\\nHow was it overall? asi asi\\nThere were some highs and some lows.

I could've used a bit more gravy though (I loooove me some gravy). I loved the fried tomatoes it was above average from any other joints I've had it in. I would order the fried green tomatoes again if I went back any time soon. It was tart and the tomatoes weren't smoothy or too greasy. Creamed corn was a-ok.\\n\\nWe teased my best friend a bit asking if she was at KFC because she ordered mashed potatoes with gravy and a side of coleslaw. She said she couldn't think of any other side to go with fried chicken (I would've done green beans and mashed potatoes though). The fried chicken was crispy on the outside and very juicy on the inside. I loved the skin. My best friend fed me all her skin cause she's  eating healthier so I consumed and inhaled all the delicious skin. It was so... so... delicious. Not too salty, not too greasy, crispy, and seasoned to perfection. \\n\\nThe pork chops were my favorite though. I loved it smothered in gravy, but I am biased. I love myself some gravy. I didn't think it was too salty, but Kungfu thought it was a bit on the salty side. The mac and cheese was a-ok, pasta was done al dente but the b√©chamel sauce was a bit lacking. I think I would've liked a nice cheese crust on top. The potato salad was average. The pork chops were done really well though. Juicy, tender, and seasoned well. It wasn't too greasy and they serve you two huge portions of pork chops! \\n\\nWe were too full to grab any cobbler (which I regret) but I would definitely go back for pork chops next time. I liked the pork chops better than the fried chicken.

I've experimented trying a different drink each time, but I have yet to find one that I'm super happy with - so hence the 4-star rating. \\n\\nBesides the pastries options that are wrapped for selection, they also have cakes in the display case and other food items that are made to order. I saw that they have shaved ice as well as warm red bean-filled pastries at the counter to order.\\n\\nThe noise level is usually pretty quiet here, so that why it's a good place for work productivity. They play instrumental versions of Korean pop songs at a pretty low volume, which makes it easier for concentration.

He's not a fancy type, but hey, if I'm paying, we are going to have a great food experience. \\n\\nWe started with the crispy potatoes and the mixed seafood tostada. The seafood was abundant!  Octopus, mussels, shrimp, and some veggies in a tomato based  sauce. Fantastic!  The potatoes were fluffy, with crisped skin and served over a tasty sauce (romesco ?) and seasoned well and had a generous dusting of cheese. \\n\\nThe braised brisket tacos were a must try and my favorite dish of the evening. Que sabor!  You get four with each order and the avocado based salsa rounds out the flavors. Next up, we shared the green Chile tamal. I can't rave enough about the masa here!  The perfect texture and flavor and, while this wasn't a traditional tamal, it was fantastic, spicy, flavorful and amazingly good. \\n\\nOur final course, which we couldn't finish because we were stuffed, was the red fish. Served with tortillas, onions, salsa and veggies, it was delicious, even eaten cold the next day. \\n\\nI highly recommend Suerte and am eager to go back and try a few new things.

The shower and toilet were very clean and the separate wash sink had toiletries, a blow dryer, and a built in TV inside the mirror. There was also a bonus glass weight scale which I found accidentally underneath...lol\\n\\nWe went downstairs to explore and found a market with a sandwich shop. I think they also offer pizza and fresh baked pastries. It's basically a one stop shop where you can pick up beer, juices, sodas, wine, to-go salads and other snacks in modern clean environment. Right next to the market, there's a retail shop selling nick nacks and clothing. I know this hotel also has several restaurants including ant Italian steakhouse and 24 diner but we didn't have time to check it out.\\n\\nThis Hyatt is for sure a world class hotel and conveniently located on I-Drive.

There's nothing like gathering on a weekend morning with a group of friends and enjoying some good comfort food with mimosas and blood Marys. I'm sure a lot of Atlanta feels that way since it seems like there was a pretty good turnout at the 2018 Brunch Festival. And because, there was a ton of waiting - waiting to get in the festival, waiting to get food, waiting to get drinks, waiting to get more food, etc. \\n\\nSince Atlanta Brunch Festival did take place in Atlanta Station, you had access to the garage which has plentiful of paid parking. That's of course you didn't Uber or Lyft there.\\n\\nAs far as the restaurants involved, you had: Another Broken Egg, Apres Diem, Atlanta Breakfast Club, Babalu Tapas and Tacos, Bar Margot, Bon Glaze, Cake Hag, City Winery, Dominic's Pizza, Eclipse de Luna, Hoyle's, Low-Co Motion, Nana G's, Not as Famous Cookie Co, Piastra, Proposito, Roti Rolls, and more. Food was served in smaller portions priced at $3 each. If you had the unlimited alcohol package, there were a number of craft beer and wine options, as well as cocktails such as brunch punch, screwdrivers, mimosas, and bloody Marys. \\n\\nSince alcohol was involved, this was a 21 and up event only and everyone who bought a ticket had to show ID prior to getting in. While understandable, it did slow down the entrance line tremendously. If you got there between 12-1, you were probably in this line for at last 20-30 minutes. Once you got in, you got your wrist band, and if you got the alcohol package, got a reusable cup for your drinks.\\n\\nThe last food festival I had gone to was Taste of Atlanta and while I am sure the much less wait times could be attributed partially to more vendors being available, the wait times for food at certain vendors was as much as 30 minutes or more. With the festival itself for non-VIP ticket holders being 4 hours, you probably couldn't hit up everything you wanted to. Fortunately the lines at the alcohol tents weren't too bad. \\n\\nAs far as food goes, some of the highlights for me were:\\n- Nana G's chicken and waffles \\n- Roti Rolls Grandstand grits\\n- Not as Famous cookies and ice cream\\n\\nI didn't particularly enjoy Bar Margot's duck confit chorizo and potato hash cake - it wasn't that flavorful and it was probably the smallest portion of food I saw anywhere. \\n\\nOverall, it was an okay experience.

Everything you think of when it comes to Mexican food in this town, this is not it.  With exception of 1 burrito/chimichanga on the menu and the chips, it is a stand-alone one-of-a-kind restaurant which deserves high praise. \\n\\nFrom the moment we walked in, we were greeted by the friendly owner and family.  Chips and salsa was excellent.  Charred tomatoes and chilies are the highlights of the salsa.  There is a reason they sell it in 8 or 16oz to go (and it's more affordable than farmer's market salsas and better).  The house margaritas are made with fresh lemon, lime, agave and good quality tequila.  Perfect blend of tart and sweet.  I would rate their margarita up there in my top 5 all time favorites (I order margaritas everywhere I go, not just Mexican restaurants)!\\n\\nNow, on to the cuisine:  I would describe the food as upscale, yet, comfortable; almost rustic in the sense that they don't try to be overly complex, but let the products (fresh meat and vegetables) speak for themselves.   The Enchiladas de Spinacas are like nothing I've had at any other Mexican or Latin American restaurant.  Fresh, tender corn tortillas are stuffed with fresh sauteed spinach, mushrooms, grilled corn and onions, then topped with a beautiful poblano cream sauce that is subtle and well balanced along with fresh pico.  This is served along side fresh roasted potatoes and carrots cooked and flavored to perfection.  The rice is flavored with umami! It looks unassuming, but was fluffy and tasted amazing.  The other dish we tried was the Pollo Relleno.  My first description is that it's an upscale Mexican version of chicken cordon bleu,  A large chicken breast is stuffed with ham, cheese and spinach then topped with a beautiful cream sauce (like a bechamel with what I assume to be pan drippings from cooking the chicken/ham).  Nothing was too heavy, nor was it rabbit food.  There's some serious culinary sauce making magic going on in the Conin kitchen.\\n\\nWe finished with the ubiquitous churros with sweet cream and caramel sauce which were piping hot and an excellent end to a fantastic dinner. \\n\\nEverything was made to order and from the freshest ingredients.  It reminded me of farm fresh, farm to fork with an elevated comfort Latin flare.  \\n\\nWe can't wait to return and work our way through their unique menu.\\n\\nIf you are expecting spicy American-Mexican food, this is not it--as it's so much better."},{"name":"Smallwares","address":"4605 NE Fremont St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I don't know...this place just didn't do it for me.

Also, I pass it all the time on the Beltline. The atmosphere walking in wasn't what I expected, but I actually enjoyed it a lot. They had great hip hop music playing, it was very simple (lots of concrete), and people were dressed casually. We sat inside, but the view of the beltline is great for those who sit outside. Our waitress was extremely friendly and cool. I wanted to be her BFF! We followed all of her recommendations. We started by ordering cocktails - I got the Cool Weather Pimms. Talk about a pretty drink! It tasted amazing too--very unique. My date got the Pepper Jelly Bramble, which was good, but a little too spicy for my taste. The fruit leather in it was beautiful! While we waited for the drinks, we got the $2 \\"beer while you wait\\" - we loved that idea. Just a simple, good, small beer to sip on. \\n\\nFor food, our waitress recommended 3 dishes per person. I think that was a good amount. I wouldn't do more than that unless you have a really big appetite. We started with the warm kale salad, the broiled oysters, and the hibiscus marinated beets. The warm kale salad is a must-have. The sauce served with it was so perfect. I think I would skip the beets the next time around, but I won't knock them. Still good. The oysters were spicy and delicious.\\n\\nOur last three courses were the beef tartare, Duck Wellington, and the seared scallops. Unless you're vegetarian, PLEASE do not skip any of these. The beef tartare was the most recommended dish by the wait staff, for good reason. They mix it up in front of you and on top of the potato slice, it melts in your mouth. The duck Wellington was also unbelievably savory and drool-worthy. However, it had fois gras in it, which understandably turns some people off. The seared scallops were probably my favorite dish served that night. I loved the fall theme with butternut squash. So so so amazing. 5 stars!!!"},{"name":"Pisces Rising","address":"239 W 4th Ave","city":"Mount Dora","stars":"3.5","text":"The atmosphere alone is worth the trip. The service was great.

I tried it with the sausage & asked for a side of mustard...It was pretty good, but not worth the $7 or $8 I paid for it.  The Kaiser bun was standard size, as far as breakfast sandwiches go, but the sausage patty was very thin.  Not too many toppings and it ran a bit on the expensive side.  Maybe if it came with avocado or a double sausage patty or some kind of incredible secret sauce, then it might be worth it.

I really wanted to like this place but it was just awful. The food is not Brazilian at all as another reviewer noted. That itself is not a deal-breaker, but on top of that it just does not taste good. Also, even though it is called Brazilian \\"grill\\" I did not see a grill and all the meats were in a hot tray like you see at Chipotle.\\n\\nI had the beef option, feijoada, and the veggie entree option which is beets and some other kind of root. They were all quite bland. I also had the p√£o de quiejo (cheese bread balls) and even though I am pretty sure it was the frozen pre-made kind it was actually good.\\n\\nThe staff also didn't seem to understand the food or concept and served waaaay too much rice and hardly any beef. That last part is forgivable since they just opened and are probably working out the service kinks.\\n\\nBut I don't want to just rail on the place so I will provide some constructive criticism to make it better:\\n1) Get some lingui√ßa (Brazilian sausage) for the love of god!! It is an integral part of Brazilian grilled food and even more importantly it tastes delicious and is super easy to make. Seriously, just throw some lingui√ßa on a plate with rice, vinaigrette, and farofa it will be an improvement. Here is a bonus: throw it in the feijoada to up the deliciousness.\\n2) Make your food from scratch! Making beans, rice, and p√£o de quiejo from scratch seems more in line with the restaurant's mission statement than taking it from a can.\\n3) Get a grill or rotisserie! If you get a grill you can cook \\"espetinhos\\" (meat skewers) on it. Because they are thin you can cook them to order and people eat them off the stick so they don't need a knife and fork. If you get the rotisserie option you can just carve the meat right off the rotisserie when people order it. Alternatively just roast the meat and carve it, but choose better quality meat. It is difficult to replicate Brazilian grill style because they use no spices besides olive oil and salt, but they use high quality meat and expert cooking to make it taste fantastic. Perhaps the beef I had at 5 on Black was so bland because it tried to replicate the Brazilian seasoning (just salt) but was not high quality nor expertly cooked.\\n4) Ditch the fancy sauces! The food with the sauces ends up coming out like a curry. Don't bother with the sauce and just focus on making all the components better.\\n5) Jazz up your farofa! You can add things like bacon or little pieces of meat, lingui√ßa, or onion. But you have to cook it and not use the instant, no-cook farofa.\\n\\nThat's all, best of luck. I hope you can turn it around so I can come and enjoy a meal."},{"name":"Mattie's","address":"811 W Live Oak St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Food: 3/5\\nDrinks: 3/5\\nService: 5/5\\nAmbient: 5/5\\n\\nWas I impressed by the food and drinks?

The night before I had been tapping my toes at an Irish pub named Raglan Road, and I remembered seeing a tea shop across the walkway. That's what brought me to Tea Traders Caf√©, run by Joffrey's, an  importer and roaster of gourmet coffees, loose-leaf teas, and flavoring syrups. Joffrey's is also the official coffee and tea supplier for Walt Disney World.\\n\\nTea Traders is a modern world-meets-old world tea caf√© experience featuring teas from the finest tea gardens around the globe. They offer the visual beauty and taste of loose leaf teas prepared in a variety of ways; steeped hot, iced, blended, spirited and even edible (in the form of delicious cookies). The shop is small, but filled with the amazing scents of loose-leaf teas on display around the caf√©.\\n\\nThe employees are very friendly, and they'll encourage you to try small samples of the various steeped tea selections until you find something that appeals to your tastes. They will also show you the magical wall of tea where they'll help educate you on the various styles of loose-leaf teas, and watch them blend custom selections which are then sold for home brewing. \\n\\nYou can order loose-leaf tea to take home, or order a to-go cup of hot, iced, blended, or spirited tea to carry with you as you wander the shop. They mix liquors like Bailey's, Captain Morgan, Maker's Mark, Jameson, and Skyy vodkas with your tea to make a refreshing drinks with a nice kick.\\n\\nSince I was mid-way through a work day, I stuck with an unsweetened green blackberry jasmine tea, and added a shot of honey for sweetness. Very tasty, and well worth the walk through Disney Springs for a nice glass of iced tea.\\n\\nIf you're hungry, Joffrey's has tea-infused cookies and pastries available for purchase."},{"name":"Pie Five Pizza Co","address":"11325 University Blvd, Ste 206","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Decided to give this place another try since I got a coupon, this time I just chose a signature pizza instead of making my own.

It's a standalone building and on the night we went, we walked in as a couple was finishing up dinner.   The decor is rather dated and old with knicknacky stuff on all of the walls and ledges along with what looked like fake plants.   But I always make a point to never judge restaurants by decor alone.  We were greeted and told we could pick any table so we picked one of the booths with a window. \\n\\nThe whole time we dined here no one ever came in so it was like we had the restaurant all to ourselves! Our waitress was great and we definitely got one on one attention. We ordered lots of food but happy overall with everything. For our appetizers, we ordered the vegetarian grape leaves and the tiro kafteri spread. My husband can't stand grape leaves which just meant more for me! They were soooooooo good with the tzatziki sauce. They come stuffed with rice, dill and olive oil. You can always choose to get the option with beef.   I wish this place was close to work because I would order the grapeleaves for lunch. Delcious and filling! The tiro kafteri spread was really yummy- feta cheese with greek spices and other goodies. It had a definite kick so if you're not a fan of anything hot or spicy this may not be for you. It was great with the pita bread and totally addictive. \\n\\nOn to the entrees.....Hubby went with the supergyro combo...the wrap had lamb and rotisserie chicken. He loved. Not much more I can say about it. I went with the chicken kabob plate which came with onions and peppers, green beans with a tomato sauce, rice pilaf, pita breat and tzatziki sauce.  The chicken was delcious and tender. The only thing I was indifferent to was the green bean side. I probably would opt for something different next time but it wasn't terrible.  I ate about 1/4 of my meal so it just meant more leftovers for lunch the next day!\\n\\nThey have desserts in their front case at the counter so I got a slice of Galaktoboureko (don't even ask me to pronounce that) to go. It is filled with semolina custard drizzled with honey. Heads up, make sure to microwave a minute if you are bringing home to eat .

This is one of my absolute favorite spots in Midtown, and here's why:\\n\\n- the atmosphere is so much fun! It's always somewhat crowded and everyone is having a blast.\\n- the best outdoor patio in nice weather. Large enough to fit tons of tables, shaded by trees, just an all-around great happy hour and dinner spot!\\n- the food is good, the drinks are even better.\\n- the staff is so friendly and always easy to get along with.\\n\\nThere are a couple issues that occur every time we go, though, and it really turned my girlfriend off from eating here. The primary issue is that the service, albeit friendly, is at a snail's pace. Almost always, there seems to be no sense of urgency among the staff. The last time we were there, it took 10 minutes for us to be greeted by our server. Then, 30 minutes went by between us getting our food and our server checking on us again - and we desperately wanted more drinks. Once we ordered our drinks - two appletinis, three shooters - it took another 20+ minutes to actually get the drinks. This is pretty typical for service at Joe's. Sometimes we end up closing out our checks and sitting at the bar if we're still interested in hanging out after our meal because the bartenders are typically faster and more efficient.\\n\\nMy favorite thing to order is the edamame pods (make sure to specify pods over hummus). The sea salt on the pods is amazing. Sometimes they randomly add some sort of pepper seasoning as well, but I prefer it with the salt only. You never know what you're gonna get, though, it's different every time I go. My go-to meal is the Thai Nachos - great to split and SO delicious. Pro tip: the dipping sauce for the edamame pods is also on the Thai Nachos. Save your sauce from your edamame pods appetizer for some extra sweetness on the nachos!\\n\\nOther great eats: jalape√±o poppers (but sometimes they're out of stock and can't serve them), the salads are actually quite good, the wings are delicious. My girlfriend loves the Impossible Burger made as the Cabana Boy (with no bacon, since she's vegetarian). The tots and fries are about as good as any bar tots and fries. What really shines for me are the beverages - the bar is pretty great. Joe's on Juniper has an awesome selection of beers, wine, martinis, shooters, shorties, specialty drinks, etc. The food and drink keep us coming back, even though we expect very slow service and a long night out.\\n\\nAnother Pro Tip: sign up for the Metroentertainment Card! We swipe it every time we go and earn money off our next meal. We're up to $20 off the next time we go.\\n\\nAnd, in case you live in under a rock, this is a HELLA gay friendly gay sports bar. I've seen some confused out-of-towners stumble in on a random Saturday and look very, very confused at the signage and guests. It's hilarious."},{"name":"Carlucci's of Winter Park","address":"501 N Orlando Ave, Ste 145","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3.5","text":"The first surprise of Carlucci's is that when you ask for oil and vinegar, you won't get the usual bland, colorless vegetable oil that many restaurants serve. You get peppery, green, extra virgin olive oil. That's what kind of a place it is. The decor isn't fancy, but it's the best independently owned, mom-and-pop Italian restaurant in Orlando or Winter Park, and they have the most flavorful pizza in Central Florida. I know this because I've probably eaten at every pizza place in town, and nobody else even comes close. Carlucci's homemade sauce is particularly delicious because it's loaded with garlic and extra virgin olive oil. The best pizza is the meat lover's pizza with extra sauce, tomatoes, and garlic. They also have the best baked bruschetta in town. A full order is $9, and it's a meal in itself. (I order mine with capers and a side of pomadoro.) Can't say enough good things about Carlucci's.

The manager, Chris, and party helper, Victoria, were both extremely helpful and made the party super fun.  However, I saw the other party assistants standing around on numerous occasions chatting with each other.  I had to ask them to do things many times (they were asked at least twice to go get the kids waters and the birthday girl's food was not put in so she couldn't eat with the other kids).  There was also another employee, Marshonn, who made at least 6 kids cry at the party (she seemed to get a kick out of doing this).  You have to be a certain height to enter the laser tag or ropes course area and those 6 kids were a pin mark if anything from being the correct height (multiple parents even said that their kids measured the 48 inches in the doctor's office) and she did not let them partake in the laser tag.  These sames kids were allowed to partake in the ropes course.  She proceeded to argue with other employees and the manager about this.  All employees agreed she was being extremely mean to the children and ridiculous.  I will never have a party there again.  I can have a private party at Sparkles for that kind of money and the kids would never be treated like that there.  Way to end a birthday party!  Send off numerous kids crying.

For the past few days, I called highly rated Chinese restaurants in the area (downtown and the Cambie corridor) and, to my surprise and dismay, all were closed on Christmas Day! I wasn't keen on the idea of driving into Richmond to get take-out, so I was bummed out but then had the forethought to ask my fellow Yelpies for advice. And a knowledgeable Yelper recommended this place.\\n\\nAnd lo! and behold, it was open on Christmas! I initially called on the 24th and asked if I could place my order online then, for the following day (Xmas, the 25th), but the lady said no, I should call on the day of pick-up, on Christmas Day proper. There was no way to order online, I would have to call.\\n\\nMost of the Chinese restaurants in the area offer free delivery but this place does not. But at least it is open on Christmas Day!\\n\\nSo today on the 25th I called up at 12:30pm and placed my order, saying I'd be by at 4pm for the pick-up. The lady repeated my order and she got it right, and I repeated that I'd be there at 4pm. \\n\\nAfter our family's holiday afternoon festivities, I rush to get our food and I'm there exactly at 4pm. I knew it would be busy and, sure enough, the restaurant was bustling (especially at the front counter, with people getting their take-out orders and also paying their bills after dining in). It was a cluster-f with the few ladies behind the counter answering the phone and taking orders, and getting peoples' orders and seating walk-ins, and looking for peoples' orders (scrawled on tiny papers taped to the front cash register and in a pile by the phone. Some ladies were scurrying between the counter and the cooking area by the back with papers in hand). \\n\\nThe lady who seemed to be in charge couldn't find my order. Not on a paper note (like all the other call-in's) or cooked and packaged up, like many others on a counter behind the cash. She went and looked \\"in the back\\" in the kitchen; not there either. So my order wasn't made. I sat and waited for them to cook my four dishes while walk-in customers who arrived after me placed orders and got them, paid and left while I still waited. I was not impressed. I know it's their busiest day (as the lady repeatedly reminded me), but this was not a good first impression for a new customer. My family was waiting for me at home to continue our Christmas celebrations. And I'm waiting and waiting for my four dishes that they forgot to make, despite my calling nearly four hours in advance, and the day prior too. Oh, and the lady said that they \\"sold out\\" of the sweet Chinese donuts I ordered when I called earlier (they apparently didn't put my order aside for me and just sold their whole inventory of them that afternoon). Not cool. \\n\\nLuckily I had read the Yelp reviews for this place so I knew that they only accepted cash or debit cards (no credit cards here). \\n\\nAfter waiting 15-20 minutes and paying ($68 for four dishes! I believe their prices are higher than listed on their website), I finally got my order and drove home. And here is why I'm giving this place four stars: the food was excellent. Like, really excellent. Fresh and flavorful and real comfort food as I recall from my childhood. And it was packaged well, too (bonus for that. I can't stand when you get take-out and the boxes are flimsy and soggy or the contents leak. These containers were plastic with tight lids, with nice chopsticks and spoons and napkins too). So this place was inefficient with their ordering \\"system\\", they don't deliver, they lost my order and kept me waiting on a holiday, they didn't save my ordered donuts, they charge more than their site's listed prices and they don't take credit cards. If their food wasn't as good as it is, I'd give this place one star. But the food is good. Really good. And the prices are still reasonable for the amount of food you get. And if what you ultimately want is fresh and tasty food, AND a place that's open on Christmas, this is a four-star place.

If I could, this would be zero star.  We only came here because we received a Groupon as a gift.  I kept seeing this place on Groupon, but never thought of coming out here. \\n\\nLet's start from the beginning.  Located in a cluster of shops and restaurants off No 1 Road in Steveston, it was not easy to find, as there was no sign guiding customers from No 1 Road. But we found it, tugged in the alley side, with a parking lot in front of it. \\n\\nUpon entry, you can tell we went back in time.  The place was never renovated since the 70s, it seems.  Dark interiors, dark furnitures, and a dark sushi bar.  Yes, a dark, not so well lit sushi bar.  \\n\\nWe were greeted by a middle age Asian waitress, clad in a Japanese hapi jacket, who struggled with an energetic Japanese greeting irasshaimase with a heavy accent.  I said we made a reservation, but as I turned toward the tables, I quickly realized that I didn't need one.  There was only one more party of three seated at one of the teppan tables.  Of course, we were seated at the same station, so that they only need to use one grill. \\n\\nWe were asked if we have a Groupon, which we promptly presented. In return, she promptly presented the Groupon menu.  It showed basically the same items listed in Groupon - a so-called 10 course meal but only if you count everything separately. \\n\\nWithin minutes, our main seafood and meat items arrived...on a plastic tray like the ones you see in food fair or school cafeteria!  (Yes, I have a photo to show).  Worksafe and Health Canada would have a field day with this unsanitary practice. \\n\\nOur \\"chef\\" was a young 20 something male, who did know how to fling a knife, but not much else.  He was cooking the lobster for the other party, and somehow we knew it wasn't that fresh.  He then proceeded to cook veggies for them, but the volume was rather large.  We then realized that he was also cooking ours already....BEFORE the meat and seafood items.  (Normal practice is to cook the seafood and meat first, so that you enjoy them on an empty stomach).  \\n\\nSo, by the time he finishes cooking the veggies, at least 20 minutes have passed since our meat on the plastic tray was delivered to the station.  Yes, our raw meat and seafood have been sitting there in room temp on a plastic tray which who knows how many times it was used for raw meat before it was washed. \\n\\nSo after the veggies, we thought we were going to finally get our meat and seafood, but the chef took out the fried rice to cook for both us and the other party.  I specifically talked to the chef and said we would like our rice served last please.  He said, \\"Of course!\\" and went on to cook our fried rice!!!  Ugh! But then he didn't serve it to us, and instead let it sit on the grill, supposed to keep it warm. So by the time it was served to us after our meat and seafood, it lost its heat. \\n\\nOnto the meat and seafood.  We had each three pieces of so-called prawns which was barely larger than shrimps, a basa fillet which was thin and not so fresh, and a piece of red meat that's supposed to be sirloin. The shrimps were fine.  Nothing exciting.  The fish was super salty.  They put some kind of yellow pasty looking sauce on top.  At first, I thought maybe it was miso, but it didn't taste like it.  I simply don't know what I was eating.  The steak was fine at first, but once it cools down a bit, it became chewy, indicating it wasn't a fine cut in any way. \\n\\nI waved the waiter down, and spoke to him in Cantonese, questioning why we were served the veggies first, when the other party was served the seafood first.  He had the nerve to LIE and said it's because they had the lobster menu.  I asked how is that different, to which he didn't really answer.  (Meanwhile, two more parties arrived after us - two tourist looking foreigners, and a larger loud group at another station.  And they were all served the veggies after the meat.) I explained to the waiter that the usual procedure is to serve the meat and seafood first, then the veggies.  That's how all other teppanyaki restaurants serve, including one that I myself worked at.  Sure enough, he asked if I'm from the industry.  I just gave him a blank look.  Knowing that he is caught not knowing what he's doing, or at least saying, he smiled and started walking away. \\n\\nWhen we were \\"enjoying\\" our last \\"course\\" the ice cream, he actually came by and offered us more ice cream!  Feeling guilty, perhaps. We politely declined the offer.  \\n\\nWe paid the bill (tax and grat - less than 10%), and couldn't get out of there fast enough.

She had absolutely no clue what \\"vegetarian\\" meant apparently because she suggested steak.  Yes, she was definitely a native English speaker.

Finally, I \\"helped\\" her make the decision and said \\"I noticed you have cheese enchiladas on here, no meat on those right?\\"\\n\\nOkay, so I thought everything was groovy, but my cheese enchiladas came out with large chunks of beef in the sauce.

Being a food fanatic, The Wave seemed like a great choice. It certainly was!\\n\\nAfter hitting magic kingdom for the beginning of the 24 hour celebration on May 24th, I split off from my sister and her husband to get some good grub. As you  may have noted in my previous Disney reviews, their appetites are similar to those of your 5 year old son. Hot Dogs, Chicken Fingers, Pizza, and Nachos. Don't get me wrong; all great in their own right. But for someone like me, who loves food, I wanted to experience my meal, not just grab something quick at the park. There was no chance I was getting to the Wave for dinner with them, so I decided to break off and doing my own thing after our visit to MK. By the way, if you hit magic kingdom early enough, you can get everything done in half a day! We felt so efficient! It also helped that my pregnant sister took our park hoppers while we rode space mountain.\\n\\nOnto the important stuff: I arrived and was seated promptly at the bar. I never got a good look at the restaurant. I did get to walk into 'a wave,' as the restaurant's opening simulates this experience. there were a few lounge rooms off to the side of the bar that were dimly lit, and nicely kept. I'm sure the place is hopping at dinner time.\\n\\nI was one of two people in the bar area. My server, and the bartender, was named Orlando. I thought it was funny because I was in Orlando (or the vicinity). Anyways, I never really got a good look at where he was from... now I have to go back.\\n\\nI ordered my standard water. I'm a cheap date, what can i say. I had alot more written here, but yelp is limiting my review.\\n\\nAfter spending sometime looking over the menu, I decided on the Black Bean Chili with the Jalape√±o Corn Muffin. I also knew what I wanted to order. I went with the Grass Fed beef burger, cooked medium, with roasted potato wedges and the Florida sweet corn salad with lime, bell peppers, and sweet onions. I actually requested the seasonal veggies as my side, but either he forgot or couldn't do it. Either way, I was not upset. The burger also came with a salsa verde and a three cheese spread on the side.\\n\\nTo start, the chili was very good. It was soupier than I like my usual chili, but still very tasty. The jalape√±o corn muffin was the bread winner, pun intended. I put half on the muffin in the chili, which was topped with dollop of sour cream (love the word dollop). The amount was perfect. Not too much, not too little though. Just enough to cool it down, although it was not spicy. I enjoyed eating the corn muffin by itself a bit more than in the chili. My only complaint: The chili and muffin were 8.49! This was not a bowl of chili, it was a very small cup, and the muffin was pretty tiny too. \\n\\nThe Burger was very good. During my research, I discovered that the menu featured bison. Upon arrival, the menu had the same sides as listed on numerous websites, but instead of bison, it was grassfed beef. Not to worry! My burger was cooked perfectly, and I enjoyed the lettuce, tomato, and red onion that came with it. It was probably a 4 star burger, by itself, overall. HOwever, the salsa verde and three cheese spread made this meal excellent. Upon sampling both of them, I actually ate both sides by themselves, which I wish i didn't do, because I didn't have enough for the burger! The salsa was zesty, not spicy. Right up my alley. My favorite part of the burger had to be the three cheese spread, though. I'm not sure what cheeses were in the mix, but they were very creamy. If I were to guess, I would say that blue cheese was one of them, but the other two were much more powerful. You'll have to go to sample yourself! \\n\\nThe sides were excellent as well. I'm not a fry eater (thanks fat days) at all anymore, but these were 'roasted' potatoes. I don't think they fried them, but they had bread crumbs on the outside. With a little bit of ketchup, these babies were excellent. I only received about 5 or 6, which was too little (A good thing in the long run, I would have eaten a ton more). As for the sweet corn salad, it was light, tangy, and very tasty. It also came topped with feta cheese, which I failed to mention before. All in all, a very good meal. THe burger and sides were moderately priced too, which is rare in WDW! (13.99)\\n\\nMy other complaint is how Orlando left me hanging during my meal. I was slammin waters to start, but he hung me out to dry (literally) during my meal. I like having a full drink while eating, a weird quirk of mine.\\n\\nThe Wave is a definite must for food fanatics visiting Disney. I will have to try breakfast or dinner when I go back.

For the past 15 years I've lived in Orlando, the quality and speed of the food service has set it apart from other Chinese Take-Out spots in this city and others. To be specific, you can expect a 4-course meal to be prepared in 15 minutes or less without the taste and quality taking a dip. The meals quality is reflected in the freshness of their ingredients. A good example of this would be their freshly rolled dough for the dumplings or their addictive hot oil that comes with the meals. The family working behind the stoves are seen constantly prepping and cooking the meals to order, leaving nothing frozen. Meals to recommend include the chicken wings and house special fried rice, general tso tofu, chicken chow fun noodles, singapore noodles, sesame chicken, egg foo young, and their wonton soup. The head chef is very personable and fluent in multiple languages making the customers from unique communities feel comfortable and welcome. The portions and price are another reason my family and I have made this our go-to take-out spot. The prices are beyond fair for the large amount of delicious food provided in the meals. All in all, this spot has left one of the biggest impressions out of all the restaurants I've visited in Orlando.

We chose the patio, because...instant gratification is a thing. \\n\\nThe free chips and salsa came out almost immediately. I was surprised that the salsa was spicy. It was delicious, but I'm used to restaurants wanting to appeal to a more...bland palate should I say. I was happy that there was a little kick! The chips and salsa we bottomless and as soon as we finished one basket our waiter was literally waiting to drop off the next. \\n\\nThe wait for the actual food was a bit long. We ordered a fajita shrimp quesadilla for an appetizer. It came with pico de gallo, guacamole, and sour cream. The guacamole was my favorite and I would 100% order a side of that next time for the chips. The shrimp quesadilla overall was very good. I would definitely order it again. \\n\\nFor my actual meal I got grilled shrimp tacos. Clearly I love shrimp. It came with two tacos and a side of black beans. The tacos were a little bland but much improved with a dash of salt.

Century is owned by the Lightning Bar Collective, the group behind Jackknife, Bye & Bye, and a couple others in the Portland area.  The theme seemed cool for Century, and honestly it is pretty cool.  As far as how they utilize the theme, I'm not so sure.\\n\\nLet me explain.  I came on Saturday to watch the Timbers game.  It happened to also be the first Saturday of college football.  The main room with the bleacher seating had some space, but they only had 2 different football games on all the TVs in the room.  All the Timbers fans were relegated to the outdoor space.  That was fine, but was kind of hoping to experience the bleacher seating atmosphere.  Seemed like they could have at least had the Timbers on one screen.\\n\\nThe beer options were very limited with only 4 or 5 taps.  This was at the outdoor bar.  Now that I look at their online menu, it says they have more draft, but that wasn't specified as available at the outdoor bar.  The food was just ok.  I had the philly cheese steak and it had a good amount of meat on it.  Most everything is fried or typical bar food like nachos or a burger.  The philly came with a side of chips and I asked if they could sub a salad.  The response was \\"we don't have any kind of salad.\\"  Clearly the food portion of this bar is not a main priority.  They have \\"gluten free\\" menu and it's basically the same menu with gluten free ingredients subbed out.\\n\\nI've heard this place turns into quite the club a la Jackknife in the evenings.  The bouncer was prepping for the crowd and set up the barricades, so I believe it does get rowdy.  Not sure how they fit that many people into that place cause it's fairly small on the floor.

First time was just passed by and found inside looks modern so we waited for a table. The menu has pictures all items but it's on the pricey side. For our family of 4(2 adults, 2 kids under 6), we paid about $120 for the bill. This place is really busy and you can't get a table if come during 6-8pm. I loved the fish dish(they used real fish fillet, not the frozen packaged fillet). The chicken in a pot is very tasty too and highly recommended. The pickle is refreshing. However they do limit dining to 1.5 hour as they seem to take booking as 6-7:30,7:30-9:00. If you come around 8:30pm, you can likely get a table without booking. Or go at 5:45pm like we did one time on the day, we got a table too but limited to leave within 1 hour. Some ppl may not like it. For the food quality, it's worth the wait especially for first timer.

I also tried the drunken noodles, which were good but a little too spicy for me. But other than that, the portion sizes are generous so you get a pretty good amount of food for what you end up spending (easily $30-40).\\n\\nI highly recommend Pandan Leaf and will be ordering from them again!"},{"name":"Dinesty Dumpling House","address":"1719 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I discovered this place while taking a walk after dinner at Guu, which was across the street, when I saw a line out the door. If there's a line out the door, the place must be decent. Then when we were shopping, one of the shop owners highly recommended this place and its smoked duck dish. Line out the door + recommendation from a local = must check it out! \\n\\nCame here for lunch on a Sunday and the place was packed out the door again. We waited around 25 minutes for a table. Once we were brought to our table, the hostess then tells us that we have 1 hour and 15 minutes before we have to give them back the table. Not used to this timed eating, but we still managed. \\n\\nMenu is extensive. So study it while waiting so you can order as soon as you sit down. The regular menu has pictures which would be more helpful. But if you're afraid of being overwhelmed with too many pictures, the to go menu would be a better choice. \\n\\nWhat we ordered: \\nSMOKED DUCK - This is definitely a must try! The smokiness was just perfect, and not overpowering. The duck was so juicy and tender. It comes with some buns on the side to eat with the duck, but I found that the buns to be a bit dry. If they gave some sauce, duck and bun would have been good together. So save room and just eat the duck and skip the bun! \\n\\nSHREDDED CHICKEN AND CLEAR RICE NOODLE SALAD - This was a cold appetizer with shredded chicken and sheets of clear rice noodles mixed with cucumbers in a sesame sauce. I highly recommend this dish! It's refreshing, especially on a hot summer day. And add a little chili oil to give it a good kick. \\n\\nXIAO LONG BAO - Pretty good. If you've had DTF, then this place definitely doesn't compare. The skin can be a bit thinner. But the meat was juicy and light, and the soup inside was delicious. They also have different varieties, such as crab, loofa, etc. Just stick with the classic. \\n\\nMINCED PORK NOODLE - This was a soup noodle, but the soup was more like a gravy since it had a thicker consistency. It was slight spicy and slightly sweet, but the flavors seemed to somehow meld together really well. And I loved the noodles they used as it had a nice bouncy texture. \\n\\nRED BEAN PANCAKE - They made us order dessert while we ordered all our food. So the pancake came out before we were even done with our meal. And by the time we got to eating it, it cooled down already. This is a dish that has to be eaten fresh and pipping hot. So the pancake was a bit thick and not very good to begin with, and add it with a cooled down version and you get a not so good dessert. \\n\\nService: It was not great, hence minus 1 star. The girl we took our order seemed to either not understand English or Chinese when we tried ordering with her, or just had a hearing problem. Either situation makes her not suitable to be the one in charge of taking orders. We ended up pointing to everything on the menu for her. \\n\\nParking: Street metered parking. Read parking signs carefully!"},{"name":"Little Minh's","address":"7533 Market Crossing","city":"Burnaby","stars":"4.5","text":"The 3-star rating was mainly for their service and environment, perhaps some of their plating. This location used to be a Japanese restaurant. I went a couple of days ago for lunch with expectations based on the previous Yelp reviews, yet I was disappointed with the food.\\n\\nBoth of my thick vermicelli in soup (Bun Bo Hue) and my friend's grilled chicken and grilled pork on rice were below par in terms of taste, portion and quality for the price they charge. My vermicelli tasted fine in the beginning. Then I noticed the meat portion was less than usual. I could only find 1 handmade meat ball in the bowl, whereas the menu listed \\"balls\\". Was it a typo? The spiciness was mild as explained by the waitress, which was fine. To me, it was very mild. If you like spicy food, this is nowhere near spicy. When my friend got his rice, he liked the chicken and the pork. But the first thing he complained about was how hard his rice was. When we ordered, the waitress explained that his dish is made to order (15-20 minutes) to ensure freshness. However, they probably didn't put enough water when they cook the rice. However they cooked it, maybe the ones around the edge of the pot was hard. My friend only finished half of the rice. When the bowl of soup for his rice arrived, the first thing I noticed was the thick rim of oil floating on the soup around the bowl. My friend had a couple of spoonful and left it alone. When my friend mentioned about his rice to the waitress, she apologized and said she will mention it to the chef and nothing was done.\\n\\nI finished my bowl of vermicelli and didn't know what was about to happen: thirst! Within half an hour of finishing my meal, I felt super thirsty that I had to keep drinking water. After 2 glasses down, my mouth was still dry. The thirsty feeling didn't go away. The effect was profound and lasted until late evening. I can now understanding one of the previous Yelp reviewers mentioning about this effect. My friend felt thirsty afterwards also.\\n\\nWhen you want to pay the bill, I suggest that you request sooner unless you don't mind the wait.

So, we eventually flagged down a server and got some waters after sitting for 20 minutes. We had each decided to make our own flights with the smaller pour size. The waitress wasn't very helpful in answering questions about the different beers, so that was unfortunate. When the waitress finally came back with the beers, she realized they were organized incorrectly. She sorted them out and realized that one of the beers was wrong. She gave us the beer free of charge and made sure we got the beer we had originally ordered. I was impressed that she was able to distinguish the different beers solely based on color. \\n\\nFoodwise, we decided to try the tater tots and the pretzel and cheese.

I have no issues with cartilage or bones as long as they're part of the dish (i.e. whole fish, bone-in steaks, etc.), but for bite-sized tacos, the expectation shouldn't be having to pick out tough chunks from your teeth.

I've never - NEVER - been yelled at by a restaurant owner before (barkeeps, yes; restauranteurs, no.) No wonder Carroll's looks like it's going out of business. But let me step back and give you a summary:\\n\\nWednesday night. A few folks at the bar but only two other parties in the (rather large) dining room. Upon Yelp's suggestions, my wife ordered steak tips. I ordered one of the specials - steak a la Carroll.\\n\\nFirst weirdness. No steak a la Carroll. \\"The chef says we just ran out.\\" I survey the room. The two elderly ladies look to be well into their mac and cheese. I can't see what the other two folks are eating. It is 6 p.m. \\"You had just one? I thought it was a special...\\" \\"I don't know,\\" replied the server, \\"but we're out.\\" No problem. Stuff happens. I switched to chicken and pork tips. \\n\\n(Note: The food was tasty, although kinda standard. My wife says the garlic smashed potatoes were well smashed and garlicky; my tips had a nice grilled flavor. We were quite excited by the voluminous pitcher of sangria but, although it too was tasty, we wondered later whether it contained even two glasses of wine.)\\n\\nThe server was pleasant and efficient: the following was not her fault.\\n\\nGiven that I was unable to order the more expensive special, and given that my wife and I are not... persons of size, the meal and sangria fully satisfied us. Unfortunately, the Groupon had a $60 food value, and we only consumed $37 worth. What the heck, we know some hungry children, so we ordered three cheesecakes and asked for a to-go box. \\"I'm sorry,\\" said the waitress, \\"we don't do takeout.\\" \\"Um, yeah, well, this isn't really takeout; this is like ordering more food than we can eat and getting a doggy bag.\\" \\"Okay, I'll check.\\" And off she went.\\n\\nThen, out of the blue: Maury appeared. Maury is the manager (and, I found out later, the owner -- Mr. Carroll himself). \\"We don't do takout.\\" I again asked whether they do doggy bags, and asked the difference. Maury picked up my Groupon, slammed it to the table and yelled (yelled!) \\"Read the fine print!\\" 'Dine-in only!'\\" I was aghast. I looked around his empty restaurant. The waitress asked \\"do you want to save it [the Groupon] for another time?\\" \\"No,\\" I replied, \\"we won't be coming back.\\" I stated to Maury that I'd have to write this up in my Yelp review. \\"Go ahead,\\" he gruffed, then muttered something angry but unintelligible. (Maybe that's where the wine from our sangria went?).\\n\\nIn any case: despite the tasty food, we indeed won't return. Out of advertised specials at 6 pm.? *Yelling* at one of the three parties paying for your \\"hospitality?\\" Outrage at the very dining program that brought you a potential new customer? As my wife said, \\"the place had a weird vibe from the start.\\" Now we know why."},{"name":"El Portal","address":"6999 E Main St","city":"Reynoldsburg","stars":"3.5","text":"El Portal is average Americanized Mexican food.

Every time I search for Indian restaurants on Yelp I stumble upon amazing looking restaurants created by Mr. Vikram Vij himself. Vij's Restaurant is located at 3106 Cambie Street in Vancouver, British Columbia. I'm not 100% sure if they offer parking so I just ended up parking along Cambie Street.\\n\\nI did some research on Vij's prior to my visit, I learned that the restaurant fills up extremely fast. I also heard that people start lining up outside an hour before they open so I was a little nervous about being able to get a table. When I entered Vij's Restaurant right off the bat I noticed their large lounge area for people on the waitlist. I also saw staff giving out tasty looking little appetizers to the guests patiently waiting. A few moments later I was greeted by a pleasant hostess that took me right upstairs to a little two seater in the dining area. I really lucked out apparently because the other groups in the waiting area needed larger tables. I couldn't believe I walked right in and sat down with no wait time, did I mention it was 9pm on a busy Friday night?! Well it was.\\n\\nOnce seated I ordered a Phillips Ginger Ale and some appetizers. For the foods I started out with the Grilled Vegetables in a Mung Bean Curry, holy moly these were SO-SO-SO tasty, I could eat a whole bucket of these veggies! I also ordered the Lamb & Beef Samosas saut√©ed in fennel and sumac, these bad boys were next level, I absolutely LOVED them. I also ordered two main dishes, first up the Grilled Chicken Breast in a Yogurt-Coconut-Curry on Lentil Pat√© with Roasted Sunflower Seeds, I honestly couldn't believe the flavours, my taste buds were in heaven. Knowing that I was going to review Vij's Restaurant I couldn't leave without trying his famous Wine Marinated Lamb Popsicles served in a Fenugreek Cream Curry on Turmeric Spinach Potatoes... I really don't even know what to say about them. They were TOO good. Don't order them, you won't like them. I WANT THEM ALL TO MYSELF! Insert *evil laugh* here. Oh and I should also add that everything came with Basmati Rice and extremely fresh Naan bread. To top it all off I ordered the Gulab Jamun, it was very small but super sweet and delicious, it was the perfect cherry on top to a spectacular evening.\\n\\nIn conclusion I loved every single aspect of Vij's Restaurant. Do NOT go to Vij's if you're expecting the typical cheap butter chicken and some rice. Come here with friends and family! Come here on special occasions. Vij's Restaurant is on the more pricey side of the Indian food spectrum but it's TOTALLY worth it. All the food is prepared fresh by an extremely talented kitchen staff. The wait staff I experienced were all SO nice and helpful when it came to any questions I had about the menu. Vij's really is a whole experience.

Did you know Vancouver is known for having the best Indian cuisine in all of Canada?\\"\\n\\n\\"What...?\\" *interest level rising*\\n\\n\\"Oh yes. And Vij's is known as being the best Indian restaurant in all of Canada.\\"\\n\\n\\"Reeeeealllly?\\" *interesting level skyrocketing*\\n\\n\\"Yup! What really sets them apart is their infusion of French techniques and refinement that really takes things up a notch!\\"\\n\\n\\"Ah...hmm.\\" *interest level plummets*\\n\\nWhenever I go to indian restaurants that try to do the whole \\"refined indian cuisine\\" thing - it's usually code for, \\"remove everything that makes Indian food Indian and make it palatable for people whose mouths burn at the touch of anything hotter than ketchup.\\" I immediately started having visions of Rasika dancing in my head. \\n\\nThat is an Indian restaurant in Washington, DC that also received all sorts of accolades for just how un-Indian it was. I tried it and was just filled with sadness over how so many of the amazing, pungent, in-your-face flavors of Indian cuisine were cruelly removed. Would this simply be a Pacific Northwest version of...\\n\\n\\"He has a kitchen full of Indian grandmas who make all the food.\\"\\n\\n\\"OK Sold!\\"\\n\\nNobody says \\"no\\" to Indian grandmas making your food. \\nExcept when, evidently, they all went to French cooking school. \\nAnd so it was, my worst fears were realized upon the first bite of the first of three dishes I ordered - the chickpea with kale in date masala. \\n\\nThis is Rasika West. \\n\\nThe chickpea dish was Indian-influenced, but there is a certain richness to proper, old school Indian cuisine that was missing. Instead, it was light and airy and exactly the sort of thing someone who normally hates Indian food would enjoy. \\"Oh, it's so refined!\\" they would say with a big smile. \\n\\nI know. That's the problem. \\n\\nIt continued with the second and third course - the braised short rib and the wine marinated lamb popsicles. The short rib was tender enough, and easily cut with just the fork, but there was very little that really felt Indian in the flavors. The curry was more what I would expect in an Irish pub than an Indian restaurant. It was utterly decapitated of any soul. It's like taking BBQ ribs and \\"reimagining it\\" by using tea smoked duck confit. \\nNever tea smoke duck confit and call them BBQ ribs. Seriously. Just don't. \\n\\nThe same problem affected the lamb. It arrived colorful and saucy and glorious...and none of any of those flavors came through in any of the bites. I ate about half of each of the dishes before my mouth just gave up and said, \\"this isn't for you. Maybe bring your mom here one day. She always complains about Indian food being too spicy.\\"\\n\\nOn the bright side - it was quite possibly the best plain naan I've ever had. So...there's that. \\n\\nI always hate giving poor reviews to popular restaurants, and to be fair, their execution was spot on; beautiful plating, and the service was kind and timely. The two women sitting at the table next to me were having the meal of a lifetime and melted with every bite. Predictably, I heard, \\"this is the only Indian restaurant I can eat at.\\" \\n\\nI think it is important to provide a point of view that might resonate with people who are really hardcore fans of Indian food to let them that know they might not be the target audience for this sort of experience. I wish I could have gone to a more hole-in-the-wall type of Indian place while I was here to see how Vancouver stacks up to the Indian scene in other cities I've visited. Indian, when at its best, is my absolute favorite cuisine.

I have friends that drive 40 minutes a few times a week just to eat here. Can you find better quality hot pot in the Boston area? For sure. There are plenty of places with better broths, better cuts of meats, and are probably cleaner. But honestly for the price you pay, I think HPB is unbeatable. I've spent 60+ dollars for dinner for 2 at other hot pot places and left feeling not completely satisfied but for about 50 bucks for 2 here you'll leave filled to the brim. And the lunch menu is a steal for the price. \\n\\nHonestly the only thing I would really avoid on the menu is the regular cut of lamb because it ends up being a little too fatty and gamey tasting. Other than that, I feel like the joy of a buffet is being able to try everything. Be careful though, the portion sizes per item (for dinner at least) is pretty big and every time I plan on doing multiple rounds I end up not being able to get past the first. Service is always a little lacking, don't expect any refills of water if it's busy at all. Recently I went and wanted something cool and sweet after all the meat in hot spicy broth and ordered a iced red milk tea and surprisingly it was really good. I'd never expect HBP to have really fire in house milk tea but they do. \\n\\nIf you've never been, go when you're starving.

It is often busy and is best to have a reservation. \\nFor this particular visit we started with the bacon hush puppies and the pimento cheese biscuits. The hush puppies are only 3 to an order so we doubled down to get 6. If your familiar with my reviews you know I'm a sucker for hush puppies. These were good. I didn't really taste the bacon part, but I won't go as far as to say false advertising, just that the bacon wasn't a big part of the one I ate. \\nThe pimento cheese biscuits were really good. I'll take my review down a couple $$$ and bring up their lower rent contemporary - the Red Lobster cheddar biscuit.  Now The Lob might have started the commercialization of cheese biscuits, but these pimento biscuits are a step above and you get what you pay for with these biscuits. \\nAs I mentioned in my heading, they regularly change their menu to keep it fresh, but they maintain a few staples like the pub burger, their fish taco and steak frites. I've eaten here before and can attest that the pub burger is solid. \\nFor this visit I ordered from the \\"concepts\\" portion of the menu where new items are listed and I got the tuna tomahawk. It is a 10oz tuna steak with a bone in it. It was also cooked with some purple grits, corn, okra and tomatoes. The tuna was seared on the outside and rare in the center. I think mine was closer to medium, but it still tasted good. I have to admit the dish was not exactly what I was expecting because I thought the tuna would come with a decent amount of okra, tomatoes, corn and purple grits, but it was more of an accent/garnish to the tuna. Maybe my taste is not sophisticated enough to understand the \\"concept\\" but I was thinking there would be more than a couple bites of the additional ingredients. \\nI think one of the things that I get hung up on with Ravenous Pig is that I preferred Cask and Larder the sister restaurant to RP. It had a changing menu but contained more Southern comfort food in my opinion (shrimp and grits, Nashville hot chicken). There were ham and biscuits as an appetizer that came with jalape√±o jelly. They were amazing. Now Cask and Larder has been banished to the airport and Ravenous Pig is in the old C&L location. The food is still good and if your looking for a trendy meal then this will be a hit for you and you should try out the \\"concept\\" part of the menu. \\nAlso worth noting, they have a lot of craft beers and their drink menu is solid. Their Old Fashioned is made with Old Forester bourbon and has candied bacon in it. Now that is a concept!\\nEnjoy!\\n*********\\nMy Standardized Yelp Ratings\\n5 stars - This is for a place that I see as one of the best at what they do (steaks, sandwiches, BBQ, seafood, etc). 5s are for places I've been several times (typically) at least and never had an \\"off\\" experience. The food quality, service, price and atmosphere are all going to meet or exceed expectations.\\n \\n4 stars - This is for a place that is good, I would drive a little out of the way to go, and the food and service is good, but maybe not amazing. Also for me, this could also be a great place that serves Pepsi products - automatic 1 star loss - bad management decision. \\n\\n3 stars - This is for a place that I view as standard. Nothing special, nothing lousy, not a place you'd avoid like the plague, but a place that is not one you really look forward to either. \\n\\n2 stars - This is for a place that had something go wrong or something perpetually wrong. The food and or service is likely consistently suspect here (they probably serve Pepsi too).\\n\\n1 star - I can't see wasting time writing a review on a place that gets a 1 star.

We ordered two chicken pastelillos, 3 alcapurrias, one made with yucca and filled with chicken and the other 2 made with guineos (green bananas) and filled with beef. \\nIt was all very good, although I will say my favorite was the chicken filled yucca alcapurria and the chicken pastelillo. The alcapurria was cooked just right, the filling was well seasoned, so tasty. The pastelillo, some people do not fry with the oil and the right temp, rendering it soggy and gross. Not this one, this one was fried perfectly and the filling savory and tasty. The guineo alcapurrias had some kind of sour note on it and greasier then I would like. \\nWe will return for more."},{"name":"Zeytin Turkish Cuisine","address":"4439 Edgewater Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"5","text":"This restaurant is amazing!

He was kind and competent, and we could see him out and about at other tables, but it left us hanging throughout our dining experience.\\n\\nThe food was very good.  I had a garden salad which had lovely greens and was perfectly dressed and added a piece of salmon.  At $10 for a smallish not very complicated garden salad and $12 for a piece of salmon, the prices seemed steep for this, but here one expects to pay for the ambience.\\n\\nThe ambience was amazing.  The historical South Austin home surrounded by stately oaks and a vast yard populated with peahens and peacocks is just the kind of dreamscape meant for Sunday brunch.

There was one girl working behind the counter, who said \\"What do you want\\" as if she was annoyed to see customers. Having never been there before I said \\"Um... I want to do the make your own pizza thing.\\" I picked my crust and then she awkwardly stared at me so I just started naming stuff. Although they list dozens of ingredients (including many different cheeses) she just threw on some provolone and didn't allow me to ask for any other kind of cheese (I also didn't see any in the bin). The ingredients were haphazardly thrown on and they looked about as fresh as the vegetables at Subway. \\n\\nWe finished, paid, and went to have a seat while we waited for our pizzas. Seeing they were out of the oven, we walked to the counter. She squirted something on my friend's pizza (she had gotten one of their signature pizzas), gave us a dumb look and said \\"That's it\\". I said \\"Oh, I didn't know if you brought them to the table.\\" and she said no before thrusting them towards us. In other words, customer service is pretty terrible and the entire ordering process was awkward and uncomfortable. I will not return for that reason alone. \\n\\nAs far as taste goes, they clearly aren't instructed on how to make a pizza. My pizza had at least a cup of sauce and 3-4 big clumps of caramelized onions (with at least 6 onions in each little ball). The spinach wasn't fresh and neither were the mushrooms.

I normally don't like just popping into places without doing a little research, but today, my seven year old daughter was crying of hunger after shopping at Michael's in Porter Square.   \\n\\nI ordered a large cheese pizza hoping to save extra slices for future meals.  While the cheese and sauce on our pizza seemed okay, the crust was below average.  They really skimp on the quality of the crust.  It's very thin, hard, and over cooked.  Most of the bottom of the pizza was charred.  I normally will not eat charred foods because they cause gastrointestinal issues for me.  I ate my first slice but for the next two slices, I only ate the cheese and sauce.  I was super hungry, and I only let my daughter finish her slices as she was famished as well.  However, I showed her the bottom of the pizza and told her that this is not good pizza.  \\n\\nAlso, what really annoyed me was the price point.  That burnt pizza costed $11.95!  I felt so ripped off but have to think it's because of the location that allows them to charge that much. For that price point, I can get two very nice cheese pizzas in my neighborhood.  Another thing that bothered me was just how dirty their plastic utensils were.  They don't clean the area where they store the utensils.  I grabbed the last knife and there was dots of dust (?) on the knife.  I wiped it clean with my fingers.

Do NOT get the spicy chicken dinner entree, it was sweet and oddly flavored--it made no sense at all. Bulgogi dinner entrees were so small in portion size. The seafood ramen was plain with over cooked noodles, and the Korean rice cake dish (tteokbokki) was so bland with NO texture. It's almost as if someone took this stuff out the freezer and just microwaved it. \\n\\nThis restaurant's only saving grace was the salmon ball, and couple of the makis which were generous in size. Everything else was just so disappointing."},{"name":"Santorini Cafe","address":"11800 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Gyros were delicious.

Thankfully, I prepared ahead of time and had a really good first experience there for my birthday.\\n\\nAfter seeing this big, shiny place with its games and sounds during a movie date to the AMC upstairs, I decided I had to come back here one weekend with a group. Ended up getting a Summer Fun Pass ($16-$19 depending on day/time, plus tax, and I believe plus shoe rental if you're bowling), which lets you have unlimited bowling, laser tag, billiards, and gravity ropes. \\"Unlimited\\" sounds good, but you have to keep in mind how many realistic sessions you're going to get in. Who really bowls for more than 1-2 hours? And the wait times (more later) will prevent you from getting back to back to back sessions of anything.\\n\\nBowling: Having heard of the dreadful wait times, I showed up an hour early to reserve a bowling lane. This was around 6:30pm on a Sunday. It was still quite busy overall, but not packed like Saturday night. I was able to reserve a lane without any problem after buying a summer pass for myself. And sure enough, an hour later, I got my lane easily. Their system works by reserving lanes by 1-hour blocks. If your party wants to add on another hour, let them know as early as you can. There's a convenient timer on your bowling monitor letting you know how much time is left. Speaking of monitors, I was impressed with the technology. Sure we've all done the giving yourself nicknames, but now you can add photos by each bowler? I'll take it. The lanes, the seating area, and the bowling balls were clean. I was impressed with the variety of sizes of balls, as well as the additional option for finger hole size. \\n\\nLaser Tag: Reservations for this was a little more complicated. They would not allow me to reserve a block ahead of time unless all members of my party were present. So we came back here after everyone was done bowling, and had to wait 30 minutes for the first available slot. I believe each game is separated into 15-minute blocks. The actual game is about 10 mins, and you get a few minutes before and after for instruction and leaving the play area. As for the playing itself, it was very fun! The guns seem pretty accurate, make cool sounds when you fire and when you get hit. You work up a good sweat after running around and going between the two levels. It can be a bit chaotic because you walk in there and will be randomly assigned a color (red v. blue) once the game starts. You can't really pick teams. I should also add that they will fill each 15-minute block with as many people as they can, so you'll definitely end up playing with strangers. We were lucky enough to only wait 15 minutes for a second game, but this will depend on the time you visit and how busy it is.\\n\\nGravity Ropes: Nope. Never got to enjoy this because there was hour plus wait for it. I suppose part of it is because there's a lot of set up required for each person's harness. \\n\\nBilliards: Well, if you wait long enough, you can find an open table. According to their website, it's free to play during happy hours (basically NOT from 7pm-10pm everyday, and NOT available on Fridays and Saturdays, period). There's also one shuffleboard table that was mostly open as well. It was fun and chill way to pass the time waiting. \\n\\nGames: Nope, didn't get to enjoy these either. The fun pass doesn't include any money to play arcade games. You have to buy a separate pass for that. There was a good assortment of racing, shooter, and other games. But I wouldn't say they had as much a variety as Dave & Buster's. No old school type arcade games either. \\n\\nFood: There's a few seating options. 1) The bar is nice and clean, TVs readily available if you want to watch anything. I personally feel it's a bit too loud to enjoy a sporting event, too much distraction going on around you. My girlfriend ordered a sandwich, but it didn't look that impressive. Just like it was microwaved, and the chips that came with it had zero crunch. I'm not expecting much here, but give us -something- for an entree! 2) There's also a general seating area, with waiter service I believe. 3) Finally, there's a corner area for La Bella's Pizza, which is more of a grab and go deal. Sadly, I still had to wait 10 minutes for a pizza slice because it was all sold out at the time. Pizza was solid, and not bad for $4. I would suggest possibly coming down here for a quick bite if you want to avoid overpriced food at the theater upstairs. \\n\\nAll in all, there's potential for fun here, but you have to either plan, get lucky, or both. I think the fun pass needs to have at least a few dollars of games included in the package to be worth the value. The crowding and wait times can also be nuts if you come at peak hours, so it's not going to feel like a special experience at all when you have teenagers cutting up a few few away from you, and you can't hear think."},{"name":"Rimsky-Korsakoffee House","address":"707 SE 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been here once and it has it's quirky Portland charm.

For the first two months after opening, they would sell out of almost any dessert worth ordering (matcha and hojicha parfaits; most cakes) within the FIRST THREE HOURS of opening. A short while ago, an updated policy was implemented that now only allows only dine-in customers with reservations to order parfaits. While this guarantees that popular items are available throughout the day for customers with reservations, it continues to leave dozens of patrons who made the effort to line up before opening frustrated and disappointed. Its website is always under construction, they NEVER answer the phone, and if you're thinking of making reservations to finally get your hands on some parfait, enjoy your three-week wait (it's probably gotten even longer by now).\\n\\nThese Uncle Tetsu-like strategies (spend all your money on marketing, then make so-so products in limited quantities to dummies who buy into the hype) are either of incredible incompetence or incredible genius.

Here's what you've gotta know:\\n\\nFirst, they only have specials on food and none on drinks. But really, that's ok with me as rarely are happy hour drink specials things I actually want to drink. I'll just order one of their many margaritas ($9-$13 or so), and take advantage of their food deals.\\n\\nSecond, their food specials are truly special. As in they're full-sized menu options, not smaller sizes for smaller prices. We learned this the hard way when we ordered 3 apps and it was pretty much all the food we needed for dinner.\\n\\n- The guacamole is only $6, and it's a HUGE portion, plus it comes with pico and salsa verde. I think it needed a significant addition of salt, but hey there's salt right there on the table.\\n\\n- The habanero shrimp were also $6. They were pretty lame. I wouldn't get them again.\\n\\n- The brussels sprouts were $5, and they were AWESOME. Perfectly cooked and full of flavor. Not too sure why a Mexican restaurant is selling brussels sprouts, but I don't care. They were delicious.\\n\\nWe SHOULD have stopped there (and at 2 margaritas each), but we didn't. I saw duck fajitas on their seasonal menu and had to give them a try. They were... ok. I think I would have liked them more if I wasn't already so full, but they were fine. The duck was cooked wonderfully, but I think all of the fajita fixins kinda masked the delicious duck flavor. I ended up just eating the duck on it's own and having the rest as a sort of Mexican food mash.\\n\\nUsually when I want Mexican food I just want to go up to a cart and get some quick tacos, but if I want to do a nice sit down Mexican food experience, I'm happy to come to Matador.

The chow mein was very good and pleasantly tomato-y tasting, and the egg foo yung was OK but probably left sitting on the grill just a bit too long.  However, the fried shrimp was EXTRAORDINARY!  Seems like most other Chinese restaurants make fried shrimp with a coating that is way too hard and crunchy, like biting into a hard taco shell.  But, at Eastern Cathay, the fried shrimp has a softer, lighter coating that is almost \\"fluffy\\".  Our waitress said they use eggs in their batter and that's the difference.  Also, it's not greasy at all.  On top of that, they use jumbo sized shrimp and butterfly cut them so that they are really big, with more \\"surface area\\" for that great fluffy coating.

After several awkward minutes of two hostesses checking and rechecking their system for our table of 4, they needed to manually add our information into the system before being brought to our table in a 1/3 filled restaurant.  What was more disheartening was the phone call 30 mins later in the middle of our dinner from the hostess asking if we would be coming to the restaurant for our 7PM reservation.  Apparently our reservation and contact information was in their system; but, they didn't know how to properly access it until it notified them that we had not checked in.  Oh well...onto the meal.\\n\\nAfter starting with some wine as we caught up socially and reviewed the menus.  I was caught off guard that the on-line menu for the Seaport location had Tonno (lemon pepper crusted tuna) listed that I was personally looking forward to ordering; but, the in restaurant menu didn't.  I even checked today (3 days later) as I write this review and see that the on-line version still doesn't match.  Instead I ordered the Salamone all Griglia (salmon) as did another in our party while the Halibut (another option not listed on line) and sea bass special were also ordered.  Our waiter was helpful in recommending wine by the glass to accompany the entrees ordered which was very nice. He also noted a food allergy (shellfish) which was much appreciated. \\n\\nThe food was served fresh and came out warm which is sometimes challenging with fish entrees; but Tuscan Kitchen did a fine job.  The sides were also warm although it was noted that the asparagus had the largest diameter than typical which made them a little tougher.  The caprese salad was enjoyed by the table with large portions of fresh mozzarella and tomato. We passed on dessert; but opted for coffees to wrap up our conversations before parting ways.  Overall the food was good with portions that were just right; just not spectacular in presentation or taste.  \\n\\nSimilarly service was good; but not amazing.  Usually in restaurants of this type with such steep competition within the Seaport district, service is expected to be stellar to support entree prices exceeding $30.  You don't expect the food being brought to the table with the ask of \\"who had the salmon?\\" As if we were at Applebees.  Did I mention the restaurant was 1/3 full?  It should be easy for the staff to denote by table and chair number who ordered what. In my opinion, those are the little things that matter and make you stand out amount the stiff restaurant competition particularly when you food is average at best.  \\n\\nTuscan Kitchen has been around in other locations for years and this location has been open for more than 6 months.  Therefore there is no excuse for the faulty handling of a reservation or the servers being less prepared than comparable destinations in the Seaport.  The food and quality is good enough to be successful; and more training and attention to detail should get this place back on track to be a recommended future destination."},{"name":"Cold Beer","address":"670 Dekalb Ave NE, Ste 101","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"We went last weekend and were excited to try it but our excitement quickly changed to disappointment.

Not worth making a special trip just for some oysters & mussels. The dudebro waiters have clearly been instructed to flirt with the validation-hungry Kits clientele, so ladies, expect lots of little shoulder-squeezes & winks. Wow, super. Nothing like establishment-mandated desperation wafting around the dining room to accompany the smell of seafood. I'm as happy as the next rational person to not see teenage girls in stupid schoolgirl kilts demeaning themselves for tips in this town, but you know what would be nice? Efficient, friendly, informative, professional service. I don't care if you're attractive. I didn't come to a restaurant to be flirted with. If you have to force your waitstaff to flirt with customers, you're hiding your establishment's other failings. It's obvious. And it's depressing.\\n\\nAgain, food was fine, ambience was bizarre. Horrible canvas mounted triptych photos of New Orleans (direct from allposters.com) on the walls cheapened the atmosphere. The \\"dining room\\" area (up a few stairs) feels quite cramped & is loud as all-get-out. My friends & I had to scream across the table at one another. I was able to hear the shouted conversation of the group of people sitting next to us just fine. Awesome! Just was I was looking forward to!\\n\\nSeriously? You serve seafood. The dining room area looks like The Keg. Turn the music down. It won't kill you. No one is going to think, \\"Wow, this place is so uncool because they aren't playing their music at ear-bleeding volume! Let's get out of here!\\"\\n\\nAnother great reason to turn the music down is because the waiters can't hear the customers. It means that they have to lean in super-close to your face when you order from them, which is unwelcome. I don't want to smell my waiter's breath, & I'm sure he doesn't want to smell mine.\\n\\nSpeaking of service, it was bizarre apart from even the weird flirting. One of our waiters spilled some of our bottle of wine as he was squeezing in to serve our food. Not a problem, accidents happen, but there were at least 3 glasses of wine left in that bottle, as the waiter should've been well aware since it spilled all over him. Some spilt on the party next to us as well. So we all got apologies, but no one bothered to bring us more wine. And nothing was offered to the damp, stained members of the party next to us. We eventually had to flag down the waiter & tell him that there was quite of bit of wine left in the bottle, to which he replied, \\"There was?\\" Bro, you got soaked in it. It's all over the floor next to our table, & on the people beside us. Yeah, there was wine in there.\\n\\nWe eventually got a tumbler of wine each and the people next to us got nothing (however, they didn't say anything), but there didn't seem to be any protocol for what happens when a member of staff has an accident like that. You bring a half-litre bottle to our table, offer a drink to the people who got wet, & offer to pay their dry cleaning bill. I know it's chaos in there, but man, a big mess happened. Deal with it.\\n\\nAnother odd aspect of service. Closer to the end of our dinner, I ordered a bottle of beer from a waiter (not the same guy who had spilled the wine). Off he goes, & I wait & wait. Okay, he forgot. I flag down another waiter & explain that I'd ordered a beer a while ago. He tells me he'll see to it. When he returns with my beer, he shouts in my ear that the last waiter thought that I'd offered to buy HIM a beer.\\n\\nOkay, see - this is what happens when you combine flirty waiters with extremely loud music. I'm in a food & drink establishment. Which is more likely to occur: I order a beer for myself or I offer to buy a beer for a server? Common sense would say to double-check (\\"sorry, did you just say that you wanted to buy me a beer? It's hard to hear over the music!\\"), but hey, since everyone's flirting as hard as they can, why not just assume that I'm flirting back? \\n\\nMaybe that's just a jokey line they've been told to feed customers if someone forgets part of your order, but it was said absolutely po-faced, and it was strange.\\n\\nAny way, to sum up, a strange experience all around. I don't know if I'm willing to make enough concessions to return: the insufferable Kits crowd, the annoying flirty waiters, the embarrassing dining room, the inevitable deafness which follows. For food that was just pretty good, it hardly seems worth it."},{"name":"Granny's Tacos","address":"1401 E 7th St","city":"Austin","stars":"5","text":"Seriously the best breakfast tacos I've ever eaten!

I have taken pleasure in it over the years, since I owned a house around the corner - during a time most of you would never have come to Alberta Street.\\n\\nThe Tin Shed is a former BBQ, rescued by Roslyn Hill, who has now renovated, decorated, menu-planned, staffed and landscaped several business sites in Northeast.  Ros has added charm and livability beyond northeast by demonstrated it is possible to add value to a building and area by not taking renovations out of scale.  Historic neighborhoods can especially benefit from this approach.  Thanx Roslyn!\\n\\nThe existing biz is now open for B, L & D, and now late night music and drinks...also sometimes a Farmers Market uses the site, so remain in touch- to see how the Tin Shed and the many new _Friends of Alberta Street_ might also add value to your life.\\n\\nRoslyn's Garden Cafe/Gallery was the first welcoming garden on Alberta. It is now the Tin Shed  - and was where a group of fellow investor activists met for a series of meetings, calling ourselves Friends of Alberta Street.  There we discussed how we could involve neighbors and help make the area more inviting and livable.  Many friends didn't even want to come to King neighborhood, but we didn't give in.  As we painted and renovated, we challenged people's fears as discriminatory, and some of us also confronted the Media to change their stereotypical, broad-brush reporting about _N/NE_ Portland.\\n\\nIn addition to pushing a Community Congress, renovating properties, re-framing the message for the Press, and urging other investor friends to see the possibilities,  I think each of us tackled a list of things that others never knew about. We were more free to do so after we handed off leadership for Volunteer Organizing around Community Goals to the emerging Albina CDC (Community Development Corporation) on Alberta Street. \\n\\nI was delighted to hear a national radio story cite about 6 contributions on my personal Alberta project list, years later, when I was renovating a room in a Row-house I'd bought near Howard University in DC.  It is true - individuals can make a difference. Working with others so often makes it go much further, so look around to see who else cares before you dive in.  Alberta Street always had a deep core of committed activists living there, we just focused community ideals (and some personal investment) on livability for a while, and it REALLY worked.\\n\\nAren't you glad it all happened?  And from very humble beginnings.  Let's have lunch in Roslyn's Garden to celebrate!"},{"name":"Random Order Pie Bar","address":"1800 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"it's less pretentious than Barista ...

There were a couple of issues however. I ordered my grouper blackened. When it came out to me it appeared to be grilled or broiled. Upon questioning this server she said it looks like it's a lightly blackened but could be baked.  I indicated that I wasn't entirely happy, (I can assure you it wasn't blackened), with it but she did not offer to take an exchange. I did tell her that I wasn't a fan of the sauce that it was sitting in as it was sweet and did not complement the fish. She did apologize and offered to bring me a side dish  which I took her up on and ordered asparagus.  I was extremely surprised to see that we were charged for the asparagus despite my dissatisfaction with the way the fish was cooked in the way the sauce tasted.  At the very least I would've expected a manager to come over just to say hello to make sure everything was OK.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, our server was perfectly pleasant but did not understand the customer service part of completing the entire experience to make it exceptional.  Considering I had to remove the fish from the sauce it it was sitting in and eat it on a separate plate without having anything else to go with it, at the very least I thought the asparagus would've been complementary. We did not say anything, we paid the bill, and left with one of us be disappointed.\\n\\nNow for the good part. The appetizer we had was fantastic which consisted of mussels and clams.  My husband had a steak which was perfectly cooked and which he thoroughly enjoyed and was a member of the clean plate club.  Because I checked in on Yelp we received a free dessert and we took advantage of that by ordering the Bananas Foster. It is created for you table-side which is quite a pleasurable experience as is eating it.  \\n\\nIf you ask my husband he would completely recommend this place 100%. However, since it's me completing the survey I can honestly say based on my experience I cannot fully recommend.

I simply could not find enough positive things about this hotel to give it a higher rating. It's a very nice facility, the lobby and common areas are maintained well, there was a beautiful Christmas tree set up during the holidays. The staff is very friendly, the valet attendants were beyond polite and fast, and I do hope you have the pleasure of meeting Trevor from room service!  He was one of the friendliest people I've met, and he went above and beyond for us for breakfast on our last day, truly a gem. I would recommend staying away from the diner and room service, however, the food is less than mediocre and at that price I think that's unacceptable. Stick to the restaurants on the strip, or even the place downstairs to the left of registration. Be sure to try their breakfast buffet, at $25 a head it is well worth it and almost what you'd pay for undesirable food from room service.  I was a little disappointed with the maid we had on one particular day. Upon returning to the room I noticed all that was done was the beds made, trash emptied, and new towels left. Vacuuming was not done, nor was anything wiped down. Someone must have dropped some coffee on the desk and the ring was still there after the maid had left.  I would also appreciate a knock before entering the room. Also, parking fees are outrageous!  For what the nightly cost is, the resort fee, and the cost of food, you'd think you'd catch a break somewhere.

Whether in the city or suburbs, plenty of places that either specialize in ramen or have menus that include many ramen options exist. They can all blend together, but Yebisuya merits a visit for solid ramen if you find yourself in the area and are interested in sampling an extensive selection of noodle soups. \\n\\nMy fiance and I visited Yebisuya for a recent lunch based on a recommendation from a friend. The ambiance here is bright and open, a welcome change from some of the more popular ramen shops that try to pack as many clientele in as possible in dark quarters. Service ran efficiently and our servers were polite. We happily heard a lot of Japanese in the dining room (both staff and patrons) which may speak to this place's authenticity. Our meal started with the restaurant's takoyaki which emerged scaldingly hot from the kitchen. The octopus balls here are on par with other, local izakayas, i.e. crispy, fluffy, and flavorful. We opted for the the Spicy Tantan and Powerful Tonkotsu pork ramen. The spicy, ground pork topping on the Spicy Tantan complimented the creamy broth well and allowed for a bite of meat in every sip of soup. The Powerful Tonkotsu carried strong notes of garlic in its extra-rich pork broth and had plenty of well-executed accouterments including delicate pork belly and a runny boiled egg. \\n\\nThe broth, noodles, and toppings here may not win awards for the city's best, but the bowls we had were ultimately quite good on the whole. Furthermore, the menu offered plenty of unique, enticing options (e.g. a mixed seafood option with different noodles, a yuzu-soy chicken version) that should appeal to every ramen lover. I thus give Yebisuya a solid four stars for good ramen, a decent atmosphere, and selections for every palette."},{"name":"The One Sushi +","address":"2523 Caldwell Rd NE, Ste 1000","city":"Brookhaven","stars":"4","text":"This was a particularly frustrating experience. \\n\\nYou might notice that I've posted several reviews of this restaurant, as it is close to my house and each time I try something new I want to be sure everybody knows about it! \\n\\nThis particular evening, we decided to swing by around 7pm.

A wonderful space with delicious and unique dishes inspired by Mexican classics.\\n\\nQuality: I was impressed by the modern twists to Mexican cuisine served up by Suerte. Our meal started with cocktails, I went with a Almita Swizzle, with sotol, blueberry lemon oleo, chile pequin, and thai basil, while also having a few sips of Mango No. 5, with mezcal, Texas mango, hoja santa, lime, and egg white. Both tasty and refreshing. For appetizers we had the delightful Shrimp Tostada, which came with a kick, and the tender Lengua Taco. For our mains we had the Quesadilla De Aguacate, was my least favorite dish, I felt it came out too crispy and lacking in cheese. Luckily, the Duck Confit Flautas more than made up for it with moist and delicate meat and a wonderful rich mole sauce.\\nQuantity: The left side of the menu tends to be smaller bites, but the entrees are sharable.\\nValue: $11 to $15 for Brunch Cocktails. $13 for the Shrimp Tostada. $3.50 for a Lengua Taco. $13 for the Quesadilla De Aguacate. $21 for the Duck Confit Flautas. \\nAmbiance: Suerte has a beautiful and bright space just east of Downtown Austin. High ceilings, big windows, and light colors give it a very welcoming feel. The inside area has plenty of tables as well as some bar seating looking directly into the kitchen. They also had a small outdoor patio, but it was far too hot on this afternoon. The music was relaxing and fun, perfect for brunch vibes.\\nCrowd: Fairly busy during brunch.

He said \\"okay sorry.\\" Then walked away. Please fire him, he is obviously not fit to work with a customer facing position. Also the fact that that no food was subsidized speaks to the rating of this establishment. The fact that everyone walks around with handcuffs on the back of their shirt is disturbing enough. The fact that a \\"manager\\" didn't align with the customer who found a beetle the size of a dime in a Caesar salad then blamed the outdoor patio then did not give anything free of charge is incredibly disgusting. I wrote the pants off of this review and yelp salutes me for bending over for Dillion's and respecting a waitress's time and service.

The other coworker changed the cooking surface for us later and proceeded to grab one of our tongs and load up the cooking surface. We sat there awkwardly in silence as she stood over us. This is our food to eat at our own pace, she dumped the rest of our food on the skillet. Paying the bill was a chore too. One staff member was too busy looking in the mirror to notice us flagging him down. When he finally did come with our check, he brought sliced oranges, but instead of taking away a plate to make room, he plopped it on a plate of meat.\\n\\nThe food: God this is the worst part. First off, real Korean BBQs use gas grills and change out the grates. This place uses a hot plate heated by gas I'm sure. But they throw parchment paper on the cooking surface.so it imparts no flame kissed flavor. Has anyone else here fried on top of parchment paper? It blackens and burns. So they change out the paper and pour oil on it. This is cheaper than carrying a box of grates around We ordered 3 different cuts of beef ranging in 3 different colors. See the picture I uploaded. One cut smelled rancid and we couldn't eat it. I can only imagine that their kitchen is not up to code.\\nTheir hot sauce and kimchi even smelled rancid. How do you mess that up?

I am not a fan of this place. \\n\\nThe first time I tried to eat here, was by placing a to-go order. Getting through was difficult, they out me on hold (put the phone down) for 5 minutes before I hung up. I tried calling back for another 30 minutes before they picked up again. Now, I MIGHT understand this if I called during the lunch rush, but it was 2:30 in the afternoon. When I finally spoke with someone, they said they DO takeout orders, but only for dinner. I asked for clarification, that thy didn't want my business now because it was lunch time? The man said yes and hung up. Super rude and I was fuming. \\n\\nFast forward 3 months, I decided to try again. A friend and I went in for lunch and the people there were equally as rude. During the hour and 15 minutes we were there, only 2 other customers came in. Both to shop, not to order food or dine in. I say this because there is no reason why the service was so poor. We had to get up several times to ask for water, plates, utensils, and the check. It was like we were a major inconvenience being there. \\n\\nWe ordered quite a bit of food to try, bc we wanted to try a bunch of things and share.\\nOlivie - potato salad with bologna, eggs, and peas. The best dish of the afternoon.\\nPirozhki (stuffed bun) - I liked the rice and beef more than my friend did\\nKhachapuri (cheese filled bread)  - This was 'meh' to me but my friend didn't like it at all.\\nGolubtsy (stuffed cabbage) - we both agreed that this was the worst stuffed cabbage either of us has had.\\nVarenikj (dumplings) - it was all do, very little filling, and a bit on the slimy side. Neither of us cared for their, either.\\nKarina (5 layer honey cake) - this must have been SUPER old as it was hard, stale, and utterly disgusting. Neither of us could even swallow one bite.\\n\\nNow, the food was mediocre at best, but the service was terrible. \\n\\nAfter we were done eating we walked around the shop to see if there was anything worth buying for home.

It's served on a bed of spring mixed greens, which gives it a really nice touch of freshness as well. \\nThe ebi sunomono salad was your typical ebi sunomono.  Fresh tasting with just the right amount of sweet and vinegar.\\nThe appetizer tempura was delish!  It came out crispy and not drenched in oil.  It was the perfect temperature, so I know that it wasn't sitting on the counter for a while before it came out to me.  The veggies were not over deep-fried.  They still had a nice crunch to them and didn't get all soggy.\\nFinally, the crunch roll.  The crunch roll is basically a dynamite roll with tempura flakes on top (Just like the description says).  The crunch roll is a decent sized roll.  Not too big where you can't eat it in one bite, but not too small where you're wondering where the rest of it is.  \\nAll in all, it was a nice experience, and is definitely go again (Just not between 2-4pm when all the school kids come rushing in bumping you with their back-packs)."},{"name":"Jack's Pizza & Wings","address":"676 Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Let me start of by saying that the food is outstanding!!

Again -- we go out often and are absolutely used to restaurants being busy but a, \\"Hey guys, welcome in! I'll be right with y'all!\\" Would've sufficed.

I'll give you the fact that your pizza is fast, hot and good but not great.  I felt bad that I had to add oregano, pepper flakes and pepper to jazz up the flavor because it just wasn't cutting it.  I suppose if I go back I'll give the \\"Slice Bar\\" a try but from what I saw they didn't look heavily loaded with toppings.  \\n\\nFor a weekend afternoon while school was in session I found the area to be packed.  Parking wasn't too difficult but finding a spot in front of Bill's Pizzeria was very lucky.  If today is like any other weekday around noon you'll more than likely be eating next to loud teenagers saying, \\"Oh My God!,\\" \\"You Have No Idea,\\" or some other annoying phrase.  In addition to young kids you'll encounter mother's toting anywhere between 1 to 3 children at a time.  After leaving Bill's the only question I kept asking myself was, \\"Don't people have jobs to be at?\\""},{"name":"Olive Garden Italian Restaurant","address":"300 West 436","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"We had amazing service with Carla I was able to stay with my keto diet ordering the stuffed chicken marsala and  subbing mashed potatoes with zucchini it was very delicious."},{"name":"Suerte","address":"1800 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"typical new place that the food reviewers go ape over.

We also had spring rolls, which were solid. There were spinach and mushroom dumplings which were tasty, but the skin was a little thick to be considered delicate.\\nFor meat I had the pork/crab xiao long bao, which was tasty, but didn't really have as much soup as I expected/as much as I'm used to.

Yet, it is months between restaurant openings and everywhere is full. Sage, was surprisingly, partially empty on a Friday night. That's a dangerous time to be empty in an expensive area, like Buckhead. Nonetheless, due to its convenience to the W, decided to give it a shot and see what's new.\\n\\nThe place is nice, but inside, with a pretty average design that's neither interesting or unique in this day and age. Tavern inspired and neat. While this was unique a decade ago, nowadays it's just another place with a bland design. Not to say it's a bad design, but a repeat of almost every other restaurant in Buckhead. Sitting down the table, our waitress Joy (maybe Jay) came over and was extremely kind and attentive from start to finish. It was simply spectacular service and one of the best I've had in a long time, I've even taken the time to tell the manager about her.\\n\\nNow for the food...where the disappointing experience happened. The calamari, came out in a huge size, but was basically inedible due to the amount of salt on it. Now, when I say salty, I mean it. It was probably the saltiest fish I've ever eaten, outside of salted dried fish in Russia, which are consumed with serious amounts of beer and can survive the winter without the need for a fridge. For a meal that's not a winter survival dish, this was just terrible. The theme continued with chicken meatballs, which were quite good, if they had not been over salted as well. Not to the degree of calamari and somewhat edible, but still extremely salty. Our kind waitress asked the cooks if they could make it less salty, but the sauce is already pre-made and they said no.\\n\\nSo, to be blunt, the food here is hardly edible. It's not a matter of preference, I've eaten salty food before, but never like this. Salt is such a pathetic way to ruin a meal and something that patrons can easily add based on preferences, but impossible to take away. Thus, amazing service and unbearably salty food. I wish the establishment to improve drastically on the food front, as lasting in this highly competitive area will not be easy."},{"name":"Yebisuya","address":"6035 Peachtree Rd, Ste A-105","city":"Doraville","stars":"3.5","text":"Got the powerful tonkotsu ramen, and it was amazing.

I visit several places and realize I have not reviewed them. I plan to review every place I visit at least once from here on out. I live in the area and in the past I would be here several times a month on a weekend. It is very lively and energetic. You get the party feel without having to go to stinky bar. At any rate, I am reviewing every establishment I visit. Unfortunately, this was not a good experience. Management did come to correct the problem, but the servers behavior was unacceptable.\\n\\nWe arrived and we were seated promptly at a table in the bar area at our request. We were coming for food, drinks and to watch the game. Shay was our server she came over and appeared to be a nice young lady. There was water on the table and I asked her if we could get it wiped off. I did not have napkins and could not put down my purse or phone. I did not think this was an unusual, rude or mean request. I was not rude or mean. At any rate she said she would let the hostess know and walked away. I guess she told them, but then she never came back. It was something she could have easily done with a napkin. It was as if I had insulted her for asking to just have the water wiped off the table. I am still confused. Me and friend were like ummmm it was not that serious. The DJ for the evening who was awesome needed us to be moved to another table. We saw her tell the server \\"Shay\\" and she said tell the host. At any rate we moved and were supposed to be getting a new server since we were no longer in Shay's area and we were happy about that. It did not seem like she wanted to serve us. I believe in tipping 20% or more and I planned to drink and have fun. I want to give the money I work hard for to someone else who is working hard not to someone who acts as if wanting water off of a table is a crime. We wanted the new server.  \\n\\nThe new server was a young man who the DJ raved about. However, he was mad he was given another table and does not want to be our server. He said it would be a while and we were fine with that. When he finally got to us. It was if we were a burden. We even told him jokingly like dang we feel like we are burden for just trying to spend money basically. He did not apologize or anything. I mentioned I had to review them. He took our order and we never saw him again. For time reference we arrived before the game started it is now halftime and we did not even have water or a drink. \\n\\nThe manager came over and spoke with us and he sent a new server who was awesome. He bought our first round. Random people seating at the bar were now coming up to us like y'all don't have anything. The bar manager was off and was enjoying a meal and over heard and also bought us a round. This is appreciated. Cierra (I hope the spelling is correct)  she was awesome. She was not a server in the bar area so she had to come check on us. We were extremely patient. The previous two servers need to undergo training. They appear to be rather young. I love to see young people working and trying. I worked in customer service and retail when I was younger and I know it is hard. I would not want anything bad for them, but they need to be trained on how to appropriately handle situations. Shay seemed to be fine with her other guest, but it was like when I asked for water to be wiped off she automatically hated us. My friend and I look younger than we are. We are in our late thirties. Maybe she presumed we were some young chicks who she was not going to benefit from. Maybe she thought we were bougie because we wanted the excessive water on the table wiped off. I am really confused by her response to a simple request. \\n\\nAt any rate if you want to listen to good music and be in a fun & lively environment then this Friday's is the place to visit. As far as food it is Friday's not a five star restaurant. It is ok. I got the grilled wings. I try to watch my calories and most of Friday's meals are well over 1,000 calories. I have eaten many meals at Friday's, as most people have. There is parking in camp creek. Don't visit with high expectations for service. I am giving them three stars due to management and Cierra intervening. I will return at some point considering I live in the area, but it will not be anytime soon. I remember being happy this Friday's was opening. I can not give this establishment my money. I really wanted this to be a good review, as I feel people only review restaurants like Friday's when they have bad experiences."},{"name":"The Pizza Press","address":"6079 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Celebration","stars":"4.5","text":"Pizza Press is wonderful.

Add in my deep appreciation for well-designed spaces, and it's clear why I'm a fan of Century Bar.\\n\\nI'll let other people tell you about this place as a sports-watching venue (though with the awesome stadium seating and plethora of TVs I can only assume it's tops), and I'll focus on the patio space and the cocktails. Spoiler alert: both are rad. Summer in Portland is magical, yet there are precious few venues in which to soak up the sun. The multilevel patio at Century Bar might just become my summer HQ. Additionally, their cocktail list is very heavy on tequila and mezcal, which are pretty much perfect for summertime boozing. It's not exactly what I'd call cheap, but for the experience they've created, it's well worth it.\\n\\nOh, and they serve food. Lots of it! I've only had the nachos and the quesadillas, both of which are on the food happy hour menu. Both were not only massive but also delicious. They're not scared of calories here at Century Bar, that's for sure...\\n\\nI hear the evenings and weekend can get super packed, and full of a younger crowd.

Service was pretty good (minus when they poured some of our bottled sparkling water into our tap water glasses). It had been a while since I had a meal at au Comptoir. Previous visits were during lunch and I remembered the food as being very good.\\n\\nWe ordered the foie gras to start. The Apple jelly and pickled apple (that looked like a relish) was a nice touch to the appetizer. My only suggestion would to have an extra piece or two of the brioche toast.\\n\\nThe duck breast was probably one of the best duck breast dishes I have had in a while. So many places do not know how to properly sear the skin where it's perfectly crispy yet the meat is still tender. I totally enjoyed that dish. I would get that dish again. I think this dish was better prepared then my visits to le crocodile (and that's one of my top restaurants in the city!)\\n\\nThe grilled rib eye was so tender and juicy. The frites were cooked well. I didn't have any complaints with that dish. I'd rather spend $38 on this piece of steak versus going to the keg.\\n\\nFinished off the meal by sharing the lemon meringue tart. The filling was good but I was disappointed by the tart shell. It clearly tasted like it had been sitting in the cooler for some time because a great, fresh tart shell would be hard/crisp when you fork into it. It was a bit soft in texture and therefore this dessert was not a winner. \\n\\n\\nOverall I had a great visit. It was pretty busy for a Wednesday evening but luckily we had no issues with walking in. If only they took reservations, I would likely be a regular customer!

I've been here for long stretches of time, both on my laptop and not, both alone and with tables of friends. Some days, I've genuinely been here from 9:30 to 5:30.\\n\\nI've never had any issues with management or the staff; indeed, a couple times, the manager's come over to offer me one of yesterday's pastries. I've never seen yelling before (?), nor have I been hassled in the slightest. I've also been here late in the evening on a slow night, and when I got up to leave, the barista made a point to ask whether I was leaving because I felt pressured--saying that if so, I should definitely feel encouraged to stay until closing.\\n\\nThat said, I buy things every few hours, because this is a business--and, yeah, it's hard running a coffee shop that encourages people to sit and stay without also explicitly setting the expectation that they buy things.\\n\\nSo, as I'm working, I set a timer to remind myself to buy something every few hours. If I'm visiting with friends who aren't interested in eating or drinking things, I'll often buy a little more or tip a little more to compensate--and maybe apologize on their behalf. If I plan on leaving soon, even if I'm not hungry, I'll buy a pastry and take it home with me to eat the next day, because this is ultimately a local business that provides people with their livelihoods, and buying things from it is how you compensate them for using their space. I do not do this because I feel pressured, but because I spend a lot of time in coffee shops and understand that they aren't extensions of my living room.\\n\\nAnd Palio's space is great: there's booth seating, as well as big dining room-type chairs with padded seats. The tables are large enough that you could use them as a desk if you wanted to. There are reading lamps, and giant windows that look out onto the street. It's a great place to get work done or people watch. I have friends who swear by it as a first-date spot.\\n\\nAs other reviewers have mentioned, there are other coffee shops in the area: Oui Presse, Tiny's Upper Left, Cellar Door, Ford, and Spielman are all on the border of Ladd's.

Their homefries are boring, but acceptable (I prefer mine cooked with a bit more herbs and spices and such. Their eggs are cooked well. I enjoy their smoothies, which are nothing really special but are very well priced and a good value. The real gem, which I even hesitate to write here so that people won't snatch them up, is their muffins. Don't be deceived, some of their muffins are clearly from Costco or something like that, but they also have a batch or two of homemade muffins that are (no joke) some of the best muffins I have ever had.

It's not necessarily the best or the most flavorful, but it's unique.\\n\\nI came to Doc Chey's somewhat frequently because it was within walking distance of Emory University, and my friends and I liked it well enough.  One girlfriend claims she suffered food poisoning after eating there, but I don't know if that rumor's true or not.\\n\\nIt took me a while to find my favorite dish here: the rice and noodle bowls were too heavy on the carbs and didn't offer me enough meat or taste, really, for my liking - they were somewhat bland.  Then I tried the salads... and we had a winner!\\n\\nThe salads, especially the Japanese ginger salad with soba noodles, grilled chicken and the spicy ginger dressing is just the ticket.  It combines all the noodles I needed with lots of chicken, veggies and a nice, flavorful dressing.  And like many other people have said, there's enough there for 1.5 to 2 meals for the price of between $8 - $10.  Not a bad deal.\\n\\nService isn't always the best, but they're used to splitting checks and they're pretty good about refilling drinks in a timely manner.  And the ambiance is ok - I like it better sitting outside on their patio, but that's just me.  Getting a salad to go is another good option.\\n\\nAnyway, Doc Chey's is fine, and like I said, it's unique in that everything isn't deep fried or drowned in sauce like some Asian restaurants are wont to do.

Olive Garden has gone under so many changes since they first opened. Yet again they have re-re-re-modeled this location in Altamonte Springs and you are left to wonder why they wasted the money on so many revisions?\\n\\nThis visit was typical in that we waited 30-40 minutes for a table. They were packed around 6pm and there were several families ahead of us. No problem. We've done it before.\\n\\nWhen we were finally seated I got a sense that our waiter wasn't quite all there. I'm not sure what was distracting him, but he was non-existent. Then he got our drink orders wrong and then forgot to put in our appetizer order which came out really, really..... extremely late. I almost told them to forget it but I'm glad I didn't because they screwed up our main order.\\n\\nAt first we thought it was my steak which delayed things but instead they told us they over cooked the chicken and had to re-do. While my daughter ate her meatballs and spaghetti, my steak came out which was ordered medium-rare which it wasn't.\\n\\nI've got to stop my review here and explain something. I'm a bit of a expert on grilling. Do you know how to grill a medium rare steak? Get your open grill really hot, 800 degrees if you have a good one. Lay down the steak which has been smothered in Olive Oil (don't worry it will burn off). Add salt and pepper. Wait 3-4 minutes depending on the height of your grill. Flip. The cooked side should be crispy brown with some black. Wait 3-4 minutes. Pull of the heat and put it on the plate. Serve.\\n\\nI know it sounds simple.  It really is. It just takes some practice to know the heat of your grill and the subtle nuances of flames from gas, wood or charcoal sources. However if you cook a steak for more than 3-4 minutes on any decent grill.... you won't have any more PINK left in the center. That's the key. Less time on the grill, the more rare the center. Cook the outside. Leave the inside pink.\\n\\nNow back to my review.\\n\\nThe steak that came out was shoe leather. Yes. I literally could have used it for shoe leather. It was so tough and so hard that my steak knife had trouble cutting it. Needless to say I sent it back. I told the waiter, \\"Tell them to cook it for three minutes each side. Then bring it out to me.\\"\\n\\nWhile I waited for my steak to return the chicken finally came out. Six minutes later my steak came out and when I cut in to the middle it was pink. Wow.\\n\\nI'll say this for Olive Garden. I've been there a thousand times and in ten different states. All my previous experience were great. However this happened to be the worst visit to an Olive Garden, of all time.\\n\\nI was very disappointed and was ready to give (2) stars for this review BUT... there is a silver lining to all of this visit.\\n\\nThe manager came out and knew we were upset. I comp'd the bill. Wow. That was so super cool. It really was a class act. Exactly what managers are supposed to do.\\n\\nI gotta say it is rare to see this sort of act from a manager. Most of the time they are clueless but this guy was a Good Fella type, you know what I mean?

However, in the last year we've become less and less impressed.  The quality of the food has lessened for the price and it's really hit or miss on if you're going to like what you ordered that day as much as the last time you had it.  Then, we started having issues with the lanes being slanted enough to disrupt your game (granted sometimes for the better), the shoes being so slick you'd almost slide to the ground, and the pins not setting right so you constantly have to reset the frame and have frames added back at the end of the game because it counts what you paid for by the frame.\\n\\nNow, its so crowded on the weekend that a typical family of 4 can't even go anymore.  All of the lanes will be reserved in advance so that if you go you have a 1-2 hour wait.  So, you're already paying a pretty high price for the boutique bowling experience itself and then you're paying for food and drinks and extra food and drinks while you wait 1-2 hours.  There's no ability to call ahead and get in line and if you try to reserve a lane instead you have to pay by time instead of by game (it's by game when you show up) so you may not end up booking enough and will end up paying nearly twice as much on the reservation.\\n\\nIt's really become a racket and I suspect our days of enjoying family bowling at The Comet as a friendly neighborhood joint has come to an end."},{"name":"Conin Mexican Cuisine","address":"9111 S Barbur Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"The food is terrible.

It's primarily out of convenience, but in an area with plenty of options, what steers us here more than the other options?\\n\\nFirst, the service. The service we've experienced has always been really good. The staff attitude has always been positive, from the management, servers and bartenders to the host stand, and they've been able to answer any questions with ease. They're good at checking in and refilling beverages, which is a small, but key thing.\\n\\nNext? The food. It's probably a little better than you'd expect from what is essentially an establishment with a sports bar vibe. I love the nachos, but they only come in a massive serving size. For me, it's basically a single serving, but I'd say the plate is generally large enough for a table of 4. My favorite aspect is that the nachos are VERY cheesy, so check any lactose intolerance at the door if you're eyeing them up. The waffle fries are awesome, and as far as apps other than the nachos go, you can't go wrong with their chicken tenders, big dig fries, or the fried pickles. Just beware, that the big dig fries are another dish that are served in a ridiculous portion! We've also tried the clam chowder, which is pretty good.\\n\\nFor sandwiches and dinner, the salmon was surprising good. I normally wouldn't take the gamble from a place like this, but the mustard glaze added a really nice flavor, which was even enough to power through the side of plain rice when mixed with bites of the fish. The other side of green beens were also good, so I'd say this is a good option for people looking to eat a \\"lighter\\" meal. The bistro steak was pretty good, too, with a nice demi glaze that they drench the fries with. It's not the best \\"steak frites\\" dish you'll ever have, but it's not a bad one by any means. I'd say the only thing that I really didn't like was the sloppy barbecue pork sandwich. The sauce was just too much for me. I couldn't finish it...and this is coming from someone who can eat the whole order of nachos. That said, I can definitely see other people liking it, but you need to really like a sweeter bbq sauce, and lots of it. \\n\\nIf you'er thirsty, Tavern has an impressive draft list and a decent cocktail menu. I'm not high on the sweeter cocktails that are served in places like this, but the whiskey smash is decent (I prefer it with Bulleit). \\n\\nOverall, Tavern in the Square's food is exactly what we expected. It's not spectacular, but most of what we've tried is better-than-average bar food. The prices are fair for the area and portions. The combination of the food, price, nice, attentive staff, restaurant cleanliness, and convenience is probably what keeps us coming back. That, and they have a nice little rewards program that's been a bonus. Would we go out of our way to go to Tavern? I'm not sure, but if you're in the area or leaving/going to and event at the Garden, I'd say it's generally a safe bet.\\n\\nPerhaps the only downside is that it can get busy at times, and during TD Garden events and/or football season when they show every NFL game, one employee mentioned that it get a little crazy and crowded. We've only really experienced Tavern when it's NOT like that, though, so hopefully the positives don't drop off too much when they're under the stress of big crowds."},{"name":"Santorini Cafe","address":"11800 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The U.

With a small amount of queso crumble and the avocado, it was rich but really light to eat - I wish I ordered 5-6 of these during my visit. Out of the 4 sides on the side, salsa roja was my favorite - that sweet smoky flavor really enhanced every bite of the tacos.\\n\\nCons - the beef components in the carne asada, cowboy, and the el conquistador were a bit dry/over cooked.

It's been a day and I can't get the cocktails and food out of my mind. Consider this a 4.5 star review.\\n\\nLet me get my only 2 complaints out of the way so we can focus on why this is one of the best new restaurants in town. First, the space is super loud. I had a hard time conversing with my husband and found myself constantly leaning in to hear him. And with the restaurant being so good, it's packed, ensuring it's loud the entire time you are there.  And the only disappointment of the meal food-wise was the churros and chocolate. The chocolate sauce was just too bitter. There was a bit of marshmallow in the chocolate, but it didn't really bring any sweetness to the sauce. The churros were tasty, crunchy on the outside with a nice soft inside. But it was like eating bitter chocolate with them, which was super disappointing. \\n\\nAlright, back to the amazing: so we started off with a couple of cocktails. I had the La Chiquitita, which was a delicious balance of alcohol, sweet and then a back end of savory that blew me away. Husband sucked down the Desert Drifter, which had a fresh and clean tasted I particularly liked. Later in the meal we noticed a table next to us get a drink that looked particularly pretty so we had our waitress bring us one to share. It was the Don Dario and another solid cocktail with a sweet and sour thing going on that paired well with the food.\\n\\nWe ordered a ton of little plates to get a good overview of the food. The chips and salsa were way better than I expected. Tossing all of the chips in the salsa so they each were covered in tasty, tasty sauce is brilliant. I could not stop eating these and appreciated their take on the tortilla chip. It came out with the Chicken Tamal, which I am still pondering. A dark black masa base with the chicken on top, it was super savory, salty, spicy and unusual. I liked it, thought it was too salty at one point, and then realized it was the spices and fell in love once more.\\n\\nThe Suadero Tacos is one of the dishes they recommend. 4 little tacos on perfect masa tortillas. The confit brisket was fatty and the avocado salsa was rich. It was so rich I recommend sharing these as I can't imagine eating more than 2. But, the brisket melted in your mouth like meat butter and was sooo good with the tortilla.\\n\\nThe vegetables here are worth saving space. We started with the Peches Y Mangos, a dish reminiscent of Odd Duck with it's beautiful fruits paired with goat feta and a green goddess sauce that somehow makes a savory dish of 2 super sweet fruits. AMAZING! The Mushroom Frito was crispy and crunchy, almost like chips. But it's oyster mushrooms!

My mom loves their shortbread cookies with assorted icing colors, I couldn't tell you if the colors had flavors or not but they're extremely popular. I enjoy the fruit pastries and blonde brownie!

I mean it - read my review on Press Grill in the Short North, which we give an enthusiastic 5 stars.  As far as I'm concerned, Press Grill is a Columbus dining institution.\\n\\nBut Press Pub on 5th isn't the same.  It looks nice, but it's not the same.\\n\\nAs others have noted, the dining room is too damn loud.  Last night the patio was packed, but the dining room was only half-full, and you still couldn't hear yourself talk inside.  Management needs to install some sound-dampening wall coverings or tiles on the ceiling or artwork or something.  I'm not too old - the interior surfaces are all hard (\\"bright\\"), and it's too loud inside.\\n\\nThe drinks definitely aren't the same.  The pours are weak.  I had 2 - $10 each Patron margaritas last night, and my wife (who only had 1) offered to drive home, and I didn't hesitate to say \\"I don't feel them at all\\".  I don't care if Press Grill is paid for, and Press Pub needs to make some money... don't rip off your customers by pouring expensive, weak drinks.  Major party foul.\\n\\nAnd the food isn't the same. The menu is the same. But the folks in the back cooking the food don't appear to be the same. I've now eaten here twice - once for lunch and once for dinner. And the food wasn't bad, it merely underwhelmed both times.  Not the same.\\n\\nThe service is friendly.  No complaints.\\n\\nI'm sad, because this is 4 blocks from my office and a few miles from our home.  We want to love Press Pub like we love Press Grill, but we don't.  I gave you two chances, dining here a month apart in case some of this was \\"new restaurant shake-out\\".  \\n\\nIt isn't.  Management needs to either bring in some staff from the short north location, or this doomed Grandview location (which couldn't support a Friendies ice cream, or a Garbage Burger, or others) will eventually be empty yet again. \\n\\nFor now, we'll wave out the car window at Press Pub as we pass by, driving miles further to Press Grill for exactly the same menu (but not the same experience) - and that's 100% management's fault.  \\n\\nFix it.

This isn't a traditional restaurant set-up; you place your order at the counter with one of the handsome Slumbrew dudes or ladies and return when they've prepared it for you. I tried the mac and cheese and the herb and cheese pizza. I'll be dreaming about both of them until I can have them again. The mac and cheese reminded me of Stouffer's, and I say that in the form of highest compliment. I would eat a gallon of the stuff if placed in front of me.

I had a falafel sandwich the night before from Cafe Agora, which was DELICIOUS... and left me wanting more. \\n\\nUhh.... nothing in comparison at Dania's Gourmet. The fafafel were not even remotely hot (calling it warm would be a stretch). The wrap was tiny too-- and I didn't feel like paying $1 extra for a side (good thing I had some snacks with me to last through the afternoon). The wrap was also stuffed with raw onions. Now, this is a personal preference, but I do not like raw onions at all. But about 1/3 of the sandwich was raw onions (can we say cheap filler?). So I picked them all out. The flavor of the wrap was not exciting either-- kind of bland and made me lust for Cafe Agora's falafel sandwich even more. \\n\\n$5 (before tax) for a stingy flavor-lacking falafel wrap at Dania's Gourmet, or $7+ for a filling flavorful hot falafel sandwich at Cafe Agora? Hmm... I'll pay the $2 extra any day, thanks. There's better restaurants on Broad Street that I can get much more food than at Dania's for about $5 .

Upon entering the restaurant it's small and has the local vibe which I like.  You quickly note the regulars as they were able to place an order without looking at the menu. Lol.\\n\\nI first started with the hush puppies, which were hot and tasty and a pretty decent amount on the place.  I then moved on to the crab cake for my meal.  Overall the crab cake did not wow me.  Don't get me wrong, not much filler at all.  However, not much flavor.  Even the meat itself did not have a strong crab taste to it.  Also for the price of $15 it does not come with anything.  It's served on top of a bed of lettuce or you can have it on a bun.  No sides included...To me a bit pricey.  If were listed as an appetizer, that's one thing but it's not.  I'd like to see a crab cake dinner option :).\\n\\nLast but not least $4.50 for a bottled Corona...sheesh.\\n\\nOverall, I'd give them another go for a fried fish dinner, but I would only if it comes with sides :)."},{"name":"Mattie's","address":"811 W Live Oak St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Incredibly disappointed.  Some of the worst service I've ever had.\\n\\nWe went here for my husband's birthday and I was hoping for a special experience.  I will admit that we arrived almost 15 minutes late due to a snafu on the part of our rideshare driver and we had a reservation for drinks two hours later at Midnight Cowboy.\\n\\nHost was incredibly kind and accommodating after our late arrival.  He seated us right away although we were waiting on one more who had a similar issue with their rideshare.  A waiter brought us water and that was it.  Fifteen minutes later, we still had not been helped.  Whenever I tried to get his attention, I couldn't find him or he didn't look our way.  A manager saw me trying to get his attention and took our drink and appetizer orders.  I also told the manager we were on a time crunch and needed to leave at a certain time.\\n\\nDrinks and appetizers came, but we were missing one.  I checked to make sure it was coming, and our waiter informed us that he was not told about that one and asked whether we still wanted it.  We did.  I then had to push to get our food orders in to make sure everything arrived on time.\\n\\nWhen our dinner arrived, they didn't ask whether we wanted the appetizers cleared, so the few remnants were left on the table.  They took away a few of the appetizer plates, but not all.  Three members of our party had ordered the fried chicken - two were men and one was a woman.  The woman was served her food last; she was literally kept waiting while everyone else had their food.  I have never seen that at a fine dining establishment.\\n\\nAfter dinner, I wanted to make sure we could get desserts so I had to again try to get the waiter's attention to get a dessert menu.  We ordered a dessert and I asked if we could get a candle for my husband's birthday.  They said sure, but no acknowledgement of his birthday, which was very odd to me.  They brought it out promptly at least, but without any utensils to eat it with.  I then had to track down another server to get utensils to eat the dessert.  And they still left the appetizers on table while we were served dessert!  I started stacking my own plates.\\n\\nThen I had to track down the waiter to get our checks.  At no time were there check-ins during dinner to see if we needed more drinks, how the food was, etc.  Abominable service for a place that is considered fine dining in Austin.\\n\\nHow was the food?  In my humble opinion, it was fine, nothing special.  I have honestly not had such bad service in a long time.  Do not waste your time or money here."},{"name":"Bob Evans Express","address":"4600 International Gateway, Terminal B","city":"Columbus","stars":"2.5","text":"I had an excellent breakfast here for lunch with great service.

This is run by a family, making it their family business. It's fairly new; more than a year. It's not considered a restaurant, but rather under the fast food category, which is why their cutlery is plastic & not stainless steel, according to one one of the owners.\\n\\nYes it's considered a fast food place, so don't expect restaurant quality. It kind of reminds me of the food you can get from the Philippines, what we call 'carinderia', which means a food stall with a small seating area typically found in a market or roadside. Which is typically what this place is like, hence the small area.\\n\\nSince it is a small place, the owners go around chatting with the customers ensuring everything is well. They're quite friendly & accommodating.\\n\\nThe place could use maybe some decorations on the walls, but other than that it's an okay place to satisfy cravings. For the decent price you can get a complete meal; your choice of main dish + plain rice (or pay extra for garlic or java) + soup Or you can can choose the 'all day breakfast' where they serve silogs.

There's a good number of options for vegetarians and meat eaters alike. The problem seems to be in the execution. Most dishes we ordered were flavorless and under seasoned. The mozzarella sticks were made from frozen, but the side of marinara that it came with was good. The fried zucchini seemed to be homemade but was lacking in flavor. The pizza was okay. The sausage on the pizza came in the form of small pellets... not good. We ordered extra cheese on the pizza which was a mistake because it was way too cheesy (and I rarely say that). The crust was okay and tasted handmade. The house made spaghetti was very good. The chicken parmesan and baked manicotti were both okay. The salad was okay and the house italian dressing was very garlicy and good. The breadstick were very undercooked and not edible. The prices were average, certainly not a bargain.

Unfortunately, they just don't seem to be hitting on all cylinders (coupled with them trying just a bit too hard to be trendy). Although they have a very well stocked bar, the first time I went they were out of sweet vermouth and couldn't make a Manhattan. And despite it being one of the most expensive things on the menu, they were out of fatty tuna. What kind of sushi place that's only semi-busy runs out of fatty tuna??\\n\\nThe second time I went, my date ordered an Asian Pear Martini, which they couldn't make because they were out of Asian pears. Uh, hello? There are several Asian markets just down Buford Highway that have Asian pears. Go get a bag until your next delivery shows up. When she ordered a backup drink, the bartender proceeded to tell her it wasn't any good and pushed her to the lychee martini. First, if it's not any good then take it off your menu. Second, don't presume to know people's tastes. We both thought the lychee martini was way too sweet.\\n\\nThe fish is actually very fresh and the sushi, sashimi, and maki were very good both times.

Pretty much every other bakery I've ever gotten a cake at, it has been brought out back for a decorator to do it, not here though.

Definitely nothing special and typically if you're paying that price you expect better meat. We also got the banh xeo and it didn't stick out. It's good though! Just not great. We also tried the curry and the sweet and sour soup. One thing I notice though is that their prawns are good. That was my attempt to tell my lunch mates that it wasn't that bad. The prawns make up for the price I guess! Unfortunately there wasn't any coffee the day we went. This was lunch time!

My first time here was a strong 4 but my second time was between 2.5 and 3. If you average it out, it's definitely under 3.5, which was unfortunate because it was mostly for service the second time around. I came for lunch twice with drastically different experiences. \\n\\nFood here overall is pretty decent. I've had a little bit of everything and while it's nothing unique or mind-blowing, it was tasty and I enjoyed it. I've ordered:\\n\\nChicken Paitan Ramen - solid. It's not Totto Ramen, but I liked the tender chicken thigh slice on top of the ramen. \\nTakoyaki - not bad. Nothing to complain about. NOT a fan of the flavorless and dry hardboiled egg in my ramen. \\nKatsu Curry Rice - definitely the biggest bang for your buck. It comes out in an extra large bowl and is filled to the brim with curry and rice. The Katsu is standard: crispy without being dry.\\nGyu Don - the beef on rice was pretty tasty - not a bad option, especially if you do half bowl with your ramen order. \\nMini Chashu Don - they only make this in the combo add-on size. It is honestly enough for one person to make a light meal out of it. The egg was almost not runny - borderline over medium. But it was just runny enough to mix with the rice. I would love to see this as a full size $9-10 portion, so we can order this as an entree without any trouble... see below explanation about service. \\nSpicy Premium Tonkotsu Ramen - this was just ok. I was once again not impressed with the dry yolk of the hardboiled egg - either leave it out, or soft-boil it, please. \\n\\nOur service was definitely a little weird the first time but terrible the second time around. I get that Yebisuya is still pretty new, but there are just ways to be honest to the customer without being rude. For example, when we walked in at Sunday lunchtime with a group of 10 people with no reservation (I know, bad call on my part), don't ROLL YOUR EYES at me and go \\"oh.........\\". Keep that to yourself, please. Also, just because I only want the mini chashu don even though my friend ordered the ramen... why does it matter? If I hadn't confided in you that we were sharing you wouldn't have made a big deal. You don't need to tell me that \\"we won't make any money if people keep doing that\\". That's not on me... that's your fault. \\n\\nI recommend calling ahead if you have a group of 8 or more - they will seat you in a private room, where you are requested to take off your shoes. It was nice and quiet, but make a reservation so the hostess won't stress out and react aggressively. \\n\\nOverall, the food is not too shabby, although similar to Shoya right next door, but without the sushi. I hope that Yebisuya is still ironing out service and pricing issues that do not need to be communicated to the customer."},{"name":"The Matador","address":"1438 NW 23rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Came here for early happy hour to join some friends there.

The elevator music they have piped in kind of gives off a \\"meh\\" tone, but it's not loud so it's tolerable. \\n\\nThe menu is mainly seafood, with other stuff peppered in. We decided to start with the appetizer sampler for two which contained two shrimp tacos, two crab cakes, and arugula salad. Everything was super tasty and full of flavor, the crab cake especially had a lot of meat with little breading - my favorite way to prepare it. For my main I had the grilled chicken breast sandwich which came on a pretzel roll and served with homestyle potato chips. I'm a sucker for anything on a pretzel roll so I was definitely a fan - the flavors worked well together, definitely a winner. \\n\\nWhat The Wave lacks in ambiance, it makes up for with killer service and great food. It may not be a destination dining spot in Disney, but is worth a try if you're in the Magic Kingdom area."},{"name":"Thunder Falls Terrace","address":"6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"3.5 rate\\n\\nThe chicken and rib dinner is an average dinner. The bbq  ribs were so tasty, that it had a fruity mango flavour with a deep smoked finish. The flavours were definitely accomplished by marinade and/ or dry rub. Chicken was moist, while the rice and beans was nothing out of the ordinary. Lastly, a piece of corn finished the meal. The type of meal here was fairly priced for the location; you can expect to pay. Good news is that you have many of options, because this park is close to International Dr. \\n\\nI did find some alternative choices that were fairly reasonable. For two dollars each, rice with beans is a good choice or a pice of corn for  $4. For a large family I would suggest look at packing your lunch or taking a break from the park. Theme wise, this park has so many options to choose from. I have my eye on a mammoth sized smoked turkey leg ($14.99) that comes with fries.

I want to say it's $11 and a great value. The tenders are full strips of chicken not that ground chicken product. They have a light crisp to them, definitely more chicken than breading. I got mine with honey mustard and it was really good, not sure if they make it in house or not. But the key to a good chicken finger basket is the fries. These fries are really good. They taste and look like strips of fried potatoes. Again not that mushed and reformed product, it had a much fresher taste to it.

Called ahead and the staff suggested my party of four arrive before 6:30 for a better chance at getting a table, as Au Comptoir does not take reservations. \\n\\nOur party arrived at 6:30 and was seated immediately. It's important to note that about after 15 minutes after we sat down the restaurant started to fill up. We were attended to with water and menus along with the daily special promptly. The server was also helpful in helping us select wine. (Wine list and menu is mostly in French, and all their servers are French speaking natives)  \\n\\nFrom reading previous reviews I was skeptical about the service of this restaurant. However, I thought the service throughout the evening was pleasant. I guess some people are not used to going to traditional French restaurants or may experience cultural difference as most of the servers are French natives. The servers may seem snooty, but they only want patrons to have the best experience (wine pairing, etc) the French also take their cooking very seriously, so it's rude to not finish your food or to season the dish before tasting it.\\n\\nThe compulsory bread basket was fresh with a crunchy crust. For starters we had the albacore tuna and foie gras. The flavour of the tuna fish was balanced with smokiness from the fish complimenting well with fennel and Cr√®me fra√Æche. I didn't try the foie gras but it was well received by our party. \\n\\nFor entree I had the ling cod, and I must say it was cooked perfectly and the sauce was very buttery. It has to be one of the top ling cod dish I ever had. The dish was well constructed, placed beautifully, and well portioned. \\n\\nThe only thing that bothered me were the fruit flies. Because the restaurant is an open set up to W4th ave, during the summer the front of the restaurant is wide open to the street, brining in unwanted bugs in the restaurant. \\n\\nOverall my first experience was everything I expect from a French bistro.

It took over 20 minutes for a simple #2 and a kids meal. When they handed it to me the fries were cold. I told them and they said they would drop some more. It was almost big joke at that point. Get home with the food, I didn't a #2, not even a #1, I would call it a #0.5, just one hamburger patty, no cheese with just onions, lettuce and tomato. Not even close to a double cheese, THAT I PAID FOR. My kids meal was more of a cold charcoal briquette on a cold bun, and it had more condiments than my #0.5. Had to throw it out.

GREAT SERVICE BTW"},{"name":"The Busy Bee Cafe","address":"810 Martin Luther King Jr Dr SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Last month my company had food catered from this restaurant. Talk about being impressed!  we had fried chicken, black eyed pea, collard greens and macaroni and cheese. I enjoyed it so much I even took a plate home to enjoy for dinner. \\n\\nFast forward to today. A friend and I wanted to grab some lunch and catch up. I suggested this place based on how much I enjoyed the food at work. We made our way to MLK, and I regret the decision. My  opinion of this restaurant has now been tainted. I am going to walk you through our experience. \\n\\nFirst, finding the place is a breeze. It's located directly across from Wal- mart, and has a decent sign out front. Do note that the parking lot is small and you will likely be better served to just parallel park on  MLK. As we approached the restaurant, it was clear that we would have a wait. There were approvingly 15-20 people waiting outside. We walked into the restaurant hoping to get placed on the list to be seated.An older gentleman approached us and said \\" can you step outside please?\\" I was like oh my what did we do wrong????!!! So, if you are going to go, please do NOT  cross the threshold of the entrance unless you are instructed to do so. This seemed to be something everyone should know. The gentleman  proceeded to advise us that the wait was over an hour. The manner in which this was stated, was as if he was trying to convince us to leave. I am really big on tone and infliction, and what I received is-- you don't want to wait! After talking with my friend we agreed that we would rather place a to-go order.  When we told the gentleman we wanted to place a to-go order he instructed us to stand behind another gentleman. We were allowed to go inside about 10-15 min later. Once inside it was clear that this restaurant needs to use s better process. No one had a specific job. Anyone can place to go orders, and anyone can cash customers out. It's a bit chaotic, and inefficient. After about another 10 minute wait we were able to place an order. The young  lady who took the order lacked any type of personality. It was clear that  service is not a priority here. All staff appear to be stern and unhappy with their jobs. So the order is placed and guess what- we now have to wait to pay!!  Talk about being over this experience at this point. Another lady eventually  takes the money for the order and we are instructed to step back outside to wait for the food. \\n\\nOutside again, forced to inhale second hand smoke of both cigarettes and marijuana. (I do understand that this is beyond the restaurants control). We are outside for another 30-45 minutes. We observed at least two people that placed to go orders after us, receive their order and leave. (I enjoy patronizing  black owned businesses, however, experiences like this disappoint me, and drive my dollar to other places that are friendlier and show me that they value me as a customer.)  My friend calls into the establishment to check on the status of the order. Yes, we call because we fear approaching the door as we were not instructed to do so! She was told that our order was ready. She goes to the door and explains that our food is ready-- and guess what-- she was told she had to wait before entering!! I am not joking- entering this building is like entering the White House- you better have clearance!!  I am standing outside waiting on her for at least 10 min!! She  eventually walks out with our food in tow and we head to the car. I feel like we waited the same amount of time for a to-go order as we would have if we chose to dine in. \\n\\nWe get to the car and check our order. Just when you think it's over---Yes, you guessed it- we were missing two items!!! At this point I feel my blood pressure rising. I walk back to Busy Bee and was immediately granted access to the inside after letting the older gentleman know that my order was incorrect.  He instructs me to go to the back of the restaurant and ask for the chef. I follow the instructions given, but never saw the chef. A young man asked what was wrong. As I was telling him what was wrong, another female staff injected herself into the conversation and looked over my receipt. She actually said \\" I don't see banana pudding on the receipt!\\" Why would I lie about what I paid for???? I was handed the small banana  pudding I ordered. and eventually a serving of dressing was delivered to me. Not once did ANY staff member apologize for the error, or even offer me anything for my trouble. What I did get was \\" are you straight now?\\" --- my response- \\"yes, but I assure you I will NEVER be back.\\" \\n\\nIt's nothing to have a good product if you don't value the customers that support you. . In a city where there are a million dinning options- it's critical. As stated above, I have no desire to ever go back to Busy Bee."},{"name":"Vanbarry's Public House","address":"4120 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Great spot to meet friends for happy hour!

You get about 6 balls and it had great flavor! \\n\\nThe tonkatsu dish (pork cutlet with rice and sides) seemed to be of good portion size but it was misappropriate in cooking meaning the middle was slightly underdone and the ends were burnt to a crisp!

While is always hard to replicate a good deeply rich flavored mole (it usually takes hours and maybe even days to get those rich flavors), their chicken mole was surprisingly well seasoned and rich for a quick service restaurant. The tinga had tons of flavors as well - I'd definitely come back to have these again. The tortillas tasted handmade which was a HUGE plus for me, and while they added some unnecessary toppings a la gentrified or high end style, the tacos were very delicious and I was pleasantly surprised.\\n\\nDrink: I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but a part of their concept is Baya Coffee, so I had to try a cappuccino. It tasted perfect! They even have their own sugar/cream station where you can add to your drink as desired. Both hot and cold coffee options are available. They also brought out some tastings of their strawberry lime agua fresca (fresh juice) which was very refreshing and tasted just like pure fruit juice without anything added.\\n\\nService: Not a single issue here, granted it was an event, but all the employees were kind, courteous, and super helpful!\\n\\nAmbience: It's effectively inside of the Whole Foods so it has more of a food court vibe to it, but there's plenty of seating (both indoor and outdoor), and they really lean into the Loter√≠a vibes with their murals and decorations.\\n\\nParking: This whole foods and shopping center was built for people, so there's a bunch of parking in the garage or open lot.

As does most of the people in Winthrop. I can't believe this place hasn't been reviewed yet!\\n\\nIt's not an ice cream place - but a breakfast/lunch place. Opens at 6AM (I believe, it might be 6:30AM), and closes around 3PM. There's a counter where you can order your coffee/tea and breakfast - they have an enormous selection of iced coffee (my favorite being Snickerdoodle), and fresh baked muffins (and they also get a daily shipment of Grandpapa's Yogurt Muffins, which I looooove).\\n\\nGet their french toast - it's seriously the best french toast I've ever had! They have a huge breakfast selection - filled with your standards (eggs, breakfast meats, eggs benedict, etc), and some of their own creations. My favorite is the \\"Mountain Muffin\\" - a toasted English muffin with... cream cheese, grilled ham, a fried egg, avocado, and melted cheddar cheese. It's DELICIOUS. When my brother was in town we'd order up plates of french toast and mountain muffins... and sides of bacon. It was AWESOME.\\n\\nGo early during the weekends, as come 10AM everyone has the same idea and the line goes out the door for food. They have only about eight tables, so it's a small place, and it fills up fast. And since it's a \\"townie\\" breakfast joint, everyone knows everyone. And it's entertaining to watch. :) But go there every day for a week, and they'll recognize your breakfast order and coffee order soon enough (as they did with me when I was craving them every morning!). \\n\\nThey also do smoothies and sandwiches, which I've heard was good... I just can't bring myself to change my breakfast or ice coffee order. Why mess with a good thing if you don't have to? :)"},{"name":"Oppa Sushi","address":"185 Harvard Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Places like this really makes me wish I could give 1/2 stars since 3 seems too low and 4 too generous.

The host sat us upstairs and was super friendly and polite. \\n    However, after waiting 15 to 20 minutes to be asked what we would like to drink or to even check to see if this was our first time (which it was) to explain how the hot pot style of dinner went, we just started to watch the other servers serve the table next to us and the others across the room. \\n    Soon after, we had our server come to the table to ask us what we would like to drink and grew immediately restless when we did not answer her fast due to the fact that no one pointed out on the menu where the drinks were nor gave us enough to read collectively. I politely said \\"We just need a few more minutes\\" and she stormed off. \\n    Another 10 minutes past and we knew what we wanted for a broth and the sides and even our drink orders, she eventually came back to put in our orders. \\n    Another 10 minutes went by and we still had no water or our drinks. Shortly after noticing that it was taking longer than we thought, our drinks came from two other servers.\\n    Eventually our broth comes and no one turned on the stove (by this time we ordered our drinks and food all at once but only the broth came first) and had us wait another 10-15 minutes. By then we'd finished the majority of our drinks and needed napkins but our original server was on the other side of the room just talking and laughing with another co worker. \\n    When our food arrived we enjoyed it a lot. However, we still needed more napkins and refills but our server was still talking and laughing with her co worker. There was no way for any party at my table to at least wave our hand to get her attention due to the fact that she was half way between the kitchen and the other side of the restaurant. \\n    Thankfully the other servers helped us and served us while their co worker was just laughing and eventually ONLY SERVING THE OTHER TABLES ACROSS THE ROOM WHO LOOKED LIKE HER. \\n    The second time we saw our server she only brought us the bill and then acting super friendly. She did not like the fact that we were all persons of color and barely tried to interact with us. \\n    The server had the nerve to ask (more like scream) \\"No tip? No tip?\\" I stated \\"No.\\" and my boyfriend said \\"No, you did not do anything\\" she stormed off. I also wrote on the bill \\"Poor service\\" just in case she did not understand or get the message and she took a picture on her iphone. \\n    We weren't mad or rude/disrespectful to our server or anyone in the restaurant and in fact we were all pretty quiet just waiting for our food and drinks and towards we did laugh all together very loudly after she asked for a tip. Other than that, we did not understand why we were being treated as such and just wanted some food and more napkins.      \\n    Please be aware that this type of atmosphere is very common in many restaurants in Chinatown due to the experiences I had and other friends/family members experiences. We will not being going back just because the color of our skin was not accepted or stand to be treated any differently whatsoever. \\n     Only gave two stars because their food was really good and fresh."},{"name":"Kabob Kabob Persian Food","address":"432 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"I was already full when I walked past this food truck.

The chicken souvlaki had no grill marks or seasoning possibly boiled? and the lemon potatoes, minimal flavour and defs no lemon.  Didn't even bother with the rice cuz I just felt it would be a waste of carbs.  Didn't try the carrots cuz I figured if they can't make greek salad, which they can't, why would I try the carrots?   Tzaziki tastes like they ran out of their actual mix so they added a bunch of yogurt to make it through the night so it was runny and flavourless and that's giving them credit for the original having any flavour at all.

Do yourself a favor and go to the French Cultural Center off Granville for bistro style french food.\\n\\nNever set foot in there again!!!!!!!! \\nI cannot say with how much disdain and anger I feel toward the rude and possibly racist waiter we had this afternoon. A french frog he is and if he were on the menu as a food item, it would be thrown out in the back alley dumpster or used as pig feed!!!! I might even have him as a meal of frog legs myself but the food there did not look appetizing or authentic.  He was nearly starving for another good tip at all costs, even if it meant to ignore 1 of 2 people at our table. The food was cheap and overly simple, very oily...not much food. Ambiance.  If we were in the 1800's and certain public humiliations were allowed, I would put this taller, balding, skinny (no hips) blondie french guy on trial for his life.  I have never felt so humiliated and angry and made to feel so insignificant / invisibile as I experienced today in my whole life traveling the world including France.\\n\\nThis waiter showed up to tell my friend \\"I miss you\\" and \\"where have you been?\\" and more flattering, flirting and discussions in private as if it was a private service to her and only her with a nearly full restaurant that I felt sick as we were guided to our seat.  The entire time up to the last second, he spoke and flirted with her while ignoring me except to ask what I ate once.  I basically did not get any service.  I had to waive down another server to get a refill.  \\nI left them alone for 10 minutes busying myself in the washroom and when I returned it got worse Apparently in this case she gave a good tip to him the few times she dined there alone.  I told him at the beginning (joke!!) that I was jealous that he was not flirting with me ...that was a joke and a hint that he basically acted as if I did not exist.  When I asked if he knew the chef's name I got all sorts of facial tics and expressions like I was crazy. I explained one other time that I like to learn where the chef was educated and he came up with two first names, even though I asked for last names and he kept insisiting I meet them over and over. I explained I wanted the name for my personal research, that I did reviews, and that I wanted to learn whether the food was authentic french or not depending on where the chef was educated...the food did not seem like traditional french food esp. the fries which were more like thick greasy steak fries.  I told him at the very end that he should never ignore or basically ask the other guest like me if I wanted anything to eat and to not interrupt conversations to flirt or talk..  I wanted to maybe eat something else, or be asked if I wanted something else, maybe order anything, and perhaps be both talkedt to or asked if we wanted dessert...but nope, he wanted to only talk to her. He only talked to the lady across from me who was a stranger and ignored her friend. I guess if you eat well and get tipped well they spend every last second serving you, if not, they ignore you.\\n\\n**PS: brunch does not mean lunch on Sundays. Lunch menu is not included.\\n\\nShe ordered salad with poached eggs (1 egg not 2 she wanted) and duck confit (thin strips of duck) - oily dish and eggs were rawish/runny and he still brought her two eggs not one. The only spring vegetables were a few oil laden potatoes. The duck of the duck confit was missing nearly entirely.  I think her dish was basically oil on frisee with 2 eggs and potatoes.  Even the waffle breakfast is one small liege waffle whereas other places give you two.  Looked simple, cheap and oily...barely there duck for $16.90.  Most meals have frisee in some oily dressing (no tomatoe, cukes, veggie, nothing.  Mostly fries and a little meat or eggs n tiny meat with more oil. The place looks french but chefs are caucasian not from france. The servers seem to have a french accent but i don't know if they are french..or just fake and rude and disengenuine.\\n\\nIf you order croque monsieur or madame - it comes not as a sandwich like all other places but on one slice of bread. Cheap and go hungry home!\\n\\nTo be honest, his behavior and outward disrespect made me lose my appetite. I did not order anything.  Worst ever in the history of being served food (or non-service). No basket of warm baguette and butter/honey like in Paris.  Spend your money elsewhere. I got better service at Mcdonalds and a simple cafe than this place.\\n\\nPPS: to the lady across from me who ate with her friend (also ignored), mind your own beeswax lady!  She told me that its normal for waiters to flirt and that I should be ok with it..really? She later listened to my convo and again interrupted to tell me that the food there is really good and I should try the burger or steak..If I want advice I can ask my waiter...oh wait! he is not there!"},{"name":"Lacomka Russian Bakery And Deli","address":"2050 State Rd 436, Ste 140","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"I have been coming to this store for a very long time until i ordered  candies and my daughter found a maggot in the candies, we had to throw them away.

(A couple examples are: my friend and her boyfriend were in line to get into the club and the lady checking IDs was very rude to my friend (who is white) and very polite to her boyfriend (who is black). I, on one occasion, was waiting on a friend to return to the club, saw him in line outside, leaned near the gate to tell him something quickly, and was promptly yelled at, for literally doing nothing other than having a conversation (I wasn't being obstructive or difficult, I had no drink in my hand, nor was I causing any trouble). The drinks are very inconsistent - either nothing or everything; no in between.

While normally really expensive, they often provide excellent food, service, and atmosphere. Fleming's carries on that tradition for the Winter Park area.\\n\\nMy wife and I decided to stop by Fleming's late one night around 8:30 because one of our other favorite restaurants was having issues. While we normally wouldn't stop by a steakhouse without reservations, it was a weekday and worth taking a risk. Located at the intersection of Orlando Avenue and Lee Road, Fleming's is a beautiful restaurant that was tall ceilings and a large amount of tables in the center of a beautiful ballroom-type of area. However, since it was happy hour, we elected to sit at one of the high top tables near the bar to enjoy their late night happy hour.\\n\\nOnce we had a seat, the waiter came over and told us about their happy hour structure and showed us how to work the electronic menu (always a fun touch!). They actually have all of their drinks listed into several categories, which makes them easy to review. My wife decided to have a cocktail while I decided to get their dark truffle chocolate martini. The martini came with a little chocolate truffle on the martini! Both the truffle and martini made for a great start to the evening. \\n\\nAfter finishing our drinks, we decided to get a couple happy hour meals to share (both were under $12!). We ordered the Prime Burger and Prime Rib Sandwich. Both came out in a relatively short amount of time, and our waiter made sure that everything about our order was perfect. Both entrees were very juicy and delicious, and the chips and fries included with each respective meal were actually seasoned and prepped beyond just throwing them in a fryer. While it wasn't quite a steak meal, the good price for such a good meal made for an absolutely wonderful time.\\\\\\n\\nOverall, Fleming's carries on the steakhouse tradition by providing excellent food and service in a beautiful venue, and their happy hour deals make for a reasonably priced night when you are looking for something a little simpler. My wife and I will definitely be returning for more dinners (both happy hour and regular) in the future."},{"name":"The Matador","address":"1438 NW 23rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Meh food.

I didn't think it was worth the money."},{"name":"Wingnuts","address":"768 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Worst wings ever. Lemon pepper garlic tastes like just nekkid...yes NEKKID... chicken. Bland and flavorless. The wings are small which I don't mind for the cost but I couldn't finish them because they tasted like nothingness. You can't even see but 3 specks of pepper on the chicken."},{"name":"Red and Black Cafe","address":"400 SE 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"$5 bowls of wonder.  I come from NYC, the land of the overpriced vegan eating establishment, and didn't think well-made, healthy vegan fare was available for a price that I'd be comfortable paying.  And then I flew across the country to a magical land where people usually aren't jerks and there is a cozy spot called Red and Black.\\n\\nRemember when food served by white kids with dreads was all vaguely gruel like?  Oh, how the Food Not Bombs food \\"sharings\\" of my youth made me believe that progressive politics had to be served with a side of soggy rice saturated with Bragg's liquid aminos and nutritional yeast.  The Food Not Bombs Condiment Trifecta (siracha,  Bragg's, nut. yeast) is available, but the food stands up well on its own as to not need to be drowned with the usual suspects.   \\n\\nPlus, free wifi, ample study/work space, progressive literature, and cool events with cool people.  I love my NYC progressive book store, but Red and Black makes me wish they could step up their game and offer more than those weird pre-wrapped vegan cookies at their cafe."},{"name":"Texican Cafe - Manchaca","address":"11940 Manchaca Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Had the \\"best\\" tortilla soup.  Not so much.  Also ordered the San Antonio enchiladas to go.  They were all salt.  And the service on the patio was greatly lacking on a Friday night.  Frozen Ritas melted really quickly but we're potent.  Definitely not my favorite.  Going to La Fuentes tomorrow, which IS one of my faves!"},{"name":"Century Bar","address":"930 SE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"DO YOURSELF A FAVOR & DONT BOTHER COMING HERE - If you are a person like me who cares about respect, humanity and service than this is the last place you want to support. Manager/s have nothing better to do than act salty at the randomest stuff - after I left I thought I might just be crazy or it was maybe an off night but even looking at the comments back to bad reviews i can tell this business is run by disrespectful people.\\n\\nMe and my friends came here to watch a game and my friend and I were the DD's - that being said we were ordering squirts the whole day. When it hit 7:30 the bartender asked for our ID's and I'd left mine in my car but my friend showed hers. The bartender informed us that minors have to leave at 9pm so we go COOL we aren't minors? just DD's ordering non-alcoholic drinks..\\n20 minutes later the manager comes up and informs us we need to leave at 8pm (legally minors have to leave at 9pm not 8pm but also we aren't minors) and didn't listen to a word we said and how my friend showed her ID to the bartender already. She comes back at 8pm sharp (THERE IS 3 MINUTES LEFT ON THE CLOCK FOR THIS GAME AND THE SCORE IS 21-20) and she kicks us out even after my friend tried to show her her ID and I told her I could get her mine from the car - didn't listen and didn't care just wanted to kick people out for fun?? or maybe it's because we were buying inexpensive non-alcoholic drinks and wanted to make room for the people who were actually going to spend money drinking?? we weren't being rowdy or loud or anything even close but she kicked us out and her and the security started clapping as we walked away!! how rude!! we weren't doing a thing wrong!\\n\\nHow embarrassing for them.
