You choose your meal and order at the front and then choose your own table and seat yourself and get your own utensils and beverages from the fountain machine.

Wines (some which are rarely seen elsewhere) on tap! and carefully chosen craft beers (haven't tried yet, but they have some special Italian craft beers that sound yummy).  When we went, it was a soft opening, so the full menu wasn't available, but I had a smoked duck panini that was so good, I had another half of one!  Chef Renaldo also brought us a plate of olives he'd smoked; they also had some unusual charcuterie that was also amazing.  Tasting trays as well.  We can't wait to work our way through the full menu of food and drink, at which point I will grant the fifth star.  The unusual thing about Vinoteca is they are also open at 7am for killer coffee and pastries.

I've come here several times purely out of convenience. It's located in a lonely strip mall not really close to anything other than BCIT and a secondary school. Strangely though, it is pretty busy every time I come by.\\n\\nNo.1 is the sister restaurant to Beefy beef on Main and their menu, food quality, service, and terrible parking lots are nearly identical. The food here is your standard taiwanese cafe fare with an extensive selection of fried appetizers, noodle bowls, rice, and various dim sum items. Their bubble tea and dessert options are just as    varied. The food quality is hit or miss. I quite enjoy the sweet and sour fish or pork dishes, wonton in chilli, and the deep fried bread with condensed milk. I find the hot pots to be horrific - some are excessively salty and others are watery. Last time, I ordered the sesame chicken hotpot and it tasted like half the bowl was filled with sesame oil. The beef noodle soups are actually quite good. The bubble teas are decent enough - I enjoy a Chrysanthemum tea in the winter and a watermelon slush in the summers. \\n\\nThe dining room and ambience is nice. Modern, clean, and abuzz with hungry patrons. The service is somewhat inconsistent - some days, I get top notch service from some of the friendliest waitresses and other days, it's as if I took them on a date and never called her back.    \\n\\nNo.1 beef noodle certainly isn't number one in my books but it certainly provides an okay meal that won't break the bank.

Bar service was ridiculously slow (disappointing bc I was really looking fwd to the drinks ), and it took around 45/50 minutes for my date and I to receive the first round. We were about halfway done with our entr√©es when we got them, and we'd each had appetizers. However, our server was super sweet from the beginning, and she did give us an early heads up that they were down a bartender that evening. I could see even she was frustrated with how long the drinks were taking to arrive. Also, I'd ordered the fried curry balls and they were very hard to bite into (much different from the first time I ordered them when they were made perfectly). I felt kind of bad because I'd raved so much about it to my date, and I think (aside from the ambiance) he wasn't very impressed. He did like the drink though.

Since there were only three pieces of tortilla like breads, we had to break them in small bite size for dipping. There's not a lot of sauces to spread out, but we enjoyed taking the time to taste them. Some of the dips tasted sweeter than others, and some tasted like combinations of herbs and chili spices. There was one dip that was comparable to Indian yogurt. The parings is delicious and no doubt, flavorful. \\n\\nFor the entree I went with the \\"Peri Peri Green Circle Chicken\\" ($34). The chicken pieces was tender and the marinate that was used made this meal very tasty. I believe the sauce has some red wine Kanonkop Pinotage as part of the ingredients, so you'll find hints of sweetness. On base of the plate is corn, green peas and shishito peppers.

Plenty of white people inside this establishment when we walked in on a Saturday. They had like the cutest adornments to the place though. Family portraits and a picture of papa/ gramps in his military uniform. You can tell that a lot of love has been put into the place. \\n\\nSo the deal here is that they only offer 2 kinds of soup per day, with a 3rd soup offered on Saturday. The original location, Ha & VL, still only does two a day. I went for the Tumeric Noodles/ Mi Quang ($11). The broth was light with a slight oiliness to it and an almost tomato paste quality. There is a lot going on with the dish with the addition of a few pieces of shrimp along with various bits of pork. Tumeric noodles were orange in color and a little on the al dente side. I'd say the noodles only looked cool and I enjoyed the other ingredients more. The broth definitely was well developed.\\n\\nThe boyfriend's soup, the chicken curry noodle/ b√∫n cari g√†, was the richest of the two and would have been the best if only it stayed hot longer. Either way, it was a hearty soup with a broth that does lean on the thicker curry end, but not quite so.\\n\\nFairly unique and far more traditional than other hipper spots in Portland *ahem* Luc Lac."},{"name":"Teatro","address":"177 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"What a great Italian restaurant.

The design, comfort, and offerings here are really above average. \\n\\nMy first time here I came in for a drink and movie. The bar is nicely stocked with many options but my friends were craving beer. We asked the bartender what beers they offered and he showed us what they had. What was weird is that the beers are not your normal types...though I know its a small matter, when I'm paying for a luxury experience you would think they would have a wider variety instead of super specific beers. Where's the Stella?!\\n\\nAnyways, the process of buying tx is pretty straightforward as they have a counter, two touchscreen monitors, and online purchasing available. Though tickets are a bit more pricey, you pretty much expect it. LUXURY THEATER. \\n\\nAs far as the value of the ticket prices, the theater is very clean and modernly designed. Patrons are able to order outside before going into the movie or can order to their seat in the theater. \\n\\nWHAT I LOVED:\\n- Seating: Wow. Super comfortable, electric recliners with your own personal tray table that moves around. Couldn't have asked for more.\\n- Convenience: Inside the theater you have a button at each seat that allows you to call for service. The service is pretty quick and they attend to any of your food/drink needs. I also loved the parking situation here where they made a covered parking free for visitors. \\n\\nOverall Experience: My overall takeaway was that this theater is definitely a treat. No cramped seating, dirty snack-covered floors, or smelly bathrooms. The entire place is sparkling clean. The theater and screens provide a wonderful movie experience with great sound. The price may be a bit higher but I'd trade 2 movie experiences at a sub-par theater to have 1 experience at this.\\n\\nHope they keep it up."},{"name":"Jiko - The Cooking Place - Temporarily Unavailable","address":"2901 Osceola Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"We were vacationing in Orlanda this past weekend and ate at Jiko on Saturday night, 9/14.

We waited for another 20 minutes before a table for 2 became available (our other friends decided to bail). After 1.5 hours of waiting,  we finally got a small table. At this time,  we were already ready to order and eat. We just ordered a cider sampler - best ones in my opinion were the apricot and dragon fruit. We also ordered the green curry drumsticks, which were pretty flavorful and had a little kick to it. For pizza, we ordered the St. Helen's and added the house sausage to it.

For 4 of us, we ordered Nihari, Biryani, Chicken Karahi, Bagharay Baingan, Raita, Kachumar Salad and Naan. When the food arrived the portions were quite small compared to the price they were charging.

You pay at the kiosk then make your way to one of three dining rooms where you are to seat yourself at any available clean tables. The place was packed so you had to either claim a dirty table and wait for it to be cleaned or wait next to a table full of diners assuming they will finish soon. The dining rooms were beautifully decorated and matched the film wonderfully. You have food runners bring your food from carts as they are ready. I got the braised pork and my husband got the Ni√ßoise salad. The food was actually pretty good. For dessert, we got two cupcakes. One with the grey stuff and one was a rich dark chocolate cupcake. Both were delicious. The best way to describe the grey stuff topping is grey colored, cookies and cream flavored whipped cream.

I said \\"yes\\"... she is just looking at me...finally she says \\"I'm waiting for YOU.\\" I didn't realize they took the order at the counter, and she didn't ask what I would like to eat. So I ordered the breakfast burger...which is a bacon cheeseburger(med-rare) with a fried egg(over easy)on it...and one of their special bloody Mary's. When the waitress picked up my check to see what she was bringing to me, she informed me that I couldn't have the drink until 11...unless it was Sunday? I looked at the menu...nothing about this restriction, and in an airport where people are traveling from places with different liquor laws, it should be posted to avoid this exact moment. Also the hostess ringing up the order should know it, and not charge me for it. So I got a coke, still looking forward to my burger. When it arrived, the first thing I noticed was the egg was fried over hard...not one drop of delicious runny yolk. I bit into the burger anyway...well done, and neither the egg or the burger had any seasoning. So I decided to give it some flavor with their burger sauce. When I squeezed the bottle, nothing came out because the nozzle was dirty (the bottle was full) and clogged with a clot of congealed sauce that I attempted to dig out with a fork, and only succeeded in splattering, with multiple clots all over my plate and table. It's ok though, because after tasting it, it just seemed to be A1 with maple syrup in it. The food, drinks, service, THE ENTIRE EXPERIENCE, was abysmal.

But when I am paying this much for my food, why are they frozen. I can get frozen food at publix for a lot cheaper. After that we received our entrees. I love Lamb so naturally I ordered the lamb chops. The mere appearance on the plat had me upset. If you are going to serve lamb chops at least make it more then a child sized portion. I always order lamb chops when the restaurants have them on the menu, so this is not about not knowing what I am getting. And no just that it was an extremely small potion, they where also extremely over cooked almost to the point of burnt bones. How could they let that out of the kitchen, as Gordon Ramsey would say \\"standards\\". My wife ordered the lamb tagine. It was sad and flavorless. \\nI know the owner owned Cafe Annie's downtown.

It was basically a Taiwanese fried chicken patty with pickled daikon and carrots (much like what you would find in banh mi) and a wasabi aioli. The bao (bun part) is more like mantou, not having that slight sweetness that most guabao have. Additionally, I did find the wasabi aioli to be a little overwhelming at times, but I could just be a wasabi rookie.

This one is pretty disappointing. I'm a vegetarian and Chinese & Japanese food usually offer many options for me to enjoy. Not here. \\nI was very excited to see that they offer a hibachi buffet. The buffet options for hibachi were lacking, but I still managed to find some things to plate so that the man cooking the hibachi could make it for me. What's very upsetting is that the hibachi chef cooks multiple plates at a time. This would be fine, as I've been to a hibachi style restaurant many times before and they cook food together except here, he cooked the food close enough together that another persons food which had beef and shrimp got mixed into mine. Not to mention the way he cleaned off the grill after each round was not impressive. Grease from the previous round was left on the grill and was pretty gross. \\nThe Chinese portion of the buffet has a lot of options for meat eaters, and my fianc√© who isn't a vegetarian said the meat way okay at best. When we first arrived it seems that they hadn't placed fresh food out in a while. The chicken was luke warm and the sauce had begun to become jelly like. He got another plate later and said it was a bit better. \\nFor me, the only options were some steamed vegetables, fried rice and lo mein. The lo mein was awful. It tasted like they made it days prior, froze it, then just threw it in a warmer. You could taste what can only be described as \\"freezer taste\\" where you don't close up the item properly and it tastes like everything in the freezer put together. \\nFried rice was extremely lacking in flavor, and didn't taste fresh either. \\nI didn't even attempt to eat the steamed veggies because they looked past their expiration on the line. \\nFruit options were okay. Watermelon looked bad. Grapes had seeds in them so be careful if you have small children. \\nDeserts were okay. \\nStaff was friendly at best, the woman assisting us at our table saw my upset for the food and didn't try to do anything about it, even told her The hibachi got meat mixed into my plate and didn't offer any solutions. The owner Andy (who I see posting on here a lot) was walking around. I would have thought she'd alert him to see if he can do anything. \\nThe only reason it's getting 2 stars and not 1 is because of the cleanliness of the restaurant itself. It was very tidy and looked lovely.  The seats in the booths are not good though. No cushion and they are caving in. \\nI ended up eating a few bites of rice and lo mein and a small cup of ice cream and some grapes for a total of $12.99 plus tax. \\nIn my opinion, save some money and go down the street to ichiban, they have a bigger selection and have never let us down."},{"name":"Waypoint","address":"1030 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"i like the lights at this place, there so pretty. i love there ousters, i have been here lots of times and we always gt 12 ousters.

We were only there for a day and I knew 6 months in advance when we were going, so I did a LOT of research on what to do and what to eat. We did breakfast here and lunch at Cinderella's Castle. The breakfast itself here was very mediocre. But, Disney is all about the experience, right? Honestly, the part I liked the most was the Grey Stuff cupcake - and I almost didn't get it. I completely forgot to order it at the beginning and asked a waitress about it. Disney employees are told not to say no so she just grabbed one for me. She was really excited to make this happen for me as honestly it's the only thing I HAD to get while at Disney. It wasn't anything extra special, BUT it was still the most delicious thing I had the entire trip. Seriously. Again, this place is all about the experience. Make sure you walk around to see some of the extra things, like the rose. The ballroom felt like you were really in the movie. Like everything at Disney, it was a a lot smaller than I expected (perhaps not to a little one).

I parked in front of the coffeehouse and entered with my family to purchase coffee and some breakfast items. We then go to the Zoo. After leaving the zoo, my car is gone. The coffee shop employees, including the manager/owner, proceed to tell me that they think it was towed, they aren't sure, maybe they saw a tow truck, etc. One person was identified as the manager/owner to me that claimed ignorance of what happened. I call the Atlanta Police and am told it wasn't towed by them and probably was stolen. I sit out there for an hour waiting on the police department and my family goes back into the coffee shop for snacks and drinks. Then, the only honest employee apparently there tells me that they called to tow the vehicle because it was in a truck loading zone. the employee tells me that the owner/manager called it in. I had thought that weekends were okay to park in a loading zone but found out from the Atlanta Police that only on Sunday can you park in a trucking loading zone. So, certainly my fault for parking there and I understand that it was towed but couldn't the coffee shop have asked me not to park there when we went in for breakfast or at least told me when we returned, while we were purchasing more items? I'm glad one employee was honest and upfront at least so that I didn't wait for the Atlanta Police and then file a false report. The coffee shop uses a private towing service so the Atlanta Police had no record of it being towed. The towing service even told me that the manager/owner called in the request. Sigh. I loved the coffee shop and we always stopped in twice every time we visited the Zoo but I guess that's over with now.

Their menu was a four-course set, and most of the food was neatly divided into two on each plate, so I was able to easily split things with my dining buddy.\\n\\nFirst came a seafood entree, and I'll have to say that this was weak. I had a tuna \\"pok√©\\" with quinoa, though it was so small I'd barely call it that, and the flavours were very bland. My friend had a ceviche that was just... lame. It was long strips of salmon mixed with greens, and barely a hint of acid. I fell in love with ceviche eating it in Peru where they serve chunks of white fish drowned in citrus or passionfruit acid alongside tangy onions and bright herbs and creamy yams; Peruvian ceviche bursts with flavour and texture, but this felt limp and meagre, like somebody tried to West-Coastify ceviche by replacing all the good things with salmon and kale. It wasn't a great start.\\n\\nLuckily, I think the next two dishes made up for it. I had blue corn fried tacos with a papaya salsa, and those were excellent - the salsa was bright and fruity and zesty, and the chicken was meaty and crisp and not dried out at all. After that came the pork belly confit topped with mild chilies and a maple-tamarind glaze, which was excellently done and a really fun combination of flavours, though I wish they had been a bit bolder with the heat of the chili they chose.\\n\\nMy menu ended up with what was basically a deconstructed cheesecake - a dollop of foamy cream cheese infused with aj√≠ amarillo, served alongside granola and half an aguaymanto. It was a nice combo, and the cream cheese was excellent, though it was a bit small.\\n\\nThe ambiance was very nice overall, with a slightly faux-industrial feel and dim lighting, and staff were very friendly and prompt.

That can work, but only if the dishes arrive at decent intervals.    On our last two visits,  after the first dish there was a very long wait for the next,  and we ended up cancelling the last dish or two, because they didn't show up, and we got tired of lingering over an empty table.  From looking around we could see that most tables received just one dish at a time.   The wait staff run around like mad but aren't very attentive.    They  look stressed.  The drinks were slow in coming too.  Tables of 2 and 4 shouldn't be that difficult to manage.  After this it was a relief, on our next night out, to go elsewhere and get a meal traditionally prepared and served, with a balance of items on the plate, and everybody's appetizers and then mains arriving together and properly spaced.

To say that I was disappointed would be an understatement. It is rare that both the food and the service are so poor, but this restaurant succeeded in both. I tried two take-out orders, the brisket and the smoked sausage. Based on portion size, the quality of the food and service the prices are too high. In my estimation smoked belly BBQ rates no stars.

However, the reason why I'm giving Ludica 3 stars is because of the prices. All the good pizzas cost around 15 dollars and they only serve Phillips beer for 7 dollars a pint. On top of that, you can only play the games for 1 and a half hours, even if everybody on the table orders a complete meal and drinks. By the way, it's usually impossible to play while the large pizzas are on the table, so keep that in mind before opening that Monopoly board while waiting for your dinner. Also, as every board game bar, it gets really noisy as people get excited and yell about their games, so it's not the best dining option if you're just there for the food. I would say this is a great place to go with a group of friends, but eat somewhere else beforehand or order an appetizer to share while you play."},{"name":"Smokebelly BBQ","address":"128 E Andrews Dr NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Great food and great service.

I tend to get the same greens & veggies w/ peanut sauce, since it strikes my fancy. They do a good job busting their asses as the place can get busy so I tend to go on the later side of the lunch rush. \\nThe best thing that I recently discovered is that you can now buy your own glass take out container & then bring it back so you get a new one each time & they clean it. Finally an establishment that is actually trying to make a difference by helping reduce all the waste that currently happens. This is a great concept that will hopefully catch on to other places around town, 'cause that would be awesome. So yeah I give them high praise for making this happen & hope it succeeds.

We checked in around 6, enjoyed some lovely lemon water and the cool view while waiting, and were invited in right about at our reservation time (6:20).\\n\\nThere are three dining areas, although it didn't look like the West Wing or music box room were being used as much as the main ballroom area, which is where we sat.\\n\\nIf there's any drawback to this place, it's really that while it's a romantic French restaurant, it's also huge and echoey and not quite as romantic as it could be.

I read the reviews here before mine and went in the door skeptical that a gem like this could land in our back yard.\\n\\nAs we always do with new restaurants, we first try the old standards.  So this trip (there will certainly be many) my wife had lamb tikka masala, I had tandoori salmon and we shared navratan korma.\\n\\nThe korma was rich but not sweet and at medium spice my wife who orders mild tolerated it well.  The sauce is the feature here as the taste is great and the bowl could do with a few more vegetables.\\n\\nFor the lamb in my wife's favorite sauce, the meat fell apart in a way that only roasted meat can.  Some tikka masala tastes like tomato sauce, there are at least two Indian restaurants in the Orlando area guilty of that, but not here, the flavor takes over even though the sauce is a deep red.\\n\\nI had a side of masala for my salmon.  My fish was prepared natural color rather than rubbed red and brought to the table with onions and peppers sizzling.  The fish was cooked by someone who likes salmon, not too overdone.  Salmon was my standard order at a great Indian place in Lexington, MA and Royal's version stands up to that dish.\\n\\nWhat sums up our experience is that we know we will return here many times, but the difference is we want to try everything.  I've tried unfamiliar dishes at Indian restaurants everywhere we go with mixed results.  While there are few dishes on Royal's menu I haven't heard of, I still tend to stay away from Madras curries and rogan josh unless a kitchen can do them justice.  I'll be having exactly those next time.\\n\\nThe service was as highly attentive as you'd expect for an empty house at 8:30 on a Saturday, but not up in our face.

In addition to burgers, this place is rightfully proud of their \\"world's best\\" milkshakes.  The cashier talked me into trying a cookies and cream shake.  While not the world's best, it was indeed an excellent milkshake and I can recommend it.  My wife ordered a veggie burger which was fantastic, even to an elitist carnivore such as myself.  My crunch burger was cooked correctly and tasted like quality all the way around.  I often order burgers at mid-tier restaurants, and very few have held a candle to this simple airport diner.  \\n\\nAs is often the case, I couldn't decide if I was in the mood for regular fries or sweet potato fries.  Bobby had me covered: they literally offer a half-and-half option for indecisive patrons.  As a lover of sauces, I greatly appreciated the five different offerings on every table.  In addition to the usual ketchup and mustard, there were three more adventurous concoctions, each presumably invented by Bobby Flay.  Something for everyone!  Perhaps most impressive, and the point which tips my reaction to Bobby's Burger Palace into a standing ovation, is their excellent pricing.  Whereas most airport restaurants gouge you on prices, our two-person bill - wine included - was a mere $46.\\n\\nThe employees were even smiley and friendly - not something I'm acclimated to from airport workers.\\n\\nHands down the best food experience I've ever had in an airport."},{"name":"Buffet Palace","address":"12570 SW Center St","city":"Beaverton","stars":"2.5","text":"This place is disgusting.

Lots of tables in a fairly unthemed building. You can see part of the brewery from one location in the restaurant, but that's about it other than some pictures on the wall and a local flag or two hanging from the ceiling. The menu is large, and was on par with the kind of stuff you'd find at a TGI Fridays. Seems to be mostly normal dishes that are jazzed up in some way and are probably a little overpriced. They have a small plates menu that is convenient if you aren't looking for a full meal. All the food at our table was what we were hoping for. The pizza is good and has some interesting topping combinations, but the crust is very soft and fluffy rather than having any crispiness to it. The beer is good, but nothing special either. All of the generic styles you'd hope to find at a brewery, but nothing I would pay double digit prices for a 6-pack of. They did have one seasonal beer, but it didn't delve very far off of the beaten path. There is a ton of seating inside and quite a bit outside as well. The bar inside is a big circle with seating on all sides and plenty of TVs. They have booths and tall tables in the bar area that were all open seating when I was there. They also had a pool table in the back of the bar. \\n\\nThe service definitely gets 5 starts for effort. I was in right before a Blue Jackets game, so it was a packed house. Our waitress was hustling and knew we were going to the game so she did all she could to get us in and out. I think the issue is just that they didn't have enough people to deal with the crowd. I know logistically it's hard to bring in extra people just to handle the hour or two rush before and after those games, but it was noticeable that the staff that was there was a little overwhelmed and the kitchen put out our food slower than I would have expected. The locations is right next to the stadium, so they ought to have something put together to smooth out the process. Overall, not much that was underwhelming, but also nothing that impressed either."},{"name":"Hoggy's Restaurant and Catering","address":"830 Bethel Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"This is my first time here.

Because of that, prices are a little higher than normal. When I was looking at the menu another customer was complaining how high the prices were - but I get it and wasn't bothered. Annnnnyway, they have a good selection of products, most of what you would find at a typical bakery. I decided to pick up a chocolate chip cookie, a coffee crunch doughnut, and a slice of their lemon-iced loaf (I was sharing, I swear ;-).\\n\\nPerhaps it was my palette which is used to gluten (and other ingredients), but I wasn't amazed by any of the products. I was prepared for the texture since I've had gluten-free baked goods before, but most things lacked flavor. The cookie was my least favorite, it tasted too manufactured. The loaf was pretty good, though it would have been nice if the cake itself was lemon flavored rather than just the frosting. The doughnut was my favorite, nice balance of textures and the most flavor out of the three.

We had the breakfast buffet there this morning and it was my favorite meal of our trip! We were staying at a different resort but ended up here because I wanted at least once dining experience at the Animal Kingdom Lodge and this reservation time happened to be perfect for us. First of all, of all the resorts I have been in, this one is my favorite. The lobby is breathtaking. We were greeted at the restaurant by a lovely lady who guessed our party name (I'm sure based off the numbers) which right away set the tone for personalized Disney service. We all ordered the house drink, the Jungle Juice, which was a mix of mango, guava, and orange. If was absolutely delicious. Yeah buffet had a huge variety of items and they were all very fresh. There was traditional African fare, like baboti and chakalaka, which were both delicious! The corned beef with the honey mustard was all quite good.  Traditional egg items as well as made to order omelettes were available. My family does not eat pork and asked if there was any turkey products available and then made us about 24 slices of turkey bacon and brought it to our table. Talk about service! My kiss enjoyed that alongside their Mickey and Simba waffles. The sweets and pastries section also had a nice variety. The guava turn over was really tasty. My favorite sweet was the French toast, which I piled the pecan praline sauce and vanilla sauce over. There was also something that was described as African hazelnut sauce. It didn't  look like Nutella, more like caramel. I tried it plain on my spoon to figure out what the flavor would be and OMG...it was like caramel and Nutella had a baby. Incredibly delicious, so I dipped several pieces of my French toast in it.\\n\\nWe had such a great experience at Boma and can't wait to try it out again!"},{"name":"Union Park Pizza","address":"1405 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"This new pizza shop recently opened in the old Harry O's space.

As soon as we entered , the host gladly greeted us and she seemed friendly. We then sat down and waited about 15mins for a waiter to arrive.

It took a pretty good chunk of time (20+mins) for ever order, even though it wasn't that busy. \\n\\nThe last order of drinks, my wife found a piece of aluminum foil in her cocktail. We were both surprised as to how come the server nor the bartender noticed this.

I don't mind paying for all the charges. But like myself working in hospitality, I find it disturbing that the restaurant/host/server did absolutely NOTHING to comp at least the drink that they messed up or comp a dessert. \\n\\nThis is just bad service and a bad look for the restaurant.

I went for the first time the other day and it needs work. \\n\\nPro's: front of house and waitstaff are super friendly and helpful. Cocktails are large (see below). \\n\\nCon's: The food. Almost all of it. \\n\\nUnlike other reviewers I thought the bread was good. I also had the garlic bread which was also fine, maybe better than fine. If I must nitpick, please slice through the loaf, for both the regular and garlic bread. I get the idea of \\"tearing\\" off a piece, but it ended up being a wrestling match to cut-and-pry a piece off. No big deal on regular bread but no fun in butter soaked garlic bread. \\n\\nSecond, I had a good cocktail. Arguably too big, but I'll go ahead an concede I may be the only one who might complain about this! I like them small so they stay cold. \\n\\nFinally the food. I had the calamari to begin. While I liked the crunch, the calamari tasted fishy. Really fishy. I have had a lot of calamari in my life and this was a first. I literally could not finish the small portion.  Just horrible. \\n\\nFinally, I had the chicken piccata. Now, I make this dish at home and consider it a litmus test for this type of Italian place. I have to say it was terrible. The chicken was over cooked and dry and the dish was way over sauced. It was basically a stew. Also, the breading on the chicken was way too much. Piccata should be dredged in flour and saut√©d not breaded and fried. It was pretty clear the chicken was cooked ahead of time and then sauced before serving. Doubtless they pull it from the same bin they make the chicken parm from. Finally, instead of getting pounded chicken fillets, they cut the chicken into bite sized chunks. The not only added to the \\"stew effect\\" but also gave me the distinct impression they were running low on chicken and needed to \\"stretch\\" it. The side of linguine was at best unremarkable. There is no scenario where I would order this again. \\n\\nAs a further aside, I was with my kid. He ordered spaghetti with butter. They (politely) informed him they can only do penne. No big deal, but it does seem odd that a pasta place can't sort out more than one type of pasta. They can't do the same linguine that my piccata came with? It is just off, but I suspect it is easier to keep a bucket of penne on simmer to feed kids. Fine I guess, they don't really claim to be a kid friendly place and that is a fair decision. However I think it speaks to the processes they have in the kitchen. And, not for nothing, I have aged out of quirky restaurant policies (hey at least they take credit cards at this location). \\n\\nFinally, the decor is not awesome. They did not have much to work with, but it looks a lot like the old Bertucci's. The wine lockers at the door are ridiculous. Who stores wine ten feet from the pizza oven? But hey, who am I to judge? The bar looks cozy, though. Both Tamara and The Local can organize a good cocktail, so I hope the wine list stands o\\n\\nI hate to rant and I see plenty of people love the place, so take it for what it is worth. I would be thrilled if this place works out, because Wayland needs fine dining options. Unfortunately, this is not fine dining yet. \\n\\nUpdate: Ok, so I went back, and in the interest of fairness, I had a much better meal and feel compelled to update my review. First, they offered my kids two kinds of plain pasta, so props to them for making that change. \\n\\nI ordered the Fra Diavlo with shrimp and scallops, because another reviewer enjoyed it and it was really pretty tasty. My wife had the puttanesca (easy on the jokes, folks!) which she declared \\"OK\\". So not high praise but still fine. \\n\\nOverall the second visit was much better. The service was very friendly and I had a nice glass of wine. It still does not light my fire, but I wanted to set the record straight after a better meal. It was certainly full, so others disagree.

They did charge extra when we asked for extra anchovies, but did not reduce the price when we asked for no croutons.  Seems like a fair swap to me - anchovies for croutons? The lobster ravioli was good and a large portion. The eggplant parmigiana was large but, whatever they fry the eggplant in gave it a funny aftertaste - maybe the oil was overused? The pasta that came with the meal was tiny but cooked al Dente and I liked the sauce although it was not something I will be dreaming about.  Yes - I do perserverate and dream about great sauce!  I myself worked in an amazing Italian restaurant in NYC. The eggplant should be cooked a bit more and the cheese on top melted more. It was all congealed on top and when I cut a piece of the eggplant, all of the cheese came to my fork with one bite. With a $100 tab (with tip) for 2 people with dinner in less than an hour ( one salad app shared and 2 entrees) and a lot of noise, and only one drink each, that seemed higher than expected.  Our waiter Collin, could not have been nicer and more helpful - he gets a FIVE STAR rating, but the food itself and ambiance could improve. We are picky and spoiled, but I am hoping that Giacomo's uses this feedback as they will need to do better to succeed - and I would LOVE to see this place do well. Suggestions - fresh grated cheese offered, a few olives to go with the bread or warm the bread. Wow me and I am so happy to pay more as are many locals."},{"name":"Citizen Eatery","address":"5011 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This is one of my favorite vegetarian restaurants in town.

The server warned us that she did speak good English in the beginning of the meal. She didn't explain anything about the restaurant except the temp cards. She didn't ask if we wanted the 18 meat dinner or the 22 meat dinner but we kept up with the meats we did eat, about 8 different kinds in all, which we discussed as we have all worked in restaurants, one of us a chef. The \\"sides buffet\\" is a disgusting joke, potato salad, pasta salad, beets- with steak? Lamb? \\nWe all drank water so when we were charged $160 for 3 of us, we disputed the check. The server then said, \\"Maybe you didn't know what you ate!\\" The manager came over and argued with us and then went through the video to see which meats we ate. We spent 45 minutes disputing this. Then when the manager saw that we DIDN'T eat any of the EXTRA 4 meats they charge $13 extra dollars for, he then tried to convince us to pay extra because \\"everyone gets the $42.95 meal\\" because \\"it fills you up\\". We had to repeat over and over that we wanted the correct price for the meal we actually ate instead of being convinced to pay more just because everyone else does! We were infuriated and the server continued to come over and try to belittle us like we were stupid. This place is shady, rude, and not good enough for a second visit. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. \\nThe only good thing about it was the meat. Most of it was delicious, especially the lamb. But what started out as a cool experience turned out to be a huge disappointment, a hassle, and left my party extremely angry that they tried to get one over on us.

Fortunately we were in the area. Servers are very friendly. These guys multi task like I've never seen before and friendly and accommodating all at the same time. A guy who took my order (not an Asian guy which I love btw because it's incredibly rare to have a server non Asian at an Asian resto) and he literally looked at my order list on my phone for 1 second and never missed a dish when it came out (good memory space in his brain ya think!) These guys deserve applauses. I can tell they do an outstanding job. I also notice while being there 1 waitress went on her break and ate (which was served by the resto also) shortly after that the guy goes on break (the person who served me) and he was fixing his table for himself to eat as well, food by resto, So you can really tell the owner of this resto takes care of their staffs. It's amazing to see. This is by far the most polite servers I've ever encountered coming into an Asian resto. It's not even a stereotype what's so ever, it's all experience and legit. It is rare you will come across good staffs in Asian restos who has a welcoming ambience within being fake for their tips. \\n\\nAnyways we ordered Yang zhou fried rice \\nXiao long bao steamed buns, Pan fried chicken dumplings , Mandarin orange ginger chicken, and chicken Stir fry noodle. All we're amazing and simple. To be honest probably the best soup dumplings I've had yet in Vancouver. So thumbs up to that! Not everything in life has to be fancy to taste good and this place nailed it ya. No fancy name no fancy settings no fancy aura just straight up wholesome foods. \\n\\nI found the dishes on the pricier side. But I mean it's also doable and decent. Not over priced but I mean I've had something cheaper for the same quality. Nonetheless Overall this resto is great. Staffs are welcoming, not judgemental, responsive, and accurate. Parking sucks but it's broadway so it's a given. Will come back to try other dishes. One couple beside us ordered 3 different kind of noodle dishes so it must be so good there lol!

Upon going up to the gate and asking if we could at least see the dining room from the entry, we were told that we couldn't, but we could stand outside the gate (30 or so feet from the front door) and take photos when the doors open. Keep in mind that the doors only open to let patrons in or out. ARE YOU SERIOUS?! Even a professional sports level camera would have trouble snapping a shot! This whole system of getting a reservation is so terrible. Not all people book their vacations 6+ months in advance, allowing you to get a reservation at this restaurant. They might want to think about changing this policy. \\n\\nAt least it caused us to walk a bit further down the path and into Gaston's Pub!

I was staying at AKL and I had the time to go, so I made a reservation for myself around 10:30 on the second day of my stay.  I was pretty excited.\\n\\nI should mention that I'm vegetarian, but I looked online, and there seemed to be enough for me to eat here.  The goat cheese scrambled eggs being one the things I was most looking forward to.\\n\\nI checked in right around my reservation time, and they texted me that my table was ready right away.  I had nice table with a view of a fountain outside.  My waitress asked what I wanted to drink, and I immediately ordered the jungle juice, as I'd also been looking forward to that.  That juice was by far the best part of my meal.  \\n\\nWhen I went to the buffet the first time, I tried little bits of things to see what I liked.  I got the goat cheese scrambled eggs, the regular scrambled eggs, a fruit salad, a Mickey waffle, a donut, a biscuit, and some other stuff I'm sure I'm forgetting, and I made a yogurt parfait.  The goat cheese scrambled eggs were very good, and the Mickey waffle was ok (I had actually never had one before, if you can believe that!).  The rest of it was just ok, and the biscuit was really hard on the bottom.  And the yogurt parfait was awful.  I tried the other flavor of yogurt when I went up again, and it was equally horrible.  And I eat yogurt parfaits a lot.  This yogurt was disgusting.\\n\\nWhen I went up the second time, I knew more what I wanted, so I got the goat cheese scrambled eggs, a Simba waffle this time, the vanilla sauce, and a bagel with the nutella and cream cheese on the side.  It was around this time I started to feel sick.  And it was not just a feeling of being full, but like a stomach pain that I actually haven't had before.  I ate the bagel, and that was good (but really, how do you screw up a bagel?).  I had a few bites of the Simba waffle and some of the eggs, but that was it.  I really just didn't feel well, so I couldn't and didn't want to eat anymore.\\n\\nI was back to my room by noon, and I was not able to even stand up to take a shower until 5pm that night.  I lost a half day of my 3 day trip from eating here, so it probably goes without saying, but I would not eat here again.  \\n\\nWith tip, breakfast here was almost $40.  I didn't eat anywhere near that much, and even if I hadn't gotten sick, I'm sure I couldn't have eaten that much.  If I stay at AKL again, I'd go to Mara and get a Mickey waffle or a bagel there, and save myself $32.\\n\\nBefore I got sick, I'd have only given this 3 stars.  I was pretty disappointed with it on my first visit to the buffet.  Since I got sick, I'm deducting another star.  I was pretty lucky I was staying at the hotel.  If I'd have been at another resort or in the park, I'd have been lying on a bench somewhere for a few hours.\\n\\nIf you're staying here and want to try it out, it's an average buffet for Disney I guess (assuming you aren't sick afterward), but to come out of your way if you're not staying at AKL just doesn't make sense to me.  There's not much here that you couldn't get at any other Disney buffet on property.

I'm not a huge meat eater, but I had a hard time pulling myself away from that delicious bucket of pork. The barbeque sauce was the perfect compliment to the fall off the bone ribs. The rest of the food was fine, including the strawberry shortcake dessert. Food is plentiful, so make sure to come hungry. \\n\\nThe show itself was fine. The performers were talented, and we enjoyed the jokes as well as the audience participation. \\n\\nI'm giving it four stars since the service could have been better. I'm not sure if our server was just overworked or if it was something else, but drinks took a while to be refilled. When it's all you can drink, this was a bit of a problem. I also felt that everything was a bit rushed. As soon as the show ended they hustled you out of there fairly quickly. There was another show at 6:15 so that doesn't leave much turnaround time. \\n\\nFor me, this was a one and done type of experience.

It was 2:00 when we realized they closed at 2:30. Ahhhhhh. We jumped in the car, anxiously wove through the Dogwood Festival crowds down 10th street, miraculously snatched a space in that god awful Trader Joe's parking lot, and made it into the restaurant with 9 minutes to spare. We may or may not have run a red light and sacrificed three pedestrians along the way but it was well worth it.\\n\\nI can't decide if the amount of food we ordered was impressive or horrifying. Probably both. It's almost easier to say what we didn't get vs what we did...\\n \\nBone Broth Congee ($6.50) - Solid congee, honestly probably was enough to satisfy a normal appetite for one person, but we powered through with our 15 other menu items.\\nChili Oil Wontons ($8.00) - Super flavorful, huge fan of chili oil spice. Would probably order this again.\\nFried Pig Ears ($4.50) - Fried and seasoned to perfection, this was my favorite dish out of everything. We got this on Saturday and it was 90% of the reason I wanted to go back the next day. \\nPickled Vegetables ($3.00) - Came with radish, carrots, and cucumbers, probably not worth $3 but a nice mini banchan before everything else arrived.\\n2 Pork Belly Bao ($4.50 each) - Must order menu item. Never had buns so soft, they're like a baby's bottom. Good chunk of pork belly in the middle but each order only comes with one so obviously I wish the portions were a little bigger.\\nVeggie Bao ($4.50) - Decent but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. Mostly just ordered to make ourselves feel better for not ordering 100% meat. \\nBeef Tendon Soup ($13.00) - Super tender beef and flavorful broth. Usually one of my go-to's here. \\nBraised Oxtail ($17.00) - One of the top dishes, a little pricey but the meat was sooo freakin good.\\n\\nI think the servers were pretty cool dealing with two out of breath Asians running into the restaurant minutes before they close, ordering half the menu, and then gorging ourselves until there weren't any leftovers to take home. I wonder if they were afraid we were well dressed homeless people who were planning to dine and dash. But that would never happen because we were way too full to carry our bodies at any speed faster than a hobble out of that restaurant. It really put a new meaning to the walk of shame. \\n\\nDefinitely way pricier than Buford Highway, but the food has been consistently good and the convenience in Midtown is hard to beat.

We decided to sit in the west wing and were excited to see some folks leaving a 2 person table. We walked over to it and waited for it to be cleared. And waited. And waited.

It is so refreshing to have food cooked to order and served with such earnestness and pride.  My personal, hands down favorite meal is the chicken shawarma over the best hommos on planet earth.  I get so excited that over-ordering has become standard and I leave with as much as I've already eaten!  The owner and the server are warm and wonderful people and want to please each customer.  On the nights that fresh spinach pies are made, I try to snag a couple dozen for our freezer.  Call me crazy but, I love them for breakfast.  Also, the pitas....hot chunks dunked in hommos.  The homemade salad dressing is delish and, I wish they sold it.  There is something about the fattoush that is so special but, I can't put my finger on it.  The serving is very large and could actually be a lunch, with a side of pita.  It is definitely a shareable-sized salad.  Hubby is a fan of the shish-kabab, rare, and the beef shawarma over rice.  He also likes the baklava for the perfect ending to the perfect meal.  I'm not much of a dessert person but, the rice pudding (a special) was lovely.  Selfishly, I'm glad that the restaurant is never crowded.  It's in a shabby little strip and easy to miss.  Perhaps that's what makes it so special.....quiet and simple.

Not too crowded, I suspect partly because Chamblee's doing some construction on the street right in front of them and partly because of their recent move. Take advantage of this lull. The service was excellent (wish I'd gotten the server's name) The food arrived quickly and hot. We were consulted as to the heat level we preferred and the food was cooked to our preference. First off was the best Shrimp Puri I've ever had ($10). My partner and I each ordered a different item off the lunch specials. Curry Shrimp and Meat Birahni (sp?). The special comes with soup, nann, beverage and desert. It's an amazing deal priced at $12 and $10. We're older gals so we don't usually eat much at one time so by the time we finished our shrimp puri and soup we were already feeling sufficiently full. After tasting our entrees (which were generous) we asked the server for boxes. Quickly they were supplied, no attitude. All of the flavours were bright and clean and delicious.

It's definitely more of a bar scene than a restaurant, but due to ease of access we went with it. I didn't realize that the menu is strictly BBQ (with a couple burritos thrown in) and as I'm not a fan of BBQ, it wasn't up my alley. That said, I went ahead and ordered the BBQ chicken with sides of mac and cheese and cole slaw. The BBQ chicken was pulled (I didn't notice that - thought I was going to get chicken breast) and very spicy. The mac and cheese had that congealed look suggesting it was pre-plated on the service line and sitting under heat lamps until called for. The flavor was actually really good, but it's not appetizing to see a congealed, dried out topper on a side dish. The cole slaw was kind of bland - not enough dressing. Again, taste was there but just missed the mark. JT ordered a brisket sandwich, he got a brisket dinner. The waitress was apologetic and offered to get him a bun, which he declined. Speaking of the waitress, she was cheerful and we had no complaints about her customer service. There were a couple little mistakes (the brisket and dropping off the check, but there was no check inside the folder) but her manner made up for that.\\n\\nThe two stars aren't reflective of anything more than my lack of desire to return based on a very restricted BBQ menu and the loud bar scene."},{"name":"Caribe Fusion","address":"43750 US-27","city":"Davenport","stars":"4.5","text":"I tried this place out last night while it was parked outside Pocock Brewery in Valencia and it was great!

The \\"Saut√©ed Shrimp and Scallops with Lobster, Mushrooms, and Seasonal Vegetables in a creamy Lobster Sauce\\", we thought it was a big fancy seafood dish, however it was actually a pasta dish!

I will be honest and say that The House has many nice aspects but there were a few \\"hiccups\\" which initially sabotaged a potentially quiet and intimate evening.\\n\\nMoey made a rez for a quiet table by the window. The friendly hostess escorted us to our \\"quiet table by the window\\" which was by the window but only one seat faced the window. The tables should be set up so the seats are parallel and aside to the windows so both diners are adjacent the window. Secondly the table was right near the metal kitchen doors. The dim lighting and mellow ambiance was completely destroyed by the nearby doors, abruptly and noisily, constantly swinging open with the bright kitchen lights glaring on us like passing cars with headlights. This kind of seating situation is unacceptable for an expensive restaurant -or any restaurant for that matter. Please put up a partition or better yet eliminate these tables. Additionally, inane music was playing much too loudly.\\n\\nWe moved our location to a better table, we thought. I sat down and put my water on the table and whoa! It was a case of tippy table syndrome -all lopsided and wicked wobbly. I grabbed a plate off an empty table and rectified the situation by positioning the plate under the base. \\n\\nOther than these SNAFUs, everything else was fine. We kicked it off with the Coconut Shrimp which was presented in a highly festivus way with a rice paper-like Oriental tortilla bowl with fried sprouts or something in a haystack-like pile. The shrimp were butterflied and freshly cooked and wicked hot and good.\\n\\nWe each got the Lobster Stuffed Boston Scrod. Pricey at 36 bucks each. It was very filling even though it was a fairly teeny amount of lobster (CORRECTION: make that just plain teeny) and fish but it was heavily buttered and stuffed with a stuffing-type stuff. The mashed taters were good when used in sopping up the \\"run-off' from the fish/lobster. Two asparagus sprouts were placed in an \\"X\\" pattern on top of the taters. This was a simple dish but very tasty and I can see out-of-towners going mental over this as a key part of their \\"Boston experience.\\"\\n\\nThe waitress was good. Pretty casual though.

I'm from Northwest Ohio originally. Toledo, specifically. Sylvania, if you're one of those types that strives for fact-checking accuracy. \\n\\nWhy do I bring this up? Because Villa Nova, alongside perhaps one or two other notable locations in Central Ohio, is emblematic of what I critically define as \\"Toledo\\" style dining. This is more of an aesthetic observation than something that can intrinsically translate to a graded spectrum of good and bad. It simply is. An immutable fact tethered more to character and context than cuisine. \\n\\nLet me explain.\\n\\nThe entire area is decorated with art and kitchen kitsch.  An entire room is covered in beautiful copper kettles and other colorful interior accouterments that run the gambit from traditional brushwork to countless clocks, compasses and crazy rustic collections of antiques. It's interior design statement is metaphorically loud to the point of being cacophonous. \\n\\nA lot of places in Toledo are designed for folks getting home from the factory floor, and even professionals wanting a relaxing and reliable place to hang their hat. It needs to be warm and approachable. It needs to be intimate yet not prison-like. The front of house needs to be down to earth, but still professional. The food needs to be flavorful, but not unapproachable. A rust-belt belly needs to be filled, not talked down to. \\n\\nVilla Nova checks all of these boxes with a home-brewed sense of identity and flair endemic of any Italian restaurant worth it's salt and pepper. \\n\\nI love this place. \\n\\nThere is no signature dish or loud note here. It's subs. It's salads. It's plates of warm and delicious gnocchi covered in house sauce and cheese rubbing elbows with bottomless bushels of bread sticks. Nigh-brick sized wedges of lasagna are slung about next to appetizers that run the gambit from the familiar to the unique. As to the latter, the \\"hodge podge,\\" an un-apologetically strange combination of breaded mushrooms, zucchini, cauliflower, and onion rings served with ranch dressing is my consistent favorite at every visit. \\n\\nI almost inexorably loosen my belt and order the sampler plate, with is effectively Villa' Nova's take on the \\"Tour of Italy,\\" as it includes all the usual Italian heavy-hitters: Pasta, Lasagna, Gnocchi, etc. You'll have to roll me out of the restaurant by the end of the night, but it's totally worth it every single time.\\n\\nI mean, they even have paper placements that talk about the history of various parts of Italy. I don't think you can even eat like this anymore outside of maybe a Denny's or a Waffle House. I grew up eating on paper place-mats. I miss it. It reminds me of home, but it's more than that. It reminds me of home when I was a kid. Who doesn't like that sensation? Who doesn't crave that feeling and wish to experience it at any given opportunity?\\n\\nI love this place.\\n\\nAnd I haven't even gotten to the bar side of the restaurant yet.\\n\\nThe bar is a great little neighborhood watering hole that embodies the spirit of the dive bar but none of its negative connotations. It is dark. It is atmospheric. It is full of hilarious regulars full of sardonic attitude and witty senses of humor. The beer is cold. The drinks are nice. The prices are reasonable. \\n\\nI offer only one word of warning: this place is definitely part of the Worthington/Clintonville High Street corridor, and even Villa Nova's comparative plethora of parking spots fills up quickly on Buckeye game nights and busy weekend evenings. I suggest hitting them up for brunch or on weeknights if you want to really get the most bang for your buck from the kitchen as well as a short walk from your car. Side street parking spots are plentiful, however, so this isn't as large a concern as I make it out to be. I'm just lazy. \\n\\nBut if and when I'm craving Italian comfort food coupled with nostalgic homesickness, I head over here to take care of both in one (or more) plate of meat, sauce, and noodles.\\n\\nHave I mentioned I love this place?"},{"name":"The Locus","address":"4121 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Thank you, Locus, for being one of a very few restaurant/lounges that could accommodate my party of 17 on a Friday night.

Given that I'm not a huge fan of the whole communal seating concept, dining during the slower times suits me best here.  One time, I sat at the bar and was able to enjoy eating lunch with plenty of elbow room and a friendly barkeep.  Odd that bar seating, which by its very nature is communal, does not bother me the way communal table seating does.\\n\\nMy first time here, it was the soup that made me want to go back so quickly.  Chilled roasted red pepper soup with a small float of olive oil, tiny chopped chives, and some dollops of mashed avocado that had the very occasional most delicate shavings of fleur de sel that were little mouth flavor bombs.  When I would find one and bite down on the salty goodness, it mixed with the smooth avocado and the sweet and smoky soup. Yeah, serious O face.\\n\\nI enjoyed their pesto grilled cheese sandwich with the soup that day.  While it was indeed a wonderful sandwich, I had a nagging voice at the back of my head that kept saying, \\"This is grilled cheese, and it's $9.00.\\"  Given the price, I don't think I could order it again.

I can't believe how long we waited to get served, while so many of you were standing around chatting with each other.  \\n\\n2. Your local beer selection is weak.  Having 100 beers is worthless is there aren't any good beers.  You have 15-20 IPAs and few, if any, good ones.  With all of the great microbrews in Austin, why do you have none of them?  Perhaps your purchasing is done out of Dallas.\\n\\n3. Prices are a bit steep.

I'm sure someone loves Pat Benetar, but I am pretty sure that it's a pretty select set of people.\\n\\nI can't fault them for trying to bring their formulaic chain restaurant to Austin, but the first rule is to understand your market.

He stated this confusion of locations is the reason they make you pay over the phone before you get your food. To me, this is absolutely terrible custom service. You will not refund my order and it's obvious you will be able to sell the large cheese pizza and pepperoni pizza to another order or as single slices. The food will NOT be wasted and you will make money. However, I will still be out $29 and not happy. I even told this man I would be writing a negative review and he did not care at all. In better news, Bravo Pizzeria in Quincy quickly made our order and let us know they deal with the same but refund the orders.

From the beginning of driving into the quiet and serene entrance of Animal Kingdom Lodge, I knew we were going to have a great meal and experience. The evening started out with us being escorted to our table and were given hot rose -scented hand towels to clean our hands, and a small glass of an Africa tea. Our waitress was very nice and knowledgeable, and told us all about her country of Morocco. We had the Taste of Africa for an appetizer. In combination with the sweet potato rolls, it was the perfect amount of food for 4 people to start. We each ordered something different to our likings, and all of what we ordered hit the spot to a tee. I definitely would come here again, and will absolutely be staying in the Animal Kingdom Lodge when I return to Disney again. The staff was kind and helpful, and the ambience was quiet and calming. I only gave 4/5 because the salad portion of the watermelon and pear salad was about the portion a medium sized rabbit would eat as a snack, so that is my only complaint. Nevertheless, it was still delicious! One person at my table ordered the Elk flatbread as a meal and it was divine - 5 stars to the chef who created this!

Other spots have been reborn as public businesses, many of them breweries. One of the newest (as of this writing) polished cobblestones is Wayfinder Beer. There's absolutely everything to like about these guys.\\n\\nYou come up 2nd Avenue and, if you don't know the neighborhood well, you might not even realize there's about to be a nice patio and taproom on the side of the street. They've fenced themselves off from the road with full panel fencing, so all you see is wood (and, well, a huge sign announcing the brewery).\\n\\nYou walk up the ramps and staircase, all made from the same planking as the fence, and find a host station. They gate/waitlist the patio seating, which they'd be insane not to do during nice weather. It fills up early. It feels almost like a party at somebody's house; it's just closed off enough to feel private, even though it's drenched in sunlight. Only possible drag is that they do not allow pets, or else it really would feel like a house party. \\n\\nInside there are beautiful old bricks, a long dark wood bar with stools, and seating here and there. All very tidy and welcoming, even homey--just like the patio, they come very close to making it feel like you've been welcome into someone's home. \\n\\nThey have a full bar, with a variety of interesting cocktails and a few options for the wine drinker. The staff hustle the whole time they're at the bar, constantly mixing and pouring. \\n\\n6 of us came in for the beer. We all knew the long and notable pedigree of the brewhouse staff here--lots of big awards during stints at very accomplished breweries. They're already stacking up shiny medals here at Wayfinder, which surprises no one who has tried their beers (here or elsewhere). \\n\\nDuring our visit, they were pouring a nice lineup of classic continental lager styles, a few different IPAs and pales, a couple of interesting Belgians, and kegs from guest breweries and cideries. We tried almost every house beer, and they're uniformly excellent. \\n\\nThese guys seem to stay away from crazy beers with tea and doughnuts and other startling ingredients--they focus on making clean, balanced, flavorful beers that you can drink over and over again. There are plenty of breweries aiming to get you to take one sip and yell \\"oh my god, this is insane, I can't believe they got all these things to work together!\\" These guys are aiming to make you want to drink their beers over and over because you just keep enjoying every drop. I personally think that even if you do love beers made with doughtnuts and weird fruit and chewing gum and whatnot, you'll like these beers, too. You'll just have to be ready for a \\"simpler\\" and more straightforward beer. \\n\\nThey have a variety of glassware suited to different classic styles, and you order by liter (they give you a rough idea of how many ounces are in each pour). The classicist approach is really soothing, and makes you realize how hard they've worked to get their beers exactly like they want them, and serve them in the way that showcases them most effectively. \\n\\nIn the end, a couple of us walked out saying we'd be back every time we're in Portland, and a couple said they'd be happy to tag along for that. We'll be back again and again."},{"name":"Dicarlo's Pizza - Hilliard","address":"4142 Main St","city":"Hilliard","stars":"3.5","text":"Huge improvements to the quality in a year.

Located in the Italy pavilion, this restaurant transports you straight to Italy with the decor, music, and even the waiters/ waitresses. Make sure to check out the three big pizza ovens-- super cute! We ordered the Mezzo Metro Buffalo Mozzarella Margherita and wow was it good. It was $57 (pre tax & tip) and I would NEVER pay this much for this pizza elsewhere, but it's Disney property so you gotta take what you can get. We were disappointed in the sparse ingredients (esp. given the price point), and we felt we largely just forked over a bunch of cash for some saucy bread-- we legitimately had 4 pieces of basil (I mean, come on). But grievances about the toppings aside, the pizza is really really tasty. It's Neopolitan style, so don't expect a crisp-bottomed slice-- its pretty soggy but really good. We shared this pizza with 4 people, and each had three small rectangular slices. It was satisfying enough, but we were starving so we could have had more. Even though this pizza is big, if you're hungry, order 2 or share it with at most 3 people. \\n\\nAside from the food, the service is really wonderful! We did wait a while for our pizza to cook, but again it's Disney & long waits are to be expected. The servers, hosts, and all the people that dropped by our table to refill our water were extremely friendly and looked happy to be there. Enjoyable experience overall if you can get in.

Even though the owner is from Hyderabad, India in south of India, he is from the Muslim community so the meat dishes and breads are all northern style. Very clean space and freshest ingredients. The naan is baked perfectly. The Nihari has a generous amount of meat and the meat is cooked till it melts in your mouth. This is a counter service cafeteria. All the dishware is disposable. Everything is ala carte so you need to order dishes with rice. Naan is sold by the slice. Authentic food and pure Hyderabadi Indian taste.\\n\\nThe place though gets crowded with people and you have to stand behind people to get seated.

Your food is SO GOOD. But your service needs some serious polishing. We left full and happy with the food, but the service left quite a sour taste for our party. I am grateful for the lovely patio hostess for letting us know we could sit outside and there was no wait. That began our meal with great service but it was really downhill from there. Our server (Jennifer) really seemed frazzled. Possibly of no fault of her own due to the Tall Ships being in Boston and the place being busy - but we got no silverware or napkins, I had to get them myself from the server station since there seemed to be no one around when our appetizers came. One person in my party got the crab legs, asked for shell crackers twice and they never came, luckily he is versed in crab leg eating and was able to figure out a way to get the meat out - but basic knowledge would have been to provide that tool to your diners. The food was amazing and was the shining star of the meal, luckily the food was good or this review would be pretty bad. But the glaringly bad point of the meal came when the check arrived. We gave her some cash and a card - and instructed her to place \\"X\\" amount on the card and then use \\"X\\" amount of cash. She returned with the card - yet no change from our cash (which there would have been). The server has seemingly assumed the change was going to be her tip and walked away. Not until we confronted her about the change did she tell us \\"I did not assume the gratuity\\" - well then why did you not give us our change? What were you doing with that then? That was the bad taste that the Chart House left in my mouth - busy day, slow service - fine - but blatantly not giving me change back, then saying you were not assuming you tip just was the nail in the coffin. Sorry Chart House but if you wanna roll with the big names and better places in the area, that kind of behavior from a server really doesn't make me want to return. Someone in my party did speak with the manager (Jerry?

Their menu clearly delineates a middle section for hot sandwiches. It doesn't, however, tell you anything about what you can get on your sandwich - no list of veggies, no list of meats, what you order will be a total mystery. With rare few exceptions, I think the very concept of a hot sandwich is repugnant, let alone a hot sub. I ordered a roast beef sandwich to go, got it, and drove off. As I was driving, I noticed that my sandwich smelled exceptionally strong. Not bad, just strong. I had a hunch and, at a stop light, checked it out. The sandwich I'd ordered, not from the hot sandwich menu, was hot. There was lettuce on my sandwich that was going to be a wilted mess by the time I got home. I had mayo on the sandwich, for crying out loud. I called their customer service and was told that, like I'm supposed to be psychic and know this, all their sandwiches are hot.\\n\\nThere is a specific section of the menu for hot sandwiches. Why would they do this if ALL the sandwiches are hot?\\n\\nI took a bite out of the sandwich when I got to my destination, just because I don't like to waste food, and it was just as I suspected - the entire sandwich was a hot, limp, disgusting mess. I threw the remainder out because I couldn't bring myself to eat the rest of this garbage.\\n\\nTheir ingredients are bad, their corporate customer service is bad, their menu is a confusing lie... \\n\\nDo not eat here.

I didn't particularly care myself, but just something to keep in mind.\\n\\nI ordered the dumpling soonbudu, my boyfriend the beef soondubu, and my friends got soondubu along with a katsu of some sort. The banchan (small dishes) were okay. There was an egg dish that was quite good, the bean sprouts were marinated well, but nothing particularly blew me away. I don't judge tofu houses by their banchan though, since I don't even like kimchi so I miss out on half the experience here.\\n\\nWhat I do care about, is the quality of the soondubu. I like to put my rice into my soondubu and let it soak up the flavor. It's a huge issue for me when there isn't enough soup in the soondubu, since it can leave the dish a bit dry. This is exactly what happened at Kaju. I could already tell this would happen just looking at the dish, so opted to eat my rice by dipping it into the soondubu instead. The tofu itself was okay, but the dumplings were a bit bland. Not too flavorful, and not too memorable. The medium spicy worked for me, which I do appreciate, since I'm normally sweating bullets at the end of a bowl of medium soondubu at BCD.\\n\\nOverall the meal was okay, but BCD is just a little bit more expensive and the quality is much, much better.

In the first 5 minutes we realized we had a waiter who seemed very new, so we tried to stay as patient as we could, which I think we did a great job doing. We did our order in a very odd way and then our meals took way too long to come out (almost an hour). We ordered 2 individual sized pizzas (which apparently come out of their own kitchen), a cannelloni and 2 lasagnas. We didn't mind taking a break from the heat and catching up together, but towards the end of our wait, we started to wonder when our food would arrive. We noticed that the tables around us were having problems, either with their bills, food or the waiter, but we continued waiting patiently. Our food was delicious, which was why we had come back to this restaurant! At the end of our meal and dessert (which was also delicious), we waited quite some time for our bills, and by quite some time I mean over a half an hour. The waiter kept apologizing as he had issues with another table while we were neglected. We also watched a big huddle of managers talking nearby while we sat and waited endlessly. Once we thought our bill was taken care of, he ran after us saying we needed to sign different copies. He took another 10 minutes to get these copies together and was clearly very flustered. A manager stood over his shoulder but didn't offer her help and then tried to ignore us when we confronted her about the almost 2 1/2 hour meal we had just had. I expect a place like this to support their staff better and to provide better training than this poor waiter had. The restaurant ended up comping us some extra fast passes for the inconvenience, but it was disappointing that such a delicious meal was paired with such horrendous service."},{"name":"Fresh To Order","address":"860 Peachtree St NE, Ste B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Stopped in for light lunch midday and thoroughly enjoyed my meal.

Our table ordered dumplings to share and I made our server aware of my severe shellfish allergy.

I happened to be the first to taste the dish and it was only upon biting into the shrimp dumpling that I realized the catastrophic mistake.  Thanks to Northside Hospital's emergency team, I was treated quickly enough to make a successful recovery.  I hope the next person with an allergy that eats here is able to say the same.  \\n\\nIt's also worth noting that we notified the server during the incident and have even contacted the restaurant since.  (Perhaps to your surprise, I contacted the restaurant not to express anger, but to express a concern for future patrons; I wanted to make sure a Manager was made aware so the staff could benefit from some sort of refresher training, etc.  Pay-it-forward so to speak.  I was told I was actually speaking with the owner when I called.)

It replaced Shabu Ya but the quality of the food and service was alright. The restaurant doesn't take reservations - it's a first come first serve type of restaurant. It's less busy during lunch. \\n\\nYesterday, my brother and I came here for lunch. We ordered the following:\\n1. Toro Scallion Maki \\n2. Veggie and Beef Clay Pot\\n3. Tofu and Spicy Pork Soup\\n\\nAfter ordering, our server brought out small Korean style tapas - beans in sweet sauce (not fully cooked, chewy, sticky), sweet egg, sweet egg yolk mashed potato with carrots and raisins, cooked soybeans, Zucchini in spicy sauce, picked carrots and radish, and kimchi. I was disappointed that there wasn't a potato-carrot dish but I guess these small tapas vary by availability.\\n\\nIn the Toro Scallion Maki, you will find six small rolls filled with rice, high quality toro and scallion and wrapped with seaweed. It was served with pickled ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce on the side. I think it was a bit pricey for six bite-size rolls. \\n\\nThe Veggie and Beef Clay Pot consisted of rice, assorted seasoned vegetables (e.g., carrots, spinach, zucchini, soybeans, broccoli, radish, and black mushrooms), marinated beef (very tender), raw egg (yolk only), and garnished with dried seaweed strips.

Despite Bergstrom getting quite a few new food joints inside the main terminal, many of the eateries still have that \\"this was made in an airport with low quality / fast food ingredients\\" taste despite being labeled that of popular local spots around time.\\n\\nFortunately, The Peached Tortilla is one of those local joints that is able to maintain some level of quality despite being locked behind those ironclad TSA checkpoints. I've tried every one of their tacos and they're all great. They don't leave your mouth with a weird greasy feeling that many other airport food stops have and for the most part they execute well on the Asian fusion flavor that'd you expect from Bulgogi, pork belly, or Korean steak.\\n\\n$4 per taco is pretty par for the course and they honestly load the tacos relatively well. 2 tacos for breakfast / light meal, 3 if you're really hungry = getting a meal at the airport for $8 - 12 which is more than reasonable (and if anything, comparable to eating outside of the airport in Austin now). My only gripe is that some of their meats are just a tad too salty, and their overall options could be a little more expansive but it's something I can easily live with especially considering there aren't too many comparable places within those limited gates. Though to be fair, they did just open a massive new section in the main terminal at AUS so there could be some strong new eateries opening soon!\\n\\nRegardless, The Peached Tortilla will always be one of my go-to spots if I need to grab a quick bite before flying out; you should make sure to do the same!"},{"name":"Via Napoli","address":"EPCOT World Showcase - Italian Pavilion, 1510 Avenue of the Stars","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"I had read about Via Napoli on Yelp and was excited to give it a try for myself.

First, what I loved about the place was the service. Our waiter Fabrizio was so kind and really friendly. He answered all our questions and made sure we were taken care of. We ordered the Contadino salad and a Margherita Pizza. The salad + the 1/2 meter pizza fed our group of 4 adults and one child and we all left satisfied.

It's a classic, it's Disney at it's best, all that jazz. But somehow we never grabbed one of the coveted reservations, never wanted to devote the time to trekking over to Fort Wilderness. A few months ago, the stars aligned and I was able to grab a last-minute reservation for the 8:30 show and finally got to see what all the fuss was about...\\n\\nIt was good! The food was plentiful and tasty (not out of this world, but fine), the show was entertaining and impressive, the atmosphere was fun and fetive. It was a lot of fun, and we were glad we went. In my opinion, it fell a bit short of legendary \\"OMG you absolutely have to go\\" status, but I can see why others might really love it. There are plenty of places to read a comprehensive review of the whole show, so I'll mention some of the things that stood out to me:\\n\\n- Getting to Fort Wilderness is a real pain, especially if you aren't taking Disney transportation. The property is very dark and kind of hard to navigate, and the bus ride over to Pioneer Hall (where the show happens) is pretty long. It just felt like a slog to get over there and then the process of getting checked in was a bit chaotic. I don't think there is any way to avoid this, though I guess it becomes easier after that first visit.\\n- Second tier seating is perfect. I can't see paying the premium for Tier 1 (our table was in the dead center of the room, perfect view) and Tier 3 feels like a real compromise (all of the seats face the wall, you have to turn your chair around to watch the show).\\n-The food is fine -- it wasn't quite as tasty as Whispering Canyon Cafe (though the menu is similar), but you won't be hungry. The alcoholic bevvies make it a better value if you care to imbibe.\\n-The show is good, though a bit uneven. The second half was the strongest -- I described it as Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story: Davy Crockett edition (shout out to Hamilton fans!). There is an audience participation element, but you don't need to worry about being dragged up against your will\\n-It's expensive; not unexpected at Disney, but still worth considering before you pull the trigger\\n\\nDefinitely glad I went and will be happy to go again if the opportunity presents itself in the next twenty years or so :)"},{"name":"Canton Buddha","address":"2900 Peachtree Rd NW, Ste 115","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I used my UberEats app to finally try this place out.

It also came with a side of what they called \\"seasonal fruit\\" which was basically just a cup of grocery store cantaloupe. They also bring out a plate of croissants and muffins as if they're elevating your culinary experience. But the croissants and muffins were awful. I've literally had better muffins from a 7-Eleven.

I've only sampled the fast casual fare (I have a dinner reservation on November 19th), but thus far I'm definitely impressed. Disney is veering away from their stereotypical Quick Service Restaurants (QSR) by offering diverse food choices and a different style of service. \\n\\nWhen you enter the restaurant, you turn right down the hallway of suits of armor, just like Belle when Cogsworth brings her on a tour of the enchanted castle. If you listen closely you can hear them whisper about the master not being happy about the presence of humans. Next, a hostess gives each party a \\"red rose,\\" and assigns the Guest a station depending on how you are paying.  At the station, you tap your rose, order your meal, pay and then find a table in one of the three rooms (the ballroom, the West Wing, and the Rose Gallery. \\n\\nOnce you select your table, you place the rose in the center and your food \\"magically\\" appears!  Think of a dining experience like Pei Wei, but you don't have a number on display. Instead, the rose has RFID technology that alerts the Cast Members which table you are seated at - pretty cool.  Now that your rose is \\"registered\\" to a table, collect your drinks from the self service stations and then pick up your silverware (you read that right, actual silverware, not plasticware!)

No sense in putting on pounds for subpar dessert. I'd suggest getting red bean desserts at a Chinese bakery or at a good dim sum place. I suppose a good rule to go by would be to see which goods are in abundance later in the day - if they haven't sold many they must not be that great!

The class was very informative providing information about the history of different cocktails, the chemistry behind a cocktail and most importantly how to mix cocktails.  They highlighted some great classic cocktails as well was their own twists on originals.  Throughout the evening you get to taste a variety of cocktails prepared by the instructors and by the other students in the class.  Dave and Geoff were great with all the students wanting to learn how to make their own favorite cocktails.  It was a great way to spend an evening enjoying a drink, meeting new people and expanding your knowledge.  I highly recommend this to anyone interested in learning more about cocktails.  There are also a few small restaurants along Union Street that would be a perfect place to enjoy dinner prior to the class."},{"name":"62 Restaurant and Wine Bar","address":"Pickering Wharf, 62 Wharf St","city":"Salem","stars":"4.5","text":"Came here for dinner this evening and really enjoyed myself.  We arrived an hour early for our reservation but they were able to accommodate us even though they were super busy.  After walking around Salem all afternoon getting scared by all sorts of creatures/murderers/zombies, this gave them some bonus points right off the bat.\\n\\nWe basically tried their entire small plate selection:\\n\\nFried Brussels Sprouts - these were my favorite.  I'm kind of a brussels sprouts connoisseur .. and these ones were absolutely amazing.  They were cooked perfectly with pancetta, capers, red wine agrodolce & ricotta salata. YUM.\\n\\nDeep Fried Chickpea Fritters with Date Compote - I was really excited for these, and then pretty let down.  When I think of a fritter I think of a round fried batter ball full of deliciousness and these just weren't that.  The date compote was essentially a sweet jam that went ok with the fritters but it wasn't amazing. The overall flavor was good but the consistency and presentation could be improved.\\n\\nRicotta and Figs - This was another favorite.  Served with aged balsamic vinegar over grilled ciabbata.. highly recommend. \\n\\nLamb Sausage - This was great.  The sausage was grilled and looked more like a home-made burger than your typical sausage,  the whipped feta and chickpeas went perfectly with the meat.\\n\\nBraised Pork Belly - meh, wasn't that good. It was served over a bed of cabbage that was drenched in vinegar. \\n\\nOverall ambiance and service was great. At first it took our waitress a little while to come over and greet us but she made up for it by taking one of our small plates off of the bill :)"},{"name":"Beulahland","address":"118 NE 28th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"4.5 stars. A perfect example of a local Portland place thriving without a vibe of pretension and chrome-plated hardwood gloss - just don't call it a dive bar. \\n  Rotating taplist of a handful of craft brews as well as a cooler full of your tallboy treats will quench your thirst at a fairly decent price. Take a gander at the special, written on the wall next to the kitchen, or pick something from the creative but simple menu. \\n  This place has several different personalities, depending on when you visit. During the daytime, you can crawl in for a cup o' coffee and some breakfast grub to soak up the leftover booze autofermenting in your stomach (stop eating gummy bears when you're drunk!). The lunch crowd, such as it is, comes and goes, leaving the long-term residents to get back to finishing that novel (c'mon, dude...we know you're just scanning facebook and craigslist missed connections ads) and getting another hit of coffee. Dinner can be boisterous affair, with the narrow seating areas giving a cozy vibe under dim lighting as a younger crowd meets up for some caloric intake and socializing. \\n  Then there's the Blazer's games, with screens on two sides of the bar showing the game. You can still find a seat not directly in the line of fire, as the central section doesn't have a TV, but you won't miss the fact that there's a game going on as Portland fans are quite passionate(duh). Friday and Saturday nights are also pretty popular, a nice coming and going as they transit the neighborhood's many bars. I'd class the average customer as either an older punk style or younger 'hipster' style, but it's really just a healthy mix representing the various neighboorhoods around it. \\n  ..as for the 'dive' feel, well, the floors are raw concrete in some places, and the bathrooms aren't exactly modern. If you take a wrong turn on the way to the bathrooms you might end up in a small patio area used for smoking meat (probably) and empty kegs. This was not the bathroom. I wouldn't say 'dirty' but, given the low lighting throughout the building, and the odd assortment of fixtures and decorations, it's not a 5-star affair on the questionable state of cleanliness in other parts of the building. \\n It wins as a local bar, dive or not, and if you find yourself in this area I'd consider it for a relaxing meal or even a place to come and get some work done on a lazy afternoon or whatever."},{"name":"Isshindo Ramen","address":"1 Brighton Ave, Ste 16","city":"Allston","stars":"4.5","text":"Isshindo Ramen is a pretty solid ramen spot - and a great value when compared to other Boston ramen.

We asked if they could add something to the broth to lower the spicy/pepper flavor (Not sure how to describe it) and they added some chicken stock and then we added some soy sauce to our own bowls and that helped to. \\n\\nThe service here was top notch, someone was always checking on us and made sure we always had what we needed.

We purchased the Candlelight Package so after our dinner we could walk over and have preferred seating at the Processional.  Our reservation was for 5:30.  We were seated within 10 minutes at a table that was almost in the middle of all the dining traffic.  I asked if another table was available but was told \\"no\\" - even though there were several empty ones around us.  Ok - we'll take the table.\\n\\nWe met our server who was very nice and he asked about food allergies - my fiancee has a gluten allergy.  She was given a different menu and ordered a salad and I ordered shrimp scampi as an appetizer.  Roughly 40 minutes later a manager comes over and tells us they have run out of her salad and she would need to select something else.  Really??  It took 40 minutes to find this out?  So, she orders her second choice and in the mean time they bring my shrimp scampi - 4 (yes thats right!) 4 shrimp on a plate with a wedge of lemon.  She still has no food in front of her.\\n\\nEventually her salad is brought out and we finish the appetizers.  Its now going on 7:15 and we are supposed to be in line for the Candlelight Processional a half an hour before the show at 8:15.  I indicate to the manager that we have tickets to the 8:15 show and he says he understands and will rush our food through.  We have seen three other guests here seated and leaving before we get our food.  \\n\\nThe entrees are brought out - the food is ok - her pasta is under cooked but we eat because we have to get moving.  Desert was included with this package but because of how late they were with the food and service being so slow we had to forgo it.\\n\\nI asked a manager about maybe comping part of the check or doing something for us because the service had been so poor and we didnt even get the whole meal we paid for - but they did absolutely nothing.\\n\\nI pay the check $162 (for two of us).  I walk back to the register to get our passes for the special seating and of course there is no one at the counter.  By this time its a few minutes after 8:00 - again show starts at 8:15.  I finally grab a cashier from another line and he gives us our passes telling us we need to be in line 30 minutes before the show - its like 8:05 now!\\n\\nNeedless to say - we run over to where the Candlelight Processional is and of course wind up being dead last in line and pretty much being seated with the same people that just stood in line without paying for anything.\\n\\nSo - No, I would not eat here again and I would not recommend it.

This is a dive bar. I am not expecting the best food and best service of my life. But a little etiquette and some (just the teeniest tiniest bit) of class would have been nice in this situation. No one likes to deal with sending food back to the kitchen. Not the person who ordered it. Not the person who served it. And not the person who made it. It's always awkward. I'm usually the one who just eats around what he doesn't like or picks that random item that doesn't belong out. I ordered the mac and cheese which is simply described as \\"our homemade version of the classic\\". What they fail to mention in this description is that their version includes copious amounts of raw onion stirred in. Some of you may be thinking, man that sounds awesome. But for an individual who goes out of his way to avoid onions at any cost, it was an unwelcome surprise. I politely asked the server if I could send it back for an order without the onion. I literally had taken one bite out of the mac. I had eaten the side of roasted carrots (which were good, btw). When my fresh order came out, the mac and cheese sans onion was pretty decent. I thought everything turned out fine in the end until I asked for my bill. The bill came out with both orders of mac and cheese still on it. My friend encouraged me to say something; surely it had been a mistake. The server glared at me angrily and said, \\"oh you thought I would take the first order off?\\" To which I responded, quite incredulously, \\"well yeah.. I did think that.\\" She stared awkwardly for a few moments before mumbling 'oh well fine, ok.\\" She took my card and the check back with her. When she returned with my receipt she, deciding she needed to try to school me on the issue, informed me that 'you know, we don't normally take things off the bill like that.' I looked at her stunned. 'Are you serious?' I responded. 'Well yeah. We only take it off the bill if it was our mistake.' So I, visibly angry at this point, just said ... 'you know what, if you want to say it's not your mistake you should probably mention on the menu that your mac has onions.'

I guess this is where they don't quite make it to the 5 stars. I wanted some chili oil and didn't get it till after we got halfway through our meal after asking so many different waiters/ waitress.

I wasn't even hungry when I got here but I really enjoyed the food. I thought it was delicious and hands down better than in the states where I am from. All the dumplings have a thick layer of coating. The xiu mai was huge and chewy. The egg tarts have wonderful layers on the outside and the egg part was baked just right.

People were standing around watching others eat, waiting for them to get up so you can take their table. Awkward. There was no waiting area. Now we did have a party of 9 but nobody came to let us know where to wait. One lady told us there were other dining rooms. Yep. We checked. No tables. Sausage links were pink inside. Gross. Told someone but nothing was done. A #5 at McDonalds would've been much more appetizing than the food here. I bit into something hard in my eggs and it was (thank goodness) only a lemon seed. But...still...why? Kids were bored.  No music/entertainment. I told everyone I know that are planning to go to Disney not to book this place.

It's like the Chinese equivalent of Uncle Willy's.  Chinese or not - most people who grew up in the GVRD has eaten at Hon's at least once.  And come on, they call it a 'wun-tun' house... not 'wonton' - Hon's cares about proper phonetics, yo.\\n\\nIt's basically set up like a HK cafeteria.  And yes - due to the location and accessibility, most of the customers are non-Chinese.  Think the waitresses were in mild surprise when I dropped the Cantonese on them.  Side note - the name in Cantonese is 'Hon Kei'... so if you hear someone saying that in the restaurant - they probably aren't talking about you, roundeye.\\n\\nWe needed a quick grease fix so we grabbed an 'dry' beef chow fun (#88 - ~$10) and a dozen of their famous potstickers (~$7 - pan-fried pork potstickers are the only way to roll).  They input the orders via a handheld tablet so things came super quick.\\n\\nChinese people take 'dry' beef chow fun seriously.  It's the serious challenge for any Chinese chef to do this properly.  Stir frying bean sprout, onions, beef and flat noodles over a high flame is tough.  You need strong forearms for wok control and your timing has precise.  Overcooking bean sprouts = FAIL.  Overcooking the flat noodles so they fall apart = FAIL.  Undercooking or overcooking the beef = FAIL.  Adding too much oil to 'cheat', making it too greasy = FAIL.  Not have the right balance of soya sauce = FAIL.\\n\\nEvery place serves this and every Chinese person eats this - no exceptions.  My friend was told \\"You're not my son\\" when he told his dad he didn't like beef chow fun.  True story.  He's still hurt to this today about that comment - I keep telling him he's lucky that his dad didn't smother him in his sleep.  I mean... that's what I would do.  The 29th trimester isn't too late to eliminate a mistake, right?\\n\\n... and coming back from that tangent on filicide... Hon's beef chow fun was par for the course.  Not overly greasy - but lacking good 'wok hei' and colour.  I know the chef isn't name Bic or Lil Wayne... but come on, bring that flame.  For $10, it's pretty expensive compared to other places - but that may be due to the location.\\n\\nI remember the their 'famous' potstickers being better - good char on it, but the dumplings were kinda oily and mushy overall.  But perfectly okay for the price - next time, I'm just ordering a few dozens of these as beer accompaniment.  \\n\\nFor those of you aren't complete alcoholics, Chinese joints are the cheapest places to get bottled beer.  Most of the selection is $4 and they had Yanjing bottles on special for $2.99.  Yanjing is your typical Chinese beer... light, flat, skunky and sweet.  Like Shawn Bradley, no hops.  I was gagging a bit after ever gulp - but it was $2.99.  Any beer under $3 is' good' beer.  Comparable to Budweiser or Stella Artois.  Had to get two beers deep before I stopped wincing.  Come on, I'm Chinese - saving money is wet velvet sex to us.\\n\\nAnyways - decent Chinese eatery - a bit charming in how pedestrian and old school the decor is.  Cheap beers and good potstickers... why the fuck not?"},{"name":"Hog Wild BBQ","address":"9226 SE 82nd Ave","city":"Happy Valley","stars":"3.5","text":"Excellent food and service!

I watched the movie for the first time a couple days before our reservation, and I have to admit, it did make the meal more enjoyable. Otherwise, you simply wouldn't catch all the detail in the dining room and adjacent rooms, not to mention having zero clue what the characters are all about. \\n\\nIt is this detail that pushes what is really something closer to a 3-star restaurant, into 4-star territory. Judging purely on how I'd rate any other restaurant, it's hard to shake the feeling that beneath all the impressive Beast-related detail, the food, while competent, is a bit \\"institutional,\\" not far off from what I'd usually get served at a corporate board meeting dinner. \\n\\nFrench onion soup was tasty, if lacking a little rustic bite, because it had a sizable crown of browned cheese - how can you go wrong with that?\\n\\nExtra points for having Chimay, and the \\"lusty beer/food pairing whore\\" herself, Saison Dupont, on the beer menu. Every French restaurant in existence should have this on the menu.\\n\\nMy braised pork entree fell down a little bit, by being somewhat bland, under-seasoned. Normally, I do prefer that things be under-seasoned rather than over-salted, but this wasn't a question of not having enough salt - it just didn't have that savory, herbal character one would expect of a French farmhouse dish. \\n\\nFor dessert, try the gray stuff, sure, but it's little more than a somewhat generic cookies-and-cream concoction. \\n\\nEntirely worth it for a one-shot special Disney dining \\"experience?\\" Absolutely, and that is the sense in which I'm giving 4 stars.

With the exception of the now extinct Polynesian Luau, this is the only Disney dinner show I've done - and they do an awesome job with the entertainment, service, and food. \\n\\nHDD is located in a big dining/performance hall at the Fort Wilderness Resort and Campgrounds. There are tables on the main show floor as well as on the balconies that line the perimeter of the room (the price of each ticket is dependent on where you choose to sit). It's pretty easy to get to, while most will get there by bus you can also boat it there from the Magic Kingdom. The main theme of the show is modeled after a vintage Vaudeville/riverboat show - think Frontierland in the Magic Kingdom. There's singing, dancing, joking around, and audience engagement which makes for a fun time overall. Towards the end of the show, they pull a couple of guests to be part of the stage show, and for the finale everyone is given washboards to play along to the music. \\n\\nThe food? Oh man - they serve so much food, and I usually end up stuffing myself like there's no tomorrow. Most of the food is traditional American comfort foods - salad, ribs, fried chicken, corn, and strawberry shortcake for dessert. The food is served in these sturdy buckets to augment that down-home feel, and there is definitely enough for everyone in your party. Service has always been good, it's Disney so that's expected. \\n\\nOverall I would definitely recommend HDD to someone if they haven't been before.

I had a bad day a couple weeks ago, and one of the gals gave me a free bowl of mac and cheese to make me feel better.  I also got a free drink for making a cashier laugh!  The food is nearly always on point.  Parking is a breeze, especially for this part of town.  They have the BEST selection of drinks (I'm looking at you strawberry mint water, and pomegranate iced tea!).\\n\\nCons: It's so expensive, you guys.  Like...I buy a salad with meat on it and leave a tip because I'm not an asshole, and then it's a $14 meal that I had to order at the counter, and then I have to fill up my own drink.  I know \\"fast casual\\" is the Next Big Thing but why does it have to cost so damn much?  Apparently they have some sort of rewards program, but no one ever mentioned it--I discovered it while waiting in a very long, slow line the other day.  I think you can probably order certain things to keep the price down, but then you still want to tip, right? I mean there's a line for a tip, and the staff, as I said, is AMAZING so I don't want to stiff them.  I just always feel kinda resentful tipping for a meal I had to stand in line to order, you know?! Also, the music is usually super fast, loud techno that belongs in a spin class.  I feel like I'm racing to finish my lunch, instead of enjoy the food I just spent a bunch of money on.  Again, I get it!  They want us in and out, and fast music is one of the tools they use to make sure we don't linger.  It's just kinda off-putting.\\n\\nThe soup, sandwiches, and salads I have had are all delicious.  However!  Every time I get a caesar, they forget something. Last time it was croutons, which are the best part.  The most recent time, it was the dried tomatoes, which are the second best part.  The ale-laced chicken tenders are SOOO GOOOOD, but sometimes they come out a leeeettle bit burned.  Oh also, on my most recent caesar, some of the lettuce was turning kinda brown. Those kinds of complaints make me sound terrible, but when it's a $14 salad it needs to be 100% on point! \\n\\nOverall I LOVE Fresh2Order. Love!

While waiting for our food, I visited the restroom and the floors were so nasty that my sneakers almost stuck to the floor!    When I returned to the table, our food arrived.  The shrimp were burnt and greasy.  My husband's fish were over-fried and shiny from the grease!  I could not bring myself to try the shrimp, but we both took a bite of the fish; it was not good. The ends were so hard we could not even chew them and the fish was slimy and greasy. We notified the server (I forgot her name, but she was a good server) and left without eating.  We went next door and got Chinese food to take home.

Halibut Ceviche with Avocado, Lime & Toasted Corn:  Halibut was really fresh and it was a wonderful concoction of flavors and the lime did not overpower the sweetness of the fish.\\n\\n3. Spicy Squid:  They cook their squid right!  The spiciness packed just the right punch and the garlic and onions provided the additional flavor and kick to the dish.\\n\\n4. Dungeness Crab & Baby Shrimp Spaghetti with Cherry Tomatoes:  the waitress raved about their pasta dishes and I fully agree with her assessment.  This was the highlight dish of the night for me.  Pasta was perfectly al dente and the mixture of crab and shrimp was just plain mouthwatering.  I only wish they could put more crab meat in it.\\n\\n5. Seafood Hot Mess:  This is one of their signature dishes with a wonderful mixture of 1/2 lobster, mussels, clams, squid, scallops, prawns & a Ruby Trout filet.

The pretzel sticks are delicious. Triglycerides be damned. Skip the calamari, it's standard fried calamari that you can just about anywhere.  The boneless wings are okay, but if you like them pretty spicy, just get the highest heat level they have (I think it was called \\"en fuego\\").  That would be just above \\"medium\\" at many wing places. The Buffalo Chicken Flatbread is a bit uninspired, but not too bad.\\n\\nCertain flatbreads and appetizers (from above, the boneless wings, buffalo chicken flatbread and calamari are on the list) are half price during happy hour, which puts them at about what they're actually worth.

I thought the ceviche was too sour and the flavours didn't combine well together, nor with the generous garnish of cilantro. The mole lamb tacos were fun, but I enjoyed the popcorn topping more than the rest of it; the sauce didn't stand out and I think meatballs are an odd shape for a taco (they don't really fill the shell). Third course was the beef chilaquiles which was literally on 2 tortilla chips. The meat was very tender and flavourful but I wish it came with more chips to pair with. And the dessert was not what I expected it to be... yes I had read the pumpkin seed part but I thought it would be more chocolate torte, a dense chocolate cake but it was more like eating a chocolate granola bar. \\n\\nI think some people will probably enjoy the food more than I did but it wasn't to my taste.

We had one gentleman as our server, but I suspect he was filling in until someone else showed up, because we then had another server 15 minutes later. I had the citrus collins, which was SO TART. Like, I love citrus (why I ordered the drink) but even I was puckering. I had to add a packet of sugar. It seemed decently strong though. The GB house beers were only $3!\\n\\nAround 5pm we move to our seats. We hadn't noticed that on the menu it states that you can only get the happy hour pricing at the bar area -- fortunately our awesome server said he'd give us happy hour prices! Thanks dude. I had the california cobb flatbread, which was $6.99 for happy hour and a very fair price for the quality. If I had to pay the full price of $10.99 this would have been a 2-star review. Our group got a mix of legit entrees and happy hour items, and everyone seemed pleased with their meal. I tried some of their garlic fries, and they are most likely prepared in garlic oil -- so if you'll be hunting vampires later it'll give you a nice head start. The whole place started to fill up due to a hockey game that night and it was pretty busy when we left around 6:30. \\n\\nThe overall rating for this restaurant is pretty spot on.

Each is served with salad. \\n\\nSalads are right-sized for a lunch appetizer. Vegetables crisp and fresh, lightly dressed and served with warm pita.  The Shish Tawook is grilled skewered cubes of marinated chicken, served over long grain basmati rice with grilled vegetables.  The chicken was a little dry, but very tender and the garlic & herb marinate made each bite delicious.  \\n\\nShish Kabob is skewered cubes of marinated lamb, grilled perfectly medium.  The lamb was tender and juicy and scrumptious and served with grilled green pepper, tomato and onion over a bed of basmati rice.  This was excellent. \\n\\nShawarma is slices of marinated chicken, in this case served over hummus.  The chicken is cooked well - moist and flavorful.  Hummus is creamy with a little bite from the garlic and perfect on the warm pita. \\n\\nThe check was $35 for 3 including soft drinks, so about on par with what you'd expect for lunch.  \\n\\nIt's unfortunate that a restaurant with food this good is in such an out-of-the way spot.

The venue itself makes you feel like you stepped into some international Twighlight Zone.  There is no particular country that it feels like in particular.  It just feels very worldly with decor and works of art from various stops around the globe.  Think of some of the things that maybe Indiana Jones or Lara Croft would bring home, dropped into a sheik, cozy setting with lots of leather, brass, ceramics, paintings, maps, globes, and other artifacts.  \\n\\nThe dishes are from all over the place and the wines, ales, and other spirits also are not your run-of-the-mill national brands; a worldly selection of culinary delights and libations amidst a worldly backdrop.  And yes, the cocktails are like libations.  They are handcrafted with precision and attention to detail as if being poured for a deity.  Be mindful that a cocktail worth the sip takes time so don't come here to 'slam a quick drink' if you're in a hurry.  Here, the end results are well worth the wait.  The food rotates every few months so you never know where the journey will take you by the next time you come in for a bite.  Just reading the menu, or 'visa' as they call it, makes you feel like you just stepped off of a plane in some far-flung place.  \\n\\nLastly, the service was impeccable.  A group of 4 of us ordered several dishes to be shared family-style.  Our server kept us posted on the status of our orders and made recommendations when we were unsure about portions or flavor profiles.  He was very knowledgeable about the dishes as well as the wine selection and what paired well with which dishes.  \\n\\nThe Consulate is one of those places I could see coming back to for a special night out, or killing some time after work at the bar while traffic dies down.

Not sure what time they start doing this, but we've ordered online at varies times and it always happens.  Beats the purpose of ordering before you get there to avoid waiting around. This location also has the habit of not making your pizza the way you ordered it.  They are suppose to open the pizza for you to check to make sure, but they usually don't.  We do that on our own now because they almost always get our order wrong which is annoying. I've had them forget toppings altogether, ask for extra and not get it, etc. Example: I ordered extra pepperoni, extra mushroom, regular jalapenos with a drizzle. My husband picked it up, forgot to check and when he got home, it had normal pepperoni, normal mushrooms, no jalapenos and no drizzle.  We called to tell them and they didn't care.  Took his name and number and said somebody would call back and never did. However the pizza is very good when they make it the way it is suppose to be made/you ask.  Another problem is lack of cheese on their pizzas. A lot of the time, you will see spots all over where there is just no cheese even if you ask for extra cheese or order a cheese lovers and add toppings to it. Wings are over priced.

Frasca in Boulder is definitely another great high-end college town restaurant.  It is actually the most refined and polished of the bunch though I did feel the proteins and produce stood out more at L'Etoile.\\n\\nFrasca is an Italian restaurant and it has a great menu.  It is a build-your-own 4-course tasting menu that showcases so many great ingredients including many seasonal ones.  What I really liked about the restaurant was how it could be both a contemporary restaurant and a classic, rustic one at the same time.  It was like the chef was showcasing the great history of Italian food as well as providing a glimpse of where it can go in the future.\\n\\nMy opening course showcased sardines, tomatoes and basil, which are all hallmarks of Italian cuisine.  The sardines were nicely grilled--great oily flesh with a crispy and salty skin.  The saltiness was balanced by sweet corn--a great summer ingredient.  There was more great summer produce on the plate--juicy and slightly sweet heirloom tomatoes (not as sweet as the tomatoes I had in Georgia though).  There were also nice greens to help make this a refreshing and well balanced starter.\\n\\nThe next course was gnocchi.  Gnocchi can often be doughy or dry.  Restaurants can also put too much on the plate with it (to the point where the gnocchi is not really the star).  The gnocchi here was very good--very soft and a perfect melt in your mouth texture (not a trace of doughiness or dryness).  Also on the plate were pickled onions, beets, beet puree, and very good smoked ricotta that had a very faint saltiness.  It was a good dish though I do regret not ordering pasta since their pastas looked very good.\\n\\nMy main course was lamb loin, which sat on top of braised lamb shoulder, Swiss chard, beans, lemon, crispy purple potato slices, and red wine.  The dish tasted of great rustic Italian dishes that are hard to find nowadays.  The dish had a great red wine flavor, which gave the dish a great richness.  The lamb loin was tender and juicy and had a great slightly strong flavor.  The vegetable and bean medley was very good--rich and aromatic.  It was mostly a soft dish, but the kitchen utilized crispy and crunchy purple potato slices to provide a different texture.  The braised lamb shoulder also had a slightly crispy exterior; unfortunately, it was also a tad dry.\\n\\nDessert was exceptional.  It was an incredibly light cheesecake, which was made of ricotta, cream cheese and creme fraiche--great flavor but still very light and airy (one of the best cheesecakes I have ever had along with the great Brooklyn cheesecake at Healdsburg's Madrona Manor).  The cheesecake had great garnishes including very creamy and refreshing pistachio gelato and peach compote.\\n\\nService was excellent.  The whole staff was very polished as well as professional, polite, attentive, and friendly.  I also liked how they acknowledged special occasions.\\n\\nThe restaurant had a great look--very nice use of earthy colors and a contemporary but elegant dining room.  There were also great big windows to let in a lot of natural light as well as a very upscale and inviting bar area.\\n\\nPrices were not too bad.  The 4-course tasting menu is less expensive than similar quality restaurants in SF and Chicago.  While you get a good variety of food, the overall quantity of food might be less than those more expensive SF and Chicago places.\\n\\nFrasca is a very impressive restaurant and their food was noticeably better than other restaurants I tried in Colorado.  The menu featured so many great sounding dishes and I liked how the food fit with the season--both in the seasonal ingredients as well as the lightness of the menu (I imagine dishes get heartier and richer in the fall).  While I did not think the food stood out as much in terms of flavor and produce as great high-end Italian restaurants like Quince in SF and Spiaggia in Chicago, the food at Frasca was so consistently good from start to finish and the changing menu was so interesting in terms of variety and ingredients, it is definitely the type of restaurant that I would come back to again and again if I lived near here.\\n\\nFrasca has its own free parking lot.  Metered street parking is also available."},{"name":"Via Napoli","address":"EPCOT World Showcase - Italian Pavilion, 1510 Avenue of the Stars","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Pretty solid spot to grab some food in the World Showcase.

The crust was perfect and fluffy, the arugula was fresh and crisp, and the prosciutto was absolutely perfect and scrumptious. I don't like red sauce and they have plenty of white sauce options (a rarity if you like pizza but can't stand marinara or other tomato based sauces). There aren't many meals I'd repeat at Disney but this pizza is definitely one of them!

I liked it. \\n\\nFor an appetizer, we decided on the Taste of Africa (African-inspired Dips, Pappadum, Sesame Fatir, House-made Flax Seed Naan). The breads were all different and very tasty. My favorite was the sesame fatir. It was a soft, buttery, fluffy round flatbread that went well with all of the sauces! The four sauces were a olivey hummus, a tzatziki-like sauce, a mango chutney, and a tomato jam-like sauce. Very good. Very good.\\n\\nWe split two entrees, like we always do. \\nWe got a Oak-grilled Filet Mignon (Bobotie Macaroni and Cheese, Grilled Asparagus, Kachumbari, South African Red Wine Sauce). Cooked medium rare. Duh. This steak was very good. The char on it was picture perfect. It tasted like I charred it on my own grill. The inside ended up being cooked medium medium rare, but it was still good. The mac & cheese was awesome. It had chunks of ground meat in it, and it was slightly nutty, as if it was made with a nut milk. I liked it. The asparagus was grilled nicely, but I would have liked to have seen more than two sprigs on the plate. The mixed veggies added a great acidity to the dish, and the rich red wine sauce tied it all together. Solid, four star dish.\\n\\nNow we get to the part of the meal that earned this place five stars. \\nWe got the Bo Kaap Malay Seafood Curry (Lobster, Calamari, Red Shrimp, Mussels, Coconut-Curry Sauce, Saffron Rice).

But the thing that really caught my attention. I have never ordered a dish like this (seafood slathered in warm sauce with rice or pasta) that there wasn't at least one piece of the seafood that was overcooked. Until this dish. Everything was cooked well. Most surprisingly, the calamari was cooked well! It wasn't chewy, not one of the dozen or more pieces in the dish. I was amazed. I was very happy.\\n\\nWe were stuffed at this point, so we decided not to have dessert. Before we decided this, though, they brought me a surprise birthday little cup of a very firm chocolate mousse-like thing that was very delicious and very appreciated as a birthday token from Mickey. \\n\\nFinally, before we left, our server brought us out two little chocolate cookies as a parting gift.

What than means is that I don't go for things which are on the bone or for things where you look like a pig in a trough because you have some form of skin-grease-BBQ Sauce-fat-lard-oil-tennis ball fuzz all over your face-ears-head-fingers-hands-body by the time you're done eating.\\n\\nYes, I'm aware that eating \\"southern style\\" cooking usually involves all of the above but the lovely wife had heard from too many co-workers that this was a \\"must do\\" stop so I was told that we must do it.\\n\\nReservations:  We were at Disney during a dead week yet they were still doing three shows a night so getting a reservation was not difficult at all.  We had our choice of all three shows on the Thursday night that we went.  If you are on at least the regular DDP this place is an outlier in that you do not have to reserve with a credit card nor do you need to worry about tipping at the show as all of that is covered.  Now, with that said when you pick up your tickets at Pioneer Hall you see the insane price that is charged for this show.  For category three seating with gratuity it would have cost the four of us well over two hundred dollars if we were not on a Dining Plan.  It's kind of a ripoff on the DDP as this show eats two credits but sans DDP I couldn't imagine paying that because it's simply not worth it.\\n\\nService:  Our server was decent although as a few others have suggested with service here, she more or less disappeared as they night went on and if you needed anything after the main courses came out to the table you were SOL.  Also this idea of \\"unlimited\\" beverages is really a lie.  Disney is not going to let you get tanked here which is why I personally think that after the second round we were never offered any additional anything and even if we wanted something our server was MIA until dessert at which time she collected our plates & our glasses right before the shortcake was brought out.\\n\\nSeating:  We were upstairs in category three which wasn't bad as Pioneer Hall is small so no seat is a bad seat.  What I wasn't a fan of was sharing a table with other people who looked equally annoyed at the same idea.  The tables are set up in three's so if you have four people in your party, one of them will in essence be sort of sitting with another couple or at least that's how it worked out for me.  The tables are also packed in very small which makes swiveling your seat 180 to see the stage very difficult as the chairs are set up in essence backwards.\\n\\nFood:  For me personally, blech.  The salad was overdressed and overonioned to the point of being disgusting.  The bread was solid.  The beans were solid.  The ribs were beyond fatty and tough and the fried chicken....well in real life I don't do fried chicken so I'm not qualified to comment.\\n\\nShow:  Dopey-Corney-Hokey but all in a good way.  \\n\\nSorry but even on vacation and most certainly at Disney I can't help but feel ripped off when I'm not getting any value for my money and considering what is charged here in terms of either money or DDP credits that's exactly how I feel.  Two hundred plus dollars for essentially KFC quality food plus some fatty tough ribs...no thanks.\\n\\nIf you like this type of food more than likely you will enjoy this place as a whole.  But if you don't, then coming here is a complete waste of money that you'll be kicking yourself about two weeks later even if the rest of the people in your party thought it was pretty good."},{"name":"Grainmaker","address":"91 Summer St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Really good food value if you're in a rush and want to eat well.

A lot of times we go to AYCE hot pot places because we're both pretty hefty eaters (that's a lie, I'm the hefty eater, but irrelevant). We got there about fifteen minutes before the place opened (we'd heard talk of long wait times) and were quickly seated. There were only a few other tables filled up, but considering the place wasn't even open yet that's pretty impressive. They couldn't take our orders until they opened, but it gave us enough time to pore over the menu.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I started by ordering a bunch of vegetables (napa cabbage, bok choy,  oyster mushrooms, baby corn, enoki mushrooms), potato noodles and an order of Mongolian lamb skewers. When we started on the meats, the waiter immediately stopped us. He insisted that two or three kinds of meat were enough for the both of us. We were a bit skeptical, we typically order 5 or 6 different kinds of meats when we go out. He insisted again, so we settled. \\n\\nBoy, was he was right.\\n\\nWhen our meats (New Zealand lamb, American kobe beef, pork belly) arrived we were immediately aware of how huge the plates were. At least two or three times the size of an average plate somewhere else. We started digging in and immediately noticed how tender and fresh the meat was. Nothing suspicious there. Add in all the vegetables and we filled up in an hour. We couldn't finish all the veggies unfortunately, but we did destroy all the meat. Of course.\\n\\nOverall it was pretty good but there was a very obvious problem to the both of us. The broth. We got a split broth, mild and spicy, and while flavor-wise it was delicious, the amount of stuff they put in it makes eating an arduous process. Several times throughout the night one of us would bite into some sort of herb--it was rough. It was probably our fault for not skimming the broth beforehand, but still, ever heard of an herb sachet? \\n\\nWhile you might be paying more at Happy Lamb than an AYCE hot pot place, you're getting good quantity and even better quality.

We were in town visiting a friend and spent the day at the zoo, I was ready for some coffee and a snack by the time we were done and spotted this place across the street. I greeted the cashier as we walked in and she just immediately asked \\"what do you want?\\" without saying anything else. No problem, I figured she's probably having a bad day, it happens. I thought maybe I'd brighten her day after I paid with a decent tip. I ordered two drinks for my husband and I as well as a snack, she had to walk around the counter to see what the snack was and rolled her eyes at me when I pointed it out and said the name again to help her find it. \\n\\nAnyway, I paid and left her a nice tip even though she was obviously in a crap mood and hadn't said more than two words to me, then she starts saying our order off to the other girl behind the counter, except they weren't the right drinks. I interjected, \\"Excuse me, that was [insert our actual  order].\\" Keep in mind the drinks were not even made yet at this point, so no time or ingredients had been wasted... if looks could kill, I would not be typing this right now. As if it was our fault that she got our order wrong. When I thanked her as she finally handed us our drink, she again gave me a nasty look for no reason at all. I watched her interact with other customers in exactly the same way as we had our drinks, so at least I know it wasn't just me.\\n\\nI would chalk it up to someone having a bad day, but reading the other reviews it's pretty obvious this is a trend.

No Old World Spicy Pepperoni option. Cheese had a bit of snap like a rubbery texture. Not smooth, soft, and gooey. It has about 70% coverage to show your red crust where the sauce once was.

For years, their interior was a single storefront with framed indian artwork on the walls and \\"white tablecloth\\" trappings and service. There were some ornate booths separated by hung tapestry and the menu was a la carte or prix fixe. I enjoyed many of their dishes particularly the Mulligatawny soup, Chicken Tikka, mixed Tandoori and various appetizers.\\n\\nEnsuing years saw the rise of newer Indian restaurants ITP that worked the formula a little differently and I only recently returned to Himalayas after reading some current Yelps.\\n\\nI was pleased to see that Himalayas has indeed doubled in size, adding the next storefront to their original site. The interior has been substantially updated with the furniture and decor reflecting a more modern sensibility.\\n\\nThe food is still as good though. They are featuring a luncheon buffet now and I tried several items including a Dal soup, Chicken-65 and the standby Tandoori chicken. \\n\\nOnion Bahjees were good, crispy and oily like fried onion strings whirled into a ball and are a nice compliment to the soup. I found their Naan bread to be a bit overly dry, like crying out for butter or glee but it was fine for dunking in sauce from the chicken Kurma.\\n\\nThe buffet had a large number of vegetarian dishes as well as a small iceberg salad bar. They put out all the typical Indian sauces for you to try as well including tamarind, mint, yogurt-y Raita and uber-spicy pickled mango. \\n\\nIf you are unfamiliar with Indian cuisine, then looking over the items on their buffet is a good way to sample some dishes. \\n\\nI found the Service to be spot-on during my recent visit. Water glasses were kept filled and dishes were constantly bussed. I recognized some staff members from as far back as my visits in the Nineties.\\n\\nODD CAVEAT: the buffet set-up is a bit new to Himalayas and I can only guess they purchased the steam tables as used equipment from Restaurant Equipment Depot or some place going out of business. \\n\\nMy assumption is based on the labels taped over the glass sneeze guard above the various food items. Those labels indicate asian foods that I don't think Himalayas would put out e-v-e-r ... so i've caught you here, Himalayas! (Bwah-HA ha!) \\n\\nEither you bought the new tables and rushed them into service without a thorough cleaning or else some days you are featuring bourbon chicken and green beans along with the tandoori and Pilaw rice."},{"name":"East Side Pies","address":"13265 N Highway 183, Ste B","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Favorite Austin pizza spot.

The normal price is $21, so with the coupon, it was pretty much $10.50 per person.The restaurant was small but 80% of the tables were occupied already. We really wanted to sit in a booth just so it would be quiet when we chatted. We were refused twice by one of the workers (those who come around and take your plates away) because she said the booths were reserved for 4 people and it might get busy later at night. As a result, we chose a small table nearby. However, when I returned from the buffet, my friend was sitting at a booth. She said that the worker let her sit there because she saw how much we wanted to sit there.\\n\\nOkay, onto the actual buffet. Let me tell you this, it is definitely not worth going at the full price. I was so disappointed at the small selection of food they offered. The whole buffet probably look less than 20 steps to finish. Alright, there was the basic salad bar, then two kinds of soup (beef and veggies, and tomato bisque). The potato salad was good, almost tastes like those one could get at Safeway. The coleslaw I had was sour, so I was disappointed. Then there were 5 kinds of Chinese food: fried rice, chow mein, shrimp and peas, variety of steamed vegetables (bok choy, Chinese lettuce, etc.), and some sort of glazed pork. I skipped the fried rice and chow mein or shrimps with pea because they didn't look good. The vegetables were hard to bite into, and the pork were so tasteless I didn't even know what flavour they were supposed to taste like. \\n\\nOn the western side, there were mashed potatoes, some sort of pasta, basa fillet, chicken drumsticks, and a carving station (beef and pork). I skipped the mashed potatoes because it looked really dry. I tried a piece of the basa fillet but it was cold and the meat was hard. The best was probably the carved meat. \\n\\nThe dessert bar looked promising but I was wrong. I tried a lemon bar, two bite brownie, mixed berry square and some sort of fudge thing. The lemon bar was way too soft, and almost melted as soon as I tried to chew it. The brownie and the fudge were very dry, which had me sipping on my drink after each bite. The mixed berry square was so sweet that I had a tingling sensation in my jaw as I chewed. Finally, there was a soft serve machine beside the pop machine. I was expected at least two flavours, but unfortunately, they only had vanilla. But I will say that the vanilla ice cream was pretty good.

I had a black & bleu breakfast sandwich and a coffee.  I'd never been to the downtown location, but looking over the menu and pictures online, figure this would be a solid breakfast/burger spot.  The menu is a little overwhelming with the number of choices (online menu shows 15 different burgers, 9 breakfast sandwiches, as well as build your own options).  Menus with this kind of depth tend to be a bit of a yellow flag, but with the narrow focus on items that go between bread (let's ignore that there are 8 choices for bread/bread-like items) and high ratings for the downtown location, figured that they must execute well.  \\n\\nOrder at the counter and take a number, with the food coming out on blue trays, and in white butcher-paper lined plastic baskets.  As expected, the black and bleu was solid - it could have used a little more bleu cheese and onions, but it was a solid breakfast sandwich on Texas toast (thank goodness one of the staff members nudged me towards a bread option when I got a deer in the headlights look after the person training on the register rattled off the options to me).  \\n\\nThey were definitely staffed heavy and deep in training this morning, with a very crowded looking kitchen and 3 or 4 people around 2 registers (I think 3 people said hi to me before I even ordered, and there was a small amount of confusion as I wasn't sure who I should direct my order to).

How sad."},{"name":"Sugidama Soba & Izakaya","address":"260 Elm St, Ste 106","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"And just like that I'm in love with sushi again.\\n\\nNo mean feat considering I prefer explosive flavor and acrylamide-coated food.  It turns out that the little blob of green and the motor oil-colored sauce sushi chefs give you are not just optional seasoning.  They're necessary.  What also helps is that Sugidama's chefs have excellent instincts.\\n\\nWe'll get to that in a bit.\\n\\nSo apparently, I wasn't taking full advantage of the soy sauce and wasabi.  At all.  No wonder I wasn't feeling it.  What I was doing was a bit like lowering your ass onto a bat handle while the pitcher throws balls at your head: You won't get the most out of the experience.\\n\\nSo I did thorough research on the way sushi chefs prefer you eat their creations.  You cats better be grateful that I'm distilling this for you.  Read this carefully because it will make all the difference in the way you experience sushi.\\n\\nTip #1: Use very little soy sauce.  You would think people were planning to drink that shit from how much they pour into the porcelain yarmulke.  One splash is all you need.  You should be able to kind of make out the base of the saucer when you're done.  Very carefully, dip the fish part of your roll, if possible, into the soy sauce so that there's just a couple of dabs on it.  It's all you need.\\n\\nTip #2: Spread the wasabi on the other side of the roll.  Wasabi has the same effect on your tongue as a horse does on your ribs when you try to brand him with a hot iron.  Or the same effect as a failed jump over a fence.  So all it does when you spoon a hunk of it directly into your mouth is cloud the delicate flavors of the sushi. \\n\\nInstead, take that same blob and spread it thinly across the roll or stuff it within the crevices between the fish and seaweed.  That way you get the essence, the taste of the wasabi, and it mellows the ball-shattering effect.\\n\\nTip #3: Put some wasabi in the saucer, sprinkle it with the unique cayenne-based spice rub at the table, and then pour just a little bit of soy sauce on this mixture.  Mix vigorously until the wasabi is dissolved.  You should get a very deep-red, spicy, paste.  This packs a Pacquiao punch so use it sparingly.  Most places don't have the rub like Sugidama does but you'll get a great paste with just wasabi and soy sauce as well.\\n\\nBarring these sparsely-used additions, Sugidama's food doesn't need any help whatsoever, from anything or anyone.\\n\\nThe rainbow roll, the Boston roll, the yellowtail roll, the spicy salmon roll, and the lemon roll are all as flawless as Nicole Mejia.\\n\\nI'm not going to dissect the rolls.  The photos below will tell you what you need to know about what the rolls contain but you'll need to experience the textures for yourself.  The fish is so unbelievably fresh and soft, it melted as soon as it hit my furry tongue.\\n\\nYep, furry.  The day I ordered the spicy salmon and Boston rolls, I was in such a bad way after partying the night before, I felt like I had been molested by sandpaper.  What also helped was the complementary miso soup that came with it.\\n\\nMiso is a unique soup.\\n\\nThe miso paste that thickens the soup and gives it a very, very slight granularity can either turn you off or give your tongue a raging erection.  Some people describe it as slimy but that's horseshit.  It's slightly granular at best and is more like a dissolved Asian bouillon cube.\\n\\nMiso soup is also high in protein, which is one reason sumo wrestlers use it to gain weight.\\n\\nI might use that as an excuse when I eventually decide to let myself go and become a fat man.  I hate using that stupid fucking elliptical but I do it because I hate not being able to see my genitals even more.\\n\\nBut one day, in the guise of sumo training, I'm just going to dive into a vat of miso and eat it from the inside out.  Then I'll have several beers and take a nap.  I will only dress in thongs.\\n\\nMy aim is to look like Jabba the Hutt.\\n\\nI wonder how far Miss K will let that go before she either calls Chris Powell or dumps me.  There's no better test of love than having a partner that looks like fro-yo.\\n\\nA few last details about Sugidama: They also have great pork gyoza, the second best gyoza in town, the tuna tataki tasted like it was flopping around ten minutes before it reached my table, and the yuzu-based drinks are refreshing regardless of the weather.\\n\\nBetter than all the non-sushi items are the yakitori.  They're small plates, like ribeye with a lusty char, chicken meatballs, and thigh-and-scallion skewers.  Ordering about six of these can be a full meal and they're always good.  Check out the photos and prepare to be aroused.\\n\\nThis restaurant is perfect and I haven't even tasted the soba yet."},{"name":"Hilton Garden Inn Atlanta Airport/Millenium Center","address":"2301 Sullivan Rd","city":"College Park","stars":"3.5","text":"I stayed at every Hilton brand hotel close to the airport and finally settled on this one.

I never paid attention to Isshindo Ramen, which took over the former Pikaichi space.  After all, how good can a small ramen shop be if it offers 12 different kinds of ramen, 12 separate appetizers, at least 4 different Donburis, 4 curry rice bowls, and many many optional ramen toppings?  The Japanese believe that only a small noodle shop specializing in a few items will have the necessary time and attention to focus on making their ramen the best.   \\n\\nIn any case, I finally decided to try Isshindo the other day.  The new decor is very nice and attractive, combining Japanese and Chinese elements (it's a Chinese-run business).  The staff were all very welcoming, and the service was quick and efficient.  I ordered their Tonkatsu Ramen, which is a standard offering of most ramen shops and would give me a good basis for comparison.  On the plus side, the ramen noodles were very good; they were the \\"curly\\" kind and were cooked with just the right amount of \\"chewiness.\\"  The egg was perfect with a runny yolk, the char-siu slices were generous, and the seaweed and other minor toppings were all there.  On the less-positive side, the broth was not good at all.  It was thin, watery, and totally bland.  It simply lacked flavor and depth, as though it wasn't real tonkotsu broth.  This was a big disappointment, as the broth is what holds everything together and gives ramen its special taste and character.  It tasted like it was made very quickly, without the long hours of cooking and simmering with pork bones, etc., and therefore lacked the intense and distinctive flavor of tonkotsu.    \\n\\nI do acknowledge that many reviewers are giving rave reviews, so obviously this kind of \\"westernized\\" ramen appeals to some people.  I prefer a more authentic Japanese-style ramen, so I would be inclined to give it 2-stars, but maybe it was an aberration or an off-day.  I'll go back again soon to try another type of ramen and see how it is.  So I'll give it a 3 this time."},{"name":"The Heroes Grill","address":"1300 South St","city":"Titusville","stars":"4.5","text":"The owners are great people & the food is FANTASTIC!

I'm trying to find out what to order on the Yelp app before the server gets back.\\"\\n\\n[Time & Date of visit]:  Weekday evening\\n\\n[Party Size]:  4\\n\\n[Location/Ambiance]:\\nLocated after the fork between Scott Blvd and Church St. You can reach the spacious parking lot from either side. If there's a wedding being hosted at their event hall, there might be parking lot attendees directing patrons where to park. \\n\\nInside, very well lit dining room though their way of calling out orders that are ready could have some modernization I think when things get really loud. \\n\\nAmbiance - Though some patrons might be coming over from the wedding hall, don't fret if they are suited up. It's still a casual attire scenery. Average to loud noise levels depending on the time and day. \\n\\n[Service]: Fast style; order and pick up at the counter. Condiments and water refills are self serve at the adjacent cashiers counter. \\n\\n[Food Highlights]:\\nMango Lassi - Honestly this wasn't as good as other Indian restaurants that I have attended. It's just ok, missing some flavor punch on the final notes I feel.\\n\\nNaan -  Warmed up a bit more crispy, flaky than other restaurants by comparison but a welcomed rendition. I just wish they had options of garlic naan. \\n\\nMutton Masala - A hint of spiciness but not much too linger if you're palate is more on the mild side. Just watch out for small bones while you scoop with a piece of naan. Not really much a gamey taste because the masala sauce is more flavorful. Honestly I couldn't tell what kind of meat it is, good or bad thing. But it's tasty. \\n\\nChicken 65 - Not as spicy as the coloring might suggest I think. But one bite and you can see why every other table might have the same plate. It's good, trust me. \\n\\n{Summary}:\\nFor a fast casual kind of atmosphere with wallet friendly places, Zyka is a welcomed long standing Indian restaurant worth trying.

It's the reason that, every few months, I go. You don't need dressing for it to have decent flavor and moisture. But pick off the execrable cucumbers, those blots upon botany. I like cucumber sandwiches, cucumber martinis, and certainly salads with cucumber, but bitterness on this level should be reserved for stolen elections and Star Wars Prequels. \\n\\nA good salad, but host to unspeakable foulness.\\n\\n----Background----\\nOccasionally, a gardener bites into a homegrown cucumber and thinks \\"my cucumber is bitter, why?\\" Understanding what causes bitter cucumber can help to prevent having bitter cucumbers, or indeed, selling them.\\n\\nWhy a cucumber is bitter\\n\\nCucumbers are part of the Cucurbit family, along with squash and melons. These plants naturally produce chemicals called cucurbitacins, which is very bitter and, in large quantities, can make a person ill. Most of the time, these chemicals are confined to the leaves and stem of the plant, but can work their way into the fruit of the plant in certain conditions causing bitter cucumbers.\\n\\nWhat causes bitter cucumber?\\n\\nTOO HOT\\nOne of the most common reasons why a cucumber is bitter is due to heat stress. If a plant is stressed due to heat, it may start producing bitter cucumbers.\\n\\nUNEVEN WATERING\\nAnother possibility for what causes bitter cucumber is if a cucumber goes through alternating periods of drought and overwatering, the stress from this can cause the plant to produce bitter fruit.\\n\\nTEMPERATURE FLUCTUATIONS\\nIf the temperature fluctuates dramatically from one extreme to another over an extended period of time, the plant may start producing bitter cucumbers.\\n\\nHEREDITY\\nPerhaps the most frustrating reason why a cucumber is bitter is simple genetics. There is a recessive trait that can cause a plant to produce bitter fruit from the start. You may plant seeds from the same packet and treat them all the same, only to discover one of the plants produces bitter cucumbers.\\n\\nMy cucumber is bitter, how can I prevent this?\\n\\nIn order to prevent bitter fruit, you have to address what causes bitter cucumber fruit in the first place.\\n\\nAlways use best practices when it comes to raising your cucumber. Keep cucumbers in an even temperature, which means that you should be planting the cucumber so that it gets the right kind of sun for your climate (sunnier areas in cool climates, morning and afternoon sun only in hotter climates). Water evenly and regularly, especially in times of drought.\\n\\nUnfortunately, once a cucumber plant starts to produce bitter fruit, it will most likely continue to produce bitter cucumbers. You should remove the plant and start over. On no account should you slice its vile spawn into salads to be inflicted upon the public."},{"name":"Brick & Fire","address":"1621 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This place was decent.

I would act out the movie with my friends.  This is to tell you that I had high expectations, but was also already inclined to love the theme.  I'd already been there for lunch as you can see from my previous review.  Therefore, I already saw the beautifully intricate ballroom and other dining rooms, so that didn't sweep me off my feet.  However, there is something to be said about being served your food.  It adds to the meal when you don't have people running all over the place.  I also think they kept the ballroom a little darker, which added to the experience.\\n\\nOur server was good.  He was extremely fast at filling my husband's empty cup, but other than that he was pretty scarce (not that we needed anything).  \\n\\nThey bring out bread and butter to start the meal.  It was nice and warm and I appreciated having something to munch on while waiting for the food after walking around all day.\\n\\nI got the Shrimp and Scallop in a puff pastry dish and my husband got the steak.  My husband really enjoyed his steak.  I really enjoyed his fries.  They were thicker fries, but they came with a great mayo dip.  They were also nicely salted.\\nI was a little disappointed with my shrimp and scallop dish.  The scallops didn't really have a taste to them.  The pastry was fluffy, but tasted like it was made from frozen dough.  I would have liked more of the lobster sauce.  Overall it wasn't terrible, but if you have to start a sentence like that, you know it is not great.\\n\\nFor dessert we got the triple chocolate cupcake.  They roll out the cart so you can see all the choices.  Now I wish we got the grey stuff (which is the like a mousse on the top of a chocolate block.

I didn't like the random chocolate rice crisp balls they had on it.  Otherwise it was delicious.\\n\\nWe made our reservations 150 days before we went (when the day finally opened for us to make reservations).  So needless to say it was a wait.

I read the review about how everything is locally sourced and finely made, but $18 for a pastrami sandwich with no sides is far too much.  I'd say lower the price and you would definitely sell more, from an economic perspective. The cheese pie however was very nice!!

Then you choose any random table, and they have cool gps roses that tell servers where you're seated so they can bring food to you.

Magic.\\n\\nBetween my husband and I, we had the coq au vin, the French dipped sandwich, French onion soup, master's cupcake, and strawberry cheesecake cupcake. Our favorite? The French dipped sandwich and French onion soup. The sandwich had a delicious broth that was just amazing (even better than the French onion soup IMO for some reason), and the French dip had cheese that pulled like forever...it was amazing. The coq au vin (pulled pork?) wasn't as good as the French dip. Not as flavorful.\\n\\nThe grey stuff was good. Not amazing but a check off the box. Not too sweet, and if you get it, get the master's cupcake. Comes with bread plus the grey stuff.  Like you gotta try it if you come to be our guest--it's like it's iconic dessert, right? The strawberry cheesecake dessert was way too sweet. Didn't taste like cheesecake...or strawberry, oh well. The amount of food was huge. Come hungry because ordering two entrees and soup between two adults left us way to full, and we came hungry. It's not one of those places that gives you a small amount of food for a high price.\\n\\nThe food in general wasn't the best I've ever had, but it definitely the coolest and best value (in terms of weighing price and quality) in Magic Kingdom without going outside of this particular park (which bumps my rating from a 4 to a 5)."},{"name":"Mikado Sushi","address":"6417 Raleigh St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"The waitress only filled our water once, took 30 minutes to come by and take our order (we had to wave at the front desk several time to get our waitress to take our order/check/come by at all).

Great consistency and complements the broth well. I do wish the broth was a bit spicier, but the portion size was good for the price. There were lots of additional ingredients in the soup--beef, radishes, and cilantro--and they didn't skimp on the portions for those either. Not the best spicy beef noodle soup I've had, but definitely met my craving.

Not Boma. While they do have the whole quantity thing going on, they also have some amazing quality things going on. \\n\\nFirst bit of advice: for goodness sake, skip the boring American food and go for the African-inspired dishes. The bobotie is delicious (at the very end of the buffet, past the beef and salmon). It's a great combination of ground beef covered with a custardy topping. Think a South African version of Shepard's pie. It's well worth 2 helpings. You should also try the watermelon rind salad/pickle. It's next to the other veggies. It's a great use of a part of the fruit we all typically throw away. If you like soup, try the Muligitawny.  While it's Indian, and not South African, it's also a more interesting choice than the more traditional soups. \\n\\nSecond bit of advice: try a little bit of everything you've never eaten before. The great thing about a buffet is that you can then go back for those things you liked, and avoid what you didn't like (but at least you tried it...unlike the people at the next table...)\\n\\nFinal bit of advice: save room for dessert.

The delivery pamphlet was on my mailbox this week and I idly looked it over and circled things I thought sounded interesting. I woke up around 6pm after two long weekend shifts back to back and decided to stay in. I also decided tonight was the night. I wanted to know what all this Tandoor stuff was all about, and I was famished.\\n\\nI was nervous calling to place my order for delivery. And I mean nervous enough that my darling S ordered Chinese too incase I was unhappy with my meal. Sweet.\\n\\nThe gentleman on the phone was very nice, and I think he could ascertain that I was new to all this, I quickly went from butchering the names of dishes to saying things like \\"V 4\\" and he asked if I had ever had it. I explained I had never had ANY Indian food in my life. My parents don't eat spicy food and I never ventured out. I'm a square. \\n\\nHe asked me my name, and shared his name (THAT I refuse to butcher on yelp) and helped me with all my selections! He was very informative and genial. He told me they have been in business for 18 years and I had called the right place. We talked about what Naan was and he recommended I try the plain first, and tomorrow try some others (: I liked his enthusiasm. \\n\\nYou can choose between Mild, Medium, Hot or Very Hot for all of your dishes. He also asked me to call tomorrow and let them know what I thought about everything good and bad. I promised him I would.\\n\\nWe ordered a selection of dishes to try out all the flavors.\\n\\nPilaw Rice- highly aromatic basmati rice flavored with saffron $1.99 ... He added this to my order, and told me that it's very common to eat the dishes atop the rice and it will cool down the heat of the spices. For pretty plain white rice, liked it. It was extremely moist and went well with all my orders!\\n\\n\\nLamb Boti Massala- lamb marinated in yogurt and mild tondoori spices, then baked in a Tondoori Oven and cooked with cream, almond, pistachio & Chef's special Tikka Massala Sauce. $14.99\\n\\nWe ordered it Medium and it is delicious! I love the sauce so much! I've been dipping bits if naan and Pilaw Rice in it. It seems as if its more as a sauce-soup like dish with chunks of meat in it, I'm not complaining! I will say the lamb was a bit tough and chewy but it didn't turn me off to the dish as a whole. Lots of flavor, creamy and good texture! Wishi had more naan to soak up this curry sauce!\\n\\n\\nChicken Curry- cooked with ground spices and fresh herbs $10.99\\nThis was a very delicious choice in my opinion. The chicken is cooked well and tender. We chose Medium spice and I really enjoy it. It is a bit hotter than the Lamb Boti but I really like the curry spice. It needed a heat I think. The sauce is much thicker, and absorbed by the chicken than other dishes.\\n\\nNaan- flour baled bread cooled in a tandoor (clay oven) $1.99... it was fluffy and had a good flavor, warm and great dipped in our dishes.\\n\\nAloog Sag- potatoes cooked with spinach and fresh ground spices $9.99\\nThe potatoes were very soft and flavorful, and the spinach was cooked perfectly, but it was more of a spinach dish with a few potatoes than a potato with spinach dish.. If that makes sense...but good!\\n\\nVegetable Biriyani- Vegetables cooked with aromatic rice and flavored with saffron $10.99\\nThe vegetables in this rice included broccoli, potatoes, carrots, green bell peppers, green beams, peas, celery etc. it had lots of flavor but it wasn't overly spiced and not salty whatsoever. I stumbled upon a raisin or two which was strange but it didn't spoil my bite. It is actually very flavorful! But it's pretty untouched. I'm not sure if this 'Indian Fried Rice' is for me so much. Maybe the thick carrots and potatoes threw me off. \\n\\nMy bf liked everything I ordered, and his brother Matt who is a big fan of curry and exotic food said it was the best he's had in GA. A big compliment considering the places around the world he's been.\\n\\nAll in all I enjoyed it!

Well, actually, it's two weeks after my bday so we called it \\"You ain't got to pay day\\" instead.  It was my choice based on all the glowing Yelp reviews about their prix fixe menu for $25.  I didn't want to break bff's bank.  \\n\\nOne disclaimer tho, whenever bff and I are together we \\"see the world thru rose-tinted glasses\\" as Mom would say.  Everything is funnier, prettier, and tastier with the glaring exception of the movie we watched also yesterday, \\"New Moon\\"**.  I guess one half naked hot boy + bad acting + bad dialogue + bad makeup/wigs does not a good movie make (unless we're talking porn).\\n\\nBut I think I'm legit when I say the food here was realistically great!  I had the Lyonnaise salad with a perfectly poached egg that gushed when I cut into it, causing me to gasp with pleasure.  Bff got the duck liver pate that was a monster slab which is great if you're into that sort of thing, and he is.  The bad/good news of the evening was they were out of salmon (there was a choice of lamb, beef or trout/salmon), but they substituted that for scallops and sea bass which was a no-brainer for me.  The sea bass literally melted when it hit my tongue, and the scallops!  These are the scallops by which all others shall be judged!  Bff and I thought our eyes were gonna get stuck in the back of our heads.  I told him we'd discovered Sting's secret to an hour long climax.  It was truly tantric.  The sides (squash, hush puppies?, and a cooked tomato) were just a means to prolong the entree and to keep me from sliding outta my seat in pleasure.  This is not quantity food for sure.  There were only two good sized scallops and perhaps a 2-3 oz fillet of fish.  But a meal like this encourages slow, meditative eating, and next thing you know you're sated.  \\n\\nMy only disappointment was the caramel custard.  Looking almost flan-like, the top and sauce were very caramelly, but the actual custard had no flavor.  Kinda like eating tofu.  Bff really enjoyed his huge chunk of brie and apples tho for dessert.\\n\\nThe service was outstanding and if I can get those scallops/sea bass again (I would hope they're on the regular menu), I would be guaranteed to go back multiple times for multiple O's!\\n\\n**Btw, I am definitely on Team Jacob!

After being seated, we sat for over 10 minutes before finally having to flag down an employee and ask who our waiter was. At that point another employee who was I assume a manager took our drink orders which included 3 mexican martinis with extra olives, only to be told when the drinks were brought out that they were out of olives (seriously?). We then placed our orders, 3 of which included spiced chicken only to find out they were out of spiced chicken completely. Our other order was the cotija chicken Caesar salad which came out sans any semblance of cotija cheese which then took us asking two separate employees for a side of cotija. The cotija finally made it out only for us to find an extra $1.00 charge for a \\"side of cheese\\" on the bill. All of this happened during what should be prime time on a Saturday evening. To cap it off both the men's and women's restrooms were disgusting with water on the floor and only a single functional urinal.

What a disaster. I understand being in the weeds because of a high volume event, but this is a weekly thing and the staff echoed that bad experiences are typical. Everybody should be able to pop in anywhere, grab a bar seat, order a beer & a burger, and be on their way in half an hour. This would be impossible here.\\n\\nAfter waiting 45 minutes for 2 burgers, we were informed that we shouldn't complain, as it can typically take up to an hour! After hearing that, we decided to leave, wishing we had known before ordering. As we were cashing out, our food showed up - and the bartender asked the manager to take it off our bill. The manager's response was extremely lackadaisical and unconcerned, basically, \\"what do you expect from us?\\" I tried to engage the manager regarding how reasonable he thought it was for customers to wait an hour for a burger, and if it he thought we should know the situation before ordering. He was pretty unapologetic and didn't want to hear it. Unfortunately, dealing with frustrating/embarrassing situations with customers is what he gets paid to do! The staff let us know that the kitchen was half filled with regional management struggling to get the food out, so I can't entirely fault him, as someone from upper management should've taken responsibility and led by example regarding customer issues.\\n\\nThe thing that kills me is we waited an hour for a boring, gray, well-done, barely warm burger and fries! If you're going to make me wait an hour, it should be epic. Or, at least good. I ate about half of it and half of the cold fries, and had enough. They'd have fared better if they cooked it an hour before I even got there, and served it to me reheated within 10 minutes. I can't imagine it tasting any worse, and at least it'd be served in a reasonable time! Running a promotion does not mean customers should have to lower their standards. 2 stars because the bartenders did their best to deal with a mismanaged kitchen, and overall their service was great. I definitely won't be back on a Tuesday though, or probably ever again for the food.

We were greeted and seated immediately by a fairly friendly waitress.   As we pondered the menu, not being very experienced in Vietnamese cuisine, we decided on the shrimp spring roll as an appetizer, the beef and shrimp meatball soup and clay pot with seafood as our lunch selections (to share).\\n\\nWe asked our waitress what \\"seafood\\" meant and she said shrimp, scallops, crab meat and squid.   The menu does not describe the dish more than \\"Clay Pot with Seafood\\".\\n\\nTwo spring rolls, cut in half, were served with a peanut sauce with chunks of peanuts.  A quite tasty dipping sauce.  The wrapping was very sticky, hard to get off the plate.\\n\\nOur soup and clay pot dish arrived shortly after finishing our appetizer.  As we spooned our soup into smaller bowls, we noticed the beef appeared to be very fatty and no signs of any \\"meatballs\\".   When the \\"clay pot\\" arrived, it was in a metal pot with a handle and contained stir fry chicken, three medium shrimp, a few pieces of crab meat, a sighting of calamari or squid and not a single scallop over sticky rice with mixed vegetables.   \\n\\nAs my friend and I were eating the soup, we separated the beef pieces from what we thought was fat on the beef.  We piled the fat on an extra plate since it didn't look appetizing at all.   The noodles in the soup could have been prince spaghetti noodles and the soup was gingery and a bit salty for my taste.\\n\\nWe preferred the clay pot dish over the soup.  As my friend went to the bathroom, she observed  most of all of the patrons had some kind of soup which made since because of the restaurant name \\"pho\\".\\n\\nAs our table was being cleared, I picked up a take out menu to re-read the descriptions of what I thought we ordered.   A different  waiter came over (besides the young lady who was our waitress) so we asked him what the pile of \\"fat\\" we left on the extra dish was and he said \\"beef\\".   We proceeded to tell him we didn't find any shrimp meatballs but his accent was quite heavy and he kept repeating \\"beef\\".    Then I asked about why chicken was in the clay pot with seafood and he said the dish called \\"clay pot\\" listed immediately before the dish we ordered has chicken so if you order the one with seafood, they just add seafood to the clay pot with chicken.  So ... where was the description of clay pot much less clay pot with seafood?   If we were vegetarians, we would have been very unhappy with the clay pot with seafood having chicken.    He seemed somewhat confused and went to ask our waitress about the soup.  He returned after a few minutes and said we were given the wrong soup.  We were given the beef tendon soup and not the one we ordered.\\n\\nHe rambled on about the soup and the clay pot until we finally nodded and said we were all set indicating we wanted the check.   He never offered to comp the wrong soup and by this point, we were annoyed and had already eaten both dishes though they weren't exactly what we thought we ordered or expected. \\n\\nWhen he delivered the check, he said he would inform the owner that the clay pot with seafood listing in the menu should be amended to indicate it contained chicken ...yes, that would be a good idea!\\n\\nVery poor customer service if you acknowledge giving someone the wrong dish and don't even make any efforts to remove it from the check.

From the parking lot, Himalayas doesn't look like much - there's also a sister store \\"Himalayas Grocery\\" to the left. The restaurant was once in a bustling shopping center that has since seen a decline - I've heard that it's due for a sprucing up and will be the location of a new anchor store. Right now, besides Himalayas there's a Chik-fil-a, an IHOP and a Duncan Donuts/Baskin-Robbins facing Peachtree Industrial, so it's a bit of a fast-food alley. We were enticed to once again visit due to a Groupon - two buffets including a samosa and mango lassi, for the price of one. It seemed like a good deal and I'm glad it once again brought us to this good Indian restaurant.\\n\\nThe interior of the restaurant is more high-end than you would expect from such an innocuous storefront - tables line the walls and middle, covered with real cloth table covers and cloth napkins. The service here is quite good, although at first brush you may be taken aback by the droll attitude of the servers - they're actually quite funny in a cynical way and know they're way around food. Himalayas focuses more on the cuisine of Northern India (some call it Delhi style) featuring many tandoori-cooked items and kabobs. We arrived around 11:30 and were seated immediately, heading for the buffet.\\n\\nThe buffet is towards the back of the restaurant and consists of two lines - a non-veg line on the left and a vegetarian line on the right. I liked that they kept these distinctly separate as some of my vegan friends get pretty weird about the food \\"accidentally touching\\" when it's all in the same place. Towards the back is a cold line with many chutney and pickle options - also some great looking fresh fruit, salad and desserts.\\n\\nThe first two hotel-pans you see on the meat-line were of a nice long-grain basmati rice and something you rarely see - dosas! The dosa is a thin crepe (traditionally they're bigger than these and in India served on a banana leaf but I think this is a much more manageable style for individual servings on a buffet) - these are time consuming to make and I was surprised to see them on a buffet. These are Madras style served with a delicious mint chutney. Next were two chicken dishes, first something called \\"Chicken 65\\" which appeared to be white meat chicken marinated in tandoori marinade (spiced curd) heated and tossed with jalepeno peppers - loved this stuff. Next door were traditional tandoori chicken wings that were very good - first time I've seen a whole pan of chicken wings done this way and I must say it's a winner.\\n\\nNext we get into the ubiquitous chicken tikka masala - most of my friends call this \\"butter chicken\\" and after eating three different variations of \\"butter chicken\\" while in India, I guess that's as good as any other name. This is a rich, tomato-y curry dish that even people that don't like Indian usually enjoy. This version was a bit milder than I like but still delicious and creamy. Next to it was something I haven't had before, sag chicken - pieces of chicken cooked with spinach, very tasty. The final pan held the goat curry which was appropriately spicy and tender.\\n\\nAcross the aisle, the vegetarian options started with curried vegetables that had a nice combination of green beans, peas, potato, carrot, zucchini squash and eggplant. It had much more variety than what you usually see at your typical buffet and a decent amount of spice. To the right a very nice sag paneer with fresh sliced tomatoes - this was one of my favorites on the line - being saucy enough that it didn't get that \\"hammered\\" over-cooked flavor.  There was then a tofu masala that was also very tasty next to curried eggplant that was delicious and finally a very nice pan of spiced broccoli and very fresh pakora (this latter also had eggplant in it - something I don't usually see).\\n\\nI filled up a plate and headed back to the table - all was delicious and I especially liked the dosa. I went back for about half a second plate, picking up some items I hadn't on the first pass, then hit the cold line for some dessert.

We finished out drinks and left because we were very uncomfortable.  When we left, the guy with the beard and devil ears dressed as a woman, FOLLOWED us THREE BLOCKS harassing us for no reason. Called us b*tches, homophobics and other outrageous words. The sad part was, nobody helped us. We will NEVER EVER be back. This man dressed as a woman with devil ears should be fired IMMEDIATELY.

We were really shaken, in a good way, because we couldn't believe the attentiveness of the staff.

The rolls were very dense and over fried, as the batter was too thick, and the fry oil hadn't been changed in awhile. Also, there was no foie inside that thing, you just want to charge a premium on the app, so stop.

That's where the extra money that you pay is going to.\\n\\nWe tried 3 different kinds: Blueberry-Bourbon-Basil, Passion Fruit Cocoa Nib and their powder-sugared beignets. All of them were good. The blueberry donut had bright, intense and fresh flavors, and I always love the addition of basil in anything sweet. The passion fruit donut had a kick to it, spicy and sweet and studded with cocoa nibs. The beignets were airy and the perfect coffee companion.\\n\\nI'd like to go back and try more.

Speaking of drinks, I never did receive a refill of my Diet Pepsi. Although there were two waitresses working, it seemed like there was only one working. When she was not talking to a regular customer. I don't know where the other one went to.\\nLike I said, if it is pizza you want, then this buffet is for you. And great for children too. Like the three adults at the booth next to me with the two elementary school aged children on a Tuesday afternoon. At 12:51 p.m. Is there a school holiday I don't know about?\\nWhen I went to pay my bill, I was left standing at a service counter for several minutes before the waitress called me over to another register and rang me up for my meal.\\nSo if you are looking for lunch on the cheap, this Pizza Hut location is ideal for when you are shopping at the nearby mall and department stores.\\nAnd it only costs $4.99. Or is it $5.99?"},{"name":"Chart House","address":"60 Long Wharf","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"My wife and I went to the Chart House because we received $75 in gift cards, otherwise, it would be a restaurant for only special occasions because it is very expensive.\\n\\nThe restaurant is in a renovated, historic building.  It is beautiful inside, and even worth it for a visit to the bar for some drinks.  It is a very comfortable fine dining environment.  \\n\\nOur server was excellent and the food was fantastic.  For an appetizer we shared the lobster spring rolls which were excellent.  My wife had the macadamia nut encrusted mahi mahi with ginger coconut rice, and I had the mixed grille, both plates were amazing and the portions were surprisingly decent.  The famous chocolate lava cake dessert is well worth the $9.99 price tag, just be sure to order it ahead of time because it takes 30 minutes to prepare (at least that is what they want you to believe so that you'll want to order it!).\\n\\nThe only complaint I have is that we had to sit in close quarters, when the restaurant was still fairly empty.  We would have preferred to have our own table, instead of sharing our dining space with other people.  \\n\\nThis restaurant is excellent for a special/romantic dinner, but be prepared to spend at least $100 for dinner for 2."},{"name":"Avocado Mexican Grill","address":"715 Bloom St, Ste 130","city":"Celebration","stars":"3","text":"Negative side: Service.

My beef burrito was delicious even though I thought it suppose to be chicken but it tasted good. The guy was nice, but needs to get orders straight by writing it on note pad.

What an awesome idea to put grilled kilbasa and pierogi on a burger. It was tremendous. Maybe it was the 2 Scottish Ale's talking, but I think it was better than many burgers I claimed to love. If that's not the case then it was a solid burger. My boyfriend got the club, which was standard, but you can choose the side of which he chose pierogis. Awesomness! I got the house chips, which were great. \\n\\nOverall a great night. Fun crowd, awesome beer, yummy food. Winning!

Spicy. \\n\\nThe noodles had that signature chew but they weren't in the slightest bit spicy. Thankfully I have a jar of my favorite fried chili oil at home so was able to doctor them up. The dish was much saltier than the other location and the pork belly was sliced so thin, like pepperoni on a pizza thin. This changes everything.

With a larger Asian population, I would have preferred to had my first Texas Indonesian fare in a city such as Houston or Dallas. Alas, Austin has Java Noodles, and I couldn't resist for long.\\n\\nPrimarily because of the heavy use of coconut in ASEAN grub. ASEAN is some Southeastern Asian organization or governmental conglomerate. I don't know much about it, but I guess it is a good way to refer to the grub that comes out of this thousand island complex of a country.\\n\\nAnd what did Indonesian home cooking have to offer me at Java Noodles? Specifically, the $10 order of Beef Rendang, a spicy meat dish indigenous to a specific people group in Indonesia. That was certainly more obscure information than you needed to know, but it is basically a coconut curry with beef stew.\\n\\nI am currently reading up on the process of making this, and apparently you evaporate the coconut milk until it soaks into the beef. Mine was more like a Thai curry, with its runny character, but whatever. I guess it wasn't spot on, texture-wise, but I very much did enjoy it. The beef chunks were huge--probably close to a half pound of pure beef shoulder.
