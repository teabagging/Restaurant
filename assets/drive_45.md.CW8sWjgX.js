The Veggie wraps which are cut down the middle and presented nicely in the case, are much different than they appear. The 'half wrap' which I was given had plastic wrapped around it, which I quickly learned was holding in wilted lettuce in a soggy spinach wrap. Approximately a 1/2 cup of wilted lettuce fell out of the bottom of the wrap when I took the plastic off, leaving only a few slivers of vegetables and a small piece of cheese. I immediately felt like I was victim to a scam. They present a nice wrap in the case, and then stick something much different in a container and send you on your way. I spent over $11 on a wrap that was worth $0.75. Had I not already been in a different terminal when this discovery was made, I would have gone back to return the wrap and ask for a refund. It is so disappointing to know, not only are people being charged exorbitant prices, but the business is getting away with scamming people with their product.

That is because Barley Swine IS the date.\\n\\nEvery experience at Barley Swine IS a little bit like courtship, with the thrill of the pursuit in just getting there at the perfect moment to get a table. But alas, good things come to those who wait, and the butterflies in anticipation make it that much sweeter.\\n\\nWith only 42 chairs, they don't take reservations. If you have to wait, they will take your mobile number and call you a few minutes before you will be seated. This way, you can venture next door to Henri's, or down the block to Opa or another bar and enjoy a beverage while you wait.\\n\\nIt is hard to review a place like this with more than 200 people singing their accolades, but I decided to try for my 200th Yelp review.\\n\\nIn order to have the perfect Barley Swine experience, take your time. If there are two in your party, order six to seven plates and a dessert to share for the full experience. I can be predictable at ordering. To dissuade this, I take cues from the staff on their perfect meal.\\n\\nEach plate is truly a work of art. They are carefully prepared with as much local, farm-to-table items as possible and artfully arranged. They always look too pretty to eat. And this is where the magic happens. That first bite of each dish you slowly chew, sit back, let all the flavors burst into a perfect medley of any combination of savory, salty, sweet, moist, melt-in-your-mouth ecstasy rising to that crescendo of pure exhilaration. You never knew all these textures and tastes would bring such extreme pleasure that causes you to let out inaudible gasps of joy. And with each subsequent dish, you get a new first-time experience to have that moment all over again. It's like having seven or eight food-gasms in one night. Each one is exciting, new and different as you are unwrapping the flavor and texture combination that each work of art brings.\\n\\nNow it is hard to recommend a specific dish here, because the menu changes monthly. I have loved everything I have tried.\\n\\nThey generally have a scallop dish on the menu, but the way they are prepared will change from time to time. Do not miss this dish as the scallops are always melt-in-your-mouth, perfectly cooked and married with a creative array of flavors. This week I had scallops with Brussels sprouts cooked in peanut oil with peanuts and ruby grapefruit wedges over a sweet potato puree. The peanut oil was genius, and I loved the citrus and sweet contrast to the flavors.\\n\\nIt is amazing how they creatively prepare dishes with foie gras, from a more savory foie gras with pork belly, goat cheese grits and watermelon like they served up last summer to the current decadence of grilled foie gras with tiny oatmeal cookies, berries and home made strawberry ice cream. Talk about a symphony of different flavors and textures with sweet, savory, creamy, crunchy. It is pure joy!\\n\\nThey have eggs. They soft boil, poach, chicken fry, and scramble locally sourced chicken and duck eggs. This week, we devoured the soft scrambled duck egg with morels, white potatoes, radish slices, goat feta and green bean salad topped with a dill foam and arugula with a tad of lemon zest. It was smooth, creamy with a light tang of dill that complimented the feta and potatoes with an added crunch from the green beans.\\n\\nThere is always that one menu item, usually on the specials board, that I never want to try, yet the staff tells me it is one of the best things they have at the moment. This one was a corn battered pig face with mustard and pickled vegetables. So the idea of pig face had me remembering those whole roasted pigs at events I had been to and it conjured up a face looking back at me. The staff insisted it was fabulous, so we acquiesced and were not disappointed. Think pork \\"barbacoa\\" corn dog, only moist and shredded inside and melty-crunchy from the corn batter on the outside. There was not a pig face in sight, just the sight of our faces in sheer elated bliss.\\n\\nThey are always great about using local vegetables in season. I remember a summer heirloom tomato salad with goat cheese and melon that rocked my world. This week, they had a roasted beet salad with beet greens, mole, popcorn and goat cheese. They cooked up the pink, red and gold beets, so you had a nice array, from less sweet to sugary. The mole with goat cheese, greens and popcorn rounded out the Earthy beet as a nice contrast.\\n\\nTo sum it up, Barley Swine is that pleasurable experience that will leave you perfectly satiated, somewhat besotted, and wanting to come back the next day for another fix of euphoria!"},{"name":"Fin's Sushi & Grill","address":"62 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Not the literal BEST sushi I've ever had, but it was pretty good.

On the quite nights though this works out great for a casual beer and some conversation. They do have a small bar seating area that is cool if you want to sit next to the locals and gab with the bar tenders. The food offerings are certainly above average for bar food though they still are mostly the bar staples: fried or sandwhich.

It was also the last time I'll go there. My other two visits were to the Roswell Road location, but the experience was exactly the same. \\n\\nFlip Burger, from their exterior and interior design, to their menu options, and presentation in general, comes off as a hip and trendy place to go. These are its strong points. The outside is very unique and recognizable. The inside is bright, clean, and modern. You have a selection of seating ranging from the bar and traditional booths, to a less traditional, almost community style long tables. We sat in one of the community tables, and regretted it after a loud family with kids sat beside us. It saddens me to say, I almost prefer the hipster type places where there's a lesser chance of children, and general suburbia. You already see a disconnect with the intended image and the actual crowd. \\n\\nNext is their abundance of burger options on the menu. You have all sorts of meat varieties and still a good selection of more traditional burgers. I've had the Big Bison, The Double, and most recently, the Chorizo-- and they've all left me underwhelmed. There's nothing wrong with these burgers per say, but there's nothing that truly stands out or wows you. The flavors are OK, maybe good at best. That's the trouble though. For a burger place, you can't have a low ceiling for how good your dishes can be. On top of that, you don't get a side with your entree. Everything as \\"a la carte\\" as our server described. We did order the fries just to share between two people. Even they were very par at best. I'm normally a mindless muncher who will go through plates of fries or tots or chips. These fries were only half empty at the end of the meal. \\n\\nTheir former saving grace was the milk shakes. Ranging from Krispy Kreme to Nutella to Captain Crunch, these descriptions paint a decadent picture in your head. My first time having one a few years ago was actually pretty good. But the novelty has worn off. My Nutella shake was somewhat odd tasting. Not quite chocolate, DEFINITELY not the hazelnut flavor of Nutella, and very burnt marshmallows made for a dessert that I sadly left half empty (notice a trend?). My girlfriend's Krispy Kreme was even further away from the expected flavors of the iconic donut. \\n\\nI would like to end with one other pro. The staff was great. They greeted us, kept an eye on things, the food and check were given in a timely manner. However, it's the case of too little too late by the time you've had a chance to explore the food. With so many burger-centric places in town, and even typical American restaurants that have a few burgers of their own, I will have to pass on ever coming back to Flip Burger."},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Best brunch in Vancouver dt hands down.

The meat was cooked well and tasted like it was good quality; the English muffin was also pretty good (crispy on the outside, but pretty thick so it was soft inside). However, everything was a bit greasy. I didn't really like the spicy hollandaise, which was just hollandaise plus tabasco. The tabasco totally overpowered the taste of the hollandaise. I also added spinach to get some nutritional content, but it came raw -- it was a little hard to eat and tasted like a strange salad with hollandaise dressing, so I probably should have asked for it sauteed. The home fries were salty and cooked unevenly so that some were nice and crispy but others were slightly raw.\\n\\nThe Breakfast Club could hit the spot if you're in the mood for diner food, but not sure it will become one of my regular brunch places."},{"name":"Davis Square Pizza & Subs","address":"351 Highland Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"3","text":"I would love to be able to give this place 5 stars because their pizza is very yummy.

I became immediately cautious of the quality and safety of the food upon sitting at the bar and realizing that the restaurant was not very clean, nor were the employees upholding basic food safety standards. Before my waitress came to take my beverage order, the hostess brought me a glass of ice water containing white floating particles in it. I shrugged it off initially, because I hadn't ordered it nor was going to drink it to begin with. While sitting and waiting for some time for my server to arrive, I observed the surrounding in front of me. Behind the sushi bar, along the dirty, scuffed up back wall was a prep station littered with unorganized kitchen items, and large batch of noodles in a strainer strewn and left abandoned on the counter, leaving a sense that the staff clearly didn't adhere to any sort of cleanliness as well as left prepped food left sitting at room temperature, improperly stored. These practices were confirmed as I watched a staff member get cozy and eat her lunch on the sushi preparation counter in full view of customers, including picking up her noodles with her hands to dangle them and slurp them into her mouth. Over the same station that was going to have my food prepared. Next to her was the gentleman who was tasked with prepping my food. Before my waitress took my order I observed him standing in front of the raw sushi case texting on his cell phone. In the back of my mind I was reminded of the fact that our cell phones carry a host of germs from constant contact, and handling one and working with raw sushi wasn't the best idea, unless he put it away and proceeded to rigorously washed his hands. After my waitress took my order I proceeded to look forward as my food order was being printed on the ticket. The sushi chef tasked with making my food was the same man handling his cell phone. He put his cell phone away grabbed my ticket and proceeded to try to make my food without washing his hands. At this point, I got up, told my waitress to cancel my order and left. \\n\\n\\n *As a side note: I also did witness a man come up to the bar from the \\"back of house\\" with a bowl full of water and frozen fish in individual packages. This fish, though I wasn't able to verify, did appear to be a generic store bought bag of fish that one would buy in the freezer section of an H-E-B or Costco. The frozen fish by no means looked like it was a sushi grade fish. It is ill devised to ever make sushi with fish that is not of sushi grade, and you are far more likely to become ill from ingesting your standard fish from a grocery if eaten raw."},{"name":"The Breakfast Club","address":"270 Western Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"I really wanted to like The Breakfast Club, not only because of the rave reviews I read but also because I stood outside in the cold on a Sunday morning for 30 minutes waiting for a seat inside. \\n\\nI was seated at the counter (cozy, classic diner feel) and was warmly greeted by my waitress. I took a look over the menu and settled on The Basket Case which had a little bit of everything: 2 eggs, home fries, toast, bacon/sausage/or ham, and your choice of waffles or pancake. I got my eggs scrambled, ordered the sausage, and chose pancakes. \\n\\nThe food came out less than 5 minutes after placing my order. This was a little unsettling to me - the place was SLAMMED and I had literally just placed my order. But once the waitress confirmed it was indeed my food, I shrugged and began to eat. \\n\\nFirst off-putting thing: my home fries (diced potatoes with onions) were mostly undercooked and cold.

They have a breakfast menu, but I haven't had it in some time and therefore I'm not reviewing it at the moment. \\nI had the chicken fried steak and it was good.

One of the guests in our party ordered that and it seems like that recipe changed too. It used to come  with a good portion of shrimp and a sprinkling of sausage. Today had only a couple shrimp and half a hog worth of sausage. Not sure if that was intended or they were low on shrimp and threw in extra sausage or what.\\nLastly, they changed their meatloaf. This was the saddest development during today's lunch. The Coop was one of the few places I would order/eat meatloaf that wasn't made at home. If you've eaten here for a while you remember when the meatloaf was out on the counter and they cut you off a hunk of loaf with a Stihl loaf saw and plopped it down on a bed of mashed potatoes and it was amazing. It had ketchup cooked onto it and was wrapped in bacon and was a sight to behold. Today I learned those are now considered the glory days of The Coop's meatloaf. I recommended it before knowing about the change and one of my guests ordered it. When it came out I had to ask what was ordered. Let that sink in. I couldn't even recognize it. It must have been the look people had when they went to see Van Halen and it was Van Haggar. I saw two little brown rectangles that could have been confused for paper weights or door stops. Compared to the old loaf, Ray Charles would have flinched. To be fair, our guest liked it so maybe the taste is still there but the look is gone. \\nAssuming they haven't changed it, the chicken and dumplings were good as were the fried shrimp and fried chicken. \\nThey do still have the awesome tiny crushed ice ice machine, so that is probably worth a star in and of itself. \\nAgain, I'd say solid, but not thrilled with the changes. \\nEnjoy!"},{"name":"Bonfire","address":"50 Park Plaza","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"pricey. mac and cheese was my fave."},{"name":"Sushi By Yuji","address":"2252 Kingsway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"A no-fuss, authentic Japanese sushi joint that makes me cry literal tears of joy every time I pay them a visit.

At that point, we were drizzling it on every bite. Delicious!! \\nCan't wait to go back & try a few other ones!\\nAll the smoothies we've had have been great too. \\n\\nPROS: \\n*the food tastes fresh, flavor combinations are great, & the prize is just right!! (Most wraps are $6, salads $4 or $6 if you add protein)\\n*nice little area in the back with good lighting, comfy leather couches & few tables.\\n\\nCONS: \\n*none really!!

I was kind of sold on the place even before I tasted my burger (which was outstanding) just because it is operated so differently than most fast-food joints.  From an operations management standpoint, it was fascinating.  I want to go in there and do a case analysis for the Harvard Business Review. \\n\\nFirst off--it looks very very clean.  They had ten people on shift for the lunch rush. Nobody was standing around.  Everyone was busy and effeciently going about their tasks. There was no line, but it was pretty busy all the same.  When the second cashier was not busy, she quickly went to wash the front windows and clear tables and straighten up the dining area.  All the employees were native English speakers and not the sort of low-pay-scale people you might see at most fast-food places, so  am guessing that this company actually manages to pay a living wage to its employees.  This matters to me.  Furthermore the employees all looked liked they were enjoying their work.  Shouting occassional encouragements and almost cheering each other on as they worked.  \\n\\nSecond, this place does not aspire to be something it is not. It's a burger place. If you don't eat meat, this is not the place for you and it is not going to pretend to cater to you.  It has a simple, very easy to grasp menu--not too many different things--but lots of topping options.  For my fist time there, in the 30 seconds I waited for my order to be taken, the menu made it clear how to order what I wanted in the easiest manner possible.  I got  small burger \\"all the way\\" which is with all the normal toppings I might want - lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion, mushrooms, mustard, ketchup...etc... plus jalapenos...which were also available from a list below that.\\n\\nI took my burger to go... for a small it was pretty huge.  It was loaded with toppings, but it was wrapped in foil and therefor easy to eat without losing any of the contents.  I also had an order of Cajun fries which were actually spicey. I love spicey foods, so most things that pretend to be spicey I find bland.  These were really quite well seasoned.  The big order is more than enough for two people to share...I think we shoul have had a regular order to share. \\n\\nThird, the price was reasonable. I am guessing the average check per person is abou $10 for a burger, drink and an order of fries.  More money than McDonald's or Burger King...but a much better quality of food, too. (And employees that are Native English speakers--bonus).  I think this place compares favorably to a place like Kelly's Roast Beef as far as price and food quality goes... what I liked more about Five Guys was that their employees seemed so upbeat and that the place operated like a well oiled machine. It was impressive.  I am going to learn more about this company."},{"name":"Render Coffee","address":"563 Columbus Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I'm not a Render fanatic, but when I get bored of the cafes around Cambridge, I bike over here (yay Bicycle Benefits!) to work and sip a hazelnut latte.

And our drinks will mean we are spending significant money. So, that was offputting. But, we surveyed and enough people were interested in food, so we pushed on. \\n\\nUpon opening our menu, we saw an entire appetizer's worth of blue cheese within the menu. Eww. I generally found the food to be overpriced. They have a veggie burger that's over $13. Food quality was ok. I found the turkey burger to be spongey and the french onion soup was not bubbly and brown, but it was fine for bar food. \\n\\nThe waitress was attentive, as I said. She checked in a lot. However, another weird service thing was when I asked for the check,  with just our food, she seemed annoyed and said the whole check was together.

We know that going in and we accept it. But Brown Bag is on a whole other level. The sandwiches are pretty expensive and when the quality is factored in, it doesn't seem worth paying for. Between the two of us, we split a sandwich, shared a side of corn salad and a bag of Oh! Chips and a drink, and our bill was over $20!\\n\\nThe deli itself is tiny. We like intimate, but we hate stressful. Unfortunately, the size of BBD makes the experience stressful. The menu boards are off to the sides so you have to look at them before you approach the counter to order, which is good in theory, except that you're pretty much standing in the way of those who are ready to order given the layout of the interior. \\n\\nOnce you're ready to order, you're sort of bumped along by those whose orders are ready. And good luck trying to peruse the deli case for salads and sides. It didn't much matter to us though that we were being rushed and bumped on all sides as we tried to look into the deli case though because all of the sides and salads looked like they'd been there for days. It seriously reminded us of the Kroger salad bar. It was gross.\\n\\nWe rolled the dice anyway and ordered the \\"fresh\\" summer corn salad and it tasted about how it looked.

She did not wait on us but she was being watched because she had the table behind us. She was on top of her customer service and very attentive to all around.

This was served over a dry bed of angel hair.  Make it wet with tomato and you'll have your customers cleaning up the plate with bread.  Make this one change with the exact same type of chicken and I would return for it.   Actually I would crave it, with a thin marinara.  Otherwise it wasn't bad.\\n\\nBe proud of what you've created and always strive to improve in small ways that make a difference.  This 3 star rating is in no way a mark of a poor restaurant.

She said the potato was one of the best she's ever had, so there's that. Portion sizes are HUMONGOUS, mine was enough for 3 adult meals, and prices were a bit high (IMO). I have a hard time getting behind $22 for chicken/eggplant parmesan or $17 for a plain bowl of boxed pasta. They do not make any pasta in house, but they do make their own sauces. Perhaps if they made their portion sizes smaller the prices could shrink along with it.

As a frequent customer who also forgot the reward cards a lot, I had a lot of cards (that's hundreds of dollars I spent at the cafe). Still, I nodded my head in acknowledgment and the other lady, who was very nice, gave me my tasty order of pie and tea.\\n\\nI also didn't realize that they had made their closing time earlier. So, as I was studying and thinking I had another hour, the music suddenly started blasting INCREDIBLY LOUD. It was so uncomfortably loud. As I was packing my bag trying to figure out what in the world was going on -- I thought that people were leaving because of the music -- I realized that the closing hour was earlier. \\n\\nSecond Bad Experience: The last time I contacted the cafe was to order one of their delicious pies for somebody's birthday. It was a phone order and I was going to pick it up myself. \\n\\nWhen I confirmed the pie was available (key lime -- so delicious) and how much it would be, the lady's response was, \\"I'm not going to sell you the whole pie.\\"\\n\\nWow...really?\\n\\nSo, we didn't buy the whole pie. We bought a few slices, and I never went back.\\n\\nThis makes me sad as the vibe at Prosperity Pie was one of the things I love most on top of their absolutely delicious food. I don't know if I'll ever go back as I've been choosing other cafes to study at after these fairly rude experiences. In a way, I guess I've saved money by not going because I could never resist buying their pie.\\n\\nMaybe I will try again some day to see if the experience improves. I just haven't been able to bring myself to after the experiences described above.\\n\\nNote: For most places, these experiences would bring the stars down to a 1 or 2, but I kept it a 3 because their pies are still that good (give credit where it's due)."},{"name":"Barcelona Wine Bar South End","address":"525 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Went here on a recommendation and also saw the great reviews!

Nonetheless, I found myself back at this location on a Saturday night for the first time since the north location opened. Granted, every restaurant in the area was probably slammed on a Saturday night. So if you still do decide to come to this location, this might be the type of experience you would get.\\n\\nFirst up, crazy traffic with tiny parking spaces followed by super long line. The line was estimated to be 30 min but ended up being 70 min. Since it was still quite hot at 9pm, we ordered 2 shakes to cool ourselves down. 15 min later, we received our 80% melted \\"shakes\\". I know it was hot outside but not \\"that\\" hot. It was obvious that the shakes were prepared and then left on the counter for a while before being served.\\n\\nNow for the food. All the burgers came a little colder than usual. You can tell b/c all the cheese have already hardened on the patties. Once again, they were prepared but left on the counter for a while before being served. Same story for the fries. Instead of the usual fresh looking yummy fries, we got a full bag of tiny fries bits that were hard and crunchy. Pretty sad.\\n\\nOverall, the whole meal felt like an afterthought. It was still a good meal b/c we had good company and the burgers were just that good (even when slightly cold). But this was definitely my most disappointing Hopdoddy experience ever.

I guess the name \\"Gem√ºt\\" was chosen to imply Gem√ºtlichkeit/cosiness, which I sadly couldn't really find outside. It felt more like being in the backyard of a petty bourgeois gardener, who tried to do something special.

It's not that it's bad, but it's just not, what it's advertised as. They offer a vegan Bratwurst and \\"Kartoffelsalat\\", yes written in german, so that implies also it's made like a german Potato salad, with mayo and/or vinegar, onions, pickles and some fresh herbs. Who ever has eaten a german Kartoffelsalat, knows how yummy it can be. What we got were 5-6 dry fried potato slices. Absolutely nothing comparable to a Kartoffelsalat and a dry sausage, already cut in half (so it gets even more dry!?) Neither yummy or even slightly exciting for 16$! I ordered a red beet salad and what I got was all Arugula salad with 4 half slices of red beet, placed in the corners of the plate. Not what you want, when you think of a red beet salad for 8$ either! And it's an Arugula salad!\\nNow something positive...the beer and the cider were good, but the downside is, that you can't order another drink at the table, you have to walk yourself to the counter in the front and order and pay. No service at the table doesn't feel so cosy, somehow missing the essentials of what a beergarden should be.

Here's a tip--if you see any spots available at the bar, it's first-come-first-serve seating there. So if you are flying solo or just with a +1, there's a good chance you can usually find a bar seat and avoid the lines. You make all of your orders from the bar seat.\\n\\nOtherwise, you are going to be in line for several minutes... but that's not necessarily a bad thing, especially since it'll probably take you a while you figure out what you want since everything sounds so darn good! \\n\\nI had the Magic Shroom burger with kennebec fries and a Live Oak Hefeweizen beer. Everything was perfect. The burger had an overwhelmingly strong pesto taste to it, but what else do you expect from fresh pesto? I liked the burger, but I think I'll probably try something else next time. \\n\\nWhile everything was delicious and the atmosphere was fun, modern, and happy--I still think that the Cajun Bacon Burger from Tommy J's in Davis, California still ranks as the #1 best burger in the United States for me. Diablo Burger in Flagstaff, Arizona ranks at a close 2nd place. Hopdoddys, although definitely creatively tasty, comes up at around 3rd or 4th place right now.

The ribs were softer than others that I've tried. I know that people champion firmer ribs, but tender ribs are my jam. The brisket was amazing. I asked mostly for the moist cuts.

It's a little on the dim side with some accents of neon lights and flashes of the TVs that line the bar like a ring.

Hats off to them.\\n\\nFood: Can't really speak to this more than a few shared bites of appetizers -- typical pub americana fare: wings, burgers, fries, sandwiches, meat and potatoes -- most were serviceable but middle of the road.\\n\\nDrinks: There's a decent amount of beers on tap here -- nothing too hipster or rare -- but enough to satisfy most folks. They always have a few different Sam Adams, Harpoon, and other NE staple products along with the standard american light beers and a few surprises thrown in -- perhaps 25-ish beers on tap give or take. They have every typical type of liquor, as well, with a couple of varieties of each in the $20-$40 a bottle retail range. Wine seemed fairly generic enough that I couldn't recall the bottles but appeared to be Barefoot/Yellowtail-esque.\\n\\nPrices: This is where Whiskeys makes its mark -- the prices are fairly decent.

Once again he stated that it was only Pizza or Wings... and that he did not know who signed him up for Living Social, but he was trying his best to honor it, and \\"Help Us Out\\".\\n\\nWe told the guy to forget it, and told him we were leaving to eat somewhere else, and would be applying for a refund from Living Social.\\n\\nWith that we got up and walked out of the property.

We told him we weren't having attitude and just weren't interested in eating there if all they had were pizza and wings.  He continued to aggressively confront us, really scaring the kids!!!!

I love eating their hot wings, but hate every time I want to order a food delivery I forget what the flavors mean. I end up call the restaurant just to ask what they mean and I really don't like that, why can't they be the typical names? Also, I tend to order Kung Pao Chicken too and as long as I tell them not to make it's too spicy, I am a very happy person. I hate that I live so closes to this restaurant and end up too many nights ordering food I should be eating after 12am. If are able to drive over and pick up your food to go, I recommend it because it makes more sense to do that and the person on the phone with give you a great estimation of how long before your food will be ready. The honest reasons I took off some stars was my stomach always hurts the next morning after eating their food and I wouldn't eat their food if there was a better wing/kung pao chicken place open as late as them.\\n\\n\\nP.S. I have to definitely comment on some of the negative reviews too, if you are ordering food at 3am don't be so picky. You might get chicken fingers instead of tenders but is there really a big difference in that? You are getting chicken without bones right. Additionally, the reviewers that complain about having to paying extra for sauces you are getting pretty reasonably price wings so $0.50 will not break the bank more than the food you already order anyways. Those that don't know it's a Chinese run business and I believe family run too, the person you talk on the phone might has a hard time understanding you don't speak clearly after they have worked a 10 hour shift plus 5 to 7 days out of the week so please be respectful."},{"name":"Killer Burger","address":"2130 NE Allie Way, Ste 610","city":"Hillsboro","stars":"3.5","text":"Peanut butter bacon pickle burger is where it's at.

Nope.  \\nChicken - Very bland\\nGreen beans - very flavorful\\nSauerkraut - great flavor\\nRice - common flavor\\nGerman Potato Salad - enjoyable flavor\\nPasta salad - ok flavor\\nSalad bar - needs more toppings other than cheese, bacon bits, raisins, sunflower seeds, and croutons.  \\n\\nFinished with part of a cream puff.  If they would offer just a cup of the filling I would be happy.  No a huge fan of the puff part.  \\n\\nLets look back at the green beans on the buffet.  They have been cooked with corned beef and sp√§tzle however, my boyfriend ordered a Mama Ruben with a side of green beans which were not the same as what is on the buffet.  They were very al dente and he sent them back to have them cooked longer.  The waitress brought back the exact same green beans the same way.  He was very displeased he was not served what was on the buffet.  Why the difference?  Since the waitress could see he was not happy with what he was served, she allowed me to get a small plate of the cooked beans from the buffet and she took back the ones he did not like.  He very much appreciated it that she allowed us to do that.  \\n\\nI have German in me and with this being my first time trying the food, overall it is ok.  Not something I would seek out often.

He informed us that our group had not yet arrived, so we waited in the bar area. The bar waiter was friendly and helpful. The host came to find us in the bar area to inform us that our group was starting to shown up, that was nice. Then the bar waiter told us he would bring our appetizers to the function room.

I knew there was a going to be a lineup, but I didn't expect the wait to be so long for 2 people! We were quoted a time of 45 minutes so we put our names down on the waiting list and walked around before coming back to check in. We came back after 40 minutes and were called shortly after to a table. Finally! :)\\n\\nI loved the interior of the cafe! Their decor was vintage-like with a nice, wooden finish and they definitely made use of their space to seat as many people as possible. There was an open kitchen as well as a coffee bar right when you walk in, where you can just order drinks and pick up some Belgian liege waffles to go. The ambience was very lively and the workers were upbeat and friendly, keeping up with the mood.\\n\\nI heard their lattes and coffees were good, so I had to order something to drink! They also serve cocktails, wine, and other alcoholic drinks, if that's more your style ;) I opted for the London Fog ($4) and was really impressed! I had one at Nero Belgian Waffle Bar last week and I much prefer the one here at Medina. The tea flavour was stronger and more fragrant compared to Nero's, which was more milky.\\n\\nFor my dish, I ordered the Fricass√©e ($17). It had 2 sunny side up eggs, braised short ribs with some cheddar, roasted potatoes on a bed of greens, and grilled focaccia bread on the side. Wonderful presentation! I loved that this was served in a little iron skillet. The eggs were oh so good.. I love my egg yolks runny (and not with the gooey egg whites) and these were cooked perfectly. They were seasoned perfectly too. The short ribs were amazing too -- super tender, and my knife easily cut through it. All in all, I loved this dish. It was savoury from the cheddar and short ribs, tart from the little slices of apples and tomato-base sauce. I thought it was a very well put-together dish made from simple ingredients.\\n\\nNW ordered the Tagine ($16) with 2 poached eggs, spicy merguez sausage, chickpea stew with black olives, and grilled focaccia. Our server notified us that this would be very spicy but I didn't realize it would be THAT spicy! I was quite surprised when I took a bite of this... It had a lot different spices, like what you would find in Moroccan cuisine.  I wasn't a fan of this dish because I'm not really into these kinds of spices and it was much too spicy for me, but NW liked this better than mine, the Fricass√©e. To each his/her own :P However, I loved the poached eggs! They were cooked perfectly as well and the yolk just oozed out :D \\n\\nTo sum it up, I had a pretty good experience here at Medina. We just weren't too happy about waiting very long. Service was friendly though and they did their best to serve us as quickly as possible, given how busy the restaurant was. NW didn't really think it was worth all the hype to line up for that long, but I actually wouldn't mind going back again and trying more of their drinks and waffles! Maybe next time I'll go earlier as soon as it opens, although I'm sure there will be several people in line already. :P\\n\\nFood - 8/10\\nService - 7/10\\nAmbience - 8/10\\nValue - 7/10"},{"name":"Ghion Ethiopian restaurant","address":"2080 Cheshire Bridge Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Ghion, you have fed me so much injera, I had to roll out the front door.

Overall, good, tasty, well-made \\"red sauce\\" neighborhood Italian cuisine, like you would hope to find, and it's byob too.\\n\\nThe signature dish is still the meatballs, which are excellent (your Italian grandmother wold be happy to serve them).\\n\\nAs far as the rest of the menu (some of these were specials), among other things I've tried the steak, rack of lamb, house-made pastas with tomato sauce, 4-meat ragu or vodka sauce (fettuccini, gnocchi, lobster-crab ravioli) and panna cotta, and was happy with all of them.  The steak was properly cooked to temp, and while not high-end steakhouse-quality, it was still a pleasurable accompaniment for some great red wines.\\n\\nOur service was friendly and attentive (we were served by the hilarious sous chef who grew up in the area the first time, and by newly hired Michelle on our second visit).  The owners were in the house and the husband Robin was very personable and fun.  It is a small, comfortable space, but can be a tad noisy if crowded, but still pleasant.  There is a muted TV over the small bar (obviously not serving alcohol).\\n\\nYeah, Rino's across the street is famous thanks to \\"wonder-awful TV chef/bloated punk-pop hedgehog person Guy Fieri,\\" (to quote the Globe), but I actually think the food at Saratoga is just as good (especially those meatballs, which leave Rino's in the dust).  And you don't have to wait in line forever to get a table at prime time.\\n\\nAND IT'S LEGAL BYOB, in fact, the only one in Boston (see below for details)!!!  So it deserves 5-stars just for that in my book!\\n\\nHouse wine glasses are serviceable (better than Rino's), but if you really care, bring your own stems like I do.  They also prefer to open your wine, keep it at the bar, and pour it for you, but I convinced them to let us do that ourselves, which we like to do.  Sit along the window, where the ledge make a nice place to put your wine bottles, leaving more space for big plates of food.\\n\\nAs you will see from some earlier reviews, Saratoga originally also offered a selection of Latin dishes (the chef is Latino).  But there wasn't much demand for them in an Italian restaurant, so although they are still listed on the laminated menu, they are no longer available.\\n\\nNote: Their website seems to have been taken over from another restaurant, and wasn't accurate for a long time, but seems to be improving.  For example, there's a link to OpenTable, but you have to call for reservations, although one of the two phone numbers is incorrect.\\n\\nRelative to other Italian byob options in the Boston area, I'd rate Sam's Kitchen in Woburn #1, followed by Nappi's in Medford and 300 Saratoga, which are fairly similar in quality.\\n\\nFor a primer on \\"WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT BYOB IN MA\\", click on my earlier review below.\\n\\nFinally, I find the recent Internet phenomenon of people who have never been to a particular business, and often have little or no direct knowledge of the particulars, posting attacks on Yelp and other social media for political or other reasons is an unfortunate and very sad commentary on the state of our society.  It's clearly too much trouble for the social media couch potato police to get off their asses and actually have go have a conversation, you know, face-to-face with someone, which might actually clear the air or result in some actual positive change (or even organize a live protest in necessary).  No, they'd rather just hurl insults from the safety of their couches like 8 year-old school children. \\n\\nIt is unfortunate to note that 300 Saratoga is currently the subject of attacks on Yelp over some questionable commentary posted on Facebook by someone involved in the restaurant.  At the very least the restaurant has other employees and their families who are affected by any backlash regarding the alleged personal opinions of another person. I'm updating my 5 star review since I visited again and it is factually about the food/service/byob and not the private lives of owners/employees (including unrelated legal issues from the distant past of this person).  However, maybe it is hypocritical of me, but the whole thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth about the restaurant anyway. Which is what the social media couch potato police wanted. So I guess you win."},{"name":"Veracruz All Natural","address":"2505 Webberville Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Okay, yes, ordering tacos here is not for those on a tight schedule.

MOD is certainly not a ma and pa store, they're a very large national chain. Regardless, I do like the build your own concept that so many other pizza places are adopting. MOD does have a good variety of choices for toppings and sauces, along with artichoke hearts which many pizza places don't offer. \\n\\nORDERING ONLINE: \\nEasy and error free via mobile phone or computer. Making your choices are as simple as checking boxes and adding a note if needed. You pay before placing the order so you'll need a credit or debit card and can write in any tip amount along with the pre selections. Received a confirmation via eMail showing all of the selections along with the tab.\\n\\nTHE ORDER:  \\nArrived on time for the scheduled pickup and everything was ready to go, staff was pleasant. (1) 11\\" inch pizza with a medium assortment of toppings, (1) Cinnamon Sugar Puff Bread - Caramel, side or ranch and a Mexi-Coke in the bottle. Pizza was hot, drink was cold and the sides were in the boxes. Easy. $8 dollars and some change for a large personal pizza is a deal in my books. \\n\\nIN SUMMARY:  \\nAs far as the pizza goes, I'd say it was just okay but nothing stellar. Solid flavors, decent amount of toppings and cooked just right with a crispy on the outside and soft on the inside dough. This is not a thick crust or heavily loaded toppings type pizza, although they do offer a thicker crust. In similar comparison, I actually like the flavors of California Pizza Kitchen quite a bit more (although twice the price), they are very similar in style, presentation, size and texture. Where MOD seems to fall short is actually in the dough/crust, it's really not that great. It's more like a giant flour tortilla that's been baked, you can really tell if you get the side puff breads. Looks like a flour tortilla and tastes like one. The only thing they missed on my order was the fresh basil, it was on the receipt and confirmation but it was not on the pizza. The sugar puff bread was the real disappointment, they could really amp it up by deep frying it or adding a light butter glaze. Again, it just looked and tasted like a baked flour tortilla, wasn't terrible but nothing astonishing. It was also not pre-sliced as indicated by their website. Carmel dip was good and plenty sweet. Their ranch dressing is decent, it's a little smoother but less mayo-like than the usual Hidden Valley ranch. Cane sugar non-high fructose Mexi-Coke is the way to go, a little higher priced here than other places. The establishment was clean and roomy with an industrial modern styled interior. Plenty of parking with two disabled spots just right of the entrance. All in all I'd come here again, but I can't say it's the best pizza around.

And based on the other patrons  that were there that night (and yes, their ages, as half were definitely older than us and the others were much younger), I don't think it was their kind of tunes either.

That cost us a $25 ticket from Park Atlanta, though I saw no signs saying no parking... anyway.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, we put our name in for lanes, and we were told a 3 hours wait.  We were waiting for the rest of our 12 person party to arrive, so we headed to the bar.  At first, the bartender seemed standoffish and disinterested in serving us.  I ordered us a gin punch and a champagne cocktail.  Friends already there had some hummus.  The gin punch was great - not sweet, plenty of citrus, and really easy to drink too much too quickly.  The hummus was a generous serving with fresh veggies and pizza dough points.\\n\\nWe debated going elsewhere since there was business to transact, which didn't seem like a great idea with all the noise of the music and the bowling.  But we stuck around, tempted by the other games, which we never actually played.  Having made that decision, we grabbed some lounge space by the bar, designed for those waiting for lanes.  When you sit in the lounge space, you order at the bar.  So I headed there to order the meatball queso fundido, the 3 tacos (chicken, fish, and steak), and the Buckhead Betty pizza.  The queso fundido arrived quickly.  It was really good - a nice ratio of sauce and melty cheese with plenty of corn chips.  I recommend.\\n\\nAbout the time that the tacos and pizza arrived, we were called on to fill out our cards and our shoe sizes because we were getting our lanes!  So just know that a 3 hour wait is an estimate, and with numbers like those, others might be scared off so that you get your lane earlier.  Once you get a lane, you have a server to take all your orders.  We carried our drinks and food over to lanes 17 & 18.  The pizza was good, but too watery with the mushrooms and spinach on top - it needed more cooking time just to drive off all that water.  The tacos were ok, nothing amazing.  I think the fish was my favorite, but it's hard to recall.\\n\\nAs for the bowling - you've got 1 hour, and when time is up, that's it, so you do really need to keep moving, particularly if you've got a full lane of 6 people.  Your shoes are delivered to your lane in a tote.  They've got a decent assortment of balls and more at the front as needed.  Your server can correct anything wrong with the lanes in addition to taking your orders.  Our server warmed over time, and even got me a 9 when trying to correct the game getting off frame.  \\n\\nMy problem with the lanes is the deep couches with minimal room between the couch and the table.  Every time you went to bowl, everyone had to get up, since there wasn't enough room between the table and the couch to get past with someone seating.  And with the deep couches, it was somewhat challenging to get up.  I ended up sitting on the back of the couch once I'd finished my food.  They could easily have made the couches 6\\" shorter and saved a lot of discomfort.\\n\\nWhen our time ran out, we transferred to the large communal table to complete our business.  At that point, we were back to ordering drinks and food from the bar.  You have to close your tab each time - they don't transfer.\\n\\nWhile very trendy and hipster, I think that's the clientele, rather than the actual employees.  Yes, it's expensive, but it is Buckhead, and the food is pretty good.  I'm not eager to go back, but I don't regret the evening."},{"name":"Buffet Palace","address":"4608 West Gate Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Buffet Palace is just what you would expect, lots of cheaply made americanized chinese food.

For all who only eat boneless chicken, please know that there is a REASON why fried chicken is best on the bone and Chef Doug understands it. Everything (and I do mean everything) was delicious. My trout was seasoned perfectly and rested on the most perfect bed of al dente black eyed peas and fantastic sauce. The chicken was perfectly moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside. The salad was the perfect start to the meal (if you love bleu cheese, you'll flip for this salad), and the baked Alaska was the perfect finish. \\n\\nI also have to give a shout out to our amazing server Ali who was warm and friendly and could basically read our minds.

We waited in line for about 15-20 minutes and the bbq is served cafeteria style, as mentioned in previous reviews. You scoop the sides that you want, and pay different prices for the different size containers. If you're really good compacter, then you can probably get a lot of bang for your buck by compacting a bunch of delicious sides into the small size tray/container. Then you choose your meat or sandwich or bbq course and they will cut and place it on your tray. Finally you check out.\\n\\nI must say, the atmosphere is really fun. I like the honky tonk decor and they have a lot of wine and beer options.

Having grown up in the New Haven, CT area I was familiar with their location there but I had never had the chance to go despite their phenomenal reputation.\\n\\nTo begin with, Barcelona is decorated impeccably.  The decor is modern and on point, and the restaurant is dimly lit.  At the entrance of the restaurant there is a large, circular white marble wine bar which I can absolutely picture myself enjoying wine and cheese at during a future visit. \\n\\nWe were seated at a fantastic table around 7:30pm on a Tuesday.  Good thing we made a reservation because the restaurant was PACKED at that time.  I did not see one open seat at the bar or in the rest of the dining area during our whole time there. Very impressive for early weeknight dinner - a good sign of the experience to come. \\n\\nI ordered the white sangria to begin, which was good but might try something else next time. We had the jamon serrano and a buttery semi-soft cow's cheese to start which was absolutely perfect with the complementary warm pieces of bread and olive oil.\\n\\nThe two of us shared the kale salad with cranberries and quinoa (AMAZING), the Potato Tortilla with chive sour cream, and the Truffle Bikini with jamon serrano and san simon cheese.  The standout was the Grilled Hanger Steak with truffle vinegarette which had perfectly cooked pieces of medium-rare steak.  So flavorful - a must order!\\n\\nAnd just because we did not want this fabulous meal to end, we ordered the churros for dessert.  This was a MASSIVE portion of about 4-5 large churros, accompanied by warm chocolate. \\n\\nWe were around average hunger levels the night of our meal, and we ate every single thing in front of us except for about 3 churros which we took home. \\n\\nCan't wait to come back for another dinner and try some new things, or for brunch!

And because it's very near the T -- Alewife on the Red Line -- I agreed. Unfortunately, unless you know where you're going, the restaurant sign (which is visible from the station) is dangerously misleading. I headed on-foot toward the sign but found that it wasn't at the entrance of the restaurant; instead, it was on the edge of a very busy road with no way to navigate to the entrance of the restaurant, which is on the far side of a large industrial area, a very long circuitous way away, a fact I discovered unintentionally when I found myself climbing up a loading dock and passing the dumpsters in a dark empty area -- think Yelp Noir! Why not an Enter Here sign visible from a distance? Because those running Summer Shack have never put themselves in the shoes of the guest, a problem that is also evident in their service protocol. \\n\\nWhen I got inside, however, I was pleasantly surprised, happy to have the Hitchcockian trek behind me. The ambiance wasn't as chain-ish as I expected. The wooden bar was nicely located in a u-ish shape, with a clear view of the raw options -- oysters, clams, etc. Good draft beer selections. Good solid bar seats. The lights were low, the music pleasing. And in the middle of the large space, a large tank of live lobsters. It didn't feel like a cheap summer eats kinda place. \\n\\nThat impression didn't last long, unfortunately. I sat at the bar and waited for my friend. When he arrived, we started perusing the menu, which is like a lot of relationships: complicated. They had bar specials, but it was difficult to tell which items were on special and for how much. We thought about ordering lobster or some of the daily catch options, but there were no prices on any of those. The two of us -- old pros at eating out -- couldn't navigate the menus. (I know! I know!) When we asked the barkeep about the missing prices, she directed us to a chalkboard on the far side of the restaurant to see prices. I'm not talking ten-feet away. (Let's just say it was closer to the loading dock than it was to the front door.) Can you imagine sitting down for a meal with menu in hand and trying to decide what to get and then you find out that for half of the options you have to get out of your seat and walk fifty feet and crowd beside other dinners who are sitting at their tables eating their food while you shift from one foot to the other trying to decide what to order? It might be called Summer Shack but this isn't a fast food place, nor are the prices. If they're going to charge like it's real food, they need to start treating customers like they're in a real restaurant. How difficult would it be to make available a few price lists -- otherwise known as menus? You know what makes this unforgivable? They tout the fact that their menu changes daily. Not just the lobster and fancy chalkboard stuff but the printed stuff, too. So why not print it all in one place?\\n\\nTo add to this, the bartender was snippy and unhelpful. After awhile, she was replaced with a second bartender who was perfectly helpful and congenial. Whew. (You'll be okay if you get the right server.) We ended up having a decent time. We ordered off the menu we could see -- not the one on the far wall -- and the food was okay. The very popular fra-diavolo mussels weren't very spicy. They forgot part of our order -- the Yelp check-in app: French fries with chowder. A few other things but, all in all, nothing memorable. \\n\\nWhat is memorable is that the raw chef (a.k.a. the kid shucking the oysters) dumped out the brine of every oyster he prepped. Dumped it like in the trash. Down the drain. Kaput. At first, I was watching because he was right there -- it's a cool view and a cool way to make use of space -- but when I realized what he was doing, I was in horror. I wanted to yell stop! no! save the savory liquid!! I didn't, of course, but it made me wonder who else is doing what in this pricey tourist trap. \\n\\nI would go back but only if I were on the T and it somewho broke down in the middle of a blizzard and it was happy hour and I was thirsty. \\n\\ntl;dr: Average food, above average prices, and no reason to settle for this in Boston."},{"name":"Bukhara Indian Bistro","address":"3698 Washington St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"3.5","text":"My son and I ventured into Bukhara on a late Monday afternoon. It was about 4PM. The place was empty, since we came in before the dinner hour. We got our usuals, the chicken tikka masala, vegetable korma and chicken korma along with garlic naan and rice. My son had some cheese pakora too. Everything was quite good. We were asked how spicy we wanted it, and we said medium. I wouldn't have said that the spice was truly medium. It was more average buffet strength food. Not weak, but far from spicy. \\n\\nWhile the kormas were good, with a nice nutty sauce, the tikka masala really struck me as the best dish we had. It was a nice tomato-y sauce, very flavorful.  The Paneer Pakoras were excellent, nice and fresh, unlike Ian L's paneer pakoras. I would have to say, one of the better versions I've had recently. Often the cheese pakoras can be reheated and you can tell, but ours were nice and fresh. \\n\\nThe price was about average, about $12.95 per entree, and I will say that the serving size was very good. We ordered a good amount of food, but I brought leftovers home. I went to Ghazal recently and found their portion size was pretty small, so the portion size at Bukhara was welcome. \\n\\nMy son and I decided next time we were in JP we would come back to Bukhara.

Their food was so yummy at the event, that I knew I had to go by and have a full meal.  And now that I work in the area, Desta is very convenient for lunch.  What isn't convenient is that Desta isn't very big and it seems to always have a full house whenever I stop by. But the sun does shine on my face every once in a while so I've had my chances to eat at Desta.  \\n\\nI've had the tibs with chicken, rice, gomen (collards), miser (lentil stew), and injera (bread). The rice is very spicy, which I love, love, love; the injera is cold and soft, and not a good match for the dishes I've had.  The chicken has a great flavor and is balanced nicely with the spicy rice, and you can have your meat choice cooked in their signature spice - awaze, which is definitely spicy but doable for a person who eats spice all the time, not so much for a newbie.  The collards are stewed but still firm and delicious, and the miser puts lentils on a whole new level.  Vegetarians should love this place.\\n\\nThey have a dessert case with lovely cakes and tarts and all the yummy things my mouth loves and my butt hates.  I've had the cream puff - which has a creamy custard in the center with a flaky shortbread pastry type of crust.  The combination of the cream and pastry textures is so wonderful in the mouth.  *sigh*  I've also had several versions of cream and puff pastry cakes which are not overly sweet and very pleasing to eat.\\n\\nThey also have liquor here and abundant free parking, so I'm pretty much in love.  \\n\\nMy only issue with this place (and why it isn't 5 stars) is the service.  Gawd, these ladies are as slow as sea turtles.  And this can be very frustrating when you have to go back to work.  They check on you in the beginning but once you get your food, you can forget it.  You'll have to chase them down for everything - more water,  your check, dessert, everything that comes after your meal arrives. But the food is so friggin' good you just have to put up with it (or order takeout.)\\n\\nDesta always having a crowd is completely understandable now that I've experienced it for myself, so be warned.

I also had a massive cream puff to go.\\n\\nMy favorite sausage was the Bahama Mama, with the Bratwurst in second place. The Milder Mama simply paled in comparison to the spiciness of the Bahama Mama and the Knockwurst was kind of flavorless. The brat had very good texture to it with nice small chunks of meat to chew on. The Bahama Mama had this spiciness that lingered in your mouth and enhanced the flavor of the meat and spices, but blew out everything I had afterwards.\\n\\nThe cream puff was huge. But it was very very tasty. But towards the end the sweetness was overwhelming me.\\n\\nBeer selection is lacking.\\n\\nWhile the platter is cheaper than the buffet, the buffet includes half price desserts, so in the end, I think I ended up paying about the same price. I probably should have gotten the buffet simply for the greater volume of food. But I also didn't have to keep getting up.

We shifted to different bars after Champions redecorated.  Yes, the setup is nicer but it became more of a scene.  It lacked true football fans and except for a contingent of Eagles fans' in a private room, few people wore jerseys.  Yet, it was still crowded and we were constantly negotiating with the staff for a table and TV.\\nFor Week #2 of this football season, my girlfriend and I visited the new Champions location at the Kendall Square Marriott.  It held several advantages of the Copley location.  \\nFirst of all, the place was nearly empty.  When we walked in around 4 o'clock during Week #2, we had no trouble finding a table.  And this was a week the Patriots played late as well.  \\nAs a Dolphins fan living in New England, I worry about wearing my jersey in these highly polarized times.  The advantage of Champions is that there are fewer locals cheering for the Patriots.  There was one table of Patriots fans, but nobody else in the place seemed to be watching football at all.  As a result, we got customized TVs; Dolphins on multiple TVs viewable from our table.\\nThe food is higher quality bar food.  I recommend the nachos with barbeque pulled pork.  Unlike chili, the pork doesn't get the chips soggy.  Plus the sweet sauce compliments the cheese so that each chip is like a mini-pizza BBQ pizza.  We also ordered the chicken finger appetizer.  They were crispy, plump white meat far better than the average bar chicken finger and came with multiple dipping sauces.\\nOnce people start discovering this location, it may lose some of its charm.

But the food is all over the place. First, the wonton soup is extremely salty; it's not even custom-made soup, legit just chicken broth. Just chicken broth. Pork belly ramen... salty. Chicken tikka masala... over spiced, couldn't even eat it, because of how souped-up the spice was. The pork belly taste like candy, because they drizzle teriyaki sauce on it. Also, side note... adding kimchi to a dish doesnt make it a \\"Korean\\" dish If the dish is called \\"Korean BBQ Ribs\\" then I expect Korean-style beef ribs aka Kalbi (or Galbi), not \\"St. Louis-style ribs\\". Adding on, calling another one of your dishes \\"Korean Surf n Turf\\", because it has \\"Korean Butter\\" (whatever that is LOL) doesn't make that dish Korean either; it's just a classic surf n turf, nothing else.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I appreciate what Disney is trying to do, really. I think it's awesome to find an American theme park integrating different aspects of ethnic culture by introducing people to other kinds of food. I only wished that Disney did a better job in it. A major problem I noticed in the menu designer's choice when it came to deciding what dishes to provide, it was very messy, in other words, all over the place. There was Indian style food, Japanese style, Chinese, Korean-American fusion, and etc. The problem is that it's not focused.

Not enough to make it a vegetarian destination, but certainly enough so that vegetarians won't feel left out if they go there with omnivores.\\n\\nIt's certainly a cut above Kung Fu Buffet in Pflugerville, with much better decor, lighting, and ambiance, but then again it's about $3/person more expensive than Kung Fu, and I guess you get what you pay for.  Interestingly, Buffet Palace and Kung Fu both have 3-star Yelp ratings as I write this, even though Buffet Palace is clearly classier.  I chalk up the similar ratings to the price (Kung Fu gets extra points for being cheaper, and Buffet Palace loses points for not providing an even better experience given how much extra it costs.)\\n\\nI was inclined to give it five stars except my wife pointed out the food is often not very hot, as other reviewers have noted."},{"name":"Maenam","address":"1938 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"food simply amazing!

I've tried a lot of the barbecue places that Austin has to offer and I haven't had a better one than this.  I can't visit Austin without coming here (at least once a trip).

I only sometimes put sauce on the brisket, it's so good it can stand on its own without any sauces, but sometimes it hits the spot.  For my side, I typically get the mac and cheese, which always tastes like it has fresh, real cheese.\\n\\nMy only complaint would be how popular this place has become!  I typically make my way down to Austin once a year and until this year, the line hasn't been too long, but this past time I went the line was out the door and it seems like they had sold out of some things!

(By the way, am I the only one who didn't know Barcelona was a chain?  I was shocked when I learned that there are several more of it up and down the East Coast.)  Walking into this place instantly makes you think you are at the beach.  Actually the atmosphere is hands down five stars beach bar.  It's better than any authentic at the beach spot I've been to in recent years.  Bartaco has a total Tommy Bahama, classy, cool beach vibe to it.  The outside patio is killer.  They have those fantastic white patio lights strung overhead.  If this were the early 2000s and in California, a scene from The O.C. would have totally been filmed here.  I want to move in.\\n\\nAdmittedly I am a lover of aesthetics and atmosphere, but the food and service was just as great as the beachy d√©cor.  We arrived at 6:00 on a Saturday in hopes of beating the crowds and were promptly seated.  By 9:30 when we left, the entire restaurant both inside and the patio were slammed.  Our server was friendly and knowledgeable of the menu.  You actually put your order card or dragonfly card in the metal holder thing whenever you are ready to order or need assistance.  It's kind of genius because this way even if your server isn't readily accessible, another one can easily drop by to take care of your table.  Did I mention the servers all wear adorable navy gingham shirts and white denim?  I loved this detail because this outfit is literally a summer wardrobe staple and it's a miracle I didn't show up matching the help.\\n\\nNow for food and drinks themselves, My friend had a Port Chester Reviver, and I quickly followed suit.  Gin + cucumber + mint + mango nectar + lime juice on a hot summer night = purely refreshing libation.  We decided to forgo apps and head straight for the main course (BTW this is the only Mexican-ish restaurant I've ever been to that doesn't offer queso).  We each opted for the rice bowl.  It's the perfect amount of fresh cooked rice, vegetables, and shrimp for $7.  Their fried plantains are also phenomenal.  I was too full from my $11 worth of food, but I find it absolutely adorable that they offer ice cream cones for dessert.\\n\\nIn short, the atmosphere is absolute perfection.  We are talking way cooler atmosphere than its outrageous Westside neighbor The Optimist.  The food was really good and cheap.  It's the same price as Tin Lizzy's food, but way better.  I can't wait to go back to try the tacos.  I have absolutely no doubt that once all of Atlanta finds out about Bartaco it is going to be just as crowded if not more than Barcelona.

We were seated and sat for a while waiting for the waitress to come over.  The waitress finally showed up to take our order.  The only problem was that we were never given menus.  She seemed mildly annoyed that we needed menus and went to get them.    \\nWe asked the waitress whether they could make a pizza that was half pepperoni and half just cheese because my daughter doesn't like pepperoni.  She said that they could, but it would be the same price as a pepperoni because they would put twice as much pepperoni on one side and just cheese on the other.  Perfect, that's fine with us!  So, we ordered steak tips and a half pepperoni half cheese pizza.  It took about 40-45 minutes to get our food.  The steak tips were OK.  Super bland but edible.  The waitress brought the pizza, told us very confidently which half was cheese, and then left.  So, my daughter grabbed a slice from the half that the waitress told us was cheese.  The only problem was that the entire pizza was pepperoni, not half cheese as we had ordered.  We tried to take off the pepperoni, but there was so much of it that it was impossible because they put the pepperoni under the cheese rather than on top (which also makes for soggy pepperoni!).   So, I flagged down the perpetually annoyed waitress and told her that the whole pizza was pepperoni. She says, almost yelling, \\"you ordered half pepperoni.\\"  I said, \\"yes, that's the problem.  The whole thing is pepperoni.\\"  At that point, she gets really annoyed, throws her hands in the air, and says \\"Well, I don't know what to tell you, I told them that it was supposed to be half cheese.  You can eat what's there or I can try to order another one, but it's going to take at least 30-35 minutes, and I don't know if you want to waste your time sitting here!\\"  She is, for some reason, yelling at me at this point.  \\n\\nTotally baffled, I look at her and say something like \\"You messed up the order, and now you're essentially telling us \\"just deal with it?\\"\\"  She replies, \\"I didn't mess up anything!  I told the kitchen that you wanted half cheese.   Mistakes happen.  I don't know what to tell you.\\"  The waitress is gesticulating somewhat wildly at this point.  It was very strange and quite unlike any experience I've had at a restaurant before.   \\n\\n So, we ended up not eating the pizza, paying for the steak tips and drinks, leaving and going home to eat leftovers.    By the way, they charge for refills on sodas so if you get refills, be prepared to pay as much for your soft drinks as your do for your pizza!\\n\\nWe like to patronize local, family businesses.  I really wanted to love this place, but any meal that involves a waitress who is so hostile that it results in your child crying at the table doesn't deserve anyone's business in my opinion.\\n\\nMr. Santarpio, is this the kind of experience you would want for your family if you took them to a new restaurant for the first time?"},{"name":"Mom'z Kitchen","address":"307 W Kennedy Blvd","city":"Eatonville","stars":"4.5","text":"My goodness was this place amazing!!!

Weird!\\n\\nI also felt rushed the entire time, especially with ordering... Maybe it was a language barrier... I definitely wanted more vegetables than what we received... I was not full from our \\"order\\".\\n\\nFinally, the bill... Not at all impressed with $40 and all we ordered were two waters, an entree that we spilt, and one glass of honey wine....

Lately however, the customer service is so poor that I truly feel like it's not worth it to go anymore. Let's start with what happened today- it was 915pm, they close at 10. As we walked in, the hostess, Christina, asked how many and my girlfriend said \\"two\\" and also put 2 fingers up. Then Christina said something and my girlfriend thought she asked where we wanted to sit. So she started telling her we would like to sit on the bar side and pointed to a table. Christina cut her off, threw up her hands and said \\"how many?!\\" With a lot of attitude- very uncomfortable. She also mentioned that they close at 10.. Then she walked us to our table, I said thank you very much and she just rolled her eyes. NO idea where this came from or if maybe it was just a bad day but you've got to hang in there until the end and treat all customers with respect. I rarely write reviews but this is in addition to a few other issues recently, i feel like something should be said. \\nNext i want to talk about the tasty margaritas. They have this point system for alcohol and this is what they use to cut people off. You get a total of 6 points per day. The purple margarita is 3 points, all other frozen margaritas are 2. Some flavors (coconut and banana for example) are not as strong as the other margaritas because they use the regular house lime margarita but have to leave some out to add the flavoring in. So i used to order half purple, half coconut (yum!). I also LOVE banana, but you can definitely tell that this is not nearly as strong as the other margaritas that they have pre-made in the machines. Well half purple half  coconut used to be 2 points and i could order 3. Now it's 3 points just like a regular purple margarita! Now I'm a pretty big guy and i RARELY drink .. and to be honest, baby A margs are just about the only thing I'll drink anymore with alcohol in it, just because i like the taste of them. But when i order and get cut off after my second drink because of their lousy point system, i get irritated. I'm sick of writing and i know this won't make a difference as the management at these places sucks (except for James at the stone lake location, he's awesome!) but strictly speaking of the Howard location- and while on the topic, Roxanne is completely irrational, rude, and apparently quick to fire employees (you should see the turnover rate here.. become a regular and see for yourself- word of mouth from employees plus what you  see yourself will confirm this).

We were glad we came here, although we did agree that we had better BBQ elsewhere. \\n\\nWhen we arrived, we had to wait in a long line. However, the line moved fast and got our food within 40 minutes. The staff was super friendly and happy, which put us at ease during the wait. My husband and I ordered the beef rib, fatty brisket, jalapeno and cheese sausage, and turkey along with three sides: creamed corn, baked pinto beans, and mac and cheese. My brother-in-law (BIL) and his girlfriend ordered beef rib, lean brisket, and jalapeno and cheese sausage along with creamed corn and mac and cheese. Usually, we would order the pork ribs, but they were out by the time we arrived\\n\\nThe surprising hit was the turkey (our favorite meat). Second was the fatty brisket, third was beef ribs, and fourth was the sausage. Our favorite side was the creamed corn, second was the mac and cheese, and third place was the baked pinto beans. Usually, it is difficult to cook turkey as it can be easily overcooked.  Nevertheless, the turkey was moist and smoky. The fatty brisket was way better than the lean one and had pretty good flavor. We all agreed that the beef brisket's outside rub was too salty.  However, the inside was moist and delicious. The sausage was just fine, but it unfortunately came in last compared to the other meats. The creamed corn was fantastic with flavor and balanced the fattiness of the meats. The mac and cheese was slightly above average, although it did not have the wow factor that would obligate me to order it again. The pinto beans had that wolf-brand chili flavor infused to it, which gave it the slight edge from sub-standard. \\n\\nOverall, I liked Terry Black's BBQ but would not rank it in my top tier of Texas BBQ. Nonetheless, the staff made the experience more enjoyable which bumped up the rating.  If I return here, I would only get the turkey, fatty brisket, and creamed corn. Maybe I'll order the pork ribs to see what I was missing."},{"name":"bartaco","address":"969 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"A very cool experience, its a beautiful place. You sit down and check on a piece of paper what you desire. The tacos are tiny, but the Baja fish taco is amazing!

The sausage wasn't the pork sausage I expected, it was close to a hot dog but hey it still tasted good. What made it even more banging was the sauces they have. They had this creamy jalape√±o sauce that i highly recommend it really adds a medium kick! But the tacos without it were just as good.

But the restaurant was 1/3 full, so they gave in, and wanted to seat us in the bar.  I asked why, and they said it was because the dress was business casual.  I questioned what that meant because I couldn't imagine what we were wearing that was much different than rest of diners, but they could not specify.  They eventually sat us in the dining room.  The food that we ordered was really good - we did the tasting menu and got the octopus and scallops appetizers, both were amazing.  We got branzino for our entree.  The server talked up the cooking method where it is encrusted in salt, so that was what we ordered.  However, it did not come cooked that way.

However, the menu is decently sized with many options for anyone who has 0 eating restrictions. I ended up ordering a couple of street tacos in corn tortillas. Not bad, but certainly not worth the $5 a piece they cost. The drinks weren't bad, but they were a bit pricey, too at about ~12 a piece. The staff was pretty attentive even when busy. The restaurant itself seemed really clean, the bathrooms were nice, and the location was close to other places.

We had two arepas that were served in a traditional corn wrap (think hamburger bun, but made out of corn). The housemade hot sauce paired nicely with the smokey flavors from the grill. We shared the hearts of palm salad which actually came with bacon-wrapped dates. If you're vegetarian you can easily hand over these neatly wrapped meat packages to your significant other. \\n\\nAs for drinks they serve my favorite: Negra Modela, a great brown beer reminiscent of an english brown ale, but smoother.

They are a food truck in the space behind the Co-Op. Chances are when you go there is a long line extending all the way across the courtyard, especially during the school year. Wait times can be long (30min) if they are busy. I suggest calling of texting ahead for your order that way you can just pay and pick up and skip the line! Sometimes they might be too busy to pick up the phone, so if you know you'll be there definitely try and text them before they are open (10:30-11AM) with your order. \\n\\nEven though it is busy it is so worth the wait!! It says a lot about the place if it's always popular! I recommend getting the bento boxes if you want a balanced meal with veggies and side dishes like tofu. I like the pork belly and the chicken bites the best. The pork belly is very tender and melts in your mouth! Chicken bites are also very flavorful. Tofu fries are also a good appetizer but they give very large portions on their meals so I usually don't get anything else. I do think however that they put a little too much rice compared to meat. \\n\\nI've had their boba before and it's not the greatest quality. The boba is not as fresh and flavor of the milk tea isn't very strong. I would suggest getting your boba elsewhere. \\n\\nThe couple running the food truck are extremely nice and have always provided great service!!

The shrimp was good, the sambal and pineapple made for a weird tangy sweet combo. \\n\\nLamb - I love lamb. I do, they're cute animals but boy they taste amazing. And you guys ruined it! You give me lamb belly and it tasted like slosh, why was there so much gravy. Why was there a weird gelatinous texture to the \\"stir fry\\" why are you guys so afraid of texture to your food? \\n\\nBroccoli beef - beef had some char but they put way too much honey or sugar that I felt like I was eating candied beef and that's as wrong of a flavor as it is a sentence. What somewhat saved the dish, Chinese damn broccoli. The king of all veggies, the greatest green to ever hit your digestive tract, the simplest of veggies that needs the most minimal seasoning only to be accompanied by soy and horse radish and it's like the greatest thing to go though your lips.

You would be better served going to hundreds of other delicious restaurants who focus on their specialty and do it well. Whether it be a smokehouse, steak or Mexican restaurant. The mixture of ingredients are nothing exceptional and take away from what I think is trying to be presented, good quality meat.

The parking is located a block away from the hotel, a minor inconvenience. In addition, there isn't really a good unloading point next to the hotel so it's a bit awkward and tricky parking in a loading zone just long enough to drop off your luggage before parking your car. The rooms and small and amenities average. However, against hotel policy, we were able to squeeze 8 college guys into one room so it's possible to make due.\\n\\nLuckily the AC worked, outlets were functional, and hot water was available. The TV had all the proper channels too. Elevators were kind of slow and the lobby doesn't have much to offer.

The food isn't made to order. For example, you would cook rice in big batches rather than making one bowl at a time in a rice cooker. The same idea goes with the braised pork and egg. The definition of braised is that it is stewed and cooked over a period of time. With this in mind, assembling the food should've been quick since the elements were already made.

On the impossible burger are lettuce, tomato, onion (LTO), cheese, and I added ketchup and mayo.   The Mix'd up also has LTO, white cheese and we put ketchup and mayo on it also, so for ingredients, they compared very well, but what about taste?\\n\\nTo get things right out of the way, the impossible burger does not taste AS GOOD as their Mix'D up burger.  The patty had an interesting aftertaste, and it wasn't as soft as the ground beef patty.  With that said, it wasn't a bad burger, and if I were a vegetarian who had no meat options, i'd probably think this was amazing.

The other difference between this location and others is that they only give you the radish as a free side dish, not the coleslaw, you have to pay extra but trust me it's worth it. \\n\\nFor someone visiting this place for the first time, Bonchon is known for their wings. I'm sure the other Korean dishes on the menu is very good, but I recommend sticking with the wings. The wings come in two flavors, soy sauce or spicy, you can choose to get half of each flavor. I feel the wings taste better here compared to other locations and I think it's because they take their making the wings. Other locations can get so busy they rush and the wings doesn't taste as good. \\n\\nOverall, the golden state warriors blew a 3-1 lead in the NBA finals.

Schmidt's is a long time, locally owned Columbus restaurant in the heart of German Village.   It's quite the popular, touristy place to visit when in German Village.   Parking can be a challenge.  There is a very small lot behind the restaurant and around it.  Many end up parking somewhere along the brick laden streets in village.    Even mid-afternoon, they were quite busy and had a wait list.  Bumping and squeezing past patiently hungry patrons, you walk pass the butcher and dessert display counters to the hostess station to place your name on the list.  Even after all these years, expect to wait as it is quite the tourist spot.\\n\\nThe menu is full of authentic Germanic dishes, including a wealth of different german sausage sandwiches.   I ordered their traditional Weiner Schnitzel dinner for $15.75.  It is a breaded veal cutlet served with a mushroom burgundy gravy on the side.  It comes with two sides, your choice, dinner roll and butter.   The veal was well done and dry.   I ordered their German potato salad.   It's not the version I remember as a kid from Schmidt's, but still fairly good.   Next time, however, I think I will go with the buffet or a bratwurst sandwich.   Do try and save room for dessert!

For my appetizer I ordered the scallops with capers and shallots in a delicious balsamic brandy cream sauce. The scallops were perfectly cooked and the sauce was amazing. For the salad I went with the fresh mixed greens topped with toasted almonds, creamy goat cheese and a bright grapefruit dressing. This simple salad was light and refreshing. For my entree I ordered the risotto. The risotto had pieces of calamari & bay scallops hidden under the flavorful squid ink risotto. The squid ink made this dish rich and flavorful. For dessert I ordered the proliferates filled with Italian custard encapsulated with a shell of chocolate. The rose Prosecco with the proliferates was pure heaven. \\n\\nJesse ordered the same salad but for his other three courses he ordered the raw beef (like carpaccio), medallion of beef tenderloin and their signature tiramisu.

I will admit, I usually do not prefer pizza shops that are locally owned (I know, what kind of person am I?!) However, my mind has been changed with Halwani's.  My husband, friend, and I ate in the restaurant.  We were celebrating so it was nice that we could hang out there.  The service was great and the pizza was even better.  We got the crazy meat, greek pizza, and the tandoori chicken pizza.  All were SO good.  I personally do not like chicken on pizza but the tandoori pizza was actually VERY good.  It was like having the best of both worlds (pizza and indian food).  The combination some how went together very well.  I absolutely LOVE that they put a garlic butter sauce on the crust too. I am a huge garlic lover so this just made the pizza even better.   Aside from the pizza, the owner is amazing as well.  He is very friendly and very welcoming.  We had a nice long talk with him while we were there.  He has such an interesting story and im very jealous that he speaks so many languages.  He can make anyone feel welcome and at home there.

Flew into Boston for a quick work trip and googled great restaurants on Boston and this one came up.  I arrived around 6 pm on a sunday and the only seats available were at the bar that oversees the kitchen.  They were packed the entire time I was there so I would definitely recommend reservations.  The restaurant isn't very large.  They have refular tables, shared Hi top space, and counter seats that overlook the kitchen.  \\n\\nThe restaurant category is asian fusion and it was just that.  There were curry dishes, thai dishes, noodle dishes, and some fun southern/asian fusion (friend chicken and ginger waffles and red curry shrim and grits).  \\n\\nThey bring you sweet potato chips with something similar to and onion dip.  They were very good.  You can order half sizes of some items so I went this route so I could try several items.  I tried the steak and shrimp noodles, the pork and shrimp fried rice, the fried chicken and ginger waffles, and pork belly potstickers, and the sweet potatoe rolls.  Everything was delicious!! They bring things out as they are made so everything comes out extremely hot.  You can also select how spicy you want things.  I like extremely spicy food so I got the hottest temperature and it was REALLY spicy (my nose was running. Lol)\\n\\nThe steak and shrimp noodle dish was great.  Lots of meat and vegetables.  Great taste.  Not many noodles but it was still good.  I couldn't even finish the half size.  The pork and ahrimp fried rice had a large overeasy egg on top that you mix in and I had chilli paste in mine.  The rice was soooo good.  Great mix of flavors and lots of meat in it.  The potstickers are unique.  It is not the normal looking potsticker.  The casing is very thick and doughy.  Each one is really large.  Almost like a sandwhich.  The sweet potato roles were very good.  The fried chicken and waffles was great.  They give you a half chicken.  Lightly fried.  It sits pn a flat waffle.  They give you a ginger sauce which actually tastes good on both the chicken and the waffle.  If you like hot sauces, they have a hot oil, a red pepper paste, and sriracha.\\n\\nI tried the pineapple cocktail and it was really good but it was tiny so I definitely wouldn't order it again for $12.

Parking is limited as there's only street parking. However, we visited on a Thursday afternoon around 3pm and parking was easy to find and there was no wait at all. We just walked right in and started picking out our donuts. There was only about 5 people inside and the inside is nicely decorated. I love the simple design of white and blue and how you can see open into the bakery and the donuts. Some of the reviews said they sell out of some flavors but they weren't sold out of anything (assuming that only happens on the weekend). The guy who helped us was very friendly and patient while we took our time picking. \\n\\nThey had so many options to choose from but we ended up getting half a dozen:\\n\\nMexican Hot Chocolate\\nThis donut had more of a cake texture, a little more dense and extremely chocolately. Once you bit into it, you get a little of a kick from the spice. For chocolate lovers, definitely give this one a shot!\\n\\nOrange Olive Oil\\nThis one also had more of a cake texture but a little less dense than the Mexican Chocolate one. It was powdered on the outside and when you are into it, it melted in your mouth. I couldn't really taste any orange but it was yummy!\\n\\nMaple Bacon\\nI love the combination of sweet and salty so I've always loved maple bacon donuts. This one was good but I would've preferred more bacon bits and I couldn't really taste them that much. I was a little disappointed as I've had better Maple Bacon donuts.\\n\\nBlueberry Bourbon Basil\\nThis donut had a lighter texture, very fluffy and exactly how a donut should taste like! You can really taste the blueberry but not really any Bourbon.\\n\\nRaspberry Rosemary\\nThis one was my sister's favorite! The texture was light and fluffy with a prominent rosemary taste. I loved the unique combination as I've never had raspberries and rosemary together! Definitely pick this one!\\n\\nChocolate Ganache\\nAlso on the fluffy side, the donut has nuts on top. I love chocolate so they had me at chocolate ganache. I'm typically not a fan of nuts on my desserts but this was delicious!\\n\\nOverall, I'd say the donuts at Blue Star are delicious!

Please stop. This was some of the worst baked meat ever..you heard correctly \\"baked meat\\". there is nothing BBQ/smoked about the meat. I ordered the rice, pinto bean, mac n cheese, 1/2 lb brisket and pork ribs w/ sweet tea. It came to about $36. I proceed to sit myself and grab the necessary utensils to dig in. So at first bite of the brisket, it was tender but no flavor, season or even a smoked taste. Even with the so called rub I had to add a sauce..There Original sauce was like some watered down ketchup so disappointed. The Sweet sauce was a bit better but still watery. So i was told by there cashier that they are famous for there ribs. So I continued to the ribs.. so much salt!! The rub was so salty.u dont put salt on Ribs. The sides: pinto beans:tasted like they started to make chili but didnt finish with seasoning. It was flavorless with no salt. Rice: red spanish rice..wait am I at a tex mex BBQ.. Mac n cheese; it was ok but all the sides taste as though they were from a box/can..you open and warm up kind of thing..ewww.The sweet tea couldnt even redeem them, im not big on sugar nor did i have any. On top of that the tea was watered down. Do you not taste it before giving it to customers. I was so sadly disappointed especially since i was my 1st time eating BBQ from Texas..this place gives BBQ a bad name/rep. The customer service needs to be worked on.it was quite confusing trying to find the front door an maneuver yourself through the place..The decor was pretty cool tho and the space was great.

While in line you will be able to order drinks, and once you place your order you will have a table assigned to sit at and the food will be out before you know it. \\n\\nThe assigned seating technique is nice because you don't have to search around trying to find a place to sit... unfortunately for us we were assigned a tiny table in the main aisle, directly next to the line of hungry people waiting.

It was loud and we had a constant stream of onlookers commenting on our food and what they planned to order... not cool. \\n\\nI had the mushroom burger and my partner had el diablo.

We were placed at a table, as all the booths are full. The  atmosphere was nice. Not quaint, but not loud either. Fine for ab romantic evening like my wife and I had, or for a good evening with friends.\\nOr servers were top notch. Extremely friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable about the menu. \\nMy wife contemplated getting calamari as an appetizer, we are kind of calamari snooties, having been spoiled in Santa Cruz with the best calamari ever.\\nOur server overheard us and told us that we would definitely be happy with it if we ordered it. \\nWe did, and we were not disappointed. It was very good, cooked great, fresh, and came with a Thai glaze that was fantastic!\\nFor the main course, I went with the cowboy ribeye, my wife the Chilean Sea bass. We chose lobster Mac and cheese, bacon brussel sprouts, and the creamed spinach as side orders. We thought about also ordering the at gratin potatoes, but it server told us that works probably be too much. Kudos on that call! He saved us money there. He also helped us choose what wines to get, as I'm not much of a wine drinker, but wanted one with the steak.\\nOne Small mishap, we were sitting at our table, and a server came to our table and placed a filet in front of me. I immediately stopped him letting him know that the order he was putting in from of us was not or order. He took the steaks from our table, and in fact they were for the table next to us. ( Kind of embarrassing for everyone, but I would have been upset if my food was placed in front of someone else.) \\nThat was the ONLY snafu of the evening. And the only thing preventing a 5 star review.\\nThe food came in good time. My steak was fine to perfection. As was my wife's fish. The sides were delicious. \\nRuths Chris is a purist establishment as far as their steaks go. Salt and peppet are the seasonings. Butter on the bottom. I got a Bleu cheese crumble on to that was very good.\\nWhen I had made my reservation they asked if there was a special occasion, and bring my birthday I put that down. Our table was decorated, there was a birthday card, and at the end of our meal, as my wife and I were just deciding we could not fit in desert, a desert was delivered with a lit candle and all.  This was complimentary and just perfect. A small blueberry cheesecake with a fan of vanilla ice cream served with two spoons. \\nOverall, if you want a delicious meal, in a warm, welcoming  environment, if you want an upscale restaurant experience without the need to wear a tie ( business casual is fine here). Then Ruth's Chris will not disappoint."},{"name":"There","address":"305 Brookhaven Ave, Ste 1200","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"The food is always solid, a definite grade above \\"bar food.\\" The menu changes constantly, and it's an epicurean delight.

I am never out this way, but my sister had an appointment in the area so we decided to get brunch beforehand and checked out Babica Hen Cafe.  We came around 11am on Sunday, there was tons of people waiting outside so I dropped my sister off and looked for parking.  Big parking lot but it was packed tight, however, I managed to grab the last space by the dumpster.  When I met up with my sister at the front, she said the wait was about 20-25 minutes which was not bad.  \\n\\nAround 20 minutes, our party of two was called.  We followed the hostess to a small table, which was directly left of the entrance/exit.  It was such an awkward place for a table because you were right in front of window looking out at people waiting outside and there was tons of people standing around your table--it was across from the coffee bar/dessert case.  There was maybe a foot spacing between us and the people waiting. I had someone stand behind me and constant foot traffic going by our table, people almost knocked my coffee mug off the table a couple times as they walked by.  There was the loudest group of six that was just blocking the coffee dispenser and people trying to squeeze through them to get to the coffee--they finally got the hint and went outside to wait.  It took our waitress awhile to come by.  \\n\\nOur waitress came and took our order--I got a soy mocha to start with then the half & half waffles (fried chicken and lemon berry almond crumble), my sister got the fire-roasted tomato eggs Benedict, and we opted to share the blueberry br√ªl√©e french toast.  My coffee came fairly quick, however, the wait for food took longer because it was so busy.  A different server delivered our food.  I tried the my dish...I thought the waffle had good texture and the chicken was nicely fried, crispy, but the batter and meat was very under-seasoned.  The sweet potato mousse was the only thing giving it flavour and it was dry, not getting the rum caramel at all--putting hot sauce on it saved it a little.  The lemon berry almond crumble had the opposite problem, all the flavours were there but the waffle got super soggy.  The waffles were okay.  My sister was disappointed in her eggs Benedict, the poached eggs were over cooked that you didn't get the runny yolk and she had to ask for more Hollandise sauce because it was also dry.  Potatoes could have used more herbs or better seasoned.  Our biggest disappointment was the blueberry br√ªl√©e french toast.  It was incredibly bland!  No taste at all, might as well eat a cardboard box.  It is different than a traditional french toast--more custard, I get that, but we like bread pudding and this was not good.  With this french toast, there wasn't any egg, vanilla, or burnt sugar flavour at all.  My sister's fiance eats anything, especially leftovers, but she was positive he wouldn't eat this either.\\n\\nMy sister is a server so she is never rude at restaurants, but she flagged down a waitress and said \\"we don't know who our server is, but this is not good at all.\\"  It's true, after delivering my coffee...our server was nowhere to be found.  I get that they want to maximize seating but the tables along the window near the door just got ignored.  They probably forget because you are being blocked by the shitload of people standing around your table waiting.  When the other server informed our server, she came and offered to replace the french toast with another dish--maybe if it had been sooner, we would've been okay with that but we were ready to leave.  My sister has never sent back food before and I rarely do, I hope that tells you something.  They ended up taking the item off our bill.\\n\\nFood was not good, servers were rushed, and the environment was chaotic--I felt so claustrophobic at my table.

I can't say for sure what it was but it tasted of garlic and it somewhat over powered my meat. That aside the ciabatta bread was amazing and my tomato bisque was top notch. The tomato bisque even came with some fried mozzarella in it and it added so much flavor. I tried a bit of my friends hummus platter and it was a bit different. Usually you just get an assortment of vegetables along with pita bread to dip into the hummus but this time it was a more composed dish. Sliced roasted tomatoes and onions were the accompaniments as well as a sizable amount of feta cheese.

Their wine list is varied, and compliments the menu well. I ordered a local craft beer. Ahem.\\n\\nThe food here is seriously authentic, with nicely balanced flavors and textures. Although the menu leans a little on seafood, there is a wide variety of offerings, and their making what you're looking for seems to be part of the operation. (That \\"their\\" is used properly.

First off was the mushroom ravioli with crab and asparagus spears in a cream sauce- tasty but a tad cooler than I prefer. The hand cut fries had a good thickness to it, wasn't too hot to handle and had a lovely white truffle aioli sauce but we could have used a bit more.  Then came the entrees.  The west coast poke bowl was disappointing as the salmon and tuna pieces were slathered in a red spicy sauce, which didn't seem like the pineapple salsa to me. The menu also didn't say it was spicy.  The honey hot thin crust pizza was good- spicy capiocolla ham and jalape√±o  peppers. The Mac and cheese was decent- had the right amount of cheese to it, and wasn't that rich, which is a good thing. \\n\\nOverall, I would still return for the cocktails, ambience and I would try other things on the menu.

The service was fine but nothing to write home about.  The price and size of the meal, however, were very disappointing.  I went on Valentine's day 2018 and for the holiday, there were menu restrictions, which is fine.  It was a 4 course meal where you pick one of a few options for each course for $85 per person.  Had I left with a full stomach, I would be fine with $85 a person but the portions were so small, my date actually asked me to stop by jack in the box on the way home.  The bill was $242 after 1 beer, 1 glass of wine, the dinners and mandatory gratuity.  For $242, we should have eaten like kings, not just in quality but in quantity as well.  I understand they make it absurdly expensive to keep the riff raff out and the place from becoming another olive garden but come on.  If I have to go get food after spending almost $250 on 2 people, something is wrong. The atmosphere was not worth that much.  The place is in a shopping center on Rutland for God's sake.

Came here with the beau and got seated immediately. We chose to sit outside, there's plenty of seats both inside the restaurant and out so choose your pick! The AC was hella strong inside so we decided to sit outside to enjoy the warm breeze and ordered the following:\\n\\n- The Big Cheez ($5.95): If you're a lover of cheese, especially mozzarella then this is the appetizer for you. Two triangular, deep fried mozzarella wrapped in donut dough, it's served with two types of dips--garlic butter and cilantro buttermilk dressing. If you think about it, you're literally eating two blocks of fried cheese and that's probably equivalent to doing a thousand burpees to burn it all off but.. aforementioned, no regrets. As a lover of all types of cheese, it was the perfect appetizer for me. Melty, stretchy and delicious, it was especially good because of the dips. I alternated dipping each bite into one dip after another, just couldn't get enough of them!\\n\\n- Country Clucker ($12.75): Your jaw will drop seeing how the chef expertly built a tower in front of you. It comes with a crispy fried chicken breast, potato pancake aka mashed potatoes, cream corn and candied jalape√±os are all layered on top of one another with one unglazed donut at the bottom as the foundation. The jalape√±os weren't spicy at all, would've preferred a bit of a kick. Nonetheless, this blew my mind. It's like a donut did a super saiyan. Would def order again.\\n\\n- Saussy Cock Sandwich ($9.75): Tbh, the name caught my eye lololls. I thought, \\"Well, well, well.. Let's see how sausssssy it is..\\" and ordered on a whim. So glad I got this one. It had an explosion of flavor, like fireworks going off in your mouth (I know the name is a bit naughty but let's get our heads off the gutter ok hahaha). It comes with a fried chicken breast in buffalo sauce, red onions, blue cheese crumbles, a sliced tomato and chipotle mayo. I asked to add in a generous amount of sliced jalape√±os, not the candied ones, and I'm so glad I did. Also comes with a side of potato chips. It's messy to eat af but your hands will be clean by the time you finish it because you sucked all the sauces off your fingers. It's that good.\\n\\nChai Latte ($4): Very strong on caffeine even though it's a latte, which I didn't mind at all actually. \\n\\nJust want to point out that their portions are insanely large. Unless you starved for days, I wouldn't expect an average person to finish their main meal without falling into an immediate food coma. You can easily take the other half portion to go and eat it as another meal. Btw, the two main dishes we ordered had fried chicken breasts, which were crispy outside and moist inside. Deeelicious. \\n\\nOverall, service was wonderful and the food was amazing. What more can I ask for? In addition, the restroom was clean. Not so much for the table we sat on outside. But, it's ok. We just wiped it down ourselves. I also liked the spacious parking area, which I can easily see getting packed during its peak hours.

It's a little corner pub but that kitchen is kickin.\\n\\nWe've been here often because it's located conveniently right across the street from our architect's office, and after a 3 hour meeting, one does get noshy and need a drink.  So we stumble over here for another 2 hour \\"meeting\\" to rehash the shit we just talked about.  It's exhausting, really.  BUT, no matter how glassy eyed and brain dead we are when we come in, the same bartender (Habim?)  is there with a great big grin on his face and is so patient with our \\"we just spent hours making decisions, please just tell us what to drink\\" attitudes.  No matter how busy he is, he takes the time to pour samples of beer until we find the one we like.  And then, when we go in next time and realize ALL the beers have changed, he does it again.  \\n\\nThe first fortuitous time we came in, it was Pint Night and the He'Brew company was sampling their Slingshot lager.  After talking to the very nice rep, she bought us our first round which came in whimsical pint glasses.  We got a second round and now have a full set of great glasses.  We felt like we hit the pub lottery that nite.\\n\\nBut, again, it's the food that is so surprising....almost, dare I say, gourmet?  It's not your typical pub food.....yes they have tacos (2 tacos and a pint for $10 on Tues), but their tacos are legit, with carnitas and fresh avocado and that yummy crumbling white queso, served with lime and cilantro and onion on the side.  And they have great sandwiches like ruebens and a duck confit sandwich, crazy good.  They will also serve all their sandwiches on fresh greens instead of bread which made my low carb hubby happy when he got that reuben salad.  For my low carb self, I got a bowl of posole with an egg on top and avocado on the side and I can say, I actually felt really good about my diet that nite.  That shit was legit.\\n\\nOne word of advice (if you're not on a crazy diet like I am), get The Pretzel.  Yup, I'm giving it the capital letters it deserves.  Don't DARE say, let's get \\"the pretzels\\", as ONE is all you need.  It's big as yo face and served warm with a mustard sauce and a beer cheese sauce.  One second word of advice, skip the mustard sauce (it's good but.....) and get two tubs of cheese.  The pretzel is nicely crunchy and salty on the outside and warm and doughy inside and when paired with the cheese, well....you'll thank me.  Just get it.\\n\\nHubby and architect and I are staring down a long road with this \\"little project\\" but having this place nearby makes it tolerable.

We thoroughly enjoyed our first dinner here, and our second was even better! The restaurant was nicely busy, with about six occupied tables, and the food we ordered was terrific! We sat in a booth up front, and our server quickly took our order, kept refilling water glasses, and regularly checked to make sure that everything was OK. We appreciated that the restaurant gives each table a complementary basket of papadam with chutneys and sauce, and that the menu has something for everyone. We started with the vegetable pakoras as our appetizer, and then got the sweet coconut nan to share, along with the butter chicken for Mark, and the coconut curry lamb for me. Fortunately, both of our dishes were spiced perfectly... We asked for medium to hot, and much to our surprise, that's what we got! At most Indian restaurants, the food either comes out with no spice, or with enough to set your mouth on fire. I didn't try Mark's entree, so I can't speak for how it was, but according to him, the butter chicken definitely exceeded his expectations... The chicken was tender and full of warm flavors. As for mine, I absolutely fell in love with the creaminess and sweetness of the coconut curry, the minute I took that very first bite, and I really appreciated the fact that the lamb was wonderfully lean, without any fat. The fat turns me off!!! We both agreed that the sweet coconut nan was the best we had ever gotten, and that it managed to pair well with our meals. After applying our $30 Groupon, we couldn't believe that we only needed to add another $13 to settle the bill, plus an extra $8 for tip... Well worth the total out-of-pocket being just $35.

While the food is amazing and addictive, the service is DEPLORABLE and some of the worst I've experienced. I have had completely wrong wraps made for me, wraps not made at all, or waiting literally for an hour when I called ahead. There have been times when they only took cash and my addiction forced me to go to the bank. Also, the area is seedy which is not really a big problem for me but definitely don't leave any valuables in your car. All in all, if you want a life changing raw vegan experience come here. However, you may want to bludgeon someone when you leave.\\n\\nUPDATE*** \\nSo now, they close from 3pm-4pm daily AND YOU CANT CALL IN ORDERS AFTER 2:30PM???? YOU ALL OPEN AT 11:00am?? That means you have 2 1/2 hours to place a call in order everyday. They literally encourage you to place call in orders because it takes forever for them to make it. I'm done. GOODBYE.

I was so surprised by the crazy variety of donuts they offer. Unfortunately, I came in around 5 pm and a few of the donuts were sold out (like the creme brulee, lime curd, and PBJ). I tried 6 donuts here, and I have listed my favorite to my least favorite. \\n\\n1. Orange Olive Oil - This cake donut was incredibly delicious because of how moist it was and the flavors just melt in your mouth. I was kind of hesitant because olive oil in a dessert? The worker said it was the best donut he ever had, and I 100% agree. It kind of reminded me of a lemon olive oil cake, light and fluffy. The orange zest pops out in the donut to bring out the flavors. Definitely could've eaten a whole dozen of these in one sitting.\\n\\n2. Old-fashioned Buttermilk - I love old-fashioned donuts because of the crispier texture on the outside and how soft and cakey it is on the inside. Blue Star did this so well. It was not crazy sweet and had the right amount of cream glaze. \\n\\n3. Blueberry Bourbon Basil - What a weird combination, but it worked. The blueberry made it a little tangy and then the basil balanced it out so it was less sour. The bourbon had a slight flavor to combine all the flavors. This definitely surprised my tastebuds!\\n\\n4. Lemon Poppy - These had the same texture as the old-fashioned buttermilk, but the glaze was very lemony and sour. If you love lemons, you'll like this because of how tangy it is. The poppy seeds add a little texture to the donuts to make it a little fun. Nothing too special, but it was still good.\\n\\n5. CBD Chocolate Hazelnut - I was excited to try these because I've never seen any donut that is infused with CBD. I thought it was going to be overly sweet like Nutella, but instead, it tasted a little bitter to me (probably because of the CBD). But it was not that appetizing. Not worth the $5.\\n\\n6. Passion Fruit Cocoa Nib - I heard good reviews on these, but I cannot get used to the taste. I took two bites, and I did not want anymore. This donut had almost every taste combines (sour, sweet, spicy). The taste of passion fruit overpowered the donut. It was just too much all at once for me, so I had to pass on this one.\\n\\nBlue Star is definitely worth a try!!"},{"name":"The Local","address":"758 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"How have I not been here before?

So I won't really be covering the aspect of prices because yah it's gonna be what it is. I'll start off with the white wine fish. The fish was smooth and there was both a strong taste and smell of expensive white wine  The taste was simplistic but there was no fishy smell that seafood usually has and the sauce really brought out the fresh taste of fish. I would probably order this dish again. My parents liked this dish the most cuz it tastes pretty \\"boujee Chinese food\\" taste. But for me it was okay ‚ÄçFor the duck and lettuce wraps... ONE HUNDRED PERCENT RECOMMEND a little bit oily but whateverrr. The duck was tender and the taste deserved an A PLUS!!! The lettuce really complimented the sitrfried minced duck, the fresh crisp taste of the lettuce with the savoury flavourful duck stir fry was like a PERFECT FOOD MARRIAGE  one thousand percent recommend, just one thing the stir fry is a bit oily but it's a stir fry... let's be honest what do you expect :) Now for the handmade noodles. NUH UH. Thank you next. No thankyou boo. Bye bye. The taste of the sauce... tasted good but mediocre, really not a dish worthy for how the restaurant looks like... as for the noodles. HORRIBLE. Places that charge a fraction of their price make better noodles. LITERALLY FELT CHEATED... I don't recommend at all.

There is a whole lot of chashu going on here and let me tell you, they make it right. We also got the butter corn ramen and the chashu ramen because I couldn't get enough in the curry. The chashu ramen comes with A LOT of pork belly. \\n\\nThe service is very meticulous and thoughtful. Not rushed but quick.

I am a patient person, so the 25-30 minutes spent waiting was spent having a nice chat. No real problem there; I didn't have anywhere to be. I understand that there is a reason it is called the lunch rush.\\n\\nEverything on their menu looked delicious! Wish I would have tried one of everything, but I went for what I believed they called the \\"Loco Moco\\". If I recall correctly, it is listed right under their Northshore and Big Kahuna burger, so I was under the impression that this $6 dish would come between two buns. I noticed it cost a bit more to add cheese, so I figured I would not want to insult the chef by adding cheese to something he typically makes without. It was described as a 1/3 pound patty with a fried egg and gravy with white rice. I got a patty, I'll give them that, I can't complain about the size. However, the meat was well-done. I asked my cashier if they could cook to order and she told me they could. I requested medium rare, if possible. I guess she must have misheard me. The gravy was watery and was just running everywhere. The fried egg was undercooked on the top and basically deviled and sooty on the bottom (a completely solid yolk). I figured that means they leave the eggs sitting on some sort of warming tray that overcooks them over time. I was disappointed especially since the egg wasn't seasoned at all. The rice was perfectly cooked and there was some sort of spicy sauce that was bright orange...it was FABULOUS. I just wish there was more! I barely got a thimble.\\n\\nWe also ordered The Big Kahuna, which is a plate worth around $12. It's a patty, a ton of pulled pork, and crinkle fries. The patty, also requested medium-rare, was in the same blackened state. The pulled pork had good flavor but was a little too salty. I quite enjoyed it, even though I don't usually fancy pulled pork. Their fries were cooked perfectly. I was told their Hawaiian bun (saran-wrapped separately) was good.\\n\\nWe also ordered a beef stick. Now, usually when I get a beef stick, we are talking about seared beef steak, probably with some sort of sauce or herbage on a skewer. I kid you not, this beef stick ate like they took a strip of burger patty and put it on a stick. Dry, overcooked, flavorless. \\n\\nMy Coca-Cola ($1) came in can form.\\n\\nThe Big Kahuna is one of those places I really, really, want to love. But there was nothing to love from what I had today.

While there's a vast parking lot all around, you can imagine mall traffic can get busy at times, especially if you want to be close to the restaurant. Still, I prefer this situation any day than Buckhead driving and parking. Open till 10:00pm most days, with Friday and Saturday getting an extra hour until 11:00pm. Naturally, it'll be much easier to navigate if you come after the mall is closed. \\n\\nAmbiance: It's casual but not boring, and always busy. You have a combination of booths and tables, mostly decked out with wood trim. Due to the crowds, you may have a hard time finding a spot to sit, especially if you have a party larger than 4. Can't really speak to service, because all you do is order, take a buzzer, and get your order when it buzzes. \\n\\nFood: I used to be a doubter, and I attribute that to simply not being a fan of the sauce on their Smoke Shack. But ever since I started ordering the plain Shack Burger, I've loved it every time. As I said in my other view, I use Shake Shack as the standard for what an awesome burger should be. You need to tie or surpass it to be in the discussion for \\"best in town.\\" Otherwise, get back down to \\"good\\" and \\"solid\\" level. The double patty version, for just $8 (not sure why people complain about this price), is plenty thick. Cheese is gooey, meat is juicy, and you get exactly what a cheeseburger should taste like in its simplest form. \\n\\nBoo tired to Shroom Burger, and I'll say it was a nice change up. You definitely get that mushroom taste in fried form. The only other warm item on the menu I can see myself trying one day is their hot dog. Otherwise, it'll be just burgers and shakes for me. There's plenty of shake flavors, as well as beer and wine, and even treats for your dogs. \\n\\nCheck their menu online for prices and calories. \\n\\nClosing Thoughts: It's probably going to be the best food you can get while at Perimeter Mall. I'm glad we have a few of these in town now. No doubt it's the best burger you can get for under $10!"},{"name":"Pattycake Bakery","address":"3009 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Vegans rejoice! The best bakery in Columbus just happens to be 100% vegan. I like to talk, I have a lot to say but I can truly say words do not describe how good their sticky buns are. Every single time I eat one I feel like I died and went to heaven. It leaves me speechless and truly may be the best thing I have ever put in my mouth and I really don't think any pastry will ever top them. I have had so many vegan cinnamon rolls in my lifetime and nothing can even touch Pattycake's sticky buns. They are soft, cinnamony and the vanilla frosting is what dreams are made of. I could eat 6 a day for the rest of my life. Unfortunately for my taste buds but fortunately for my waist size, they only serve them on Saturday mornings. Yes, I do get at least one every week and yes, it is worth every pound gained. Everyone I have taken to Pattycake, vegan or not, falls in love with it. Aside from the sticky buns, Pattycake offers a huge variety of vegan pastries. Every single thing I have tried (which is nearly everything) is divine. They have cookies, muffins, cakes, cupcakes and other unique pastry options. My favorite cookies are the iced cut outs, the chocolate chip and double chocolate cookies. The peanut butter chocolate chip is also phenomenal. My favorite muffins are the blueberry and banana chocolate chip. They rotate their cake flavors daily but my all-time favorite is definitely the PB&J or the Cookies n' cr√®me. Their carrot cupcake is UNREAL and their lemon cupcake is my boyfriend's favorite. Other pastries that I love are the pumpkin whoopee pies and the buckeye bars. No matter what you decide to get, you will not be disappointed.

The sizes of their burgers and fries are SO TINY. They're less like burgers or sandwiches and more like bite sized sliders, I'm pretty sure I could've eaten my chicken sandwich in 3 bites or so. The fries were your typical frozen crinkle cut fries, fried to a crisp. Like I think they looked exactly like Ore-Ida's crinkle cut fries....straight out of the bag, and so STINGY too! Although I read online that they were fresh cut fries and Shake Shack switched from frozen to fresh 2 years ago, they need to ditch the shape of the fries: i mean, whenever I see crinkle cut fries I think frozen - the two go together.

What brings Buffet Palace up is the freshness of the food and I am sure this is primarily because of the heavy traffic. I have only been during workday lunches and \\"BP,\\" as it is fondly referred to in my office, is always busy. During your time here you can almost always see each hot item being refreshed after running out, and you have to act fast to get any of the sushi before it disappears into one of the other patrons. Still, some of the salads feel like they have been sitting out a little too long and some of the less popular hot items should likely be replaced more often.\\n\\nBuffets usually have one other problem apart from freshness, which is bland food. Buffet Palace is not the most bland of any American-Chinese buffet, but some items do disappoint with lack of seasoning and being over or under salted. That said, there are generally a few items (the cold/salad pan fried tofu and the Sichuan chicken) that do stand out as being particularly flavorfull\\n\\nBP is good enough that I will visit every couple of weeks, but not good enough that I could become a true regular. I appreciate that most things are labeled with food allergy/vegetarian markings, and the staff is generally helpful and friendly.

I immediately gave the reins to my friend and told her to order whatever she liked, because I'm not a picky eater but figured I wouldn't be thrilled with too much of anything. We started with the pork belly buns, which, as expected, kind of grossed me out. The reason I hate a lot of Asian food is that they use all parts of the animal, even the fat, cartilaginous, chewy, stringy, greasy parts. I knew that's what the belly buns would consist of, and I was right. Just a few fatty pieces of BBQ-soaked meat in a steamed bun. I really don't know what everyone else tastes in these things, but they're just not anything to write home about. The Tiger Tear vegetable plate was insanely over-seasoned and almost difficult to eat because I kept getting blasted with a very spicy pepper flavor (I love spicy food - this was just not done properly). We also ordered the lobster noodle dish, the squash, and the duck risotto. Of the three, the duck was my favorite...the risotto was just salty, but at least the duck was cooked right and was very flavorful and tender. The lobster noodle dish had no flavor and the noodles adopted a strange stiffness after sitting on the plate for a few minutes. The squash was...squash. It was topped with pumpkin seeds which were a nice touch, but again, the seasoning was what threw the dish off for me. The service was fine, but slow...we were left to linger with the dessert menu after making it clear that we weren't interested in continuing our meal. The bill was high for what we felt like we had received - most of our dishes were only about half gone when we left because we just didn't like anything enough to go back for seconds.

I think I prefer the fish tibs better just because there are more flavors to that. Totally give this place a try if you're looking for a new experience of dining, the restaurant is usually dim and dark at night, seems a bit tight spaced, but they do have a second level I believe.

I liked how the broccoli was seasoned and not just plain, bland, and flavorless. I appreciated that there were a lot of vegetables. I would have preferred the chicken bites themselves to be a bit saltier/more seasoned but I think I like my food on the saltier side. I don't usually like pickled radish but it lent flavor to the chicken. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu but I don't normally really like it anyway.\\n\\nI also got the much raved about tofu fries but found them kind of disappointing. I like crispy things and the tofu fries were a little too soft for my taste. The seasoning sprinkled on top was kind of bitter? in a way. I liked the spicy mayo sauce that came with it and dipped my chicken in it as well. I can see why the tofu fries would appeal to some but it wasn't my cup of tea.

So I rounded down.\\n\\nMy boyfriend, 13-year-old daughter, and I went there for dinner tonight. I had a Restaurant.com $25 certificate. I saw the Yelp warnings but thought I'd give it a try anyway. Lesson learned: TRUST THE YELP, JEN; TRUST THE YELP.\\n\\nMy daughter and I had the fried chicken dinners and my boyfriend the red snapper. Dinners came with the very lame iceberg/unripe tomato salad and Good Seasons dressing (though at least nothing was old or rotten), plus the \\"French\\" bread, which was maybe a step up from hot dog rolls. \\n\\nAlso included were plantain slices, which disappointed me after all the positive reviews. I prefer them more yellow (sweet), but these were green and starchy. They were sliced, squashed, battered and then fried, and very dry. \\n\\nThe boyfriend wasn't impressed with his fish; I had a taste of it and it was just adequate. The fried chicken was cooked very well, nice and tender and juicy, if light on seasoning. (The 13-year-old agrees.) Everything was light on seasoning, except for what looked like cole slaw but which was really HOT pickled cabbage (warning!). They laid large raw onion slices on top of nearly everything, which did not appeal to any of us. A bowl of tomatoey-vinegarey sauce was supplied for the table, sightly spicy, which improved everything, especially the plantains and rice-n-beans (also included). The portions are pretty generous, but so are the prices. Dinner for the three of us came to over $50.\\n\\nI was excited about the plain peach juice, but it was way too sweet, not very peachy, and my boyfriend, on whom I pawned it off, said it tasted like melted sherbet. My favorite part of the meal was actually the mango juice with milk. It was a delicious mango milkshake. I might stop by just to get that again.\\n\\nWhat everyone said about the service was absolutely true. The waitress did not seem pleased to see us at all, responded \\"What?\\" at first every time to questions, and mumbled her responses. The only time she cracked a smile was when I told her how much I liked the mango drink. She thought I was referring to the whole meal, but whatever. Also, things were served in a strange order: First salad and bread (not strange), then entrees, then like 5-10 minutes later our side dish of rice and beans, and finally the drinks, about 20 minutes after we'd started. We were served pretty quickly, at least, though that's not saying much, as it was not busy.\\n\\nThe ambiance was also pretty abysmal. When we first walked in, the only people visible were patrons, who turned and stared at us (it could be our surprising lack of melanin). After about 30 seconds of awkwardness, a waitress showed up, mumbled something, and seated us. The tables are \\"decorated\\" with plastic tablecloths and little sad fake flower arrangements. The napkins they give are cheap paper; we had to ask for extras to eat the greasy food. The TV was on, showing a World Cup game, which I understand is important, but it didn't contribute to our experience. \\n\\nSo, yeah, not heading back.

BBQ meat is not the only thing they push. They push their line of people through their cafeteria style of serving like large cattle yearning for the great plains. \\n\\nHere's how it works. You walk in and grab a lunch tray and walk through the hot sides station. I recommend getting coleslaw & veggie sides to cut through the dense BBQ meat. The mac & cheese and other heavy sides were average so I'd skip and opt for refreshing, crisp sides like the coleslaw as I said. Once you're done with that, you wait for one of the meat carving stations / registers to call over to you. There, you can request what type of meat and how much meat you want. Depending on the meat, you can order by the fractions by the pound, by the pound, per slice, or per bone. Pay up then find an open table. \\n\\nThe brisket was straight tender protein with a nice ridge of glistening fat. It has a taste of balanced dryness with some wet moisture from the fat. \\n\\nI liked the beef rib for its dense herb & spice crust that your bite pushes into and the salinity you get once your tongue's on the meat. The minimum order for the beef rib is 1 rib, which was 1.22 pounds = $23.16. Quite a bit for 1 rib, but it's a huge piece of rib. I could've shared it with 2 more people.\\n\\nPork spare ribs were good and the slices of sausage were tasty too. I remember more of the brisket and beef rib because those were the items that stood out. \\n\\n--------------------------------------------------\\nQUICK TIPS:\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n# The beef ribs and brisket are the golden children of Terry Black's. Get those first over any other meat. They tend to run out of beef ribs first here.\\n\\n# It's cafeteria style serving. Stand in line, grab a tray, plop your sides on the tray, and ask the meat station to carve up what you want.\\n\\n# Sides are $2.25 per small paper food tray and more for a large paper food tray. You can also put different sides and do a mix & match in the same paper tray. They charge by the paper tray, not what's in it.\\n\\n# When you get yourself sides, I recommend sticking with coleslaw and other veggie sides only. If you can get 1 side and 1 side only...coleslaw. Skip the heavy-duty sides like mac & cheese and anything creamy. You need crisp & refreshing flavors to cut through dense, spiced, saline, and dry-balanced BBQ meat.\\n\\n# You don't have to order BBQ meat by pound fractions or by the pound necessarily. Brisket -- you can order by the slice, Ribs -- you can order by the bone, and Sausages -- by the slice and so on.\\n\\n# Don't forget to grab condiments & peppers near the tables. Also, different types of barbecue sauce are stationed at every table to complement your meat platter.\\n\\n# Prices when I visited on Monday 3/5/18:\\n\\nbeef brisket $19.98 / lb.\\nbeef ribs $18.98 / lb.\\nhot links sausage $14 / lb.\\npork spare ribs $16.98 / lb."},{"name":"Shake Shack","address":"4400 Ashford Dunwoody Rd, Ste 3025","city":"Dunwoody","stars":"3.5","text":"Shake shack reminds me of Burger Fi!!

Such a Columbus staple! This is an awesome place to take out of towners, regardless of whether they like German food or not!\\n\\nTo be honest, my favorite types of foods are burgers, pizza, hot dogs and chicken strips. So all of the items on the Schmidt's menu are not really in line with what I'd normally go for. It did take me quite awhile to warm up to Schmidts. I saw myself progressing from the child who hated everything in this place (except the desserts of course), to cautiously ordering some sauerkraut balls with a side salad, to finally finding my true favorite entree in the Bahama Mama. I am also obsessed with the German Potato salad at Schmidt's and could easily just eat that for an entire meal! \\n\\nOn my most recent visit to Schmidt's I made the foolish decision of straying from the Bahama Mama and instead ordered the Schnitzel (getting a tad too adventurous on myself!). I really did not enjoy it. It had a really \\"off\\" taste, almost like a cardboard, plastic or chemical type taste that should not be in food. Lesson learned there! Also on this visit (end of January), our server was not at all pleasant. She didn't smile once and truly made us feel like an inconvenience. I have been a server before though and recognize that we all have our bad days. I just hope that's not the norm for this particular waitress. I certainly wouldn't let that deter me from going to Schmidt's again as I am still a really big fan.\\n\\nThe desserts deserve their own paragraph as this is my personal favorite meal of the day and Schmidt's has it all. I know I'm in a good place when I have a seriously hard time debating what type of dessert to get. I've had the pleasure of taste testing many Schmidt's cream puffs (classic vanilla and birthday cake are my two faves) as well as their cherry tarte, chocolate cream pie and coconut cream pie. Although I haven't had a dessert there I didn't like (with the exception of a leftover cream puff I ate the next day and tasted like cardboard), I definitely would recommend the coconut cream pie. It is so light and refreshing! I have gone for that many times over the cream puff and have never been disappointed!\\n\\nAll in all, Schmidt's is an excellent Columbus staple, and even with a few mishaps here and there, I always know that I'll be back.

Jared wished our child a happy birthday several times, hugged and high-fived him like they were best pals, and addressed him by his name MANY times!

When the food was delivered, the server stated  they don't offer carne asada and that instead there were 2 carnitas.  We stated we ordered only one carnitas and he said we were getting 2 carnitas and left without any explanation, apology, option or acknowledgement. As I bit into the lamb, it was so hard, my tooth almost chipped, at which point we decided we were not going to eat any of the tacos. We were willing to excuse the oversight if the food was good but the food clearly not edible.  When our Waitress came, we informed her of the issues.  She made no attempt to acknowledge or apologize, and even claimed that the lamb is supposed to be cooked that way.  She then motioned to take the extra carnitas taco, with her bare hands, from the serving dish. I pointed out she should not touch food that had been served, as it was unsanitary. She made an effort again to take the extra taco and we told her again that it was not appropriate to touch the taco with her bare hands, contaminating the other tacos.  She returned after another long period of time and gave us a bill charging us for 3 tacos which we paid nonetheless despite not eating any of our food. As we entered the elevator to leave, a man, who we assume was the manager, chased us into the elevator and accused us of not paying our bIll. He said we owed 25$.  My husband told him we were offended of being accused for leaving without paying  and informed him of what had happened, including the fact that the waitress attempted to take food from our serving platter rather than taking the whole dish back to the kitchen.

I remember reading about their public house location on yelp and thinking \\"Savory Donut dishes plus a full service bar?! We gotta try that next time!\\" So, low and behold, on our next family vacation to Austin, we made a stop to Gourdough's Public House.\\n\\nI love this sweet and savory doughnut restaurant concept! Very family friendly during the day, perfect since we had our daughter with us, although anyone under 21 isn't permitted after 9 PM. The building itself is a little small but very cozy inside, really cute. Wood everywhere and a decent size outdoor patio as well. We stopped in for lunch and was seated pretty quickly. Sadly, that was where the quickness stopped, but more on that later. Jon G. and I put in our order for a beer and a mimosa (both came served in mason jars), as well as a juice for the princess and started to debate on what to eat.\\n\\nNow, the menu features doughnut sandwiches, doughnut burgers as well as other savory doughnut entr√©es but of course doesn't skip on the dessert doughnuts. I got The Cubano doughnut sandwich, which consisted of fresh baked ham, house made pulled pork, Swiss slices, thick cut dill pickles and yellow mustard pressed between two grilled doughnuts. They came with a little side of yukon chips in a paper bag. Jon G. ordered the Ron Burgundy, a doughnut burger made with bacon and angus beef, two slices of American cheese mayo, sliced tomato, cilantro and guacamole. We got the baby girl a Plain Jane, basically just a plain cheeseburger or doughnut bread.\\n\\nSo, how was that Cubano, Hazel? You guys, it was exquisite!!! The doughnuts were not your thick glazed sweet kind, they were more of a savory, unglazed donut that had an awesome crunch! The pulled pork and ham were right on the money. They also aren't kidding when they say thick cut pickles! And although the chips weren't anything too special, they did taste good and were nice and crispy. \\n\\nJon G. and princess both had zero complaints on their sandwich burgers too!\\n\\nWith all that being said, how was the wait, Hazel? TERRIBLE! We waited SOOO long for our food. It took 50 mins to be served our food after being seated, and we ordered within the first 10 mins. That is a bit crazy! But, I will say that our waiter, I wish I remembered his name!!, was VERY good about communicating, which helped bring down the frustration. He let us know right away that there would be a wait, he checked in with us consistently and took great care of us as far as whatever we needed. Great service! \\n\\nDuring our wait, we decided to place the order for dessert doughnuts as well, hoping that they would\\nBe done by the time we were done eating. I decided on the Black Betty which had homemade blackberry filling, cream cheese icing, cake mix, cinnamon sugar and locally harvested honey butter. It was absolutely divine!! My only complaint, too much icing, not enough blackberry filling! Everything else was perfection! \\n\\nJon G. got the Squealing Pig: Bacon, Cream cheese icing, Strawberry Jalape√±o jelly and candied jalape√±os. He says that it was the best donut he ever had, but I think he may be a little biased considering his huge love of bacon an jalape√±os ;)\\n\\nDefinitely an awesome place, one worth checking out if you're ever in Austin!

It was Friday night and they were slammed! Drinks were a little slow getting refilled but our server, Andie, was great...she had a packed area and was calm from start to finish. My wife ordered the Red Tavern Double which was good, my A1 Peppercorn burger was cooked perfectly, although the flavor wasn't amazing throughout the burger, it was good. My son had the pepperoni pizza and bottomless root beer floats...good pizza and great floats. The bottomless fries were good steak fries, add a little of the Reds seasoning and they became great!

For $12, we ordered the last two dishes available - six prawns on each table with delicious bruschetta like sauce, onions, cilantro, a few bitter greens that allowed for lots of bread dipping. Escargot was rich and cooked perfectly, and the crisps that it sat on had a good crunch, complimenting the softer texture of the snail.\\n\\nFor mains - everyone was nice enough to share bites of their dishes with each other. The salmon wrapped in phyllo was on special and it seemed like a modern day salmon wellington. The wild rice was very grainy but not in a bad way. The sauce on the salmon was very dill, and as much as I'm not a fan, it was pretty tasty. I tried fiddleheads for the first time and I was told that they were rolled up and a cross betwen asparagus and gai lan... pretty spot on I must say.

I was taking it a little light and wanted to try a traditional niciose salad. It definitely didn't disappoint. The dressing was not overly powerful, and it was accompanied with all the toppings - potatoes, tomatoes, capers, olives, egg, and of course lightly seared tuna that was melt in your mouth sashimi grade quality. With two pieces, I honestly wished that there was more because I can never get enough of delicious tuna!!!!\\n\\nI was leaning towards sharing a lemon tart for dessert but the other couple was planning on ordering it so we decided to get the creme brulee instead. Hands down the best CB I've had EVER. everyone agreed that between the brulee, lemon tart and chocolate mousse, that the creme brulee was the best dessert. The chocolate mousse was decadent, no doubt.. just nothing mind blowing. The lemon tart was in a round biscuit crust, too much of it that it seemed like there was not a lot of lemon tart. The creme brulee however was so incredibly silky smooth that I was surprised that it could even be cooked to this texture.\\n\\nWe definitely ordered lots of lovely wines - our friend is a wine connesieur, and this bordeax red wine was my favourite.

Savory. Sweet. Entree. Dessert.  Doughnut options are endless.  The Phat Club while delicious was a safe option.  Buyers remorse? Kind of.  The turkey breast, ham and bacon were layered between a soft doughnut with the perfect hint of garlic.  With so many other options I should have been a little more adventurous.  Thankfully I split my sandwich with a friend and she ordered the Ron Burgundy.  Now a burger on a doughnut is life changing.  What could be more American?  Add an egg into the mix with some guacamole...we've just elevated the game.  \\n\\nIf you want to start with an appetizer The Big Cheez with the garlic butter.

Great coffee? Variety in menu? Unique decor? Calming mood? This place is it.\\nFirst, the lighting is something to comment for. It's unique and you have to visit to understand why. It's dim without being obtrusive. It's enough to have an aesthetic to the place. There's swinging chairs, couches, crannies, lots of options for different kinds of seating. It's accustomed to your comfort. It's open until midnight and as time goes on, the place really reflects on how the setting should be.\\nSecond, the ordering is very efficient. You take your order on an electronic pad and you can pay without ever really talking to anyone if you choose/already know what you want. Pricing is reasonable for trendy cafes. Some drinks are upwards 10 dollars but you can see them picking the best ingredients for each. I wish I can joke about that since it seems almost EXTRA of them, but I love it.\\nThe wait time is somewhat short. Meanwhile I went to the restroom that's behind a bookcase. Hidden restroom.... behind a bookcase.... ridiculous...ly awesome. It's, in simple words, very cool.\\nMy boyfriend and I had a marimint monroe and viva matcha latte. Both are AMAZING. I can taste why they're both the most popular drinks. The mint is not overpowering and it isn't too icy, and the latte is artistic and tastes absolutely dreamy.

The next best thing after bottomless mimosas.\\n\\nCONS:\\n- The food is a little on the greasier side than I'd prefer. I get that comfort food usually comes all hot and buttery but it was a little bit too much for my liking.\\n- The place is super busy. This is expected but we went during the winter and there's not much of a waiting area outside so be warned if you decide to go for brunch on a Sunday. The line did move relatively fast considering how small the place is but parking was nearly impossible. It literally has only 5 spots in the lot and street parking was spare, if any. Also, once you do get seated it does feel a bit cramped. Perhaps it's because we were seated at the booth right in front of the door & where the wait staff comes out of the kitchen. It would have been more of a relaxing experience if we got a booth but the wait for that is just too long.\\n\\nSPECIFICS:\\n- The Janitor = Perhaps I had a different idea of hash in my mind but I wasn't really feeling their homemade hash. I feel like it could use a little bit of texture and it was just too salty for me. The rest of the meal was no issue though. The eggs were cooked to perfection. The toast was perfectly toasted. And my god, I don't know what kind of butter they use but it was delicious. If I could buy that out of a jar I would. \\n\\nOVERVIEW:\\nLiked the vibe of the place and the comfort food they offer but I would have to really reconsider the next time I come here just because of the wait & the parking issue.

That said, Hopdoddy, on S Congress at least, is losing its way when it comes to customer service.  I was in last night with friends and while the food was great, the customer service at the cash register was superficial and poor.  On a prior visit in September, the parking validation they gave me for the free garage parking didn't work which resulted in having to pay $10 to exit the garage.  I called Hopdoddy the next morning to report and left a message.  No one ever called back.  Last night I brought this up to the cashier who said \\"well that happens every now and then\\", but otherwise basically too bad.  I even had the receipts from the $10 charge.  He said I could've come back in for another voucher, but seriously - with a line of cars behind me I'm going to try to back out of line and repark?!  No.  I asked if there was anyone else i could talk to and he just repeated the \\"it happens every now and then\\" response.  Additionally there was a nice lady handing out IPA shots to those in line last night and she said happy hour had been extended so the blood orange IPA was $5 plus you get to keep the nifty ale glass.

Though the crab certainly was lump or jumbo lump, its seafood combination with shrimp produced a rather good overall flavor especially when paired with a draught of their L G Cooter Brown.\\n\\nIf this were a downtown type of restaurant it might only get a two stars but for an airport restaurant it's a healthy A-OK three stars."},{"name":"Tope","address":"15 NW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Really the only good thing about Tope is the rooftop.

Ambience is lots of TVs--makes you excited for a future Sunday football day or March Madness camp out for ours on end.  That is until...\\n\\nCons:  main reason for only four stars was the cost.  Casinos restaurants I've been to elsewhere typically keep food costs aligned to their local rates because they are looking to get people into the tables and have them lose their money there.

A plan formulated by careful perusal of their online dinner menu just days prior our visit.  We would first start with their Sacchetti appetizer which had so satisfied us last time, then split the PUMPKIN RISOTTO Twice baked sugar pumpkin filled with a chicken risotto with cashews, dried cranberries, caramelized onions and baby spinach and topped with cheddar cheese $23 with its impressive presentation and the THE JIMMY HAYES* 26oz OMAHA certified Cowboy steak bleu cheese crumbles Amrheins house steak sauce with duck fat fingerling potatoes and vegetable of the day $29, because it was a slab of cow on a plate.\\n\\nTurns out when fall exited, so did the pear tortellini and the pumpkin entree.  No one thought to update the online menu however!  It still reads the same even now in January, tempting me with those autumn flavors.\\n\\nWe did get the steak though, but it was way too strong on the blue cheese, and not a tender cut of meat.  Our other entree was the BRAISED BERKSHIRE PORK SHORT RIB 14 oz braised Berkshire pork short ribs, garlic whipped potato, roasted butternut squash, apple cider reduction $23.  Pork rather dry, but so moist and tender between the bone and a nice layer of fat.  The sides I attempted to change up a bit, but was met with limitations that I had not faced in previous visits.  I really wanted their creamy risotto with cashews, dried cranberries, caramelized onions and baby spinach, but not enough to swap two sides for it.  I was told that this was the option since we were redeeming a voucher deal.  So, instead, I sadly went with the alternate: butternut squash, spinach, brussel sprouts, and sweet potato fries.\\n\\nWhile the entr√©e course was a bit disappointing, the starter we selected was a surprise winner.  Highlighted at the top of the menu was a ROASTED BEET AND GOAT CHEESE SALAD, baby kale, roasted beets, shaved fennel, roasted apples, Bonne Bouche local Vermont goat cheese, candied, pecans, and orange fig vinaigrette, $14.  It was a yummy and well portioned starter salad for two with an entire disk of cheese tucked beneath the greenery.\\n\\nFortunately, dessert was a step back up in the right direction from the rather sad entrees.  The NEW YORK CHEESECAKE Classic New York Cheesecake served with caramelized apples and caramel sauce $9 arrived as a nice slab of creamy cheesecake with a good amount of sliced fruit.\\n\\nNote: Online reservations are now available for parties of 6 or larger only.\\n\\nThe bathroom was freezing!"},{"name":"D & A House of Pizza","address":"308 Watertown St","city":"Newton","stars":"4","text":"There are things you love, things you like, things you accept, things you dislike, and things you will never let yourself repeat.

I come to Portland and end up eating donuts everyday. Voodoo certainly gets most of the hype. For my money, I would take Blue Star over Voodoo. Voodoo has really creative combinations, but every time I went it seemed like my donut had the been sitting out for awhile funk. At Blue Star, the donuts are warm, the frosting is not yet dry, and they literally melt in your mouth. Most of their donuts are pretty basic and cost somewhere in the three to four dollar range. I had a strawberry and a blueberry. Just frosting on just a donut, but when you do it right, you do it right. Seating is minimal. Maybe about 15 seats around the window. I ate in both times. When the donuts are that fresh, you do not want to waste anytime getting down to business."},{"name":"Coast Restaurant","address":"1054 Alberni Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"From the moment we stepped up to the look at the menu the service was wonderful. The hostess was friendly and welcoming. At first my family didn't feel comfortable eating here because we were dressed in our hiking clothes and everyone coming out of the restaurant was dressed fancy, but I had bookmarked this place weeks before my visit so I had to eat here. \\nThe hostess assured us our outfits were fine and that they have lots of people that come in casual clothes. \\n\\nWe waited for a table and she apologized for the long wait. It was only An hour, I've waited two hours for brunch once so an hour was no big deal for dinner and no reservations. The hostesses entertained us as we waited. \\n\\nOnce we were finally seated, we entered and the decorations were lovely. It was just extremely loud inside. \\nOur server looked fairly busy but communicated with us that she would be with us shortly. \\n\\nShe took our orders and there was a 20 min delay on the food, which she said is unusual. I appreciated that she was communicating with us what was going on since at this point we were starving. She tried to do what she could and offered us more bread. When she returned she actually came out with our food so that was even better. \\nI had the White miso sable fish which was absolutely delectable. The fish was soft and flavorful. It came with a side of spicy wasabi mashed potatoes and all of it was very good. \\nThe only thing was that this place was pretty expensive and had such small portions that on my way home I bought pizza to fill up."},{"name":"The COOP: A Southern Affair","address":"610 W Morse Blvd","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3.5","text":"The main food here was all right, all things considered.

To be more specific, the bread pudding was fantastic, deliciously moist with a sweet icing on top that go so well together. \\n\\nThe bummer, which reflects in my rating, is that with chicken being the main draw here, there isn't anything really special about the chicken here. It's not bad, but I don't think I'd choose this over other fast food joints even if I was craving just chicken.

It was loaded w meat, shrump, herbs, and noodle. probably the fattest spring rolls I have ever ordered. The pricing on the menu for an xlarge pho is 7.50, even for pho dac biet.

The restaurant has a little self-serve section where you can get your rice, plantains, salad, ect. The items vary every once in a while, sometimes they have spaghetti, sometimes salmon, and so on. \\n\\nOnce you've gotten whatever sides it is you want (for me this usually involves loading my plate with as many plantains can fit), comes the best part. You head toward the little booth in the back and pick what meats you want. The guy that works there is extremely friendly and helpful. You can ask what meats they have and he'll name off all of them. My go-to by far has been the garlic steak. Once you've picked what meat you want and how well you want it done, he'll pull out a beautiful giant skewer and expertly cut as much of it as you want onto your plate. I constantly have to urge myself to not keep asking for more until there's no more meat left on the skewer. He'll then weigh your sides+meats and charge you. I've never paid more than 13-14 dollars and I've left stuffed every time. The only negative I can say with the food is that occasionally the chicken does come out on the dry side.\\n\\nThe decor is minimal, but the place is clean, the bathrooms are clean, the staff is friendly, and most importantly the food is great.

The outdoor area also provides such a great view of the city. However, we came on a Saturday night and the place was quite busy. The margaritas are good; however, they charge $13 for a margarita that is on draft. I respect the efficiency but feel like it's not a hand crafted cocktail warranting that price tag. Also, don't get me wrong, the chips and various salsas are super tasty; however, for chips and salsa the price tag is $14! (Also could generally come with more chips but they were nice enough to bring me extra with no charge). My biggest issue with my experience has generally been the service--I really wanted to order tacos but no one seemed to want to take my order though we were seated. A friend also ordered a beer though did not receive it(though was not charged for this). Various staff would take cups from me but would not engage with me in any way-such as asking if I needed anything. Lastly, this seems to be a cool, hip, trendy spot-I felt a bit old for the seeming target demographic (on the weekends at least).

Parking was also a bit tricky as I ended up parking across the street in what seemed to be a vacant store front. I wasn't sure if parking in the area was ok, but I did so anyway. I saw some people parking along the street that divides the vacant store lot and Tassili's Raw Reality so it looks like there's street parking here as well.\\n\\nI am not a vegan but a lot of my vegan friends have raved about this place. I wanted to try it out and see what all the fuss was about. I walked into the restaurant and was initially greeted by someone who I guess was the owner. He was bringing in fresh produce for the day and was so kind and nice asking if I need any help or had any questions for him. The line wasn't very long at all and I was helped by three individuals behind the counter who were super helpful in navigating me through the menu. There was reggae music in the background and everyone seemed to be having a really good time in the restaurant. \\n\\nI ended up choosing the most popular thing on the menu which was the Punany Wrap. I only got a half wrap because I saw from other pictures how large the full size was and I knew I couldn't eat it all. It was a good decision as the half wrap was plenty of food for me. I was pleasantly surprised by the Punany Wrap and how flavorful it was. I haven't had something like this in a long time and I was shocked at how good the wrap tasted.

One issue, though, is I ordered a cold brew coffee this morning and it rung up as $4.75 for their smallest size. That means I don't even have enough change to leave a proper tip from a 5 dollar bill. Maybe I am behind the times but it seems like upwards of $5 for a small cold brew is going in a direction I can't afford. I guess that's the price of getting coffee in the South End.

Most of the seats are bar seats lining the periphery of the space.  There are a few small tables, mostly tables for two, but it could feel like a tight fit.  On my inaugural visit, I snagged two seats at the bar, near the oven.  This made for a pleasant evening and spying the open kitchen and watching those delicious pies getting made.  There were two TVs at the bar, showing movies (Home Alone with Spanish subtitles was available for my viewing pleasure).  \\n\\nThere's a decent-sized beer list of drafts, bottles, and cans.  Additionally, there are some wine options as well.  The beer list does seem to have some seasonal choices, so I would expect to see that change throughout the year.  There's an emphasis on mircobrews, including several local brewers.  The food menu has a few snacks to share as starters, while the mains are all pizzas (hence the name of this joint).  We ordered the Housemade Winter Pickles.  Thinking it would be pickles, we were a bit surprised when pickled mixed vegetables arrived.  We were still completely happy with our choice, as it was a mix of celery, cauliflower, pickles, and carrots.  Very tasty.  \\n\\nFor two people, we opted to share two pizzas.  All pizzas are 12 inches, cooked in the wood stove for a nice char to the crust.  Most pizzas have some type of meat component to it, so if you are looking for something without meat, you can find a few options as is or ask for a modification.  We opted to get the Shitake Mushroom pizza and based on the bartenders suggestion, the Butternut Squash pizza.  Both were fantastic, but the savory nature of the Shitake Mushroom pizza put that one on top!\\n\\nThe shitake mushroom pizza had a mushroom sauce base and was topped with shitake mushrooms, fontina cheese, and eggs.  The pizza had a wonderfully rich taste to it.  The butternut squash pizza, which we ordered without the bacon, had butternut puree base, along with butternut squash, provolone cheese, pumpkin seeds, apple slices, and caramelized onions.  I would order both again in a heartbeat.\\n\\nThe service was great, the bartenders were friendly and knew the menu well.

Definitely above average and clearly made to order. Likewise, my stir fry noodles with beef -- and without vegetables or egg -- came out perfectly.  The spaghetti noodles (recommended by my server) were made to perfection and the beef was perfect with their sweet soy sauce.\\n\\nSpeaking of the server, I wish I'd gotten her name.  She was phenomenal.  She was friendly.  Equally importantly, she was knowledgeable about the menu and was willing to customize.  And above all else, she anticipated needs. Our drinks never went empty and without even asking, we had chili oil brought to the table.\\n\\nLong story short.  This is a go-to place, even for a picky eater like me who normally prefers a more Americanized version of Asian food."},{"name":"Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen","address":"8111 SE Foster Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"2","text":"This is the first time I've eaten here.  I admit I was drawn in by the chicken sandwich sandwich war between Chik-Fil-A and this venue, and violence around the country with fights breaking out between customers.\\n\\nI can understand the violence as the wait in line just to order is long, and it takes quite awhile to get your order\\n\\nOnce in your hands, it is worth the wait.  The chicken filet is crunchy on the outside and moist and tender in the center.  It is seasoned with mayo and dill pickles.  The bun stands up to the breast filet and seasoning to make quite a neat and tasty package.  I very much enjoyed my sandwich.\\n\\nIf I'm nearby Popeye's Louisiana Chicken in the future, I would stop and have a sandwich.  I found it to be clean and well kept.  The employees were polite but a little overworked, which given the circumstances is understood.  Youth is a marvelous thing.  I didn't use the restroom.

(talking to the waitress last time, she indicated they put some kind of fat or lard into the ground bison, so it will stick together better, so if you think you're getting a healthier burger, you're not.  The bun is soaked with fat drippings from the burger, enough that I questioned whether it was really bison.) The beer menu is interesting, and while the food menu is restricted, when they have bison like this, then you don't need much to choose from.  \\n\\nThat said, we had this evening the WORST service experience I've had in twelve years in Atlanta.  First, Travis forgot to enter our order. We waited FOREVER!  But he also seemed to have a memory of  a fruit fly.  He forgot two drink orders, a fork, and a replacement napkin at different times. We'd ask, and then those things would never show up.  (Wherever you come down on the \\"Legalize It\\" debate, I think we can all agree that smoking out ahead of going to work is NOT going to help you do a good job.) \\n\\nSo we get the whole issue (70 minute wait for food, with two other tables also getting the bison burger being served before us, despite arriving after us).  The manager or owner --  whatever the New Age kind of guy is -- comes over and apologizes and says, \\"we really want you to come back\\" and leaves us with a couple of wooden nickels on the table.  Turns out these are good for a free $4 beer next time.\\n\\nso when the food comes, he comes over (as does the chef later) and asks \\"well I hope the food was worth the wait\\".  \\n\\nWell, NO IT WASN'T!!!  We tell them it's a good burger but it shouldn't take that long.  The New Age guy says he'll comp something on the menu.  Travis comes back over and tells us the'll take 15% off our bill, which was about $90.  \\"OK\\" I think, but then the bill comes and he's taken $6 or $7 off.  They couldn't even get that right.\\n\\nSo I left $80 for $79.39 and gave them back the wooden nickels; I won't be using them.  And before the flames come out about my tip, I'm usually a 20-25% tipper, but the repeated errors and lack of corrective action was just terrible.  The poor service made me feel robbed for the $80 I gave.\\n\\n\\"There\\" is going out of business.  It's a nice concept but it's poorly executed.  In my experience these businesses fail, so if you want to try the burger, then you better make it quick.  Moreover, they really need a no drugs on the work day policy.\\n\\nI've tried it.

Founding partners, Napolean (Na) and wife Maggie Bonner, created this legendary fried chicken in 1953. Through the decades the store would see highs and lows and gain a loyal following in and around the Memphis area.  In 1973 Na's community raised enough money to enable him to hand build a bigger restaurant, which he called:  \\"Maggie's Short Orders\\".  In the 80's Na and Maggie passed away, and, their son Vernon reopened the restaurant under the name it is known for today.  \\n\\nIn 2002 the restaurant Na built burned.  Vernon (Gus Bully) had taken little insurance out on the establishment, and,  repairs exceeded  $100,000.00.  Just like in 1973, the Mason Community came together, and, Gus's reopened in 89 days!  It appears the Bonner family are well loved in the Mason area, at least their chicken is, and, this proves that chicken must be thicker than blood.  Vernon passed in 2007, which left the restaurant to his surviving wife, Gertrude.  Today her son Terry and his wife Anne are the main owner/operators.  \\n\\nOnly five living souls know the Gus's chicken recipe.  Gertrude and her four children keep that recipe tucked away and sealed to secrecy, and, I don't blame them.  The Bonner's got it right.  This is how fried chicken (fast food) should be.  A light, flavorful, golden brown crisp coating covering moist, succulent, and, non-greasy meat.  Each bite is sheer pleasure on the taste buds, and, leaves you licking your lips and turning the chicken over and over while staring at it, and, pulling off a piece here and there.  Chicken was meant to be eaten by taking big bites out of it, and, by pulling off chunk  after chunk, and, stuffing them in your mouth.  Na and Maggie are chicken heroes in my book, because they knew what they were doing with fried chicken.  That knowledge has been handed down to their children.  Somehow, it doesn't taste fast food! \\n\\nAlong with the chicken, these guys are kicking out some damned tasty sides.  I really love the fried green tomatoes,  the (country) slaw ( what we put on our hot dogs back home), the perfectly seasoned and fried french fries, and, the excellently prepared baked beans.  Baked beans can be tricky as most folk have a tendency to over sweeten them.  These guys add just the right amount of mustard and brown sugar to give you that tang!  Some of my neighbors were raving over the potato salad and macaroni and cheese.  We never tried those, but, I am sure they are delicious.\\n\\nAll in all, IMO, this chain out trumps the fast food fried chicken competition.  The chicken is deliciously prepared with a light, spicy, and, crispy brown coating that gives your taste buds what they are looking for.  The sides are typical of a country supper, with the baked beans and fried green tomatoes standing out the most.  This location is small, mixes up the decor with unmatched aluminum chairs that can be a bit uncomfortable, and, a one person restroom that has a tendency to have a line five or six deep. Chicken is impressively good, sides are mouth watering, and, customers are satisfied.  Everyday the chicken will present with a different spice level, which helps give this chain it's homemade appeal.  Go check them out for yourself.  They are worth the effort.\\n\\nBecause they took me back home, so to speak, five alive!!!!"},{"name":"Hot Plate Asian Cuisine","address":"14845 SW Murray Scholls Dr, Ste 102","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3","text":"New to the Beaverton area, I called to order for delivery on a weeknight.

Please don't be in a rush coming here, because they take their time (so call and order ahead if you're pushed on time).\\nWhile waiting in line you will see the other items they have for sale; alkaline water, kale chips, and vegan deserts. Once we made it to the order booth, I decided to get the punany wrap on a spinach wrap, I got the spicy kale because I love spicy food. My friend got the original kale wrap on a seaweed wrap with regular kale. I love that they really stuff your wrap with the fresh kale and other fresh goodies. Biting into the wrap I could tell how fresh everything was. It was so good! \\nI got the full wrap (I  should have gotten the half, lol) It was soooooo much food! I was only able to eat half of my half of wrap and saved the rest for later. I ended up eating the rest the next day, which I am kind of glad I did because the flavors really had a chance to marinate in all that goodness! \\nI will definitely be back and am excited to try their other products! The staff was friendly and to food was delicious!"},{"name":"Veracruz All Natural","address":"2505 Webberville Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"We came on a Sunday at 10am..
